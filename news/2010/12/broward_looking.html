<h1>Broward Looking More Like Dade</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andres Viglucci and Michael Vasquez, Miami Herald, December 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The evolution of Broward shows few signs of slowing as the county becomes far more like Miami-Dade, its southern neighbor, than the ethnically and racially homogenous retiree haven of two decades ago, new estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau confirm.</p>
<p>The county has seen a substantial shift in the proportion of its population that is black or Hispanic since the 2000 Census, and the minority share now approaches 50 percent of Broward residents, the newly released survey data shows.</p>
<p>While previous Census Bureau estimates have clearly delineated the trend, the new estimates  &mdash;  which represent five years&rsquo; worth of aggregated survey numbers  &mdash;  solidify the portrait of a Broward County that has become dramatically more Hispanic and African-American in a relatively short time.</p>
<p>The Hispanic share of the county population jumped from 17 percent in 2000 to 23 percent, according to cumulative survey data covering the years 2005-2009, while the African-American proportion rose from 21 to 24 percent.</p>
<p>Those increases reflect in part a sharp jump in the county&rsquo;s immigrant population, the estimates show. Even as the foreign-born share of Miami-Dade&rsquo;s population was dropping slightly, Broward&rsquo;s foreign-born proportion jumped from 25 percent to 30 percent. And the percentage of people speaking a language other than English at home rose six percentage points to 35 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>By 2030</b></p>
<p>The county&rsquo;s own internal population projections call for Broward to continue attracting minority residents well into the future.</p>
<p>By 2030, Broward expects to be a majority-minority community with Hispanics accounting for 35 percent of residents, blacks accounting for 30 percent, and white, non-Hispanic residents making up less than 27 percent.</p>

Diversity <i>within </i> diversity! Who could wish for anything more?   Sheer nirvana to the multikulty proponents who wish to push on us as much diversity as they can possibly mix into the nasty, festering brew. The more diversity, the safer and safer it gets. America will be a paradise of diversity. Diversity is our strength!</p>
<p>Some people may have a rude awakening. I hope they do.</p>

		<p>I was recently in St. Augustine in preparation for driving down to Miami for the first time in 15 years.  A group of Dominican construction workers from South Beach came in the Denny`s  and were so ill behaved and hostile that my friend and I canceled the drive South on the spot. I got the feeling that St. Augustine was sort of a de facto White destination or consolation prize for those not willing to venture further into that third world beach head&hellip;</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t understand.  The Census data for 2009 shows the non-hispanic White population at 46.2 percent in Broward County.  </p>
<p>https://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/12/12011.html</p>
<p>The county is already minority majority although the article refers to minority majority when Whites become the smallest racial grouping.  Palm Beach County is going through a similar transition although Whites are still 62 percent of the population.  I used to live in Central Florida about 10 years ago and it was a major White flight area for people fleeing South Florida.  Then we got the illegal Mexicans and Puerto Ricans moving into the area from New York and it&rsquo;s not faring that much better than South Florida.  The congestion, sprawl, shifting demographics and the suffering quality of life were reasons why I left the state.  I don&rsquo;t know if retirees are still moving to Florida but I&rsquo;d be willing to bet the flow has tapered off.  It&rsquo;s just not that great of a place to live anymore and the nice weather doesn&rsquo;t offset the other things that make living there stressful.</p>

		<p>Broward county has an unemployment rate 12 to 14%, as does all of South Florida.</p>
<p>The influx of refugees has not slowed any either.  The area is a tinder box ready to explode into flames, not long after austerity measures are put in place, because of falling revenues and a depletion of stimulus funds.</p>
<p>These are indeed troubling times, set to get much worse.  I have a hunch that the first quarter of the New Year will have some unpleasant surprises for us.</p>

Hundreds of years ago when the Spaniard&rsquo;s formed their own villages in Florida they lived a fairly decent life free of obligation.<br>
But once the day came, and their race was completely amalgamated through relationships with blacks, their village fell to internal conflict until the very handful of women that remained grew old and died.<br>
Although the story is fairly popular in Florida&rsquo;s tourist books, strangely enough, Floridians did not learn from history.<br>
One point about multiculturalism in more livable states like Florida is that in pursuit of wealth and material things blacks, whites, and hispanics, alienate themselves from God and alien themselves from eachother.<br>
An unforseen prelude to civil unrest among the poor.</p>

		<p>The hispanics and haitians are driving blacks out of Dade. I&rsquo;ve lived in Broward for 20+ years. In the past 8 months my neighborhood has been transformed into an all black neighborhood. I can&rsquo;t walk my dog, go the park, or take a trip to the local paki owned convenience store without some kind of altercation taking place. I can&rsquo;t wait to move.</p>

		<p>I live in Broward County. Miami (Dade county) is something like 90% Hispanic,Latino(apply appropriate term). Broward has turned &#8220;brown&#8221; in the last twenty years. Very fast. Due in large part to the unchecked, massive immigration our ignorant ruling elite have let into this country. The other reason is the massive black people flight out of Dade county into Broward. Which in turn is causing, if slower, white flight out of Broward county. Why this area? Brown people just love these warm climates. Getting them to move to a colder climate is like pulling teeth. And the snow-bird population (old white people) that move down here for six months out of the year? They are dying off and/or vacationing in other locales.<br>

		<p>I live in southern Dade County but commute to Broward on a daily basis. The counties are basically the same. I&rsquo;ve lived in South Florida for 37 years and have endured an endless wave of Latin American and Caribbean immigration: Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, Hondurans, Salvadoreans, Colombians, Peruvians, Dominicans, Mexicans, Argentinians, Brazilians, Ecuadorians. A few white non-hispanic enclaves still exist in Dade County, but they are shrinking rapidly. Whites fled in droves to Broward County after Mariel and Hurricane Andrew. They&rsquo;re fleeing again now, seeking refuge in counties further north. But this won&rsquo;t last long. If present trends continue, the entire U.S. will resemble South Florida. </p>

<p>St.Augustine is definitely friendlier and prettier than anything in South Florida.  Having lived in Florida all my life I can say that the Daytona area is the furthest I&rsquo;ll go on the east coast.  South Florida is filled with too many rich liberal carpetbaggers and their pet minorities for my tastes.</p>
<p>Anon #3,  The retirees don&rsquo;t go to the Atlantic south coast anymore, they either go to the gulf coast or the northeast area, panhandle is popular too.  There are still a lot of good places north of Orlando.  </p>

		<p>I used to vacation in Florida in the 80s when I was a kid.  It was still a mostly white place, but even back then my father knew that we had to stay out of Tampa because it was fast becoming a third world enclave.</p>
<p>I remember once we heard about a flea market in a place not far from our hotel.  We drove there and walked in to suddenly find ourselves in the middle of a copy of mexico!</p>
<p>It was a flea market alright, but it was 100% latino, both buyers and sellers.  Everyone, and I mean everyone, was looking at us with &#8220;what the heck are those people doing here&#8221; expressions on our face.  I was only about ten or eleven, but remember feeling expressly uncomfortable. </p>
<p>My family high-tailed it out of there but quick!  </p>
<p>I have such fond memories of visiting florida otherwise.  But now I realize it is not part of my country anymore.  Yes, the panhandle and certain parts of florida are still normal, but come on!  South florida is really the gem in terms of landscape.</p>
<p>I sadly will not be taking my family to florida for trips.  I did take them once a few years ago, but it felt like a ghosttown where we went.  The hotels were there and all the beaches.  But every other face you saw was latino and the rest were black.  A few white tourists were in the mostly empty hotels.  It was surreal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also heard that Orlando is overrun with blacks and latinos.  Too bad - there&rsquo;s so many amusement parks I would have loved to introduce my family to. </p>

<p><br>
I will add that brown and black people have no trouble at all moving to a cold climate, as long as there are white people there. I live in a city on the Canadian prairies, with average monthly temperatures below freezing for five months out of the year. As I write this, the temperature is well below zero Fahrenheit. Yet we&rsquo;ve had a big influx of Somalis and other blacks in recent years. So trust me when I say that the cold weather of a particular locale will not serve as a deterrent to blacks and browns immigrating there. As long as there are whites there, they will come.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s certainly true that blacks and &#8220;hispanics&#8221; are diverse.  Even among themselves they can&rsquo;t get along.  Black Americans don&rsquo;t like Jamaicans.  Jamaicans don&rsquo;t like Haitians, Cubans don&rsquo;t like Jamaicans, etc.  I even met a Central American &#8220;hispanic&#8221; in Miami who told me he couldn&rsquo;t stand Cubans. </p>
<p>What a mess we are creating in South Florida! Right now, they barely tolerate each other.  When the welfare shuts off, they will all be at each other&rsquo;s throats.</p>
<p>Could that be the idea behind those who have been pushing this diversity thing all along? &hellip; Divide and rule!</p>

		<p>Florida is lost.  Last year my wife and I were at the beach, early morning  &mdash;  Cocoa, the central east area of the state.  Once the sun came up, a group of Puerto Ricans, two or three families, set up a large tent cover, and immediately broke out the boom-box, playing taco-bender music louder than the ocean waves.  The whites all got up and moved away from them.  The PR&rsquo;s made angry faces, probably cursing the whites for their &#8220;racism.&#8221;  Imagine, wanting to be on the beach for solitude, and in order to enjoy nature.  </p>
<p>Blacks generally have their own section of the beach, and typically self-segregate.  Often there will be &#8220;larger&#8221; white women in that group, sometimes with odd-looking mixed-race children.</p>
<p>In the next few years I&rsquo;ll retire, and we&rsquo;ll move.  Probably to a colder northern Midwest region.  I&rsquo;ll never return to Florida.  It used to be that whites retired to Florida.  Now, the reverse is happening.</p>

		<p>When we bought a house in Broward county in 91 the entire neighborhood was white English speaking. We moved out in &#8216;02 and we were one of two white families remaining on our block. Diversity was the name of the neighborhood with: Brazilian, Haitian, and several Latin American countries represented. I have many stories I could tell regarding the clash of cultures.</p>
<p>I drove past our old house about a year ago and it was boarded up and a good portion of the block was what I would call severely run down. </p>
<p>I stopped by the Pembroke Pines mall during a business trip and I was shocked to find the number of whites present below 10 percent. An amazing number of Indians and Pakistanis were represented along the normal Hispanic and black mix. </p>
<p>I always tell people who doubt the invasion to spend a week in Dade/Broward counties.</p>

		<p>Murph, Dave and Anon #8, write posts that with very minor tweaking (we don&rsquo;t have the wretched Haitians here) could have been written (by me!) about S. California.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to ask the three of them the following:</p>
<p>Are hispanics in Florida driving out blacks as they are in California?</p>
<p>I wondered if blacks are fleeing to the Gulf Coast via ethnic cleansing after reading the following:</p>
<p><i>White Couple Attacked By Dozens of Black &#8216;Youths&rsquo; in Bradenton, Florida, Media Silent!</i></p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/3y4mlyr</p>
<p>As for Broward and Miami-Dade:</p>
<p>One look at the show COPS, Broward County, is enough to discourage anyone from visiting or settling in that part of Florida!  One trip to Miami-Dade was enough to scare me away for a life time.   Such a beautiful place, I imagine S. Florida was clean, beautiful and English-speaking at one time in the not-so-distant past, as much of California was before the Third World tidal wave.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beyond heartbreaking, frustrating and infuriating to witness one&rsquo;s home turned into a Third World sewer before one&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>But, here is a big difference between Florida and California:  In Florida, you are allowed to carry, we in California are not.</p>

<p>And yet nobody said anything, right? That&rsquo;s part of the problem. Even if it leads to a fight (let them throw the first punch so you can claim self defense) at least say something. I live in a very Puerto Rican neighborhood and whenever they blast their music, I&rsquo;m the first one over there making a stand. If it&rsquo;s one-on-one, I tell them to their face to turn it down; if it&rsquo;s a group of them, I call the cops with a house or license plate number. Here in Connecticut, it&rsquo;s legal for the police to seize loud stereos, so hispanics (and blacks) are wary when Whites complain.</p>

Some cultural  comments:<br>
a) Latinos   &mdash;   like all Latins   &mdash;   LOVE noise. If you don&rsquo;t like noise, they wonder what&rsquo;s wrong with YOU. To them, it&rsquo;s normal. Noise means a good time.  The more noise they make, the more fun they&rsquo;re having.</p>
<p>b) Latinos (and blacks too)  do NOT love nature. To them, it&rsquo;s just a nuisance&hellip; an unpleasant thing to be subdued, obscured, covered up. Nature lovers are, to them, silly wackos.</p>
<p>c) You went to the beach for solitude and Nature; they went to the beach to get drunk, dance, eat,  and have a good time.  Different cultures!</p>
<p>d) How would you know they were &#8220;Puerto Ricans&#8221;? (You must be a New Yorker.)</p>
<p>d) Puerto Ricans don&rsquo;t know anything about tacos. (But I get your general message.)</p>
<p>e) Be glad they weren&rsquo;t Jamaicans! They wouldn&rsquo;t just make faces.</p>

		<p>The last comment about hispanics playing boom-boxes - that is so true. I know here in Kalifornia the Mexicans do that all the time. Living in a fairly affluent area in Sunnyvale, not much in the way of these people here since housing is real expensive, but they do like to drive around with their boom boxes blaring away (just to taunt us of course). They wouldn&rsquo;t behave like that in Mexico or where it&rsquo;s all Mexican (like Salinas perhaps). They like playing mariachi music just to let us know that they are here. </p>

		<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve also heard that Orlando is overrun with blacks and latinos. Too bad - there&rsquo;s so many amusement parks I would have loved to introduce my family to.&#8221; </p>
<p>The amusement parks are actually still very nice.  I went to Disney World twice in the past few years, and its very clean, safe, and fairly white.  There&rsquo;s also a lot of European whites in the area, mostly tourists but also the workers in the restaurants and shops of Epcot; and also my family was taken to a restaurant by a Russian immigrant woman (who tried to pitch a time-share to us, though).</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been to most parts of Florida, but I did watch a show on the 10 Best Florida Beaches and nearly every one of the tourists was white.  In the Panhandle, in Central Florida, even in South Florida.</p>
<p>Also, remember people that Cubans may be Hispanic, but many of them - in fact I suspect most of those who come here to escape Castro&rsquo;s regime - are just as white as a typical Italian, Spaniard, or Greek.  They are hardly &#8220;Brown.&#8221;  Florida&rsquo;s Marco Rubio is a good example of the white Cuban.  Cuba had a lot of immigration from Spain and other Mediterranean countries, and today the country is about one-half white.  The remainder are blacks and mulattoes.</p>

		<p>@ #17.  This is very naive.  To create a possibly violent disturbance on a public beach is to wind up in jail, probably lose your job, and open yourself up to a civil suit.  </p>
<p>In Florida, for a white to do such a thing is like the old Lone Ranger joke: The Lone Ranger and Tonto are surrounded by hundreds of Indians on the warpath.  The Rangers says, &#8220;It&rsquo;s just you and me, Tonto, against all these murderous Indians.  What are we going to do?  Tonto, not batting an eye replies, &#8220;What you mean WE, white man?&#8221;</p>
<p>For whites, and to use another old West metaphor, it&rsquo;s better just to get the heck out of Dodge.  Find a place where it&rsquo;s already 90-100% white, and surround the wagons, as it were.</p>

&#8220;And yet nobody said anything, right? That&rsquo;s part of the problem. Even if it leads to a fight (let them throw the first punch so you can claim self defense) at least say something.&#8221; <br>

&#8220;@ #17. This is very naive. To create a possibly violent disturbance on a public beach is to wind up in jail, probably lose your job, and open yourself up to a civil suit.&#8221; <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>Throw a punch?  Ha!  That&rsquo;s obviously white thinking. </p>
<p>It will lead to more than landing in jail.  Landing in the hospital or morgue is more like it.</p>
<p>If you provoke a fight, Latinos will get out the knives. They won&rsquo;t bother to have a boxing match. </p>
<p>And they will ALL be against YOU;  while other whites will avoid you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we have something called &#8216;White Flight&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s why there are Latin gangs. That&rsquo;s why South Florida has gone brown.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve also heard that Orlando is overrun with blacks and latinos. Too bad - there&rsquo;s so many amusement parks I would have loved to introduce my family to.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The amusement parks are actually still very nice. I went to Disney World twice in the past few years, and its very clean, safe, and fairly white. There&rsquo;s also a lot of European whites in the area, mostly tourists but also the workers in the restaurants and shops&#8221;&hellip;. rjf</p>
<p><br>
****************</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because those parks are privately owned and maintained, so they have managed to keep up some standards. </p>
<p>And also because there are many European tourists there. Those that I have met are attracted not only by the amusements but equally by the shopping at low American prices. I met an English family that goes there once or twice a year. They are shoppers.  They said their savings on shopping (at the outlet malls) pay for the plane ticket!</p>

		<p>#21 (in reponse to my #17): I said &#8220;say&#8221; something not instigate a brawl; any &#8220;violent disturbance&#8221; &#8220;lost job&#8221; or &#8220;civil suit&#8221; is on them since they started it by disturbing the peace and taking it to a physical level. I also said I say somthing if it&rsquo;s one-on-one. Up against a group it&rsquo;s best to just call the cops. </p>
<p>As for getting out of Dodge, yeah, you can run. But what happens when there&rsquo;s no place (90% White) left to run to? Will you make a stand then? You might. But then of course it&rsquo;ll be too late.</p>

		<p>The Orlando area is pretty bad.  I can remember when the Orange Blossom Trail area was a White working class, albeit rough area, twenty years ago and now it&rsquo;s mostly Caribbean black.  Much of the city has been transformed into the third world.  Historic Colonial Drive is now Oriental with a mishmash of Vietnamese, Chinese and Thai restaurants, Buddha statues and plastic streamers.  I worked downtown for several years and commuted home to Lake County each day, 50 miles each way every day. I finally got tired of it and left the state when the minority overflow in Orange County started spilling over into my own county.  Lake County is now the fastest growing county in the state and the population is gradually turning from what was once a 90 percent White county into an Orange County annex.   </p>

<p>&#8220;Murph, Dave and Anon #8, write posts that with very minor tweaking (we don&rsquo;t have the wretched Haitians here) could have been written (by me!) about S. California.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to ask the three of them the following:</p>
<p>Are hispanics in Florida driving out blacks as they are in California?&#8221;</p>
<p>***************</p>
<p>Yeah it&rsquo;s the same here as it is in Cali, just swap Mexicans with our hodge-podge of diversity (Cubans, Haitians, Brazilians, etc).</p>
<p>I think the abundance of pet infrastructure projects (note: public jobs) and cheap housing (Note: the housing boom and bust hit Florida especially hard) has made it very easy for blacks to migrate.</p>
<p>Ironically Haitians and blacks can&rsquo;t stand each other. So of course blacks will jump at the chance to move into a nice white neighborhood.</p>
