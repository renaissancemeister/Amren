			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Olive Press (Malaga), December 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A PROSECUTOR has thrown out a complaint made by a Muslim family against a geography teacher who mentioned pork in their son&rsquo;s class.</p>
<p>The teacher was explaining how cold climate in Granada highlands helps to preserve local Serrano ham.</p>
<p>The Children&rsquo;s Prosecutor of Algeciras, Juan Cisneros, described the complaining pupil&rsquo;s attitude as &#8216;abusive, sectarian, capricious and inadmissible&rsquo; and ordered the denouncement to be archived.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;There is not even the minimal indication of any type of crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>The prosecutor went on to condemn the media storm created by the pupil&rsquo;s parents and their opponents. He described the public&rsquo;s interest in the case as &#8216;worrying&rsquo;.<br>

						<p>
							<i>Estrella Blanco (Robert Spencer, Trans.), Diario de Jerez (Spain), December 18, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>A teacher at Menéndez Tolosa institute has been denounced by a Muslim family from La Línea because their son, a student in the first year of high school, felt offended during the course of a geography lesson, institute sources informed this newspaper. </p>
<p>This paper has learned that the teacher was lecturing normally on the different climates of the planet and used the Granada town of Trevélez as an example of a cold, dry climate. As an anecdote, the teacher recounted that just such a climate was conducive to the curing of hams. Then the student asked the teacher not to speak of hams since the subject offended him as a Muslim.</p>
<p>According to what this daily learned from sources at the school, the teacher responded that he was simply giving an example and that he did not in his classes take into account the religion that his students practiced.</p>
<p>This could have been simply an exchange of views, but the child&rsquo;s family, which never came to talk to the teacher about this incident in class, did not hesitate to lodge a complaint against the teacher at the National Police station.</p>
<p>Although no one contacted him, apparently a relative of the child did go to the school to talk to the Head of Studies and protest the example that the teacher had given in geography class.</p>
<p>Agents of the Judicial Police went to Menéndez Tolosa yesterday so that the teacher could provide a statement about what happened during the class. In addition, officials have requested disciplinary and academic documentation of the child in this school and the previous center in which he was enrolled.</p>
<p>This paper has learned that the teacher is accused of being the author of an alleged crime of abuse of workers, alleging also racist and xenophobic motives.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

		<p>Does this sound familiar to anyone? The demands of people who do not want to intergrate into the society they&rsquo;ve pushed themselves into? Sure sounds like our visitors from the south, doesn&rsquo;t it. Guess the Muslims will take up marching in the streets soon, waving their flags and demanding instant citizenship, if they aren&rsquo;t already. Seems like those who don&rsquo;t belong here are the ones with the most nerve.</p>

		<p>It is not made quite clear in the article, but this story comes to us from Spain.  La Linea is the Spanish town on the border of Gibraltar, across from Morocco. </p>
<p>The arrogance of these &#8220;immigrants&#8221; who come uninvited into  European countries and then attempt to impose their attitudes and dictate what should be taught!</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Then the student asked the teacher not to speak of hams since the subject offended him as a Muslim.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>And then the teacher ought to have told him that this is Spain, and Spain is famous for its Serrano hams.  This is what they learn in Spanish schools.  If the student doesn&rsquo;t want to learn about the Spanish economy, customs, and cuisine, then the student should not be in Spain.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The teacher responded that he was simply giving an example and that he did not in his classes take into account the religion that his students practiced.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>As was perfectly proper.  And a very mild answer at that.</p>

<p> The fact that the Ham was green means it was tainted, or unsafe to eat. I think the crypto-racist and xenophobic books by this &ldquo;Zeus&rdquo; guy need to be publically burned to protect innocent Muslim children.</p>

		<p>I think of all religions as organized insanity but Islam is worse than most because they are so serious about it. </p>
<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t see how they hope to assimilate into either Western or Eastern culture with their fear of pork or pork products.</p>
<p>In many states you can&rsquo;t even drink the water without drinking treated pig urine. </p>
<p>Not eating pork is one thing but having a phobia about the mention of pigs or pork products is taking things just a little to far. Pork is actually part of our political process (get as much as you can ). Pork is part of our economy. Pork is part of our language and in the eastern world it&rsquo;s part of their alphabet or writing symbols. It would really be very hard to get rid of all mentions of pork.</p>
<p>I say we keep the pigs and get rid of the Muslims.  <br>

<p>Yes, they are insane.  But they DON&rsquo;T hope (or intend) to assimilate. They are there to change YOU and force you to assimilate to THEM.</p>
<p><br>
Since they consider Islam &#8220;the perfect religion&#8221; and superior to all others, with that attitude, why would they want to adjust to anyone else?  </p>

		<p>Since Muslims have this irrational fear of pork we should use that to our advantage.  The next time we catch Islamic terrorists and want to get valuable information from them all we have to do is &#8220;Pork Board&#8221; the fools and they will tell us everything we want to know. I seriously doubt if there is anything in the rules of war or the CIA field manual that forbid &#8220;Pork Boarding&#8221;.  However I&rsquo;m sure the ACLU would object. Now that Christmas is over they need something else to whine about. </p>

		<p>I think that green ham, before Dr. Suess got hold of it, simply meant that the ham was uncured by sugar, salt, or smoke. Thus, a fresh or &#8220;green&#8221; ham.</p>
<p>Also consider the folk tale that the moon is made of green cheese when it is obviously white. Well, green means fresh or immature (greenhorn, green peas, etc.) Well, green cheese is like cottage cheese with no aging hence it is white in color. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know about the green eggs, though I have seen duck egg shells which had a very pale green cast to them.</p>

<p><br>
No, Hammurabi was a Babylonian ruler in ancient times  &mdash;  a thousand years before Islam. He was a pagan polytheist and was given an early moral code on stone tablets by the god Shamash. His former kingdom is in much of present day Iraq. He was Semitic but not necessarily Arab.<br>

		<p>This is the encouraging bit.</p>
<p>&#8221;The prosecutor went on to condemn the media storm created by the pupil&rsquo;s parents and their opponents. He described the public&rsquo;s interest in the case as &lsquo;worrying&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without that &#8216;media storm&rsquo; it is quite likely that the teacher would have been quietly sacked or punished and there would have been yet another little surrender to Islam.</p>
<p>Three cheers for the public creating &#8216;media storms&rsquo; that upset those want to appease Militant Islam.</p>
