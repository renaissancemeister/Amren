<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Stooping to a new low, even by Southern Poverty Law Center&rsquo;s standards, the SPLC recently smeared well-regarded family-values organizations as &#8216;hate groups&rsquo; for championing faith-based moral views, including opposition to gay marriage and support for the military&rsquo;s DADT policy.</p>
<p>The Family Research Council (FRC) was among the insulted parties and decided to fight back, using the modern tools of intellectual warfare.</p>
<p>On December 15th the organization launched StartDebatingStopHating.com, a website and newspaper ad (the latter appearing in Politico and the Washington Examiner) that denounced the speech-chilling &#8220;character assassination&#8221; tactics of the SPLC, while supporting the &#8220;vigorous&#8221; and &#8220;responsible&#8221; exercise of free speech. Those who sign an online petition show their solidarity with the FRC, American Family Association, Concerned Women for America, and others who are protecting the traditional family. Many heavy hitters signed the full-page ad including Michele Bachmann, Jim DeMint, Tim Pawlenty, Phyllis Schlafly, Frank Gaffney, Alveda King, and David Limbaugh.</p>
<p>{snip} But in recent years the SPLC has become known for its aggressive campaign of slamming mainstream conservatives and independent thinkers by likening their views to, say, those of the National Knights of the KKK. In addition to the FRC, the SPLC has slimed Iowa Congressman Steve King, Indian-born writer Dinesh D&rsquo;Souza, African-American law professor Carol Swain, and prominent immigration enforcement leaders and writers, to name a few. Even the films &#8220;Gods and Generals&#8221; and &#8220;The Lord of the Rings&#8221; are suspect. {snip}</p>
<p>If that isn&rsquo;t ridiculous enough, consider that Richard Cohen, SPLC president even wrote a letter to CNN&rsquo;s president, last year, asking that newscaster Lou Dobbs be &#8216;removed&rsquo; from the airwaves, because Dobbs was promoting &#8220;racist conspiracy theories&#8221; (i.e. daring to have an open discussion about President Obama&rsquo;s citizenship bonafides).</p>
<p>{snip} The SPLC also opposes the Arizona immigration law and can&rsquo;t be bothered to stick up for Americans who have been victimized by the heinous actions of repeat offender criminal illegal aliens or transnational gangbangers.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the money. With its net assets of nearly $200 million, Harper&rsquo;s has colorfully described the organization as having more wealth than the &#8220;annual GDP of the Marshall Islands.&#8221; {snip}</p>

		<p>Fine.  I agree.  But where were all these neo-cons and lamestream conservatives five, ten, twenty years ago when the SPLC was smearing and slandering other people and groups?  These cretins couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to say one word, because the SPLC was picking on elements of the right wing &#8220;too right wing&#8221; for their tastes.</p>
<p>So to me, it&rsquo;s all a matter of &#8220;First they came for the gypsies&hellip;&#8221;</p>

		<p>In order for the SPLC and others like the NAACP to remain recipients of funding and support, new demons to pursue must be found.  Hence, just about any club or organization that is majority of all white, even by coincidence, will eventually be targets for prosecution.</p>
<p>As far as DADT goes, I really don&rsquo;t know why opposing it has anything to do with family values.  We know that gays are in the military, and they are usually not that hard to spot.  It seems like a waste of time to be wrapped up in whether it is officially acknowledged or not.  If you want to be a religious fanatic about it, then being homosexual is an abomination before God and you must be vocal about hating gays as your God does and line up with that church that demonstrates at military funerals.</p>
<p>But the historic fact is that homosexuals have always served in armies.  IN fact, our past president Buchanan was homosexual.  Get over it, and focus on more productive exertions. </p>
<p>Concern for family values might be better served fighting parenthood by gays, which seems logically and morally unnatural.</p>

		<p>As successful as they are, the SPLC is reaching a dead end with their tactics.  The only thing left they can do is scream louder and more viciously, but the charges are always the same.  Like the Stalinist purges of the 1930s and 1940s, even these screeds will run out of steam.  In a few years, the name SPLC will be synonomous with a joke.    </p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter; when the old name is worthless they just create a new name, and keep on doing the same.  This is standard operating procedure for organizations of this type when they lose their credibility. With several hundred million of assets, and cash laying around, they wont be going away any time soon unless their heads are convicted of something, or we can sue them out of existence. </p>

<p>Think about it. Gays have no burning desire to join the military.<br>
There will be no mass exodus of San Francisco interior designers<br>
into the Marines. The military is a way to mainstream homosexuality<br>
everywhere else. It will be hard for any white conservative<br>
American group anywhere to protest homosexuality if, after all,<br>
its accepted by the core of American conservative identity..ie.<br>
the military. There is ONE..and only ONE..abiding fanatical obsession of all homosexuals..and that is to remove every norm,<br>
every point of reference, every bit of sanity which can be used<br>
to judge them. They will destroy all outer norms, religion, the nation, God,<br>
history, the family, everything..all so they never have to look<br>
at themselves.</p>

		<p>When conservatives feel compelled to add the adverb &#8220;responsible&#8221; to the exercise of free speech, the lunatics have won. The whole point of free speech is that anybody can say, write and publish anything that is hateful, offensive, even repulsive (think Larry Flynt). The common citizen ought to be trusted to ignore the noise and listen to whatever he or she judges to be important. If even conservatives have lost trust and faith in common sense and absolute freedom of speech, the whole concept is ripe for the dustbin of history. </p>
<p>Regretably, since I kind of liked it.</p>

		<p>There are two scenarios that WILL happen with the repeal of DADT.<br>
Scenario #1.  Battlefield injuries requiring an immediate blood transfusion will become problematic because of the tendency for homosexuals to contract AIDS.  What straight soldier will be willing to take a chance on receiving a blood transfusion from a homosexual?  In addition, AIDS will become a &#8220;service-connected disability.<br>
Scenario #2.  A homosexual in a position of authority (commanding officer, NCO) who wishes to &#8220;hit&#8221; on a nice-looking straight soldier will use the threats of punishment, poor fitness reports, and in general, harassment to get what he wants.<br>
These scenarios WILL happen as a result of DADT.<br>
No amount of &#8220;sensitivity training&#8221; will keep these things from occurring.<br>
I refuse to use the term &#8220;gay&#8221; to describe homosexuals.</p>

		<p>The SPLC (and the NAACP) would have faded out long ago without the unflinching support of the mainstream media. Even local media outlets gave credence to the SPLC&rsquo;s unproven allegations against innocent organizations. Letters from readers, critical of the SPLC&rsquo;s spurious claims, were never printed.</p>

		<p>Whiteplight appears to understand nothing about Christianity, NOR about the multi-legged assault of the gay agenda.  Moreover, he seems confused.  He states that parenthood by homosexuals is unnatural and illogical, but at the same time seems to feel that gays in the military is not?  Yes, there are gays in the military, just as there are stealth gays in any target rich environment including boy scouts.  The thing that keeps them in check WAS the knowledge that if they were found out (usually by hitting on another soldier, or by getting caught molesting a boy scout) they were discharged with fanfare.  The gays wanted this DADT repeal NOT so they could be &#8220;patriotic&#8221; but because they will use it to get military benefits and accommodations enjoyed by  married soldiers, and then use THAT to push for universal gay marriage.  After that, they will directly attack all Christian churches and organizations who, out of faith and common sense, refuse to marry gays, or refuse to allow them to be officers and administrators, deacons, pastors, child care givers, etc.  I am guessing the poster whiteplight has never been in combat, or he is gay himself.  Gays have an inordinately higher incidence of AIDS.  I have often heard of, and seen, wounded soldiers evacuated by helicopters lying in a pool of blood from other wounded soldiers.  I have seen medics with blood covered hands from previous soldiers working on other wounded soldiers.  Were I still commissioned, I would have lain my resignation on my commander&rsquo;s desk the instant DADT was repealed.  This repeal makes it even more unsafe to be a soldier in combat.  It makes it impossible to maintain unit morale and cohesion.  It allows gays to use this repeal as a huge stepping stone to validating their immoral and disgusting lifestyle, eventually gaining Canadian style &#8220;hate&#8221; laws which jail heterosexuals whom object to hiring, living with, marrying, or validating this unhealthy, immoral lifestyle.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Wolf-crying&#8221; is the $PLC&rsquo;s stock in trade (along with fund-raising). The real issue is whether the G and associated law-enforcement thugs will continue to act upon their proffered &#8220;intelligence.&#8221; Despite their ludicrously inclusive net, I suspect they will. The $PLC&rsquo;s patrons and enablers perceive the white middle-class as the enemy and the noose WILL tighten. Keep your powder dry.   </p>
