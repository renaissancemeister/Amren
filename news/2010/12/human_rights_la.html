			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daniel Martin, Daily Mail (London), December 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Membership of the European Court of Human Rights has cost UK taxpayers more than £42billion, according to a report.</p>
<p>The bill for complying with its judgments has seen money thrown at litigation and diverted from essential services, it is claimed.</p>
<p>The court, based in Strasbourg, France, has even forced Parliament to overturn a number of UK laws. It even made the government give prisoners the vote  &mdash;  despite strong opposition from ministers and the public.</p>
<p>Law and Order: The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, where membership is costing Britain billions</p>
<p>The court rules on cases brought against countries that have signed the European Convention on Human Rights, a code drawn up in the light of Nazi and Soviet totalitarianism.</p>
<p>The study into how much the convention and its court cost Britain, which became a signatory in 1950, was carried out by the TaxPayers&rsquo; Alliance.</p>
<p>Dr Lee Rotherham, author of the report, said: &#8216;Fifty years on from the days of Stalin and Hitler, the Strasbourg court is no longer needed to protect us from a knock on the door at 3am, or being deported with a handcart. It carries an increasingly political agenda that is running roughshod over our laws and our courts, at major costs to the taxpayer and to business.</p>
<p>&#8216;In the homeland of Magna Carta, you would hope that politicians and human rights lawyers might have more self confidence. Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States get by very well without joining up to continental human rights courts. Britain can too.&rsquo;</p>
<p> Controversial rulings include a transsexual serving time for manslaughter and attempted rape being allowed to move to a woman&rsquo;s prison even though he committed the offences while a man. The court has also prevented the deportation of foreigners found guilty of serious offences.</p>
<p>The UK lost its first case at the court  &mdash;  which is independent from the EU  &mdash;  in 1975 and had to pay out its first damages in 1980. The report suggested that Britain has lost more than three quarters  &mdash;  331 out of 418  &mdash;  of cases heard in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Labour&rsquo;s Human Rights Act of 1998 was supposed to reduce the number of appeals to Europe by applying Strasbourg principles in British courts. The rate of lost cases has worsened however.</p>
<p>The cost of complying with judgments under the convention is £17.3billion to date, the report said. In addition, the growth of a compensation culture fostered by the court has added a further £25billion in costs.</p>
<p>Sian Herbert, of the think tank Open Europe, said: &#8216;The ECHR and the European Court of Justice [which rules on EU law] now act as a de facto supreme court in the UK in many ways.</p>
<p>&#8216;While we need to remain a country committed to strong protection of basic liberties and rights, these two bodies lack the democratic and judicial legitimacy to fulfil this duty.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>If the men of Old Blighty would stop acting like the people they so often describe with the T-word they wouldn&rsquo;t have to give so much of their wealth to those sensitive people who used to stone each other to death back home.</p>
<p>Time to set that stiff upper lip and do the job that needs to be done to insure the survival of the people who spread Western civilization around the world.</p>

		<p>No free lunch. Those nations that joined the EU join and have accepted, without them realizing it to some extent, the totality what it means to join. Especially those smaller and poorer nations who see only an inward flow of money as a solution to problems do not realize there is a &#8220;catch&#8221;. You have to conform and change your ways to suit Brussels.</p>
<p>A pact with the devil and you do not understand you have made a pact with the devil. By the time you do realize, you are not going back, the money is so good. Or so it appears.</p>
<p>You get something, but you must give something in return. OR else!</p>

		<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m simplifing this but, can&rsquo;t Britain just say &#8220;We&rsquo;re no longer going to contribute to the ECHR or pay any of its judgements&#8221;? And when they&rsquo;re fined just not pay the fines? What could the EU do? </p>

But you see, Britain is gone. The people that bravely resisted Julius Cesar, and who fought the Battle of Britain, never surrendering&hellip; well, that nation doen&rsquo;t exist, anymore.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s Brits are multiculturalists living under censorship.</p>

		<p>Britain needs to get out of the EU, now. If this report is accurate, that they&rsquo;ve had to pay some 42 billion pounds (UK); no wonder they tried to cram austerity measures down the throats of their subjects.</p>
<p>British subjects have to pay for the stupidity of their politicians - those same pols they put in office in the first place.</p>
