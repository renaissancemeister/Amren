<h1>US Teen Birth Rate Still Far Higher Than W. Europe</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Newsmax, December 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The rate of teen births in the U.S. is at its lowest level in almost 70 years. Yet, the sobering context is that the teen pregnancy rate is far lower in many other countries.</p>
<p>The most convincing explanation is that contraceptive use is much higher among teens in most Western European countries.</p>
<p>Last week, U.S. health officials released new government figures for 2009 showing 39 births per 1,000 girls, ages 15 through 19  &mdash;  the lowest rate since records have been kept on this issue.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The teen birth rate for Western Europe and a few other countries is dramatically lower. In the United Kingdom it&rsquo;s 24 per 1,000 girls. In traditionally Catholic Ireland, it&rsquo;s 16 and in Italy it&rsquo;s 5. France&rsquo;s rate is 7 per 1,000. Canada&rsquo;s rate is under 13, Sweden&rsquo;s is under 8, Japan&rsquo;s is about 5, and in the Netherlands it&rsquo;s close to 4.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Birth control is less expensive and easier for teens to get in many other developed countries than in the United States. And teachers, parents and physicians tend to be more accepting of teenage sexuality and more likely to encourage use of contraception, said Sarah Brown, chief executive of the Washington, D.C.-based National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There are few comprehensive studies of why teen birth rates vary from country to country. And experts say there&rsquo;s probably not one overarching explanation. For example, the reason for a low teen birth rate may be different in the Netherlands, where prostitution is legal, than in Japan, which traditionally has a more conservative culture when it comes to sex and sex education.</p>
<p>Some countries may have predominant social values that discourage teenage sex, but abstinence-only education programs  &mdash;  a hot topic in the United States  &mdash;  are generally not considered a major reason other countries have lower teen birth rates.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other explanations? Perhaps race and ethnicity, said Dr. Monique Chireau, a Duke University assistant professor who researches adolescent pregnancy.</p>
<p>She noted the birth rate for white U.S. teens  &mdash;  about 26 per 1,000  &mdash;  is much lower then the black and Hispanic rates (59 and 70, respectively).</p>
<p>&#8220;There are distinctions between different ethnicities,&#8221; and the U.S. whites are more comparable to countries with more homogenous white populations, she said.</p>

		<p>These stats are interesting to say the least. I find it odd how the white populations in the more puritan countries (America, England, Ireland and Canada) have higher teen pregnancy rates than the white populations in the more sexually liberated countries (France, Netherlands, Sweden and Italy).  At least as far as I have noticed, it seems to only be the Anglo countries, when specifically examining white countries, that are pretty prudish about nudity.  By the way, I am a prude myself, and fully appreciate that lifestyle. Having said that, I certainly find this phenomenon shown in this article interesting.  Can someone explain please?</p>

		<p>I have to wonder if the teen pregnancy rate includes girls who are 18-19 years old and married. Here in Utah many girls get married right out of high school and immediatly start families- while continuing an education. I would also venture a guess that many teen pregnancies in Europe end in abortion and this is not counted in the teen pregnancy rate. The out of wedlock birth stigma is not applied uniformly, in some segments of society (black and White) having a child young is seen as some sort of rite of passage and when said child is grown the mom will still be 35-40 and able to &#8220;go out and party&#8221; Unfortunately this usually ends up with a vicious circle of the child getting pregnant herself at a young age. Unfortunately with the white population dropping having larger families at younger ages is something that will have to be looked at seriously. Our young men also are not taught responsibility and taking care of a wife and family- many of them are obsessed with video games and juvenile behavior well into their 20&rsquo;s and are not ready for marriage until nearly 30. Add the feminists that browbeat young girls into the idea that they need some sort of career and can wait until their late 30&rsquo;s to have children. Sadly, for some women they wait too late and even if they can have children waiting until 35 to have kids limits the number you can eventually have. </p>

<p>The fact is that many people who profess to being prudish in public are frequently the very ones who engage in unabashed, wanton behavior in private and behind closed doors. The victorian model of hypocrisy is commonplace in our society.</p>
<p>Why do you think abortions and vasectomies were legalized? They were designed so that &#8220;respectable men and women&#8221; of the community could engage in carnal pleasures without having to be exposed for the frauds that many of them were or are </p>

<p>Well, in the Netherlands, everyone has sex all the time, but condoms and birth control are thrown around like candy.  In Japan, talk of sex and birth control is very taboo.  But, teenagers rarely even date, let alone have sex.  So, I guess a culture&rsquo;s policy on birth control has to match its acceptance of under-age intercourse.</p>

<p>Rebellion.  It&rsquo;s like when someone tells you not to do something or read a certain book.  Well, most times (young) people will do what they&rsquo;re told not to as an act of defiance or to see what they&rsquo;re missing out on.  While I wouldn&rsquo;t force my kids not to do something (unless it is sure to kill them or hurt them), I would strongly persuade them, show them objective reasons why it&rsquo;s not a good idea, and say, &#8220;Look, I won&rsquo;t stop you, but it&rsquo;s your choice.  Does this seem like the right thing to do?&#8221;</p>

		<p>Thanks for all the feedback. I had similar speculations myself but just wanted other peoples&rsquo; opinions. </p>
<p>By the way, the reason I picked the countries I picked, was because the article specifically specifies America&rsquo;s white rate. Ireland I always assume has a very low immigrant population, so I assumed the percentage they threw out to be white overall. Britain has just as big of an immigrant problem as France, yet the out of wedlock births in France are still much lower. Canada was another country with a higher percentage than the white countries I placed in the other group, but it was still lower than America, Ireland, and the UK.  Maybe Canada belongs in the middle somewhere.</p>
<p>Lastly, the point brought up that I agree with most is the stuff about rebellion. I also agree with the poster who brought up the point about women in America getting married younger.</p>
<p>Other than that, let&rsquo;s not assume that most people who are conservative and prudish are hypocrites. Ed, I hope your comment wasn&rsquo;t somehow directed at me.  I see your overall point, but I don&rsquo;t think we should assume that about all or even most people who publicly proclaim to be prudes. </p>

		<p>#8. If I recall correctly, about 2/3rds of all abortions are of nonwhite babies, most of them black. &#8220;Conservative&#8221; anti-abortion activists often have a moment of cognitive dissonance when you point out that most babies aborted are non white. They want to agree with you that it is a good thing, but that would make them racists, which their TV and newspaper have told them is something bad that only natzees and rednekks believe in, and they also dislike abortion because its against the booble or something, so their brains go click-click-click while they make up their mind.   </p>

		<p>#9 anonymous&hellip;yes, you are indeed right about the stats of race being 2/3rds of all abortions. In my city the stats can be proven by looking everywhere.</p>
<p>And out of curiousity, how high would you think Haiti&rsquo;s abortion rate would be? Judging from different stats and scenarios, it can either be high or indeed low&hellip;depends on if the USA feeds them like we do Africa, or they just allow their kids to live in poverty because they wanna celebrate their 10th $200 dollar a month welfare check&hellip;I mean child&hellip;</p>

		<p>IQ differences probably can explain a lot of the racial variation, as smarter kids are better at preventing pregnancy.  Culture is an additional factor.  </p>
<p>Testosterone matters too because it influences sex drive.  Blacks tend to be high, whites intermediate, and Asians/Indians are low.  This would impact teenage pregnancy rates too.  The lower teen pregnancy rates of Japan and Korea might partly reflect their low testerone and also cultural conservatism.  <br>

		<p>There was a time when a person felt very lucky to have been born white. There was a time when people felt they were very lucky to have been born in the United States.<br>
There was a time when people took pride in how they dress and how they spoke the English Language.</p>
<p>To me it seems like these times have come and gone now we live in a time where America the Greatest Place that ever existed for the common man allows itself to bow down to criminals, liars and cheats. I see guys 40 years old with pants down to their knees; hats on cockeyed and spouting black ebo jive as if they themselves were black. To bad were white we don&rsquo;t have someone else to blame like so many others do..</p>

I think that you need to visit Europe before you make such sweeping statements about the levels of sexual liberation there.<br>
England hasn&rsquo;t been a &#8220;puritan&#8221; country since the time of Oliver Cromwell,and it was catholicism rather than an obscure branch of presbyterianism that kept Ireland&rsquo;s national chastity belt on,as of course remains the case in Italy,which you somewhat perversely describe as &#8220;sexually liberated&#8221;.<br>
Anyone who visits the &#8220;puritan&#8221; UK cannot fail to notice the brutal drinking-culture that now exists among the culturally dispossessed whites,a sociological development that has been actively encouraged by the same political and media elites that have allowed homosexuals to marry,to adopt children,and to take to court anyone who dares to speak out against these minority priviliges.Nor could they have failed to notice the vast numbers of West Indians and Africans in the major cities,and it is among these people that the vast majority of under-age births take place.Puritan?,we should be so lucky. </p>
