			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ray Henry, Bloomberg News, Dec. 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Delegates to the Georgia Farm Bureau&rsquo;s annual convention voted Tuesday to adopt a policy that opposes any state immigration measure that &#8220;discriminates against the farm worker&#8221; and puts farmers at a competitive disadvantage. The vote marks the first time the Farm Bureau has adopted an immigration policy directed specifically at Georgia state leaders.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think immigration is a federal issue, and it needs a federal solution,&#8221; said Jon Huffmaster, the Farm Bureau&rsquo;s legislative director. &#8220;And we think a patchwork of state laws could cause more problems than it solves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many farmers are heavily dependent on immigrant labor to harvest crops by hand, particularly vegetables and peaches that are easily bruised and damaged by machines. Huffmaster said farmers in vegetable-growing regions first pushed for the new policy, one of many that was created or revised during the convention at Jekyll Island.</p>
<p>Politicians in Georgia have signaled their willingness to adopt tougher sanctions against the estimated 475,000 illegal immigrants in the state, many of whom work in agriculture. Gov.-elect Nathan Deal, a Republican, said during the campaign that he would support an Arizona-style immigration law. That state approved a measure that requires police officers, when enforcing other laws, to question the immigration status of those they suspect are in the country illegally.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a committee of Republican lawmakers was created in September to study illegal immigration and its effects on Georgia. The co-chair, Rep. Matt Ramsey, said members will try to fill gaps in state law and add enforcement tools to existing laws.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>State Sen. Jack Murphy, a Republican from Cumming and co-chair of the legislative committee on immigration, said he guarantees that farmers&rsquo; interests will be taken into account but that the committee would go ahead and propose legislation on immigration at the state level.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t want to do anything to harm them economically,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They don&rsquo;t want a law that&rsquo;s going to affect them adversely, and that&rsquo;s understandable. But you can&rsquo;t just say you don&rsquo;t want a law period.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jerry Gonzalez, executive director of the Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials, said he was pleased to hear of the Farm Bureau&rsquo;s vote. He has spoken before the legislative committee, where he argued that an Arizona-style law would seriously harm the state&rsquo;s agriculture industry.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The political moves in the Statehouse have worried farmers, an important political constituency because agriculture is Georgia&rsquo;s largest single economic sector. A University of Virginia study found that Prince William County, Va.&rsquo;s hardball approach to illegal immigrants had reduced their numbers but created an ethnic divide in perceptions of the county.</p>
<p>The conflicts are easy to spot in Lyons, a small town in southeast Georgia where farmers raise Vidalia onions.</p>
<p>Even in the rural countryside, there are enough immigrant workers from Central and South America to support a grocery store and small restaurant on the town&rsquo;s main drag. It sells phone cards and Spanish-language CDs.</p>

		<p>Why not use those on welfare and unemployment benefits to work in the fields - that way we will at least get something for the money being spent for those benefits.  We are going broke anyway so what&rsquo;s the big deal.</p>
<p>I know, an even better idea will be to import slaves from Africa and use them for farm labor - this will give us a competitive cost advantage over other countries and will help expand our exports.</p>

		<p>IT wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad if the farms used the same people year after year.  The Bruccero program in California used to allow that.  But these farm workers seem to require replentishing every year because the former workers disappear somewhere &#8220;into the shadows&#8221; in American towns and cities.  This is what makes the entire farm labor situation part of the wider fraud.  It may be that whites no longer work on farms, but I contend that is becuase of a Hispanic take over.  I base that on the fact that I and many older than me used to pick crops, and we were all white.  Kids like me used to do it during summer vacation.  As the situation stands now, the hispanic Farm Workers Union keeps the work in the hands of hispanics.  What ought to be done is to prevent them from hiring illegals and force some of these earlier legal immigrants to dot he work they allegedly came into this country to do first.  It might mean sendng a couple AA created lawyers back into the field, but all the better.</p>

<p>Exactly the same situation: Whites don&rsquo;t want to be run by none-whites but farm lobby wants it: The result of what the farm lobby is doing in Georgia can be seen in South Africa. </p>
<p>It seems like some people will never learn from history.</p>

<p>CIS Study Shows That Farmers Are Abusing Cheap Labor<br>

<p>HIGHLIGHTS:</p>
<p>Production of fruits and vegetables has been increasing. In particular, plantings of very-labor intensive crops such as cherries and strawberries have grown by more than 20 percent in just five years. </p>
<p>The average farm worker makes $9.06 an hour, compared to $16.75 for non-farm production workers. </p>
<p>Real wages for farm workers increased one-half of one percent (.5 percent) a year on average between 2000 and 2006. If there were a shortage, wages would be rising much more rapidly. <br>
Farm worker earnings have risen more slowly in California and Florida (the states with the most fruit and vegetable production) than in the United States as a whole. </p>
<p>The average household spends only about $1 a day on fresh fruits and vegetables. </p>
<p>Labor costs comprise only 6 percent of the price consumers pay for fresh produce. Thus, if farm wages were allowed to rise 40 percent, and if all the costs were passed on to consumers, the cost to the average household would be only about $8 a year. </p>
<p>Mechanization could offset higher labor costs. After the &ldquo;Bracero&rdquo; Mexican guestworker program ended in the mid-1960s, farm worker wages rose 40 percent, but consumer prices rose relatively little because the mechanization of some crops dramatically increased productivity. </p>

<p>When I was young my whole family did farm labor and operated a small farm. It got so hard to make a living that as far as I know none of my family, even those still living in rural areas,  do much farm labor. </p>
<p>The same thing happened in ancient Rome. For many years Rome was fed by small farmers working their own land but slowly the young were killed off in useless wars and the big corporate farms took over because they could use slave labor and were more efficient.</p>
<p>A man couldn&rsquo;t raise cotton and compete with slave labor in the Old South and a man can&rsquo;t raise cabbage and compete with slave labor in the New South. Things haven&rsquo;t changed that much. </p>
<p>The truth is that the government doesn&rsquo;t want a man living on his own land and making his own living he may start thinking that he doesn&rsquo;t have to go along with just anything the government decides to do. </p>
<p>The revolution was fought by small farmers and we know what kind of men they were. These are the very people governments don&rsquo;t want around.  </p>

		<p>I grew up on a (large) farm, and faithfully stuck with Farm Bureau for my Auto Insurance, all these years.  But their Anti-American/Pro-Big-Business initiatives such as this one led us to switch to another company, just this year.  Pity I didn&rsquo;t wait until this moment to cancel.  Wish I could march into our local office with this article in hand, to show to the Agent, before canceling.</p>

		<p>A few years back Sonny, the governor, suspended school in Georgia for a few days to conserve diesel fuel for farm harvests.  When you consider the margins being maintained by using illegal labor it&rsquo;s no wonder that the laws already on the books aren&rsquo;t being enforced.  Additionally, there&rsquo;s so much money involved that the idea of reducing welfare-ish government programs or putting those people to work on the farms, isn&rsquo;t worth the effort.  It&rsquo;s cheaper to keep them on the dole.  Decades of entitlement mentality ensures this cycle will continue until illegal workers are removed from the state.  As long as Sonny and his farmer buddies are making a buck, the rest of the state can fester.<br>

		<p>Those Georgia farmers are essentially admitting that yes, they do hire illegal immigrants, which is already against the law.  It&rsquo;s amazing how much influence acknowledged law breakers have at all levels of our government today.<br>
