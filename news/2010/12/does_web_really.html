<h1>Does Web Really Connect Us?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen T. Watson, Buffalo News, December 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Internet promises to let us connect with a stranger in Tokyo, but in reality we&rsquo;re much more likely to talk to a friend in Tonawanda.</p>
<p>It was viewed as a potentially globalizing tool. But if you look at how users really spend their time online, they interact with people who are a lot like them  &mdash;  sharing the same ethnicity, hometown or class status.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think in part that&rsquo;s just natural human behavior,&#8221; said Gregory R. Wood, Canisius College associate professor of marketing, who studies how businesses use social media. &#8220;Our online behavior tends to reflect, in part, our offline behavior.&#8221;</p>
<p>Millions of conversations take place on Twitter, Facebook, blogs and other websites every day, but most are segregated from the rest. Users talk near, but not with, others unlike them.</p>
<p>Local users say they notice the same pattern in their own online interactions, where they mainly chat with friends from school, or back home, about what&rsquo;s on their mind.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Experts say this Internet isolation is a concern because, as the problems we face and the economy become more international in scale, we need to become more global in our outlook.</p>
<p>The way to resolve this issue is to translate more websites into other languages and to find the right guides to nudge us out of our online flocks, advocates say.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>From the beginning, theorists argued that the Internet had the potential to revolutionize how we communicate by opening up people to new perspectives from across the globe.</p>
<p>But social media drive so much of the online conversation, and the people we talk to through Facebook, LinkedIn and other sites are usually people we&rsquo;ve met in our offline lives.</p>
<p>On Twitter, where people send status updates in 140 characters or less, users start out by following people they know.</p>
<p>{snip}<br>
New technologies such as Twitter &#8220;amplify and extend who we are and our existing tendencies,&#8221; said Steve Macho, an assistant professor of technology education at Buffalo State.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If you dig down into those conversations, however, you&rsquo;ll see that the people engaging in them for the most part share a common denominator of race or geography or interest.</p>
<p>Zuckerman, in his lecture, said he was surprised to see how many African-Americans use Twitter, which recently did some research on its users.</p>
<p>The service believes 24 percent of American Twitter users are black, about twice their representation in the general population, Zuckerman said. White and black Twitter users aren&rsquo;t talking to each other, however.</p>
<p>Citing research performed by Martin Wattenberg and Fernanda Viegas, Zuckerman points out most popular topics on Twitter are exclusively posted by either white or black users. In May, for example, the term &#8220;cookout&#8221; was posted almost entirely by black users, while the term &#8220;oilspill&#8221; was almost uniformly white.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Digital segregation also occurs in online news.</p>
<p>Google Ad Planner found in June that 99.9 percent of Chinese users, 98 percent of Japanese users and 93.9 percent of American users get their online news from domestic sites.</p>
<p>&#8220;We occasionally stumble onto a page in Chinese, and we decide that we do, in fact, have the greatest technology ever built to connect us to the rest of the world, and we forget that most of the time we&rsquo;re checking Boston Red Sox scores,&#8221; Zuckerman said in his lecture.</p>
<p>Beginning in 2008, researchers noticed a trend of users seeking out websites that have an explicit point of view, and one that reinforces their own views, Aaron W. Smith, a senior research specialist with the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project, told The Buffalo News.</p>
<p>Smith isn&rsquo;t convinced the Internet is totally to blame.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this a symptom of the broader polarization we&rsquo;ve seen in the political world?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>Others argue the Internet has changed how we consume news, making it more interactive, and the medium is filled with information that can challenge a belief system. Liberals can visit the Drudge Report, for example, and conservatives may stop by Huffington Post.</p>
<p>&#8220;The key point is, I have to want to do that. It is there,&#8221; said Wood, the Canisius professor.</p>
<p>People employ different media  &mdash;  TV, radio, print and online  &mdash;  to get their news, and on the Internet they &#8220;forage broadly&#8221; and rely on friends to fill in what they missed, Smith said.</p>
<p>But these are people you already have something in common with, so they are sending you links to issues that you might already know about.</p>
<p>Jeffrey J. McConnell, a Canisius computer science professor, laments that we don&rsquo;t just stumble across things anymore because we&rsquo;re always directed exactly where to go.</p>

		<p>I have enjoyed political arguments since I was a child.  A long time ago I concluded that if my knowledge of a point of view was limited to rebuttals of it I would be at a real disadvantage if I went up against someone who really thought that way. <br>
 <br>
It is natural to allow one&rsquo;s likes and dislikes to influence one&rsquo;s judgment of what is true and false,  I do too, but I make an effort not to.    </p>

		<p>Sam Francis lived long enough to see the birth pangs of the &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221; era of social media, and he predicted to a few of us that it would meant that his previous prediction about the internet being a tool of forced homogenization and globalization wouldn&rsquo;t probably turn out to come true, that the result would be just the opposite   &mdash;   People would congregate in like groups, and instead of becoming like everyone else, people would become more and more &#8220;radical&#8221; (used in a positive connotation) version of their own self.</p>
<p>Within a year of Sam passing, I read an article that suggested the same thing, but predicted it in the context of people literally transposing themselves to places where they could be among friends, because the Web 2.0 era meant that a lot of people really didn&rsquo;t need to be anywhere to do a specific job.  The article cited examples of conservative places becoming even more conservative and liberal places becoming even more liberal, but the city it elaborated on the most was on the liberal side, Boulder, Colorado.  It said that Boulder was undergoing a dynamo where a &#8220;progressive&#8221; locale (thanks to the University) was a draw to liberals, which made Boulder more left-wing.  That attracted even crazier liberals, which made Boulder even crazier left-wing.  So on and so forth.</p>

		<p>I think the good professors here are talking about NORMAL human behavior, this is something that AMREN is all about.</p>
<p>Some years ago, all I could do was to discuss my concerns about  Islam, immagration AA etc over a cup of tea with the lady next door. Now I can share these same concerns with thousands of other like minded persons thanks to the net and responsible blog sites such as this.</p>
<p>One of my activities on the web is to explore sites relating to my casual interest in antique aircraft, cars and other machinery. I have made contacts all over the world as result of this, this includes exchanging e-mails and even family photos. This was not possible before the web and these activities can make the world a smaller and even happier place. BUT,I have noticed that most others who share these sorts of interests are white and English speaking.(For those who do have these interests South Africa has 2 excellent sites, one for DC3 aircraft and the other is the best Model A Ford site I have seen, no doubt both posted by whites)</p>
<p>A work colleague who wants to learn Manderin regularly makes contacts with web friends in Taiwan, this is web use at its best.</p>
<p>I enjoy exploring Google Earth and sharing photos on Panaramio, this has led to further web contacts, even across the language barrier, this again is the web making the world a better place, but again, most contacts are white and speak English or European languages incl. Russian.</p>
<p>As I have said previously, I will extend the hand of friendship to anyone that comes my way. But unless there is some sort of common interest, the meeting will soon descend into an awkward silence. Same with the net, why, for instance, would an LA Gangsta Rap musician want to talk to someoneme like me just because I happened to be on Twitter? </p>
<p>Then there are the unsolicited e-mails from West Africa offering me everthing from true love to unclaimed millions in lotery prizes. Should I reply to these just to keep the professors of diversity happy. (And wreck my marriage and credit card as well!)</p>
<p>And, Like most responsible people there is only limited time available that I can spend in the internet, therefore I use it for things that are of most interest to me.</p>

<p>Then how come they&rsquo;re unable to make the connection that that&rsquo;s the same reason our cities are segregated, and always will be?</p>
<p><i> Zuckerman, in his lecture, said he was surprised to see how many African-Americans use Twitter, which recently did some research on its users.</i></p>
<p>But where did all the black Twitter-using &#8220;role models&#8221; come from in the first place? After all, that&rsquo;s the &#8220;explanation&#8221; that&rsquo;s trotted out to explain the lack of black computer programmers.</p>
<p><i> the term &ldquo;cookout&rdquo; was posted almost entirely by black users, while the term &ldquo;oilspill&rdquo; was almost uniformly white.</i></p>
<p>In other words, blacks tweet about pedestrian, parochial matters while whites tweet about larger world issues. So what else is (not) new?</p>

Why do these people believe anyone would want to spend their time interacting with people who are not like them? Do they spend their days talking to people who have different interests? Do they wake up in the morning thinking, &#8220;I&rsquo;d love to spend today talking to someone I don&rsquo;t know about something I no nothing of&#8221;?</p>
<p>These people could call me closed minded. I say I&rsquo;m perfectly normal.</p>

		<p>It must be extremely frustrating to be a progressive/liberal person, when your anticipated outcome always encounters the reality of human nature and is disproved, over and over.  It&rsquo;s like throwing eggs off of a roof, all the while vehemently denying that gravity exists, and being shocked the egg smashes to the ground, time and again. Yet they keep at, bless their bleeding hearts.</p>
<p>And isn&rsquo;t Zuckerman being a bit of a hypocrite, being how he created Face Book to keep in contact with his college buddies, all of whom I assume share the same interests, racial traits and socioeconomic backgrounds.  Now he&rsquo;s disappointed that I don&rsquo;t eagerly follow the tweets of some rice farmer in Laos who is about to purchase his second water buffalo?  Shame on me.<br>

		<p>It is human nature to want to connect with people who are like you. This transcends beyond race. As the article stated, class, region and I would argue, age and religion would probably be factors as well. </p>

		<p>The internet,along with the mobile telephone does not unite us,it divides us,they have enabled each of us to exist in our own little bubble,for rether than talk to the person nearest to you,even when in thier company,people opt to talk drivel to someone hundreds of miles away.The communist elite has achieved its purpose of isolating the individual,under the guise of mass communication,and has locked us in a room with a screen,and so we have rapidly lost the power to communicate with each other,much as the calculator destroyed our powers of mental arithmetic,so too the computer has robbed us of memory,original thought,inducing in us the concept that on the other side of this screen lies all of our enemies.The communists have not destroyed our civilisation,they have induced us to perform this task ourselves,now there is no greater enemy of our culture than ourselves.</p>

		<p>The internet is full of forums, &amp; some can be interesting to browse if you want to hear a different point of view.  But if you try to participate &amp; your opinion is vastly different from theirs, they&rsquo;ll kick you out &amp; block you from posting.

		<p>My take on this and similar comments is that liberals fear (for good reason) the internet medium. The internet puts control over mass communications under the control of the people, not the political, economic, and ideological elites. </p>

<p>I am sure there are more racial disparities than simply cookout and oilspill.  Please share them will us.   Whatever those disparities are the authors were apparently able to discern them without viewing the Twitter-ers.  Either the authors are guilty of stereotyping, or perhaps the stereotypes are useful enough to categorize people by race without seeing them.  Who knew?<br>

<p>  &mdash;   <b>The Peloponnesian</b></p>
<p>The Zukerman referred to in the article is Ethan Zukerman, a senior researcher at Harvard&rsquo;s Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society.</p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg is associated with Facebook:</p>
<p><i>The idea for developing a social networking site at Harvard came from the Winklevoss twins and their Indian business partner&hellip;But when they approach Zuckerberg about doing the technical work on the site, Zuckerberg steals their idea and forms a partnership with Eduardo Saverin and Dustin Moskowitz. In the end, the Winklevosses settled for $65 million.</i></p>
<p><i>Zuckerberg then cheats his best friend Saverin out of his share of the company &mdash; and eventually settles for $1 billion. Saverin was taken in by assuming that his friend would not cheat him, effectively signing away his share of the company without knowing it.</i></p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>

FTR, the person quoted in this article is NOT the creator of Facebook. That was Mark ZuckerBERG, not ZuckerMAN. </p>
<p>As for the article itself, it stands as yet another example of Libtards being Shocked and Appalled [TM] that they STILL haven&rsquo;t been able to force birds of different feathers to flock together. </p>
<p>IOW, they can&rsquo;t understand why their relentless attempts at social engineering and racial coercion over the past half-century STILL haven&rsquo;t achieved that which normal people recognize as impossible and/or undesirable. </p>
<p>Also: re Twitter&rsquo;s #cookout thread having almost no racial overlap with the #oilspill thread, well, that really just says it all, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
