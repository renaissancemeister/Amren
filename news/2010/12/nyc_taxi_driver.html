<h1>NYC Taxi Drivers Urged to Use Racial Profiling in Passenger Pickups</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Susan Jones, Cybercast News Service, December 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Following an attack on a New York taxi driver, the head of the city&rsquo;s taxi-drivers&rsquo; union is urging cabbies to &#8220;profile your passengers; it&rsquo;s very important.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t care about racial profiling. You know, sometimes it is good we are racially profiled, because the God&rsquo;s honest truth is that 99 percent of the people that are robbing, stealing, killing these drivers are blacks and Hispanics,&#8221; said Mateo [Fernando Mateo, president of the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers], who is Hispanic and has a black father. {snip}</p>

		<p>An important life lesson is realizing that almost all stereotypes are in fact true.  These taxi drivers have come to that logical conclusion, based not on what the Media and government tell them, but what they see with their own eyes.</p>

		<p>This is an old story in NYC. I used to know a guy that drove a cab on Long Island (pronounced: Lawn Guy-land) over twenty years ago and he told me that no cabbie he knew would pick up Blacks who tried to flag them. He also said that his company would tell callers from certain areas that there was a two hour backlog.</p>
<p>Guys that engage in that practice are called racists. Those who don&rsquo;t are eventually called victims.</p>

		<p> Mateo is right, of course. And he would have been right if he had been White, also. But of course the Cybercast News Service assumed that if anyone thought he was White, they would immediately dismiss his warnings as &#8220;White racism.&#8221;</p>
<p> Any big-city taxi driver, of whatever race, can tell you that drivers who are smart and prudent are leery of picking up black males between, oh, say 16 and 40 in appearance   &mdash;   especially if they have no women or children with them. Why? The obvious reason   &mdash;   they are the people most apt, in a big diverse city, to attack, rob or even kill the driver. On the other hand, most cabbies will pick up black women and children without hesitation.</p>
<p> The news media are aware of such facts, but the mainstream ones often try to &#8220;spin&#8221; them to make the drivers look &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>
<p> For example, from my reporter days I can remember an Associated Press article which told of how Boston cab drivers who were White usually would not enter black neighborhoods after dark, and their counterparts who were black usually would not enter White neighborhoods at the same time of day. But the AP tried to make it look as if the black cabbies were staying out because of a legitimate fear for their safety; and that the White drivers were refusing to enter because of &#8220;White racism.&#8221;</p>

		<p>It was positively comical watching the local NY news coverage of this. From the outset we were reminded each and every time the story came up how &#8220;controversial&#8221; Mateo&rsquo;s comments were, and all the talking heads pretended to be dutifully horrified at the notion. Yet, no attempt whatever was made to refute what he had said, and apart from the obvious unease of the anchors, it was clear no one was eager to discuss the matter at all - for alas, they all KNOW damned well he was 100% correct!! Had a White person said it, of course, the howling would have been deafening, but coming from &#8220;one of them&#8221; it seems they were somewhat dumbstruck by the simple fact that the truth had been stated publically&hellip;and it was just a little too tough to try and put this particular cat back into the bag!  <br>
  <br>
Ah truth&hellip;what a lovely ring it always has!<br>

		<p>Profiling would be ineffective because the blacks and Hispanics would just find white people to commit their robberies and murders for them. At least, that&rsquo;s what liberals said would happen if we began profiling Muslims at airports.</p>

		<p>I learned a lot having to depend on a cab for six weeks in car country. The first law was NEVER call from a Tavern or Taco Hut after 11:00pm. Walk to the nearest TGIF`s or Bennigans and then call.<br>
  Another trick I delveoped was when my tips were fourteen dollars and my cab ride eighteen. I would get in for what I knew was an eighteen dollar fare. I would tell the cabbie to let me off after 10 bucks in that direction as I had only fourteen and I wanted to leave him a tip. Every time, every race of driver would turn off the meter and take me the whole way&hellip;An eighteen dollar ride for fourteen.  <br>
  I learned another thing too, waiting at the Taco Hut for the cab that never came.  I finally flagged one down after two hours. We went toward my destination when he asked if I was the fare that had called two minutes ago. I admitted no, thinking of the guy that was left waiting on the street. So in the next moment I was!! The cabbie then tried to collect for taking me halfway and leaving me in a real bad spot to go get his original fare. I told him to piss off or complete the fare! He actually drove behind me for about a mile honking his horn over seven bucks. He got the message when I told him to stop making noise and listen to how I took Tony Rodriguez in the city Four Mile Championship&hellip;</p>

		<p>Of course profiling is a good thing.  And no matter what anyone says, they all do it.  Do you profile the big guy to help you move furniture, or are you indifferent and hire teenage girls too?  Jesse Jackson has a great example of profiling blacks, too.  People say that it is wrong.  Everyone else in the world (besides leftists and communists) know that it is common sense.  If profiling is bad, then why do we have a sex offenders list?  If profiling does not help, then why is the sex offenders list useful?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m actually surprised a man whos hispanic and that has a black father is brave enough to admit the real truth. And the statistics being said by a hispanic, that is totally saying something!<br>
BUT, will the New York Post show off this article to the city and public? Well, I think we know the answer to that one.</p>

		<p>A truthful article for once without all the politically correct mumbo jumbo to muddy the waters. Racial profiling got a bad rep from all the people so afraid of being labeled RACIST. Racial profiling has and will save lives. And as white people and every other race knows, not everyone of a specific racial group commits crime. But everyone also knows the two racial groups mentioned in this article make up an inordinate amount of the crime that is turning this country into a third world culture real fast. Some may not like the truth, but the truth will protect you. The greatest enemy this country faces are the liberal ruling class elite who would rather see people die than let the truth come out, who tie the hands of law enforcement,immigration officials,individual states and the media(just to name a few) from being able to do their jobs, with threats of labeling them racists and/or other punishments. Well, it looks more and more as if people are getting fed up with their dangerous and destructive mind set. Gee, I wonder why so many Americans are in favor of deporting illegal immigrants? Couldn&rsquo;t be the crime statistics, could it?</p>

		<p>In one of his skits Michael Moore filmed a black physician wearing a coat and tie and a white ex con wearing scruffy clothing hailing cabs. All the cab drivers picked up the white ex con. The skit would have been less funny, and more profound if Moore had filmed the races of the cab drivers. I suspect many of them were black.<br>
 <br>
Once a black cab driver drove me from Baltimore to my mothers&rsquo; home in Maryland. With no prompting on my part he told me which neighborhoods in the Washington Area he liked working in and where he felt vulnerable. Without exception the safe neighborhoods were white.  The dangerous neighborhoods were black. </p>

		<p> You have to ask yourself what is more important: not violating political correctness, or protecting people&rsquo;s lives. For Fernando Mateo, president of the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers, lives are more important. For our privileged multicultural elites, political correctness and not being called a racist are more important than possible loss of life. Always keep this in mind when evaluating stories from the controlled media.</p>

<p><br>
That was on an early-90s episode of Moore&rsquo;s first show, &#8220;TV Nation.&#8221; Been a while since I saw it, but as I recall they did show some of the drivers who&rsquo;d refused the black fares: the drivers were   &mdash;   as post-1980s NYC cabbies ALL tend to be   &mdash;   East Indian or Middle Eastern immigrants. They brown cabbies all claimed they &#8220;didn&rsquo;t see&#8221; the black fare they drove past to pick up the white fare. (Really, what else COULD they claim with a TV camera pointed at them?) I have no doubt Moore would have shown guilty white cabbies ONLY   &mdash;   if, that is, any white cabbies still existed in NYC by the &rsquo;90s, which as I say, they no longer did. I don&rsquo;t recall any of them being fellow blacks   &mdash;   but if they were, they would have been immigrants too, as I have NEVER been driven by an Af-Am in NYC   &mdash;   not even back in the &rsquo;70s when there were still white drivers with Brooklyn accents who called you &#8220;Mac&#8221; and kept baseball bats (sometimes inscribed with a nickname like &#8220;The Persuader&#8221;) in their trunks. </p>
<p>Another detail I remember from Moore&rsquo;s taxi stunt: the black man he was using as his prop, who kept getting passed over by all the cabs, was the actor Yaphet Kotto. If you don&rsquo;t know his name, you might still recognize his face. He&rsquo;s a large, unfriendly looking and very dark black man who played the Jamaican villain in the James Bond movie &#8220;Live and Let Die,&#8221; as well as tough-guy roles in various Blaxploitation movies. He also (quite convincingly) played Uganda&rsquo;s brutal dictator Idi Amin in &#8220;Raid on Entebbe.&#8221; So, Yaphet Kotto may well be &#8220;the distinguished actor&#8221; and the civilized gentleman that Moore introduces him as, and therefore no real danger to cabbies   &mdash;   but the fact remains that Kotto is also one scary looking dude! You don&rsquo;t get cast as Idi Amin unless you are big, intimidating, and seem like you are capable of great violence. </p>
<p>Who can really blame cabbies of any race for not picking up a guy who looks like Idi Amin? </p>

Thanks for that information. I never saw the skit.  I only read about it.  My own rule of thumb is that a black man wearing a suit is safe. The dangerous blacks are the young, scruffy looking ones. If they seem to be dressed for work or church, I don&rsquo;t worry about them. Even a drug king pin or a pimp won&rsquo;t stoop to mug someone. Within the hierarchy of crime the strong arm criminals have less prestige than the one&rsquo;s who use their brains.   <br>
 <br>
Once I worked the grave yard shift at a motel in Arlington, Virginia. Several black men dropped in to ask for information on how to get to Richmond, Virginia. They were dressed like peacocks. They had a pink Cadillac with a naked lady on the hood  - you know, the whole bit. Everyone of them probably had a hand gun in his suit pocket. I felt very safe with them there.  No one would have dared rob me while they were present.  <br>
 <br>
Later on I was robbed at gun point by two blacks who looked like they got their clothes from the Goodwill.  </p>

		<p>Because I&rsquo;m scribbling from my suburban home rather than in a downtown ghetto inhabited by death dealing blacks and browns I probably qualify as a racist.</p>
<p>At least from suburbia I have a chance of waking one more day.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anyone in the ghetto, don&rsquo;t want to know anyone in the ghetto, and will avoid the ghetto whenever necessary.</p>
<p>Reading and comprehending crime statistics don&rsquo;t make a racist, they make an aware and life loving person trying to avoid trouble.</p>

		<p>even in large town Iowa - a University city of 200K, when I was a cab driver back in the 90&rsquo;s, it didn&rsquo;t take long to figure out who not to pick up and where not to drive through.<br>
Black areas in this city are still notorious  for having any drugs or guns one wishes to purchase illegally - as the city is closely linked to Chicago crime gangs. Local police simply turn a blind eye to it.<br>
We RARELY picked up blacks EVER- NEVER after dark. Those areas we never went to after dark. Many tried to get picked up somewhere fancy and tell the dispatcher the fancy dropoff location; once in the car, they would want to get dropped off in the ghetto. At this time, they were kicked out of the cab and told to walk home.<br>
Blacks are notorious for running off without paying and stealing anything they could from the taxi drivers. TIPS ? HA.<br>
A entire brood of blacks with the big black mama towing them along was another no ride scenario - all of them screaming and yelling, the mama yelling at them, wanting them to all ride for free. Insane.<br>
Apparently this is universal - no matter what the country.<br>
I finally quit this fun job, because a man was robbing and stabbing drivers. Any guess what he looked like ? Middle aged black male. <br>
Time to stop coddling and &#8220;be real&#8221;, like they&rsquo;re always demanding.</p>

		<p>This kind of reminds me a little bit of an episode from that old 80&rsquo;s TV show CAGNEY AND LACEY. The show&rsquo;s writers did this one &#8220;ground-breaking&#8221; episode that was all about &#8220;racism&#8221; blacks had to endure. The episode was given a lot of hype at the time by the usual P.C. crowd, MSM, etc. In one scene, the blond female detective (Cagney) is getting out of a show and there is this black couple trying to hail a taxi. The taxi driver, who they showed as white naturally, even though I suspect even by the late 80&rsquo;s white taxi drivers were becoming a rarity in the big apple, refused to take their fare since he was afraid to go into Harlem late at night. This was presented as an example of grave &#8220;racism&#8221; against blacks. I never bought it, even though I was then a totally racially unaware person. Why should the driver risk harm to himself? How is wanting to prevent injury to oneself &#8220;racist&#8221;? The whole sorry episode finally ends with the big bullying black male detective having a meltdown on Cagney. He humiliated her and left her in tears.</p>
