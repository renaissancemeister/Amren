<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/10/us/10license.html?_r=2&amp;hp">Some Unlicensed Drivers Risk More Than a Fine</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Julia Preston and Robert Gebeloff, New York Times, Dec. 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many states have adopted tough new laws to prevent illegal immigrants from driving, while expanding immigration enforcement by the state and local police. As a result, at least 30,000 illegal immigrants who were stopped for common traffic violations in the last three years have ended up in deportation, Department of Homeland Security figures show. The numbers are rapidly increasing, aggravating tensions in the national debate over immigration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Georgia, voters have been worried about unlicensed illegal immigrants whose driving skills are untested and who often lack insurance, including some who caused well-publicized accidents. Lawmakers have tightened requirements to keep illegal immigrants from obtaining licenses and license plates, and have increased penalties for driving without them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to work to support our kids, so we have to drive,&#8221; [illegal alien Felipa Leonor] Valencia said in Spanish, after she was released on a $7,500 bond in late October from an immigration detention center in Alabama to begin her legal fight against deportation. &#8220;If we drive, we get stopped by the police. The first thing they ask is, &#8216;Can I see your license?&rsquo; &#8216;Don&rsquo;t have one? Go to jail.&rsquo; And from jail to deportation.&#8221;</p>

		<p>In my small Midwestern town, I know of 2 cases where driving unlicensed illegals killed USA citizens.  One was a young mother with 3 children.  Many others in my area have been injured in auto accidents caused by illegals, oftentimes drunk or stoned, and never having insurance.  </p>
<p>Illegals not only take your job, spread foreign diseases, dumb down your schools, cause crime, cost $ billions in taxpayer social support, and add to overpopulation and environmental destruction, and    &mdash;  - they also kill you and your family with their bad driving. We (taxpaying citizens) are left to pick up the pieces and pay the costs. </p>

		<p>About a half dozen to a dozen American citizens are killed by illegal aliens in this country each day. EACH DAY and it has been going on for YEARS now. Illegal aliens driving DRUNK and killing an American in an auto accident.</p>
<p>On what is this statistic based? About 15 % of criminals in federal prisons are illegals. So it not unreasonable to assume that about 15 % of ALL crime in the U.S. is perpetrated by illegals? That would include auto deaths too from drunk driving.</p>

		<p>When I was a youngster in the 70s my family and another family took a vacation in Mexico going in at El Paso and driving down to Acapulco. I asked the first day in why we were stopping so early. I was informed that it was too dangerous to drive at night.</p>

		<p>Of course the left will say that we should provide drivers&rsquo; licenses for illegals so that we can make sure they&rsquo;re sufficiently skilled to take the roadways.  And of course most illegals will simply disregard such a law just like they do others.  These people are largely uncivilized, don&rsquo;t speak proficient English, and are unwilling to pay fees for any sort of document.  They&rsquo;ve thwarted the law by coming here illegally.  Does anyone actually expect them to comply with any other law of the land?  </p>

		<p>I worked in LE for many years and saw the population of illegals go from less than 100 to 6,000, in a town of 10,000, over the course of a little less than 8 years.</p>
<p>It is totally culturally acceptable to these people to drink and drive and they do it rather poorly. Fatalities were common, and innocents were killed all the time, even in that small of a population. 2 or 3 fatalities per/month got to be the norm on Friday and Saturday nights.  We came to expect to see hispanic illegals when we arrived on scene.</p>
<p>I read an article written by a hispanic woman on the M.A.D.D. web site and she explained how drunk driving was a cultural norm for Mexicans in particular.</p>

		<p>New ID laws appear to be an effective deterrent against illegal immigration. You can tell by the uproar whenever the law is enforced. </p>
<p>The new Florida ID requirements forced the pro-illegal alien Miami-Dade county government to ease the penalty for driving without a license. Previously the car was impounded and the driver faced a severe penalty. Now the driver has two hours to find a licensed driver to drive the car and the driver pays a flat $250 fine. </p>
<p>Fortunately such pandering is limited to one county in the state.  </p>

<p>Contrite now, isn&rsquo;t she, looking for sympathy and pretending to be a victim?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a stark change from her attitude when her and her ilk were running through the streets with their flags high overhead, as if they were in the process of taking over.</p>

		<p>My heart bleeds for them about as much as a stone does after being cut, as in not at all. That&rsquo;s because a friend of mine now has permanent injuries that leave her in perpetual pain thanks to a drunk, illegal alien driver ramming her husband&rsquo;s car from behind at over 100mph. He was killed when both were ejected from their car despite wearing seat belts and the car crushed him to death instantly. I nearly been hit head on twice recently, and once the other driver was a drunk Hispanic. The other occasion resulted in my car being totaled, and the other driver fled the scene, as illegals like to do. They cause demolition derbies then flee like the cockroaches they act like. These invaders need to be dragged from their cars by law enforcement, beaten nearly to death the way Russian police beat up troublemakers, then locked up before deportation. If they kill someone, they should be treated the way a first degree murderer should be treated.</p>

		<p>Standard policy for an illegal alien who got into a massive smash-up (driving sans insurance), being to beat feet (if he can move after exiting his wrecked vehicle), then heading for the hills at top speed.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t mean to sound facetious, but regrettably that&rsquo;s the Latino mentality. You cause an accident, specially a DWI, abandon the wrecked car and disappear, PRONTO!</p>
<p>As to the penchant for DWI accidents among illegals   &mdash;   an unpleasant side-effect of illegal immigration just about every state has experienced to a greater or lesser degree. Translated to mean the more illegal immigrants in your state, the higher the possibility of your being involved in a DWI-caused accident by an illegal immigrant.</p>

		<p>My brother was t boned by a drunk illegal from Mexico.  The injuries he suffered really never healed and eventually he died a few years later.  Before he passed on, he lost his job due to the injuries and left a wife and son with enormous health bills.  I don&rsquo;t hate hispanics, ironically, my sister in law is from South America.  She however, dispises mexicans for what they are doing to the country.  She became a naturalized citizen many years ago.  She tells me the test was hard and you had to speak English fluently.  Today, she says no one in the latin areas of Florida speak English and most of them drive with no license or insurance.  The man who ran into my brother left the scene of the crime but was caught later.  He disappeared before his trial date.</p>

<p>  &mdash;  Fed UP</p>
<p>In California, unlicensed, uninsured illegals use &#8216;drop cars&rsquo; to get around   &mdash;   old cars that barely work (like ancient Toyota Corollas or Coronas) paid for with  under-the-table cash, the cars never registered.</p>
<p>If they cause a Corona-fueled accident, they skitter away like the cockroaches  they are, as fast as is drunkenly possible, then buy another drop car&hellip;and another and another&hellip;.</p>
<p>If an illegal mexican IS caught driving, screaming &#8216;Racial Profiling&rsquo; and one call to an illegal-colonist advocacy group (who&rsquo;ll claim poor immigrants need cars to get to work or take their many children to school) usually sets things straight with the police. The cockroach will claim he has no money to pay fines and jail time will cause him to lose his job and not be able to feed his family.</p>
<p>Anyone here in California who doesn&rsquo;t have Uninsured Motorist as part of his extremely expensive, mandatory car insurance is playing Russian Roulette.</p>
<p>And, of course, only Whites in California are required to carry insurance, have driver&rsquo;s licenses, follow the Rules of the Road and register their cars.</p>
