<h1>23 Percent Can&rsquo;t Pass Military Exam</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dorie Turner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, December 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nearly one-fourth of the students who try to join the military fail its entrance exam, painting a grim picture of an education system that produces graduates who can&rsquo;t answer basic math, science and reading questions.</p>
<p>The report by The Education Trust found that 23 percent of recent high school graduates don&rsquo;t get the minimum score needed on the enlistment test to join any branch of the military. The study, released exclusively to The Associated Press on Tuesday, comes on top of Pentagon data that shows 75 percent of those aged 17 to 24 don&rsquo;t qualify for the military because they are physically unfit, have a criminal record or didn&rsquo;t graduate high school.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This is the first time ever that the U.S. Army has released this test data publicly, said Amy Wilkins with The Education Trust, a Washington, D.C.-based children&rsquo;s advocacy group. She said the organization worked with the U.S. Army to get raw data on test takers from the past five years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Education Trust study shows wide disparities in scores among white and minority students. Nearly 40 percent of black students and 30 percent of Hispanics don&rsquo;t pass, compared to 16 percent of whites.</p>
<p>Nearly 40 percent of black students and 30 percent of Hispanics don&rsquo;t pass, compared to 16 percent of whites</p>
<p>Recruits must score at least in the 31st percentile on the first stage of the three-hour test to get into the Army or the Marines. Air Force, Navy and Coast Guard recruits must have higher scores.</p>
<p>The average score for blacks is 38 and for Hispanics is 44, compared to whites&rsquo; average score of 55. The scores reflect the similar racial gaps on other standardized exams.</p>
<p>Nearly 40 percent of black students and 30 percent of Hispanics don&rsquo;t pass, compared to 16 percent of whites.</p>
<p>The study also found disparities across states, with Wyoming having the lowest passage rate, at 13 percent, and Hawaii having the highest, at 38.3 percent.</p>
<p>Nearly 40 percent of black students and 30 percent of Hispanics don&rsquo;t pass, compared to 16 percent of whites.</p>
<p>A Department of Defense report notes the military must recruit about 15 percent of youth, but only one-third are eligible. More high school graduates are going to college than in earlier decades, and about one-fourth are obese, making them medically ineligible.</p>
<p>In 1980, by comparison, just 5 percent of youth were obese.</p>
<p>Nearly 40 percent of black students and 30 percent of Hispanics don&rsquo;t pass, compared to 16 percent of whites.<br>

		<p>On behalf of White Humanity, I would like to apologize to all those blacks whose test failure was not matched by a corresponding test failure from Whites.  Whites should have flunked at a rate of 40% to prevent this troubling and unacceptable disparate impact.</p>
<p>White Humanity needs to restrict all its successes to only match those of the blacks.   Otherwise, racists might find some reason to justify their prejudices.</p>

		<p>The military has been testing since before WWII.  They have a base level test to get in, and tests to determine one&rsquo;s aptitude for placement in specialties.  Contrary to what some call the SAT controversy, the military has ample evidence that the tests are predictive.  People&rsquo;s lives depend on these tests.  Further the military wants soldiers, it is not in their interest to flunk people out.<br>

		<p>Yawn. <br>
The test apparently selects for people over IQ cca 80-82. If the means for blacks, Hispanics and whites are 85, 90 and 100, respectively, the percent of failed applicants corresponds exactly to the percentage of persons under IQ 80 that can be expected in the tested populations. Nothing new.</p>

<p>Apparently no one thought it in any way appalling that sixteen percent of White recruits were unable to pass the exam.  We&rsquo;re only supposed to be upset that so many of our Precious Equal Minorities can&rsquo;t make the grade.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t have anything to do with lobotomized curricula in our schools, could it?  You know   &mdash;   the ones who lower standards through the floor so that all those wonderful blacks and browns don&rsquo;t embarrass anyone by failing?  </p>
<p>Naw.  It&rsquo;s gotta be Racism.</p>

<p>Turning the military into a social experiment is slowly destroying its effectiveness.</p>
<p><br>
We will see a major military catastrophe occur due to social engineering in our lifetimes.  At first, attempts to cover up the true reasons for it will be tried, but the truth will leak out slowly as it does with most government coverups.  We&rsquo;re in the final days of our empire.</p>

		<p>I am glad that 40% of blacks fail the military entrance exam, can you imagine if most of them passed?</p>
<p>  In 1970 I was 18, right out of high school, and in the army. At that time it was common for young delinquents to be given a choice of jail or the army, and I was put in a room with some blacks with criminal backgrounds. As a skinny little naive kid that joined just to serve his country I was horrified at the environment I entered. In Vietnam it got worse, if you walked into a bar filled with blacks you left quick or took a chance on a beating. Blacks commonly traveled in packs and victimized lone white soldiers. Black NCO&rsquo;s were quick to recommend a black for promotion to sergeant, while they left whites to fend for themselves.</p>

&#8220;Pentagon data show [that] 75 percent of those aged 17 to 24 don&rsquo;t qualify for the military because they are physically unfit, have a criminal record, or didn&rsquo;t graduate high school.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
That&rsquo;s an appalling figure! - although I&rsquo;ll take exception to the high school requirement. I didn&rsquo;t have a high school diploma either when I went in the military, but that was half a century ago, when a HS diploma was more like a college degree today   &mdash;   an embellishment, but not a necessity. </p>
<p>And many eight graders (back then) were/are better educated than some half-educated grads with master&rsquo;s degrees today.  The mania for so-called &#8220;education&#8221; and credentials has become such a joke that a degree no longer means much of anything.  I&rsquo;m all for education, but when you give everybody a college degree, it becomes worthless. I won&rsquo;t even mention high school, as a HS diploma means nothing except that you attended for four years.</p>
<p>In short, having more people sit in classrooms for more years doesn&rsquo;t really enhance the national level of education. It just debases it. Handing out more diplomas is exactly like printing more paper money: it does not in any way increase the overall wealth of society. We are suffering from a kind of &#8220;educational inflation&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Back in the worst days of the pre-surge attrition and &#8216;stop loss&rsquo; extensions in Iraq (2005-06), there was an article which came out on the Arm Chair General forums, noting that young California gang members were being encouraged to join up, learn military tactics and if possible, gain weapons smuggling contacts.</p>
<p>The idea being that, before you became a real banger, while you were &#8216;clean to the system&rsquo;, you would learn skills and get cool stuff that would help the rest of the crew defeat the bad guys (cops) when you came back to the real world.</p>
<p>And when California cops met up with these military tactics, on the part of formerly pretty simplistic criminals, it was a real culture change because of course the first thing a cop is taught to do is gain control of the situation by locking it down and waiting for help if need be.  While a soldier is trained to turn on a threat and rapidly gain initiative through application of (firepower) shock and maneuver.</p>
<p>Given that most of the combat infantry specialties do remain white (why I don&rsquo;t know if, if the test disparities are really that great, even among those who pass the entrance exam), I&rsquo;m still not sure I want an entire generation of minorities trained as killers when the inevitable collapse comes and organized federal control and pay is lost.</p>
<p>Best a low IQ, high criminality potentialed personality remains an average street thug rather than a competently trained and equipped professional one.</p>

<p>I understand that these aren&rsquo;t the same kind of automatic disqualifications that they were in the past.  Missouri&rsquo;s own Fort Leonard Wood is serving as host as sort of a pre-basic training &#8220;fat camp&#8221; for recruits that are overweight.  The only kind of criminal convict the military can&rsquo;t take are those convicted of adult felonies, because they can&rsquo;t possess guns.  Those convicted of juvenile felonies, which the military used to reject universally in the past, are now more and more being able to get in.  And I have always thought that while they &#8220;prefer&#8221; that you are a high school graduate, that it was never really a showstopper.</p>

		<p>Nothing startling in this report.  May years ago(think late 60&rsquo;s/early 70&rsquo;s)I was &#8220;drafted when leaving Asia to be an Army recruiter and during my almost 4 years recruiting young people to enlist my recruiting station only had one (1) black that was able to pass the mental/moral/&physical; tests to enlist.  We were a large recruiting station and averaged about 35-40 enlistees a month.  Yet, finally, when I was allowed to go back to the &#8220;Regular Army&#8221; in a few years we had an influx of blacks and when I pulled their record jackets(201 file) I saw scores that amazed me. Of course this was when Jimmy Carter was President and Clifford Alexander was Sec of the Army.  It was always mentioned that previous &#8220;ASVAB&#8221; tests had been scored mal-normally and this was a true correction of blacks mental ability.  Of course 95% of them were &#8220;rocks&#8221; when it came to doing a job and a large percentage were hostile trouble makers that didn&rsquo;t belong in the military to start with. Again, no surprise in this report.   </p>

<p>Repeated over and over in this article, like some nitwitted mantra of the fantasized &ldquo;ominous&rdquo; and realized absurd!</p>
<p>Look every test, from those taken with pencils and paper, to entire continents that either function or do not all have common similarities. The top groups are White Europeans and East Asians; no matter what is &ldquo;done for&rdquo; blacks and Hispanics, even handing them money outright, does about as much good as using a hammer to plunge your toilet.</p>

<p>They have so rejected and denounced the Greek Homer of antiquity, that they have simply become Homer Simpson in a Rosa Luxemburg drag costume after a six-pack.</p>

<p>The US  Army has relaxed some of its entrance standards, I believe to widen the pool of recruits, especially of non-Whites, and to avoid implementing an unpopular draft as the UGS&rsquo;s non-ending foreign wars expand.  </p>
<p>According to <i>Mother Jones</i> high school dropouts have increased from 10% to 19%, army acceptance age has risen from 34 to 42, acceptable maximum body fat for a male increased from 24% to 30%, enlistment bonuses from $20k to $40k, more wavers for serious crimes and visible tattoos while in uniform are now OK.</p>
<p>See Chart here:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/282ph89" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/282ph89</a></p>
<p>What the US Army or Marines have not compromised on is that &#8220;recruits must score at least in the 31st percentile on the first stage of the three-hour test.&#8221;</p>
<p>The military is high tech and cognitive-ability tests, such as the ASVAB, are highly predicative of training attrition rates, job success and accident rates   &mdash;   and that&rsquo;s why the army has relied on IQ tests for 90 years.  They do not want to waste time and money on fruitless attempts to train unsuitable recruits with low IQs</p>
<p>Or as Steve Sailer writes:  <i>They want to know who has the ability to repair their jet engines.</i></p>

 <br>
&#8220;The Emperor&rsquo;s New Clothes&#8221; (Danish: Kejserens nye Klæder) is a short tale by Hans Christian Andersen about two weavers who promise an Emperor a new suit of clothes that are invisible to those unfit for their positions, stupid, or incompetent.<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor%27s_New_Clothes" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor%27s_New_Clothes</a><br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
When thinking about blacks I am often reminded of &#8220;The Emperor&rsquo;s New Clothes.&#8221; It is as though during the civil rights movement a group of swindlers told whites, &#8220;Blacks are not intrinsically inferior. Anyone who claims they are is a racist. Everyone who is not a racist will prevent racists from expressing themselves.&#8221;  <br>
      <br>
Nearly everyone knows what the truth is.  Most prefer to lie about it.  Many enforce lying.    <br>

<p>A Semi-Exception To The Fundamental Constant Of Sociology</p>
<p>Posted By Steve Sailer On 22 December 2010 @ 3:00</p>
<p>You always come across smug dismissals of The Bell Curve as discredited, but the people who think they are so smart on this topic can never explain why the U.S. military has put huge emphasis on testing for generations. In fact, I once interviewed the retired head pscyhometrician of one of the major branches of the military, who had provided the military&rsquo;s AFQT testing data to Charles Murray. He said Murray and Herrnstein had done a bang up job with it.</p>
<p>In general, the military tries to keep a very low profile about their addiction to IQ-like testing, mostly releasing data to things like Rand Corporation studies, but now the Army has cooperated with The Education Trust.</p>
<p>From the Associated Press:</p>
<p>Nearly one-fourth of the students who try to join the military fail its entrance exam, painting a grim picture of an education system that produces graduates who can&rsquo;t answer basic math, science and reading questions.</p>
<p>The report by The Education Trust found that 23 percent of recent high school graduates don&rsquo;t get the minimum score needed on the enlistment test to join any branch of the military.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 23% of high school graduates who want to join the Army and the Army wants them because they don&rsquo;t have other black marks against them like obesity or a bad criminal record, who can&rsquo;t get in because they score too low. Add in high school dropouts, and, overall, the military sets the minimum score for the heavily g-loaded AFQT (the very IQ-like test featured in The Bell Curve) for enlistment at the 31st percentile.</p>
<p>The study, released exclusively to The Associated Press on Tuesday, comes on top of Pentagon data that shows 75 percent of those aged 17 to 24 don&rsquo;t qualify for the military because they are physically unfit, have a criminal record or didn&rsquo;t graduate high school.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is right, but I suspect that to get to 75%, they are simply summing the percent disqualified for each of those reasons and ignoring the overlaps: e.g., kids who are fat, dumb, and crooked get counted three times, not once. Hopefully, I&rsquo;m right that the Youth of Today aren&rsquo;t quite that bad, but, maybe I&rsquo;m just a cockeyed optimist &hellip;</p>

<p>In Wyoming we also don&rsquo;t have the scourge of those groups that fail at such high rates. (92% white, at least until the new census releases it&rsquo;s figures.)</p>

		<p>This reminds of a certain test taken by Blacks to vote. That was eventually discriminatory and unintelligent people were and are allowed to vote for our leader. Now, certainly, these tests could not be abandoned for military duty. Unintelligent people will not bother taking orders let alone protect our country.</p>

		<p>Commentary #13 is particularly interesting to me.  I worked as a psychometrist at this time in a school system serving one of the largest US Army bases in the U.S.  It was my impression that racial norming was being used so that Blacks had inflated scores and thus scores on paper diminished Black/White differences.<br>
When this favoritism quackery of race norming was dispensed with and test scores became racially blind  &mdash;  i.e.,  &#8220;g&#8221; was measured as such regardless of whether it was behind a Black forehead or a White one, the result was to improve group training, group cohension, and the relationships of Blacks and Whites, whether on duty or in elective social interactions.  Reality works wonders  &mdash;  everywhere but in the mainstream media  and in the campus classroom!!!</p>

		<p>This is not a surprise. </p>
<p>How many of those 40 percent blacks who failed were among the ones who refused to study and do well in school for fear of &#8220;acting white&#8221;? </p>
<p>How many of the Hispanics who failed were among those who believed that their &#8220;culture&#8221; was more important than learning &#8220;pinche ingles&#8221;?</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The Emperor&rsquo;s New Clothes&rdquo; is a short tale by Hans Christian Andersen about two weavers who promise the Emperor a new suit of clothes [made of fabric that is] invisible to those unfit for their positions, stupid, or incompetent.</p>
<p>When thinking about blacks I am often reminded of &ldquo;The Emperor&rsquo;s New Clothes.&rdquo; It is as though during the civil rights movement a group of swindlers told whites, &ldquo;Blacks are not intrinsically inferior. Anyone who claims they are is a racist.&#8221;<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.<br>
That is a very good analogy! In viewing the general lunacy of  this egalitarian/diversitarian  madness that we see going on around us,  I am very often prompted to think of &#8220;The Emperor&rsquo;s Clothes&#8221;. The story fits the situation exactly. Most people are herd animals, mere sheep.They don&rsquo;t dare step out of line.  In fact, we see MANY situations like that in the world today   &mdash;   situations where no one dares speak the truth because they fear they would be the only one saying it.  So everyone dutifully repeats the lie. <br>
 <br>
Good heavens!  No one would want to be thought stupid (or bigoted, or racist, or xenophobic, or anti-something, or whatever&hellip;.. )</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m in the Army. Sadly, most Americans don&rsquo;t realize that the military is slowly being overrun by unqualified, extremely uneducated minorities who elevate themselves into positions of power and areas of high responsibility by using Equal Opportunity regulations and special influence groups like the Masons. Army MOS classes are broken down in to three general areas; Combat Arms, Combat Support and Combat Service Support. I served in Combat Arms for 4 years, where a vast majority of the soldiers, officers and non-commissioned officers are white. After reclassifying to Combat Support and being assigned to a logistics unit (Unit Supply, Mechanics, etc), I see the demographics change to predominantly black and hispanic soldiers. Obviously, it doesn&rsquo;t take a high GT score to move boxes around in a warehouse, unlike piloting an M1A1 Abrams tank loaded with sophisticated electronic targeting systems. Most blacks and hispanics simply don&rsquo;t have the brain power to operate modern machines of war. However, the distressing picture is that America&rsquo;s front line Army is powered and driven by a majority of White soldiers, while being supported and supplied from the rear by an overwhelming majority of black and hispanic soldiers. Talk about a recipe for future disaster. Most Whites recognize and are proud of the fact that they serve in the same Continental Army as the one GEN George Washington helped to create, whereas blacks and hispanics often refer to Uncle Sam as Uncle Sugar and are loyal only to their fellow minorities, not the American People they serve. I could fill the forum with stories of female black &#8220;soldiers&#8221; who join the Army, get pregnant and fulfill their 6-8 years of service barely doing any work whatsoever, while getting far more benefits than they would on welfare. The Army has become a charity for minorities. All it takes is a black command sergeant major to ensure that any support unit fills it&rsquo;s ranks with such undesirables. The joys of Equal Opportunity? When I attended Signal School in Fort Gordon, Georgia, every single instructor was black except for one, and the only one with a legitimate college degree was, you guessed it, the White instructor. The blacks had all either lied about their degrees or had obtained them from reputed degree mills, not worth the paper they were printed on. They bragged about these facts almost endlessly, as if weakening the capabilities of the United States Army was something to be proud of. The Military has become rotten from the outside in.</p>

Reading this, it occurs to me that these comments could have been written by a Roman soldier in the final days of the Roman Empire, just before its collapse. </p>
<p>Worth noting is that it took Rome 400 years to collapse. We&rsquo;ve just been through &#8220;The American Century&#8221;, and how brief it was! Already the wolves are nipping at our heels.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re  deeply in debt to foreign creditors, sold out by self-serving politicians and businessmen who don&rsquo;t care a whit about America, patriotism is sneered at as old fashioned and our borders have become a joke, and we&rsquo;re being invaded by barbarian hordes from without while no one does anything to stop them. </p>
<p>And to make it worse, our military is falling into the hands of others who don&rsquo;t care about the American republic, its traditions and people,  and who are increasingly in positions of power. Just like Rome!  </p>
<p>What greater parallel can there be?  When will they seize control and start making their own emperors?</p>
