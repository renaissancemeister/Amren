			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chris Chase, Yahoo! Sports, December 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>NBC&rsquo;s Peter King reports that Barack Obama called Philadelphia Eagles owner Lurie earlier this week to congratulate him for giving Vick a second chance after his release from prison. According to King, the president said that released prisoners rarely receive a level playing field and that Vick&rsquo;s story could begin to change that.</p>
<p>Forget your political allegiances or feelings about Michael Vick and take a step back to think about this. The sitting president of the United States went out of his way to publicly praise a man who, 3 1/2 years ago, many thought would never play again in the NFL. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For Obama to praise Vick now shows a number of things, namely that uttering the quarterback&rsquo;s name is thought to be a safe political move. {snip}</p>
<p>Because, if you think about it, Vick got that &#8220;second chance&#8221; from Lurie 16 months ago. There was no phone call from the president then. Praising Vick at that time would have been a political third rail. But now that Vick is playing great and most people seem to have either forgiven him or stopped caring about his transgressions, it&rsquo;s a shrewd political move. After what could be termed a rough two years in office, the president is looking for a second chance from the people who have turned against him over the past two years. Supporting a huge star like Vick could help with the president&rsquo;s recent image problems. It may not register much nationally, but it couldn&rsquo;t hurt in Pennsylvania. After all, it&rsquo;s a swing state and 2012 is just around the corner.<br>

		<p>This was a BIG ISSUE to the black community. The threat of some <br>
form of accountability was so threatening to the very foundation of<br>
the black way of life that a multimillionaire moron living in a mansion and getting his kicks strangling helpless dogs to death<br>
just HAD to be forgiven. Otherwise &#8220;community&#8221; as blacks know it<br>
would have come to an end.</p>

		<p>Two things: <br>
First, Obama is an opportunist - nothing more! He has no clue that he is depleting our moral fabric with his misguided endorsement of a reprobate. An individual feels some sense of restraint when they contemplate doing evil if they realize that there are severe and lasting consequences for their actions. Remove those consequences and you remove the restraint. <br>
Second, Vick will forever be a &#8220;little person&#8221; in my eyes. Long before the horrific tales of the brutal dog fighting, I watched Vick disrespect one of the great legends of football. When Johnny Unitas died there was a moment of silence held in every NFL stadium. I&rsquo;ll never forget watching Vick just sit on the bench with a distant, impatient, and disgusted look on his face. I can&rsquo;t remember for sure - but I think he actually picked his nose!<br>
I fear that if his team makes it to the super bowl, let alone wins it (God forbid), it will do even more to empower the weak and pathologically minded!<br>
Go Falcons or Packers!</p>

		<p>Michael Vick isnt being given a &#8220;second chance&#8221; now is he?<br>
He isnt some ex-con being given a job as a car mechanic<br>
or a grocery clerk as a means to earn sell respect and contribute<br>
to society. Michael Vick is being given multi million dollar<br>
contracts, and paraded as a hero in front of millions of cheering <br>
blacks. This isnt a &#8220;second chance&#8221; its turning the entire<br>
world upside down, the entier WHITE world of accountability,<br>
proportion, justice and decency. And the code name blacks give<br>
to this insanity..is &#8220;forgiveness&#8221;. </p>

<p>If this &#8220;Chris Chase&#8221; seriously thinks that Caliph Obongo is going to carry Pennsylvania by giving a high five to a football-toting ex-con, he doesn&rsquo;t know much about Pennsylvanians.</p>
<p>The Caliph seems to truly believe that being president is no different from being a movie star, making a call to his PR agent before posturing for the grocery-store tabloids.  That sort of shuckin&rsquo; an&rsquo; jivin&rsquo; may fly in the more dangerous parts of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, but few White Pennsylvanians are buying what he&rsquo;s selling any more.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s always possible that Obongo doesn&rsquo;t know there <i>are</i> White Pennsylvanians.  Or care.<br>

		<p><i>Barack Obama called Philadelphia Eagles owner Lurie earlier this week to congratulate him for giving Vick a second chance.</i></p>
<p>Well, how is this different from when President Clinton called the owner of the Atlanta Braves after John Rocker made a few &#8216;controversial&rsquo; comments about New Yorkers?</p>
<p>Then-President Clinton did defend Rocker didn&rsquo;t he?  Defend his First Amendment Rights as an American?  Fans in Atlanta gave Rocker a standing ovation, didn&rsquo;t they, whenever he entered the stadium?  He was held up as a role model for children, was he not?  </p>
<p>Baseball fans were asked by Clinton to give Rocker a second chance after he groveled a bit to Braves Hall-of-Famer Hank Aaron and Atlanta Mayor and Congressman Andrew Young, weren&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>Please correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>
<p>As for Vick:  He tortured and killed dogs with his own hands for fun and helped send his cousin and friends to prison by funding their illegal dog fighting ring and lifestyle for years.</p>
<p><b>Hey Michael, how would you like to be hanged, electrocuted, or drowned for not performing well enough?</b></p>

Football is just a tool to control us and distract us as they herd us into the globalist pen. Down with GOG (Global Occupation Government)! Boycott all the dumb sports. </p>

<p>White Humanity just does not have the mental capacity to comprehend, understand, or accept the moral depravity of typical African &#8220;Americans&#8221;.  Blacks ALWAYS defend black criminals and demand the most lenient of terms, all the while knowing that when the black is out of jail, he&rsquo;s most like to attack a White girl.

<p>What a horrible statement coming from &#8220;the president!&#8221; So apparently Obama has absolutely no faith in the criminal justice system, the free enterprise system, or the United States itself! </p>
<p>This kind of philosophy that wrongdoers are somehow the victims rather than the victimizers of society is the reason why crime has skyrocketed 10 times since the 1950s, and it&rsquo;s absolutely disgusting that someone in Obama&rsquo;s position would endorse this reprehensible point of view.</p>

		<p>Vick is a dispacable human being on a moral level, but I don&rsquo;t think what he did should be illegal.  The government needs to stop meddling in purely moral/ethical matters. I don&rsquo;t think dog fighting is any worse than hunting aside from man&rsquo;s emotional and setimental attachment to dogs. It is irrational to base laws on sediment and feelings. </p>

		<p>I know that I am being unAmerican, but the only thing Eagles fans care about is the Eagles winning. Many fans have other values, but they are inoperative during the football season. Vick&rsquo;s career will not affect the voting in Philadelphia (solidly Democrat), let alone Pennsylvania. </p>

		<p>Of course he will be completely forgiven in the press - he&rsquo;s black! And we know how our ludicrously liberal media play that game. And what a game it is, because had he been white, the press would never let him live it down. And Lurie would never have gotten a call from Obama. Which was an ignorant and classless move on his part.</p>

		<p><i>According to King, the president said that released prisoners rarely receive a level playing field&hellip;</i></p>
<p>Really?  I would have never guessed.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;s supposed to be.  Released prisoners are not supposed to be on a level playing field with, e.g. Jared Taylor.  Their playing field levels off some if they behave once they get out of prison, but it never fully levels out, even with a full pardon, because full pardons might wipe away rap sheets, but not people&rsquo;s memories.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that in Obama&rsquo;s Chicago, a lot of black men wind up going to prison.  A caller to Chicago&rsquo;s black talk radio station summer before last said that murder should be only a misdemeanor, simply because so many black men commit murder, and a felony sheet makes it hard for them to find jobs.</p>
<p>Vick now wants to own a dog, and he needs a judge&rsquo;s permission because this violates his probation.  Really, I don&rsquo;t think he wants to own a dog because he wants the companionship of a dog, nor does he really want a dog that much, truth be told.  I think he&rsquo;s reading a script from his PR handlers, and this bit about &#8220;wanting a dog&#8221; isn&rsquo;t the end, but the means to the end of rehabbing his public image as much as possible, to get the dog fighting ring as far back in people&rsquo;s minds as possible, so that his next contract can be as big as possible.</p>

<p>  While I admit a felon who has served his or her time should be given another chance, I exclude Michael Vick from that humane amnesty. Should our President praise a person like Michael Vick, who, in my opinion, couldn&rsquo;t serve as a role model for any civilized human being.  Callous cruelty to animals shouldn&rsquo;t be rewarded with multi million dollar football contracts.</p>

		<p>There are probably hundreds of really good football players out there that would love the chance to be starting quarter-back for the Eagles but will never even get a shot at it because they need to be black, they need to be criminals, and they need to be endorsed by a racist president.  The message Obama is sending is if you are a white hard working tax paying law-abiding citizen you will get the &#8220;shaft&#8221; in every way possible but if you are a black or Hispanic criminal you will be rewarded in every way possible. </p>
<p>    All this falls in line with Obama&rsquo;s boss who is the head &#8220;puppet master&#8221; known as George Soros.  In his own words Soros hates America with a passion and is the only country that stands in his way of &#8220;global domination&#8221; so he wants to bring us down by collapsing our economy, brainwashing our youth, flooding our borders with millions of illegals, creating chaos, and badmouthing everything that America and our forefathers stand for.  He is doing all this through Obama and hundreds of left-wing organizations that are intent on the destruction of America and they also get funded with billions of Soros dollars. This is why Obama has the time to get involved with NFL business.  It&rsquo;s because &#8220;the puppet masters plan&#8221; is becoming a reality and he doesn&rsquo;t want to stand in the way by doing something that might actually help us.  </p>
