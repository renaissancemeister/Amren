<h1><a href="http://www.cultureandmediainstitute.org/articles/2010/20101214152557.aspx">SPJ Takes Up Crusade Against Term &#8216;Illegal Immigrant&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alana Goodman, Culture and Media Institute, December 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Society for Professional Journalists (SPJ)&rsquo;s Diversity Committee has announced that it will be launching a year-long campaign to educate journalists about the hurtfulness of phrases like &#8220;illegal immigrant,&#8221; which is the term currently preferred by the influential AP Stylebook.</p>
<p>The label &#8220;remains offensive to Latinos, and especially Mexicans, and to the fundamentals of American jurisprudence,&#8221; wrote Leo E. Laurence, a member of the SPJ Diversity Committee and the editor the San Diego News Service {snip}.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Laurence argues that the terms &#8220;undocumented immigrant&#8221; or &#8220;undocumented worker&#8221; should replace &#8220;illegal immigrant,&#8221; because the U.S. legal system presumes that one is innocent until proven guilty.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Drunk drivers are also innocent until convicted in a court of law  &mdash;  and yet the Miami Herald headline &#8220;Miami police cracking down on drunk drivers&#8221; hasn&rsquo;t warranted a similar critique from SPJ&rsquo;s civil libertarian crusaders. Car theft, too, is considered a crime that must be adjudicated through the legal system. But when the AP reports that &#8220;Newport News police want to reduce car thefts,&#8221; does the SPJ consider this a violation of the constitutional rights of the car thief community.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The SPJ diversity committee says &#8220;undocumented immigrant&#8221; is a more appropriate description. Yet living in the U.S. without any documentation of citizenship is illegal. Using the term &#8220;undocumented immigrant&#8221; is disingenuous, because it downplays the severity of the crime. It&rsquo;s like calling a car thief an &#8220;unauthorized driver&#8221;  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s misleading to the point of inaccuracy. And when a journalist makes the decision to mislead readers, in an attempt to portray a person or group in a more positive light, it can&rsquo;t be called anything but pure advocacy.</p>

		<p>I could add another example:  While there are no &#8220;illegal immigrants&#8221; anymore, much less &#8220;black boys,&#8221; there will surely be &#8220;right wing extremists,&#8221; &#8220;gun nuts,&#8221; &#8220;former members of the K-group,&#8221; &#8220;neo-Nazis&#8221; and &#8220;white supremacists&#8221; for the entirety of the foreseeable future.</p>

		<p>I just got finished &#8216;working&rsquo; in the Oregon State Employment office, where I spent ten weeks (through SCSEP, a federal program for unemployable seniors to put their skills to social good at $8 an hour) helping other unemployed people use PCs to get unemployment checks.</p>
<p>  Almost every Hispanic had absolutely no computer skills at all.  Could not understand the difference between a User_Name and a password.  Would enter numbers using the function keys and ask why they would not appear on the screen.  Could not comprehend that the mouse had two buttons not one.  </p>
<p>  Now of course I realize that this is trival, and the most intelligent person on earth 100 years ago would have the same difficulties.  But still&hellip;  Most of the people had little or no ability to understand English.  When I used the web-based Google or Systran translator to convert my English into Spanish, I could read the Spanish even though I&rsquo;ve studied French in school instead.  I realized that many of the Hispanic men simply couldn&rsquo;t read Spanish and barely had gone to school in Mexico.  How they were managing to get unemployment checks in Gresham Oregon is beyond me!</p>
<p>  Then I asked myself, what if the situation were reversed, and it was I who was in Mexico.  And it was I in the Mexican employment office, expecting to get a big fat check for the local state for not working, and also expecting that the people in the Mexican Unemployment Office would of course be willing and able to answer all my questions in English (or any other of the 130 languages that Oregon provides translation services for when people apply for welfare checks here)!  </p>
<p>  Would they just laugh at me and throw me out?  Or would they get all self-righteously mad and call the local police to have me beaten, extorted, reported, and deported?  </p>
<p>  Why do we feel such a necessity to be &#8216;so good&rsquo; with everyone who manages to somehow get themselves into the USA?  Would any of these people ever help us if we were in their situation?</p>

Since we&rsquo;re told no human being is illegal, I use the term &#8216;criminal alien&rsquo;. Since they commit a crime by crossing the border illegally, they are criminals.</p>
<p>As with other name changes to placate minorities, whatever new term is used, it will soon acquire the same baggage and need to be replaced.<br/>

		<p>Everytime I&rsquo;m called a raciss and ordered to &#8220;acknowledge the burden of my unearned White privilege,&#8221; my feelings get hurt.  Demeaning my Whiteness as having characteristics which are deserving of punishment only creates a climate that legitimizes hatred and violence against me.  I am a victim of hate speech.</p>

		<p>These fake journalists might want to do a story on illegal immigrants trying to sneak into Mexico, Cuba or that great democracy, Venezuela.  They might find themselves to be &#8220;undocumented&#8221; prisoners in a prison where they are not &#8220;presumed innocent&#8221;?</p>

		<p>Laurence argues that the terms &ldquo;undocumented immigrant&rdquo; or &ldquo;undocumented worker&rdquo; should replace &ldquo;illegal immigrant,&rdquo; &hellip;</p>
<p>The purpose is to soften the meaning of the words and thereby soften the offense.  Would Laurence also argue that we should call &#8220;illegal guns&#8221; &#8220;undocumented guns&#8221; or better yet &#8220;undocumented protection&#8221; or &#8220;undocumented persuasion&#8221;.   </p>

		<p>There is a Canadian non-profit organization called the Media Awareness Network which offers packaged lesson plans to educators.</p>
<p>The anti-white slant of their materials is immediately obvious in their use of the awkward term &#8216;people of colour&rsquo;, which suggests unlikely solidarity across economic classes between millionaire Asian professionals, unemployed Caribbean welfare mothers, illegal Hispanic construction workers, wealthy Arab restaurant owners, and urban-dwelling aboriginals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as though being non-white immediately makes one a part of a monolithic oppressed, regardless of economic standing.  I&rsquo;m sure a cultured, monied Chinese from Hong Kong would recoil at being grouped with illiterate Africans, but that is but an example of the sub-conscious racism of leftists.</p>
<p>The media landscape is the battleground of the anti-white genocidal race war. Our adversaries are in the business of indoctrination.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Illegal Immigrant&#8221; is a contradiction of terms.</p>
<p>Foreign citizens in the USA illegally are &#8220;illegal aliens&#8221; or &#8220;invaders&#8221;.</p>
<p>An immigrant cannot be in the USA illegally. In order to be an immigrant, they must have entered the country lawfully, otherwise they are NOT an immigrant.</p>
<p>This non-issue is just more deliberate confusion and disinformation by the Open Borders lobby.<br/>

<p>I, myself, am not pleased with the term &#8220;illegal immigrant,&#8221; because while these people are, by definition, here illegally, not all are immigrants. An &#8220;immigrant&#8221; is commonly defined as one who leaves one country to settle permanently in another, yet not all those here illegally wish to become US citizens. They are not immigrants; they are foreign citizens residing in the US illegally.</p>
<p>But note how Laurence, himself, suggests use of terms (&#8220;immigrant&#8221; and &#8220;worker&#8221;) that are based on presumptions not applicable to all these peoples. After all, not all are employed and, thus, are not &#8220;workers,&#8221; and not all are &#8220;immigrants.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laurence is simply advocating use of words designed to inculcate in the public&rsquo;s mind a more benign (from the illegals&rsquo; perspective) belief: they&rsquo;re all just hardworkers looking to immigrate to the US for a better life. I&rsquo;m surprised he hasn&rsquo;t somehow worked the term &#8220;family&#8221; into his proposed meme.</p>

		<p>The word &#8216;undocumented&rsquo; is just a silly weasel-word invented by some leftists somewhere, as I&rsquo;ve said it means absolutely nothing, there is no such status as &#8216;documented&rsquo;, &#8216;document&rsquo; can mean absolutely anything the author chooses it to mean.<br/>
 &#8216;Illegal&rsquo; however has a clear, precise and unambiguous meaning, it simply means &#8216;contravening the law&rsquo;.Now as illegal immigrants have, by definition clearly, explicitly and intentionally broken the laws of the United States by entry under false pretences, then the phrase is not only justified, but the only fitting phrase to use.</p>

		<p>Recall that it was not so long ago that the term used in this article, &#8220;illegal immigrant&#8221; was the new PC term for these people. At the time, &#8220;illegal alien&#8221; was the term used, but it underwent the same subtle shift in language exhibited in this article. Good luck finding the term &#8220;alien&#8221; nowadays. </p>
<p>Orwell was so right how language can be easily manipulated by flushing with a few flushes down the memory hole.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Drunk drivers are also innocent until convicted in a court of law.&#8221;  <br/>
That is absolutely incorrect.  The presumption of innocence exists only inside the courtroom; there is no obligation or law requiring the general public or even journalists to presume a suspect is innocent.  And that makes sense  &mdash;  a court has no authority or power over persons over whom the court has no jurisdiction.  Journalists presume that suspects are innocent only as part of jounalistic tradition and out of a community obligation to avoid the court having to grant motions for change of venue due to pre trial publicity.</p>

Rapists could become uninvited sex partners. Car thieves could become automotive ownership reassignment specialists.  </p>

&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ve risen that far.  If you watched what happened to white farm holdings in Rhodesia when the blacks took over (&#8216;Addio Africa&rsquo; on one of the postings a few days ago), you see what happens when primitive minds get advanced social enablement.  Now imagine that most of Mexico _started out_ that way.  The only reason it&rsquo;s cheap to live in Mexico is because the amenities of a real, first world, society are NOT PRESENT, particularly in the outlying communities.</p>
<p>#10 Alexandra,</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br/>
I don&rsquo;t care if it hurts their feelings. They have no right to come here and start mooching and raising havoc. They like Mexico (or whatever country) so much, no one&rsquo;s keeping them from heading back.<br/>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just what the elites want you to focus on.  Since it&rsquo;s not the Mexicans letting themselves in.  They could be stopped in a matter of days, using modern technology and a little &#8216;extreme prejudice&rsquo; example making.</p>
<p>The people who allow Mexicans to come into our country are the people you CAN&rsquo;T reach.  The people you nominally elected.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t confuse the easy target with the real one.</p>
<p>And never forget that, so long as Mexico considers all her nationals to be merely &#8216;abroad&rsquo; and not of different allegiance, Mexico as a state cannot refuse them reentrance.</p>
<p>If we were to unleash a repatriation-by-gunpoint program on these people, either Mexico would close her borders against them.  Or they would be dealt with very punitively upon return.  Because Mexico&rsquo;s &#8216;labor problem&rsquo; is one of too many women in labor.  And not enough jobs to keep her population away from the edge of defacto rebellion.</p>
<p>To win, we must push past all that.  And send them home, regardless.  Knowing what will come.</p>
