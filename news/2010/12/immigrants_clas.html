<h1>Immigrants Clash in Moorhead Fray</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joy Powell, Star Tribune (Minneapolis-St. Paul), December 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At least 20 police officers responded to a melee in Moorhead, Minn., early Sunday that involved up to a dozen young African immigrants fighting not only with hands and feet, but also with a taser, knives, a replica handgun and a shovel.</p>
<p>More than 100 people looked on, many yelling, in the parking lot of a bowling alley on the city&rsquo;s north side, police said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It was the latest eruption in ethnic tension in the Fargo-Moorhead area between young men from the two war-torn African countries of Sudan and Liberia, authorities said.</p>
<p>The hostilities worry cultural leaders in those communities, including Gibson Jerue, a 43-year-old Liberian immigrant from Fargo, N.D. He told of incidents dating to 2008, including one that sent a young Liberian man assaulted in Fargo to the hospital. In the past two months, there have been more incidents, including windows smashed or other damage to Liberian and Sudanese residences, Jerue said.</p>
<p>Now the violence has spread across the Red River to nearby Moorhead. Most, if not all, of those involved Sunday were from Fargo and had immigrated within the past decade, Moorhead Police Lt. Jim Nielsen said.</p>

		<p>Diversity is our strength!</p>
<p>It must be whitey&rsquo;s fault somehow!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just with Africans.  Nearly every latino from every latino nation despises Purto Ricans.  I don&rsquo;t know why.  Then Mexicans and Dominicans hate each other.  Central Americans hate Mexicans, etc.</p>
<p>Asian groups also feud, into the 2nd and 3rd generation even!</p>
<p>So we flood the country with entire populations of people who naturally bring their warlike ways with them, then they begin to fight amongst each other.  How does this make America stronger?</p>
<p>100 years from now, when there are ARMIES of &#8216;diverse&rsquo; groups battling over territory, in what used to be America, what will the few remaining educated people say about these policies in this time?</p>
<p>&#8220;The fools!&#8221;</p>

		<p>What exactly is a &#8220;cultural leader&#8221;? Would that be a tribal chief, a griot, witch doctor, etc? Tribal warfare in Minnesota? All of this is starting to get mind-boggling. The insanity of importing primitives  from the backwaters of the world becomes more apparent every passing day. Third world, coming soon to your area, if it hasn&rsquo;t already.</p>

		<p>Fargo, North Dakota?   Moorehead, Minnesota?&hellip; WHAT?</p>
<p>OMG!  Incredible. Who would have imagined it??? <br/>
This almost surpasses belief.</p>
<p>Well, it should be no surprise.  This is what you get when you import warring peoples who could not get along with their neighbors back home. Is there any reason to think they&rsquo;ll get along any better  with their neighbors here?</p>
<p>(All those agencies that imported them and sponsored them should be held criminally responsible.)</p>

		<p>I shake my head in disbelief at the ignorance of our politicians. I am sad for the loss of America. Still though, I have hope for a future where people will see the fallicy of multiculturalism and move to constitutionalize the ethno-centric State.  Granted, having such nations would mean the end of the United States, but hopefully we will be able to do this peacefully, and thus avoid the mass bloodshed that often accompanies such national breakups.</p>

		<p>Can&rsquo;t wait until the Liberians start emulating the &#8220;Buck Naked Brigade&#8221; like their cohorts from the Liberian civil war. Why are these people even here again and who let them in? </p>

		<p> Almost forty years ago I had some academic business in Moorhead Minnesota back then it was one of the nicest, safest, cleanest, politest and whitest towns imaginable. Most of the people I met were of Norwegian, Swedish or German descent. This year around the most blessed time of the year there is a melee of African immigrants in the middle of Morehead that required twenty police (maybe their entire force) to contain. I can&rsquo;t think of a better example of the unintended consequences of the &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; our social engineering liberals so fervently push on the rest of us. </p>

Where Africans are, Africa is.</p>
<p>The only amazing thing about this is that anyone involved in bringing these people over never believed something like this would happen.</p>
<p>African-Africans attacking each other in America? Never!</p>

		<p>&#8216;Cultural leader&rsquo; and important talks with &#8216;community leaders&rsquo; is a form of media-speak. Is there any doubt these are people of color? They&rsquo;re are being rewarded and praised for their racism. And it&rsquo;s about reminded everyone people of color are above whites. When it comes to whites, even those on the national scene, they don&rsquo;t have talks and negotiation, they&rsquo;re just labelled racist.</p>
