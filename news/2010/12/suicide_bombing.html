<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-world-europe/20101215/EU.Sweden.Terror/">Suicide Bombing Stirs Sweden&rsquo;s Far-Right</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Karl Ritter, Comcast News, Dec. 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The government and just about every editorial page has warned against blaming Sweden&rsquo;s growing Muslim minority for the Dec. 11 suicide attack carried out by an Iraqi-born Swede, who appears to have been radicalized in Britain.</p>
<p>But the far-right fringe is doing just that in another challenge to Sweden&rsquo;s famed tolerance, already frayed in recent months by the Sweden Democrats&rsquo; entry into Parliament and a serial gunman&rsquo;s sniper attacks against people with dark skin.</p>
<p>Authorities say there&rsquo;s a risk that even more extreme groups, long marginalized in Sweden, will use the opportunity to advance their positions.</p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest worry isn&rsquo;t that the Muslim community will become radicalized but what this means for the view of Muslims in Sweden,&#8221; said Erik Akerlund, police chief in Rinkeby, an immigrant suburb of Stockholm nicknamed &#8220;Little Mogadishu&#8221; because of its large Somali community.</p>
<p>While investigating the attack, the Swedish security service is also keeping an eye on any potential reaction from right-wing extremists, said Anders Thornberg, the agency&rsquo;s director of operations. Those groups have kept a low profile since a series of attacks on immigrants and left-wing activists in the 1980s and &rsquo;90s.</p>
<p>The suicide bomber, Taimour Abdulwahab, killed himself and injured two people when some of the explosives he was wearing exploded among panicked Christmas shoppers in downtown Stockholm.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people from the Middle East, Somalia and the Balkans have fled to Sweden in the past two decades. No Western country admitted more Iraqi refugees amid the bloodshed following the U.S.-led invasion in 2003.</p>
<p>Integration is slow. Immigrants are clustered in suburbs of the big cities where few ethnic Swedes ever set foot. Surrounded by countrymen and other immigrants, many in those neighborhoods struggle to learn the Swedish language and to enter the job market.</p>
<p>A survey of 9,000 people by the SOM institute at Goteborg University earlier this year showed more than one-third of Swedes believe the country has admitted too many immigrants. Still, criticism of the immigration policy was rare until the Sweden Democrats broke through onto the national stage this year, winning nearly 6 percent of votes in the Sept. 19 election.</p>
<p>Hours after the bombing, Sweden Democrats lawmaker William Petzall wrote &#8220;I hate to say it, but we told you so,&#8221; on his Twitter account.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this the time when you&rsquo;re allowed to say: &#8216;I told you so&rsquo;? finally,&#8221; said another tweet from party leader Jimmie Akesson&rsquo;s secretary, Alexandra Brunell. She later apologized, saying the wording was unfortunate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This becomes a very clear example for them to point to and say &#8216;This is what will happen if we don&rsquo;t stop immigration,&rsquo;&#8221; Poohl said.</p>
<p>Leaders of Sweden&rsquo;s estimated 300,000 Muslims were worried about a backlash. The head of an Islamic Center in the southern city of Malmo, Bejzat Becirov, said he received hate mail on Thursday that he is handing over to police.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A terror attack does not necessarily trigger a backlash against Muslims. No such effect was seen in Spain in 2004 or in Britain in 2005 after terror attacks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Analysts say it&rsquo;s too early to say which direction Sweden will take.</p>
<p>Those hostile to Muslims and immigrants &#8220;are likely to advance their positions after what happened,&#8221; said Helene Loow, a Uppsala University expert on Sweden&rsquo;s extreme-right. &#8220;But the effects of this will only be visible in the long term.&#8221;</p>

		<p>When I see the identification, &#8220;Iraqi-born Swede,&#8221; in this article, my blood boils.  My paternal grandfather was born in Sweden and when I talked to Swedes during my last visit to Sweden and asked them if it would be easy for me to move to Sweden, they laughed and said, &#8220;Are you kidding? A white American?&#8221;  Then, I appply to an NEH program devised by the US government for American students to study law in London and Amsterdam this summer, and they sent back a rejection letter telling me basically that I am not representative of an American because I am not a minority.  Why do I suddenly have no country, but if I were a Muslim terrorists, I&rsquo;d be welcomed with open arms into nations that are traditionally European? </p>

Well, if they have to struggle so bad to just learn the language, and can&rsquo;t seem to get a job, one might be tempted to conclude that those people just do not belong there, in Sweden. Or am I an evil racist for thinking so?</p>

<p>Let the back peddaling and groveling begin. Swedanistan sort of has a ring to it, like Michiganistan. The only backlash 300,000 muslims are worried about is if it happens before there are 2.2 million muslims in Sweden and they are ready to take over the country with a full frontal assault!</p>

		<p>The Sweden Democrats are basically neocons with a cultural nationalist spin. They deny the existence of race as well as the existence of a swedish people sharing a common heritage. Swedishness as defined by them are just a matter of values or customs, if you can do this and that, you are swedish.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Swedishness is not in your skin color or in any part of the body. It&rsquo;s in your values and how you behave,&#8221; Akesson said.&#8221;</p>

		<p>As usual the opponents of mass immigration are deemed more dangerous by the establishment than the actual terrorists.</p>
<p>There are two things we can do that together would actually stop terrorism:</p>
<p>1. Close the borders and deport those immigrants who promote a radical anti-American agenda   &mdash;   whether they&rsquo;re members of an extremist mosque or MEChA.</p>
<p>2.  Get out of those stupid foreign wars and bring the troops home.  My proposal is this:  We don&rsquo;t let the Somalis come here and tell us how to live, we don&rsquo;t go to Somalia to tell them how to live.</p>
<p>These are the two things our political masters will never, ever do.  What they will do is take away more and more of our traditional freedoms in the name of the &#8220;War on Terror&#8221;.<br>

		<p>It is ironic if the &#8220;far right&#8221; needs to preserve Swedish Social Democracy. Social Democracy only works in countries where the vast majority of the country is of European descent.  <br>

Paul Krugman put it best when he wrote, &#8220;open immigration can&rsquo;t coexist with a strong social safety net; if you&rsquo;re going to assure health care and a decent income to everyone, you can&rsquo;t make that offer global.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Some of the problem here is that Swedes have lived in a bubble for so long.  Their prior contact with third world populace has been the stage shows of ANC reps who told liberal Swedes what they want to hear, and the fluff shows of NGOs soliciting money for Africa.  </p>
<p>Now the Swedes are facing the third world imported into their own cities and they can not quite grasp the magnitude of the issue. (Of course, one can feel some smug satisfaction in that this is payback for Swedish support of the ANC.)</p>
<p>Now, it is not quite fair to blame the Muslim community as a whole for this single act.  The real problem is not so much terrorism, but the vast cultural and political changes required to assimilate third worlders.  Swedes are trying to apply the same old liberal formulae, but they do not quite seem to be working.  What happens when the clash of cultures gets to a critical point?  </p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s become much like the relationship between the Church and State in the Middle Ages. One supported the other in order to keep the populace in line. It was a close alliance.</p>
<p>Today,in this secular age, the media have largely replaced the church as a instrument for controlling the minds of the population. But they still work hand-in-hand with the state. It remains an alliance.</p>
<p>And isn&rsquo;t it nice that they&rsquo;re so concerned about any &#8220;anti-Moslem backlash&#8221;?  (With no similar concern for the native population!)</p>
<p>This was exactly the same in the USA immediately after 9/11&hellip;  Our government was more worried about THE MOSLEMS than about the Americans!  Pres. Bush gave speeches about &#8220;the religion of peace&#8221; and warned us against anti-Moslem feelings. And in the Netherlands after the murder of Pym  Fortuyn, and then Van Gogh, there was great solicitude shown for THE MOSLEMS(!), with visits from the Queen to mosques to express sympathy!  The same thing occurred in England and in Spain after the terrorists blew up trains full of people. It was a similar response in ALL of these cases.  Can this remarkably uniform reaction be a mere coincidence?  It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s being coordinated somewhere. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, anyone who disagrees is denounced as an &#8220;extremist&#8221; or &#8220;hater&#8221;.  Such a person faces fines and prison sentences!   Forgive me, but I would think you are entitled to &#8220;hate&#8221; someone who who blows up trains and skyscrapers full of innocent people (or the religion that motivates them), someone who comes into your country and is dedicated to blowing you up! </p>
<p>In such a circumstance, isn&rsquo;t &#8220;hate&#8221; a perfectly normal reaction?  I would call it a healthy survival instinct; but our elites seem not to be concerned with our survival. We are the old population, destined for replacement. We are not supposed to resist.  Resistance is wicked!</p>

		<p>A lot of Swedes are concerned that the right will become radicalized en masse.  Their ultimate worry is that the state will stop buttering their bread.  Muslim immigrants are just a means to that end.  Some lone white terrorist is really the least of their worries.  </p>

<p>Yes I am sure he said that and that the context is correct. Tha&rsquo;ts precisely what he and other party members have said in press communiques released in Swedish or have written on their blogs. The funny thing is that 95% of the people who voted for the Sweden Democrats believe they are a racist Nazi style party because that is what the tabloid leftist media portrays them as. They aren&rsquo;t. They are cultural nationalists, assimilatists who believe that anyone can become Swedish if he &#8220;assimilates&#8221; some undefined Swedish values or customs. Practically this means the mestisofication of the Swedish people because mestisofication is the ultimate form of assimilation.</p>

The Sweden Democrats are also hardcore prosionists just like Geert Wilders and his Peoples party. I am surprised they haven&rsquo;t called for the bombing of Iran yet. They have no underlying thought foundation for their party, their attitude is that &#8220;anything that gives us votes is kosher&#8221;, thus they just copy the rest of their party program from one of the biggest mainstream parties and call it done. They are political entrepreneurs looking for a quick return of invested work, not some kind of nation saving movement of genuinely concerned people. Those who could claim to be that were booted from the Sweden Democrats several years ago - big names like Kenneth Sandberg (who lost his job over his opinions) and Jan Milld (who educates the public on migration issues via his site Blågula frågor). </p>
<p>The Sweden Democrats also expel people who question their official dogma of no racial differences from their party. IMHO, they are scam artists preying on concerned people. The perks of being parliament member (which aren&rsquo;t small) and the huge public fund transfers to parties that pass the 4% limit are their primary goals. There&rsquo;s a lot of cash up for the taking and Jimmie and his boys are gonna get some. </p>

		<p><i>Today,in this secular age, the media have largely replaced the church as a instrument for controlling the minds of the population. But they still work hand-in-hand with the state. It remains an alliance.</i></p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>The media, along with the universities, have become the propaganda instruments of ruling elites.  They provide the agitation (mass based propaganda) via television et alia to keep the general populace in a state of torpor, and the ideological indoctrination to justify the actions of the elites. </p>
<p>Anyone who wants to liberate themself must break with the mass media. There is also a need to create alternative media. We can see some progress along these lines with the Internet. </p>

<p>Hooray for the Internet! It&rsquo;s the reason why newspapers, a/k/a Old Media, are slowly going into the sunset.</p>
<p>Obama raised hundreds of millions of dollars using the Internet. Now, he wants to CONTROL it, purportedly to &#8220;fight terrorism&#8221;. Remember when that British MP was stabbed by that Muslim woman who said she was &#8220;inspired&#8221; by a Muslim website? The British government went to Obama asking him to erase the website, because it originated in the USA.</p>
<p>Control of the Internet, whether by American, foreign or international government (i.e., the U.N.) will spark unrest like the world has never seen.</p>

<p>The same thing can be said about many of these patriotic parties in Europe. The FPÖ, the Swiss People&rsquo;s Party, etc. There are good people among them, no doubt, but pretty much all echo the same &#8220;doesn&rsquo;t matter where they&rsquo;re from, as long as they pay taxes, learn the language, and fit in&#8221; line. Being anti-Islam is all they are often really about. They also do not stand firm in many issues, and rather use the tactic of touching on senstive issues, then when the media storm follows they back away to a more defensible position, get the publicity but don&rsquo;t really convince many people they&rsquo;ve made a stand on anything. <br>
That&rsquo;s where the left routinely says only the &#8220;dumb&#8221; people fall for it, and when the critics say they don&rsquo;t actually have any ideas or standpoints of their own, they are often right. </p>
<p>On the other hand though I think we&rsquo;ve seen with the BNP that when a party really does try to adopt a racialist stance, how difficult it is for them. Lawsuits, media blackouts, the works. I&rsquo;m not entirely convinced the SD/FPÖ etc approach can&rsquo;t work in the long run, I suppose it just depends on the people involved and whether there is a long-term goal to expand the agenda once in a better position to do so.</p>

<p>Yup.  Sounds pretty much like the Tea Parties here. Same thing. Geert Wilders too.  A nice, safe tiger without claws.  </p>
<p>It draws in the rightists, without giving them anything, except false hopes.</p>
<p>And being anti-Islam always helps. The neo-cons love that. Just don&rsquo;t stir the pot too much! They don&rsquo;t want it boiling over.</p>

		<p>So what&rsquo;s the Swedish People&rsquo;s extent of rights as far as suing the government/replacing the government?</p>
<p>Can those two &#8216;injured&rsquo; parties (show the photographs of what a suicide vest does, flense, mutilate, destroy come to mind) make such a stink that some form of required &#8216;standard&rsquo; is even enforced?</p>
<p>Can the Swedish Government itself demand that Britain outlaw the terrorist group which &#8216;radicalized&rsquo; this man?</p>
<p>I realize that there is nothing, ultimately, to be done within the court systems ruled by those who seek our very demise as a people.  BUT.  There is something to be said for raising the public awareness of what is at stake here and making people realize, at a personal level, what it means to be the victims of Islam and unwanted Immigration.</p>

		<p>Poster (Michael) #27 - Precisely. They arent interested in undoing the changes of the 68 generation because that would deprieve their party of their chief profile question. They just want to make noise, get free publicity in the press, get the votes of dissatisfied people and have a good time cruising on the public coffers. </p>
<p>In fact, its impossible for them to challenge the 68 generation because their party&rsquo;s values are based on cultural marxism. As I wrote in my earlier post, the Sweden Democrats define the swedish people purely in sociocultural terms. They do not challenge the cultural marxist establishment with a different (and more accurate) description of reality and are thus unable to derail them. </p>
<p>The only swedish party that does not have a trace of cultural marxism in its party program is the tiny Svenskarnas Parti (The swedes party), which is a descendant of former national socialistic front (!) The rot is so strong that even the &#8220;hard core&#8221; national democrats are infested by cultural marxism in the form of their meta-egalitarian etnopluralistic ideology. </p>

<p>Sad. But given the monopolistic stranglehold that the Left has had on Swedish politics for most of the past century, I suppose that result is understandable, because that is all they have ever known. It&rsquo;s all they  have heard. Swedes have been brainwased all their lives with it.  Expecting anything else would be like asking them to speak in a language they do not know. Quite impossible!</p>

<p>The controlled opposition is <i>allowed </i> to exist.   (True opposition is not.)  They are not loved, but they are tolerated. They serve a purpose. They draw off excess steam   &mdash;   like the valve that keeps the pressure cooker from exploding.   We see the same thing in the US.</p>
<p>To paraphrase Lenin, the best way to control the opposition is to BE the opposition.  Exactly! They have learned their lesson well.</p>
<p>Incidentally, that anti-Islam thing is one of the marks that often give them away (not always).  I am certainly not pro-Islam, nor any apologist for it, and I don&rsquo;t welcome it in the West where it is alien to our traditions, but I don&rsquo;t think it is the root of all our problems either. It is JUST ONE  of our problems.  A very serious problem, but just one. Even without Muslims, the West is dying. It is being poisoned from many sources.<br>
 <br>
The moribund West is like a gravely ill patient who is dying of multiple causes, and all they can address is the gangrene in his toe, while dismissing all the other maladies as just silly worries not worthy of attention. They are irrelevant. We are counseled to adjust, adapt, and get used to these minor irritations. It is up to us to make the effort.</p>
<p>These are the &#8220;physicians&#8221; who offer to cure us?<br>

		<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s become much like the relationship between the Church and State in the Middle Ages. One supported the other in order to keep the populace in line. It was a close alliance.&#8221;</p>
<p>ghw, how DARE you make such a fallacious comparison. The concept of symphonia, or church-state inter-connectedness, was NORMATIVE in ALL of Christendom (i.e.e, Europe) because there IS no such thing as RELIGIOUS Neutrality.</p>
<p>At least during the Church&rsquo;s heyday in Europe, before the &#8216;doctrine of the brotherhood of man&rsquo; (a liberal, antichristian construct, which first appeared after the French Revolution, and was given voice by Beethoven&rsquo;s WORST symphony, the 9th) Europe was homogenous, racially pure, and cultural consistent.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say that for the legacy of liberalism, the Jacobin Jawing of &#8216;tolerance and diversity&rsquo; and the Marxist mantra of multicuturalism.</p>
<p>Where is the &#8216;sin&rsquo; today? clearly, in the lap of the anti-theistic element. The pigeons have come home to roost.</p>
