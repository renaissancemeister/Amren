<h1>Let the Non-Whites Take Over</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jared Taylor and John Harrison Sims, <font color="red">Special to AR News,</font> December 17, 2010</font></i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Frank Rich, columnist for the <cite>New York Times,</cite> can&rsquo;t wait for whites to become a minority. One reason is that he doesn&rsquo;t like the way they vote, and when there are fewer whites around, the country will finally be run by the &#8220;wise Latinas&#8221; and &#8220;Civil Rights heroes&#8221; he thinks ought to be in charge. But the more you read Frank Rich, the more you begin to realize that he just doesn&rsquo;t like white people, and he is happy to think they are glimmering away. A columnist for the <cite>New York Times</cite> would never propose anything so crude as ethnic cleansing, but that is where Mr. Rich&rsquo;s animus for whites logically leads.</p>
<p>Here is typical Rich about politics and that group he takes such pleasure in calling &#8220;a dwindling and threatened minority:&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The conjunction of a black president and female speaker of the House  &mdash;  topped off by a wise Latina on the Supreme Court and a powerful gay Congressional committee chairman  &mdash;  would sow fears of disenfranchisement among a dwindling and threatened minority in the country no matter what policies were in play.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;When you hear demonstrators chant the slogan &#8216;Take our country back!&rsquo; these are the people [non-whites and homosexuals] they want to take the country back from. They can&rsquo;t.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The <cite>Times</cite> reported that births to Asian, black and Hispanic women accounted for 48 percent of all births in America in the 12 months ending in July 2008. By 2012, the next presidential election year, non-Hispanic white births will be in the minority. The Tea Party movement is virtually all white. The Republicans haven&rsquo;t had a single African-American in the Senate or the House since 2003 and have had only three in total since 1935. Their anxieties about a rapidly changing America are well-grounded.&#8221; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/28/opinion/28rich.html" target="rage">[The Rage is Not About Health Care]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Rich despises the Tea Party movement, of course but since it &#8220;resides in the aging white base of the Republican Party,&#8221; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/23/opinion/23rich.html" target="randslide">[The &#8216;Randslide&rsquo; and Its Discontents]</a> it is not a long-term threat.</p>
<p>The same, thank heavens, is true for another of Mr. Rich&rsquo;s hate figures, Sarah Palin: &#8220;The Palinist &#8216;real America&rsquo; is demographically doomed to keep shrinking.&#8221; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/12/opinion/12rich.html" target="palin">[She Broke the G.O.P. and Now She Owns It]</a> Mr. Rich&rsquo;s real Americans  &mdash;  blacks, Hispanics, Asians  &mdash;  needn&rsquo;t worry because &#8220;the demographic that Palin attracts is in decline; there&rsquo;s no way the math of her fan base adds up to an Electoral College victory [in 2012].&#8221; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/22/opinion/22rich.html" target="pitbull">[The Pit Bull in the China Shop]</a> Republicans in general are dodos-to-be because there is no way to &#8220;avoid reckoning with the doomed demographics of the G.O.P.&rsquo;s old white male base.&#8221; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/15/opinion/15rich.html" target="culture-warriors">[The Culture Warriors Get Laid Off]</a></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more to it than politics, though. It&rsquo;s pretty clear that Mr. Rich just wants us gone, and the sooner the better. This is what he had to say about people who thought President Obama was wrong and perhaps even &#8220;racist&#8221; to say that Sgt. James Crowley had behaved &#8220;stupidly&#8221; when he arrested Prof. Henry Louis Gates in Cambridge in 2009:</p>
<p>&#8220;That reaction is merely the latest example of how the inexorable transformation of America into a white-minority country in some 30 years  &mdash;  by 2042 in the latest Census Bureau estimate  &mdash;  is causing serious jitters, if not panic, in some white establishments.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What provokes their angry and nonsensical cries of racism is sheer desperation: an entire country is changing faster than these white guys bargained for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;America is not post-racial.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [W]e&rsquo;re just at the start of what may be a 30-year struggle. Beer [served by the White House at the subsequent meeting between Sgt. Crowley and Prof. Gates] won&rsquo;t cool the fury of those who can&rsquo;t accept the reality that America&rsquo;s racial profile will no longer reflect their own.&#8221; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/02/opinion/02rich.html" target="beer">[Small Beer, Big Hangover]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Rich can&rsquo;t conceal his glee at the thought of brown people taking over. He wrote this about Sonia Sotomayor&rsquo;s Senate confirmation hearings:</p>
<p>&#8220;[T]his particular wise Latina, with the richness of her experiences, would far more often than not reach a better [judicial] conclusion than the individual white males she faced in that Senate hearing room. Even those viewers who watched the Sotomayor show for only a few minutes could see that her America is our future and theirs is the rapidly receding past.&#8221; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/19/opinion/19rich.html" target="explaining">[They Got Some &rsquo;Splainin&rsquo; to Do]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Rich clearly thinks whites should cheerfully turn over to immigrants the country their ancestors built. Why? Is there something about white Americans that makes them especially deserving of dispossession? Surely not, for that would be &#8220;racist.&#8221; Mr. Rich must therefore think all countries should be up for grabs. </p>
<p>Europeans should no doubt hand their countries over to &#8220;wise Imams.&#8221; And Tibetans should just relax; their grandchildren will <em>enjoy</em> being Chinese. Israelis shouldn&rsquo;t worry about Arab birthrates; being a minority will be fun. Just think: All that unpleasantness could have been avoided if the Hutus had behaved like good white people and let the Tutsis rule them. And since Latinas are so wise, why doesn&rsquo;t Japan import several million of them and let them run the place?</p>
<p>No, Mr. Rich probably doesn&rsquo;t think these things. That would be consistent. He just wants to sweep white people into the dustbin. And his employer, the <cite>New York Times,</cite> seems to think that&rsquo;s just fine.<br/>

<i>Frank Rich, columnist for the New York Times, can&rsquo;t wait for whites to become a minority.</i><br/>
  <br/>
According to the US Census  &mdash;  a white minority could happen as early as next year!</p>
<p>Census Confirms Tea Party&rsquo;s Worst Nightmare</p>
<p><b>The latest Census figures show that the country&rsquo;s white population could become a minority as soon asâ€¦next year.</b></p>
<p>&#8220;No big news, right? We&rsquo;ve been hearing thatfor years. But these latest numbers show that massive geographic shifts are taking place in areas of the country not traditionally thought of as ethnically diverse, like the South and middle America.</p>
<p>According to the Wall Street Journal, the Census reported that babies of color accounted for more than 48 percent of the total amount of children born between July of 2008 and 2009. Even though a tough economy and harsher immigration policies have slowed the number of babies of color being born in recent years, they&rsquo;re still more of them arriving in the world than whites. Among Latinos, there were roughly nine births for every one death, while whites had a one-to-one ratio. Similarly, whites are having fewer children and, by marrying more interracially, are having more multiracial kids.</p>
<p>While people of color have already been majorities in states like Texas and California, other states, like North Carolina, are quickly entering the fray. In Charlotte and surrounding Mecklenburg County, whites are just more than 50 percent of the population. Thirty years ago it was slightly more than 70 percent. And as proof, there&rsquo;s a statue of Ghandi in front of the town courthouse.&#8221;</p>

For those interested, a short bio on Mr. Rich:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/385/000063196/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nndb.com/people/385/000063196/</a></p>
<p>Mr. Rich must be reading the works of Mr. Wise.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;What provokes their angry and nonsensical cries of racism is sheer desperation: an entire country is changing faster than these white guys bargained for.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Does Mr. Rich not see himself as white? Or does he divide whites into good whites and bad whites? Does he have a litmus test?</p>
<p>Whatever glorious future Mr. Rich envisions isn&rsquo;t going to play-out the way he imagines. Blacks and Hispanics define themselves as THE victim. That can&rsquo;t both claim that title. They will, however, fight for naming rights. First they will fight whites, then they will fight each other.</p>
<p>When they demand too much and are too busy fighting each other, whites will fight back. When the Constitution is re-written either literally or figuratively through court rulings, whites will take back their country.<br/>

		<p>Mr. Rich, with all due respect, what you speak of is not the changing of America, but rather the ending. You hold a lie close to your heart that the only ones who fear a non-white nation are angry religious conservative white men, but what you fail (or refuse) to see is that many racially consiousce whites are women, gay, non-religious, and urban. </p>
<p>You speak of the Supreme Court, judges, the House, the President, all things that Americans (Euro-Americans) invented and created. When I see people like Sotamayor, I do not see a dignified Supreme Court Judge, I see someone trying to copy another&rsquo;s culture and institutions. She herself has spoken of her loyalty to Latinos, so my question is, does she consider herself American or Latino first? </p>
<p>Also, Mr. Rich, cheering on the decline of the native populace due to its differing political views is not only cowardice, but wrong. I do not agree on many points with the white masses, but I would never attack my own people because of it. You can&rsquo;t just turn your back and abandon a population because they don&rsquo;t agree with your political beliefs. It takes a strong person to be mature enough to accept the fact that others have differing political views without longing for their demise, a weakling would do everything for their political enemy&rsquo;s decline and cheer each blow. </p>
<p>And, Mr. Rich you praise the decline of your own people, yet do you ever sit and ponder the future of your very position without the many white readers? If you believe these brown masses are going to like you just because you hate your own race than you are heavily mistaken. You can pick sides now, but in the end we are all going to the same place Mr. Rich.</p>
<p>Never has a man written so joyfully about his own security being picked away, it is about as insane as a King cheering on his enemies as they dismantle his castle brick by brick. <br/>

		<p>Rich is just a predictable smug liberal who fantasizes about his &#8220;progressive&#8221; brown comrades taking power from evil whites.  Like most leftists his grand ideas and fantasies are far removed from reality.  The reality of a majority Mesitzo and black society is widespread corruption, crime and anarchy.  Rich knows this but his hatred of sensible whites overrides his common sense. </p>

<p>These guys all like the idea of whitey getting his &#8220;just due&#8221;, whatever that is.</p>
<p>Ted the &#8220;Unabomber&#8221; in his manifesto had it right. The left in the U.S. has a sick mentality. Look at their forms of protest. Lay down in front of vehicles and dare you to run them over, goad police to beat them, etc. Masochistic persons who want to beaten and mistreated. </p>
<p>AND if they had it their way, we ALL would be.</p>

		<p>U. S. immigration policy   &mdash;  - with its several daggers aimed the heart of the historic (white) American nation   &mdash;  - is the major weapon the news media and academia have in their quest to destroy white America:</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Plyler v. Doe, the 1982 5-to-4 Supreme Court decision forcing states to take the property of American citizens   &mdash;  - in the form of taxes   &mdash;  - to pay for the K-12 schooling of children brought illegally to the United States.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s &#8220;automatic birthright citizenship&#8221; for children born to illegal aliens in the U. S.  380,000 children per year are born to illegal aliens in the U. S. </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the 1965 Immigration Act which adds about 1 million legal immigrants annually   &mdash;  - mainly from Latin America but secondarily from Asia.  This is through the act&rsquo;s &#8220;family reunification&#8221; (chain migration) provisions.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the 1994 nullification of California&rsquo;s Proposition 187.  Prop 187 would have denied services to illegal aliens in California.  Prop 187, approved by 59 percent of California voters, was blocked by a single Jimmy Carter-appointed federal Judge, Marianna Pfaelzer. California&rsquo;s appeal was derailed by then incoming Democratic Party governor Gray Davis.</p>
<p>There have been several amnesties   &mdash;  - the small ones being the grant of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to foreigners in due to some crisis their native lands.  The status generally becomes permanent.  There is the biggest amnesty so far, the 1986 &#8220;one-time-only&#8221; amnesty offer to some 3 million illegal aliens, who subsequently brought their families.</p>
<p>There is a refugee policy that takes in about 80,000 people per year from all over the world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the truly insane &#8220;Diversity Lottery&#8221;.  50,000 foreigners from all around the worly apply to enter on a lottery basis</p>
<p>The George Bush administration got banks involved in 2002. The Bush Treasury Department issued a directive informing banks that the Mexican &#8220;matricular consular&#8221; cards, used almost exclusively by illegal aliens   &mdash;  - however untrustworthy according to the FBI   &mdash;  - were acceptable identification for opening U. S. bank accounts and therefore taking out a mortgages.</p>
<p>Frank Rich and the New York Times have good reason to be gleeful.  But they have still more to celebrate.</p>
<p>There American government schooling monopolies, highly successful at producing mass ignorance. Their monopoly structures dictate that result   &mdash;  - as does the rock-bottom GRE[Graduate Record Examination] scores of their personnel.  </p>
<p>See the WSJ piece:&ldquo;Dismal GRE Statistics for Education Fields,&rdquo; July 25, 2007 <br/>
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/2fjcls9" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2fjcls9</a></p>
<p>As a bonus to the NYT crowd, our government schools are heavily anti-white in orientation.  One example: NYU research professor Diane Ravitch&rsquo;s describes the &#8220;sensitiity and bias&#8221; guidelines of textbook publishing giant McGraw-Hill: <br/>
 <br/>
&ldquo;The MH [McGraw-Hill] guidelines express barely concealed rage against people of European ancestry. They deride European Americans for exploiting slaves, migrant workers, and factory labor; they excoriate the land rapacity of the pioneers and mock their so-called courage in fighting Native Americans: &lsquo;Bigots and Bigotry,&rsquo; say the guidelines, referring to European Americans, &lsquo;must be identified and discussed.&rsquo; European Americans, the guidelines suggest, were uniquely responsible for bigotry and exploitation in all human history &hellip;&rdquo; (THE LANGUAGE POLICE, p. 44) </p>
<p>ALL major &#8220;education&#8221; publishers must use elaborate bias guidelines to pre-censor textbooks the hope to market to the government systes or else risk losing a multi-million dollar sale to a big state due to a protests by an ethnocentric pressure group.</p>
<p>All in all, Rich, the New York Times, the major media and academia can look forward with relish to an America with a &#8220;dwindling and threatened&#8221; white minority.</p>

		<p>Mr Rich is obviously a talented and well connected jounalist. He is lucky that he lives in a country that has rule of law, a high standard of living and a country that allows him to publish what he writes.</p>
<p>The new look America (Or Canada, UK Australia) that Mr Rich is so enthusiastic about will destroy just about everything he enjoys now. We enjoy a culture unique in this world, it should be preserved.</p>
<p>If his NYT still exists after the Mexican take-over will Mr Rich still have a job or would they just employ just their own kind? If Mr Rich was starting off now, would he be disappointed that he might be pushed aside for AA  trainee jounalist?</p>
<p>Is he not concerned that his favourite and PC President is now printing money 3rd world style? </p>
<p>I assume Mr Rich is well travelled. Can he cite any genuinely successful multicultural nation, perhaps he can truthfully tell of his experiences. Can he even cite any successful multicult/race suburbs in the USA?</p>
<p>Has he had anything to say about the tension and almost open hostility betweem blacks and hispanics in the USA?</p>
<p>He mentions acceptance of homosexuality. That will cease as soon as Islamic Law takes hold.</p>
<p>He seems to like having minorities in the justice system. Yes when ethnic minorities get to rule, a white person can be expected to be crucified just for a parking violation while &#8220;brown&#8221; criminals will get away with murder OJ Simpson style.</p>
<p>Wake Up USA and The Rest of The West. We must hold on to what we have.</p>
<p>PS. As for the Tea Party, even the name sounds mildly effeminate, a bit like a childrens afternoon tea with lots of cream cakes.<br/>
They need a more agressive name, eg BOSTON STRIKES BACK! or BOSTON II. I am sure someone else out there must be able to come up with something more suitable.</p>

		<p>In the current age people wonder how to classify these positions of Mr. Frank Rich and people similar to him.  It seems so strange coming from someone in &hellip; America?  In fact, what we are seeing is an old adversary, essentially modern age Bolsheviks who wish to eliminate the conservative peoples from this and every nation.  We to them are the Kulaks, the White Russians, and the counter-revolutionaries etc. who must be liquidated.  </p>
<p>Instead of firing squads and starvation the left is now using demographic warfare against the white population.  The old Bolsheviks justified their positions in terms of ending oppression and achieving equality.   And so do the new ones.  </p>
<p>They are the same people.<br/>

		<p><i>And since Latinas are so wise, why doesn&rsquo;t Japan import several million of them and let them run the place?</i></p>
<p>Best laugh-out-loud line of the whole article!</p>
<p>Looking at his biography, I see that this Frank Rich was a founding editor of The Richmond (Va.) Mercury, a weekly newspaper, in the early 1970s.</p>
<p>Hmmm, Richmond Va&hellip;.not exactly the most Hispanic area of the United States. But let&rsquo;s assume that Mr. Rich has had an epiphany since he now lives in Manhattan (I wonder what is the racial makeup of his apartment building?)</p>
<p>I find that most liberals think living among a token number of minorities   &mdash;  maybe one or two, as long as one of the two is Asian, is perfectly enough to prove they aren&rsquo;t &#8220;racist.&#8221; They only demand that other whites live as a minority. This is classism and elitism at it&rsquo;s very finest, folks. (Of course racism is the only &#8220;ism&#8221; that is truly unacceptable to these types.)</p>
<p>And when he retires, where do you think it will be to?  Will it be to Detroit or to a 90% Hispanic city so he can revel in all the &#8220;diversity?&#8221; Or will it be to a 90% white neighborhood like virtually every other well-heeled liberal? 20 points and a cigar for the right answer.</p>

		<p>Mr. Rich is whistling past his own graveyard. The institution that is rapidly approaching extinction is the daily broadsheet newspaper&hellip; like the New York Times. </p>
<p>Long before whites are a minority, the Times will have expired long before printing the last white man&rsquo;s obituary. </p>

		<p>Very often (not always, but more often than sometimes), knowing something about a person&rsquo;s background, education, upbringing, etc., will help explain &#8220;where he&rsquo;s coming from&#8221; politically and philosophically. Knowing that can help dispel the mysteries of how a person can appear to be against the wellbeing of his own self and the future his own people. </p>
<p>I thank sbuffalonative for that revealing link!  That indeed does explain a lot about Frank Rich&rsquo;s mental orientation on this matter.  I had already guessed as much. It seems clear that he (in his own mind) does not particularly identify with whites or care about whites.  Another Tim Wise!  &mdash;   as some others here have already commented.  No matter how &#8220;white&#8221; a person may appear to be to the casual observer, if he doe not see HIMSELF as white (or whatever word you want to use), that&rsquo;s what matters. It&rsquo;s not how YOU see him; it&rsquo;s how he sees HIMSELF.  Rich (like Wise) obviously doesn&rsquo;t see himself as one of you. They both hate you, and they&rsquo;re both laughing at your dispossession.</p>

		<p>Hey, Frank, If you want to live in a third world country, then why don&rsquo;t you just move to one instead of doing your best to turn the U.S. into one. That way, after you figure out through first hand experience that the Blacks and Browns lack the cognitive ability to run a successful nation you will still have a civilized place to which you can return.</p>

		<p>I just had lunch with my cousins today, where one cousin&rsquo;s wife is expecting her fourth child, and the other cousin&rsquo;s wife is expecting her second child. They are all blond and blue eyed, and plan to have more children. </p>
<p>Now, a few days ago, I spoke with a man who just celebrated having his 12th grandchild. </p>
<p>And while at a Christmas Tree lighting, my wife and I saw two families next to us, that had four children each, ranging in age from a few months, to about eight years old. </p>
<p>Everywhere I look, I am happy to state that I see young mid 20s and 30 years old couples having at least three for four children. This is the norm, not the exception, which is refreshing. Apparently, my generation, and those behind me are doing what is needed to maintain who we are.</p>
<p>Now what needs to be done, is to round up the 20 million or so Illegal Aliens, most of which are brown or Black and deport them as soon as possible. Then take a new head count of which Race is the dominant one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that Whites aren&rsquo;t having babies, but we are being flooded with a horde of unwashed, uneducated, and uncivilized Barbarians, that we seem to be overwhelmed with their numbers.</p>

For the &#8220;right kind&#8221; of White person no unhappy endings are possible, so no matter.  </p>
<p>Rich is an especially lucky White person.  You see he&rsquo;s White when he feels like, but Jewish when he doesn&rsquo;t.  Just like the South African Jews fulminating against apartheid when their liberal &#8220;diversity is our strength&#8221; mantra got implemented in real life, their skin color became their uniform and Walking While White became too dangerous, they always had the safety of Israel to duck into.</p>

<p>Sarah Palin???? Get real.  So the real America is made up of people with questionable ancestry who marry half breed Eskimos and produce mixed race children?  I don&rsquo;t think so.  I can only hope that this demographic keeps shrinking.  I don&rsquo;t claim to know much about psychological propaganda but I think the main reason for this tirade against White America is to disguise a clever little goad into getting the ignorant masses to vote for Sarah Palin.  They&rsquo;ve tried attacking her, then her family, then they put her daugther on &#8220;Dancing With the Stars&#8221; and then the whole family in a lame reality show.  It looks to me like they&rsquo;re trying to steer people towards her.  There&rsquo;s a very good chance that the people will be able to elect someone who doesn&rsquo;t represent the elite interests.

<p>Yes,he does.  This is a White liberal characteristic   &mdash;   they see White people in terms of Ignorant Unenlightened Evil Redneck Racist Haters versus Sensitive Understanding Compassionate Intelligent apostles of Love.  They place themselves in the latter group, of course, and every other White who doesn&rsquo;t wholeheartedly embrace the Diversicrat agenda in the former.</p>
<p>The media are complicit in this, of course.  They encourage White people to believe that accepting Multiculturalism is a sure sign of intelligence and compassion.  At the same time, White racial realism is painted in broad strokes of ignorance, narrow-mindedness and   &mdash;   most heinous of all   &mdash;   Age.  Diversity-lovers are young, carefree, bright and hip, while holdouts are Old Farts, bitterly clinging to outdated and irrational hatreds.</p>
<p>Very few Whites have the intellectual self-confidence to resist this conditioning.  They prefer to see themselves as part of the Enlightened Elite, rather than be shunned by their friends as gnarled malcontents.</p>
<p>Combating these highly effective media propaganda stereotypes is probably our biggest challenge.</p>

<p>You mention &#8220;Mexican takeover&#8221; vis-a-vis Mr. Rich and the New York Times.  You may or may not be aware how apt is that comment   &mdash;   The NYT has been experiencing money troubles, and its sugar daddy for at least two bailouts has been Mexican multi billionaire Carlos Slim, who made his fortune piggybacking on the Mexican state-enforced cell phone monopoly.  Slim wants an open U.S.-Mexico border for the same reason all the white-ish Mexican elite wants it, and of course good little poodles like Rich will poodle along with the &#8220;hooray for white racial dispossession&#8221; line, partly because he actually believes it, but mostly to please his boss.</p>

		<p>Social Democracy only seems to work in countries where nearly everyone is white.  I doubt it can survive in those countries unless Third World immigration is curtailed.<br/>
 <br/>
White liberals, who look forward to the time when their race is in the minority, need to consider that blacks and Hispanics in the United States frequently hate each other, while resenting the success of East Asians. The Democrats should not assume that they can unite these contending races into a majority coalition.  <br/>
 <br/>
The loss of the white working class as a constituency has crippled the Democratic Party and made it difficult for it to exploit the fact that blue collar incomes have been in general decline for at least a generation.<br/>
 <br/>
The Democrats need to win back the white working class. They cannot do so by advocating policies that harm white workers economically, like affirmative action and unlimited immigration, while raising the crime rate. The Democrats need to decide whether they want to be the party of working Americans of all races, or the party of races that have had less time to evolve from stone age behavior. <br/>

		<p>The future belongs to the ethnocentrist. Economies sundered by debt and employment crises are not going to seek racial peace or justice for the simple reason that they won&rsquo;t have the resources to do so. Perhaps Mr Rich loves and applauds non-white cultural appurtenances, such as street talk and rap music, although his punctuation and egotism betrays an elitist.<br/>
Anyway, any economist will tell you the Eastern bloc is going to dominate the world by mid-century. The Chinese influence is definitely no-nonsense ethnocentricity; their political system is national socialist. Hard-knuckle times are ahead; flabby liberalism and vague infatuations with the cultures of poverty are going to fade. Poverty and decline will be commonplace in the years to come for us in the USA. Many whites will be permanently poor and browns even more so. No one will celebrate the mundane. They will try to avoid it.<br/>
So, how out of step can a newspaper be?<br/>

		<p>My comment isn&rsquo;t aimed at Frank Rich or the article&rsquo;s authors, but at the 28 posters before me:  What are you going to do about it?</p>
<p>Answer:  More than likely?  Nothing.  Not a darn thing.</p>
<p>I think we understand the problem &hellip; I mean the real problem, don&rsquo;t we?  We also understand who&rsquo;s guilty, who&rsquo;s complicit and who&rsquo;s negligent.</p>
<p>What we don&rsquo;t seem to understand is what we can do to fix it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the answers.  I have barely make a dent inside my own extended family in the last 5 years.  I doubt that 10-15% of my white neighbors are aware of this or are concerned about it.  The Tea Party is probably the most pro-white movement we have right now and maybe we could infiltrate and use it.  But no &hellip; not really.  That&rsquo;s just a fantasy.  It would collapse as soon as the Glenn Becks and Rush Limbaughs started bad-mouthing attempts to make the Tea Partiy a pro-white party.</p>
<p>I think the ONLY fix lies in us &hellip; the 28 + 1 who commented.  Maybe we need to adopt the tactics of multi-level marketing.  If we each pledge to go out in 2011 and recruit &hellip; well, how about 12 STRANGERS &hellip; we&rsquo;d recruit 348.  Add us and we&rsquo;d have 377.  That&rsquo;s a small battalion.</p>
<p>If each recruited 12 STRANGERS in 2012, we&rsquo;d have 4900.  That&rsquo;s a brigade.</p>
<p>If each recruited 12 in 2013, we&rsquo;d have over 60,000.  That&rsquo;s a corps.</p>
<p>And if each recruited 12 in 2014 &hellip; that&rsquo;s 780,000.  That is an army.</p>
<p>What if we started recruiting in 2011 with more than just the 28 + 1 of us?</p>
<p>All politics is local.  We can gain inspiration from the internet, Amren and each other.  But success lies OUT THERE &hellip; in the street &hellip; as it always has.</p>

<p>The &#8220;joys of diversity&#8221;, no.   But he DID have to put up with growing up in gentile, white,  Christian America, explicitly The South (Virginia) in the 1950s, before the civil rights upheavals. It was the very absence of diversity that must have chafed on him and embittered him and alienated him.  </p>
<p>And so, just like the Kennedys&rsquo; resentment of the Boston brahmins who kept aloof  and had their own world, the resentful outsider is finally getting even. He&rsquo;s paying you back for having a society that didn&rsquo;t include him. Maybe you never slighted him purposely, or did him any wrong, but he&rsquo;s bitter nonetheless. And you must pay. How dare you have your own world which he wasn&rsquo;t a part of!</p>
<p>Taking this as a pattern and a prediction for the future, I predict that with the MANY, MANY other exotic &#8220;minorities&#8221; that are flooding in  upon us today  (with the eager applause of those such as Frank Rich), America is in for a future of a vast amount of resentment and &#8220;payback&#8221; from the children of those &#8220;minorities&#8221; when they get in a position to let us have it!</p>
<p>As for Frank Rich and Tim Wise, etc., it seems that their hatred is so great that they care about nothing else. It consumes them!  They are so intent on getting even with the hated Majority (for those imaginary slights) that they are fully willing to sink the very ship they are in &hellip; so long as they can take everyone else down with it. So there!!! (That&rsquo;s their attitude.)</p>
<p>Does this make any sense?  No!  Absolutely not. There is nothing rational about it.</p>
<p>Many people here have asked how this can be. The mystery can only be explained by understanding that this is not a <i>rational  </i>response; it is an <i>emotional</i> response.  These are grown-up children, now in positions of power,  getting even for having felt like like outsiders (as if that was anybody else&rsquo;s fault).  </p>
<p>That is why they are so determined that the hated majority must GO!!!  It doesn&rsquo;t really matter who or what the majority is. It&rsquo;s nothing personal. They would hate ANY majority (except their own).</p>

		<p>A wonderful example of media animosity towards whites is the New York Times&rsquo; spectacularly slanted coverage of the Duke lacrosse rape hoax.  It&rsquo;s an example from which we learn how news organizations shape the news to their liking.  Columnists like Frank Rich are a natural fit.  </p>
<p>Stuart Taylor, a columnist for National Journal, contributing editor for Newsweek, and fellow at the Brookings Institution, worked for the New York Times for eight years, covering legal affairs and the Supreme Court. He co-authored UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT: Political Correctness and the Shameful Injustices of the Duke Lacrosse Rape Case with K.C. Johnson.  In a September 2007 presentation for BookTV.org, Taylor made the following remarks:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;The first New York Times reporter on the case, a fellow named Joe Drape, who covered horse races, but who was doing a very good job on this case actually &hellip; he &hellip; reported Nifong&rsquo;s statements the first couple of days.  They dominated his stories  &mdash;  as they should have, that was the news event.  But then he started talking to the defense lawyers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the defense lawyers told me that Joe Drape called him ten times &hellip; Well, that may be more times than the entire rest of the national media spent calling the defense lawyers combined over the first month of the case &hellip; but Joe Drape at the New York Times did it and he wrote stories reporting the defense theories and reporting them in an open way &hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The defense lawyers &hellip; got together and said this guy is being fair &hellip; Let&rsquo;s give him all of our evidence &hellip; Maybe he&rsquo;ll turn this around with a big story in the New York Times.  </p>
<p>&ldquo;They give him the evidence, wait for the big story.  Joe Drape calls a few days later and says, I&rsquo;m sorry that the story about your evidence isn&rsquo;t going to run.  I&rsquo;m having problems with editors.  Joe Drape&rsquo;s byline disappears &hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A new reporter comes on the case who&rsquo;s much more willing to give the editors what they apparently wanted, which was the same guilt-presuming, don&rsquo;t-bother-us-with-the-defense side that the rest of the national media was doing.  And when I say the rest, I mean USA Today, The Washington Post (although it didn&rsquo;t do much), the Los Angeles Times (although it got better later), all of the major networks &hellip; the Durham Herald-Sun which was shameful throughout, Nancy Grace, who was mind-bogglingly shameful throughout &hellip; </p>
<p>&ldquo;The national news media ignored, largely, the evidence.  For example, when the DNA evidence came out that did what the prosecution said would prove innocence on April 10  &mdash;  I&rsquo;m not talking about the private DNA, but the state DNA &hellip; The New York Times reporter Duff Wilson wrote a little story: Well, the defense says it proves this and that and then he called Peter Neufeld of the Innocence Project, who is a great authority on DNA and quoted him in a way that made it sound like he was saying: Well, this doesn&rsquo;t really prove anything. Not every rape has DNA.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;This struck me as odd so I called Neufeld  &mdash;  through his spokesman at the Innocence Project  &mdash;  and I said, &#8216;Why did he say that? &hellip; Didn&rsquo;t he know the facts of the case, that the woman claimed she was raped for a half an hour by three men, three orifices, no condoms, beating, kicking, strangling  &mdash;  and no DNA?  And you&rsquo;re saying it [no DNA match] doesn&rsquo;t prove anything?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The answer was that Neufeld was told nothing about the facts of the case by the New York Times reporter and so the question basically to Neufeld was: Is it possible that you might some day have a rape that didn&rsquo;t leave DNA evidence?  Well, sure it&rsquo;s possible.  But not this rape.  But Neufeld didn&rsquo;t know that.  And that was not untypical of the way the media covered the story  &mdash;  and for months and months and months they covered it that way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;Newsweek, which had maybe been too credulous at first, to their credit &hellip; [had] the first major piece tearing the cover off of this &hellip; So there were good journalists out there &hellip; But in the face of all this &hellip; The New York Times does its definitive revisiting of the story on August 25 of &lsquo;06  &mdash;  MONTHS after anybody in the media who wanted to look at the evidence realized that it leaned strongly toward no rape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well the New York Times&rsquo; 5600-word article kind of boiled down to: Well, we looked at the evidence and, you know, defense lawyers, they kind of play games &hellip; and then there ARE weaknesses in the case but we think it looks like &hellip; a case you can take to trial. Not a bad case.  It was an astonishingly slanted piece of writing &hellip; It reported a lot of the evidence of the defense, but it minimized them, it put them in a context that suggests: Well, that doesn&rsquo;t really amount to anything, and it took some things as probative of guilt that anyone who knew anything about the case would know perfectly well was not probative of guilt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to say enough critical about their coverage &hellip; After the spectacular expose in open court on December 15 of the prosecution-DNA lab conspiracy to suppress evidence of the multiple male DNA  &mdash;  After that the New York Times finally started saying: Gee, you know, maybe there&rsquo;s a problem here.  But there was a problem long before that.&rdquo;</p>

Very few Whites have the intellectual self-confidence to resist this conditioning. They prefer to see themselves as part of the Enlightened Elite, rather than be shunned by their friends as gnarled malcontents.</p>
<p>- Let me first say that your posts are one of the hand full that I enjoy and respect here at AR. As an enlightened white, your post brought up the unavoidable question. Though I agree with you 110%, What of Darwin? Why do we allow this to happen? At some point, does our civilized western civilized culture end upcausing our own demise? I guess this is the question that all those of us that deal with the acceptance and embrace of &#8216;Darwinism&rsquo; struggle with. If we fail to fight back, does this mean we are not worthy of survival? Someone please answer.</p>

<p><br/>
No doubt he pleases Slim. But that&rsquo;s irrelevant. Do you think he suddenly did a turnabout and changed his whole philosophy?</p>
<p>The simple fact remain that he wrote (and thought) the same way long before Slim got involved with the NYT.</p>

<p>He has no intention of staying here when the US becomes non-White; he well knows how dangerous the US will be by that time for him and others of his ilk.</p>
<p>But that matters little to him; that Whites are a landless, dispossessed, powerless, broke, <b>hunted</b> minority, left for murder and mayhem at the mercy of a non-White majority is what he seeks and desires.</p>
<p>His wealth is probably already off-shored, or well hidden in banks in the land to which he plans to flee.  A land where ONLY others of his kind are allowed to reside, and they&rsquo;re using DNA to keep it that way.</p>

<p>Success lies in money.</p>
<p>Our adversaries, such as White-hating, race-based advocacy groups, anti-free enterprise groups, gun control groups, anti-private property groups, groups engaged in voter fraud and organizations that seek to destroy America&rsquo;s constitution are extremely well funded by the vast resources of the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations, Soros-backed organizations, and the Tides Network.</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/27ny52v</p>
<p>It takes money to keep these sites up and running.  Out in the street, the ADL and SPLC take names, license plate numbers and photos to intimidate their enemies, threaten to shut down businesses that host AmRen and other WN organizations and intimidate individuals with calls to employers</p>

<p>Public donations for our adversaries?</p>
<p><i>ACLU: $76 million (each state also has a branch; for example  the Southern California branch reported $3.5 million in donations).</i></p>
<p>$PLC: $32 million.</p>
<p>Please help by donating whatever you can, these organizations speak for us, they&rsquo;re all we&rsquo;ve got, they&rsquo;re doing a yeoman&rsquo;s job keeping us informed and they do so while taking considerable vitriol and attacks (many of them personal and/or physical) from the media, and government, branded as Hate Groups by the $PLC.</p>
<p>The DREAM Act was defeated today, but for how much longer?  The border remains wide open, illegal and legal immigration continue unabated, and the obama administration is promising to &#8216;step-up&rsquo; the number of refugees accepted from Africa.  The government is hell-bent on controlling the Internet.</p>
<p>What if AmRen, VDare, NumbersUSA, OO were shut down tomorrow and all we had left were the alphabet networks and the likes of the<i> NY Slimes</i>?</p>

		<p>A quote from Jim Goad that I find&hellip;pertinent:</p>
<p>The whole exultant &#8220;I&rsquo;m on the right side of the historical tide&#8221; nyah-nyah tone of his screed [Goad was speaking of Tim Wise, but it applies here too.] led me to a new idea &mdash; that whites who cheer for whitey&rsquo;s destruction are not the brave radicals they think they are&hellip;instead, they&rsquo;re cowards who go with wherever they think the flow is headed. They&rsquo;re cut from the same conformist cloth that would have had them joining lynch mobs a century ago.<br/>
 <br/>
In a way, whites pointing fingers at other whites for being &#8220;racist&#8221; is the New Passover. If you smear some anti-racist blood over your doorway, maybe the nonwhites will skip your house when they finally come seeking vengeance. </p>

		<p>Frank Rich is a typical far-lefty who hates the white, heterosexual, Christian, moderate-to-conservative masses of this country.  To him, we are all standing in the way of the libertine utopia that he envisions, and he apparently comforts himself with the notion that our ideals will largely die with the Boomer generation.  Younger whites with the same beliefs, he hopes, will be subsumed by greater numbers of non-whites.  Of course, he dismisses the fact that many blacks and browns hold conservative religious values and that ANYWHERE THERE ARE WHITES PRESENT THEY ALWAYS HOLD THE REINS OF ECONOMIC  &mdash;  if not political  &mdash;  POWER.  What Rich dreams of is actually a South-Africa-style nightmare in which he and his elitist atheist comrades will have to stay barricaded in compounds, just like all the other white and/or moneyed members of society.</p>
