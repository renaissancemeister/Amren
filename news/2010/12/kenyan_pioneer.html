		<p>The finished model is a very attractive aircraft design. At least he can do something right. Perhaps he should consider helping out the US Airforce, where sometimes it seems an impressive looking appearance is as important as anything else. </p>

		<p>It brings to mind the imitation runways and airplanes of the &#8216;cargo cult&rsquo; people of the south Pacific.</p>
<p>&#8220;A cargo cult is a type of religious practice that has appeared in many traditional tribal societies in the wake of interaction with technologically advanced cultures. </p>
<p>&#8220;The cults are focused on obtaining the material wealth (the &lsquo;cargo&rsquo;) of the advanced culture through magic and religious rituals and practices, believing that the wealth was intended for them by their deities and ancestors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some would build &#8216;aircraft decoys&rsquo; out of mud and reeds in hopes of attracting real aircraft.</p>
<p>Perhaps this man thinks he can attract Western aid and development dollars with a showy facsimile of an airplane?</p>

		<p>I know this is Africa.  I know he has no background in engineering.  But&hellip;.</p>
<p>In the real world of engineering, we would build this plane on a sheet of paper, using mathematics.  This is MUCH cheaper than building a plane than violates the laws of physics.  </p>
<p>Then, if the math is plausable, with room for error, we can proceed to build something.  But just throwing together some parts, cobbling it together and &#8220;hoping&#8221; that it will fly is madness.  </p>

		<p>I feel sorry for the guy, but I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice that the Kenyan spectators laughed uproariously at his final failure. </p>
<p>In any event, I thought this &#8220;heavier than air flying machine&#8221; thing had already been done. Is this a case of trying to reinvent the wheel (or the propeller, as the case may be)?</p>
<p>Once you go over to YouTube it&rsquo;s hard to pull yourself away sometimes. I also had to watch the video &#8220;Black woman calls 911 when McDonalds runs out of Chicken McNuggets.&#8221;</p>

  On the bright side, I can see an AA scholarship to Cal Polytech for this fellow, followed by a distinguished engineering career at Lockheed.</p>

		<p>What a laugh. The poor fools are simply too stupid to understand what idiots they are. In the video did you notice that one brilliant &#8216;arc welder&rsquo;. He does not have a proper welders helmet with a darkened viewing window - so   &mdash;  when the arc starts   &mdash;  he simply closes his eyes. Of course he can no longer watch what is happening with the weld. No wonder the undercarriage keeps collapsing on the poor morons joke airplane. Oh   &mdash;  I forgot   &mdash;  wasn&rsquo;t it blacks that invented jet airplanes AND also missiles? </p>

A good laugh, sadness, let these antics endear these people to me, total scorn at their stupidity, congratulate them at giving it a go or so on? (My reaction was disbelief that they could be in any way serious)<br>
Was this particular You Tube posted on Amren because you you have a Kenyan occupying an important job in your nation?</p>

		<p>Wow!</p>
<p>Everyone sure laughed when Stephen Hawking stated:</p>
<p><i>The world of science needs Africa&rsquo;s brilliant talents and I look forward to meeting prospective young Einsteins from Africa!<i></i></i></p>
<p>But he was right!</p>
<p>There <b>are</b> rocket scientists in Africa just waiting for someone to tap their full potential!</p>
<p>Has NASA seen this?   They&rsquo;ll want to immediately recruit these geniuses for the &#8216;new, improved, multi-cultural&rsquo; American Space Program.</p>
<p>At the rate they&rsquo;re going, they should be able to achieve blast off in&hellip; what? &hellip;.10,000 years&hellip;. or maybe not, especially considering all White technology will be gone when the last one of us Whites has been killed off and then they&rsquo;ll have to re-invent the wheel.</p>
<p>Africans did invent the wheel&hellip;..didn&rsquo;t they?</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be surprised if that actually happens   &mdash;   He&rsquo;ll get a scholarship to Cal Tech to study &#8220;Diversity Studies&#8221; or &#8220;Black Studies,&#8221; and after 18 semesters, graduate with a Bachelor&rsquo;s.  Then he&rsquo;ll spend 20 years working for Lockheed, making six figures as a diversity consultant, or in the diversity enforcement division of the Personnel/HR Dep&rsquo;t, where he&rsquo;ll actually show up to work an average of four hours a day three days a week.  After those hard, arduous 20 years, he&rsquo;ll finally be able to retire with a full pension with Cadillac health and dental.  Wouldn&rsquo;t want to be so racist as to make this brilliant black aerospace engineer make a co-payment for doc visits or meds for the 40-50 years of his retirement.</p>

<p>This brings up a question Rush raised a few weeks ago   &mdash;   There is a difference between &#8220;intelligent&#8221; and &#8220;smart.&#8221;  Stephen Hawking is obviously intelligent, but that comment is not indicative of someone who is smart.  I mean, if Africa has all this &#8220;brilliant talent,&#8221; with all the natural resources, why isn&rsquo;t some African country the world&rsquo;s sole superpower?  And with all that &#8220;brilliant talent,&#8221; the idea of us retrograde pale-faces &#8220;harvesting&#8221; that talent would be a joke   &mdash;   Instead, they would be trying to &#8220;harvest&#8221; OUR meager talents for their ends.  Ironically, Hawking&rsquo;s signature accomplishment has to do with the theoretical astrophysics of black holes, but thanks to the selfsame racial PC in which he believes, you can&rsquo;t even say or write &#8220;black hole&#8221; anymore.</p>

<p>My thoughts ran in the same direction.  It&rsquo;s a humorous tag line, but way too generous.  The Wright Brothers didn&rsquo;t &#8220;start out&#8221; in exactly the same way   &mdash;   Unlike these Kenyans, they started out in an advanced civilization that (for the most part) backed their ambitions up in a lot of ways, and a civilization which was centuries into the Age of Enlightenment and several decades into a period of markedly high rates of unique inventions.  And unlike these Kenyans, the Wright Brothers didn&rsquo;t have the luxury of a previous century of aviation, and a century where the first rudimentary airplane was refined over and over again   &mdash;   The Wright Brothers were literally The First, doing it all by themselves and with no precedent or history to lean on.  And most fundamentally, the Wright Brothers were more than a century ago   &mdash;   After more than a century of the white world pouring insane resources in the vain attempt to bring blacks in Africa and in white countries up to white standards, in addition to the progress in aviation as a back drop, this is the best black Africa can do.</p>

		<p>We can laugh, but fact is, that guy is probably more technical and can come closer to building a plane than the vast majority of us.  I for one could not even begin to build a plane, I don&rsquo;t know aircraft design.</p>

		<p>Per this link the guy is at the very least on the right side of the Kenyan I.Q. bell curve as a Physics student and I.T. engineer.  Makes you wonder what kind of college entrance score you need to get into a Kenyan college ;-) </p>

<p>I remember when this came to light back in October, there were several articles on the net.  Many of the comments were similar to what is here however so many loved his determination and were sure he would eventually do it.  Just the classic brain washing from the high self esteem crowd.  But then again one of his countryman became President of United States.</p>

<p>That stood out with me also Tim. It&rsquo;s as if they were HAPPY that he failed. I guess that&rsquo;s the sound crabs make as they&rsquo;re pulling the other crab back down to the bottom. </p>

		<p>Probably the best thing that happened to those hapless kenyans ws that plane never got off the ground! The untrained test pilot who apparently had to control the plane with feet petals would have certainly been splattered across the countryside if he actually got airborne! Oh and I do love the design though, looks pretty cool sort of a red baron retro triplane look  &mdash;  not bad!</p>
