			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Anahad O'Connor, Kareem Fahim, New York Times, Dec. 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Seven people were shot, three of them fatally, in an explosion of violence in Newark on Thursday evening. The bloodshed was part of a spate of shootings and violent carjackings   &mdash;   including the carjacking of a state official   &mdash;   in the city over the last month. </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>Late last month, the city laid off 163 police officers, about 13 percent of the force. Many residents feared the result might be a return to the rampant crime and bloodshed that dogged Newark for years. </p>
<p>Already this year, the city was experiencing a rise in crime, including murder rates in some neighborhoods that are double what they were last year. But since the layoffs, the city has seen several more waves of violence, including a three-day stretch last week with at least six carjackings and six shootings. One of the latest carjacking victims, a lieutenant for the state attorney general&rsquo;s office, had his car taken from him at gunpoint on South Orange Avenue on Wednesday night. <br>

Buffalo beats Newark.</p>
<p>This summer, there was a mass shooting in a downtown bar. 8 black people were shot. 4 black people died. 200 black people at the bar. No black witnesses.</p>

<p>The reason for an increase in violence doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with fewer police.  They couldn&rsquo;t have prevented it any way.</p>
<p>A worsening economy with more desperate people on the streets is the reason for an increase in crime and violence, just as many analysts have forecast.</p>
<p>The increasing stock market is NOT an indicator of economic health.  It merely means the large corporations, banks and government are are all investing heavily.  </p>
<p>The situation will be getting far worse.  An article in yesterday&rsquo;s news informed that there is about 2 trillion dollars in pension funds in various cities that are defunct and cannot be paid without a bailout from the feds.</p>
<p>It was also noted that the feds are not going to be able to cover all the bailouts and that most of the states will be on their own.</p>
<p>Get ready!  The excrement is about to hit the fan, and I&rsquo;ll lay 100 to 1 odds that the MSM will be rejoicing over high Christmas sales this season, declaring we are on the mend and growing.  The next thing we will hear is that there are riots over austerity programs in various locales, because they can&rsquo;t continue meeting their budgets.</p>
<p>Right along with that tidbit of economic travail the news will be full of increasing crime and violence and more police have been laid off. </p>
<p>We are living in interesting times.</p>

<p>The way for those residents to allay those fears is not to engage in rampant crime and bloodshed at any time.  I mean, not murdering, not shooting people, not committing armed robbery, not burglarizing, not committing arson and not raping aren&rsquo;t things that suddenly get more difficult to do in the absence of a police officer.  The essence of &#8220;the right thing&#8221; is doing it when nobody of a position of authority that could punish you isn&rsquo;t looking.  That the denizens of Newark can&rsquo;t seem to do the right thing when no police are looking means that they can&rsquo;t ever do the right thing, meaning that the number of police, save a ridiculously high number per capita, budgetarily impossible, is inconsequential.</p>

<p>Desperate people and crime and violence in the streets   &mdash;   that&rsquo;s bad enough. You can try to avoid that.   It will get  really bad when they start coming after you in your homes. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m worried about.</p>

		<p>Last week I spent three nights in Newark and commuted from there to New York City by train every day.  No problems with commuting, however, I spent some time at a very large mall in Newark one evening and noticed that of the hundreds of people there, not more than 10% were white.  The personnel at the Airport Marriott I was staying at were all non-white.  I guess I was lucky that the temperature was below 20 degrees and the wind was howling or I might have had some problems.  Newark is a very rough and ugly looking place.</p>
<p>Bottom line, whites have lost big cities, and whites are losing the country.</p>
<p>How we allowed the liberals to open the floodgates to the massive influx of non-whites in the past decades, I never will understand.  To me, any vote for a democrat at any level during this period was a slice across the neck for whites.</p>
<p>Like it or not, negative thinking or not, I see no solution to the problem except for a takeover by whites and/or white thinking people with a religious mindset.  Otherwise it&rsquo;s all over.  If you don&rsquo;t have a safe place for your family and a cash supply, you might have waited too long.  Goodbye and good luck. </p>

		<p>Exactly Question Diversity. Character is what people do when they know nobody&rsquo;s watching them. It&rsquo;s the same sort of message Jesus preached when he said, &#8220;Let peace begin with me.&#8221; Has it ever occurred to these people that the world is chaotic and violent enough without them adding to it? Often the braver choice is to forgo violence than to commit it.</p>

		<p>Stories such as this really don&rsquo;t qualify as news, any more than the observation that the sky is blue does. This is simply routine behavior in heavily black areas.  To be fair about it, such an occurrence in an all-white neighborhood in Greenwich, CT would be trumpeted from coast to coast for weeks.</p>

		<p>In a similar type of story, the city of Gary, Indiana laid off 34 firemen due to budget problems. I&rsquo;m sure that some enterprising individual wanted to create his own version of Devil&rsquo;s Night in Gary, he could probably do so. It might actually help that city by clearing out a lot of abandoned houses. </p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/2w5zg59" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2w5zg59</a></p>
<p>The state of Indiana is looking at a change in the law to allow cities to declare bankruptcy. Guess who will be first to take advantage of this one, if you said Gary, go to the head of the class. </p>
<p>Also from the Northwest Indiana Times newspaper:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Times of Munster (Indiana) reports that Republican state Sen. Ed Charbonneau of Valparaiso is sponsoring a bill to outline the procedure. His bill would allow a local government in financial trouble to ask the Indiana Distressed Unit Appeals Board to appoint an &#8220;emergency manager&#8221; to run the government. The emergency manager would have the power to cut the budget, renegotiate labor contracts, and approve or veto contracts, expenses, loans and hiring.</p>
<p>The bill states that if the emergency manager can&rsquo;t turn around the local government&rsquo;s finances, the unit would be allowed to seek federal bankruptcy protection. State law currently doesn&rsquo;t allow Indiana governments to declare bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The newspaper reports that the State Board of Accounts in recent audits has questioned the abilities of the city governments in Gary and Lake Station to &#8220;continue as a going concern&#8221; because of continued high city spending despite significantly reduced city revenues because of statewide property tax caps.</p>
<p>Gary is the only municipality to have received approval from the state distressed unit board for higher local property taxes, but the panel can no longer adjust tax caps after next year.</p>
<p>Voters in November approved a referendum putting the caps in the Indiana Constitution, which will take effect in 2012. Local governments around the state have complained that the caps are severely limiting their tax revenues.&#8221;</p>
<p>I used to work with a guy who was employed at NIPSCO in the 1970&rsquo;s &amp; 80&rsquo;s (Northern Indiana Public Service Corporation - the Gas and Electric Utility in NW Indiana). One of the calls that his group would take about 2 - 3 times a year was to go shut off power and gas to the home of former Gary mayor Richard Hatcher. As always, this involved non-payment for services. Hatcher would call up and cuss out the Customer Service Rep usually within about 30 minutes. He would then go down to city hall and take money out of the treasury to catch up for the previous few months of delinquent bills. Understand, this was extremely dangerous work for the NIPSCO man who had to carry out this order. He would usually be armed, however, it was most joyful to stick it to Hatcher since he was largely responsible for running a lot of them out of their hometown. (Gary was predominantly white until sometime in the 1960&rsquo;s). </p>
<p>I wonder what will happen when they actually shut off the welfare tap?</p>

<p>&gt; I suggest to you that conservatives have gone right along with the liberal led immigration and race betrayal of Aemrica, right up to GW Bush&rsquo;s choice of Condy Rice as Secretary of State.  Most businesses, large and small have benefited in the short term through the cheap labor of immigrants, legal or illegal.   </p>
<p>&#8220;Like it or not, negative thinking or not, I see no solution to the problem except for a takeover by whites and/or white thinking people with a religious mindset. &#8220;</p>
<p>&gt; Agreed, except that we cannot &#8220;take over&#8221; anything, but preserve what is left to us.  There will not likely ever be a coordinated white uprising that will &#8220;take back&#8221; anything,a nd political movements like The Tea Party are very limited because they exist within the context of the US Constition and Bill of Rights, which effectively prevents the sort of actions that would be necessary.  In any event, since the white population is falling quickly, even if we could guarantee every white vote for non-white explusion, the window for that possibility is just a few years.  </p>
<p>No sort of racial&rsquo;cultural salvation is possible with Christianity because Christianity is ultimately a Middle Eastern - Oriental relgion and represents a non-European cultural basis of experience.   This is true for any of the three Middle Eastern religions that have historically upset the world so much. Jesus was not a European, even if Europeans have painted pictures of him for centuries that make him appear to have been.  The God of the Bible is the Hebrew God.  </p>
<p>I suggest Asatru, which is the true racially focused white religion that doesn&rsquo;t have to distort its teachings because it is so focused on Nordic/Celtic culture that non-whites have no reason to be attracted.  It focused on ancestry, for example.  It doesn&rsquo;t seek to convert the world as Christianity and Islam do, but invites whites of Nordic/Germanic/Celtic ancestry to &#8220;come home.&#8221;  </p>
<p>I suggest, as I always do, that white Christians begin to think carefully about a religious system that they must pervert, ignoring huge and popular passages in order to assert that Christianity is interested in preserving any race or national, ethnic identity.  Islam is out to supplant Christianity as it always has been.  It seems akin to how a jealous younger child might wish to eliminate their older sibling, and thereby become &#8220;king.&#8221;  But during the assertion of Christianity in Europe, White Europeans eventually converted through a revived Roman influence, that found political uses for Christianity and so spread it throughout Europe through hundreds of years of political intriging, violent force, and purges, which began to fail as soon as the greater European population became literate.  </p>
<p>This time non-whites are coming with Islam.  Its political capital in not Rome or even Greece.  They do not convert to the same extend as much as they are using our Christian based democratic societies against us.  That includes the very Christian based social democracies of Europe whether American conservatives like that idea or not (see recent comments by Chancellor Merkel).  European whites, whether they actively espouse Christianity or not, are fulfilling the role of Christian martyrs in allowing the Islamic takeover of Europe.  The ugly taste left over from the excesses of fascism in early 20th century Europe compels them to the state of a Christian martyr in the coliseum waiting for the lions to be released, not wiling to lift a hand to defend themselves.  Europe suffers from institutionalized Christian martyrdom firmly established in its cultures.  Many American Christians act the same.  </p>
<p>The only hope is the clean path of movements like Asatru, which lacks the confusion of manipulative, if simple, psychological blackmare.  It may only succeed in sustaining islands of regions in Europe set aside for exclusive white settlement (much like the Indian Reservations of North America), but it is the only hope.  Christianity will defeat us as it has in the past, over and over again, because as Kipling wrote, it saddles us with the burden of lifting up all the non-white races of the world, regardless of our precognence of failure.  It is time for us to leave them to themselves and focus on our own selves.  It is time to look back to our ancestors and then look forward to ourselves.</p>

<p><br>
This post is a great example of institutionalized Christian martyrdom in whites, just what I previously wrote about.</p>
<p>As far as I am concerned, blacks can shoot themselves to pieces, as they seem inclined to do this no matter where in the world they reside.  But if one of them turns that at me, I will use deadly force to protect myself and mine.  I claim the right to defense as a human being.  I condemn any religion or philosophy that says that I ought to be brave and take it like a good boy.  But I wouldn&rsquo;t walk into a bar full of non-whites, either.</p>

<p>I used to work for the State&rsquo;s Attorney&rsquo;s Office (in a neighboring state). Never understood why the prosecutors and judges were unarmed. You can&rsquo;t carry a gun in court but outside the courthouse it should be mandatory. As someone who puts people in prison, you&rsquo;re always a potential target.</p>
