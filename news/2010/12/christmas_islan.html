			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen Kurczy, Christian Science Monitor, December 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s tragedy [in which at least 27 refugees died when their boast broke apart on the rocks] on Christmas Island, an Australian territory 1,600 miles northwest of its coast, comes amid debate over how the government should process asylum seekers  &mdash;  and ensure their safety  &mdash;  while respecting citizens&rsquo; concerns over the economic burden of mass migration.</p>
<p>&#8220;Illegal migration has long been a political hot potato in Australia, which has a large number of foreign-born residents and an economy that is increasingly integrated with Asia, but remains uneasy over mass migration,&#8221; the Monitor&rsquo;s Bangkok correspondent, Simon Montlake, recently reported. &#8220;Australians argue that their generosity in accepting genuine refugees is being exploited by people smugglers, who profit from the seaborne trade of migrants via transit countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>According to newspaper The Australian, today&rsquo;s incident is part of a record-setting year in migrant boat arrivals. Some 6,300 asylum seekers reached Australia on 130 boats in 2010. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Calls immediately came for a change in the current government policy designating Christmas Island as the principal refugee processing center. In Australia, similar incidents have in the past sparked the government to rethink its policy on asylum seekers. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s tragedy may bolster Ms. Giddard&rsquo;s argument that a processing center abroad would help deter human traffickers who profit from the trade and also find a solution for refugees who get stuck in Indonesia. Already today, calls have come for the government to close the processing center on Christmas Island.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the Australian government was willing to properly process asylum seekers in Indonesia and resettle successful refugees in Australia, then far fewer people would get on boats to travel to Australia,&#8221; Ian Rintoul of the Refugee Action Coalition told The Australian.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If the processing center there is closed, as Prime Minister Giddard has suggested doing, the island may face the same fate as Nauru. The Monitor reported in 2008 on the economic difficulties in Nauru since that year&rsquo;s closure of the processing camp, which had been the island&rsquo;s main source of income.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nauru has an air of forlorn neglect,&#8221; the reporter found, perhaps foreshadowing the future of Christmas Island.</p>

		<p>Why are people so stupid!  Australia can trade with Asian countries without taking in Asians.  Trade does not mean taking in Asians.  In addition if you want to stop the &#8220;tragedy&#8221; of &#8220;refugees&#8221; getting hurt while trying to invade Australia then you have to simply so no to all refugees and non-European immigrants and mean it.  Once the word gets out that at best Australia will send you back to the Philippines, Thailand or wherever, no ifs and or buts, then they will stop coming.  You can not reward bad behavior or behavior you do not want.  Even if you accept just 10 percent of all &#8220;refugees&#8221; that is an inducement for others to come.  Why?  Because everyone will think that they can be part of that 10 percent.  Like all white countries Australia is too &#8220;nice&#8221; to actually defend itself.  It would have been so much simpler to let the Japanese win the war.<br/>

		<p>The majority population on Christmas Island are Chinese.  Most likely these &#8220;asylum seekers&#8221; were Chinese.  The media likes to withhold information on East Asians for some reason.  We hear so often how smart East Asians are so they should be able to find a map and make a boat and head for China.  If you can&rsquo;t build a place you want to stay in, tough, it is not white people&rsquo;s job to create nice places for you.</p>

		<p>The Australian government is evil.  By granting aministy to some of the invaders, they encourage others to risk their lives to make the dangerous voyage.  If Australians had any sense of kindness or humanity, they would immediately return any such migrants back to thier home countries and bar them from ever entering Australia.  Once migrants knew that that there was no reward, they would stop coming. Over the next decade, this would save hundreds of lives. </p>

		<p>It is not only that these illegals &#8220;boat&#8221; to Christmas Island, but the smugglers are prepared to use the illegals as hostages and perpetrate violence against their charges and attack the Australian authorities if challenged. ONLY recently the Aussies had to use their elite military contingents to board and take over some &#8220;refugee&#8221; vessel, the threat of violence was so great.</p>

		<p>Actually, the &#8220;asylum&#8221; seekers were from Iraq and Iran. By some miracle, they lost their way and bypassed Turkey, India and Indonesia safe ports and somehow landed on a boat (where they pay over $15000 each) going to Australia. Australia is currently rolling out the red carpet to all economic migrants to come and collect our generous tax payer funded handouts. The government has advertised broadly that woman and children will not be detained but will go straight into the community. Boys under 18 will also not be detained but go to home care! Guess how many boys now rock up - even though most look over 30? Yes, you see, our liberal government is playing God with our country and this is the consequence.</p>

		<p>The people on this boat didn&rsquo;t come from Asia. They came from Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan. This joint is turning into a third world hell hole. Why on earth we even worry about these people is beyond me. Their so-called holy book instructs them to kill us because we are the infidels, yet they come to us for a better life.</p>
<p>Can someone here tell me that if islam is Gods word and they live by sharia law, why do they bother coming here? We are simply stupid in allowing them to come to Judeo-Christian built countries.</p>
<p>I look forward to the next sinking of a boat carrying illegal arrivals. My prayers are being answered.</p>

		<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if all countries could pass laws denying any sanctuary to those trying to break into their country. We should have sent the first illegal back twenty years ago. Now, we have millions who are slowly turning this once-proud nation into the hell holes they left. We not only take them in, we send money to the countries they left. WHY?</p>

		<p>The majority of illegal migrants arriving at Christmas Island are Muslims and from Sri Lanka or the Middle East. As Muslims they have right of entry to Malaysia and then to Indonesia, another fiercly Muslim nation. At this point the dream of their &#8220;Guaranteed Trip to Australia&#8221; turns very sour. The next leg of their journey is dangerous sea voyage by way of an overcrowded and unseaworthy fishing boat to the Australian territory of Christmas Island.</p>
<p>If they make it to Christmas Island they are almost guaranteed acceptance as refugees who have made it to Australia.They are given free medicals,and free board and lodging in air conditioned barracks, legal representation, net access and pocket money. Very few are ever deported. The present left leaning labour Government is doing very little to discourage these arrivals.</p>
<p>This whole evil trade in human misery is facilitated by well organised and well connected Indonesian people smugglers.If there is any blame for these deaths it should be placed fully on these smugglers and NOT Australian immigration policy.</p>

<p>The refugees in this case were from Iran and Iraq. To the best of my knowledge, no Chinese asylum seekers have ever come by boat to Australia, and the only country outside of Western Asia from which boat people currently arrive is Sri Lanka (and also one incident last year from Burma, but that would be an outlier)</p>
<p>Its tragic that this has happened, and I hope that our Government can take action to discourage further attempts to enter Australia illegally so such a tragedy should not be repeated.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s say you live in a bad part of town, but you have a nice house with a tall fence around your house.  Every day people from the neighborhood attempt to climb over your fence and break into your house.  Some of them fall and are hurt.  Should you allow any who make it over your fence to live in your house FOREVER, even if they have no means of support and are totally not related to you?  Even if they will crowd out your family, bankrupt your family, compete for the toilet, shower, and stove, demand that you watch their TV shows and celebrate their history and culture, and fight with your family? Are you obligated to take them in even if they will unlock your front gate and allow their extended families into your home?</p>
<p>Pure liberal insanity! </p>
