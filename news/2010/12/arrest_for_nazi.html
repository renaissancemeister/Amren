			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carol J. Williams, Los Angeles Times, December 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The city of Santa Cruz violated the 1st Amendment rights of an advocate for the homeless when the mayor had him arrested for giving a Nazi salute at a City Council meeting, a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday.</p>
<p>The unanimous ruling by a full 11-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals deemed Mayor Christopher Krohn&rsquo;s order to remove activist Robert Norse from the public meeting to be &#8220;viewpoint discrimination&#8221; rather than an effort to maintain order during discussion about where the homeless would be permitted to sleep.</p>
<p>Chief Judge Alex Kozinski, a libertarian and fierce supporter of 1st Amendment protections, said Norse&rsquo;s ouster was spurred by a councilman&rsquo;s &#8220;hissy fit,&#8221; not any actual disruption of the meeting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The appeals court reversed a lower court decision to dismiss Norse&rsquo;s lawsuit on grounds that city officials are immune from such legal actions. The case had been dismissed by U.S. District Judge Ronald M. Whyte of San Jose on the eve of trial, denying Norse any opportunity to argue that his rights had been violated, the appeals court said.</p>
<p>Kozinski wrote a concurring opinion to underscore the constitutional issues behind the decision to send the case back for trial. The chief judge said a video of Norse&rsquo;s gesture at the March 12, 2002, meeting, part of the case record as well as available on YouTube, &#8220;speaks for itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Norse raises his hand in a brief, silent protest of the mayor&rsquo;s treatment of another speaker. The mayor ignores Norse&rsquo;s fleeting gesture until Councilman [Tim] Fitzmaurice throws a hissy fit,&#8221; Kozinski said in arguing that Norse&rsquo; stiff-armed salute fell far short of the disruption necessary to justify his removal and arrest.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Norse is an activist with Homeless United for Friendship and Freedom and has been battling Santa Cruz officials over their treatment of the city&rsquo;s down-and-out for more than a decade.</p>

		<p>The black equivalent of the Nazi salute is the clenched fist, which I have observed many times.Why is there never any objection to it?(Remember the Simpson Trial?)</p>

		<p>I thought this type of nonsense only went in places like Europe, Canada, etc. Whether the guy was a lefty, and even if the charges were tossed-out, this does NOT bode well for the future of free-speech and for all those who scoff the persecution of Holocaust revisionists, this goes to show that it COULD happen here too! </p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s little bit about the council member who &#8220;threw a hissy fit,&#8221; and a photo (sorry folks, he appears to be white&hellip;.I know how you feel; why do you think I looked?</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s a lefty, so in the presence of a Nazi salute, of course a hissy fit was obligatory. </p>
<p>To a lefty, not to throw a hissy fit is to condone.</p>

		<p>Who exactly are todays Nazis?</p>
<p>They were a large noisy group of assorted thugs and criminals with a lot of popular support who blamed the Jews on all of Germany&rsquo;s problems.Nazi solution, eliminate the Jews.</p>
<p>80 years on we have large groups of assorted criminals, thugs and so on who blame THE WHITE man for all of their problems. Their sulute is usually a clenched fist or a suicide bomb.Their solution; Destroy White man and his nations! </p>
<p>Yet they call the supporters of Amren Nazis</p>

		<p>How come white liberals think its totally chill when Muslims support Nazi-ism, but pretend to be offended when a white person does so facetiously to make a point? I am going out on a limb and suggest that morality is used  by the left as a tool to maintain power. </p>

		<p>Just an historical note. </p>
<p>The clenched fist was the Communist salute going way back. Somehow in the 1960s in the USA it because the &#8220;black power&#8221; salute.</p>
<p>I do not think this is a coincidence.</p>

		<p>The Nazi salute was also, in ancient Rome, a military salute followed by the clenched fist over the heart, that is NOT just in the movies.</p>
