<h1><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-12085405">No Police in Mexico Town After Last Officer Kidnapped</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, December 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Mexican border town of Guadalupe has been left with no police force after the last officer was kidnapped.</p>
<p>Erika Gandara&rsquo;s house was set on fire by unidentified gunmen before she was abducted last week, according to the state prosecutor&rsquo;s office. </p>
<p>All her colleagues had resigned or were killed in the region&rsquo;s drug war.</p>
<p>More than 30,000 people have died in drug-related violence since 2006 when the President announced a crackdown on the cartels.</p>
<p>Ms Gandara, 28, had patrolled the town of 9,000 inhabitants on her own since June. </p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody wants to go into policing here, and the budget just isn&rsquo;t there anyway,&#8221; she told AFP news agency earlier this year.</p>
<p>Guadalupe is about 5km (3 miles) away from the US border and 60km (40 miles) from Ciudad Juarez, the centre of drug smuggling operations into the United States. </p>
<p>It is also close to the hamlet of Praxedis Guadalupe Guerreror, where a 20-year-old college student got the job of police chief in October because no one else applied. </p>
<p>The Mexican government has sent soldiers to patrol Guadalupe and to investigate the kidnapping of Ms Gandara. <br>

		<p>&#8220;The Mexican government has sent soldiers to patrol Guadalupe and to investigate the kidnapping of Ms Gandara.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soon it will the the soldiers who will be kidnapped and held for ransom, as the cartels sell more drugs and get even more powerful.</p>
<p>Already there have been many ambushes of the federales, and even army bases have been placed under seige by gangs until reinforcements arrive.  </p>
<p>The gangs are selling more dope and getting stronger.  The federal government is losing revenue fast as a result of a world plummetting economy, and is getting weaker.</p>
<p>Who will win in the final analysis?</p>

		<p>Just remember,  everything bad that happens in Mexico is Americas fault.  As long as you remember that you&rsquo;ll understand what needs to be done.</p>
<p>Obviously, gun crime in Mexico mean that gun control needs to be introduced in the USA.  Chaos and poverty in Mexico means that the USA must send more money. Crime in Mexico means that the USA must accept all migrants from Mexico as refuges and never deport any, regardless of what crimes they might commit.</p>
<p>And no, i&rsquo;m not joking. Those really are the demands being made in Washington D.C right now.</p>

		<p>As a nun said to me in Colombia, the problems in Latin America won&rsquo;t be fixed as long as the USA keeps taking in all the people trying to escape. She said they need to stay home and try to fix their own countires. </p>

<p>Actually, that is 100% correct.  It is the fault of the US.  Understand what Mao wrote in his little red book.  Successful revolution requires funding and covert assistance from a hostile foreign power.  And that communist power is the United States.</p>
<p>The money comes from our welfare system funneled into the drug trade and the slave trade.  This is not an accident but a carefully implemented plan by our traitorous politicians.  It would not be possible without the intense and pathological apathy of white people&hellip;..the majority of which refuse to notice the intense suffering being caused by this unless they themselves personally are being held down, gang raped and beaten.</p>
<p>So yes&hellip;.it is &#8220;America&rsquo;s fault&#8221;.  It can also be stopped cold at any time should white people choose to do so.  For now.</p>

		<p>The old saying, &#8220;When guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns&rsquo;, is not bumper-sticker rhetoric, but reality in Guadalupe, Mexico.</p>
<p>Did this coplady think the cartels would somehow give her a free pass? If she did, she was as stupid as the wind is wild.</p>

Actually, America&rsquo;s insatiable appetite for drugs is in fact the source of the problem. Government policy (prohibition) interacts with the laws of supply and demand in such a way as to create a fantastically lucrative black market with all of its attendant side effects.  </p>
<p>It think it&rsquo;s fair to say that regular readers of American Renaissance are nothing if not realists, unafraid to call a spade a spade.  Well ladies and gentlemen, it is time for us to have a &#8220;come-to-Jesus&#8221; meeting about the drug war.  It is a dismal counterproductive failure. </p>
<p>It is time to end drug war.  There are many alternatives to endless drug war, as our European brothers and sisters are exploring.  England, Italy, Switzerland, Spain, Germany, Portugal, have all taken steps toward the legalization or decriminalization of drugs. In addition, both the head of Interpol and the British Association of Chiefs of Police have called for an end to drug prohibition. </p>
<p>Continuing the war on drugs means accepting the meltdown of Mexican society into a narco-state on our southern border, inducing millions more to flee Mexico for el norte.</p>

		<p>Yeah, Karl, that will fix the problem.  Create a BIGGER demand for drugs.  Legalize it.<br>
I am sick of hearing this plea, often coming from illicit drug users.  If you are using drugs, YOU are the problem.  The &#8220;drug problem&#8221; could be solved fairly quickly not by legalizing it, but by refusing to tolerate or excuse anybody who uses drugs.  If need be, with the same punishment for dealer and user that Saudi Arabia imposes.  There is very little drug use in that country.  As is there very little theft.  Pounds of gold are hanging in plain sight in glass shop windows overnight.  No bars.  No theft.  Gee, I wonder why?  How long do you think THAT would last here in the US?  No, the solution is not legalization.  The solution is for us to stop USING.  And to punish severely those who deal in it, enable it, or use it.</p>

		<p>Karl Ketzer, if the drug traffic were purely responsible for the situation in Mexico then Mexico wouldn&rsquo;t have suffered repeated breakdowns of law and descents into anarchy before the drug trade developed.</p>
<p>And yet we find that Mexico has repeatedly collapsed into anarchy and chaos in the past.</p>
<p>Mexico is in the State it is because of what Mexicans do, not what Americans do.</p>

<p>Ahh Saudi Arabi is not the US and they do not have blacks. Blacks have little to no impulse control and any bars of gold hanging in windows would be stolen. Even if the penalty for such a crime was instant death and was actually enforced.</p>
