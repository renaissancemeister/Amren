			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andy Bloxham, London Telegraph, December 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Jane Turner intervened in a heated argument between a group of children near a school to help end it.</p>
<p>However, during the dispute a parent of one of the children reported hearing her say: &#8220;Go and play with your own little white friends, you&rsquo;re nothing but white trash.&#8221;</p>
<p>After she was reported to police, Mrs Turner initially denied using the phrase but later admitted she had said &#8220;white trash&#8221; and has since apologised.</p>
<p>Mrs Turner was working at Moseley School, a specialist language college in Birmingham, when the incident took place almost 20 miles away.</p>
<p>She was convicted at Halesowen Magistrates Court of an offence of using racially threatening words or behaviour likely to cause harassment or distress.</p>
<p>She was made subject of a community order for one year with a requirement to carry out 80 hours of unpaid work and was ordered to pay compensation of £50.</p>
<p>The General Teaching Council also investigated and yesterday announced its conclusions, criticising her for &#8220;unacceptable professional conduct&#8221; but stopping short of suspending her from teaching over the incident which took place in April 2009.</p>
<p>The GTC committee reported: &#8220;Mrs Turner witnessed a dispute between a group of young people near school premises, more than 20 miles from the school in which Mrs Turner taught.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs Turner intervened in the dispute and in the heat of the moment was observed by a parent of one of the other children saying: &#8220;Go and play with your own little white friends, you&rsquo;re nothing but white trash.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs Turner accepts that making a comment like this amounts to unprofessional conduct.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs Turner accepts that her words on this occasion may have been perceived as racist and that it is entirely inappropriate for a Registered Teacher to make such a comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Committee agrees. A registered teacher must demonstrate respect for diversity and promote equality. Conviction of an offence of this type brings the profession into disrepute.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although the offence was not committed in the vicinity of the school where Mrs Turner was teaching at that time, her behaviour set a very bad example for the schoolchildren who were present at the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The GTC committee said that it took into account that she was of previous good character and that, while she was not at first willing to accept what she had done, she was now &#8220;genuinely sorry&#8221;.</p>
<p>It added that she told the police that, at the time of the incident, she was worried about the health of a relation.</p>
<p>The committee also noted that her head teacher at the time had not found it necessary to take any further action within the school.</p>
<p>The findings say that in other circumstances a much more severe sanction would have been appropriate, but that having regard to all the mitigating circumstances of the case, the committee considers that the appropriate and proportionate response was a reprimand, which will remain on Mrs Turner&rsquo;s professional registration for two years.</p>
<p>Mrs Turner has a right of appeal to the High Court within 28 days.<br>

		<p>In that context I can see it being considered a bigoted term, but on it&rsquo;s own white trash merely describes anomalous whites that are several degrees more vulgar than the mean.   </p>

		<p>They don&rsquo;t know how it works in America. It&rsquo;s surprising the teacher didn&rsquo;t get a medal. Were the children really young? Don&rsquo;t right-thinking liberals normally use the term &#8216;red-neck&rsquo;, a racial slur, in an effort to show others how enlightened they are?</p>

<p>You can just take it to the bank, that if she had said &#8220;you&rsquo;re nothing but black trash&#8221; to a black child, she would have been fired, heavily fined, spent a year or two in jail, forced to make a public apology and prevented from ever working with children again. Still I guess it&rsquo;s some sort of progress that they even acknowleged that her statements were racially offensive.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t understand why the Brits didn&rsquo;t cut the teacher some slack on this offense. They are zealously, fanatically anti-racist over there, it is true, but they are also the snobbiest, most class-conscious people in the world. So the teacher&rsquo;s earned (or affirmatively actioned)professional status should have enabled her to insult a working class White child with impunity.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if this is good or bad in the long run.  I can see how it could be both, but this specific incident I am taking as a victory for us.  Soon you will hear more about crazy self-hating leftists getting bit in the behind from their parents&rsquo; laws they put into affect for the purpose of punishing conservatives and others with common sense.  Maybe in another generation western countries, as a whole, will repeal them.  It is possible, just look at the new generation of leftists and their diminishing support for Israel.</p>

		<p>When I was a kid I remember my parents mentioning &#8220;it looks like white trash live there&#8221; as we were driving through the country and saw the beat up sofas, washing machines, etc. on the porch and old cars abandoned in the yard.</p>
<p>Even today I refer to myself as being like &#8220;white trash&#8221; when I get too sloppy around the house.  &#8220;White trash&#8221; refers to a standard of living that is below the normal of what you would expect to see from civilized white people.  I can say that the term definitely was a factor in my quest to become successful in life and to hold myself to higher standards.</p>
<p>As I write this reply, I am looking at a large drawing hanging in my office that must be from the &rsquo;30s of an old wooden shack with an outhouse, dirt puddles as a front yard, and no electricity.  I&rsquo;ve had it since I was young and it is a constant reminder to me that I don&rsquo;t want to end up like &#8220;white trash.&#8221;</p>
<p>It would probably help everyone to raise their goals if they were called &#8220;white trash&#8221; occasionally.  If this is going to be called racist and terrible because it does not promote diversity and equality, this type of thinking is setting us up to be steam-rolled by the Muslims and Chinese at a later date.  </p>
<p>  Anyway, what happened to he saying &#8220;sticks and stones may break our bones, but words will never harm us&#8221;?    </p>

		<p>England sucks.  That&rsquo;s where America comes from; that&rsquo;s their only claim to fame, here in the 21st C.</p>
<p>They cave on every issue there.  That&rsquo;s nothing new.</p>
<p>We love you Brits, but wish you&rsquo;d have some guts.</p>
<p>BTW there are zero &#8220;slurs&#8221; that mean anything to whites.  Honky, Grayboy, White trash, etc.  These are weak sayings that provoke laughter, not fear.</p>

		<p>Omits, for some strange reason,to  report the ethnicity of this  &#8216;white trash&rsquo; teacher. Wonder why. Still, it&rsquo;s a refreshing change and  a sign that the white backlash is having some affect. But why is she still allowed to teach. If she had been white and the children black we know she would have been  struck off from the teaching profession. Birmingham by the way is one of Britain&rsquo;s first cities where whites are very soon to become the  minorty. Of course this is something to be welcomed and appplauded. I remember when I saw it being televised a few years back, the look on the bimbo&rsquo;s face. </p>

Really? And what kind of &#8220;other circumstances&#8221;, exactly?</p>
<p>What has happened to Great Britain? It is comparable to two islands in the North Atlantic, with transplanted parts from the Third World on them, now.</p>

		<p>Even the term White Trash indicates White People are held to a higher standard than many others, <br>
(as it should be, we are exceptional people)<br>
The term White Trash says you are a blemish or an exception to what is considered the normal behaviours of a White Person.<br>
To call a White Person White Trash is to say, your race is expected to be better and you aren&rsquo;t.</p>
