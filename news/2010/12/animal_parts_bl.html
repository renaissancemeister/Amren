<h1>Animal Parts, Blood Found in Suitcase of Dulles Traveler</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Emily Babay, Washington Examiner, Dec. 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Elephant tails, dried hedgehogs and chicken blood probably weren&rsquo;t on the top of your packing list the last time you traveled. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>CBP spokesman Steve Sapp said Thursday that the items were taken on Dec. 3 from a 59-year-old man who was traveling from Ghana. The passenger said the items were used for spiritual purposes. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The suitcase contained two elephant tails, bloody sheets, five chicken feathers, chicken blood, a dried hedgehog, two dried chameleons, grass, seed pods, tree bark chips and a jug filled with soil, herbs and blood, authorities said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is by far one of the strangest suitcases we&rsquo;ve ever opened,&#8221; said Christopher Hess, CBP port director for Washington.</p>
<p>The passenger had declared to CBP only that he was carrying dried herbs and clothing.</p>
<p>Most of the items were incinerated, CBP officials said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The elephant tails were not destroyed and were turned over to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The tails violated the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations.</p>
<p>CBP said the passenger was told about the U.S. regulations. The main consequence he faces, Sapp said, are that he had to give up his suitcase and all of its contents.</p>

		<p>I have found that the best way to reach Whites on the more &#8220;liberal&#8221;/ &#8220;Left&#8221; side is to present the truth of Blacks, Black Africans terrible cruelty to beautiful animals.</p>
<p>Right wing appeals to racial loyalties, racial observations about Blacks and crime don&rsquo;t work well with Liberals, the White Liberals feel sorry for the poor Blacks and want to help them not hate them.</p>
<p>But, when liberals are presented about the realities of Non Whites cruelty to animals, this often does the trick.</p>
<p>Whites love animals and they will not make excuses for anyone who abuses animals.</p>
<p>Please pass on the link to this incredible documentary about the horrors that occurred when White colonialism ended in many parts of Africa and the horrible slaughters of beautiful, endangered species animals by newly independent Black Africans free to do what they want to do.</p>
<p>The movie is:</p>
<p>Africa ADDIO - can can be seen in its entirety here on google videos:</p>

<p>Really?  I&rsquo;m inclined to wonder what would have been the &#8220;consequences&#8221; for a White man who had attempted to transport a suitcase full of such items.  A bit more than merely being required to surrender his butcher&rsquo;s suitcase, I suspect.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;But, when liberals are presented about the realities of Non Whites cruelty to animals, this often does the trick.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Not in my experience, Jack.  I have personally known White liberals who are very passionate on the subject of cruelty to animals (as am I), yet remain unmoved by black savagery.  They simply shrug it off as the result of &#8220;poverty,&#8221; or &#8220;racism,&#8221; or &#8220;lack of education&#8221; or &#8220;the legacy of apartheid&#8221; and go back to their Maya Angelou poetry readings with minds firmly closed.<br>

I am pleased that you have had success; I have had none. The liberals in my experience are indifferent to inhumane treatment of animals unless white men are the perpetrators. I had one feminist tell me that black people are cruel to animals only because white men are cruel to blacks. From my studies, this is the standard feminist position. </p>

		<p>Elephant tail?  Elephants are highly intelligent, great parents(on the whole better than people, in particular their, er, human,neighbors in Africa and India), and successful social organizers (unlike &#8216;community organizers&rsquo;).</p>
<p>The Ghanaian traveller certainly believes that all men are created equal, a foundation myth of the African liberation movement, aboltionism, civil rights advocates, and the typically mis-educated social studies teacher in America, Canada or Britain. </p>
<p>Thus, for justice to be done, and we are all for justice, aren&rsquo;t we, our Ghanaian pious pilgrim might be requested to donate an equally prominent, protruding part of his body as the tail is for the elephant. Video the equalizing extraction. Broadcast it to the eager young, sure to be successful scientists of the future found in all those African schools built by Oprah, Madonna, the UN and Angelina Jolie. And display the fun on the equivalent show in Ghana of &#8220;America&rsquo;s [Ghana&rsquo;s] Got Talent&#8221;.</p>
<p>We are all equal because Obama told me so.</p>

That documentary was fantastic! Openly taking the side of Whites and civilization in Africa,</p>
<p>On the subject of the article, I have come across a number of articles about finds of &#8216;bush meat&rsquo; in New York City and its environs. It seems the Africans can&rsquo;t just go to the grocery store and by domestic meats, but need to smuggle in baboon, wildebeest, and whatnot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that as more and more feral Africans are let in by Obama, they will discover our own native wildlife and soon be poaching deer and other animals out of season. A major threat to native wildlife here are immigrants from Asia who will have been caught transporting native reptiles and amphibians to China for food and &#8216;medicine&rsquo;. The Chinese have decimated their own native reptiles/amphibians through pollution and over-harvesting and now want to consume America&rsquo;s</p>

		<p>Powdered albino cadavers are used for spiritual purposes too in Africa, maybe we&rsquo;ll be seeing that as well in the furure from third-world immigrants.<br>

		<p>Only animal blood and parts? Guess we could think of this a &#8220;good luck.&#8221; Some Africans prefer use of Human body parts and blood for &#8220;religious ceremonies.&#8221; Parts of albino pygmies being especially prized for their purported efficacy.</p>

		<p>  Well, like their African cousins, many rural Southern blacks may still believe in Voodoo and Hoodoo, but I don&rsquo;t know any that eat so called &#8220;Bush Meat.&#8221; They buy their Voodoo charms locally or more likely, make them themselves, and most are happy enough to go to the nearest MacDonald&rsquo;s or Burger King for a hamburger.</p>

		<p>In response to some of the previous comments I have to say that the average liberal doesn&rsquo;t anymore care about the plight of animals than he cares about the plight of blacks. No, the typical liberal is just interested in taking positions that will generate positive feedback from others. The liberal is no more apt to refrain from using misery derived animal products than he is apt to raise his kids in a majority back setting.</p>
