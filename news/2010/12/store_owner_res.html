<h1>Store Owner Responds to Having &#8216;Distasteful&rsquo; Billboard</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WBMA-TV (Brimingham), Dec. 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Electronic Repair Company in East Lake is getting a lot of traffic these days all because of a sign outside the business.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Owner Chuck] Biddinger says the sign, which reads &#8220;BBQ pork restaurant is safest .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no Muslims inside,&#8221; is harmless.</p>
<p>&#8220;Muslims do not eat pork,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a known fact that Muslims have tried to commit crimes in this country.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some locals around the area gave a mixed response.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&rsquo;s hilarious to me that they would feel that way,&#8221; one man said. &#8220;But I&rsquo;m not offended about it at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would be offended if I was Muslim,&#8221; Keshia Carter said.</p>
<p>Carter says she drives by ERC regularly and is familiar with Biddinger&rsquo;s billboard humor.</p>
<p>&#8220;He does go far, but a lot of it is truthful,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But when you start getting into race and religion .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. people feel strongly.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Biddinger claims it&rsquo;s not about race or religion. He says it&rsquo;s just a joke.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not a politically correct person and I don&rsquo;t claim to be,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I never have been.&#8221; </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m surprised the full weight of the &#8220;Department of Blackness&#8221; hasn&rsquo;t been brought to bear on this business. OR WORSE! the full weight of the Jihadi murderers. And WHO CARES what  Keshia Carter  thinks, she is or will be a muslim convert and the business reeks of Whiteness so she and other blacks will be against it, and don&rsquo;t tell me KESHIA isn&rsquo;t a black name!</p>

		<p>&#8216;Haram&rsquo; restaurants in Brunei and Malaysia are obliged by law to display a sign warning muslims not to enter as pork, alcohol and other &#8216;haram&rsquo; products are prepared and served. To be fair, these countries are majority muslim but have many non-muslim citizens, mainly chinese or indian, and also serve Christian tourist and expatriate workers. However, these premises are divided in two with separate entrances, kitchens and menus, one for muslims, (with the warning sign) the other for non-muslims. No muslim objects to this as the law is fair and objective and, in any case, non-muslims may use the muslim side to enjoy a delicious local meal. Pork products are sold in supermarkets but from a seperate counter and handled by non-muslims, mainly chinese. If muslim organizations in USA had any sense, they would come up with a standard notice which would aware muslims without causing any offence but I suspect this would be considered racist and they prefer to scream and shout at every opportunity, such as this case. Of course, the &#8216;BBQ Pork&rsquo; sign should serve just as well so the &#8216;no muslims inside&rsquo; bit could have been omitted. Just use the word &#8216;haram&rsquo;, then they couldn&rsquo;t possibly object as it&rsquo;s an arabic word.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s bad about this? This fact that he even had to justify himself. If it were me, I would say, &#8220;freedom of speech. Love it or get the hell back to you mosque.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I hope this is relevant</p>
<p>1, I went out to purchase a Christmas cake this morning, they are being marketed as &#8220;Celebration&#8221; cakes. They look like Christmas cakes and hopefully it will taste like Christmas cake. Is this a case of PeeCee being taken to ridiculous extremes to avoid offending ethnic minorities and/or Islamic invaders.</p>
<p>2, I read in the paper the other day that CenterLink (Social Security) Offices  have been told not put up Chrismas decorations so as not offend ethnic minorities. (Read Muslims)<br>
Say again! These people come here for a better life, they know they are coming to a nominally Christian country that celebrates both Christmas &amp; Easter.They are more than happy to accept the generous welfare this country provides but then they are offended by a few Chrismas decorations. Its absolutely unreal.</p>
<p>Please note, I also get offended by some things. Like all the mosques that are being erected here in Australia and also Islamic dress being worn in public. (But I am not allowed to say so)</p>
