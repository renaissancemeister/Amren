	<p>
          <span class="dropcap">E</span>ver since he caught the nation&rsquo;s
 eye, Barack Obama has been careful not to be too black. At the risk of 
alienating the pushier segment of his natural constituency, he has tried
 to cultivate a &#8220;post-racial&#8221; image that does not scare off too many 
whites. It was a balancing act that worked well during the presidential 
election campaign, and culminated in an almost Second Coming-like 
atmosphere for the inauguration. However, after a year in office, Mr. 
Obama&rsquo;s post-racial pose is wearing thin. Both his actions and his 
appointments reveal a leftist and implicitly racial agenda that is 
awakening whites to the fact that he does not stand for them. If he does
 not shore up his rapidly crumbling white support   &mdash;   and it is not clear 
how he could do that without repudiating much of his record so far   &mdash;   
2012 could be the end of the road for Barack Obama.

        </p>
        <p>
          Shortly before his death in February 2005, frequent <em>American Renaissance</em> contributor Sam Francis predicted Mr. Obama&rsquo;s ascension to the presidency and explained the dangers of his post-racial façade:

          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p>
          &#8220;Moreover, while openly racial candidates like Mr. Sharpton or
 Jesse Jackson helped instigate white racial consciousness   &mdash;   if they can
 be black, why can&rsquo;t whites be white?   &mdash;   Mr. Obama works against it: If 
he&rsquo;s neither white nor black, why should you be white? Mr. Obama, in 
other words, is both a living testament to the power of black racial 
consciousness and identity and at the very same time a living 
renunciation of white racial identity.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          During the early part of his career, Mr. Obama plowed the same
 anti-white ground as Rev. Sharpton and Mr. Jackson, but by the time he 
came to prominence at the 2004 Democratic Convention as a state senator 
running for the US Senate, he had changed his tune. He criticized black 
ghetto behavior and proclaimed, &#8220;There is not a black America and a 
white America and Latino America and Asian America   &mdash;   there&rsquo;s the United 
States of America.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          Political observers immediately hailed him as the new breed of
 black politician. In one of the first major profiles of Mr. Obama, Ryan
 Lizza wrote in <em>The Atlantic</em>:
        </p>
        <table class="boxleft">

          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p>
          &#8220;Mr. Obama&rsquo;s ability to appeal to inner-city blacks, suburban 
moms, Republican dentists, and, well, me suggests that he&rsquo;ll be able to 
venture further than most black politicians   &mdash;   further even than Carol 
Moseley Braun. &#8216;I&rsquo;m rooted in the African-American community,&rsquo; he 
frequently says, &#8216;but I&rsquo;m not limited by it.&rsquo; Indeed, charisma, 
intelligence, and ambition, tempered by a self-deprecating wit, are the 
particular hallmarks not so much of a great black politician as of any 
great one.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2004, Al Sharpton sought the Democratic nomination but 
failed miserably. Many could not help but notice how different Mr. Obama
 was from Mr. Sharpton. University of Michigan African American Studies 
professor Angela Dillard said, &#8220;I think this is really the end of an era
 of race and politics. Something&rsquo;s shifting and changing and people like
 Sharpton can&rsquo;t change with it, and something new and different is being
 created and it is about people like Obama.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet the difference was in style rather than substance. 
Jonathan Tilove, then the race and immigration correspondent for 
Newhouse News, observed that Mr. Obama &#8220;can argue for policies virtually
 indistinguishable from Sharpton&rsquo;s in cooler, non-racial terms, while 
still affirming a message of racial identity and uplift implicit in his 
very being.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Obama won the Senate election in a landslide, in large 
part because Republicans thought they could counter his post-racial 
blackness by running buffoonish black conservative and non-Illinois 
resident, Alan Keyes. Among Keyes&rsquo;s absurd and allegedly conservative 
stances was a proposal to exempt blacks from the Income Tax as a form of
 reparations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Obama was being groomed as the Great Non-White Hope for 
the Democrats as soon as he arrived in the Senate. He made little effort
 as a legislator, and focused on 2008. Post-racial platitudes in 
speeches aside, he voted like a typical black politician, winning a &#8220;100
 Percent&#8221; report card from the NAACP for 2005-2006. He received an 
&#8220;Incomplete&#8221; for 2006-2007 only because he was so busy campaigning he 
missed a lot of votes. Still, when he bothered to show up in Washington,
 he never voted against the NAACP&rsquo;s wishes.
        </p>
        <p>
          In his book <em>The Audacity of Hope,</em> Mr. Obama explained
 the importance of disguising an anti-white stance in universalistic 
blather. Because of &#8220;the success of conservatives in fanning the 
politics of resentment   &mdash;   by wildly overstating, for example, the adverse
 effects of affirmative action on white workers,&#8221; America had become a 
place where:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            &#8220;Rightly or wrongly [clearly, in his view, wrongly], white 
guilt has largely exhausted itself in America; even the most fair-minded
 of whites, those who would genuinely like to see racial inequality 
ended and poverty relieved, tend to push back against suggestions of 
racial victimization    &mdash;    or race-specific claims based on the history of
 race discrimination in this country.&#8221;
          </p>
        </blockquote>

          Rather than suggest that blacks should abandon their racial 
grievances, he urges them to promote them in universal terms. Whites 
will still vote against their interests if the alternatives are 
presented in terms of the general welfare. Mr. Obama hinted at this in a
 speech in 2007:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            &#8220;[Those who worked on civil rights in the past realized 
that] to achieve racial equality was not simply good for 
African-Americans, but it was good for America as a whole; that we could
 not be what we might be as a nation unless we healed the brutal wounds 
of slavery and Jim Crow. Now, we have made enormous progress, but the 
progress we have made is not good enough. As many have already 
mentioned, we live in a society that remains separated in terms of life 
opportunities for African-Americans, for Latinos, and the rest of the 
nation.&#8221;
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          What better way for the nation to heal &#8220;the brutal wounds of 
slavery and Jim Crow&#8221; for the good of both whites and blacks than to 
elect a biracial president? By the time Mr. Obama&rsquo;s presidential 
campaign went into full swing, the idea that his election would end 
American racism had become conventional wisdom for many liberals and 
even for conservatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of Mr. Obama&rsquo;s supporters told MSNBC prior to the Iowa 
Caucuses that she planned to support him partly &#8220;to prove that America 
has overcome racism.&#8221; Writing in <em>Slate,</em> Jack Schaffer said that
 Mr. Obama represented &#8220;the fulfillment of the American ideal, and by 
casting their ballot for him, voters can participate in that 
transcendent moment.&#8221; The favorite word journalists used to describe his
 potential was &#8220;transformational.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          When it began to seem likely that Mr. Obama would receive the 
Democratic nomination, cracks appeared in his race-transcending window 
dressing. A few commentators, such as Steve Sailer, had called attention
 to Mr. Obama&rsquo;s pastor, Jeremiah Wright. Rev. Wright is a proponent of 
militantly anti-white black liberation theology, and Mr. Obama named his
 book <em>The Audacity of Hope</em> after the title of one of Rev. 
Wright&rsquo;s sermons. He also performed Mr. Obama&rsquo;s marriage ceremony and 
baptized his children. Mr. Obama called Rev. Wright &#8220;a family member&#8221; 
and his &#8220;sounding board.&#8221; All this was largely ignored until Rev. Wright
 gave a lifetime achievement award to Louis Farrakhan. Minister 
Farrakhan, of course, has a long record of anti-white and anti-Jewish 
statements that would make even Al Sharpton blush.

        <p>
          In the ensuing weeks, more and more facts about Rev. Wright 
came to light. After September 11, he said that blacks should not sing 
&#8220;God Bless America&#8221; but &#8220;God Damn America.&#8221; Not anticipating his 
protégé&rsquo;s ascension to the Oval Office, he told students at Howard 
University in 2006 that &#8220;racism is how this country was founded and how 
this country is still run. No black man will ever be considered for 
president.&#8221; For good measure, he accused the US government of inventing 
AIDS in order to exterminate blacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an April 2008 appearance at the National Press Club, Rev. 
Wright said he did not &#8220;in any way disagree&#8221; with the originator of 
black liberation theology, Dr. James Cone, adding that &#8220;Jim&#8221; was a 
&#8220;personal friend.&#8221; This went over the reporters&rsquo; heads because they were
 unaware of Dr. Cone&rsquo;s lurid views, just one sample of which is the 
following:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            &#8220;Black theology refuses to accept a God who is not 
identified totally with the goals of the black community. If God is not 
for us and against white people, then he is a murderer, and we had 
better kill him.&#8221;
          </p>

          Mr. Obama tried to control the damage with his famous speech 
in Philadelphia that liberals have since compared to the Gettysburg 
Address and the &#8220;I Have a Dream&#8221; speech. In fact, it was more of his 
usual combination of giving whites a few empty concessions about the 
need for blacks to take &#8220;full responsibility for their own lives&#8221; and 
acknowledging that whites have &#8220;legitimate concerns&#8221; about affirmative 
action and immigration, while still blaming the problems facing blacks 
on discrimination and white &#8220;resentments.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          He tried to portray Rev. Wright as a crazy uncle rather than a
 mentor, comparing him to his supposedly racist grandmother:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            &#8220;I can no more disown him [Rev. Wright] than I can disown 
the black community. I can no more disown him than I can my white 
grandmother    &mdash;    a woman who helped raise me, a woman who sacrificed 
again and again for me, a woman who loves me as much as she loves 
anything in this world, but a woman who once confessed her fear of black
 men who passed by her on the street, and who on more than one occasion 
has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe.&#8221;
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <table class="boxleft">
          <tbody><tr>
            <td><img src="/ar/2010/03/05a-SuperObama.jpg" alt="Obamaman" width="324" height="659" /> </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p>
          It turns out that his grandmother&rsquo;s &#8220;ethnic stereotypes&#8221; were 
nothing more than her fear of an aggressive black beggar at a bus stop. 
She gave him a dollar but was afraid that if the bus had not come he 
would have attacked her. When Mr. Obama learned that the beggar&rsquo;s 
blackness probably added to her fear, &#8220;The words were like a fist in my 
stomach.&#8221; Mr. Obama tells this story in his memoir of what amounts to a 
life of racial obsession. The book is essentially the tale of how a half
 white/half Kenyan raised by whites in Hawaii eventually succeeded in 
identifying as black.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the campaign, while whites thought they saw a 
post-racial candidate, many blacks supported Mr. Obama solely because of
 his race. Radio shock jock Howard Stern sent a correspondent to Harlem 
who attributed several of John McCain&rsquo;s positions to Mr. Obama and asked
 blacks if they supported them. For example, he asked, &#8220;Are you more for
 Obama&rsquo;s policy because he&rsquo;s pro-life or because he thinks our troops 
should stay in Iraq and finish this war?&#8221; He even asked, &#8220;Do you support
 Mr. Obama&rsquo;s choice of Sarah Palin to be his VP?&#8221; One after another, 
blacks expressed their support for the black candidate and their 
ignorance of his positions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although they were better informed, even prominent black 
conservatives put race before ideology. Talk show host Armstrong 
Williams said, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t necessarily like his policies; I don&rsquo;t like much
 that he advocates, but for the first time in my life, history thrusts 
me to really seriously think about [voting Democratic].&#8221; As he explained
 to Fox News, &#8220;Among black conservatives, they tell me privately, it 
would be very hard to vote against him in November.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          Republican candidate John McCain refused to attack Mr. Obama 
for anything remotely racial. He denounced his own supporter, talk show 
host Bill Cunningham, merely for mentioning Mr. Obama&rsquo;s middle name 
&#8220;Hussein&#8221; at a rally, and told the North Carolina GOP to kill a 
television ad that reminded voters of Rev. Wright. If this strategy was 
supposed to woo blacks, it failed utterly: Only 4 percent voted for him 
   &mdash;    fewer than for any Republican candidate since blacks got the vote.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, Mr. McCain probably realized all along that he would 
get little black support. As Election Day approached, it was clear that 
only a radical shift in the campaign climate could save him. He might 
have been able to achieve that shift with a sustained television 
campaign hammering home how close Mr. Obama had been to Rev. Wright, and
 repeating the pastor&rsquo;s most vitriolic anti-white diatribes. The media 
would have been scandalized but Mr. McCain might have won. Perhaps his 
fear of being accused of &#8220;playing the race card&#8221; was greater than his 
desire to be president.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because Mr. McCain never challenged him on his association 
with Rev. Wright, Mr. Obama never had to justify it. Nor, did not bother
 to moderate his anti-white policies. He opposed black conservative Ward
 Connerly&rsquo;s ballot initiatives to ban racial preferences in Colorado and
 Kansas, and at a debate in South Carolina he stated, &#8220;I think that the 
Confederate flag should be put in a museum&#8221; rather than displayed in 
public. He even hinted at support for reparations for slavery when he 
told a gathering of minority journalists, &#8220;I consistently believe that 
when it comes to whether it&rsquo;s Native Americans or African-American 
issues or reparations, the most important thing for the US government to
 do is not just offer words, but offer deeds.&#8221;

        <p>
          On immigration, Mr. Obama followed his leftist instincts and 
adopted the full anti-white position. The immigration-control group 
Numbers USA gave him an F for his record in the Senate. During the 
presidential campaign, blacks might have appreciated some expression of 
concern about Hispanic immigration   &mdash;   they oppose immigration even more 
strongly than whites do   &mdash;   but Mr. Obama already had their support. At 
the same time, Mr. McCain again made things easy for him by promoting 
essentially the same pro-immigration positions, thus driving away 
Republicans and whites who might have supported him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Obama cultivated groups like the National Council of La 
Raza and the National Association of Latino Elected Officials, whom he 
told, &#8220;I&rsquo;ve been working with Latino leaders ever since I entered public
 service more than 20 years ago  .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We stood together when I was a civil 
rights attorney, working to ensure that Latinos were being well 
represented. And we marched together to fix our broken immigration 
system. That&rsquo;s why you can trust me when I say that I&rsquo;ll be your partner
 in the White House.&#8221; He even blamed proponents of &#8220;xenophobia&#8221; for an 
imaginary crime surge, stating, &#8220;There&rsquo;s a reason why hate crimes 
against Hispanic people doubled last year. If you have people like Lou 
Dobbs and Rush Limbaugh ginning things up, it&rsquo;s not surprising that 
would happen.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          The pandering worked. Although McCain was the most vocal 
Republican supporter of amnesty, he received only one third of the 
Hispanic vote.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Obama ended up winning over 95 percent of the black vote    &mdash;  
  the highest figure for any Democratic candidate    &mdash;    but he received 
only 43 percent of the white vote. Mr. McCain&rsquo;s 55 percent of the white 
vote would have been enough to hand him the election back in 1976 when 
whites were 89 percent of the electorate. Since then, mass immigration 
has cut that figure to 74 percent, so Mr. Obama won by a comfortable 
margin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Liberals gloated over both the victory and the dispossession 
of whites. &#8220;The face of America is changing,&#8221; said CNN&rsquo;s Soledad 
O&rsquo;Brien. &#8220;And that face doesn&rsquo;t look like Joe the Plumber.&#8221; In his 
concession speech, even John McCain congratulated Mr. Obama on 
overcoming &#8220;the old injustices that stained our nation&#8221; and &#8220;the cruel 
and painful bigotry&#8221; of the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Mr. Obama took office, commentator David Horowitz gushed 
that &#8220;whatever happens in the Obama presidency, this Inauguration Day is
 a watershed moment in the history of America and a remarkable event in 
the history of nations, and thus a cause for all of us who love this 
country&#8221; because it symbolized victory over a racially divided past. <em>New York Times</em>
 columnist Paul Krugman went further: &#8220;If the election of our first 
African-American president didn&rsquo;t stir you, if it didn&rsquo;t leave you 
teary-eyed and proud of your country, there&rsquo;s something wrong with you.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>In office</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          So how has America&rsquo;s first non-white president acted in 
office? He is the first to appoint white men to fewer than half   &mdash;   42 
percent to be precise   &mdash;   of cabinet positions. Although whites are 66 
percent of the total population and closer to 75 percent of Americans 
aged 42 to 60, they make up only 53 percent of all Senate-confirmed 
Obama appointments.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most notable diversity appointment has been the first 
Hispanic Supreme Court justice, Sonia Sotomayor, who believes that &#8220;wise
 Latinas&#8221; make better judges than white men. Even the <em>New York Times</em>
 recognized that her entire career has been one of racial activism: 
&#8220;[She] has championed the importance of considering ethnicity in 
admissions, hiring, and even judicial selection at almost every stage of
 her career.&#8221; At Princeton she headed <em>Accion Puertorriquena</em> and
 at Yale Law School she joined the National Council of La Raza and the 
Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund (now LatinoJustice 
PRLDEF), where she became a board member. She filed complaints at both 
Yale and Princeton to hire more minority professors, protested the Bakke
 decision that limited outright quotas, and then ruled against white 
firefighters in the <em>Ricci</em> case.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another &#8220;first&#8221; for Mr. Obama is black Attorney General Eric 
Holder. Two weeks after his Senate Confirmation, Mr. Holder gave a 
speech in which he called America &#8220;essentially a nation of cowards&#8221; 
because &#8220;we average Americans simply do not talk enough with each other 
about race.&#8221; He also noted that despite forced integration of schools 
and other institutions, the country remains &#8220;voluntarily socially 
segregated.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          In other words, even though we elected a black president and 
our media and political discourse are dominated by race, at a personal 
level, (white) Americans are not sufficiently concerned about blacks. 
This should have dispelled any idea that the election of Mr. Obama would
 heal America&rsquo;s racial soul.

        <p>
          Neoconservative journalist Jonah Goldberg pointed out the obvious:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            &#8220;[T]o the extent we don&rsquo;t talk about race in this country 
the primary reason is that liberals and racial activists have an 
annoying habit of attacking anyone who doesn&rsquo;t read from a liberal 
script as &#8216;racist&rsquo; or, if they&rsquo;re lucky, &#8216;insensitive.&rsquo; Thus, 
&#8216;cowardice&rsquo; is defined as refusal to do as you&rsquo;re told when that would 
in fact be the cowardly thing to do.&#8221;
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Mr. Holder has focused the Justice Department even more 
sharply on race cases, and says beefing up the civil rights division is 
his number-one priority. He says hiring an additional 50 civil rights 
lawyers is &#8220;really only a start&#8221; because President Bush inflicted 
terrible wounds on the civil rights effort &#8220;and it will take some time 
for them to fully heal.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          One way to &#8220;heal&#8221; is to use the Justice Department to ensure 
the election of black Democrats. Kingston, North Carolina, is two-thirds
 black. When the voters switched city council elections to a 
non-partisan ballot without party affiliations, the Justice Department 
blocked the change, claiming that party affiliation was &#8220;the single 
factor that allows black candidates to be elected to office.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Holder doesn&rsquo;t seem nearly so worried about voting rights 
for whites. During the 2008 election, the New Black Panther Party were 
videotaped intimidating white voters in Philadelphia. Liberal poll 
watcher Bartle Bull, who had monitored elections during the Civil Rights
 movement for the Kennedy administration, called it &#8220;the most blatant 
form of voter intimidation I have encountered in my life in political 
campaigns in many states, even going back to the work I did in 
Mississippi in the 1960s.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          This didn&rsquo;t seem to bother Mr. Holder. Just before leaving 
office, the Bush administration had initiated an investigation, but four
 months later, just as a judge was about to enforce a default settlement
 against the party, Mr. Holder&rsquo;s office dropped the case. &#8220;[T]he facts 
and the law did not support pursuing&#8221; it, a spokesman claimed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fortunately, a few Congressional Republicans, along with the 
US Commission on Civil Rights   &mdash;   which is independent from the Obama 
administration   &mdash;   are pursuing the matter (see page 15) but Mr. Holder&rsquo;s 
office is ignoring subpoenas by the commission and requests from 
Congress to turn over internal memos.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Holder&rsquo;s support for &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; legislation is also 
racially selective. He and Mr. Obama both urged passage of the Matthew 
Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which adds homosexuals as a new 
class of victims, but during Congressional hearings, the attorney 
general explained his views on hate-crimes bills in general. The new law
 would cover &#8220;crimes that have a historic basis,&#8221; meaning those against 
&#8220;people who are African-American, Hispanic, people who are Jewish, 
people who are gay, who have been targeted over   &mdash;   over the many years,&#8221; 
but not whites or Christians.

        <p>
          There have been other colorful appointments. Mr. Obama&rsquo;s Green
 Jobs Czar, Van Jones, became a self-professed communist after joining 
protests in the Rodney King case. After he abandoned communism, he 
organized rallies for Black Panther cop-killer Mumia Abu Jamal, and 
attended political events wearing T-Shirts saying &#8220;Kanye was Right&#8221; 
(referring to the rapper who said &#8220;George Bush doesn&rsquo;t care about black 
people&#8221;). Mr. Jones withdrew his nomination after his radical views were
 exposed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another disquieting black appointment was Mr. Obama&rsquo;s chief 
diversity officer for the Federal Communications Commission, Mark Lloyd.
 &#8220;There are few things I think more frightening in the American mind 
than dark-skinned black men,&#8221; he gloated. &#8220;Here I am.&#8221; There may be 
reasons to be afraid. He says that there are a limited number of 
important positions and they are filled with whites, &#8220;and unless we are 
conscious of the need to have more people of color, gays, other people 
in those positions we will not change the problem.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          Because Mr. Obama&rsquo;s first year has been dominated by the 
health care debate, his legislative agenda has been relatively free of 
specifically racial issues. Still, his medical reorganization plan has a
 number of anti-white aspects that have undoubtedly encouraged 
opposition. The bill is full of loopholes that make government-funded 
medicine available to illegal aliens, and Rep. Joe Wilson&rsquo;s cry of &#8220;You 
lie&#8221; when Mr. Obama denied this is widely considered a watershed moment 
in opposition to the bill.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Obama&rsquo;s proposed cuts in Medicare also have a racial 
angle. Many liberals accuse conservatives of hypocrisy for opposing 
government expansion into health care while insisting on keeping 
Medicare. Yet the larger truth is that whites are less than half of the 
uninsured but over 90 percent of Medicare Plan B recipients, whose 
benefits would be taxed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The president has not had much time for the &#8220;comprehensive 
immigration reform&#8221; he promised Hispanics, but his fiscal year 2011 
budget request points the way: He wants to slash funding for the Secure 
Border Initiative (which includes the &#8220;virtual fence&#8221;) and cut 180 
agents from the Border Patrol.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Obama&rsquo;s most publicized racial comments came when he said 
white Cambridge police officer James Crowley &#8220;acted stupidly&#8221; when he 
arrested black Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates for disorderly 
conduct. This was the well-known incident in which the professor had 
broken into his own house and became belligerent when Sergeant Crowley 
investigated what appeared to be a crime.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Obama&rsquo;s comments polarized the nation. Seventy-eight 
percent of blacks approved of the way the president handled the 
incident, while only 23 percent of whites did. In the following week, 
his approval rating among whites fell from 53 percent to 47 percent. 
This started a long dive in ratings as whites began to realize that Mr. 
Obama is not post racial, but an advocate for blacks. Mr. Obama&rsquo;s white 
approval rate has dropped from 61 percent at the time of his 
inauguration to the mid-30s as this article goes to press. His approval 
ratings among blacks remain over 95 percent. As the prominent liberal 
commentator Thomas Edsall notes, &#8220;White, middle-class voters ceased to 
think of Mr. Obama as a protector of their interests.&#8221; Perhaps they have
 begun to notice that, as black <em>New York Times</em> editorial board member Brent Staples likes to point out, Mr. Obama uses the pronoun &#8220;we&#8221; when he talks about blacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Americans are not falling for this bait and switch. Whites 
were gulled into thinking they had elected a post-racial president and 
do not want one who ignores the concerns of whites. Unfortunately, few 
Republicans are willing to challenge Mr. Obama on racial terms. In fact,
 they nearly universally denounced Democratic Senate Majority Leader 
Harry Reid as a racist for noting the obvious: that it was a campaign 
advantage for Mr. Obama that he was not a typical black politician, but 
&#8220;light skinned&#8221; and without a &#8220;Negro dialect.&#8221;
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the few Republicans to recognize the racial dimensions 
of Mr. Obama&rsquo;s fall from grace is Patrick Buchanan. In a column entitled
 &#8220;Has Mr. Obama Lost White America?&#8221; he attributed growing white 
disapproval to the Sotomayor nomination, the Gates affair, and the 
racial-transfer aspects of the health-care bill. His advice for 
Republicans:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            &#8220;An end to affirmative action and ethnic preferences, an end
 to bailouts of Wall Street bankers, a moratorium on immigration until 
unemployment falls to 6 percent, an industrial policy that creates jobs 
here and stops shipping them to China .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The Republicans are probably too stupid and too paralyzed by 
racial angst to take this advice. However, if Mr. Obama continues to 
show his hand on race there could be enough white resentment against him
 to elect a stupid, paralyzed Republican in 2012 anyway. In the 
meantime, Mr. Obama will try to play a cagey reelection game of hiding 
his anti-white agenda and occasionally reining in subordinates who get 
too frisky. Like all politicians, his top policy priority is to stay in 
office, and he still needs a lot of whites votes. It will be only if he 
manages to squeak in for a second term that we are likely to see in full
 flower the Barack Obama who nursed his grievances for 20 years in the 
pews of Jeremiah Wright&rsquo;s Trinity United Church. <img src="/ar/graphics/textend.gif" alt="" width="11" height="11" />

<p>So, to President Obama&hellip; Words&hellip; are like a fist-bow to the midsection. But an actual fist-blow or knife wound or bullet, coming from an aggrieved victim of color into a white stomach, that&rsquo;s just caused by oppression and white racism and another reason to call for &#8216;healing&rsquo;?

		<p>&#8220;Paul Krugman went further: &ldquo;If the election of our first African-American president didn&rsquo;t stir you, if it didn&rsquo;t leave you teary-eyed and proud of your country, there&rsquo;s something wrong with you.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>I got a little teary eyed too. It was hard as hell voting for the ignorant Democrat, Obama. But I did it, just because we&rsquo;ve never had a black president before. I have some news for Paul Krugman: If you were able to vote for Obama, the ignorant Democrat, in these times of anti-white persecution and anti-white crime, and you didn&rsquo;t feel the least bit ashamed, there&rsquo;s something wrong with You.</p>

		<p>If he wins re-election, he will really show his blackness tenfold.  And the stupid whites who supported him in both &#8216;08 and/or &#8216;12 will be the focus, along with Obama&rsquo;s bruthas and sistas, of the white rage that is boiling just beneath the surface!</p>
<p>Sooner or later we all will learn that this country will never, ever have true racial harmony.  It&rsquo;s us&hellip; or them.  And that&rsquo;s solely because it&rsquo;s really all about power and wealth, and not color.<br>

		<p>This is some kind of Twilight Zone alternate universe. There are 1.5 million acts of black crime committed against whites each year and the government and press respond by promising to end white hate and hosting an important &#8216;beer summit&rsquo; with the president, the professor, and the Connecticut cop.</p>

		<p>The scary thing is that the Republican who runs against Obama in 2012 will almost certainly not be a decent man like Ron Paul but some useless politician who thinks that what America really needs is another war or who just babbles about tax cuts without any serious proposals to cut spending   &mdash;   someone like dim bulb Sarah Palin or creepy Newt Gingrich.  I guarantee that the Republican candidate will NOT:</p>
<p>1.  End affirmative action.  (This might offend the 10% of blacks who vote Republican.)<br>
2.  Cut legal immigration.  (Corporate America wants cheap labor.)<br>
3.  Take any really effective steps to stop illegal immigration, such as punitive fines (say, $100,000 per violation) on people who employ them.  (Corporate America wants <i>really</i> cheap labor.)<br>
4.  Reduce the deficit.  Among other things that would require getting out of the Republican wars.<br>
5.  Repeal Obamacare.  Once an entitlement is created it becomes a sacred right that is defended by Republicans as much as by Democrats.</p>
<p>So while Obama is every bit the anti-white leftist that Ellison Lodge describes, I can&rsquo;t be optimistic about his replacement.  Remember that we got stuck with Obama because George W. Bush was such a disaster.  If Obama is even more of a disaster, who knows what still worse replacement will be found?  Perhaps the New Age woo woos are right and the Pleidians will take over at the end of 2012.  It might be our best hope.</p>

		<p>I had my doubts about a black president even when he was campaigning.  My fears and cynicism proved right.  However, I don&rsquo;t think Republicans have learned to be pro-white and stop pandering to non-whites or listening to non-whites&rsquo; accusations of racism.  They don&rsquo;t get that most blacks hate whites and hate conservatives and will never support us. They still don&rsquo;t get that they are turning off their white voting base by constantly ignoring their white base in favor of blacks and hispanics.</p>

		<p>Actually, we can blame our current Obama affliction on John McCain, as unappealing a candidate as ever ran for president, excepting perhaps Gus Hall.</p>
<p>He was a legendarily awful pilot, who graduated Naval flight school only because he was a four-star&rsquo;s son and grandson. He&rsquo;s reputed to have crashed at least one of every type of aircraft he&rsquo;s flown.  </p>
<p>His public speaking is borderline incoherent and he&rsquo;s anything but a loyal Republican, crossing the aisle so to be able to bask in the admiration of the liberal press establishment and sport the title of &#8220;maverick,&#8221; which he clearly enjoys more than Republican.</p>
<p>But, as with Bob Dole, another hopeless aisle-crossing lame, he was defeated by a man who by all rights should have been cleaning out his desk.</p>
