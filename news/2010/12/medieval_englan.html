			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Dunn, University of Warwick, Dec. 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>New research led by economists at the University of Warwick reveals that medieval England was not only far more prosperous than previously believed, it also actually boasted an average income that would be more than double the average per capita income of the world&rsquo;s poorest nations today.</p>
<p>In a paper entitled British Economic Growth 1270-1870 published by the University of Warwick&rsquo;s Centre on Competitive Advantage in the Global Economy (CAGE) the researchers find that living standards in medieval England were far above the &#8220;bare bones subsistence&#8221; experience of people in many of today&rsquo;s poor countries.</p>
<p>The figure of $400 annually (as expressed in 1990 international dollars) is commonly is used as a measure of &#8220;bare bones subsistence&#8221; and was previously believed to be the average income in England in the middle ages. </p>
<p>However the University of Warwick led researchers found that English per capita incomes in the late Middle Ages were actually of the order of $1,000 (again as expressed in 1990 dollars). Even on the eve of the Black Death, which first struck in 1348/49, the researchers found  per capita incomes in England of more than $800 using the same 1990 dollar measure. Their estimates for other European countries also suggest late medieval living standards well above $400.</p>
<p>This new figure of $1,000 is not only significantly higher than previous estimates for that period in England  &mdash;  it also indicates that on average medieval England was better off than some of the world&rsquo;s poorest nations today including the following (again average annual income as expressed in 1990 dollars).</p>
<p>•	Zaire $249<br>
	<br>
•	Burundi $479<br>
	<br>
•	Niger $514</p>
<p>•	Central African Republic $536</p>
<p>•	Comoro Islands $549<br>
	<br>
•	Togo $606<br>
	<br>
•	Guinea Bissau $617<br>
	<br>
•	Guinea $628<br>
	<br>
•	Sierra Leone $686<br>
	<br>
•	Haiti $686<br>
	<br>
•	Chad $706<br>
	<br>
•	Zimbabwe $779<br>
	<br>
•	Afghanistan $869<br>
	<br>
University of Warwick economist Professor Stephen Broadberry, who led the research said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Our work sheds new light on England&rsquo;s economic past, revealing that per capita incomes in medieval England  were substantially higher than the &#8220;bare bones subsistence&#8221; levels experienced by people living in poor  countries in our modern world. The majority of the British population in medieval times could afford to consume what we call a &#8220;respectability basket&#8221; of consumer goods that allowed for occasional luxuries. By the late Middle Ages, the English people were in a position to afford a varied diet including meat, dairy produce and ale, as well as the less highly processed grain products that comprised the bulk of the &#8220;bare bones subsistence&#8221; diet.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also said: </p>
<p>&#8220;Of course this paper focuses only on average per capita incomes. We also need to have a better understanding of the  distribution of income in medieval  England, as there will have been some people living at bare bones subsistence, and at times this proportion could have been quite substantial. We are now beginning research to construct social tables which will also  reveal  the distribution of income for some key benchmark years in that period&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The research provides the first annual estimates of GDP for England between 1270 and 1700 and for Great Britain between 1700 and 1870. Far more data are available for the pre-1870 period than is widely realised. Britain after the Norman conquest was a literate and numerate society that generated substantial written records, many of which have survived. As a result, the research was aided by a wide variety of records  &mdash;  among them manorial records, tithes, farming records, and probate records.&#8221;</p>
<p>Professor Broadberry further said that:</p>
<p>&#8220;Our research shows that the path to the Industrial Revolution began far earlier than commonly has been understood. A widely held view of economic history suggests that the Industrial Revolution of 1800 suddenly took off, in the wake of centuries without sustained economic growth or appreciable improvements in living standards in England from the days of the hunter-gatherer. By contrast, we find that the Industrial Revolution did not come out of the blue. Rather, it was the culmination of a long period of economic development stretching back as far as the late medieval period.&#8221;</p>

		<p> I absolutely believe that medieval England was a more accomplished society than any of today&rsquo;s poor nations. Materially however, it is much harder and perhaps impossible to say. No medieval Englishman owned a cell-phone, most third-worlders do; no medieval Englishman owned a radio, television, computer, automobile, or ate a candy-bar, or had central heating or air-conditioning in his home. On the other hand, the medieval English probably were more healthy than are those of the third world today; they certainly were better at providing themselves with food, and their average life-spans compare favorably to those of contemporary Africa. I could go on and on, but in the end, we are comparing apples and oranges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our research shows that the path to the Industrial Revolution began far earlier than commonly has been understood.

<p>This is an argument against a straw-man; no educated person believes that the Elizabethans, who had banking, farms, and colonies in another hemisphere, lived under the same economic conditions as the hunter-gatherers.</p>

Medieval Europe certainly had &#8216;division of labor&rsquo;. How many of these &#8216;modern&rsquo; nations utilize such a concept? How many of these &#8216;modern&rsquo; nations produce any people who divide labor for the advancement of the society?</p>

		<p>I agree with McGilicuddy.  We&rsquo;re often reminded of the fact that there are certain genetic make-ups that have not been through the paleolithic era.  This simple fact will not be recognized by modern economic philosphers!  If you want to see the basis of economic thought, get a time machine and set it to 10,000BC or go to Haiti.  It&rsquo;s that simple.</p>

<p>Fact is, that in the medieval era there were many scientists, like Galileo, DaVinci and  Kopernikus. A society must be a rich society to have this scientists because at today mathematics is important but that time it wasn&rsquo;t. It was a luxury.</p>
<p>There were laws. A knight was not allowed to begin a fight with a man of a city if he didn&rsquo;t warn the city before. Today I can not see any laws in Africa. There was hierarchy, there was discipline, there were laws. It was better than Africa ever will be.</p>

		<p>What the report doesn&rsquo;t tell you is that a mediaeval Englishman worked damned hard for his living.<br>
 Generally he grew all his own food on his own farm, waking up at the crack of dawn on a cold and freezing day to perform a myriad a farm chores.He cured his own bacon and ham for winter.He ploughed the earth, planted his grain and reaped his harvest under inclement conditions, he raised pigs,chickens and cows as best he could, he chopped firewood for winter etc.<br>
   Just how hard does the average African of today actually work to make his living?<br>

		<p>The medieval era featured in-depth scholarship, respect for the talented, piety for tradition, and reverence for God. Humanity was not elevated to the absurd self-worship that has accelerated dangerously in the past quarter-century or more.</p>
<p>There is little or nothing to be found in sub-sahara Africa, except in the dying precints of South Africa&rsquo;s European neighborhoods and schools, to equal the quality of the scholars and imagination of the Middle Ages, from Norway to England, from Moscow to Madrid. </p>
<p>The H-1 visas and green cards will continue however for the eager immigrants from Kenya, Ghana, the Congo and other localities, where unnecessary offspring, saved by Western medicine for no objective justifying purpose, not ideas and inspiration, are bred day after horrid day. </p>

&#8220;Medieval England Twice as Well Off as Today&rsquo;s Poorest Nations&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Wow! Dat ol&rsquo; debbil &#8220;White Skin Privilege&#8221; strikes again!</p>
<p>BTW, maybe somebody on here can refresh my memory on the name of a BBC &#8220;reality show&#8221; from 5 - 10 years back, that was shown over here. I think it must have some bland, hard-to-google title like &#8220;Life Back Then&#8221; or something, because I&rsquo;ve never been able to find it on the Net. But (a) it&rsquo;s a great show; and (b) it&rsquo;s very pertinent to the above article.</p>
<p>The concept was that several couples would live as a small farming community in Britain* around Shakespeare&rsquo;s time. I put quotes around &#8220;reality show&#8221; because this series was not your usual sensationalistic and melodramatic &#8220;reality TV&#8221;, but more like a serious BBC documentary: very low-key and educational. Everything the &#8220;stars&#8221; of the show did had to be strictly &#8220;period correct&#8221; for 1600 AD. </p>
<p>Also, the small group of moderns doing the Elizabethan farming were not picked at random, but were all academics or historians or otherwise knowledgeable about that period, so they could narrate and explain to the cameras the in&rsquo;s and out&rsquo;s what they were doing.** For instance, if one of the wives was boiling lard into soap, she&rsquo;d explain the process. If the men had to re-thatch the roof of their cabin, they&rsquo;d fill you in o nhow much straw the job required, how long it took, and so on. </p>
<p>These men and women lived one full year this way, using a 400-yr-old Farmers Almanac as their guide to planting, harvesting, etc, throughout the four seasons. They also celebrated only the &#8220;period-correct&#8221; holidays: a Summer Solstice bonfire and dance, Harvest Festival, Christmas, Easter, and that&rsquo;s about it. The rest of the time they worked, worked, worked. They could live a decent life   &mdash;   not luxurious, but definitely not starving either   &mdash;   but ONLY if they kept busy every waking minute, and permitted themselves very, VERY little slacking-off or downtime. </p>
<p>I only caught a couple of episodes, but the show was fascinating. Not just for the period detail and data, but for the overall message   &mdash;   which is basically the same message delivered in the above article. That is, even long before the Industrial Revolution, the British (and no doubt most other Europeans) had already developed at least the rudiments of modern commerce, modern agriculture, modern social customs, etc. The people   &mdash;   the COMMON people, and RURAL dwellers to boot   &mdash;   had already found many, many clever ways to make day-to-day existence more productive and less oppressive. Their lives was NOT &#8220;nasty, brutish and short.&#8221; The peasants of Shakespeare&rsquo;s time were NOT all leprous trolls and hags in rags. No doubt there were village drunks and scalawags and of course the underfed urban <i>miserables</i> in the bigger cities, but rural life back then could be (relatively) good for those who were willing to make the effort. </p>
<p>&hellip;All of which begs the question: If white peasants, with no formal education, could achieve for themselves a tolerable standard of living with only the primitive technology of FOUR CENTURIES AGO, what exactly is holding back Africa? </p>
<p>I can only conclude that what is holding back Africa is Africans. They&rsquo;re either not capable; or not trying; or some combination of the two. </p>
<p><br>
* IIRC the show was a production of BBC Wales, if that helps. </p>
<p>** I also suspect the show had to use people knowledgeable about how to survive back then because the average 21st Century chav would probably starve to death before the year-long experiment was over. <br>

<p>I think the prpper conclusion is that items like cell phones, tvs, even computers are not necessary to survival or even a quality life with a real community.  Much of what many today think is indespensible are actually a superfluous venir that supports a kind of false existence.  And what might be a suprise to many is that most of these farmers living in more remote regions had a Christian overlay and still celebrated harvest festivals, planing (May Day), etc.  Dancing around Maypoles went on even in America into the 1960s.  I did it in public schools.  But it is not difficult to see how technology has robbed the individual of real life, increasingly substituting empty consumer culture.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is obvious but anti-christians see it often in a different way to blame the church.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; Honest medieval scholars do too.  The reason Martin Luther rebelled against the church was because it had become fat and indolent, living easy on the fat, taken from their often sheared flocks all over Europe through political alliance with monarchies.  Umberto Eco&rsquo;s historic fictions such as &#8220;The Name of the Rose,&#8221; is an excellent work because he requires the reader to read actual history while telling a story of how difficult a time scientific, forensic, thought was to apply in the atomosphere of extremes in superstition and the totalitarian politics of the church. </p>
<p>&#8220;Fact is, that in the medieval era there were many scientists, like Galileo, DaVinci and Kopernikus. A society must be a rich society to have this scientists because at today mathematics is important but that time it wasn&rsquo;t. It was a luxury.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; Actually, you named them all!  These men had to battle against hte fierce suppression of the church.  Galileo was under house arrest by the church for years, as this copy and paste from Wiki illustrates:</p>
<p>&#8220;In March 1616, in connection with the Galileo affair, the Roman Catholic Church&rsquo;s Congregation of the Index issued a decree suspending De revolutionibus until it could be &#8220;corrected,&#8221; on the grounds that the supposedly Pythagorean doctrine[94] that the Earth moves and the Sun does not was &#8220;false and altogether opposed to Holy Scripture.&#8221;[95] The same decree also prohibited any work that defended the mobility of the Earth or the immobility of the Sun, or that attempted to reconcile these assertions with Scripture.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kopernikus (who was Polish) had to remain in the North, far from Rome.  His works were housed for many years solely in Sweden.  The natural tendancy of the Nordic peoples, assisted by the urge to be politically independent of Rome in England, actually allowed an underground of fledgling scientists to exist because it served those states to oppose Rome politically.  But it wasn&rsquo;t until Charles ll of England that the real scientific progress began and that was in the 17th century, when he established the Royal Society who experimented with deductive logic using simple research modes.</p>
<p>The medieval period also featured a very active Inquisition that despite popular perception, was active all over Catholic Europe.  Many a fledgling &#8220;scientist: was burnt for witchcraft an/or herersy.  Germany saw a huge amount of trials and burnings.  (Ref. Cornell University press, Witchcraft and Demonology).  But this tendancy wasn&rsquo;t limited to Catholics. The first attacks on Kopernikus came from Prostestants.  </p>
<p>As for Galileo:</p>
<p>&#8220;In 1633 Galileo Galilei was convicted of grave suspicion of heresy for &#8220;following the position of Copernicus, which is contrary to the true sense and authority of Holy Scripture,&#8221;[98] and was placed under house arrest for the rest of his life.&#8221;</p>
<p>I could go on, but is it really necessary?  The fact is that the development of the sciences and technologies were acheived due to the rebellious nature of some more intelligent of Europeans and that this rebelliousness, not to mention courage, was necessary for the modern technological epoch that provided the West with the tools for cultural and population expansion.</p>
<p>I always argue that it is the very fact that Christianity still pervades the underlying Western psychology that political movements like socialism succeed, and why &#8220;white guilt&#8221; exists.  I don&rsquo;t see too many wealthy non-Europeans engaging in philanthropic endeavors.  These very Christian set of tendancies are being used against the West.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were laws. A knight was not allowed to begin a fight with a man of a city if he didn&rsquo;t warn the city before. Today I can not see any laws in Africa. There was hierarchy, there was discipline, there were laws. It was better than Africa ever will be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; While I agree with the basic claim that Africa is largely a lawless mess, the same knights you mention here were first a &#8220;robber&#8221; class.  They subdued the weak by force,until they accepted their rule.  And they were sanctioned by the church until the idea of Crusades arrived and the knights were made to learn altruism for the sake of their alleged faith.  The Albigenisan Crusade into Southern France represents the best example of how the church used these altruistic knights for its own preservation.  When Simon de Montfort asked Pope Innocent lll how to identify the heretics, the Holy Pople replied, &#8220;Kill them all, God will know his own.&#8221;  (A line often misquoted in popular culture).</p>
<p>Cut and paste note;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Albigensian Crusade also had a role in the creation and institutionalization of both the Dominican Order and the Medieval Inquisition.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were law codes in Europe before Rome or Christianity.  These laws were based on Celtic druidic &#8220;clerical&#8221; decrees or Chieftan kings.  The cultural basis for European law is actually rooted as much in Odinic Codes as in Judaic, God given commandments or even Greco-Roman.  The tendancy for a handshake to be bindng derives from the &#8220;blood oath&#8221;of Asatru, the Odinic cosmology.  If you made an agreement as an honorable man, you were bound by it, and would not enter Vahalla if you broke it, because there was no forgiveness in that world.</p>
<p>It required hundreds of years for law and science to prevail in Europe.  I often muse on how much sooner and higher the West might have rose, if the suppression of Christianity had not tormented Europe over two thousand years.  Freedom of thought is the most important of all freedoms, and necessary for the advance of knowledge.  All religious dogma, regardless of its brand stands in the way of progress.  It is only that Christianity was able to use the progress of science and technology to advance and expand itself, that brought reluctant modifications of stances.  Observing the how Christianity absorbs what it cannot stop is perhaps well illustrated in America by how soon after condemning it as &#8220;Satanic&#8221; Christian Rock emerged.  Or how the writtings of JRR Tolkien, initially condemned as &#8220;Satanic&#8221; is now viewed as a paralell to the Christian experience.</p>
<p>My view, and the view of Asatru is that honorable people do what is right for their communtity without the proddings of fear and political threat.</p>

		<p>Technology is only one factor that influences a standard of living.  Other factors are population density, natural resources, and um&hellip;quality of population.  One can explain it in an equation.<br>
 <br>
(level of technology x quality of population x natural sources) / population density = standard of living.   <br>
 <br>
In the long run brighter people are more likely to survive and reproduce.  Medieval English may have been slightly less intelligent on the average than their contemporary descendents.  Nevertheless, there were many fewer of them, so there was more of everything good to go around.  </p>

		<p>It should be pointed out that Galileo, Copernicus and Da Vinci were not medieval personalities, nor English. Their achievements came much later and were largely the result of a rejection of Scholastic approaches and the embrace of pre-Christian philosophy. </p>
<p>That being said, England produced more than its share of brilliant thinkers, whose ideas drove European innovation. Roger Bacon and William of Ockham come to mind. And as has been pointed out, the average Englishman worked much harder than most people in poor countries. The &#8220;Protestant&#8221; work ethic in America is really an English work ethic, though it is found in peoples closely related to the English, like the Germans and Danes. The luxury goods available to a medieval Englishman don&rsquo;t matter. What matters in this measurement are the quality of life he had and the amount of value his labor added to the economy, and in these categories it should be no shock that the English outdid many others.</p>

This British website, Channel 4, puts the life expectancy of people in Medieval England at 30. <a href="https://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/guide12/part06.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/guide12/part06.html</a></p>
<p>Wikipedia has statistics on life expectancy for all of the world&rsquo;s nations, using data from both the UN and the CIA World Factbook, and every nation in Africa has a life expectancy above 30. According to the UN statistics, only one nation had a life expectancy below 40, while the CIA World Factbook lists three nations below 40. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy</a></p>
<p>The University of Warwick economists mentioned above, must have been using data for the small English middle class of the Medieval era. Medieval Europe was a terrible time period, and we should be thankful to the great European enlightenment philosophers, for freeing Europe from superstition and backwardness. Extreme poverty was common in England as recently as the Victorian era, as illustrated in the novels of Charles Dickens, most notably, Oliver Twist. </p>
<p>Whites have every reason to celebrate their accomplishments over the last 120 years, because the average white person today, has a higher life expectancy (over 75 years) than most Medieval European Kings.  </p>

		<p>There is little or nothing to be found in sub-sahara Africa.</p>
<p>This is true now and the cause is islam and their damn goats and sheep. THe militaristic world of 2000+ years ago, especially the WHITE world, would never have fought over worthless sand. What Egypt was, was the bread basket of the Roman world and now it barely is able to feed it&rsquo;s own population, IN FACT! without U.S. food aid, I believe it is now unable to do so. School history/geography text books from the U.S. (c. 1950s) show a map of Africa in which the Sahara desert is a mere strip of yellow across the very top of Africa whereas NOW, the desert emcompasses a full third or more of the African continent. This expansion of the wastelands in Africa coincides with the growth of islam on the continent of Africa as it did/does in Iraq, Saudi and the coastline of Syria, Lebanon and that area of the Med. Of course, I could be wrong.</p>

		<p>This is supposed to be a surprise?  Had medieval England been inhabited by black Africans its standard of living would have been immeasurably lower than it actually was.</p>
<p>In fact, black Africans cannot normally survive in any environment that is not tropical in nature.  Grass huts and sleeping on the ground are not conducive to survival in sub-freezing temperatures.</p>

		<p>Life expectancy comparisons are difficult between Olde England and present-day Africa, because there were no vaccines back in the old days, and because the rate of pnemonia deaths among babies and small children will be sky high in the damp English climate among the malnourished urban poor, while almost non-existent among poor Africans living in a warm, dry climate.</p>
<p>But assuming that a child lived to age eight, he probably had a better chance of making it to age 80 in Olde England than he would today in &#8220;modern&#8221; Africa.</p>
<p>Life expectancies today in Africa are shockingly low, and they would be far, far worse if Whitey hadn&rsquo;t invented vaccines for childhood illnesses and for smallpox, and treatments for AIDS.  Even today, the African countries can&rsquo;t manage to vaccinate their own populations out of their own resources.  If Whitey doesn&rsquo;t come down and organize it and pay for it, it usually doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>

		<p>You need only look at the size of the black tribal armies brought up by the Zulus to fight their Xhosa enemies (10,000, 20,000, 60,000) in the early South African period to realize that _for what they needed to do_ the black behavioral approach succeeded surprisingly well.  R-breeding and low skill set assimilation brought them dominance in their flight southwards from an increasingly arid Central Africa, killing all who had preceded them, until they met the white man.  And even then, it was touch and go with several of the great &#8216;Treks&rsquo; by the Dutch Boers characterized by what can only be seen as stupidity that halved their numbers due to massacre before they could even begin the wars which would eventually give them Natal, The Republic Of South Africa (Transvaal) and The Orange Free State.</p>
<p>All of which would be taken from them by another &#8216;tribal horde&rsquo;: The British.</p>
<p>The key difference between Boer and Bloody Back is that the Dutch descendants lived in small communities and farmstead which _under_ utilized the land while also lacking strategic insight into the value of denial such things as SPODs to British reinforcements, in preference for short term goals like the siege of border towns.</p>
<p>All this while Thommy fought like the hated Blacks, massing in numbers and attacking the infrastructure (i.e. the women and children) of their enemy, long after they had captured Johannesburg and Pretoria.</p>
<p>Manorial England was effectively a system of white slavery which came about as a function of the empowerment of the Lords after the English civil wars (First and Second Baron&rsquo;s Wars) which brought England, then little more than a _French_ colony to her knees, made bereft by generations of Crusading by Richard and others.</p>
<p>This period then persisted for another 3+ centuries as English kings moved from sacking the Holy Lands under the false flag conceit of &#8216;saving them&rsquo; to fighting each other for the much more useful lands of Europe.  Which -also- retarded the progress of society and technology, right up through Elizabeth&rsquo;s time when, thankfully, lust for foreign goods (then too far away to conquer directly) led to &#8216;trade&rsquo; which would eventually provide an outpouring of English citizenry, away from their warlike masters and lords.</p>
<p>Given I don&rsquo;t think there is much noble to be said for this period, from either side of the noble or royal classes, what strikes me as obvious is that your wealth is only as good as:</p>
<p>A.  You aren&rsquo;t forced to buy locally from &#8216;The Company Store&rsquo; as it were.</p>
<p>B.  You can sustain yourself on subsistence goods because a decided lack of steam technology prevented the distribution of principle foodstuffs any further than a farmer&rsquo;s market without massive losses to spoilage.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my last point:  England and Europe as a whole was saved by inclement whether from the very unending internecine warfare which saw whole populations wiped out in Africa (See: March of the Titans, Genocide was invented by the likes of Shaka and Dingaan).  Though you&rsquo;d never think it, given the way Pneumonic and Black Plagues ravaged through it, the cold weather also saved us from most of the worst of diseases which Africa breeds like a petri dish.</p>
<p>In this, we are indeed _fortunate_ to be born as different peoples.  But it is our tendency towards hierachy and absolutism which has driven us towards entropy in the absence of conquest.</p>
<p>And you can see that today in the psychologies of our Elites.  America is the last European conquest and yet, rather than preserve it for themselves and their common gene pool posterity, our wealthy class invites in the numberless hordes the better to tax them and enable their junk consumerist profit margin.</p>
<p>In this, it is critical to understand that &#8216;mass socialist behavior&rsquo; for personal gain is innately a white and yes, English, (going back to the importation of Indians to South Africa for the growing of sugar cane and before that to the Carribean and blacks for the same purpose) self destructive trait.</p>

<p>Another point to be considered is that the Romans, Greeks, Persians, etc., of the classical era probably had a higher standard of living, even for the average citizen, than we see in sub-Saharan Africa today. Consider how 2000 years ago, Roman Europe and the Near East had a network of roads, aqueducts, post stations, and other infrastructure, as well as developed systems of art, law, and a stab in the direction of science.  We can also look at other great civilizations, such as the Chinese and Indic. So it comes down to this:  why is it that black Africans, despite all the historical examples and tons of foreign aid, as well as the wealth developed by European colonialism, are reverting to a standard of living beneath that of the Middle Ages? </p>

		<p>You really have to forget everything you learned about the middle ages and the so called &#8216;dark ages&rsquo;.  Fed mostly by anti-Christian bias, the official history is that European society was poor and living under the oppression of the &#8216;evil&rsquo; Church (while the moslem nations, for example, were enlightened).  More and more, recent scholarship is disproving this.   No organization has ever done more to advance civilization than the Church.  During the dark ages Europe was overrun by barbarian warfare, and it was in the Church where the light of knowledge still shined.  Monks busied themselves not only with preserving the knowledge of the ancients, but in scientific expirementation.  Later, scholars like those mentioned in the previous post, many of them clergy, continued to advance knowledge.  The Enlightenment wasn&rsquo;t a flame that flared out suddenly of nowhere&hellip;it had been burning for centuries, nurtured and protected by the Church.  </p>
<p>During the middle ages, kings could only dream of the power the modern secular states have.  Kings knew the limit of their power, and were subject to the moral teachings of the Church.  There was no welfare state as there is today.  Charity was a Church matter, rather than controlled by the government, and no one starved.  Men worked the land or at crafts, and they owned the fruit of their lablr, rather than today where men are cogs in a vast capitalistic machine and own nothing.<br>

<p>I am not the least bit  surprised at this &#8220;finding&#8221;.  I would have assumed as much without having to read it.<br>
 <br>
When you look at the cathedrals built during that era, the palaces, the splendid city halls, the elaborate castles,  and other  architectural accomplishments that remain as testimony,  one can see that these were not products of a poor or backward society. They were highly organized and wealthy. Consider also the universities that were being built; and  the literary, philosophical, medical, and scientific works (even if only exploratory by modern standards).  <br>
 <br>
Are countries like Haiti building glorious cathedrals and founding universities?  (And all this internally generated, without any foreign aid, mind you!)  Are they inventing art forms and engaged in the rudiments of scientific discovery?  </p>
<p>There was also a lively commerce going on in Europe.  There was already  banking, finance, and industry (the great guildhalls of the Middle Ages, predecessors of the Industrial Revolution).   It&rsquo;s interesting to note that England was at that time a supplier of raw materials, not a manufacturer. But even then it was wealthy. Wealthy, that is, in terms of the world of its time.<br>
 <br>
Europe was developing the sciences of navigation, astronomy, and shipbuilding, which eventually enabled it to sail to all parts of the earth and explore them. While our modern textbooks love to  lecture us on how advanced the Arab, Indian, and Chinese civilizations were &hellip;. the  uncontested fact remains that they did not reach Europe. Europe reached them!<br>
 <br>
As for the references to Galileo and other such figures, let me point out that these persons came long after the Medieval period, and were even post-Renaissance.  And so was the reference to farming in 1600.  Serfdom and peasantry had already died out in England some centuries before, and the Middle Ages were well behind them by that time.<br>
 <br>
I might add, charitably,  that anyone who would equate cell phones and televisions to wealth and standard of living is being frivolous, at best.   I don&rsquo;t have a cell phone (and don&rsquo;t want one), and I almost never  look at TV.  I guess that makes me poor!<br>
 <br>
Regarding the life expectancy rates that someone mentioned,  I wonder if those were largely skewed by infant mortality, or perhaps by periods of plague.  Outside of those, if you subtract the infant mortality,  then probably  after that delicate stage of life was passed, the expectancy rose greatly.  Even royalty, which had access to the best of medical care, food, housing and everything else, had terrible infant mortality.   For example, Queen Anne of England   &mdash;   living several centuries after the Middle Ages    &mdash;    had about 18 children;  none of whom survived to maturity.   Think what the mortality rate  must have been among the commoners, living in an unheated house under a thatched roof!   But that was for infants.  I suspect that if you got past infancy, and had a  good standard of living, did not work in a hazardous occupation like mining,    and did not live during a time of plague, you had pretty good chances of reaching a healthy old age.<br>

		<p>This is why, of course, European history (apart from the evils of &#8216;right wing&rsquo; Nazism) has been more or less erased from the school history curriculum. Students might start asking difficult questions and drawing unacceptable conclusions.</p>
