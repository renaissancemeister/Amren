<h1><a href="https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2010/12/guiltyislamorealism_as_hate_sp.html">Guilty: Islamo-Realism as Hate Speech in Denmark</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>American Thinker, December 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When it comes to criticism of Islam, Europe&rsquo;s ruling political class now goes beyond what Orwell wrote about the vilification of the Soviet system. Regarding Leftist attitudes toward those deemed &#8220;rabidly anti-Communist,&#8221; Orwell had observed the following:</p>
<p>The upshot is that if from time to time you express a mild distaste for slave-labor camps or one-candidate elections, you are either insane or actuated by the worst motives. In the same way when Henry Wallace is asked by a newspaper interviewer why he issues falsified versions of his speeches to the press, he replies: &#8220;So you must be one of those people who are clamoring for war with Russia.&#8221; There is the milder kind of ridicule that consists in pretending that reasoned opinion is indistinguishable from an absurd out-of-date prejudice. If you do not like Communism you are a Red-baiter.</p>
<p>My colleague, the journalist and historian Lars Hedegaard, President of The Free Press Society in Denmark, forwarded some introductory remarks, followed by Danish MP Jesper Langballe&rsquo;s &#8220;guilty&#8221; plea for &#8220;hate speech&#8221;  &mdash;  more aptly Islamo-realistic speech  &mdash;  after Langballe was denied the right to prove his case.</p>
<p>Lars Hedegaard, it should be noted, is  also facing criminal trial followed by a libel suit for remarks he made in December 2009. His criminal trial takes place in Frederiksberg Court on January 24, 2011.</p>
<p>Translation: Sappho.dk  &mdash;  the web magazine of the Danish Free Press Society</p>
<p>§ 266b of the Danish penal code states,</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoever publicly or with the intent of public dissemination issues a pronouncement or other communication by which a group of persons are threatened, insulted or denigrated due to their race, skin colour, national or ethnic origin, religion or sexual orientation is liable to a fine or incarceration for up to two years.&#8221;</p>
<p>And here is what Jesper Langballe wrote that merited prosecution under the Danish penal code:</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course Lars Hedegaard should not have said that there are Muslim fathers who rape their daughters when the truth appears to be that they make due with killing their daughters (the so-called honour killings) and leave it to their uncles to rape them.&#8221;</p>
<p>[Lars Hedegaard&rsquo;s introductory remarks]</p>
<p>On December 3, 2010 the municipal court in Randers, Denmark found the Danish Member of Parliament Jesper Langballe (Danish People&rsquo;s Party) guilty of hate speech under Article 266b of the Danish penal code. In accordance with Danish legal precedent he was denied the opportunity to prove his allegation that honour killings and sexual abuse take place in Muslim families. Under Danish jurisprudence it is immaterial whether a statement is true or untrue. All that is needed for a conviction is that somebody feels offended. &#8220;With this article in the penal code,&#8221; commented Mr. Langballe, &#8220;I must be assumed convicted in advance. I have no intention of participateing in this circus. Therefore I confess.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The issue is not a modification of jurisprudence.  The issue is what type of government do Danes live under.  Basically, an anti-white fascist, totalitarian state that specifically disrespects human rights.</p>
<p>Such states do not deserve recognition, cooperation, or support from the people suffering under them.  They need to be destroyed and replaced with legitimate governments.</p>
<p>My point is reform is a pointless waste of time as no one in power will cooperate in good faith.  Bad governments are the result of bad people using power to enforce their will on victims.  It is a warfare type of situation.  Usually class warfare but the modern era adds the element of race.  Such things are handled with revolutions and a replacement of evil leaders with better ones.</p>
<p>Look at Iceland.  They literally dismantled their government and are now rebuilding it from the ground up.  Results were immediate and dramatic&hellip;&hellip;return to prosperity and a just society.</p>
<p>The entire western world needs to copy them.</p>

		<p>The &#8216;truth is no defence&rsquo; is also a central principle guiding English law.  This was set out in the case or R v Birdwood.</p>
<p>Extraordinary&hellip; if most violent crimes are actually committed by blacks and you SAY &#8216;most violent crimes are committed by blacks&rsquo; then you can be criminalised.</p>
<p>The judiciary is responsible for a lot of this&hellip; in Birdwood, they chose to construct the law in this way, it&rsquo;s not something that&rsquo;s written into the statute.</p>
<p>Judge-made law at its worst, proof, if any were needed that the ruling classes can twist the law to suit their purposes..  Birdwood is not widely known in the UK&hellip; most ordinary people might balk at the &#8216;truth is no defence&rsquo; doctrine.</p>

<p>How many Danes are aware of this little fact?  I&rsquo;m guessing that the answer is not many.</p>

		<p>Both poster #1 and #2 are correct.  It is the judges and courts exceeding their powers, disregarding common law and constitutional legislation, and implementing their own interpretations and agendas.  It is also why the &#8220;activist&#8221; groups such as gays, blacks, etc always go to the courts to try to impose their agendas on an unwilling populace - they can&rsquo;t get it done in legislation.  When in the colonies we realized that the courts were stacked against us and judges were appointed by elites who would serve the elites and NOT the people, or justice, or the law&hellip;.when we realized the elite rulers had become SO arrogant and SO against common law, common decency and common values imposing on us a serfdom for their benefit (excise taxes, import restrictions, laws forbidding free trade and manufacture in the colonies, etc) what resulted was REVOLUTION and the establishment of a new form of government.  We had ours, the French had theirs, and revolution swept European kings and governments away.  Sad thing is, we are back to arrogant elites ruling over us, stifling our liberties, demanding serfdom and the fruits of our labor be taken from us for their own agendas, courts who are ruling against just laws enacted, judges who see themselves as lifetime appointed oligarchs, and we the masses as just fodder to once again be taxed to death while they live like princes.  But it&rsquo;s worse now.  Not only are we back to all the conditions that prompted our first revolution, but now we are being targeted for extinction as a culture and a race.<br>
Why?  Because WHITES are the ONLY peoples who have EVER been able to establish truly representative government, and who demanded our rulers adhere to those values and principles.   Here in America we maintain an institutional memory of what our founding fathers intended as a just government, and a memory of WHY they rebelled and what they rebelled against.  That memory must be exterminated and the troublesome race which demands adherence to those principles must be eradicated.  The government schools are erasing that memory, and the government itself is working hard to marginalize and exterminate the race which stubbornly refuses to submit to the new tyranny.<br>

		<p>Purely out of curiosity, how does one sound respectful when commenting on the fact that mohammed married a 6 year old girl and had sex with her when she was 9 and he was 54?</p>
<p>To condemn such behaviour is clearly islamophobic, but, I suspect, some people may feel slightly uneasy in condoning such an act.</p>
<p>Probably best not to mention it.</p>

<p></p>
<p>no no no, not just anybody. If you are offended, kicked off the sidewalk, called a christian pig or whatever, that is just your tough luck. You have to be muslim, black, homosexual or the like. You can not be hated unless you are one of the coddled minorities. </p>
