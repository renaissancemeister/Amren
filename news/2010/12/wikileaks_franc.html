			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>London Telegraph, December 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Comments in diplomatic cables released by whistle-blowing website WikiLeaks and published by the daily Le Monde show frustration over France&rsquo;s record in assimilating minority groups and highlight concerns the problem could be deepening.</p>
<p>&#8220;France not only has a problem with integration or immigration; it also needs to act to give Muslims a sense of French identity,&#8221; the U.S. embassy in Paris said in a secret diplomatic cable to Washington dated Aug. 17, 2005.</p>
<p>The comments foreshadowed a wave of violent clashes in December that year between youths, many of them second-generation immigrants, and police in the gritty suburban housing projects that ring major French cities.</p>
<p>&#8220;The real problem is the failure of white Christian France to view its dark-skinned and Muslim compatriots as citizens in their own right,&#8221; the U.S. embassy told Washington in a cable dated Nov. 9, 2005. Craig Stapleton was U.S. ambassador to France under the administration of President George W. Bush.</p>
<p>A succession of WikiLeaks releases has exposed the inner workings of U.S. diplomacy and revealed at times frank views of foreign leaders, prompting charges of irresponsibility from countries including France.</p>
<p>The cables published by Le Monde date back to mid-2005 and cover the presidencies of both Mr Bush and Barack Obama, but there is little variation in U.S. attitudes toward France and its policies on immigrants and minorities.</p>
<p>&#8220;French institutions appear insufficiently flexible for a population that is growing more diverse,&#8221; said a cable from Jan. 2010. Charles Rivkin is currently U.S. ambassador to France.</p>
<p>President Nicolas Sarkozy pledged to smooth relations with descendants of immigrants when he came to power in 2007. He renamed the immigration ministry to add the words &#8220;national identity&#8221; and encouraged debate on what it meant to be French.</p>
<p>His efforts did not hold up. In the wake of controversy over his expulsion of Roma migrants last summer, the immigration ministry was absorbed into the interior ministry and Sarkozy said efforts to promote national identity had been &#8220;misunderstood&#8221;.</p>
<p>U.S. diplomats said in the cables that France would suffer if it failed to build closer ties with minorities.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that if France, over the long term, does not succeed in improving prospects for its minorities and give them true political representation, it could become weaker, more divided and perhaps inclined toward crises .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and a less effective ally as a result,&#8221; said the cable from Jan. 2010.<br>

<p>And herein lies the true issue:  why should a people voluntarily yield up their institutions to accommodate others who have been foisted on them?  &#8220;Growing more diverse&#8221; is not an act of nature, it is the result of conscious policies of the Left.</p>

		<p>To me, the whole WikiLeaks &#8220;scandal&#8221; has been a snoozer.  It makes me want to laugh at the neocons and Republicans who call such leaks &#8220;treason&#8221; and &#8220;terrorism.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Aside from the world is essentially headed to a race-based cold war, people in foreign relations bureaucracies are a bunch of Machiavellian SOBs, war is cruel, the richest country in the Arab Middle East is supplying the most money to AQ, and now this news, that non-whites are pretty much unassimilable, what have we really found out that we didn&rsquo;t already know?  I guess in the next big revelation in the next WikiLeaks docdump will be that water is wet.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s a bit rich, coming from American diplomats. </p>
<p>Around the time that cable was sent to Washington, I witnessed, in the Paris metro, a &#8220;disaffected Muslim&#8221;, &#8220;denied of a French identity by white Christian France&#8221;, nearly kicking in the head a fellow traveller for the crime of speaking English to his wife.</p>
<p>He mistook him for an evil American (which he probably was not).</p>
<p>Thank God, he was drunk, so he missed the unfortunate traveller, who, by the way, thought clever to inform him that he also spoke Arabic   &mdash;   that was before the head kick.</p>
<p>Someone should explain those diplomatic luminaries that identity is not &#8220;given&#8221;, it&rsquo;s felt. And those Muslims (or other Africans)do not feel French. They feel Muslim. Or Arab. Or African. And they hate France with a passion. They say it all the time. Some of them have made fortunes rapping about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the responsibility of the immigrant to integrate into the host country ; not the other way round. Immigrants are pampered by the system, but all the French receive in return is anti-social behaviour, spite and violent crime.</p>

		<p>These communications (if not intended to be deceptive) mean that America&rsquo;s leaders actually believe the liberal propaganda they spout. They are not just bloviating about diversity and massive alien immigration to gain political power. They are sincere in pursuing these goals. </p>
<p>Perhaps, I was wrong in assuming that U.S. politicians were sane and intelligent, and they are as demented and foolish as the people who vote for them.</p>

<p>France? a Christian country? This statistics chart shows that France has a church attendance rate of only 21%, which is probably comprised of mostly older people: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2y9lxw" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2y9lxw</a></p>
<p>In my opinion, religion provides people with a sense, meaning and purpose. If France had a sense, meaning and purpose as a nation, it wouldn&rsquo;t be bent on committing national suicide by allowing millions of Muslims to live in their country.</p>
<p>How incredibly ignorant: placing the blame on French Christians, few as they are, for Muslims&rsquo; failures. </p>

		<p>This article misses out on one important piece of information.WHO really gives these instructions; &#8220;You MUST have intergration etc&#8221;</p>
<p>One could reasonably expect that a 3rd world immigrant to France or anywhere else in the West might actually respect the nation that gives them a chance in life. Even a cleaning job in France would be better than anything they could expect from the 3rd world hell holes most originate from. But NO, they just build mosques &amp; temples and form crime or terror groups. They refuse to be part of the society that gives them everything and they teach their children HATE for the west. Their children are not encouraged to learn English or French but they are taught how to receive Welfare and demand their rights with the help of Arabic or Sri Lanken (etc) speaking human rights lawyers.<br>
THEN they still blame the host country and the white man in particular for all their problems.</p>
<p>When are &#8220;they&#8221; going to stop blaming the West for all the problems of 3rd world immigrants who themselves refuse to intergrate. When is this mysterious &#8220;They&#8221; going to stop dictating to the West that we must take in and accept all these totally unwanted 3rd world immigrants.</p>
<p>The founder of WikiLeaks is an Australian, many here have suggested that he should be awarded the &#8220;Australian of the Year Award&#8221; for his services to the cause of TRUTH. But no &#8220;they&#8221; have put out an international arrest warrant for him. Are his sins really that bad?</p>

Two problems:</p>
<p>1) These immigrants, because of their culture and history, are incapable of being integrated.</p>
<p>2) These immigrants, because of their culture and history, have no intention of integrating.</p>

<p><br>
They were right about one thing. They&rsquo;re willing to admit that at least one possible outcome of the grand expirament Multiculturalism is weakness, division, and crisis. Would it not have been better for France to simply remain a white, Christian nation in the first place? What exactly does France gain from all this?</p>

<p>No, the REAL problem is idiots like this not understanding that &#8220;its dark skinned and Muslim &#8216;compatriots&rsquo;&#8221; AREN&rsquo;T France, have NEVER been France and will NEVER BE France! They themselves don&rsquo;t WANT to be France. White South Africans who&rsquo;ve been there for generations aren&rsquo;t considered &#8216;true&rsquo; Africans by Black Africans! Just as I could live in Japan for 100 years and never be considered Japanese, as it should be.</p>

<p> People who make such stupid statements like this are truly insane. I shudder to think that we have idiots like this in senior positions. It&rsquo;s people like this that have brought our great country [ and most of the western world ] to its knees. Anyway -  this country succeeded in improving prospects for our minorities [ affirmative action ] and gave them true political representation [ gerrymandering ] and what do we have to show for it - we HAVE become weaker, we are DEFINITELY more divided and we ARE heading for a crisis.    </p>

		<p>These Muslim hoards do NOT WANT to be assimilated into French culture. It is pretty obvious that they hang out on the fringes of society, unemployed, uneducated and existing on welfare but breeding like crazy and biding their time until they are a majority and make France a Muslim country. This is the consequence of having colonies, even after they gain independence the inhabitants began to filter to the mother country, witness the Indians, Pakistanis and Afro-caribeans currently pouring into the UK. Most North Africans absolutely hate France and French culture and only want to be there to get the generous welfare handouts. Same here in the US, the Muslim immigrants want our free housing, health care and other welfare goodies all the while they plot to take over without firing a shot by having 6-7 children and converting American women and convincing them to have many children. </p>

<p>Who has?  And why would any government imbecile expect that mixing people together is going to do anything but raise the level of hatred they all share for anyone outside their tribe?</p>
<p>Anybody who wants to see what integration looks like should visit US grade/high schools and see how well behaved the blacks are, and stick around awhile and observe how well integration is doing.</p>

<p>Indeed, they are sincere in their worship of &#8220;diversity and massive alien immigration&#8221;   &mdash;  - if George Bush is at all representative of &#8220;America&rsquo;s leaders&#8221;   &mdash;  - as produced by the current rigged (early, winner-take-all) GOP presidential primary system.</p>
<p>Bush, for example, called the charge by black rapper Kanye West that &#8220;George Bush doesn&rsquo;t care about black people,&#8221; uttered during the Katrina crisis, &#8220;the worst moment of my presidency.&#8221;</p>
<p>A rapper&rsquo;s words, the worst moment in a calamitous presidency!</p>
<p>From Bush&rsquo;s memoir, Decision Points:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five years later, I can barely write those words without feeling disgusted. I am deeply insulted by the suggestion that we allowed American citizens to suffer because they were black &hellip; The more I thought about it, the angrier I felt. I was raised to believe that racism was one of the greatest evils in society. I admired Dad&rsquo;s courage when he defied near-universal opposition from his constituents to vote for the Open Housing Bill of 1968. I was proud to have earned more black votes than any Republican governor in Texas history. I had appointed African Americans to top government positions, including the first black woman national security adviser and the first two black secretaries of state. It broke my heart to see minority children shuffled through the school system, so I had based my signature domestic policy initiative, the No Child Left Behind Act, on ending the soft bigotry of low expectations. I had launched a $15 billion program to combat HIV/AIDS in Africa. As part of the response to Katrina, my administration worked with Congress to provide historically black colleges and universities in the Gulf Coast with more than $400 million in loans to restore their campuses and renew their recruiting efforts.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;I faced a lot of criticism as president. I didn&rsquo;t like hearing people claim I had lied about Iraq&rsquo;s weapons of mass destruction or cut taxes to benefit the rich. But the suggestion that I was a racist because of the response to Katrina represented an all-time low. I told Laura at the time that it was the worst moment of my presidency. I feel the same way today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bull&rsquo;s eye!!!!</p>
<p>The irony is twofold:</p>
<p>Of all people WE are lecturing the French re integrating North Africans?<br>
But we have utterly failed to integrate our Africans after 400 years.</p>
<p>Second, we tell them they must actively integrate their underachieving (non achieving?) Africans, when the lesson of the US is simply this:</p>
<p>When people leave the third world and arrive in one of the most advanced nations on earth, they either kiss the ground, dance with joy, and integrate IMMEDIATELY, or else, if they for some reason (low intelligence, barbaric habits) can&rsquo;t/don&rsquo;t want to, then they NEVER, EVER WILL - nor will their offspring, not even after centuries. </p>
<p>Why Europe wants to repeat our mistakes is beyond me - when I moved here 25 years ago, Europe lacked all of the problems of a permanent underclass, now they have it all.</p>
<p>Aside from some mentally unstable, drug addled, brainwashed freaks, Europeans would give ANYTHING to revert back to the status quo of 25 years ago: solid white majorities, low immigration, and by US standards no crime, no illiteracy, low welfare dependency. </p>

		<p>This report on France&rsquo;s failure to assimilate the stand-offish Muslims is a secret?  This confirms the blatant obvious facts that most of these hush hush cables and emails contain. Another demonstration of the waste and cost of the vast military and industial complex, and its intelligence components, both in the US and in other nations.  An industry that thrives on costly classifiction procedures to protect the obvious.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Diversity is a strength!&#8221;</p>
<p>What, those nasty whites in France are not integrating with non-whites?  They are all racists!</p>
<p>The real problem is a cultural one, and this is never, ever addressed, even here in the U.S.  It&rsquo;s not that whites are all racists and bigots.  It&rsquo;s a deeper problem.  Our entire inner psychology, designed for survival over tens of thousands of years, is to band together with those who are similar in order to create a stable society to protect your offspring.</p>
<p>Outsiders are unknown and strange and do not know the ways of the core cultural group and thus bring weakness to the group in the face of a dangerous and cruel world.</p>
<p>Cohesion is what lets us survive.</p>
<p>Now we have a lot of races living among each other, but they lead separate lives in general and mix only with others who have a similar culture.  When people of a different race adopt the cultural values of the other group, then the other group more or less lets them in.  This is all human nature.  </p>
<p>The Arabs and Africans in France not only retain their own cultures, but they&rsquo;ve adopted the worst of the modern gangsta rapper mentality, and export from America to all over the world.</p>
<p>Of course they will have a hard time integrating because they live in a way that is culturally different.  This holds true among all races and countries.  It is a cultural problem that is above religious differences (otherwise protestants and catholics and jews wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get along).</p>

<p>Sir agreed, but the point is that these minorities don&rsquo;t have what it takes to to integrate into a western Eurpoean society. That&rsquo;s where their &#8220;hatred&#8221; comes from. They know they can&rsquo;t measure up. It&rsquo;s all about standards.</p>

<p>  America&rsquo;s privileged elites want to remake the whole world in our flawed image. Multiculturalism is the religion of America&rsquo;s secular liberal elites. For them, white Christians are the root of all evil in the world. They welcome the passing of Western civilization and the demographic demise of the European peoples. They are psychologically and morally sick.</p>

		<p>There is one extraordinary interesting thing in these messages from the US embassy : the estimation they made that half the detainees in France are Moslems. The French State delivers no ethnical or religious statistics, the (politically correct) French press never makes any ethnical generalization, the (politically correct) French sociologists do not make polls or enquiries, but that US ambassador is probably very well informed. So at least we know now. The question now, is : how many are they who are Moslems or Blacks ? I suppose that about half the Blacks in France are Moslems. The criminality of the Blacks (Moslems or not) is certainly higher than the criminality of the North African. But Moslems + Blacks, is it 60%, 70%, 80% ?</p>
<p>The second big question : if I am not wrong, the average age of a detainee is something about 32 years old. But certainly, the younger the detainees, the higher the proportion of Moslems and Blacks (Moslems and Blacks are on average much younger than French of European origin). So, if, say 70% of the detainees are Moslems or Blacks, maybe 90% of the younger detainees are Moslems or Blacks&hellip; So, in twenty years, crime would be divided by ten, would the Blacks and Moslems not be in France&hellip; If it is only 10% of the detainees who are non-Moslem Blacks (a minimal guess, I think), it is 60% who are Moslems or Blacks, and maybe 40% of the oldest quarter, and 80% of the youngest quarter. So, crime would be in the future five times higher that it would have been without these immigrations.</p>
<p>An interesting question : how did this ambassador make his estimation ? This figure is partly a secrecy of society (nobody really knows, even Sarkozy), but partly it is a State secrecy (Sarkozy knows, the directors of the big newspapers know, but they deny the people the rignt to know). This wikileaks publication is, on that point, a great victory for the people. Truth makes one free. </p>

<p>A.  Absolutely nothing, except grief.  But benefitting France was never the real concern anyway. Benefitting the sundry &#8220;minorities&#8221; and weakening the majority was the concern.</p>

		<p>During the Nazi occupation of WWII, there were many French people, known as Vichys, who collaborated with the Third Reich occupation.  This pitted brother against brother, father against son, etc.  You could be in the Resistance and your own brother could be in the Vichy forces.</p>
<p>But what does this example have to do with France today?  The French government is trying to accommodate Muslims, when they should deport them back to their Muslim countries of origin!</p>
<p>The Muslims in France, and elsewhere in Europe, have every intention through large families and immigration, to take over Europe and destroy the French and other beautiful European cultures, centuries old.</p>
<p>I have visited Paris and other parts of France, and the rest of Europe.  Not all French people are nasty and snooty.  I have even met friendly French people, even in Paris.</p>
<p>If the Muslims take over France, they will destroy the Mona Lisa and other precious art as &#8220;infidel graven images,&#8221; burn France&rsquo;s famous vineyards because of Islam&rsquo;s prohibition of drinking, impose Muslim prudery on a country famous for being liberal about nudity, outlaw pork and other important parts fo France&rsquo;s famous cuisine, and do other evil to eliminate the beautiful French culture!</p>

		<p>This was the administration of George W. Bush, who was also pushing hard at the time to have Turkey accepted as a European country.   The man is a traitor, just like all the other establishment phony conservatives in the Republican Party, at National Review, American Heritage, etc.  They&rsquo;re either actual social liberals or are simply out and out crooks who don&rsquo;t care what happens to their civilization and nation as long as they can make a buck and promote their own particular interests.   There&rsquo;s no more important subject in American politics than this: lap-dog Conservatives consciously prevent any real democratic opposition to the Liberal establishment in exchange for access to the system in order to make money and service their rich friends.   Do you really think that these Conservative fat-cats believe in diversity, or that their views on what&rsquo;s wrong with Haiti or Detroit differ from yours?  </p>

		<p>These cables reveal that the US establishment is still more &#8220;pro-diversity&#8221; than the French one. To that I see three reasons. First : the immigration problem is relatively new in France (the start of the massive immigration of the Arabs : the sixties ; of the Blacks : the seventies). So, in that respect, it is just a question of time for us to become similar. Second : there is a guiltiness in the USA for slavery and past legal discrimination. We have a partial equivalent of that : colonialism : the more Blacks and Arabs commit crimes, the more it is evident for the Left that colonization was a crime (whereas it was the only happy time in the history of Black Africa, and a very happy time in Morocco and Tunisia, and not such a bad time for Algeria), and that French slavery overseas was a crime of immense proportion and an unobliterable spot. Denunciation of colonization and of slavery is becoming part of the national narrative (for instance, the parliament voted a law proclaiming slavery a crime against mankind (and they were not thinking about Barbaresque inslavement of Europeans, Moslem inslavement of Blacks, Black inslavement of Blacks ; when will they proclaim cannibalism a crime against mankind ?). Third : there is in the USA a radicality, a non-conservatism, which does not really exist elsewhere (significant of that is the integration of women in combat forces, which does not exist to that point anywhere, for instance in France or in Israel). </p>
<p>An important bulwark against a US-style pro-diversity France : the system of the concours (you are selected only on your marks ; on the written part of the concours (the most important), the examinator doesn&rsquo;t even know your name nor your gender). Another : Pétain policy of affirmative action - in favour of the non-Jews, in disfavour of the Jews. It is a stain that acts against any affirmative action policy in France. </p>

<p>Anon #4: &ldquo;These communications (if not intended to be deceptive) mean that America&rsquo;s leaders actually believe the liberal propaganda they spout. They are not just bloviating about diversity and massive alien immigration to gain political power. They are sincere &hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p>&#8220;The more I thought about it, the angrier I felt. I was raised to believe that racism was one of the greatest evils in <br>
society. &#8220;</p>
<p>This is a shocking glimpse into the pathologically insane and clearly defective brain of just one of our so-called &#8216;ruling elites&rsquo; who were infected with the virulently anti-white, virulently anti-Western brain disease known as Cultural Marxism.  And, believe me - nearly every member of our current demented, nation-and-culture and white race destroying ruling  class is infected with this deadly and fatal form of mental insanity.  </p>
<p>Imagine the cult leader James Jones on steroids, and he has somehow managed to poison the brains of every politician and every key government official - and he has programmed these zombies to harbor intense hatred for their own race, for the nation and civilization created by their race.  And, once these 1960s-raised zombies had graduated from his indoctrination school - they were unleashed upon the entire White Western world with one diabolically evil and sinister objective - to destroy the entire Western world and to wage a full scale war of racial annihilation against White European people.   </p>
<p>This is what we face, fellow AR readers.   Our white ruling elites, at the behest of the tiny group of resentful, anti-white, antagonistic ethnic competitors who originated the Frankfurt School of Cultural Marxism, have thrown in their lot with the mortal enemies of White Western people.   This enemy also despises Christianity, seeing it as an important building block in the creation of Western Civilization - so this is why our foe is pushing perversions like homosexual marriage and gays in the military, and why we see a constant stream of news articles that seem to celebrate the death of the institution of marriage - which is actually celebrating the death of the traditional white family structure, since whites have been the real target of the Cultural Marxists from day one.  </p>
<p>Well, it up to whites like us to learn how to identify these white psychopaths who lust for our destruction and purge these evil men and women from the ranks of leadership and influence over our society, our culture and our nation.  It is up to whites like us to turn the tables on these psychopaths and redefine the definition of what constitutes &#8216;the greatest evil in our society&rsquo;.  </p>
<p>Here is the new and correct definition:   &#8220;The greatest evil in our, or in any society, is for it&rsquo;s leaders to betray the legitimate ethnic interests of the majority founding stock of their nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is up to whites like us to openly and unapologetic-ally challenge these psychopaths - to go on the offensive and to aggressively,  relentlessly and ruthlessly get into their faces and put THEM on the defensive and force them to defend the genocide of White Western people and the destruction of their nations.  Hound these psychopaths out of public life, and do everything possible to expose them and shame them into the dust-bin of European history.</p>
<p>Cicero once was quoted as observing that a nation can survive when attacked by it&rsquo;s enemies from outside it&rsquo;s borders, but it can never hope to survive when it is attacked and undermined by it&rsquo;s enemies within.   This is treason, the words that flowed from the pen or pea-sized brain of Jorge Wmd Boosch.  Race treason - and this is the absolute worst, most despicable, most vile, most treacherous flavor of treason on Earth. </p>
<p>Whites must adopt a zero tolerance policy and attitude for race treason - even if it means shunning former friends or family members who&rsquo;ve engaged in this sort of treachery.  This zero tolerance policy must also extend to our Christian or Catholic or Protestant Churches and their leadership - which have largely been corrupted with the same kind of Cultural Marxist, anti-white, anti-Western poison as have our hostile political elite classes.  Hit them where it hurts most - stop donating your hard-earned money to any organized church or religious organization that works against the legitimate ethnic interests of whites.  </p>
<p>News Flash to church goers:  When a Church is helping to import African Bantu Somalis or Haitians or pushing for amnesty for 30 million illegal Mexicans and involved in helping our enemies import thousands of other non-whites from the third world into America - that church and it&rsquo;s leaders are working to destroy any future for your white children.   They are instead helping to ensure a nightmarish, Zimbabwe-like future for your white children - and that&rsquo;s makes your church leadership part of the enemy&rsquo;s team.     Resign from your church membership and form relationships with like-minded, fellow whites in your respective communities and start &#8216;home churching&rsquo;, and make sure you tell your church leadership why you made this decision.   </p>
<p>This battle that White Western European people are engaged in is not going to be changed for the better by the current crop of leaders who preside over the White Western nations.    This battle is going to have to be fought at the grass-roots level and start from the bottom and work it&rsquo;s way up,  as we identify the psychopaths among our ethnic group and systematically purge them from positions of power and influence over our societies, our people, and our nations.    One by one, it is our job to replace these despicable white genocide lusting elites with racially healthy, racially loyal whites who share our desire for white survival and for the preservation of white, Western civilization.</p>
<p>Reality check:  This battle may require the eventual breakup of the United States, followed by the formation of ethno-states, since these anti-white psychopaths are not likely to suddenly &#8216;see the light&rsquo; and start loving their own race again.  These people are terminally insane and are rabidly committed to our destruction - so, when the breakup does occur - these people must be identified and prohibited from the geographic territory of any new White ethno-state.  Give them their wish - they can live in the new African or Mestizo ethno-state, if those groups are stupid enough to allow it.   </p>
<p>Conclusion:  This struggle is the biggest battle that Anglo-Saxon-Celtic and Germanic peoples have ever fought in our history, and we cannot afford to lose this fight.  Hence, we can abide by no wimpy or sentimental, Utopian delusions by any of our weak-kneed racial kinsmen or women.   We need strong, determined, hard-as-nails white leadership - who will not wither or lose their resolve when they come under fire from our enemies.  This is for all the marbles, fellow White men and women.     We all should wrap our brains around the seriousness of this battle and adjust our attitude and tactics accordingly.  </p>

		<p>The West will eventually come to the full realization that:</p>
<p>a) Islam and Liberty are functionally incompatible. </p>
<p>b) Muslims are being ushered into the West by their leftist enablers and advocates for one reason; to serve as an endless source of chronic irritation and social unrest. The more the outlanders irritate and disrupt, the harder the authorities clamp down on the natives.</p>

		<p>To let you know how different I am from regular Conservative patriotic Americans who always moan about &#8220;The French&#8221; - how the French aren&rsquo;t grateful to America for all we&rsquo;ve done and how French are supposedly rude and insulting to Americans who visit.</p>
<p>I love most all things White French - they have a great culture, the best is that that there are few or no mean, American style feminists, bitchy career women.</p>
<p>And since the White French naturally despise Arab criminals and Muslims, a White American guy who pays for everything and tips American style and makes some effort to speak some French and appreciates the beautiful French things around him - yes the French will treat this America guy - me great.</p>
<p>I love how the French women have beautiful legs and wear sexy stockings well in to their 50s.</p>
<p>$*($*#( up tight, American and British Anglo Saxon politics/culture and who cares if lots of French worked with Germans and Danes and Belgians and Finns in World War II. </p>
<p>And France has never been crazy anti Semitic, just aware of certain &#8220;issues&#8221;.</p>

You have made the most explicit, clear, cogent and complete statement on this issue of our leader/elites that I have ever read&hellip;anywhere. I can not, for the life of me, understand why we have leaders whose policies will mean our destruction. What are they thinking? How are they considered so bright?<br>
The current policy of invite the world/invade the world will leave us destitute. But I have no allies where I live, in a small northwest town. The church (I used to attend) would seem traditional at least, but their religion is like paint on a pig, in this case the body seems to have no loyalty for the USA. None that I know in this town will recognize what is happening to us as a community and culture. It&rsquo;s like Invasion of the Body Snatchers!. You are so right though about forming alliances with like minded folks. My advice would be to watch out for entrapment or falling in with loones. Keep it legal. Vet your new associations so you don&rsquo;t fall in with a crowd that will cause you grief. May God bless you Luke.</p>
