<h1>Sarrazin Earns Millions With Anti-Immigration Book</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Local (Berlin), December 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Former Bundesbank board member Thilo Sarrazin has become a millionaire many times over thanks to the proceeds of his inflammatory book attacking Muslim immigrants.</p>
<p>Sarrazin enraged politicians and the public this summer with the incendiary publication Deutschland schafft sich ab  &mdash;  Wie wir unser Land aufs Spiel setzen, or &#8220;Abolishing Germany  &mdash;  How we&rsquo;re putting our country at jeopardy.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the book, Sarrazin warns that Germans could become &#8220;strangers in their own country&#8221; because of integration, and argues that Muslims are not compatible with German society.</p>
<p>He may have been forced to resign from his post at the Bundesbank and fight expulsion from the centre-left Social Democratic Party, but Sarrazin said on ZDF&rsquo;s talk show Stuckrad Late Night on Thursday that he&rsquo;d made a pile of money from the book. </p>
<p>When host Benjamin von Stuckrad-Barre estimated that the 1.2 million copies sold had earned his guest â‚¬3 million, Sarrazin indicated it was significantly more. </p>
<p>But the sudden wealth has not changed life for him and his wife, Sarrazin said. </p>
<p>&#8220;I just say, &#8216;It will go into the account and then we&rsquo;ll wait patiently,&rsquo;&#8221; the 65-year-old said, adding he still needed to pay taxes on the large sum.</p>
<p>When asked why he waited until his political career was over to publish the book, the former Berlin finance minister said he&rsquo;d had other issues to tackle, such as the consolidation of the German capital budget. </p>
<p>And there won&rsquo;t be another book about his time at the Bundesbank, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be a little too boring,&#8221; he quipped.</p>
<p>In the run-up to his first book&rsquo;s publication, Sarrazin also made several controversial public remarks, claiming that Muslims don&rsquo;t want to integrate and are making the country &#8220;dumber.&#8221; </p>
<p>Other controversial statements include that ethnic groups are distinguished by particular genes  &mdash;  for example that &#8220;all Jews share a certain gene.&#8221; <br>

<p>AMREN-readers are intelligent enough to see that this is a complete lie. If it shocked the public so much, how does he get a millionaire?<br>
In nearly all statistics the public say he would be right. In fact the Mainstream Media here in Germany lost all it&rsquo;s credibility at all. A Swiss news paper has already published an article about this phenomenon. The comment sections of all Blogs and newspapers were full of good critics.</p>
<p>The national Television &#8220;ARD&#8221; had a conversation with him. It was 5 against Sarrazin. After all the mediator had to admit that 70% of all emails were pro Sarrazin. However they read two letters which were against him and one which was for him. After that I think even most lefties had to admit that ARD was not neutral.</p>

<p>Are they for real?  If he had tried to publish this book earlier he wouldn&rsquo;t have had a &#8216;political career&rsquo;.  The proof is he was forced off the executive board of the Deutsche Bundesbank because of it.</p>
<p>The stupidity of those on the Left is only exceeded by their arrogance.</p>

		<p>I think Germany will be making a huge comeback in the very near future. They will very likely be the ones who lead western nations back in the right direction.</p>
<p>The Germans are the only western industrialized nation who had the good sense to keep their manufacturing facilities and the people who can run them at home. Those who twice ganged up to stop them during the last century no longer possess the industrial base needed to engage in armed conflict with an intelligent army backed by a skilled civilian workforce. </p>
<p>Our soon-to-be openly gay military is certainly of questionable effectiveness, too. If they have trouble whipping stone-age people in the middle east, how to hell can they oppose 21st Century Huns.</p>
<p>My guess is that when the Germans get fed up with non-Germans in their country, they can deal with the situation anyway they see fit and nobody will be able to stop them.</p>
<p>Maybe we can even get them to send some peace-keeping forces to the troubled areas of America. Or maybe they&rsquo;ll just come without an invitation.</p>

		<p> What is a person without an identity..? Likewise what is a nation..? Mr. Sarrazin obviously reflects the will of the majority in his nation&hellip; thus a sign of health that the German people are sick of being a host to others, that will if numbers go unchecked&hellip; transform the German nation to something they don&rsquo;t feel at home in.</p>

		<p>I was in Germany a couple of months ago - throughout October.<br>
At the time, the newspapers and magazines on the newsstands were full of discussion about the Moslem issue. I still have some of them. I was surprised and impressed by the amount of debate in the press on this subject.</p>
<p>But what impressed me even more was the fatalistic nature of the reporting and the debate.  The relentless advance of Islam was treated as an inevitable fact, the tide of history that could not be resisted.  It was basically:  &#8220;When is this going to happen?&#8221; &hellip; &#8220;How soon are we going to go Islamic?&#8221; &hellip; &#8220;How can we adjust, and how can we accommodate our Moslems better?&#8221;   </p>
<p>Nobody was ssking, &#8220;WHY do we have to have Moslems here at all?&#8221;&hellip; &#8220;What are they doing in Germany?&#8221; &hellip; &#8220;Why do WE have to adjust to THEM?&#8221; &hellip; &#8220;Why don&rsquo;t we just deport them?&#8221;</p>
<p>Evidently, THAT line of discussion is not tolerated in today&rsquo;s PC Germany;  it would land you in prison for xenophobia. As in all western countries, immigration of &#8220;minorities&#8221; has become the official, accepted doctrine; it is above and beyond discussion.  </p>
<p>So, helpless Germans can only ask &#8220;when&#8221; [they will be an Islamic state]  but not &#8220;why&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Old White Jim #3: Many of the Veterans, my Uncles included, stated that if they knew what would happen in this Country, and the rest of the Western world, they never would have fought Germany in World War II. Hindsight is 20/20. Charles Lindbergh was right. </p>
<p>There is a video on You Tube regarding Charles Lindbergh&rsquo;s Radio Address to the Nation about &#8220;Neutrality and War&#8221;. Listen to it. It is quite prohetic.</p>
<p>No, Germany today, would roll over any Nation in Europe, again, and our Feminized, Multiracial caste of characters wouldn&rsquo;t be able to stand in their way. </p>
<p>The great Military leaders of our History are rolling in their graves.  </p>

		<p>  Germany has no military tradition today. It is a pacifist nation that has become decadent and effete. Don&rsquo;t expect them to pull Western Civilization out of its morass. The nationalistic assertive Germany of old is no more and won&rsquo;t return. </p>

<p>I agree with Sardonicus. But not all are weak and effete.<br>
But when I was in Germany, I saw some female policemen who looked plenty, plenty tough.  I wouldn&rsquo;t want to mess with THEM! Those mean ladies would scare Attila the Hun.</p>

<p>In the 1970&rsquo;s there was a gang in Germany with only female members.</p>
<p>These -ahem- ladies would dress to the nines, high heels, low-cut dresses, fancy hairdo and jewellry, and then commit their dastardly deeds of robbery, etc.  They also battled with the police at that time with considerable success.</p>
<p>They were not the Baader-Meinhof gang.</p>
<p>I recall reading about it in a German magazine at that time complete with photos.  Those babes looked beautiful AND tough.</p>

<p>Please!  A nation that has to depend on women to defend it (or the facade of women defending it, anyway) is not a nation at all, anymore.  It is a laughingstock.</p>

<p>The best thing that can happen to Germany, for all of Europe, in fact, is the cause of all their problems, namely the United States, becomes financially insolvent.  That&rsquo;s going to happen a lot sooner than most people think, by the way.  Even the Fabian Socialist media isn&rsquo;t bothering to hide that fact, anymore.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7166293n&amp;tag=related%3Bphotovideo" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7166293n&tag;=related%3Bphotovideo</a></p>
<p>The past 45 years has clearly shown that pursuing a policy of guns AND butter simply doesn&rsquo;t work.  No one can afford it, for very long, at least.</p>
<p>When this country goes the way of Britannia and the Soviet Union, the few countries in Europe still financially solvent, like Germany, will be forced to pare down their bloated welfare bureaucracies so that they might be able to beef up their armed forces.  Don&rsquo;t delude yourselves: they&rsquo;ll do this because everyone at that point will KNOW what&rsquo;s coming!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11567740" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11567740</a></p>

<p>Of course, this won&rsquo;t be able to happen while these countries are still under the thumb of &#8220;dumb-o-cratic&#8221; governments.  Necessity will dictate the stronger societies become more authoritarian in character to silence the rabble and keep them in line.</p>
<p>http://www.athensnews.gr/portal/8/35239</p>
<p>This shift towards authoritarianism will no doubt be followed by the rise in nationalistic sentiments.  What&rsquo;s happening in Austria and Hungary will certainly spread elsewhere, and fast!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/hungary/7549950/Rise-of-Hungarys-far-Right-Jobbik-party-stirs-disturbing-echoes-of-the-1940s.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/hungary/7549950/Rise-of-Hungarys-far-Right-Jobbik-party-stirs-disturbing-echoes-of-the-1940s.html</a></p>
<p>I am very confident of the scenario I just painted, based on recent and not-so-recent history.  Where all this will lead is anybody&rsquo;s guess.  Unlike so-called futurists, I don&rsquo;t see a rosy future.</p>
