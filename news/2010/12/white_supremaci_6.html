	<p>When it was announced that Idris Elba was cast as Heimdall in Kenneth Branagh&rsquo;s Thor, there was a certain segment of the online population that went nuts. See, Heimdall  &mdash;  a relatively minor character in the Thor comics  &mdash;  had been traditionally portrayed as white, as had all the gods of Asgard. Even small changes like costume differences or hair color can send comic book fans spiraling into a rage, so the change of race made some people apparently shit their pants.</p>
<p>Turns out they&rsquo;re not alone. The Council of Conservative Citizens, classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, is riled up as well. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Boycott Thor site also has an article that exposes the blackness of The Black Panther, and is horrified that T&rsquo;Challa is portrayed as a genius. I really can&rsquo;t tell if this is a joke or not; I couldn&rsquo;t find out to whom the site is registered, and their Facebook fan page seems fairly legit (and has 150 fans). The Council of Conservative Citizens is undoubtedly real.</p>

		<p>This has become popular, retconning characters to make them more &#8220;diverse&#8221;. In my opinion, it is insulting to the target audience. It&rsquo;s saying, &#8220;We can&rsquo;t be bothered to take the time and effort to create an interesting character of your race for you to enjoy, so we&rsquo;ll just take a popular one and change it for you.&#8221; </p>

		<p>So fans of the Norse gods are supposed to be multicultural?</p>
<p>We would have acted the same way had Heimdall (or any Norse gods) been portrayed as a Christian diety, a woman, a homosexual, a punk-rocker, an Oriental, etc.   </p>
<p>It is our choice and right. Why are they so upset? I thought dissent and boycotts were good things!</p>
<p>They neither understand the concept of &#8220;integrity&#8221; nor of &#8220;boundaries&#8221; because they have neither, and they both go together. </p>

		<p>A year or so ago they did a shakespeare production and king richard was played by a black actor.  In the british series &#8220;Merlin,&#8221; guinivere was played by a black girl and there were blacks and asians here and there. I hear there may be black, asian and latino hobbits! </p>
<p>They say we should not complain about things like this, but they would HOWL in protest if the part of kunta kinte, joe lewis, muhammad Ali, ray charles, Ceasar Chavez or martin luther king or even nelson mandela (or any of their inner circles) were played by white guys.</p>
<p>I hate hypocrites.  But those fools did object that a white woman is playing the role of cleopatra in the upcoming film.  They say the Egyptians were racially the same as kunta kinte and other west africans.  Give the poor GREEK cleopatra a break!  </p>
<p>As for Thor, I can&rsquo;t see it because the obvious incongruency of a black african god would just spoil it for me because I know it wasn&rsquo;t faithful to the mythological world it comes from.</p>

		<p>Of course they cast blacks in Western culture movies. Western culture is so far above anything ever to come out of black African culture they must cast blacks in white roles. It makes them feel better about themselves.</p>

		<p>Have you noticed, that non-whites dominating whites is always a &#8220;change&#8221; to be welcomed, but whites dominating non-whites, is somehow not afforded the same respect?</p>
<p>If we love &#8220;change&#8221; for the sake of &#8220;change&#8221;, then we really lose the right to complain about anything different, because that means difference is good for its own sake.</p>
<p>I doubt the leftist who wrote the article would welcome Whites asserting their own will over non-whites. Which would make him a hypocrite.</p>

This is free publicity for the film and the producers are loving it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on cofcc.org and have been reading the comments of the disruptors and provocateurs. They&rsquo;re getting a big kick out of rubbing this in the faces of the &#8216;racists&rsquo;.</p>
<p>None of them see this as an issue at all. To them, it&rsquo;s &#8216;so what? Get over it. It&rsquo;s the 21st century. You&rsquo;re all racists.&rsquo; Most of these people seem to have been completely indoctrinated in multicultural theory and have learned that &#8216;race doesn&rsquo;t matter&rsquo;. Of course, they all appear to be young kids. It will be a few years before they leave their suburbs and see real multiculturalism on the street and at their work places. We won&rsquo;t know how many of them will come to realize that they&rsquo;ve been sold a worthless bill of sales when they&rsquo;re passed over to make room for a more diverse work force. That revelation will strike some of them in the future. </p>
<p>Only one guy had a unique argument. He said that if the Thor myth was sacred to whites, why didn&rsquo;t whites protest the comic when it first came out and demeaned Thor as a superhero.</p>
<p>I said it was because the original story line was true to the myth. The characters were represented as white and that the god Thor was essentially a superhero to those who created the original myth.</p>
<p>On Saturday night, cofcc.org is holding an online discussion with their radio broadcast. I have no doubt the disruptors will be busy. </p>
<p>If you go online for the discussion, please don&rsquo;t be sucked into their petty and ignorant comments. Think before you reply.</p>

		<p>Didn&rsquo;t they hound, picket and boycott the producers of Charlie Chan a couple of decades ago because Chan was played by Peter Ustinov, an Englishman? At least the character of Charlie Chan was played by someone of the same race as the author who invented and created him. Not so with the current movie under discussion. Charlie Chan films are history today due to the controversy. Can you say double standard?</p>

<p>When they make a movie about Amelia Earhart, she will be played by a black lesbian fighting white oppression in the 1930s. After all if it wasn&rsquo;t for white oppression, a black woman would have made the flight around the world in the 1920s in a plane invented by two black brothers Obama and Willis Left.</p>

		<p>This stems from the same sentiment as the myths about Black inventions and the book about Black Egyptians who could fly and move heavy objects using only their powerful minds. Somebody wanted to do something to make Blacks feel less inferior to fully evolved human beings so they looked around for a great Black achievement or a Black hero to crow about and all they came up with was the guy that invented flip-flops made out of two liter soda bottles and OJ. At that point desperation forced them to the revise reality.</p>
<p>This is nothing new. Afro-centrists turned Alexander and Cleopatra black in the early 1970&rsquo;s. You also still find a Black every once in a while who will argue that the first president of the U.S.A. was Black.</p>
<p>When you think about it during a moment of kindness it is easy to understand why Blacks are so determined to revise their history. Think how you would feel if the entire history of your people amounted to little more than a long, monotonous tale of huts, cannibalism and failure. </p>
<p>If I came from that world I would not only want Greek Queens and Norse gods to be Black, I would want all of the Valkyries to be big-legged KFC-eating sisters. If you are going to dream, DREAM BIG.</p>
<p>We Whites are going to have to turn down those IQ&rsquo;s and get in step with the new reality or we will get left out in the cold when they elect a Black wrestler for president and start watering the crops with Gator-aid? </p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine that anyone who produces plays or movies that are traditionally European, depicting white culture, white societies, etc., could be preserved for very long when cast with players that are blatantly impossible either traditionally, historically, or culturally.  So it must be that the real intent of this sort of cultural redefining is to destroy it. </p>

<p>If Jackson&rsquo;s upcoming version of JRR Tolkien&rsquo;s, The Hobbit has blacks and asians in it, I expect the Tolkien estate will issue a loud protest, even though they sold the movie rights decades ago to Saul Zaentz.  I will certainly boycott it and I expect there will be a boycott movement of huge proportions. </p>

Not that it matters; these pieces and all like them are wholly prefabricated, and once Mo D. and the SPLC are mentioned (why exactly is this shakedown outfit the final word on &#8220;hate groups?&#8221;) you know everything that&rsquo;s coming.</p>

<p>So! you believe Cleopatra was black! Rome would never have accepted that, nor do I or any other right thinking student of history. The ancient Egyptians may not have been super capable artists, but they DID KNOW COLOR! Egyptians are NOT depicted as black, blacks ARE depicted in their art, but NOT AS ROYALTY! Perhaps those blacks were the heretofore unknown black signators of the Declaration of Independence Glenn Beck seems to have found.</p>

		<p>Jay, you seem to be forgetting that afrocentrist also claim the ancient Greeks were black. Lol. Its always amazing to me how 12-19% of the population has forced its way to the disproportionate representation they have. I really would like to see a version of Roots with all the slave owners in the south depicted by black men. It wouldnt be any more far fetched or unrealistic than the rest of what Hollywood gives us constantly. </p>

<p>Seriously people, it&rsquo;s time we put these marxist invented terms on their heads. I used not to use the above terms and still don&rsquo;t. I suggest that when confronted by the above &#8216;ism&rsquo; and &#8216;phobia&rsquo; terms, swap the &#8216;ism&rsquo; for &#8216;phobia&rsquo; and the &#8216;phobia&rsquo;<br>
for &#8216;ism&rsquo;. <br>
For instance, I got a great laugh from my work-mates the other day when responding to some remark about &#8216;homophobia&rsquo;, I asked, &#8216;why isn&rsquo;t &#8216;homophobia&rsquo;,&rsquo;homoism&rsquo; and how come &#8216;racism&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t &#8216;race-o-phobia&rsquo;?<br>
Just a thought.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not one upset about Thor being black. Maybe cause I don&rsquo;t care too much for Thor or because I&rsquo;m afraid of the politically correct crowd, but to say the obvious&hellip; when it is a minority being portrayed by a white actor, those who oppose it are given a serious look and aren&rsquo;t called minority supremacists, and the entities behind the switch are portrayed as racists and it is they who must apologize or make excuses. In a way the the interest in black thor on the part of whites is a testament to the power of these minority special interest groups and the &#8216;complicit&rsquo; media but it seems as though if you&rsquo;re white you&rsquo;re always the racist no matter what.</p>
<p>Yes, there&rsquo;s always an intellectual brouhaha if it is a white actor getting the role - except of course in a made for TV movie or on Lifetime television in one of those &#8216;based on a true story&rsquo; movies. Because then it&rsquo;s Ok to have a white actor portraying a person of color. </p>

<p>Funny, isn&rsquo;t it, how the media thinks there&rsquo;s no such thing as a &#8220;black supremacist&#8221; or a &#8220;brown supremacist,&#8221; yet even the most tepid signs of White identity are &#8220;White Supremacy?&#8221;</p>

		<p>It is good to see we are not the only ones insulted by this blasphemy and defilement of historical integrity. I for one will (like most people here) not see the film, and I will strongly discourage my friends and family to see it. Heimdall is a good of the Germanic pantheon, about as far from African as you can get.  He was the fairest of the gods and to portray him as an African is nothing short of insanity. They might as well have a woman play Wodin too! I mean, it should affect the story, right? While they are at it, perhaps portraying a Shinto deity with a Western actor would not hurt.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
Our ancestors worshipped and believed in the gods, investing their hopes, dreams, fears, etc in them and making them an inseparable part of their daily lives. Elements survived even after Christianization and were a source of pride for hundreds of years; it is uniquely Germanic and only Germanic.  Africans played no role, and will never play any role in the Germanic mythology and any attempt to change that is a pathetic self-denial of the unchangeable differences that exist between races.<br>

		<p>One day the media will figure out that citing or quoting the SPLC as a legitimate authority (on anything but venality) doesn&rsquo;t legitimize the SPLC, it de-legitimizes themselves.  I hope it takes them a long, long time.</p>

		<p><i>This has become popular, retconning characters to make them more &ldquo;diverse&rdquo;. In my opinion, it is insulting to the target audience. It&rsquo;s saying, &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t be bothered to take the time and effort to create an interesting character of your race for you to enjoy, so we&rsquo;ll just take a popular one and change it for you.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Indeed, it&rsquo;s insulting to the target audience, and lazy.  It&rsquo;s also underhanded, because they know they&rsquo;ll have a harder time launching a new non-white character than they will forcing their white audience to either &#8220;suck it up&#8221; and tolerate a character they follow going non-white, or stop buying the magazine.</p>

		<p>Shaka Zulu&rsquo;s Bio:</p>
<p>1.  His parents were engaged in frottage as the male was escorting the little princess to some destination or another through the bush and &#8216;having gone a little deep&rsquo; he of course refused to admit that he had impregnated her.  Said it was &#8216;i-shaka&rsquo;, an intestinal parasite that messes with female menstruation.  Nine months later, his daughter ruined as chattel, the male was told by the local tribal chief to come get his woman and the little shaka she had just whelped.</p>
<p>2.  After a short sojourn in daddy&rsquo;s camp, Shaka and Mom were thrown out.  Shaka spent the next 10 years wandering from tribe to tribe, until he found his place in the suicide corps of the king.  Apparently &#8216;a natural athlete&rsquo;, rather than master the art of maneuver and feint with thrown spears, Shaka preferred the scream-and-leap method of attack and was successfuly only because he was big enough to strip off all the &#8216;armor&rsquo; (feathers and braided animal tails) to run really quick into the enemy lines with a new kind of stabbing spear.  Taught his crew to behave just like him and since tribal warfare in Africa of the time generally brought the whole tribe along as a camp followers, once Shaka and his gallant men were through the front ranks, it was pell mell for the women, children and old folk in the back too.  Introducing genocide and &#8216;no quarter&rsquo; to Africa for the Africans.  The Zulu king liked this kind of no-nonsense warfare (what he could see of it, leading from under the shade of a banyan tree, waaaaay back) and hereafter, he made Shaka his chief warleader with an entire Impe brigade of his own.  Shaka gleefully spent most of his twenties running down and genocidally annihilating the tribes which had &#8216;dissed him&rsquo; and momma for being, you know, (whisper) illegitimate.</p>
<p>Having succeeded to kingship himself, Shaka continued his policy of annihilation (entire Impe&rsquo;s of warriors, cut down after their surrender) while developing such wonderful fetishes as opening the bellies of pregnant Zulu women to study the developmental stages of their fetuses.  Eventually recognizing his madness, the Zulu got rid of the ol&rsquo; boy but only after having gained the eternal emnity of tribes like the Xhosa whose hatred of the Zulu extends even today, in South Africa.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t an all-black, all-the-time, movie be made about this &#8216;great man&rsquo;?  I flat out guarantee you that: NO WHITE WOULD MIND IF THERE WERE NO WHITES IN THE FILM.  Oh, but you say that nobody would come to see such a movie except blacks?  And blacks only number 13% of the population in North America?  And that would ruin the popularity of the film?</p>
<p>Then why are we pandering to people whose penchant for barbarism, as illustrated by another great storytelling opportunity: the Knoxville Horror, hasn&rsquo;t changed all that much?</p>
<p>No whites want to be associated with real black history.  We simply don&rsquo;t have the stomach for it.  We just want our own, to be ours to own.  Why is it that blacks can&rsquo;t be proud of themselves enough to stop trying to coopt what they never did?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t black self esteem supposed to be so incredibly high because of all that testosterone?</p>

		<p><i>They neither understand the concept of &ldquo;integrity&rdquo; nor of &ldquo;boundaries&rdquo; because they have neither, and they both go together.</i></p>
<p>No, they understand boundaries perfectly.  That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;ll never see &#8220;Fiddler on the Roof&#8221; as a warm tale about a Christian family, or a warm comedy set on an antebellum plantation, a &#8220;Mississippi Burning&#8221; set in Rhodesia with whites in white hats and blacks in black hats, or a slew of big budget films casting Palestinians as downtrodden but morally-superior victims.  Or T&rsquo;Challa or Storm as Europeans.</p>
<p>The patterns are far to consistent to be owed to a simple disrespect of boundaries; there are way too many boundaries being observed and respected for me to believe that.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m filling this in quickly and will read the above shortly: Anyway, as  far as I can tell, going from some of the comments on youtube, it isnt  just white supremacists. Even a few black people and the mainstream fans also (both black and white).But of course once you tar something  &#8216;white&rsquo; or supremacist,&rsquo; &#8216;far right&rsquo; and &#8216;white&rsquo; this or &#8216;white&rsquo; that then the debate becomes  infected and the debate over before its begun.Seems to me the real white supremacists are the  white liberal  intellgentsia for always believing they know better in how to  make black people feel as good as being white. &#8216;Affirmative Action&rsquo;,ridiculously inaccurate parts from white mythology and history  sagas, brain surgeons and  space scientists in science fiction dramas, always the heroes saving the poor  dumb whites in action and/or comedy dramas&hellip; the good and clever guys  these days must nearly always be black. I think it&rsquo;s called over compensating. A reversal of the realities and facts. You know the picture by now. </p>
<p>  Btw, Kenneth Brannagh is the ex husband of  Emma Thompson, she who it was adopted a black (illegal) immigrant  street walker and  put him through university and then criticised the university for being too white or  not taking on more black students and keeping &#8216;her son&rsquo; from feeling properly belonging. </p>

		<p>I was just reading the comments on the Guardian&rsquo;s posting, and just&hellip;what incredible idiots. It is disgusting, and chilling, to see how how easily, how <i>certainly</i>, any sort of logical consistency goes out the window when these leftist fools are informed or have suggested to them that something, a casting choice in this case, has to do with, or is an expression of, racial meaning&hellip;the Racial Front in the Progressive War.</p>
<p>When The Last Airbender uses White actors for fictional characters that they consider Asian&hellip;oh my God, TANTRUM! RACEBENDING! HOLLYWOOD IS RACIST! BOYCOTT! AAAAAAAAAAAH!</p>
<p>When Thor uses a black actor for an unambiguously White fictional character, well, it&rsquo;s just a fictional character, skin color is irrelevant. Acting ability is paramount; it&rsquo;s not like, you know, there are plenty of White actors that could do an equal or better job. Comic book heroes are in constant flux, you know, so this isn&rsquo;t really out of place, never mind this character has never ever been Black and is based on a distinctly white mythology. What reason is there <i>not</i> to use a Black actor? It&rsquo;s not like you should, you know, have a reason to <i>change</i> something instead of a reason <i>not to change</i> it. Well, actually, Heimdall is a God so he can transform himself into any shape he wants, so&hellip;<i>blah blah blah blah blah</i>, on endlessly with the absurd exceptions, the absurd contortions!</p>
<p>This is actually a boon for us, though. The hopeless fools will be hopeless fools and eat this garbage up, but those believers of racial orthodoxy with a bit of sense   &mdash;   those who have as yet had no reason to doubt what is said about &#8220;racists&#8221; and &#8220;neo-nazis&#8221; and &#8220;white supremacists&#8221;   &mdash;   will feel alienated when their sensible defense of White Heimdall is pooh-poohed, and begin to realize that there is something profoundly <i>wrong</i> with the thinking of mainstream leftism&hellip;or rather, mainstream thought period, regardless of political bent. Really, having done a quick search for Internet responses to this issue, I can already see this occurring   &mdash;   a response here and there by people who consider themselves one of the group, saying &#8220;I&rsquo;m no racist, but it&rsquo;s just stupid to have [insert black hobbits, black Batman, black whatever]&#8221;, followed by stupid responses and a futile argument. Reminds me of me, when I was naive enough not to realize what a grievous sin such thought was, and spoke it with no doubt that I would find agreement amongst my &#8220;kin&#8221;.</p>

		<p>They do it because they can.  If stupid whites would not flock to anything anti-our-culture and cheer, but rather boycott the whole thing, it would soon be over, a financial loss. But they won&rsquo;t, and the five people here and there in white organisations don&rsquo;t amount to a hill of beans. <br>
Stupid whites are getting what is coming to them. Most of all I dislike the stupidity and ignorance of the white population. that is more despicable and pitiful than the baseless arrogance of the colored folks.  <br>

		<p>Okay, we&rsquo;ve got self-hating white liberals running the entertainment industry from A-Z, so why is anyone surprised or shocked when minorities are cast in the most improbable, ridiculous roles imaginable?  Since these loony leftist jerks hate their own white race, it naturally follows that they will do everything possible to portray minorities as being really superior to, or, at the very least, equal to the despised whites.<br>
Makes you want to run out and see every politically correct movie now playing, right?</p>

		<p>Last year I was at a military camp, where I was forced to drive a car with a black policeman? who such illiterate and smart as the dumb-bells. Still one day he shocked me by mentioning names of Bach, Haydn, Mozart. I almost lost my speech, finally I asked that connoisseur what of their works he liked listening to. He told me that he knew none of their music; however, he just loved them because they were blacks. Of course with my Russian education I started to bring up names of the greatest on Earth poets, composers, philosophers, writers, and so on. <br>
All of them& Listen! ALL OF THEM in his twilight space between the two ears under his scull happened to be ni&hellip; sorry African-Americans?! Yes, you have heard me right   &mdash;   African-Americans?! Even Russian czars!</p>
