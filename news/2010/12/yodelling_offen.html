			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Austrian Times, November 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An Austrian has been fined for yodelling while mowing his lawn, according to a report.</p>
<p>The Kronen Zeitung newspaper claims Helmut G. was told by a court in Graz, Styria, that his yodelling offended his next-door Muslim neighbours.</p>
<p>The men reportedly accused the 63-year-old of having tried to mock and imitate the call of the Muezzin. The daily paper writes the Austrian was fined 800 Euros after judges ruled he could have tried to offend them and ridicule their belief. The Muslims, whose nationalities were not revealed by the report, were right in the middle of a prayer when the Austrian started to yodel.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not my intention to imitate or insult them. I simply started to yodel a few tunes because I was in such a good mood&#8221; the man told the newspaper today.<br>

		<p>So infuriating it really doesn&rsquo;t need a comment besides I can&rsquo;t blame the Muslims who are so stupid that they as a religion have never done anything positive for the world, I have to blame this dangerous lunatic of a judge and his white guilting buddies around the world</p>

		<p>Note the Moslem is allowed to remain unknown. Why is he afraid?<br>
    Yodelling deos not sound like the muezzin call. That sounds like a pig in heat. Yodeling is very pleasant and a joy to listen to.</p>

		<p>I didn&rsquo;t know people still yodelled. And from what I have heard of yodelling, perhaps it should be a crime.</p>
<p>But it can&rsquo;t be worse than the caterwauling and braying sounds of the Muslim call to prayer.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a thought: maybe the Austrians should yodel in Austria and the Muslims should wail and pray in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Pakistan.</p>

		<p>If Mr. Muslim was so offended by his neighbors Yodeling then he should move back to whatever Muslim country he came from.  Please note however that Mr. Muslim wouldn&rsquo;t be able to take a breath of Austrian air nor would Mr. Yodeler have been fined if the  traitorous Bankster owned puppet government of Austria didn&rsquo;t want it to happen that way. </p>

		<p>We here on my camp are now subjected to prayers played from loudspeakers at each end of the camp and I am probably more offended by that then muslims are by yodeling, and the FN prayers are done 5 times a day at scattered times so one never gets totally to sleep.</p>

		<p>Having worked in countries with a high proportion of muslims I can tell you there is nothing more &#8220;offensive&#8221; and annoying than being incessantly wocken at 5am by a call to prayers.  Other local religions, simply have to put up with it.  These people are often permanently stupified by inadaquete sleep, which explains quite a lot.</p>

		<p>I think its quite charming that when an Austrian is in a good mood he wants to yodel. If I was on holiday in Austria, this is exactly the kind of &#8216;diversity&rsquo; I would wish to see/hear.<br>
But of course when the left speak of diversity what they imagine is a world full of mulattos cowering beneath some hybrid of Equality legislation and Islamic law.</p>
