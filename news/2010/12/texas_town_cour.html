<h1><a href="https://www.fanhouse.com/2010/11/22/texas-town-courts-fail-cheerleader/">Texas Town, Courts Fail Cheerleader</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Whitley, AOL Sports, November 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>She is identified by her real name now, Hillaire. But after almost 21 months she still can&rsquo;t bring herself to say somebody else&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Hillaire was a cheerleader, yelling for her high school basketball team in a Texas town. A player went to shoot a free throw. Hillaire knelt in silence.</p>
<p>The player had been arrested for allegedly raping her four months earlier. Temporarily cleared of the charge, Rakheem Bolton was back on campus. Because of that, school officials told Hillaire to cheer for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was not going to do it,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Hillaire was kicked off the team. She filed a lawsuit, which an appeals court recently rejected. She had no right to remain silent.</p>
<p>Her defiance has become the non-cheer heard &#8216;round the world. TV networks, magazines and blogs have weighed in on what happened in Silsbee, Texas. An online petition demanding the school officials apologize has gathered 16,270 signatures, more than twice the population of the East Texas town.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As to why, that&rsquo;s where the answers get elusive. Bolton was a football star. He is black and Hillaire is white.</p>
<p>Those factors inevitably played into this small-town drama. Whatever your views on race and jock entitlement, there&rsquo;s not much disagreement over how everything started.</p>
<p>Hillaire went to a party at the home of Silsbee High student Brian Riley in September 2008. She got drunk and started flirting. She went into a game room with four boys, including Bolton and another football player, Christian Rountree.</p>
<p>The police report said that after a few minutes, party-goers heard a cry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop! Seriously, stop it. No!&#8221;</p>
<p>They banged on the locked door but nobody answered. Riley kicked in the door. Others followed him in.</p>
<p>They found one boy standing by a bathroom door. Hillaire was under the pool table. She was sobbing and partially clothed from the waist up.</p>
<p>The bathroom window had been broken out. On the floor next to the pool table were some shorts, socks and tennis shoes.</p>
<p>Riley and others went outside to look around. They saw Rountree down the street talking on a cell phone. Then Bolton came out of some nearby woods.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&rsquo;t rape no white girl. I wouldn&rsquo;t use anyone else&rsquo;s (d  &mdash;  ) to (f  &mdash;  ) her,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t know if she has AIDS. I don&rsquo;t even know that girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>Riley&rsquo;s mother, Stacy, was holding a garbage bag containing the clothes. Bolton demanded it and lunged at her. He was held back, but Stacy Riley tossed the bag in the driveway.</p>
<p>Bolton grabbed it and headed for a car. Before pulling away, he turned and gestured as if he had a gun in his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;All you (m  &mdash;    &mdash;  f  &mdash;    &mdash;  ) better be locked and loaded,&#8221; he screamed. &#8220;None of you better sleep tonight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bolton was arrested and charged with sexual assault of a minor. He got out on bail but had to attend an alternative educational facility until a grand jury heard the case.</p>
<p>Silsbee High School had lost one of its top defensive players. One of the Tigers&rsquo; top cheerleaders went into rape counseling.</p>
<p>The counselor advised Hillaire to forge ahead at school, since it&rsquo;s important to regain a sense of control. She said school officials told her to avoid the lunchroom and not to attend the next week&rsquo;s Homecoming festivities.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were threats against me,&#8221; Hillaire said. &#8220;If I was there, they were going to shoot me.&#8221;</p>
<p>She went anyway. No bullets were fired, but over the next few weeks she took plenty of verbal shots. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bolton returned to Silsbee High. School officials had no choice about that. They hoped both factions would move on, but rape accusations aren&rsquo;t exactly Let-Bygones-Be-Bygones material.</p>
<p>Bolton&rsquo;s supporters felt he&rsquo;d been made a scapegoat; Hillaire was routinely called a &#8220;slut.&#8221;</p>
<p>A group of Bolton&rsquo;s friends and family were in the stands at the first basketball game where she refused to cheer. Hillaire&rsquo;s family attended the next game. A loud confrontation ensued. Both sides blamed the other.</p>
<p>Again, those particulars are open to interpretation. What happened on the gym floor is relatively clear.</p>
<p>Hillaire participated in all the routines. She cheered when Bolton made plays that helped the Tigers. But when he was fouled and went to the free-throw line, she would not join the designated cheer.</p>
<p>At halftime, she was told to cheer or leave. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The cheerleader&rsquo;s conduct at the game caused a significant disruption,&#8221; SISD attorney Tanner Hunt wrote in an e-mail to me.</p>
<p>The cheerleader&rsquo;s side agrees there was a disruption. As to who caused it, Bain wasn&rsquo;t so definitive when Craig pressed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&rsquo;re saying Hillaire is creating that situation?&#8221; Craig asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I didn&rsquo;t say Hillaire,&#8221; Bain said. &#8220;I said the whole thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well it appears to be,&#8221; Craig said. &#8220;If she doesn&rsquo;t cheer for him, then situations occur. So basically what&rsquo;s being said is her not cheering for him is what&rsquo;s causing the animosity among the stands.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Craig then went to Lokey&rsquo;s office, where they were joined by cheerleader adviser Sissy McInnis. She said the girls had been told at practice that they had to cheer for every player. Craig noted that Hillaire had been at counseling, not practice.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More than a half-dozen witnesses  &mdash;  most Silsbee High students  &mdash;  said Bolton had threatened to shoot them. Yet SISD officials didn&rsquo;t deem that worth investigating. How could they form &#8220;reasonable belief&#8221; when they hadn&rsquo;t even bothered to read about the incident?</p>
<p>&#8220;Eight or 10 students have police statements that he threatened to shoot them. And apparently that isn&rsquo;t enough to keep a uniform off him,&#8221; Craig said. &#8220;But the fact my daughter won&rsquo;t cheer for him is enough?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Was it race? Silsbee is about one-third African-American. The NAACP had taken an interest in the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hillaire was collateral damage,&#8221; Craig said. &#8220;It was easier to fight one family than the NAACP and the entire community.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The cheerleader is white. The boy is black. The school board is all-white,&#8221; Hunt wrote. &#8220;All the administrators are white. The idea that, in this deep East Texas community, the African-American boy would receive preferential treatment over the white girl is difficult to comprehend, and is without basis.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whatever the motivating factors, Hillaire sued the school district in May 2009. She claimed it had violated her rights to equal protection and freedom of speech.</p>
<p>The case was dismissed twice, and Hillaire appealed. On Sept. 16, 2010, a three-judge panel ruled that her First Amendment rights had not been violated.</p>
<p>&#8220;(Hillaire&rsquo;s) act constituted a substantial interference with the work of the school,&#8221; the panel ruled, &#8220;because, as a cheerleader, (Hillaire) was at the basketball game for the purpose of cheering, a position she undertook voluntarily.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In November 2009 a second grand jury reinstated the charges against Bolton and Rountree. A plea agreement reduced the charge to Class A misdemeanor assault. The case against Rountree is still pending, but Bolton pleaded guilty in September.</p>
<p>The end result: school officials may not have been telling Hillaire to cheer for her rapist. She was being told to cheer for her self-admitted assaulter.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bolton got a one-year suspended jail sentence, two years&rsquo; probation, a $2,500 fine, 150 hours community service and is required to attend anger-management classes.</p>
<p>But at least he has no hard feelings.</p>

								<h2>NAACP Protests Indictments in Cheerleader Case</h2>
						<p>The Jasper branch of the NAACP is protesting the indictments of two men charged with sexually assaulting a Silsbee High School cheerleader.</p>
<p>Last Tuesday the Hardin County grand jury indicted Rakheem Jamal Bolton, 18, and Christian Paul Rountree, 19, on charges of sexual assault of a child. Bolton is a senior at Silsbee High School and played football. Rountree graduated last year and also played football.</p>
<p>The protestors {snip} questioned why the grand jury returned indictments when a previous grand jury chose not to indict the pair. The NAACP also said it believed the grand jury didn&rsquo;t hear from law enforcement officers, and members of the organization wondered if the grand jury heard enough evidence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last week, Barlow [David Barlow is the special prosecutor] told us the evidence the grand jury heard was compelling.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last Wednesday, Rakheem Bolton spoke with KFDM News and told us he&rsquo;s innocent.</p>

		<p>Football   &mdash;   Truly the opiate of the white American masses, especially the white Southern American masses.</p>
<p>Remember, Mychal Bell, of Jena, La. fame, got multiple last chances because he was a standout football player.  I think it was on the occasion of his seventh last chance that he and five of his cohorts violently assaulted a white student at the school.  At which point, the system gave him another last chance, because of course you wouldn&rsquo;t want to ruin such a promising football career, as a third-string running back at some junior college.</p>
<p>As for Miss Hillaire, I am not happy that she was raped (IMHO), nor any of the school-sponsored injustices against her in the aftermath.  But what did she think was going to happen when she drunk herself into a stupor at a high school party inside a house with a bunch of black football players?  Where were all their parents?  Again, since it&rsquo;s football, methinks the parents looked the other way.</p>

		<p>There was another case in Texas where the &#8220;elite&#8221; jocks killed a &#8220;goth&#8221; student because they did not like his looks.  The jury acquitted the jocks of all charges.  It seems that in Texas, a winning football team is more important than someone&rsquo;s life.</p>

		<p>While this is indeed a troubling situation, the fact is that Texas has had a long history of engaging in trumped up charges against Blacks. I remember the Tulia, Texas scandal in the early 1990s when corupt law enforcement officials,planted drugs on more than 60% of the townspeople and as a result, more than 300 people were arrested and wrongly prosecuted, including a 66 year old grandmother who served two years until a federal judge overturned all convictions and threw out the case. It was a disgrace of the first order.</p>
<p>I do not know if the young men in question are guilty or not, that is not the point I am making. What I am saying is that there may be more to the story than meets the eye. Being here in Texas, it was pretty much a he said/she said account of things. In reality, the truth probably lies somewhere in the middle. </p>
<p>If these young men are guilty, than they should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. If they are innocent then a grave injustice has taken place.</p>

		<p>I see whites drool over football players all the time.  I live in north Florida and am sick and tired of jaguar-painted faces and GATOR-everything madness!  Any white man that salivates over a black man running around in lycra shorts chasing a ball for severa million a year deserves everything they get when it comes to race.  Ditto for their women.</p>
<p>No sympathy here.  Hillaire should have resigned from the cheerleading squad along with every other white girl on it.  And the white trash on the school board needs to be replaced but won&rsquo;t be.  Oh, no, we can&rsquo;t do that, football is so important.  Obviously it trumps just about everything else in life, doesn&rsquo;t it?<br>

		<p> Why is it considered so &#8220;incomprehensible&#8221; that a black thug would receive preferential treatment over a White cheerleader by a virtually all-White school administration? We sports-mad Americans will cut a low-down black unlimited amounts of slack if he is a star athlete on OUR basketball or football team. It&rsquo;s happened before, and probably will again. It shouldn&rsquo;t happen when it&rsquo;s not justified, but it does.</p>
<p> Having said that, the cheerleader&rsquo;s case is made more ambiguous by the fact that she &#8220;got drunk,&#8221; &#8220;began flirting,&#8221; and entered another room with four boys. Not smart, my dear. Which does not in any way excuse rape, of course.</p>
<p> And it&rsquo;s true that the black&rsquo;s threats and other behavior should have been investigated, but were not, probably due to fear of the NAACP. That organization is long overdue to have its chops busted (legally, not physically) to break it of being the meddling intimidator it has been for many years. I predict that the day is coming. But it may be too late to help Hillaire any.</p>

<p><br>
Without addressing the rape aspects of this  case, I&rsquo;ll just address the football part. This is an example of the extravagant, absurd, lack of perspective held by many schools (and people) in large areas of the USA. They need to get their priorities straight.  These schools put sports ahead of education. Everything is sports.  They have lost sight of their fundamental mission   &mdash;    which is to <b>educate.</b> Not to throw a ball through a hoop, or to hit a ball with a stick. </p>
<p>While other countries forge ahead in education and technology, we are cheering for thick-necked athletes in tight spandex whom we place on pedestals and make millionaires. Nothing is too good for these &#8220;heroes&#8221;   &mdash;   not even our daughters.  Other nationalities must think we Americans are idiots. And sometimes I think they are right.</p>

		<p>I think the precedent that Hillaire should cite is that the US doesn&rsquo;t dip its flag at the opening ceremony of the Olympics to any ruler, because Hitler was at the 1936 Olympics and the US didn&rsquo;t want to pay homage to Hitler.</p>

<p><br>
Questions I&rsquo;d have for this &#8216;black detective&rsquo;:</p>
<p>1. If the country and system is so racist, how did you get a job here?  Really, it makes no sense how an entire system is against yet, allows you the opportunity to have a job.</p>
<p>2. Being a cop means you are to protect the citizens from criminals, yes?  You have a duty to protect all citizens  &mdash;  even if they are &#8216;racist whites  &mdash;  and you have a duty to prosectue all criminals, even if they are &#8216;oppressed blacks&rsquo;.</p>
<p>3. Even if everyone hates blacks, what does that have to do with a black man raping somebody?  There are a lot of persecuted people throughout this world, but they&rsquo;re not out raping, stealing, killing, and feeling sorry for themselves.</p>
<p>4. Did you, by any chance, get your job simply because you&rsquo;re black? You know, Affirmative Action?  If so, don&rsquo;t whine and complain about racial privilege for whites when you are benefitting off of being black.</p>

		<p>Dear God what have we wrought. What has happened to the Dear South? To the White Man&rsquo;s pride? Why do we let the Federal government force us to associate with Blacks? Why have we accepted integration like sheep being led to slaughter?<br>
Segregation was instituted to prevent just this kind of violence from happening to our people.</p>
<p>We should form private co-operatives to school our children. </p>
<p>We should throw our televisions out the window. The programing is nothing but perverted alien garbage out of Hollywood and New York. It systematically attacks our culture and traditions.</p>
<p>We must keep our children, whose minds and characters are not yet fully formed, safe from such debased influences.</p>
<p>Do we take any responsibility at all for the new members of our race who we have brought into this world?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that? I hear people say, &#8220;If we threw out the TV we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to watch football!&#8221; Well here&rsquo;s a newsflash my friends:</p>
<p>Whites can play football too. </p>
<p>We invented the game. </p>
<p>If we stop supporting the &#8220;public&#8221; schools and colleges that systematically favor Black athletes over Whites, if we pull our kids out from these unhealthful, integrated, institutions and so starve them of their funds, they won&rsquo;t long sustain themselves on rap noise and dim witted quarterbacks.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we&rsquo;ll be able to go to clean, well run, safe stadiums and watch our White kids play a good smart game of football.</p>
<p>By forming private educational co-operatives we can ensure that every White kid, no matter how poor, can get a quality education in a safe school.</p>
<p>Oh, and one other comment about the story of Miss Hillaire&rsquo;s tragic rape, it never would have happened if she had not been at a drinking party with Blacks. Did her parents allow it or did they not have proper control over a teenage daughter?<br>
What was she doing flirting with Blacks? How on Earth did they raise this girl?<br>
Utterly disgusting.<br>

		<p>&#8220;The player had been arrested for allegedly raping her four months earlier. Temporarily cleared of the charge, Rakheem Bolton was back on campus. Because of that, school officials told Hillaire to cheer for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>They knew he was guilty, but making money on sports was more important to them than assuring justice was served.  It is these types whose god is money and power that have deteriorated this society to the level it is right now&hellip;.and it&rsquo;s dropping very rapidly.  </p>
<p>Even the white rank and file is ready to give some criminal black a pass if he might be their favorite sports figure.  How many whites denigrated an unknown girl in favor of supporting Kobe Bryant after he obviously raped her?    </p>
<p>But incidents like this story reports pop up in the news repeatedly.  Having blacks in the population requires constant vigilance. Any white parents who do not council their teens to socially avoid blacks at all costs are just asking for incidents like these.  The lies told to students by radical leftist propagandists in the classroom have to be countered if a kid is going to go through the rest of his life with an awareness of what the real world is all about.</p>
<p>Note that the NAACP has no problem with supporting their average black rapist.  If he had committed murder they would have been just as vigorously behind him as they were behind Simpson for killing two white people and cheering when he got away with it, freed by a mostly all-black jury.</p>
<p>Note also that Simpson walked around for years prior to his last crime unmolested and untouched although there are few whites who do not understand that he was undoubtedly guilty. </p>
<p>This incident reveals the same kind of white cowardice.</p>

		<p>The way people in this country behave watching and following any kind of football says a lot about them.  Ditto for basketball and entertainment industry celebrities, who people idolize as if they were some kinds of gods.  Many of these celebrities have the morals of alley cats and some are even criminals, as is evident with these two &#8220;innocent&#8221; high school football players.</p>

		<p>Agree with poster one&rsquo;s comment concerning the whereabouts of Miss Hillaire&rsquo;s parents.  </p>
<p>Of course it&rsquo;s reasonable for parents to want their kids to enjoy the high school years. Girls aspire to cheerleader and boys to starting players.  But times have changed.  </p>
<p>Cheerleading has become merely early training for a white girl to begin her worship of black males and to see them as acceptable partners.  Don&rsquo;t movies and worthless TV ads such as the recent one for Lexus tell her that? </p>
<p>This girl&rsquo;s parents were missing in action.  Otherwise Miss Hillaire would have been engaged in something other than drinking and partying with black males. </p>
<p>My suspicion is that the parents will say something like, &#8220;It has nothing to do with race, he&rsquo;s just a bad boy.&#8221;  Sure! To show they are not racist, they&rsquo;ll put Obama stickers on their cars for 2012 to prove it. </p>
<p>A look at the two pictures tells it all.  She is pretty and alert and gives the impression of having intelligence.   while he is well&hellip;.dull and ugly. </p>
<p>The school administrators are the usual gutless bunch.  I suspect they are the normal run of the mill scared little white toadies always afraid to &#8220;offend&#8221;.  Better to make the white girl suffer than to offend a black who has committed a crime against her. Who does she think she is anyway? Doesn&rsquo;t she recognize a member of a superior race?  </p>
<p>Miss Hillaire learned a valuable lesson if she takes it to heart.  I give her A+ for courage.  May she marry well and have many beautiful white kids. </p>

<p>*********************<br>
And my suspicion is that you&rsquo;re right on all the above points. You have expressed my own opinions. </p>
<p>The bottom line is that ALL parties share in some of the guilt. This is not say that the footballer is not guilty.  But so are her parents, the school, and society in general. They did nothing to prepare her for something like this, doubtless teaching her that blacks (particularly athletes!) are wonderful, admirable human beings who should be catered to. And Hillaire herself is not without guilt for getting drunk, flirting, and going into a room alone with FOUR (!) black boys.  What did she think was going to happen there? .. a conversation about philosophy?</p>
<p>Hopefully, she has learned a valuable lesson that will protect her in the future   &mdash;    a lesson about human psychology and male biology: you don&rsquo;t start something that you&rsquo;re not prepared to finish. Once you get the locomotive roaring down the track, you can&rsquo;t stop it on a dime, just before the crossing,  when you scream &#8221; No! Stop!&#8221;   Sorry, it doesn&rsquo;t work that way. You don&rsquo;t wait until one second before midnight before yelling &#8220;STOP!&#8221;</p>
<p>In the future, Miss Hill, keep out of rooms with black boys. Don&rsquo;t go anywhere alone with them.  Don&rsquo;t drink, get drunk, or flirt in their presence.  Contrary to what society, TV, the magazines and your schools have told you,  nothing good will come of it.  And when something bad happens, they will give you no sympathy, as you have found.</p>

		<p>Maybe I am just an ignorant white boy because I don&rsquo;t understand how these people have so much power in a country that WE built?</p>
<p>1. Did the African revolt and rise up against their slaveholders to gain freedom OR did over 600,000 whites die in the Civil War to hand it to them on a silver platter?<br>
2. How do these INVADERS come from all over the world and start telling us (Americans) in our own country, how things will be done?<br>
3. How can these religions with verifiable histories of murder and other crime come to America and tell us to take down our Christmas tree as they Howl at the moon, excuse me I meant to say chant their prayers?<br>
4. Why are groups involved in the very same activities called guerrillas in one country but called a much softer sounding Gang in America? If we send Americans to die to help them clear up their guerrillas why do we expect police to perform a military matter in the control of gangs here?<br>
5. Why do we allow our own white race to sell us down the river in Washington by giving all we have attained to Invaders and Thugs?<br>
It&rsquo;s not these desperado&rsquo;s who take what they want it is our own kind Giving Them What The Want at our expense, with the idea of lining their own pockets in the process.<br>
6. Can ANYONE name one place controlled by blacks where it is even safe to walk the streets in broad daylight? Is it Detroit, Oakland, St. Louis, where is it? I don&rsquo;t know.<br>
Where in the United States has the living standard gone up and the crime rate gone down with the influx of blacks and Invaders, I am just asking because I Don&rsquo;t Know.<br>
7. These low lives think America the land of milk and honey is great because of it&rsquo;s real estate That is NOT the Case, America is great because of a certain group of highly intelligent and highly motivated people have up to now been in charge.<br>
8. What kind of a country do we now live in where $8.00 an hour perverts can feel up our 80 year old Granny if she wants to fly from San Diego to New York and arrest her if she protests the right of BIG BROTHER TO DO THIS? Wasn&rsquo;t this kind of how Hitler ran Germany when he gained power?</p>

		<p>To those of you who ask why this girl was around the blacks to begin with: </p>
<p>It is a legitimate question, to be sure, but I&rsquo;d like to offer a caricature that may help everyone see the situation more objectively: </p>
<p>The &#8220;cheerleader&#8221; is a traditionally white, female role.  Just like the white house-wife, the librarian and even the Catholic school-girl, the &#8220;cheerleader&#8221; has obtained a certain stigma that some respect and honor, and others seek to rape (literally, in this case.) </p>
<p>The average white girl in America wants to do her part in promoting society and &#8220;rooting for the home-team.&#8221;  Part of promoting this society is attending the parties and associating in the appropriate circles. </p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t fault the girl for this. </p>
<p>No, the fault lies with the those who have orchestrated this un-godly society where all social-norms have been redefined so that the races are intermixed and no longer seeking their collective benefits.  </p>
<p>When all notions of aristocracy, class-distinction and segregation are done away with, the desire of young-white girls to maintain themselves remains a healthy desire&hellip;like thirst remains a healthy physical desire. </p>
<p>But, like the thirsty man who gulps down poison, this, other-wise, healthy desire for society on the part of the white-girl leads to drastic consequences in our current system. </p>
<p>Segregate now!</p>

		<p><i>I do not know if the young men in question are guilty or not</i></p>
<p>  &mdash;  Seth</p>
<p>Yeah, how would anyone know when the case was handled like this:</p>
<p><i>A rape kit was assembled in October 2008 and DNA evidence collected, H.S. said, but she and her family were told that a backlog of cases meant it would be more than a year before processing got started.</i></p>
<p>Why do you think that might be?  Why the long delay?</p>
<p>This is the flip side of the Duke rape hoax:  Criminal black athletes receiving preference and advantages over their victim and cover from the school administration, the school principal, the superintendent, the assistant superintendent and the cheerleading official:</p>
<p><i>When she complained that she faced taunting chants by other students when she walked into the cafeteria, &#8216;they [school officials] said just stay out of the cafeteria,&rsquo; H.S. said in court documents.</i> </p>
<p>I read a lot of news and this was not mentioned anywhere on the West Coast, you can be sure if the races were reversed this would be National if not International news, as was the Duke rape hoax. (you remember that case, right?  White boys tried and convicted and vilified in the media and academia without a shred of evidence except the lies of a black prostitute.)</p>
<p>Massively Disproportionate black-on-White rape rates are not dissiminated anywhere except online (for now) even though figures from the justice dept. and FBI are not in dispute:</p>
<p>According to  Department of Justice document <i>Criminal Victimization in the United States</i>:</p>
<p><i>In the United States in 2005, 37,460 White females were sexually assaulted or raped by a black man, while between zero and ten black females were sexually assaulted or raped by a white man.</i></p>
<p><b>What this means is that every day in the United States, over one hundred white women are raped or sexually assaulted by a black man.</b></p>
<p>This is information that you will never see in the anti-White media or discussed in academia, you will receive no warning from the federal government, leaving our White daughters vulnerable to predatory black males.</p>
<p>YOU as a parent and as a concerned WHITE must tell everyone you know about black criminality, blacks who hunt Whites for rape, robbery, murder and mayhem, and the vile msm, academia and government that refuse to report about or, worse, dismiss black crime and brush off White victims.</p>
<p>It is obscene and loathsome.  And it will continue, and get worse.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think I don&rsquo;t tell these things to my beautiful blonde, blue-eyed 19-year old daughter, and you must too   &mdash;   your daughters, nieces, grandchildren, everyone you love and care about.  Spread The Word.  Be persistent over accusations of racism and nazism, you are correct, you have the facts on your side, keep hammering, it may take a long time to over come years of brainwashing, but you are correct and it may save your loved ones&rsquo; lives.</p>
<p>I do not want to sit in court, like Eve Carson&rsquo;s loved ones, screaming and crying my eyes out as the murderer/rapist of my daughter is afforded media silence and every break possible, and held up as a &#8216;victim&rsquo; of White Racism while my daughter is ignored if not vilified.</p>

		<p>There isn&rsquo;t really anything I can add here except to warn any white parents about sending their children to government schools.  Don&rsquo;t expect any sympathy if your children are victimized by blacks.  You will not get any.  Home school your children if at all possible.  If you can afford it, send them to a private school.  If you have a gifted child, find a wealthy conservative sponsor who will help school the child.   Keep your children away from blacks of any social level.</p>

		<p>That the NAACP and most other blacks come down automatically on the side of an obviously guilty black criminal tells us that blacks not only do not care if blacks commit crimes against whites they feel as if they should get off when they do.</p>
<p>A lot of black bias is rooted in stupidity.  They just don&rsquo;t have the mental faculties to understand fairness, except when they believe a black is a victim, which is usually always based in their own delusional thoughts.  </p>
<p>Whether they believe Devil&rsquo;s Food Cake is racist, just like a Black Hole in space, or that aids, drugs, etc., were introduced into black neighborhoods to kill them off or that whites blew up the levees in N.O., they all have one thing in common:  Strong indications of a propensity toward mental illness of one type or another in addition to low intellect.  That makes for an explosive, dangerous population, and that&rsquo;s exactly what we have in the black community today.</p>
<p>These people are still on the voodoo level.  Imaginary scenes and thoughts inundate their minds constantly and they can&rsquo;t be trusted to think and act reasonably. </p>

		<p>I agree with poster who alluded to American whites sick worship of the black athlete. At some point in the late 70s, schools gave up all pretense of sportsmanship and any notion of the student athlete. It&rsquo;s all about winning at any cost now. These schools bring in thugs who don&rsquo;t go to class and are at the heart of campus crime waves. The administrations of these schools don&rsquo;t care as long their teams are winning. I would not want my daughter or son to attend any major football or basketball school. You might as well send your child into south central Los Angeles or the south side of Chicago. </p>

<p>&#8220;Those of you who are interested in the topic of interracial rape should read Danielle McGuire&rsquo;s &#8216;At The Dark End Of The Street.&rsquo; It looks at the history of this troubling saga.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks for the tip on this book about white on black rape during the segregation era. It&rsquo;s apparently well researched and sourced, and here&rsquo;s the author&rsquo;s own brief account of it:</p>
<p>https://goo.gl/pg5j7</p>
<p>And an interview with her:</p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/HMavE" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/HMavE</a></p>
<p>Even before reading the book, I don&rsquo;t have any trouble believing that it&rsquo;s probably pretty much an accurate account, human nature being what it is and power relations in the segregated South being what they were when I grew up there.</p>
<p>But for some time now we&rsquo;ve been in a different era, in which the direction of the predation (if it were in fact mostly unidirectional before) has completely reversed. According to Dept. of Justice statistics in 2005, there were  virtually ZERO reported rapes/sexual assaults of blacks by whites, whereas blacks raped/sexually assaulted whites at several times the rate that whites did*:</p>
<p>(Scroll down to Table 42):</p>
<p><a href="/content/pub/pdf/cvus05.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/cvus05.pdf</a></p>
<p>So. Since I did pretty much all my guilt a long time ago, it doesn&rsquo;t impress me at all if my race may have acted about as nastily in the past as any other race holding power has. What concerns me is what is being done to me and my race today and likely will be done to us in the future as our power wanes even further. Those DOJ stats tell that tale.</p>
<p>*There is a very strange change in the sexual assault figures in Table 42 from 2005 to 2007!</p>
<p>For the 2007 data, scroll down to Table 42 here:</p>
<p><a href="/content/pub/pdf/cvus0702.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/cvus0702.pdf</a></p>
<p>For simplicity, let&rsquo;s reasonably assume that the victims are almost entirely women, percentage-wise.</p>
<p>From the 2005 table: <br>
Total rapes/sexual assaults of white women: 111,490<br>
 % of those attacks committed by whites: 44.5 %<br>
% of those attacks committed by blacks: 33.6%</p>
<p>From the 2007 table: <br>
Total rapes/sexual assaults of white women: 185,430<br>
 % of those attacks committed by whites: 75.5%  (compare with figure for 2005!!)<br>
 % of those attacks committed by blacks: 7.6%  (compare with figure for 2005!!!)</p>
<p>In two years, the percentage of rapes of white women that were committed by BLACKS dropped from 33.6%, to 7.6% ?????!!!!!</p>
<p>And the percentage of rapes of white women that were committed by WHITES rose from 44.5%, to 75.5% ??!!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so!</p>
<p>But notice the great increase in absolute number of rapes of white women, from 111,490 in 2005, to 185,430 in 2007, an increase of over 50%.</p>
<p>That makes me suspect that for 2007, the data for Hispanics was merged with the data for whites. Ah yes, notice the great decrease in the numbers for perps under the category &#8220;Other,&#8221; from 19.6% in 2005, to 3.8% in 2007! The Hispanic perps in that category may have been moved to the white category. And considering the great number of Hispanic on Hispanic rapes that probably occur, that tremendously skews the data for &#8220;whites&#8221; in 2007. Wow, what a sleight of hand!</p>
<p>But notably, the white on black rape rate is STILL virtually ZERO, in both years. (There&rsquo;s not venough Hispanic on black rapes to raise that figure).</p>
<p>If you lasted through all that, I hope you think it was worth it. I do, because it&rsquo;s a case study of the many smokescreens that are laid down about race.</p>

  &mdash;   BON<br>
__  __  __  __  __  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not hard to guess what race those taunts and chants were coming from. Of course it would never, never be mentioned by our &#8220;race-neutral&#8221; media, but you just KNOW those weren&rsquo;t white kids. No more so than those happy people cheering the OJ Simpson verdict all over the USA, were white people.</p>
<p>This is not unusual.  I once worked in a large bank where a black West Indian male employee followed a beautiful young white woman into the supply room and molested or tried to rape her there. I was the first one who went in and found her sobbing hysterically. I had no idea  what had happened. I assumed she had just learned of a death in her family (she refused to talk about it and begged me to just go away) but I reported that she was in distress.  </p>
<p>When the first news of this rape attempt leaked out (immediately after it happened, and the parties weren&rsquo;t yet known) the black women in my division [many of them West Indians] were all outraged and indignant, and were completely  on the unknown  victim&rsquo;s side (assuming she was probably black like them) against this foul rapist pervert. (I stayed out of it and said <i>nothing </i>about who she was.)  </p>
<p>When it was  then learned a short while later that it happened to this lovely blonde girl, and that, furthermore,  the assailant was a black man, a West Indian, the blacks   &mdash;   especially the  women   &mdash;   all INSTANTLY reversed their positions and began defending him as the helpless victim of a set-up, and calling her a slut and a tramp who had  obviously lured him in there on purpose. They said they always knew &#8220;what she was&#8221;   &mdash;   just by the way she looked, the way she walked. She had been trolling for a black man. They just knew it.</p>
<p>This instantaneous turnabout was truly amazing to see,  and I have never forgotten it. It was part of my education! I learned that a white women attacked by a black man will never be considered  right or honest in the eyes of other blacks. To them, she is automatically wrong   &mdash;   a liar and a hussy. In their view, basically,  she had been looking for it and she got what she deserved. And they were GLAD of it! </p>
<p>Incredibly, the bank declined to prosecute him or fire him. They also asked her to please not press charges, and asked if she would be satisfied with an apology. She refused and left. He remained!</p>

Thank you, Mr. Dumpty. Very interesting!  I once supervised the preparation of crime statistics in a certain large PD, and I can tell you that there were all sorts of political pressures involved and all sorts of ways of manipulating the stats.</p>

		<p>I am almost certain if the rapist had been white the same thing would have happened. With football mad areas like Texas star players can get away with just about anything and nobody in charge will do anything about it. The girl was very brave in my opinion for bucking the system and I am not a bit surprised with the end result. Thuggish black players often end up in nearly all white schools since integration, especially since football players are often allowed to transfer simply to play a game that they will probably never play again after high school. </p>

		<p>It was very poor judgment for this girl to get drunk and then be alone with four young males; however, this does not justify rape, because no still means no.  The alleged rapist was temporarily cleared of the charges? Rape is a pretty big crime; to allow the alleged perpetrator to roam around freely until things get settled is extremely inappropriate. And to punish the girl because she would not cheer for the individual that she said raped her is absurd.  If she did cheer, wouldn&rsquo;t the defense point out, as circumstantial evidence maybe,that she was cheering for him, thus was probably insincere or lying about the charges?  It sounds like yet another case of blaming the victim; but why should that matter as long as Silsbee has a better chance to win a game.</p>

<p>Even before reading the book, I don&rsquo;t have any trouble believing that it&rsquo;s probably pretty much an accurate account, human nature being what it is and power relations in the segregated South being what they were when I grew up there.</p>
<p>But for some time now we&rsquo;ve been in a different era, in which the direction of the predation (if it were in fact mostly unidirectional before) has completely reversed. According to Dept. of Justice statistics in 2005, there were virtually ZERO reported rapes/sexual assaults of blacks by whites, whereas blacks raped/sexually assaulted whites at several times the rate that whites did*:</p>

Harumpty Dumpty:Anonymous 9:16pm:</p>
<p>Thanks to both of you for informing me about this book. Harumpty, thank you as well for providing recent statistics that do demonstrate considerably more Black on White rape. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, I have to admit that I thought that even during the segregation era that White men raping Black women was virtually non-existent or was a trumped up myth at best. Now I realize that I was wrong. It was actually fairly commonplace, especially among middle and upper income White men. </p>

<p><i> I remember the Tulia, Texas scandal in the <b>early 1990s</b> when corupt law enforcement officials,planted drugs on more than <b>60% of the townspeople and as a result, more than 300 people were arrested</b> and wrongly prosecuted, including a 66 year old grandmother who served two years until a federal judge overturned all convictions and threw out the case. It was a disgrace of the first order.</i></p>
<p>Your figures are a bit off, the incident happened in 1999 and the town of Tulia has around 5,000 people, the number of people arrested was 46 (40 Blacks and 6 Whites..) but given that the town&rsquo;s Black population was so small, 1/3 of the adult Black population was basically rounded up. Not all of the defendants were found or plead guilty. 8 were let go and there was no planting of drugs&hellip; everything was based upon the sole testimony of one police officer. (Which is highly problematic for other reasons..) Gov. Rick Perry pardoned 35 of the 38 three years later. Given that Governor Perry didn&rsquo;t pardon everyone indicates to me that there were some drug dealing in that community but it was highly  exaggerated by a rogue cop who had little oversight. By the way the funding for this escapade was from the Federal government and was not initiated at the local level. Now you might ask yourself how hidden is the information about this incident&hellip; a special appeared on 60 minutes as well as 4 documentaries on the Tulia incident and there will soon be a feature film with Hallie Berry and Billy Bob Thornton. So it&rsquo;s not like Tulia was swept away or hidden from the world. Yes I would agree it was a miscarriage of justice but given the tremendous response.. I tend to think these miscarriages are not nearly as common as you seem to represent. </p>

<i>I do not know if the young men in question are guilty or not, that is not the point I am making. </i></p>
<p>The accused men have already plead guilty but to substantially lesser charges&hellip;they have expressed their satisfaction with the outcome. I guess they should.. they got away with rape. </p>

		<p>As an Englishman, I can tell you that American &#8216;Football&rsquo; does nothing for me, and is one of the most boring &#8216;sports&rsquo; ever invented. In fact, most British people look at American Football as a ridiculous pasttime, what with all the equipment and uniform that is necessary to play it. (Look at our rugby players who wear NO body armor or padding of any kind, and never have done.)</p>
<p>I totally agree with the posts above which say that sports worship has gotten way out of hand - your RACE comes before everything else, especially irrelevancies like &#8216;sport&rsquo;.</p>

<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t read the book and I&rsquo;m not going to.  Besides not wanting to waste my time on one more black fabrication, I think it&rsquo;s criminal to point out alleged white on black crimes without a last chapter pointing out black on white crime in recent times.</p>

<p>The book belongs right along side the ones reporting how aids/drugs/disease and the like were introduced into black neighborhoods by whitey to kill them off.</p>
<p>What I want to see is a book come out by a high profile figure brazenly reporting the rapes of white women by blacks, plus detailing all the black on white attacks that are occurring and identifying the people who are causing them to occur.</p>

<p>She teaches in a black studies dept., so that&rsquo;s a caution at the outset. Still, my initial reaction was that the topic she chose probably didn&rsquo;t require too much distortion. Just my sense of how power works. But your use of the word &#8220;commonplace&#8221; I think goes much too far. I never came across anyone when I was growing up in the segregated South that I believe would have ever considered raping anyone.</p>

<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t that be wonderful, and your point is infinitely more important (to me and to you) than any point that the book I commented on could make, or any point I made in my post.</p>
<p>But it also bothers me tremendously how easily our movement or any other movement slides into distortion and dishonesty. In this particular case, I&rsquo;m not sure what the truth is, I just have a hunch. And no, I wouldn&rsquo;t think that black women were in nearly as much danger of being raped by white men under segregation as white women are in danger of being raped by black men now, and I thank you for pointing out that important difference. Also, there&rsquo;s no doubt this book will be and is being misused.</p>
<p>But this idea that&rsquo;s pervasive in the white nationalist movement that the white race is so MUCH more moral than other races I think is historically and contemporaneously absurd, and is ultimately a dangerous self-delusion. We may in fact be more moral, but our movement exaggerates that difference.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a white nationalist not because I think the white race is God&rsquo;s gift to the universe (though in many ways it has been), but because I&rsquo;m white.</p>

		<p>Indeed, &#8220;Where are the Feminists on this one?&#8221;<br>
But since Feminism has devolved into an AA racket, it is dead.  Biology and psychology (often the same) obliterated their foundation.<br>
The other question is where are women (&gt;51%of world pop.) on this?  <br>
I remember a 70&rsquo;s quote by a prominent Pshychiatrist that roughly said<br>
&#8220;Feminism will create a lot of unhappy women and happy men.&#8221;<br>
It seems that the biggest thing Feminism succeeded in was encouraging women to become as degenerate as men.<br>
Another partial exchange I remember was between a prominent Feminist and a powerful male opponent. After landmark legislation<br>
was passed, and her opponent rolled, she asked (again roughly) &#8220;did your side really come to believe in our position, or were you just too tired and weak to defend your own.&#8221;<br>
I think that revealed an age-old dynamic between males and females.  Feminist appear to have more hatred towards the culture that allowed women opportunity than cultures that brutilize them.<br>
Are genes are very old. A man, tribe or race that does not protect it&rsquo;s females&hellip; </p>

		<p>Not all white Americans worship black athletes and devote all their time to sports. I despise both, and one major reason for that is the fact that thugs of all races dominate high school sports and the fact they are allowed to get away with just about anything. One thing white Americans can do to save their daughters from monsters like the one who raped this cheerleader is to refuse to worship sports and black athletes and teach their daughters and sons too that non-whites are a mortal enemy, blacks especially.</p>

______________________________</p>
<p>Very  valid comments!  I want to add that one of the greatest problems with our people (as Mr. Humpty demonstrates)  is the desire of many to bend over backwards to be ultra, ultra fair and to give the other side every possible benefit of the doubt (by saying &#8220;probably pretty accurate&#8221;). That is very decent of them, but it is fatally self-defeating. Sometimes they overdo it! And that&rsquo;s at the heart of many of our present problems. We give and give (every benefit of doubt), while they take and take, and laugh their way through the court system.</p>
<p>Would blacks do the same for us?  Never! Not a chance of it. For them, any white is automatically guilty. For them, we are ALL guilty. They do not have the same extreme concern with justice and  fairness. For them, out skin is our badge of guilt.</p>
<p>And yes, we need to identify the people who are responsible for  causing this.</p>

No means no.  That&rsquo;s the standard thing the feminists all say.  However, as another poster said above, you don&rsquo;t yell &#8220;No!&#8221; one second before midnight.  In other words, <b>Don&rsquo;t start something that you&rsquo;re not prepared to finish.</b> If you do, you are responsible for your actions.</p>
<p>She was a teaser.  She got drunk, flirted, and got herself into this mess, and she bears a good part of the responsibility for it.  Im not saying she&rsquo;s the only one to blame, but I&rsquo;m not saying she&rsquo;s entirely innocent either.  She went willingly into that room with four boys (probably all black).  It&rsquo;s not as if he grabbed her off the street and dragged her into the bushes. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a complex crime, with blame to go all around   &mdash;   including her parents and the school who allowed and  provided the set up for this sort of thing to happen.</p>

Ice, the woman who wrote the book is White. She has numerous police and court records that confirm that such activity did occur. Like Harumpty Dumpty stated, given the time frame we are discussing, I would find it hard to believe that White police officers, judges and other southern law enformcement would to use your term &#8220;distort&#8221; and &#8220;fabricate&#8221; White male on Black female rape. Quite frankly, I doubt if they would have exaggerated Black male/White female rapes. These rapes did occur. I would rather say they did not, but I would be living in denial and engaging in falsehoods. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, a number of our Amreners who claim to be race realists fail or refuse to acknowledge certain realities. It does us no good to pretend or attempt to dismiss hard truthful evidence. </p>
<p>We have to realize that there are some things that some Whites (mostly men)in past history have engaged in that are less than noble.  <br>

<p>Well, I have a very hard time believing it!  It just goes contrary to logic. Why would upper income white men have to go and rape someone?  That would more likely happen among the lower classes,  if anyone at all. </p>
<p>No. Fastidious upper class men do not go around raping black slum women who are likely to be dirty, as well as parasite and disease-ridden.  Nor would such women suit their taste.  It stretches the imagination!  It&rsquo;s the stuff of lurid novels and Hollywood movies.  The black public may love it, but I&rsquo;m not buying it.</p>

		<p>While this is indeed a troubling situation, the fact is that Texas has had a long history of engaging in trumped up charges against Blacks. I remember the Tulia, Texas scandal in the early 1990s </p>
<p>Just an early example of liberals tossing out convictions WITH NO GOOD REASON TO DO SO.  An uncover officer ran a sting on these people.  Then later arrested them and testified against them in court.  The courts rightly put these people in prison.  A communist plant tossed these convictions out on appeal on NOTHING more than an accusation that the officer lied.  MANY of those people who got off, would later be arrested again as they got caught in the act with drugs again.</p>
<p>There has not been a credible example of &#8220;racist police&#8221; in the memory of anyone living today.  It&rsquo;s all lies.</p>

<p>You are correct. My grandfather who was a product of the pre-1950s integration America grew up in Georgia. He told me that it was not uncommon for White men to engage in sexual liasons with Black women especially White professional men. </p>
<p>In fact, it was often commonplace among the upper southern classes for a number of fathers in the south to take his son to a Black prostitute when he turned 17 or 18. One of my colleagues, now retired, told that his father took both he and his older brothers to Black prostitutes for their initial sexual experiences.</p>

		<p>Somehow, the discussion of this article, about what happened to a white cheerleader at the hands of 4 black males&hellip;. turned into a discussion of whether there was a lot of white-on-black rape, before the Civil Rights era.</p>
<p>Now, the discussion seems to have taken a worse turn, equating rape of black women with &#8216;merely&rsquo; sleeping with them. Worse, it has been asserted that this behavior was, at the time, considered &#8216;normal&rsquo;.  So, as a Mississippian, I feel I should counter the assertions that it was standard practice for middle-class white men to sleep with black women&hellip;even black prostitutes.</p>
<p>It was rare, and it happened among men of the WRONG sort: people who went to the wrong churches, and who had made their money dishonestly (Bootleggers, shyster Lawyers, Holy Roller Preachers&hellip;) </p>
<p>All my life, I&rsquo;ve known a couple, of my Parents&rsquo; generation,  whose wealthy friends tended to be louche and off-color&hellip;as if the couple had been shunned by &#8216;Best Society&rsquo;.  The husband&rsquo;s name was spoken by the men around me as some sort of sorry joke&hellip;rife with contempt.  The women who knew the couple spat out the husband&rsquo;s name in tones usually reserved for Hitler, Pol Pot, and bodily waste.  Finally, once I was past 30, I discovered why that was.</p>
<p>The husband had been caught with one of the black maids, back around 1950. I&rsquo;m sure they were both young and gorgeous.  And it was merely a matter of fun in the barn&hellip;quite literally, a &#8216;roll in the hay&rsquo;: hardly Rape.  But that was enough to forever brand the husband as a loser and a villain (despite his polish and charm, and his wife&rsquo;s beauty, grace and high birth).  It was simply NOT DONE.  Sleeping with blacks was something beyond consideration or comprehension.  Maybe in Louisiana it was OK: but in the Celtic South&hellip;.NO.</p>
<p>The only other example I can think of, of that sort of thing is a family in a town near here.  &#8216;White Trash on the Make&rsquo; would describe them.  Bad surname&hellip;wrong church&hellip;shady origins for their wealth.  In the &#8216;holler&rsquo; near their mansions are a cluster of houses inhabited by &#8220;The Slimeleys that are (that word)ers&#8221;. &#8216;Slimeley&rsquo; is a made-up name. Small town gossip maintains there is a striking resemblance between &#8216;the white side of the family&rsquo; and &#8216;the black side of the family&rsquo;. Apparently, the men of the family carried on with black women, in an intergenerational fashion.  Ironically, one of the female descendants of the white side of the family is now the mistress of an extremely wealthy black man.  But again, these people are, and have always been, social untouchables.  They are nasty in so many ways besides their miscegenation.  The fact that the situation is considered newsworthy enough to be the biggest skeleton in a town whose closets are packed-to-the-ceilings with skeletons&hellip;should show how rare and verboten race-mixing has been considered.</p>
<p>The class of white men who would have taken their sons to black prostitutes as a rite of passage, if indeed this is not someone&rsquo;s fantasy, were people who would have been outside the circles of decent society for many reasons: their names would have been spoken in ways that would have indicated that they were undesirables to be avoided.</p>
<p>Generally, middle-class white males were instructed to sow their Wild Oats among &#8216;Little White Trash Holy Roller Gals&rsquo;.  There was no shortage of these, and they were apparently quite easy to get: particularly after religious experiences had gotten them worked-up&hellip;.a convenient and safe Sunday afternoon diversion for the young men of the country.  As in England and Germany, lower-class whites were regarded, tacitly, as a separate race, and were thus &#8216;exotic&rsquo; enough to satisfy any yen for &#8216;otherness&rsquo;.  And I&rsquo;m sure the inevitable infusion of better genetics that came with these dalliances&hellip;had an improving effect on the WT.  Maybe that&rsquo;s why they now run the South.</p>

<p>Sad to say, but I suspect that that level of feeling and the actions it produced was exactly what it took to maintain a system that worked. </p>
<p>Each generation in the post-bellum South was a bit weaker in innate racial feeling than the former. I saw it in the marked difference in my grandparents born in the late 1800s and my parents born in the early 1900s. And in myself&hellip;well, need I say more than what I&rsquo;ve already displayed on this thread :)</p>

		<p>Part of what makes this so depressing is that we have no outlets to talk about this. There are no pro-white advocacy groups or media outlets. No academic is going to write a book on what can only be called a racial war of blacks against whites. To the extent interracial rape can be talked about it can only involve white men raping black women (even though this never occurs).</p>
<p>The sad truth is that blacks can and do rape white women on a daily basis and often get away with it. Yet we are the racists and they are the victims.</p>

<p>The fact is that upper income men have had a long history of cavorting with Black women, especialy call girls. They were very discreet about it and for the most part, would not do so publically, but they certainly did not hesitate to engge in such behavior behind closed doors.<br>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s the difference folks:</p>
<p>The black boy broke a window to get out of a room when the thuds on the door sounded.  _No white boy in his right mind_ (sauced up on 3.2 or not) would be caught dead in a situation where RAPE happens in public with partygoers 10ft outside the door.</p>
<p>The assumption that &#8216;he thought she meant&rsquo; aside, I do not see a white kid leaving behind his underwear with the half stripped girl crying in a huddle underneath the pool table and his three designated witness/helpers standing there.</p>
<p>Gangrape is a black thing.  Statistics prove it.</p>
<p>A rape kit can come back inconclusive (no hair, no seminal fluid, no follicular cells) but the conditions of the crime should be pretty damn obvious.  And that is why the kit took a year to process.  Because the kit -and- the circumstances would have sent junior to juvie hall and then to adult jail.  </p>
<p>Something which should have been a _given_ because failure to wait for the return of the kit before indictment or ajudication of the CRIME is a failure to investigate said CRIME, thoroughly.</p>
<p>What gets me is the notion that the girls, &#8216;as cheerleaders&rsquo;, may have been there because they were -expected- to serve as &#8216;escorts&rsquo; for the players.  Whether that means arm hanger or more doesn&rsquo;t matter if they are underage.  These are not professional women executing a career for the Cowboys and so they should not be -allowed- to put themselves in that situation.</p>
<p>Only with a presumption of permissiveness as a given can I see the following: </p>
<p>1.  Insufficient chaperones.<br>
2.  No offlimits or no-closed-door requirements for mixed <br>
    genders.<br>
2.  Alcohol to underage minors.</p>
<p>Ending up a -surprise- in terms of the outcomes.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a failure of blacks to be black.  It&rsquo;s a failure of whites to be organized and prepared in their protection.</p>
<p>_Period_.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t expect feminists to stand up for anything.  They get derailed as soon as the concept of victim psychology applies to their attacker too.  Having had so much fun disenfranchising white males, they now have no focus beyond hate at all.</p>
<p>Finally, with regard to the book claims, what caused black on white rape statistics to flipflop like this?  Is black empowerment unattractive?  Or just the black phenotype?  I see a cliff drop in the trend skews which must have a regional or &#8216;other than date&rsquo; based justification.  If the figures aren&rsquo;t lies.</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;Yes dear hearts, you government hates you (whites), and will never do anything to bolster your race. How is it that &ldquo;equality means the death of the white race?&rdquo;</i></p>
<p></p>
<p>You&rsquo;re asking?  You want my answer?  <br>
Because &#8220;your&#8221; government is no longer yours, that&rsquo;s why,  although you are encouraged to think so, via voting and other deceptions that let you think you are still in control.  &#8220;Your&#8221; government has been captured (and was long ago)  &mdash;   along with all your major institutions, one after another    &mdash;    by alien elements and ideologies who hate you, and who are determined to have you replaced with a more easily-led, gullible breed. This has been a l-o-n-g process, taking decades. It took place right beneath our noses. </p>
<p>Whites have shown, historically, that they can get out of control now and then, that they ask inconvenient questions and like to think for themselves   &mdash;   (as we on  Amren are proving right now with this discussion).  Whites also have a distaste for dictatorship and  a passion for self-rule. In the centrally controlled One World of the future, this independent, questioning attitude cannot be allowed! But some races do not like to think for themselves (nor can they do it very well) and are happy to let others do all their thinking for them. Thinking is work, it gets them confused.  By nature they gravitate to dictatorship and comprehend nothing else. These are the ideal zombie proletariat who have been scheduled to replace you. People who put their faith in juju and witch doctors make the  ideal proletariat. They believe everything they see and hear. Movies and television will sway them any way their masters want them  to go. How perfect!  </p>
<p>There is a new model on hand, white man! You are outdated.  The race-replacement  process is well under way. And that applies everywhere   &mdash;   there is no escape.</p>
<p>We  can see that replacement going on all around us IN ALL WHITE COUNTRIES at this very moment.   Let the doubters scoff all they want, but this is an undeniable fact that is self-evident before our very eyes. Should we believe our own eyes or their propaganda? </p>
<p>&#8220;Equality&#8221;,  &#8220;social justice&#8221;, &#8220;human rights&#8221;,  &#8220;change&#8221;, and other such lofty-sounding words are clever propaganda terms used  to <b>disarm you and leave you defenseless in the face of your displacement. </b>In the end, it comes down to  everyone else having justice, rights, and equality   &mdash;   but YOU.  While others have endless &#8220;rights&#8221;, you and your children will only have white guilt and white obligations to pay.</p>
<p>As the Marxist dictum goes: &#8220;From those who have, to those who have not. From those who can, to those who can&rsquo;t.&#8221;  And that will be your future   &mdash;   endless debt.</p>

&#8220;In fact, it was often commonplace among the upper southern classes for a number of fathers in the south to take his son to a Black prostitute when he turned 17 or 18. One of my colleagues, now retired, told that his father took both he and his older brothers to Black prostitutes for their initial sexual experiences.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even if true (and I have my doubts), that is far different from the mass rapes and gang rapes of white women by black men occurring today.<br>

<p>&#8220;There is no legitimate reason to dispute the woman&rsquo;s book. I have not read it and in all probability, will not. However, given the fact that she has been on C-Span, PBS, written op-eds for the Wall Street Journal and several other reputable publications, it is highly likely that her book is a valid account of a sordid chapter in our nation&rsquo;s history.&#8221;</p>
<p>I listed several legitimate reasons why I wouldn&rsquo;t believe anything these crybaby blacks wrote.  Unlike you and other do-gooders, I fall on the side of doubt when it comes to criticizing whites.</p>
<p>And so far as giving critics perverse ammunition, are you so gullible and naive you believe these same critics need any ammunition at all to criticize this forum?  Undeceive yourself.  Their opinions are preset and have been molded for years and years with propaganda and repetitive conditioning.  It&rsquo;s truly laughable to expect being nice and agree to something you haven&rsquo;t even read that is critical of whites will win over acceptance.</p>
<p>Why do you feel you need acceptance from people who hate you?  </p>
<p>Better grow up and understand the real world instead of making a knee jerk reaction to thinking you can persuade anybody toward your way of thinking by being nice.</p>
<p>White nationalism WILL NOT gain any new adherents by only making nice comments, nor will it wow anyone with what some misguided  people believe is intellectualism.  </p>
<p>The prevailing mood is not set by white nationalists, my friend.  It is set by these same critics you want to impress with what you erroneously perceive to be reason and logic, but is only do-gooderism in a kind of immature wrapping.  It hasn&rsquo;t worked one bit in years and it won&rsquo;t work now.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, I&rsquo;m sick to death of standing back and watching do-gooderism cause us even more defeats as it so copiously has everytime it has been advocated in the past.  We need far fewer people like you.</p>

<p>Why bring up the book at all?  I don&rsquo;t believe much of it, but even if I did what has that to do with the state of affairs today?  Trying to justify today&rsquo;s black on white rapes?  Or just trying to appear morally superior and thinking they&rsquo;re intelligent for doing so?  Strange.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Hillaire went to a party at the home of Silsbee High student Brian Riley in September 2008. She got drunk and started flirting. She went into a game room with four boys, including Bolton and another football player, Christian Rountree.&#8221;</p>
<p>Part of me thinks he should be drawn and quartered &hellip; but part of me thinks &hellip; you know &hellip; if a white girl gets drunk and goes into a room with blacks &hellip; </p>
<p>Sad for it to happen this way but I suspect we just recruited a few more white nationalists.  The fact that this is even being reported is a sign that things are changing and blacks are being seen for what they truly are.</p>

		<p>The row we&rsquo;re having on this thread began with my mention in post 24 (the main point of which was present-day statistics for sexual crimes) that the book mentioned by 5-Anonymous was &#8220;APPARENTLY well researched and sourced,&#8221; and that because of my views of how human nature operates when humans have power, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t have any trouble believing that it&rsquo;s PROBABLY pretty much an accurate account.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t come to definite conclusions about ANYthing until I&rsquo;ve done an awful lot of research, and in my perfect world everyone else would do the same. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very aware of the general skepticism anyone should have about anything coming out of a black studies dept.,  and I cautioned another poster about that. My post 37 should help correct some misinterpretations of my initial post 24.</p>
<p>I do find what I believe to be fairly frequent examples of &#8220;distortion and dishonesty&#8221; (which, with possibly one notable exception, IMO are more often the result of careless disregard or of misunderstanding than of intent) in articles, interviews, comments etc. on many white nationalist websites (including this one), and I&rsquo;ve done the research to correct the few I&rsquo;ve had time for. </p>
<p>ice, certainly you&rsquo;re astute enough to realize why my response on that point is limited.</p>
<p>EXTREMELY interesting posts by 57 &mdash; Lauren and by 26  &mdash;  browser&hellip;thanks! </p>
<p>(And I&rsquo;m still hoping for some help as I asked for in post 25)</p>

		<p>Re the &#8220;distortion and dishonesty&#8221; portion of the comment I just submitted, I probably need to repeat what I said when I first posted that, that I find that to be true of ALL movements (and of all websites on ANY heated topic). I&rsquo;m not singling out our movement as exhibiting that human trait in some special way, and in fact I consider our movement to be fundamentally more honest and accurate than the mainstream media and others who oppose us. </p>

<p>Actually there is a very thin line between men cavorting with call girls and women being raped. Frequently, many prostitutes end up being raped by their customers. The type of man who visits call girls is more than often one who is prone to violence and other imposing acts, including forcible rape.</p>

Somehow, the discussion of this article, about what happened to a white cheerleader at the hands of 4 black males&hellip;. turned into a discussion of whether there was a lot of white-on-black rape, before the Civil Rights era.</p>
<p>Now, the discussion seems to have taken a worse turn, equating rape of black women with &lsquo;merely&rsquo; sleeping with them. Worse, it has been asserted that this behavior was, at the time, considered &lsquo;normal&rsquo;. So, as a Mississippian, I feel I should counter the assertions that it was standard practice for middle-class white men to sleep with black women&hellip;even black prostitutes.</p>
<p>It was rare, and it happened among men of the WRONG sort: people who went to the wrong churches, and who had made their money dishonestly (Bootleggers, shyster Lawyers, Holy Roller Preachers&hellip;) </p>
<p>All my life, I&rsquo;ve known a couple, of my Parents&rsquo; generation, whose wealthy friends tended to be louche and off-color&hellip;as if the couple had been shunned by &lsquo;Best Society&rsquo;. The husband&rsquo;s name was spoken by the men around me as some sort of sorry joke&hellip;rife with contempt. The women who knew the couple spat out the husband&rsquo;s name in tones usually reserved for Hitler, Pol Pot, and bodily waste. Finally, once I was past 30, I discovered why that was.</p>
<p>The husband had been caught with one of the black maids, back around 1950. I&rsquo;m sure they were both young and gorgeous. And it was merely a matter of fun in the barn&hellip;quite literally, a &lsquo;roll in the hay&rsquo;: hardly Rape. But that was enough to forever brand the husband as a loser and a villain (despite his polish and charm, and his wife&rsquo;s beauty, grace and high birth). It was simply NOT DONE. Sleeping with blacks was something beyond consideration or comprehension. Maybe in Louisiana it was OK: but in the Celtic South&hellip;.NO.</p>
<p>The only other example I can think of, of that sort of thing is a family in a town near here. &lsquo;White Trash on the Make&rsquo; would describe them. Bad surname&hellip;wrong church&hellip;shady origins for their wealth. In the &lsquo;holler&rsquo; near their mansions are a cluster of houses inhabited by &ldquo;The Slimeleys that are (that word)ers&rdquo;. &lsquo;Slimeley&rsquo; is a made-up name. Small town gossip maintains there is a striking resemblance between &lsquo;the white side of the family&rsquo; and &lsquo;the black side of the family&rsquo;. Apparently, the men of the family carried on with black women, in an intergenerational fashion. Ironically, one of the female descendants of the white side of the family is now the mistress of an extremely wealthy black man. But again, these people are, and have always been, social untouchables. They are nasty in so many ways besides their miscegenation. The fact that the situation is considered newsworthy enough to be the biggest skeleton in a town whose closets are packed-to-the-ceilings with skeletons&hellip;should show how rare and verboten race-mixing has been considered.</p>
<p>The class of white men who would have taken their sons to black prostitutes as a rite of passage, if indeed this is not someone&rsquo;s fantasy, were people who would have been outside the circles of decent society for many reasons: their names would have been spoken in ways that would have indicated that they were undesirables to be avoided.</p>
<p>Generally, middle-class white males were instructed to sow their Wild Oats among &lsquo;Little White Trash Holy Roller Gals&rsquo;. There was no shortage of these, and they were apparently quite easy to get: particularly after religious experiences had gotten them worked-up&hellip;.a convenient and safe Sunday afternoon diversion for the young men of the country. As in England and Germany, lower-class whites were regarded, tacitly, as a separate race, and were thus &lsquo;exotic&rsquo; enough to satisfy any yen for &lsquo;otherness&rsquo;. And I&rsquo;m sure the inevitable infusion of better genetics that came with these dalliances&hellip;had an improving effect on the WT. Maybe that&rsquo;s why they now run the South</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;Ironically, one of the female descendants of the white side of the family is now the mistress of an extremely wealthy black man.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Really? Nice fiction, like you entire post. The fact is you need to read some history books written by scholars who span the political spectrum. The vast majority of them will tell you that were a number of White men who engaged in sex and frequently raped with Black women. These are well regarded historians. They were not trying to engage in some perverse fantasy of interracial rape. The truth is what it is. </p>
<p>Some of you do yourselves a disservice by writing such dismissive drivel.</p>

<p>At the MSM site I post at, knoxnews.com, at least the insults usually have some humor in them.

<p>ice: What&rsquo;s that again? You say:  &#8220;The vast majority of them will tell you that (sic) were a number of White men who engaged in sex and frequently raped with (sic) Black women.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re claiming that a &#8220;number&#8221; of white men engaged in sex with black women, when the book you did not read wants us to believe it was something like a rite of passage and was endemic within the Southern population.</p>
<p>Well, which is it?  Do you want to define what you mean by a &#8220;number&#8221; of white men?  I think a common definition would be that it might be slightly more than a few.</p>
<p>But most of all tell us why you believe this book should have been brought up at all.  Are you trying to say that the above brutal rape by a white girl has parity to alleged black on white rape years ago, that was, in reality, nothing like what you want to believe?  And tell us why you want to believe such negativism about whites.  And don&rsquo;t tell us it&rsquo;s because you believe in the truth, then add that you haven&rsquo;t read the book, because it&rsquo;s too obvious there&rsquo;s some kind of underlying motivation for your anti-white comments.  It&rsquo;s obvious you want to believe in anti-white charges, not the truth.</p>
<p>And let us know why you so fanatically pursue events, by your own admission, that allegedly occurred decades ago.  By that logic, why stop there?  Why not continue on with claims about how the Romans, Egyptians and other Caucasians raped and murdered Nubians.  They did you know?  The Egyptians defeated Nubia in many battles, one of which resulted in their returning home with 70,000 black slaves.</p>
<p>The bottom line to all this nonsense is this:  You think by eagerly agreeing to a book by a self-hating white, you regard yourself as &#8220;broadminded&#8221; or intelligent, when the fact of the matter is that you&rsquo;re too gullible and naive to really understand anything and you&rsquo;re the type who can be hung in the political winds and turned any way a propagandist wants to turn him.</p>
<p>The book you support by a self-hating, anti-white propagandist should never have been mentioned at all, because it has nothing to do with the situation today, even if it were true.  Basically what you&rsquo;re saying is that raping the girl in the above article by a black is o.k., because whites did the same decades ago. </p>
<p>You&rsquo;re disgusting.  Should we also fail to criticize the above black on white crime in order to suit you?</p>

<p>ice:  That you think McGuire&rsquo;s smear campaign is as cut and dried, on the same level, as a simple math problem tells me you can&rsquo;t draw logical parallels to different points of view, and that&rsquo;s part of the reason you are so fanatically obsessed with denigrating whites on incidents that allegedly occurred many, many years ago.  You give parity where parity can&rsquo;t logically be drawn, better known as &#8220;muddled thinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sorry, old boy, you have it wrong. What is sad is your dredging up exaggerated information that is designed to intimidate whites and your motivations are based in some kind of perverted reasoning that has no parallel to the vicious black on what rape described above.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m astute enough to understand that your motivations for bringing up this book are suspect at best and are completely out of line on this particular thread.  </p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re saying, bottom line, is what I mentioned above and that is your purpose in introducing this book by the black studies, self-hating white was in response to an incident that occurred fairly recently and it has no correlation whatsoever to alleged incidents of the past.  </p>
<p>When somebody gets to the point of anti-white negativism in response to black on white crime, it&rsquo;s plain to thinking individuals there are underlying motives involved, whether they&rsquo;re based in unsound logic or more sinister purposes.  </p>
<p>Your desire to show that whites are &#8220;bad&#8221; too proves just exactly what?  That this rape was justified, because you dredged up some kind of extremist propaganda from the distant past?  And as the Southerner above states:  </p>
<p>&ldquo;Somehow, the discussion of this article, about what happened to a white cheerleader at the hands of 4 black males&hellip;. turned into a discussion of whether there was a lot of white-on-black rape, before the Civil Rights era.</p>

So, as a Mississippian, I feel I should counter the assertions that it was standard practice for middle-class white men to sleep with black women&hellip;even black prostitutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Saying above in another post that your interests do not lean toward &#8220;the rigors of advocacy&#8221; after introducing a link to a book which required advocacy to do so is disengenuous at best, but worse your parallels are skewed and contradictory.</p>
<p>You have some idea you need to be on a mission to tone down white claims of being better than blacks in behavior and morals and that in doing so you will make this movement more acceptable to what you naively believe will draw more members, not understanding that volumes of statistics are available, in addition to true life experiences, that show that blacks truly are at the bottom of the racial totem pole, compared with everybody not just whites.</p>
<p>If you feel uncomfortable with whites pointing this out, why not go someplace else where you don&rsquo;t have to read it, because it will continue on here as long as this site is in existence and there&rsquo;s nothing you can do about it. Certainly drawing nonsensical, illogical parallels, based in another time period will have no effect.  </p>

<p>If you want to direct people to this site who are like you, don&rsquo;t bother.  We don&rsquo;t need anyone else here who thinks they&rsquo;re revealing the truth by presenting evidence that isn&rsquo;t germaine to the topic at hand, thinking that by denigrating whites they&rsquo;re being broadminded and/or fair, as you did by bringing up that disgusting book by the self-hating, white author.</p>
<p>Can you explain what the book you provided links for has to do with the attack described in the above story?  You&rsquo;ve been asked to do that repeatedly, but so far you&rsquo;ve done no more than dance around the subject.  Do you want us to regard the outlandish incidents it depicts as being on a par with today&rsquo;s black on white assaults and mob attacks, so therefore we have no right to complain?  Or dismiss the above black on white atrocity as something that occurred the other way around in the distant past, even though it was a rare occurrence?  </p>
<p>The last I looked on the Dept of Justice&rsquo;s web site I noted that about 37,500 white women were raped by blacks on average per year, with almost zero the other way around.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve directed numerous tea party advocates here, so whatever might be lost from your end will more than compensated.</p>
<p>HD: &#8220;You know what kind of people I&rsquo;d like to be involved in a movement with?

<p>ice:  Apologize for what?  For telling the truth, or do you feel as if you&rsquo;re above criticism and become enraged yourself when you get involed with virgorous debate and must be treated as someone privileged?  In case you haven&rsquo;t noticed I&rsquo;ve been slammed many times and have responded appropriately, without requiring an apology.  In fact I don&rsquo;t want one&hellip;.ever.  Just a fair chance to respond is all I desire.</p>
<p>And I get &#8220;carried away&#8221; you say?  I see no comments I&rsquo;ve made that would indicate I was in a rage or &#8220;carried away.&#8221;  But I&rsquo;ve seen a lot directed at me and other posters who offered legitimate questions as to why we must accept the premise that whites in our distant past committed a rape here and there and who sometimes cavorted with black women. Implying that the above black on white rape was a tit for tat situation, when it most certainly wasn&rsquo;t anything of the kind, just adds insult to injury. If there is an apology to be given it should be by you to every bona fide member of this board who supports white causes and is working to safeguard whites against numerous black on white attacks that occur in the hundreds in this country every day.  Don&rsquo;t you understand your wishi-washiness encourages black on white crime, in addition to being invalid?</p>
<p>What you have to understand and can&rsquo;t seem to get there is that you purposely diverted the black on rape incident of this thread by introducing a book by a hateful anti-white, pro-black hater who is in the same class as Susan Sarandan and Jean Garafalo.</p>
<p>And it was wrong of you to do so, whatever your reasons were.</p>

&ldquo;The fact is you need to read some history books written by scholars &hellip;. The vast majority of them will tell you that were a number of White men who engaged in sex and frequently raped with Black women. These are well regarded historians.&rdquo; </p>
<p>_____________________________</p>
<p><b>&#8220;Who frequently raped with Black women&#8221;?   </b> Huh???</p>
<p>Well, well. I think I recognize one of our friendly trolls  from past encounters. His  foot-in-mnouth writing style is inimitable.</p>
<p>As for the &#8220;vast majority&#8221; of those, uh, &#8221;historians&#8221; and &#8220;scholars&#8221; &hellip; if there are such a &#8220;vast&#8221; number of them,  the only one I&rsquo;ve ever encountered was Kyle Onstatt, the lurid novelist  of &#8220;Mandingo&#8221; notoriety.  Well, maybe also Alex Haley, the plagiarist.<br>
 <br>
Or perhaps he meant to say Hollywood &#8220;screenwriters&#8221;, instead of &#8220;scholars&#8221;?  Probably.  LOL</p>

I think someone here is going too hard on Mr. Dumpty. </p>
<p>I  was among those who felt that it would be better if he  left out that  unnecessary reference to the white feminist sociologist and her book (which he admited he hasn&rsquo;t read). He wasn&rsquo;t the one who brought up up the book. </p>
<p>Actually, he only mentioned it in passing, didn&rsquo;t endorse it, and went on to criticize (in considerable statistical detail) the Dept. of Justice rape figures.</p>
<p>&hellip;ice: <i> &#8220;I&rsquo;m astute enough to understand that your motivations for bringing up this book are suspect at best and are completely out of line on this particular thread.&#8221; </i></p>
<p>&hellip;ice:  <i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame you have to take the side of black on white rapists, revealing your support of one of the most vicious atrocities committed against whites in this country today.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>That is most unfair, and a gross exaggeration! He did not take the rapists&rsquo; side or support anti-white atrocities!  He did, however, try to be calm and objective, rather than choleric. He has already regretted his attempt to be overly fair.  </p>
<p>It happens that there are some people who are just naturally inclined, out of a sense of decency and fair play,  to give the other side the utmost benefit of the doubt, even when it&rsquo;s harmful to themselves.  You could call it the White Disease!   Historically, it&rsquo;s called chivalry. It&rsquo;s characteristic of the best of our culture.  This sense of fair play and excessive generosity is  not uncommon among us.  It doesn&rsquo;t imply any suspect sinister motives, or moral defects.</p>
<p>Dumpty has already said  that he  <i>&#8220;tends to agree pretty much with those who are criticizing my remarks here&#8221;.  </i>  So what more do youwant?   And he has expressed regret  that he seems to have stirred up a fuss.  But he is also, understandably,  distressed with the angry, hostile tone  that he finds on many sites such as this (including, he says,  &#8220;those who oppose us&#8221;).</p>
<p>So  take it easy!  Lay off him already!  What do you want from him   &mdash;  - blood?</p>

		<p>I referenced that book that another poster had mentioned because it treated a topic I haven&rsquo;t thought much about, and I thought the little bit of material I found online about the book and its author was interesting.</p>
<p>This thread has made me think more about my first hunch that the book is probably pretty accurate.</p>
<p>First of all, there&rsquo;s no doubt that some fair number of white men have found black women attractive enough to have sex with, or else we wouldn&rsquo;t have all these mulattoes in the country. </p>
<p>Also, I assume that there were in past days some portion of white men who were willing to commit rape&hellip;the present rate at which white men rape white women, while several times lower than the rate at which black men rape white women (see stats and link in my post 24) is nothing to brag about.</p>
<p>I see no reason to think that these two groups would not include some common members, and that in days when power arrangements were such that those men could get away with it, that some number of them would not have raped black women, and that those women often would have not been able to get redress.</p>
<p>And while I&rsquo;m very cautious about anything that comes out of black studies, women&rsquo;s studies, all those kind of departments, I see no reason for concluding a priori that nothing that issues from them can ever be worthwhile. From what I saw online I got the impression that this work might well be accurate. It was just an impression.</p>
<p>After thinking about it quite a bit, I conclude that there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with discussing this side topic on this thread. Those of you who think doing so in some way diminishes the main topic&hellip;well, I&rsquo;m sorry that you live in such a close embrace with the current Zeitgeist.</p>
<p>And if you think that anything I&rsquo;ve written here implies that I believe the mulattoes in our society were produced by rape rather than overwhelmingly by consensual sex&hellip;well, please spare me all the tedious clichés involved in that assumption.</p>
<p>And did anyone bother to read the main point of my post 24 that ignited all this, about the crime stats?</p>

<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>Here is a good example of material from those &#8220;well regarded scholars and historians&#8221;. It seems that some of our posters have been reading too much that lurid soft-porn that once passed for historical commentary and documentation of inter-racial relations. Maybe in some circles it still does.</p>

<p>&#8220;I consider Lauren to be one of the most articulate and perceptive posters here. She is a sharp observer, and few details miss her quick intelligence. I respect her opinion.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really great to read where someone is standing up for our women, GHW, And every point you made was excellent.  And the lady herself had excellent points also, just as the few on here who contribute, and she guided us back to the topic, which is really what this thread should have been all about.  </p>

You could call it the White Disease! Historically, it&rsquo;s called chivalry.&#8221;</p>
<p>ice: Not true, old boy.  It&rsquo;s called gullibility and naivete and it&rsquo;s what has been the bane of the white race for centuries. I&rsquo;m sick to death of the wimps who are always ready to placate the other side in order to feel morally superior, especially if it leads to more denigration of whites. But I&rsquo;m especially sick to death of people like you who blindly support such adverse nonsense.</p>
<p>And what is so disgusting about this matter is that the book in question had nothing to do with the current black on white rape involved in the above story, and it was obvious to most that the result in bringing it up served only to denigrate whites. </p>
<p>And whether this Dumpty orginally brought it up or not is immaterial, because he most certainly belabored the point, and his foolish support of it caused the subject to divert from what this story line is all about, enabling the PC instigator who originally named the book to have an entire forum on it, causing the implication by association that this rape was similar to what occurred by whites years ago.  These scammers who comne on here fool only the most gullible.  You should be ashamed instead of feeling morally superior.</p>
<p>This is exactly the same thing that occurred quite a while ago when a convicted black sex offender pretended he was a PHD academic and spun some obviously untrue story about false black accomplishment and this Humpty and you rose to his defense slamming me as if I had done something wrong by pointing out his attempts at deception.</p>
<p>HD eventually realized his error and said so, leaving you out hanging after you foolishly took the side of the black.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s characteristic of the best of our culture. This sense of fair play and excessive generosity is not uncommon among us. It doesn&rsquo;t imply any suspect sinister motives, or moral defects.&#8221;</p>
<p>How utterly disgusting.   That same attitude got white settlers almost wiped out in early American history by the Indians&hellip;more than once&hellip;. and it had the same result when those among the Boers pressed their leadership to trust the Zulu who in turn sprang their deceitful trap and decimated their ranks in a murderous slaughter. Both stories appeared in Amren newsletters.  But those examples aren&rsquo;t the only ones by far.</p>
<p>How I wish the black population had as many gullibles on their side as we do.  &#8220;White decency?&#8221;  &#8220;Chivalry?&#8221;  Nonsense.  It all is based in an inability to perceive things accurately.</p>
<p>Such attitudes deserve no high sounding titles, when it concerns people who want to see us wiped out.   But they do deserve severe condemnation, which is just exactly what they got.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of the reasons?&#8221;  And what is that reason?  You haven&rsquo;t been given privileged status by someone who forced you into a vigorous debate to explain yourself?  (Which you never, ever did.) </p>
<p>What are the other reasons if this is just &#8220;one of the reasons?&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, is this your way of sending a message to Amren management that the loss of your valuable presence is due to me and they therefore should protect you at all costs in order to persuade you to show up, because the loss is just too great to bear?</p>
<p>First, you threatened not to advise this site to anyone anymore.  Now you&rsquo;re threatening to refuse to go to the convention and you want to make it known I&rsquo;m &#8220;one of the reasons.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is this your idea of arguing points on their merit?  Threatening to take your ball and go home?</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;in days when power arrangements were such that men could get away with it, &hellip;, and those women often would have not been able to get redress.&#8221;</i><br>
   &mdash;   H. Dumpty</p>
<p>This is an undeniable fact of human society   &mdash;   there is such a thing as power relationships.    Power is an intoxicant.  But it is not racial.  It&rsquo;s about economics and class.  People in power take advantage of those who are weak, whoever they are.  Throughout our own European history, the masters took advantage of the serfs.  It was considered their right and  privilege. Ever heard of &#8220;droit du seigneur&#8221;?  But you don&rsquo;t hear endless wailing today about &#8220;rape&#8221; of peasants in the Middle Ages.   In fact, I&rsquo;ve NEVER  encountered any griping about it.   When it happened, it was considered that the upper classes were enriching the common stock.   The commoners were supposed to be flattered and grateful for this attention.  Ah, but that&rsquo;s because different races weren&rsquo;t involved!  Those peasant women were just white. To our modern race-grievance hustlers, they don&rsquo;t count.   </p>
<p>Well, the plantation South was just a transplant of feudal Europe, with the same class attitudes and customs.  Except the peasants weren&rsquo;t white. But if the lord of the manor did any  &#8220;tom catting&#8221; around, he would have kept it quiet. As Lauren pointed out, it just wasn&rsquo;t done!   It was socially unacceptable.  He would have lost face among his peers and his family would have been humiliated. </p>
<p>Even in today&rsquo;s corporate world (the modern equivalent of feudal society),  how many executives look out on a pool of secretaries whom they consider to be virtually their  own private harem?  What typist is in a position to rebuff the interest of the department head?  What maid in the manor house was in a position to rebuff the lord of the manor?   That&rsquo;s power relationships for you!  Who says it&rsquo;s racial?  (Only our race hustlers, who have made it their stock in trade, because they have something to gain.)  I understand that in Islamic countries today, the household servants are considered to be, in every way,  at the disposal of the master. It&rsquo;s  socially and religiously endorsed and accepted.  This is to say that  exploitative power relationships are  universal in human society.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;And if you think that anything I&rsquo;ve written here implies that I believe the mulattoes in [our country]  were produced by rape rather than overwhelmingly by consensual sex&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another excellent point.  In such a transaction, something was to be gained by both parties, and not necessarily equally.   Where it occurred, it only figures that it would rarely have been forcible.  There was no need!  In fact, the black female would have had a great deal more to gain from an intimate  relationship with the master than he could possibly have gained from her.  There were many slaves like her, but only one master like him.  If she resisted, he could have dumped her and taken another.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t require any stretching of the imagination to see that many such females would have connived and  done everything in their power to get into the master&rsquo;s bed.   They would hardly have been resisting. Looking at it logically, it would have been much more a case of them seducing him,  rather than him raping them.   A wealthy plantation owner who was &#8220;inclined&#8221; would have been surrounded by many willing potential bedpartners.  I doubt that he had to expend much effort &#8220;raping&#8221; them.  And that was true in Europe just as much as in Carolina.</p>
<p>You can say, where are my statistics? I can say, I know human nature;  that&rsquo;s my statistic!</p>
<p>It must be added  too, that wealthy slave-owners in a position to take advantage  were just a tiny percentage of the white southern population   &mdash;  -  even those few who were inclined to mixing with the darkies.  Why blame all the rest?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve addressed this blatant  and obvious truism before, but it&rsquo;s not a thing that the racial gripers want to acknowledge.  They want you to think that they were the only ones who were exploited throughout history. Sorry. Not so! History is full of exploitation.</p>
<p>People of a certain mentality absolutely LOVE  Tom Jefferson  &mdash;  Sally Hemmings stories   &mdash;    because such stories support everything they WANT to believe.  It&rsquo;s &#8220;Mandingo&#8221; with real historical names.  But it&rsquo;s usually fiction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying &#8220;never&#8221;.  I said &#8220;usually&#8221;.</p>
<p>Oh, and there is one further thing. Mr. Dumpty mentioned the large number of mulattoes today as evidence of something that went on.  I would reply that once a mulatto was produced, and he was put in charge of the other blacks (say, as butler of the household), then he would have taken it from there and lightened up the rest.  The other blacks would have cottoned up to him, and HE would have taken advantage of HIS OWN power relationship with them.  Thus, I&rsquo;m saying that you didn&rsquo;t need to have many whites engaging  in sexual relationships with blacks.  The few light-skinned &#8220;blacks&#8221; who existed  would have enjoyed a great  advantage and would have been sought by all the others.  Even today that is  still true. </p>

==============</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t. And one incident does not make a trend or a rule.</p>
<p>Furthermore, what did that have to do with R-A-P-E? <br>
The applicable word here is &ldquo;rape&rdquo;! <br>
Do you KNOW it was a case of rape?<br>
Has it been described that way ANYWHERE? Or is that just your assumption?</p>
<p><br>
Actually, according to several accounts that I have read, in 1925 Strom Thurmond fathered a child by who was 16 years old at the time. Her name was Carrie Mae Butler. She died in the 1940s. He was 22 years old.  This qualifies as statuatory rape. And let&rsquo;s say for the sake of argument that he did not rape her? PLEASE! So what?</p>
<p>She was a poor Black teenage girl in 1925 in South Carolina. She probably had no choice but to engage in sexual activity with him otherwise, she would have been raped, possibly lynched (although I doubt that they would have lynched a teenage girl) or faced some other sort of punishment. For all we know he may have had several sexual encounters with this young lady or several other Black women at the time.</p>
<p>The situation was hardly one of free will or equality.</p>

<p>Who said it was, &#8220;Sarah?&#8221;  It was just one incident&hellip;.if it happened at all&hellip;. and that&rsquo;s doubtful, because you&rsquo;ve already revealed that you certainly don&rsquo;t let the truth stand in your way to push your childish propaganda, and your hatred of white conservative Christians.  Also, it had nothing to do with the kind of black on white rape that is rampant today.  Did Strom Thurmond jump out of the bushes or did he attack the woman at a party, then jump out the window, leaving her crying because of the brutal attack, with her screaming for him to stop?</p>
<p>But, more importantly, what has that to do with the present state of affairs this article addresses?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ve easily duped two gullible Amrenners, don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ve fooled the rest of us.  The two you fooled have a track record of gullibility and naivete.</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t accomplished one single thing worthwhile.</p>
<p>Do you have another book to reccommend that also has no parity to black on white rape in recent times, even if you have to go back more than a hundred years in order to denigrate whites?</p>

<p>Well ice, it&rsquo;s hard to resist your charm, but I&rsquo;m going to try, although I am mildly interested in the information. But since you&rsquo;ve worked a lot harder than I have to turn this thread away from the topic, you wouldn&rsquo;t do much additional harm to just post that info.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m already reading two wonderful books about race right now, &#8220;Unforgivable Blackness&#8221;, a biography of Jack Johnson, and &#8220;Until Proven Innocent,&#8221; about the Duke Lacrosse team case (and I&rsquo;m so grateful to E. Pluribus Pluribus for turning me and I hope others on to that second book).</p>
<p>If there are newcomers reading this, and you want the best possible picture of the racial change that has happened in this country in the last 100 years, I recommend reading those two books together.</p>
<p>ice, the biggest difference between you and me is that you are much more passionately involved in this movement than I am right now. I knew that the poster who mentioned the book we&rsquo;ve been &#8220;discussing&#8221; was probably trying to cause a mess, but I couldn&rsquo;t resist mentioning the book anyway because when I googled it I found stuff that interested me. And I was resentful beforehand (being in a foul mood these days) that I can&rsquo;t mention on this site, any more than I can on my MSM site, something related that interests me if it&rsquo;s not PC, without some people going nuts (PC being easily as strong on this site as it is on MSM; it&rsquo;s just different PC),  Something compulsive in me said, Harumphty, test it one more time, maybe this time you&rsquo;ll be allowed to simply mention something you find interesting without a tropical storm forming.</p>
<p>But no, Harumphty, the world has not changed during your absence.</p>
<p>btw I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m motivated by &#8220;a sense of fair play&#8221; (I guess I could be wrong about that, but look how I&rsquo;m treating you), but just by the kind of interest a historian would have in anything interesting that comes up. I liked your comment about whites&rsquo; sense of fair play,</p>
<p>&#8220;That same attitude got white settlers almost wiped out in early American history by the Indians&hellip;more than once&hellip;. and it had the same result when those among the Boers pressed their leadership to trust the Zulu who in turn sprang their deceitful trap and decimated their ranks in a murderous slaughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>But I disagree with you that a sense of fair play (for those who have it) is &#8220;utterly disgusting&#8221;. Ha! Don&rsquo;t you think that goes a bit far?! Lol! You&rsquo;re obviously a smart guy and an able poster, and when you&rsquo;re older maybe you will have learned that just about every human trait, good and bad, brings its possessor both good and bad in his life. (That is just as true of steely cold-heartedness as it is of &#8220;a sense of fair play.&#8221; Look at the dismal end of a certain experiment in self-government that was tried in Europe a little over a half century ago).</p>
<p>No charge for that, and you&rsquo;re welcome.</p>

<p>In 1925 South Carloina that probably was not categorized as &#8220;statutory rape&#8221;.</p>
<p>And btw, I do not approve of his behaviour. I am not in any way  defending it. I deplore it.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;She probably had no choice but to engage in sexual activity with him otherwise, she would have been raped, possibly lynched &hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Probably?  It&rsquo;s equally probable (or more so)  that  it was consensual and she was flattered at the attention. You are making assumptions here about what we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;For all we know he may have had several sexual encounters with this young lady or several other Black women at the time.&#8221;</i><br>
It could have been a long-term relationship to the benefit of both parties. So what? </p>
<p>But you say &#8220;for all we know&#8221;. Which means we don&rsquo;t know.  In other words, you&rsquo;re indulging in speculating again!</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The situation was hardly one of free will or equality.&#8221;</i><br>
No argument about that. But  even if all that was true, the same thing happened to white servants too!  Do you think it was only blacks?  Those in power always have the advantage;  sometimes they abuse it.  It was a matter of class and money, not race or color. </p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t the wealthy lawyer, Johnnie Cochran, have a white mistress whom he abused and  treated wretchedly?</p>
<p>The problem  in America is that self-pitying blacks tend to see race, race, race in everything.  Whites generally do not.</p>

		<p>More on mainstream PC and Amren PC:</p>
<p>In a second-hand bookstore a few years ago, I came across a book about the anti-smoking campaign undertaken in Germany in the 1930s by the Nazi government, which had recognized the connection between smoking and lung cancer (as well as other illnesses) even at that early time.</p>
<p>But what should have been an interesting book was unreadable, because every other sentence was a disclaimer, with an apology by the author for saying anything positive about the Nazis. He begged the reader to understand that he had come across the anti-smoking campaign only while investigating Nazi atrocities, and he stressed that he in no way thought that the anti-smoking campaign meant that there was anything good about Nazism in any way. He apologized to anyone who might be offended by his writing a book about&hellip;..etc. etc. etc., ad nauseum.</p>
<p>And of course it was necessary for him to do that. Otherwise the mainstream official and free-lance thought police would have had his head (or to not exaggerate, one could say at least that there would have been a pall of suspicion cast upon him forever more, if he&rsquo;d just written his book matter-of-factly)</p>
<p>The self-appointed thought police on this site enforce the Amren version of PC (instituted by posters here, apparently, rather than by the management) just as strongly. How dare I go so far as to mention a book about white on black rape without surrounding that mention with disclaimers! My using that mention to introduce my main point, the racial direction of violent sexual crime today (which certainly IS relevant to the thread&rsquo;s topic), was in no way a sufficient &#8220;disclaimer&#8221; for the thought police on this site! No, no! And my remarks and statistics addressing the topic of the thread were of no interest whatsoever to this site&rsquo;s thought police, who cared only about the hint of ideological impurity that wafted up from the matter-of-fact manner in which I referred to the book about white on black rape.</p>
<p>I responded to the thought police&rsquo;s response, and the thread became what it became. </p>
<p>Who was most responsible for the diversion of the thread, myself or the thought police, I guess would be a topic for sociologists who study group behavior and the devices that groups use to strengthen their cohesion, including the production of and protection of a tacitly agreed upon PC style of expression.</p>
<p>Since such PC behavior is a universal trait of human nature, it&rsquo;s really as stupid of me to complain about it as it is for people to complain about another human trait, &#8220;racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>So if my matter of factly mentioning the grating title of the bio of Jack Johnson, &#8220;Unforgivable Blackness,&#8221; was offensive, I apologize.</p>

		<p>Who said it was, &ldquo;Sarah?&rdquo; It was just one incident&hellip;.if it happened at all&hellip;. and that&rsquo;s doubtful,</p>
<p>Huh? Are you serious? His daughter came out and admitted that Strom Thurmond was her father and Carrie Mae Butler, the young girl was her mother. Are you not aware of this? The story was covered throughly by the media shortly after his death. </p>
<p>Did Strom Thurmond jump out of the bushes or did he attack the woman at a party, then jump out the window, leaving her crying because of the brutal attack, with her screaming for him to stop?</p>
<p>Equally insane argument!</p>
<p>Ice:</p>
<p>Sarah is correct. </p>
<p>The fact is that the late Strom Thurmond did in fact father a Black child with a teenage girl. While I agree that it has nothing to do with todays White on Black rapes, the fact is that it was disgusting and quite frankly, hypocritical behavior on the part of the late senator who so admirably, passionately and agressively advocated for the rights of Whites and our culture in general, yet seemed to have no problem in fornicating with a Black teenage girl or perhaps other Black or other non-White women for that matter.  </p>

<p><i>Actually, according to several accounts that I have read, in 1925 Strom Thurmond fathered a child by who was 16 years old at the time. Her name was Carrie Mae Butler. She died in the 1940s. He was 22 years old. This qualifies as statuatory rape. And let&rsquo;s say for the sake of argument that he did not rape her? PLEASE! So what?</i></p>
<p>Age of consent varies by state, (currently in South Carolina the age of consent is 16) it is likely that it was lower in 1925:</p>

<p>If you had read the biography of Essie Mae Washington-Williams (Thurmond&rsquo;s biracial daughter) you would have known that her mother had told her she loved Strom Thurmond. So does this mean you think that Ms. Washington-Williams is liar..? Note also that Thurmond paid for daughter&rsquo;s college education and by her reckoning met her on 60 or so occasions. I find that to be rather unusual behavior for a rapist. No doubt, Strom Thurmond was a major hypocrite but that doesn&rsquo;t make him a rapist. Calling him such in light of contradictory evidence dilutes the meaning of the word. </p>

<p>ice: Do you have anything to add, &#8220;white warrior,&#8221; about another isolated, irrelevant bit of news to report that is about a hundred years old?</p>
<p>Incidentally, there&rsquo;s a wealth of proof that your posts are based in a hatred of white Christians.  </p>
<p>Do you really expect to change the thinking on this site, by dredging up decades old isolated incidents that have no bearing on the original topic of this story?   <br>

<p>Thank you, Stillwarm, for an EXCELLENT post. You have  done your research and given  us FACTS instead of hunches, rumors, and vague allegations.      No emotional accusations   &mdash;    just the facts.  Links too! We need more posts like yours.</p>
<p>I will add  that, as I recall reading that story,  Thurmond not only financed his daughter&rsquo;s education, he sent them checks for many years. He COULD NOT be open about this matter,  as a congressman from South Carolina. That would have been political suicide. It would also have meant social disgrace.  And what purpose would have been served? (Miscegenation was not only socially disapproved, it was against the law.) </p>
<p>He may have, when older, regretted the folly of his youth, but it was too late then, so he took responsibility for his behavior and attempted to compensate.  That is most definitely NOT the behavior of a  rapist.  Any attempt to chacterize this youthful indescrition (on both their parts)  as &#8220;rape&#8221;  is  dishonest to say the least. </p>
<p>As a technicality, even if he had wanted to marry her (and she him) that would not have been possible at the time, as miscegenation in So. Carolina was illegal.  So he made amends the best he could. </p>
<p>And once again, I am not defending him. I deplore it, but I&rsquo;m just trying to get the terminology straight.  It was something that should not have happened, but it was not rape.<br>

<p>Nonsense!  The above posts clearly state that you went off topic by elaborating on a matter that was not apropos to the above story, and there&rsquo;s no amount of spin you or anyone else can put on your naive comments that will make them out to be something other than the height of gullibility.</p>
<p>The book in question was submitted by someone with the intent to denigrate whites by introducing an incident that has no bearing on the subject at hand for what is obviously a desire to denigrate the people here and whites in general.  Without your naive willingness to contribute to the matter it would have went nowhere.  As it is, you, the orignal contributor, and one other misguided soul, sent the thread off in a direction that could in no way fit this thread, and you still don&rsquo;t understand that it was strictly for denigration purposes.</p>
<p>And if you think that my comments, designed to stop the denigrating misdirection, amounts to being the &#8220;thought police,&#8221; better examine that again, also, because your thinking is skewed there as well.  </p>
<p>You had every chance to respond, but you offered only outrage that your views were challenged, and demanded an apology, as if you were someone whose remarks are above challenge, instead of responding with substantive rebuttal.  When that didn&rsquo;t work, you said you were going to quit directing people to this site.  After that, you stated you were going to pass on the Amren convention.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re making claims about what your intent was and denying you helped misdirect the site in a direction that resulted in  denigration of the people here.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;reilly calls it &#8220;spin&#8221; and it is the basis of nearly all your rants here.</p>

<p>And since we are already well into this diversion, I&rsquo;m also glad you decided to add to the clarity of the situation.  You&rsquo;re doing a bit better.  I hope you keep it up.</p>

 <br>
As Lauren has already reminded us,  this article was supposed to be about a high school rape that happened recently in Texas.</p>
<p>Instead, we have gotten diverted by several trolls into a wrangling,  nasty  dispute about an unrelated  incident (not even a rape!) that happened in S. Carolina almost a century ago.  And into  acrimonous discussion about some obscure book by an alleged &#8220;authority&#8221; that no one here appears even to have read!   This thread was not supposed to be about  Thurmond or about lurid fantasies of alleged white abuse of blacks once upon a time in the Old South. But it has gotten  completely turned around. </p>
<p>It has been the established practice, on other threads such as this, for our trolls to divert the discussion elsewhere, away from the topic on hand when they find that topic to be embarrassing or indefensible.  When they can&rsquo;t argue a point, they find a red herring to distract us.  That&rsquo;s their usual strategy: Get people arguing about something unrelated.</p>
<p>Shame on me   (along with others)  for biting the bait and having fallen into their trap.  This whole &#8220;discussion&#8221; has become divisive and unproductive,  setting us against each other, and I&rsquo;ll have nothing  more to do with it.</p>
