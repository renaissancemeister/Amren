			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kathy Shaidle, American Renaissance, February 2002</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p> <span class="dropcap">E</span>arlier this season, countless schools 
and households celebrated Kwanzaa. They lit black, red and green candles
 (for black skin, red blood, and the green hills of Africa), and sang 
songs about the festival&rsquo;s &#8220;seven principles,&#8221; such as faith, unity and 
creativity. Already big among blacks in the United States, Kwanzaa is 
catching on in Canada, too. Held each year from December 26 until 
January 2, Kwanzaa is increasingly seen as an appropriate multicultural 
alternative to Christmas, a holiday considered too religious and 
&#8220;Eurocentric&#8221; for public schools. But there is one not-so-insignificant 
problem with Kwanzaa. While many teachers believe it is an ancient 
African harvest festival, it was not born in pre-colonial West Africa, 
but in 1960s southern California. It is the brainchild of 
African-American radical activist, academic and convicted felon Ron 
Karenga. </p>
        <table class="quoteright">
          <tbody><tr>
            <th>The Swahili in Kwanzaa makes about as much sense as having the Irish celebrate St. Patrick&rsquo;s day by speaking Polish. </th>
          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p> In 1969, two rival radical groups were battling for control 
of the UCLA black studies program: the Black Panthers and the 
lesser-known US, or United Slaves, led by Mr. Karenga. Both groups 
sauntered around campus carrying loaded guns. Perhaps inevitably, 
violence erupted. As David Horowitz recalls in <i>Radical Son,</i> Black
 Panther John Higgins was &#8220;murdered   &mdash;   along with Al &#8216;Bunchy&rsquo; Carter   &mdash;   on
 the UCLA campus by members of Ron Karenga&rsquo;s organization.&#8221; After the 
killing, the FBI infiltrated both groups, and the United Slaves turned 
to fighting &#8220;enemies within.&#8221; The result: two female members were 
tortured by their &#8220;comrades&#8221; in May, 1970. Both alledge Mr. Karenga 
ordered and participated in their assaults. </p>
        <p> In 1999, writer Paul Mulshine published his research into 
Karenga&rsquo;s violent past on FrontPageMagazine. Mr. Mulshine found a May 
14, 1971, <i>Los Angeles Times </i>report of the victims&rsquo; testimony, 
which read: &#8220;The victims said they were living at Karenga&rsquo;s home when 
Karenga accused them of trying to [poison] him &hellip;
 When they denied it, allegedly they were beaten with an electrical cord
 and a hot soldering iron was put in [one victim&rsquo;s] mouth and against 
her face. Police were told that one of [the other victim&rsquo;s] toes was 
placed in a small vise which was allegedly tightened by one of the 
defendants. The following day  &hellip; Karenga, holding a gun, threatened to shoot both of them.&#8221; </p>
        <table class="boxleft">
          <tbody><tr>
            <td><img src="../../../../ar/2002/02/c-kwancopysml.JPG" alt="USPS Kwanzaa stamp" width="190" height="144"/></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p> Convicted of felonious assault and false imprisonment, Mr. 
Karenga was sentenced in 1971 to up to 10 years in prison. &#8220;A brief 
account of the sentencing ran in several newspapers the following day,&#8221; 
Mr. Mulshine writes. &#8220;That was apparently the last newspaper article to 
mention Karenga&rsquo;s unfortunate habit of doing unspeakable things to black
 people. After that, the only coverage came from the hundreds of news 
accounts that depict him as the wonderful man who invented Kwanzaa.&#8221; 
Shortly after his release from prison in 1975, Mr. Karenga (now armed, 
not with a pistol, but a doctorate) took over the black studies 
department at California State University, Long Beach, which he runs to 
this day. </p>
        <p> And what about Kwanzaa? The festival&rsquo;s seven days 
commemorate allegedly &#8220;traditional African&#8221; principles, such as 
&#8220;collective work&#8221; and &#8220;cooperative economics,&#8221; each referred to by a 
Swahili name. &#8220;Why did Karenga use Swahili words for his fictional 
African feast?&#8221; asks Mr. Mulshine. &#8220;American Blacks are primarily 
descended from people who came from Ghana and other parts of West 
Africa. Kenya and Tanzania   &mdash;   where Swahili is spoken   &mdash;   are thousands of 
miles away. This makes about as much sense as having Irish-Americans 
celebrate St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day by speaking Polish.&#8221; And why would Mr. 
Karenga schedule a harvest festival near the winter solstice, &#8220;a season 
when few fruits or vegetables are harvested anywhere?&#8221; </p>
        <p> This month, the religious satire magazine <i>The Door </i>likewise
 questioned Kwanzaa&rsquo;s authenticity. &#8220;Karenga cobbled together a mishmash
 of different traditions and languages and blended them with Marxist 
ideas to reflect a unified African culture that doesn&rsquo;t exist anywhere,&#8221;
 it reported. Ujamaa, or &#8220;cooperative economics&#8221;   &mdash;   one of the seven 
principles of Kwanzaa   &mdash;   is the term the socialist leader of Tanzania, 
Julius Nyerere, used for his disastrous policy of putting tens of 
thousands of Tanzanians on collective farms. </p>
        <p> &#8220;People think it&rsquo;s African, but it&rsquo;s not,&#8221; admitted Karenga in a 1978 <i>Washington Post </i>interview. &#8220;I put it around Christmas because I knew that&rsquo;s when a lot of &#8216;bloods&rsquo; [Blacks] would be partying.&#8221;  <img src="../../../../ar/graphics/textend.gif" alt="AR" width="11" height="11"/> </p>

		<p>For the last two years, I have noted a distinct lack of Kwanzaa gear (cards, decorations, etc.) in the various stores I frequent.</p>
<p>Maybe this silliness is finally dying out. Mr. Karenga can earn his fortune some other way.</p>

		<p>Perhaps &#8220;Kwanzaa&#8221; is beginning to fade away. Here in Tuscaloosa there is only a very small mention of a &#8220;Kwanzaa celebration&#8221; being held at one black church. Hopefully no one will be hurt.</p>

		<p>Despite his unnecessary spying on harmless liberals and bumbling liberal organizations that he solidly whipped in the 72 election, Nixon really did understand that ordered society was seriously threatened by the Marxist-Leninist pros and terrorist white left, as well as by the gangster Panthers. His orders to infiltrate these violent thug organizations should be applauded and taught to our historically ignorant school kids today. </p>
<p>Of course you&rsquo;d first have to teach these kids that in general the civil rights movement promoted reverse racism, subverted our national security, and that Marxism is a bad thing, and, oh yeah, what Marxism was then, and what it is today.  </p>

		<p>This holiday and other multi-cultural events and beliefs are proof positive about the stupidity of white people.  No one will ever go broke over estimating the idiocy and stupidity of white people.</p>
<p>This degree of chicanery should be a crime. Sponsored by our great government.</p>

		<p>This anti-white &#8220;Gentleman&#8221; is praising Kwanzaa. He of the Elvis was a hero to some but never meant ***** to him. This was featured on AOL. </p>
