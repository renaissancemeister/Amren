			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Judson Berger, Fox News, December 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Obama&rsquo;s decision last week to reverse U.S. policy and back a U.N. declaration on the rights of &#8220;indigenous peoples&#8221; has touched off a debate on whether the move could boost American Indian legal claims over the ills they suffered dating back to the colonial period.</p>
<p>The president announced his decision at the White House Tribal Nations Conference last week, making the United States the last nation to endorse the statement  &mdash;  the Bush administration had opposed it since it was adopted in 2007. American Indian advocacy groups cheered the move, finalized after a months-long administration review.</p>
<p>But John Bolton, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said the &#8220;abstract&#8221; document  &mdash;  which in several sections discusses the &#8220;right to redress&#8221;  &mdash;  will probably be used to fuel new legal claims. And he predicted the issue would complicate those cases more than it would help either side actually resolve them.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a kind of feel-good document that has so many unclear phrases in it that nobody&rsquo;s really sure what it means when you agree to it,&#8221; Bolton told FoxNews.com. &#8220;It&rsquo;s wrong and potentially dangerous to sign onto a document that you don&rsquo;t fully understand the implications of.&#8221;</p>
<p>The non-binding U.N. document includes dozens of provisions but generally states that indigenous people should not be discriminated against, should be able to sustain their own political and social systems, and have rights to the &#8220;lands, territories and resources which they have traditionally owned&#8221; or used.</p>
<p>Those concepts are not radically new. Americans Indians, as demonstrated by a spate of recent settlements, have legal rights to pursue discrimination and other claims against the government. Plus Obama&rsquo;s support for the document follows his signing of a congressional resolution last year that officially apologized to &#8220;native peoples&#8221; for the &#8220;violence, maltreatment and neglect&#8221; inflicted on them by U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>{snip} A disclaimer at the end declared that &#8220;nothing&#8221; in the resolution would authorize or support claims against the United States.</p>
<p>By contrast, several sections in the U.N. document explicitly outline those rights. One article in the middle of the declaration states that indigenous peoples can be entitled to &#8220;restitution&#8221; for land and resources that were damaged or confiscated from them. The document says compensation &#8220;shall take&#8221; the form of land or resources or even money.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A detailed document released by the State Department underscored the importance of the &#8220;redress provisions,&#8221; saying the government would continue to work with American Indians to accommodate their territorial rights.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Carl Horowitz, a project manager with the National Legal and Policy Center who follows discrimination cases against the federal government, used the r-word  &mdash;  reparations  &mdash;  to describe those implications.</p>
<p>&#8220;It reflects a global egalitarianism,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a shakedown.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I have been reading a lot about this issue the last few days.  It would seem to me that the inidigenous people of the United States are white folks of Birtish decent, as well as some German and Dutch.  The British Americans were the ones who founded the US and built it into the world power it was in the 20th century.  Prior to the founding of the US there were English colonies, not independent nations.  And prior to that were small tribal groups but no US.  Therefore Americans of Birtish Decent are the indigenous peoples and should decide who stays and who goes.  The people who built the nations are the indigenes, not the ones who may have wondered through.</p>
<p>I hope my British American co-citizens look kindly on their Eastern European brothers and allow us to stay.</p>

<p>Just one more indication of the pro-black, community organizer&rsquo;s desire to denigrate whites and place them in the back of the bus where he feels they belong.</p>
<p>Yes, the man is not too bright.  And yes, Glenn Beck, you were right.  He IS an anti-white racist.</p>
<p>He wants his TSA goons to profile white Americans, but not dark-skinned people, who are the real threats, because he&rsquo;s one of them.</p>

		<p>There seems to be quite a few issues with this policy, let alone the anti-White bias upon which it is based.  Taking the idea of having rights to &#8220;lands, territories and resources which they have traditionally owned&#8221;, does this mean that if I am kicked out of America due to some U.N. ruling, can I then claim land in London and have the U.N. force some sub-continent Indian type out of the U.K.?  Does it mean that only White people can claim land, territory and resouces in Europe?  That might actually be an upside to such a worldwide dictate, but just who is it that is supposed to enforce this policy?  Is there a time-line boundary to declaring a population as being &#8220;indigenous&#8221;? 200 years? 2000 years? What? Otherwise, how does the U.N. mesh this with the freedom-of-migrants policy they also embrace?  I can see this being debated forever, with the end result being (as always) decided by will-power and gun-powder.</p>

		<p>You know, sometimes I think let&rsquo;s give&rsquo;em all the reparations they want - blacks, indians, everyone.</p>
<p>In return they have to sign a contract that says they and their descendants give up all future claims, but as the recent part 2 of the black farmers shakedown showed, if you pay-em once and think the problem is solved, they&rsquo;ll come back for more a few years later.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s give hawaii independence and sign a 99 year lease for pearl harbor.  Give puerto rico independence and send all puerto ricans in this country back.  Return all refugees back to their countries of origin.  Close off all immigration.  Build a great wall on our southern border.  Deport all illegals and jail those who hire them.  Revoke all work visas too and send&rsquo;em back.  REvoke birthright citizenship retroactive 30 years to boot!</p>
<p>Then we can get back to a good way of life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not holding my breath, but it felt good to rant.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s hope the crazy judge does give back the land to Indians.  Most of it will be taken out from under White liberal elites.  Poetic justice is the kind of justice that enriches our lives and calls forth our most joyous celebrations of progress.</p>
<p>Indian land reparations are a step in the right direction to move us forward along the path toward long overdue poetic justice.  Embrace it.<br>

		<p>I truly hope the native Hawaiians kick out all the white and Asian invaders.  This would include our leader&rsquo;s sister and family.  Perhaps then his citizenship would be in doubt.  After all, he is not a Hawaiian, and he was not born in the USA, if the PC interpretation of indigeonous is upheld.  The UN is always right, in ObamaWorld.</p>

<p>Well now, do you suppose that the above idea should apply to the British, German, French, Swedish, Polish&hellip;. As well? <br>
Is there any place on earth where whites can consider it THEIR home land?</p>
<p>How long do a people have to live on a geographic area to be considered &ldquo;indigenous&rdquo;? <br>
One generation, two, twenty, a thousand?</p>

<p>Ownership to the American Indian, that term ownership, is more correctly translated and understood as meaning: &#8220;use the resources thereof&#8221;.</p>
<p>Henry Hudson when he bought Manhattan from the American Indians was actually duped. The first crooked land deal in American history. Those American Indians that &#8220;sold&#8221; the land to Henry just happened to be on the scene at the time harvesting shellfish and nothing more. They did not live in the premises and were only passing through on a foraging expedition. But &#8220;owned&#8221; the land in the sense of &#8220;using the resources thereof&#8221;!</p>

		<p>From the article:</p>
<p><i>President Obama&rsquo;s decision last week to reverse U.S. policy and back a U.N. declaration on the rights of &#8216;indigenous peoples.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>This is already happening in California, as the UN-beholden, one-world USG bows and scrapes to the demands of the Third World UN:  One of which is that Whites be dispossessed of their homelands:</p>
<p><i>The [Yoruk] tribe is asking Democratic Rep. Mike Thompson to introduce legislation that would transfer 1,200 acres of Redwood National Park and 1,200 acres of redwood stands in the Six Rivers National Forest to the tribe. The Yurok are also seeking control of Redding Rock, an offshore sea stack that is part of the California Coastal National Monument.</i></p>
<p><i>Tribal leaders see their aspirations to gain land as nothing less than essential nation-building, and are seeking congressional approval for the transfer of thousands of acres of public land from the park service, forest service and the Bureau of Land Management. The tribe also wants a boundary expansion.</i></p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/36zhb4s" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/36zhb4s</a></p>
<p>This is merely the beginning as &#8220;tribes&#8221;, backed by anti-White, one-world UN mandates, demand that the USG expand tribal boundaries and hand over prime tracts of lands.</p>
<p>This portends a SA-type scenario where the USG will demand Native Born American Whites hand over their lands to tribes   &mdash;   and back it up with force if Whites do not comply.</p>
<p>Do you think then Whites will wake up and realize the UN and USG (and the media and academia) are mortal enemies of Native Born White Americans and are engineering our complete destruction?</p>

		<p>I think most of the comments on this issue show the folly of it all. But just to quote;</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;should be able to sustain their own political and social systems, and have rights to the &ldquo;lands, territories and resources which they have traditionally owned&rdquo; or used.&#8221;</p>
<p>From what I have observed claims for most of the land area of Australia, NZ and probabbly Canada &amp; the USA are being actively pursued right at this moment. Of course Rhodesia is now history because of similar policies and South Africa is fast becoming history.</p>
<p>Huge amounts of Australia have been handed back to their mainly illiterate, unemployable disease ridden violent alcohol abusing traditional owners. In NZ the Maori are trying to take back the whole of that country and may well deny access to beaches and other costal areas. Every new project project, particularly mines now have to have the approval of traditional owners.There always seems to be some newly discovered &#8220;sacred site&#8221; to further obstruct new developments.You have to pay a fee to visit many sites in outback Australia and get a permit to take photographs at some locations.</p>
<p>Preserve their traditional political &amp; social systems. Yes pre white aboriginal life involved settling matters with spears and clubs (they still do) and child brides were the norm. Of course in all of this the THE WHITE MAN WILL STILL BE EXPECTED TO PAY for this return to traditional values. As one politician said recently &#8221; yes they can go out to their traditional hunting grounds in their traditional 4WD (suv) with their traditional High Powered hunting rifle complete with laser scopes. The double standards in this whole debate are quite unbelievable.</p>
<p>Again, I think the UN has oulived any usefulness it ever had following WW2, it has degenerated to an unelected, loony left, 3rd world dominated think tank but paid for by the wealthy western nations that they all despise.</p>
<p>Once upon a time the USA could almost tell the UN what to do, now under BHO it seems you will be going with them all the way.</p>
<p>And as America and the rest of the west slip into PC Marxist degeneration, who will take over, I think the answer is quite obvious, China. Does China have a good record re indigenous righs or anything else for that matter? I dont think so.</p>
<p>Wake up, Time is fast running out.</p>

		<p>So can european tribes make claims against non-europeans that have settled in europe?  All those arabs in France are sitting on lands the Franks have owned for 1500 years.  The turks in Germany are sitting on land owned by the tribes of germania forever.</p>
<p>On another issue: the problem with land claims for american indians in particular is that there was only something like five million native americans 500 years ago before europeans arrived.  (In the area of the present-day U.S.)</p>
<p>Most of the land was extremely empty, and most indians were nomadic and merely passed through whatever lands gave food for the moment.</p>
<p>Some tribes were settled and had villages and all that, but the amounts of land involved were miniscule compared with the surrounding empty lands.</p>
<p>A tribe of 3000 people cannot realistically lay claim to hundreds of square miles as their &#8216;hunting grounds.&rsquo; </p>
<p>When the english, french, spanish, dutch and swedes arrived in what we call the U.S. today, it was basically untamed wilderness with a small tribe here and there separated by more countless miles of woods or plains.</p>
<p>I can see giving every tribe in America some land &#8216;back&rsquo; if it is on their historical range and not much more than what would be needed to subsist and make a little money.  But I cannot see giving countless acres and miles to a tribe that never efeectively controlled such a landmass.</p>
