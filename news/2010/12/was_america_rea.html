<h1>Was America Really Ready for a Black President?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lydia Hilliard, Philadelphia Daily News, Dec. 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>TWENTY-five months ago, I watched in awe as people of all colors stood shoulder to shoulder in solidarity. Some even wept with joy. The moment was Nov. 4, 2008, the night our 44th president, Barack Obama, was elected. Our first black president!</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I remember sometime in 2007, sitting in the doctor&rsquo;s office waiting for my annual physical, browsing through a magazine. On the cover was the picture of a handsome young man whom I&rsquo;d never heard of with one of the most interesting names I&rsquo;d ever heard  &mdash;  Barack Obama, a fresh new face in the politics. But even then I possessed skepticism that the U.S. would actually elect a black president.</p>
<p>Now, post-Nov. 4, everyone appears to have jumped ship. Obama has two more years until the next election, and people have already written him off as a failure because, amazingly, he didn&rsquo;t turn out to be the messiah they&rsquo;d expected.</p>
<p>So since there seems to be very few voices espousing our president, I&rsquo;ve decided to be at least one saying, People, it&rsquo;s not over yet! </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When I hear the tea party scream about wanting their country back because this man dared to try to help the poor with no health insurance by making it the government&rsquo;s responsibility, I want to puke. But forgive me, I&rsquo;m a middle-class black woman trying to survive in this Yet to Be United States, as Maya Angelou once poignantly said. I understand how creating a universal-health-care system would certainly cost big business real money, but if it&rsquo;s a choice between their profits or my 87-year-old Nanna getting a much-needed procedure, I think I&rsquo;m going to go with door No. 2, Monty! </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yes, there have been some missteps, but I respect and admire a man who takes responsibility for whatever hand he may have had in it. Instead of pointing fingers and preparing for a Republican takeover, why not (for however long he has left) put your money where your political mouths are? Give solutions. </p>
<p>At the end of the day, to some people, Obama is just another black man, not good enough. And no matter what he does, he never will be.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So whether or not America was ready for a black president is a moot point. He&rsquo;s here. The annals of history will record the name Barack Hussein Obama along with Kennedy, Lincoln, Jefferson and Roosevelt, among many others. Now it&rsquo;s time for his supporters to stand up and support the man we cried and cheered for two years ago.</p>
<p>In the meantime, this African-American, middle-class mother of four says  &mdash;  Go, Obama! Yes we still can! <br>

		<p>He&rsquo;s black, she&rsquo;s black so that&rsquo;s why she worships him. That is the sole reason. Whatever he does or doesn&rsquo;t do would make no difference whatever, which is why people like this should just be ignored since they lack the capability to be objective. As for the rest of us, we look for substance and ability in a president, something that&rsquo;s been lacking and is becoming more apparent daily even to his former supporters. </p>

		<p>She&rsquo;s right about it &#8220;not being over yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, knowing that this community organizer wanted the presidency to promote blacks everywhere he can get away with, not many of us are ecstatic about his remaining two years in office.</p>
<p>Putting a black in as NASA chief who thinks his main job directing the space agency is to make friends with Muslims is really bizarre.  Too, he has a communications czar who worships Marxism and Marxists like Hugo Chavez and Castro, to name but two.  There are many more.  </p>
<p>Every one of his appointments that I can determine so far is some kind of flake, oddball or misfit who hates whites and/or is a self-hating white, all of whom hate this country and want to change it to their level of stupidity and naivete.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s my opinion, based on volumes of expert analysis, that he could well create an even worse economic scenario than he already has.  An economic collapse has a better chance of success under this incompetent than anyone the Republicans can come up with.</p>
<p>The above black female should admit at the beginning of her opinion piece that she is like all other blacks who place race over everything and show their loyalty only to other blacks or black causes anywhere in the world, over and above their own non-black countrymen.  Most all blacks are traitors to their country.  The only way this country could get their loyalty is if it were mostly all black, and they were running things everywhere.</p>
<p>So, if she just loves Obama now, it wouldn&rsquo;t matter if he destroyed the nation through his ineptness, she would still love him then simply because he&rsquo;s a fellow black.  She&rsquo;s just telling us how most blacks think.<br>

<p>She probably doesn&rsquo;t read very much.  Just who is it that really wants &#8220;universal (crummy) health care?&#8221;  It&rsquo;s big business that wants to offload the health insurance benefit to the taxpayers.  No, dear.  It&rsquo;ll cost taxpayers real money that we don&rsquo;t have.</p>

<p>Big business would be thrilled at government run health care. Ford, GM, and Chrysler really want to help pay the doctor bills of all their employees? Only a few specific businesses would lose with government run health care. Now maybe some of their employees, who vote for congress, don&rsquo;t want &#8216;free&rsquo; health care. Then again the government, and employee unions, own majority shares of Chrysler and GM now. Can it be? Well to do democrats will actually buy an American car? </p>
<p>In her earlier blather I suspect she&rsquo;s putting words in tea partier&rsquo;s mouths. They&rsquo;re not Maya Angelou, apparently, worthy of being quoted. </p>

		<p>How many people are aware that the Communist Party of the United States decided not to run a presidential candidate because they decided that the Democrats are now &#8220;progressive&#8221; enough?  (&#8220;Progressive&#8221; is the American word for &#8220;socialist&#8221;.  If a progressive complains that this isn&rsquo;t so, ask him to name one policy on his agenda that isn&rsquo;t also on the agenda of European socialist parties.)</p>

		<p>This is just a question. Can anyone answer it for me?</p>
<p>1. Name one place in the World where blacks have control and it is safe to walk the streets, Even in broad daylight and even if you yourself are black?</p>
<p>2. Other than waiting to creep in on what other have built where in the world is there a place or town where blacks have come in and built it into a place of any value?</p>
<p>3. If it were not for all the AA stuff even after 200 years in America how many of these high paid government jobs would be taken by lazy goof offs?</p>
<p>4. Can anyone name one invention that blacks have actually invented? I am not talking about those claimed by them which are very easily proven to be false, but something real?</p>

		<p>The truth is Barack Obama was never qualified to be President of the United States, regardless of his &ldquo;skin color&rdquo;. And to this day, it is beyond me of how he was ever nominated except for the fact that he is &lsquo;black&rdquo; and the MSM played the race card to the hilt. </p>
<p>As a business man of 23 years, it struck me hard when I found out that Barack Obama has never once in his adult life, ever run a business. Not even so much as a lemonade stand. So, how in the world was he ever eligible to run the most powerful nation of the free world without at least that on his resume? Seriously, how did this get overlooked by the majority? I had no idea there was that much &ldquo;guilt&rdquo; in the U.S. </p>
<p>Sadly now, everybody realizes that it was Hollywood and the liberal MSM that was drowning everyone in their &ldquo;Change&rdquo; Kool-Aid. Well people, you got your &ldquo;change&rdquo; and unfortunately it was for the worst. Meanwhile, I&rsquo;m sure this author will stand beside Obama just as the captain of the Titanic went down with his ship.</p>

		<p>While I didn&rsquo;t vote for Obama I am glad that he won.  He is waking up a few non-hyphenated Americans as to what the US will be when the blacks and browns take over.  Maybe, just maybe, we can get out of the mess we Europeans-Americans are in.  I am hoping for a divorce, quite frankly.  My biggest fear with Obama in the Executive Mansion are the disasters he has and will put on the Supreme Court.  But maybe that is just another &#8220;push them/us over the edge&#8221; that we should be thankful for.</p>

		<p>Well, she&rsquo;s partially correct.  He is a Black man, and he is NOT good enough.  Not because his skin is Black, but for the simple and unavoidable FACT that if his skin had been White, he would never have had the slightest chance of being elected.  </p>
<p>Indeed, if his skin were White, a man of his qualifications would never have made it into Harvard, much less into national politics.</p>

		<p>Not one word of recognition that Obama was elected <br>
precisely because he was a black man. Decades of mass<br>
media assault on the common sense survival instincts of the <br>
white population made Obama possible. Getting a people to <br>
commit demographic, racial and financial suicide takes<br>
alot of work. Millions of whites voted for Obama because<br>
they were told it was the noble thing to do&hellip;.never mind<br>
his incompetence, his glaring racial hatreds, his non existent<br>
accoplishments. The results were utterly predictable and just<br>
as predictable was this writers default to screaming racism.<br>

		<p>Anyone who quotes Maya Angelou (real name Marguerite Annie Johnson) on any subject whatever has already tossed all credibility out the window.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t enough that amerika actually elected a black marxist fraud to prove to Lydia Hilliard&rsquo;s satisfaction that the US isn&rsquo;t the Racist hell she wants to believe.  No, she now expects us to <i>re</i>-elect him as well, because&hellip;because he&rsquo;s black.</p>
<p>You know, if a White had written an article of this tone praising a deluded and incompetent White president on the sole basis of his race, the author would have been pilloried as a Racist Hater. The fact that Lydia Hilliard is able to spew her black racism all over the <i>Philadelphia Daily News</i> without such censure should give her some clue why us Evil White Racists are sick and tired of the anti-White double standards that put Caliph Obongo in the White (sic) House in the first place.</p>
<p>Go cry on &#8220;Maya&rsquo;s&#8221; shoulder, Lydia.  We&rsquo;re not listening any more.<br>

		<p>How in the world did this nitwit get a job writing for a major newspaper? Wait, I think I may know the answer.</p>
<p>In any event, as she &#8220;watched in awe&#8221; as Obama was elected, she writes that &#8220;people of all colors stood shoulder to shoulder&hellip;some even wept with joy.&#8221; Really? I didn&rsquo;t see anyone around me weep with joy. If some were weeping, I guarantee you that joy played no part in their tears.</p>
<p>This knucklehead columnist comes off as a closet racist and an embarrassment to so-called educated blacks. Her policy analysis is linked only to how much the federal government can hand her - as if a giant ATM with an unlimited supply of money exists in Washington, DC. Certainly, there is no concern - or even a clue - that this money comes from somewhere and has to be repaid. </p>
<p>She is so focused on race she would have voted for a Willie Horton/O.J. Simpson presidential ticket. </p>
<p>If she had any brains she would realize that all the goodies her undeserving people have received over the past 50 years came from whites. And ironically, it will be Obama&rsquo;s incompetence that will cause these freebies to dry up as the economy continues to falter.   </p>

		<p>I would not give this woman&rsquo;s opinion any more credence than I would any black persons opinion on the black people they choose to elect. They&rsquo;ll sing the praises of and tell you how wonderful politicians like Alcee Hastings and Marion Berry are. And they will keep electing Hastings even though he was impeached and they kept electing Berry even after his arrests for crack cocaine possession and frequenting prostitutes. Which proves all they care about is the color of the persons skin, not the content of their character.</p>

You have to give it to them though, they got one thing right. A tax protest movement is by its very nature &#8220;raciss&#8221;. The Tea Party ought to quit dancing around that issue.

		<p>Although my wife and I live in NJ now, we were NYers for the majority of our lives. So as NYers, and having lived through the mayorality (one term) of David Dinkins, we knew very well what having a black president would be like. Most of my family was shocked at what we were saying to them about Obama and of course, the younger people in the family thought I was racist (they&rsquo;re college people). But a couple of them have since admitted I was right. So there may be some hope for our college educated people after all. I shouldn&rsquo;t stereotype them all as idiots. Actually, I know they aren&rsquo;t idiots, They&rsquo;re just products of a massive propaganda campaign that&rsquo;s been focused on them throughout their lives. We&rsquo;re all just products of our experiences.</p>

		<p>Her commentary is based on racial preference, paranoia and a misunderstanding of allocation of finite resources.  Many who opposed universal health care were focused on how it was going to be paid for, deception in the process of passing it and that in most places in the world where they have tried it Universal health care is bankruping them and/or has severe limitations.  The US has built a culture of entitlements, lack of knowledge of how wealth is made (it is not made by the government), a desire to redistribute that wealth, and a growing sub-segment of folks who are wealth takers cradle-to-grave.  We celebrate diversity, yet aren&rsquo;t allowed to mention what the differences are, and we forbid stereotyping even though it is obvious.  Our government has yet to address the root causes of the economic downturn, not the least of which is the abundance of paper fixes to a long term slide in global competitiveness and mis-allocation of resources.  <br>
This human interest narrative is a economically ignorant by a politically biased author who glibly expresses why her 87 Nanna gets free care.  Other than &#8220;fairness&#8221;, how does the system pay for that?  On the supply side without the motivator of profits how would she provide incentives for others to take the personal risks to build and maintain a wealth producing business?  And who benefits from those profits?  A third of profits goes to taxes, other pieces of successful companies go to pension funds and personal retirements.  Pro basketball and football contracts are excessive.  How about a 75% tax on pro employment contracts over $1 million?  Fair?   And on the demand side, assuming Nanna has worked and retired at 68, she has been supported by the state for 20 years.  Where does that money come from?  Most likely it is far more than she has contributed in her lifetime.  Does Nanna take some responsibility for her health by eating properly and exercising?  Or is it society&rsquo;s responsibility to take care of all her health needs with the latest and most expensive technology independent of personal responsibility.  Until the debate is elevated from the personal gimme viewpoint we will be buying votes with entitlements that can&rsquo;t be paid for.  Its a new world, our economy is no longer expanding at the rate it once was, and the promises of future benefits are no longer affordable.  The debt of borrowing and empty promises is upon us.  Expectations and behaviors must change as the reality of insufficient resources to pay for them is here.  Many will complain, stamp their feet and demand more, others will meet the challenges of a new world and make a difference through innovation, hard work and productivity.  We know which camp the author Lynda Hilliard is in.</p>

		<p>&#8220;When I hear the tea party scream about wanting their country back because this man dared to try to help the poor with no health insurance by making it the government&rsquo;s responsibility, I want to puke. But forgive me, I&rsquo;m a middle-class black woman trying to survive in this Yet to Be United States, as Maya Angelou once poignantly said. I understand how creating a universal-health-care system would certainly cost big business real money, but if it&rsquo;s a choice between their profits or my 87-year-old Nanna getting a much-needed procedure, I think I&rsquo;m going to go with door No. 2, Monty! &#8220;</p>
<p>Well, I sure hope that all those guilt-ridden, self-loathing, white liberals and &#8220;conservative&#8221; whites who are too lazy and too stupid to bother investigating what a &#8216;neo-con&rsquo; is and what a &#8220;neo-con&#8221; stands for - will read this statement by this black woman several times over and let its message slowly sink in to their brains.  What?   Too lazy to do that?   Too busy watching your TV sports and can&rsquo;t afford the time?   Well, let me help you to understand what this black woman is revealing to the disaffected and angry white majority.  Listen up, all you guilt-ridden, &#8216;please oh please, don&rsquo;t call me a racist&rsquo;, white Tea Party types who claim to think race doesn&rsquo;t matter or race doesn&rsquo;t exist.  </p>
<p>Thanks to the last 40-50 years of whites feeling guilty and sorry for blacks, and as result of both of those misguided, media induced and cleverly cultivated emotions - whites have made concession after concession to minority demands. White liberals have helped to instill inside minorities the sense of entitlement, the notion that &#8216;whitey owes them&rsquo;, and that no matter how much of their financial resources are confiscated by their enemy government and used to pay for goodies that blacks and other minorities demand, it&rsquo;s never enough.   No matter how much affirmative action oriented discrimination is imposed upon the white majority that places shackles on the ankles of whites in areas of employment, promotion, college admissions, housing, and countless other areas of both personal or professional pursuits in our society, it&rsquo;s never going to be enough and blacks like this woman will never be satisfied.  </p>
<p>In essence, what this woman is revealing to the whites she is attempting to chastise - is that her definition of the word &#8216;racist&rsquo; now includes any expression of resistance by whites to any attempt by non-whites to reach into their wallets and confiscate more and more of their hard-earned money.   Minority demands, no matter how outrageous, no matter how expensive, no matter how punitive or financially painful they are to the white majority - can never be opposed or resisted - this is how this black woman, and millions of other minorities, defines &#8216;racism&rsquo;.  </p>
<p>Minorities have been taught by white liberals and by their minority race hustling leaders that the white man&rsquo;s paycheck belongs to them.  Whites, on the other hand, cling to the old-fashioned idea that the fruits of their labor our theirs, to be used to take care of their family&rsquo;s needs and financial responsibilities - in order for them to remain as self-sufficient as possible and not have to become a leech that relies upon government handouts or income redistribution programs.   </p>
<p>Hence, it should be clearly obvious that these two groups of people - lumping whites into one camp, and minorities into the other camp, have a parasite-host relationship and one which is increasingly untenable.  Or, perhaps a better word would be incompatible?      </p>
<p>Oh, and one other thing that I&rsquo;d like to mention - that this Obama-loving black Marxist-Socialist woman failed to address, with regards to her hero&rsquo;s attempt to seize control over the entire health care industry.  I&rsquo;ve been reading countless, disturbing news articles that are citing huge medical insurance premium cost increases and they are being attributed to this ObamaCare fiasco.    I&rsquo;ve also been reading countless news articles that cite a growing number of big name companies and corporations who are deciding to cancel their existing health insurance programs for their employees, thanks to Obamacare, and pay the penalty - which was deliberately set at an amount that is cheaper than most annual insurance policy premiums, and which I believe was all part of some backroom &#8216;deal&rsquo; that was cut between our corrupt politicians and these big corporations - who&rsquo;ve been scheming for decades on how they could terminate their health insurance benefits and shaft their employees.  </p>
<p>So, once again, we are reminded of the seldom cited but absolutely on target quote from Thomas Jefferson:  </p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing is more certainly written in the book of fate than that these people [blacks] are to be free. Nor is it less certain that the two races, equally free, cannot live in the same government. Nature, habit, opinion has drawn indelible lines of distinction between them.&#8221;   &mdash;  Thomas Jefferson: Autobiography, 1821. ME 1:72 </p>
<p>Indelible lines of distinction, indeed.    News Flash:  The only solution to this parasite-host fatal disease that is threatening to destroy America, and which will certainly destroy White European people,  is the break up of the US and the formation of ethnostates.   </p>

<p>- The United States was united by white people who chose to build a great nation from many political units, and then it expanded from there in an orderly fashion, albeit with a few major bumps along the way, but united, nonetheless.</p>
<p>The policies of the Left - massive third world immigration of every conceivable race on the planet, race replacement in whole swaths of the country, declaring war on whites, overtaxing whites, destroying the engine of capitalism in some childish utopian fantasy of social justice, even replacing the language and culture of the land - all of these things will cause the eventual destruction of the &#8220;United&#8221; states and bring about an era of chaos and violence on the magnitude of Rwanda.  They never entertain this possibility in their planning, though.</p>

		<p>Obama is certainly a big spender (although any Republican in his place would have adopted similar policies re bank bailouts and stimulus), but not a socialist.</p>
<p>he is more a Clintonite centrist who will do anything to keep big business happy, while at the same time slinging huge amounts of money to his various constituents to keep them pacified while structurally, the United States disintegrates into a Third World country.</p>
<p>his insane open borders policy is no different from Bush&rsquo;s (Bush may have been slightly worse), and likewise has nothing to do with socialism:<br>
the tsunami of Third World emigrants comes at the behest of corporate America, not despite their wishes.</p>
<p>neither traditional Republicans or conservatives what is sanctioned such suicidal policies, but now they do so on both sides of the aisle.</p>
<p>the same is true in Europe.</p>
<p>none of this insanity has much to do with traditional right or left wing politics (how much immigration didn&rsquo;t we have during FDR&rsquo;s 4 for terms??????)</p>
<p>traditional left-wing politics was Angie mass immigration, and was essentially about wages, benefits, job security, bread-and-butter issues of working America.</p>
<p>a multicultural left is some kind of zombie that has nothing to do with politics for say, and the suicidal policies of Western civilization on both sides of the Atlantic are kind of brain fever.</p>

&#8220;The larger the mob, the harder the test. In small areas, before small electorates, a first-rate man occasionally fights his way through, carrying even the mob with him by force of his personality. But when the field is nationwide, and the fight must be waged chiefly at second and third hand, and the force of personality cannot so readily make itself felt, then all the odds are on the man who is, intrinsically, the most devious and mediocre – the man who can most easily adeptly disperse the notion that his mind is a virtual vacuum.</p>
<p>The Presidency tends, year by year, to go to such men. As democracy is perfected, the office represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. We move toward a lofty ideal. On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart&rsquo;s desire at last, and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron. - H.L. Mencken&#8221;</p>

		<p>The United States, as a success story, is the story of White people. Blacks have never, and never will be, capable of creating a European-style civilization. Furthermore, Blacks have a deep, visceral hatred of White people. Therefore, any Black who might make a decent president of the U.S. would have to be a rare exception to the general rule. And there are certainly thousands of Whites infinitely more qualified to be president of the U.S. than those very few rare Black exceptions.</p>
<p>But Obama is not one of those exceptions in any case. Obama is a deeply stupid affirmative-action case who hates White people all the more because everything he has he owes to cowardly, traitorous Whites. Obama is also a case of arrested development. He is an angry, sullen, overgrown adolescent with an extremely fragile ego. In other words he is like most Blacks and non-White Hispanics. Obama has simply learned, like many precocious children, to seem to be a mature, intelligent credit to his elders. In Obama&rsquo;s case his elders are his left-wing fascist handlers.</p>
<p>A Black president in the United States is an irrelevant contradiction in terms and an unworthy goal to be pursued.</p>

<p>The issue is not whether America was ready for a black president.  America elected a black president, so pretty clearly the U.S. is not the racist cauldron the race hucksters pretend it to be.  The real issue is that America was not ready for the worst president in history.</p>

		<p>If I hear or read one more instance of any obnoxious, IQ of minus 2,  poorly informed white nitwit hoisting up the names of Alan Keyes, Clarence Thomas or Colin Powell as some kind of mythical, suicidally sought after, and always-elusive &#8216;Magic black&rsquo; - I am pretty sure I will literally vomit.  </p>
<p>Listen up, fellow white men and women: This insane and nauseating search for the &#8220;Magic black&#8221; (or Magic any-other-non-white-genie) is clearly a form of cleverly induced mental illness in the white race.  The Cultural Marxist enemy of our race, who controls our media - Hollywood, TV, magazine and book publishing companies, most of the newspapers, etc. - has used that media control to plant this self-destructive seed inside your sponge-like brains.</p>
<p>It is past time to squeeze that brain sponge and drain those destructive seeds.   Engage your brains, people.    Pay attention when Hollywood rolls out disaster movies where the character who &#8216;saves&rsquo; the day is a wise, all-knowing, noble black man.   Learn to pick up on the not-so-subtle messages that are driving these totally unrealistic themes in our various forms of entertainment.</p>
<p>You are being programmed, brainwashed, mentally conditioned and emotionally and psychologically manipulated into longing to find some black or other unrealistically glorified non-white who will rush in, to save you and save your race, and to rescue your nation from the very destruction that the Cultural Marxists have as their #1 objective.</p>
<p>News Flash:   The Cultural Marxists know full well that the chances of any black or other non-white who they have artificially and deviously hoisted up as the coveted &#8216;savior&rsquo; of White Western Civilization is not going to achieve that goal, partly because the Cultural Marxist handlers who put him there will make sure he won&rsquo;t, even if he or she was so inclined - which they aren&rsquo;t.  But, when whites are snookered into hitching their wagon to yet another phony Magic black or Minority Messiah - it prevents the white race from finally understanding that they are in a low-level battle for the very survival of their specific race and for the preservation of White, Western Civilization. </p>
<p>Conclusion:  Whites cannot depend, or rely upon, any other race for our salvation or for our survival.  We must take control of our racial and cultural survival ourselves.  We must shake off this brain disease that our enemies have infected us with, and come to grips with the fact that ethnic competition cannot work in our favor without our race adopting ethnic loyalty and ethnic solidarity.  Step one in this struggle is to purge from power and influence every last white elitist leader who supports policies or laws which harm our legitimate ethnic interests as white people. </p>
<p>Tip:   Any association whatsoever with this Trotskyite gang of globalist, war mongering, police-state creating neo-conservatives - is a clear indication that the white politician in question is anti-white, because neo-cons are universally anti-white - except when it comes to sending white men or women off to fight and die in their endless wars.  In which case, these neo-cons are pro-white long enough to get whites killed, which ought to show us all what they really think of the white race.  </p>
<p>Step two is to find new white leaders to replace the white race traitors, and to monitor their every move, and hold their feet to the fire on every issue that affects the legitimate ethnic interests of our people.  Adopt a zero tolerance for race betrayal and punish those who engage in that kind of treachery by removing them from office at the earliest opportunity.  </p>
<p>Step three involves the topic of America First, European Nationalism.  No white political leader who claims to be on our side should be allowed to place the interests or the agenda of any foreign nation ahead of the interests of White America.    White America&rsquo;s interests  must come first, second, and third - and if a white leader is even the tiniest bit hesitant on that priority, then they are not on our side and should be thrown out of office.  </p>

<p>And that is precisely why we&rsquo;re in trouble. We&rsquo;re not &#8220;rayciss&#8221; enough. The majority of white Americans - the people who built this country - have stopped looking out for their self-interest.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think much of Maya Angelou&rsquo;s poems either but she is an excellent writer, if we can believe she wrote her autobiographical stories herself. The problem with her stories is they are so much about getting over on and taking advantage of whites and finding humor in it. If her race were different she would be considered one of the most reviled purveyors of hate. Instead she&rsquo;s considered to be raising consciousness and fighting against the system. The only flaw in this leftist view is that, despite the &#8216;awesome evil power of corporations&rsquo;, she is the system. </p>

		<p>forget about logic, or right or wrong, race trumps everything with these people. just look at colin powell, condelizza rice, and jc watts, all are black conservatives, but voted for obama. and all of the black hilary supporters jumped ship and voted for obama. anymore proof needed? remember o.j. was innocent.</p>

		<p>The odd thing is that she is supporting Oabama even though he has been a civil liberties disaster.  Look at the recent implementation of x-ray scanners and such at the airports by Obama&rsquo;s TSA  &mdash;  and with more, apparently, to follow at ground transportation terminals.  Where are the &#8220;freedom riders&#8221; when you need them?   </p>
<p>On other fronts, Obama is continuing the Bush policy of endless war in the Middle East while keeping America&rsquo;s southern frontiers open to third world mass migration.  Really, Obama has to be seen as a continuation of the policies of the prior administration(s). </p>
<p>All this is a sad commentary on the increasing gullibility of American voters. </p>

<p>What surprises me are the stupid Whites who vote for these clowns thinking the next black will be different. The only thing different will be his bad taste jewelry, putrid Cologne, and his preference in clothes. All the rest remains the same.</p>

		<p>The debate over universal health coverage was over between 50-100 years ago in most other western countries which is covered by government for those not &#8216;toping up&rsquo; with a private insurer.</p>
<p>To me, as an Australian, it sounds as if universal coverage represents another mass transfer of money and resources from Whites to Blacks.   This might have been acceptable when Blacks were 10% of the US population but now with non-White Hispanics and Blacks combined making up nearly 30%% it may very well be felt.  It will certainly attract more &#8216;immigrants&rsquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps it can be traded of with an end to racial quotas?</p>

		<p>Luke #38: Excellent post. Now, for those who are fed up, it is time to make a few telephone calls, because the DREAM Act has passed the House of Representatives, and is now in the Senate. </p>
<p>Tell the Senate to Vote &#8220;NO&#8221; on Amnesty for Illegal Aliens, or we can say good-bye to what is left of our Country, demographically, and politically. </p>
<p>You will need to get a pen and paper to write all these Senate bills down, because once you have your Senator&rsquo;s Aide on the phone, there is a list of these bills which will need a &#8220;NO&#8221; Vote from them.</p>
<p>The Senate passed S 510, which is the &#8220;Food Saftey Modernization Act&#8221; which had a clause to raise taxes in it. Since only the House of Represenatives can raise Taxes, the Senate bill 510, was re-worked, and passed as a new House bill, and was sent back to the Senate for a new vote. Tell them to VOTE &#8220;NO&#8221; on this &#8220;Food Safety&#8221; bill. </p>
<p>The &#8220;Food Safety&#8221; bill has nothing to do with Safety, but will expand the FDA, which will regulate all food grown in the U.S., and will Criminilize the growing of vegetables in U.S. Citizens&rsquo; yards. They even Crimininalize the saving of seeds, for future plantings. This bill protects Monsanto and AgriBusiness,with their Genetically Modified foods, while it hurts the Family Farmers, and Organic Farmers Markets.</p>
<p>More information, and a direct Petition regarding this &#8220;Food Safety&#8221; bill is available at Farm to Consumer Legal Defense Fund.com . You can also read about it at Natural News, at www.NaturalNews.com . This is URGENT, and needs your attention.</p>
<p>Senate Bill 2099 provides for a $50.00 per gun tax, on every lawful gun owner in the United States, which will be required to be placed on their 1040 Income Tax Return. It also requires fingerprinnts. This would be for every year that you own the guns. This is also Unconstitutional, and it abridges the Second Amendment. </p>
<p>Currently, fingerprints are already taken at the County level, for Concealed Carry permits, which are then run by the State Police, and FBI. This is just more unjust interference with our Constitutional Rights. Tell the Senate to Vote &#8220;NO&#8221; on SB 2099.</p>
<p>The U.N. Small Arms Treaty is designed to take all firearms away from American Citizens that are now lawful owners of such guns, per their Second Amendment Right. This needs to be stopped immediately. </p>
<p>Only the Senate can Ratify Treaties between the U.S. and Foreign Nations, so it will be up to the Senate to ratify this Treaty. Tell them to Vote &#8220;NO&#8221; on this Unconstitutional Treaty, which would submit the United States Citizens to a Foreign Law. </p>
<p>Of course, the new Healthcare Reform Act needs to be repealed. Tell your Senators, and House Representative, to do so. </p>
<p>I know that no one, or very few, has heard that the current Admin. is trying to take control over the Internet. There is such a petition now before the FCC to take it over, and censor it. You will need to sign this Petition and tell them &#8220;NO&#8221; in order to keep the Internet a vehicle for free Communication, Political debate, and for Business purposes.  The FCC will need these Peitions from you when they decide this matter on December 20, 2010. </p>
<p>Notice how this Internet bill, along with the rest mentioned here, has gotten no Media attention at all.</p>
<p>The Toll Free number at the Capital Switchboard is 1-866-996-5161. It&rsquo;s time for you to call, and do your Civic duty. Tell your friends and family to do the same.</p>

I certainly do agree with you and actively encourage my &#8216;peers&rsquo; whenever I possibly can, to wake up and free their minds from the liberal virus / disease and look around and see the obvious evidence that you have mentioned that&rsquo;s &#8216;served&rsquo; up to us all via the media. Most of them think I&rsquo;m either insane, paranoid, taking it all way to seriously (it&rsquo;s just entertainment isn&rsquo;t it?), a big nasty fascist, racist,nazi etc, etc. Possibly the worst of all are the people that say, &#8216;oh&hellip;I&rsquo;ve never even thought about it!&rsquo;<br>
Luke, we&rsquo;re out-numbered about a million, or at least a few hundred thousand, to-one and it actually seems to be getting worse. This task seems, and is, a colossal one, but this current trend of apathetic brain-rot will fade as all trends fade. It will only take a small but significantly informed and properly organised proportion of the White populace to make, or start to make inroads that may lead somewhere for our futute, for our future is what&rsquo;s at stake.<br>

How America intentionally targeted its engineers for genocide</p>
<p>Beginning in the mid 1990s america began flooding the country with foreign </p>
<p>engineers on the H-1B visa. There were few to no protections for american </p>
<p>engineers. Many of these engineers were hired by Indian body shops who claimed </p>
<p>them to be working in outer kansas where the prevailing wage might be 40,000, </p>
<p>then contracted them out to places like boston, San Francisco, and New York City. </p>
<p>The engineers themselves often worked for a spending account and expenses, with a </p>
<p>part of their salary being paid tax free into accounts back in India. There were </p>
<p>no protections to stop a company from laying off their american engineers and </p>
<p>replacing them with foreign workers. While this is called a temporary visa it is </p>
<p>in fact a solid path to citizenship. The three year visa is easily renewed and </p>
<p>then if a green card application is in process the foreign worker never has to </p>
<p>leave. In truth, they never really have to leave regardless as there is so little </p>
<p>enforcement. The engineer once here can easily transfer the visa and change jobs. </p>
<p>The numbers imported are staggering. Keep in mind that there are only 4-4.5 </p>
<p>million engineering jobs in america with software engineers which make up the </p>
<p>bulk of the flood of foreign workers probably amounting to less that 2 million </p>
<p>jobs in the country total. However, during the past fifteen years we have flooded </p>
<p>the country with over SIX MILLION engineers on the H-1B visa. Once Indians make </p>
<p>it into any kind of upper management - as was the case with Dell and Adobe - they </p>
<p>embark on a process of wholesale replacement of american engineering staff with </p>
<p>indians. Many companies now have engineering rooms that look like Bombay. Adobe </p>
<p>even has half their kitchen cooks serving up Indian food. The numbers get even </p>
<p>worse when you realize that many use the H-1B to get married and that under the </p>
<p>visa all wives get to work in america as well effectively DOUBLING the numbers!</p>
<p>It gets worse. In 2008 and 2009 they imported a total of 490,000 foreign workers </p>
<p>on the H-1B visa, a time when the economy was shedding hundreds of thousands of </p>
<p>engineering jobs. While Bill Gates lies to congress with a straight face claiming </p>
<p>he needs the best and brightest workers dozens of personal statements from </p>
<p>seasoned engineers make it clear - not only are these people far from being the </p>
<p>best and brightest, many are absolutely incompetent. What happens is the few </p>
<p>senior Indians cover for the new arrivals for several years until they become </p>
<p>barely competent. Why are they such horrible engineers? In India a fly by night </p>
<p>system of unacredited universities - Over Six Thousand - were created. Many are </p>
<p>not much more than rooms above restaurants. Many of the so called degrees </p>
<p>required by the visa are actually granted in six months while a four year degree </p>
<p>is forged. </p>
<p>It gets worse than even that. The bodyshops then forge work histories going back </p>
<p>several years for people that actually have only six months training. Many even </p>
<p>post fake job ads and then use the best american resumes as examples for fake </p>
<p>work experience for their new recruits. </p>
<p>Why would indians go to such lengths? Not only is the onus to escape poverty very </p>
<p>strong, but for many males, getting a H-1B means they get an arranged marriage </p>
<p>with the best prettiest women in India. What American male wouldnt cheat if he </p>
<p>could get his dream girl in exchange for some lying?</p>
<p>The reason that our economy was so exposed to these foreign body shops is because </p>
<p>congress passed the most vile law ever banning engineers from working as </p>
<p>contractors directly. This is the ONLY SUCH LAW of its kind in the whole of the </p>
<p>IRS law base. What this means is that all contract jobs then go through body </p>
<p>shopping agencies who do nothing whatsoever except place people. This left the </p>
<p>door wide open. False reporting of the &#8220;cap&#8221; numbers which is currently 85,000 </p>
<p>per year does not include the exempt from cap filings which routinely push the </p>
<p>numbers to 200-400,000 visas granted per year. And records show that even the CAP </p>
<p>is exceeded year after year. </p>
<p>Lets review the damage that has been done. First the unemployment rate for </p>
<p>american software engineers.. if you use basic math&hellip; is effectively 100%. Only </p>
<p>the absolute top 1% gifted superstars are still employed and only because the </p>
<p>companies need them. Rates for contracting have been reduced 80%. Yes, thats </p>
<p>right, if you used to be able to earn 100 dollars an hour the new rate is around </p>
<p>20. If you can get the job. As well as damage to our engineers, there is </p>
<p>increadible damage to our nation. By sending a clear message that if you study </p>
<p>engineering you will face constant hassles, low wages, and unemployment, millions </p>
<p>of college students began shifting to other fields that pay much more for less </p>
<p>work - such as law, sales, and marketing. Not only do these jobs pay better, they </p>
<p>are much easier, have shorter hours, and are stable. Many engineering projects </p>
<p>last only about a year and often there is big turn over which is why it was so </p>
<p>important to be able to become contractors. Another cost is in the people who are </p>
<p>commiting suicide faced with long term poverty after a life of working hard and </p>
<p>getting a top education. There are several well publicized cases including Kevin </p>
<p>Flannagan and Joe Stack but thousands more occur quietly every day. Finally there </p>
<p>is the damage to the companies themselves as the truth is they have replaced a </p>
<p>very bright team of american engineers with hopeless Indians who are incompetent. </p>
<p>Clear clases of this include Windows Vista&rsquo;s failures, </p>
<p>An adobe insider wrote this about his experience &#8220;Two of the 4 laid off Americans </p>
<p>in our group were REPLACED with two foreign Indian workers from within the </p>
<p>company. One took my old manager&rsquo;s job, and one took the Windows installer </p>
<p>engineer&rsquo;s job. The new Indian manager who replaced my boss came running around </p>
<p>with a big smile on his face shaking everyone&rsquo;s hand the next day with glee </p>
<p>introducing himself and telling everyone he would be managing the group &#8220;going </p>
<p>forward&#8221;. He could barely constrain his excitement. Both Indian workers were </p>
<p>directly promoted to their new positions by the senior Indian manager in our </p>
<p>group&hellip;. So in the end the senior Indian engineering manager took the merger and </p>
<p>layoffs as a prime opportunity to slash Americans from the workforce, and to </p>
<p>promote Indians into the same positions. I&rsquo;ve seen this happen at nearly every </p>
<p>company I&rsquo;ve worked at.&#8221;</p>
<p>From Cisco &#8220;I was the last American to work in the Oracle Database Administration </p>
<p>department of approximately 25 individuals at this site. Almost all of the </p>
<p>remaining DBAs are from India on H1-B visas.&#8221;</p>
<p>The worst cost is when the Indians cause whole projects or companies to die. </p>
<p>Examples include Quark&rsquo;s Alukah Kamar CEO (fired), Skype&rsquo;s engineering manager  </p>
<p>Madhu Yarlagadda (fired), MIT Media Lab Asia (canceled), Intel Whitefield </p>
<p>processor project (cancelled, Indian staff canned for excessive fraud and expense </p>
<p>fraud), Apple R&D; (CLOSED in India in 2006 due to fraud and incompetence), the </p>
<p>ComAir reservation system, the Boeing Dreamliner ILS and collision detection </p>
<p>software (written by HCL, banned by FAA), HSBC ATMs (software taken over by </p>
<p>Indians, failed in 2006), State of Indiana $867 billion FAILED IBM project (using </p>
<p>mostly Indian engineers), and World Bank has banned working with Satyam, Wipro, </p>
<p>Megasoft, GAP (India), Nestor Pharma and Pure Pharma for stealing customers data. </p>
<p>For engineers the sadest is the closing of Bell Labs which failed shortly after </p>
<p>being taken over by Arun Netravalli as president. Bell labs was one of the main </p>
<p>innovation centers which kept America competitive.</p>
<p>Many argue that Americans are dumb and need to be retrained. They use some of the </p>
<p>fee for the visa for training classes. The truth is that no retraining is needed </p>
<p>- American Engineers are the best in the world. It is the Indians that could use </p>
<p>training not the Americans they replace. Worse, the training classes they offer </p>
<p>include such useless things as &#8220;introduction to computing&#8221; and &#8220;basic metal </p>
<p>working&#8221; not real computer training that engineers need.</p>
<p>Its more than time to stop the genocide against american engineers. We must hurry </p>
<p>while there is a industry left to save, or like manufacturing, it too will be </p>
<p>just a memory.  </p>

<p>The point is that race is unavoidable and should not be avoided.<br>
The question is..just how have whites, the most accomplished<br>
race in world history, been bullied and manipulated into apologizing for themselves in knee jerk fashion? Who is behind<br>
this? Who benefits from the fracturing of traditional American<br>
society? Who promotes Multiculturalism?  Who has turned<br>
reality upside down and made the most low IQ, violent, and confused<br>
sections of society empowered with a sense of superiority and <br>

more indebtedness, more and more control? Who? Answer that question first.</p>

Don&rsquo;t you take it awful hard<br>

Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.<br>
Leaving behind nights of terror and fear<br>

Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,<br>
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.<br>

<p>So, those Americans who have their own Plumbing, Carpentry, Cabinet Making, Shoe Making and Repair Shops, Auto Mechanic Shops, and who are licenced Electricians, remember to charge them about five times as much as you would a regular American, because after all, they have all the jobs, and can well afford it.</p>

<p>Your post is highly informative   &mdash;   and reveals not a few scandalous aspects about U.S. work visa policy.  We need to ask ourselves why American companies are so eager to import workers from India via H1-B visas.  Any CEO knows that lower labor costs can&rsquo;t compensate for poor performance, whether at the IT code jockey or executive levels.  Over the long run, it&rsquo;s suicide for the firm.  Something else must be going on here. </p>

<p>As another poster stated, Maya Angelou is in fact an excellent writer with a superb command of the english language. I do not care for her personally, but she a good writer.   </p>

<p>I notice how a number of our posters are comparing Barack Obama with Jimmy Carter.  Sad to say, I disagree. I see more comparisons wtih Ronald Reagan. Reagan had a very poor first two years, but by mid 1983, it semed that everything fell in place for him. By early 1984, the economy was booming and he was re-elected in a landslide.</p>
<p>Actually, I see a similar pattern for Obama. The majority of economists are predicting that by mid summer 2011, the economy will jump start and will be back on track by early 2012. This will be the deciding factor in his reelection. In certian parts of the nations there are already signs of an improved ecoomy.</p>
<p>As far as the American public is concerned, if the economy is strong, unemployment is low and people are back to work, what is happening now will be irrelevant.</p>

		<p>ANYONE who has ever had the &#8220;privelige&#8221; of living in a black-run city, which was Birmingham, AL in my case, realizes unless he or she has only half a brain or is deluded by liberal fantasies, that blacks can&rsquo;t run anything well!  So let the Obamanation continue to stumble and polarize white people:  he&rsquo;s the best racial wakeup call we&rsquo;ve ever had. Of course ideally hw would&rsquo;nt be in office in the first place, but some people have to learn by hard, bitter experience what blacks are truly like.  Birmingham sure knocked the last vestiges of any liberalism I may have had.</p>

		<p>Actaully, Obama&rsquo;s compromise deal with the republicans was pretty beneficial to him and the democratic base. If you read it closely, there are a lot of advantages for people with health issues, student loans, start ups for small businesses etc&hellip; and people who are making under $1,000,000 will have their taxes cut considerably. </p>
<p>Moreover, have any of you noticed how silent the republicans includng Glen Beck, Sarah Palin, the GOP intellegensia have been about this compormise. You have not heard hardly anything. Obama has co-opted them. </p>

<p>If anything, I would argue that Obama having Clinton address reporters at the press conference was a stroke of genius. This was a president who presided over a strong economy, was loved by the elite lamestream media and still has his charisma intact. He would certainly make a convincing case to the media and the public. The GOP does not know quite what to make of this. This fact in and of itself is telling.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, I regret having to say this, but at this point, I see Obama getting re-elected. There is no one out there in the republican party that can beat him at the moment.  </p>

		<p>To #70, I more or less agree with you but my thoughts are as follows.</p>
<p>1, I thought it was pathetic that Obama had to rely on Clinton to prop him up.</p>
<p>2, I did not think Clinton looked his former self, he looked old worn and tired.(My observation only)</p>
<p>3, Who has the other side of politics in the USA got to offer? Sarah Palin, sorry folks but she even make Barry Obama look good.</p>
