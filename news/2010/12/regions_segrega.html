<h1>Region&rsquo;s Segregated Living Cited in New Data</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jay Rey, Buffalo News, December 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Buffalo Niagara region is one of the most racially segregated communities in the United States, according to an analysis of new census data. </p>
<p>The region  &mdash;  comprising Erie and Niagara counties  &mdash;  ranks as the sixth most residentially segregated metropolitan area in the country when it comes to whites and blacks living near each other. </p>
<p>That finding from the Brookings Institution isn&rsquo;t surprising, because the Buffalo area historically has ranked high on similar lists and is not unlike other Rust Belt regions that have been slower to integrate than growing communities in the South and West. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The real key to overcoming those historical patterns of black and white segregation is growing numbers of middle-class blacks migrating into white neighborhoods, Frey said, but Rust Belt regions such as Buffalo simply don&rsquo;t have enough of that. </p>
<p>Metro Milwaukee, for example, ranked as the most segregated region in the country, followed by metro Detroit, New York, Chicago, Cleveland and Buffalo. Metro St. Louis, Youngstown, Ohio, Syracuse and Cincinnati came in just below Buffalo on Frey&rsquo;s index. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Consider the numbers: </p>
<p>* Of the more than 1.1 million people living in Buffalo Niagara, 81 percent are white, and 12 percent are black, according to census estimates released last week. Most of the region&rsquo;s black population lives in the City of Buffalo, where there are almost as many minorities as there are whites. </p>
<p>* The only suburban communities with noticeable minority populations are Cheektowaga, where more than 7 percent of the population is black, and Amherst, where almost 5 percent of the population is black. </p>
<p>White flight and racially based suburban growth are big reasons why the region remains so residentially segregated, said Henry L. Taylor, a professor in the Center for Urban Studies at the University at Buffalo. </p>
<p>&#8220;You have communities that may look like they&rsquo;re integrating today, but they start to transition,&#8221; Taylor said, &#8220;because when there&rsquo;s a certain number of blacks, whites move out.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Integration between whites and asians isn&rsquo;t a problem, because asians aren&rsquo;t violent racists nor perennial hoodlums.   I&rsquo;ve lived in cities that were 60% black, and I now live in a city that is 98.5% white.   The difference in quality of life is literally like night and day.   I no longer have to worry about robbery nor violent crime being a constant hazard in my everyday existence.   My current town has had only one murder in the last two years, and that was a black teenage girl stabbing a white teenage boy.   We had a string of violent rapes perpetrated against white women while their husbands were tied up.  That was a black perp too.  Fortunately, the police executed the lowlife on arrest; so the victims could have real justice.  </p>
<p>Without blacks, my town of 100K would have had no major, violent felonies in five years. </p>

		<p> &#8220;When a certain number of blacks move in, whites move out&#8221;</p>
<p>Absolutely true! Northeastern/upper midwest, suburban/rural whites simply won&rsquo;t tolerate living amongst too many blacks. In actuality it&rsquo;s about ten percent that seems to be the tipping point of concern,- sometimes less.<br>
Call it the 90% rule.</p>
<p>Demographic racial segregation (defacto style), has worked quite well since the rise of suburbia at the end of the second world war. Race and class awareness/division, is now fully embedded in the social, political and economic machinery of the north. Turn that up a notch or two for New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and especially the New England states.</p>
<p>They must be doing something right because we&rsquo;re reading articles like this and it&rsquo;s almost 2011. For those of you who hail from any of these states, my feedback and article only reaffirms what you already know.</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;The Buffalo Niagara region is one of the most racially segregated communities in the United States, according to an analysis of new census data.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>The Buffalo News is constantly deriding the local population for being &#8216;bigots&rsquo; and highlighting their &#8216;racist&rsquo; tendencies.</p>
<p>See previous AR post:</p>
<p><a href="/news/2010/12/does_web_really.html" rel="nofollow">/news/2010/12/does_web_really.php</a></p>
<p>The reports about Buffalo&rsquo;s (or Buffalo-Niagara&rsquo;s) ongoing segregation are a yearly event. In a couple weeks this story will evolve from &#8216;Buffalo-Niagara region is the sixth most racially segregated region&rsquo; to &#8216;Buffalo was rated the most racist city in America&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I can assure you that there are non-government organizations working overtime and in conjunction with local, state, and federal agencies to ensure that Buffalo will integrate regardless of the communities they destroy.<br>

		<p>Several months ago I read a comment on youtube from a guy called Moojeed that was comprised of one simple line that completely and accurately described the past 45 years in U.S. cities: </p>
<p>Integration is the period between the time the first Black family moves into a White neighborhood and the day the last White family moves out.</p>

		<p>White flight is a derogatory term alluding to whites fearful fleeing the cities.  Partially true, but whites left the city for a better life.  Less crime, more control over schools, a sense of community defined by the town.  Note that non-white legal immigrants, primarily Asians and Indians, also move to the suburbs when they can afford to.  And for the same reason, a better quality of life to raise children.  Whites, and all ethnic groups, move when possible if there is a better neighborhood.  One might in turn look at the opposite to white flight to that of black statis.  The white neighborhoods are not walled prohibiting entry.  Blacks are few because ethnic groups feel most comfortable with what is familiar.  That can be seen as color, but it is also behavioral norms.  Most neighborhoods in the US are self-discriminating where folks congregate with like folks.  </p>

		<p>One would think that blacks would understand that we whites are just the same as they are, in that neither of us want to live amongst blacks.</p>

		<p>What is &#8220;white flight&#8221;?   When ethnic groups pursue a policy of invasion and occupation of some place, and drive another ethnic group from that place it is called ethnic cleansing and/or genocide.   Unless the targets of dispossession are white.  <br>
Then it is called &#8220;white flight&#8221;. </p>
<p>The term is meant to confer guilt on the white victims of dispossession, but even that term should wake people up.  The &#8220;fight or flight&#8221; response is a response to a threat.  </p>

		<p>White liberals and their families have a moral obligation to move into Black areas and reverse segregation.</p>
<p>White liberals also have a moral obligation to allow &#8216;racist&rsquo; White-flighters to move away and not be followed by Blacks who might otherwise suffer if too close to these evil racists.</p>
<p>The outcome would benefit everyone; Blacks and White liberals living peacefully and prosperously together, while evil White racists suffer alone without the untold blessings of diversity.</p>

		<p>I lived in Buffalo and can attest to the particularly belligerent demeanor of the black population in the region. Much worse than blacks from the South. It&rsquo;s among the few places in the US where white liberals don&rsquo;t cut the black much slack or make excuses for their bad behavior. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a region with limited economic resources or jobs, so each person&rsquo;s livelihood has been precarious for several decades, and folks make no bones about looking their own self-interest. Whites have a strong ethnic connection to their neighborhood and look out for their own and are wary of outsiders. I doubt there another place in the US where European Americans are as vocally unashamedly white and frank when discussing racial matters.   </p>
<p>Doe&rsquo;s suspect sbuffalonative would agree?       </p>

		<p>I forget where I read it, but a very insightful writer once said, &#8220;A racially mixed neighborhood is merely a chronological term for the period between the arrival of the first black family and the departure of the last white one.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Roy has it right on the mark.<br>
We &#8216;racist&rsquo; whites (i.e. whites who simply want to live with our own kind, as we have done for tens of thousands of years), are apparently &#8216;evil&rsquo;, and are constantly being told that a &#8216;diverse&rsquo; society is BETTER than an all white one. So surely the ultimate &#8216;punishment&rsquo; for all those evil, &#8216;racist&rsquo; whites, is to allow them to have exactly what they want - an all white country to live in. That&rsquo;ll show us!</p>
<p>Funny how the insane Marxists never suggest this as a solution to the problem of so-called &#8216;racism&rsquo; which non-whites apparently endlessly suffer from.</p>
