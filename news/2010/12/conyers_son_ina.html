<h1>Conyers: Son Inappropriately Used SUV</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Leonard N. Fleming, Detroit News, December 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>U.S. Rep. John Conyers, D-Detroit, said his son&rsquo;s use of his congressional vehicle over the Thanksgiving holiday was &#8220;inappropriate&#8221; following reports that the SUV had been broken into and laptops and concert tickets stolen.</p>
<p>Under rules in the House of Representatives, nongovernmental use of a government-paid vehicle is strictly limited  &mdash;  even for members of Congress. The House Ethics Committee could investigate any possible violations  &mdash;  either on its own or if a complaint were made.</p>
<p>The longtime congressman released a statement from Washington after news broke that his son, John Conyers III, filed a police report early Thanksgiving morning that the 2010 Cadillac Escalade had been broken into when it was parked at the corner of Brush and Congress in Detroit.</p>
<p>The vehicle is registered to his father&rsquo;s Detroit office in the federal building downtown and had two Apple laptops and $27,500 worth of concert tickets stolen from it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Conyers, 81, the House Judiciary Committee chairman, did not address why his son was driving the vehicle.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The police report said Conyers III parked the car around 11:30 p.m. and when he returned an hour later, the burgundy SUV had been broken into.</p>
<p>The tickets were intended to be distributed to select retail locations as part of a Black Friday promotion for Detroit rapper Big Sean&rsquo;s concert at the Fillmore on Dec. 26.</p>
<p>Conyers III is affiliated with Big Sean and the promotional group selling the tickets, an executive at the Fillmore confirmed.</p>
<p>When the break-in occurred, Conyers III and Big Sean were attending a performance by Detroit rapper Earlly Mac at the Shelter.</p>
<p>Big Sean expressed concern the tickets, which have been voided, would wind up in the hands of unknowing ticket buyers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The people who they&rsquo;re selling them to might buy them thinking they&rsquo;re real,&#8221; Sean said Tuesday. &#8220;That&rsquo;s my only concern.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s what is most interesting here:  Father Conyers (John Conyers Jr) is 81.  The son described in this article (John Conyers III) is 20.  This means Conyers Jr was 61 when Conyers III came into this world.  Jr.&rsquo;s wife and III&rsquo;s mother, Monica Conyers, now doing time in Federal prison, is 46 herself, meaning that she was 26 when III was born.  Meaning do the obvious math of nine months previous, and you have 60-year old man and 25-year old woman &#8220;together.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Methinks she didn&rsquo;t love a man old enough to be her father here in normalville or her grandfather in ghettoville purely for his person alone   &mdash;   She was probably more in love with his money and power.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m betting the son sold the equipment, etc., and pocketed the money, then made it look like a break-in and theft.</p>
<p>Conyers&rsquo; wife is in prison the last I read for bribery.  This whole family is just another bunch of black criminals. </p>

<p>Sorry Question Diversity, but lots of women have first affairs for love and usually with someone who is uto support them in any reasonable, or civilized fashion. Then, like any female of any species they gravitate more towards who can support them and their offspring,,,,,,just nature doing what it does in nature.</p>

We had a similar incident happen here in Buffalo with our black mayor.</p>
<p>Two winters ago, the mayors reported his SUV was missing. It was quickly located parked near his house. It had been involved in multiple hits of parked cars. A description of a black teen matched that of the mayors son who became the number one person of interest.  </p>
<p>The mayor denied any knowledge of what happened other than he reported his SUV missing and that his son was home and asleep when this happened.</p>
<p>The local college has a parking lot with a surveillance camera. Low and behold, the bumper-car incident was recorded and the mayors son was clearly seen getting out of the SUV and walking in the direction of his house.</p>
<p>A quick press conference was organized and the mayor apologized for any misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Oh, I almost forgot, this summer, our black mayors son was involved in an incident where a friend of his working as a cashier was caught not cashing out his friend, the mayors son.</p>
<p>Some people never learn or simply aren&rsquo;t capable of learning from their mistakes.</p>
<p>Another black teen being funneled into the prison industrial complex by the racist blue eyed devil.<br>

<p>I suspect young Mr. Conyers has a nice little insurance scam going there - sell the tickets and the laptops on the black market (no pun intended) and also get a large settlement check from the insurance company.  After all, even Conyers family members aren&rsquo;t stupid enough to leave 2 laptops on the seat of a fancy SUV at <i>midnight in Detroit</i>!  <br>

<p>Geezus, people, we need a revolution in this country NOW!!!  Millions of Americans are unemployed while Congressmen and Congressowmen drive around in upscale vehicles at OUR EXPENSE!  </p>
<p>They all should be driving 1970&rsquo;s-era Pintos (I, personally, wouldn&rsquo;t have a problem if the only ones available to them were the ones with the fuel-tank problem (wink-wink)).<br>

		<p>I have the same opinion about cars for the high and mighty as I do about airplanes for the rest of us.</p>
<p>Since the USAF cannot, with a 15-20 minute lead, _even get to New York in time to see the second impact_, using a pair of Mach 2 capable F-15s from less than 200 miles away, we should stop with the waste of flying CAPs and maintaining Zulu Alert QRAs and just install cabin video, along with demolition charges, in every airplane.  If someone is seen to have taken over the aircraft.  Boom.</p>
<p>Automatic 3 million dollar payout to the survivors.  I doubt if there would be many complaints.</p>
<p>Same with cars.  You hop into the driver&rsquo;s seat, a weight sensor under the cushion automatically starts a CCD in the rear view mirror and another in the overhead cabin light.</p>
<p>Given most Escalades have Onstar with voice synthesis&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi there, you are being recorded.&#8221;</p>
<p>And junior gets his sorry ass out of dad&rsquo;s ride until he too is old enough to buy his way into a Senate seat.  Or dad loses said status symbol nd junior goes to jail.  Because the Federal Protective Services review every video, in real time, via a contract security service.</p>
<p>Of course, I&rsquo;m also all for upping the salary of the Senate and House to about 4 and 2 million a year, respectively.  We might at least get ourselves a new class of crook that way.</p>
<p>Too many of these &#8216;freshmen&rsquo; Congressional Elects are simply not cut out for the job of leading this nation.  They can barely read.  They have no clue about the flipside of any issue they comment upon and they are _owned_ by people who do both, very well.</p>
<p>If we could exclude all but the Corporate Presidents and Higher Level Legal/Academic/Regional Governance elites (by encouraging them to make idiots out of JQ Average) we would get the kind of Government that this nation deserves.</p>
<p>Right now, this is what our taxdollars buy:</p>
<p>Rank &amp; File (both Houses) $174,000.00/year.<br>
Party Leaders (both Houses) $193,000.00/year.</p>
<p><a href="http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/uscongress/a/congresspay.htm" rel="nofollow">http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/uscongress/a/congresspay.htm</a></p>
<p>I can guarantee you that that is not enough to sustain a homestate existence for your family and a &#8216;deployed&rsquo; condo or house in WDC, for 8 months a year.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder they are so corrupt?</p>
<p>How can we pay celebrities in the millions and _leaders_ in the thousands and not expect to get what we pay for?</p>
