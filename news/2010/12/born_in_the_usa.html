<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>According to the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, anyone born on U.S. soil has the right to U.S. citizenship.</p>
<p>Originally ratified in 1868 to guarantee citizenship rights to freed black slaves, the amendment has been controversial more recently in the American public political debate because of poor, illegal immigrants from Mexico and Central America coming to the U.S. and giving birth. An estimated 340,000 of the 4.3 million babies born in the United States in 2008 were the children of undocumented immigrants, according to an analysis of Census Bureau data by the Pew Hispanic Center.</p>
<p>There is another group of people arriving in the United States to have children. But this group comes legally, often in first-class airline seats: mainland China&rsquo;s upper class.</p>
<p>A whole host of middlemen have sprung up in China to facilitate the booming trade, foremost of whom is Robert Zhou, a Taiwanese businessman.</p>
<p>For roughly $15,000, his company can arrange the hospital in Los Angeles, the doctor, the house and car rental, and any number of other extras for wealthy Chinese parents-to-be.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I&rsquo;m trying to do is to help Chinese mothers to realize their American dream, at a fair and reasonable price. We&rsquo;re not encouraging pregnant women to go and get a U.S. visa. We say that if you already have a U.S. visa, and you&rsquo;re pregnant, you can take the opportunity to give birth in the U.S. So yes, it is a gray area in U.S. law,&#8221; Zhou says.</p>
<p>Anti-immigration activists in the U.S. say the 14th Amendment was never meant to be applied this way. The Department of Homeland Security and the State Department have no specific regulations regarding pregnant foreign visitors like Chen.</p>
<p>Zhou insists his clients obtain U.S. visas themselves before they even approach him. He says they are paying for everything themselves, and not being a burden on U.S. taxpayers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Zhou has helped as many as 600 mothers give birth in the U.S. in the past five years. Some are doing so to skirt China&rsquo;s strict one-child law, which doesn&rsquo;t apply if a child is born to Chinese parents outside China.</p>
<p>When they&rsquo;ve gotten a taste of American life, Zhou says some people do want to emigrate. But the majority of parents, like Chen, don&rsquo;t want to move to America themselves at all.</p>

		<p>According to the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, anyone born on U.S. soil has the right to U.S. citizenship.</p>
<p>Actually, the 14th Amendment says no such thing.  Like a great many decisions made on &#8220;constitutional issues&#8221;, the actual constitutions on both the state and federal levels say nothing even approaching what they have been used as an excuse for.</p>
<p>A glaring weakness in our method of government is no way to confront this.  A court makes a claim about how a law may or may not line up with the constitution.  Almost always, what they determine is a fantasy&hellip;..a complete fabrication that won&rsquo;t hold up against even the most basic analysis.  But since there is no way to challenge it, it stands.</p>
<p>Our enemies have done a fine job of conquering us by simple infiltrating our judiciary&hellip;..then doing whatever they feel like.</p>
<p>Understand something.  The only way to fix it, at this point, is to abandon our current form of government.</p>

		<p>This article says so much about the evils of liberalism and unintended consequences. That is, I&rsquo;m sure a liberal would just brush this aside saying Oh Well stuff like that Happens and then go back on the attack. <br>
The fact is birthright citizenship is a gaping hole waiting to be exploited. Note these are people coming from that Asian Miracle Economy. I hate to be redundant but things are really bad and seem to only be getting worse. Lord knows where we&rsquo;ll be in twenty years, let alone fifty. </p>

		<p>These recurring &#8220;birth tourism&#8221; abuses confirm that that the U. S. government has not the will or desire to protect the interests of American citizens.</p>
<p>Here are a few more to drive home the point:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Korean moms want &#8216;born in USA&rsquo; babies,&rdquo; Los Angeles Times, May 2002: <br>
https://tinyurl.com/365qsg4 </p>
<p>&#8220;SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA: &#8220;In a few weeks, Kim Jeong Yeon will put on her baggiest overalls to disguise her bulging belly and board a flight for Los Angeles. She will spend three months in the United States, staying on a tourist visa, after which she will return to South Korea with a newly minted U.S. citizen in tow&hellip; </p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>&#8220;Birth tourism in US on the rise for Turkish parents,&#8221; HURRIYET (Turkey) DAILY NEWS, March 10, 2010<br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/yc9mdc6" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/yc9mdc6</a> </p>
<p>&#8220;ISTANBUL - With more Turkish parents wanting their child to be born in the US, tourism companies are starting to offer &lsquo;birth tourism&rsquo; packages to US cities. Many women say giving birth in the US has benefits including cheaper education and fewer visa worries&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For many pregnant Chinese, a U.S. passport for baby remains a powerful lure,&rdquo; Washington Post, July 18, 2010: <br>

<p>&#8220;SHANGHAI   &mdash;   What can $1,475 buy you in modern China? Not a Tiffany diamond or a mini-sedan, say Robert Zhou and Daisy Chao.

		<p>Wait right there NPR. The 14th Amendment says that those having<br>
&#8220;legal domicile&#8221; in the United States and &#8220;no allegiance to a foreign nation&#8221; shall be granted citizenship. Indians, for example<br>
were excluded from the 14th Amendment because they had allegiance to Indian &#8220;nations&#8221; that were enclosed on reserved land. <br>
The 14th Amendment DOES NOT give those here illegally or those<br>
who already have allegiance to foreign countries citizenship&hellip;the 14th Amendment SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDES THEM. Every politician and every judge swears a oath to office to Uphold and Defend the Constitution..as it is written. There is NO BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP in the USA..never has been. These people are here illegally and every politician, judge and law enforcement officer is bound by oath to expel them. And further<br>
every independent state is fully entitled to enforce this law independent of what the Federal Government says. The Federal Government was created by the states..not vice versa. All powers<br>
not specifically reserved to the Federal Govt are reserved for the states. The International Borderline itself  shall be defended by the Federal Government..but within the states proper..the Constitution shall<br>
be enforced by the States. Thats why Immigration law enforcement is NOT <br>
reserved to the Feds..but can be enforced by any State law agency&hellip;as is their sworn obligation<br>
Obama..0 pts. Holder 0 pts. Pelosi 0 pts<br>
Madison, Jefferson, Hamilton..1,000,000 pts. <br>
Game Over.</p>

		<p>What would happen if an executive, say a Governor or a future President, says to heck with a judicial ruling because the ruling is wrong?  Can a judge remove a Governor from office for not following his or her ruling?  Since when did judges become monarchs?  When were judges given more power than a monarch?  This is a topsy-turvy world.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait right there NPR. The 14th Amendment says that those having<br>
&ldquo;legal domicile&rdquo; in the United States and &ldquo;no allegiance to a foreign nation&rdquo; shall be granted citizenship.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although those aren&rsquo;t the exact words, that&rsquo;s more or less the idea. However, the first line of the amendment reads:<br>
&#8220;All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which explicitly guarantees birthright citizenship. The &#8220;legal domicile&#8221; and &#8220;no alleigance&#8221; conditions apply to the naturalisation process, not to the concept of being born within the US. So if anything, the &#8220;legal domicile&#8221; part practically forbids amensty does it not? But citizenshop by birth it certainly allows for.<br>
Just stating the facts.</p>
<p>Perhaps there could be an exception to the 14th amendment passed where the children of those on tourist or student visas are not entitled to US citizenship?</p>

		<p>  It amazes me how citizens of other countries take advantage of loop holes in our laws. The United States is Santa Claus to the whole world! The Fourteenth Amendment was meant to give citizenship to former slaves. Previously, the States controlled much of their own immigration. Normally, only whites were allowed citizenship. If anyone born in the United States could become a citizen, than children born to foreign embassy employees would all become citizens?  Native Americans were not citizens under the Fourteenth Amendment, and yet any Pakistani, Nigerian, Honduran or Chinese citizen born in the United States is automatically given citizenship. The majority of the world&rsquo;s nations don&rsquo;t operate in this crazy way  &mdash;   only UNCLE  SAP.</p>

		<p>Second Clause of the 14th Amendment says that the Amendment<br>
pertains to children of parents &#8220;NOT SUBJECT TO ANY FOREIGN POWER&#8221;..ie. holding citizenship elsewhere..Mexico, Honduras,<br>
China etc.<br>
Also the Second Clause of 14th Amendment says parents of <br>
children must ALREADY be &#8220;subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S.&#8221;..ie..not foreigners, not tourists, not citizens<br>
of other countries. </p>
<p>Senator Jacob Howard co author of Amendment made the intent<br>
of the Amendment clear, automatic citizenship would <br>
&#8220;<br>
not include persons born in the U.S. who were foreigners, aliens&#8221;</p>
<p>Ever wonder why the Left never takes this issue to the Supreme<br>
Court while they take EVER OTHER TRIVIAL ISSUE to the Court?<br>

		<p>One has to wonder how much good these Chinese parents are doing their kids in getting them US citizenship.  China and the rest of Asia is advancing so rapidly that this country is now experiencing a sort of reverse brain-drain, as many Asian immigrants recruited by high tech firms in America are leaving to return to their homelands where their knowledge and skills (often acquired in US higher education) are in high demand.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure that they&rsquo;ll be all that easy to replace, given that your average American college graduate most often has an utterly worthless degree in education, the social &#8220;sciences,&#8221; ethnic studies, or communication, whatever the hell that is.</p>

		<p>If you&rsquo;re giving something of value away for free, people will come to take advantage - that&rsquo;s nature.</p>
<p>These same &#8216;newborn Americans&rsquo; will be registered as Korean, Turk, and Chinese nationals when they fly back to their homeland - something their foreign intelligence services will be keenly interested in making use of when they grow older. </p>

<p>&#8220;what part of &ldquo;subject to the jurisdiction thereof&rdquo; don&rsquo;t you understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>Everyone who is within the territories of the United States is subject to the laws of the United States. Jurisdiction refers to the entity which had power over a person at a given time. For example, if I went over to the States I wouldn&rsquo;t be subject to the jurisdiction of Australia, I&rsquo;d be subject to your laws. Hence I would be subject to American jurisdiction and if I were to find a woman of another natonality, the child resulting would be BORN UNDER AMERICAN JURISDICTION, and therefore be an American citizen. You might need to read up on the meaning of the term &#8216;jurisdiction&rsquo;</p>
<p>To Poster 11- Anonymous<br>
The amendment states no such thing:<br>
Secton 1 of the 14th amendment (the section in question)<br>
&#8220;All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. &#8220;<br>
That&rsquo;s word for word. Thw words &#8220;not subject to foreign power&#8221; are absent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever wonder why the Left never takes this issue to the Supreme<br>
Court while they take EVER OTHER TRIVIAL ISSUE to the Court?<br>
Because the Left WILL LOSE.&#8221;</p>
<p>You act as if the left are the only ones with access to your legal system. But as far as I know, everyone can take everything to Court in the States. Feel free to challenge birthright citizenship yourself, although with the reasons I have stated above, there is next to no chance of you winning.</p>

		<p> Hope this clears up your questions. The part&#8221; and subject to the jurisdiction thereof&#8221; is the part that needs clarification. By my understanding, any Government that grants citizenship to people here illegally ( such as Mexico) eliminates the person as having citizenship rights in America by their claim of primary jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. <br>
Section 2. Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.</p>
<p>Section 3. No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may, by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.</p>
<p>Section 4. The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void.</p>
<p>Section 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.<br>
