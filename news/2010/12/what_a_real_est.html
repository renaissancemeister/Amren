			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stacey Bradford, AOL Real Estate, December 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A good real estate agent is very familiar with the neighborhoods where he or she shows properties. But because of legislation called the Fair Housing Act, the agent can&rsquo;t legally share all of that information with you.</p>
<p>{snip} The government wants to make sure that home purchase decisions are based on a property&rsquo;s fair market value and not factors such as race, religion or ethnicity. In other words, the law is meant to stop agents from steering clients toward or away from certain neighborhoods.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>The Do-Not-Ask List</b></p>
<p><b>Household income: </b>Wondering if a neighborhood is considered upscale? Don&rsquo;t bother asking your agent. Klein [Scott Klein, a New York City agent] says he can&rsquo;t discuss economic class with prospective buyers.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s relatively easy to find demographic information online, including average household income for a particular area. {snip}</p>
<p><b>Schools: </b>As with income level, sharing information about schools &#8220;might be perceived as steering someone into a certain neighborhood,&#8221; says Klein. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Religion: </b>The religious makeup of a neighborhood is another topic that&rsquo;s off-limits for real estate agents to discuss. {snip}</p>
<p><br/>
<b>Crime statistics: </b>Surely an agent can answer questions about local crime statistics, right? That&rsquo;s pretty public information. But it turns out that even this data is considered a sensitive topic under the Fair Housing Act.</p>
<p>Once again, buyers have to do their own research to find out if a certain neighborhood is considered safe. {snip}</p>
<p>Klein also recommends that his clients pay a visit to the local police precinct and walk around the neighborhood to get a feel for it at during different times of the day.</p>
<p><b>Environmental concerns: </b>A buyer would want to know if, say, a home is located near a Superfund site. In general, a real estate agent isn&rsquo;t going to be much help when it comes to neighborhood environmental issues. Buyers will need to figure this out on their own. {snip}</p>

		<p>A real-estate agent may not be able to say anything but there&rsquo;s no gag rule on neighbors. I&rsquo;m the first one on my street to tell potential buyers about the history of a home, surrounding homes and neighborhood (I&rsquo;ve been here for 40+ years). I&rsquo;ve even invited a few to come for a ride with me so I can show them where all the recent break-ins and murders have occurred.</p>

		<p>Guess the feds are afraid that white folks might not stick around to pay those absurd property taxes if they knew their new home was in a &#8220;transitional&#8221; neighborhood.  As long as people still have eyes and brains they can see if the area in question is a black hole or not.  Trash strewn about, white female/black male couples and number of mid 90&rsquo;s Buicks are also good indicators of demographics.  </p>

<p>All important questions are from now on not allowed in the land of unlimited opportunities and freedom, just to hide what every bodies already knows.</p>
<p>Do they really think this will help or change anything. No. But at least they have tried no matter when once more the freedom has been destroyed.</p>

		<p>That is simple retarded.  I can kind of understand why they would not allow agents to reveal racial or ethnic data for a neighborhood.  With all the racial equality going around these days, that wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me.  But who thinks its okay to with-hold CRIME data from prospective buyers?!?</p>
<p>Anyone who wants to find out the racial composition of an area (divided into census blocks), should go to: <a href="http://goo.gl/Xy2gy" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/Xy2gy</a></p>

		<p>In our city, the realtors must be breaking the law. Newspaper ads routinely state which schools properties are zoned for, plus realtors do not hesitate to tell potential buyers. We are a majority white town, about 70%, but the schools are 80% minority. However, we have a thriving system of church, parochial, and college prep academies from k through 12. There are at least 5000 enrolled in these schools and most are excellent. </p>

		<p>Save that URL that RFJ101 provided above.  And note that you can break down the census tracts by individual races, (click &#8220;view more maps&#8221;), if you want to see individually where blacks are, where whites are, where Hispanics are, where Asians are.  They don&rsquo;t break down American Indians separately, except in some rural Arizona counties that are majority &#8220;other,&#8221; that means Indian.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot on these maps that don&rsquo;t surprise me, but some things that do.  Most of what surprises me comes from Arizona, surprising based on what I thought I knew from my own first-hand observation.  </p>
<p>The libs said Lou Barletta was lying when he said Hispanic immigration was a big problem in Hazelton, Penn., but the data prove that the various census tracts in the city are between 7% and 40% Hispanic.  </p>

<p>I suppose it&rsquo;s hit and miss with the police.  I&rsquo;ve had success with police departments and one even faxed some information about the area I was checking out to my workplace.  Another time in a different area they were reluctant to tell me anything.  The real estate agents I&rsquo;ve dealt with before generally are skiddish if you ask them about the racial makeup of neighborhoods.  Some are downright deceitful.  Maybe 10 years ago, one agent offered to take me to an area housing a number of townhomes.  I followed him in his car as we weaved through a number of streets to get there.  The homes were new and the neighborhood looked decent but when I left I went in a different direction than the realtor took and I drove right past several rows of delapidated looking public housing full of ethnics not more than a mile away.  <br/>
I disagree with sbuffalonative.  You absolutely have to physically be on location to get a feel for a neighborhood.  Drive through it during different times of the day, not only during the week but on the weekend too.  Look at the age of the vehicles in the driveway, check out the local school and look around.  You&rsquo;ll know instantly the minute you set foot inside.  </p>

		<p>So with all these &#8220;don&rsquo;t&#8221; and &#8220;can&rsquo;t&#8221; exactly what service does the new age real estate agent provide?  How many amp service the home has?  The largest single purchase of one&rsquo;s life, the heart of literally where you live, and where you kids are educated and you can&rsquo;t get relevant information as to the  quality of life.  This will go the way of the N-word, where only blacks have access to it and whites use it at their extreme peril.  Upscale blacks don&rsquo;t want to live in troubled neighborhoods, and neither does any other ethnic group.</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;ve lost freedom of association and now freedom of speach.  If I ask a realtor demographic questions he can not legally answer them?  That is insane.  A good salesman wants to make a sale while spending the least amount of time so that he can move on to the next customer.  What is the point of showing people homes in neighborhoods they don&rsquo;t want to live in?  Our government is truly insane.</p>

		<p>Who needs a real estate agent to tell them if a neighborhood allows blacks to live there?  Just drive around, and if you see any blacks for several miles, don&rsquo;t buy a house anywhere nearby.</p>
<p>When you are scolded for &#8220;refusing your responsibility to help make America a truly inclusive and welcoming of all people and not paying your fair share of the municipal tax burden in black run cities,&#8221; just smile and ask, &#8220;Do you really believe that Rosa Parks was &#8216;only trying to get home&rsquo; when she broke our law on that bus?

		<p>If MOST white people allegedly WANT to live in a &#8216;diverse&rsquo; society, then surely the government (i.e. dictatorship) doesn&rsquo;t need to stop estate agents from telling clients that a neighbourhood is &#8216;diverse&rsquo; (i.e. non-white)?</p>
<p>Quite obviously the government knows that MOST white people want to live in an all white country, and so will avoid houses in &#8216;diverse&rsquo; neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>As proved by the fact that millions of white people move house every year to get away from &#8216;diversity&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Yet the government still have the cheek to tell us that we have &#8216;democracy&rsquo;. We have no such thing.</p>

		<p>Notice the double standard:  When it suits their interests, the government forces the documentation and publication of every minute detail   &mdash;   for example, the ingredients in food.  Look on the back of any package of food, and there is a long list of all the ingredients. </p>
<p>Yet, information that is equally valuable concerning the LARGEST expense of your entire life, and one that will decide your family&rsquo;s economic well being (i.e., rising vs. declining home values) and what type of neighbors, crime, schools, and sociopathic culture that will surround your children   &mdash;   that information must be hidden from you.  </p>
<p>The government is manipulating you for their own evil goals.  America claims to have freedom.  Where is freedom, when you have NO CHOICE as to who you hire, what school your children attend, where you live, how your taxes are spent, etc?  </p>
<p>Now, shut-up and pay your taxes.  The government needs more money for Section 8 housing and importation, settlement, and education of millions of new Third World immigrants, who will &#8220;enrich&#8221; your children.</p>

		<p>I have a simple question.</p>
<p>If &#8220;by law&#8221;, a &#8220;real estate agent&#8221; cannot tell you these things, then why are there huge honking searchable databases run by real estate companies specifically about these things?</p>
<p>I think this article is LYING.  I think that REDLINING&hellip;..attempting to steer specific people away from neighborhoods, might be illegal, depending on the state and municipality but supplying information by which someone might steer themselves, is, of course, OK.</p>
<p>What is going on here is a neo-communist infiltrator (of which there are MANY in the US) is lying to other real estate agents to try and get them to adopt this standard, out of fear.</p>
<p>For the record, here is a copy of the Fair Housing Act:</p>
<p>http://www.justice.gov/crt/housing/fairhousing/about_fairhousingact.htm</p>
<p>I do not notice ANY part that restricts the provision of information.  I also think that a real estate agency is probably not even covered by the act, as sale of individual property is specifically exempted.  In other words, if you sell houses for a living, the Act applies.  If you sell your own house, it does not.  A real estate agent is typically brokering a private sale.  They don&rsquo;t buy your house and then sell it themselves.  The act itself does not apply to them&hellip;.AT ALL.</p>
<p>Note the exception for religion.  The act specifically makes an exception for those who want to ONLY rent to say, Christians.  Of course, most people know the reason for that exemption&hellip;.which religion has created homogeneous ultra-exclusive neighborhoods using public money during the last 50 years.</p>

You&rsquo;re right. There is no substitute for physically being in the neighborhood to give you all the information you need to make an informed decision. It&rsquo;s recommended that you also go on different days at different times.</p>
<p>My point was that the web can help you get started. If things check out online and the area looks safe, you should drive and walk through the community.<br/>

		<p>I came to realize that no subdivision is safe no matter how pricey the home is or the location.  Twenty day laborers crammed into a $400,000 dollar home can easily split the mortgage and Section 8 housing can go up in any area if the right people&rsquo;s hands get greased on the city council.  Neighborhoods can literally change in the blink of an eye.  No, the best solution for us was to move to a rural area and buy a home with lots of acreage around us.  There is absolutely no chance of third world peoples moving next door to us.    </p>

		<p>Well, thirty minutes of feeling my pupils start to cross reading lawyer speak and my brain needs a shower.  But here are the requisite areas that probably apply to Real Estate Agents being constrained from telling the truth when asked (&#8216;fraud by any other name, smells the same&hellip;&rsquo;)-</p>

 <br/>
Sec. 100.135  Unlawful practices in the selling, brokering, or appraising of residential real property.</p>
<p>    (a) It shall be unlawful for any person or other entity whose business includes engaging in the selling, brokering or appraising of residential real property to discriminate against any person in making available such services, or in the performance of such services, because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin.<br/>
    (b) For the purposes of this section, the term appraisal means an estimate or opinion of the value of a specified residential real property made in a business context in connection with the sale, rental, financing or refinancing of a dwelling or in connection with any activity that otherwise affects the availability of a residential real estate-related transaction, whether the appraisal is oral or written, or <br/>
transmitted formally or informally.<br/>

<p>i.e.  If an appraisal falls within a given prospective owner&rsquo;s price range, the agent has to give it full weight in representation for sale -even if- he/she knows that that sale is ultimately against the buyer&rsquo;s racial propinquity wishes.</p>
<p>Countering which, a refusal to tell you about the ethnic or crime related qualities of a given neighborhood can also be taken to mean &#8216;if they tell you, they have to tell everyone&rsquo; and that makes any notion of keeping an area white impossible because, as another poster suggested, blacks and hispanics want to live in safe, high values, white areas too.</p>
<p>So, by saying -nothing-, they put it upon the ethnic buyer to do their own research and thus force everyone on an equal footing in terms of having the assumed inteligence and persistence to do so.</p>
<p>Which isn&rsquo;t all bad, unless you really like the look of your race group around you, period.</p>
<p>And here is the other swing of the shovel-</p>

                 TITLE 24  &mdash;  HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT<br/>
 <br/>
    CHAPTER I  &mdash;  OFFICE OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR EQUAL OPPORTUNITY, <br/>
               DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT<br/>
 <br/>
PART 100_DISCRIMINATORY CONDUCT UNDER THE FAIR HOUSING ACT  &mdash;  Table of Contents<br/>
 <br/>
               Subpart B_Discriminatory Housing Practices<br/>
 <br/>
Sec. 100.70  Other prohibited sale and rental conduct.</p>
<p>    (a) It shall be unlawful, because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin, to restrict or attempt to restrict the choices of a person by word or conduct in connection with seeking, negotiating for, buying or renting a dwelling so as to perpetuate, or tend to perpetuate, segregated housing patterns, or to discourage or obstruct choices in a community, neighborhood or development.<br/>
    (b) It shall be unlawful, because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin, to engage in any conduct relating to the provision of housing or of services and facilities in connection therewith that otherwise makes unavailable or denies dwellings to persons.<br/>
    (c) Prohibited actions under paragraph (a) of this section, which are generally referred to as unlawful steering practices, include, but are not limited to:<br/>
    (1) Discouraging any person from inspecting, purchasing or renting a dwelling because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin, or because of the race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin of persons in a community, neighborhood or development.<br/>
    (2) Discouraging the purchase or rental of a dwelling because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin, by exaggerating drawbacks or failing to inform any person of desirable features of a dwelling or of a community, neighborhood, or development.<br/>
    (3) Communicating to any prospective purchaser that he or she would not be comfortable or compatible with existing residents of a community, neighborhood or development because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin.<br/>

<p>Which is essentially where the specifics of verbal representation of the value of a given home or housing area as being suitable for a person of racial group X becomes explicitly illegal.</p>
<p>There are other subsections (75 and 142) which denote illegal use of selfprinted or caused-to-be-printed documentation, highlighting criminality or ethnic variations.</p>
<p>As well as the more murky uses made of &#8216;types of information&rsquo; including work related papers and projects and &#8216;self tests&rsquo; of what I assume are ethnic ethics to make sure someone is not subliminally exercising some prejudice.</p>
<p>I have seen similar restrictions of &#8216;work product sheets&rsquo; used in the Jewelry Appraisal industry as a means to isolate real appraisative standards behind a wall of proprietary guild secrecy.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that that is where this is ultimately headed and that anti-racial labeling is only an excuse of fear mongered convenience as the definitions as to what types of information are restricted or how they are specifically applied to realtors are not mentioned in the open text.</p>

<p>What is of interest to me is that this archive used to be maintained as part of the National Archives of the Federal Register.</p>
<p>It is now a part of the Department Of Justice.  And we all know who runs that fine agency and it&rsquo;s Civil Rights Division.  Which means that someone is taking a personal interest and may well intend to rewrite the law as they go.
