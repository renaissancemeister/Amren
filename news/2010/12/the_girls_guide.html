<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Pro athletes, beware  &mdash;  groupies have gone online to plot your bankruptcy. Unlike the aspiring mistress of yesteryear, who sharpened her elbows to sidle up to her favorite sportsman in a crowded venue, today&rsquo;s tech-obsessed girls discuss outfits, strategies and even positions before the first encounter even occurs.</p>
<p>Today, players are less likely to meet girls at a strip club or bar than they are on Facebook  &mdash;  as was the case for two women who linked up and went on to bear children with New York Jets father of nine Antonio Cromartie. And beware if you don&rsquo;t come through with the BMW. The groupies are quick to shame, posting pictures of themselves in hotel rooms for wives to find, or revealing intimate details about someone&rsquo;s off-field performance.</p>
<p>&#8216;OFFICIAL Groupie,&#8221; a rosy cheeked Florida-based beauty, coaches inexperienced groupies. First in her playbook: Chase after the dumb jock. &#8220;See, the smarter ones are on to your gold digging groupie a$s. The smart ones can smell your money-hungry a$s a mile away,&#8221; the vixen posted in a three-part series, &#8220;How to Land a Baller.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know the ones that can barely speak well in an interview,&#8221; Official Groupie instructs. &#8220;Yes, b*tch, him! Write his name down. Google him! &#8220;Start to focus on the ones who have criminal records, many baby mommas and plenty of kids, and have &#8216;advisors&rsquo; (i.e. cousins/homeboys that handle their business/money). They&rsquo;ll be easy to recognize cause they always look &#8216;lost&rsquo; and &#8216;slow.&rsquo; He barely makes eye contact. He got a short attention span and easily gets distracted. He gotta think about the words he wanna use before he speaks and still mispronounce the words. He does stupid/dumb s  &mdash;    &mdash;  right in front of you. Yeah, him!&#8221;</p>
<p>On this ever-expanding online manual, girls who want to score with an athlete learn to blend old and new groupie tactics when it comes to bumping into a player. BallerAlert&rsquo;s &#8220;Eleven8,&#8221; for example, suggests memorizing the layout of the W Hotel in Hollywood, where, she said, the NBA stars will rest their heads during February&rsquo;s All Star Weekend in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Then modern girls equipped with a smartphone can take advantage of Eleven8′s &#8220;Twitter-holic Trick.&#8221; &#8220;As proven by Carmelo Anthony and countless others, most ballers control their own Twitter accounts. Know their away schedules! When they&rsquo;re going to be in LA this is the perfect time to turn on your cyber charm and tweet your favorite baller until he takes notice,&#8221; she writes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most ballers usually follow groupies [on Twitter] right before they hit the city this way they can keep the conversation isolated. Once he&rsquo;s in your [private] box you can get the digits and the hotel room number.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Dwayne Bowe dubbed this type of pre-arranged rendezvous &#8220;importing,&#8221; telling ESPN magazine in May that senior players compiled a starting lineup of groupies drafted from Facebook and Twitter before away games and flew the women out to the team&rsquo;s hotels.</p>
<p>Time and time again, the public&rsquo;s prying eyes discover stars&rsquo; exploits on social network sites. Bloggers at TheDirty.com make a sport of outing groupies. Last month they posted a screenshot of a Facebook page where two women boasted about an evening with Philadelphia Eagle Michael Vick.</p>
<p>&#8220;Swimming with Michael Vick and cuziie !!!,&#8221; exclaimed a woman named &#8220;Julia&rsquo;s Status.&#8221; &#8220;What a night/morning with him bahahahah. wait I just woke up next to Michael Vick,&#8221; her friend Lana writes. The BallerAlert chicks also giggled when a woman named Tia dumped NFL star James Davis via her Facebook page in June.</p>
<p>&#8220;3 kids 3 baby mamas 6th round pick wat the f  &mdash;  k was I thinking. relationships r Def not ur strong point .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. hope u excel in FB its the only thing ur good at. someone please give James Davis the memo .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. his relationship is over,&#8221; the angry girlfriend wrote.<br>

		<p>This is what it means to be an alpha male because this is what white men choose to be their leaders, those they admire, even worship.</p>
<p>Any time YOU spend even a single dime on something like sports.  If you even watch, YOU are declaring loud and clear that this is what the ultimate in life is.  What you aspire to be.  More to the point, what you submit to.</p>
<p>YOU are a slave&hellip;..by choice.  How do you like the face of your master?</p>
<p>Better wake up.</p>

		<p>The athletes should find time in their busy schedules to learn some self-respect. Shouldn&rsquo;t they date a woman who&rsquo;s hot and makes some money of her own?</p>

		<p>Far more contemptible than the black athletes who fall for these white women are the women themselves.  A more mendacious bunch of scheming, blackmailing harpies I&rsquo;ve yet to read about.  And people wonder why we white men wait longer before marrying nowadays.    </p>

		<p>This is just one more example of how sick our society has become. About ten years ago I was in NYC during the NBA All Star Game Festivity to see a concert ( a white oriented concert wherein Phil Jackson was in attendance). Next door was a club with a more Afro clientele and the hot Groupies-really good looking white women, were on the hunt. We really have to turn away from mindless sports. I know it will be hard for many whites, on Sunday I saw many white folks bedecked in their favorite teams colors but we really need to look at the big picture. </p>

<p>If I wrote about these observations, I&rsquo;d be condemned as a racist for foster stereotypes.</p>
<p>As I always say, blacks ARE stereotypes and they know it.<br>

		<p>Um if you are say a ghetto black female who is destined to be knocked up by various anonymous men who won&rsquo;t ever see  &mdash;  much less raise their children  &mdash;  you might you might as well shoot for the stars and try to make a few hundred thousand dollars in child support payments by landing yourself a pro athlete. Even if you sleep with a &#8220;baller&#8221; and don&rsquo;t get knocked up you can probably get impregnated by some other lowlife and blame it on the baller and see if he shows up in court to contest paternity.</p>

		<p>Given that is there a whole corps of white women running after these black athletes, it&rsquo;s surprising that so few NBA stars marry white women.  </p>

		<p>Meanwhile white men continue to support the NBA and NFL and paid the salaries of these athletes.</p>
<p>White people could stop stop the worship of black athletes in a minute if they wanted to.</p>
<p>Just ignore those sports the way black people ignore hockey.</p>
