<h1>In Congress, a Harder Line on Illegal Immigrants</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Suzanne Gamboa, San Francisco Chronicle, December 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a matter of weeks, Congress will go from trying to help young, illegal immigrants become legal to debating whether children born to parents who are in the country illegally should continue to enjoy automatic U.S. citizenship.</p>
<p>Such a hardened approach  &mdash;  and the rhetoric certain to accompany it  &mdash;  should resonate with the GOP faithful who helped swing the House in Republicans&rsquo; favor. But it also could further hurt the GOP in its endeavor to grab a large enough share of the growing Latino vote to win the White House and the Senate majority in 2012.</p>
<p>Legislation to test interpretations of the 14th Amendment as granting citizenship to children of illegal immigrants will emerge early next session. That is likely to be followed by attempts to force employers to use a still-developing web system, dubbed E-Verify, to check that all of their employees are in the U.S. legally.</p>
<p>There could be proposed curbs on federal spending in cities that don&rsquo;t do enough to identify people who are in the country illegally and attempts to reduce the numbers of legal immigrants. {snip}</p>
<p>House Republicans will try to fill the immigration reform vacuum left by Democrats with legislation designed to send illegal immigrants packing and deter others from trying to come to the U.S.</p>
<p>Democrats, who will still control the Senate, will be playing defense against harsh immigration enforcement measures, mindful of their need to keep on good footing with Hispanic voters. But a slimmer majority and an eye on 2012 may prevent Senate Democrats from bringing to the floor any sweeping immigration bill, or even a limited one that hints at providing legal status to people in the country illegally.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Obama also has made cracking down on employers a key part of his administration&rsquo;s immigration enforcement tactics.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>John Morton, who oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said in a recent conference call that there are no plans to change the agency&rsquo;s enforcement tactics, which are focused on immigrants who commit crimes but also have led to detaining and deporting many immigrants who have not committed crimes.</p>
<p>The agency also will continue to expand Secure Communities, the program that allows immigration officials to check fingerprints of all people booked into jail to see if they are in the country illegally. Both illegal immigrants and residents can end up being deported under the program, which the Homeland Security Department hopes to expand nationwide by 2013.</p>

		<p>I heard Lou Dobbs today say only a few, unrealistic people want the 14th amendment changed. I think he&rsquo;s very wrong on that. I think most of us would like to see the administration stop handing out our most precious birthright to anyone who can step over the border, charge the American taxpayer for the birth, then get rewarded with citizenship. Illegal aliens are NOT &#8220;under the jurisdiction of the US,&#8221; so I&rsquo;ve never known how they could become citizens anyway.</p>

		<p>And Ms. Gamboa says it like its a bad thing.  This debate has become stale.  Both sides have been dug in for so long that their will not be a false victory using hollow legislation.  Americans want results and they have waited for 25 years.  The only thing that has changed is the technology.  </p>
<p>It is now past arguing whether or not enforcement will work.  Both E-Verify and expanded 287 g will work and everybody knows it, especially the La Raza crowd.  Worse, the side that has been claiming that it could not work is going to be humiliated.  Not only are they going to have to watch their ethnic advocacy go up in smoke but they will be exposed for the liars and traitors that we all know they are.  </p>
<p>I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!  </p>

		<p>John Morton seems to not understand the meaning of committing a crime, in saying it has led to deporting some who haven&rsquo;t committed a crime, since if those deported are ilegals they have certainly committed a crime worthy of being deported. Plus AmeriKa is the last and only country in the world that allows anchor babies, in fact none ever allowed ilegal anchor babies. We should model our imigration policies after our &#8220;neighbor&#8221; [I use the term loosley] to the south, in reference to the handling of ilegals.</p>

		<p>To say that I&rsquo;m skeptical of all this supposedly hardline posturing on illegal aliens is, of course, an understatement. Even some quarters of our movement seem seduced by all this grand talk of Republican toughness, etc. Again, as cliched as it sounds, I will believe it only when I truly see it. The DREAM collapse was a good start though!</p>

		<p>The Tea Party whiteys will sell us out to their paymasters just as fast at the Reagan/Bush Republicans did.   Unless they use their platform to tell the truth about the coming hyper-inflation and destruction of all we&rsquo;ve worked to create in this White Republic, and that each state should seriously start considering secession from the Union through repealing their ratifications of the Constitution, then you will know that they are back to business as usual. </p>

		<p>Take heart  &mdash;  the illegal immigration enthusiast San Francisco Chronicle is getting clobbered in circulation, as people get disgusted and stop reading it.  In spring 2010[1] it had the largest drop of the top 25 papers (22%), and in fall[2] the 2nd largest drop (11%).  The paper is slowly but surely losing its economy of scale and may end up collapsing if we&rsquo;re lucky.</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;ll see how hard Obama or the Tea Party Reps crack down on employers who hire illegals. Campaign contributions count for more than patriotism.</p>
<p>As for the anchor babies, they can happily go to school, steal scholarships and jobs from native Americans secure in the knowledge that neither the President nor the Congress will recognize their obvious illegal residence. After all, they were brought here by their parents; it&rsquo;s not their fault. Nothing is anyone&rsquo;s fault in our enlightened society.</p>

<p><i> But it also could further hurt the GOP in its endeavor to grab a large enough share of the growing Latino vote to win the White House and the Senate majority in 2012.</i></p>
<p><br>
Yeah, like I&rsquo;m so sure the SF Chronicle is worried that the GOP might not snare enough of the latino vote when it comes time to re-elect The Mulatto Messiah. In an Internet forum, this brand of smiley-faced subterfuge is called &#8220;concern trolling&#8221;: a passive-aggressive trope that pretends to help the troll&rsquo;s enemy, but which actually intends to lead the enemy into dangerous territory or otherwise be injurious. </p>
<p>Such chicanery is, of course, politics-as-usual amongst traditional adversaries such as a left-wing newspaper and immigration patriots. So I don&rsquo;t mind the Chronicle giving it a go. But the disturbing part of all this is that the clueless country-club elites of the GOP also believe in the importance of hispandering   &mdash;   despite decades&rsquo; worth of data demonstrating that trying to convince the average mestizo of the advantages of such Republican ideals as free-enterprise system, self-reliance, property rights, and individual responsibility, is a total waste of time. </p>

		<p>Generally speaking, I think we should quit using the term illegal immigrants.  They are not immigrants of any kind.  Instead let us start to call them an invasive colonizing force of Mexican nationals.</p>

		<p>Either we draw a line in the sand right now, or we capitulate to the illegals for good.  If the GOP is worried about the Hispanic vote, what will the situation be when the country is overrun with matured anchor babies?  Either the Repubs establish that they represent law-abiding white Americans, or some other party will take their place.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a hard choice.  Either cater to the very whites that got you in power and ignore what the Left and their agitators say OR; two, cater to people who have no right to be here, who hate the US, who hate the people who created the benefits which attracted them to come here, and further aid in the demise of Western Civilization. </p>

Translation: the Republicans will talk a lot about cracking down on illegal immigrants in order to give their credulous &#8220;faithful&#8221; the illusion that they&rsquo;re actually doing something, but in the real world, the GOP will continue to pander to the La Raza crowd in the truly dumb belief that Mestizos are going to vote for them in any large numbers. </p>

		<p>I am third generation born in the US. My fathers family came to America for the &#8220;American Dream&#8221;. But they came here LEGALLY and once here they learned English, started businesses, paid taxes and obeyed the laws. This is what America is founded on; hard working law abiding people, not someone who sneaks into OUR country and expects everything for free. The Hispanics groups do not want to co-exist with Americans, they want retake America without ever fire one shot. It&rsquo;s time everyone stood up and became counted.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;ve never seen brought out. Aren&rsquo;t Mexican illegal aliens subject to the jurisdiction of Mexico? The Mexican government certainly treats them as if they do, with their consular services and even making sure they vote in Mexican elections. And the same goes true for illegals from El Salvador, Guatemala, Dominican Republic, China, etc.</p>

		<p>Anchor babies aren&rsquo;t subject to the jurisdiction of the USA in the sense that their parent&rsquo;s residence is &#8216;temporary&rsquo;, i.e., non-existent.  For example, a tourist who has a baby while visting the US did not birth a US citizen. So how can someone who doesn&rsquo;t have a valid visa like a tourist claim their kid is a citizen?  </p>
<p>On the other hand, if Illegal Dad or illegal baby when a bit older commit a crime, we can arrest them. We couldn&rsquo;t make the arrest if there wasn&rsquo;t &#8220;jurisdiction&#8221;. </p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not an easy legal question. From a policy perspective however, it is easy: spawn offspring here after you sneak in, why should you or the kid take the benefits that are available to US citizens? But you&rsquo;ll have to change the US constitution to make these now-legals illegal. A hopeless task given the influence of Blacks and Hispanics in enough legislatures to make the three-quarter of states necessary ratification of an Amendment. </p>
<p>Fight these people with employment checks and with cut-off of every benefit possible. No scholarships, no affirmative action preferences, no health care benefits (including the emergency room). This is war. Dead bodies are common in war.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d also like to know what is/was the  ulterior motive of the Sulzbergers. That would be most interesting. They have owned this newspaper (and its prestigious associated publications) for over a century, a fact which has given them immense power in American and international politics, and in shaping world opinion.  Why would they now be willing to share this awesome  clout with someone else   &mdash;   a foreigner at that?  Do they forsee the demise of printed newspapers? Do they have other prospects, other irons in the fire?  As always, there is more here than meets the eye. </p>
<p>No doubt Señor Slim is a wily old fox, but the Sulzbergers are surely no fools either.  Neither got where they are by being naive or stupid.  So who&rsquo;s taking advantage of whom?  What is the interest of each?</p>

		<p>One point I don&rsquo;t hear mentioned enough is the fact that Mexico, in the late 1990&rsquo;s passed a law that allows dual citizenship for &#8220;immigrants&#8221; to the US. Basically Mexico is allowing these illegals to keep their Mexican citizenship in addition to any US citizenship they may obtain. Mexico for the last couple decades has been fighting a war against us, and we sit around and allow them to cross the border and breed. I see it every day; Mexican citizens crossing the street with three or four dirty little Mexican babies&hellip; mom&rsquo;s meal ticket.</p>
<p>The reality is that all these Mexicans who are demanding US citizenship are ALREADY Mexican citizens, even if they were born here as anchor babies&hellip; and even with US citizenship, they still will be Mexican citizens. </p>
<p>Where you have Mexicans you have Mexico.</p>

<p>Well, it may &#8220;exist&#8221;, but it&rsquo;s unofficial. If they are here illegally, then it follows that they can have no legal residence or address in the USA. </p>
<p>Indeed, to be logical, if they are here illegally, then they have no legal rights or entitlement to anything else. Nothing but arrest and deportation &hellip; just like an uninvited intruder in your home. </p>
<p><i>&#8220;For example, a tourist who has a baby while visting the US did not birth a US citizen.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Ah, but  so-called &#8220;tourists&#8221; do come here all the time to give birth on US soil. There is, in fact, quite an industry in this, catering to the wealthy from Asia, Latin America, the Arab world.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;So how can someone who doesn&rsquo;t have a valid visa like a tourist claim their kid is a citizen?&#8221;</i> </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not logical, but the answer is simple:  Because the US government ALLOWS it. </p>
<p><i>&#8220;it&rsquo;s not an easy legal question. But you&rsquo;ll have to change the US constitution to make these now-legals illegal.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t easy, nor pleasant, but it will have to be faced. And the sooner the better.  Delay is in their favor as their numbers continually mushroom.  As for changing the constitution, I don&rsquo;t know. Some say it will take just a clarification of what&rsquo;s already there.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;we can arrest them. We couldn&rsquo;t make the arrest if there weren&rsquo;t &ldquo;jurisdiction&rdquo;. </i></p>
<p>Exactly. If they had diplomatic immunity, we could not arrest them. So obviously they do NOT have diplomatic immunity.</p>
<p>These laws were formulated at a time when world travel was  much rarer and generally restricted to the few and the rich. And when you could not get on a plane and be on the other side of the earth within 24 hours. Nor was such travel within the means of an African tribesman or a Hindu peasant. Now, all of that has changed.  But our laws have not changed to keep pace.</p>
<p>This does not have to be so. Other countries do not allow such abuse. In Europe, the child takes the nationality of the parents, not the place of birth. Being born in Belgium does not make you Belgian any more than being born in China makes you Chinese.  But America was eager for immigrants   &mdash;   once upon a time.  That time is long past. We don&rsquo;t need them now.  Here is the French position.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;French nationality law is historically based on the principles of <i>&#8216;jus soli&rsquo;,</i> according to Ernest Renan&rsquo;s definition, [as diametrically opposed to] the German definition of nationality [by ethnicity/descent] expounded by the German philosopher Fichte. <br>
    <br>
The 1993 reform (Méhaignerie Act) required children born in France to foreign parents to request French nationality at adulthood, rather than automatically being accorded French citizenship. This &#8220;manifestation of will&#8221; requirement was subsequently abrogated by the Guigou Law of 1998; but children born in France to foreign parents remain foreign until reaching legal majority.&#8221;</i><br>

<p><br>
Indeed this is war!  It&rsquo;s demographic warfare that&rsquo;s being waged against us   &mdash;   a new type of warfare;  something that most Americans (and certainly not our politicians) do not realize or take seriously. </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s worse, much of our government, academia, press, and major institutions - all trying to be trendy -  seem to be lined up on the other side. They blindly  adulate &#8220;change&#8221; for change&rsquo;s sake. Change is supposed to be an automatically good thing. It&rsquo;s never explained why. Like a Divine Mystery, it&rsquo;s just a given. You don&rsquo;t question it.</p>
<p>Those of us whose eyes are open and recognize this war for what it is, are reviled as bigots, xenophobes, rednecks, and angry old geezers who just cannot &#8220;adjust&#8221; to change.  But if that change is not in our people&rsquo;s  interest, why should we adjust?</p>

<p>Well! shots ARE going to be fired when the mexicans confront the muslims as they begin fighting in earnest over the carcass of a once great nation. Whites should make no mistake, there will be no safe homeland in the NorthWest, only perhaps a temporary respite and perhaps not even that, as the black Somali muslims are apparently quite at home in the cold, at least as long as the free housing, food and transport are provided.</p>

		<p>In Kuwait and Saudi that I know of, if a foreign worker is pregnant, she is deported shortly before the birth as those countries do not allow foreign babies to be born on their soil. A good idea from a muslim country for a change. Some American births are allowed because they need us, but they ARE NOT CITIZENS of those countries.</p>

		<p><b>&ldquo;The Hispanic groups do not want to co-exist with Americans, they want retake America without ever firing one shot&rdquo;</b></p>
<p>And so far they are accomplishing EXACTLY THAT,  with the connivance of our traitorous politicians and businessmen and foundations, and with the full sympathy of our hand-wringing churches and universities.  </p>
<p><b>Well!  shots ARE going to be fired when the mexicans confront the muslims as they begin fighting in earnest over the carcass of a once great nation. </b></p>
<p>Depending on what is left, there may not be much worth fighting over.  But I can foresee the possibility of the Hispanics and Moslems forming an alliance   &mdash;   with the Moslems eventually prevailing. Moslems will not yield, but Mexicans (only superficially Christian anyway) will become Islamized.  After all, their societies and attitudes are basically very similar, with common roots in their Arabic past. For Hispanics, it would just be returning to their roots, turning the clock back a thousand years.</p>
<p><b>Whites should make no mistake, there will be no safe homeland in the NorthWest, only perhaps a temporary respite and perhaps not even that.&#8221; </b> </p>
<p>Absolutely. That fantasy is no more than an unrealistic daydream. It&rsquo;s a distraction away from the real problems that face us.</p>
<p><b>the black Somali muslims are apparently quite at home in the cold, at least as long as the free housing, food and transport are provided.</b></p>
<p>Well, as long as they don&rsquo;t have to go outside, and the welfare checks keep arriving, the cold isn&rsquo;t so bad or even noticeable. And it&rsquo;s only a few months anyway. </p>
<p>But, when I was at the AR conference last February, when Washington had just had a big blizzard, the hotel van driver (an American) said that the other drivers (Somalis and Moroccans) absolutely REFUSED to drive or work  in the snow. They weren&rsquo;t fired either; nothing happened to them. They just didn&rsquo;t come to work when there was snow.   (It&rsquo;s their &#8220;culture&#8221;, you know. Can&rsquo;t fire them for that!)<br>
 <br>
<b>&#8220;In Kuwait and Saudi that I know of, if a foreign worker is pregnant, she is deported shortly before the birth&hellip;A good idea from a muslim country for a change.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>Yes, there&rsquo;s an idea  that we can learn from them. They are more determined to hang onto their countries than we are.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they want to let you to die there either,  although they can&rsquo;t  always prevent it.  At least they don&rsquo;t permit non-Moslems to be buried there - (and defile their sacred soil!).   If you die in Saudi, the religious authorities take charge of shipping your body out   &mdash;   and  they charge an enormous fee (which cannot be contested)   &mdash;   something like $50,000. The price varies according to what country you&rsquo;re from. Rich countries get charged more.</p>
<p>Yes, in some ways they are smarter than we are. They must think we are saps, to  let ourselves be taken advantage of so easily.<br>
