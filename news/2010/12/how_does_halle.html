<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Halle Berry {snip} may have tackled her most challenging role to date: a woman suffering with multiple personality disorder in the psychological drama &#8220;Frankie &amp; Alice.&#8221;</p>
<p>The movie is based on a true story of a black woman who struggles to retain her true self and not give in to her &#8220;white racist&#8221; alter personality.</p>
<p>&#8220;A black woman who splits off into a white racist, right there that&rsquo;s got to be a story worth telling,&#8221; Berry told Pop Tarts at the film&rsquo;s Hollywood premiere on Tuesday night. &#8220;I really wanted to understand how that could happen, why that would happen and I wanted to see her journey of how she healed herself because our character actually triumphs.&#8221;</p>

		<p>If she gets healed from that it must be due to anti-psychotic drugs manufactured by the white man? Hope she doesn&rsquo;t read that, may lead to a relapse. </p>

		<p>Well I guess so. We have already had<br>
a white man, Bill Clinton,  whose inner personality was Jesse Jackson. And we have had a half black man whose<br>
inner personality was a mix of Leon Trotsky and Louis Farrakhan<br>
with traces of a lost demonic spirit named Barry Soetoro. And we have had a white woman Hillary whose inner personality was <br>
Lizzie Borden, and a white man Harry Reid whose inner personality was a doorknob, so I guess this is the next progressive step forward. </p>

<p>Based on a true story. Notice there&rsquo;s no information on this true story. One has to wonder how much leeway they took in presenting this true story. My guess is that whatever true story it&rsquo;s based on, we&rsquo;ll likely never get the unadulterated true story. </p>
<p><i>&#8220;We should talk about it, I hope this movie incites people to talk about the issue,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I see homeless people on the street and I think people think they&rsquo;re just derelicts or drug addicts, but many of them really suffer with real mental issues.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>The real story they want to tell is that racism is a mental issue.<br>

<p>Just a bit off the subject. This new movie, &#8220;Unstoppable&#8221; is based on the exploits of a White man. Denzel Washington is playing the White man in the movie. </p>
<p>It is interesting that the overwhelming majority daredevil stuff in this world is done by White men.</p>

		<p>Ms. Berry is a very attractive woman precisely because she practically could pass as &#8220;white&#8221;. She could claim she was part-Latino, Mediterranean or even Sephardic Jewish heritage, and be believed. She speaks with just a hint of a southern accent, with excellent diction.  No doubt she has had her &#8220;white&#8221; days when she wished she could &#8220;be&#8221; Caucasian and be done with it.  She complicates her own life by participation in NAACP and BET-type events. Intelligent people with African American Ancestry, particularly if they have significant European, Arab, Asian, or Jewish ancestry, have to ask themselves what possible advantage to themselves or their children they can possess from African-American identification and socialization. </p>
<p>Obama is another mixed-ancestry person who had no good reason to identify with US blacks whatsoever.  His mother&rsquo;s Marxist-originated hate of US and capitalist society explains for me his choice of African identity more than his skin complexion.</p>

		<p>Sounds like that tv show &#8216;The United States of Tara&rsquo; but with a racial guilt-trip for whites, The comparison implying that being insane (along with having an openly gay teenage son &amp; a &#8216;tolerant&rsquo; feminized husband) is cool &amp; hip if you are White but something to be overcome if you are Black. PS Halle is biracial, raised by a White mom, never seen her Black dad, married to a White &amp; has mostly dated Whites and yet is staunchly Afrophilic.</p>

		<p>Sounds like a movie neither blacks NOR whites will go to see.  Also sounds more about her conflict within herself, her being a black who looks white.  Thing is, we just don&rsquo;t care about her conflict, or the premise of the movie.  There&rsquo;d be no such inner conflict if race would breed within race.  What&rsquo;s most galling, I guess, is that she is only successful because she looks more white than black, yet she is thrilled to play a part that wants to kill the white feelings inside the black character.  Or maybe that&rsquo;s not so surprising.  Blacks cannot survive on their own, and feed off white achievement, yet want desperately to eliminate whites and spend a lot of time killing them merely because they are white.  Why don&rsquo;t we see a movie &#8220;investigating&#8221; THAT &#8220;inner conflict&#8221; of blacks hating the hand that feeds them and saves them from themselves?</p>

		<p>How about a movie based on a white woman who has the split personality of a black racist? I&rsquo;m sure the NAACP, SPLC, Jesse Jackson and the other leaders of the good ol&rsquo;  USA would be open to such a concept.</p>

		<p>Any story that claims to be built around the idea of &#8220;multiple personality disorder&#8221; is not based on a true story. Multiple personality disorder, also known as Dissociative Identity Disorder, is a highly controversial condition which most psychologist dont even believe is real.</p>
<p>this is from wikipedia:</p>
<p>&#8220;The highly influential book Sybil was published in 1974, which popularized the diagnosis through a detailed discussion of the problems and treatment of the pseudonymous Sybil. Six years later, the diagnosis of multiple personality disorder appeared in the DSM III&hellip; As media coverage spiked, diagnoses climbed. There were 200 reported cases of DID as of 1980, and 20,000 from 1980 to 1990. Joan Acocella reports that 40,000 cases were diagnosed from 1985 to 1995. The majority of diagnoses are made in North America, particularly the United States, and in English-speaking countries more generally with reports recently emerging from other countries.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Early in her career, Ms. Berry had rhinoplasty (nose job) to make her appear less African.  She was beautful before, but now she&rsquo;s beautful &amp; more white-looking.  Nobody will call her on that, but I find it interesting. If only there were some way to make celebrities tell the truth. </p>

		<p>First of all she&rsquo;s miscast for this role: there is no way anyone could perceive her as anything else but a (not particularly high toned) mullatress. She has bad hair and is too dark too pass for Cherokee or southern European.<br>
  At any rate, whatever pride of possession she has for her African heritage, she chose to diminish or dilute by marrying a very White man. So perhaps the child of this union could someday play the part of the conflicted &#8220;supremacist.&#8221;</p>

		<p><i>A black woman who splits off into a white racist, right there that&rsquo;s got to be a story worth telling</i></p>
<p>Would you be willing to tell the story of your <b>White</b> mother who was beaten and abandoned by your <b>black father, leaving your White mother to raise you alone?</b></p>
<p>Right there, that&rsquo;s got to be a story worth telling.</p>
<p>And from JustSaying:</p>
<p><i>Early in her career, Ms. Berry had rhinoplasty.</i></p>
<p>Here is a before and after picture from AwfulPlasticSurgery.com:</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/29qb6ja</p>
<p>She wouldn&rsquo;t be trying to make herself look more White would she?  </p>
<p>I wonder why she switched to White Men after burning through two marriages to black men?  And then there&rsquo;s this:  <i>In the early 1990s she lost 80% of her hearing in one ear after being beaten by a former boyfriend. Halle has not revealed the identity of who beat her.</i> </p>
<p>She would have identified the assailant if he were White.</p>
<p>And did she also not receive preferential treatment for a few traffic accidents?</p>
<p><i>Berry was involved in a February 2000 traffic collision, in which she suffered a concussion and left the scene of the accident before the police arrived&hellip; she had also been the driver in an alleged hit and run incident three years earlier in which no charges were filed.</i></p>
<p>Tell everyone you know not to waste money on any movie with this racist, hypocrite and fraud in it.</p>

		<p>All celebrities, especially all Hollyweird actors, are vectors for Universalist-Marxist propoganda. I haven&rsquo;t set foot in a movie theater in 33 years. There are so few worthwile films that I have never seen the point in doing so. There have been a few indie films that I have enjoyed in recent years (at home), but the Indie crowd makes the Hollyweird crowd come off like John Birchers by comparison, so&hellip;</p>
<p>   BTW..that last film I saw was &#8220;The Spy Who Loved Me&#8221;. Not a bad romp, even with starchy Roger Moore as Mr. Bond. The title song of course is a glorious bit of music-making, even if it&rsquo;s from the usual (liberal) suspects. </p>

		<p> Holly Barry appears to flunk the old Creole paper bag comparison. Anyone darker than a common shopping paper bag is black. Her hair is also not &#8220;good&#8221; but processed. Lastly, as Bon points out, she has had rhinoplasty. She&rsquo;s been made to appear lighter in photographs and some movies. I also agree with Bon: why not a story about her deadbeat black father and abusive ex-boyfriends? At least that would be drawn from life, not from a supposedly true story.</p>

<p>Maybe these &#8220;young White teenagers&#8221; should be forced to go to the websites that graphically describe the horrors suffered by the five young White people in Wichita and the Columbia Student in her apartment, Eve Carson and Channon and Christoper in Knoxville. <br>

		<p>To Bon (re post # 16):</p>
<p>I never liked Halle Berry, so of course, I&rsquo;m not going to see this movie. I&rsquo;m glad her &#8216;Catwoman&#8221; movie of a few years back, bombed. They also tried to turn her &#8220;Jinx&#8221; character (from the Bond movie &#8220;Die Another Day&#8221;), into a separate franchise (like &#8216;Lara Croft&#8221;), but that fizzled. She won an Oscar, but that&rsquo;s not necessarily a passkey to cinema immortality.</p>
<p>She can&rsquo;t say that Hollywood&rsquo;s not trying to turn her into some screen vamp, though. Audiences just aren&rsquo;t buying it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The movie is based on a true story of a black woman who struggles to retain her true self and not give in to her &ldquo;white racist&rdquo; alter personality.&#8221;</p>
<p>First of all, Halle Berry is NOT a &#8220;black woman.&#8221;  She&rsquo;s a mulatto, and unlike Obama she looks like a white with a tan more than anything else.</p>
<p>Secondly, without watching the movie, but knowing that the dregs of Hollywood have some screwy agenda where they think they&rsquo;re doing brilliant work by depicting a situation where they are influencing public thought to promote their view of a multiracial utopia, but are so transparent they fool only the fools like themselves, I can say that the movie is just one more worthless attempt to brainwash rather than entertain.</p>
<p>Hollywood wins over only the gullible and the morons who slap their meat hooks together whenever they hear the likes of Letterman or Jon Stewart say something that&rsquo;s about as funny as lung cancer, but they applaud just the same, because they feel as if they are showing they&rsquo;re enlightened if they do so. </p>
<p>Hollyweird has lost its uselfulness to entertain the masses.  Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a shame if their financial support were compromised at every turn?</p>

		<p>Halle Berry&rsquo;s mother is white and her black father also had a white mother. That makes Halle 75% white and possibly more if further back in her black lineage there was also a mix of white blood. In large parts of the Caribbean Islands and Brazil, Halle would be considered white. Yet, she clings to a black identity, so that she can claim the ever coveted victim status.</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t is unusual or maybe interesting that even though she was married to two different black men, the father of her child is white. Granted Gabriel Aubry acts like a cad, but that is par for the course in Hollywood. </p>
<p>So long as she can claim victim status, she will be highly regarded. If she suddenly decided to join the Tea Party and use her wealth in a productive manner, Halle Berry would disappear into Hollywood&rsquo;s memory hole. </p>
