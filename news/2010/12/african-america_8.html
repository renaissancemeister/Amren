<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>African-Americans have more non-calcified plaque than others, which may increase their heart attack risks, U.S. researchers say.</p>
<p>Researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston say whites had more calcified plaque but African-Americans had non-calcified soft deposits deep in the walls of the arteries.</p>
<p>&#8220;The African-Americans and Caucasians we studied had approximately the same amount of plaque in their arteries, but different kinds of plaque,&#8221; Dr. John Nance Jr. says in a statement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This study confirms that the coronary artery disease pathways that lead to acute cardiovascular events are different for Caucasians and African Americans,&#8221; study co-author Dr. U. Joseph Schoepf says in a statement. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The findings were presented at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America in Chicago.<br>

		<p>Unless these differences are due to different diets they are more evidence that racial differences are biologically significant, and not the &#8220;social construct&#8221; liberals want us to believe.  </p>

		<p>This is likely due to differences in processing &amp; production of vitamin D between the races.  If you accept the link between bacterial infections &amp; heart disease (which is pretty well proven, but science is unwillingly to say multiple causative infectious agents can cause heart disease, they want a specific agent always = this end result, rather than X # of agents each can cause it) the difference can be accounted for very easily. 1,25(OH2)D3 causes a variety of effects in the immune system, including production of cathlecidins (which are important in killing off bacterial infections), and how toll like receptors(that help the body identify friend from foe) behave. </p>
<p>The darker skin, and resultant lower levels of D production may be largely responsible for this difference. If the genes from toll like receptors aren&rsquo;t transcribing as frequently because of lower levels of 1,25(OH2)D3, its entirely possible this would lead to this result. Its also possible that different rates of exposure to (*sometimes different) communicable diseases, in particular sexually transmitted diseases may account for the rest of the difference. </p>
<p>Antibiotics which break a cell wall don&rsquo;t necessarily eliminate an infection, they simply break the cell wall. Many infectious organisms can revert to L-forms. If you accept L-forms an be infectious &amp; go on to parasite healthy cells this discrepancy makes perfect sense. If you are locked into a disease model where L-forms are not infectious, you&rsquo;ll likely be looking at some other cause for the difference.  </p>
<p>Even though there is ample evidence from diseases like reactive arthritis, pelvic inflammatory disease, syphilis, and lyme disease that a short course of cell wall breaking antibiotics doesn&rsquo;t always clear an infection, science, and medical doctors have been slow to catch on to the emergent science that these infections are not always cleared by the standard treatments, and that these L-form infections can have lasting, and consequential health effects. Even with proven links to chlamydia pneumoniae causing heart disease, doctors &amp; other researchers are still slow to accept it, and often try to blame some other environmental cause for it.  </p>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t he add that the only difference between blacks and whites is skin color?</p>
<p>I wonder if his funding is going to be pulled now.</p>

		<p>Right, calcified plaque has always been thought to be the main cause of heart disease, heart attack, etc.</p>
<p>This is a game changer, as they say. Treatments for blacks just have to different. And only now this is appreciated.</p>

		<p>Revised Politically Correct Human Biology:<br>
Okay, humans evolved different skin colors, bone structures, susceptibility to diseases, rates of maturation, muscle composition, and brain size. But we know that innate intelligence and personality are absolutely uniform across the races. Because if they weren&rsquo;t, that would imply that there is are superior and inferior races, at least in measuring qualities that contribute to the overall quality of life in a society, and that would, by liberal logic, equal Nazism. Therefore it simply Cannot Be True that innate intelligence and personality differ between the races.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d like to see this site do some research on certain illnesses such as Cystic Fibrosis, Multiple Sclerosis, Macular Degeneration,<br>
Testicular Cancer, Suicide, Osteoporosis, Melanoma,rosacea,just to<br>
name a few. (there are others) All of these illness are known to have their higher<br>
frequencies in the white race. However, all you can seem to talk about is what is allegedly a problem with non whites. If you can&rsquo;t find any evidence of what I am saying, get back to me. I can get it for you. </p>

		<p>AmRen focuses on stories like this because, as with everything else, blacks blame their poor health on whites, when in fact some (probably most) of their problems can be traced back to genetic tendencies within their race. Though the fact that most blacks simply lack self-control and hence gorge on fried and high-sugar foods certainly doesn&rsquo;t help. It&rsquo;s just not politically correct to say these things in public. By contrast, it&rsquo;s perfectly politically correct to attribute white illnesses to genetics, because it reinforces the idea that whites are innately inferior to blacks, and only have advantages over blacks in economic, academic, political, and military achievement out of luck. By attributing all white ills to genetics, while attributing all black ills to environment (presumably the fault of whites), they can convince whites that they are an inferior race, in opposition to all the evidence to the contrary.</p>
