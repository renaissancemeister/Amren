<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In what has become a topsy-turvy city council election in Paterson, N.J., the candidate who was declared the winner in May was arrested Thursday on a charge of witness tampering in a voter-fraud investigation being conducted by the state attorney general and the state criminal justice director.</p>
<p>The candidate, Rigo Rodriguez, 38, was arrested at his home in Paterson on Thursday morning along with his wife, Lissette, 31. His campaign manager, Juan Jimenez, 45, was also arrested. They were taken into custody by the New Jersey State Police and issued summonses before being released. They were ordered to appear at the Passaic County Superior Court, but a date has yet to be scheduled.</p>
<p>Criminal Justice Director Stephen Taylor said in a news release that each of the three was charged with third-degree witness tampering but that additional charges may be brought. On Tuesday and Wednesday, 11 people were arrested on charges of voter fraud.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is alleged that after the defendants became aware of an active investigation by the Division of Criminal Justice and State Police, they instructed voters as to how to answer police questions, including advising them to lying (sic) to police,&#8221; a news release from Attorney General Paula Dow and Taylor said.</p>
<p>The investigation stems from the election in which Rodriguez, the incumbent councilman, originally was determined to be the loser to his opponent, Kenneth McDaniel. The result was reversed after 49 uncounted absentee ballots were uncovered. Then McDaniel raised questions of voter fraud, saying that ballots had been faked or tampered with.</p>
<p>In October, Superior Court Judge Thomas Brogan ruled that there was no evidence of impropriety in the election, but McDaniel appealed to Dow to investigate. This week, Dow found grounds for fraud, which could result in McDaniel ousting Rodriguez after all.</p>
<p>The 11 people who were arrested on Tuesday and Wednesday are accused of falsifying absentee ballots by writing in the names of voters without their knowledge, according to The Record newspaper. One woman is also accused of voting twice, under her married name and her maiden name. All 11 were issued complaint summonses and released, the attorney general said in a news release. They will be ordered to appear in court at a later date. The case is subject to presentation to a grand jury for possible indictment.</p>

		<p>It is not surprising that Third World people have Third World behavior.  As America becomes populated by more and more Third World people, this type of corruption will simply become the normal way to do business, as it currently is in much of the Third World.</p>

		<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter. In NJ, the guy who&rsquo;ll take Rodriguez&rsquo;s place will be worse than Rodriguez. That&rsquo;s the way things are here.</p>

		<p>I bet this is happening many times over throughout the country,<br>
and in the majority of the cases will not be investigated <br>
because of the fear of being labeled as a &#8216;racist&rsquo; and<br>
liberal dominated courts and attorneys will do all they can<br>
to squash any investigation. It is far more important to be<br>
diverse than moral, and ethical. <br>
I applaud this rare case, and the courage to bring it about.</p>

		<p>Paterson, New Jersey was once a wonderful Italian neighborhood.</p>
<p>They began moving out around the time local thug Rubin Carter slaughtered three whites in a Paterson bar, thus becoming a hero to Hollywood and the media.<br>

		<p>Racism debate will remain in the forefront of North American society because a substantial number of marginally skilled people make a nice living off it, often on the taxpayer&rsquo;s dime.</p>
<p>Racism is stereotyping and is a soud method of making &#8220;fight or flight&#8221; decisions quickly when faced with a large amount of information.  Stereotyping utilizes the main points of the current information at hand and, along with experience and historic knowledge, allows quick assessment of an urgent situation.  Ie. it is done &#8220;without (or with very little) thinking&#8221;.</p>
<p>By its nature this type of decision may sometimes be wrong but it usually leads to a safe decision made under severe time constraints.</p>
<p>When accused of racism don&rsquo;t bother to deny it.  Simply say &#8220;OK, show me where I am wrong with my facts.&#8221;</p>
<p>AND IF IT IS TRUE IT IS NOT RACISM!</p>
<p>Think about this.  We are told that &#8220;racism&#8221; (stereotyping) is wrong.  How can facts be wrong?  If the decision turned out to be the wrong one then the underlying facts were not facts to begin with, and one simply stands corrected.</p>
<p>What is racism are government job ads stating that &#8220;White males need not apply&#8221;.  Why?  Because there is no evidence -facts- that a white male is less capable of doing the job than a person of any other colour.</p>

		<p>When accused of racism don&rsquo;t bother to deny it.</p>
<p>This shows a misunderstanding of what racism is.  Before the term was invented by communists, the very idea of racism did not exist, let alone the idea that such thinking was wrong.  People understood race.  They understood the implications of race.  They certainly kept separate.  But the idea of the races competing with each other was not present.  The idea that blacks were slaves, was not present&hellip;.nor is it in line with reality.  Huge numbers of white people were slaves concurrently with blacks.  Black did not equal slave, is my point.  Whites were not keeping blacks down.  They simply lived separate from us and failed to produce institutions of quality alongside ours.  They were not kept out or kept down.  The very idea that people would live together, build together and then share what they built, did not exist&hellip;&hellip;.for thousands of years of recorded history I might add.</p>
<p>The term racism, itself, is a form of brainwashing.  A whole bunch of unstated (and untrue) presuppositions come into play when the word is even mentioned.  If you accept the term itself, even if you successfully prove it&rsquo;s wrong, you have already lost because you allow those unstated presuppositions to stand.  What are you going to do, go on and on and on for an hour or two debunking these things&hellip;..as if anyone would even listen?</p>
<p>No&hellip;..what must be done when the term is raised is to simply look the person in the eye and laugh.  Keep laughing until they flip out and leave.</p>
<p>Laughter is a subtle form of dominance that, in this case, ridicules and diminishes the person using the term even as it turns the very idea of racism into a joke.  This is very important.  Not only should racism be a joke, not worthy of rebuttal but the person attempting to use this psychological warfare tool should be made to feel shame, embarrassment and diminished status.  It&rsquo;s particularly effective when its a group of people laughing at an individual.</p>

		<p>Me? I&rsquo;d ten-times rather be thought of as a racist than a gullible fool! I mean if every bit of evidence indicates minorities are more crime-prone Whites, why pretend? It wasn&rsquo;t Whites who destroyed so much of Philadelphia, turning a vast part of the city into an urban blight. It was the Black inhabitants. If so many Latinos (Mexicans) appear to thrive on commission of innumerable crimes&hellip; WHY DENY IT? Some of us know from our careers, the excellent possiblity our average illegal immigrant is also guilty of various and sundry acts of real crime.</p>
