			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Whitehead, London Telegraph, December 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>David Cameron has promised to bring net migration down from the &#8220;hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands&#8221; by 2015 to ease public concerns over numbers coming to Britain.</p>
<p>But new measures to achieve that are unlikely to have any significant impact during 2011, according to a report by the Institute for Public Policy Research (ippr).</p>
<p>It warns EU citizens, whose movement the Government cannot control, could arrive in Britain in increasingly large numbers to look for jobs, with Irish people expected to be among the biggest arrivals.</p>
<p>Measures against others immigrant groups, such as foreign students, will also take time to have an impact.</p>
<p>As a result, it concludes there is little chance that net migration, the difference between those arriving and those leaving, will drop much below 200,000 over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>Figures last month showed next migration was 215,000 in last year meaning levels had actually risen not fallen.</p>
<p>The Government has announced a cap of 21,700 for non-EU workers during 2011 and is consulting on plans that will slash the number of foreign students by up to 100,000 a year.</p>
<p>But the ippr study warns a series of factors mean will severely attempts to bring the inflow down.</p>
<p>It said if the UK economy continues to perform better than some Eurozone countries such as Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece, then EU workers could head here to look for work.</p>
<p>It has already been predicted that some 120,000 Irish nationals could leave home and the UK would be the preferred destination for many.</p>
<p>Similarly, despite a recent drop in the number of Eastern Europeans coming to the country, the number of Lithuanians and Latvians arriving has increased by 25 per cent in the last year and could continue, the report said.</p>
<p>The cap on migrant workers will also only have a small impact on overall immigration flows while the measures to cut student numbers are unlikely to take full effect during 2011.</p>
<p>The report said the Government was a &#8220;long way&#8221; from its overall objective, adding: &#8220;Reducing net migration by more than half would be a challenging task for any government, at any time, but it is made harder in the UK by the fact that government has no (or limited) control over some major immigration flows.&#8221;</p>
<p>It concluded: &#8220;Despite the government&rsquo;s efforts, net immigration to the UK looks unlikely to fall significantly in 2011.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the UK economy continues to recover, we might even expect to see increases in some forms of immigration for work, despite the cap.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also warned that a failure to meet the target could leave lasting damage in the minds of the public.</p>
<p>&#8220;As Labour found, once a reputation for competence on migration is lost, it is very hard to regain. 2011 may see the Coalition government learnt his lesson the hard way,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>Nick Pearce, ippr director, said: &#8220;ippr analysis suggests a sharp drop in immigration is unlikely to happen in 2011 on current trends, so ministers must be careful to manage down public expectations.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cap on skilled migration from outside the EU, which the government has already been put in place, could hurt the economic recovery. Other hasty measures to reduce numbers artificially would be even more damaging.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bringing down the level of immigration, which has been high in recent years, is a legitimate policy goal. But this should be done by making long term and sustainable reforms to the structure of our economy and labour market.&#8221;<br/>

		<p>Who cares if the Irish or Latvians enter Britain.  They can assimilate.  Irish/English cross border migration goes back centuries.  </p>
<p>What about all the non-whites who are setting up separate nations in vast swaths of England&rsquo;s cities?</p>

		<p>Each time I read of the massive amount of immigration (invasion?) going on in the world, I picture whole countries left sparsely populated or empty while the more progressive nations are drowning under the weight of third world inhabitants who will surely change the invaded nation into the same holes from which they came. The world cannot sustain itself in this manner. And maybe this is the way the world ends, not with a bang but with illegal immigration.</p>

<p>I can only assume that you do not live in the United Kingdom and never have, otherwise you would understand the issues surrounding Irish immigration.</p>
<p>Mass immigration from the Irish Republic (as it had by then become) to England, like mass third-world immigration, only began after the Second World War. Before then it was only on a modest scale, allowing the easy assimilation that you take for granted.</p>
<p>In many respects the mainly Roman Catholic, generally Anglophobe Irish were a vanguard for other immigrants to England - hostile to its culture, resentful of its indigenous people and simply out for what they could get materially. As a Londoner (a real one, that is) I have known many Irish people (since even after several generations of settlement here they NEVER call themselves English); while many are extremely nice people as individuals they tend to marry among themselves and hold aloof from the host society which they despise and feel no sense of gratitude or obligation towards. </p>

		<p>Jay, maybe if you weren&rsquo;t one of those millions of rootless White Americans who&rsquo;ve lost their sense of ethnic identity, you&rsquo;d care.  Northerners and Southerners are White but as I Southerner I can tell most Northerners aren&rsquo;t culturally compatible and many are even downright hostile to our traditions. Their massive migration from the North swamping the Old South constitutes genocide in my eyes. If European countries don&rsquo;t maintain the integrity of their countries and that includes other Europeans as well as third worlders, their cultures will cease to exist. </p>

<p>Guaranteeing that the wages of British workers will never rise significantly. </p>
<p>Migratory Eurozone workers include immigrant Arabs, Asians and Africans with EU passports. </p>

		<p>This is not necessarily a race issue but a nationalist and religious issue. The Britannic people especially its English Cohort are substantially different in custom, religion, law, and history from the rest of history. Intriguing and eventually forcing the UK into the EU largely opened up the British to seeing first their institutions taken over by Continental Catholics and now their entire neighborhoods. The EU is not only to Anglo-Saxon liberties of which the US is the last best remaining hope, but as a creation of Papal Supremacists is a creature of the Counter-Reformation with the aim of finally extinguishing the Nordic national liberties which were reborn in the Peace of Westphalia of 1648. God help us all. </p>

<p>Are those the decedents of the people that England sent to Ireland hundreds of years ago?</p>
<p>Well at least the English are not speaking German. </p>

		<p>This article is only written to serve as a distraction, focused as it is on those pesky Eastern Europeans, all of whom are ultimately Celtic in origin.  The real threat is the unmentioned Muslim/Arab, African/Asian immigration.  </p>
<p>Of course the sad thing is that because of human nature and how history works, many neighboring countries have more national animosity built up between them than they can muster for racial/religious groups.  This has been being used since WW2 very effectively in all Western nations by both entrenched capitalists and aspiring communists.  The loser is the indigenous white who has seen his community under attack for 50 years.  I don&rsquo;t think that there is one safe harbor left to whites alone.  However, Christianity will go on, absorbing and adapting to whatever current trend civilization takes.  Internal battles within the three middle eastern religions have always existed.  What they displace is the true indigenous spirituality of Europeans.</p>

		<p>Irish in Ireland are being displaced by Asians and blacks.  Their government tells their own to emigrate while they accept new immigrants from non-white nations.  They are debating over the ghettoizing of one neighborhood in Dublin, unable to find enough volunteer whites to live among them or go to school with them.  No one ever seems to be able to learn from anyone else.</p>
