<h1><a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2010/11/the_dangerous_mythology_of_imm.html">The Dangerous Mythology of Immigration</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Frank Burke, American Thinker, November 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Myth No. 1: </b><i>&#8220;Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses/The wretched refuse of your teeming shore .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; </i>Well, not quite. Emma Lazarus&rsquo;s 1883 poem &#8220;The New Colossus&#8221;  &mdash;  written in the year the Statue of Liberty was dedicated  &mdash;  has been taken by many to reflect a true picture of immigration. This is not the case. From the colonial period on, there were standards that immigrants had to meet. Originally addressed at the regional level, then by the states, they were eventually federalized. The immigration stations, such as the one at Ellis Island in New York harbor, were not welcoming centers. They were processing points for the inspection and certification of new arrivals. Individuals with physical or mental problems, or who were known to be criminals in their country of origin, were denied entry. Older or underage family members required sponsorship. All of this was to ensure that the newly arrived immigrants would not be a burden to their new country and could either support themselves or be supported by others.</p>
<p>Further, the America of the 17th through the early 20th centuries possessed a large appetite for unskilled or semiskilled labor. Labor contractors advertised in Europe for workers. {snip}</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s situation is different. The market for unskilled labor is a tiny fraction of what it was. Even in agriculture, many of the harvesting processes once performed by migrants now utilize machines. America still has a place for immigrants, but with the advent of technology, the qualifications required have markedly changed.</p>
<p><b>Myth No. 2: </b><i>People come here because they want to become Americans. </i>Some do, but today, many do not. {snip}</p>
<p>Unlike previous generations, those who come today do so for a variety of reasons. Some come seeking economic opportunity but have no desire to break ties with their own country. This is observable in the demonstrations held by Latinos seeking amnesty. Some carry Mexican flags and signs proclaiming what they believe the U.S. owes them. The second-largest source of income in Mexico derives from remittances sent from the United States. So-called paths to citizenship have not met with an enthusiastic reception.</p>
<p>Others, in turn, come for more nefarious reasons. Members of the Mexican Reconquista movement, including the National Will Organization, Mexica movement, and La Voz de Aztlan, seriously wish to reclaim the lands lost by Mexico in the Mexican War, as well as other states with high Hispanic populations. These would include California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Nevada, and Colorado.</p>
<p>Other advocates of multiculturalism, including foreign nationals, religious sects, and cults, seek to reduce the United States to colonial status for their own purposes. Just as radical Islamists in the United Kingdom and elsewhere are advocating the imposition of Sharia Law on the population, some here seek the same end.</p>
<p>Even where the intention is not initially malicious, multiculturalism can have problematic results. National and other groups that choose to live apart from the mainstream, retaining their own language, culture, and customs, frequently experience serious problems in the second generation. {snip}</p>
<p><b>Myth No. 3: </b><i>Everyone is really seeking the same things. </i>No other myth is more insidious than the one world philosophy that has impacted not only the immigration debate, but also our foreign policy for over half a century. Traditionally, people who came to America in pursuit of a better life assimilated into the American mainstream. Defining themselves along similar lines, they shared many of the same values and goals. As a result of that experience, it has become very easy for Americans to project the idea of mutual tolerance and communality worldwide. {snip}</p>
<p>The wishful thinking that all nations are somehow equal and that we all desire the same things is na√Øve on the face of it and deadly in its implementation. The individual who murders his daughter in an honor killing; the family that celebrates the martyrdom of children who destroyed themselves while killing innocent people; or the tribe whose members practice genocide against its neighbors are not going to be satisfied with a good job, a nice house, education for their children, and a wide-screen HDTV.</p>

		<p>As far as myth #3, even if everyone on Earth were seeking the same things, (read:  material prosperity), that doesn&rsquo;t mean everybody deserves it.  As a matter of fact, the more people try to get these things, the fewer people will have these things.  To wit:  Gas will never be cheap again because of the skyrocketing demand from China and India.  Once they want to start eating like Americans, then a trip to the supermarket will seem like a spree at Needless Markup.</p>

		<p>How the Statue of Liberty&rsquo;s meaning was transformed   &mdash;  - from symbol of America&rsquo;s liberty ENLIGHTENING the world to America as a HAVEN for all the world   &mdash;  - is useful in understanding the immigration crisis: </p>
<p>Notes below are from a book by immigration historian Otis L. Graham, UNGUARDED GATES: A History of America&rsquo;s Immigration Crisis: </p>
<p>The Statue of Liberty was sculpted by Frederic Auguste Bartholdi and named by him LIBERTY ENLIGHTENING THE WORLD.  It was donated to the U. S. by France in 1886 and placed in New York harbor as a symbol of America as a model to inspire other lovers of freedom.  A proposed link to immigration had been, ironically, rebuffed.</p>
<p>The would not be the end of it. </p>
<p>A poem by young Jewish woman, Emma Lazarus, called the New Colossus, with the famous concluding lines, had been read, along with others, at the opening of the exhibition for the pedestal in 1883, after which the poem and poet were largely forgotten.</p>
<p>In 1903, a friend of Lazarus got permission to place a small bronze tablet containing the poem on the inside wall of the pedestal. Indeed, as the Statue of Liberty was one of the first sights of new immigrants to America, a certain mythology of welcome and asylum was generated  &mdash;  that is, the Lazarus interpretation.</p>
<p>But most Americans thought of the statue as both local curiosity and  &mdash;  as it was intended  &mdash;  proud acknowledgment that U. S. liberty did indeed enlighten the world.</p>
<p>In the 1930s, however, journalists and history textbook writers began to link the statue not with liberty but with immigration.  The language of the Park Service interpreters and the national media &#8220;began a long term shift of the meaning of &#8216;Lady Liberty&rsquo;  &mdash;  and thus, America  &mdash;  from spreading freedom by example to offering unconditional asylum.&#8221; (Otis L. Graham, historian of immigration, author Unguarded Gates: A History of America&rsquo;s Immigration Crisis, 2004)</p>

		<p>Today, &#8220;immigration&#8221; both legal and illegal is about one thing and one thing only&hellip;&hellip;funneling welfare money into the drug trade&hellip;.and by extension, human trafficking (especially children for sex), and guns.  That last is related to a nebulous, unfocused plan to take territory on both sides of the border and create a new country totally devoted to drug and slave trafficking, similar to what was attempted in columbia.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that non-whites use the greater portion of welfare to buy drugs and &#8220;immigrants&#8221; come here to supply those things.</p>

		<p>The biggest myth of all is that immigration is some kind of inherent &#8220;right&#8221;, and thus exempt from criticism, when it is actually just a revocable privilege.</p>

		<p>Here is another, and in my view, the BIGGEST myth that the Cultural Marxists routinely spout and that is that &#8216;America is a nation of immigrants&rsquo;, and therefore, the founding stock of this nation have no legitimate right to deny entrance to the entire third world - who, as explained above, are nearly always coming here for one reason - to improve their standard of living.  </p>
<p>News Flash:  To the extent America was a &#8216;nation of immigrants&rsquo;, it was a nation of EUROPEAN, WHITE immigrants.  Whites are the owners of this piece of real estate - because OUR 100 percent White Founding Fathers and white ancestors settled it, tamed it, and built this nation out of wilderness.   This continent is NOT a vacant land mass that is unsettled, unclaimed, and up for grabs by whoever manages to step foot on our shores and decides that they intend to steal it from its rightful owners.  </p>
<p>Therefore, since it is our ethnic group&rsquo;s property - we have every legitimate, moral, and justified right to resist having our people dispossessed, replaced, or displaced and then subjugated to rule by hundreds of millions of third world, non-white people whose &#8220;talents&#8221; for building and maintaining prosperous civilizations were so pitiful that they fled the failed nations of their ancestry and desperately sought to move into a nation created by whites.  </p>
<p>It is past time for whites to start acting like &#8216;owners&rsquo;, and to put our collective foot down and say we are NOT going to allow race card playing, minority race hustlers to steal our birthright away from us.  </p>

		<p>And dreadfully ironic it is that the meaning has changed to those new immigrants who absolutely do not want the ideals of Liberty to complicate their religious fundamentalist, backward ideology. Multiculturalism is always a bust.</p>

		<p><i>Traditionally, people who came to America in pursuit of a better life assimilated into the American mainstream</i></p>
<p><i>The young nation&rsquo;s very first naturalization law, passed in 1790, required that new citizens be free white persons.</i></p>
<p>These days, instead of being grateful for acceptance and entry into America, offered a door to freedom and prosperity and educated in American traditions and culture, Amerika&rsquo;s new non-White replacement class is immediately indoctrinated into leftist hate-America propaganda spewed via academia, the media and the highest office of the land.</p>
<p>When TOTUS himself goes around the world apologizing for White America&rsquo;s supposed mis-deeds and makes a case &#8220;that it requires &#8216;audacity&rsquo; to hope for anything other than discrimination and injustice from this nation,&#8221; why would any new colonists, approximately 90% non-White, want or desire to assimilate with the Native Born White popultion?</p>
<p>The new replacement class is being handed everything we Native Born Americans have created and worked for, and they are not required to give up their language, culture or even country of origin, and, in fact are encouraged to maintain their separate identities from Whites.  </p>
<p>Our government has been co-opted by leftists who hate Native Born White Americans. The purpose of importing large numbers of non-White immigrants is to replace and destroy White Americans.</p>
<p>Period.</p>
<p>And, it is an atrocity.</p>
