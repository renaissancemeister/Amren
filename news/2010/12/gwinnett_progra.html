<h1>Gwinnett Program Results in 1,400 Deportations</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andria Simmons, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Dec. 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A controversial program to identify illegal immigrants in the Gwinnett County Jail has been in operation a little more than a year, and officials say the program already is saving money and bed space.</p>
<p>So far, deputies have identified 3,034 inmates who were in the United States illegally, about half of whom ultimately were removed from the country after immigration proceedings.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m very pleased with the program so far,&#8221; Gwinnett County Sheriff Butch Conway said. &#8220;It has saved the county millions of dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>As part of the county&rsquo;s participation in a local-federal partnership called the 287(g) program, which officially began in November 2009, 18 sheriff&rsquo;s deputies were trained to enforce certain federal immigration laws. Inmates suspected of being in the country illegally are turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement after their cases are disposed of. ICE then will initiate deportation proceedings against them. The detainees still have the opportunity to go before an immigration judge to plead their case.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jail statistics also do little to dispel one of the main complaints about such local law enforcement partnerships with ICE. Despite the 287(g) program&rsquo;s stated goal of deporting criminal illegal immigrants who pose a danger to public safety, it often nets minor offenders. About 470 inmates who were detained for ICE were charged with driving without a license, and 1,264 were charged with some other traffic violation. That&rsquo;s almost half the total number of detainees from Gwinnett.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He believes the decline in foreign-born inmates is a direct result of illegal immigrants leaving Gwinnett or ceasing to drive to avoid being jailed and deported.</p>
<p>Lilburn Police Chief John Davidson said the program probably has made the county safer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously, if 1,400 offenders are gone from our community, that is going to have an overall impact on crime,&#8221; Davidson said. &#8220;These are people that came into contact with the sheriff because they were committing some sort of criminal offense.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pro-immigrant groups have been critical of the 287(g) program, and Gwinnett&rsquo;s partnership is no exception. Opponents say the program promotes racial profiling, tears apart families and causes distrust between law enforcement and the immigrant communities they are tasked with policing. The ACLU has called for the Obama administration to end the program, saying it is fundamentally flawed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the whole system encourages racial profiling,&#8221; said Azadeh Shahshahani, a spokeswoman for the ACLU of Georgia. &#8220;The stated purpose is to go after the most serious offenders and to make our community safer, but in some situations it&rsquo;s not really clear why people are being pulled over in the first place.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Several other Georgia law enforcement agencies, including the Roswell Police Department and the Cherokee and Forsyth sheriff&rsquo;s departments, have asked to join the program. However, ICE has not approved any new programs in Georgia in 2010, citing funding issues.</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey (R-Ga.) supports 287(g) and hopes to one day expand it.</p>
<p>&#8220;The 287(g) program is a great program and it works hand in glove with the Secure Communities initiative,&#8221; Gingrey said. &#8220;I think both those programs are necessary. I would like to see every county participate.&#8221;<br>

<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the real reason. They could easily secure the funding by cutting all of the welfare benefits and state subsidies awarded to GA illegals.   </p>

<p>1. Most illegal aliens in the US are Hispanic, so profiling Hispanics who are suspected of being illegal aliens is common sense. If most of the illegal aliens in the US came from a different cultural and ethnic background, that particular culture and ethnic background would get profiled more frequently for illegal immigration.</p>
<p>2. The government is not responsible for &#8220;tearing apart families.&#8221; Illegal aliens came here knowing that it is possible they would get caught and subsequently deported. Illegal aliens need to take responsiblity and stop blaming our government for merely enforcing the law.</p>

		<p>Reired Mecklenburg County (Charlotte-area) Sheriff Jim Pendergraph is the father of the 287(g) program east of the Mississppi.  Excerpts below of March, 2009 letter he published in the Raleigh News &amp; Observer:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I&rsquo;m the person who started the 287(g) program on the East Coast, and the facts need to be straightened out. </p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing in the 287(g) law stating the purpose for the 287(g) program is to deal only with the very worst offenders. I find it difficult to believe any ICE agency official would say that. While detention space often makes it necessary to detain only the worst offenders, everyone legally arrested and identified under the 287(g) program as an illegal alien must be dealt with. Most minor offenders are released pending an immigration hearing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Secondly, there is no verifiable evidence that the 287(g) program has ever put a chill on relationships with law enforcement that for the most part were already frozen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Third, when I started the 287(g) program in Mecklenburg County, I met repeatedly with immigrant groups and explained that the only way they would ever come in contact with the 287(g) program is if they were arrested.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems too many people are looking for excuses not to use a program that works, crying profiling and racism. It is high time people, all people, were held accountable for bad decisions and illegal conduct.&#8221;</p>

		<p>No&hellip;No&hellip;We are supposed to WAIT until the illegal aliens commit a felony crime against an American victim. Those without a drivers license cannot be stopped (like any American citizen) until they finally kill a carload of kids or some family. After all, driving while blitzed is a right for illegals. But WE must wait until an American citizen is killed, disabled for life, raped, stabbed, shot, or beheaded before illegals can be deported (yet again).</p>
<p>The main reason for deporting illegal aliens has nothing to do with keeping our communities safe&hellip;.it is their &#8220;get out of jail free&#8221; card. Getting deported saves them from rotting away for decades in state prison&hellip;.or maybe even saves them from capital punishment.</p>
<p>Not to worry though. The border is so porous, after knocking up a couple of their Mexican girlfriends, they will be back in the USA&hellip;.welcomed by their street gangsters, the liberal clergy, the traitors, and their fat American girlfriends&hellip;.oh, I almost forgot&hellip;.so they can resume their normal occupation as landscapers, panhandlers, and thieves. I know this because five of them followed me out of a Wells Fargo bank in Austin, Texas and robbed me of a nice sum of cash. What if I had been denied that experience and they had already been deported?<br>

<p>Only half?  What stupid rule allowed 1,500 illegal immigrant felons to stay?  I&rsquo;m sure it was cooked up by Democrats and the ACLU.</p>
<p><i>Pro-immigrant groups have been critical of the 287(g) program, and Gwinnett&rsquo;s partnership is no exception.

<p>Oh, dear, those illegal immigrant families that included a thief, assailant, drug dealer, rapist, or murderer are being torn apart?  Cry me river.  Also note that invariably the press uses the term &#8220;pro-immigrant group&#8221; when they mean &#8220;pro-illegal immigrant group&#8221;.  That&rsquo;s because those who write for our mass media are almost all in favor of illegal immigration.  Again we hear the tired argument that we must not enforce immigration law because it will spawn distrust between illegal immigrant &#8220;communities&#8221; and the police.  For the same reason we should not prosecute car thieves lest they become unwilling to cooperate with the cops in a murder case.</p>
<p>As usual the Anti-Christian Lawyers Union is doing what it can to make sure that no illegal immigrant ever gets deported, even when he&rsquo;s a criminal.  You will note that these bold defenders of the Bill of Rights have never stood up for the 2nd, 9th, or 10th Amendments.</p>
<p>The left was very clever to come up with the idea of &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; as the greatest sin any law enforcement officer could commit.  They knew then as we all know now that there is hardly any crime that doesn&rsquo;t show substantial disparities in the racial breakdown of the perpetrators.  So by making &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; the ultimate evil they&rsquo;ve ensured that the law will be enforced weakly if at all if the perps are black or Hispanic.  We get very few European illegal immigrants.  A few, I&rsquo;m sure, but not many.  Nearly all illegal immigrants are Mestizos, blacks, Arabs, Asians, or almost any race but white.  So now all attempts at enforcing immigration law are condemned as racial profiling.  (Don&rsquo;t forget that that charge was laid against the Arizona law as well.)</p>

		<p> I am tired of the argument that this type of program leads to a lack of trust between the immigrants and the police. If the illegal immigrant wasn&rsquo;t here the odds are neither would the criminal be here so the crime wouldn&rsquo;t occur.</p>
<p> Americans of all races are just sick of this problem and we will see action.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re 100% right.  I can add another reason   &mdash;   Racial pandering.</p>
<p>Domestic blacks and non-white immigrant communities with at least a significant percentage of illegal aliens are the only communities with whom we are supposed to have &#8220;good relations&#8221; such that we mollycoddle their low- to mid-level criminal class in order to have supposed &#8220;stool pidgeons&#8221; against their real bad apples.  (Of course, the &#8220;real bad apples&#8221; wouldn&rsquo;t be able to manifest their &#8220;bad appleness&#8221; if not for the low- to mid-level criminal classes.  Think about it   &mdash;   You&rsquo;re really not at risk of being mugged by the big time gold chain wearing Escalade-driving black drug kingpin in the ghetto   &mdash;   It&rsquo;s the mid-level addict miscreant who jacks you up in order to get money to buy drugs that becomes profits for the kingpin.)</p>
<p>However, whites don&rsquo;t have that luxury.  Nobody ever seems to want or need to &#8220;maintain good relations&#8221; with the &#8220;white community.&#8221;  (Mainly because the media won&rsquo;t allow the construct of a &#8220;white community.&#8221;)  But even beyond that, most subdivisions of the American white community don&rsquo;t get that luxury.  Here is an example:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/3y78k3p" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/3y78k3p</a></p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t the same libs who want &#8220;good relations&#8221; between law enforcement and ghettos/barrios, such that most criminal law should be made dead letter, take that same attitude about white gun owners in such cities and states?</p>

<p>The controlled media use the word &#8220;controversial&#8221; for two situations:</p>
<p>1. When a black or brown does something that makes zero sense.</p>
<p>2. When a white does something that makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>Thus, for example, Van Jones and Sharron Angle are both &#8220;controversial&#8221; according to the controlled media.</p>

<p>The feds and media think it&rsquo;s controversial to identify illegal aliens, but it&rsquo;s perfectly o.k. to encourage people to report on their neighbors.  Now Napolitano has a video in Walmart stores announcing that they have &#8220;Partnered&#8221; with Homeland Security to encourage their customers to report all &#8220;suspicious&#8221; activity.</p>
<p>Muslim jihadists are blowing up airplanes so all white Americans must be groped and radiated by TSA goons.  Now white Americans are being encouraged to report on their neighbors at Walmart, and the fools at Walmart think they&rsquo;re doing a really great service.  </p>
<p>BIG SISTER IS WATCHING YOU!</p>
<p>Can anyone really be that stupid to go along with such an obvious attempt to create a society where people report on each other????</p>

<p>  Don&rsquo;t you throw your line in the water where the fish are Mr. Shahshahani? You can fish in the rapids but you won&rsquo;t catch many fish. Aren&rsquo;t most of our illegal immigrants from Mexico, Central America, Caribbean, and assorted non white Third World Countries?  Does checking them more than Europeans equal &#8220;profiling&#8221; or reasonable judgment?</p>
