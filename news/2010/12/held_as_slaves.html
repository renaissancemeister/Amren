<h1>Held As Slaves, Now Free</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Scott Bronstein, Amber Lyon and Alexandra Poolos, CNN, December 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>They arrived in the United States from West Africa, young girls held against their will and forced to work for hours on end. But this time, it didn&rsquo;t happen hundreds of years ago.</p>
<p>Nicole&rsquo;s journey started in 2002, when she was barely 12, in her small village in western Ghana. She and about 20 other girls were held in plain sight, but always under the watchful eyes of their captors.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was like being trapped, like being in a cage,&#8221; said &#8220;Nicole,&#8221; now 19. CNN agreed not to use her real name.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The girls&rsquo; families sent them to the United States after being assured they would receive a better education. But once they arrived, they were forced to work in hair braiding shops across the Newark area  &mdash;  just a short drive from New York City, right in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty.</p>
<p>The girls, who are now young women, have never spoken publicly before, until now.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was horrible,&#8221; said Zena Amevor, who was 15 when she was brought over from Togo. &#8220;Sometimes there was not enough food for us to eat.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was like a prison. {snip}&#8221;</p>
<p>For the first time, the former slaves provided details about their horrifying odyssey and an intimate view into the world of human trafficking and contemporary slavery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jacqueline&#8221; was 13 when her family sent her to the United States, not knowing that a woman she called &#8220;auntie&#8221; was a human trafficker. It was unclear if the woman was a blood relative.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The girls worked in the salons right out in the open, in front of customers. They were on their feet all day, sometimes for more than 12 hours, weaving intricate and elaborate hair braids, seven days a week.</p>
<p>This went on for more than five years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At times, they were forced to braid the hair of American teenagers no older than they were  &mdash;  girls who were free and had no idea the people braiding their hair were slaves.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In one of the many ironies in the case, the customers whose hair was braided by the slave girls were mostly African-American women, many of whom could have been descendants of slaves brought to America generations ago.</p>
<p>Slavery through trafficking continues widely today in the United States, though often undetected, according to law enforcement officials.</p>
<p>Nicole, Zena, Jacqueline and the other girls were held in groups in several houses around Newark and East Orange, New Jersey. The girls were brought to the United States at different times between 2002 and 2007, according to court documents. As the group grew, the traffickers ran out of places to put them and had to rent more living quarters.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The traffickers convicted in this case were a mother, father and son who also came from West Africa, according to court documents and law enforcement officials.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The captors controlled the girls by beating them, withholding food, keeping them separated from anyone else and, at times, through sexual abuse, according to court documents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Peter Edge, who led the team of [ICE] agents, said none of the girls&rsquo; customers ever called officials to help.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hundreds of people came into these salons, they probably witnessed things out of the ordinary,&#8221; said Edge, special agent in charge of ICE&rsquo;s Homeland Security Investigations in Newark.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the 2007 raid, the ICE agents found a notebook the girls used to track the tips they received, but couldn&rsquo;t keep, at the hair salon. {snip}</p>
<p>More than two years later, Akouavi Afolabi; her husband, Lassissi Afolabi; and their son, Dereck Hounakey, were convicted of running the trafficking ring. Akouavi Afolabi was the ringleader, while her husband and son were accomplices, according to court documents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Court records show the Afolabis knew many of the families whose girls they lured away to become their slaves. They had an elaborate scheme to lure the girls: Mrs. Afolabi would approach families of young girls in Ghana and Togo, where she had connections, and tell the families she would give the girls an education in the United States. They then used fraudulent visa papers to sneak the girls into the country.</p>
<p>Experts say the main reason for most modern-day human trafficking is money.</p>
<p>&#8220;Human trafficking is extremely profitable,&#8221; said Bridgette Carr, a law professor and a national expert on human trafficking.</p>
<p>The customers at the hair braiding salon where Zena and Nicole were forced to work would sometimes pay as much as $200 to $400 for elaborate braiding that would take many hours to complete.</p>
<p>The traffickers took every penny made by the girls, both in tips and payments for their hair braiding. They made about $4 million, according to court documents.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s so profitable that we are seeing some drug traffickers get out of drug trafficking and into human trafficking,&#8221; said Carr, who teaches law at the University of Michigan Law School in Ann Arbor.</p>

<p>is there any evidence at all that either African blacks for African-Americans have any problem with slavery as an institution?</p>
<p>do the members of either group agitate against present-day slavery or contribute to antislavery groups?</p>
<p>I have a sneaking suspicion that being against slavery is kind of a white &#8220;hangup&#8221;. </p>
<p>from what I can tell, most blacks wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to turn one another or whites into slaves, and don&rsquo;t really understand the moral question involved.<br>

		<p>I read that there are tens of thousands of child slaves in Haiti and that there are hundreds of thousands of slaves all over West Africa and that it&rsquo;s &#8216;normal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Latinos and Asians traffic in sex and labor slaves at an unbelievable level too both in the West and in their home territories.</p>
<p>Ever wonder why white liberals don&rsquo;t touch this with a ten foot pole?  Because it will upend their fantasy narrative that slavery is the invention of the white man.  They also refuse to acknowledge that 95% of the africans kidnapped from Africa and brought to the new world went to the caribbean, central and south america, especially brazil.  </p>
<p>Because america became so advanced and our stories percolated everywhere, the 5% of slaves that were brought here became the basis for the fable that only america is responsible for slavery.  </p>

		<p>While certianly a crime story, this is not a story about sex slavery,which is what I expected when I first saw it headlined on the CNN site.  While it exhibits the lengths that some Africans will go to make some easy money, it is not so exclusive.  I went to work in Eastern Europe professionally, and soon found I was being financially abused, and &#8220;forced&#8221; to work long hours.  Attempts were made to control my movement, communication ability, etc.  But since I was older and they couldn&rsquo;t completely control me, I accepted some help from a couple courageous locals and broke away.  I eventually did just fine and enjoyed a couple years there.  </p>
<p>I suspect that this story is a set-up to assylum promotion for more Africans.  It is also a great distraction from the much more serious situation of sex-slavery, something that has gone on here for decades, and involves a large number of young white women and black pimps.  There has also been a problem with Hispanic sex slavery and Hispanic pimps.  I am not sure about what is going on regarding the American sweat shops, but that was a problem not too long ago.  The case of these girls does give a modern reminder of what really occured during the African slave buildup in North America.</p>
<p>You have to chalk this one up as one of the latest Nigerian money scams.</p>
<p>But I guess the punchline is contained somewhere in the vanity of being black and the necessity for elaborate hair design, regardless of what it takes to get it.</p>

		<p>Blacks putting blacks into slavery is new?  No.  It was blacks putting blacks into slavery from the same places 250 years ago.  Same now, as then.  It probably helps that these hair weavers were obviously NOT your typical ghetto black, as immediately apparent by their accent.  The ghetto blacks couldn&rsquo;t care less that their &#8220;weaves&#8221; were being done by fellow blacks held in slavery.  The ONLY slavery US blacks care about is that which can be used to further guilt whites into various forms of ongoing reparations called by other names - welfare, medicaid, various discrimination suits, bussing, huge sums of money trying to make stupid, unruly people into black Einsteins, and most lately 1 BILLION dollars to &#8220;farmers&#8221; who were &#8220;discriminated&#8221; against including at least one black congresswoman and her husband.  </p>

		<p>Is there any aspect of life where blacks are not horrible?</p>
<p>They seem to have a psychotic belief that no one else suffers, so whatever they do to benefit themselves is ok&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.  <br>
It&rsquo;s like being a stupid politician, but that is redundant. <br>
However, what does it say about the people that elect them.<br>
This doesn&rsquo;t exclude repubs either&hellip;&hellip;  what an insane country we are, in an insane world.  Some of the saner cultures, like in Tibet, or Czheckoslavakia, get raped by the powers that be&hellip;&hellip;  whew!!</p>

		<p>There are more slaves in the world now than at any point in history? Does that surprise you?</p>
<p>And this sort of thing is quite common actually? And in all case [I have never heard of a whitey doing this to a non-white] it is without exception a dark skinned person enslaving a dark skinned person. The slave owner usually walking around with $50,000 or so dollars in the pocket at all times.</p>
<p>Well, this is not actually slavery as back in the &#8220;old days&#8221;? NO PAPERS of ownership and such? I am sure that is what some apologist would argue.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this is interesting, during the time of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, about 600,000 Africans were brought from Africa to what became the U.S. And about 600,000 American soldiers total [including all on both sides] died during the American Civil War. I would say case closed.</p>

<p>Somebody or some group has to be stark raving mad to be importing blacks into the US.</p>

<p>If only whites would be so sensible about robotics, half our problems would vanish overnight.  Imagine running a four man work crew doing everything from housepainting to road repairs to yardwork and not having to pay them _anything_.</p>
<p>So that even while the government taxed you more and more and did things which lowered your standard of living to levels where you were making 10-20,000 dollars a year in real money, you could still live well because you could move from labor to managing labor. 4X10 = 40,000 a year again.</p>
<p>That said, the hard reality here is this-</p>
<p>1.  Those kids didn&rsquo;t skip school without someone noticing, particularly if no black kids (who couldn&rsquo;t afford multihour hair braids anyway) were there to mask their presence to other black adults.</p>
<p>2.  If those kids had parents who were worth the title, they would have _required_ weekly phone calls/EML, report card faxes, photos and letters.  As well as some kind of CV or public agency report documenting &#8216;Auntie&rsquo;s&rsquo; qualifications for the job of mentoring.  The first time that failed to happen, there would have been visits to the embassy and &#8216;Auntie&rsquo; would have been met with sharp implements the next time she came to buy&hellip;&rsquo;recruit&rsquo; more volunteers.  Renting apartments to house &#8216;prisoners&rsquo; also sounds utterly ridiculous so I&rsquo;m betting that these girls were sold up front and their parents given a continuing kickback with the expectation that they would be property.  Just not that of a bedhopping husband in Africa.</p>
<p>Given that even Africa is not the land of Stanley and Livingstone anymore, so why do we get treated like we&rsquo;re the trusting buffoons, believing in every sad sob story?</p>

<p>Selective memory here. This could just as easily been written &#8220;the customers whose hair was braided by the slave girls were mostly African-American women, many of whose ancestors sold slaves to traders generations ago,&#8221; as we were reminded of in an article a while back by noted Obama beer summiteer Henry Louis Gates Jr.</p>

<p><i>&ldquo;Hundreds of people came into these salons, they probably witnessed things out of the ordinary,&rdquo; said Edge, special agent in charge of ICE&rsquo;s Homeland Security Investigations in Newark.</i></p>
<p>Of course not, because the customers were benefitting from the lower prices afforded by these illicit practices. Why should they report anything? &#8220;Stop snitching&#8221; and all that.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m reasonably sure there&rsquo;s an error or two in this touching story. I mean, after all, we absolutely KNOW only Whites participated in slavery. That even the idea of enslaving Blacks was originated by Whites. That Blacks would never, ever mistreat their own in this fashion.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s only ironic if you assume that Africans never enslaved their own race. Although it IS ironic in that if they came from the coastal areas of West Africa, it may have been their ancestors that sold the ancestors of the blacks in America into slavery.</p>

		<p>For years, I&rsquo;ve wondered who the real &#8216;slaves&rsquo; are.  Recently in NE Philadelphia, a large housing project was closed by the city and razed to the ground because the blacks totally trashed the place.  Now all the Section-Eighters moved into my daughter&rsquo;s apartment complex and have begun tormenting the white residents who have been living there.  My granddaughter is only 6 years old.  She has been hit and threatened by black teens.  They stole all my daughter&rsquo;s lawn decorations and my granddaughter&rsquo;s scooter.  They bounce basketballs up against the outside wall day and night, just to torture them.  Just plain mean.  When any whites complain to a black parent (as usual, it&rsquo;s only Mom because nobody knows who the dad is), all they get is racial slurs and a flurry of filthy language.  My family is moving back here on December 31 until they find a place free of urban blacks.  The term &#8216;blockbuster&rsquo; from the 60s has now taken on a new meaning.  This is just a small preview of how things will be in the US for white people by the middle of this century.  Black &#8216;slavery&rsquo; won&rsquo;t hold a candle to how they will treat us when they finally outnumber whites.  We need representation.  What is needed is an intelligent person to represent the needs and desires of the white race.  Until that individual comes forward, whites are in danger of extinction.</p>

		<p>I think everyone here is looking at this all wrong. What has occured here is a humanitarian effort on the part of the &#8220;slavers&#8221;. Why in Africa, these poor children would either die from Malaria, AIDS, or being hacked up by another member of their own race. These folks were just trying to help these poor girls escape such fates. Naturally they need to make some money so that they can grow their humanitarian empire.<br>
That&rsquo;s the problem with us white folks, we don&rsquo;t see things like they do.</p>
