<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40630754/ns/world_news-europe/">Hundreds Protest Against Russian Government </a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dmitry Kozlov, MSNBC, December 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hundreds of people protested against the Russian government Sunday at two separate rallies in Moscow, with opposition activists calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and nationalists demanding greater rights for ethnic Russians. Several opposition activists were detained. </p>
<p>A third rally with nationalist overtones drew more than 1,000 students in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don, raising fears that long-standing ethnic tensions were reaching a boiling point.</p>
<p>The rallies followed violent clashes Saturday just outside the Kremlin walls between riot police and about 5,000 football fans and nationalists, who shouted &#8220;Russia for Russians.&#8221; Police said 34 people were injured; six of them were still hospitalized on Sunday. All 65 people detained during the clashes have been released.</p>
<p>The police crackdown further angered Slavic Russians who resent the growing presence of dark-complexioned people from Russia&rsquo;s predominantly Muslim republics in the Caucasus.</p>
<p>Dozens of nationalists picketed Sunday at the Federal Security Service headquarters to protest what they described as discrimination against Russians in favor of ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, all the (democratic) instruments have been trampled upon by the authorities, which means, if they don&rsquo;t want to use a civilized language, they will have to face, whether they want to or not, the Spartak (football club) rebellion, the crowds,&#8221; said Vladlen Kralin, a nationalist leader who goes by the name Vladimir Tor.</p>
<p>Saturday&rsquo;s clash grew out of a rally held elsewhere in the city to protest the death last week of Yegor Svidorov, a member of the Spartak team&rsquo;s fan organization, who was shot with rubber bullets in a fight at a bus stop. Those suspected of killing him are from the Caucasus.</p>
<p>The demonstration appeared to have inspired students in Rostov-on-Don, where 18-year-old Maxim Sychyov died last month after being beaten up by fellow university students from the nearby Caucasus.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 students gathered at his dormitory Sunday to light candles in his memory and then marched along the central avenue shouting &#8220;Go, Russians&#8221; and &#8220;Russians are united.&#8221; They called on university and city authorities to clamp down on students from the Caucasus.</p>
<p>The students, who were accompanied by police and Cossacks, dispersed peacefully.</p>
<p>The outburst of nationalism gave new ammunition to opposition leaders in Moscow, who drew several hundred people to a previously planned rally on a central square. They demanded Putin&rsquo;s resignation, saying his policies had aggravated ethnic tensions.</p>
<p>&#8220;A conflict based on national enmity, which is apparent now, means disintegration of our multiethnic country,&#8221; said opposition leader Boris Nemtsov. &#8220;If we start beating one another and spill blood, we&rsquo;ll be left without a country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several activists were detained after leading a group of protesters to City Hall.<br>

								<h2><a href="http://www.expatica.ru/news/russian-news/russian-football-fans-run-riot-in-moscow-protest_116753.html">Russian Football Fans Run Riot in Moscow Protest</a></h2>
						<p>Russian football supporters ran riot in the centre of Moscow on Saturday, when a demonstration against the death of a fan descended into violence that left dozens injured and around 100 under arrest. </p>
<p>Thousands of fans, supported by members of far-right groups, gathered in Manezhnaya Square near the Kremlin for the unauthorised protest, shouting slogans such as &#8220;Russia for Russians&#8221; and &#8220;Moscow for Muscovites&#8221;, according to an AFP photographer.</p>
<p>They were protesting the death of Yegor Sviridov, a Spartak Moscow fan who was shot in the head last Saturday during a fight with men from the Russian Caucasus.</p>
<p>The incident has exposed the close links between the Russian far-right and football supporters, and is a major embarrassment for the country so soon after it won the right to host the FIFA World Cup in 2018.</p>
<p>As many as 5,000 people, many wearing hoods and scarves to cover their faces, descended on the square, and fighting began to break out.</p>
<p>Several dozen supporters were beaten by anti-riot police, while at least five Caucasian men were violently attacked by supporters. Around 100 people were arrested.</p>
<p>Protestors also beat up a cameraman of state news agency RIA Novosti and smashed his camera.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the authorities don&rsquo;t change the policy on immigration, there will be a lot of bloodshed,&#8221; said one demonstrator, whose face was hidden begin a black mask.</p>
<p>The suspect in Sviridov&rsquo;s shooting, Aslan Cherkesov, who is from the Caucasus republic of Kabardino-Balkaria, is under arrest and claimed he was acting in self defence.</p>
<p>The violence followed a protest on Tuesday evening in which around 1,000 people blocked a Moscow highway and shouted racist slogans.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Saint Petersburg, around 1,500 supporters gathered for a similar unauthorised protest.</p>
<p>Police arrested about 60 people when fans broke through a police cordon and stopped traffic on several major roads.</p>
<p>Spartak Moscow is one of the top Russian premiership sides and it has an impassioned support base in the capital.</p>
<p>As Russia prepares to host the 2018 World Cup, its football fans  &mdash;  some of whom model themselves on British hooligans, wearing the same fashion labels and calling themselves &#8220;firms&#8221;  &mdash;  will be closely watched by the authorities.</p>
<p>In July another Spartak fan, telejournalist Yury Volkov, was stabbed to death in a fight with men from the Russian Caucasus in a central Moscow park. A Chechen man has been charged with the crime.</p>
<p>The killing prompted fans to brandish banners with Volkov&rsquo;s name at matches and to hold several public protests.<br>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t decided which European country I&rsquo;d want to be in.  Switzerland is very pro-gun rights, yet Russia is very pro-white and they aren&rsquo;t ashamed to admit it.  Of the few Russians I&rsquo;ve met, most were pro white and/or didn&rsquo;t care for the blacks and hispanics with their socialist, thug, anti-white attitudes.</p>

		<p> It appears that ethnic Russians, whatever their shortcomings, are more willing to stand up for their rights and their nationality, than are we White Americans. Why haven&rsquo;t we been protesting some of the indignities that we&rsquo;ve suffered in the last 30 or 40 years, out in the streets, in force? It seems that all we do is post on websites like this one, or hold college rallies that are often shouted down by Leftist hecklers.</p>
<p> I also notice that AFP slants its coverage against the Russian nationalists by using terms like &#8220;Russian far-right,&#8221; and pointedly noting that some of the protesters hid their faces with hoodies or other items. Has that reporter studied any Leftist riots lately? Hiding identities with masks is the &#8220;in&#8221; thing now; why only call attention to it when nationalists do it?</p>

		<p>SKIP, christian caucasians are just as disliked. Its kind of funny that these swarthy darkies are counted as white in the USA but not in Europe. You americans do not understand how nonwhite the &#8220;white&#8221; majority in the USA really is. Many americans, who considers themselves white, would be very surprised to find out that they would be counted as colored non-white caucasians in Europe. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s odd, how in 20 years Russia has gone from the major Republic in the USSR, to a Nationalistic White State, where the ethnic Russians protest in the streets, and defend their Culture, against Marxist Diversity. It&rsquo;s like the &#8220;Twilight Zone&#8221; where everything you knew, was turned upside down.</p>
<p>I am wondering when White Americans, and Western Europeans,  will find their voices, and backbones, to do the same as our fellow Russians? </p>

		<p>When will white Americans start doing what Russians do, namely chase down and beat or kill non-white and or Muslim invaders who harm, rape or kill their people? The Russian government is plainly still dominated by non-whites hostile to ethnic Russians, in other other words they still have a Bolshevik problem just as we have a Bolshevik menace here. They should protest, violently if necessary at every incident where a Russian is harmed or killed by these hostile aliens in their midst, just as whites here should protest, even riot over non-white on white atrocities such as the Knoxville murders and the Wichita Massacre. They should force the government to do something about this problem, or take the law in their own hands, just as we will here. </p>

<p>Most of us can&rsquo;t afford the grave risk to our jobs and pensions as the SPLC and ADL willing take names, photos and license plate numbers of any/all protestors at (what they call) &#8216;far-right&rsquo; rallies or protests   &mdash;   gladly handing over evidence to our employers.</p>
<p>More than one have lost their jobs this way, branded as a racist or Nazi by the SPLC, one phone call from the odious beirich is usually enough.  Ask Kevin MacDonald:  http://tinyurl.com/23t9658</p>
<p>Far lefties use Alinsky intimidation techniques against Whites to great effect, threatening to ruin our reputations.  If/when Hate Speech Laws come into effect, we will be brought up on charges of &#8216;inciting hate&rsquo; and face real prison time and heavy fines, as Whites in Europe are so threatened.</p>
<p>We are battling formidable forces it seems (but not insurmountable).</p>
<p>I, personally, cannot risk screaming out in the streets, although I&rsquo;d love to; therefore, I&rsquo;ve found other ways to &#8216;help our cause&rsquo; and that is by donating money to groups that represent my views   &mdash;   views such as fighting White displacement and genocide.</p>
<p>Organizations such as VDare.com run on a shoe-string, struggling without large infusions of government and Ford Foundation cash, depending on whatever donations they receive.   Brimelow has had VDare.com shut down lately until donations rise, writing the following:</p>
<p><i>To carry on publishing the truth about immigration, VDARE.com needs to continue in financial health. And for that, we need the assistance of you &mdash; our wonderful readership.</i></p>
<p>Believe me, as a public school employee (whose taken pay cuts this year, last year and more next year) and heavily taxed Californian, I am far from rich, but even $5 or $10 helps.</p>
<p>This is also a good way to start:   </p>
<p><i>Introduce the term &#8216;anti-White&rsquo; to mainstream political discourse in the only way possible – by starting with private conversation.</i></p>
<p>And then do it.</p>
<p>Bon</p>

		<p>This makes no sense at all. &#8220;Russia for Russians&#8221; is insane. I think there are ~82 official minority groups in Russia. Not recent immigrants either. They&rsquo;ve always been there. &#8220;Russia for Russians&#8221; is like saying that American Indians have no right to live in the US because they are &#8220;Americans.&#8221; It&rsquo;s madness. Anyone can go live anywhere they want to in Russia. Chechnya and Russia are like New York and California. It would be like New Yorkers marching with signs saying &#8220;No Californians in New York!&#8221; and beating up any Californians who show up there. Californians, and residents of any state, can go move anywhere they want to in the US. Residents of any part of Russia can go live anywhere else they want to in Russia. This is not an immigrant problem, unless you consider a Californian in New York to be an immigrant.</p>

		<p>Robert how many immigrants have flooded into Russia in the last 20 years? Hint just a few less than have come into USA. Russia is second in the number of illegal immigrants with some 13 million, 2.5 million in Moscow alone. </p>
<p>Robert you are also wrong on the number of ethnicities in the Russian Federation. There are 187. Some groups as small as 30 and some groups as large as 8 million. </p>
<p>Robert what is the birthrate of ethnic Russians whose forefathers founded the nation of Russia, compared to say Chechens.. Russians 1.3, chechens 10. Yes there are people who breed more than mexicans. </p>
<p>So the question is not so much that there have been other ethnicities there, but who will rule Russia? </p>
<p>Robert when Mexicans become the majority in USA are you willing to let them become the rulers and to impose their culture and language upon you? </p>

		<p>Robert Lindsay, the Russian nationalists wanting &#8216;Russia for the Russians&#8221;, are no more &#8220;Nazi&#8221; than you or Jared Taylor are. OK, so some of them display swastikas, a poor choice of symbols, but still, that doesn&rsquo;t make them disciples of Hitler. They happen to be fiercely nationalistic, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>And please don&rsquo;t compare Chechnya and Russia with New York and California. In many countries, there are &#8220;no go&#8221; zones, including ours. The old U.S.S.R. had the equivalent of our 50 states, in their &#8216;Soviet Socialist Republics&#8221;. They collapsed when communism fell there, and became independent nations.</p>
<p>We at Amren, have a right to support people&rsquo;s right to self-determination and preservation, no matter where they may be. We don&rsquo;t support multiculturalism, the way that you do, apparently.  </p>

<p>They are including those indigenous groups as &#8220;Russians&#8221;. You are exaggerating things.  When they are against non-Russians, they mean  other people, immigrants, from OUTSIDE of Russia.</p>
<p>The old Soviet Union broke apart so that these other nationalities could have their own countries where they would rule, have their own languages and cultures, and live among their own people.  Now, they want to leave those countries to come and live IN RUSSIA!  </p>
<p>What was the point of independencde, anyway?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like France gave Algeria its independence, and now half of Algeria seems to be residing in France!!!</p>
<p>Similarly, the Netherlands gave independence to Dutch Guiana [Suriman}. At that point, one-third of the population left Surinam and migrated to the Netherlands!  They didn&rsquo;t want to live among their own.</p>
