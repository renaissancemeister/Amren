			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert Weissberg, American Thinker, December 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As of November 2010, the overall unemployment rate for whites was 9.2%, but for African Americans, it was 16.0%. Among those aged 16 to 19, the difference (including both males and females) was significantly larger  &mdash;  20.9% for young whites versus 46.5% for young blacks. In job-rich Manhattan, only one in four young (16-24) black males was employed in 2010. What is especially remarkable about these statistics is their intractability. Since the 1960s and the War on Poverty, Washington has spent billions  &mdash;  everything from job training programs to tax incentives to anti-discrimination laws  &mdash;  to eradicate this gap, all to no avail. </p>
<p>Given a half-century of failure, efforts to narrow differences have grown increasingly desperate. The latest is the federal government&rsquo;s attempt to equalize how black and white job candidates appear to prospective employers even if they differ substantially  &mdash;  just ban employers from checking credit and criminal histories so as not to &#8220;unreasonably&#8221; disadvantage black job applicants. </p>
<p>The facts are straightforward. First, African-Americans are far more likely to have criminal records than whites, and according to a Federal Reserve report, they disproportionally also have credit problems  &mdash;  repossessions, bankruptcies, wage garnishments, outstanding unsatisfied court judgments, and high overdue credit card balances. Second, the internet (and other technologies) facilitates quick, inexpensive background checks of prospective employees {snip}. Third, the courts have held that an employer screening of job applicants is inherently racially discriminatory if blacks are disproportionally excluded according to criteria that lack direct connections to the jobs (the principle of disparate impact).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This anti-background check effort recently drew national attention when the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) sued the Kaplan Higher Education Corporation for using credit histories to screen applicants, a widespread and growing practice among both private firms and the government itself. According to the suit, since January 2008, Kaplan has examined applicant credit histories, and blacks have been disproportionately rejected. The EEOC demands that Kaplan not only cease this harmful practice, but that the corporation also award back wages and benefits to those African-Americans not hired due to credit troubles. Kaplan&rsquo;s defense is that it already has a diverse workforce and is an equal-opportunity employer, and creditworthiness is relevant since Kaplan employees often handle financial matters. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An almost prima facie case exists that criminal records and a poor credit rating tell a lot about a prospective employee, even for menial work. Past troubles provide clues about avoiding unwise risk, a capacity to plan, and a willingness to follow rules and otherwise behave prudently. These traits may have little to do with specific duties, but no employer wants a workforce of deadbeats and former felons. Yes, there may be a weak link between failure to pay one&rsquo;s credit card on time and sticky fingers when sweeping the store floor at midnight without supervision, but there may be a connection, and given multiple applicants for the floor-sweeper position, why risk hiring a thief? And even if the initial job is unrelated to past problems, what happens when this employee asks for a promotion where the shaky background is relevant? Denying this request only invites litigation. </p>
<p>That these hiring criteria are racially discriminatory does not mean that they are economically irrational. Especially since good-paying jobs typically attract numerous applicants (especially in hard economic times), poor credit or a criminal conviction are perfect tie-breakers to sort out applicants. There are also supervision costs associated with monitoring employees with troubled backgrounds. {snip} To prohibit background checks is just one more attack on business.</p>
<p>Ironically, banning background checks may exacerbate black unemployment. If an employer has inadequate information about a prospective hire, he or she is forced to use crude proxies, and race is a convenient, clear-cut proxy. So rather than risk hiring an ex-felon or chronic deadbeat, stick to whites or Asians. In fact, one study of this relationship found that employers were more likely to hire black males where they could perform background checks on past criminality. In other words, since most blacks have clean records, these &#8220;helpful&#8221; prohibitions were a liability for those who might otherwise be hired. </p>
<p>This ill-advised &#8220;help&#8221; is just one of many similar unhelpful government interventions. Prohibiting background checks only adds to an already heavy employer burden whose unintended impact is to price many blacks out of the job market. After all, what employer wants employees who can so easily sue for discrimination, real or imagined, on so many grounds (see here)? Similarly, why hire somebody whose educational credentials are less than bona fide thanks to government pressure on schools to &#8220;make the number&#8221; or admit unqualified applicants so as to redress historical inequalities  &mdash;  and then prohibit the employer from independently testing job applicants if whites are likely to outscore blacks despite comparable credentials? Or why hire somebody who has been endlessly instructed that America is hopelessly racist and that this racism must be exposed? No wonder that as private employment grows more competitive and employers have better choices, government itself has increasingly become the chief employer of blacks, since it lacks rivals with a superior workforce (see here, for example).</p>
<p>{snip} In their [many &#8220;friends&#8221; of unemployed blacks] mistaken view, help is just a matter of upping the pressure on white employers. Yet, faced with edicts to hire blacks they are loath to hire, a firm might relocate to largely whites areas, increase automation, hire subcontractors immune to government mandates, eliminate or sell portions of the business, hire off the books and pay in cash, or outsource tasks overseas. These actions are, of course, increasingly commonplace and perfectly legal, and each may well contribute to the intractability of black unemployment. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, champions of boosting black employment refuse to acknowledge these avoidance strategies. They remain stuck in the white prejudice explanation and ignore the sound reasons behind these dreadful unemployment figures (see here). So rather than counsel blacks on how to use credit prudently, these &#8220;friends&#8221; attempt to create a fantasy world where employers cannot check troubled credit histories. {snip}<br>

<p>Then the EEOC will bang you for that.  Even before the EEOC, then top level suits for the corporation (if this is a big corporation) will throw out the hiring results out of fear of the civil rights hustlers and the EEOC.</p>
<p><i>Similarly, why hire somebody whose educational credentials are less than bona fide thanks to government pressure on schools to &ldquo;make the number&rdquo; or admit unqualified applicants so as to redress historical inequalities &mdash; and then prohibit the employer from independently testing job applicants if whites are likely to outscore blacks despite comparable credentials?</i></p>
<p>Several days ago, an AR poster posited the theory that, because of AA in education, just having a college degree will no longer be enough, because blacks are getting degrees handed to them like candy.  Therefore, employers will use the proxy of looking at course transcripts, to check that challenging courses and decent grades for those courses (e.g. math) are on them.  After all, a C in Calculus III is harder to come by than an A in Black Studies 101.</p>
<p>As for the Kaplan suit, I have a challenge to President Obama   &mdash;   Order the Secret Service&rsquo;s hiring policies to be the same as whatever he wants Kaplan&rsquo;s to be.<br>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a large manufacturer in my home town that uses the following screening procedure:  New hires are placed on a 90 day probation.  During that time, if the new hire is even so much as 1 minute late, no matter the reason, they are fired.  It&rsquo;s a remarkably effective tool for screen out blacks and it has withstood numerous &#8220;scrimination&#8221; attacks.  It does have some unintended consequences:  People have been fired because they went into labor or were in serious car accidents.  But it&rsquo;s a needed tool.  The government is forcing businesses&rsquo; hand.</p>

		<p>I can attest to the difficulty in hiring young black people in major urban zones.  I have worked with black youth for almost ten years now.  While there are a few nice young black men and women out there, that I would give jobs to if I were an employer, the overwhleming majority are into that hip hip/gangsta rap lifestyle that makes them completely unemployable.</p>

		<p>Another sterling, if altogether familiar, example of just how much of a &#8220;strength&#8221; the elitists&rsquo; beloved &#8220;diversity&#8221; relaly is! This is PROOF POSITIVE that no matter what Whites do, no matter what extremes are gone to to &#8220;equalize&#8221; the races, the results are always the same. Blacks are a net drain on a White society - this is incontrovertable proof.</p>

<p>Course transcripts do not reveal false passing grades given to<br>
blacks in order to meet AA quotas which almost every school has.</p>
<p>Also&hellip;.if there has ever been a black who received a C in calculus III he would be quite an anomaly I imagine. There&rsquo;s no way PC grading could fake that.  There are probably a wee handful globally, but I&rsquo;ve never known one.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to get my big bucks from Kaplan Higher Education Corporation. &#8220;The EEOC demands that Kaplan pay me ten months of back wages and benefits for work that I haven&rsquo;t done for them (as they decided not to hire me) even though my credit record is squeeky clean.&#8221;</p>
<p>I love the &#8216;increasing automation&rsquo; part. I want one of those new carpet sweeping robots that never breaks the broom or wants time off for funerals.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Blacks only get A&rsquo;s most of the time because more than 90% of them cheat on every exam they take. I scrutinise black credentials and examine and test myself, especially when it comes to the sciences like engineering, etc.</p>

<p>Yeah, just what businesses need, more government threats, regulations and interference.</p>
<p>Has government meddling ever been beneficial to any business?</p>
<p>What this EEOC-backed demand will do is (in the words of John Stossel) <i>turn so-called protected people into potential lawsuits.</i></p>
<p>This too will backfire as did the Americans with Disabilities Act which <i>increased</i> unemployment among the disabled by 12% as employers worried about expensive, mandated modifications to their businesses to accommodate the disabled and worried about lawsuits should they need to fire someone with a disability.  Easier not to hire them in the first place.</p>
<p>Politicians fall all over each other to appear &#8220;compassionate&#8221; but Legislation mandating Compassion never produces the intended results the politicians promise.</p>
<p>But what should the politicians care?  How many of them who make up these stupid, unnatural laws they foist on businesses have ever had to meet a payroll?  Balance a businesses&rsquo; books?  Faced down EEOC accusations or racism?  Had to carry non-productive, troublesome, non-White employees for fear of litigation?<br>
 <br>
<i>In job-rich Manhattan, only one in four young (16-24) black males was employed in 2010.</i></p>
<p>I am not surprised.  Black males hook up with females who are able to procure Section 8 housing and government-funded EBT cards that can be used to extract cash and are accepted at liquor stores all over town.  When the female throws him out, he&rsquo;ll go live with his mother or grandmother for a while until he hooks up with another welfare queen.</p>
<p>Why work?</p>

		<p>Outsourcing as a solution to U.S. businesses personnel problems: Yes! This will work fine.<br>
    In the late 1980s there was a big push in metropolitan areas to bring large amounts of Blacks into low level clerical work. Suddenly all the file clerks, mail room people, customer service representatives, and billing dept jobs were held by Blacks. I remember calling up the power company about some simple problem and not being able to understand the Ebonic-speaking clerk. When I said, &#8220;Ma&rsquo;am, I can&rsquo;t understand a word out of your mouth.&#8221; She laughed and laughed. There was also a famous case of a mail room clerk who couldn&rsquo;t read or write  &mdash;  -he filed by using the first letter of a word ideographically.  <br>
    Now because these Blacks couldn&rsquo;t or wouldn&rsquo;t do the work, all these jobs are in India. They speak very good English, are intelligent and knowledgeable, and they get the work done. <br>

		<p>Deadbeats tend to vote democrat, it&rsquo;s easier than working. Why hire someone who at the drop of a hat would sue you for racial discrimination? Ponder this: When dealing with dangerous animals in their natural environment you should not feed them, due to the fact that when the food runs out they may eat you. Welfare is here to stay, just for this very reason.</p>
