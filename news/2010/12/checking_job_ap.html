<h1><a href="http://www.credit.com/blog/2010/12/checking-job-applicants-credit-discriminates-feds-say/">Checking Job Applicants&rsquo; Credit Discriminates, Feds Say</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christopher Maag, Creditbloggers, December 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The federal government sued Kaplan Higher Education, one of the nation&rsquo;s largest providers of for-profit education, for allegedly discriminating against African-Americans by using credit scores to weed out job applicants.</p>
<p>{snip} About 60% of American companies check credit scores for at least some job applicants, according to a recent study by the Society for Human Resource Management. More companies are performing such checks now that high unemployment rates from the recession leave more people applying for fewer jobs.</p>
<p>The practice is discriminatory, the EEOC alleges, because African-Americans have disproportionately lower credit scores than whites, the EEOC alleges.</p>
<p>&#8220;Employers need to be mindful that any hiring practice be job-related and not screen out groups of people, even if it does so unintentionally,&#8221; the commission said in a press release.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The lawsuit will hinge on two questions, says Mathew W. Finkin, director of the comparative labor and employment law &amp; policy program at the University of Illinois. First, the EEOC must prove that the policy of checking applicants&rsquo; credit scores has a &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; African-Americans.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s largely a question of demography, Finkin says: Do the statistics support the fact that blacks have markedly lower credit scores than whites? According to a Federal Reserve report, the average credit score for an African-American consumer is less than half the average score of a white consumer.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no question that African American and Latino applicants fare worse than white applicants when credit histories are considered for job applications,&#8221; Chi Chi Wu, a lawyer for the National Consumer Law Center, said in testimony before the EEOC in October.</p>
<p>The same test has been used before. Because African-Americans are more likely to be arrested than whites, the EEOC has shown that screening job applicants by arrest records has a disparate impact on blacks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If the government clears that hurdle, next it falls on Kaplan to prove that, while its practice may be discriminatory, it has legitimate business reasons to do it anyway. Employers have argued that a credit check is a legitimate part of determining an applicant&rsquo;s qualifications, especially for workers involved in finances and corporate leadership.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In addition to potentially far-reaching impacts of the lawsuit for the nation&rsquo;s 15 million unemployed people, the lawsuit could cause problems for the Washington Post, {snip}. Kaplan has been an important source of profit for the company as the newspaper has faltered in recent years, according to reporting by the Post.</p>

		<p>In other versions of this story, the main meat of the EEOC&rsquo;s case against Kaplan is that the credit ratings agencies don&rsquo;t differentiate between &#8220;can&rsquo;t&#8221; pay a bill (due to unemployment, hardship) and &#8220;won&rsquo;t&#8221; pay a bill.  I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s true, because most utilities don&rsquo;t rat on your late or missed payments to the credit ratings agencies if you make payment arrangements or at least let them know of your circumstances.</p>
<p>Ironically, there are some gun grabber groups who want to make being in arrears on certain court- or law-ordered payments (eg child support) as a reason why one shouldn&rsquo;t be able to own or possess firearms.  Obama&rsquo;s DOJ has nothing to say about that.</p>

		<p>That private agency that looks at the background of applicants only looks normally at three things:</p>
<p>* Credit reference.<br>
* DMV record.<br>
* Local police rap sheet.</p>
<p>Nothing more than that. Companies are forbidden by law to do a more extensive background check. A former employer is forbidden to say other than the applicant at one time worked at their business.</p>

		<p>I recall ten years ago when blacks complained they were being locked out of housing by lending institutions.</p>
<p>Now they complain that blacks who were granted home loans were victims of &#8220;predatory lending.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps they would do better in Zimbabwe, Nigeria or Haiti where white discrimination is not an issue. </p>

		<p>The EEOC&rsquo;s attempt secure more jobs for minorities by barring employers from checking &#8220;credit history&#8221;   &mdash;  - because credit scores have a &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; on minorities   &mdash;  - is analogous to the federal government&rsquo;s efforts in recent decades to secure more homes for minorities by attacking traditional lending standards.</p>
<p>One major rationale for government interference in the home lending market was alleged racial discrimination in lending as supposedly revealed by a famous 1992 Boston Fed study.  The study was later debunked by four different sets of researchers. See timeline below:</p>
<p>1992 - July - A Federal Reserve Bank of Boston study indicates that &ldquo;even after controlling for financial, employment, and neighborhood characteristics, black and Hispanic mortgage applicants in the Boston metropolitan area are roughly 60 percent more likely to be turned down than whites.&rdquo; The study suggests racism is behind the higher loan denial rate.</p>
<p>1993 - Forbes Magazine queries Boston Fed Senior Vice President and Research Director Alicia H. Munnell on the default rates of black and white mortgage holders in the Boston Fed&rsquo;s 1992 study purporting to show that racism is behind the higher loan denial rate for blacks.  The reporters learn that default rates on loans of whites and minorities are equal. This indicates no discrimination, they point out to Munnell.  &ldquo;[That] is a sophisticated point,&rdquo; she replies. &ldquo;You need that [lower default rates for blacks] as a confirming piece of evidence. And we don&rsquo;t have it.&rdquo;<br>
Forbes: Did you ever ask the question that if defaults appear to be more or less the same among blacks and whites, that points to mortgage lenders making rational decisions?<br>
Munnell: No &hellip; I do believe that discrimination occurs.<br>
Forbes: You have no evidence?<br>
Munnell: I do not have evidence &hellip; No one has evidence. (1)</p>
<p>1996 - A study by the  Federal Reserve System and academic specialists finds  &mdash;  like the 1993 Forbes investigation  &mdash;  no evidence &ldquo;of substantial levels of bias in mortgage lending.&rdquo; Quoting from the abstract of the study:<br>
&ldquo;Results of the analysis fail to find evidence of better performance on loans granted to minority borrowers. Indeed, black borrowers are found, all else being equal, to exhibit a higher likelihood of mortgage default than other borrowers. These findings argue against allegations of substantial levels of bias in mortgage lending.&rdquo; </p>
<p>1998 - October - Economists Stan L. Liebowitz and Theodore Day investigate the 1992 Boston Fed study suggesting racism in the mortgage market. They are &ldquo;shocked at the poor quality&rdquo; of the the data: <br>
&lsquo;&ldquo;When we attempted to conduct a statistical analysis removing the impact of &hellip; obvious data errors, we found that the evidence of discrimination vanished. Without discrimination there would be no reason to try to &lsquo;fix&rsquo; the mortgage market. Nevertheless, our work largely evaporated down the memory hole as government regulators got busy putting the results of the Boston Fed study to use in creating policy. That policy, simply put, was to weaken underwriting standards.&rdquo;<br>
The two economists warn: Bad loans today will mean dispossessed minorities tomorrow: <br>
&ldquo;After the warm and fuzzy glow of &lsquo;flexible underwriting standards&rsquo; has worn off, we may discover that they are nothing more than standards that led to bad loans &hellip; If this is the case, current policy will not have helped its intended beneficiaries if in future years they are dispossessed from their homes due to an inability to make their mortgage payments.&rdquo; (2)</p>
<p>1999 - Finance  professors at the University of Illinois and at Wichita State University disclose findings on the creditworthiness of minorities consistent with the 1993 Forbes report, the 1996 Federal Reserve study cited earlier, and the 1998 findings of Liebowitz and Day:<br>
&ldquo;[E]verything else being the same, minority applicants are probably less creditworthy, on average, than whites. Therefore, in the absence of fair lending laws, it is likely that minorities would be denied loans more frequently than whites and would pay higher interest rates and fees on approved loans &hellip;  [F]air-lending laws have the perverse effect of forcing lenders to cross-subsidize minority borrowers from the higher profits they earn on white borrowers. Such cross-subsidization is inherently &lsquo;unfair&rsquo; because it works as a tax on one group that is used as a subsidy for another.&rdquo; </p>

2) &ldquo;Mortgage Lending to Minorities: Where&rsquo;s the Bias?&rdquo; by Theodore Day and Stan J. Liebowitz. Economic Inquiry, January 1998): 1–27.</p>
<p>COMMENT: Just as the Boston Fed&rsquo;s profoundly flawed study would lead to the relaxed lending practices that resulted in millions of very bad loans, the EEOC&rsquo;s attack on hiring standards, if fully implemented, is likely to lead to millions of very bad hires.</p>

		<p>Diversity means we are different.  But when different is not positive it is prohibited.  <br>
The issue with credit scores, are they predictive or relevant to job performance?   Is it illogical to assume a individuals with poor credit may have poor personal management skills.  I work in a heavily hispanic area. I am amazed at the personal assumption and just bad choices financial choices this group makes.  </p>

		<p>Interesting commentary.  As a recently retired small businessman I made it a part of the employee application process to run a routine credit check on all applicants, simply because credit bureau scores are a well-known means of determining an individual&rsquo;s reliability and sense of personal responsibility.  Unless there were legitimate explanations for low bureau scores (recent divorce, illness, loss of income for possibly legitimate reasons, etc.) I rarely hired people with low credit scores, and in the few instances in which I made exceptions I usually came to regret it.</p>
<p>Poor habits in financial management almost invariably were reflected in poor job performance.  Though many such people clearly had the talent and ability to perform adequately, they rarely did, and in some cases displayed outright dishonesty.  It&rsquo;s no surprise that many more blacks than whites or members of Asian groups fell into this category. This fact is known to all employers, large and small.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really that simple.</p>

		<p>I was a loan officer for many years, and read thousands of credit reports.  Blacks have worse credit for 2 reasons:  </p>
<p>1)  They rack up far more debt than whites with equal incomes, known as the debt-to-income ratio.  The stereotype about blacks being big spenders is true.  </p>
<p>2)  They&rsquo;re sloppier about paying bills than whites.  Many blacks think being days or weeks late on bills is no big deal, and as long as they pay it <b>eventually</b> it shouldn&rsquo;t be held against them.  I&rsquo;ve been called &#8220;rude&#8221; multiple times for asking blacks to pay by the due date.  </p>
<p>Blacks are not conscientious or responsible money managers.  They blow all their money on expensive cars and consumer goods, even high-income blacks.  </p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t save money for emergencies, either.  Black women with decent jobs spend huge amounts of money on deadbeat boyfriends and adult children, then don&rsquo;t have money to fix their cars or cover sudden expenses.  The future doesn&rsquo;t really exist for most blacks, except for bizarrely optimistic dreams of future riches (with no plan to get there).   </p>
<p>Above all, black think white <i>live just like them</i>, but whites magically cover up their problems using various racial conspiracies.  Blacks refuse to believe their behavior has anything to due with their bad life outcomes.  <br>

		<p>My husband and I have overcome bad credit, he had sterling credit but had a business fail, I went through a divorce and it took me years to get back on my feet. After the respective bankrupcies we waited a couple of years to try to get a house which took us a couple of years to get our ratings back to even the minimal rate. We were told by a mortgate broker friend that if we had been black or hispanic we would have gotten a house the first time we had tried. After a couple of years of hardship we got our mortgage and now have credit scores over 700. It has been a long road but well worth it. It is a hard fact that the credit bureaus do not differentiate between can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t pay bills but if you at least try to make the effort to pay what you owe you will come out better. I think that most blacks and hispanics are still in the &#8220;live in the moment&#8221; stage that most of us outgrew after about age 21. In my working class neighborhood almost all of the hispanics (almost no blacks in our section of the city) have very late model SUVs with flashy rims and loud stereo systems. Most white residents have older cars without all the bells and whistles. Most people get into credit problems want all the toys when they are right out of high school or college and wonder where all their money went. </p>

		<p>Coming back to the subject of guns brought up in post #1, I noticed an interesting article in my local controlled media newspaper. A black woman&rsquo;s house had been burglarized, and among other things, her guns had been stolen. What was interesting was that gun ownership was portrayed by the controlled media article as perfectly reasonable and normal - for her.</p>
<p>You will never see anything from the controlled media that portrays gun ownership as reasonable and normal for white men and women. Any white person who owns firearms is automatically portrayed as a &#8220;bitter clinger&#8221;, a &#8220;militia member&#8221;, and of course a &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Obama Administration&rsquo;s motto seems to be &#8220;Guns for the Bantu, none for the Honky.&#8221;</p>

		<p>One of my co-workers for a part time job is 19. This kid is in hock to both the insurance company and the bank for his &#8220;sports car&#8221;. What I pay for 6 months of insurance is his monthly bill. To a degree, he is still in the stage of &#8220;magical thinking&#8221;. He is white and I hope he will grow out of it. I wonder how long he will try burning the candle at both ends before he realizes that one must live within their means. My car at age 18 was an old Volkswagen, not something like a 1984 Oldsmobile Cutlass with all the bells and whistles. </p>
<p>Here in the Indianapolis radio market, Dave Ramsey is on from 12 - 3. Yes, there are the occasional hard luck stories, but most of his callers have not gotten a hold of their finances and now need to clean up a mess. I can&rsquo;t listen to it all of the time, but it sounds like 95% of the callers are white and realize that now is the time for action. I&rsquo;m sure that telling a minority that the new SUV, the pimped out clothes, and the expensive liquor has to go is not what they want to hear. </p>
<p>My co-worker doesn&rsquo;t seem to understand that people in their 40&rsquo;s tend to be wealthier than teenagers. If &#8220;Hunter&#8221; were &#8220;DeVonte&#8221;, I&rsquo;m sure that a racism charge would be forthcoming. </p>

Lysenkoism is used colloquially to describe the manipulation or distortion of the scientific process as a way to reach a predetermined conclusion as dictated by an ideological bias, often related to social or political objective.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>In 1928, Trofim Lysenko, a previously unknown agronomist, claimed to have developed an agricultural technique, termed vernalization, which tripled or quadrupled crop yield by exposing wheat seed to high humidity and low temperature. While cold and moisture exposure are a normal part of the life cycle of fall-seeded winter cereals, the vernalization technique claimed to enhance yields by increasing the intensity of exposure, in some cases planting soaked seeds directly into the snow cover of frozen fields. In reality, the technique was neither new (it had been known since 1854, and was extensively studied during the previous twenty years), nor did it produce the yields he promised.</p>
<p>When Lysenko began his fieldwork in the Soviet Union of the 1930s, the agriculture of the Soviet Union was in a massive crisis due to the forced collectivization movement.</p>
<p>Many agronomists were educated before the revolution, and even many of those educated afterwards did not agree with the collectivization policies. Furthermore, among biologists of the day, the most popular topic was not agriculture at all, but the new genetics that was emerging out of studies of Drosophila melanogaster, commonly known as fruit flies. Drosophilidae fruit flies made experimental verification of genetics theories, such as Mendelian ratios and heritability, much easier. Only much later would this research have obvious application to the problem of agriculture, so during the 1920s and 1930s it was easy for a radical like Lysenko to castigate these theoretical biologists for spending their time bent over trays of fruit flies while famine raged on around them.</p>
<p>Isaak Izrailevich Prezent, a main Lysenko theorist, presented Lysenko in Soviet mass-media as a genius who had developed a new, revolutionary agricultural technique. In this period, Soviet propaganda often focused on inspirational stories of peasants who, through their own canny ability and intelligence, came up with solutions to practical problems. Lysenko&rsquo;s widespread popularity provided him a platform to denounce theoretical genetics and to promote his own agricultural practices. He was, in turn, supported by the Soviet propaganda machine, which overstated his successes and omitted mention of his failures. Instead of performing controlled experiments, Lysenko claimed that vernalization increased wheat yields by 15%, solely based upon questionnaires taken of farmers.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysenkoism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysenkoism</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not suggesting &#8216;vernalization of minorities&rsquo; is the required solution for equal opportunity among all members of society.</p>
<p>Rather I think Lysenkoism represents that innate desire to find a way to cheat the truth by hyping specific statistics without real proof.  Not for idealized realization of social agendas.  But rather direct profit.</p>
<p>The question then becomes: Who is doing the hyping (as a function of how smart they are) and who is going along with it (ditto) as a function of what agenda.</p>
<p>The Loan Lending Market bust made a lot of hedgefund operators wealthy selling junk loads overseas at &#8216;AAA rating&rsquo; and the bubble bust also is allowing peope with reserve capital to buy up property at incredibly discounted rates now.</p>
<p>We have seen this cycle of engineered collapse and reorchestration of property as currency market values before&hellip;</p>
