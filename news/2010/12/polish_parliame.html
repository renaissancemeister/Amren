<h1>Polish Parliament Gets Its 1st African Lawmaker</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Washington Post, December 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Poland&rsquo;s parliament is getting its first ever African lawmaker, a teacher and Christian pastor from Nigeria who has lived in Poland for 17 years and proven himself a popular local leader.</p>
<p>John Abraham Godson is a councilman in the central city of Lodz. The 40-year-old will fill a seat in the national parliament vacated by a fellow lawmaker from the Civic Platform party.</p>
<p>That lawmaker, Hanna Zdanowska, was elected mayor of Lodz on Sunday. Godson was her runner-up in the 2007 parliamentary elections.</p>
<p>He said Monday that he feels honored and believes it is a &#8220;historic moment&#8221; for Poland. As a lawmaker he plans to support technological innovation in Poland and bolster ties with Africa.</p>
<p>His swearing-in is expected in the coming weeks.<br>

<p>Just what Poland needs.  Where&rsquo;s the Polish mayor of Lagos?</p>
<p>Nigeria is the eight most populous country in the world and the largest concentration of blacks of any nation in the world.  Wikipedia even says that the culture is ethnocentric.  </p>
<p>My guess is that Nigeria is looking for a population valve in exchange for natural resource supplies, such as oil and minerals.  Blacks have been invading Poland for years now, and I&rsquo;ve read a few stories about the usual poor black behavior there, but the government and the Christian culture refuses to realize the danger to their indigenous survival, like most Western, white nations and cultures.</p>

		<p>The Civic Platform is a pseudo center-right party, kind of like the republicans here. This African was placed in the parliament via party list without anybody actually voting for him.</p>

		<p>My God&hellip;Europe just can&rsquo;t help act out it&rsquo;s irrational self hatred.<br>
I thought Eastern Europe was safe, but apparently I&rsquo;m wrong.<br>
I guess no one in Poland has paid attention to what&rsquo;s been going on in France, the U.K. and the Netherlands for the past 40 years.<br>
The west is doomed.</p>

		<p>So THIS is what millions of Poles fought and died for through the ages.<br>
So THIS is a proximate result of the action that kicked off WW2 and resulted in the appalling sacrifice  of tens of milions ie the decision of Britain and France to defend Polish independence.</p>

		<p>I looked at the video that post #2 had a link to. The first comment (when I visited) was by a youtube user named &#8220;GoldRing09&#8221; and read: &#8220;Watching things like this gives me hope in the human race. Just look at those beautiful, healthy looking children. There&rsquo;s just something about mixed race children that makes them better looking than say the average non-mixed child. I see the wonders of multiculturalism and﻿ mixed race offspring here﻿ in London England everyday, but Poland? There truly is a God. May the Black man continue to implant his sead in the White woman all across Europe. Soon most of Europe will be brown, god willing.&#8221;</p>
<p>I thought they didn&rsquo;t say these things out loud? What has made them more confident recently?</p>

		<p>  It pains me to see Poland go down the same cul-de-sac as Western Europe. I had hoped that the madness of multi-culturalism hadn&rsquo;t penetrated that far East. They should look at France, Holland and formerly Great Britain. Do those types of diverse, multi-racial countries really look good to them?</p>

		<p>I remember reading a while ago an article about how Poland had very few nonwhites, and of course the article seemed to view this as some sort of problem for that country.</p>
<p>Looks like the globalists took this seriously and are hard at work selling the &#8216;benefits&rsquo; of diversity to the Polish people.</p>
<p>The more important question is, who are the globalists, and what is their real agenda. If we can&rsquo;t be honest about this, then we really are just wasting our time.</p>

		<p>Polish borders are more open than the U.S. border with Mexico. There is no mechanism to deport any invading 3rd worlders. Any serious public discussion of the problem in Poland is banned because of what the Germans did to Jews over half a century ago. In a few years we&rsquo;ll have gettos, black crime, halal food, riots, quotas, etc. just like in France, Britain, or the Netherlands. Yep, we are finally catching up to Europe.</p>

		<p>The best thing about Poland is that it is in no way, whatsoever, even historically tied to the continent of Africa. It never had colonies, so they can&rsquo;t play the colonial guilt card, and they never had a black slave population, so they don&rsquo;t have any black natives of their country. WHY, then, would they deliberately seek to &#8220;bolster ties with Africa&#8221;?</p>

<p>Then again, it says &#8220;gets&#8221; not &#8220;elects&#8221;. Was he appointed, rather than elected, somehow? It would be consistent with the fact that while the masses of native Europeans tend to have pretty good sense concerning immigration, their elites (especially in the Europian Union Suicide Pact) are devoted to utter insanity on the issue.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m speaking from 20 years ago, when I visited Eastern Europe, tho not Poland&hellip; I think they see the same internationals news we do. Blacks world-wide are victims of oppression (and never oppressors of whites in their own countries or when they live abroad). So black is at least a little bit hip. It was as if they wanted some of their own. I have my own opinion of what Africans there wanted&hellip; Plus, this was during the days of communism. The Soviet Union tried to build solidarity with &#8216;oppressed&rsquo; groups, at least on paper. I would have guessed their population was well below 1% (tho perhaps not in cities). The population often seemed as tho student-aged. <br>

		<p>To Georgia Resident:</p>
<p>True, Poland didn&rsquo;t have any African colonies, or practice slavery against blacks  - however, it was a Warsaw Pact nation in the Soviet orbit during the days of communism, so it had to (on paper at least) support the Soviet view on things like African independence struggles and Vietnam.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet this guy is going to try to settle Nigerian nationals into Poland, especially after the next round of Nigerian bloodletting. Those Nigerian nationals will most likely be Muslim, who will demand sharia law in a country with a strong Catholic tradition. Then the fun will begin. </p>

<p>Beautiful, healthy looking children? Ha! To him, maybe. Isn&rsquo;t it amazing how people like this GoldRing are the first to criticize White people for &#8220;racism&#8221; yet have no problem admitting that they would like to see &#8220;brown&#8221; people all over Europe, in effect calling for Black Supremacy over non-Black countries and the elimination of Whites as a distinct race? He sounds like someone who is envious of Whites and would like to see the elimination of the source of his envy.</p>

<p>So what?  That won&rsquo;t stop them. They&rsquo;ll just find ANOTHER excuse. No problem!  </p>
<p><i>WHY, then, would they deliberately seek to &ldquo;bolster ties with Africa&rdquo;?</i></p>
<p>Because Poles have been deprived of the vibrance and  cultural enrichment of multi-racialism.  Poor things!  How did they manage without blacks all this time? </p>
<p>That will have to be changed.<br>
Never fear!   It&rsquo;s being worked on.</p>

<p>I think Escape V. has got it exactly right.  I have seen the very same thing. Yes, that image of an abused, oppressed race still lingers on and does its work.</p>
<p>I am writing from Chile, where one sees hardly any blacks (except a few foreign ones,  generally Americans). The same pattern exists here.    </p>
<p>Of course, Chileans know black sports stars and musicians and celebs from television and print media.  I have seen blacks approached on the street by friendly Chileans who are eager to talk to them and shake their hands.  They are treated like heroes!   It&rsquo;s like these brave, wonderful blacks are being congratulated for having survived so much abuse and oppression (at least according to all TV and movie portrayals, which are all that Chileans know).    Such a patient, wise, admirable race of  people to have endured so much suffering  and still be fountains of enlightenment and kindness!   How wonderful!   </p>
<p>What country would  not want to get some blacks of its own to enrich its culture and invigorate its population?</p>
<p>(Too bad the Chileans don&rsquo;t show an equal concern for their indigenous Indians, who are neglected nonentities.  Well, the South American Indians don&rsquo;t have a Hollywood propaganda industry boosting them, telling the world how wonderful they are.   What a difference propaganda makes!)</p>
