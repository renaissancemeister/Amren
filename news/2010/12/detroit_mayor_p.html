			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike &ldquo;Mish&rdquo; Shedlock, Global Ecnoomic Analysis, December 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Detroit has been bankrupt for years. It simply refuses to admit it. Detroit&rsquo;s schools are bankrupt as well. A mere 25% of students graduate from high school.</p>
<p>Yet, in spite of hints and threats from mayors and budget commissions, and in spite of common sense talk of bankruptcy, Detroit has not pulled the bankruptcy trigger.</p>
<p>In a futile attempt to stave off the inevitable one last time, Mayor Bing&rsquo;s latest plan is to cutoff city services including road repairs, police patrols, street lights, and garbage collection in 20% of Detroit.</p>
<p><b>Bing to Cede 20% of Detroit to Gangs and Homeless</b></p>
<p>City officials suggest this will not shrink the size of the city. Perhaps it won&rsquo;t shrink Detroit on Google Maps. However, Bing&rsquo;s plan would effectively surrender 20% of the city to gangs and the homeless.</p>
<p>Would you want to live in one of the gang war-zones that his plan would create? Would you want to live in a bordering neighborhood or in a bordering city?</p>
<p>Regardless of your answer, Bing&rsquo;s plan cannot and will not work and I believe Detroit will, sometime in 2011, file for bankruptcy. If so, expect massive turmoil in municipal bonds.</p>
<p><b>Less Than a Full-Service City</b></p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal discusses Bing&rsquo;s plan in Less Than a Full-Service City</p>
<p>More than 20% of Detroit&rsquo;s 139 square miles could go without key municipal services under a new plan being developed for the city, with as few as seven neighborhoods seen as meriting the city&rsquo;s full resources.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Bing&rsquo;s staff wants to concentrate Detroit&rsquo;s remaining population  &mdash;  expected to be less than 900,000 after this year&rsquo;s Census count  &mdash;  and limited local, state and federal dollars in the most viable swaths of the city, while other sectors could go without such services as garbage pickup, police patrols, road repair and street lights.</p>
<p>Karla Henderson, a city planning official leading the mayor&rsquo;s campaign, said in an interview Thursday that her staff had deemed just seven to nine sections of Detroit worthy of receiving the city&rsquo;s full resources. She declined to identify the areas, but said the final plan could include a greater number.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Repurpose or Abandon?</b></p>
<p>Of course the Mayor&rsquo;s office did not say they would abandon sections of the city to gangs. But how the hell can repurposing as described above possibly mean anything else?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s next? Barbed wire? Oh wait a minute, Detroit already has tried that. Razor-wire too.</p>
<p><b>Detroit&rsquo;s Tax Collection Process</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><br>
The City of Detroit has failed for nearly four years to send property tax bills to the owner of the Packard plant, costing the city badly needed cash.</p>
<p>At 3.5 million square feet, the plant is by far the largest derelict property in Detroit.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until the Free Press began making inquiries last week that the city&rsquo;s assessor&rsquo;s office returned the property to the tax rolls  &mdash;  with an assessed value of nearly $1.6 million. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Robin Boyle, professor of urban planning at Wayne State University, said the error underscores &#8220;just how challenged the city is in dealing with the fundamental task of title, control, oversight and follow-through&#8221; with property throughout the city.</p>
<p>&#8220;To me, that is a fundamental problem that leaves Detroit in a consistently weakened position. It can&rsquo;t even do the basics,&#8221; Boyle said. &#8220;This is a huge piece of real estate, and yet, there&rsquo;s still confusion.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Detroit Schools Bankrupt</b></p>
<p>Flashback July 24,2009: The Wall Street Journal reports Detroit&rsquo;s Schools Are Going Bankrupt, Too</p>
<p>Now&rsquo;s the time to cast off collective bargaining agreements and introduce school choice.</p>
<p>&#8216;Am I optimistic that they can avoid it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? I am not.&#8221; That&rsquo;s what retired judge Ray Graves said this week when asked whether the Detroit public schools, which he is advising, would be forced into bankruptcy. {snip}</p>
<p>As embarrassing as such a filing would be, it also may be the only thing that can force the kinds of changes Detroit schools need  &mdash;  as the financial turmoil is just the latest manifestation of a system in terminal decline.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>The Economic Base</b></p>
<p>The deterioration of the economic base of the city has accelerated. There were an estimated 81,754 vacant housing units (22.2 percent of the total) in Detroit before the recession; that number increased to an estimated 101,737 (27.8 percent of the total) in 2008.</p>
<p>The average price of a residential unit sold in the January through November, 2009 period was $12,439, down from $97,847 in 2003. Remaining businesses and individuals are challenging property tax assessments on parcels that have lost value and, in some cases, cannot be sold at any price.</p>
<p>More than half of employed city residents work outside the city limits; the metro area has the highest unemployment rate of the 100 major metro areas in the U.S.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Bing Still Pretends  &mdash;  How Long Can It Last?</b></p>
<p>For reasons unknown, Bing just cannot do what is right. He will not come flat out and say what everyone in their right mind knows  &mdash;  that Detroit is fiscally and morally bankrupt and so are its schools.</p>
<p>Instead, on December 10, 2010 Detroit, whose population has dropped by half since 1950, borrowed $100 million to turn the MGM Grand Casino&rsquo;s former site into a headquarters for the police, fire and emergency-services departments.</p>
<p>The city sold so-called Recovery Zone Bonds authorized under the U.S. economic-stimulus plan, borrowing at 4.55 percent, the city said in a press release today. The bonds, with the longest term maturing in 2035, were sold through the Michigan Finance Authority by investment banks led by Siebert Brandford Shank &amp; Co., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.</p>

		<p>It is not just Detroit, but they are one of the worst.  My city will also soon be out of money.  I don&rsquo;t care that they lay off the police, since I can always carry a gun (and do).  But I hate to see firemen laid off, since it&rsquo;s difficult to carry a fire-hose very well.</p>

		<p>The part about ceding territory to gangs is really profound.  I mean, if Detroit&rsquo;s city limit shrinks, then what will become of the territory that is suddenly not in a municipality?  The bordering suburbs wouldn&rsquo;t want it, because it&rsquo;s useless.  It would fall into Wayne County&rsquo;s hands, but I&rsquo;m sure Wayne County&rsquo;s budget isn&rsquo;t much better.</p>
<p>I have heard that municipal bonds is the next &#8220;big shoe&#8221; to drop in the American economy.  So many important people have so much money in them, that if Detroit going into B-court causes &#8220;turmoil in Munis,&#8221; as the article suggests, then this recession probably becomes a depression.</p>

		<p>The last time I went back to this city in which I was born and raised was about 18 months ago. I drove out a tank of gas just admiring the way Blacks had shaped the Motor City to reflect their tastes and culture. The people of Monrovia and Port-ah-Prince must be green with envy.</p>
<p>My estimate is that of the 139 square miles inside Detroit&rsquo;s city limits, there are probably around 35 square miles that are still in good shape and maybe another 15-20 square miles that are livable but in need of serious renovation.</p>
<p>The rest of the town needs a makeover by Caterpillar, which means that services could be cut to another 40% of the D without effecting the lives of a single human being.</p>

<p>For reasons &ldquo;unknown?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Please, the political &ldquo;realities&rdquo; of multiculturalism and diversity worship, have all the answers.</p>
<p>Please follow this:</p>
<p>1.) Detroit is a paradise on earth, the only such paradise without crime or financial problems;</p>
<p>2.) In 1967, the black &ldquo;liberation&rdquo; movement saw that this would happen and made sure of it.</p>
<p>To say otherwise, is racist.</p>

		<p>With the budget problems Colorado Springs has been experiencing, the city has, in the last year, shut off 1/3 of the city streetlights, eliminated the police helicopters (which were very useful for tracking the jerks who like to race at 100 mph on the city streets), and completely eliminated evening and weekend bus service.  One can only imagine the problems faced by places like Detroit, Camden, East St. Louis, etc. who have no middle-class white taxpayers to keep things running.</p>

		<p>An inherent flaw with democracy is that nearly all get to vote, but not all get to bear the costs.  Thus cities reach a &#8220;tipping point&#8221; where there are more voters in need than voters who create wealth inclusive of jobs and taxes paid.  Those wealth creators can no longer justify the heavily taxed diminished returns with the risk adjusted investment required.  They either go out of business or leave the city, further skewing the vote commanding balance to the tax takers against ever fewer tax providers.  State and Federal governments step in with gap filling monies, only to prolong the inevitable. And over time these transfer payments further serve to make the recipients more dependent on the government and less on their own dwindling capabilities.  Newark, Camden and Detroit are examples of this simple phenomena.  Businesses have left those cities, what remains are dependents without skills fully expecting state support.<br>
In parable form: Feed the birds all summer long and they wouldn&rsquo;t know how to forage for themselves.  And if the birds could vote, they&rsquo;d gladly vote for you to continue feeding them and their burgeoning prodigy forever, which would be until you could no longer afford to buy bird seed.  Now substitute birds with aggressive predators who expect that protein will be provided at their doorstep daily without fail.  And when you can no longer afford to feed them they look at you as the final source of protein.</p>

		<p>&#8220;What&rsquo;s next? Barbed wire? Oh wait a minute, Detroit already has tried that. Razor-wire too.&#8221;</p>
<p>If barbed wire were their only concerns it wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad.  But slowly reducing vital services and police to any urban area containing large populations of blacks and Hispanics means that they are in the beginning stages of low intensity conflict that is bound to evolve into violence and chaos on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Detroit will eventually be one of America&rsquo;s &#8220;no go zones,&#8221; before Los Angeles even.  Other cities will be following suit.</p>
<p>There are reports coming out constantly about reductions in police and services throughout the country.  As of today, 46 states are near desperation due to budget shortfalls that will reach crisis levels in the next few months.</p>
<p>While Detroit is probably worse than any California city, California is in far worse economic condition as a state than Michigan.  It will be interesting to see if California gets bailed out by the Feds, which it probably will, but how long will it continue on after that stimulus money runs out?</p>
<p>And then what?</p>

		<p>In an episode of &#8220;No Reservations&#8221; Anthony Bourdain bemoaned the fact that Detroit had &#8220;declined.&#8221; He asked &#8220;how could we let this great city decline?&#8221; The photos he showed of abandoned and decaying &#8220;once proud&#8221; edifices of Detroit could have been taken from a website I visited once that showed the absolute demise of Detroit from demographic decline. As much as I like watching Anthony Bourdain, I understand that he is a bleading heart liberal of the worst kind. I actually began to see, not understand, how leftists such as him could be so blind to the reality of our world.I can&rsquo;t imagine being raised in a household where you are constantly bombarded by egalitarian, leftist, socialist, and liberal ideologies - and not come out unscathed! </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve always hated Detroit roads.  About 25 years ago we lived in northern Oakland County, up near Pontiac, and were taking my paternal grandmother home to Detroit after Thanksgiving dinner.  We wound up hitting a HUGE pothole in the road, and we wound up with a flat on the Lodge Freeway  &mdash;  in one of the worst parts of town.</p>
<p>Never saw Dad change a tire so quickly!</p>
<p>Thankfully we were okay.  And we found out, after traveling a good 30 miles home, that another tire was ready to go as well!</p>
<p>I also hate taking I-75 or the Southfield Freeway through Detroit.  Potholes, potholes everywhere, last time I drove up there.</p>

		<p>You hate to say anything is beyond repair but Detroit is truly gone. It is imploding. You are watching the end of a city. Just extrapolate it out. Soon there will be no money left anywhere - none to borrow, none to steal, none to sue for. The remaining people will either kill each other off, die of starvation or homelessness or the diseases stemming from a failure of public health, or find their way out of the city to become dependents in a new state.</p>
<p>The buildings will crumble from looting and disrepair, the streets will be swallowed up by nature, and then there will be nothing.</p>
<p>I blame this in part on liberal whites - who set in motion this travesty. But the true destroyers of Detroit, those who must face the blame, are the black people - and the black officials - who did nothing to stop this because they are simply unable to function at a societal level beyond that of rural Africa, circa 15,000 BC.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re left with. Regression to rural Africa in North America. Really, what did you expect with black rule?</p>
<p>Now, what do we do to draw the line, to take our heritage back?        </p>

		<p>Detroit is a window into our national future, unless we reign in the obscene spending orgy, now going on in Washington DC. It is already a desolate &#8220;Mad Max&#8221; world in Detroit. Imagine how bad it will be when entire states like California and Illinois follow the same path as Detroit. Parts of Detroit are now being turned over to gangs. Imagine what it will be like when large regions of states like California are essentially run by warlords. As these major states fall, the nation won&rsquo;t be far behind. There will be small enclaves in the Mountain West and Midwest where common sense may prevail. These places, likely will be the only relatively safe areas to live in the entire country. It will be worse than the Great Depression of the 1930s &amp; 40s; because this time, such a large segment of the population has the entitlement mentality. They will still be expecting their handouts (even when there is nothing left to give); and when those handouts stop&hellip;there will be riots and other acts of violence on an unprecedented scale. Given the current insanity of our federal government; I think we have between 4-6 years before the bottom completely falls out.</p>

		<p>The planned shrinkage is actually a good idea.</p>
<p>There are large areas of Detroit that are essentially abandoned except for a few run down houses occupied by squatters and those on state assistance. </p>
<p>The city could save a lot of money by just moving those people into other areas and planting a forest or whatever on the abandoned areas. This will complete Detroit&rsquo;s total 360 from wilderness to industrial capitol to wilderness again. </p>

Given the current insanity of our federal government; I think we have between 4-6 years before the bottom completely falls out.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>I think that this is not quite the nothing-good condition that others see it as.  Or at least it could be taken as a final warning to get our affairs in order once we no longer have a national services network to depend on.</p>
<p>Some things to consider:</p>
<p>1.  A happy people is a peaceful people, no matter how inept or irrational they may seem.  So &#8216;entitlements&rsquo; are not necessarily a bad thing, provided they can be provided, en-masse, for no more price than the electrons on which they are served as a daily Circus &amp; Bread.</p>
<p>Food can certainly be issued cheaply when it has guaranteed scalar economics purchase amounts and _provided_ you bear an RFID chip which you &#8216;present as payment&rsquo; to an armored MacDonalds type delivery truck.</p>
<p>Want to eat?  Get sterilized the chip will be inserted under your skin.  Sound Orwellian?  It is.  But it is less cruel than being left to starve.</p>
<p>And less stupid than leaving not a few hundred or even several thousand souls wandering the byways of an America linked by roads.</p>
<p>But rather &#8216;allowing&rsquo; (because you cannot stop them) MILLIONS ON THE MOVE.</p>
<p>Hundreds and Thousands can have a Rourke&rsquo;s Drift solution.  Millions require WMD and an organized military means to target and delivery it.</p>
<p>2.  What if it&rsquo;s your city that is the next to fail?  Does the loss of electricity have to be so bad?  It&rsquo;s actually Chicago that is called &#8216;The Windy City&rsquo; but in my neck of the woods, &#8216;Saudi Aurora&rsquo;, the wind begins at night and summer or winter, _routinely_ blows at 40mph.  Probably more higher up where the light poles frequently sway in the gusts.</p>
<p>So take a flag pole, run up a wind turbine out of an armored housing on rope to catch a geared drive shaft at the top.  Make that turbine out of plastic and shape it in a helix like an old school barber shop sign to maximize capture area for length.</p>
<p>Put one each of these contraptions at each corner of a house.  And let them spin all night long.</p>
<p>You can then send the resulting electricity down a heavy duty extension cord to a pack of 10-20 lead acid car batteries in the basement.  It&rsquo;s cheap to build, it&rsquo;s free to use and even without networking to a common neighborhood storage unit, the most complicated part of it might be a transformation/rectification system that could equate to what every &#8216;emergency generator&rsquo; has as a standard.  </p>
<p>No, you might not get a full day&rsquo;s use out of a night&rsquo;s charging but you could run an electric stove and a space heater and a couple lightbulbs long enough to eat, read a book and keep a single room warm, once the night came again.</p>
<p>The same could be done with solar water purifiers made from aluminum foil and simple plastic barrels as rainwater catch basins.</p>
<p>And whatever services are lost, there MUST BE sewage collection, even if it&rsquo;s just a raised plastic septic tank that everyone empties their bed pans into and which another armored &#8216;honey wagon&rsquo; comes to drain, once a day.  Send that truck to a sludge processing plant where a ring of solar mirrors focus light on a capstone on a tower which in turn uses it&rsquo;s 2,500`F temperatures to deep-sterilized the waste into fuel pellets for either a power/purification plant.  Or for a gas powered truck similar to the wood gas powered vehicles that Germany used in WWII.</p>
<p>The alternative is not just outbreaks of contagion but the utter ruination of river water as high concentrations of ammonium, nitrates, phosphorus and high (PH7-8) alkaline content have the potential to raise algae and other other oxygen choking organisms which utterly ruin the water.</p>
<p>Again, people, this is not something that can be &#8216;survived, naturally&rsquo;, waiting for the inept to die off.  Because the inept can kill.  And in the months it takes them to eat each other and pillage the land until their luck runs out, they will so pollute it that the remainder will spend CENTURIES fixing things.  If ever.</p>
<p>If nothing else, think of it racially.  There are a lot of good, white, willing, workers out there who _will not_ survive this.  Because they have trained their whole lives to serve in an institutional labor environment where they depend on others to supply them the food and services necessary to sustain life in a modern environment.</p>
<p>And they just won&rsquo;t have time to convert.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to lose those _doctors, lawyers, engineers, and artists_.  Because &#8216;after the after&rsquo; will be a new beginning whose rebuilding phase will require every smark cookie we can summon to perform the miracle of rebirthing Western Society at more than a medieval level of enlightened understanding.</p>
<p>We could sure use to create the microinfrastructure replacement aids to help those folks out.  And someone could become very wealthy off of prestocking the necessary items because this same materiel will be required if a secession happens and whites go to festung isolation mode, also without federalized support from (denied coal or oil rail deliveries) powerplants and the like.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not sure people really understand what is going on in this next evolutionary step for Detroit.</p>
<p>Detroit is a perfect example of what happens when non-white communism is allowed free reign.  However, not all non-whites are equally problematical.</p>
<p>Detroit is borrowing a technique from various African countries to deal with the worst of the worst.  Creating a garbage can.  A no-go area devoid of cops, services and the rule of law.  Such areas have massive appeal for a certain segment of non-whites, as well as provide a place for those with nowhere left to go.  This is especially true of gangs, who will have an opportunity to rule these areas with an iron fist, now that any semblance of government has fled the area (a suspicious person might probe the extent to which they manipulated the situation to this end).  It provides the opportunity for a gang leader to become a warlord, essentially.</p>
<p>The bottom line is those areas aren&rsquo;t so much falling apart (I mean they are, but that is secondary).  Someone wants police, services, agents of government and all relatively normal people out of those areas.</p>
<p>Perhaps the next phase will be to cordon off these areas with ever increasing security.  Then forcibly dump those people there.  The movie Escape from New York becoming real life.</p>

		<p>Dave Bing is another of those ex-sports jocks who thought he would make a smooth transition into the political arena, a la Jack Kemp, Jim Bunning and Heath Schuler before him.</p>
<p>Up until now, the hardest thing Bing ever had to do was guard John Havlicek.</p>

		<p>Henry Ford didn&rsquo;t realize it at the time but he planted a time bomb in Detroit when he moved southern blacks in to compete with white gentile labor. What he didn&rsquo;t realize was that in 4 generations America would be deindustrialized and the blacks would plague the city in worse ways than ever before. </p>
<p>Races are not interchangeable and the Great Society prevented whites from forcing blacks into a cohesive workforce in which they would be forced to work. Therefore rob, rape, kill and steal is the norm. </p>

		<p>Poster #11 mentioned &#8220;Mad Max&#8221; as a possible future.  I could not agree more.  This is how I envision the future when all semblance of order breaks down in about 10-20 years.</p>
<p>By that time, Latinos and Blacks will have roving gangs who will rape and pillage the remaining fortified white areas.  Also, what do you think a million Somalis will be doing in 20 years here?  Playing nice and going to law school?</p>

<p><i>Mayor Bing&rsquo;s latest plan is to cutoff city services including road repairs, police patrols, street lights, and garbage collection in 20% of Detroit.</i></p>
<p>Detroit is already the most destroyed city in the entire USA.</p>
<p>How could anyone tell if garbage collection were cut off or not?  Take a look at this: </p>

<p>Road repairs? In the former Car Capital? Ha Ha!  The roads already look like this:  </p>

<p>Police Patrols?  Has it done any good after Detroit went through &#8216;The Change&rsquo;?  </p>

<p>Between 1950 and 2000:</p>
<p>Detroit&rsquo;s White population decreased 93%, from 1,545,847 to 116,599<br>
Detroit&rsquo;s Black population increased 159% from 303,721 to 787,687<br>
Detroit&rsquo;s criminal homicide rate increased 582%, <br>
Detroit&rsquo;s robbery rate rose from 596%</p>
<p><i>The buildings will crumble from looting and disrepair, the streets will be swallowed up by nature, and then there will be nothing.</i></p>

<p>Detroit is already there!  Look at this:  https://tinyurl.com/2wtupne</p>

		<p>Perhaps the US government will march into Detroit with troops to restore order.  Then rebuild the infrastructure and provide good governance.  Or is that only for Afghanistan and not America? </p>
<p><i>City officials suggest this will not shrink the size of the city. Perhaps it won&rsquo;t shrink Detroit on Google Maps. However, Bing&rsquo;s plan would effectively surrender 20% of the city to gangs &hellip;</i></p>
<p>The gangs will probably do a better job of providing services than the city government. Which is not saying much. At least the gangs bring in an economy, even if it is only drug dealing. </p>
<p>Oh well&hellip;</p>
