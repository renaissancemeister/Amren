<h1><a href="https://motherjones.com/riff/2010/12/duncan-hines-amazing-glazes-cupcakes">Are These Cupcakes Racist?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Maddie Oatman, Mother Jones, December 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When Duncan Hines partnered with film studio Filmaka to release a new ad campaign on YouTube this week for their &#8220;Amazing Glazes&#8221; frosting line, their aim was to &#8220;inspire creativity during the height of baking season&#8221; and portray how their icing &#8220;makes dessert sing.&#8221; The theme of the first video is &#8220;Hip Hop Cupcakes,&#8221; but rather than striking a chord with urban bakers, the video just seems to be pissing them off. Readers and bloggers have criticized the film&rsquo;s director, Josh Binder, and the dessert company&rsquo;s PR department for failing to see how the cupcake characters might be mistaken for performers in blackface. {snip}</p>
<p>Binder&rsquo;s Duncan Hines commercial shows vanilla cupcakes that  &mdash;  when covered in gooey chocolate frosting  &mdash;  begin to sing. An enraged commenter on the site Racialicious complained: &#8220;I am appalled that there seems to be not one single marketing staffer at Duncan Hines/Pinnacle Food Groups with any awareness of the legacy of US minstrelsy and racism that is inextricable from the dark brown, red-lipped, googly eyed characters&#8221; depicted in the video. Writes a Womanist Musing blogger: &#8220;Do I really need to break down why Blackface cupcakes are racist? I sincerely hope this commercial is fake, because if not, it represents a direct attack on Black people.&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>If the animated cupcakes had been made differently, to resemble a strong, athletic black male or a shapely, sexy black female, then there wouldn&rsquo;t have been a problem.</p>
<p>Black racial consciousness is thin-skinned. They only approve of positive stereotypical, iconic images of themselves.  Vulgar is okay, as long as the black is dominant. </p>
<p>The exception is when they&rsquo;re putting themselves down.  Then, anything goes, including the n-word.</p>

		<p>Maddie Oatman needs to look up what happened in Forsyth County, Georgia in 1912 so she will have a basis for comparison the next time she starts to call something as innocuous as this commercial &#8220;a direct attack on Black people&#8221;.</p>

<p>Actually, I find this to be just desserts for Duncan Hines and Comrade Binder; they chose to willingly attempt to pander to blacks and look what it got them, nothing but problems. Of course the charges of &ldquo;racism&rdquo; are not even worthy of being called ludicrous, but what else can be expected from the race hustlers and the witless black mob they &ldquo;lead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course one could call the add anti-white, since the one vanilla cupcake sings out of tune until all gooey and chocolate too. However, that is absurd as the above, in some ways.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>As usual blacks are upset by the most absurdly trivial things like this, but don&rsquo;t seem to care that they graduate about half of their children from high school.  Furthermore, I was expecting at least some off color black voices from this ad, some hip hop expressions or something, but no, there were none.  So as usual the black reactionaries and silly white liberals are crying wolf for the millionth time.  </p>

		<p>It is just fantastic that in the year 2010 we have a website like Racialicious <br>
<a href="https://www.racialicious.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.racialicious.com/</a></p>
<p>What a bunch of nonsense, that there is actually a profit and career to be had in race hustling. Look at this silliness disguised as deep thoughts by one of the principals:</p>
<p>One of the biggest barriers to working out racism in N. America is that ppl find being called &#8220;racist&#8221; intolerable. Need proof of this?&hellip;<br>

		<p>If whites slathered chocolate icing on cupcakes and said they represented &#8220;black people&#8221; then they would be called racist. But when whites slather chocolate icing on cupcakes and <i>blacks</i> say they represent &#8220;black people,&#8221; then guess what? It&rsquo;s still the whites who are racist!</p>

If you want to see minstrel today, just watch any rap video. Same shufflin&rsquo;, same jivin&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The only racist message I got from this is that white cupcakes can&rsquo;t sing. Apparently only black cupcakes can carry a tune.</p>

<p>Ah, but Eric, don&rsquo;t you see, it&rsquo;s all whiteys fault. It&rsquo;s the image of cupcakes in black face that is destroying their self-esteem, lowering their ability to focus in the classroom, and ultimately causing them to drop out of school.  Plus, when they eat the cupcakes, they get obese.  </p>

If I made the same conection blacks seem to with themselves and these creatures, I would be called a RACIST.<br>
But for some reason blacks do make the connection. Maybe they know something we don&rsquo;t?</p>

I had chosen a colorful Gingerbread Man when I thought to myself, This Gingerbread Man is BROWN, if Ibuy it and eat it will that make me a RACIST? I had them put the Gingerbread Man back in the case and I took a doughnut instead. Was this the right thing to do?</p>

		<p>Yes these cup cakes and the ad are racist! I am sure that the Duncan Hines CEO deliberately told the ad agency to come up with a commercial that was racist and offensive to Blacks in order to hurt their sales and to give millions of dollars to the NAACP, Rainbow Push and over community organizations. I am sure they will come up with taco pies or jihad cakes so as to offend even more radical minorities.</p>
<p>Actually I think John PM, got it right.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t see anything offensive in this advertisement.  If the woman in the video had squirted vanilla or strawberry glaze on those cupcakes and those same banjo eyes and big lips appeared on them nothing would have been said about it.  Since when does chocolate frosting become associated with black skin?  I don&rsquo;t understand why stuff like this gets flagged when I&rsquo;ve seen stuff that should get the NAACP up in arms like a Chase credit card commercial that was on a few months ago.  It features a nice late 30&rsquo;s middle or upper middle class White couple checking into a hotel.  It made an impression on me because you don&rsquo;t see many normal good looking White couples in commercials anymore. Anyhow, they walk down the corridor to the pool area and when they open the door they see a bunch of low class wiggers and hipsters partying to rap music.  They stare at each other in disbelief and in another frame the woman is hiding in a bush staring at everyone and she has a look on her face like she just stepped in dog waste.  They cut back to the crowd and right in front of everyone is a black guy in those clown clothes some of them wear with a funny hat bobbing his head and doing his &#8220;foshizzle my skizzle&#8221; routine.  The woman gets on the phone and tells Chase she wants to change hotels.   </p>

Can&rsquo;t remember all the details, it&rsquo;s some years back, but I think some town put up a huge potato figure, I think it was a Mr. Potato Head or something.

		<p>A corporation has gotta do what a corporation has gotta do (in other words, roll over, apologize and pull the ad), but for the rest of us, I think it&rsquo;s worth keeping in mind that there is no law against offending someone. There is no constitutional right to not be offended.</p>
<p>When these hyper PC thin skinned types come at you for some ludicrous perceived slight, the response should range from a curt &#8220;get lost&#8221; to a bemused pat on the head. As soon as we stop taking them seriously, many who are cowed on the sidelines will immediately run over to our side, relieved that someone is finally being honest.</p>
