        <p> <span class="dropcap">T</span>he media, teachers and public 
health officials have devoted enormous attention in recent years to the 
&#8220;teen pregnancy crisis.&#8221; But is there a crisis? And if so, for whom? It 
is a mistake to treat all teenage child births the same. A child born to
 a married 19-year-old has very different prospects from one born to an 
unmarried 14-year-old. Also, teenage motherhood follows the racial and 
ethnic patterns that pervade our society. Current anti-pregnancy 
campaigns largely ignore important distinctions of this kind, and are 
directed indiscriminately at all American teenagers. They therefore miss
 many of their intended targets and have the effect of discouraging 
childbirth among whites, who are the only group that is losing 
demographic ground while all others gain. </p>
        <p> As the most recent data from the National Center for Health 
Statistics show, teenage motherhood is disproportionately black and 
Hispanic, with these two minority groups accounting for more than half 
of all teenage births. Although whites (what the census bureau calls 
&#8220;non-Hispanic whites&#8221;) are 60.9 percent of the American population age 
17 and younger, in 1999 whites accounted for just 44.3 percent   &mdash;   a 
minority   &mdash;   of births to females 19 and younger. Tables 1 and 2 show the 
percentages for blacks and Hispanics. Non-white teenagers are more than 
twice as likely as whites to have children, and more than one in five 
babies (20.8 percent) born to American blacks in 1999 were born to 
teenage mothers. Any health program or education project aimed at 
reducing teenage births will therefore yield greater results if it 
targets blacks and Hispanics. </p>

        <p> What the authorities persist in calling a crisis of teenage 
pregnancy is in fact a crisis   &mdash;   or absence   &mdash;   of marriage. Teenage birth 
rates have not gone up in the past several decades; they have gone down.
 The teenage birth rate in 1999 of 49 per 1,000 teenage girls is only 60
 percent of the 1950 rate of 82 per 1,000 teenage girls. The reason the 
1950 rate was <i>not </i>a crisis is that most of those teenage mothers 
were married, whereas today they are not. In 1950, only about 13 percent
 of births to women in the 15-19 age group were out of wedlock, whereas 
the figure was <i>79 percent</i> in 1999. What this means is that 
teenage birth rates declined substantially in the past 50 years, but 
marriage virtually disappeared. Indeed, we find that in 1950 a 
14-year-old mother was more likely to be married than is a 19-year-old 
mother today. </p>
        <p> This is due in part to the fact that Americans now marry 
later than they used to; the median age at first marriage has risen by 
more than four years since 1950. Fifty years ago, about half of American
 women who were going to marry had done so by age 21, and that figure 
remained essentially the same until 1970. By 2000, the median age had 
crept up to 24.5 (see Table 3). This increase in the age at first 
marriage has been accompanied by sharp drops in the percentages of 
younger women who are married (see Table 4). The age group 20-24 is 
particularly striking, with 70 percent of women married by that age in 
1950 but only 27 percent in 1995. For females aged 15-19, 16.7 percent 
were married in 1950, compared to only 3.2 percent in 1995   &mdash;   an 80 
percent drop. </p>

        <p> Whether teenage motherhood <i>per se</i> constitutes a 
crisis, defining all births to mothers under age 20 as social pathology 
misses important differences between older teenagers (18 and 19) and 
minor girls 17 and younger. An 18-or 19-year-old girl is at least a 
legal adult who can sign a lease or open a bank account. She is more 
likely to have finished high school, and is eligible for full-time 
employment unconstrained by child labor laws. </p>

        <p> At the same time, marriage, although still the exception, is
 more common among older teenage mothers (second part of Table 6), with 
mothers in the 18-19 group six times more likely to be married than 
mothers 15 and under. More than 30 percent of births to Hispanic and 
white females 18-19 are to married women, compared to single-digit 
percentages for those 15 and under. </p>
        <p> For blacks, the likelihood of marriage increases only 
slightly for older teenage mothers. This simply reflects the general 
disappearance of marriage for blacks of all ages. In 1999, 69 percent of
 <i>all </i>births to blacks were to single women. This rate of 
illegitimacy for the entire black population is higher than the 
illegitimacy rate for 18   &mdash;   and 19-year-old whites and Hispanics. </p>
        <p> Even if it is misleading to include married women 18 and 
older in statistics about the &#8220;teen pregnancy crisis,&#8221; very young 
teenagers (those 15 and under) are almost certainly ill-prepared for 
motherhood. They are just girls, mostly still in middle school. The 
overwhelming majority are unmarried (indeed, most states prohibit 
marriage before age 16), and young teenagers are prohibited by law from 
full-time employment. These very young mothers are a real public 
concern. Their numbers are relatively few (31,950 births to girls 15 and
 younger in 1999 out of a total of nearly four million births), but 
&#8220;children having children&#8221; is the disturbing image that drives 
anti-pregnancy campaigns. </p>

        <p> An analysis of teenage motherhood by age reveals striking 
racial differences (Table 7). Nearly 70 percent of white teenage mothers
 are 18 or 19, and whites account for just 28 percent of births to girls
 15 and under. In 1999, &#8220;only&#8221; 9,011 births were to white girls of that 
age group. Meanwhile, nearly 40 percent of births to girls 15 and under 
were to black mothers, while Hispanics accounted for 31.3 percent of 
15-and-under births. This means that although the actual number of 
births is relatively low, a black girl 15 or younger is 5.4 times more 
likely to have a child than a white girl of that age group, and young 
teenage Hispanics are 3.9 times more likely. The majority of teenage 
mothers of all ages are non-white, and this is overwhelmingly true for 
the youngest mothers. In 1999 blacks and Hispanics accounted for no 
fewer than 71 percent of births to girls 15 and under. </p>
        <p> Interestingly, the overall teenage illegitimacy rate is 
actually slightly lower for Hispanics than for whites (67.3 percent v. 
67.5 percent for 18   &mdash;   and 19-year-olds   &mdash;   see lower part of Table 6). 
However, when illegitimacy is expressed in terms of the rate of unwed 
births to unmarried teenagers, Hispanics are more than twice as likely 
as whites to have illegitimate children (107.8 per thousand 18   &mdash;   and 
19-year-olds as opposed to 42.8   &mdash;   see upper part of Table 6). </p>
        <p> To explain this odd finding in round numbers, imagine that 
for every 1,000 white 18   &mdash;   and 19-year-olds there were 63 births, 43 of 
which were illegitimate. For Hispanics, there were 159 births, 108 of 
which were illegitimate. The illegitimacy rates are very similar, but at
 108 illegitimate births to teenagers, Hispanic teenagers are 
two-and-a-half times more likely to have illegitimate births than are 
white teenagers, for whom the illegitimacy rate is 43 per thousand 
teenagers. For that matter, Hispanic teenagers are also two-and-a-half 
times more likely than whites to have <i>legitimate</i> children. Hispanics simply show far higher fertility, both for legitimate and illegitimate babies, during the teenage years. </p>

        <p> This is not, however, the picture of teenage motherhood 
suggested by the media and by activist groups, which routinely ignore 
racial differences. On Nov. 28, 2001, the Alan Guttmacher Institute 
(AGI)   &mdash;   the research affiliate of Planned Parenthood   &mdash;   released a study 
comparing teenage birth rates in the United States with rates in Canada,
 Great Britain, France and Sweden. Predictably, AGI concluded that these
 nations had lower teenage birth rates because of &#8220;social expectations &hellip;
 that teenage partners should use contraceptives to avoid pregnancy and 
to prevent STDs.&#8221; AGI&rsquo;s press release announcing the study did not even 
mention race, although none of the other nations has large black or 
Hispanic populations. The &#8220;executive summary&#8221; of the study refers to 
race only to point out that &#8220;the birthrate among non-Hispanic white 
teenagers (36 per 1,000) is higher than overall rates in the other study
 countries.&#8221; So it is, but 36 per 1,000 is very close to 33 and 35 for 
Britain and New Zealand, and not that different from Canada&rsquo;s 27 (Table 
9). The Guttmacher Institute cannot bring itself to point out that it is
 blacks and Hispanics who raise the overall US rate to 64 per 1,000   &mdash;   
nearly twice the rate of the next highest country, New Zealand   &mdash;   and 
that without high non-white teenage pregnancy rates, there would be 
little drama in the study at all. It is silly to claim that the 
international differences are due to &#8220;social expectations&#8221; about 
contraception when the main reasons are racial. </p>
        <p> At the same time, as Table 9 suggests, populations do not 
generally show high overall fertility rates without a relatively high 
rate of teenage motherhood   &mdash;   as was true of the United States during the
 Baby Boom. Demographers point out that fertility delayed is fertility 
denied. In modern societies with birth control, unless some substantial 
number of women begin having children before age 20, fertility is likely
 to drop below replacement level. </p>
        <p> Table 9 shows that while the US has higher teenage birth 
rates than other industrialized countries, it is also the only one that 
has a total fertility rate that is near replacement level. Indeed, there
 seems to be an almost direct correlation between teenage birthrates and
 a nation&rsquo;s overall fertility. Disastrously low fertility rates in 
countries like Japan, Spain and Italy are cause for great concern, as 
the prospect of a shrinking, aging population threatens to bankrupt 
old-age pension systems and disrupt society. High teenage birthrates and
 higher overall fertility mean the US does not face the same problems, 
but these high rates are due exclusively to high non-white fertility. </p>
        <p> Young whites are being bombarded with scare-propaganda about
 teenage pregnancy when, in fact, they are considerably less &#8220;at risk&#8221; 
for this outcome than minority children. This propaganda may foster a 
general anti-natal mentality among whites, and an aversion to having

        <p> There is yet another racial difference in fertility 
patterns. In America, the decline in births to teenage mothers has been 
accompanied by an increase in the median age of first child-bearing 
(Table 11), but the increase has not been the same for blacks and 
whites. Early childbearing has been traditional for blacks: In 1960, 
half of all black mothers had their first child when they were 
teenagers, while the median age for whites was 22. The typical 
first-time white mother in 1960 was 2.4 years older than her black 
counterpart, but by 1997 that gap had increased to 3.8 years. The 
message to defer   &mdash;   and in some cases deny   &mdash;   childbearing has had a 
greater impact on whites than on blacks. By the time the typical white 
woman has her first child, the typical black woman&rsquo;s first child is 
nearly four years old. This delay in childbearing lowers white 
fertility, while it stretches out the span of years between white 
generations, further contributing to population decline. </p>
        <p> White women would have to give birth to 13.5 percent more 
babies every year in order for the white population just to maintain its
 current size. Meanwhile, Hispanic and black fertility rates are 62 and 
20 percent higher than the white rate, and ensure growing populations 
while the white population declines. One might well wonder about 
indiscriminate anti-natalist propaganda when some groups in the country 
are already below replacement-level fertility. The &#8220;success&#8221; of such 
propaganda only accelerates the decline of the white population. If 
crusaders against teenage motherhood were serious, they would 
concentrate on the black and Hispanic girls who account for more than 
half of teenage births. Targeting whites as part of a general campaign 
is yet another form of racial suicide. We should encourage whites to 
have children within marriage; instead they are encouraged only to use 
contraceptives, whether married or single.  <img src="../../../../ar/graphics/textend.gif" alt="AR" height="11" width="11"/> </p>

		<p>Way back in the early 70&rsquo;s my high school teachers were fervently teaching us that the world population was exploding at a terminal velocity and although we really ought not to have any children at all; if we  must, at least limit it to two at the most, one if possible. Naturally this was liberal white teachers, teaching  classrooms full of 100% white students&hellip;who unfortunately learned what they were taught.</p>

		<p>To be blunt, white folks need to start having a positive attitude toward children and have lots of them.  Since 1973, when the Supreme Court committed the most horrible form of judicial terrorism in U.S. history, legalizing the grotesque violence of abortion, more than 50 million babies in the womb have been killed and tossed in garbage cans&hellip; millions of them white children.  </p>
<p>White folks should have large generous families.  A solid traditional Christian morality will aide in this pursuit, but I&rsquo;m fearful that too many whites have embraced the consumer culture and anti-natal liberal attitudes.  </p>

		<p> Instead of promoting college and career to girls who will possibly wait- sometimes tragically too long- to have children these girls should be taught that marriage and motherhood are also honorable professions. Before the women&rsquo;s movement in the 70&rsquo;s it was considered the natural progression for kids to get married right out of high school and begin having children. Now kids are encouraged to seek a college education- worthless in most cases- and enter a sort of prolonged adolescence (especially for boys) with marriage entering the picture sometime around the late 20&rsquo;s or early 30&rsquo;s. With female fertility begining to wane around age 27 waiting until 28-30 to marry can paint a grim picture for couples wanting more than 1-2 children. </p>

		<p>Hispanic girls are legally off limits at age 15 yet 40 yr old Hispanic men know they can marry them by custom and start having babies.  This ensures that only skeevy old Mexican men have a shot at some of the prettiest girls and they take this to full advantage.  A white would never EVER consider banging a 15 yr old girl.  The woman gets 3 kids out by the time she is 18 and that qualifies her for upscale section 8 housing and free money. Meanwhile the man works and lives there in unofficial marriage bringing in 30k or so in cash tax free earnings. Without taxes and with free housing, they are out earning the white saps who have struggled through college and get 80k yr jobs but then pay taxes to support 4 other people</p>

		<p>&#8220;Disastrously low fertility rates in countries like Japan, Spain and Italy are cause for great concern, as the prospect of a shrinking, aging population threatens to bankrupt old-age pension systems and disrupt society.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
- Burke C. Dabney, American Renaissance, March 2002<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
The people of Japan, Spain, and Italy enjoy a higher standard of living than ever before in history. One of the reasons is a low birth rate. Fewer people mean that there is more of everything good to go around. It also helps to have people with high IQ&rsquo;s and low crime rates.<br/>
 <br/>
This can be illustrated by the following equation:<br/>
 <br/>
(level of technology * natural resources * quality of population) / population = standard of living.</p>

<p>Interesting ideas. From what I can see, not many White women have babies with blacks. But of the ones I observe, the woman and the child live mainly within the black community. </p>
<p>I know of one case when a White woman had a baby by a black, at first, her siblings were very supportive of her (of course, the parents were devastated). But as time passed and the halfcaste child grew, and the black tendencies of the child came to the fore, the support of the woman&rsquo;s siblings faded away until the woman and her child were/are no longer included in family activities. I think this is probably very much the norm. Extremely sad situation when it occurs, but it&rsquo;s not all that extensive as far as I can see. The vast majority of White women, no matter how misguided, have some sort of internal radar that keeps them from having babies by black men. </p>

		<p>Teenage pregnancy is less of a problem than illegitimacy - especially illegitimacy among those with low IQ&rsquo;s and high crime rates.  We cannot stop those on the left end of the bell curve from fornicating.  We can stop subsidizing the results of that fornication.  Aid to Families with Dependent Children should be replaced with free abortion on demand.  It should be easy for an unmarried, unemployable female to have an abortion.  It should be very difficult for her to raise the child.  </p>

		<p>America and Western Europe are soaked in sex for profit media and music.  This constant stream of sexual activity and the message that everyone is entitled to do anything they see on a screen or hear on a telephonic device leads people from the ages of 12 up to do anything their bodies tell them to do. </p>
<p>Race, a decade later after the article, has even less to do with sexual activity than societal green lights flashing in media. Media is the authority to which most people look for behavioral guidance. </p>
<p>Family, church, and traditions handed down to cohesive geographic communities that have dissolved are unknown to the vast majority of adolescents. Whites can financially deal with unwed mothers and their offspring a bit better than blacks or Latins.  Other than that, all adolescents are potential moms and dads sub-18 regardless of ethnic background. That is unfortunate for all affected.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s election, in particular,was significant more for his essential illegitimacy and his mother&rsquo;s indifference to traditional family as much as his part-African origin. He sends a big OK to whites, Asians and blacks about interracial as well as intraracial sex outside of marriage that produces offspring. </p>
<p>Perhaps European descendents have been Africanized? Whatever the reason, this at least is not an area for Caucasian finger-pointing.</p>

		<p>BIG MISTAKE by AmRen. Delaying child-birth to after-18 leads to postponing it later &amp; later. Teenage girls are at the apex of their fertility. The older a couple is when married, the more they&rsquo;re set in their own ways, the less they&rsquo;re able to accomodate each other, leading to feminism to &#8216;fix&rsquo; the discord. Not that Blacks aren&rsquo;t irresponsible but critizising them on teen pregnancy paints a bigger picture that you are bound to miss as you unwittingly promote your own ethnocide as described</p>

		<p>One way to slow the demographic decline of whites (besides encouraging white couples to have more children and reducing/eliminating nonwhite immigration) is to reduce the procreation of nonwhites. The low-hanging fruit here is that low-income blacks and Hispanics are often the most fecund, so they&rsquo;re the most likely to be on welfare. Therefore, if we linked the receipt of welfare to a requirement to accept an implanted contraceptive like norplant, or tube-tying, we could significantly reduce black and Hispanic birthrates. Some might object that this wouldn&rsquo;t have much impact on Hispanics, since they&rsquo;re overwhelmingly Catholic (at least in the nominal) but my own experiences with Hispanics indicates that there&rsquo;s lots of situations where their Catholic faith goes out the window-so I&rsquo;m pretty sure they&rsquo;d be happy to exchange having children for money. Since we whites are going to get stuck paying for their welfare anyway, in the short term, we should at least use it as an opportunity to reduce their rate of procreation.<br/>
Ultimately, of course, amputating those areas of the country that are overwhelmingly nonwhite already and consolidating in a new and smaller, but solidly white state is the only long-term solution. We cannot rid our politics of the effects of a significantly nonwhite electorate unless we have at least an 80% white majority (right now, whites are at about 60%, if we&rsquo;re using honest figures ie doesn&rsquo;t include North Africans, Persians, Octoroons, etc). But I think this might slow our decline in the short term, and if combined with reduced immigration and a higher birthrate among whites, would thus improve the demographic situation such that we white Americans won&rsquo;t have to give up as large a part of the country to secure a white majority in the remainder. Of course, even getting this relatively modest measure passed would probably require whites to practice a much greater degree of racial solidarity in politics than we currently show.</p>

		<p>I would guess that White teenage pregnancy rates are higher in certain areas of the country. IF the term &#8220;teenage pregnancy&#8221; would include girls who are married then my home state of Utah would probably lead the way since many girls here get married at 18-19 and begin starting a family immediatly. Often these couples are attending college (especially the boys) and they get help from the LDS church or family to continue in school. If a person is a tithe paying and active church member they will often be able to get assistance for food, clothing, rent or mortgage and (I believe) medical care. This is one reason that Utah&rsquo;s birthrate is what it is. To be sure this is often abused with people only attending church to get what is offered but at least they have to do something- and be working to better themselves since the benefits are not permanent. I am not LDS but I can see where other churches could try to impliment such programs instead of refering members to government aid. </p>

<i>What&rsquo;s often forgotten is that children born to teen parents are the healthiest physically and have the least birth defects.</i></p>
<p>Madison:</p>
<p>There are many more health risks for a teen mother and her baby than for mothers in their 20s and 30s. Underweight babies or babies with birth defects are a common result of teen pregnancy.</p>
<p><i>Teen pregnancy has a higher rate of pregnancy complications such as anemia, high blood pressure and premature labor   &mdash;   than pregnant women in their 20s or 30s. High blood pressure medications can disrupt the unborn baby&rsquo;s growth.</i></p>
<p><i>Teen moms are more likely to have a baby that is premature with undeveloped organs and subsequent problems such as respiratory distress or vision loss&hellip; The ones that make it tend to have mental and physical problems that continue later in life.</i></p>
<p><i>Teens are at higher risk of having low-birth-weight babies. A low birth weight has a greater risk of being born with major birth defects.  A teen girl&rsquo;s body is not done maturing or growing, making it difficult for her to meet the needs of her own body and a growing baby. Teens are less likely to gain the adequate amount of weight during pregnancy</i>  </p>
<p><i>Drinking, smoking, drug use, and poor nutrition can all contribute to low birth weight and premature birth. Seven of ten pregnant teens receive no prenatal care during the crucial first three months.  Recent research continues to show evidence of these risks for teen girls and their babies.</i></p>
<p><i>Children of teen parents are at a greater risk for developmental delays.</i></p>

<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/2rtgjo" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2rtgjo</a></p>
<p>Teen mothers are also more prone to post-partum depression and other emotional conditions linked to their own immaturity making their babies more likely to be a victim of child abuse or neglect and subsequently placed in the foster care system.</p>
<p>Not all teen mothers or their babies have such a dismal outcome, of course, and there are some success stories, but all the same, the risk factors are much much higher for a teen mother and her baby than for an adult over age 20.</p>

<p>Madison Grant, I&rsquo;d be very interested in seeing the source for your claim. You mean late teens right (16-19)? I don&rsquo;t think your average 13 year old would have an easy pregnancy or childbirth. A 13 year old usually isn&rsquo;t fully grown yet. </p>

<p>An earlier age for pregnancy is correlated with lower IQ. Higher IQ women invariably postpone marriage (let alone pregnancy) to after college graduation.</p>

		<p>One thing I wish people would understand, that these days responsible people establish themselves in careers and jobs before marriage so they can properly provide for their families. It would be easier if we didn&rsquo;t have to support the people who are self destructive to themselves and others. I&rsquo;m more than sure that if people didn&rsquo;t have their backs broken through taxation and so much bureaucracy, many could live up ot their ideal of early marriage and a stable family unit. </p>
<p>IF whites didn&rsquo;t have to support irresposible whites and floods of minorities, then it&rsquo;s likely that demographics would be higher and we wouldn&rsquo;t be so endangered. We could have plenty of kids and support them well and also have a lot of quality time with them. Parents could work reasonable hours and have more than enough, but these days, the safety net is how a hammock (found that slang on another forum) and a lifestyle. </p>
<p>Now instead of the many taxed and slaving to provide for the few, now, it&rsquo;s the few working like fiends and being taxed to support the idle many. Teen pregnancy is contributing ot that all the more and it&rsquo;s a literal lifetyle according to so many, it&rsquo;s generational and &#8216;cultural,&rsquo; which for some reason suffices as an excuse. In the past, it used to be one or two disgraceful incidences, but now it&rsquo;s embedded and society bends over backward for these irresponsible women. The fat perks they get should be going to the responsible. </p>

		<p>I have a question for the people on this board who are constantly slamming us white women for not having enough children: do you really think it would have been better for me to have started having kids at 18 (when I had little education, litle life experience, and all the men my age were more interested in video games than work), or is it better to wait until I am 30 and have one or two kids?  Since I was 18 I have gotten an education, a job, and above all the men my age are finally a serious about marriage and family.  Look, the ugly truth is that women who have children young are basically consigning themselves and their children to a life of poverty. I wanted my children to have all the things I never had which is why I waited.  PS - I can count on one hand the number of men younger than 21 I have known who were capable of supporting a family. If you think young women should be having more kids, then you first need to tell young men to grow up. </p>

Since 1973, when the Supreme Court committed the most horrible form of judicial terrorism in U.S. history, legalizing the grotesque violence of abortion, more than 50 million babies in the womb have been killed and tossed in garbage cans… millions of them white children. </i></p>
<p>Abortion actually works in favor of us, because it makes a much bigger dent in the non-white birth rate than the white birth rate. </p>
