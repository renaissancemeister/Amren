<h1>Ottawa Gang Member Deported to Somalia</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Duffy, Ottawa Citizen, Dec. 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 25-year-old street gang member, who came to Ottawa from Somalia at the age of nine, has been deported to that country in an operation praised by Public Safety Minister Vic Toews.<br>
 		<br>
But the father of Omar Ahmed, a former Ridgemont High School student, is furious at the treatment of his son. </p>
<p>Abdi Farah told the Citizen that his son was dropped last week in the lawless Somali capital, Mogadishu, despite assurances he says he was given from Canadian officials that he would be flown to Bosaso, a city in the more stable state of Puntland. </p>
<p>A spokesman for the Canada Border Services Agency would neither confirm nor deny the story. </p>
<p>&#8220;I am unable to confirm specifically where he was returned to,&#8221; Chris Kealey said. </p>
<p>Ahmed had been held by federal immigration as a danger to Canadians since April 1. He agreed to be deported in order to end his indefinite detention. </p>
<p>According to his father, Ahmed waived his legal appeals based on the government&rsquo;s assurance he would be returned to Bosaso. </p>
<p>The CBSA&rsquo;s Kealey said privacy concerns prevent him from revealing details of the government&rsquo;s dealings with Ahmed. </p>
<p>&#8220;But what I can say,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is that that is inconsistent with the information provided to both him and his father.&#8221; </p>
<p>Ahmed has admitted being a member of a notorious Ottawa street gang, the Ledbury Banff Crips. He was known on the street as &#8220;Ghost.&#8221; </p>
<p>Ahmed has been convicted of a series of crimes, including possession of crack cocaine for the purpose of trafficking, assault, mischief and uttering threats. </p>
<p>According to an Ottawa police report, the LBC gang uses guns and other weapons to aggressively defend its turf for cocaine trafficking. </p>
<p>Farah said that when his son called him from the Mogadishu airport in a panic, he arranged for a cousin to find him. The two men then walked for three days   &mdash;   about 150 kilometres   &mdash;   before securing a ride to the city of Galkayo, in southern Puntland. </p>
<p>&#8220;I am so mad: They (Canadian officials) promised me he would be safe,&#8221; said Farah, who fled the repressive Somali regime of president Siad Barre in 1986 and claimed refugee status in Canada. </p>
<p>He later brought his family, including his two young sons, to Ottawa from a refugee camp in Kenya. </p>
<p>Farah was not opposed to his son&rsquo;s deportation   &mdash;   he thought it might give him the chance to start over   &mdash;   but he&rsquo;s appalled at the government&rsquo;s handling of his return. </p>
<p>&#8220;They don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re doing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Imagine: Mogadishu is the worst place on Earth; it&rsquo;s like Afghanistan. That boy has no experience.&#8221; </p>
<p>Somalia&rsquo;s United Nations-backed government is now battling the Islamist group, al-Shabbab, for control of Mogadishu. The al-Qaeda linked group already controls much of southern and central Somalia. </p>
<p>In a news release, Vic Toews and Immigration Minister Jason Kenney congratulated the CBSA for its &#8220;successful removal&#8221; of Ahmed, who had been one of 11 Somalia-born criminals awaiting deportation from Canada. </p>
<p>&#8220;Removing dangerous offenders not only protects the safety of Canadians, but the integrity of the immigration system,&#8221; Toews said. &#8220;We do not tolerate those who come to this country and commit serious crimes.&#8221; </p>
<p>Canadian border agents flew with Ahmed to Nairobi, Kenya, where he was turned over to private security personnel for the flight to Somalia. </p>
<p>Farah said Ahmed was told he would be taken to Mogadishu, then board an internal flight to Bosaso. In Mogadishu, however, he discovered there was no such flight. </p>
<p>&#8220;He was in a very critical condition,&#8221; Farah said. &#8220;They just left him in the airport.&#8221; </p>
<p>Farah said he has spoken with his son five times since he returned to Somalia. He&rsquo;s now living with relatives in Galkayo, an area recently scarred by inter-clan violence. </p>
<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;s OK, he&rsquo;s a little bit scared,&#8221; said Farah. </p>
<p>Another Ottawa man, Somaliborn Abadir Ali, is also awaiting deportation to the same country. </p>
<p>Ali, 27, has been held in the by immigration authorities for the past two-and-a-half years. Last year, the government declared Ali a threat to Canadians because of five adult criminal convictions, two of which involved violent assaults.</p>

		<p>In the above article, a Somali immigrant to Canada says, &ldquo;Mogadishu is the worst place on Earth.&#8221;  He speaks the truth, and he should know.  And what made it the &#8220;worst place on Earth&#8221;?  Was is the soil, or the day length, or the native animals and plants?  No, it was the type of people who live there, that made it a bad place.  Our USA Western deserts (SE California, Arizona, etc.) are just as stark, yet they are wonderful places.</p>
<p>It is the people who live there that make a place paradise or Hell.  Yet our government insists on importing people that can only produce the latter outcome.  </p>

		<p>One token Somali deported back to his home country equals 10 fresh new Somali refugees arriving here in Canada during the same period spent transporting this convicted criminal overseas. </p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t African Somalis fleeing their country&rsquo;s fail-state status just simply re-locate elsewhere in Africa? </p>
<p>Oh, wait! African countries don&rsquo;t have easy welfare payment plans that dole out free money. I knew there was &#8220;a catch&#8221; somewhere in this attraction to the land of trusting fools.  </p>

		<p>Multiply this story 1 millions times and we would have a really great story on AMREN at last.</p>
<p>I saw a little Somali addopted child in a shop the other day, about 2 years old. Some other women were politely saying &#8220;how cute&#8221;. But anyone with any brains could see he was a just demanding spoiled little brat and monster in the making. He did not even look cute.</p>

		<p>This is wonderful news. I hope AMREN keeps us posted on the <br>
fate of Omar Ahmed. It seems that the boys in Mogadishu arent<br>
at all impressed by the Crips gang clothes or<br>
gang signs. Maybe Omar can call the Mogadishu ACLU for <br>
a little legal counsel on how to beat the system</p>

<p>Well the frips in Canada wanted diversity and they got it.</p>
<p>Before the influx of non-whites who were encouraged to come, Canada had no gangs to speak of.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s tribalized like the US with a large segment of the population drawing it to new lows financially, socially, and in matters of security.  It couldn&rsquo;t happen to a nicer bunch.</p>

		<p>Interesting and yet hard to believe that in the lovely land of Canada the street thugs have weapons.  </p>
<p>I thought Canada had strict gun control laws.</p>
<p>I find it unthinkable and incredible that criminals are not following the laws of Canada. What is this world coming to when criminals don&rsquo;t follow our laws and play by the rules?</p>
<p>Perhaps if we only used stronger language then the street thugs would be intimidated and compelled to follow our rules.</p>
<p>On the bright side of this story: although they may have deported this young man to Somalia, it could have been worse; they could have deported him to Mexico where it is ten times worse than Mogadishu.</p>
<p>I also find it amusing that the father wants to pick exactly where his criminal son is deported to and he is mad at the Canadian government for not carefully placing his criminal son where he would be the most comfortable.  Did it ever occur to the father to be mad at his son for dealing drugs, being a member of a street gang and causing general mayhem?  I think not, it is always &#8220;the system&#8221; that is at fault and never the minority individual.</p>

		<p>Maybe if this &#8220;father&#8221; had raised this guy correctly, he wouldn&rsquo;t have been involved with gangs in the first place. But he can&rsquo;t possibly be responsible for anything. No, it&rsquo;s the fault of the Canadian government that junior is now in a bad situation.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t believe Canada has finally deported someone to Somalia.  Thank God.  Usually they just drag things out for years and years with appeals.  I wish we could deport them all.   The Somali men seem to be natural born violent criminals.  Why in the world do western countries keep letting more of them in?  Our governments are crazy.  </p>

		<p>Perhaps this fellow can bring to Somalia all the lessons he learned about multiculturalism and diversity in Canada? </p>
<p>It would also be interesting to see the culture shock he experiences in Somalia, with its slightly different views of welfare and crime. I understand the Islamic Courts Union takes a dim view of the sort of activities in which he engaged while a resident of Canada. </p>
<p>There is room here for the CBC to do a television series. Following him around, and see how he deals with Somalia which, since it is not run by Whites, obviously has no racism or sexism or other such evils. </p>
<p>Or perhaps a US network could do a reality TV series: take a gang banger, or university diversity specialist, or rock star who shakes down Westerners for aid to Africa, and then dump then somewhere in the &#8220;dark continent&#8221; and see how long they last. </p>
<p>And pass the popcorn!</p>

		<p>In the UK, Somalis have an unemployment rate of 80%. No prizes for guessing their net effect on the UK economy.</p>

<p><i>Mogadishu is the worst place on Earth; it&rsquo;s like Afghanistan. That boy has no experience.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><br>
Hey there Mr. Father-of-da-Gangsta, I got a real noggin-scratcher of a question for you: If Somalia is the worst place on Earth, doesn&rsquo;t that mean Somalis like you are the worst PEOPLE on Earth?</p>
<p>Anyway, Big Dada, I wouldn&rsquo;t worry too much about that poor, &#8220;inexperienced&#8221; &#8220;boy&#8221; of yours   &mdash;   more accurately described as a 25-yr-old adult man with a history of crime and violence   &mdash;   back in his ancestral homeland. Somalia is what even Libtards have to admit is a &#8220;failed state.&#8221; It has had no government for quite a few years. Instead, it is ruled by crime families under a few extremely powerful warlords. International diplomats and political scientists have even been forced to invent the new term &#8220;Warlordism&#8221; to describe the country&rsquo;s (lack of) system of government. These warlords   &mdash;   despite being vicious criminals and sometimes even pirates   &mdash;   have the kind of power that presidents and prime ministers have in the West. The area   &mdash;   one hesitates to call a place without a government a &#8220;country&#8221;   &mdash;   is, literally, lawless. </p>
<p><i>And wit&rsquo; all dem mad skillz yo&rsquo; boyee Omar done picked up in da Crips, yo&rsquo; boyee Omar, he gon&rsquo; be a big, BIG man in Somalia, yo! Dem Somali gangstas, they think they tough but they ain&rsquo;t nevah tangle wif no Crips befo&rsquo;! Brotha Omar, he gon&rsquo; show dem Somalis da way da Crips roll!</i> </p>
<p>Yes, folks, remember the name: Omar Ahmed. I think we&rsquo;ll be hearing from that &#8220;boy.&#8221; And I don&rsquo;t mean a postcard. </p>
