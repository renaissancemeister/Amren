			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Henry K. Lee, San Francisco Chronicle, December 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A man has been convicted of charges that he beat and blinded a 78-year-old widow inside her Daly City home after she surprised him during a robbery attempt.</p>
<p>Jose Perez-Gonzalez, 31, an illegal immigrant who was living in South San Francisco, broke into the woman&rsquo;s home in the Serramonte neighborhood Jan. 12, 2008, by prying open a rear sliding-glass door. When the woman confronted him, Perez-Gonzalez beat her in the face with his metal pry bar, an attack that left her blind.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Perez-Gonzalez was a tenant in a South San Francisco apartment building that the victim&rsquo;s family owned. {snip}</p>
<p>Perez-Gonzalez intended to burglarize the residence when no one was there, authorities said.</p>
<p>Police tracked him to his hometown of Guadalajara, where Mexican authorities arrested him in November 2008.</p>

Mexican authorities did something right?</p>
<p>As for Speedy Gonzales here, the malevolent stupidity of his mugshot tells you he is from a backwards, under-evolved, heart-eating race unfit for life in 21st Century Gringoland. </p>
<p>In a properly run world, the only violence this person would be doing would be shooting poison blow-darts at the tribe from up the river in some Central American rainforest; and not blinding elderly white ladies with a metal pry bar in the United States. </p>
<p>People like this should not be here. Period. </p>

		<p>Oh yes, please please pass the DREAM act so fine upstanding poor illegal immigrants like this can get amnesty, a college education at in state tuition rates, and leave their life of crime.  (that&rsquo;s sarcasm folks.  Hang the little bastard).</p>

		<p>Perhaps a young male relative of the poor victim could administer the punishment. A tire iron, maybe? Let&rsquo;s see how &#8220;macho&#8221; he is then.</p>

		<p>Yes proponents and supporters of illegal immigration always tell us &#8220;illegals seldom commit crimes, especially violent crimes.&#8221; Any serving law enforcement officer knows better.</p>

		<p>If there was any real justice in this world, he would have a date with the needle. But here in CA. the liberals have taken over pushing diversity and pressed for amnesty at every turn. CA is close to maximum density with illegals, with no end insight. I would move my family, but my company is CA based (wine).</p>

<p>We have a thriving and growing wine industry here in Washington state  &mdash;  Plenty of Mexicans too unfortunately, both legal and not, but not nearly as many as you have down there in Mexifornia. Think about moving up here. People in the central and eastern parts of the state are conservative and mostly racially aware, Only the coastal city dwellers (think Seattle and area, south to Portland, OR) are loony libs.  <br>

I wonder how the family feels about renting to illegals now. They brought this brutality upon themselves, all for a few dollars.</p>

<p><br>
I don&rsquo;t believe landlords have much choice in who they rent to, do they? If they were to demand to see papers verifying the legality of every hispanic who wanted to rent from them, wouldn&rsquo;t they be guilty of some-damn-thing-or-other under the Fair Housing Act or similar legislation?</p>
<p>In an illegal-heavy state like CA, it is simply not fair to blame the family of the victim for having rented to illegals. They probably felt forced to. Having Grandma robbed, assaulted and even BLINDED is   &mdash;   per the perverted logic of the Multikult   &mdash;   merely &#8220;collateral damage&#8221;. To the insane gatekeepers of &#8220;Sanctuary Cities&#8221; like San Francisco, losing the occasional white senior to mestizo mayhem can be comfortably filed under &#8220;acceptable losses.&#8221; In an aggressively diversificated area, our elites dismiss the damage done to white Americans like this, as nothing more than &#8220;the cost of doing business.&#8221; </p>
