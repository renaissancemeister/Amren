<h1><a href="https://www.thelocal.de/national/20101228-32077.html">Airports Demand Racial Profiling to Fight Terror</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Local Europe GmbH (Berlin), December 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The incoming head of Germany&rsquo;s main airport lobby group is demanding the nation&rsquo;s transit authorities use racial profiling to weed out terrorists at security checks.</p>
<p>Christoph Blume, the head of DÃ¼sseldorf Airport, told daily Rheinische Post on Tuesday that air passengers should be divided into different risk categories, meaning they would be subject varying degrees of scrutiny by airport security.</p>
<p>&#8220;That way, the security system could become more effective to everyone&rsquo;s benefit,&#8221; said Blume, who will take the helm of the ADV airport association next month.</p>
<p>He said profiling passengers according to characteristics such as race, religion and country of origin would allow German airports to avert a further tightening of security.</p>
<p>While highly controversial because of its discriminatory nature, racial profiling has also found growing support in some quarters. However, critics fear it would stigmatize entire groups of passengers simply on their looks, faith or from where their trip originated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such suggestions sound too much like the wish to save some time,&#8221; said Bernhard Witthaut, the head of the GdP police union, in Berlin on Tuesday. &#8220;But it&rsquo;s better to spend half an hour in line than end up dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Blume said airports would soon no longer be able to cope with the threat of terrorism. </p>
<p>&#8220;Each new incident leads to extra checks and security measures. This creates a security escalation that will eventually hit its technical and operational limits,&#8221; Blume told the paper.</p>
<p>However, Blume still supported the introduction of so-called &#8220;naked scanners&#8221; that can reveal dangerous objects under clothing at German airports. Currently, backscatter scanners are being tested only in Hamburg before officials decide this spring whether to expand their use nationwide.<br>

		<p>The terrorists have already won.  Causing a virtual invasion of privacy rights throughout the entire West is more than they could ever could have hoped for, because the infringement on individual rights&hellip;long term&hellip;.without serious repercussions is unsustainable.  There will soon be violent reactions on a regular basis that will cause the federal Gestapo to rethink their hare-brained schemes.</p>
<p>In fact, there are so many 1984 situations converging at the same time this empire is just barely able to limp along, and it&rsquo;s really, really humorous when the elite talking heads try to convince us they are seeing &#8220;Green shoots,&#8221; or try to convince us the recession is over, when every indication reveals we are about to enter a period of rampant inflation, while the dollar is alreading dropping to levels never before seen.</p>
<p>Too, just recently, they claimed a &#8220;bullish&#8221; stock market was marking an economic upsurge when they were reporting that public pensions to police, firefighters and other government workers were not going to be paid, because revenue was dropping so quickly, and the funds were spent on other things.</p>
<p>One more terrorist attack or serious attempt will just about put this fading empire into unsustainable mode.</p>

		<p>Actually, there is a way to make airport security work without any further crippling technology investment problems at all:</p>
<p>1.  You put an explosive or electronic system on an aircraft which destroys or deactivates the engines, midflight.  Along with a cabin monitoring video system and a further one for the the baggage area in case of remote bombs.  This is no more dangerous or likely to be abused than any other _range safe_ (think Shuttle Challenger, blown up by the Kennedy officer so that bits and pieces of the boosters wouldn&rsquo;t fall all over) system because you are talking perhaps a million-digit cypher that is unique for each jet, every flight (carried to the jet on a DTM or data transfer module which also programs the nav systems).  Other than the obvious, it allows you to do ONE KEY THING: identify, without a doubt, the attackers.</p>
<p>2.  Any attacker from any nation that is part of the UN should automatically render his passport issuing home state liable for a billion dollars per casualty caused.  No ifs ands or but maybes.  Failure to comply = 100% exclusion from world economics, including all imports of food.  In the case of Saudi, it means invasion to control the flow of oil &#8216;under G8 regency&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Civil Air based terrorism from the Middle East would stop tomorrow.</p>
<p>The house of Saud controls the Wahabists.  The Wahabists depend on Saudi empowerment to sustain their Sharia+ oppressive religious rule.  Both together watch each other&rsquo;s back by maintaining an absolute overwatch of everything said by every imam at every mosque or coffee shop.  NOTHING happens, inside or outside The Kingdom, in terms of terrorist funding, incitation or training, that they don&rsquo;t know about.</p>
<p>Much the same can be said for Shiia Iran.</p>
<p>Those two nations, together, are responsible for 80-90% of world wide terrorism, either by funding, training, technology or &#8216;volunteers&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And they damn well know it, however much they pretend that Islam is a religion of peace.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t attack a problem from the broad side of a funnel.  You go after the instigators and make -them- pay the price for their shabby religions immorality.</p>

<p><br>
In my opinion (just a logical guess), when the well starts to go dry and the pols have to decide whether to cut those pension checks or the welfare, it will be the pensions that will suffer. </p>
<p>Why? Because politicians are practical. They know that pensioners are not going to run out into the streets and riot. Elderly people do not loot, shoot, and burn.  But welfare people will not hesitate to do so.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always the squeaky wheel that gets the grease. </p>

<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
And they know this:</p>
<p>Elderly pensioners will get loans, draw on their savings, or turn to relatives for help. They may grumble, but that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>Welfare people can&rsquo;t get loans, don&rsquo;t have savings, and their relatives won&rsquo;t help them.  So they riot.</p>
