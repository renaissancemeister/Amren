			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Agence France-Presse, December 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Haitian mobs fearing a cholera epidemic have killed people whom they had accused of trying to spread the disease, including through witchcraft, police say.</p>
<p>&#8220;A dozen people accused of importing cholera to a region that so far has been spared were killed with machetes and stones and their corpses were burned in the streets,&#8221; a police inspector said.</p>
<p>A prosecutor, Kesner Numa, said: &#8220;These people are accused of witchcraft related to cholera.&#8221; The attackers believed the victims were trying to &#8220;plant a substance that spreads the disease in the region&#8221;.</p>
<p>The first lynching cases took place last week. &#8220;Since then we have had cases every day,&#8221; the prosecutor said.</p>
<p>Communities in the Grand Anse region in the far south-west of Haiti were refusing to co-operate with investigations into the killings.</p>
<p>&#8220;They really believe that witches are taking advantage of the cholera epidemic to kill.&#8221; It was not immediately clear if any of the victims had cholera.</p>
<p>Six people were hacked or stoned to death in the town of Chambellan and five others in Marfranc and Dame Marie, officials said.</p>
<p>According to journalists, at least three people were killed by mobs in the city of Jeremie, while several others were killed under similar circumstances in surrounding villages.</p>
<p>Health authorities say Grand Anse is the region least affected by the cholera epidemic, which has killed 1817 in Haiti since mid-October. Only five of those deaths have been reported in Grand Anse.</p>
<p>About half of Haiti&rsquo;s population is believed to practise the voodoo religion in some form, although many are thought to also follow other religious beliefs at the same time.<br>

		<p>Ironic, isn&rsquo;t it?  After decades of civil rights legislation and hateful rhetoric toward whites, the only blacks getting lynched, are being lynched by blacks.  The only blacks being otherwise murdered, are being murdered by blacks.  Haiti.  Tropical paradise.<br>
No different than any continental African country in it&rsquo;s primitive violence and mentality.</p>

		<p>Machetes? Haiti is basically a colony of Africa whose residents are so close to the United States they can actually get here on makeshift boats. Its residents wear Western clothing in good condition, own amenities of modern life such as cellphones, and have massively increased its population beyond what the land can bear due to a massive influx of monetary aid from this country. But, despite all this, they still retain their African ways and customs.</p>

		<p>Yes sir, these are the just the kind of people we want to handle $5 billion in assistance money. This is absolutely intolerable - why is there not more outrage from civilized nations? If the liberal press is reporting a dozen killed can you imagine the actual total? This is another sad example of a country run by blacks. </p>
<p>The real issue is not that these primitive people engage in a barbaric form of witchcraft to rid their homeland of cholera - it&rsquo;s the fact that despite all the outside aid cholera developed in the first place.   </p>

<p>Good lord; they&rsquo;re onto us.</p>
<p>Seriously, though, we have landed men on the moon and sent space probes to every planet in the solar system and NASA has plans for a 100-year flight of one to Alpha Centauri, and only 450 miles off the main space center at Cape Canaveral people are dismembering &#8220;witches&#8221; with machetes.  Quite remarkable really!  I suppose it might even be funny if we weren&rsquo;t allowing these primitives to move here.</p>

		<p>After all the TV media coverage of the earthquake, there&rsquo;s hardly a squeak heard about this epidemic  &mdash;  possibly because no one wants to actually go there to cover events.  Any reporter who was previously there has to know about the squalor and savagery and has to feel enormous frustration over the fact that billions of dollars have gone down a black hole.  Little or no change is evident in the dreadful living conditions, and another joke of a presidential election (with about 19 candidates) has lumbered past.  Before long, even members of foreign religious charities will face certain death there.</p>

		<p>   I&rsquo;ve known some Africans at the various universities where I have worked. Most are from the educated elites in their respective countries. These are high I.Q. people, and yet some have indicated to me that they believe in witches. If some of the educated African elite believe in witches, I wonder how many average Africans&rsquo; embrace this medieval superstition?  I have to admit that Haiti seems even worse than Africa in this regard. </p>

		<p>Yeah, witches are a big problem in Haiti. Flying around on their broom sticks, dropping vials of cholera on everyone, it has been an on going issue. I thought maybe America sending these people money would have helped them set up their anti witch defenses. But apparently the problem is too big. But, thankfully the people are fighting back and have already killed some of the nasty witches. Hopefully this will cause cholera to stop spreading as fast.  Atleast until The zombies attack.     <br>

		<p>&#8220;Where Black Rules White; A Journey Across and About Haiti&#8221;</p>
<p>hehe, I read that on my own while I was in college. It was certainly &#8216;race realist&rsquo;. And probably more factual than another book I read. To be honest, I forget the title and main figure in the other book. But it was about a catholic priest sent to the new world to document and chronicle the abuses of slavery and the European governments during pretty much the same time the 1700- 1800&rsquo;s. He was basically tasked with being a lawyer for the natives and the downtrodden and to present his findings back home as the opposition. I&rsquo;m sure the priests name is relatively famous as these things go (tho he&rsquo;s just known as an author or historian I think people who read of him don&rsquo;t even know he was a priest let alone his job or mission). But the funny thing is that his findings, the most extreme claims that he could find anywhere in the new world, these claims are now reported as &#8216;fact&rsquo; in our other books. And the only facts, there is no other side or other reality. He&rsquo;s not an activist, a specialized activist at that, but a historian. &#8216;When Black Rules Whites&rsquo; is really an oddity. I wouldn&rsquo;t claim it is &#8216;balanced&rsquo; either, tho probably much more factual (people who used the priests work aren&rsquo;t so concerned with facts as story?). When Black Rules White does present another side and one you can&rsquo;t read about anywhere else?</p>

<p>Well, a lot of them probably do have cell phones. I&rsquo;ve never been to Haiti, but I&rsquo;ve been just across the border in the D.R. in the area of the sugar plantations. Cinder block dwellings, huts with thatched roofs, one water spigot for a whole settlement, no toilets (just go out in the brush), so-called &#8220;clinics&#8221; that I wouldn&rsquo;t take my dog to, etc., etc. But, you would be amazed how many of these people had cell phones!  <br>

		<p>This is obviously the fault of the evil, wicked white man, and has absolutely nothing to do with the primitive and superstitious nature of most blacks.</p>
<p>Obviously, the only solution to this terrible injustice is to let thousands of Haitians into the country to vote for the Democrats-I mean, build a better life for themselves.</p>
<p>Though God knows I shouldn&rsquo;t give them ideas, especially since some brain-dead Republican is probably arguing that we should let in a bunch of Haitians because Voodoo promotes &#8220;family values&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Seems that all the posters see it like I do.  It is amazing that our country and whites in particular are so cowed that we can&rsquo;t really speak of the black blight all around us.  I suppose after several more centuries of miscengenation (sp?) that there will be enough mulattos with some semblance of sense that we can figure out a better way.  Right now, being controlled by the libs in the media, isn&rsquo;t working well.  Now, if there were 100&rsquo;s or thousands of posts on here agreeing, I would feel better but as of this post, there are 19 and 2 are mine&hellip;.we&rsquo;re vastly outnumbered and the other side looks insane from here.  </p>

<p>That was a village in Britain. And they were allowed to get out but they said to themself that they don&rsquo;t want to kill anybody. A whole village agreed to live there and die. No matter if they already had the illness or not, they stayed to not go to another village and bring illness to them.</p>
<p>This is how solidarity works in white race.</p>

		<p>General mental ability   &mdash;  &#8220;g&#8221;  &mdash;  is passionately ignored as to its<br>
inevitable &#8220;segregationist&#8221; influence in the contemporary urbanizing world.  As a consequence, whether in Haiti or in<br>
Des Moines, persons who in village communities of 130 years ago<br>
could see farther, faster than most and could inform and temper community perceptions are nowadays drawn into suburbia or other <br>
&#8220;g&#8221; concentrations and thus remaining ghetto humanity becomes more and more &#8220;mass-ified&#8221; and media mesmerized.  It is likely a basic factor in these third- and fourth-world commotions.  When folks were unfortunately segregated merely upon overt manifestations of racial origins, at least there was more dispersal of brain power.</p>

		<p> &#8220;I suppose after several more centuries of miscengenation (sp?) that there will be enough mulattos with some semblance of sense that we can figure out a better way.&#8221;<br>
Why should mulattos have any more sense than whites? They have lower intelligence, on average. Furthermore, why should they necessarily care about solving the problems inherent in a multiracial society? It certainly didn&rsquo;t work out that way in Haiti, where the ruling class was mulatto. <br>
The problem with whites is that most of us have been brainwashed from the age of five (and some sooner) to believe that we are evil by fact of our birth, and that blacks can do no wrong, and if they do it is only because the white man oppressed them. This allows blacks to get away with things that would never be tolerated of poor whites, whom blacks regularly deride as &#8220;crackers&#8221; and other whites deride as &#8220;rednecks&#8221;.</p>
