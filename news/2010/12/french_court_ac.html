<h1>French Court Acquits Le Pen of Incitement</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Deutsche Presse-Agentur, December 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A French criminal court Thursday acquitted right-wing politician Jean-Marie Le Pen of charges of incitement against Muslims during a regional election campaign earlier in the year.</p>
<p>Human rights groups had filed a suit against the 81-year-old Le Pen, currently a deputy in the European Parliament, accusing him of religious incitement over a campaign poster of his National Front (FN) party last March.</p>
<p>The poster bore the message &#8216;no to Islamism&rsquo; and depicted a fully-veiled woman in front of a map of France, the Algerian national flag, and a missile resembling a minaret.</p>
<p>At the time, a court in Marseille, acting on complaints, ordered the posters to be removed.</p>
<p>In a hearing on October 28, prosecutors demanded a one-year suspension of Le Pen&rsquo;s right stand for election, a two-month suspended jail term and a fine of 20,000 euros (27,000 dollars).</p>
<p>Le Pen&rsquo;s defence argued successfully in court that the poster was not directed against Islam as a whole, but rather Islamism and that the suit had wrongly targeted him, instead of the FN.</p><h3 align="center">

		<p>It&rsquo;s just plain disgusting to read of the persecution of this man for simply saying the truth, while allowing the instigators among the third world hordes to continue their 100 per night car burnings, plus allowing the imams to preach anti-French hatred and jihad.</p>
<p>During their latest austerity riots, someone claimed that, &#8220;We&rsquo;re going to riot like it was 1789.&#8221;  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not good news for the elites, because when payback time was upon their historical colleagues, the guillontine was working overtime and corrupt blood flowed freely.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m inclined to believe that their multicultural paradise in the &#8220;no go&#8221; zones are going to be competing with the austerity rioters to see who can wreck the most havoc, because France&rsquo;s debt is not as bad as Greece, Ireland, Spain and Portugal, BUT IT IS BAD and getting worse.  Every indication is that drastic cuts will have to be added to the ones already made.</p>
<p>Even Germany is weakening and the worry is that they&rsquo;re going to go belly up for bailing out so many Euro members.</p>
<p>I think Le Pen will be the very least of France&rsquo;s worries in a year or two&hellip;.maybe sooner.  It depends on many variables.</p>

		<p>In the U.S., groups like CAIR scour the land for causes to drag into court, or, in many cases, set up the circumstances themselves.  Surely, such a case was the traditional-garbed woman who refused to comply with a &#8220;no head covering&#8221; rule at a skating rink.  And the same for the men who, several years ago, boarded a plane and intentionally acted in ways to alarm the flight attendants.  These Moslems apparently hope to wear down the legal defenses of the nation so that no one dares to question them.  Now, CAIR is challenging an Oklahoma law to bar Sharia.  An Affirmative Action judge has temporarily halted the law&rsquo;s enforcement, maybe because she had no idea how to rule.  The Moslem who claims he might just be, somehow, sometime in the future affected, obviously has no standing to challenge the law.  </p>

		<p>Since non-whites, and all those in the West who deal in information, since they all propose whites are responsible for all evil in history, and evils continuation into present, scince this is not &#8216;racial hatred&rsquo; (racial-hatred being something that only afflicts whites), why can&rsquo;t non-whites be charged with inciting racial hatred, being so many of their actions do nothing but incite racial hatred. Indeed, that seems to be their very reasons for acting. </p>
