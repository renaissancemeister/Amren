<h1><a href="https://www.wnd.com/index.php?pageId=237509">College Slammed for Censoring Class on Islam</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Carl, WorldNetDaily, December 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A community college in Oregon is getting slammed for giving in to pressure from a branch of an organization that once was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in a terror funding trial and censoring a class on Islam.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The dispute erupted when officials at Lane Community College in Eugene, Ore., were pressured by CAIR to cancel a class proposed by a teacher, Barry Sommer.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Approval came in due course, Sommer reported, but when the word of the course actually started getting out, the attacks started.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I did [an] interview and evidently within a few hours of when the interview was broadcast, CAIR got wind of it and issued the press release,&#8221; Sommer said. &#8220;In response they [the college] cancelled my class with no explanation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Officials at the school were not available for comment, but said in a prepared statement, &#8220;It was the desire to have a more intentional conversation about how to move forward that led to the decision to not proceed with the new noncredit class.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Washington state CAIR chapter had spearheaded the opposition to the class. Leader Arsalan Bukhari said Sommers gave them several reasons for concern.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are three main concerns. One is the person&rsquo;s own views that he very publicly airs. He has a website he maintains where he has a cartoon picture of the Prophet Muhammad with a bomb in his turban,&#8221; Bukhari said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s something that people should know by now is very insulting to Muslims. The second is, we&rsquo;re wondering what kind of educational background he has. And of course, he&rsquo;s a member of ACT for America. He&rsquo;s the Oregon chapter head. That&rsquo;s also one of the red flags that we saw,&#8221; Bukhari said.</p>
<p>Bukhari accused Act for America President and founder Brigitte Gabriel of being anti-Muslim.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;CAIR considers Brigitte Gabriel and ACT for America a vicious, anti-Muslim hate group. They used that it seems in their press release as a springboard to say that I know nothing about Islam. They gave the usual list of vitriol, that I&rsquo;m an Islamophobe, hate-monger, anti-Muslim and all of that,&#8221; Sommer observed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Knowing the history of CAIR, an unindicted co-conspirator in the Holy Land Foundation terrorism funding trial and slush money to Hamas; a leader in the Flying Imams trial,&#8221; Sommer listed.</p>

		<p>The way to fight Islam is by law.  </p>
<p>It is the responsibility of elected government to keep Islam out of our territory.  Protecting our borders so that our children will have a place to thrive is the primary duty of government, and that includes barring muslims from settling and taking root in our communities.</p>

		<p>This is all madness. Islamic radicals intend to bury us with our very own system and we&rsquo;re just sitting back, letting them do it.  These so-called Muslim rights groups should be found guilty of sedition.  Rather than x-raying or patting down millions of non-Muslim travelers at airports, target and detain those who fit the profile of the agitators and murderers.  CAIR has proven terrorist ties and should be immediately disbanded.  Most importantly, all Muslims should be deported to wherever they came from.  I don&rsquo;t care if they are students or naturalized citizens.  I&rsquo;m not fooled by any hard luck story they have, or some lie about loving the US.  The last poll of Muslims in the US stated most of them believe that terrorism/murder is JUSTIFIABLE in some cases.  Which cases are those, where it&rsquo;s OK to blow up innocent people?  It is now time to act.  Somebody smart, who has the power and the courage, needs to make the call.</p>

		<p>I live in the city where that school is located. I would never expect anything but this here. After all people, we are talking about Eugene, OR. This place is an intellectual wasteland.</p>

		<p>I despise these non-white and non-Christian groups very much!  They only believe in civil rights, provided it&rsquo;s not them getting screwed over.  They only want to be painted in a positive light, yet whites and Christians are allowed to be browbeaten and guilt-tripped from here to eternity.</p>

		<p>CAIR has way too much power, and I firmly believe that CAIR has alot of sway with both the Chicago power machine as well as BHO.</p>

		<p>To be fair, I took a class on Islam once at a state college, and the professor was a refugee from Iran who fled Khomeini&rsquo;s revolution.  He was a militant, secularist and monarchist, and his teaching was not exactley neutral and after three or four classes, the christian students were calling him out for over-vilifying his subject matter in a more than obvious way.</p>
<p>It would be like hiring a Bosnian moslem to teach classes on serbian history.  </p>
<p>I want unbiased teachers, not ideologues with an ax to grind.</p>
