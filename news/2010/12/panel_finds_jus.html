<h1><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/dec/6/panel-finds-justice-reluctant-take-cases-white-vic/">Panel Finds Justice Reluctant to Take Cases of White Victims</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jerry Seper, Washington Times, December 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Justice Department stonewalled efforts by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights to investigate the dismissal of a civil complaint against the New Black Panther Party, leaving open the question of whether the department is willing to pursue civil rights cases &#8220;in which whites were the perceived victims and minorities the alleged wrongdoers.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a 144-page report completed in November and released over the weekend, the commission said its lengthy investigation had uncovered &#8220;numerous specific examples of open hostility and opposition&#8221; within the department&rsquo;s Civil Rights Division to pursuing cases in which whites were the victims.</p>
<p>The report, posted on the commission&rsquo;s web site, said testimony obtained by the panel during its investigation included allegations that some Justice Department lawyers refused to work on cases involving white victims; that lawyers who worked on such cases were harassed and ostracized; and that some employees, including supervisory attorneys and political appointees, openly opposed race-neutral enforcement of voting rights laws.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In its report, adopted in a 5-2 vote during a meeting in November but not make it public, the commission said it became interested in the New Black Panther case because of the &#8220;notoriety of the incident and the unusual dismissal of uncontested claims.&#8221; It said the commission then sent letters to Justice asking it to explain the basis for its actions, but the department was &#8220;largely unresponsive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was not anticipated was the extent of the department&rsquo;s lack of cooperation,&#8221; the report said. &#8220;At various times the department alleged it would provide no information because the matter was being reviewed by its Office of Professional Responsibility. At other times, the Department raised a wide variety of legal privileges, many of which seemed to have no relevance to the current investigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although the department eventually began to provide some information, including 4,000 pages of documents, the report said much of the information provided either did not relate to the New Black Panther Party litigation, involved matters that were already public, or involved prior voter intimidation lawsuits. The report said the information did not address the core of the commission&rsquo;s inquiry as to why the NBPP lawsuit had been challenged internally.</p>

<p>Not anticipated by whom?  Or are the authors of the report simply  being ingenuous?  Certainly I have no doubt that no one on this website could have failed to anticipate the magnitude of the &#8220;Justice&#8221; (sic) Department&rsquo;s anti-White shenanigans.</p>

		<p>I would like the names of the lawyers who feel I don&rsquo;t have any civil rights.  I think any &#8220;civil servant&#8221; who only serves one segment of the population deserves to have his or her name made public.</p>

		<p>Of course they are reluctant! Look at the articles posted here where obvious hate crimes are not prosecuted as such since the victims were white.</p>

		<p>A nation that accepts Brown v. Board and all the disparate impact and unequal treatment that comes along with it should not expect equal treatment under the law from the Affirmative Action enforcers, nor do we deserve it.  </p>
<p>The surprise is that this report hasn&rsquo;t yet been endorsed as official policy.</p>
<p>Constantly telling blacks about the evil, unearned White Privilege and how they are owed Restorative Justice only creates a climate where Whites are targeted for punishing treatment and eventually violence.   We are in very dangerous times, and all our troubles were predicted by our Race Realist fathers, those great and holy men who gave the sanctified Jim Crow segregation.  </p>
<p>Civil Rights for afrovoodoos was a planned attack on our nation by the unmentionable tribe.  They are winning.   The Muslims will make their future manipulations a bit more delicate.</p>
<p>Transcend Diversity Always, Embrace White Humanity Only, Repeal the Illegal 14th Amendment, Send the Africans back to Africa!<br>

		<p>Reluctance to criminally pursue cases of black on white racial brutality isn&rsquo;t just lacking in the US Justice Dept., it extends all the way down to the state and city courts in every city, county and state in the country.  Everybody on this site knows that.</p>
<p>In fact, this same attitude is reflected in most every police department and seriff&rsquo;s office as well.  </p>
<p>How many times have we heard from law enforcement and, especially, a prosecutor that no hate crime charges would be forthcoming from an obvious black on white hate crime?  They even go so far as to play down any racial hatred by blacks against whites.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sick of it, and I regard the US Justice Dept., the federal police and all the state and local courts and police as enemies of whites.</p>
<p>I made a promise to myself 20 years or more ago:  I WILL NOT SUPPORT THE COURTS AND POLICE NO MATTER WHAT MIGHT OCCUR.  They are every bit our enemies as the leftist kooks in the media, blacks, and Hollywood and should be regarded as just exactly that.</p>

		<p>Welcome to Jamerica, where people of color are &#8216;always the victims&rsquo; and whites are &#8216;always the oppressors&rsquo; (It&rsquo;s the only way to hide the 2 million acts of crime or violence by victims of color on white Jamerican&rsquo;s each year) and anyone who objects is &#8216;nazi&rsquo;.</p>

		<p> Under Barack Obama, they should call the Justice Department the &#8220;Just Us Department,&#8221; because the blacks who hold the whip hand in that agency only want to help their own kind   &mdash;   not voters who have been denied their rights regardless of race.</p>
<p> Black lawyers who refuse to deal with cases involving White victims want to perpetuate the fiction that only blacks are ever the victims of &#8220;voter intimidation,&#8221; or other forms of election shenanigans. White lawyers who display the same attitude are starry-eyed liberals whose only regret is that they weren&rsquo;t born early enough to &#8220;March to Selma&#8221; with the civil rights demonstrators in the 1960s. Those Caucasians are, in a word, race traitors.</p>

		<p>According to Holder AG [ZANU-PF], as is HIS understanding, the civil rights laws do not apply to whitey. Whitey is NOT a protected class of persons. A perverse distortion and &#8220;interpretation&#8221; [everyone is a Supreme Court Justice] of the law. </p>
<p>Holder AG [ZANU-PF], if you read this and can understand, the CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS APPLY TO EVERYONE!!</p>

		<p>This is more evidence that if/when blacks become the majority, they will have no interest in being fair.  A minority is interested in minority rights only as long as they are a minority.  Once they achieve the upper hand, they do not intend to see to the welfare of anyone but themselves.  The inability of whites to see this is the beginning of the end.  We are 8% of the world&rsquo;s population, and we allow the 92% to continue to call themselves minorities.  How stupid can we get?</p>

		<p><i> The Commission uncovered numerous specific examples of open hostility and opposition within the department&rsquo;s Civil Rights Division to pursuing cases in which Whites were the victims</i></p>
<p>No one should be surprised by this, eric holder stated his exact intentions and delineated what he was going to do in a speech in front of the ADL:</p>
<p><i>Eric Holder&hellip;announced that, having spearheaded passage of The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Hate Crimes Prevention Act, it will now lead stage two, a massive national campaign to train lawyers to become Hate Crimes prosecutors.</i></p>
<p>You can be sure any persecution will be directed solely at non-homosexual Whites, who are considered NHs (non-humans) by Justice.</p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p><i>Holder said in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee He asserted that the hate bill does not protect</i> <b>Christian ministers, whites, heterosexuals, policemen and members of U.S. military.<b> <i>Only favored groups, he said, such as homosexuals, blacks, Latinos, Jews, Muslims, and women will benefit under this new law.</i></b></b></p>
<p>This racist liar went on in his &#8216;testimony&rsquo; to the Judicial Committee to state the following:</p>
<p><i>We will also continue to defend vigilantly the civil rights of all people in this country and prosecute criminal acts of discrimination wherever we find them.</i></p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/yau5mnh" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/yau5mnh</a></p>
<p><b>This</b>is what holder needs to be called on, his own words read back to him by a member of congress in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, made to answer for Justice&rsquo;s stonewalling, asked if &#8216;All People&rsquo; includes Whites, called on his refusal to demand work on cases involving White plaintiffs and dismissal of clear voter intimidation of Whites by a racist organization.</p>
<p>I consider Eric Holder and The Justice Department as Sworn Enemies of White Americans</p>
<p>AND, Tell Everyone You Know and Spread The Word.  There are no Civil Rights for Whites in the New Amerikan Order.</p>
<p>As #5 Hamstrung so pertinently writes:</p>
<p><i>Whites are targeted for punishing treatment and eventually violence. We are in very dangerous times, and all our troubles were predicted by our Race Realist fathers</i></p>
<p>Internalize this and remember these words every day.</p>
<p>Bon</p>

		<p>Blacks take care of their own, unlike white people. Wish we could be assertive and protect our people when they do things &#8220;considered&#8221; racist. We can&rsquo;t change black attitudes but we can reciprocate if we wanted to. </p>
<p>Hey, next time you have jury duty, remember, if the defendant is whites and victom isn&rsquo;t - take care of your own. They do.</p>
