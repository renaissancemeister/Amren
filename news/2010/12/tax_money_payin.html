<h1>Tax Money Paying for Jailed Illegal Immigrants&rsquo; Sex-Change Hormones</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christine Haas, KHOU-TV (Houston), December 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>While Texas lawmakers overturned legislation in 2006 that allowed inmates to receive Viagra with tax money, some inmates  &mdash;  including illegal immigrants  &mdash;  are still receiving prescribed sex hormones behind bars.</p>
<p>Jose Centeno is proof. He just became a U.S. citizen, but in 2009, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement detained him after investigating his immigration status and visa because of a previous felony drug conviction. ICE prescribed him sex hormones while he was locked up, because Centeno said it was medically necessary.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m transgender so I am taking female hormones,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not a choice, I was born, and I already knew I was born, in the wrong body, so it wasn&rsquo;t a choice  &mdash;  I need those meds/hormone therapy to be who I am, but it&rsquo;s not a choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Centeno is now known as Krystal. He appeared to be a woman when he was detained by immigration, and he still does. He has never had surgery to alter his gender and doesn&rsquo;t plan to, but his daily dose of the female hormone Premarin helps him appear like a woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first thing you see is the growth of facial hair  &mdash;  it slows down, it doesn&rsquo;t grow as fast as normal for a male,&#8221; Centeno said. &#8220;Of course with your breasts growing, your mind starts changing.&#8221;</p>
<p>That change comes at a price. Ultimately, tax money paid for the convicted felon  &mdash;  who wasn&rsquo;t a U.S. citizen  &mdash;  to maintain his appearance as a woman.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;When you have been taking hormones for so many years, suddenly you stop taking it, you start going back to the person you weren&rsquo;t happy with  &mdash;  then it turns into depression mode,&#8221; Centeno said.</p>
<p>{snip} But ICE did say that since 2006 it&rsquo;s aware of 45 transgendered detainees who&rsquo;ve been prescribed hormones.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that he doesn&rsquo;t want to have facial hair in prison  &mdash;  is that really something the taxpayers should be paying for?&#8221; McCaul [U.S. Congressman Michael McCaul] asked.</p>
<p>Transgendered people argued that the hormones are necessary and said the real concern is depression. {snip}</p>

		<p>Not only is this complete nonsense, but taking large doses of Premarin like this, quickly destroys a person&rsquo;s circulatory system, especially if they smoke (smoking is near universal behavior among prison inmates).</p>
<p>Also, &#8220;medical necessity&#8221; is a specific legal term having to do with if an insurance company has a specific legal obligation to pay, already determined by medical standards.  Desires of the patient have nothing to do with this.  And that goes double for political correctness.  It is most definitely NOT an agreed upon standard of care that transgendered freaks must obtain hormone therapy. And NO insurance company, except, it seems, the prison system, will pay for it.</p>

		<p>Here in Kalifornia prisons we have criminals that get hormone shots weekly that cost $700 a pop. Some judge in the past ruled that it&rsquo;s unconstitutional to deprive them of those drugs. </p>

		<p>The national suicide rate is 3%. The suicide rate for transgendered<br>
is 31%. This after they get everything they want to make them<br>
happy. It seems that the confusion and self destruction doesnt <br>
go away despite all the claims. Centeno/Crystal will most likely throw himself out of a 30 story window or tie a rope around his <br>
neck thats 3ft too short  I only hope he does it in Mexico<br>
not here. </p>

		<p>If Centeno is now Krystal..why doesnt the article say <br>
&#8220;Krystal said&hellip;&#8221;? Instead Centeno is apparently still Centeno.<br>
Clearly we have a case of &#8220;Change You Cant Quite Believe In&#8221; here.<br>
Is this another example of Obama election fraud? Debate needed.</p>

		<p>The key phrase is,&#8221;It&rsquo;s not a choice&#8221;&hellip;.I&rsquo;ve seen some people have the surgery and their lives did not turn out as they imagined it would,,They were still morbidly depressed&hellip;</p>

		<p>This is odd.  A friend who spent time in prison told me that if you have a tooth cavity they simply pull the tooth.  She lost several teeth as used candy addictions to suplements drug addiction.</p>
