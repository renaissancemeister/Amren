<h1><a href="https://www.wtop.com/?sid=2190164&amp;nid=116">Census Estimates US Population at 306M to 313M</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hope Yen, WTOP-FM (Washington, D.C.), December 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Census surprise? The government provided new estimates Monday showing the U.S. population grew to somewhere between roughly 306 million and 313 million over the last decade, acknowledging uncertainty due to rapid shifts in immigration.</p>
<p>The estimates, which are separate from the official 2010 census count, are based on a review of birth and death records as well as calculations of new immigrants as of April 1, 2010. Demographers say the range of numbers offers a rough guide to the official 2010 results that will be used to apportion House seats when they are released later this month.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The numbers show the nation&rsquo;s population ranged from 305.7 million to 307.4 million based on lower rates of immigration, which independent think-tanks such as the Pew Hispanic Center have said dropped off sharply recently due to the souring U.S. economy.</p>
<p>A mid-range estimate  &mdash;  which in previous census reports have typically come within 1-2 percent of the final count  &mdash;  puts the number at 308.5 million. Census estimates based on assumptions of higher levels of immigration place the nation&rsquo;s population between 310 million and 312.7 million.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>No breakdowns were provided Monday for states or local areas.</p>
<p>The estimates also indicate:</p>
<p>* Hispanics accounted for all the growth in the youth population in the last decade. In 2000, Hispanics made up 17 percent of the U.S. population under age 20. They now represent somewhere between 22 and 25 percent of that age group.</p>
<p>* There were roughly 40.9 million to 41.7 million blacks in the U.S., based on a tabulation that includes Hispanic blacks. That would put the share of blacks at roughly 13 percent of the U.S. population.</p>
<p>* Without Hispanics, the number of young people in the U.S. would have declined between 2000 and 2010. Based on the estimates, the non-Hispanic youth population declined somewhere between 1.25 million and 2.9 million.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kimball Brace, president of Election Data Services, said given the unpredictability in immigration suggested by Monday&rsquo;s estimates, Florida was likely to be more on the edge in gaining a second House seat. Also, because census estimates do not include U.S. military personnel and their families living overseas, he said a state with higher shares of Army posts, such as North Carolina, may prove to be an unexpected winner, as it was in 2000 when it beat out Utah for the last seat.</p>
<p>The census estimates released Monday  &mdash;  known as Demographic Analysis  &mdash;  have historically been used to assess the level of undercounts in the decennial census, which disproportionately misses children and black men. In recent censuses, they have also been used as one guidepost in the government&rsquo;s decisions whether to statistically adjust the census for known undercounts. Groves has ruled out making any adjustments in the 2010 census for purposes of reapportionment and redistricting.<br>

<p>It&rsquo;s important for readers to come to grips with just how efficiently the federal government has   &mdash;  - via a range of court decisions, legislated amnesties, birthight citizenship for illegal aliens, and non-enforcement   &mdash;  - ethnically cleansed (in effect) the troublesome white population in certain states   &mdash;  - and, in a just a few decades.</p>
<p>California is the supreme example:</p>
<p>California: 1960 percent non-Hispanic white: 92 <br>
See 1960 Census data for California; scroll to Table 14:<br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/2bvoy3a" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2bvoy3a</a><br>
[Calculation: White population  (14,455,230) divided by Total population (15,717,204) = 92 percent] </p>
<p>California: 2008 percent non-Hispanic white: 40<br>
&ldquo;Whites in state &#8216;below the replacement&rsquo; level,&rdquo; San Francisco Chronicle, June 5, 2010:<br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/2bucgtk" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2bucgtk</a></p>
<p>But those numbers do not convey the scope of the government&rsquo;s victory in its war against the white population. California white public school enrollment is now down to what must be a very gratifying 27 percent and falling:</p>
<p>SOURCE: Latino kids now majority in state&rsquo;s public schools<br>

<p>TPS (Temporary Protected Status) is one more formidable   &mdash;  - and often used   &mdash;  - tool for accelerating white disposession.</p>

		<p>Keep in mind the Census counts the number of bodies not whether a person is an American citizen or not.  Let&rsquo;s assume conservatively that the number of illegal aliens is around 20 million plus an equal number of green card holders and the actual US population of American citizens is around 270 million.  </p>

		<p>This demographic genocide  couldnt happen without the help of white race traitors. A very white REPUBLICAN Calif State Assemblyman said about the assemblyman who is sponsoring a ballot initative that would mirror  Arizonas 1070 bill that &#8221; He wont be able to do this very much longer because lily white districts like his are becoming extinct very soon&#8221;. </p>

		<p>&#8220;They breed like rats.&#8221; Sorry, but there is a whole world of truth in that statement. Their collective aim being to outnumber Americans in a generation or two, so they can in effect STEAL our nation out from under us. Totally making White Americans second-class citizens in politics and government.</p>

		<p>  Your shocking statistics tell all E Pluribus Pluribus. </p>
<p>  Many diversity liberals like Peter Schrag warmly welcome this demographic transformation: &ldquo;California, and indeed much of the West, is far ahead of the country, as it often has been &mdash; demographically, economically, politically, socially &mdash; and it points to a future in which the whole nation will look much like California does now: multi-ethnic, increasingly tolerant of gays and other minorities, more global in outlook, and more environmentally conscious.&rdquo; California Here We Come. .. <br>
  <br>
  Multicultural worshipping liberals like Schrag can&rsquo;t wait for the rest of the country to clone into smaller versions of California. To them America&rsquo;s future is bright  &mdash;   without the whites. </p>
<p>  So what can we look forward to? Increasing Third World conditions, erosion of educational systems, ramped crime, breakdown of infrastructure, unemployment, hyperinflation, increased ethnic and racial conflicts, and environmental degradation due to overpopulation.  This should all happen before the middle of this century, but long before then, I&rsquo;ll have gone to Confederate Heaven or a Frog will have come to Hell town.  </p>

<p>- This is a bald faced lie.  I have seen the growth in latinos by leaps and bounds, EVERY YEAR for the last ten years.  Now I cannot walk out my door without tripping all over latinos, all over the place.</p>
<p>Every school around here, in this big northeast coast city is bursting at the seams with latino kids.  Many hundreds of schools here are now 90-100% latino.  It&rsquo;s funny watching black people sneering at the latinos and making rude comments to them, because the latinos are pushing them aside, as well.</p>
<p>We, my friends, (both white and black) have been conquered.  Sad thing is, we&rsquo;ve been conquered by a meztizo population that is of a much lower IQ so there will be no Renaissance after the coming Dark Age of famine, food shortages, societal breakdown and loss of governing authority.</p>

		<p>Paul Ehrlich&rsquo;s POPULATION BOMB, published around 1970, brainwashed the baby boomer generation and those behind us. Two-child families do NOT produce a stable white population; they produce a DECLINING white population. Why? Because 25% of white families have NO children. Suppose you have 200 million white people, 75% of whom have two children and 25% of whom have no children. The next generation of whites will be 150 million and  fewer with each succeeding generation. This is why the mainline Protestant churches are dropping. Ten million Methodists in the 1950s dropped to 7 1/2 million Methodists in the following  generation, and are heading lower. The only reason evangelical church membership is still growing is because many do not stop with two children.</p>
<p>We white baby boomers are going to have to play hardball with our children who are in their twenties and early thirties. &#8220;We want LOTS of grandchildren!&#8221; and &#8220;No grandchildren, no inheritance.&#8221; Check out the Duggar Family, the Bates Family (gilbatesfamily.com), and other Quiverfull families. It takes guts to have lots of children. My wife and I hope to start an organization to put together Quiverfull families and families with few or no grandchildren. This organization will help funnel<br>
financial resources to those of us with the courage to BREED!!!</p>
