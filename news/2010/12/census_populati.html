	<p>Contact: Steven A. Camarota, sac@cis.org, (202)466-8185</p>
<p>WASHINGTON (December 21, 2010)  &mdash;  Most of the media coverage of the 2010 Census will likely focus on the country&rsquo;s changing racial composition and the redistribution of seats in Congress. But neither of these is the most important finding. Rather, it is the dramatic increase in the size of the U.S. population itself that has profound implications for our nation&rsquo;s quality of life and environment. Most of the increase has been, and will continue to be, a result of one federal policy: immigration. Projections into the future from the Census Bureau show we are on track to add 130 million more people to the U.S. population in the just the next 40 years, primarily due to future immigration.</p>
<p>* Immigration accounted for three-quarters of population growth during the decade. Census Bureau data found 13.1 million new immigrants (legal and illegal) who arrived in the last 10 years; there were also about 8.2 million births to immigrant women during the decade. [1]</p>
<p>* The numerical increase of 27.3 million this decade is exceeded by only two other decades in American history.</p>
<p>* Without a change in immigration policy, the nation is projected to add roughly 30 million new residents each decade for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>* Assuming the current ratio of population to infrastructure, adding roughly 30 million each decade will mean:</p>
<p>  &mdash;  building and paying for 8,000 new schools every 10 years;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  developing land to accommodate 11.5 million new housing units every 10 years;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  constructing enough roads to handle 23.6 million more vehicles every 10 years.</p>
<p>* While our country obviously can &#8220;fit&#8221; more people, and technology and planning can help manage the situation, forcing such high population growth through immigration policy has profound implications for the environment, traffic, congestion, sprawl, water quality, and the loss of open spaces.</p>
<p>* Forcing population growth also impacts how our democracy functions. A 27 million increase in the U.S. population increases the number of constituents a member of the US House must serve by 62,000. The effect on the state legislatures and local governments is also considerable.</p>
<p>* While immigration is making our population much larger and our country more densely settled, it has only a modest impact on slowing the aging of our society. It must be remembered that native-born Americans, unlike couples in most other developed countries, still have about 2 children on average. [2]</p>
<p>* Census Bureau data collected earlier this year showed that the 13.1 million immigrants who arrived in the last 10 years, plus all of the children they had once in the country, have reduced the average age in the United States slightly, from 37.4 years to 36.8 years. [3]</p>
<p>* As the Census Bureau stated in its population projections published in 2000, immigration is a &#8220;highly inefficient&#8221; means for addressing the problem of an aging society in the long run. The updated projections done in 2008 show the same thing. [4]</p>
<p>End Notes</p>
<p>[1] The public use file of the March 2010 Current Population Survey collected by the Census Bureau shows 13.1 million foreign born individuals living in the United States who arrived in 2000 or later. It also shows 8.3 million children born in the United States to immigrant mothers over that same time period.</p>
<p>[2] The public use file of the American Community Survey collected by the Census Bureau from 2006 to 2008 shows that the average U.S.-born woman had 2.01 children. The statistic is referred to as the Total Fertility Rate.</p>
<p>[3] These figures are based on the public use file of the March 2010 Current Population Survey.</p>

		<p>What the article failed to mention is, the economy has to create 225,000 jobs a month just to keep up with the influx of immigrations. Of course I realize that not all immigrants will need or want a job, but someone has to work to support those immigrants that don&rsquo;t..</p>

		<p>Why is it that these people who go on and on about how its racist to reduce immigration don&rsquo;t seem to care about wild animals. The more humans we bring in the more wild areas have to be occupied by people. This will result in reducing the amount of trees and animals in the country, what about the rights of the wildlife? With enough of a population increase we could see our national parks destroyed. The open borders crowd don&rsquo;t seem to care about non-human life.</p>

		<p>The power mongers and the money mongers in the government and the corporate world would kill if they had to in order to maintain a constantly growing nation of taxpayers and consumers, especially those that can provide peon labor at starvation wages. </p>
<p>Their theory is that a constant inflow of third world hordes will provide them the fuel for their engines of power and greed, but as usual they&rsquo;re ignoring the long term negative effects these people and policies place on resources, quality of living and a general dumbing down of the population.  </p>
<p>But, they don&rsquo;t care as long as they can continue benefitting from the chaos all this causes in so many ways.</p>
<p>They pound on few other things more than they do growth and they get near hysterical when it has slowed to insignificant levels.  That &#8220;growth&#8221; of any nation cannot be maintained forever without reaching crictical mass regarding absolutely vital resources like food and water bothers them not one iota.  As with everything else, they&rsquo;re incapable of giving up one penny or one small vestige of power in order to pull back into a population control mode and working toward sustaining a smaller more viable population, rather than one that expands into infinity and can&rsquo;t be sustained indefinitely.<br>
 <br>
Only a financial collapse of epic proportions, and the ensuing chaos that is certain to follow in its path, will rid this country of elitist fools and government power mongers. And it still looks certain that the Greatest Depression is still on its way and will visit us soon.</p>

		<p>In short, there is NO good reason to allow any more immigrants, legal or illegal, to come here.  We already knew there was NO good reason to allow those who came here illegally to REMAIN here, and every reason to expel them post haste.  This review ends the arguments thrown at us by the liberals&hellip;.even the &#8220;greenies&#8221; and the &#8220;environmental wackos&#8221; have no leg to stand on vis a vis sanctioning illegals or any more immigrants.</p>

<p>Absolutely!  Where will all this growth madness end?  When every last square foot of earth is paved over with asphalt and turned into parking lots for their sprawling suburban shopping centers? How many billions of population will finally satisfy them?  When we are fighting each other for a little space, and a little food, and light, and air, and water?  Will our cities become Calcuttas?  Will we end up looking like Bangla Desh?</p>
<p>There has to be a stop somewhere.  When humans don&rsquo;t have the intelligence to do it for ourselves, as Malthus pointed out, Mother Nature will do it for us, the ruthless way. Nature is not worried about being kind!<br>

The numbers will be good for the people the GOP cares about.  They will make higher profits because of the higher prices and lower wages a high rate of immigration causes.  </p>

<p>You are correct.  But ecological destruction will not be the tipping factor.  That will be energy.  The world is running out of it.  Already, the USA must import billions of gallons of oil to support its 307 million inhabitants.  What will happen in 25 years when there is significantly less crude in the ground, when China and India take a larger share of dwindling oil supplies, and the USA has an additional 70 million new immigrants?  </p>
<p>Already there is not enough water, land, lumber, garbage landfill, or oil to go around.  What will we do when things are 10 times worse?  </p>
<p>Your children will die in Middle East wars to steal dwindling supplies of oil from Muslims so that Mexicans can come to the USA and drive sports utility vehicles.  It is pure insanity.</p>
<p>And by the way, ethanol and wind power are NOT cost-effective and will not save us.  Each requires more energy, money, input, and maintainance than we get out of it.  Basically, it costs 1 gal of gasoline-equivalent to produce 3/4 gal ethanol    &mdash;   an energy deficit. To produce ethanol, we actually have to import or use MORE oil (or coal or electric, or nuclear), not less!<br>

<p>Yes.  And it is very east to measure the potential of each immigrant group for adding to, or subtracting from, our economy and culture.  Simply measure their productivity and culture back in their home country. If it is very high, then these people will benefit the USA.  If it is low (for example if the home country is mired in poverty and social dysfunction), then importing these people will harm the USA.  </p>
<p>It is so easy!  Simply choose immigrants who can improve the USA, not drag it down.  </p>

		<p>The census was designed to not detect illegals, so how do they come up with these numbers? There were no questions about citizenship, place of birth, or length of residency.</p>
<p>Census data on Hispanics is guaranteed to be wrong. The census form had two questions in a row. Question 8 was, [b]&#8221;Please look at[/b] [a list of Hispanic countries such as Puerto Rico, Cuba, Mexico]. [b]Is (Name) of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin?&#8221;[/b] Question 9 was, [b]&#8221;Please look at [/b][a list of races such as White, Eskimo, Pacific Islander, Korean][b] and choose one or more races. For this census, Hispanic origin is not a race. What is (Name&rsquo;s) race?&#8221;[/b]</p>
<p>Census expected Hispanics to answer Yes to 8 and then specify their origin: Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, etc. But the vast majority of Hispanics said &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; and refused to be more specific. I know of no one who claimed to be Mexican.</p>
<p>Hispanic respondents were baffled by the claim in Question 9, &#8220;Hispanic origin is not a race.&#8221; Instead of identifying their race (White, African American, American Indian, etc.), they said their race was &#8220;Hispanic,&#8221; which was not on the list of races. So Hispanics were written in under &#8220;other,&#8221; and &#8220;other&#8221; was specified &#8220;Hispanic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Printed information in Spanish, and language interpreters were provided without hesitation to anyone who wanted it.</p>
<p>The census office routinely &#8220;lost&#8221; dozens blocks of residences, counted some 2-3-4 times. Maybe they eliminated duplicates.</p>
<p>Census data on race and Latinos is likely unreliable.</p>

__  __  __  __  __  </p>
<p>Agreed.  All of this is manifestly true, and there can be no argument.</p>
<p>But it is necessary to remember that economics are only one factor to consider; and those who are hell-bent on de-whitening and de-Christianizing America, do not necessarily care about that. They have other motives. </p>
<p>To those with an agenda who are motivated by ideological reasons (or by sheer hatred), it is a goal worthy of being achieved<i>  AT ANY COST.  </i>And to hell with the economy, wild animals, nature, polution, fuel, water, space, energy, imported diseases, or any other consideration!</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll cross those bridges when they come to them. In the meantime, the flooding and minoritizing of white America seems to be the number one priority.  They&rsquo;ll take one step at a time.</p>

		<p> America&rsquo;s infrastructure cannot be repaired and upgraded fast enough to handle this kind of growth for a sustained period of time. At some point the deterioation will result in a cascade of huge disasters. This fact and the runaway defecits may destroy America as we know it.<br>
 Highways, bridges, dams, powerplants and the electrical grid will be taxed beyond their engineer designs and ultimately fail.<br>
 Illegal immigration must be stopped and illegal aliens deported, the 1965 immigration act repealed and legal immigration severely curtailed for at least a decade in order to catch our collective breath.<br>
 There are billions of people around the world that feel coming to America, collecting unearned benefits( food stamps, welfare, unemployment, guaranteed medical benefits, section 8 subsidised housing etc&hellip;.) is their right the moment they step onto American soil. These need to be stopped, they were meant to help people get on their feet and fend for themselves not as a multigenerational handout.</p>
