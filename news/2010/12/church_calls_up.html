			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Yakub Qureshi, Manchester Evening News, December 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Church leaders want to reclaim St George&rsquo;s Day from the far right  &mdash;  with a street parade led by a black puppet of England&rsquo;s patron saint.</p>
<p>Clergy at Manchester Cathedral believe the BNP and English Defence League have &#8216;hijacked&rsquo; the religious festival.</p>
<p>And they plan to fight back with a festival of puppets and poets on Sunday, May 8.</p>
<p>A Catalan-style procession will snake through the city, with jazz music and giant versions of George and the dragon, led by a puppet inspired by a painting in the cathedral by contemporary artist Mark Cazalet.</p>
<p>The altarpiece, created in 2001, depicts the saint as a young black man cutting free the restraints of a pitiful dragon.</p>
<p>The puppets are being built by homeless people who use the Booth Centre charity, linked to the cathedral.</p>
<p>The day will include a reading by Andrew Motion, the former Poet Laureate, of a specially-commissioned work.</p>
<p>The carnival is also inspired by epic Elizabethan poem The Faerie Queene, which re-tells St George&rsquo;s legend.</p>
<p>Church leaders said the idea was to show English nationalism should be about &#8216;tolerance and opening up to people&rsquo;  &mdash;  and not stirring up racial division.</p>
<p>Canon Andrew Shanks, from the cathedral, said he and other churchmen wanted to help &#8216;rebrand&rsquo; St George&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;I remember the BNP had a big rally in one of the squares in Manchester a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;It felt very ugly. There were all these St George&rsquo;s flags  &mdash;  and the same flag was on our tower.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a war going on about the flag and the meaning of it and we are doing our damnedest to interpret it our way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Canon Shanks said the church&rsquo;s &#8216;challenging&rsquo; painting of St George in a housing estate is about &#8216;unlocking passion for urban renewal&rsquo;. He said: &#8220;We have taken that as inspiration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anglican vicars face an unusual problem next year as St George&rsquo;s Day  &mdash;  traditionally April 23  &mdash;  will clash with Easter Saturday.</p>
<p>Many parishes are opting to mark St George&rsquo;s Day in May instead.</p>
<p><b>An English hero with true global appeal</b></p>
<p>DESPITE being England&rsquo;s patron saint, St George was actually born in Turkey and lived in Palestine.</p>
<p>Little is known for sure about his life, but according to myth he became a Roman soldier and was beheaded for his Christian beliefs in 303 AD.</p>
<p>Revered throughout the Christian church, he is also patron saint of Georgia, Malta and Portugal, as well as soldiers, farm workers, lepers and the modern Scout movement.</p>
<p>Although far-right English groups have attempted to adopt him as a symbol, it is thought he was black and of Middle Eastern descent.</p>
<p>The most famous myth about him  &mdash;  that he killed a dragon while riding a white horse  &mdash;  probably developed in the 14th Century.<br>

		<p>In Gibbon&rsquo;s &#8220;The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&#8221; the origin of St. George is cited as having been a very questionable figure who had a myth thrust upon him years later.  This is what comes of insisting on Christian identity for Europeans; we were conquered by a religion whose roots are in the Middle East.  It is established to the point that most Northern European flags have some form of a Christian cross on its flag.  That Christian motifs are part of subsequent European art and literature - culture is undeniable.  The problem it presents for nationalists is well illustrated by the story and the problem for white nationalists this article presents.  I doubt that the break with Christianity by nationalists will come in time to save the white race, but there are a few of us out there.</p>

<p>It is their country, isn&rsquo;t it? And they can fly their flag in their country, can&rsquo;t they? And George is their patron saint, isn&rsquo;t he?</p>
<p>Yes, George was black. Hannibal was black. One of the three wise men was black, Beethoven was black, etc., etc., etc.</p>

		<p>They seem to think that anyone born outside the contemporary boundaries of Europe MUST be black for some reason.  It&rsquo;s a well known fact that good portions of modern day Turkey were essentially Greek up until 500 years ago.   How they come up with St. George being black in a land where there were no blacks except for a some slaves, I don&rsquo;t know.    </p>

Yet another example of blacks expropriating white culture.</p>
<p>This highlights the fact that blacks don&rsquo;t have the creativity or history to create anything of their own.</p>
<p>I hope the white community boycotts such events. They should all don tee shirts with the iconic image and just go about their daily lives.</p>
<p>If the church wants to defile their own history, whites can claim the true St. George for themselves.</p>

<p>Oh, sure, because there were plenty of blacks in Anatolia in the 300&rsquo;s AD.  (I refuse to call it &#8220;Turkey&#8221; because, during St. George&rsquo;s lifetime, there wasen&rsquo;t a single dirty Turk in the whole region)</p>
<p>To poster #1 (&#8220;whiteplight&#8221;) - I&rsquo;m sorry, but I fail to see how one can be a nationalist and at the same time reject the religion which has defined Western civilization for nearly two thousand years.  Do explain.  Because I really would love to know why you call yourself a nationalist and reject our culture and religion.  The nation is made up of three things; A people (race/ethnicity), a government, and a culture (which is largely defined by religion).  Without the religion, there&rsquo;s little point in saving the nation at all.  And besides, the work we have ahead of us is so great, how can we hope to accoplmish anything without the help of God?  You should read the Bible sometime, if you haven&rsquo;t already.  It really isn&rsquo;t a liberal book at all, its only the idiotic interpretations of liberal and evangelical pastors that lead modenr Christianity to appear weak and liberal-minded.</p>
<p>If you need specific examples of how one can be a very faithful Christian, a Fundamentalist even, and still be against miscegenation, immigration, pro-segregation, etc., just look at our nation&rsquo;s past.  While, sure, a lot of pastors were against slavery, for example, nearly as many supported it.  The Bible doesn&rsquo;t even condemn slavey; in fact, it contains slave codes!  Many churches used to be segregated, and some even had men stand by the doors to keep blacks out (that was a bit extreme for me, but still it proves my point).  I have even found a website that used numerous Biblical passages to argue that miscegenation is wicked and a great folly (http://goo.gl/iIyCZ).</p>
<p>So, don&rsquo;t discount Christianity as a threat; it is our greatest asset.  I used to think that nationalism was a lost cause.  I had no real hope that we would ever win anything.  But now, now that I have begun reading the Bible, praying frequently, and attending churh every week, I have nothing but hope and optimism for the future.</p>

		<p>St George was a rather dubious historical figure of non English descent.  The original and probably correct patron saint of England is St Edmund who was white and Anglo Saxon.  His day is November 20.  For us true Englisc the White Dragon of England is our flag and neither George nor Edmund is necessarily our Patron Saint. Was Hael.</p>

<p>With all due respect, I don&rsquo;t think that going back to the worship of ancient European &#8220;gods&#8221; like Thor and Zeus will help us any. Europe was at its zenith (confident, proud, inventive, artistic and powerful) while it was a Christian continent. </p>
<p>The whole idea of donning a viking helm and reaching out to Thor seems rather inorganic and just plain ridiculous. However, I will admit that the modern &#8220;churches&#8221; have much blood on their hands for inviting non-whites into North America and Europe.</p>

		<p>   The Catholic church was in its heyday when Charles Martel was able to convince the church to back him when he started driving muslims out of Europe. Since then, it has been corrupted by many outside influences. I stopped being identified as a Catholic a long time ago. The church is in a state of rapid decline. I tend to agree with Whiteplight. I also, tend to lean toward nationalism WITHOUT christianity. I don&rsquo;t know if I would identify myself as a pagan or an agnostic. I tend to believe in the Christian God, but I feel Christianity has been hi-jacked.  </p>

		<p>I believe the point is being missed here. The church is for once telling the truth about it&rsquo;s real agenda. The dragon has always, from the beginning of Christianity, symbolized Satan who is the author of sin and discord, and the enemy of Christianity and our souls. The white Saint George slaying the dragon symbolizes European Christianity upholding the virtues of God by slaying Satan. The black &#8216;Saint George&rsquo; symbolizes the embracing of Satan along with his sin and lies. Any &#8216;church&rsquo; or &#8216;Christian&rsquo; who espouses the black Saint George symbolization is in effect saying that they prefer Satan over God. Brought to it&rsquo;s logical conclusion, this &#8216;church&rsquo; is saying that all white European Christians who believe in the slaying or chaining up of Satan are evil while the non-white races who are releasing Satan&rsquo;s evil all over the European continent are good. An upside down &#8216;church&rsquo; if there ever was one but not surprising considering the mental state of those running the Christian churches anymore. </p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Yes, and even if you go to Turkey today you won&rsquo;t see any black people there now. Nor is the population of the Middle East originally black either   &mdash;   especially back then before modern times, before the Arab invasions, etc.  </p>
<p>What a bunch of nonsense. They just say whatever they WANT to believe.  Or,  as B. Obongo put it, &#8220;some governmedia flunkie&rsquo;s overheated PC imagination.&#8221;  I can&rsquo;t improve on that!</p>

		<p>A dragon being freed by a saint?  In Christian symbolism, the dragon represents evil, the devil, sin, wickedness, false worship, etc. It seems the Church of England is so debased, it doesn&rsquo;t understand or willfully corrupts Christian symbology.<br>

<p>There&rsquo;s no need for anachronistic clothing or behavior in the revival of European spiritualism.  This would be the first thing adversaries would seize on to ridicule and criticize.</p>
<p>The main point of a European spiritualism is to go forward, not back. </p>
