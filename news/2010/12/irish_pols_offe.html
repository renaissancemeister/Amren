<h1><a href="https://bostonherald.com/news/politics/view.bg?articleid=1300275&amp;position=0">Irish Pols Offended by Chuck Turner&rsquo;s Rant</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dave Wedge, Boston Herald, December 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hub leaders past and present got their Irish up yesterday over Chuck Turner&rsquo;s rant as he was bounced from the City Council, when he blamed his ouster on &#8220;the Irish&#8221; and sought to cast himself as a martyr cut from the same cloth as the legendary Mayor James Michael Curley.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a fiery plea to keep his job, Turner compared himself to Curley, a former congressman and governor who was elected mayor despite a felony conviction. The Roxbury politician said the struggle of blacks is similar to the oppression the Irish endured under Yankee rule.</p>
<p>&#8220;The law has been used to persecute the Irish in this very city,&#8221; Turner said during a turbulent City Hall hearing that ended his 11-year run on the council. &#8220;That&rsquo;s why they re-elected James Michael Curley when he was in jail. They knew the laws were controlled by the Yankees.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ethnically mixed council, which includes five members with Irish surnames, voted 11-to-1 on a motion by President Michael Ross to expel Turner, marking the first time the board has booted a member.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those Irish men and women forgot their history,&#8221; Turner bellowed outside City Hall last night, referring to the council. &#8220;James Michael Curley is ashamed of his descendants.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Turner&rsquo;s ouster, which is effective tomorrow, follows his conviction last month on federal corruption charges for taking a $1,000 payoff and lying to federal agents. Turner, 69, used his final speech on the council floor to rail against the media and federal government, claiming he was targeted as part of a ploy to &#8220;take down&#8221; black elected officials.</p>

		<p>Governor Curley, a rascal, crook and excellent public CEO of Boston and Massachusetts, did his time. He didn&rsquo;t whine. Sure he used his friends to get a pardon from Truman. Let this slimeball who has hustled federal &#8220;poverty&#8221; programs in Boston since the late sixties, get a pardon from Obama, whose dreadful illegal aunt who lives on welfare in Mass. blabs she deserves citizenship and public assistance forever.</p>
<p>I desperately want Hussein Obama to pardon the slimy Turner. It will expose Barry for the utter fraud he is.</p>

A corrupt black man twisting the white mans history to make himself into a victim and martyr. Why is this news?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not familiar with the topic but did the Irish practice black slavery in Ireland? Why is this man even in Ireland?</p>

<p>This perception is vastly exaggerated? Tip O&rsquo;Neill and the NONA [no Irish need apply signs], etc.</p>

		<p>I note that the Irish pols on the Boston City Council were nearly unanimous in condemning this Bantu crook. Good! Maybe in liberal Boston, whites there are finally starting to rub the sleep out of their eyes.</p>
<p>This Bantu crook was right in comparing himself to James Michael Curley in one respect - both were crooks. I&rsquo;m surprised this Bantu didn&rsquo;t compare himself to Jesus Christ.</p>
