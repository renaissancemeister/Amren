<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>AN AUSTRALIAN-produced documentary aims to debunk racist theories on skin colour by asserting that light-skinned people are mutants of their black ancestors, and there is no such thing as race.</p>
<p>The film explores how skin colour is an &#8220;evolutionary balancing act&#8221;, protecting the body from harmful ultraviolet rays but also ensuring it gets enough sunlight to produce essential vitamin D.</p>
<p>Based on 20 years of research by American anthropologist Nina Jablonski, the SBS documentary will show mass migration of people from Africa to countries further away from the equator, with lower UV levels, caused people&rsquo;s skin pigmentation to lighten over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our original ancestral configuration as a species was dark pigmentation, that is our heritage. So, all of the people who have lightly pigmented skin in Europe and Eastern Asia, and their descendants, those we can think of as mutants,&#8221; Professor Jablonski told The Sunday Age from her home in Pennsylvania, where she teaches at Penn State University.</p>
<p>The documentary, Skin Deep, explains that skin colour must balance the body&rsquo;s need for two vitamins critical to human survival.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has to protect a person against the damage to DNA and breakdown of folic acid caused by ultraviolet radiation, and at the same time it has to permit some ultraviolet radiation to penetrate into the skin to make Vitamin D. The amount of pigment that you have in the skin is a balancing act, a compromise between those two conflicting needs,&#8221; Professor Jablonski said.</p>
<p>Vitamin D aids development and bone strength while folic acid is essential to reproductive success, protecting against birth defects such as spina bifida.</p>
<p>Putting a new spin on traditional notions of race, Professor Jablonski said pigmentation was an &#8220;evolutionary flexible&#8221; trait, adaptable to the environment to ensure survival of the species. &#8220;What that means for racism and our social interpretation of skin is that skin colour changes quickly and you can have lightly pigmented people who became lightly pigmented at different points and places in our evolutionary history. So you can&rsquo;t really refer to somebody as belonging to a white race or a black race because these pigmentation events have occurred more than once and the whole idea that pigmentation equals race is simply nonsense,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Professor Jablonski&rsquo;s research into skin colour began while teaching at the University of Western Australia in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>She said early migrants to Australia from Northern Europe paid the price for being naturally mismatched to their environment: suffering terrible sunburn and skin cancer.</p>
<p>But because they mostly lived off the land, their diet was high in folate, which helped them to survive.</p>
<p>However, without the advent of sun protection and sunscreen, their skin colour may have darkened over generations to adapt to the environment, Professor Jablonski said.</p>
<p>The documentary crew also visited Kenya to interview the black parents of two albino girls, Grace and Martha. Professor Jablonski said the girls - who are a thousand times more likely to get skin cancer - were fortunate their family was well-educated and know to protect them from the sun.</p>
<p>Melbourne-based director Franco Di Chiera said the documentary had the potential to completely change the way we view race. &#8220;Our perceptions of what that means have created a lot of conflict in the world but at the same time what that has meant is that modern science has been loath to explore issues related to skin colour because it&rsquo;s such a sensitive subject,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Professor Jablonski&rsquo;s work has largely been well received around the world but she has also received hate mail from white supremacists.<br>

		<p>Professor Jablonski is a primatologist, an evolutionary biologist, and a paleontologist, who has made a specialty of studying what is only skin deep.</p>
<p>She is not professionally qualified on the many facets of race other than skin pigment. </p>
<p>Speaking as a layman, she unwittingly gets one obvious thing right: &#8220;the whole idea that pigmentation equals race is simply nonsense&#8221;.  </p>

		<p>I would like to see them create a documentary that analyzes the genome, especially from the medical aspect and try to generalize away racial differences this way.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, without the advent of sun protection and sunscreen, their skin colour may have darkened over generations to adapt to the environment, Professor Jablonski said.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hmmm, apparently MAY is a big word here.  I believe I can think of a number of instances where people have survived without sunscreen during successive generations whose faces did not turn permanently dark.  And I think I can think of some people who have lived in the far north and not become completely white (Eskimos, Aleutians, Mongols, etc.).  One has to wonder out of what kindergarten these experts graduated?  I guess you can say anything that comes to mind if it is superficially, pseudo-scientific sounding - if it fits a PC qualifier.</p>

Ok, I&rsquo;ll bite.</p>
<p>If white skin is a mutation, is it not conceivable that other mutations happened along the way too?</p>
<p>If skin color mutated, is it possible that other mutations occurred as well making us even more different than just skin color?</p>
<p>Far from proving we&rsquo;re all the same, this research shows that real mutations have occurred and differences in IQ are equally possible.</p>
<p>Be careful what your research claims. </p>

		<p><i>AN AUSTRALIAN-produced documentary aims to debunk racist theories on skin colour</i></p>
<p>Right from the first sentence this article shows it&rsquo;s bias. Isn&rsquo;t &#8220;racism&#8221; inherently evil? Yet that&rsquo;s the term this article applies to the old &#8220;theories,&#8221; implying the new one, therefore, must be good!</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s really nothing new about this theory, anyway. All it is is the old &#8220;race is nothing more than skin color&#8221; theory, which has been thoroughly debunked in AR through the years. </p>
<p>An African albino wouldn&rsquo;t pass as a white person, for example. The differences between the races in terms of bone structure, skull structure, facial features, susceptibility to various diseases, etc. are too numerous to list here.</p>
<p><i> Professor Jablonski said the girls - who are a thousand times more likely to get skin cancer - were fortunate their family was well-educated and know to protect them from the sun.</i></p>
<p>This sentence is laughably revealing of how Jablonski actually views the intellect of black persons. Why does one need to be well-educated to know what is common sense? Jablonski obviously doesn&rsquo;t think those &#8220;dark-skinned people&#8221; are very smart.</p>

		<p>What a complete load of lies. I am sick of this &ldquo;races are only skin deep&rdquo; and that &ldquo;there is only the human race&rdquo;. My favorite is &ldquo;race is just a social construct&rdquo; ha-ha!</p>
<p>How moronic are people these days? Anyone who has ever opened a science book can tell you that there are major differences between different races. No one would question that robins and blue jays are very distinct and different creatures, yet if birds were like us, they would claim their differences were only &ldquo;feather deep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mutant? This only shows more and more her inability to separate her social beliefs from science.  Mutations are part of evolution, if anything, we are not mutants, and we are simply more evolved. No, the dark people my ancestors sprang from are not my heritage, no more than monkeys are my heritage. Why? Because we became something else, something more. Europeans and East Asians built civilizations that the African mind could not even understand. Race does matter Madam, just look at Western and East Asian country and compare one of them to any black nation on the planet. Seems like a mighty massive and thorough coincidence does it not? Why is it that Asians and Westerners outperform blacks in every area? </p>
<p>The problem is many young whites are easily influenced by this propoganda. I am the only young white (17) that I know who doesn&rsquo;t believe these lies. <br>

<p>On the one hand there is no such thing as race.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, &ldquo;Professor Jablonski&rsquo;s work has largely been well received around the world but she has also received hate mail from white supremacists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it when you want to dump on white people there is such a thing as race, and white people have it right down to the very core of their evil being.  White people are the evil people with white skin and are the only people that have the genetic makeup to be racists.    </p>
<p>Who was the guy that started the idea that race was only skin color anyway.  Blacks, Whites, and Orientals differ in many respects, skin color being only one way to tell them apart.  See p. 9 of J. Philippe Rushton&rsquo;s RACE, EVOLUTION, and BEHAVIOR (http://www.charlesdarwinresearch.org/Race_Evolution_Behavior.pdf).</p>

		<p>Professor Jablonski is either stupid or he is a cultural Marxist with a political agenda. But we are not all the same under the skin as Jablonski and other Marxists would have you believe.</p>
<p>All humans may have originated in the Great Rift Valley of East Africa. But when European and Asian ancestors headed north to harsher climates, they had to develop &#8220;smarts&#8221; to survive. The stupid ones perished. Life was harder. They could no longer simply reach up and pull a cocoanut from a tree and expect nature&rsquo;s bounty to be dumped into their laps. They had to WORK hard to survive. They had to learn to SAVE and hoard resources against seasonal changes and unpredictable crop failures. They had to learn to be INVENTIVE.</p>
<p>In sub-Sahara Africa, seasons were more consistent and predictable, living was easy, and there was no selection for the more intelligent ones to survive. This is why so many blacks have i.q.s which are 15-20 points lower than those of Europeans/Asians. This is why they are such poor workers and savers. This is why blacks still have their hands out, waiting to be taken care of by the government. A welfare state simulates the life they had in Africa, in which nature&rsquo;s bounty was dumped into their laps.<br>

		<p>The title, while this is a triviality, just goes to show that writing a mere six words without a basic logical error is too much for them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Different Colours, but the Same Skin&#8221; is obviously oxymoronic- if they&rsquo;re different colors, then they&rsquo;re not the same. They could be similar due to other traits, but they cannot be the same.</p>
<p>Egalitarians deal scathing (albeit not fully coherent) criticisms of the supposed &#8220;pseudoscience&#8221; of anything objective about race and intelligence or behavior, but they&rsquo;re obviously the ones at fault here. The fact that they hide behind the rhetorical clout of &#8220;skin color&#8221; just goes to show that they aren&rsquo;t ready to or capable of dealing with the actual issues at hand.</p>
<p>As for skin pigmentation changing with time- more nonsense, and a trick out of their old bag. Egalitarian anthropologist Franz Boas once sought to disprove that skull shape varied racially, and provided some studies about how climate changed the skull shape of immigrants outside the latitude they evolved in. The studies would have been interesting, had they not been completely fraudulent, like the majority of his work.</p>

		<p>This documentary, supposedly based on &#8220;scientific research&#8221; is just more PC propaganda to explain light skin as a &#8220;weakness&#8221; and portraying whites as &#8220;mutants&#8221;. According to Jablonski, supposedly the world would be a better place today had all humans never evolved and just stayed in Africa. And note the last sentence implying that the only people who have disagreed are hate mail sending white supremacists.      </p>

		<p>In which case I suppose that the fact that all finalists in the Olympic 100m sprint since 1980 have been of West African descent, is also just a coincidence and a mere perception. </p>
<p>Or could it be possible that the same evolutionary processes that led to straight hair, blue eyes and light skin also led to changes under the proverbial engine hood? </p>
<p>What are the chances, after all, that there would not be internal changes - weaker leg muscles for example - that led to the 100m Olympic anomaly?</p>

		<p>I remember having a conversation with a British backpacker here<br>
(in Australia) several years ago and we discussed the interesting<br>
idea of Aussies gradually getting a darker skin over  several<br>
generations as alluded to in this documentary..<br>
  That was as far as our conversation went but to then read this <br>
and note the massive oversimplification the esteemed professor <br>
appears to make from a fairly plausible initial observation is disappointing to say the least.I suspect the one world.one people. one race PC lobby have also had a fair amount of influence in the outcome of this initial observation .<br>
    Aussies of European decent  with a dark tan are still a race utterly distinct from sub Saharan Africans and we dont need to look at just skin pigmentation to see why&hellip;how about a Han Chinese or Scandinavian?,,,why dont we just discard the word race as irrelevant even though the vast majority of the six billion inhabitants of this planet seem to be  very very aware of the word  and identify with a particular racial group,whether<br>
consciously or just by habit etc . <br>
..The director remarks&hellip;. modern science has been loath to explore issues related to skin colour because it&rsquo;s such a sensitive subject&hellip;surely he`s not alluding to such sensitive matters such as `race and IQ` and/or `color of crime etc       <br>

 <br>
White supremacists = Hate Mail. I&rsquo;d like to see some of this &#8216;hate mail&rsquo; published as it comes. An attempt to debunk  race propaganda doesnt always add up to &#8216;hate mail&rsquo;. But that of course is the surest cop out way of offering debate on the matter. What these &#8216;researchers&rsquo; seem  never  able to explain  are the differences shown  in intelligence and temperament.It would seem from whatever climate blacks are reared in they consistently fall down on all fronts when compared to everyone else, be they Caucasians, Orientals, Middle easterners, Asians&hellip; Other than this, everyone is just racist toward black people. The  other claims  for evolutionary change of skin pigmentation  are also still open to debate. New discoveries are being made all  the time and until we are able to collate  and add up  ALL  these findings, we should keep our counsel. </p>

<p>A lot of times, I think the &#8220;received &#8216;hate mail&rsquo; from &#8216;white supremacists&rsquo;&#8221; bromide is used by real scientists who really want to broach the taboo of racial differences, but want to triangulate themselves away from what they know will be a leftist fire storm.  So they make up some C&B; story about &#8220;getting hate mail from white supremacists&#8221; to make themselves appear more &#8220;moderate.&#8221;</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t apply to this Nina Jablonski, because she is a hard core leftist egalitarian, through and through.</p>

		<p>Duh! I thought that that this is accepted scientific fact. I remember in the 1950&rsquo;s, biologists pointed this out as an example of evolution: As humans penetrated higher latitudes, their skin lightened to allow more UV to penetrate and produce the required vitamin D. </p>
<p>Perhaps Prof Jablonsky next project should be human brains  increasing in size to allow them to cope more effectively with the harsher envrironment in these higher latitudes. </p>

		<p>The woman who made this documentary, aside from being a first class idiot, should be a political science professor based on the propaganda and lies she is spreading. If everyone was the same, aside from skin color, there would be no need for this film in the first place.  </p>
<p>But the film exists because different races behave differently. Some behave rather badly. And they keep behaving badly. PC speech makes racial links to bad behavior taboo - so the result is this garbage - trying to pin low IQs and impulsive violence on other factors aside from genetics. Granted, genetics may not account for 100% of behavior, but it&rsquo;s close.</p>
<p>By using terms like mutant (inappropriately, I might add) she confuses the viewer. If she had ANY guts - and any pride in science at all - she would have investigated the issue and concluded, &#8220;Africans are not as intelligent as whites, and are impulsive and lack some rational thought and most do not belong in civil society.&#8221; Is that really so bad? It&rsquo;s not her fault. She&rsquo;s not advocating genocide or ill-treatment of blacks. That&rsquo;s the way it is.</p>
<p>Just because you hate yourself, or your race, don&rsquo;t lump me into that group.</p>
<p>Believe me, inside, she knows the truth. And it is eating her alive.    </p>

		<p>Ah yes, SBS Produced documentary. That says it all.</p>
<p>SBS TV is very left leaning, it is government funded and its charter is to provide TV for ethnic minorities.</p>

		<p>When science becomes ultra-liberal, the world is doomed.</p>
<p>Hopefully the Australians are smart enough to see through this leftist nonsense. After all, if there&rsquo;s no such thing as race, then why do liberals always accuse us whites of &#8220;racism&#8221;?</p>

		<p>My mother&rsquo;s family have lived in the Southeastern U.S.A. for 300 years and have been exposed to sub-tropical sun light for the entire 300 years.  Mother is blond, blue eyed, and fair complected.  I recently had a DNA test conducted to determine race.  Yes.  There is a DNA test that can detect race to the percentages.  Race is not just a sociological creation.  There is science behind it.      </p>
