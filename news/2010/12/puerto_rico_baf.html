<h1><a href="http://www.newsmax.com/US/puerto-rico-high-asthma/2010/12/27/id/381192">Puerto Rico Baffled by High Asthma Rate</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Newsmax, December 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Puerto Rico is a U.S. Caribbean territory where children are nearly 300 percent more likely to have the respiratory ailment than white non-Hispanic children in the continental United States. And this year, Puerto Rico has seen a jump in asthma cases, which health officials suspect might be linked to the heavy rains that have unleashed millions of spores.</p>
<p>The island, with a population of 4 million, already has 2.5 times the death rate stemming from asthma as the mainland, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Puerto Ricans in the U.S. also have been hit hard by asthma, with an asthma attack rate 2.5 times higher than for whites.</p>
<p>Adding to the problem is that Puerto Rican children do not respond as well as those from other ethnic groups to the number one medication prescribed to asthmatics: Albuterol, which comes in an inhaler used to relieve sudden attacks. As a result, several major pharmaceutical companies are working to create another medication, but they are still years away from doing so.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&rsquo;s a challenge is that Puerto Ricans are not all the same,&#8221; said Dr. Esteban Gonzalez Burchard, director of the Center for Genes, Environments &amp; Health at the University of California, San Francisco. &#8220;(They) are racially mixed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those with European ancestry are likely most at risk of developing asthma, he said.</p>
<p>No one knows for certain why Puerto Ricans suffer so much from asthma, despite decades of research.</p>
<p>Theories include volcanic ash that drifts in from nearby Montserrat, clouds of Sahara dust that blanket the city in the summer and fungi that flourish in the tropical humidity  &mdash;  particularly bad this year, the wettest on record.</p>
<p>Some researchers suspect poverty {snip}.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Puerto Ricans, even when living in the same environmental conditions as other ethnic groups, still show higher rates of asthma, he said, which suggests that genes are at least partly to blame.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An average of 25,000 asthma-related emergency room claims are filed a year, and in the span of one year, nearly 90,000 Puerto Rican adults could not work or do regular activities because of asthma, according to a 2007 and a 2009 study by the island&rsquo;s health department.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nearly 30 percent of children in Puerto Rico are diagnosed with asthma, and the rate increases to 40 percent among kids in public housing projects, said Dr. Floyd Malveaux, former dean of the College of Medicine at Howard University.</p>

		<p>Perhaps off-topic, but America should simply give Puerto Rico its independence. I can&rsquo;t think of one single advantage America has ever acquired from taking this poor, Spanish speaking island in the foolish 1898 war with Spain.</p>

		<p>It would be interesting to explore the genetic factors that are almost certainly the cause of this asthma prevalence. Sadly, such an endeavor will never get off the ground in the race-paranoid USA.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard Puerto Rico is highly mixed racially, I wonder if this has anything to do with it, in much the same way that hybrids tend to have weaker immune systems than their parent stocks, especially if continued for several generations?</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think that this article has much significance in terms of race related genetics. I am a white male whose paternal side (non-smokers) of the family has a medical history of asthma and airborne allergies from a region (Central NC) that is one of the world&rsquo;s worst locales for pollen related respiratory problems. I have also lived in the Carribean and can state with a high degree of anecdotal accuracy that respiratory allergies/asthma are related to the immune system and that the immune system in this context  is very capricious in vacillating between sensitive and robust. </p>
<p>I went from a young male smoker NC resident with no respiratory problems to a Carribean smoker resident with few problems and back to NC as a smoker and ex-smoker with 10 years of cripling problems and now no problems.</p>

<p>That is because most Puerto Ricans are very mixed race and it is difficult to find drugs that work across all ethnic groups equally well.  Except for the minority who are white and the even smaller minority who are black most PRs are a Spanish/Indian mix, with a fair number of mulattos, referred to as &#8220;Blatinos&#8221;.  I kid you not.</p>

		<p>Guess what, Puerto Ricans have a definite advantage from U.S claiming their island.  They are now hired by the U.S. government and other public positions with excellent salaries.  They are chosen over white, more educated United States citizens. I have personally witnessed the unfairness to the white educated people of America.  Also, people from Puerto Rico have many more advantages, Their education and health care is fully funded by other U.S. citizens.</p>

		<p>I believe it is at least in part genetic. The Puerto Ricans in the South Bronx and East Harlem have the same symptoms with no tropical spores or pollens around. But yes, mixed they are: I don&rsquo;t believe I have ever encountered a Rican of purely European descent. Cuban, yes; Rican or Dominican, no. Regardless of what anyone says, there&rsquo;s very little to nil Amerindian in these islanders. The spectrum goes from White to various shades of Mulatto.   </p>

		<p>I absolutely agree with the first comment that Puerto Rico should be given its independance. This impoverished and largely mixed-race Spanish speaking island should have been cut off decades ago. Like say back in the 1950s, when Puerto Rican nationalists went on a shooting spree at the US capital, tried to assasinate President Truman and subsequently began migrating to the &#8216;mainland&rsquo; in huge numbers. But the horse is out of the stable if you like, because more Puerto Ricans now live on the &#8216;mainland&rsquo; then on the island and they&rsquo;ve also since devoured millions in welfare benefits. They have turned places like the Bronx and Hartford CT into crime ridden slums all while brazenly waving Puerto Ricans flags allegedly showing how &#8216;proud&rsquo; they are at being Puerto Rican.  </p>

		<p>Could it be that the decades-long bombing practice at Vieques by the US military has something to do with PR&rsquo;s respiratory problems? Who knows what the heck they were testing over there, just off the mainland&hellip;nerve agents, anthrax, or something much worse?</p>

		<p>Oh please, can we say: &#8216;Big Pharma Propaganda?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Malveaux is overseeing a $1 million, four-year program funded by the Merck Childhood Asthma Network that will target asthmatics in one of San Juan&rsquo;s largest public housing projects next year. The aim is to provide access to better health care and teach parents and children how to prevent attacks.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>The more money you spend on R&D; and treating the symptoms, the less profit you lose when the simplest answer is not pharmacological but _building code_ related.</p>
<p>I do wonder how many billions will be spent on &#8216;ethno diverse&rsquo; drug research for what is essentially a dependent economy on an overpopulated tiny island.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
A similar project in the early 2000s targeted two other housing projects in San Juan, where health officials monitored more than 200 asthmatics and visited their homes to encourage people to quit smoking and help eliminate mold, cockroaches and other allergens.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Quit Smoking = pay U.S. rates for cigarettes and make it illegal to import them from anywhere else.</p>
<p>Mold treatment = instant and ongoing success.  As it is here in the U.S. where discovery of mold leads to containment and evacuation procedures more stringent than for asbestos.  Duh.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Emergency room visits dropped by 30 percent, but living and working in such an environment has its drawbacks, said Dr. Marielena Lara, a pediatrician and policy researcher at the RAND Corporation in California who was involved in the study.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Ta-dah!  Reduced mold/mildew/mouse excrement/insect waste in a society that is used to living in unsanitary conditions yields A THIRTY PERCENT IMPROVEMENT IN HEALTH!</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t mess with mold.  You have to build to a completely different set of codes in a tropical environment to keep the inter wall spaces clear and the wallboard itself coated with an anti-mold agent because the stuff will _eat gypsum_.  It also helps if you don&rsquo;t use formaldehyde in the plasticizers.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Drive-by shootings and other frequent violent incidents would force children to stay at home and miss appointments, and parents also had other priorities, she said.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>And so the medical community finds reasons to justify their rampant treat-the-symptoms view of victim enabling as a cash subsidy to get rich off of.</p>
<p>We are talking about SICKNESS FROM ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANTS HERE.  It has nothing to do with criminals or making visits to the doctor when the attack happens.  And everything to do with removing the pollutants.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
&#8220;If you&rsquo;re poor, you&rsquo;re many times overwhelmed with getting out of poverty,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You might have less time to make an appointment with a doctor.&#8221;<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t procreate rapidly, you don&rsquo;t get overwhelmed with the consequences.</p>
<p>See, this is why I think we _have to_ go to robotics.  Because really, nobody wants to help these people.  Least of all _these people_.</p>
<p>And that is where things get tricky because they will likely never be able to drag themselves up to the U.S. economic level where paying for our lifestyles comes with an equivalent commitment to our work ethic.  But if you introduce simple robotics so that one man can run a work gang of 4-10 robots which do the tasks of building maintenance _for free_ then you can pay him for their labors as incentive to be in that hole to begin with.  And you reintroduce the social benefits system of slave labor as the basic means of leveraging up all civilizations of all times.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t do that with classism and humans anymore.  Not with worldwide television preaching the morality of self-victimization as an entitlement to U.S. aid.</p>
<p>But we could with even the simplest of anthropomorphic robots.</p>
<p>And the only thing these people have to do to get their perk existence is stop contributing to the base problems by getting sterilized after their first kid until the population was back down around 100-150,000, tops.</p>
<p>Amazing how the number of ER visits goes _down_ with the correlation in reduced birthrates and increased SES.  But nobody wants to talk about that&hellip;</p>

		<p>Antidote, sorry to say it, but yes, there is a lot of puertorricans that are full blooded european in various mixes, mainly spanish, corsican french, irish, portuguese and in the last decades white americans moving in&hellip; I live there, and can say, that around 8-10% of the island population is&hellip;(mostly of the high  economic advantage classes)<br>
And believe me, some of them posses a high culture that will make rich continental americans look like dumbs. Even in the Dominican Republic there are lots of whites, they just don&rsquo;t go to the states, or you don&rsquo;t notice very well. PR is very mixed between american indian, white and black, while in the DR is mainly pure black or white &amp; black.<br>
Refering to the article, there is also a lot to do with air pollution(I don&rsquo;t know if pollen)<br>
Kind Regards,</p>
