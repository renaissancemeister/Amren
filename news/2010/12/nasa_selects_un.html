<p>NASA Selects United Negro College Fund to Help Build Science Careers</p>
<p>WASHINGTON  &mdash;  NASA has selected the United Negro College Fund Special Programs Corp. of Falls Church, Va., to administer a $1 million career development and educational program designed to address the critical shortage of U.S. minority students in science and engineering fields.</p>
<p>The NASA Astrobiology Institute&rsquo;s (NAI) Minority Institution Research Support (MIRS) program in Moffett Field, Calif., is providing the funding for the four-year effort. The program will provide opportunities for up to four faculty members and eight students from minority-serving institutions to partner with astrobiology investigators. Astrobiology is the study of the origin, evolution, distribution and the future of life on Earth and the potential for life elsewhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;Providing new education opportunities for minority students will both enrich lives and answer a critical need for proficiency in science and engineering,&#8221; NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said. &#8220;But just as importantly, the program is an investment to cultivate imaginative thinking about the field of astrobiology.&#8221;</p>
<p>The United Negro College Fund Special Programs Corp. will use its extensive database of 14,000 registrants to develop an online community to provide webinars, virtual training and videoconferences, and provide outreach and recruitment for program participants. The program&rsquo;s objective is to engage more teachers from under-represented schools in astrobiology research and increase the number of students pursuing careers in astrobiology.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our nation&rsquo;s underserved populations are a tremendous resource on which we must draw, not just for science, but for everything we do,&#8221; said Carl Pilcher, director of NASA&rsquo;s Astrobiology Institute. &#8220;We are extremely pleased that the NAI MIRS program will continue contributing under the leadership of such a strong and experienced partner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Founded in 1998, NAI is a partnership between NASA, 14 U.S. teams of universities and other organizations, and seven international consortia. NAI&rsquo;s goals are to promote, conduct, and lead interdisciplinary astrobiology research, train a new generation of astrobiology researchers, and share the excitement of the field.</p>
<p>NAI is part of NASA&rsquo;s Astrobiology Program at the agency&rsquo;s headquarters in Washington. The institute initiated the MIRS program in 2002 as part of its mission to help train a new generation of researchers in astrobiology and increase diversity within the astrobiology community.</p>

		<p>Lack of minorities in Engineering and Science&hellip;.so two fields that if you slack off in you will fail; engineering in particular as you must take two difficult exams if you want to make decent money and get your license.  Sorry, we don&rsquo;t need idiot scientists any more than we need more corrupted politicians.</p>

The program&rsquo;s objective is to engage more teachers from under-represented schools in astrobiology research and increase the number of students pursuing careers in astrobiology.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the test scores from &#8220;underserved&#8221; areas indicate, even with above average $/student, the schools can&rsquo;t do much to bring the kids scores up.  Am I to believe that a $1mm project for webinars to the teachers will make astrobiologists out of students that are behavioral wrecks? </p>
<p>How about a commercial model; define the intended results prior to the program&rsquo;s start.  The money is lent to the United Negro College Fund with the loan forgiven if they meet the pre-agreed performance criteria.  Otherwise this is a transparent give-away payoff scheme. </p>

		<p>Ha! Ha!  That was the funniest prank pulled by NASA yet!  I&rsquo;m laughing in my seat.</p>
<p>What?  It&rsquo;s for real?  </p>
<p>Do we really need someone, of any race, designing rockets and such, who are poor in their studies and lacking in basic qualifications well into their early 20s?</p>
<p>Can I cry now?</p>

<p>On the other hand, since NASA&rsquo;s new mission is apparently to make Moslems feel good about themselves, perhaps this meaningless farce is going to be right up their alley after all.<br>

<p>Yes, and when they&rsquo;re appointed as NASA director, even though they are about as qualified as Forest Gump, their number one priority is making friends with Muslims.</p>
<p>The community organizer never stops trying to make a silk purse out of a sow&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>Ya dig?  I mean just give them a diploma&hellip;never mind the education behind it&hellip;&hellip;..then step aside and watch them and their heirs enter the wonderful of professional positions.  </p>

		<p>Some of us can remember a time when NASA put an American on the Moon, and we could all look forward to heading on out to Mars and beyond. </p>
<p>Well, so much for that!</p>
<p>It is one more symptom of America&rsquo;s decline as a civilization that we have turned NASA away from the space program and into one more front for the welfare state. </p>

		<p>Well, with the STS as a baseline for how to pay twice as much to gain a third as many launches from an RLV as an ELV, this kind of logic isn&rsquo;t exactly surprising.</p>
<p>I wish NASA would return to being NACA and invest in the technology of aerospace rather than the &#8216;engineering&rsquo; of social agendas.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t had real advancement in the propulsion end of this field since Paperclip brought the Nazis.</p>

<p>Yes, because we know that minorities should be interested in exactly the same things whites are interested in, and in exactly the same proportions. </p>
<p>But wait a minute! Who are whites to say that science and engineering are more important than music and dance? Isn&rsquo;t that a form of racism in itself? Why do whites set the standard of what is and is not important?</p>

		<p>It funny but I&rsquo;ve been recently watching the History Channel&rsquo;s &#8216;History of the Universe&rsquo; and that had women, both black, white; and then Black,Hispanic,Asian men, commentating then the &#8216;straight&rsquo; white men. The white men commentators  btw all seemed to have very proper titles after their names, with one or two having been astronauts and/or space scientists  of one sort or another. Whereas the ethnic minorities and woman all  seemed to be just holding token positions in the relevant departments or  space museums. So it seems to me much of the space programme (and its further areas of research) has already been given over to &#8216;inclusivity&rsquo; and dumnbed down accordingly. However did you manage alll those Apollo moon landings without them. Sigh&hellip;</p>

		<p>its amazing how many leftists, particularly minorities look at the moon landing as a NEGATIVE event - there were no minorities, minorities were still being &#8216;oppressed&rsquo; so why should go to the moon ? (someone actually told me this the other day) so in other words, from the leftist standpoint, the only &#8216;just&rsquo; way to go to the moon is when NASA is filled with all minorities and lesbians holding hands and singing songs about diversity. Of course, they won&rsquo;t get as much as a bottle rocket off the ground, but that&rsquo;s not the point. </p>

		<p>NASA is an extremely important symbol of white progress. Hell, the white race was the one that put a man on the moon!  Something our ancestors only dreamt of. The amount of technology involved requires such a heavy-duty amount of logic and understanding that only the best and the brightest are even given a chance to be a part of it. This is incredibly dangerous, if we start going affirmative action style on NASA our space programs will decline and often end in tragedy. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Are people insane? Our ancestors would look at us in disgust if they were alive today.<br>

		<p>There is NO shortage of &#8220;minorities&#8221; in science and engineering- there is a &#8220;shortage&#8221; of Blacks and Hispanics. South Asians and East Asians are definitely more of &#8220;minorities&#8221; than Blacks and Hispanics as Asians make up a much smaller percentage of the population (only 4 percent of the entire U.S.!). However, we make up about 14 percent of all doctors and 20 percent of all engineers in the U.S. DESPITE massive anti-asian discrimination due to quotas in medical and engineering schools. I propose that we solve this &#8220;minority shortage&#8221; by classifying dark skinned South Asians as  &#8220;Black.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Another total screw-up by our 100% racist administration. What a joke. There is a very good reason why this is an &#8220;underserved population,&#8221; and it has absolutely nothing to do with lack of opportunity. A degree from an HBCU in Afro Studies just does not make you astronaut material!</p>

		<p>Some of you may remember the Mars landing that crashed because of a software error where the person designing the software was using the wrong measurement system so that the conversion factors were wrong. This software is also double checked by somebody as well as tested extensively in simulations (I almost took one of those checker jobs 30 years ago but they assumed I would work for only about 25% more than my current job even though JPLs was a contract with no bennies, so I have an idea what they do).</p>
<p>Imagine how they will cover up the screw-ups if they give real work to unqualified engineers who really didn&rsquo;t earn their degree.<br>

		<p>Just another waste of money! Under performing students whose genetics don&rsquo;t place them in the upper percentiles won&rsquo;t suddenly become smarter with money thrown at them. These &#8220;students&#8221; probably will do better in trade schools. </p>
