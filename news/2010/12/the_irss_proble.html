<h1><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2010/12/01/pf/taxes/IRS_taxes_minorities.fortune/index.htm">The IRS&rsquo;s Problem With Minorities</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Shawn Tully, CNN, December 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Is the Internal Revenue Service targeting African-American and Hispanic taxpayers? That&rsquo;s the conclusion of a new study provided exclusively to Fortune titled &#8220;IRS Enforcement&rsquo;s Impact on Minority Communities,&#8221; conducted by Thomas M. Evans, CEO of TaxLifeboat, a firm that advises taxpayers on resolving their problems with the IRS.</p>
<p>Evans stresses strongly that the disproportionate number of IRS actions against minorities isn&rsquo;t intentional. Rather, he charges, it&rsquo;s the result of overly rigid, highly-automated enforcement policies that waste taxpayer money by pursuing low-earners who either can&rsquo;t pay, or owe virtually nothing.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The IRS doesn&rsquo;t specify the ethnic background of Americans it hits with enforcement actions. To explore the issue, Evans examined the 1,000 zip codes where the IRS had filed the largest number of liens from July 2009 to July 2010. He then mined the 2000 Census, the most recent source available, to determine the racial makeup of those areas. Evans found that, on average, the populations of those 1,000 locales with the nation&rsquo;s highest level of tax enforcement were 22% African-American and 24% Hispanic. That&rsquo;s approximately double the proportion of those minorities in entire country.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Hiding in plain sight</b></p>
<p>Why do IRS actions fall so heavily on minorities? The principal reason is that low-earners, including an outsized number of blacks and Hispanics according to Evans&rsquo; findings, commit the violations that are easiest to detect. The IRS&rsquo;s powerful computers screen the W-2 forms from employers against the returns filed by individuals. If the worker didn&rsquo;t file a return at all, or if they claim too many exemptions, the IRS automatically launches an &#8220;examination.&#8221; That step frequently leads to an enforcement action, which can trigger severe penalties  &mdash;  garnishing wages, seizing homes, freezing bank accounts or the filing of tax liens that ruin credit ratings.</p>
<p>According to Evans, who advises thousands of low-income clients a year, many workers are so uninformed about the tax system that they think the amount withheld from their paychecks is sufficient payment. Hence, they don&rsquo;t file returns at all.</p>
<p>Others, he says, don&rsquo;t intentionally cheat, but &#8220;don&rsquo;t think that it&rsquo;s a priority to be tax compliant.&#8221; They may neglect to report such items as credit card debt forgiveness, which is classified as income under the tax code. And, says Evans, they simply can&rsquo;t afford the $100 to $300 for an advisor to prepare their returns.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Remarkably, many of the low-earners with IRS problems don&rsquo;t owe anything. Evans recently worked with a truck driver who hadn&rsquo;t filed a return in seven years, and faced a bill for $60,000. &#8220;He&rsquo;d been paying through withholding,&#8221; says Evans. &#8220;When we finally filed all the returns, and included his deductions, he owed $400.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the IRS garnishes their wages, many former factory workers or security guards stop looking for higher-paying jobs, or quit their jobs altogether in favor of work in businesses where they&rsquo;re paid in cash. {snip}</p>

		<p>Also, a lot of ignorant blacks try to take a &#8220;slavery reparations tax deduction.&#8221;  Every year for the last dozen, I&rsquo;ve read a story about the IRS nabbing some black for having done so.  There must be some urban legend bouncing around the ghettos regarding that.</p>

		<p>1. Get rid of illegals. That&rsquo;s not an IRS problem.</p>
<p>2. Most blacks and Hispanics, even if here legally, don&rsquo;t pay taxes. To be fair that&rsquo;s because the socialist tax system we have doesn&rsquo;t cover the incomes they earn under fifty grand per year. With all the kids and exemptions they have, they don&rsquo;t pay taxes.</p>
<p>3. Flat tax (five or six percent, no deductions/exemptions) everybody. The homeless. Billionaires. Middle Class.The Ethiopian &#8220;American&#8221; cabdriver who claims twenty grand per year with ten kids.And to make sure, assess, like Caesar in ancient Palestine, a minimum cash amount. </p>
<p>And when they don&rsquo;t pay, they are the property of the US,to do such tasks as required. Minefields in Afghanistan come to mind.</p>

		<p>This is the problem with the great underclass   &mdash;   too dumb to file or complete IRS forms correctly, or they simply don&rsquo;t care to.  Self-reporting of income, via annual tax forms, requires intellegence and motivation, which Europeans and Asians have, but Africans and Amerindians lack.  As European-Americans come to be replaced by Africans and Hispanics, this problem will increase, and tax income will decline.</p>

<p>NONE of this is intentional. These low wage earners are trying to do stuff that sets off red flags all over the place. When your return is submitted, ALL [?] are computer audited. According to the computer algorithm, the return will be red flagged according to protocols. The red flags are set off by the low wage owners doing stuff like making $10,000 per year and then claiming $5,000 tax deduction for charitable church contributions, etc.</p>

		<p>If I have this straight, the fact that these two groups aren&rsquo;t intelligent enough to cheat effectively on their taxes means that the law is somehow &#8220;unfair&#8221;.  These tax laws also unfairly target dishonest people.  Are we supposed to work ourselves into a tizzy over their feelings being hurt now?</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;ve had two examples of both sides of the coin this week. The actor, Wesley Snipes, is going to prison because of non-payment of taxes. Congressman Charlie Rangel only gets censured and he&rsquo;s whining about that! Why isn&rsquo;t he in prison? Anyone else who hadn&rsquo;t paid their taxes for 17 years would be rotting in a 5x8 cell. And to top it off, Charlie&rsquo;s democrat buddies gave him a standing ovation when it was over!</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a less prettied-up version of what this article is saying:</p>
<p><br>
<i>NAMs routinely attempt to cheat on their taxes   &mdash;   way more often than white people   &mdash;   but the NAMs aren&rsquo;t smart enough to pull it off without somehow incriminating themselves in ways that are obvious and easy for the IRS to catch. IOW, they&rsquo;re not only dishonest but also dumb.</i> </p>

If CNN could just come out and tell it like that, me and millions of others might actually start watching it again. </p>

		<p>A few observations: 1) while the number of enforcement actions measured in liens are disproportionately affecting minorities, it corresponds to to the actual number of violations detected.  Are we to allow non-filers, delinquents and false filers a bye because they are minority?  They vote, they get services, they are more likely to have public service jobs, and they can have the pleasure of societal participation by paying their taxes. 2) Many of these violations are the simplest of issues, like not filing or taking an outsize amount of charitable deductions.  These are objective, non-human machine derived flags of non-compliance.  3) Liens may not be the best way to measured enforcement, as many receiving IRS letters with fines, and/or tax negoiations take place well short of the more dire lien process. 4) The study does not address that those out-sized absolute numbers of violators is small compared to the amount collected.  The bigger fish tax cheats that have the IRS&rsquo; attention provide far more money to the IRS coffers then the other cohorts.  5) If the tax laws are not enforced for all, then the tax laws will not be obeyed.  Exempting a class of people would further incentivize them to cheat.  Proof? Review the latest Pigford II filings, where 3x the number of possible &#8220;victims&#8221; have filed for compensation inclusive of an affadavit from a collaborator. 5) The author of the &#8220;study&#8221; is a business whose provides a taxpayer advisory service, and in the report advocates for allocating more funding to taxpayer services.  More than a bit self-serving.  Junk research.</p>

		<p>5:  Let&rsquo;s nip this nonsense in the bud before it grows out of control.  Of course there is no &#8220;law&#8221; (statutory level, denoted by some numbers, then U.S.C. (United States Code), then more numbers), that requires those of certain incomes and situations to file returns, and no &#8220;law&#8221; requiring payment of an income tax.  That&rsquo;s because those requirements are found in regulatory code, a body of law one level underneath statutory law.  Hint:  If you get strung up on willful failure to file, etc. your case goes in front of an Administrative Law Judge, not a Federal trial level judge.</p>
<p>Similarly, there is no law that states that a radio station has to use a certain frequency and power.  All the law states in essence is &#8220;there&rsquo;s this thing called radio, we in Congress don&rsquo;t have the expertise, so we&rsquo;re gonna create this thing called an FCC and let it deal with radio.&#8221;  In the regulatory code of the FCC, it gives itself power to regulate station frequency and power, and a lot of other things.  One level down, in the collective body of Records of Decision, is where you&rsquo;ll find each given station&rsquo;s parameters.</p>
