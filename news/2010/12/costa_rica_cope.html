			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chris Hawley, USA Today, December 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Illegal immigration is not just a problem in the United States. It is here in the sweltering lowlands of Central America, too, as people from impoverished countries try to reach developing nations.</p>
<p>About 86 million of the world&rsquo;s 214 million migrants are in developing countries, where citizens often complain that the newcomers drive down already low wages and burden shaky social services. In Costa Rica, the government has imposed new rules criminalizing immigrant smuggling, raising the financial requirements for legal residency and making it harder to get residency by marrying a Costa Rican.</p>
<p>Costa Rica ranks 97th in the world in per capita income, at $10,900 a year  &mdash;  poorer than Mexico, Venezuela or migrant-sending nations in the Old World like Bulgaria and Turkey. Nicaragua, just to Costa Rica&rsquo;s north, is worse off: The average income is $2,800 a year, making it the second-poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, after Haiti.</p>
<p>The disparity has drawn about 74,000 migrants to Costa Rica since 2002, swelling its population of foreign-born people by 26%. The country now has 350,000 migrants, out of a population of about 4.5 million, giving it the highest immigration rate of any country in Latin America.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other Nicaraguans work in construction, as maids and as security guards in San José, the capital. Some guard parked cars, collecting a few colo´nes for the service. About 30,000 come illegally to work in orange orchards and banana plantations during the harvest season, said Salvador Gutiérrez, an expert at the International Organization for Migration based in Geneva.</p>
<p>For decades, the migrants were mostly tolerated, Gutiérrez said. But the economic slump has many Costa Ricans worried that migrants are taking their jobs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Peñas Blancas, Costa Rican authorities have built a mile-long, 8-foot-high wall to try to discourage migrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We catch them and deport them, and a few days later, you see the same people again,&#8221; said Dagoberto Briceño, a Costa Rican federal police officer.</p>
<p>In the past, many of the Nicaraguans in Costa Rica would have gone to the U.S., said immigrant Cristian Martínez, 20. But stricter border enforcement and rising violence by Mexico&rsquo;s gangs have deterred many.</p>

		<p>Of course you will NOT see white liberal marxists going down there and preaching that those racist costa ricans should get over themselves and embrace cultural diversity and social justice!</p>

		<p>Q: Since Costa Rica and Nicaragua are both Central American nations with similar people and climate, why is one so much richer than the other?</p>
<p>A; While Costa Rica has embraced free-market capitalism Nicaragua under the Sandistas experienced decades of Obama-style Marxism.</p>

		<p>is it just me? Am I getting old and grumpy? Do I need diversity training?</p>
<p>It seems as if in the past people wanted to migrate to have the chance through hard work and determination to IMPROVE THEMSELVES today it seems as if The Invaders have no interest in changing themselves they are only interested in changing us as they jump on the bandwagon of FREEBIES they can claim based on the work of others!<br>
Isn&rsquo;t there a story about a fool killing a Golden Goose?<br>
Isn&rsquo;t America really The Worlds Golden Goose?</p>

		<p>Reply to anon at # 2:</p>
<p>One thing I would point out is that the demographics of the two countries are very different. 3% of Costa Rica&rsquo;s population is black and 1% Amerindian. For Nicaragua the figures are 9% and 5% respectively. Also the percentage of Mestizios is very much higher in Nicaragua then in Costa Rica. The latter country has a very much higher number of full blooded (or nearly so) whites. </p>
<p>Other factors may be that Costa Rica spends NOTHING on defense, having abolished its military decades ago (in contrast to the trillion dollars or so Uncle Sam spends annually in its self-proclaimed role as world policeman). Costa Rica has also always been a democracy, having none of the political turmoil of other Latin nations burdened by a large Mestizio population. The struggles for land reform and social unrest that characterized these countries was never a factor in Costa Rica.</p>

<p>Costa Rica is a white country. </p>
<p>Nicaragua has a large black and mulatto population, and much fewer whites (though many of the mulattoes consider themselves &#8220;white&#8221;).</p>
<p>When I was in Venezuela, I was interested to learn that many upper-middle-class Venezuelans liked to vacation in nice, peaceful, white Costa Rica. It seems that everywhere you go, people who can afford the choice want to be among whites!</p>

		<p>This isn&rsquo;t about Mexico.  Nobody is demanding that Mexico be flooded with millions of non-Mexicans and &#8220;assimilate&#8221; AKA interbreed.  </p>
<p>This is about WHITE countries.  ONLY and ALL WHITE countries are forced to accept millions of non-Whites so they can be minority White.  It&rsquo;s call White Genocide.  It&rsquo;s the destruction of a people.</p>
<p>If you oppose White genocide, you&rsquo;re &#8220;racist.&#8221;  Further proof that racism is simply an anti-White term meant to shut White people up and stifle debate.</p>

		<p>I love Costa Rica, in fact I just got back from there. While there is a somewhat higher proportion of pure Spanish people.That said Costa Rica is not nearly a White country. Yes many of them claim to be,but that. Claim is absurd. 90% of them are Mestizos. They do not resemble people in Spain. Lonely Planet used to list Costa Rica as a White country, because that is what the locals claim. They now list it as a Mestizo country, because of thousands of travelers who were writing  laughing at them for calling people  in C.R. Whites. The truth is like all Mestizos they want be White,they are so used to saying it that they forget to look in the mirror. Kind of sad all Latin Americans wish they were White. But in the good old U.S.A. Whites are the devil.</p>

<p>  I have to disagree there. Most of the Costa Ricans I&rsquo;ve known in the universities have been almost pure Spanish in race. I&rsquo;m not saying that all Costa Ricans are white but a great many could pass for white. I don&rsquo;t buy the 90% mestizo claim. They are most certainly whiter than most of the mulattos and Cholos from Nicaragua.</p>
