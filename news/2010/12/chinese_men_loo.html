<h1>Chinese Men Looking West</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tiffany Tan, Washington Post, November 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The supposed materialism of Chinese women is putting off some Chinese men and driving them into the arms of Western women. Tiffany Tan delves deeper</p>
<p>&#8220;Chinese man fancies Western woman&#8221; was the title of the personal ad Li Lei posted online, in which he asked if any Western &#8220;ladies (in Beijing) are open to a long-term and serious relationship with a Chinese guy&#8221;. And by &#8220;long-term and serious&#8221;, Li meant marriage.</p>
<p>Marriages between Chinese men and Western women in China are noticeably fewer than vice versa, so why is Li taking the road less traveled?</p>
<p>After studying for a combined five years in the Netherlands and United Kingdom, the 30-year-old Beijinger discovered he preferred the personality of Western European women. He considers them more independent than their Chinese counterparts, less girlish and more straightforward.</p>
<p>Li puts extra emphasis on the last attribute.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tony, a 28-year-old native of Hunan who asked not to use his real name, is also keen on Western women.</p>
<p>After two serious relationships with Chinese women, in which he got exasperated trying to figure out the reason why his girlfriends got upset, he decided two years ago that a North American or European woman would suit him better.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tony and Li&rsquo;s preference for Western women, the men say, is also due to the growing materialism of Chinese women and the pressure to provide a new apartment for one&rsquo;s bride-to-be.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Li says the spotlight on newlyweds&rsquo; possessions is something that &#8220;distorts love in China&#8221;.</p>
<p>Li and Tony&rsquo;s taste in women may put them in the minority, but their numbers are growing as more foreign women come to China and more Chinese men learn foreign languages and experience life overseas.</p>
<p>Fishbowl Events, a Beijing group run by foreigners and known for its speed-dating parties, has observed a marked increase in male Chinese participants in the past few years.</p>
<p>&#8220;In 2007, we had about 20 percent Chinese men,&#8221; says Ola Zdzarska, co-owner of Fishbowl. &#8220;Now it is 40 percent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of them are really focused on foreign girls. When I see (evaluation) cards after the speed dating, I see they don&rsquo;t take Chinese girls seriously, because they just want to date foreign girls.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p> &#8220;Traditionally, a Chinese man will want a woman who is more submissive and listens and sort of follows her duties  &mdash;  whether it&rsquo;s cooking or sex,&#8221; the clinical psychologist [Dr Alfred Chambers, a relationship-counseling specialist at Beijing United Family Hospital and Clinics] says. &#8220;Western women will be more open, aggressive, assertive sexually.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I do admire Asian men&rsquo;s respect for teachers, education, and order.However, in respect to women,I must say Chinese media and/or culture has failed concerning the materialistic needs of women.  Western women, obviously with exceptions, are by and large concerned with clothing, weight, and the attactiveness of home, practical matters like occupancy space and cleanliness aside.  I don&rsquo;t know much about Chinese women. But in no way can they be more obsessed with worthless matters of how one looks or the size of one&rsquo;s home than Western women at the present time.  </p>
<p>I do feel sorry for these Asian fellows. Hopefully they will persevere. They will meet genuine, caring women in Asia. They exist in America and Europe too. </p>
<p>But they are hard to find.Thanks reality TV, ipod media, and MTV.</p>

		<p>I knew it.  They are coming for our women, children, lands.  And finally, for us.  We whites stay away from other people&rsquo;s lands.  There are no whites in China, or Asia.  There are no white men dating Chinese women.  Why can&rsquo;t they do the same.</p>

		<p>Chinese men: Stop aborting your girls. Overthrow the Chinese Communist Party, which hates the Han people and is responsible for this madness.</p>
<p>Do not arouse the wrath of the awakening White race by preying on our women, as the blacks do. Nothing will make us hate you as quickly or intensely as this.</p>
<p>If China seeks to supplant America as the new world power, China is welcome to try. If China seeks to take White women to make up for its own errors, it is not welcome and even the most peaceful of the Whites will look on Chinese as enemies to be conquered, something we do not now see you as.</p>
<p>Stop aborting your own girls. Chinese men need to stay with Chinese women.</p>

		<p>Even though there is a shortage of Chinese women for single Chinese men, many Chinese women are trying to nab a white male and a life in the West.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t doubt the Chinese men are also looking for a springboard to life in the West.</p>
<p>It seems a white spouse automatically means a ticket out of the Third World.</p>

		<p>The saddest aspect of our Great American Culture today is the sickness of miscegenistic experimentation engaged in by our beautiful young American females of European descent. NOTHING in the world breaks my heart like seeing throngs of our best and brightest and most attractive going down the road of we-are-the-world-genetics. How fashionable they must feel; how revolutionary. I&rsquo;m not going to cite statistics. I am not going to tell anecdotes. I don&rsquo;t feel the need to defend this claim. I&rsquo;m just saying aloud that it breaks my heart to see a Princess throwing away her Birthright.</p>
<p>Our Ancestors felt very, very strongly about miscegenation, and everywhere in this nation, these laws existed till relatively recently. Throughout most of our American history  &mdash;  MOST OF IT  &mdash;  miscegenation was forbidden by law. Were they so stupid? Were they, as the PC leftist &#8220;educators&#8221; in this declining nation tell us, so evil? </p>
<p>American girls and women, think! Use your faculty for forethought. Imagine yourself and your children in years to come. Think, and don&rsquo;t idly discard your Birthright!</p>

		<p>Since there are so few potential Chinese brides, they can be picky about which men they date and marry.  Naturally, they give preference to men with means.  If Chinese men do not like this situation, they should work to stop the murder of baby girls (born or unborn) in their country.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t pretend to speak for western women or women in general, nor am I a George Clooney in the looks department, but I haven&rsquo;t seen a whole lot of white women going after Asian guys. Maybe I&rsquo;m wrong but that&rsquo;s one racial pairing that&rsquo;s not too common  &mdash;  white women just aren&rsquo;t that attracted to Asians. Ladies what do you think??</p>

		<p>Now, if more Mongolian Chinese (taller group in general) men follow this trend, there will be more tall men for us tall women to date and marry!  So, while it&rsquo;s too late for me (glad I&rsquo;m not still dating, though), it&rsquo;s nice to think that things might even out for the next generation.  And although I&rsquo;m not all that enthusiastic about interracial mating, if you&rsquo;re going to cross that line, if I couldn&rsquo;t find a white man, I&rsquo;d rather marry an Asian than any other races out there.  Just my two cents. </p>

		<p>&#8220;The supposed materialism of Chinese women is putting off some Chinese men and driving them into the arms of Western women.&#8221;</p>
<p>Only in a left wing rag is it possible to read stories that get it wrong&hellip;.on purpose or through incompetence.</p>
<p>Why?  Because I seriously doubt that China&rsquo;s man/woman problem is really due to the attitudes/personalities of the females.  If Chinese men are driven into the arms of any women outside their race it&rsquo;s because a very large part of the population has been practicing gender based abortions for so many years the country is having a serious female shortage.  Too, after birth, many female babies are killed or abandoned somewhere and die from starvation or exposure.</p>
<p>There are literally millions of men who will be bachelors until they die, according to reports from the Chinese themselves.</p>
<p>Their one child policy is a good idea, but when they practice gender selection favoring men there&rsquo;s bound to be an imbalance that amounts to something like a time bomb waiting to go off.  Millions of single men with no prospects of marriage could well be a nightmare in the making, especially when they&rsquo;re young and full of raging hormones.</p>

		<p>The one child rule if practised without sex-selection would work quite well.  Nature would slightly favor boys at birth but females would have th edge by age 18 and all would be well. The Chinese government needs to figure out how to stop sex-selection abortion and then sterilize woman after they give birth.  One child, boy or girl, what ever nature gives you.</p>

		<p>This is very much a fringe trend. Chinese men tend to get brides from places like Burma, North Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines, Africa, or the poorer parts of China itself if they want a wife and are turned off by the Chinese women they are acquainted with. Those who have a particular fancy for European features are much more likely to go after Russian women than Westerners.</p>
<p>That said, the Chinese need to scrap one-child NOW. Without it, they&rsquo;d still be under replacement level, and they might have less of a problem with sex-selective abortion.</p>

		<p>Well, maybe there is a double-standard. A white guy, as highly privileged and lucky as he is (and we&rsquo;re constantly told about everyone elses but whites troubles) he&rsquo;s just a spoiled guy who needs to learn tolerance and diversity. Western women might look upon these Asian guys in another way. </p>

		<p>Chinese men looking at white American women, or for that matter women who were American raised but of Chinese descent are going to be in for a unpleasant surprise. They&rsquo;ll find out just how the affluenza virus spares no ethnic group. Furthermore, as a white man who like many others have been priced out of the market when it comes to the opposite sex, I am not amused about this either. If I had the money and knew the language, I would be looking to Russian women for a spouse, I cannot stand many American women these days. Namely, the ones who act like men, talk like men, and have to wear the pants, or the ones who simply use men&rsquo;s good nature against them. Let these Chinese men find out about this for themselves, and learn as I have that it&rsquo;s better to be alone than be chained to a woman who threatens your sanity.</p>

		<p>I have known several male friends who have crossed the line and dated and married Asian women.  Here in So. Cal., for some men, an Asian woman on their arm is practically a must-have fashion accessory.  </p>
<p>I have also heard that many (certainly not all) Asian women are very materialistic, and not just Chinese.  </p>
<p>So, I think it&rsquo;s funny that those men (who think American women are just too spoiled) are going to get their eyes opened when they find out that their Asian honeys are certainly no less materialistic.</p>
<p>But face it guys&hellip; when you marry a woman, you are in effect her employer.  And one important aspect, when you&rsquo;re deciding which job to take, is what you are going to get paid  &mdash;  i.e., your standard of living.  And being a wife (and eventually mother) is not just about love, it&rsquo;s a real job. </p>
<p>And, just like the old saying goes&hellip; &#8220;It&rsquo;s just as easy to love a rich man as it is to love a poor man.&#8221;</p>
<p>And regarding those who think that this or that group of women are too stuck on their looks&hellip; it&rsquo;s a two-way street.  And one of the reasons they are stuck on how they look is because men are extremely stuck on how women look. </p>
<p>If a guy doesn&rsquo;t like the way a woman looks, why, she might as well be less than human, because nothing else seems to make up for what she looks like. </p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t confuse a trend for &#8220;Western brides&#8221; with images of Chinese men marrying American girls from the Mid-West or something like that.  The trend will be much more regionally and economicaly driven.  </p>
<p>In particular, look at the trajectories and georgraphical proximity of, for example Russia and China.  Russia: moribund economy, extremely unhealthy male population with low life expectancy, higher female population without domestic prospects.  China: dynamic and growing economy, many relatively successful men, too few women due to one-child policy.  </p>
<p>This will increasingly result in Russian (and probably other Eastern European women) looking to China as a prospect for a decent, stable life that they cannot have in their homeland.  Conversely, Chinese men will be grateful for the opporunity to have families that have been denied them due to skewed demographics in their homeland.  </p>
<p>While not ideal from an &#8220;ethnic purity&#8221; point of view (from either Russian or Chinese perspectives), this will have its benefits to both countries and releave a lot of social pressures.</p>
<p>As for Eastern European women going to China, many of them will not be money-grubbing, US- or Western European-style spoiled brats.  They will be girls of modest background who will be grateful for the opportunity to have a better life, even if it is not their ideal in life (And who of us gets that?).</p>
<p>That is more of dynamic I would expect to happen in this area.  I give Russia as one example, but would not be surprised to see this happen between Chinese men and brides from other countries such as Phillipines, Vietnam, other Eastern European countries, and even Africans (where many male Chinese now go to work).</p>

		<p>I thought the Chinese were supposed to be so smart. Why didn&rsquo;t they see this coming at least 20 years ago, like I did. Keep the boy babies, kill the girl babies and now they&rsquo;re scratching their heads gee, what happened.<br>
Chinese men should go to some Third World country to find women who are not so spoiled and materialistic like Africa for instance. There you could find women who would be impressed just because you own a pair of shoes. I have never in my life seen an Oreintal man with a black women.</p>

		<p>Chinese parents and grandparents really push their kid into finding someone with money, whereas with western women with more of an independence it varies more from one to the next, but overall is probably not that much different. I have often heard that for instance in Shanghai you will find offices with female staff mostly single because they would rather remain single than marry a guy without a car or house. And if they do hook up with a guy, theirs moms have a way of finding out the guy&rsquo;s financial status and if he doesn&rsquo;t have a fully paid-off apartment etc the relationship is over.</p>
<p>Young Chinese women are often, however, very infantile and prone to childish tantrums. On the surface they do have more of a &#8220;girliness&#8221; which some western men seem to find a nice change from the modern-day (sometimes) cocky, over-confident western woman.</p>

<p>The funny is, I&rsquo;ve heard every one of this Asian man&rsquo;s reasons for preferring Western women said by Western men about why they prefer Asian women. I have white male friends who maintain that Asian women make better partners because the East hasn&rsquo;t been corrupted by Feminism like the West. So this Chinese man&rsquo;s lament may be nothing more than a case of &#8220;The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.&#8221; </p>
<p>As other posters have said, if Chinese men think a white wife will be less demanding, less materialistic, or generally easier to control, they obviously haven&rsquo;t spent much time with white women. Make these guys sit through a few episodes of the demanding, materialistic women of &#8220;Sex and the City,&#8221; and they&rsquo;ll soon be much more knowledgeable about the harsh realities of 21st Century White Women. Because those S&TC; gals are enough to make a straight man turn gay. </p>

		<p>If single Chinese men want lifetime partners from overseas, they have better chances with Russian women.  Ethnically speaking, Russian women are not Caucasian to be precise, and the conflicts caused by cultural differences are milder and fewer between Chinese people and Russians.  I wonder if it is partly caused by the geographical factor&hellip; for them to suffer less from cultural conflicts.  China and Russia are located side by side and it made the cultural differences less severe.  And it already has been quite a while since a few Chinese men have been finding brides from Russia.  I will be honest, I have seen a plenty of Russian women who are not only very beautiful but also smart and gentle and I always felt they would make great brides to just any man in the world.  </p>
<p>Regarding which chicks are more materialistic&hellip;.  I will be honest, Asian chicks keep Chanel and Armani in business.  </p>

Asian men aren&rsquo;t much in the looks department to put it politely, and an attractive white woman the first to agree with that.

		<p> There must be plenty of poor Chinese village women who are looking for well educated and successful husbands.  The current shortage of women is due to gender specific abortion policies based on Chinese tradition. I&rsquo;m not sure why the Chinese men are looking to Western Europe and the United States for mates. Relations between the sexes in America, under the influence of militant feminism, have deteriorated over the past decades into mutual distrust and antagonism. Of course, there&rsquo;s been a serious erosion of American values and morality. I would advice these lovelorn Chinese men to look East to Vietnam, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. I think they will find the women there culturally similar, as well as attractive and agreeable.</p>

<p>If Chinese men have no choice but choosing a woman between a black woman who was raised in North America or a muslim woman who grew up in a predominantly muslim country, he should go for the black woman, I agree.  There is at least some cultural similarities that can be found among typical black American women and Asian men.  Black women and Asian men might at least be able to communicate with each other and understand each other without much difficulty.  But muslim women&hellip; no matter how nice or educated they might be, their cultures are simply extremely incompatible.  </p>

		<p>The level of confusion among the comments is astounding.</p>
<p>Firstly, almost everyone here has confused FEMINISM and MATERIALISM. These are totally different, even opposite, concepts. Which women are more willing to support a stay-at-home dad who looks after the kids? That is the difference right there. Feminist women do not mind earning more than their potential husbands, whereas materialistic women require their potential husbands to earn more than them. Feminist women are less, not more, likely to be materialistic, and vice versa. </p>
<p>Western women are more feminist, and Chinese women are more materialistic. So it comes down to what you prefer. If Chinese men are tired of materialism, let them have Western wives. Similarly, if Western men are tired of feminism, let them have Chinese wives. Everybody wins, as long as you know what you are looking for.<br>

<p>at least with muslim women, it is mandatory for them to be subservient to their husband. i&rsquo;m always an atheist by heart anyway so if i can have a subservient wife with a killer body then praying 5 times a day towards mecca is but a merely small price to pay - i&rsquo;d consider it as some sort of a yoga practice^^.</p>

<p>  Having been to Russian and the Ukraine, I can&rsquo;t agree with you that Russian women are not Caucasian. Maybe Russians in Central Asia and Siberia, who have mixed more with the Mongols and Tartars, are more Asiatic.  In most scientific racial classifications Russians are classed as white/Caucasian. If you asked them, most Russians would claim to be Caucasian/European. <br>
  <br>
  I do agree that Russians and Chinese, both having been under absolute Monarchs and Communism, do share some cultural similarities, but race isn&rsquo;t one of them.<br>

<p>The media may promote black men as being sex symbols, but they really don&rsquo;t go out of their way to promote Hispanic men all that much, nevertheless in areas with large mixed-blood Hispanic populations you will see far more Hispanic/White female pairings than Black/White female pairings with equal demographics.</p>

<p>And yes, I did hear I am not &#8220;very masculine&#8221;.  I heard I have a relatively high voice for a man.  </p>
<p>But if being &#8220;manly&#8221; means &#8220;Taking a shower only once every three days&#8221; or &#8220;Swearing 24/7&#8221; or &#8220;Not shaving everyday&#8221; or &#8220;Being violent and less polite every now and then&#8221; or &#8220;not paying attention at all to the outfit&#8221;</p>
<p>then I will gladly be &#8220;less manly&#8221; for the rest of my life.  Not just me.  If that&rsquo;s the definition of &#8220;masculinity&#8221;, then a lot of East Asian guys who spent our childhood in East Asia will not be very masculine. </p>
<p>And lastly, I could not care less what excuse the mainstream media has for not portraying East Asian guys in positive ways.  Considering the way it constantly and dishonestly describes black males and constantly puts down East Asian males and white males, I don&rsquo;t care what excuses they have.  I simply can&rsquo;t pay attention to or be convinced by anything they say.  </p>

<p>I have. Although I admit it&rsquo;s not too common on average. According to 2006 census, about 2% of white males AND females MARRY interracially. On the other hand, outmarriage rates to whites are somewhat higher for nonwhite populations with the exception of black females. This can be attributed to the demographic dominance of whites in America. Still the PERCEPTION of compatibility plays a much larger role. This perception is rooted in the individual alone and the individual&rsquo;s immediate interaction with the social/cultural/economic/historical/religious environment. And the perception is ever-changing so don&rsquo;t expect it to be the same in the future as it is now&hellip;</p>
<p>Some asian males in America are shorter; others taller. The ones who come from China and South Korea are usually tall from my observations. They are certainly slimmer compared to white males and even females.</p>
<p>Stereotypes are sometimes true, sometimes not. I do think black males have a higher rate of endowment compared to other races. The majority of white males in America are average to less than average (if average is 5 or so) from what I&rsquo;ve seen. I don&rsquo;t think this generally affects a man&rsquo;s performance or influences a woman&rsquo;s interest negatively.<br>

		<p>Chinese men are barking up the wrong tree if they look to the west for brides. Rather they should look south to India. As an Englishman married to an Indian woman. I cannot emphasize how satisfied I am with my marital situation. Indian women are beautiful, gracious, dignified and wonderfully submissive. All my wife ever asks for is quality time with the kids, food in her belly, a roof over her head, and reasonable clothing to keep her warm in Old Blighty. Unfortunately, Chinese  men probably do not share the European man&rsquo;s attraction for the doe-eyed, dusky damsels that the nation of India  has to offer &hellip;</p>

<p>Other races seems to regard Asian women as generally easy to pickup for a relationship. An average nerdy white guy can, if he comes across right, get a girl way out of his marketplace value in Asian terms. I sympathize with Asian men in this regard as it isn&rsquo;t fair for other biological groupings with different sexual selection indicators (whether white, black, middle eastern, and others) to distort their mating market. </p>

  &mdash;   I think this is your own perception and stereotyping. Let&rsquo;s say what you assert is true, this still hasn&rsquo;t stopped white russian women from marrying chinese men. Or nonasian women in Brazil from taking up with the local japanese men there&hellip; Not to mention the fact that east asian women are still pairing with their own race men (east asians have the highest population in the world you know). </p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;Other races seems to regard Asian women as generally easy to pickup for a relationship. An average nerdy white guy can, if he comes across right, get a girl way out of his marketplace value in Asian terms. I sympathize with Asian men in this regard as it isn&rsquo;t fair for other biological groupings with different sexual selection indicators (whether white, black, middle eastern, and others) to distort their mating market.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
  &mdash;   For most nonasian male-asian female couples (in America) that I&rsquo;ve come across I rate both partners roughly the same in physical beauty (like the facebook founder and his chinese gf) OR the nonasian male is the better looking one. Seldom have I seen a PRETTY asian female with a nonasian male; they are usually with the asian males. My white neighbor is married to a japanese girl and I think he looks better than her honestly. He&rsquo;s a handsome chap with a good job while she&rsquo;s a chunky stay-at-home mom and not a looker by any means. Another is this tall decent looking acquaintance of mine of pure dutch extraction who is currently dating a rather unattractive indonesian lady. And these are not isolated examples at all. So WHO is really getting the other &#8220;way out of his marketplace value&#8221; in regards to looks and abilities? </p>
<p>Ironically, I&rsquo;ve seen some handsome white women with unpleasant looking nonwhite men. One black man I know (and he is no looker even though he think he is but is physically fit I admit) has dated/cohabitated with several handsome white women and even had children with a couple of them. I am sure these white women would have been courted by any white men if given a chance.</p>
<p>Ultimately statistics show that the majority of asian women end up marrying asian men and this supports what I and others have noticed in real life. I acknowledge the possibility that the future interracial dating/marriage scene for asians in America may well be different from what it is now. And this applies to the other races too. </p>
<p>Anyway, much of what one hears on the internet CONTRARY to reality is just male ego stroking or a form of therapy for the frustrated soul.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the reality I always notice around myself as well.  East Asian women who are in relationships outside the race aren&rsquo;t exactly the cream of the crop.  And the white female in white female-black male couples, of course one or two out of 100 white women in relationships with black males might be beautiful, but about 99% of white females in a relationship with black males are not exactly attractive.  </p>

<p>That way White men won&rsquo;t have to deal with the headaches which follow from the endless whining about 50/50 domestic chore-splitting, the history of &#8216;oppression,&rsquo; ridiculous notions of &#8216;fairness&rsquo; and &#8216;equality,&rsquo; and on and on and on!</p>

		<p>Maybe if more White men would stop partaking in the Asian women that are so eager to crawl all over us, then Chinese men wouldn&rsquo;t be seeking our women.</p>
<p>I see nothing wrong with Whites and Asians mating though. The offspring will be much more intelligent and much better looking than part black offspring. Asians tend to despise Blacks too, which is a major turnon for me!</p>

		<p>Why are there so many miscegenists trolling on this site?  As a white advocate, I oppose all mating between races.  Actually, I don&rsquo;t care what nonwhites do, but whites who cross the mating line are traitors of the worst kind and deserve shunning, if not worse.  </p>

<p>I repeat. I am taller than majority of men of all races around me. ^^</p>
<p>If you want to hear a little bit about the marriage trend among athletes in Canada&hellip;.  I am a fan of the Toronto Blue Jays and, more than one Caucasian player in the Toronto Blue Jays organization is in a relationship with a black woman.  </p>
<p>This is a picture of Adam Lind.  He is actually one of everyone&rsquo;s favourite Blue Jays at the moment.  He is one of the best hitters Blue Jays ever had.  but,,, he is married to a black woman. </p>

<p>If you head down a little in the page below, you can see the picture of Adam Lind and his wife and their dog.  </p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/kuqq7u</p>
<p>Another friend of mine said, &#8220;Adam Lind unknowingly married Juan Pierre Jr. with a wig on&#8221; and that amused me.</p>
<p>Juan Pierre Jr. <a href="https://tinyurl.com/2cwk8p4" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2cwk8p4</a></p>
<p>The white woman with brown hair in this picture is Jason Frasor&rsquo;s wife, who has been pitching for Blue Jays for many years by now.</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/2cv6jhg" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2cv6jhg</a></p>
<p>She is, honestly, one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen in my life, and the prettiest woman married to an athlete that I can think of&hellip;. </p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/2gy6oca    https://tinyurl.com/2ecnku2</p>
<p>the second prettiest woman married to an athlete that I can think of is the country singer Carrie Underwood, who is married to Ottawa Senators forward/assistant captain, Mike Fisher.  </p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/24jyc7q" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/24jyc7q</a>  </p>
<p>Mike Fisher is British Canadian.  The city Mike Fisher grew up in, is only about an hour drive away from Toronto.  </p>

		<p>As a White female, I prefer my own race.  Though they come off as very reserved at first, I believe that Asian men are very good looking and intelligent with awesome personalities after you get to know them.  It&rsquo;s getting there that takes more time than with men of other races.  </p>
<p>On a shallow note, the men my age - I&rsquo;m now in my 50s - and older were too short for me.  I was on the tall side of average for a White female.  I am convinced that height discrimination is what made many White women not consider Asian men in the past.  I have never dated outside my race, but I have never been with a guy who is shorter than me.  He always had to have at least two inches on me.  </p>
<p>I do notice the younger Asian men seem to be catching up to Whites height-wise.  The only thing holding them back with White women is their natural reserve and own innate shyness.  I have noticed the more Americanized Asian boys with White girls on a nearby college campus.</p>
<p>Though I would prefer NO intermarriage, I do believe that, of all the races; Caucasian, black, Mestizo, Asian that Whites and Asians seem to be the most compatible and have the most in common.  So, if I were to venture outside my race, I would look at the Asians before any other non-White race.<br>

		<p>I agree with poster #49 that this whole idea of orientals going after White women is ridiculous.  Someone with some money might  be able to buy one but as far as natural attraction goes, they&rsquo;re just too asexual looking and lack masculine qualities.  I&rsquo;m sure the leftist organizations won&rsquo;t waste any time putting their actors on the streets with visual propaganda to back up their articles in the Washington Post and other media.   </p>

		<p>I once received a letter from another AmRen reader, who appear to be a married Southwest Asian male who identified himself as &#8220;Subutai Chen&#8221;, and he asked me,</p>
<p>why I regularly read and comment on AmRen which is such a white racist website, and told me that Asians should work hard to put an end to the white race.  </p>
<p>and I told him that it simply does not interest me to see any race in the world to become extinct, and I have no intention to actually make any effort to see any race in the world become extinct.  It does not give me any pleasure to watch any race become extinct.  My life is too short.  </p>

		<p>Well, there sure seems to be a lot of white men going after asian women. From what I have read, a white man with an asian women makes up the highest number of inter-racial marriages in the United States of America. Even more so that black-white marriages from what I understand.</p>

		<p>Korean guy say&#8221;If Chinese men have no choice but choosing a woman between a black woman who was raised in North America or a muslim woman who grew up in a predominantly muslim country, he should go for the black woman, I agree&#8221;</p>
<p>never.. actually many chinese think indians are very beautiful&hellip;.bollywood films used to be big in china. many actually think they are better looking than western caucasians.<br>
. apparently most muslim women are lighter than indians..so they would be more appreciated..the middle eastern type female is usually calm,feminine looking with huge,innocent eyes..considered beautiful in traditional chinese culture.</p>
<p>of course some would choose a black woman if he can live in america over an iranian woman living in iran, but if choosing a wife and still live in china, most would pay to avoid black women..there was a joke on chinese net about a very ugly black billionairess looking for husband around the world titled&#8221; marry her, your will never need to strive in your whole life&#8221;.<br>
it shows how black females are despised..</p>
<p>persoanlly I would prefer any woman not to be raised in western countries,certainly I mean current degenerate ones</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;korean guy&#8221; you brought here a lot of wrong info..on purpose?</p>
