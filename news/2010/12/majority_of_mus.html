			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Meris Lutz, Los Angeles Times, December 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A majority of Muslims around the world welcome a significant role for Islam in their countries&rsquo; political life, according to a new poll from the Pew Research Center, but have mixed feelings toward militant religious groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah.</p>
<p>According to the survey, majorities in Pakistan, Egypt, Jordan and Nigeria would favor changing current laws to allow stoning as a punishment for adultery, hand amputation for theft and death for those who convert from Islam to another religion. About 85% of Pakistani Muslims said they would support a law segregating men and women in the workplace.</p>
<p>Muslims in Indonesia, Egypt, Nigeria and Jordan were among the most enthusiastic, with more than three-quarters of poll respondents in those countries reporting positive views of Islam&rsquo;s influence in politics: either that Islam had a large role in politics, and that was a good thing, or that it played a small role, and that was bad.</p>
<p>Turkish Muslims were the most conflicted, with just more than half reporting positive views of Islam&rsquo;s influence in politics. Turkey has struggled in recent years to balance a secular political system with an increasingly fervent Muslim population.</p>
<p>Many Muslims described a struggle in their country between fundamentalists and modernizers, especially those who may have felt threatened by the rising tides of conservatism. Among those respondents who identified a struggle, most tended to side with the modernizers. This was especially true in Lebanon and Turkey, where 84% and 74%, respectively, identified themselves as modernizers as opposed to fundamentalists.</p>
<p>In Egypt and Nigeria, however, more people were pulling in the other direction. According to the poll, 59% in Egypt and 58% in Nigeria who said there was a struggle identified with the fundamentalists.</p>

		<p>Adultery was illegal in the US until recently in some states except the punishment wasn&rsquo;t stoning and workplace segregation of the sexes wasn&rsquo;t needed bc women worked at home. Driving was considered unwomanly. Back then Blacks knew their place and White immigrants learned to assimilate and the Latinos were few &amp; quiet. Then you kicked God out of politics bit by bit every decade. Faith &amp; Politics MUST re-integrate</p>

		<p>Maybe it will start catching on here what the Europeans already know (and their politicians will not admit).  Islam cannot merge with the west without one of them disappearing.  I doubt I would be treated so nicely if I said I want full rights for women in Saudi Arabia while I was living there.  I hope it goes another few steps further to wake up everyone on the &#8220;left&#8221; coast.  I hope a few local Nigerians chop off the hands of a few Mexican children for stealing from their shops.  Let the people know their true intent and hopefully nature will take its course.  </p>
<p>One can only hope that the Catholic illegals will mob the local Muslims, killing two birds with one stone.</p>

		<p>Muslim&rsquo;s have some nerve calling Islam a &#8216;religion&rsquo;. Stoning people to death (only women though, so I&rsquo;ve heard), hand amputation, segregating men and women like they&rsquo;re children unable to control themselves. Well, given the way they &#8216;practice&rsquo; their &#8216;religion&rsquo;, emotionally and mentally they are children. Mean, dangerous, and destructive children. Now, why should we want them in our country? I sure don&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>If a person can be killed for converting to another religion then they are not members of a religion but are members of a gang or cult. </p>
<p>I respect the rights of people to practice whatever religion they wish but there has to be a choice. </p>

		<p>I assume that Muslims only want women who commit adultery stoned.  In Shia Islamic countries men can side step laws of adultery by having a temporary marriage, which can last as little as one day.  You give the hooker $50, you say, &#8220;We&rsquo;re married for the night!&#8221; (or something equivalent), you get laid, and in the morning your &#8220;marriage&#8221; is dissolved.  That&rsquo;s the sort of marriage law we can expect from a religion that was founded by a man who had multiple wives including a 9 year old girl.<br>
