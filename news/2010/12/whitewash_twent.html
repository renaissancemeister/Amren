			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), December 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Oxford and Cambridge are fending off allegations of racial exclusion today after it was revealed that 21 of their colleges made no offers to black students last year.</p>
<p>The worst offender is Oxford college, Merton, which has admitted no black students in the last five years and just one in the last decade.</p>
<p>With the controversial Commons vote on tuition fees to take place on Thursday, seeking to charge students up to Â£9,000 per year, there are fresh fears that students from disadvantaged backgrounds will be squeezed out.</p>
<p>However, the data reveals that it as already a serious problem at Oxford and Cambridge, which are expected to charge the maximum fees.</p>
<p>Requests made under the Freedom of Information (FoI) Act by the Labour MP David Lammy also revealed that Oxford&rsquo;s social profile is 89 per cent upper and middle-class, while the figure is 87.6 per cent at Cambridge.</p>
<p>The national average at British universities is 64.5 per cent, according to the admissions body Ucas.</p>
<p>A lack of racial diversity also applies to staff, with the FOI data also showing that of more than 1,500 academic and lab staff at Cambridge, none are black, although 34 are of British Asian origin.</p>
<p>The latest figures on undergraduate admissions from Oxford, published on its website, shows that there was no shortage of black candidates  &mdash;  with 35 applications  &mdash;  but just one student of black Caribbean descent was accepted.</p>
<p>Cambridge accepted six black Caribbean undergraduates for the academic year beginning autumn 2009.</p>
<p>Eleven Oxford colleges and 10 Cambridge colleges made no offers to black students that year.</p>
<p>The picture is slightly different when it comes to students from other backgrounds with 77 students of Indian descent accepted.</p>
<p>However, that still represents a low acceptance percentage because the number came from 466 applications.</p>
<p>Though both universities have programmes to encourage applications from black and working-class backgrounds,the figures reveal white students had higher success rates than black applicants at every Cambridge college except one.</p>
<p>At St Catharine&rsquo;s, black candidates have had a 38 per cent success rate, compared with 30 per cent for white students.</p>
<p>The universities argue that they have a narrow pool from which to draw candidates and that black candidates are more likely to apply to elite universities, resulting in the low acceptance rate.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Oxford said: &#8216;Black students apply disproportionately for the most oversubscribed subjects, contributing to a lower than average success rate for the group as a whole.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>Typical upper crust snobbery.  You could be poor _and_ white with equivalent 4.0+ GPA (for UK) and still not be good enough for some of the top universities.</p>
<p>And you know what?  I&rsquo;m glad.  Because at the very least it means that SOMEONE STILL KNOWS WHAT&rsquo;S RIGHT.  Even if they don&rsquo;t act on it in favor of their people as much as their clique`.</p>
<p>That said, they are still screwing themselves with Indians and Asians.</p>
<p>Because the birth rates and huge wealth bases these groups bring with them will inevitably begin to take a toll on British White upper classes.  And from the upper class with a country house, it will become &#8220;Why -can&rsquo;t- I have a real (inheritable) Title?&#8221;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the key to getting in.</p>
<p>Because a White business and commercial elite will have no answer to that question when those whose money and good will they so desperately need on their side to control the unruly hordes of enemy ethnies they have imported as economic wage slaves come knocking for a favor of their own.</p>
<p>And be sure of this too:  A Caste Conscious Asian or Indian may not breed down if he can avoid it in a land where he stands out even more than at home.  But he will certainly REACH DOWN if lifting someone up gives him political clout.</p>
<p>Kennedy once said: &#8220;The best way to get something done is to let someone else take credit for it.&#8221;  That includes getting huge immigrant populations to break down glass ceilings &#8216;unless&rsquo; you get what you want.</p>
<p>This is an all or nothing racial contagion.  It can only be defeated by all classes against all comers using all possible resource conservation amongst our own.  Failure to realize this will only lead to massive fragmentation of our culture base.  A culture which cannot sustain itself without mass and protective isolation.</p>

		<p>Notice that the article does not say there was discrimination against Blacks. The claim is that there were qualified Black students who were not admitted; not that there were better or even equally qualified. What the schools did was simply select the best of the applicants with a lack of discrimination in favour of Black applicants.</p>
<p>I never thought Liberal insanity would envelope the U.K.; I was wrong.</p>

		<p>White is right, Black is whack:</p>
<p>Tennessee State Univeristy a Black college in Nashville is 50% White. Two other Black colleges North Carolina A&T; University in Greesnboro, North Carolina is 35% White. Bluefield State University in West Virginia in 90% White.</p>
<p>In fact, a large number of the faculty at these schools are White. The majority of Whites who attend these institutions recieve free scholarships given the fact that they add to the diversity of the school. </p>
<p>One of my co-workers (White like me) had a relative that attended a Black college with full financial aid and is now completing her Law degree from Yale University in the spring.</p>
<p>I just recently read an article on a young White man who was his class valedictorian at Morehouse College a Black male college in Atlanta a few years ago. He now has a killer job on Wall Street and is a public speaker. Nice going for someone who is only in his mid 20!</p>
<p>A number of Whites that attend these types of schools tend to do pretty well.  <br>

		<p>What the Left/liberals forget is that to attend such a college, you need to have minimum qualifications, be able and willing to pay the fees as well as live locally, and most important be able to reach the qualification standards where you are in competition with others who have reached and exceeded the standards.  Affirmative action is not good as proven in the USA and places like South Africa.  &#8220;In pursuit of excellence&#8221;  not mediocrity or just for political expediency must be the principle.</p>

		<p>&hellip;..&lsquo;Black students apply disproportionately for the most oversubscribed subjects, contributing to a lower than average success rate for the group as a whole.&rsquo;&hellip; Yes, blacks do apply but not for &#8216;hard&rsquo; science and engineering subjects and elect instead for &#8216;soft&rsquo; media studies or those which will lead to a career in social work in local government. Since most blacks demand these options, they join a queue for limited places and only those with the highest GCSE scores will be selected.. of course! Blacks are least likely to gain high GCSE scores anyway but &#8216;hard&rsquo; science subjects demand a very high standard indeed, and so should it be. So this article should be read in context&hellip; not that black applicants are rejected because they are black but that they simply don&rsquo;t qualify. Not only that but they expect only places in the &#8216;oxbridge&rsquo; colleges instead of aiming for those who would better cater for their needs and realistic aspirations. In UK we have no HBCU institutions although if blacks wanted to start a totally black university or college all they have to do is simply do it. I&rsquo;d love to see a draft prospectus.</p>

		<p>Let me take a wild guess that those 21 colleges are teaching hard science and the like and are in no way connected with any arts, social sciences or communication studies.</p>
