<h1>Bush, Putnam Discuss Importance of Immigrant Integration</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Cyndy Liedtke Hogan, National League of Cities, December 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Referring to themselves as an &#8220;odd couple,&#8221; Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida, and Robert Putnam, professor of public policy at Harvard University, came together during the Congress of Cities &amp; Exposition to discuss an issue important to them both  &mdash;  immigrant integration in the United States. </p>
<p>&#8220;We both believe in this larger, angry debate .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. one crucial issue is largely ignored,&#8221; Putnam said. &#8220;We have a lot of immigrants and we are not doing enough to integrate them into American life.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope Congress gets its act together and realizes it&rsquo;s important to get this done. We need comprehensive immigration reform,&#8221; Bush said. </p>
<p>He added later, &#8220;The dreams of immigrants become American dreams.&#8221;</p>
<p>Putnam offered an historical perspective, saying that there has always been turmoil and tension when it comes to integrating immigrant groups into American society. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Managing language and the acquisition of English is, and always has been, an important part of the process, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He [Bush] also cautioned against &#8220;lowering the bar&#8221; for immigrant children in schools. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bush said one of the great success stories of American history is the nation&rsquo;s ability to absorb people from all walks of life to pursue their dreams.</p>
<p>This is also an economic issue, Bush said. The country needs to grow the population to have young, dynamic people to be the workers of the future.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When asked how to change the paradigm from exclusion to inclusion, Bush said it&rsquo;s an economic necessity  &mdash;  a high-growth economy &#8220;requires that we solve this issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact is immigrants are aspirational,&#8221; Bush said. &#8220;They came here to add to their lives because they couldn&rsquo;t do it where they lived. Policies need to get in line with that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Putnam said the payoffs for inclusion are huge and called for funding for English training. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Both Bush and Putnam said they oppose the Arizona immigration law, citing how their own children or grandchildren could be targeted because of their background and how they look.</p>
<p>They also agreed that deporting illegal immigrants from across the country would cost billions and not be very effective.<br>

		<p>All here should understand the reality that the Bush Family is almost identical to the Kennedy Family. Only the Bush Family presents itself as the leaders in pandering to Hispanics/Latinos, Kennedys go for Blacks and all third worlders.</p>
<p>No in the either the Kennedy family or the Bush family ever, ever works in any type of real job, both families go to Harvard and Yale or both and then they have some slightly different spin on the Harvard and Yale - Internationalism, global economy. Both these elites enjoy the benefits of loyal NW servants/slaves and find ways so that no member of their family ever has to go to a rough NW public school, public hospital, use public transportation etc.</p>
<p>Barbara Bush was quoted in the late 1990s that she didn&rsquo;t know what a super market check out price scanner was - because Barbara Bush has never done any of her own shopping in ~ 50 years!</p>
<p>Most racially aware White know to how to react whenever the Kennedy name is brought up - some new Kennedy&hellip; the Kennedys are our enemies. It has to become the same with the Bush family. </p>

		<p>Not surprising that Jeb would side with this debacle, since his bride is hispanic. He would probably have his clothes thrown out in the street if he didn&rsquo;t. Part of the reason why G W took the stand he took on it. Blood is always thicker than water.</p>

		<p>Robert Putnam self-censored his research on the corrosive affects of multicultural and multiracial societies on social cohesion. He is still twisting and turning in a, hopefully, vain attempt to guilt-trip white America into doing more to overcome the consequences of immigration, with the proffered hope that our non-white friends can be induced into become good citizens, if only we lower the bar by becoming more like them.</p>

<p>I tell ya folks, if this clueless idiot gets the White House or anywhere near it, we&rsquo;re done! Are you folks as tired as I am of these soft bellied White BOYS telling us how it&rsquo;s going to be? This little wuss has never done a hard days work in his life and only got where he did because of daddy and his money, and could&rsquo;ve never made it on his own if he had to. He also has never and will never have to live among these &#8220;immigrants&#8221; as we do.

		<p>Integrate enough immigrants into American life and you will no longer have the American way of life that they came to take advantage of; welfare benefits, removal from the American economy of hundreds of millions, if not billions remitted to relatives in their countries of origin, if undocumented, no income or social security taxes and jobs that might otherwise be available to Americans whose families have been here for generations. They are economic refugees who are being supported primarily by working (if they still have jobs) White Americans. The net effect of their presence and continued influx, if unchecked, will ultimately be the end of America as we knew it, replaced by an alien demographic capable of only supporting a Third World level of civilization.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Integration&#8221; </p>
<p>The word is the new salespitch, consigning &#8216;multiculturalism&rsquo; to the dustbin. </p>
<p>Western leaders are going to be using this word frequently.  Sarkozy and Merkel have both referrenced it, with the German Chancellor describing it as &#8220;vital&#8221; to the future.</p>
<p>&#8216;Integration&rsquo; is the new label on the old snakeoil.  Rather than admit the failure of immigration, they&rsquo;re promising &#8216;integration&rsquo; will remedy the unfixable.  </p>

		<p>I believe it is the immigrants who are not doing enough to assimilate. It is not like a 100 years ago when people came here wanting to be Americans. Now they come to enjoy the riches, but still think of themselves as Mexicans, Guatemalans, etc.</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t want to assimilate, and we do all we can to make it easy for them not to, they will continue as they are doing now.</p>

		<p>There are two huge differences between the flood of immigration coming here in recent decades, and the influx of immigrants who came here in the 19th and early 20th centuries.  (1) the earlier influx came here LEGALLY.  Each immigrant was checked for criminal history, and for contagious diseases.  If either were found, they were sent back home.  They came here seeking freedom and opportunity through hard work, and WANTED to assimilate - nay, they were PROUD to assimilate and be called Americans.<br>
(2)  The current flood of immigrants comes here ILLEGALLY.  Many are criminals and many carry contagious diseases.  Having sneaked across the border, there are no checks on them.  When arrested and deported, they sneak right back in to the country.<br>
They DO NOT come here for freedom and opportunity.  They come to grab the social welfare freebies OUR immigrant ancestors DID NOT HAVE OFFERED THEM.  They come ONLY for those social welfare freebies.  They have NO intention of assimilating.  They intend to keep their culture, their foreign language, and demand WE adopt THEIR culture and THEIR language.  They call us racist and derogatory names.  They despise our history and our culture.  They obviously despise our laws as they break them getting here, and break others while here and tell us &#8220;it&rsquo;s their culture&#8221;.  They insist they not be called Americans - they are Hispanic, or Mexican, or they claim THEY are the REAL Americans and WE are the immigrants.  They will NEVER assimilate.  </p>
<p>Lastly it seems that even the non-hispanic immigrants who come here legally are all of third world cultures and races.  Also they have NO intention of assimilating but set up enclaves of their country and culture among us, refusing to change in any way.<br>
They also largely are from criminal backgrounds or cultures, but no attempt is made to in any way discriminate as to their criminal history, or as to if they come here carrying contagious diseases.  This is an entirely new immigration policy from the old one.  This policy is not one of welcoming freedom seekers with trades and talents, but one of cultural and racial DISPLACEMENT.  White Europeans are discriminated against, but all other racial and ethnic groups, even if criminal in nature at home, are welcomed here to go on our doles, prey upon us criminally, spit upon our culture and values, and demand WE adopt their &#8220;rich&#8221; culture of gangs, organized crime, corruption, beheadings, wife beatings, voodoo, sharia law, etc etc.<br>
Bottom line - immigration policy of today is one of DISPLACING the White race and the builders of this country with parasites who will suck it dry, but vote DEMOCRATIC.<br>

		<p>&#8220;We&#8221; are never &#8220;doing enough&#8221; for them.  Do today&rsquo;s immigrants bear the *slightest* responsibility for doing *anything* for themselves?  Immigrants of the past were not coddled like this, and yet they managed to assimilate.  Then again, most of them were Europeans.  Enough said.</p>

Some Bush Hispanics Family Values:</p>
<p>His wife, Columbia (a Latina), was caught by customs trying to smuggle clothing and jewelry.</p>
<p>His daughter, Nicole(half Latina), is a drug addict and was arrested purchasing illegally obtained drugs.</p>
<p>Son Jeb JR. (half Latino), was found having sex with his girlfriend in a car (The girl was underage but so was he).</p>
<p>Son George P. Bush (half Latino), broke into his ex-girlfriends house and drove his SUV over their lawn. </p>
<p>And this is just one hispanic family with four issues. Multiply that by 11+ million.</p>

		<p>In principle I agree with some of what Jeb is quoted as saying.  Previous generations of immigrants came and made America their home, etc.</p>
<p>But as many posters point out, many of the latest tsunami of immigrants come here illegally and resist efforts to assimilate.  I work with latinos.  About 5% really work hard to assimilate and learn English.  The other 95% are running around waving mexican or dominican flags and outright refuse to gain English fluency.  </p>
<p>What am I to make of this?  Actually, those latinos have a point.  Why should they learn English, especially now that they are taking over demographically is so many regions?  I have had more than one latino tell me that I must learn Spanish, and not their people learn English.  </p>
<p>Yes, we are being displaced, and the pace has reached the point of no return.  The &#8216;Dream&rsquo; Act or any other &#8216;amnesty&rsquo; for illegal entry into this nation will be the final nail in the coffin and then it just becomes a waiting game.</p>

		<p>Two old elitist white guys telling US how to intrepret US laws on the books for national security and to protect US integrity of USA need to take exile to another country.  They are out of the mix and there is no reason to listen them. How could two old out of date isolated men possibly know that the US has been invaded by millions of law breakers who have no intentions of integrating.<br>
Look around any city and it is very apparent non-english speaking foreign born aliens and pregant women are coming here and exhausting our resources with no regard for US!   Old stupid white men are id&rsquo;ed by lack of support for US laws and US economic resources.  They live in the the global world order Bush I set up. They do not know what it is to need a job or to protect Americans from foreign invasion. They do not know what invasion means yet it is US who are forced pay for this ignorance.</p>

		<p>I saw the most ridiculous commercial on TV about a certain restaurant chain.  It shows dozens of restaurant owners being confronted by a very odd looking individuals.  It shows a swarthy looking family (probably latino) and a wife that was probably a zambo asking them who&rsquo;s serving up comfort food like grandma used to make.  Food like meatloaf and mashed potatoes with gravy! </p>
<p>Get real!  The only comfort food her grandma used to make was carne asado and a bowl of menudo.</p>
