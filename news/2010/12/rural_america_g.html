<h1><a href="https://articles.latimes.com/2010/dec/15/nation/la-na-rural-census-20101215">Rural America Gets Even More Sparsely Populated</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Doug Smith and Richard Fausset, Los Angeles Times, Dec. 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The majority of the nation&rsquo;s sparsely populated rural counties lost even more residents in the last decade, though some of the counties   &mdash;   particularly those in the Mountain West   &mdash;   saw population gains that may be the result of retirees striking out for areas that are both scenic and affordable, according to a Times analysis of figures released by the Census Bureau on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The data offer the first detailed portrait of heartland America in a decade, covering the roughly 1,400 counties of fewer than 20,000 people. The numbers also show a growing Latino presence in these counties.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the Times analysis of the numbers shows unequivocally that a thick swath of the country, from north Texas to the Dakotas, has lost population.</p>
<p>Ken Johnson, senior demographer for the Carsey Institute at the University of New Hampshire, has noted that this shift was the case for much of the 20th century, although the country saw rural population growth in the 1970s, as city-dwellers left struggling cities, and another rebound in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Johnson had only begun to study the voluminous data released as part of the Census Bureau&rsquo;s American Community Survey.</p>
<p>But what he had seen thus far, he said, reinforced how much minorities, particularly Latinos, have contributed to population growth in both urban and rural areas.</p>
<p>Between 2000 and 2008, he noted, 51.2% of the entire population increase in the United States has come from Latinos, who represented 15.3% of the population in 2008.</p>
<p>Most of that growth was not from immigration, but from what demographers call &#8220;natural increase&#8221;: between 2000 and 2008, there were 8.2 million Latino births in the U.S. and only 900,000 Latino deaths.</p>
<p>The Times analysis shows significant gains in Latino populations not only in the Southwest, but also in rural counties from Mississippi to the northernmost reaches of Montana.</p>
<p>The Census Bureau projects the current total population of the United States to be almost 311 million, with a net gain of one person every 13 seconds.</p>
<p>Data show that many counties in the Great Plains are also experiencing a loss of young people. Johnson said that trend was probably creating a &#8220;downward spiral&#8221; of population loss in these areas since the young weren&rsquo;t sticking around to bear children.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only thing that might break them out of it,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is an influx of young Hispanics.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Coming from the Los Angeles Times, one of the MOST radically left newspapers in the country, there&rsquo;s no way I would believe them or anybody they&rsquo;re quoting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read a lot of info which claims just the opposite.  People are moving from the cities back to the rural areas, for various reasons, one of which has to do with what one analyst explained was an &#8220;intuition&#8221; that the big urban/suburban areas are going to be undesireable environments, as the economy continues to plummet.</p>
<p>I know in my area in the South for miles around, land is still selling well to people who are leaving the suburbs on the East Coast, North, and the Midwest or who plan to relocate later.  In fact, there doesn&rsquo;t appear to be a real estate crisis here, although land sales have slowed somewhat compared to the super rapid buying that was going on about 3 to 4 years ago.  </p>
<p>I think that we&rsquo;ll see a demographic change takes place as the economy worsens.  I&rsquo;ve gotten a lot of new neighbors in the last 5 years, but none of them are Mexes.  In fact, what mestizos we had working agriculture have dwindled done to very few.  </p>
<p>I would like to ask these LA Times reporters where these mestizos are finding work in rural areas since they don&rsquo;t relocate anyplace where work is scarce, and work IS getting hard to come by for peon labor because the big farms are cutting back also.</p>

<p>I agree with you that cities becoming unsafe to live in is what is driving people to move from the city to the rural country. I try to think ahead and it is not too far fetched to assume that within the next two to five years our major cities will be crime ridden war zones much worse than what is currently going on right now. I would like to move out of the city myself because the area where I live is pretty dangerous, but I have no money to finance a move on that scale and I will most likely have to take my chances within the city. </p>
<p>Also, many of these hispanic immigrants are very hard working people and I have heared of them working on tobacco farms in one hundred degree weather, but there is no denying that they are here for the economic ride and do not care about anything else. If they did care, crime rates among illegal aliens would be as high as they are today. </p>

		<p>Considering the source of the article, I wouldn&rsquo;t give it much credibility.  I moved from a major metropolitan area to a rural area in the upper South to get away from the sprawl, ethnic diversity and crime.  We aren&rsquo;t losing population, we&rsquo;re gaining it from people who had the same idea I had and you very rarely see a hispanic.  In fact our small town nearby is mushrooming into a cosiderable sized city and I&rsquo;m contemplating on moving us to another rural area in the near future to get away from it!  </p>

		<p>Whiterave #2: There are alot of suspect things being reported. I am always amazed how I hear that Whites aren&rsquo;t having babies, but at this year&rsquo;s Christmas Tree lighting I was standing next to two fmilies, alone, that had four children each, and they ranged in age from a year old, to eight years old. </p>
<p>Yesterday, I spoke with a man who just became a grandfather for the 12th time. So take that nonsense with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>We have to remember that disinformation is a big part of our opponents&rsquo; game; to make us think that all is lost. Well, it isn&rsquo;t. </p>

		<p>Where I live in SE Ohio, about the only Mexicans are those running restaurants.  The job market around here is so bad that illegals wouldn&rsquo;t be drawn to it, and the area remains about 95% white.  <br>
Liberals want everyone to believe that the browning of America is well under way so that we will just accept the inevitable.  However, any state that passes an AZ-type law will encourage illegals to go elsewhere.  If all the states get tough, most of the unwanted will head back to Mexico and points south.</p>

		<p>After not being in the area for almost 20 years I noticed a huge Hispanic influx in parts of deep east Texas. When I was a child in SW Louisiana unless you travelled to Houston some 2.5 hours west, you did not see Spanish speaking people but now some churches in the area have Spanish speaking ministries. There was not a huge Hispanic presence in rural Louisiana but in the small towns we drove through to visit family in OK taco stands and Spanish language store fronts were common in a couple of towns where Dairy Queens and Tastee Freezes once ruled.</p>

		<p>In my own hometown, a simple Indiana village of a little less than a thousand people, Mexicans are encroaching upon what was once a typical old Quaker town. They&rsquo;ve taken old woodframe victorians and made them fiesta messes, they disrupt the fabric of the community and become a nuisance, not only to the older people (whom they see as dying old white people) but our young people as well (especially the pretty ones). They have no respect for anything in the community, not its churches (unless they are catholic), not its history, not its graveyards, not even its natural beauty. </p>
<p><br>
Nearby, a larger city once dominated by Euro-Americans who built and created the victorian paradise of Italianate homes and gothic churches Mexicans have flooded into the city. They&rsquo;ve turned an old brick church into a stucco nightmare and they destroy any old shops they get ahold of. At my own family reunion, it saddened me to see a few young women having married these invaders, now young women I can never associate with who&rsquo;s bloodline is over.  They aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;freshening&rdquo; the towns, they are taking them over, like barbarians invading a beautiful Roman city. The younger population of Euro-Americans is increasingly unhappy with them and their careless ways as they ruin what made the town wonderful. The countryside, once a haven for Euro-Americans and our culture, is also being invaded and slowly picked away, town by town, our ancestors legacy is being destroyed. It isn&rsquo;t just New Mexico or California, but Indiana! A state that is mostly Euro-Americans, once a haven for our culture and close to our neighboring Canada, is being taken by invaders.  No where are we left to be, except behind lock doors and shuttered windows whispering quietly in the candle light of what once was a great sun.  Who and what are we if we have no land?<br>

		<p>Here in Northwestern WI there is clearly an increase in Latinos where there was absolute zero presence before.  They DID NOT just wander or migrate up here randomly looking for work.  They were brought or even invited by agricultural employers wanting a cheap labor source.  It is amazing and shameful to see how authorities &#8220;turn their backs&#8221; to the illegal nature of all this.  If one is picked up for speeding, no license, no registration, no insurance, doesn&rsquo;t pay taxes for the HW upkeep, none of it, he is on the street in an hour or so like nothing happened!  </p>
<p>I know this is a bigger problem naturally in the SW, but here in WI, NONE of it would be happening if not for the employers.  NONE.  No jobs, no invasion.  Plain and simple.  In my world, if one of my genuine WI citizen brothers is killed by an illegal, their blood is on the hands of those who hired the illegal.  Period.   </p>

		<p>I read a book by Rich Benjamin called &#8220;Searching for Whitopia.&#8221;  In the back of the book there is an index which lists cities and states where white people are moving to and dominating by their presence.  These are the small cities  &mdash;  the type many of us grew up in.  The book is written by a black man and has its usual criticisms of White America, but the index is worth checking out if you are interested in living in a more homogenous environment.</p>

		<p>Yeah, I know of at least 8 white families that have 4 or more kids. And where I live, I see lots of white couples with 2-3 kids. So I kind of find it hard to believe that the white fertility rate in the US is below replacement. </p>

		<p>In a few years, I plan on buying some rural farmland as a back up for either me or my descendants (I plan to put the land in a family trust so no one after me can sell it.)</p>
<p>Although mexicans are starting to penetrate some rural areas, one thing I can say is that the overwhelming majority of illegals who come here want to ESCAPE the agricultural nightmare they came from.  They want urban areas with lots of free services and opportunities for wheeling and dealing.  </p>
<p>Such latinos (and blacks) don&rsquo;t like rural areas because they will starve and have no giant block parties.  Rural areas, especially in the colder regions, will be the last refuge of whites and the sympathetic non-whites who adopt our values.</p>

		<p>I wonder how many of those spanish speaking people going into the rural areas are &#8220;growers&#8221;.  You know, growers like are invading our national parks and shooting hikers to protect their marijuana crops.  I wonder how many of these hard working spanish speaking people will ensure your grade schooler will have ample supply of this gateway drug, even in the most rural and sedate small towns, eh?  How many of these 30 something &#8220;growers&#8221; will be &#8220;dating&#8221; your 12 year old daughters, rural America?</p>

		<p>I can also hope that if jobs dry up the influx will also dry up. Sadly in east Texas the large meat processing plants has also brought in large numbers of Hispanics. As a truck driver, my husband has picked up loads at any number of meat processing plants- many of them in small towns in rural areas. Sadly with the new jobs come immigrants that will take the messy or unpleasant jobs that native born Americans will not take and other immigrants show up with stores and restaurants catering to the new workers. This really changes the feel of the town. We can hope with ICE cracking down (limited though they are) on illegal immigrants and the ecomomy being so wretched maybe these jobs will be filled by Americans needing work. </p>

		<p>Obviously a lot of mixed reactions to this story and even some questions as to its accuracy. But if America&rsquo;s food basked is in real danger of becoming a 3rd world wasteland perhaps some experienced farmers should be encouraged to immigrate to the USA.</p>
<p>Perhaps automatic refugee status should be offered to any white South African or Rhodesian farm family who thinks they are at risk of being murdered on or dispossed of their farm. I sure they would prefer to go to your country rather than Georgia. And I am sure one white family could offer more in the way of farm productivity than a hundred Mexicans or or any other 3rd world immigrant group.</p>
<p>The help them resettle some of the so called Black Farm compensation funds could be used. This way the US Taxpayer may be getting some real value out of its Dept of Agriculture spending. It would also be helping a group of white people who are facing real danger to their lives and livelihoods as a result of the PC madness that is self destructing the western world.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many of you actually get out into the boondocks.  I drive a truck all over the States, and I see it all.  The biggest reason whites are leaving the city is race.  The biggest reason why whites are leaving the rural areas is train noise.  Train noise is overwhelming, insistent, incredibly loud, and goes  on all night.  Every year it gets worse and worse.  It has driven millions of people out, and is continuing to do so.  The railroads are above the law; in fact, they create the law.</p>
<p>Those of you looking to move out of the urban areas, look hard at where you want to move.  If there are no trains nearby, it may be a good choice.  But for that to be, you will have to be miles away from any major road.  The railroads dominate rural America, and in fact have ruined it.  The solution is easy, but until the regime changes, nothing will be done.  Be careful where you move to.  If there is train noise, it won&rsquo;t go away, it will only get worse.  It makes for a bad life.</p>

		<p>Regarding the influx of mestizos, the rural areas of northern New York in the Hudson and Mohawk Valleys are loaded with them.  Someone I know who works in the dairy industry and visits different dairy farms daily in the Amsterdam/Utica area says some farms and agricultural processing plants&rsquo; entire workforces are Mexican and Central American.</p>
<p>He says the Latins rarely venture into town except to visit emergency rooms for free medical care.  Like a typical spineless, white drone  my acquaintance doesn&rsquo;t see the invasion as a threat because he says, &#8220;They&rsquo;re nice guys when you get to know them.&#8221; As if America should surrender itself because the invaders smile when they greet him.</p>
<p>In Saratoga, known for its race track and the Revolutionary War battle, two rapes of white women by illegal mestizos have made the papers recently. One of the rapists was a worker on a dairy farm in the countryside.  </p>
<p>Of course, the media downplayed the race and status of the perpetrators and never mentioned the race of the victims.</p>
<p>In sum, mestizos are invading rural New York and Vermont, and the white &#8216;patriots&rsquo; who parade around on Memorial Day and Veterans Day here pretend the invasion is nothing to worry about.</p>

		<p>I agree with the poster who said it is employers who are to blame, at least in part. <br>
In Pennsylvania, as you may know, there has been an increase in drilling for oil in the northern part of the state. Previously rural, quiet and very white areas are now flooded with traffic, and lots of people from all over.There has been an increase in the number of Spanish. The area now has a growing Spanish-speaking population to accomodate in schools. The influx of people from all over has brought an increase in crime as well. To be fair, this is not always because of Spanish people. But, they are now there, as they are also in cities like Allentown and Bethlehem, and other smaller cities in northeast Pennsylvania.</p>
<p> I never thought the small city I once lived near in rural Connecticut would have some 30% Latin population. </p>
<p>Also, if you need accurate demographic information, remember that you can find this information online. Do a search for it, and the census information can be found. You can find out what percentatge of the population is white or not, the religions, sometimes the breakdown of white ethnicity, sometimes even the number of Gay households. The income level of the town/city, the average education, and value of homes can also be found.  </p>
