			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Soeren Kern, Hudson Institute, December 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The city of Barcelona, widely known as a European Mecca of anti-clerical postmodernism, has agreed to build an official mega-mosque with a capacity for thousands of Muslim worshipers. The new structure would rival the massive Islamic Cultural Center in Madrid, currently the biggest mosque in Spain. An official in the office of the Mayor of Barcelona says the objective is to increase the visibility of Muslims in Spain, as well as to promote the &#8220;common values between Islam and Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Barcelona mosque project is just one of dozens of new mosques that are in various stages of construction across Spain. Overall, there are now thirteen mega-mosques in Spain, and more than 1000 smaller mosques and prayer centers scattered across the country, the majority of which are located in Catalonia in northeastern Spain.</p>
<p>The Muslim building spree reflects the rising influence of Islam in Spain, where the Muslim population has jumped to an estimated 1.5 million in 2010, up from just 100,000 in 1990, thanks to massive immigration. The construction of new mosques comes at a time when municipalities linked to the Socialist Party have closed dozens of Christian churches across Spain by way of new zoning laws that several courts have now ruled discriminatory and unconstitutional. It also comes at a time of growing anti-Semitism in Spain.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The idea to build a mega-mosque funded by Spanish taxpayers comes after Noureddine Ziani, a Barcelona-based Moroccan imam, said the construction of big mosques would be the best way to fight Islamic fundamentalism in Spain. &#8220;It is easier to disseminate fundamentalist ideas in small mosques set up in garages where only the members of the congregation attend, than in large mosques that are open to everyone, with prayer rooms, cafes and meeting areas,&#8221; Ziani told the Spanish news agency EFE. He also said European governments should pay for the training of imams, which would be &#8220;a useful formula to avoid radical positions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Barcelona mosque would be that city&rsquo;s answer to the six-story, 12,000 square meter (130,000 square feet) Islamic Cultural Center in Madrid, which opened in 1992 and is one of the biggest mosques in Europe. It was paid for by the government of Saudi Arabia, as was the €22 million ($30 million) Islamic Cultural Center in Málaga, a small city in southern Spain that is home to almost 100,000 Muslims. (The center&rsquo;s website includes politically correct &#8220;news,&#8221; with headlines such as &#8220;Christian Palestine under Zionist Occupation&#8221; and &#8220;Julian Assange Victim of the Empire of Evil.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia, which also built the &#8220;great mosques&#8221; in the Spanish cities of Marbella and Fuengirola, has been accused of using the mosques and Islamic cultural centers in Spain to promote the Wahhabi sect of Islam dominant in Saudi Arabia. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Spain, residents of the Basque city of Bilbao were recently surprised to find their mailboxes stuffed with flyers in Spanish and Arabic from the Islamic Community of Bilbao asking them for money to build a 650 square meter mosque costing €550,000 ($725,000). Their website says: &#8220;We were expelled [from Spain] as Moriscos in 1609, really not that long ago.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The echo of Al-Andalus still resonates in all the valley of the Ebro [ie Spain]. We are back to stay, Insha&rsquo;Allah [if Allah wills it].&#8221;</p>
<p>Al-Andalus was the Arabic name given to the parts of Spain ruled by Muslim conquerors from 711 and 1492. Many Muslims believe that the territories they lost during the Spanish Reconquista still belong to them, and that they have a right to return and establish their rule there  &mdash;  a belief based on the Islamic precept that territories once occupied by Muslims must forever remain under Muslim domination.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Córdoba, Muslims are demanding that the Spanish government allow them to worship in the main cathedral, which had been a mosque during the medieval Islamic kingdom of Al-Andalus and is now a World Heritage Site. Muslims hope to recreate the ancient city of Córdoba as a pilgrimage site for Muslims throughout Europe. Funds for the project to turn &#8220;Córdoba into the Mecca of the West&#8221; are being sought from the governments of the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, and Muslim organizations in Morocco and Egypt.</p>
<p>In Granada, a city in southern Spain that was the last Muslim stronghold of Al-Andalus to capitulate to the Roman Catholic kings in 1492, a muezzin now calls Muslims to prayer at the first mosque to be opened in the city since the Spanish Reconquista. The Great Mosque of Granada &#8220;is a symbol of a return to Islam among the Spanish people and among indigenous Europeans,&#8221; says Abdel Haqq Salaberria, a spokesman for the mosque. &#8220;It will act as a focal point for the Islamic revival in Europe,&#8221; he says. It was paid for by Libya, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>In Lleida, a town in northeastern Spain where 29,000 Muslims make up 20% of the population, the local Islamic association Watani recently asked Moroccan King Mohammad VI for money to build a mosque in the center of town. Local Muslims are incensed that the municipality gave them land to build a mosque on the outskirts of town and not in the city center. {snip}</p>
<p>In Zaragoza, the fifth-largest city in Spain, the 22,000-strong Islamic community has been negotiating the purchase of an abandoned Roman Catholic grade school for €3 million. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} ABC also reports that during 2010, more than 10 Salafist conferences were held in Spain, compared to only one in 2008.</p>
<p>Salafism is a branch of revivalist Islam that calls for restoring past Muslim glory by re-establishing an Islamic empire across the Middle East, North Africa and parts of Europe. Salafists view Spain as a Muslim state that must be reconquered for Islam.</p>

		<p>It took seven centuries for the Christian people of Spain and Portugal to reconquer their countries and the Moorish Mohammedan invasions. From 711 to 1492 Spaniards fought to oust the Mohammedans. Finally the great Isabella and Ferdinand ousted the last of the infidels. Now we have one or two generations of  Spaniards allowing the reconquest of Spain by Mohammedans. Their children will curse them and Juan Carlos Bourbon.</p>

		<p>While Moslems always complain about the Reconquest and what was taken from them (as if it was always theirs!), they fail ever to note that they took it from others who were there before them.</p>
<p>Incidentally, it&rsquo;s interesting to note that &#8220;Al Andalus&#8221;  (or Andalusia), means  &#8220;[land of] the Vandals&#8221;&hellip;. Andal coming obviously from Vandal.</p>
<p>So how did the Moslems get it? By invasion and conquest!</p>
<p>They took it by the sword. And it was taken back from them the same way.</p>
<p>One other point: Any success they might have in this project of reversing history will furnish encouragement to the Mexicans in their similar project of re-conquest. Americans should see that it is not in our own interest to have this happen. We cannot be neutral about this.</p>

		<p>Of course, Spain was under the Muslim yoke for a thousand years (Muslims were not finally ejected until 1492 which is, coincidentally the year of Columbus&rsquo;s first voyage).<br/>
  The formative story of Spain was one of a bitter, protracted hard fought battle over centuries in which the indigenous christian Spaniards attempted to re-assert their claim upon the land of their ancestors.No quarter was given on either side, when the Spanish finally won *every* Muslim was kicked out.<br/>
  It seems, alas, that the struggles and travails of their ancestors have had zero genetic or racial memory amongst modern Spaniards.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure that present-day Spanish schools and textbooks have been teaching the Marxist revisionist view of history&hellip; probably even more extreme than that in the USA. White guilt! White guilt!  </p>
<p>They have been taught to feel guilty for their empire and conquests abroad. They have been made ashamed of their &#8220;oppression&#8221; of other races and religions. They now feel that they owe the world for their past &#8220;sins&#8221;. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 1492 finally  getting even! It took half a thousand years, but they&rsquo;re all back again.  And looking for vengeance.   </p>

		<p>The European race had fought for centuries to reclaim what was rightfully theirs from the Muslims. How can the Spanish sleep at night, knowing they are throwing away everything their ancestors fought and died for? The people who gave up their very existence so that their descendants may live in a European Spain. What of Isabella? Is she now an evil white supremacist?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Such trends disturb me, Islam has never been, and never will be a friend of Europe. Just look at the history between Islam and Europe! It has never worked out and never will, until Islam dominates Eurabia.<br/>

		<p>The Spanish of Spain have one of the lowest birth rates in Europe. They are a quickly dying race and the Muslims will dance on their graves. It is astonishing that the Europeans in general have been such suicidal saps with their sucker-hearted Kumbyya immigration policies. The fast growing Muslim population will not be a tolerant multicultural people sensitive to &#8220;diversity&#8221; and freedom. Islam is an extremely intolerant totalitarian system and their Koran is full of disdain for the Infidel. Wherever Muslims dominate they essentially wipe out previous cultures and institute their Islamic sharia.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is one source?</p>
<p>&#8220;March 12th, 2000, at the Vatican in Rome, Pope John Paul II formally asked forgiveness for the various sins committed by the Catholic Church over the last two millennium. In his &#8220;Day of Pardon&#8221; homily, the pope confessed:</p>
<p>    &#8220;&hellip; we cannot fail to recognize the infidelities to the Gospel committed by some of our brethren, especially during the second millennium. Let us ask pardon for the divisions which have occurred among Christians, for the violence some have used in the service of the truth and for the distrustful and hostile attitudes sometimes taken towards the followers of other religions.&#8221;</p>
<p><br/>
&#8220;It is called the death knell by Western Christian clerics.<br/>
And to think I have lived to watch the world die,…. not with a bang,but with a whimper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; Just as in the Christian penned &#8220;Gotterdammerung&#8221; when Northern Europe&rsquo;s indigenous religion was destroyed, Christianity is in turn, destroying itself.  Just a quick review of the history of Church Schism is enough to reveal that there never way much more than a political power war being waged between Orthodox and Roman Christianity as remnants of the old Roman Empire.  It was excesses and abuses by the Church in Western Europe that led to the internal rebellion of the Reformation there.  But it is the Christian world that is ending, with its continual contradictions, abuses and exploitations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the modern Isabella and Ferdinand? Where is King Arthur?<br/>
Where is a righteous monarch?&#8221;</p>
<p>The monarchies that are left in Europe have been politically neutered because their previous rule was hugely unjust and even murderous to their own people.  The Church (pick your brand) recreated the Pagan Roman Emperor worship in giving divine right to rule as political support for their cooperation.  A thousand years of misrule has exhausted the institution, leaving us with their tabloid friendly doings and cheap photographic opportunities for a depraved public, hungry for more proof of the less than divine &#8220;betters.&#8221;  Similarly, Church clergy is constantly revealed to be some sort of exclusive club for sexual perversion and the perverse, thanks to modern improvements in communication and forsensics.  Today&rsquo;s monarchs dare not speak one word in support of nationalism.  They dare not do a thing other than attend the most hollow ceremonies or revel in supporting former colonials and Commonwealth  members.</p>
<p>Islam is moving into the void created by a Europe exhausted by Christianity.  Some Europeans rightly perceive that Islam seeks only to repeat as many abuses as possible.  But that Europeans can ever fight holy wars under the aegis of any belief system is incredible.  </p>

<p>This is something I think about a great deal.  That is why, as an intellectual atheist myself, I have searched for some way through this problem.  I think I found it some time ago.</p>
<p>White Christians suffer from the delusion that their Christianity identifies them racially and culturally, when they are merely the new generation of baptized and indoctrinated at birth believers.  The blind spots created by this sort of from the cradle brainwashing is inadequate for facing the challenge the problem of white-European survival.</p>
<p>As I have been fascinated with history all my life, I particularly focused on European history in the past two decades.  Christianity seeks to survive for its own sake first, for European culture second.  And the European culture it seeks to support is one rooted hard in its ultimately Middle Eastern cultural source.  It actually makes itself prone to Muslim adhesion because Islam created itself as a competing brand of belief.  It is just as fraudulent as Christianity.  Only Judaism has any real cultural root because it springs from a tribal origin and actually represents a creation story and then a god, who starts out clearly as a war god before becoming like Hammurabi, a law giver.  I think that this is why thousands of years later, a group, perhaps the most continually persecuted in the history of the world not only survives, but managed to reestablish its ancient state almost two thousand years after it is conquered and broken up.</p>
<p>The answer is Ancestor Worship.  It is natural to revere your departed ones and this mode of worship seems to have been included in all indigenous religions before the perversion of Christianity and Islam came along to replace it with a usurpation of the old virgin birth, son as savior - becomes king myth cycles combined with the ultimate in pagan sacrifices and cannibalism, albeit symbolically.</p>
<p>Many neo-pagan groups have come into being all over the Western World and especially in Europe.  Asatru, Wicca, Druids, Pagan earth spirituality, all have returned because white people long for more than the spiritual blackmail of Christianity or the demands of Islam.  Asatru is attractive to me because while I take actual belief of gods and goddesses with a grain of salt, I feel the urge to honor my ancestors and pass on their memory and glory to my children a valid act that supports not only my personal heritage, but my race. This answers the main issue that many a white Christian continually laments and fumes over on these Amren posting pages. Will they learn a new way?  I cannot say, but I am afraid likely not.  The ability to change for survivals sake requires a free mind.  I don&rsquo;t see much elasticity in the Christian comments I am always reading here.  But I go on, hoping to be wrong.</p>
