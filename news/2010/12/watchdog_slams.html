			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Breaking News (Ireland), December 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ireland&rsquo;s record on eliminating racial discrimination was criticised by the human rights watchdog today.</p>
<p>The Irish Human Rights Commission (IHRC) demanded the Government do more to protect the rights of asylum seekers, the Traveller community, migrant workers and victims of human trafficking.</p>
<p>Dr Maurice Manning, IHRC president, said: &#8220;Ireland is a multi-ethnic country but regrettably racial discrimination is a problem here.</p>
<p>&#8220;Effective human rights and equality bodies are required to monitor and combat racial discrimination, the restoration of the resources to carry out this work is essential.&#8221;</p>
<p>Launching a report to commemorate Human Rights Day, Dr Manning said Travellers have experienced racial discrimination for generations yet are not recognised as an ethnic minority.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not enough good quality halting sites are being provided to the Traveller Community by local authorities,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The criminal trespass legislation criminalises trespass on public land in circumstances where public authorities have systematically failed in their statutory obligations to house Traveller families.</p>
<p>&#8220;Travellers also continue to achieve poor educational outcomes and are in very poor health compared to the general population.</p>
<p>&#8220;Severe cuts in funding to essential services can only compound these problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elsewhere the IHRC raised concerns about safeguarding the rights of asylum seekers as they try to enter the country and while refugee applications are processed.</p>
<p>Dr Manning said once in the system, people seeking asylum are spending too long waiting for their applications to be processed.</p>
<p>&#8220;This needs to be tackled urgently as the long stay in hostels, prohibition on working and social isolation are among the causes of worrying levels of poor mental health among asylum seekers,&#8221; he continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;The direct provision payment of â‚¬19.10 per week, which has remained unchanged since 1999, is wholly inadequate and must be revised upwards even in these straitened times.&#8221;</p>
<p>The watchdog also maintained Ireland has insufficient human rights safeguards to protect vulnerable migrant workers and their families, especially those in the hospitality industry, agriculture and women in domestic settings.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Eamonn Mac Aodha, IHRC chief executive, said while 98% of Irish primary schools are under religious patronage, there should be a wider choice for the country&rsquo;s diverse and changing society.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is also clear that legislative and policy changes are required to ensure that people of non-faith and from religious minorities are not deterred from training as teachers or taking up employment as teachers,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The report has been sent to the United Nations Committee responsible for monitoring Ireland&rsquo;s record under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. It is due to report back on Ireland in February. <br>

		<p>&#8220;public authorities have systematically failed in their statutory obligations&#8221;</p>
<p>I am assuming the statutory obligations have been drawn from the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, a wildly provocative United Nations instrument which dates back to the post-colonial 1960&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cerd.htm  </p>
<p>This is just one more example of the many-tentacled United Nations bureaucracy tightening its grip on power, acting as the Supreme Court of the world.</p>

		<p>These government funded human rights &#8216;watch dogs&rsquo; will keep nit picking ad infinitum and finding moral fault simply to justify their own existence and the carears of their diversitycrat-lawyer employees.  </p>
<p>I hardly ever see them involved in defending anyones individual right to freedom of speach in fact they opposit is true and they expend great energy muzzling those speaking out against immigration both legal and illegal, They also impose a sort of orwellian &#8216;doublethink doubletalk&rsquo; terminology on the population and prevent the accumulation and publication of the extraordinarily high ethnic crime figures we see in most western nations.  The facts would be &#8216;hate speech&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>OH YES, more gypsies.</p>
<p>OH YES, more &#8220;asylum&#8221; seekers.</p>
<p>OH YES, more Bantu.</p>
<p>You can NEVER satisfy THEM! More and more and more and more and more.</p>
<p>And what is it, Ireland was just given $100 billion for a debt bailout? for a nation of only 4 million persons! But you need more of THEM to make the place better? Sure!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Ireland&rsquo;s record on eliminating racial discrimination was criticised by the human rights watchdog today.&#8221;</p>
<p>EU representatives the other day, along with global analysts were warning that Ireland will be erupting into mass violence due to forced austerity measures because they&rsquo;re collapsing economically, just as Greece, Portugal and Spain will be doing soon.</p>
<p>I wonder if this fool is grounded enough in reality to understand that the entire country could well degenerate into civil war while he is wringing his hands over non-white privileges.</p>
<p>There is nothing so bizarre and amazing as white diversity fools.</p>

		<p><i>Dr Maurice Manning, IHRC president, said: &ldquo;Ireland is a multi-ethnic country but regrettably racial discrimination is a problem here.</i></p>
<p>Who is he to declare Ireland a &#8220;multi-ethnic country&#8221;? And why do these self-righteous bureaucrats only declare majority white countries as &#8220;multi-ethnic&#8221;?</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Effective human rights and equality bodies are required to monitor and combat racial discrimination, the restoration of the resources to carry out this work is essential.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Yeah. We&rsquo;ve seen how that works. Special privileges for trespassers and an excrement sandwich for everyone else.</p>

		<p>Please note that the Travellers are not related to Roma gypsies.  They are an indigenous Irish &#8220;gypsy&#8221; population.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, they get all sorts of special treatment from the Irish gov&rsquo;t because they are a &#8220;minority&#8221; group.  There&rsquo;s no need for the IHRC to be demanding more for them.</p>

		<p>They should also rename the country. Calling it &#8220;Ireland&#8221; seems pejorative against Travellers, Migrants, and Assylum Seekers. It might be construed as implying that the Irish enjoy some sort of precedence within the country. How about Diversityland?</p>

		<p>If I were to travel to France, it would be to see the rich French history and culture, NOT to see Muslims and Gypsies.  If I were to travel to Ireland, it would be because I wanted to see Irish history and the Irish people, NOT Somalis, Bantus, Hindus etc.  However, the UN&rsquo;s ultimate goal is to so pervert EVERY nation with foreign cultures that there is NO difference between Ireland, France, Germany or Spain.  If UN gets it&rsquo;s way, no nation will be unique in any way, but a polyglot of ethnic tension and competing interests.  When all nations reach that state, wherein there a no unique differences between nations and cultures, the UN has won.  There will then be no reason NOT to adopt One World Order with the UN as the arbitrator and ruler over all.  Get it?</p>

<p>Since when did Ireland become a multi-ethnic country (unless multi-ethnic here is limited only to people of other European descent)? Who gave these Marxist traitors the right to declare Ireland a multi-ethinic country? Not the Irish people. </p>
