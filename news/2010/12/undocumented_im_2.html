<h1><a href="https://laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=381245&amp;CategoryId=12395">Undocumented Immigrants Prepare to Leave Arizona</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Latin American Times Herald (Caracas), December 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Faced with the unlikelihood that the federal government will pass an immigration-reform law any time soon, coupled with the toughening of Arizona&rsquo;s state laws against illegal immigration, many undocumented aliens here are getting ready to go back to their own countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;The situation is getting more and more difficult, not only because it&rsquo;s very hard to find work, but because you can no longer live in peace  &mdash;  you&rsquo;re always afraid of being arrested by the cops,&#8221; Juan Martinez Ramos, an undocumented immigrant from the western Mexican state of Michoacan, told EFE.</p>
<p>The Martinez family is selling all the furniture in their two-room apartment in Phoenix in hopes of raising a little more cash.</p>
<p>&#8220;The American dream is over for us,&#8221; the father of three children, all born in the U.S., said.</p>
<p>The family hopes to leave the state by Dec. 21, in time to get back to Mexico for the Christmas celebrations.</p>
<p>Martinez, 42, who worked in construction for more than seven years, has been out of a job for a year, and during that time has survived doing &#8220;odd jobs&#8221; in private homes, such as repairing walls and roofs and installing windows.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not just the lack of work  &mdash;  now with the SB1070 law they want to make those of us without papers feel like criminals,&#8221; Martinez, who came to the United States 10 years ago crossing the Arizona desert on foot, said.</p>
<p>SB1070, which took effect in July, is the first in the United States to criminalize the presence of undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>Though a federal judge temporarily blocked the most controversial provisions of the law including an article requiring local law enforcement to question the immigration status of people suspected of being undocumented, activists say that the impact has been tremendous among Arizona&rsquo;s immigrant community.</p>
<p>&#8220;SB1070 has had a huge impact not only on the state&rsquo;s economy, but also a psychological and moral impact among immigrant families,&#8221; Magdalena Schwartz, a pastor and activist in Phoenix, told Efe.</p>
<p>She said that many families are getting ready to leave the state this month or next.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some families are going to different states, while others are going back to Mexico,&#8221; the activist, who works with immigrant families in Arizona, said.</p>
<p>She added that some families have told her they are only waiting to file their final tax return in order to leave at the beginning of next year.</p>
<p>Schwartz said that SB1070 has had a powerful psychological impact, since immigrant families are scared of the police and afraid to report abuses.</p>
<p>&#8220;After the general elections were won by conservative Republicans who completely oppose immigration reform, especially here in Arizona, the hopes of many families died,&#8221; the pastor, an immigrant from Chile, said.</p>
<p>The lack of jobs, the economic crisis and, above all, the constant tension in which 34-year-old Rosario Garcia is living led her to take the decision to return to Mexico with her two children in the last week of December.</p>
<p>Garcia, a native of the northern Mexican state of Chihuahua, told Efe that despite all her attempts she has not been able to find work in Tucson, a city where she has lived for 12 years.</p>
<p>For many years Garcia worked as a chambermaid in a number of luxury hotels, but after the state law sanctioning employers went into effect in 2008, it got harder and harder to find work, since every time potential employers compared her information with the E-verify database, they saw she had no permit to work in the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now with SB1070 they&rsquo;re telling us that they don&rsquo;t want immigrants here in Arizona, even though we&rsquo;re the ones who do the most work,&#8221; she said. EFE<br>

		<p>On many items here, we see self-pitying whites talk about how America is finished, our race is dying, nothing can be done to save our European heritage. That&rsquo;s nonsense. Mexicans &amp; other illegals cave in and run away when confronted by any kind of law enforcement. The Arizona law isn&rsquo;t even fully in effect but illegals are already scurrying away. If surrounding states also stand firm, we can have a big success.  The worst sin of some AR posters is despair. Yes, we face a daunting challenge, but we can survive &amp; prosper with sufficient effort. Our opponents are a paper tiger.    </p>

		<p>&#8220;many undocumented aliens in Arizona are getting ready to go back to their own countries.&#8221; And in the minds of many of Arizona&rsquo;s citizens, it can&rsquo;t happen soon enough. Let&rsquo;s hope this ridiculous Dream Amnesty Act is voted down. Then, hopefully, this will be happening all over our country.</p>
<p>Anyone reading this with hope and anticipation, please call or fax your senator and urge him/her to vote NO on the Dream Amnesty Act that they will be voting on this week. Numbersusa.com is a great website that can help with this. With 22 million LEGAL Americans out of work, this Dream Act would be a disaster for our country and its citizens. </p>

		<p>Hey Martinez, the reason you &#8220;feel like a criminal&#8221; is because it&rsquo;s a crime to be here illegally, so you are a criminal. As for &#8220;doing all the work&#8221;, don&rsquo;t kid yourselves, we did quite well without you, in fact much better  your kids are  causing property taxes to go up while you undercut the wages of those actually paying property taxes.  Good riddance.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The American dream is over for us&rdquo;.  Cry me a river.  The &#8220;American Dream&#8221; is for AMERICANS, not illegal border jumpers and invaders.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;now with the SB1070 law they want to make those of us without papers feel like criminals,&hellip;&rdquo;  Guess what, Juan?  You ARE criminals.  &#8216;Nuff said.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;they are only waiting to file their final tax return in order to leave at the beginning of next year.&#8221;  Oh, is that rich, especially when they work for cash and/or off the books.  Guess we evil gringos are supposed to feel guilty about this.  Too bad, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>What this article points out is further proof that mass deportation is not necessary, that they will deport themselves, if all the freebies and handouts are cut off.  Maybe these illegals should go to other Latin American countries, without the proper documents, and see how they fare there.  We know how Mexico deals with illegals, and it ain&rsquo;t nice.<br>

		<p>The idea that illegal immigrants do &#8220;most of the work&#8221; is the Big Lie that employers and immigration radicals alike use to justify nonenforcement of the law.  Arizona, to its great credit, wasn&rsquo;t cowed when it enacted SB1070, a moderate law  since partly gutted in the courts.  It&rsquo;s a hallmark of mass immigration enthusiasts (including those masquerading as journalists) that they see even this modest step as an injustice.  </p>

		<p>I hear alot of these kind of stories coming out of Arizona.  Just keep in mind that they may just be that, stories to make the public think they really are leaving to keep the heat off of them.  If it really were becoming that much more difficult to live in the state it would be far easier for them to pull up stakes and move to another state with lax or no laws on the books rather than return to their own country.</p>

		<p>I agree with commenter #6. They&rsquo;re not heading back to Guatemala, they&rsquo;re shifting over to California or some other state. This story reeks of &#8220;oh poor us.&#8221; Maybe this will get lefties to shed a tear but nobody without diagnosable psychosis. I certainly don&rsquo;t see people in the center crying over a criminal being forced to find another freebie grab.</p>

		<p>I agree with the other posters that they are illegal, that this is a sign of hope, but that we should not be lulled into thinking it is all working itself out.  I am intrigued by the statement about waiting to file a tax return.  No one has to live in a state or country to file an income tax return there, if they so choose, so that is not a real reason.  Two, as others indicated, I imagine most of the work is off the books, so it is not clear that they would report much.  I speculate that they stick around to report under their current identity and claim an earned income tax credit and any child tax credits under their current identities, get the cash from the government, then adopt a new identity if they arrive somewhere else in the U.S.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s hope that more states have the courage to do what Arizona did, and pass a state law to ENFORCE FEDERAL LAW that the feds won&rsquo;t do.  I would like to see our Congress (they won&rsquo;t anytime soon) draft an amendment to the Constitution doing away with automatic citizenship of children born to legal or illegal immigrants.  You&rsquo;d see this country empty out and fast.  State budgets would drop, especially for entitlements.  Crime rates would fall, along with unemployment, because these lawbreaking employers who hire illegals who work under the table, would have to hire Americans legitimately.  What a novel concept, but because it&rsquo;s reasonable and make sense, it will be met with opposition and called racist.</p>

		<p>You are criminals.  You broke the law.  Did you try to assimilate in america by learning to speak english?  Did you take the immigration test?  This is what made America Great.  Immigrants that come to America legally have to take a test and they learn to assimilate. This is what the Melting Pot is about. All of you illegals have not tried to do that.  Some of you think it is your right to be here and you don&rsquo;t have respect for this country or the people that are standing in line to become citizens.  You don&rsquo;t want to stand in line so you decide you are going to break the law and sneak in at night.  YOU BROKE OUR LAWS. And for what it is worth.  I am tired of pressing one for english.  Any company that asks me to do so in the future will no longer get my business.   </p>

		<p>This is the reason the invader wants to hang around to file his income tax return:</p>
<p>https://www.vdare.com/rubenstein/eitc.htm</p>
<p>National Data, By Edwin S. Rubenstein<br>
EITC: How the Tax Code Subsidizes Immigrants (Including Illegals)<br>
Since 1996 the IRS has encouraged taxpayers who are not eligible for Social Security numbers &mdash; basically foreigners, including illegal aliens &mdash; to file income tax returns using income taxpayer identification numbers (ITINs). </p>
<p>At first illegals were wary of applying for the taxpayer numbers, fearing that the IRS would share the information with INS, thereby increasing the likelihood of apprehension. </p>
<p>Silly them! </p>
<p>But now, for various reasons, illegals embrace ITINs. More than seven million ITINs have been issued by the agency. (Table 1)</p>
<p>Many think filing tax returns will help them qualify for amnesty in the future. Moreover, although the IRS supposedly discourages it, banks have begun accepting ITINs in lieu of Social Security numbers on account and mortgage applications. </p>
<p>Some states even issue drivers licenses to illegals with the identification numbers. </p>
<p>By far the most compelling reason for illegals to file tax returns: the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Introduced during the Nixon Administration as an alternative to the negative income tax, the EITC is the largest source of cash aid to the poor. </p>
<p>The EITC works like this: Each additional dollar earned by a family with income below $32,000 and two or more children results in a federal payment of 40 cents &mdash; up to a maximum of about $4,000 for workers earning $10,000 annually. </p>
<p>Workers earning between $10,000 and $12,500 do not receive any additional EITC. Above that, they enter the &ldquo;phase out&rdquo; range where the credit starts to diminish as the worker&rsquo;s income rises.</p>
<p>Thanks in part to IRS advertising and &ldquo;outreach&rdquo; efforts, EITC spending dwarfs that of TANF (conventional welfare) and food stamps combined. </p>

		<p>Anon14,</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
This is what made America Great. Immigrants that come to America legally have to take a test and they learn to assimilate. This is what the Melting Pot is about.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Sorry to be a bucket of cold water but we didn&rsquo;t exactly &#8216;integrate and assimilate&rsquo; with the Indian peoples who proceeded us here either and America is the #1 immigration destination because of it.  I wish people would stop using failed standards of idealism as an excuse for affinity preference because it&rsquo;s really just a cover for racial guilt.</p>
<p>Guilt you shouldn&rsquo;t have to feel because every ethnic population feels the same way, acts to benefit themselves the same and is rewarded for doing so.  It&rsquo;s natural, it&rsquo;s _competitive_, it&rsquo;s about conserving gene lines with the most potency of survival benefit.</p>
<p>I admire a man who chooses his own because they are his own and lets his selectivity extend further to those among his own he wants his children to associate with.</p>
<p>Having said that, in every lie there is a grain of truth.</p>
<p>And if only to shut up the liberalist egalitarians, we desperately need to start creating _real_ innovations in robotics that can do menial labor, for free.  Like the Japanese are doing.</p>
<p>I would, by far, rather have income by assignation (essentially corporate dole) be handed out to Americans who keep the public peace and control their total numbers as an incentive to continuing to do so, than be subject to an immigrant horde who work like slaves and breed like locusts.</p>
<p>To replace us.</p>
<p>Not least because the solution to the world&rsquo;s problems has ALWAYS been to export what we have, not import what they don&rsquo;t.  And robotics don&rsquo;t need to have smarter kids than the local gene pool can provide to jumpstart a modern society.  They can be dropped in without overrunning the existing system because they do not eat, breed or need special services themselves.</p>
<p>Thanks to the depredations of unions and the _permanent_ loss of industry overseas, we may never again see the wages that made the American Middle Class what it is.  But if you want to induct a new slave labor system, at least make sure it&rsquo;s not a sentient one.  And provide so that every 10,000 dollar a year flunky can use 4-6 robots to make another 20-30,000 as an &#8216;owner/operator&rsquo; who does truly great things to help our nation, even if he only subcontracts his/her limited skills to a corporate interest.  </p>
<p>And reward that person accordingly.</p>
<p>A return to a service driven, pro-white, economy should not mean relearning the Paul Bunyon myth all over again.</p>

<p>But at the same time gg, and with all due respect, an unrealistic optimism is characteristic of naive gullibility at best, or delusions of grandeur at worst.  Now maybe I am guilty of the despair you are talking about and am simply unaware of it or refuse to admit it, since I don&rsquo;t call noting the obvious as caving into despair  &mdash;   not when I&rsquo;ve become a front row witness to the spectacle of our national existence in free-fall.  I&rsquo;m talking here about America morphing into something despairingly unrecognizable.</p>
<p>Our failure to secure our borders and deal effectively with illegal immigration is only a symptom of a larger, more serious national disorder. That we have become a nation which embraces Open Borders in practice while giving lip service to &#8220;immigration reform&#8221; is a clear indicator that our ruling elites reject national existence and its corollary of patriotism as outdated obstacles to the Open Society and World State. </p>
<p>The Dream Act or what will amount to another grotesque Amnesty will be thrust on the American public. You can count on it, because we are no longer the &#8220;people&#8221; of a federated republic with defined borders around its citizenry but &#8220;subjects&#8221; of an Open Society or World State. </p>
<p>Historically, the terms of our national existence as a people has been defined and ordered by our experience within two mainstreams of thought and tradition: Jerusalem-Athens and the Enlightenment; faith and reason has governed both our founding and principles of self-understanding, and has provided the fraternal ties that bound us as a nation. </p>
<p>In the latter part of the twentieth century there has been an accelerated effort by the ruling elite to dismantle our national existence as obsolete and an obstacle to the realization of the Open Society or a &#8220;Rights&#8221; based, tolerant, non-discriminating society (Away with White-Anglo-Saxon-Protestantism!) that stands for &#8220;universal ideals.&#8221; </p>
<p>Now if you think this will be undone by Joe and Mamie Citizen, whose sole determining influence in life remains with the ballot box, think again. (Hint: The vote will be the very instrument of national unraveling and replacement). </p>
<p>The Open Society now upon us means a redirection away from &#8220;people&#8221; of a distinct nation to that of world citizens.  But if everybody in an Open Society is a potential citizen, then what is America if not the world?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll end here, lest I despair.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what happens when you break laws, you&rsquo;re a criminal. you knew what you were doing. Get out!</p>
<p>&#8220;She added that some families have told her they are only waiting to file their final tax return in order to leave at the beginning of next year.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Why would this be important when we&rsquo;re told that the illegals pay soooo much in taxes?</p>
<p>Because when they file their return they will get it all back in refunds plus extra, courtesy of the US Citizen taxpayer under IRS wealth redistribution rules.<br>
If they weren&rsquo;t they wouldn&rsquo;t bother.</p>

<p>What an ironic statement. Because of the huge chunk of millions of white American&rsquo;s paychecks confiscated to support these criminal invaders, and the drastically inflates cost of living, the American dream is over for me and millions of others too. Millions of whites literally cannot afford to get married, or have kids because of the huge tax burdens illegals create, the higher cost of living, increased crime, and schools that resemble war zones. And the Mexicans and hostile aliens in our government wonder why resentment is festering among the white population?! Go figure!</p>
