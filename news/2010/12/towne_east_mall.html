<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
<p>Mesquite police early Thursday used pepper spray to control an
unruly crowd of sneaker shoppers.</p>
<p>The incident happened at Towne East Mall, where dozens of people
had lined up top buy Nike&rsquo;s new Air Jordan 11 Retro, which went on
sale at 6 a.m.</p>
<p>Sisters Laurie and Lorraine Martinez, who said they had been in
line since 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, described the scene as frightening
and chaotic.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;At 4:30 the people at the back of line decided to bum rush
and run to the doors &hellip; As much as we tried to tell people to move,
they wouldn&rsquo;t. So [police] started macing,&#8221; Laurie Martinez
said.</p>
<p>She also said some people in the crowd were able to force open a
door to the shoe store and get inside, although the sisters were not
able to enter.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The sisters blame the mall and the store for the melee, calling
the event disorganized. They said customers should have received
numbers securing their places in line.</p>
<p>&#8220;So that this doesn&rsquo;t happen. And this store, they just let
everyone bum rush and act like crazy animals. And then everybody has
to pay,&#8221; Lauire Martinez said.</p>
<p>The women said despite the trouble, the sneakers sold out in a
half-hour.</p>
<p>A pair of Air Jordan 11 Retro sneakers retails for $175.</p>
<p><strong>MORE TROUBLE IN TEXAS</strong></p>
<p>The craze over the Air Jordan 11 Retro sneaker <a href="http://www.myfoxdfw.com/dpps/news/101223-shopping-crowd-chaos_11190859"><strong>also
caused problems at other Texas malls</strong> </a>.</p>
<p>Throngs of people flooded Houston-area malls and shopping centers
on Thursday morning, prompting police action.</p>
<p>Humble police said a fight broke out as some people were pushing
and shoving each other to get to the front of the line at Deerbrook
Mall.</p>

		<p>The vast majority of these footwear fanatics are on some form of government assistance, I have no doubt.  I guess 175 dollar cheaply made Chinese shoes along with cell phones, broadband internet and other such necessities are going to finally close that black/white achievement/employment/imprisonment gap. </p>

		<p>From what I can see of this crowd it looks to be about 90% or better black. This is why black credit scores are so low- I could probably get 3 pairs of decent dress shoes and at least 4 pairs of casual shoes for what they are paying for one pair of shoes. I have seen people in low income housing with expensive electronics, newer cars and other bling- it makes you wonder just where the money comes from. </p>

		<p>Michael Jordan is 47 years old, probably that many pounds overweight, the last time he won a championship, gas was under a buck a gallon in most places, and the WTC towers were still standing.  Yet, his shoes are STILL causing near riots among customers.  Shoes that, might I add, cost $175 in this the worst economy in our lifetimes.</p>

<p>How do you blame the store for their behavior? The store &#8220;let&#8221; them do it???  Every one of them chose to act like a lunatic as opposed to waiting their turn.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t understand it.  How damaged does your mind have to be in order to come to such a conclusion?  And how many people would agree with the thinking of Ms. Martinez?  It&rsquo;s unreal.<br>

<p>This is now the standard excuse everytime Blacks(and other imbecilles)descend upon some retail outlet on &#8220;Black Friday&#8221;(oh, the irony) or the like. Isn&rsquo;t it more reasonable to suggest that it is unruly, ill-behaved Blacks that are to blame? Of course, we must never tell the truth when Blacks are near.  </p>

		<p>A few years ago a local mall was selling some hotly anticipated Air Jordan shoe. Large crowds of blacks gathered before the shoe store opened. When they found out that the shoe store hadn&rsquo;t gotten a shipment of the new shoes the crowd actually rioted. They tore the store up.<br>
A pathetic action by a pathetic race.</p>

<p>What is this mania among our, um, &#8220;minorities&#8221; about shoes &hellip; particularly sneakers?  I&rsquo;m at a loss to understand it. In minority meighborhoods, it seems like nearly every other business is a shoe store   &mdash;   along with the liquor stores, fried chicken  places,  and store-front churches.</p>
<p>And what kind of fools would wait overnight, outside in the December cold, to buy some sheakers for $175? It boggles my mind. Probably half of them are on welfare.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, &#8220;A fool and his money are soon parted.&#8221;</p>
<p>And yes, as Eric said, they all have their cell phones, I-pods, and other electronic &#8220;bling&#8221;, without which they couldn&rsquo;t live. It used to be boom boxes, but now it&rsquo;s a whole array of fancy gadgets, which are now apparently necessities. </p>

<p>People that would &#8220;bum rush&#8221; a store in the first place, aren&rsquo;t the kind of people that would follow some sort of protocol (i.e. receiving a number that would secure their place in line).  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s akin to saying that the reason Black kids don&rsquo;t show up to school is because they don&rsquo;t have assigned seats.  They do, of course, but if they didn&rsquo;t, people of these girls&rsquo; ilk would be claiming that that was the solution.</p>

		<p>&#8220;They said customers should have received numbers securing their places in line.&#8221;  This may sound totally random, but I remember standing in line for tickets to a Rush concert in Reno, NV sometime in the mid nineties.  Needless to say, the people waiting to buy tickets were all white or close to it.  No need for passing out tickets, everyone knew who had been there before they arrived.  Around an hour before the tickets went on sale, everyone queued up in an orderly fashion and waited.  This was at a grocery store, no security involved, no shoving or tantrums, no one trying to cut in front of anyone else.  Some of us even helped out the local scalper by buying some extra tickets for him and no one got upset.</p>

		<p>I work in a place where there are some latino gangbangers.  I am not joking that they will spend HOURS on the internet looking at websites of hi-top shoes.  </p>
<p>I am not joking.  They love those things with abandon.  If you accidentally scuff their shoes, they look at you as if you hit their child, and then they bend down and feverishly try to clean them to pristine condition.</p>
<p>The inner city slang for such shoes is &#8216;my kicks.&rsquo;  I wonder what the origin of that term comes from!</p>

		<p>When I was a kid there was this black kid in my neighborhood that seemed to have a new pair of Air Jordans every week. I mean literally every week! At the time my parents were lucky to even afford one pair of shoes for me and we lived in a pretty poor part of town. Although this kid&rsquo;s mother did seem to work, I have seen countless times where supposedly &#8220;low income&#8221; blacks had enough material possesions that would make an upper middle class white person glee with envy. </p>
<p>This is the main reason why I do not like black Americans. The way I see it is that they are mainly spoiled children that have more than an adequate access to food, housing, employment and many other opprotunities in this nation. What generates most of my disdain for them is that they are too stupid to realize that how they have it made in this country while their brethren in places like Haiti and Africa are clinging to life while they are fat, plump and over indulged with consumerism while in the confines of safety in America. </p>
<p>The other day I was eating at KFC and this morbidly obese black man was sitting a couple of seats away from me. He was sitting with a friend at the family booth, which he took up half the space. The guy had to have wolfed down atleast eight pieces of chicken and this reminded me of how obesity rates among blacks is the highest in the country. While this guy was gorging on chicken, ten million people are starving in Haiti. I would wager that if asked this guy would claim that America is the most racist country in the world and his people are still suffering despite all the affirmative action programs and Obummer being elected. </p>
<p>There is no denying that the sense of entitlement is very high among blacks, but what has always baffled me is how much these people have in terms of material goods. Yes, I will not deny that there are very poor blacks who have little and also there are some who work hard for what they have, but the vast majority get stuff for nothing, and they enjoy it!. It is like a sickness and it is only going to get worse! The more white people, or producers in general, keep giving these people for nothing the more they are going to expect from white people. It is only going to worse! I expect to see whole portions of our major cities go up in smoke once welfare cuts begin to take place in the near future. </p>

		<p>When I was a kid, Towne East was a very nice mall in the middle of cotton fields, and near every store was closed in there on sundays in 1973. Apparently I wouldnt recognize the place now.</p>
<p>My current job is one of going into and searching the residences of &#8216;these&rsquo; people for a law enforcement agency. No matter how deplorable the living conditions, most every black male in the 15-35 age group has numerous pairs of these type of shoes, most carefully replaced in the shoe boxes, and worn as one may choose any other part of wardrobe. One pair for this outfit, one for this color, and don&rsquo;t dare you scuff or mark them up! I have seen fights erupt over someone scuffing anothers shoes. The only thing more amusing to me is their fetishistic fear of marking up their costume workboots! Timberland used to make a great work boot, now its just another cheap flashy trinket marketed to fools who have never worked a hard day in their lives. </p>
<p>These guys know the makes and models of shoes as car enthusiasts would know car marques!  They place an enormous value on their shoes, to the exclusion of mattresses, living conditions, anything but their clothes! More than one has confided in me their highest career aspiration; to be on the sales staff at footlocker&hellip;.and most will never get that far!</p>
<p>Common knowledge among us in the trenches is that if blacks can&rsquo;t eat, wear, drive or have sex with something, they have no interest in it. </p>

		<p>I agree with #1 -  it would be interesting to know what % of these $175 tennis shoe wearing thugs - oops - &#8220;youths&#8221; are on, or were raised on, welfare.<br>
To blame the mall and store for the &#8220;melee&#8221; is so typical of the ghetto mentality that permeates these people. I didn&rsquo;t hear of any shoe &#8220;melee&#8221; in Idaho, the Dakotas, Montana or Nebraska, I wonder why? I guess they must&rsquo;ve had &#8220;extra security&#8221;.<br>

<p>He said I know what happens but if these ghetto dwellers wear the stuff then America&rsquo;s young white population will Actually Pay with their fathers&rsquo; credit cards for a closet full of the stuff their heroes (the highly talented blacks) wear.</p>

		<p>Wow, this is totally out of the blue. I never would have guessed in a million years that a large crowd of Hispanics and blacks waiting around in a line for 15 hours could turn into a deadly stampede&hellip;not in a million years. </p>
<p>Actually, they could have ordered the sneakers from their iPhones for $110 less. </p>

Just one more illustration of their complete lack of priorities.<br>
Some things in life are important, some things are not. </p>
<p>People who will wait outside in the cold all night to buy a pair of sneakers are people who can&rsquo;t tell the difference.  They don&rsquo;t know what matters and what doesn&rsquo;t.  <br>

<p><i>When they found out that the shoe store hadn&rsquo;t gotten a shipment of the new shoes the crowd actually rioted. They tore the store up.</i></p>
<p>  &mdash;  Squadrista</p>
<p>Now, imagine when their entitlements dry up!  Who and what do you think they&rsquo;ll attack?</p>
<p>In minority neighborhoods, it seems like nearly every other business is a shoe store  &mdash;  along with the liquor stores, fried chicken places, and store-front churches.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget the bling!  Gold jewelry stores and check cashing businesses are also prevalent around black government housing.  In LA, bodegas run by Koreans are still standing strong (because the big supermarkets never returned after being looted and burned out in the 1965 melee   &mdash;   what does Madame Defarge call burned-out ghettoes?  Food deserts? Ha Ha!)   &mdash;   but you can bet those Korean grocers are armed with automatic weapons, ready for the coming riots.</p>
<p><i>If you accidentally scuff their shoes&hellip; they bend down and feverishly try to clean them to pristine condition.</i></p>
<p>  &mdash;  Jay</p>
<p>O, So True!  They bring entire shoe cleaning kits to school   &mdash;   with little spray bottles of cleaner and a complete set of brushes.  Same entitlement-minded rug rats that demand that you provide pencils, pens, paper for them each and every day.</p>
<p><i>They place an enormous value on their shoes, to the exclusion of mattresses, living conditions, anything but their clothes!</i></p>
<p>A White WIC employee told me Section 8 blacks come into the WIC office wearing $175 sneakers and covered with gold jewelry but their kids and babies are filthy, disheveled  and unkempt.</p>
<p>What always gets me with blacks and hispanics is that they believe we Whites are the ones who throw around our money gratuitously, indiscriminately and with abandoned   &mdash;   eating out, buying expensive cars, watches, clothing and jewelry.</p>
<p>I am asked almost every Monday by the non-Whites where I work which restaurants I ate at over the weekend.  Let&rsquo;s see, that would be Chez Bon on Friday, Saturday and Sunday because I find most restaurant food overpriced and mediocre at best (not to mention the kitchens are run by mexicans and central americans   &mdash;   brain worm anyone?)  Then, these same non-Whites will regale me with tales of the expensive restaurants they patronized on Friday, Saturday and Sunday night and show off the expensive electronic gadgetry and clothing they purchased   &mdash;   iPads, the latest 4G cell phones, pricey purses and shoes.  Yeah, like I&rsquo;m sooo impressed&hellip;</p>
<p>You see, blacks and hispanics <i>are not capable</i> of planning for the future or controlling their impulses when the latest toys, cars, shoes and clothing are dangled in front of their faces, it&rsquo;s all about posing and <i>stylin</i> in the latest fashions in the <i>here and now.</i></p>
<p>The future?  They&rsquo;ll take whatever they want or need from Whites because they believe all White wealth and property belongs to them.</p>
<p>And, the government believes this too.</p>

		<p>It is rather difficult to get all weepy-eyed over &#8220;poverty&#8221; when it shuffles past you in $175 sneakers. </p>

		<p>Hmmm, $175 for some Air Jordans. I pay that for really sturdy high end work boots, but not for sneakers or dress shoes. But then again, you don&rsquo;t expect to get maced at the Red Wing store. Anytime a new guy hires on, I make it a point to tell him to get really good shoes, not the knock offs at &#8220;Big Box Mart&#8221;. </p>
<p>I refuse to participate in this &#8220;Black Friday&#8221; or similar types of sales. Not a good use of your time. </p>
<p>Years ago, I had a part time night job at a video store. One of the things that I noticed was that the only people who tend to buy really high end clothes for young children are either people who are fairly wealthy (a few whites) or those on welfare (virtually all black). Recently, I found some really nice Skechers for my son at a resale shop, but they were about $6.00, not the $60.00 (or more) retail price. </p>

&#8220;To blame the mall and store for the &ldquo;melee&rdquo; is so typical of the ghetto mentality that permeates these people. I didn&rsquo;t hear of any shoe &ldquo;melee&rdquo; in Idaho, the Dakotas, Montana or Nebraska, I wonder why? I guess they must&rsquo;ve had &ldquo;extra security&rdquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes Tom, the same thing with the virtually all white mall near me. Nobody breaking down the doors for the new &#8220;kicks&#8221;. I wonder why; it is the Mall&rsquo;s fault that these things happen. </p>

		<p>Hi, Bon  &mdash;  laughing at your comment (#23) about the shoe-cleaning kits these sneaker addicts bring to school. Our school nurse had to explain to a lot of students that hand sanitizer did not clean sneaker scuff marks. It was for getting rid of germs.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;What always gets me with blacks and hispanics is that they believe we Whites are the ones who throw  money around gratuitously, indiscriminately and with abandon  &mdash;  eating out, buying expensive cars, watches, clothing and jewelry.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am asked almost every Monday by the non-Whites where I work which restaurants I ate at over the weekend. Let&rsquo;s see, that would be Chez Bon &hellip;.<br>
Then, these same non-Whites will regale me with tales of the expensive restaurants they patronized on Friday, Saturday and Sunday night and show off the expensive electronic gadgetry and clothing they purchased.&#8221;<br>
   &mdash;   BON</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>That is so true. That rings a familiar bell. </p>
<p>And those  expensive meals and purchases were probably bought on credit, paid for with credit cards.  </p>
<p>Those same people where I work always send out for their lunch, always  - and  they pay to have it delivered too, even if it&rsquo;s  just from across the street where they could pick it up themselves.   I bring my own and rarely eat out.  Then, when I take a vacation or some such thing,  they wonder where I got the money.  I&rsquo;ve been told, &#8220;I sure wish I had your kind of money!  You must be blessed.&#8221; They must think I have inherited money.  No, I&rsquo;m not blessed, I&rsquo;m just sensible.  I don&rsquo;t spend more than I can afford. And I don&rsquo;t carry any debt.</p>
<p>One of them will order the most expensive sandwich  from a fancy restaurant and then brag about how much he paid for it -  as if that&rsquo;s some  sort of an <i>accomplishment.</i>  He makes sure to let everyone know!  I bring my own sandwich from home, for nothing.   He will get a super-expensive haircut in some trendy salon and then brag about  how much he paid for that.   I&rsquo;d be too ashamed to admit I was such a fool.   I would consider anybody who spends a small fortune  on a haircut to be an idiot (unless he&rsquo;s a millionaire and can afford to throw money away).   But by the end of the pay period, this guy is always broke and looking to borrow some money.  Then he envies you for having money.  How come you&rsquo;re not broke too?   It must be that &#8220;White Privildge&#8221;, you know!  Every white has a secret money tree hidden somewhere. </p>
<p>When wide-screen flat TVs came out,  costing several thousand, he just HAD to have one. Had to have it RIGHT AWAY!  He borrowed $100. from me   &mdash;   and probably more hundreds from other people.   (I let him have the hundred as the price of staying on good terms.)  He doesn&rsquo;t comprehend  that you SAVE up your money and THEN buy what you want when you can pay for it, without having to mooch from others.  </p>
<p>And the women are all decked out in the latest fashions, constantly showing off new outfits - but all living in debt.  Their kids are probably all wearing the latest, priciest sneakers too.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just no sense of providing for tomorrow. Everything is today, right now.  There&rsquo;s no idea of deferred satisfaction.</p>
<p>When my employer came out with a generous profit-sharing plan, where they matched  a dollar for every dollar you put in, that was a terrific deal. They were simply GIVING AWAY MONEY! The only hitch was that you couldn&rsquo;t cash it in for five years. NONE of the blacks took advantage of the opportunity. They all said they needed their money right now. They all have heaps of bills to pay, and they&rsquo;re all broke, although they make just as much money as I do. (They don&rsquo;t believe that.)</p>
<p>As Karl Ketzer said above,  just about the only people who buy really high-end clothes are people  (whites) who are really wealthy enough to afford it, or else welfare people  (blacks)  who are pretending to be [wealthy enough to afford it].<br>
Middle class whites save their money and use it for sensible things, not bling. Blacks can&rsquo;t understand that.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The sisters blame the mall and the store for the melee, calling the event disorganized. They said customers should have received numbers securing their places in line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that this doesn&rsquo;t happen. And this store, they just let everyone bum rush and act like crazy animals. And then everybody has to pay,&rdquo; Lauire Martinez said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Disorganized?&#8221; I see&hellip;so it&rsquo;s the store&rsquo;s fault you people cannot behave like civilized human beings! This is the mentality of the typical minority on this country. Blame the establishment for your failures and inability to act like a cultured member of society.</p>
