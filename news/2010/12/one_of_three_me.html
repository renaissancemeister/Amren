<h1>One of Three Men Pleads Guilty to Sexually Assaulting 6-Year-Old Victim</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dan Parsons, Daily Press (Newport News, Virginia), November 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The oldest of three suspects accused of sexually assaulting a 6-year-old girl in their care faces 20 years behind bars after pleading guilty Monday to one felony charge related to the crimes.</p>
<p>Tito Ubaldo Guirao-Aguilar, 39, was convicted in Williamsburg-James City County Circuit Court of a single count of aggravated sexual battery. Prosecutors dropped two counts of attempted forcible sodomy and one attempted rape charge as part of the plea agreement.</p>
<p>The plea was negotiated to &#8220;save a 6-year-old child the trauma of testifying in court,&#8221; Assistant Commonwealth&rsquo;s Attorney Sandy Conyers told the court.</p>
<p>Guirao-Aguilar faces a maximum 20 years in prison and a $100,000 fine when sentenced Feb. 23.</p>
<p>Guirao-Aguilar, who does not speak English, entered his plea through a translator. Dressed in an orange jumpsuit and shackled at the ankles, he said little during the hearing, answering questions with one-word responses.</p>
<p>During questioning from Circuit Court Judge Samuel Powell, Guirao-Aguilar admitted he was not a citizen of the United States and that he had only a ninth-grade education.</p>
<p>Samuel Eli Jacobo-Guirao, 19, and Daniel Elios Jacobo-Guirao, 17, both of whom are related to Guirao-Aguilar, also are charged in the assaults. Daniel Jacobo-Guirao is being tried as an adult. Samuel Jacobo-Guirao has requested a mental evaluation.</p>
<p>The three men lived in a Merrimac Trail apartment with the 6-year-old victim, who police believe was repeatedly sexually assaulted.</p>

		<p>We all know blacks abuse drugs too much and rape too much. But a certain sector of Hispanics seems to be impelled to rape young children of both sexes and to drink to an extent that crack cocaine might seem to be a mild sedative. And then our latin friends are impelled not just to pass out on the sidewalk or the gutter, where we can simply step over them, in the best live and let live American tradition, but they must enter a car, turn the ignition, and drive into traffic with a blood alchohol level in excess of .20.  They must.  It is a civil right. And we have an obligation to die if our car is near their car. And they must be released. Because they are deprived, seeking work, and the kind of people we need in America because &#8220;Americans&#8221; won&rsquo;t do the jobs that &#8220;undocumented&#8221; residents will do.</p>
<p>No party will stop this travesty.</p>

		<p>WHEN are people going to realize that in Mexico, Latin America, and Africa this is COMMON behavior?  In their third world mentality having sex with children is what they do at home, so why is it a big deal here in the US?  Didn&rsquo;t anybody ever wonder why it is that from time to time we hear of 10 year olds in Mexico becoming pregnant, before we so foolishly invited &#8220;diversity&#8221; into OUR country and culture????  Did we think these people would leave their third world culture and mentality at home, and suddenly become European Americans just by crossing the border?  Well no, &#8220;we&#8221; didn&rsquo;t at least those who keep encouraging this kind of blight on America, didn&rsquo;t.  All they care about is that they are in-the-pocket votes for Dems and liberal agendas.  Who cares if the country is destroyed and becomes Zimbabwe or Tijuana as long as the Dems can seize and hold power, eh?  In their view, better to be King in Zimbabwe than to be a citizen in a Constitutional Republic.  As long as THEY are the kings and princes, of course.</p>

		<p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement recently was renamed Homeland Security Investigations.  The leadership of ICE could not stand Immigration being the first word of their agency - since ICE was predominantly taken over by former Customs officials.  The current administration has a fanatical dedication to amnesty and radical non-white immigration.  Enforcement of immigration laws has been scaled way back since Obama has taken office.  By the way, did you hear about who was convicted of killing Chandra Levy?  No, it was not Congressman Gary Condit, it was an illegal alien MS-13 member from El Salvador.  The media has not reported widely on his illegal status.  Welcome to the future white folks.</p>

		<p>In Mandela&rsquo;s new South Africa, the last week saw the brutal killing of a white family in Lindley in the Orange Free State.</p>
<p>The wife was raped and hacked to pieces with a machete, the husband was hacked to pieces with a machete, the three year old baby girl was raped and shot execution style in the back of the head. The perpetrators: Six blacks. . And they have the fine cheek to call themselves &#8220;civilized&#8221; and &#8220;christian&#8221;. Go to www.boerboel1.wordpress.com for details.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that there is an acceptable level of rape. Should we make a special rape control based on the gun control law limiting each Black male to only one rape per month? <br>

		<p>But of course! I can remember several years ago checking the CRIMESTOPPER Ten Most Wanted List. 7 Latinos, 3 Blacks and one possibly White. I also recall that a goodly number of the perps turning up locally charged with rape or sexual misconduct with children   &mdash;   you guessed it! Latinos!</p>

<p>eduard,<br>
I went to that site but couldn&rsquo;t find it. Maybe it&rsquo;s just as well. I&rsquo;d only work myself into a bigger rage than the one from which I&rsquo;m already suffering.<br>
The lead article on the site made sense. Why would a minority of people be foolish enough to think that they could control a savage majority for whom rape, mutilation and murder are part of their culture. They should have opted for a homeland in the first place.</p>
