<h1>Study: Grad Rates Between Blacks, Whites Widening</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Antonio Gonzalez, Charlotte Observer, December 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The disparity between graduation rates for white and black players at schools headed to bowl games grew again this year even as overall academic progress increased for both, a study released Monday found.</p>
<p>The annual report by the University of Central Florida&rsquo;s Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport found that the graduation success rate is increasing at a higher rate for white players than black players.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The graduation success rate for black players went from 58 percent to 60 percent this year among the 70 bowl teams. But for white players, the graduation rates increased from 77 percent last year to 80 percent this year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Five schools had graduation success rates for black players that exceeded their rates for white players: Northwestern (one percent higher), Virginia Tech (3 percent higher), Southern Mississippi (three percent higher), Notre Dame (four percent higher) and Troy (10 percent higher). {snip}</p>
<p>Notre Dame and Northwestern were the only schools that graduated 95 percent of their players and at least 95 percent of their black players. Air Force and Northwestern had the highest academic progress rate with scores of 988 and 986, respectively.</p>
<p>Texas Tech was the lone school that had overall graduation success rates for football players that were better than the overall athletes. And Oklahoma was the only school that graduated less than 50 percent of its white players.<br>

		<p>I wonder whether this may be due to the increasing amount of miscegenation between blacks and whites?</p>
<p>Since black genes are dominant and white ones recessive, the injection of white genes for intelligence into the black genetic pool may lead to no discernible increase in black intelligence.</p>
<p>And, if the majority of whites who are interbreeding with blacks have IQs below the white average (which is approximately 100), this would remove them and their offspring from the white genetic pool, causing a rise in the average IQ of whites. I could thus see miscegenation actually causing a rise in interracial disparity.</p>

		<p> Strange, isn&rsquo;t it, how it never occurs to these people to be &#8220;disturbed&#8221; at the hugely disproportionate number of blacks who get the high-profile, NBA- or NFL-bound starting positions on all these teams, and how many White athletes have to languish on the bench and don&rsquo;t stand a chance at making the big money?</p>
<p> But then, in American sports, 2010 version, if blacks or, to a lesser degree, Hispanics, fail, it&rsquo;s due to &#8220;White racism&#8221; or &#8220;xenophobia.&#8221; If Whites fail, they either had no talent, or they didn&rsquo;t try hard enough. The &#8220;double standard&#8221; is alive and well, all right; it&rsquo;s applied negatively to White athletes every day.</p>

		<p>We get this same story every early-to-mid December (corresponding with the college football bowl elections) and every mid-March (corresponding with the college basketball tournament selections.)  Although as of late, they&rsquo;re talking less and less about the overall low graduation rate and playing up the racial differences therein.  </p>
<p>But my reaction is still the same   &mdash;   Find that in the following links.</p>

		<p>IMHO all that racket is a disgrace to the very idea of university sports. Were I a university I´d rather lose every game to Greater Cuckamonga Elementary than have some semiliterate wear my shirt.<br>
But then, I´m a bit guilty of Old European standards.</p>

		<p>These stats are absolutely meaningless due to AA affecting all blacks by advancing them whether or not they learn the work they&rsquo;re supposed to.</p>
<p>If blacks were required to pass a high school GED in order to get a degree, I&rsquo;m pretty sure the pass rate would be dismally low.</p>

		<p>To Uniculturalist.<br>
Where do you take the idea that &#8220;black genes are dominant, and white genes are recessive&#8221;, meaning by black genes all the genes of a black, not only the genes related to colour of the skin ? </p>

Around the world, the average IQ for East Asians centers around 106; for Whites, about 100; and for Blacks about 85 in the U.S. and 70 in sub-Saharan Africa. <br>

		<p>Back in the 1960s in Newark NJ blacks complained that they were &#8216;disproportionately&rsquo; flunking out of high school. They protested, claiming that the high school diploma was needed in order to get good paying jobs, so it was the usual &#8216;discrimination/racism&rsquo; etc.</p>
<p>Well the city caved in, started handing out diplomas to anyone who simply attended school, whether or not they could pass a test. And the result was that the high school diploma became worthless and employers had to require a few semesters of college in order to weed out the idiots. So then whites had to go to college just to get a &#8216;working class&rsquo; job that previously only required a high school education.</p>
<p>I have little doubt that many of these schools are lowering standards just to make the graduation rate numbers look good.</p>
<p>But most people are wise to this. When I finished Rutgers someone told me &#8220;thats a tough school to get into, if you&rsquo;re white&#8221;&hellip;</p>

		<p>Of tangential relevance, at least, to this topic are the facts<br>
regarding performances of,  and social-judgements concerning the <br>
abilities of, African students at the Soviet era Patrice Lumba University in Moscow.  I have seen references to this topic but am unaware yet of whether a thorough review of the matter has emerged.  There was, inevitably, a lot of Jesenism &#8220;whispering&#8221;<br>
going on among faculty and Russian students about this matter notwithstanding the official Soviet ideology and its  repressive regime.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strange, isn&rsquo;t it, how it never occurs to these people to be &#8216;disturbed&rsquo; at the hugely disproportionate number of blacks who get the high-profile, NBA- or NFL-bound starting positions&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Quoting &#8220;Race and Baseball: Who is really &lsquo;black&rsquo;?&#8221; by Dennis Watkins, American Renaissance, Vol. 21, No. 11 November 2010: </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sports (TIDES), which issues a yearly &#8216;Racial and Gender Report Card.&rsquo; &hellip; pores over front-office hiring practices as well as the race of players, and helpfully suggests hiring goals.&#8221;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&#8220;TIDES doesn&rsquo;t care at all about white people &hellip; In 2009, therefore, when the National Basketball Association (NBA) was 77 percent black and 18 percent white, it got an A+. These figures meant that, on average, a black was about 23 times more likely than a white to be a professional basketball player but that&rsquo;s fine with TIDES. The National Football League, which is 67 percent black and 31 percent white, also got an A+, as did the Women&rsquo;s National Basketball Association, which is also 67 percent black, but 20 percent white, and 12 percent international.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;TIDES might not insist that every single player in the NBA be black, but by its formula the score for diversity would not go down one bit if it were. This is typical &#8216;diversity&rsquo; thinking. A 100-percent-black NBA would have no diversity at all, but TIDES would still give it an A+, maybe even an A++. As is so often the case, &#8216;diversity&rsquo; is just an excuse to push out whitey.&#8221;  </p>

<p>Actually it does lead to MORE than a &#8220;discernible increase in black intelligence.&#8221;  Blacks in America as a group have been shown to have signficantly greater amounts of European DNA in their gene pools than blacks from sub-Saharan Africa.  Psychometricians have noted the results.</p>
<p>http://www.news-medical.net/news/2005/04/26/9530.aspx</p>
<p>&#8220;1.The Worldwide Pattern of IQ Scores. East Asians average higher on IQ tests than Whites, both in the U. S. and in Asia, even though IQ tests were developed for use in the Euro-American culture. Around the world, the average IQ for East Asians centers around 106; for Whites, about 100; and for Blacks about 85 in the U.S. and 70 in sub-Saharan Africa.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks to John Engelman for the link, by the way.</p>
<p>Uniculturalist, no offense, but your understanding of human genetics sounds like it&rsquo;s on the secondary school level.  You need to learn about phenomena in the science like &#8220;incomplete dominance&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="http://biology.about.com/od/geneticsglossary/g/incompletedom.htm" rel="nofollow">http://biology.about.com/od/geneticsglossary/g/incompletedom.htm</a></p>
<p>When a pure-blooded African black marries a White, the child is much darker than the White parent but usually noticeably lighter than the black one.</p>
<p>Two tragic examples:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.drrobertsgordon.com/istock/iStock_000003233654Multi-racial%20happy%20family.jpg?nxg_versionuid=published" rel="nofollow">http://www.drrobertsgordon.com/istock/iStock_000003233654Multi-racial%20happy%20family.jpg?nxg_versionuid=published</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.pasadenaweekly.com/site_images_upload/legacy/media/10/feature.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.pasadenaweekly.com/site_images_upload/legacy/media/10/feature.jpg</a></p>
<p>This phenomenon of &#8220;blending&#8221; (on the phenotypic level) occurs for a number of traits, including intelligence.  Thus, it should be no surprise American blacks, on avg., outscore their &#8220;African brothers&#8221; on IQ tests.</p>
<p>The bottom line is this: miscegenation benefits the low-IQ race (in terms of intelligence, anyway) but is a detriment to the high-IQ one.  We need to find a way to get these people out of our midsts!</p>
