<h1>Fewer African-Americans Are Observing Kwanzaa  &mdash;  Why?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jenice Armstrong, Philadelphia Daily News, December 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>I asked a 17-year-old I know what he thought about Kwanzaa and he said, &#8220;That Jewish holiday?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Clearly, his high school hasn&rsquo;t embraced the multicultural thing and isn&rsquo;t teaching students about the 44-year-old Afrocentric holiday. But I don&rsquo;t knock his ignorance because the truth is that Kwanzaa has never caught on with the majority of black Americans. At the same time, though, it has grown in mainstream acceptance as evidenced by the Kwanzaa postal stamps and greeting cards.</p>
<p>{snip} Keith Mayes, author of &#8220;Black Power and the Making of the African-American Holiday Tradition&#8221; (Routledge, 2009) said that conservative estimates are that between 1 million to 2 million African Americans celebrate Kwanzaa. Organizers of The African American Cultural Center in Los Angeles put the figure at 40 million worldwide but that includes similar festivals in Africa and elsewhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t know if the numbers continue to increase every year. I would say that it may have leveled off,&#8221; Mayes said. &#8220;It just no longer shows up in some of the places that it did 30 to 40 years ago. You still have people who actually celebrate it. You have third generations of Kwanzaa celebrants .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but Kwanzaa no longer has its movement which brought it forth, which is the black power movement. That movement has waned.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the same time, though, many cultural institutions such as the African American Museum in Philadelphia, which is planning a number of celebrations at the Gallery at Market East, have embraced it. For mainstream organizations, Kwanzaa has become a stand-in for African-American traditions and it has become almost obligatory to lump Kwanzaa in with Hanukkah, Christmas, Three Kings&rsquo; Day and other December holidays. {snip}<br>
{snip}<br>
Most black families don&rsquo;t hold personal Kwanzaa observances, which typically involve the lighting of a candle every day from Dec. 26 to Jan. 1, representing the seven principles of the festival. On Friday, when I asked folks on Facebook why more African-Americans haven&rsquo;t embraced the holiday, I got some heated answers. Some respondents said people were ignorant about what it is and how to celebrate it, and others felt that Kwanzaa was just another manufactured holiday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me you have to care about blackness above and beyond the everyday to celebrate Kwanzaa, and while there are plenty of conscious black people who do so, of all socioeconomic strata, I don&rsquo;t see it taking off .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. because in order to have the black masses participate in large, noisy numbers, Kwanzaa would have to be simplified and made easy and consumer-friendly, and would then presumably lack the educational aspect of the holiday,&#8221; pointed out Bertram D. Ashe, an associate professor of English and American studies at the University of Richmond. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t see that happening. That&rsquo;s simply not the way it was designed when Ron Karenga founded the ritual in the mid-1960s, and I don&rsquo;t see that changing anytime soon, nor should it.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} But as a Facebook friend pointed out, no matter how well-intentioned, an individual can&rsquo;t declare Kwanzaa a black holiday and expect the masses to adopt it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It appealed to a generation of people who are now in their 50s and 60s,&#8221; said Charles A. Gallagher, a professor of sociology at La Salle University. &#8220;It doesn&rsquo;t resonate in many ways with a lot of young people today. It&rsquo;s the same argument that you hear with the NAACP. For me, they are still sacrosanct. But you hear a lot of young people saying the NAACP is irrelevant.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And then there are those such as John Childress, New Jersey-based father of two teenagers, who has taken his children to a couple of Kwanzaa celebrations but still can&rsquo;t get past the Kwanzaa founder&rsquo;s 1971 conviction for torture.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not indicative of Kwanzaa &#8220;growing in mainstream acceptance,&#8221; that&rsquo;s just white liberals shoving it down our throats.</p>
<p>I have noticed that Kwanzaa was A Big Deal for a few years in the 1990s, but quickly fell off the map and is practically nothing now.  And it has been nothing for the last few years.  A few years ago, when I asked some really smart people to posit theories on why, the most frequent theory had to do with most blacks being nominally Christian.  However, Kwanzaa is a racial celebration, not a religious one, so there one can celebrate both Kwanzaa and Christmas at the same time.</p>
<p>But I think I might know the reason why Kwanzaa is only a marginal phenomenon among blacks these days.  In the last few years, I&rsquo;ve been paying close attention to black rhetoric, both interpersonally and online, and not just about Kwanzaa.  I think the reason why Kwanzaa is now just a fringe thing among blacks is because only fringe elements of the black body politic are celebrating Kwanzaa, for political reasons indicative of political extremism, even by black standards, which are pretty kooky to begin with.  From what I gather, among those who celebrate it, Kwanzaa has something to do with firing all white police officers, assassinating all white police officers, and eliminating any pretense of effective law enforcement on black criminal suspects in general.  Apropos that a black convicted felon in prison invented Kwanzaa out of thin air, so it&rsquo;s all just a matter of things coming full circle.</p>
<p>Another reason is more practical   &mdash;   I have read and heard a few blacks upset that when they started celebrating Kwanzaa, that it meant eight days worth of gifts and presents instead of just one.  When it didn&rsquo;t work out that way, then they had no use for Kwanzaa.  IOW, their usual selfish, materialist interests.</p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Mainstream acceptance: That means, in translation, the fawning and groveling of American whites in their attempt to flatter and appease blacks over a phony &#8220;African&#8221; holiday that even the majority of blacks don&rsquo;t bother with or recognize.</p>
<p>Typical of whites!  When will we recover our own pride and stop the groveling?</p>

		<p>Kwanzaa was and is being pushed forward relentlessly by the diversity crowd, the secularists, and the &#8220;war on Christianity&#8221; brigade.<br>
  It never &#8220;took&#8221; because Blacks didn&rsquo;t want it and didn&rsquo;t need it. The vast majority of American Blacks are quite content with fundamentalist Protestantism mixed in with a bit of juju, and the few who are intrigued with their &#8220;African roots&#8221; certainly don&rsquo;t want to reconnect to harvest festivals in jungle clearings; no, their motherland is the never-never land of pyramids,&#8221;boss black civilizations, the scholars of Timbuctu, Imhotep and Hatshepsut.<br>
  And, above and beyond all, Kwanzaa is complicated and expensive.    </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been saying this for years, even predicting that the whole thing might just pass into the historical dustbin completely before the next decade is out. </p>
<p>I sincerely doubt too, that any 1-2 million Blacks celebrate this goofy Neo-Marxist &#8220;holiday&#8221; even now. I watched the TV news Kwanzaa coverage last year on the New York City channels, and apparently even in NYC - Divesrity/Multicult central - they could only find ONE small group at some cultural-center who celebrate this thing, as EVERY major network featured precisely the SAME exact group/location! How ridiculous is that?!</p>
<p>Let us all rejoice - another spectacular failure for multiculturalism! When even the Blacks toward whom this silliness is geared couldn&rsquo;t care less, it seems pretty clear that this is one holiday destined for utter obscurity&hellip;and probably sooner rather than later! </p>

		<p>The founder of Kwanzaa, Ron Karenga, says on the official Kwanzaa website, that Kwanzaa &#8220;&hellip;reflects the best of African thought and practice in its reaffirmation of the dignity of the human person in community and culture,..&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.officialkwanzaawebsite.org/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">https://www.officialkwanzaawebsite.org/index.shtml</a></p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a look at Mr. Karenga&rsquo;s own &#8220;practice in reaffirmation of the dignity of the human person in community and culture,&#8221; as summarized in this short Dartmouth Review article:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ron Karenga&hellip;continued to build and strengthen the US (United Slaves Organization). Members of the (United Slaves Organization) followed the &#8216;Path of Blackness&rsquo; detailed in The Quotable Karenga, authored by Karenga himself. &#8216;The sevenfold path of blackness is think black, talk black, act black, create black, buy black, vote black, and live black,&rsquo; the book states.</p>
<p>The US would not last too much longer. On September 17, 1971, Karenga was sentenced to one to ten years in prison on counts of felonious assault and false imprisonment. The charges stemmed from a May 9, 1970 incident in which Karenga and two others tortured two women who Karenga believed had tried to kill him by placing &#8216;crystals&rsquo; in his food and water.</p>
<p>A year later the Los Angeles Times described the events: &#8216;Deborah Jones, who once was given the title of an African queen, said she and Gail Davis were whipped with an electrical cord and beaten with a karate baton after being ordered to remove their clothes. She testified that a hot soldering iron was placed in Miss Davis&rsquo; mouth and placed against Miss Davis&rsquo; face and that one of her own big toes was tightened in a vice. Karenga, head of US, also put detergent and running hoses in their mouths, she said.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The shooting at UCLA caused Karenga to become deeply paranoid and spurred his bizarre behavior. At his trial, the question of Karenga&rsquo;s sanity arose. The psychiatrist&rsquo;s report stated, &#8216;This man now represents a picture which can be considered both paranoid and schizophrenic with hallucinations and elusions, inappropriate affect, disorganization, and impaired contact with the environment.&rsquo; The psychiatrist observed that Karenga talked to his blanket and imaginary persons and believed that he had been attacked by dive-bombers.</p>
<p>Eight years later California State University at Long Beach made Karenga the head of its Black Studies Department. Karenga had toned down his rhetoric and abandoned his cultural nationalism for straightforward Marxism.&#8221;</p>

		<p>There are more liberal whites who think blacks really celebrate Kwanzaa than blacks who actually celebrate it.  My children have no black classmates but are taught the &#8220;holiday&#8221; in school along with Christmas and Hanukkah.  Also, the &#8220;conservative&#8221; estimate that 1-2 million blacks celebrate Kwanzaa is entirely overstated.  How many of these goofy Kwanzaa candle sticks have actually been sold since this abomination was dreamed up?  A couple hundred thousand, at best, over the last 40-45 years?  How many Kwanzaa stamps have been sold? It is likely that many of these stamps were purchased by white liberals so that they could show their white liberal friends how fashionable they are.  </p>

		<p>Maybe blacks don&rsquo;t celebrate &#8220;Kwanzaa&#8221; because they&rsquo;re embarrassed about a &#8220;harvest festival&#8221; in December; or maybe it&rsquo;s because the so-called founder of the festival is an ex-con jailed for rape and setting a woman on fire; or maybe the brothers just don&rsquo;t need some silly excuse for stocking up on the 40 oz. malt liquors and pickled pig&rsquo;s feet  &mdash;  they&rsquo;re gonna do it anyway. </p>
<p>As a Christian, I&rsquo;m offended that the nonsense of &#8220;Kwanzaa&#8221; is put on the same pedestal as Christmas and Hannakuh. Christmas is a beautiful time of year, and although Hannukah may be an minor Jewish holiday, they&rsquo;re both religiously based and go back millenia. Kwanzaa is a joke. </p>

Yes, Kwanzaa is too complicated.</p>
<p>Both Christmas and Thanksgiving are easy. There are no unpronounceable principles to memorize and be tested on later.</p>
<p>And then you have to do something special for 7 days. It&rsquo;s just too much work and effort.</p>

		<p>The worst thing about the piece is the author&rsquo;s advocacy.  She clearly is &#8220;concerned&#8221; about the lack of popularity of Kwanzaa.  In other words, schools should do a better job of promoting Afrocentrism with tax dollars   &mdash;   as if they haven&rsquo;t done enough already.  </p>

		<p>The fundamental flaw of Kwanzaa is the lack of geographical knowledge on the part of the African American college professors in California who invented it.</p>
<p>This holiday is supposed to be celebratory of harvest season. Unfortunately, in SubSaharan Africa, which is below the equator, December would be prepartory to the planting season. Seeing the number of ridiculous television appeals for starving African children, I&rsquo;m inclined to perceive that planting anything, other than one&rsquo;s arse on the ground or one&rsquo;s seed in an available female, is a rare event indeed.</p>

<p><br>
And Jay got it right   &mdash;    especialy on that last point. I hadn&rsquo;t tnought of that.  You would need a real family that does things together. How many blacks quality?  </p>
<p>Instead, DeJuwan is out on the street somewhere with his homies doing whatever they do, and Latrice is off with her pals doing the same. Momma is in the bedroom snortin&rsquo; crack with her new man, whilst DeJuwan and Latrice&rsquo;s fathers are both in prison upstate. Grandma is trying to hold the family together as best she can, but she be a little drunk today. Oh, Lordy! It&rsquo;s everyone out for himself. </p>
<p>A whole week of celebrations?  Forget it! They can&rsquo;t all get together for lunch. They&rsquo;re not a family, they&rsquo;re just a collection of individuals.</p>
<p>In other words, in order to correct the problems of black pathology, you first have to correct the problems of black pathology. That&rsquo;s quite a package to fill.</p>

		<p>But of course, just because not many blacks actually do Kwaanza, doesn&rsquo;t mean there won&rsquo;t be many more blacks who will feel terribly slighted if Kwaanza isn&rsquo;t given equal billing with Christmas.</p>
<p>Well, in one way that&rsquo;s not too far from my feelings about Christianity&hellip;I&rsquo;m not religious at all, but I don&rsquo;t like to see Christianity slighted, since that feels to me like a slight to my people. Ah well, that&rsquo;s a complicated subject&hellip;and while we&rsquo;re on it, Merry Christmas to everyone!</p>
