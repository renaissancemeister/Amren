<h1>Groves Says US Population Data to Show Hispanics Expanding</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bloomberg News, Dec. 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
<p><font color="#000000"><span style="text-decoration: none;"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% transparent;">The
ethnic makeup of the world&rsquo;s largest economy will be increasingly
diverse, with more mixed- race Americans, according to the head of
the U.S. Census Bureau.</span></span></font></p>
<p>&#8220;This is the decade of Tiger Woods and Barack Obama, where we
talked about race combinations,&#8221; Robert Groves, director of the
federal agency, said about forthcoming 2010 Census data in an
interview on Bloomberg Television&rsquo;s &#8220;Political Capital with Al
Hunt,&#8221; airing this weekend. &#8220;I can&rsquo;t wait to see the
pattern of responses on multiple races. That&rsquo;ll be a neat indicator
to watch.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 2010 Census was the second consecutive decennial count to
allow residents to identify as more than one race, and Groves said
it&rsquo;s likely that more respondents checked off multiple races.</p>
<p>The nation&rsquo;s population grew 9.7 percent to 308,745,538 in 2010,
from the previous decade, with the fastest gains coming in the South
and West, the agency said this week. The release included only U.S.
and state population figures, with more data on race, ethnicity,
housing and other variables provided in February and March for all
levels of geography.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The overall growth, driven by an increase in Hispanic residents,
was the weakest in seven decades as the worst recession since the
Great Depression stunted immigration. The latest U.S. population
count shows the nation&rsquo;s demographic center of gravity continued to
shift, advancing a decades-old movement of people and political clout
away from the Northeast and Midwest.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When Obama was born in 1961, more than half the nation   &mdash;   54
percent   &mdash;   lived in the Midwest and Northeast. Now, midway through
his first term, 39 percent live there, the census data show.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The U.S. has the lowest median age of any of the Group of Seven
nations, according to United Nations&rsquo; estimates for 2010.
Youthfulness is one variable for future growth because younger people
tend to have more children.</p>

		<p>Actually, whites may be able to survive Miscegenation with Mexican immigrants and eliminate the problems with &#8216;diversity&rsquo;, if the number of white gay men stays small and Mexican women can be prevented from having numerous illegitimate children from different Mexican-American fathers. Perhaps the Southwest can be won, or eventually taken back considering the masses of whites in the rest of the country. There&rsquo;s no way whiteness can survive a blending with all the immigrant groups. </p>

<p>Gee, isn&rsquo;t he so intelligent?  I mean, who would have guessed having 15 million illegals added to the population would increase it?<br>

		<p>This is a trick being waged on white people.  There is no such thing as a &#8220;hispanic&#8221;.  There are white people, black people and amerind (mestizos) all of whom speak spanish.  They have extremely different genetic backgrounds, do not mix, for the most part, yet speak the same language.</p>
<p>Most of the &#8220;miscegenation&#8221; they are talking about is nothing but english speaking whites marrying spanish speaking whites.  And having kids who are white.  No different than a french person marrying a white person from britain or spain.</p>
<p>What these communists want you to think is that &#8220;miscegenation&#8221; is widespread, in the hopes that people will do it more.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  In fact, it&rsquo;s probably genetic.  At least one source I read put miscegenation at the same level today, where it faces almost zero social sanction (at least among whites) at EXACTLY the same rate as it was hundreds of years ago&hellip;..when it made you a literal outcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ironic that anti-life fascists who want to commit genocide against whites using inbreeding with psychopaths, use a divide and conquer strategy.</p>

		<p>I agree with poster #1 and would expand on it.  I work around an awful lot of latinos, and upwards of a quarter of them, especially the south americans, are basically white descended from numerous waves of european immigration to that region. (Spanish, Italian, English, German, etc)  Lighter skinned mestizos are also mostly white in their genetic makeup.</p>
<p>Many others like mexicans and puerto ricans have a lot of white in them too, so the white race can survive some mixing with them, as long as the core western values predominate.</p>
<p>Where I worry is with the introduction of large numbers of full-blooded indians from south of the border.  These are the people who have no white DNA and who are colonizers.  Whit(ish) latinos control latin american nations and are not sorry to see their indigenous population go to &#8216;al norte&rsquo; because they give them problems too.</p>

		<p>I think further growth of the Mexican population in the US is highly dangerous. It creates conditions for a general breakdown of law and order in which an Aztlan insurgency will thrive. The violent drug gangs on the border, with material assistance from any of our enemies, like Russia, Venezuela, North Korea, China, or Iran, could easily turn into a movement to reclaim territory in the west and south west. Most Mexicans will, at a minimum, be somewhat sympathetic and totally uncooperative with any attempt to reestablish US sovereignty. Never mind that their lives will be hell under Mestizo rebel control, this would be the Vietnam conflict all over again, with nearly every country in the world sympathizing with and aiding the brown people. There is no law of nature that says the US has to survive into the 22nd century.</p>
<p>Any politician who won&rsquo;t vote for lethal security measures on our southern border now is treasonous. And we need a total immigration moratorium in the next 4-6 years, or America has no future, which is to say our grand children well have to live through hell and persecution without a nation of their own. Perhaps they could go into the interior of the country and farm, imitating the whites in Zimbabwe or SA but look how swell that worked out for them   &mdash;   like I said, fight now against brown immigration, or persecution is the lot of your white grand children.</p>
<p>Also, Chicano studies departments in the US doing the spadework of radicalizing brown affirmative action students. This needs to be recognized for being the grave threat that it is. These departments are the equivalent of Madrassas in the Pakistan and the UK. They are actually preaching violence against whites NOW. Why none of these professors hasn&rsquo;t been sued, imprisoned, or fired is the clearest sign that white left wing progressives running our higher education institution are on board with the plan to destroy our nation.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I really believe this.  The Census reports 47 percent of all hispanics in the US are White but it&rsquo;s based on self identification which makes the data worthless.  All the hispanics I see definitely have significant amounts of Ameridian admixture in them and many of the people identifying themselves as White have kinky hair, shiny jet black hair or cocoa colored skin. They don&rsquo;t even approximate Southern Europeans which tend to be darker than the Northern variety.  I&rsquo;m not saying that White Hispanics don&rsquo;t exist but their numbers are alot smaller than what&rsquo;s being reported and I&rsquo;ve known Cubans, Puerto Ricans and even some Mexicans that no one would ever guess as being hispanic.  I&rsquo;ll go out on a limb here and say that most illegals are nonwhite because Latin American Whites live a good life in their own countries and would have little incentive to come here.</p>

		<p>Must agree with Jay and #3 about the numbers of white latinos. Its the indian latinos we need to be wary of, and they are the ones crossing the Rio Grande illegally, and probably close to 100% poor indian. What 90+% of americans dont know is that there is about 10% of latinos pure white, they run and own things, and another 10 or so% almost white as in Italian looking. They look nothing like the indian masses. I have traveled extensively in latin america and it seems some of the south american countries like Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, and parts of Colombia have a far higher % of whites. Peru, Equador and Bolvia have more indians, but still a small white upper class.   Someday I may marry my girlfreind of 3 years in Medellin Colombia. She is completely white looking, college grad,upper class, and if any of you saw us in public you would only think she is a very pretty white girl,,, what is she doing with that ugly old guy&hellip;.. Having babies with her I dont think would be considered misgenation as they would be 100% white. There is another problem nobody is talking about which is the increasing number of white males without females, much because so many white females go for the blacks and/or the sorry white bad boys. Where I live, with a 62% black population, its almost hard to find a young white girl with a white decent looking boyfreind, but everywhere you see pretty white girls with black boys. I know of many nice young white single guys and not many, if any single white girls. Point I am making is that the white latinas may be a salvation for the white race, along with importing some russian/ukranian type girls to help the white population survive. Things have changed in the last 20ish years, once it was more single females, but now with miscenation there are more single white guys, and thankfully, most single guys dont have any desire for the black girls as the white girls do for the black guys.

		<p>If people are serious about having White children who possess all the wonderful qualities of the the White race, it is really necessary to marry someone 100% White.  One takes a chance marrying someone who looks European but who is a mix with another race.  Some racial physical and emotional traits may be hidden and skip a generation or two, but they are there and will come forth.  </p>
<p>If you want White children and grandchildren, marry a White person, not a mixed person who looks White.</p>

		<p>Census data is highly unreliable.  Take a look at this:</p>
<p>https://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/00000.html</p>
<p>It reports the White population at 79.6 percent.  They arrived at that figure by dumping all the hispanics into the White category so that all those mixed race and Mezo-American Indians are now White.  </p>
