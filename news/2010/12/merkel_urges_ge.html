<h1><a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/idINTRE6AE3K520101115">Merkel Urges Germans: Stand Up for Christian Values</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Heneghan, Reuters, November 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Chancellor Angela Merkel urged Germans debating Muslim integration to stand up more for Christian values, saying Monday the country suffered not from &#8220;too much Islam&#8221; but &#8220;too little Christianity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Addressing her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party, she said she took the current public debate in Germany on Islam and immigration very seriously. As part of this debate, she said last month that multiculturalism there had utterly failed.</p>
<p>Some of her conservative allies have gone further, calling for an end to immigration from &#8220;foreign cultures&#8221;  &mdash;  a reference to Muslim countries like Turkey  &mdash;  and more pressure on immigrants to integrate into German society.</p>
<p>Merkel told the CDU annual conference in Karlsruhe that the debate about immigration &#8220;especially by those of the Muslim faith&#8221; was an opportunity for the ruling party to stand up confidently for its convictions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t have too much Islam, we have too little Christianity. We have too few discussions about the Christian view of mankind,&#8221; she said to applause from the hall.</p>
<p>Germany needs more public discussion &#8220;about the values that guide us (and) about our Judeo-Christian tradition,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We have to stress this again with confidence, then we will also be able to bring about cohesion in our society.&#8221;</p>
<p>References to the CDU&rsquo;s Christian roots and &#8220;Christian view of mankind&#8221; are standard in party convention speeches, but the phrases have become more frequent in recent months as Germany has been gripped by a heated debate over Islam and immigration.</p>
<p>DEFINING CULTURAL IDENTITY</p>
<p>The debate began last summer when former Bundesbank board member Thilo Sarrazin published a bestselling book arguing that Muslim immigrants were simple-minded welfare spongers who threatened the country&rsquo;s economy and its long-term future.</p>
<p>President Christian Wulff, a Christian Democrat, fueled the controversy last month by saying Islam &#8220;belongs to Germany&#8221; because of the four million Muslims who now live there.</p>
<p>Merkel has sharpened her rhetoric on immigration in recent weeks while avoiding the toughest tones coming from the CDU&rsquo;s Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU).</p>
<p>But her party looks set to pass a resolution Tuesday stressing that German culture has Judeo-Christian roots, an idea that critics say aims to marginalize Islam.</p>
<p>The resolution says Germany&rsquo;s cultural identity is based on the &#8220;Christian-Jewish tradition,&#8221; ancient and Enlightenment philosophy and the nation&rsquo;s historical experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;We expect that those who come here respect them and recognize them, while keeping their personal identity,&#8221; it says.</p>
<p>The term &#8220;cultural identity&#8221; (Leitkultur) is the CDU&rsquo;s answer to multicultural policies favored by the left-wing opposition, especially the Greens, which Merkel said has failed.</p>
<p>Merkel said this identity did not limit religious freedom and the same principle must apply for Christians elsewhere, a clear reference to Christian minorities in Muslim countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, we&rsquo;re for freedom to practice one&rsquo;s faith,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But that also means religious freedom cannot stop at our borders. That applies also for Christians in other countries around the world.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Incrementally, one step at a time, perhaps our voices are being taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Before immigration was never questioned, neither was the Islamization of the West.</p>
<p>Now little by little what was politically incorrect is starting to become standard discourse.</p>
<p>Perhaps soon enough, the race question won&rsquo;t be so taboo, either.</p>

		<p>In my opinion, Europe can be saved from Islamization by returning to Christianity.</p>
<p>The West has been on a decline since the 1960s. We essentially lost our cultural identity as a people. Multiculturalism is basically a symptom of a culture not having an identity. I believe that Christianity is a core component to our identity as Westerners. Returning to God will give us a sense of purpose once again.</p>

		<p>No, they have too much Islam. What is she saying? That if Germans were more devout Christians, that they would make more babies and somewhere along the way inspire all the Muslim immigrants to convert to Christianity? How naive can she be?</p>

<p>&gt; Too bad the Christianity Merkel is speaking of is that one that accepts other religions and their cultures in a multicultural fashion, only asking that perhaps Christians and Jews won&rsquo;t be persecuted in mono-cultural Islamic nations.  She is actually saying that being more &#8220;Christian&#8221; will lead to a peaceful assimilation of Muslims into Germany, not the resistance to non-European/Christian settlement that readers here are hoping to read in.</p>
<p>The only hope for Europe remains a return to its indigenous roots which gave Europeans true uniqueness and cultural definition before the invasion of Christianity, which is really a Middle-Eastern patriarchal form of Judaism combined with Helenistic polytheism.  Christianity seeks to include/convert all peoples of the world, regardless of their color or cultural identity, it has always replaced/absorbed the host culture as a matter of historical fact and its repeatedly declared mission.  In fact, I suggest that the tendency of whites, including most Amren posters who think they are acting from Christian motives are actually expressing their genetically embedded tendency for separate identity as a distinct people with an agressive sense of honor which is a pre-Christian Nordic/Germanic trait, and part of the long established spirituality of that people.  If they were to discard their thin veneer of Christian claims, they would find themselves no longer easily identifiable hypocrites (according to Christian definitions), but aligned from start to finish with purpose and connected to their glorious ancestors, back to the beginning, rather than read about a myth spun in Mesopotamia.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m really impressed with some of the commentary coming out<br>
of Germany. Some important German Commentator was saying recently<br>
that the Holocaust doesn&rsquo;t justify transforming Germany through Immigration. Some German intellectuals have been criticizing<br>
Multiculturalism and Political correctness in the sophisticated<br>

<p><br>
There never will be &ldquo;cohesion&rsquo; in German society as long as the flood gates remain open for a group of people who perceive Judeo-Christians as the infidels.  The radical moslim parasites infesting Germany do not give a squat about &#8220;Judeo-Christian&#8221; values! I agree with the more &#8220;conservative approach&#8221;, which is to halt foreign immigration from third world moslim countries and to forcibly remove those enemies currently squatting In Germany and living off the public dole if they make any trouble whatsoever in that country!</p>

		<p>One guess:  There&rsquo;s an election coming up in Germany.</p>
<p>BTW, it&rsquo;s not that Germany &#8220;doesn&rsquo;t suffer from too much Islam&#8221; (it does, actually) and &#8220;does suffer from too little Christianity,&#8221; it suffers from too many non-whites and too little white solidarity.  Faith is irrelevant here.  Not only that, I think she&rsquo;s trying to use it as a convenient circumlocution for race.</p>

		<p>Germany treats Scientologists like criminals. Scientology claims it&rsquo;s a religion.  The Germans don&rsquo;t care. Not as many scientologists in the Reich as Muslims, who do the work the aging Germans won&rsquo;t do.  When Germany treats Islam like the bizarre cult it is, and lumps the Muslims together with the Scientologists, then Merkel&rsquo;s rhetoric will have some substance.Until then, the Muslims are going nowhere, and being Muslims, they have no intention of assimilation, of tolerance of others, or of forswearing ultimate violent overthrow of the society the passive Merkel claims to defend. Europe used to know how to deal with Muslims because it knew then but not now I&rsquo;m afraid that co-existence is impossible with this violent political movement posing as a &#8220;religion&#8221;. America and Europe are sitting ducks until they declare war on these aggressive parasites.</p>

		<p>I hate when cultural identity, heritage, etc., is all boiled down to religion(from any side). It is a device obviously used to avoid discussing or even acknowledging race! Germans weren&rsquo;t German because they were Christian - they were German because they were GERMAN!! Same must be said for French, English, Norwegian, Pole, etc. Yes, religion played a part and very much informed manifold aspects of western society for centuries - but it is race and ethnicity that ultimately makes ALL the difference. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Leitkultur&#8221; in German does not mean &#8220;cultural identity&#8221; (that would be &#8220;kulturelle Identitat&#8221;).  It means literally &#8220;leading culture&#8221;, i.e. a country&rsquo;s predominant culture.  That&rsquo;s what Merkel meant: that Christian tradition is and should continue to be Germany&rsquo;s predominant culture.</p>

		<p>Switzerland cut out the welfare payments for immigrants, and immigration went down considerably. Now they are working on new laws to make it even tougher to immigrate there. For instance they are now considering immigrants must know one of the spoken languaages of Switzerland in order to be &#8220;considered&#8221; for staying there. They basically want to weed out the less desirable and intelligent immigrants. Switzerland is a small country, but because they don&rsquo;t try to be politically correct they have courage to keep their country Swiss&hellip;</p>

		<p>I disagree with Whiteplight.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a regular reader of <i>American Renaissance</i> since 2006 and post comments occasionally. I&rsquo;ve read Whiteplight&rsquo;s comments many times. He is intelligent and has a lot of knowledge about history. But it is ironic that he, having a high IQ and being highly historically literate, could be so uninformed about pre-Christian Europe.</p>
<p>Consider the pre-Christian practices Gaul. Greek and Roman writers frequently made references to the Celts&rsquo; rituals where they sacrificed humans. The Romans, who forced people to fight each other to death in an arena for entertainment purposes, weren&rsquo;t any better. However, Christian Rome put an end to this barbaric practice of gladiators.</p>
<p>Also consider pre-Christian Scandinavia. Persian traveller Ibn Rustah described how the Vikings terrorized and enslaved the Slavs. So many Slavs were enslaved by the Vikings for so many centuries that the the term &#8220;slave&#8221; derived from their name, not only in English, but in other European languages and in Arabic. This barbarism was ended when the Scandinavian people embraced Christianity.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other examples of barbarism in pre-Christian Europe. You can read all about pre-Christian Europe online.</p>
<p>Some critics may say that I&rsquo;m ignoring the bad aspects of Christian Europe like the Dark Ages. But keep in mind that correlation doesn&rsquo;t equal causation. In other words, Christianity didn&rsquo;t cause the Dark Ages. Europe would have went through the Dark Ages regardless of which religion was the most prevalent at the time.</p>
<p>Promoting one-sided, biased ideas to advocate an anti-Christian position while ignoring contrary, important facts is the very definition of intellectual dishonesty.</p>

<p><br>
Wrong!<br>
Returning to Christianity won&rsquo;t save Europe as long as white Europeans produce fewer babies and as long as a significant number of Muslims reside within Europe.</p>
<p>The only thing that is going to save Europe is the mass expulsion of Muslims. This is how Spain liberated herself from Islamic rule that lasted 500 years.</p>
<p>What you conclude is a popular belief among naive conservatives and Republicans, but it has no ground. What matters is demography and numbers only, nothing else.<br>
For example, adherence to Christianity didn&rsquo;t save the Christian Maronites in Lebanon from a demographic Muslim takeover of their country.</p>

		<p>There are plenty of Christians in South America and much of Africa that could be imported into Germany.  That, by Merkel&rsquo;s logic, would solve Germany&rsquo;s problem.  </p>
<p>There are plenty of Christians to go around but only one Germany.  Germany&rsquo;s problem is that too few Germans are being born.  Regardless of whether they&rsquo;re Christian, pagan, athetist, or something else, Germany needs Germans.</p>

		<p>What do Italy, France and Germany have in common? A *close relationship with Russia* and a tougher recent stance regarding immigration in the case of France &amp; Italy but I suspect Germany will follow. I may have been wrong about Merkel, perhaps she IS reformable. The South Stream frees Europe from paying for Arab oil with AfroMuslim immigration. Russia won&rsquo;t exploit fellow Europeans, not even Germans</p>

		<p>Jared,</p>
<p>as a German citizen, let me assure you that Angela Merkel is not &#8220;getting there&#8221;. In fact this former Stasi snitch (her code name was &#8220;IM Erika&#8221;. Google it.) is doing her best - which is considerable - to destroy our nation.</p>
<p>Her rethoric sounds reasonable. Her deeds are something entirely different: She is flooding the place with Middle Easterners and Africans wich are now euphemistically called &#8220;Fachkräfte&#8221;. This roughly  translates to &#8220;expert workers&#8221;. </p>
<p>The other day, five expert workers burglarized the home of a 77 year old German. However the old man was on guard and shot one of the intruders, a 16 year old expert worker. As we speak (or write) authorities are busy dragging the 77 year old in court and locking him up. For defending his home!</p>
<p>THAT is the state of the nation in Germany. Please, Jared, never be fooled by &#8220;IM Erika&#8220;&#8216;s rethoric. That reptile is set to do more damage to this country than Herr Hitler. Not only is she aiding and abetting a slow motion  foreign invasion, she is also stoking a hyperinflation in Europe.</p>
<p>I fear that her reign will not end in a bunker, pounded by soviet shells, but in a plush swiss resort. There, from the top of the alps, she will look down on the wasteland formerly called Germany.</p>
<p>I am perplexed that many foreigners make her out to be some kind of closet nationalist as well as a fiscal conservative. At heart she is still the old Stasi snitch (albeit now with a profit motive) and her actions attest to that truth louder than words ever could.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Franz</p>

<p>Hmmm&hellip; No, I think what she is saying or trying to provoke, is the idea that being more &#8220;Christian&#8221; would result in more acceptance of Islam by Christians in Germany, that being &#8220;Christian&#8221; means allowing Muslims to live in their towns, cities, and in their work places.  Its based on the perverse idea that by taking abuse from other religions, groups, governments, etc., that you will win them over in the end.  That is a very dangerous expectation.</p>

		<p>Pity the European Christians.  They gave up without resistance.  They allow the Muslims behaviors that the Christians themselves prohibit as barbarian.  Yet by allowing those behaviors, the dysfunctional behaviors are further encouraged.  Modern European evolution, inclusive of the reformation, has brought them the fruits of being more productive and innovative.  But the comforts of wealth have left Europe too tolerate of others, irrespective of those destructive Muslim behaviors.  Most great civilizations were destroyed from within.  This will be a hybrid with the weakness from within includes willfully inviting the invaders through the gates to freely partake of that social wealth but without contributing.  And some would say subtracting from Western civilization.  This is folly.</p>

		<p>Read &#8220;The Islamic Antichrist&#8221; and you will see the Islamic agenda for the west.  Their coming messiah, &#8220;Mahdi&#8221; mirrors the beast of Revelation quite closely.  I recommend this book for anyone interested in end of the age prophecy.</p>

<p>Faith is a matter of individual choice and a very personal decision, so I won&rsquo;t argue with you in that arena.  However, I think the better idea is not to let calls of &#8220;hypocrisy&#8221; bother you when you&rsquo;re focused on racial survival.  Really, it&rsquo;s not &#8220;hypocrisy&#8221; that is the accusation here, it&rsquo;s &#8220;inconsistency&#8221; that people are scared of.  Like I&rsquo;ve said here before, consistency is for dorks (I know, I don&rsquo;t include mathematical, scientific, legal or logical consistency in that definition   &mdash;   We&rsquo;ve had that discussion).  Who cares if &#8220;pure Christianity&#8221; even in the form of a &#8220;thin veneer&#8221; is inconsistent with our racial survival?  Like I said, faith is a matter of the heart anyway.  It&rsquo;s never bothered our enemies of their blatant hypocrisy or inconsistency, which we could spend terabytes of AR&rsquo;s server&rsquo;s space expounding upon.  They don&rsquo;t care about inconsistent, they care about racial survival and power.  And so should we.</p>

		<p>Merkel is just grandstanding for political reasons.  Her saying things like this hurts our cause because it keeps many people from voting for politicians who would actually do something.  </p>

		<p>Too little, too late. The modern &#8216;aggiornimento&rsquo;/syncretism of 1958-1965, has turned into the melee of religious wars, that make the Protestant Reformation in Germany look like a picnic in the park.</p>
<p>But at least the White Man is realizing, as Gary North has said, &#8216;There IS no neutrality.&rsquo; You can&rsquo;t HAVE a stable society without a religion permeating that society. And the only religion that gives stability is Christianity. This, of course, is ananthema to liberals, libertarians, deviants, and demoniacs, but there you are.</p>
<p>Someone HAS to rule, and it might as well be Christ. After all, weren&rsquo;t we once called Christen-dom?</p>

		<p>White nationalists are clutching at straws for any bit good news, but still they have to be patient and take care.</p>
<p>#23 Franz from Germany is correct with his observations. One must look at the actions of all German ministers together, and that essentially is anti-German and pro-multicultural. Since the Fall of the Wall Germany has also swallowed up all the left-wing elements and communist ideologists, and they are hard at work trying to make their influence felt.</p>
<p>Why are there at this present moment more than 10 000 Germans in jail due to thought crimes?</p>
