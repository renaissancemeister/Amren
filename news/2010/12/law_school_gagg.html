			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Adam Kissel, New York Post, December 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Law student at Syracuse University is facing possible expulsion for &#8220;harassment,&#8221; but he doesn&rsquo;t know who his accusers are or even why he&rsquo;s in trouble.</p>
<p>The source of all the trouble is a fake news blog called SUCOLitis. It&rsquo;s like The Onion, but it focuses on making fun of life in law school. In one post, the &#8220;Faculty Committee on Aesthetic Standards&#8221; names the Class of 2013 &#8220;Most Attractive in History.&#8221; In another, a beer bong is elected class president.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Nobody has taken responsibility for the anonymous blog. But one student, Len Audaer, appears to be facing prosecution anyway.</p>
<p>Law professor Gregory Germain (the &#8220;prosecutor&#8221; of this case in the school&rsquo;s judicial system) began investigating Len two months ago, and has kept Len completely in the dark for the whole two months. Who are the accusers? Which blog post was harassing? Len doesn&rsquo;t know. How could he even start to defend himself?</p>
<p>Knowing that universities can&rsquo;t defend in public what they try to do in private, Len sought to draw attention to these abuses. But Germain is now seeking a gag order that would severely hurt Len&rsquo;s efforts to publicize his situation. Germain wants to require any journalist reporting on the case to sign away the right to publish any case document unless the document is published whole. No excerpts, no quotations.</p>
<p>Germain knows full well that this would essentially prevent Audaer from appealing to the court of public opinion, leaving him no choice but to silently accept the findings of a campus judiciary that seems determined to get him.</p>
<p>The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE, where I work) has stepped in to protect Len&rsquo;s rights. {snip}</p>

		<p>Welcome to the Marxist Law School.  This poor student, if he survives it, will be quite familiar with the Law as practices nationally if Obama and the DWL&rsquo;s have their way.<br>
It&rsquo;s the ONLY kind of law that will be practiced.  We are seeing the pre-cursors already - currently called &#8220;activist judges&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Why this guy would want to stay at a rat hole that claims to be part of legitimate academia is beyond me.</p>
<p>He would do far better to go to an institution that allows free speech and is not rife with radical leftists who are so dense and out of touch with reality they&rsquo;re disgusting.</p>
<p>If a person is truly bright, going to one of the PC monstrosities isn&rsquo;t going to really help him one iota, because he can learn just as well&hellip;.and probably better&hellip;..while he&rsquo;s studying anywhere really, and he can earn well when he gets out.</p>
<p>A certificate from one of the &#8220;big name&#8221; leftist thought cemetaries really means nothing anymore, except to a few low class snobs who are out of touch with the real world.  </p>
<p>Who have they graduated in the past several years who are truly brilliant people?  Gates at Harvard of, &#8220;I&rsquo;ll go outside wi&rsquo; yo&rsquo; mama&#8221; fame, and the brilliant Van Jones who shouted, &#8220;We gonna change the system!  We gonna change the system!&#8221;?????</p>
<p>The famous hot shot universities should be very proud to be part of the bigotry that has overtaken this country.  I mean, after all, their personnel are the ones who helped degenerate it to its present level.  And that will continue until they are all  removed completely.  Nothing else is an option.</p>

		<p>Why is Prof. Germain even a professor?  Who would hire someone who desires to restrict free speech in order to harass vocal students?  The student, Len Audaer, is clearly the victim of the professor&rsquo;s harassment.    He should file a counter suit in a regular court.  But, unfortunately, hatred of the US Constitution seems to be a requirement for hiring professors at many universities.  One can imagine the grades that such professors award to students who fail to espouse the politically correct line.  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -HM</p>

		<p>This story reminds me of &#8216;The Gulag Archipelago&rsquo;. Being accused of a crime is itself proof of guilt. If the crime is unstated them the guilt is greater. And at a law school of course.</p>
<p>So is this type of reasoning going to be in America&rsquo;s future courtroom? Question: Where do these people such as Law professor Gregory Germain come from? Perhaps the nearby nut house. I&rsquo;m keeping my kids as far away from &#8216;higher&rsquo; ed as possible.</p>

		<p>All of academia is either under the direct control of the left or strongly controlled by it.  Any and all dissent is to be silenced.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter what the accusation is; if the left decides one is wrong, he is wrong, and there is no defense.  <br>
The best a collegiate can now do is to stick strictly to his studies.  Parrot back what the profs want, get one&rsquo;s degree, and get the hell out.</p>

		<p>From he NY Post article: &#8220;While Syracuse is a private university not bound by the First Amendment, it promises students &#8220;the right to express themselves freely on any subject.&#8221; It also promises students &#8220;the right to fundamental fairness.&#8221;&#8221; Breech of contract, full refund and possibly damages. Only a government can censor, but this is unpleasant indeed. If the anonymous complainer is a straight white male of political right leanings I will eat a shoe. Not impossible but unlikely. </p>

		<p>The accused, Len should get a lawyer to go after Syracuse, big-time. The Bill of Rights applies to all Americans, wherever they may be, in the U.S.A., whether Syracuse University likes it or not. Len deserves to have his day in a legally recognized court of law, NOT some college kangaroo court.</p>
<p>So what if Syracuse is a &#8220;private&#8221; university; their students do not cede their constitutional rights on campus grounds. </p>

<p>Bingo.  I mean, is murder any less wrong or should it be any less a crime or not a crime at all if it occurs on a private campus?  That&rsquo;s the simple answer.</p>
<p>The more complicated answer is that Hillsdale College touts its independence by not accepting any student who uses any form of state or Federal aid, even &#8220;aid&#8221; as tenuous as the GI Bill or private loans whose interest Uncle Sam guarantees.  (Though I think the latter was done away with this past year.)  Because any hook the state or Feds can use to get into your business, they will, and use it to the hilt.  As it is, Hillsdale is considering ditching its non-profit 501-c-whatever status, out of fear that the Feds will use that as a hook.</p>
<p>Obviously, Syracuse isn&rsquo;t that diligent, if at all.  There&rsquo;s the hook that an honest government could use to force Syracuse to abide by the First Amendment (and the Second, to be honest.)</p>
