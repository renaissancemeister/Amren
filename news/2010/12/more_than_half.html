<h1>More Than Half of All Prince George&rsquo;s, DC Families Headed by Single Parents</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Liz Farmer, Examiner (Washington, D.C.), December 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than half of family households in parts of the District of Columbia and Prince George&rsquo;s County are run by single parents, a home life that experts say increases their children&rsquo;s chances of following in the same footsteps.</p>
<p>The section of D.C. across the Anacostia River is home to the biggest percentage of single-parent households, with 65 percent of family households run by women and 9 percent run by men. The remaining one-quarter of the roughly 32,000 family households are run by married couples, according to the Census Bureau&rsquo;s American Community Survey.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other areas in which more than half of families are run by single parents include the remainder of Southeast D.C. and most of Northeast D.C. and areas in Prince George&rsquo;s near the Capital Beltway. In Langley Park, single-father households actually outnumber single-mother households by a 4-3 ratio.</p>
<p>That these areas have a high minority population, particularly among blacks and Hispanics, is not a coincidence, said Ron Haskins, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.</p>
<p>&#8220;About 70 percent of black kids are born outside marriage, and then you have those born in a marriage, about half of them end in divorce,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And first-generation Hispanics have a relatively low divorce rate .&nbsp;.&nbsp.; but once you get into the second generation that disappears.&#8221;</p>
<p>Haskins said many factors contribute to the high concentration of single-parent households among those minority groups, but &#8220;the bottom line is I don&rsquo;t think anyone really understands why.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Prince George&rsquo;s County used to be the place whites moved to when blacks took over their neighborhoods in Washington, DC, and crime rates rose.  Blacks take their social pathologies with them wherever they go.  They seem incapable of creating civilized communities.  </p>

<p>Here is why.  Broadly speaking there are two models for bringing children into the world: the &ldquo;responsible model&rdquo;  &mdash;  high parental investment (from both the father and mother) of time and resources in raising children  &mdash;  and the &ldquo;irresponsible model&rdquo;  &mdash;  low parental investment (from the father and mother) of time and resources.</p>
<p>Virtually all public policy  &mdash;  federal, state and local  &mdash;  from the civil rights era onward has rewarded irresponsible parenting and punished  &mdash;  via increasing taxation and other policies  &mdash;  responsible parenting. </p>
<p>The result has been a dramatic increase in irresponsible parenting: from 3.1 percent of out-of-wedlock births for white mothers in 1965 to 29 percent in 2008; and from 24 percent of out-of-wedlock births for African-American mothers in 1965 to 72 percent in 2008. </p>
<p>Government policies that reward irresponsible parenting and punish responsible parenting are not sustainable. If the family is to be restored, governments must shrink. </p>

<p>Really?  No one really understands?  The idea of a marriage being between a single man and a single woman is only prevalent in Judeo-Christian history.  Monogamy was certainly not practiced in Africa or the Americas before the white man arrived.  Add to the fact that blacks and now &#8220;hispanics&#8221; know how to play the welfare game that rewards mothers for having babies out of wedlock and you get absurdly high birthrates to single mothers.  See, it wasn&rsquo;t too hard to figure out.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s that way because that&rsquo;s the way they want it, that&rsquo;s why. Action speaks louder than words. Different cultures, different values, different attitudes, different behavior. Once you realize this the big picture becomes clearer without needing a sociology professor to give some convoluted answer.</p>

<p>Maybe Mr. Haskins - &#8220;a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution&#8221; - should visit this site. We understand why. I have a feeling he wouldn&rsquo;t want to hear it though. </p>

		<p>Marriage rates are plummeting all over the country.  Where I&rsquo;m at, many young whites also forego marriage, but still white people are more likely to marry than others.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a neat observation.  </p>
<p>Where I work there are whites, latinos and a couple of blacks. (About 35 people in total.)  All the white males except for one young guy are married.  </p>
<p>All the white females are unmarried and a couple are single mothers whose children are biracial.  None of the latinos (about 10 people) save for one older woman is married, and her husband is white.  None of the blacks are married.  One asian woman is married, but to a white guy too.</p>
<p>So in a microcosm of a typical urban office work environment, white males are the only &#8216;marrying&rsquo; ones, while non-whites and liberal females go wanting.</p>

		<p>If 70% of black children are born outside of marriage, how is it startling news that 50% of black households are headed by a single parent? It would seem like this neighborhood has reason to celebrate.</p>

		<p>This is no surprise to any of us acquainted with PG i.e. &#8220;Purely Ghetto&#8221; County. The place was a pit 25 years ago. I know. I grew up there. Once I was old enough I got out of there quicker than you could say &#8220;Landover Mall.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funny thing is that I never saw a white lefty in the area in the 20 years I lived there. They usually stayed in Rockville and Bethesda, preaching the beauty of diversity. Go figure. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you why blacks have a 72% out of wedlock birthrate and a huge number of single &#8220;parent&#8221; households. First, they don&rsquo;t really care. If they did then this would not be the case.</p>
<p>So, why don&rsquo;t they care? Do they not see the overwhelming social pathology destroying everything around them? Or that the upward mobility of their people is coming only from being pushed up by others. I believe they don&rsquo;t care because, on the whole, they lack the innate intelligence required to figure out the problem so they could care in the first place.</p>
<p>They live naturally at a subsistence level. Once that is met, by hook or by crook, they do nothing more. They are likely capable of somewhat better achievement but they have to be pressed - like children - who need to learn responsibility.</p>
<p>The root cause is most certainly insane liberal policy linked to the &#8220;Great Society&#8221; (now there&rsquo;s an oxymoron). All it did was allow a taxpayer-funded subsistence existence for a race that had no ambition, desire, or brains to move beyond what was handed to them.</p>
<p>It is not going to change - it will only get worse. The money has run out and this branch on the evolutionary tree isn&rsquo;t going anywhere. </p>
<p>It is not the foreign aid or the occasional, questionable wars or the mindless pop culture that will destroy this country. They are really minor issues used to deflect attention from the rot within - the rot of some 15% of bottom-feeding Americans sucking out the marrow from the other 85%. </p>

		<p>Though the &#8220;single parent&#8221; households may be a female head, since they are mostly black, there will ALWAYS be a &#8220;baby daddy&#8221;or &#8220;baby daddIES&#8221; hanging around, loafing, eating, drinking and doing the sex thing with the &#8220;baby momma&#8221; especially around welfare check deposit time.</p>

		<p>Every single american should get a flat 15,000 dollars a year. No more welfare. What you chose to do with your money is up to you. If you want to try to raise 10 kids on that amount and not work more power to you. No more welfare, no more disability, no more governent administration. </p>
<p>Of course it would never happen.</p>

		<p>Hark, I thought Prince George&rsquo;s was a county of black affluence, a veritable Shangri-la for African-Americans.  I would be willing to bet that the number of fatherless families approaches 80 % inside the Beltway and is close to 95 % in places like Palmer Park, Seat Pleasant, Fairmont Heights, Kent Village, North Brentwood, Chillum, Silver Hill, Suitland, Morningside, Oxen Hill, Landover, Forest HeightsCapitol Heights, District Heights, Bradbury Heights, Coral Hills, Chapel Oaks, Colmar Manor and Cottage City.</p>
