			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andy Dolan, Daily Mail (London), November 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An Asian gang of &#8216;sexual predators&rsquo; cruised city streets for girls as young as 12  &mdash;  usually white  &mdash;  who were then plied with drink and drugs and raped or abused.</p>
<p>Up to 100 &#8216;vulnerable&rsquo; girls may have been groomed, abused or supplied cocaine by married fathers Abid Saddique and Mohammed Liaqat, and their friends.</p>
<p>A court heard the pair used Liaqat&rsquo;s BMW saloon to trawl for victims, pulling up alongside girls outside shops or schools and chatting them up before a &#8216;campaign of calls and texts&rsquo; to groom them.</p>
<p>Saddique, 27, and Liaqat, 28, plied the victims  &mdash;  most from broken homes  &mdash;  with vodka and cocaine before taking them to &#8216;parties&rsquo; in hotels or flats with other gang members to rape or degrade them.</p>
<p>When girls refused their advances they were threatened with hammers or thrown out of cars.</p>
<p>Yesterday Saddique and Liaqat, each British-born and of Pakistani origin with an arranged marriage, faced years behind bars after being found guilty of a catalogue of sexual abuse over an 18-month period.</p>
<p>Reporting restrictions were lifted at the end of a third and final trial into the Derby gang&rsquo;s activities.</p>
<p>Seven other guilty members of the gang have already been jailed.</p>
<p>One of 26 alleged victims concerned in the gang&rsquo;s trials was a 14-year-old straight-A student from a middle-class home.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, one victim was in care, a second was with council foster parents and others were known to social services. Questions will now be asked about whether the various agencies worked well enough together to protect the girls.</p>
<p>The inquiry began in late 2008 when Saddique and Liaqat, both fathers-of-one, were arrested for shoplifting and two young girls were discovered with alcohol in their car.</p>
<p>Police swooped in April 2009 when two teenagers came out of a flat officers were watching and reported they had been raped. The surveillance teams had not known the girls were there.</p>
<p>After yesterday&rsquo;s verdicts at Leicester Crown Court, a senior officer warned that child exploitation and abuse was a &#8216;hidden&rsquo; problem nationwide.</p>
<p>Detective Inspector Sean Dawson, of Derbyshire Police, said: &#8216;I would appeal to parents to monitor their children&rsquo;s phones .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and think about if they come home smelling of alcohol or clutching gifts. These are all signs that children could be being groomed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He said that although all of the victims were white except for three mixed-race girls and two Asians, the men were &#8216;out for whatever sex they could get&rsquo; and did not care what race their victims were. The oldest victim was 18 but most were aged between 14 and 16.</p>
<p>One girl described a sexual assault involving at least eight men, although charges in relation to that incident were not proceeded with.</p>
<p>Many attacks were filmed on mobile phones as &#8216;trophies&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The inquiry, called Operation Retriever, is the biggest child sex investigation ever conducted by Derbyshire Police. A total of 75 charges were brought against 13 suspects  &mdash;  all of Derby. Four were cleared.</p>
<p>Saddique, from Normanton, Derby, was convicted of four rapes, two false imprisonment charges, aiding and abetting rape, three counts of sexual activity with a child, two sexual assaults, being involved with child pornography and attempting to pervert the course of justice. An additional rape charge was ordered to lie on the file when the jury could not reach a verdict.</p>
<p>Unemployed Liaqat, of Sinfin, Derby, was convicted of rape, aiding and abetting rape, being involved with child pornography, two sexual assaults, four counts of sexual activity with a child, and affray.</p>
<p>Of the other defendants, Akshay Kumar, 38, Faisal Mehmood, 24, Mohamed Imran Rehman, 26, Ziafat Yasin, 31, and Graham Blackham, 26  &mdash;  a convicted sex offender who was the only non-Asian member of the gang to face a judge  &mdash;  have already been jailed after being convicted of a string of sex or drug offences.</p>
<p>Liaqat&rsquo;s brother, Naweed, 33, and Farooq Amed, 28, pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice and were both jailed for 18 months.</p>
<p>Convictions were achieved in relation to 15 of the 26 victims across the three trials.</p>
<p>Saddique and Liaqat will be sentenced at Nottingham Crown Court in January.</p>
<p>A Serious Case Review by Derby Safeguarding Children Board is due to be published about the case imminently.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;At first I saw them as father figures&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>One victim, who was raped in a car after being driven to a country lane by Liaqat and a second man, told how she was targeted aged 16 after telling the men she came from a broken home.</p>
<p>She said: &#8216;They would take you out, buy you ice creams and take you out for a lovely nice meal. And there&rsquo;s part of you that thinks it&rsquo;s really exciting and there&rsquo;s part of you that thinks, &#8220;I have met this lovely nice man and he&rsquo;s taking me out for a really nice meal&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8216;And there&rsquo;s part of you that looks at these men as a father figure, as weird as it sounds, because you feel like they&rsquo;re going to keep you safe and they then abuse every part of that.</p>
<p>&#8216;They make you feel the most insecure you have felt in your entire life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The brunette, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, repeatedly broke down in tears as she recounted her ordeal in an interview with the BBC.</p>
<p>She said the gang asked questions such as &#8216;Who do you live with?&rsquo; in order to work out &#8216;what kind of protection you&rsquo;ve got, what kind of safety you&rsquo;ve got, who&rsquo;s going to stick up for you if they do anything&rsquo;.</p>
<p>She added: &#8216;They actually take advantage of the fact that no one does care about you really. They make you feel as if they&rsquo;re on your side and that you are in a real relationship and they just abuse any feelings of love and caring about people. I think they&rsquo;re evil. I just cannot understand what has made them so evil.&rsquo;</p>
<p>During the first trial in March, the teenager told the jury she was picked up around 1am then the men bought vodka at a petrol station.</p>
<p>After pulling up in the lane, they got into the back of the car, sitting on either side of her, and began molesting her. She was then forced down and restrained as one of the men raped her.</p>
<p>Sobbing, the teenager told the court that her attacker then got back in the driver&rsquo;s seat and &#8216;put the music on and acted like nothing had happened&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Outrageous! Young white girls are being raped by foreign beasts and yet they (the foreigners) are not executed for this violation after they&rsquo;ve been caught and convicted? It&rsquo;s absolutely OBSCENE. If we truly cared about our children we&rsquo;d have their heads on pikes.</p>

<p>Disgusting Pakis&hellip;..They are as bad as blacks and mexicans in our country&hellip; The White fathers and family members of these girls need to go after those punks and start a movement to rid their country of 3rd world immigrants. But, they won&rsquo;t just as in America, the White family members don&rsquo;t go after the blacks and mexicans that murder and rape their kids  and family members.</p>

		<p>The British authorities will take pains to describe this as mere criminality, and shy away from further analysis.</p>
<p>On a much deeper level, this behaviour comes from a primal place, the same aggressive instinct which man shares with animals.   It is biological aggression directed at the conquest of the host white race which drives immigrant Pakistanis and Arabs to target white females.</p>
<p>Genghis Khan (a blood ancestor of modern central Asians) once waxed poetic about the joys of sexual conquest:</p>
<p>&#8220;The greatest happiness is to scatter your enemy, to drive him before you, to see his cities reduced to ashes, to see those who love him shrouded in tears, and to gather into your bosom his wives and daughters&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mere criminality doesn&rsquo;t go far enough to explain why Arabs and Pakistanis do this in Australia, Canada, the United States, Britain, Europe and Scandinavia. It is primal instinct which provides motivation.</p>

		<p>We have the same thing in this country, where runaway white juvenile girls are sold into sexual slavery by black pimps, usually addicted to drugs, often raped, and sometimes murdered while the government and media participate in these crimes by consciously turning a blind eye to them for reasons of racial correctness.   Sex slavery of children is an explosive topic but the media and government won&rsquo;t really touch it because they know all about this black-on-white racist mass-rape of children and choose to value their political coalition over the lives of their victims.  That and the pure joy they get from seeing whites being degraded.   What sadistic pleasure there is in knowing you can mass-rape and murder the children of your victims while making them smile and silently accept it.  No one in this country would dare bring up this indisputably real and important racism story.  Raping the wives and daughters of your hated victims, now that&rsquo;s power.    Another factor is that some of our new neighbors from south of the border have a rather old-fashioned idea about the age of consent, something the system is not eager to publicize. </p>

<p>Asian? Does that mean they were Koran, Japanese or Chinese? I am surprised they didn&rsquo;t say &#8220;British gangs&#8221;</p>
<p>They should have said &#8220;Islamic jihadist rape girls of conquered country. Attackers says they are acting in accordance to sharia law and are justified in committing these acts.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>I do not attribute this behaviour to their creed.  </p>
<p>Although Islam gives them intellectual permission to use the infidel&rsquo;s women, it is their primal urges to conquer white flesh which motivates them. </p>
<p>If Islam didn&rsquo;t exist, they would still act exactly the same.</p>

<p>In British English &#8220;Asian&#8221; usually refers to South Asians and not East Asians.</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/British-Asians" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/British-Asians</a> (Wikipedia)</p>
<p>In many other European countries the word Asian is also commonly used about West Asians like Arabs, Persians, Turks, Afghanis etc.</p>
<p>I think the use of the word often will reflect which part of Asia a country has got most immigrants from.</p>

<p>Bud,<br>
I see it all the time on the streets of Atlantic City. Two or three young White girls being herded by Black thugs. Their beauty had begun to fade and they all seem to have a blank stare as if there isn&rsquo;t any more emotion behind those eyes.<br>
I see them treating them in ways I wouldn&rsquo;t treat a pet lizard. I sometimes fantasize about running my SUV up onto the curb and crushing the bastards under my wheels or having a pistol equipped with a silencer so that I could just pop them and be on my way.<br>
Several years ago three young prostitutes were found murdered behind a motel on one of the main highways leading into the city. They still haven&rsquo;t apprehended anyone as yet. They published pictures of the victims obviously taken in happier times. Heartbreaking to see the smiling faces and to wonder why their lives turned bad.</p>

		<p>I agree with post #4, I&rsquo;d like to see their heads on a pike.  There is something awfully wrong with Pakistanis.  This is their normal MO it seems, when they&rsquo;re not busy blowing up trains and buses.  What a pathetic state of affairs when we have become so weak that these vile freaks are our neighbours.  These beasts are frightening, born on British soil but will never be British.  A good friend of mine has recentley moved from England to Australia because his daughter is due to begin school.  He didnt want her gooing into the school system because of issues such as this.  When I said everyone hates muslim pakis he blew his top.  Accusations of racism etc directed at me!  As anyone with half a brain knows we all make discrimminating decsions everyday.  When I told him that he really had no argument, another libtard hypocrite.</p>

		<p>I recoil at the thought that a policeman would kill a enraged parent who wanted to take one of these animals out as he entered the courtroom. <br>
White people here need to begin disrupting court proceedings just as the Afros do. Pack the court and start disturbances. Blacks do it all the time. I&rsquo;ve seen it first hand. <br>
Some day Whites are going to remove their gloves and take care of business.<br>
I can&rsquo;t stop thinking about Gary Christian and his wife sitting in that courtroom and having to listen to the details of what Channon suffered at the hands of those dogs. </p>

		<p>I Think that this has gone beyond discussion and really calls for action. This is getting more and more dangerous. If we are to survive as a people we&rsquo;ve got to do something. We&rsquo;ve got to generate solidarity among all Caucasians in the world and to start promoting our interests and our own safety. The people whom we elect couldn&rsquo;t care less about us. <br>
The elephant in the room is the racial situation and by that I mean Black vs. White. Until that is resolved there will be no peace for any White people ( Jew, Christian, Atheist)and civilized non- Whites. Another poster here has compared us to the plains animals of Africa like the Wildebeest who watch as the predators take our one of our own and once the kill is made we go back to &#8220;grazing&#8221; in front of our TV sports and reality shows, thankful that it wasn&rsquo;t us or OUR son or daughter at least THIS time. This time it was Channon &amp; Christopher, next time it was Eve then Lauren but when does OUR number come up?<br>
In the rivers of Africa, the Nile Crocodile is the chief predator who can propel himself out of the water and drag the drinking Wildebeest, Impala or Eland into the water and drown it before devouring it. His supremacy is unchallenged except for the Hippopatamus. The croc will swim a wide arc around the Hippo knowing that the Hippo&rsquo;s massive tusks and teeth can bite him competely in half.<br>
We need to be the Hippo. We are at War but many of us haven&rsquo;t figured it out yet or we feel that it&rsquo;s someone else&rsquo;s problem. How many of us spend or spent endless nights anguishing because our daughter or son was out for the evening and the relief you felt when they entered the door or called you to say that they were home? We feared either an auto accident or violence perpetrated against them. Gary Christian will always remember the last words that his  daughter spoke to him that night she left her house for the last time and he&rsquo;ll be forever haunted as will the Newsomes by the details of the torture that they endured and by the knowledge that the beasts who did it will never pay in blood for what they did.<br>

The oldest victim was 18 but most were aged between 14 and 16.&#8221;</p>
<p>All the details haven&rsquo;t been included in this heavily sanitised version of the truth, but I believe the fact that 95 out of 100 victims were young white girls mean it&rsquo;s a certainty that these Muslim paedophiles CHOSE young white girls. Also at least one of the girls testified that the men referred to her by the term &#8220;gori&#8221; - Urdu for &#8220;young white female&#8221;, surely reminiscent of the days of Islam&rsquo;s white slavery. So much for the assertion of the police that racism wasn&rsquo;t involved.  </p>
<p>There is a whole network of these Muslim paedophile gangs in Northern England and the most disturbing aspect of this whole despicable episode is the undeniable fact that these troubled young girls were badly let down by the authorities who over years refused to listen to frantic parents who were continually brushed off by the politically-correct police &amp; social services who did not want to investigate a Pakistani Muslim paedophile ring for fear of opening up a whole new can of worms &amp; risk  exacerbating racial tensions. The depth that the Marxist/globalist political Establishment will stoop to to preserve their multicultural hold over the British people became clear when British National Party leader Nick Griffin also received the brush-off from the authorities when acting on behalf of some of the parents. In fact a year or two later Nick Griffin was vilified in the controlled media &amp; taken to court for a statement he made at a private BNP function in which he stated (filmed in secret by an undercover reporter of the pro-Establishment BBC) that there were Muslim paedophile gangs grooming under-age white girls in towns in Northern England. But knowing Nick Griffin &amp; the BNP would fight their corrupt system to the end the authorities were at last forced to act &amp; an Establishment female MP quickly sprung into action taking up the case of these poor abused girls as the wheels of justice at last began to turn. </p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not all bad news from politically-correct UK as everyone you talk with now seems to be saying that they don&rsquo;t believe a word that any politician says. These Marxists/globalists can&rsquo;t much longer keep the lid on the boiling kettle that is the multicultural EU(SSR)Federal Superstate they have forced upon the unsuspecting people. One day soon the whole rotten EU edifice is going to blow and brother will their be serious trouble.</p>

		<p>I am a devout, never-been-afraid Christian all my life, and there can never, ever be an excuse, or valid reasoning, for sexual violence against minors, or any female.  Not even religions.  </p>
<p>I am not upset that the politically correct media is calling them &#8220;Asian gangs&#8221; I am only upset that they ruined the girls&rsquo; lives permanently.  </p>
<p>I am simply bewildered&hellip;  what kind of mentally handicapped people feel sexual attraction from girls below the age of 13?  As for me, I only feel sexual attraction from women whose bodies are fully developed and have distinct feminine characteristics.   </p>
<p>Men in 20s<br>
Men in 30s or older<br>
Females below the age of 19<br>
Boys<br>
Common domestic animals such as dogs and cats</p>
<p>They all look the same to me when it comes to sexual attraction.  I might recognize the beauty of a young eleven year old girl&rsquo;s face or her hair, but I just can&rsquo;t feel any sexual attraction from young girls around that age.  I just don&rsquo;t get it.  </p>
<p>(Another thing I sometimes get annoyed with&hellip;  &#8220;Korean&#8221; and &#8220;Koran&#8221; sound so similar and look so similar dayum.)</p>
<p>I read once, that sexual violence is sometimes caused by not only the sexual desire, but also the desire to strictly ruin the victims&rsquo; lives and remind their dominance over them.  I know, that&rsquo;s nothing short of retarded.  and Koran does clearly state that any female not wearing the burka is a prostitute and it is not the perpetrator&rsquo;s fault if a woman without a burka is raped&hellip;. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s precisely one of the reasons why I hate the muslim&rsquo;s teachings, and can never understand why many Western countries are so protective of the muslims in their countries, even when their own young native Western women&rsquo;s lives are destroyed in the hands of the immigrant muslims. </p>
