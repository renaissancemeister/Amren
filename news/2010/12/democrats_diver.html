<h1>Democrats&rsquo; Diversity Problem</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Josh Kraushaar, National Journal, November 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Of the 75 black, Hispanic, and Asian-American Democrats in Congress and governorships, only nine represent majority-white constituencies  &mdash;  and that declines to six in 2011. Two of the party&rsquo;s rising black stars who sought statewide office this year were rejected by their party&rsquo;s own base. And when you only look at members of Congress or governors elected by majority-white constituencies (in other words, most of the governorships and Senate seats, and 337 out of 435 House seats), Democrats trail Republicans in minority representation.</p>
<p>In fact, Republicans experienced a diversity boomlet this year. Cognizant of their stuffy national image, party leaders made a concerted effort to recruit a more diverse crop of candidates. That resulted in more than doubling the number of minority elected officials from six to 13  &mdash;  and a ten-fold increase (from one to 10) in the number of minorities representing majority-white constituencies.</p>
<p>{snip} The vast majority of black and Hispanic members hail from urban districts that don&rsquo;t require crossover votes to win, or represent seats designed to elect minorities. They are more liberal than the average Democrat, no less the average voter, making it more difficult to run statewide campaigns.</p>
<p>These are far from trivial facts. This means Democrats lack a bench of minority candidates who can run for statewide office, no less national office. Most Democratic minorities make a career in the House, accruing seniority and influence but lacking broad-based political support.</p>
<p>The prime culprit in preventing minorities from having broader appeal is the process of gerrymandering majority-minority seats. It has guaranteed blacks and Hispanics representation, but at the cost of creating seats where candidates would have to appeal to a broader constituency, white and non-white alike. For decades, such districts were judicially mandated; in the South, officials still need clearance from the Justice Department to decrease the proportion of blacks voters in a district.</p>
<p>The logic behind gerrymandering stems from the Civil Rights era, when white voters were highly unlikely to vote for African-American candidates, so districts needed to be drawn so black voters could elect their own to Congress. It was effective  &mdash;  and necessary  &mdash;  to bring diversity to a homogeneous body. But now, the consequence of these contortions comes at great expense to Democrats and civil rights leaders alike.</p>
<p>The increase in minority representation comes at the cost of electing more moderate minorities best-positioned to win statewide. And by concentrating so many Democrats in one single district, it also protects neighboring Republicans  &mdash;  a major reason why Republicans often are behind some of the most contorted gerrymandering plans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The obstacle for many black Democrats, Davis [Rep. Artur Davis, D-Ala.] argued, is liberalism, not race.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meanwhile, talented black House Democrats looking to broaden their horizons have hit roadblocks  &mdash;  not from voters, but from party leaders and activists. Davis ran as a moderate in his bid for governor of Alabama, avoiding racial appeals and distancing himself from the Obama administration&rsquo;s policies. He didn&rsquo;t even get out of the gubernatorial primary, rejected by both black leaders for not toeing the party line and party activists, many of whom backed his more-liberal, white primary opponent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In an interview, Davis put the reality for his party bluntly: If black leaders don&rsquo;t broaden their appeal, there will be a permanent ceiling for them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The only kind of black candidate who can win outside of a state like Massachusetts or New York is one who can win significant support from white, independent voters.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The GOP success this year in electing minority leaders who can appeal to a wide cross-section of voters should serve as a wake-up call to Democrats, who are accustomed to carrying the mantle of diversity. If Democrats don&rsquo;t address their own challenges recruiting minority candidates with widespread appeal, the rise of Obama could be more the exception than the rule.<br>

		<p>I agree with the race gerrymandered districts, because it limits Democrat power.  However, on top of that, we need Congressional term limits, because with these race gerrymanders, it means that a given black and Hispanic congress(wo)man can pile up seniority easily and therefore run committees and subcommittees when the Democrats have control of the House.  And once they do that, they can ram affirmative action down our throats in a big way.  For example, Bill Clay Sr., from St. Louis, was Chairman of the Post Office Subcommittee for the last handful of years the Democrats ran the House before the 1994 red wave.  Clay used that position to force the Post Office to essentially become an employment agency for blacks.  </p>
<p>Term limits would have the disparate (or rather, not so disparate) impact of limiting black power and influence in the House.</p>

		<p>How many white people are going to use this to wag their fingers at other white people for not electing more non-white people?  Wagging your finger is pushing for more &#8220;diversity&#8221; (no more white people).  People only talk about &#8220;diversity&#8221; in white areas.  You don&rsquo;t hear any other group being told to racially diversify.  95 out of 100 times black people bring corruption to public office, usually that means stealing money from the tax payers.  If you pay taxes you obviously don&rsquo;t want your hard earned money going to some crooked politician.  Latinos usually push for more immigration which means more people to leach off public benefits and infrastructure.  Asians push for more immigration as well but they focus on &#8220;high-skilled&#8221; immigrants which limits immigrants mostly from Asia.  These &#8220;high-skilled&#8221; immigrants like low-skilled immigrants from Latin America have pushed white people out of jobs and has a devastating impact on this country as well as white society&rsquo;s LONG-TERM future.</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t it hillarious that these bean counters on both sides of the aisle always agree with the obvious lie that &#8220;diversity is our strength,&#8221; just as they constantly harp on another lie that says that we&rsquo;re all the same, only skin color is different, and that they feel we should have a &#8220;color blind&#8221; society, then out of the other sides of their mouths they break everything down according to race and dwell on race in nearly everything they do?</p>

		<p>I often read this fascinating website, and I have a few questions that I would like to put to the white nationalists who post here. Is it possible for a race realist white woman who has black female friends, to be welcomed into the white nationalist community, and be comfortable there? Or does one have to give up her black friends, in order to be welcomed into the race realist community?</p>
<p>I was raised in Boise, Idaho, but worked as a Math teacher in a largely black public school in Chicago for 11 years. There is nothing that is more likely to turn a white person into a race realist, than to teach Math in public schools that are largely or mostly black. It seems that the brains of blacks were not designed by evolution to handle Algebra. It is one thing to read about racial differences in IQ, but it is quite a different experience to see and experience first hand, the lack of Math talent among minorities. </p>
<p>Occasionally, I would come across a rare black, often a girl, who was willing to work hard and pester me for extra tutoring after classes. Two of my former black female students did well in high school, and went to college, and they often write to me to tell me of the heartbreak they face from irresponsible and selfish black men.</p>
<p>Most white public school teachers who have taught blacks and hispanics, do not want to see more of them in this country. But when they come across the rare minority student who is smart, well behaved, and responsible, they regard them as rare gems, and become deeply attached to them. My situation is no different. Race realists have to come up with a way of appealing to Middle American whites who want less non-white immigration to America, but who have some sentimental feelings toward that small percentage of racial minorities who are well behaved.</p>

		<p>Poster #2 mentioned something that resonates with me all the time: why are whites the only people who are always being asked to diversify?</p>
<p>We now have whole swaths of the country that are essentially non-white, and they tend to be mono-racial.  One area will by 90% black, another area 90% latino, and another almost all Asian. </p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t the &#8216;diversity is our strength&rsquo; crowd force latinos to live together with Arabs in Dearborn or push to get more black housing in chinatowns or force armenians to live among hmongs?</p>
<p>Why, when they talk about diversity, is it only about moving as many non-whites as possible in traditionally all-white areas (sadly, which used to most of the nation!)? Why isn&rsquo;t it an imperative to get blacks and chinese loving each other?  Why do they say nothing when various non-white races build racially homogenous enclaves and expand them at the expense of other races?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why conservatives and patriots don&rsquo;t take this and run with it?</p>

<p>Gerrymandering regardless of who it benefits or otherwise is an unsound practice. I know the courts mandate these districts be as they are, but it is wrong, generally speaking, across the board, JUST a bad practice.</p>

		<p>The reason non-white politicians are elected in majority white districts is that they embrace white middle-class values. The reason they lose white support in gerrymandered districts is the black politicians openly show their contempt and disdain for white voters. Would you vote for a politician who hates the color of your skin and values of your culture?</p>

		<p>The situation in the South (I went to college in Nashville TN) seems to be shaping up rather nicely. The situation has simply reversed itself from the Reconstruction era - the Democrat party is perceived as being the Black, anti White party - with various Northern carpet bagger (Lib/Marxists) taking the Black side, now in the Black Democrat party. </p>
<p>For over 100 years, White Southerners were Southern Democrats - &#8220;Yellow Dog Democrats&#8221; - they would vote for a Yellow Dog if it was on the Democrat ticket instead of ever voting for the Black Republicans, Black Reconstruction party.</p>
<p>So now, Whites in the South can throw Blacks a few offices in very heavily Black reservations in cities like Memphis, Virginian City, work with Black Dem party hacks to gerrymander districts so Blacks keep their few seats and make sure there are not meddling rich White Lib/mixed race Obama&rsquo;s looking to united all the races, do integration, hold hands and shout &#8220;Yes we can&#8221;.  White Republicans who know control the entire South can mess with traitor, idiot White liberals by forcing them to live under Black racist rule in places that just aren&rsquo;t hip, fun SWPL cities.</p>

<p>Hello Maggie,</p>
<p>First off I don&rsquo;t really identify myself with any movement. I think this website is great and I tend to agree with most of it. I don&rsquo;t really see any hardcore fundamentalist view espoused here, just a free and open exchange of ideas that you can find in few other places. There may be some who will shun you but so what? In the words of the ghetto-Keep it Real, be true to yourself first and foremost.</p>
<p>So my advice would be to just keep an open mind and take what you can from this website, the monthly publication, and the books for sale here.  </p>

<p>Well are you looking for acceptance from race realists or white nationalists?  Not the same thing, you know.  I consider myself a race realist, but not a white nationalist.  I understand that MOST (the key word) non-Asian minorities don&rsquo;t have a chance at real assimilation or success at a high level in this country, due to genetic and cultural realities.  </p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;ve stated on here before and will reiterate that I would vote for Thomas Sowell or Walter Williams were one of these men to run for president.  It&rsquo;s my opinion that these men have a superior grasp of economics and conservative values that trumps any race consideration.  This makes white nationalists sick and they&rsquo;ve said as much in response to me on this site.  That&rsquo;s their right.  I just try to avoid dealing in absolutes because I believe there are few of them in this world, and won&rsquo;t be roped in to seeing a Howard Dean-type elected president simply because the clearly-better alternative was a black man.  </p>
<p>I think a far more pertinent question than how we feel about you is how do your black girlfriends feel about you?  Are you able to have a candid no-holds-barred discussion about the facts of life in America with these women?  Or do you have to mouth politically-correct platitudes in order to remain in the circle?  </p>
<p>What kind of friendship can you have with people if you have to hide a very large part of yourself from them?  I think eventually you&rsquo;ll find you can&rsquo;t reconcile your opinions with your black friends and the issue will work itself out.  But no I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s contradictory.  I know a black guy who works his butt off, pays taxes, hates freeloaders, watches the Military Channel, and votes Republican.  He told me once he wouldn&rsquo;t hire blacks if it were up for him because every black employee he ever managed was horrible.  Basically, he&rsquo;s a race realist, and if the world were going to end tomorrow I&rsquo;d want him helping to defend my family before I&rsquo;d ask one hundred of the limp-wristed metrosexual liberal white men that make up most of the Seattle area.  Like I said, few absolutes.   </p>
<p>I do take issue with your assertion that the message of race realism has to be altered to become more palatable to the squeamish and those who can&rsquo;t throw off the propaganda of multiculturalism.  This is no different or less ridiculous than saying the Republicans have to change their message to be more inclusive of non-whites.  That would just make them the Democrats, no?  These are our positions.  You&rsquo;re either with them or you&rsquo;re not.  </p>

<p>Hello Maggie, No, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s impossible for a White Nationalist to be friendly with blacks. My wife was a nurse in a NYC agency for many years and befriended a few black women and to this day, we send them Christmas cards (they&rsquo;ve moved away).<br>
But, as you know, this won&rsquo;t be the norm. It is also good form to always be polite to blacks. They really appreciate it when you&rsquo;re polite to them (good morning, good evening, etc). Not that they have it in them collectively to repay a kindness or to initiate friendship for the vast majority of blacks. </p>
<p>Having said that, we should understand that in the end, we&rsquo;re going to have to deal harshly with the overall black community. (harshness being the only thing blacks understand and respect obviously). It&rsquo;s just inevitable. Very sad, but inevitable.</p>

    As a secondary school educator and former principal of a minority-majority elementary school, I think I can relate.  The focus is, as it always has been, to accept people for who they are.  There is nothing else that we, or society, can do. <br>
   The mistake many in our country make is the failure to realize that black urban culture (and some other minority cultures as well) is often pathological in its very nature today.  Our nation, and our schools suffer from it.  Liberals and the mainstream media continue to hold that such violent, anti-social and often downright racist attitudes are the result of their being victims.  Hogwash.  <br>
   Your thoughts are very welcome here regardless of who your friends are.  I think you would have many observations that would be of value and should be part of the &#8216;historical record&rsquo; of this wesbite.  Feel free to share, &#8216;unload,&rsquo; or simply comment on current events as you see fit.  <br>
   One simple added observation on my part.  My daughter-in-law is a doctor who was a former Vietnamese boat person; she came to America as a child with only her mother and no possessions except the clothes she was wearing.  Today, my son (also a doctor) and her hold one thing in common   &mdash;   that American is the best nation in the world   &mdash;   especially for minorities. As Lincoln once said, America offers the last best hope for humanity.  Things haven&rsquo;t changed in the last 175 years.  Once others   &mdash;   especially those with the chips on their shoulders   &mdash;  discover that, we&rsquo;ll be better off (and safer!).<br>
  <br>
JB<br>
Ps.  As an educator, you may want to google &#8220;2million minutes&#8221; and show your hight school students the &#8216;trailer.&rsquo;  An hour long interview of the film with many excerpts of this documentary is available at C-SPAN.  I&rsquo;ve found it useful with minority students &hellip; <br>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say hypothetically that I&rsquo;m living in a White homogenous neighborhood that you feel is desirable and you move there yourself.  You start bringing your black friends over and one of them notices another house for sale and they would like to live in the neighborhood as well.  Your black friend moves in and almost immediately the two houses on both sides of this one have sale signs in the yards.  Your black friend calls some of her black friends and they move into these houses causing a chain reaction throughout the entire neighborhood.  The White residents start shrinking dramatically until they are only about 60 percent of the neighborhood and the area starts deteriorating.  People that waited too long can&rsquo;t sell your houses because the property values plummeted and they owe more than the house is worth.  There are no White buyers wanting to move into an ugly transitional neighborhood and the blacks who can afford mortgages would rather live in a Whiter neighborhood.  People are then forced to choose between foreclosure or renting out to section 8ers to escape the neighborhood and that&rsquo;s when the fun really starts.</p>

		<p>This is just my opinion but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible for someone to be a real race realist and have black friends.  Such a person probably would let her black girlfriends fix her up with black men and even if she had objections to it she most likely wouldn&rsquo;t say anything for fear of offending her girlfriends and being called racissss. As anonymous #17 pointed out, if you accept such people your also accepting their associations into your own circle.</p>

<p>Two pieces of advice about dealing with blacks that I have learned from regular AR posters, and have applied to my advantage several times in the recent past:</p>
<p>1.  Act like you&rsquo;re really educated by their (mostly stupid) musings.  Act like whatever they have to say is the most profound thing you&rsquo;ve ever heard in your life.  After they tell you whatever they want to tell you, and you act like it&rsquo;s so profound, write it down (or pretend to) on some piece of paper you might have on you at the time, or compose a text message on your smartphone to yourself, and do it in front of them.  Stroke their egos.</p>
<p>2.  When you get into a relatively minor to moderate conflagration to a black that doesn&rsquo;t rise to a criminal nature, make the matter entirely your fault, as long as your doing so doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re claiming you did something criminal.  This usually keeps the black from going ballistic.  </p>
<p>The danger in both is that you can take it too far and come across as a chump, at which point you&rsquo;ll be easy pickings for real thugs.</p>
