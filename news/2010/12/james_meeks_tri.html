			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Flannery, WFLD-TV (Chicago), December 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On Wednesday, Chicago mayoral candidate James Meeks said that only African-Americans should be able to participate in affirmative action programs  &mdash;  and that Hispanics, Asians, and women should be excluded. Later, he tried to clarify his remarks.</p>
<p>Speaking to a candidates&rsquo; forum Wednesday on black-oriented WVON radio, the South Side state senator said it&rsquo;s unacceptable that the share of city contracts going to African-American-owned businesses has shrunk in recent years.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that the word &#8216;minority,&rsquo; from our standpoint, should mean African-American,&#8221; Meeks said. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t think women, Asians and Hispanics should be able to use that title. That&rsquo;s why our numbers cannot improve, because we use women, Asians and Hispanics, who are not people of color, who are not people who have been discriminated against. We fought for these laws based on discrimination. Now, groups that have not been discriminated against are the chief beneficiaries.&#8221;</p>
<p>State Rep. Monique Davis (D-Chicago) said, {snip} &#8220;White women don&rsquo;t need affirmative action.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sen. Meeks is wrong. White women, like other women, do face discrimination: the same discrimination facing racial minorities,&#8221; said Hedy Ratner, co-president of the Women&rsquo;s Business Development Center.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Later on Wednesday night, Meeks attempted to clarify his earlier statement, and said that he would remove from City Hall affirmative action set-aside only businesses owned by &#8220;white women.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thursday, Meeks&rsquo; campaign released a statement saying in part:</p>
<p>&#8220;Senator Meeks strongly believes all minority and women-owned businesses deserve their fair share of City contract opportunities. But there&rsquo;s no pretending that Chicago has a history of systemic corruption in its minority and women-owned business program and that African-American owned businesses are the most underrepresented among city contractors.&Nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As mayor, he would put an end to the corruption and lack of accountability that has been allowed to go unchecked.&#8221;</p>

Blacks don&rsquo;t share. They take.</p>
<p>If you have one or more black oriented radio stations where you live, I suggest you find out if they have a local call-in talkshow. The comments are revealing.</p>

		<p>Meeks wants to be mayor but does not meet the residency requirements. Meeks says he is eligible as he bought a house for his father in the city [Roseland, where O used to be aqn organizer]. </p>
<p>Women on the police force constitute a &#8220;minority&#8221; for hiring and promotion rules, and this does gall the blacks.</p>

		<p>Meeks is right, of course.  All those programs were created specifically for blacks, now everyone else jumped on the bandwagon.</p>
<p>Now that blacks are losing out to those people, they&rsquo;ve woken up and have realized that the &#8216;white&rsquo; gravy train is in danger of breaking down - due to the heavy burden of white male tax payers subsidizing immigrants from all over the world to the tune of tens of millions.</p>
<p>Blacks know that latinos, if they gain power, will do no favors for black people.  Neither will asians, arabs, turks, armenians, native africans, etc</p>

		<p>No, he was very clear on what he meant, and it&rsquo;s always proven true.  When blacks are in charge, only blacks benefit.  Period.  And, when blacks are in charge, rampant corruption and nepotism usually also reigns.  If you truly study Obama&rsquo;s agenda so far, who really benefited?  Only two groups.  The banks (owned by his invisible backers who own the banks - and who might THAT be?).  And blacks.  Period.  But what about the gay agenda?  What about the abortion agenda?  One might ask.  Well, does anybody remember when and where the first AIDS cases arose, and from whom back in the early 80&rsquo;s?  Started with black Haitians.  Blacks.  Why do you think they accuse Whites of planting the virus in Africa to kill blacks?  Because it STARTED with blacks.  And why might that be?  Because blacks are obsessed with their genitals and seeking instant gratification and they don&rsquo;t much care if that gratification comes from their poker buddy on the down low, a white prostitute, some white homosexual, a horse, a cow or a chicken.  (I do not exaggerate on the animal part by the way.  Remember the black guy here in the US arrested for having sex with horses?  Happens in Africa all the time).   Well what about abortion, you say?  Who do you think is the single largest ethnic group getting abortions?  Blacks.  Why else is Obama trying so hard to make it a benefit in every health plan?  So we can pay for their abortions, also.  Blacks, everywhere, care only for blacks and when in power screw the White man to give even MORE to blacks.  This guy was just speaking the truth to the group he knows will elect him - Chicago&rsquo;s blacks.  Uh, by the way, isn&rsquo;t Obama from Chicago?</p>

		<p>Monique Davis&rsquo;s comment makes it perfectly clear   &mdash;   White women are only good for flexing political muscle to enact affirmative action, but don&rsquo;t actually get any themselves.</p>
<p>As for Rev. Meeks, the latest poll out of Chicago for Mayor is Rahm 32%, Undecided 30%, everybody else including Meeks is in single digits.  All Rahm needs to do is touch his nose with his index finger and walk a straight line, and he&rsquo;s Mayor.</p>

		<p>Much of the media, academia and anybody else who profits from this sort of stuff are awaiting with giddy impatience the day whites become a minority in the USA. At which point, all will be right with the world, which is the impression given by our self-appointed betters. </p>
<p>The usefulness of Meeks&rsquo; statement is that, if he stands by it, and if blacks support him en masse aware he said these things, it will show black-brown relations aren&rsquo;t exactly strong enough to take down the big, bad, white beast.  Of course, most here already knew this or figure this to be well within the bounds of reason.</p>
<p>We worry, with pretty good reason, that mass immigration will cause the GOP to go extinct in time.  One idea nobody seems to consider are splits within the Democratic party.  For example, I have little doubt that somebody like Meeks will bolt for blacker pastures if he believes the Dems are becoming too salsa-flavored for his liking (he&rsquo;s already a supporter of school vouchers, not exactly a common Democrat stance).  Recall recently Latinos openly talking about the formation of a &#8216;Tequila party&rsquo;, and one of the reasons for this is because the Dems supposedly take their votes for granted.</p>

<p>Although I am morally opposed to all forms of affirmative action, including non-racial ones, I&rsquo;d be lying if I said I wasn&rsquo;t enjoying this a little. Now black people can get a small taste of what whitey has to go through every day.</p>
<p>I am a female in a profession that&rsquo;s 97% male, and I take pride in knowing that I got to my position without affirmative action. It&rsquo;s a white thing.</p>

<p>Ah, so as soon as the city had a large enough non-white population, they quickly voted in &#8216;residency&rsquo; requirements as a prerequisite to get a job working for the city? </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t they believe in diveristy? Doesn&rsquo;t every suburb proclaim they are making every effort to embrace diversity, and make things right?</p>
<p>Seems in areas where whites are a small percentage of the population, in schools, neighborhoods, even cities now, it seems in these place they believe in &#8216;diversity&rsquo; too, except for them diversity means giving job favors to and celebrating people just like themselves and feeling no shame at all in excluding others. </p>

<p>Blacks are capable of base cunning, the same as all humans.  The problem is they will not take a look at themselves in light of who they are and the methods they use to fool each other (particularly &#8216;upstanding citizens&rsquo; like Meeks whose SES should indicate a higher degree of mental function) to realize just how helpless, as a population -overall-, they are.</p>
<p>And that ignorance, whether willful or from absent reasoning capacity altogether, prevents them from &#8216;and the next step is&hellip;&rsquo; deducing what happens when you chase whites to such thinness on the ground that they cannot generate the tax base to support you.  And that outcome is this-</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/33q9k64" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/33q9k64</a></p>
<p>&#8216;Nowhere&rsquo;, Kansas, is a virtual location from an animated cartoon but the point is that without whites, in density, blacks become rulers, not of dystopically bankrupt civil organizations.  But of desolate voids of society altogether.</p>
<p>Which is where WHITE reasoning has to be questioned for trusting blacks (or &#8216;the situation&rsquo; itself) to eventually become so blatantly obvious that everybody understands and some form of compromise is reached.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t happen.  If you don&rsquo;t see the past in the present, you won&rsquo;t see the future in progress.  Chicago and Detroit will be indistinguishable as corrupt process driven black social outcomes within 20 years.</p>
<p>Because they cannot do it on their own.  And nobody wants to live with them, their attitudes or their needs, to pay for their passivity.</p>
<p>We must see this and do something for ourselves, because they never will.  Whites are an addiction that blacks despise but will never yield up on their own.</p>

		<p> I am starting to see a common thread among all these types; they willingly call for the elimination or total defeat of the white race and scream racism if any white has the audacity to attempt to stop them in any way.<br>
 The main stream media fully agrees with them; then cannot understand why whites stop listening to them.<br>
 They have so deluded themselves in &#8220;political correctness&#8221; that it inexcusable for anyone to think any other way.<br>
 Until the white race gets over this incredible white guilt complex; this sort of activity will continue and flourish.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right - Asians, Hispanics, and women are not &#8220;people of color&#8221;.  I find it unlikely that any other group would want to be associated with the aggregate behavior of Blacks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, do you know where Black people do not have to suffer from &#8220;discrimination&#8221; from White people?  In Africa.  By all means, move back there if you think White people are so horrible.  You will not be missed.</p>

		<p>Question Diversity is correct that &#8220;white&#8221; women are used to fight for Affirmative Action without getting any benefit.  Qualified white women are not in short supply in today&rsquo;s economy.  In fact, it in is predominately and traditionally female fields, such as health care, that there are still some jobs available.</p>
<p>I am a critical care nurse who would rather work with the white men entering the field than most black women any day.  A white man will generally help out with a patient which isn&rsquo;t his because he knows that he might need my help ten minutes from now.  I have worked with a few really good black nurses, but many act as though it is an act of racism for a bedridden patient to throw up in his bed, as if the sick and now embarrassed patient did it just to make them do an unpleasant chore that those of us busy with other patients should take care of for them.    </p>

		<p>Thanks for the link, #1 - it was perfectly disgusting.  And what was that jerky little dance he was doing, like he was high on crystal???  Wow, has anybody besides me ever noticed that blacks NEVER take the steps necessary to improve their own conditions in their own areas and even in their own lives?  Nope - they always stand around blaming whites and DEMANDING help - a clear admission that they are incapable of handling any adversity, which is a part of life for everybody.  And if they&rsquo;re incapable, how is it they expect others to pay their freight?  Isn&rsquo;t it time for them to do what it takes to GET capable and quit whining about their sorry state - and improve it themselves???</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how they can slither around with their arguments, using whatever will serve them best at the moment.</p>
<p>When they want to boost their numbers and hence their strength,  they claim that everyone who isn&rsquo;t white is a &#8220;person of color&#8221;. But when they have to divide up the spoils they have won, then they claim that only blacks are people of color.  What a joke!</p>
<p>Even the NAACP has resisted changing its name, because they claim to represent ALL &#8220;colored people&#8221;&hellip; (everyone other than white).</p>

		<p>The bottom line is Affirmative Action MUST end. And Mr. Meeks is completely delusional to only believe that &ldquo;people of color&rdquo; or black people are the only people discriminated against in today&rsquo;s society.</p>
<p>Being a New Yorker and living in the center of the world, I&rsquo;ve seen things that no one would believe. But it just simply amazes me how everyone else from other parts of the world can come to this country, pick themselves up (with little or no help) and live the American dream. And yet, blacks, with all the programs, help etc&hellip;specifically made for blacks, still remain at the bottom of the barrel. </p>
<p>I guess it shouldn&rsquo;t be all that surprising when you look at the fact that, a black ancestor or &ldquo;slave&rdquo; was sold for as little as a nickel or a bottle of rum.</p>
