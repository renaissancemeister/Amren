			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Susan Carroll, Houston Chronicle, December 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It&rsquo;s a potentially explosive idea being circulated on petitions in Houston&rsquo;s Latino supermarkets, lobbied for in Chicago&rsquo;s Hispanic neighborhoods and now is landing on the front pages of the Spanish-language press.</p>
<p>With more than 30,000 dead in the last four years from drug violence in Mexico, some immigrant advocates are starting to lobby the U.S. government to grant millions of illegal immigrants from Mexico &#8220;Temporary Protected Status,&#8221; a kind of temporary reprieve from deportation generally reserved for countries ravaged by natural disasters or destabilized by war.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a big chance of getting kidnapped and killed over there right now. It is extremely, extremely violent,&#8221; said Victor Ibarra, the president of the Houston advocacy organization Alianza Mexicana. &#8220;That is why we&rsquo;re asking for temporary protection.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the idea, which would require the approval of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, is highly controversial and, many say, unlikely to happen in the foreseeable future. Matthew Chandler, a DHS spokesman, said DHS is not considering TPS for Mexican nationals.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Haitians granted TPA</b></p>
<p>Temporary protected status gives people the opportunity to live and work legally here but offers no path toward a green card or citizenship. The U.S. government granted TPS to Salvadorans after two massive earthquakes in 2001 killed 1,200 people. After Hurricane Mitch in 1998, Nicaraguans and Hondurans were also offered the special status. In January, Napolitano granted Haitians TPS in response to the earthquakes there.</p>
<p>Supporters of the idea of granting TPS to Mexicans say it would offer much-needed protection to people who have fled violence south of the border, but do not have viable asylum cases, which typically require that applicants face persecution in their home countries for specific reasons such as their race, religion or membership in a particular social group.</p>

		<p>Ah, we shouldn&rsquo;t deport illegals because Mexico is too violent? Too bad, so sad.  Maybe they should drop their violent, poor, criminal culture and speak English once they arrive here.  Perhaps, they can fix the problems in their own country instead of recreating them here</p>

<p>No it doesn&rsquo;t.  ALL drugs have potentially severe epigenetic effects which can promulgate through generations as DNA is damaged via histone strand disruption, literally screwing up the zip files by which your DNA is stored at 15,000:1 packing densities.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no excuse for exporting these drugs to ANY nation and pretending otherwise is endorsing evil.</p>
<p>That includes the &#8216;harmless&rsquo; cannibinoids of marijuana btw.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
It is the U.S. that forces the War on Some Drugs down the throat of the rest of the world, including Mexico. If those drugs were legal, people wouldn&rsquo;t be killing each other for them.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Let them be legal in Mexico, I care not how much further they degrade themselves.  The reality is that if the U.S. was not a target for this stuff, they wouldn&rsquo;t be making it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Furthermore, &ldquo;free trade&rdquo; agreements have crippled the Mexican economy by flooding it with cheap U.S. corn.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>And &#8216;World Trade&rsquo; takes massive consignments of U.S. virgin timber and forces unfit products down our own throats (literally, _fluoride_ which is already hyperdangerous now has a melanine filler/binder agent association with it.  Several Eastern Sea Board states having refused to pay for Chinese &#8216;fluoridation&rsquo; chemicals when the gunk bound up their plant impellers).</p>
<p>The difference between drugs and corn is that eating a high carb diet keeps you from starving and lets your kids grow up to achieve whatever IQ potential they might have without malnutrition issues.</p>
<p>Drugs just kill.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
This made the drug trade all the more attractive for many young Mexicans. So there is plenty of blame to go around in this case.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a thought: hyperspectral sensors on UAVs that loiter for tens of hours if not blimps which loiter for tens of days.  Find the plants and wait for someone to come tend them.  And then kill them all with an EB Hellfire to the forehead.</p>
<p>What people DO NOT SEEM TO REALIZE is that we don&rsquo;t have to save or be kind to everyone to be decent to ourselves and survivable as a species.  And some we should be flat out executing with extreme prejudice.</p>
<p>That includes every variety of illicit drug dealer known to man.</p>
<p>IF the U.S. wasn&rsquo;t making a HUGE profit from this as both &#8216;law enforcement&rsquo; paranoia and literal commerce effort, it wouldn&rsquo;t take more than a few weeks to end this &#8216;drug war&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And everyone knows it.</p>
<p>Start by making growing, smuggling and dealing a death penalty offense.  No questions asked.</p>
<p>People will get the picture, right fast.</p>

So there is plenty of blame to go around in this case.&#8221;</p>
<p>I usually agree with you, but I think you are completely wrong here.  First, drug use is destructive to any group of people who use, all drugs, including marijuana.  Legal drugs already have a harmful effect on the population due to their overperscription, and side effects.  Adding a class of drugs that only exist for recreation is only what a declining culture would do.  The War on Drugs wasn&rsquo;t forced down Mexico&rsquo;s throat.  We couldn&rsquo;t get either Fox nor Calderon to do much beyond token action.  Mexico did not cooperate very well with requests to suppress drug trade in Mexico and it ended up threatening the Mexican government itself.  Now their government could become a narco state, period.  This has nothing to do with the U.S. policies. </p>
<p>Blame does lie with America, but only in its appetite for drugs.  Discipline could end that (but easier said than done).  Nancy Reagan&rsquo;s program, &#8220;Just Say No&#8221; was a good idea and did have some impact. However, it was allowed to fade out.  It is liberalism and the libertinism that comes with it that is the problem and what is to blame. And the more one smokes pot, the easier it is for them to rationalize themselves into liberalism, (i.E. socialism).</p>
<p>If drugs were legal, there would still be a black market for several reasons. One reason is that the carttels exist now and they will not be paying taxes or handing over their operations to anyone.  The vast black market in the Balkans in just cigarette smuggling is a good example of how a legal substance still supports a black market and crime.  Cigarette smuggling online has emerged in the U.S.  Tuned out that the cigarettes were harmful because of the way they were being made.  People were scammed because they gave credit card info online to avoid paying State taxes on their tobacco habit.  All sorts of counterfeiting of goods goes on in the world where black markets have been long established.  Legal drugs would simply enlarge and expand black market practices in North America.  The set up is certainly being established since we are filling the country with people from well established black market nations.  Many ended up having their cards charged excessively as the operations moved around or eventually closed when it became known that the cigarettes themselves were of poor quality.  Legalizing use will only encourage the suppliers, and that will require more enforcement, like the revenuers who used to search out illegal stills simply because it was tax evasion.  It won&rsquo;t end the drug war in Mexico because it is not over who gets to use it, but who gets the money from sales.  It is no different than the American mafia struggles of the 20s, and 30s, except that an open series of battles are taking place and local and even federal government has little or no power to act.  But since it was more complicated to produce alcohol than say, grow marijauna, which is a weed that a child can grow, no speical equipment or knowledge is required.  </p>
<p>Legalization would also send an unintentional signal to the young and the careless that the government endorses using, since it made it legal.  This will cause more social problems, which are legion and include crime, violent and otherwise, increased driving mishaps and deaths, Lax parenting, with increased maternity issues and hazards, a general drop even further in education anc achievement.  It sets up the trend of population replacement that is already occurring because Asian and Indian populations who remain sober and work will naturally take over the real functional activities, with Hispanics filling in the lower labor needs.  This is happening while Americans grow less and less able to compete, due to a rising drug culture, and unrealistic expectations of younger whites of an easy life.  Most young whites have come to expect a lifestyle similar to the European one, regardless of current economic crises.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also wrong about the corn.  Last I noticed Mexicans were complaining that the price of U.S. corn went up because it is being used for biofuel production in the U.S.  I buy feed corn and I can tell you that it is a lot more expensive than it used to be.  Mexicans use corn tortillas as their stable along with pinto beans.  The president of Mexico complained formally two or three years ago, I think, about expensive corn.  American farms have responded by attempting to produce more corn, but it hasn&rsquo;t lowered the price yet.</p>

		<p>In response to jewamongyou.  I agree that by making these psychoactive drugs illegal a massive illicit and violent trade is created of a substances with inflated values.   I however also suggest that the failure to properly secure the border has facilitated physical routes into the US and the growth of this industry in both countries.  Not only that: the large population of illegal and legalised illegal immigrants within the USA, many without means,  has helped enlarge the gang culture needed at the US end for distribution (and use.)  It&rsquo;s clearly a multifaced issue.</p>

		<p>There are 112 million Mexicans south of the border.  Any protected status given to one Mexican would have to apply to all of them.</p>
<p>Because peace, order and good government will never happen in Mexico, &#8216;protected status&rsquo; would be open-ended, meaning they could stay forever.</p>
<p>Because they can&rsquo;t live in refugee camps, they would disperse around the country, putting down roots and having families.</p>
<p>In practice, it would be like Mexico annexing the United States.  <br>

		<p>4 Whiteplight:</p>
<p>I think legalizing would have just the opposite effect   &mdash;   Young people would use drugs less.  The whole forbidden fruit syndrome.  The best idea is to require smoking weed and ban broccoli.</p>
<p>Glenn Spencer over at American Patrol thinks that the increased drug gang violence in Mexico is a result of there being fewer and fewer easy entrance points into the United States from Mexico, and that the drug gangs are all banging each other for those increasingly fewer easy routes.  He also thinks that American military intervention would be a bad idea because it would eventually beget continental unification (&#8220;North American Union.&#8221;).  His suspicion in that stead is the same as mine   &mdash;   Texas Governor Rick Perry is the most gung-ho for military intervention in Mexico, yet he&rsquo;s as open borders and pro-amnesty as they come.  So it must be that military invasion will only help the open borders cause somehow.  Too, so many of our soldiers are Mexican, and some secretly allied with one drug gang or another, that if you actually call on them to go on the ground in Mexico, that they&rsquo;ll do everything to help their gang, i.e. kill rival gangsters or frag white American soldiers, that it wouldn&rsquo;t do any good anyway.    </p>
<p>As for the subject matter at hand, Vincente Fox said it best:  &#8220;Where there is a Mexican, there is Mexico.&#8221;  Bringing Mexicans here will eventually (if not instantly) bring Mexico&rsquo;s problems here, including kidnapping and violence, because Mexico&rsquo;s problems are a direct result of Mexico&rsquo;s Mexicans, not Mexico&rsquo;s topography or latitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait, so explain to me how these violent, illiterate, and anti-White peasant mestizos magically transform into Rhodes Scholars and nuclear physicists when they cross the Southern border.

		<p>The pro-illegal advocates will do anything to get their way, just as the gay agenda people will.  If Congress won&rsquo;t pass laws in their favor, they go to the courts, the President, and the lawmakers of cities and states.  If a state, like CA, passes even an amendment, they challenge it as being unconstitutional.  Every measure is taken to get around the will of the people.  They beg Obama to institute executive orders and don&rsquo;t care whether such decrees are enforceable or not.  If he doesn&rsquo;t bend to their every whim, they threaten primary challenges, new parties, or violence in the streets.  Now, they&rsquo;re getting frantic as a majority-GOP House closes in on them.</p>

		<p>QD:  Alcohol IS legal.  Has it&rsquo;s legality lessened it&rsquo;s use?  Especially among the young (such as HS and college kids)?  NO it has NOT.  In fact, they aren&rsquo;t content with just imbibing.  They BINGE drink.</p>
<p>Tobacco is legal (though harassed and taxed at all levels prohibitively).  Has THAT lessened its use among the young?  NO it has NOT.  In fact, the anti-tobacco crowd is very concerned that tobacco use is RISING in the younger demographics, in spite of heavy taxes and constant propaganda against smoking.  One wonders, by the way, what would happen if ALL smokers quit instantly sometime in 2011?  You can BET the states and federal agencies who rely on tobacco taxes to fill their coffers will NOT reduce their expenditures.  They will just think of another way to replace the income derived by some other means.  For the Pols, it&rsquo;s all about the tax, and not about really wanting folks to quit.</p>
<p>Bottom line is, legalization of drugs is usually ONLY called for by DRUG USERS.  The rest of us know legalization would do nothing toward curbing illicit use, production, and sale of drugs.  Such an industry exists for prescription drugs that ARE legal.  What legalization WOULD do is hasten the destruction of our youth and others, while doing nothing to curb it&rsquo;s illicit production and use, nor curb gang activity.</p>
<p>I frankly hold suspect anybody who calls for &#8220;legalization of drugs&#8221;.  My first thought is, &#8220;he&rsquo;s a drug user or in to the drug culture&#8221;.</p>

<p>Ever hear of the drinking age?  Do you not see or hear every PSA about the &#8220;wrongs&#8221; of &#8220;underage drinking?&#8221;  As if the age of twenty-one turns you into a Saint.  The more the system complains about &#8220;underage drinking,&#8221; the more of it there will be.</p>
<p><i>In fact, the anti-tobacco crowd is very concerned that tobacco use is RISING in the younger demographics, in spite of heavy taxes and constant propaganda against smoking.</i></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rising BECAUSE of their constant propaganda against smoking.</p>
<p>While you say that tobacco is technically still legal, you then rightly follow it up with the implication that smoking has become quasi-criminal.</p>
<p><i>Bottom line is, legalization of drugs is usually ONLY called for by DRUG USERS.</i></p>
<p>And noted dopeheads like Ron Paul, former New Mexico Gov. Bill Johnson&hellip;</p>
<p>I want to go back to something Whiteplight said in 4:</p>
<p><i>Legalization would also send an unintentional signal to the young and the careless that the government endorses using, since it made it legal.</i></p>
<p>I count any number of substances in my house that I could get high on and do major damage to my brain by so doing, yet the fact that I can buy them legally right now, and was able to when I was 12 years old, and (save the cans of compressed air for cleaning computer parts) can still do so now if I were 12 years old, didn&rsquo;t induce me to sniff fabric softener, drink window washing fluid, snort the chemicals from a can of furniture polish, or extract an intoxicant from nutmeg.  Too, when I was in college, weed was legal for all intents and purposes within the campus confines, yet that didn&rsquo;t mean I was going to start smoking weed, because I know it would cause permanent and irreparable neurological damage.  So if I figured this out, why can&rsquo;t everyone else?  </p>
<p>Yes, these sorts of drugs are dangerous.  But a big government nanny state is even more dangerous.  FYI, Bill R, even as I say and think all these things, I don&rsquo;t think full legalization is the best paradigm.  In my ideal world, I ignore the users and persecute the dealers, and, as a former Federal courts bailiff once suggested, we establish a line of demarcation   &mdash;   Any drug more &#8220;dangerous&#8221; than it remains in exclusive Federal jurisdiction, any less is a state option.</p>

		<p><i>Bottom line is, legalization of drugs is usually ONLY called for by DRUG USERS.</i> </p>
<p>I believe drugs should be legalized and I do not use drugs.  </p>
<p>There are many sane, rational, intelligent, non-drug using Americans calling for an end to the government&rsquo;s insane War on Drugs.  </p>
<p>The growing Libertarian Party&rsquo;s platform states: <i> We favor the repeal of all laws creating &#8216;crimes&rsquo; without victims, such as the use of drugs for medicinal or recreational purposes.</i></p>
<p>As of 2009, 146 Libertarians held elected offices in the US.  The Libertarian Cato Institute, a public policy research organization/think tank supports legalizing drugs.</p>

<p>Do you believe we have won the (almost) 40-year War on Drugs?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Has the government&rsquo;s 40-year War on Drugs lessened or stopped the tremendous demand for drugs?</p>
<p>Prohibited activities spawn Black Markets run by those willing to risk getting caught and sent to jail.  Black Markets are the province of gangsters.  Gangs compete with one another via open warfare and the more the government cracks down, the more the drug business becomes dominated by the most brutal elements of society.</p>
<p>I am a high school teacher and drugs are rampant on school campuses, cheaper than ever, readily available 24/7.  Kids, including those in elementary school, can get all the illegal drugs they want quickly and easily, more potent than ever.  No matter how aggressively and oppressively the Drug Warriors fight their war, the drug trade continues unabated.</p>
<p>Prescription drugs are not sold OTC but because of the government&rsquo;s futile War on Drugs, &#8220;robotripping&#8221; and Purple Drank, I now have to ask at the pharmacy, show my driver&rsquo;s license and SIGN my name for certain formerly OTC cough syrups. </p>
<p><i>The rest of us know legalization would do nothing toward curbing illicit use, production, and sale of drugs. Such an industry exists for prescription drugs that ARE legal. What legalization WOULD do is hasten the destruction of our youth and others, while doing nothing to curb its illicit production and use, nor curb gang activity.</i></p>
<p>If drugs were legal, do you believe those desiring drugs would buy drugs of unknown, toxic or dangerous origin from a dealer on the street or drugs from  drug stores produced by legitimate pharmaceutical companies? </p>
<p>Do you believe that ending the Drug War would result in tens of thousands of addicts and children trying drugs? <i>That&rsquo;s what we have now.</i></p>
<p>Prohibition did not work against alcohol, the the same way it&rsquo;s not working against drugs:</p>
<p><i>Prohibition finally ended in 1933. The Noble Experiment had lasted 13 years. Many people died, and a few became very wealthy. But Prohibition hadn&rsquo;t made America an alcohol-free zone. It hadn&rsquo;t even come close to doing so.  Alcohol Prohibition triggered the worst crime wave in the nation&rsquo;s history.</i></p>
<p><i>Even though Prohibition ended in the middle of the Great Depression of the 1930s, the crime rate began falling immediately. And it continued downward for 30 years.</i></p>

<p>When Alcohol Prohibition was finally repealed in 1933, America did not become a nation of alcoholics.</p>
<p>Bon</p>
<p>Drug Warriors  &mdash;  inside and outside of government  &mdash;  believe your Constitutional Rights are a small price to pay for the victory they promise is coming.</p>

		<p>I do not use nicotine or alcohol.  The most mind altering drug I take is caffeine.  But I still support legalizing at least those drugs that have little addictive power, including marijuana, psilocybin, and mescaline.  (All of these drugs are less addictive than alcohol and far less addictive than nicotine.)  I don&rsquo;t advocate their use, I just don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s worth my tax dollars to lock up people who do use them, nor do I like the assaults on my civil rights that are carried out in the name of the War on Drugs.  Remember that before terrorism provided our politicians with the perfect excuse to throw away the Bill of Rights and take away our privacy the drug war was doing much the same thing.  However, and here is where I part company with the leftists, people who use drugs should pay the full cost.  Employers should have no obligation to provide addicts with treatment, they can just fire them.  Any publicly funded drug treatment centers must be 100% funded with taxes on the drugs.</p>
<p><br>
But with or without any war on drugs illegal aliens will find some excuse to stay here.  As for NAFTA, it was supposed to stop illegal immigration by causing factories to be built in Mexico so the Mexicans wouldn&rsquo;t have to move here.  Now we are told that it flooded Mexico with cheap corn so Mexican peasants had to move here.  In other words, not having NAFTA causes illegal immigration, and having NAFTA causes illegal immigration.  I think that illegal immigrants cause illegal immigration.<br>
