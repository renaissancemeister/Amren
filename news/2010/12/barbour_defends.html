<h1>Barbour Defends Comments on Race, But Is the Damage Done to His Potential 2012 Bid?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Holly Bailey, Yahoo News!, December 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On Tuesday, the Mississippi governor sought to clarify his remarks to the Weekly Standard&rsquo;s Andrew Ferguson about growing up at the height of the civil rights movement in Mississippi.</p>
<p>{snip}<br>
The governor went on to credit the Citizens Council, a group that has been viewed as pro-segregationist, for helping to integrate his hometown more peacefully than other cities in the Deep South were integrated.</p>
<p>After a public outcry, Barbour clarified his remarks Tuesday, insisting he wasn&rsquo;t endorsing the group&rsquo;s views generally. &#8220;My point was my town rejected the Ku Klux Klan, but nobody should construe that to mean I think the town leadership were saints, either,&#8221; Barbour said in a statement. &#8220;Their vehicle, called the &#8216;Citizens Council,&rsquo; is totally indefensible, as is segregation.&#8221;</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not likely to quiet Barbour&rsquo;s critics. On Monday, Democrats seized on the governor&rsquo;s comments, as well as his recollection of attending a Martin Luther King Jr. rally when he was a teenager. Barbour admitted that he spent more time &#8220;watching the girls&#8221; than listening to the civil rights icon.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;s not ready for prime time or not ready for the 21st century  &mdash;  either way it&rsquo;s disqualifying,&#8221; Democratic National Committee spokesman Hari Sevugan said in a message on Twitter.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, Politico&rsquo;s Ben Smith dug up a quote from a Barbour profile in the New York Times from 1982 in which Barbour warned an aide about making racist remarks with a questionable statement of his own. According to the Times, Barbour &#8220;warned that if the aide persisted in racist remarks, he would be reincarnated as a watermelon and placed at the mercy of blacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an item Tuesday, the National Review&rsquo;s Jim Geraghty argues that Barbour&rsquo;s remarks to the Weekly Standard might not by themselves make him &#8220;unelectable&#8221; but that a pattern of insensitive comments along with the idea that he was &#8220;oblivious&#8221; to the suffering of others might.</p>

		<p>For some odd reason, perhaps temporary insanity, I was watching the Morning Schmuck/Daily Rubdown on MSNBC a few mornings ago.  Or maybe it was Inspired Guidance, because the pseudo-Republican host and his kook leftist choir were discussing the Barbour issue at the time I turned MSNBC on.  One of the women on the panel said that Barbour couldn&rsquo;t win those all important white suburban moms in Philadelphia as opposed to Obama because Barbour said something nice about &#8220;White Citizens Councils,&#8221; which of course was NOT the real name of the organization in question.</p>
<p>My reaction?  Why are these white suburban moms living in the suburbs of Philadelphia and not Philadelphia itself?  Answer:  Black crime.  So you really expect them to run away from Haley Barbour and into the hands of Barack Obama, whose election lit the ghettos of Philly on fire?</p>
<p>My other more fundamental question is this:  Who died and left white suburban mothers in Philadelphia King?  I highly doubt the framers of the documents forged in that city had that sort of thing in mind.  However, thanks to the two political parties being so much alike, especially in the realm of Presidential politics, recent Presidential elections are decided by suburban women in swing states.</p>

		<p>Barbour is guilty of 1. talking while White, and 2. while talking while White, he failed to say how regretful we are that there was a sad and shameful chapter in our history when Whites didn&rsquo;t fully embrace Diversity.</p>
<p>For his being a White Republican politician, we are shocked that he allowed himself to get caught for talking while White.  We assume that blacks in Mississippi are so annoying that even politicians there can&rsquo;t help but speak rightly White on occasion.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of those &#8220;heretics&#8221; (doomed for destruction) in the middle-ages who thought that the son was not really consubstantiate, triumverate, and eternal with the father and the holy ghost.</p>
<p>Or was it that the holy ghost was coneternal and substantiate, but not triumverate?</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>But the fact is, that when they have you, they have you, and all you can do is to hang on to your manhood.</p>
<p>Barbour is not doing a very good job of this.  </p>

		<p>The actions of the MSM are expected, but the venom emitted by the National Review surprised me. The comments above and in the thread to NRO, show that the National Review is ready, willing, able, and anxious to join the liberal pack in chewing up a wounded white man.</p>

		<p> The mainstream media suggest that the damage is &#8220;already done,&#8221; which is a dead giveaway that they plan to remind people of what Barbour said at every opportunity, especially if he announces for president in 2012. Notice also that they chose an exremely unflattering photo of him to go with the story.</p>
<p> And what&rsquo;s so &#8220;appalling&#8221; about watermelon jokes, anyhow?</p>

		<p>And if the shoe were on the other foot and it was a black man chiding another black man and said &#8220;if you don&rsquo;t stop using racial slurs against white folk you&rsquo;ll be reincarnated into Wonder bread and devoured by the Partrige family&#8221;&hellip;&hellip;would he have been the subject of such scorn? I doubt it. Its becoming clear whites have allowed themselves to be put in a pot. And when they&rsquo;re not being consumed by others they sado masochistically consume themselves. It seems that this time around.. Cain has seduced Abel to slay himself. I&rsquo;ll make this clear&hellip; I despise cruelty whether the its pleasure of watching animals or humans suffer and I sincerely believe most whites that follow this cite feel the same. But on this note I also believe if we nitpick every mildly off colored joke any man has ever said.. we would never had had any presidents in this country. Lastly if it is considered wrong for white people to prefer the company of white people.. why is it not more of a crime for blacks to prefer the company of whites over their own kind?</p>

Only goes to prove that Mr. Barber is 100% more adept at formulating original and witty thoughts, ideas and anecdotes than, say, the teleprompter. Thus, I&rsquo;d think this particular remark and is rather a qualification for higher office than the opposite.</p>

		<p>Barbour is finally receiving the justice he deserves. A political hack who served the Bushes, this lobbyist of lard owns a fatcat $200+ per person per dinner restaurant in the shadow of the Capitol where the real governing gets done over $100+ bottles of wine.  Now he is trashing the Citizens Councils after the libs found a new Strom Thurmond or Trent Lott to prove the South hasn&rsquo;t changed. Libs love that, helps their fundraising, the SPLC can mail out million of solicitations, and Eric Holder can justify his &#8220;blacks only&#8221; civil rights enforcement. </p>
<p>Barbour never should have even been a rumor for President. You might as well put Jack Abramoff in the White House and give him the codes to the vaults at Ft. Knox. </p>
<p>And the Tea Party congressfolks are already downing martinis at fundraisers all over DC sponsored by the lobbying firms like Haley Barbour&rsquo;s.</p>

		<p>Oh, these guys are good.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve linked Barbour with the K and racism, coming out of the gate early and hard, dimming, if not eliminating Barbour&rsquo;s chances for a run at the presidency. Poor Haley  has now been put in a weak groveling position,  fighting with futility, squirming against charges of racism, pleading:   &#8216;I am not a racist!&rsquo;  &#8216;My town did not support the K!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He is right where his attackers want him.</p>
<p>They are Dick Morris mercenary-type operatives working for the Democratic party   &mdash;   they&rsquo;ll target, one by one, each potential Republican challenger against Obama in a run-up for the 2012 election, linking each one (however tenuously) with the K, Nazis, Tea Party White Supremacists, and racism, always the killer coup de grace: the racism charge.</p>
<p>The media is on the side of the Democrats, affording them a huge advantage.</p>
<p>If I had to guess, I think they&rsquo;ll eliminate each potential republican presidential candidate one by one until only Sarah Palin is left   &mdash;   and then attack her mercilessly (not that she hasn&rsquo;t already been thoroughly demonized, and they&rsquo;ve got lots of ammunition against her).  They may even fund her candidacy, it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me one bit.</p>
<p>Haley Barbour today, who&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>These people play to win, at all costs, holding onto power is their goal and they&rsquo;ll destroy anyone or anything that gets in their way.</p>
<p>The republicans had better wake up, Obama is being primed for re-election.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;damage already done&#8221; comment caught my eye also, Wayne.  Then I realized this story was written by Yahoo, who never misses an opportunity to show White females mingling with Black males, dating Black males, laughing it up with Black males, etc.  That they would make such a statement in their headline came as no surprise.</p>

		<p>When we will learn the facts of politics? Every interview of a conservative with the MSM is simply a pretext for them to trip the person up and get them to say something that can be broadcast at full volume from all their outlets for the sole purpose of destroying that person politically. Barbour was clearly not smart enough to not fall into this trap.</p>
<p>The only chance that conservatives have is to field a completely stealth candidate with almost no paper trail, tall and slender with a great head of hair, a winning smile and a comforting voice. They should stick with generalities and address the American people directly with &#8220;morning in America&#8221; style rhetoric. Do not give the media any chance to attack and destroy. I see no candidate that fits that bill today. And unless we can identify and groom such a candidate, it will be very difficult to win the Presidency. </p>

<p>Jack in Chicago replies:</p>
<p>Well - you know you are getting old if you can remember when National Review actually was a Conservative magazine that published articles on the rights of regular White Americans to live our lives in peace and safety. National Review was taken over by the Neo Conservatives and the new editors purged Peter Brimelow and John O&rsquo;Sullivan and all those who wrote against the massive NW immigration invasions and dared to oppose the &#8220;war on Christmas&#8221; and other cultural marxist programs to destroy our culture/our people.</p>
<p>Just understand  that now there is little difference between the National Review and the New York Times.</p>

<p>Haley Barbour is not doomed; It is over for him as far as a presidential run.</p>
<p>He may have been a fine governor for the state of Mississippi, especially in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, making the Chocolate City mayor look like a whiney, incompetent fool&hellip;.</p>
<p><i>But to unseat the first black president?</i></p>
<p>The Center National Stage in Prime Time is an entirely different affair and I don&rsquo;t think Barbour is a good fit, I don&rsquo;t believe he will play well in the mid-west or mountain states (notwithstanding his Southern Drawl).</p>
<p>And, most importantly, the sleazy national media will eat him alive while giving TOTUS or any other democratic candidates a free pass (and notice that TOTUS&rsquo;S handlers are dragging him to the middle, making him more palatable for the 2012 run).</p>
<p>TOTUS sat in Reverend Wright&rsquo;s Temple of Hate for years. Media = yawn.</p>
<p>Clinton stated:  &#8216;In former years he would have been fetchin&rsquo; us coffee.&rsquo;  Media = yawn.</p>
<p>Reid said TOTUS has &#8216;no negro dialect, unless he wanted one.&rsquo;  Media = yawn.</p>
<p>Biden called TOTUS &#8216;a articulate, clean-cut African-American.&rsquo;  Media = yawn.</p>
<p>No Republican will be given such as pass by the msm.  Mr. Barbour will be continuously linked with the K, racism, and that he may in his distant past have used the words  &#8220;watermelon&#8221; and &#8220;black&#8221; in the same sentence.</p>
<p>As for another four years of obama:  obama will have a tough time ramming through a far-left agenda with a less friendly Congress.  Divided governments have been good for the economy; since 1973, the S&P; 500 has registered 15.3% gains during split-government years, 9.9% losses during one-party control.</p>
