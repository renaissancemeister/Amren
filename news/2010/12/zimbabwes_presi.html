<h1>Zimbabwe&rsquo;s President Threatens &#8216;Revenge&rsquo; Against Western Companies</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CNN, December 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe threatened Friday to seize all Western-owned investments in the country unless their governments remove targeted sanctions imposed on him and his senior ZANU-PF party members.</p>
<p>The 86-year-old former guerrilla leader spoke at his party conference in Murare.</p>
<p>&#8220;This conference must come with a real program, a solid program of how we decide to fight sanctions,&#8221; Mugabe said. &#8220;What is our anti-sanctions program? We have been too far too good for malicious people for countries which seek to destroy us. Why should we continue to have 400 British companies here operating freely with Britain benefiting from us?&#8221; </p>
<p>The 86-year-old former guerrilla leader said that &#8220;the time has come for .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. revenge&#8221; and suggested that Zimbabwe&rsquo;s Indigenization and Economic Empowerment Act  &mdash;  which gives foreign companies five years to submit plans for transferring 51% of their investments to black Zimbabweans  &mdash;  did not go far enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can start with that 51%. In some cases, we must read the riot act to the British and others and say them, &#8216;This is only 51% we have taken. Unless you remove sanctions, we will go 100%,&rsquo; if they insist the sanctions must remain,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In 2002, the European Union and the United States imposed targeted sanctions on Mugabe and some senior party members after rampant reports of human rights violations and stifling of the opposition. Mugabe blames the sanctions for his country&rsquo;s woes, which include an unemployment rate of more than 90% and an inflation rate of 231,000,000%.</p>

		<p>I am surprised there are 400 British companies operating there!<br>
What are they still doing there?  Can it really be that profitable?  They ought to get their assets out of there as quickly as possible. In fact, they should have done that long ago.</p>
<p>On the other hand, five years  [allowed by his economic indigenization plan] is a long time   &mdash;   especially for a tired, half-crazy leader who is 86 years old.  A whole lot could happen within the next five years. Even is he is still alive at 91, will he still be functioning?&hellip;will he still be in power?  He is a lame duck president who is fast becoming irrelevant.</p>
<p>At this point, Rhodesians [Zimbabweans, if you prefer] don&rsquo;t even have to worry about removing him.  Nature will soon take care of that.  The big question is who will replace him?</p>

		<p>Invest NOTHING in the third world, particularly in Africa.  Let them sink or swim on their own.  Mugabe is just doing nationally what blacks do individually - take all they can get from the bleeding heart white man, then steal the rest.  How dare anybody expect blacks to act civilized in return for help.  China will eventually learn what American corporations have learned, by the way, in the heavy investment in Africa.<br>
As soon as they have built up the infrastructure and made viable again the industrial and commercial value, it will all be stolen from them and nationalized.  They will be kicked out.  Africa is beyond help.  The third world is nothing more than a money pit.<br>
Until we stop bailing them out, they will NEVER do for themselves.</p>

		<p>It is instructive to recall that feckless Western leaders put Mugabe in power.  (Britain&rsquo;s Queen Elizabeth II even made Mugabe an honorary knight in 1994.) </p>
<p>A BBC report on the death in 2007 of Ian Smith, the last prime minister of white-ruled Rhodesia before it became black-ruled Zimbabwe provides historical context: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Ian Smith believed Africans could never run their own countries. He went to his grave convinced he was right &hellip; President Mugabe has reduced Zimbabwe to ruin, its agricultural riches destroyed, food in desperately short supply, with hyper-inflation running out of control and any and all political opposition met by violence and repression. Ian Smith felt vindicated.&#8221;*</p>
<p>Ian Smith and Robert Mugabe, two leaders, same doomed country. The former competent but anathema to modern Western sensibilities, the latter incompetent but honored much of his career by virtue of earlier oppresssed/victim status.</p>
<p>Rhodesia-Zimbabwe is a cautionary paradigm for the West, as, under equally feckless leadership, it implements   &mdash;  - mostly via immigration policy   &mdash;  - its own &#8220;transition&#8221; from white rule. </p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Highly recommended: &#8220;IAN SMITH DIES,&#8221; BBC NEWS (2 min, 21 sec. video summary)<br>
&ldquo;Ian Smith dies aged 88&#8221;<br>

<p>Ah, but I don&rsquo;t think a newly powerful China will put up with that.  That&rsquo;s where the similarity with us us ends. The Chinese have no maudlin streak, or racial guilt, or politically correct fantasies, or utopian idealists, or alien fifth column, or love for the black man.  (As the Africans will find out!) </p>

		<p>The old fool will die soon. The problem that every dictator like him from Alexander to Caesar to Hitler/Stalin always has a hard core of generals or cops to enforce orders. And unless the regime totally collapses, the new thug takes over from the dead old-Lenin to Stalin to Khruschev, etc. So assuming the Zimbabwe blacks will coalesce around one of Mugabe&rsquo;s generals or tribal hacks, since if the &#8220;people&#8221; wanted democracy they would have rebelled and established it when it was clear Mugabe was a self-appointed deity, Westerners need to say: Take it. Take it now. And no one from your nation, refugee, thug, academic or cute little orphan up for adoption, is setting foot in the US, EU, Canada, or any other Western nation. Bank credit ends. World bank loans end. Your currency is dirt. We&rsquo;ll be back to pick up the pieces when you collapse. Always a &#8220;general&#8221; willing to do business for a paltry 50million in a secure bank account and some &#8220;companionship&#8221;. West let Rhodesia and South Africa come to this; a precursor of what&rsquo;s to come for us. But the damage is done. Dont put up with Mad Bobby&rsquo;s extortion now. Tell him to start digging/processing his own minerals, grow his own crops,and raise his own sheep. All beyond the ken of his nation of mental defects. </p>

		<p>Mugabe won&rsquo;t be satisfied until he has every chance for revenge against anything British or white and, of course, all of  it done on the back of the average Zimbabwean. So in du course these companies will be seized and control handed to some crony of Mugabe&hellip;with pretty much the same result as the seizure of the farms. There cannot be that much left for him to ruin. mercifully  death may soon call on him.</p>

		<p>An empty threat; these companies have boards of directors who already know their investments are gone.  This is Zimbabwe we&rsquo;re talking about, after all, and not Finland or Austria.</p>

		<p>&#8220;If sanctions are not removed, 100% of foreigners&rsquo; investments will be seized.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, and these black intellectual giants can&rsquo;t understand why nobody wants to invest in a business in their country.</p>
<p>As one of them so succinctly and brilliantly put it:  &#8220;Dat jus don&rsquo; make no sense.&#8221; <br>

<p>I notice there is a tendency for whites to believe only whites are capable of experiencing the full spectrum of human emotions.  Some good white people here seem to think non-white races have no noble aspirations but at the same time also have none of those naive(noble) ideals that are endemic to white liberals.  If Blacks and Hispanics are less capable and/or inferior in moral character, the Asians are essentially less human.</p>

		<p>We saw something very similar during the Asian conomic crisis in late 1997 and early 1998.  As the value of the Malaysian Ringgit fell on inernational exchange rates, the Malaysian P.M. Dr. Mahathir threatened to de-list the Ringgit.  Of course, this scared off business investors in droves and made it even harder for the Malaysian government to sell bonds.  An M.D. with no understanding of economics, Mahathir was completely mystified by the conterproductive effects of his threats, which of course destabilized the Ringgit.  Instead of keeping his mouth shut while allowing his finance minister to try to fix Malaysia&rsquo;s self-inflicted damage, the most useful thing Mahathir could think of doing was to blame &#8220;Jews&#8221;.<br>
