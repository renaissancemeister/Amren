<h1><a href="https://www.wtop.com/?sid=2185693&amp;nid=105">Africa Can Feed Itself But Needs Technology, Roads</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jason Straziuso, WTOP-FM (Washington, D.C.), December 20 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Kenyan-born Harvard professor told leaders from five East African countries on Thursday that the continent can feed itself within a generation if farmers embrace modern technology and governments expand infrastructure and harmonize regional markets.</p>
<p>Calestous Juma says in a new study being presented to leaders of the five-nation East African Community that policies over the last century have favored exporting Africa&rsquo;s raw materials and importing food, but that now Africa should focus on agriculture as an engine for regional trade and prosperity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Juma told the presidents of Burundi, Kenya and Tanzania as well as the prime minister of Rwanda and foreign minister of Uganda that they must embrace modern technologies, including biotechnology, and continue to expand basic infrastructure like roads, irrigation canals and energy grids. Farm mechanization and food storage also must be improved, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Lack of food is not the problem. Enough food is produced in the world today for everyone to be properly nourished and lead a healthy and productive life,&#8221; a recent report from the FAO [the UN&rsquo;s Food and Agriculture Organization] said. Hunger &#8220;exists because there is not enough investment in the rural sector in many countries to support agricultural development.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Juma, who grew up on the shores of Lake Victoria near the Uganda-Kenya border, said the East African Community needs to align its national and regional policies to maximize the agricultural industry. Roads have typically connected cities and not rural areas, but farmers need strong transport networks to quickly get food products to markets, Juma said.</p>
<p>Reliable electricity in rural areas can help farmers process food after harvesting, whether it&rsquo;s juice or canned goods, Juma said.</p>
<p>{snip} Kimani [Grace Kimani, a farmer] noted that many crops in Kenya rot because they can&rsquo;t reach markets in time and because farmers lack modern storage facilities.</p>

<p>Aside from indiscriminate sex, cutting off each other&rsquo;s limbs, and begging, is there anything sub-Saharan Africans CAN do?</p>

Even if black Africans could mount an effort to build their infrastructure (highly doubtful), their record of maintaining infrastructure is abysmal.</p>

<p>They can feed themselves now?  Isn&rsquo;t that great?</p>
<p>But they aren&rsquo;t out of diapers yet, because they still need white countries to care for them like babies.</p>
<p>But they need technology?  Does that mean when the hood is removed from their airplanes in order to examine the engine  there&rsquo;s a rubber band twisted real tight?</p>
<p>They chugged along for 5000 years without inventing the wheel.  Do they have it yet or did they buy one from the West and copy the design and called it reverse engineering? </p>

<p>It would appear that this is also true if you even let blacks into a civilized city, nation or anything. Look at the sorry state of so many once great American cities and it is because of blacks and black politicians.</p>

		<p>I think that the last few decades of South African and Zimbabian history do much to discredit the Harvard professor&rsquo;s conjectures.</p>
<p>Also notice that Prof. Juma prefers to treach at Harvard rather than  lead in Africa.</p>

		<p>The Chinese are going to own and run Africa, and within 50 years there won&rsquo;t be much of a Black Africa left. The Chinese have no qualms about population replacement. They are really hungry for new land and the point that, for the good of the world, no more concessions can be given to Africans will be found valid. After all, if the Africans cannot feed themselves, and they can&rsquo;t, where is the inhumanity in ceding control to Chinese who can?<br>
The USA will be left out in this bonanza. We will be too busy paying our Chinese bondholders to worry about it. </p>

		<p>I can go one better. In half a generation, ten years, all the nations of sub Saharan Africa could be self-sufficient, highly productive, exporters of food and materials. All you have to do is import a non African managerial class, a non African police/military, a non African bureaucracy, and non African business personnel. The natives would be 1000 x better off than they are today: no famine, less disease, less violence, and more opportunities for the few who could advance themselves.<br>
      Yes, I suppose it would resemble the former Rhodesia or South Africa in the 1970s&hellip;..but that would be racism and colonialism.</p>

<p>Right, they don&rsquo;t have to wait a generation. It could be done right now. All those whitey farmers dispossessed and shown the door in Rhodesia could have been given farms, tilled the land, hired dozens of workers, etc. The breadbasket that WAS Rhodesia could have been repeated all over the southern part of the continent. But that would have been logical - - and required some degree of thoughtfulness. That is sorely lacking.</p>

<p>Codex Alimentarius.<br>

<p>FAO = Trade Organization.  Bringing in Big Chema/Pharma and Supranationalist Government under a mask of &#8216;World Health&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In Africa, health comes via the steroiding up of all meats and fish while rendering illegal the use of potent vitamin suppliments which the present real-health NGOs use to help the locals fight off diseases related to the effects of malnutrition.</p>
<p>Codex Alimentarius started in 1962 in the UN with the goal of standing up this &#8216;Food Code&rsquo; on December 31, 2009.  On December 31st, 2009, the Codex Alimentarius went into effect.  Ex-Nazis from IG Farben, real long term planners.</p>
<p>At any rate, when you start pulling nutrients and start demanding that all proteins produced for mass agriculture meet &#8216;certain health standards&rsquo; (or you can&rsquo;t serve it to anyone outside your family), people start to die off because there is no functioning monetary system in much of rural Africa, it&rsquo;s all barter, and without money, you can&rsquo;t buy the growth hormones.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking on the order of a billion, globally, in the next ten years, just from the outlawing of vitamins.  Yes, this effects us too.  And it&rsquo;s a real threat.  Because it&rsquo;s not a Health Organization, it&rsquo;s Trade.  And if you don&rsquo;t play the trade game, you don&rsquo;t get economic perks, including debt relief.</p>
<p>Not all that fond of blacks but I don&rsquo;t need to have incidental genocide on my conscience.  Especially if it&rsquo;s not incidental.</p>
<p>Africa could be Kansas.  They need massive investment in desalinization, water transport and a healthy dose of DDT to kill off ALL the bugs and beasts which make disease vectoring between species groups so easy.</p>
<p>Nobody eats wildebeeste or zebra or cape buffalo like they WOULD eat cattle.  And cattle need lots of grazing, which means lots off standing grass, free of predators, year round.  </p>
<p>It also means freedom from disease.</p>
<p>Injecting cattle with Bovine Growth Hormone doesn&rsquo;t get you either.</p>
<p>It does make Monsanto and the like insanely rich/er though.</p>

		<p>This is probably a well-meaning and sincere opinion, but all the empirical evidence is to the contrary.  Black Africans seem incapable of creating or maintaining any modern infrastructure in<br>

But they can&rsquo;t not feed themselves, when they are on billion people and still don&rsquo;t know how to farm. They are hunters. And one or two million hunters can live in Africa. </p>

<p>Overbreeding, inherent low IQs and assuming Africans have the ability to harness and maintain First World technology are the problems.</p>

<p>Yeah, it seems Africans figure those nice White people from far away lands will continue to provide unending piles of money and medical care   &mdash;   either that or  they will be taken care of (for life) by stupid Whites via refugee programs  which allow Africans to continue breeding, colonizing (and destroying) White lands. </p>

		<p>Of course we have a living/dying example of how the Africans can feed themselves and it is in Zimbabwe, once the breadbasket of Sub-Saharan Africa with all the white African farmers that used to live there ther until they were robbed and driven off their legally owned lands.  Now thousands under Mugabe have fled to other local countries as they were starving in Zim. only to be either driven back or murdered in especially South Africa.  The averaghe African cannot farm other than subsistence farming (for his own family) when he is given a farm that is successful and ready to be farmed.  The machinery falls apart with abuse and misuse, and the dams built by the white African fall into disrepair so droughts cause famines as they did before the Europeans arrived 3oo years ago.  There are so many liberal dreamers in the World who always deny the truth.  But beware as the begging bowls will be out again soon as Mercedes Benz rubs their collective hands together at the prospect of increased sales.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Lack of food is not the problem. Enough food is produced in the world today for everyone to be properly nourished and lead a healthy and productive life,&rdquo;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>The problem is that food empires, which begin with the noble aim of feeding people, create aristocracies and population explosions, eventually leading to industrialized farming and mass movement of people into cities.</p>
<p>Later, the margins shrink, the economy becomes stretched to its limit, and the whole process of efficient growing and distributing grinds to a halt when an unforeseen change happens, such as drought, pestilence, currency collapse or climate change.</p>
<p>Then, farmers will grow enough just for themselves, and fight others to defend what little they have.<br>

		<p>what nonsense. How did the farmers of Rhodesia, the former breadbasket of Africa, do it?  What happened? </p>
<p>what a dream dancer this guy is. The reality of the scheme is, he is expecting  the west to do all the work, and then when the farms and canneries are set up, let the natives take over.</p>
<p>We all have seen pictures of black women walking five miles with big jugs on their heads to fetch water.  Not enough sense to lay a pipe line, or at least organize some more efficient way of transporting the water, like hauling a tank on a cart. </p>
<p>If you are interested in farming, esp. how black Africa could feed itself. check out Ken Hargesheimer, who has worked as a missionary in Africa. At least his method is doable, he has practiced what he preaches, small scale farming, including a type of drip irrigation. The way he does it,  the men have to get the water. He does not give anything away, no bucket, no pipe. The men have to do it, not the women.  Let them sell their watch, they all wear a watch, what for anyway? They all have a boombox, let them sell it.  They can use the money to buy what is needed to grow food, first for their family, then, branch out and feed the community. You can not start big (meaning the white is setting it up) and then have it, predictably, crash down. Start small and work up. That is the way to do it, you either do or eventually die. There are no successful  black farmers in this country, and this joker wants to have them do it in Africa.  </p>

		<p>        Traditional is best. Modern Agriculture depletes the soil and allows a population that cannot be maintained. This will be the reality for the Africans as it is already for India. After a dew decades of &#8220;green revolution&#8221; they are facing catastrophe. And ultimately we will have to face it here. We should never have exported our technology to the third world. We should have developed sustainable things and given it to them. But instead we gave them high tech agriculture and worse - high tech weapons. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before these are used against us.</p>
