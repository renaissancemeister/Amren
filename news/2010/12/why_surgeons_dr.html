<h1><a href="http://healthland.time.com/2010/12/10/why-surgeons-dread-red-heads/">Why Surgeons Dread Redheads</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Meredith Melnick, Time, December 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As the authors of a recent study published in BMJ attest, society&rsquo;s red-haired members don&rsquo;t always get a fair shake. Hoary stereotypes, such as the idea that redheads are also hot heads, are mixed together with actual physiological differences  &mdash;  such as a heightened sensitivity to pain. Now science is getting a better understanding of redheaded physiology than ever before.</p>
<p>In numerical terms, people with red hair are a decided minority. They comprise just 2-6% of the population of the northern hemisphere and 1-2% worldwide. It&rsquo;s genetics that make them such rare birds.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Operating room docs, for example, have long reported that redheads appear to need more anesthetic than others. The new study suggests that that observation is an accurate one  &mdash;  mostly. Those with the MC1R mutation are more sensitive to opiate pain killers  &mdash;  which means they&rsquo;d actually need less  &mdash;  but less sensitive to other types, most notably lidocaine injections. One study which used heat-related pain as its litmus of overall sensitivity showed that redheads indeed felt things more acutely and unpleasantly, probably because the MC1R mutation releases a hormone that stimulates a brain receptor associated with pain regulation.</p>
<p>Redheads are also said  &mdash;  anecdotally at least  &mdash;  to be more susceptible to hernias. The study did not establish that conclusively, but it did find a tangential link between chromosome 16 and a condition called brittle cornea syndrome, the sufferers of which have a slightly elevated hernia risk.</p>
<p>Less substantiated by the study was the belief that people with red hair are more susceptible to hemorrhages. A survey of tonsillectomy patients found that about 7% of both red-haired and control patients experienced post-surgical bleeding. And in a study of the blood coagulation of 50 women, half of whom were redheads, there was no difference in clotting.</p>

		<p>Since when is feeling pain linked to a hair color?<br>
My mom is a natural redhead, which makes me a carrier of the gene. Does that mean my pain sensitivity falls between the redheads and the rest of the population? </p>

		<p>I have to disagree with this. I have naturally brilliant red hair. Both my sisters have dark brown hair. They seem to feel pain more acutely than I. As a matter of fact, one has woken up twice in the middle of surgery, requiring additional anesthesia.</p>

		<p>Pain, huh? </p>
<p>  Even strong florescent lights can burn some/my red head skin. Few will understand or know the excuses conjured to avoid awesome hot vacations. Like Hawaii, Vegas, Spring break in Florida, Edmonton. I think we feel pain more as we tend to be more extreme, outward, and daring also. More injuries. Playing with fire was my grandpa&rsquo;s explanation for the soul of our red hair and the reason our body suffered. I tend to agree and so do my 5 red haired brothers. Three red sisters were nuts too. <br>
 <br>
  I think this story is Racist against us redheads. I demand justice. Are we not all the same?  <br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m rather fond of redheads (the female variety), they make great music, ans some speak gaelic, an ancient softly spoken language.</p>
<p>I once had a redhead (my daughter calls them &#8216;gingers&rsquo;) in a gymnastics class, she was acting up so I suggested she take a break in the ladies room. She did, and shoved all the girls&rsquo; clothes down the toilet. When I called her mother to complain I got my ear chew off (figuratively). </p>
<p>My advice is to tread carefully around redheads. But I love &#8216;em.</p>

		<p>I have to disagree with the part about redheads needing more anesthesia.  I never have.  I have also been told by two doctors and two dentists that I have a high tolerance to pain.</p>
<p>Now, the hothead part.  At least for me, it is quite true.  I am a tornado if I get angry enough.  My advice to everyone is leave the room quickly when a redhead&rsquo;s blood starts to boil.<br>

Says who? May we have access to the abstract describing the reasearch that was actually done- if it was in fact, done? Can trained scientists examine the data?</p>

		<p>My hair is reddish/blondish/brownish, all swirled together in a mass that is decidedly popular with the ladies.</p>
<p>Which part of my body should feel more pain due to being partially red?</p>
<p>I think this research is bunk.</p>

		<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ll throw my two cents worth in. I&rsquo;m a natural redhead and have a low tolerance to pain. Whenever I go to the dentist, I need lots of extra Novocaine. </p>
<p>As for the temper part, I&rsquo;m pretty easy going, but if I someone really pushes me, watch out. I remember a time during the Bi-Centennial when I lived in New York. Some friends and I were at an Italian restaurant in Greenwich Village where you have to share your table with other diners. There was some smart aleck guy with two women at our table and he got all in a huff because I was smoking a cigarette. (This was in the days when smoking in public was fun.)  Well, he was an arrogant obnoxious little twit and after much ado and complaining he took a half empty bottle of wine and laid it down on the table so it would spill in my direction. I snapped. I grabbed the bottle, leapt from my chair, and proceeded to try and whack him over the head as I was yelling, &#8220;I&rsquo;ll kill you, you little b******!&#8221; It was actually a fun moment as I had the little creep cowering in his chair. Next thing I know the manager is grabbing my arm saying, &#8220;Signorina, Signorina, please, calm down.&#8221; The creep and his two female friends quickly left and my friends and I finished our dinner in peace. On our way out a man who had witnessed the whole thing asked me if I was Irish. When I said yes, he said, &#8220;Yup, I thought so.&#8221; </p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s red hair and being Irish?     </p>

<p>In cases of partially welt formed redness its usually your butt. Your local dominatrix can, particulary if persuaded by a monetary donation, be persuaded to give you a demonstration. </p>

		<p>I doubt this story about redheads feeling more pain. If that were true, why are a lot of Bantu women mimicking white women, by coloring their hair red?</p>
<p>Red-headed black women are even stupider-looking than blonde haired black women.</p>

		<p>I think most of the people here misunderstand the point of the article. It doesn&rsquo;t say that redheads are more sensitive, from what I understand, it says they react differently to various painkillers.</p>

<p>Exactly what I was thinking.  I know plently of intelligent, fair-minded blacks and Hispanics; I also know plenty of dumb whites.  But that doesn&rsquo;t change the averages.  But I think I&rsquo;ll mention my personal observations anyway.  My brother is somewhat red-headed (in the summer-time; in winter its brown), an yes he can be very hot-headed and is very sensitive to pain.  But then, I also knew a girl in 10th grade who had very red hair, and she was on eo fthe calmest and moralistic girls at the school; not hot-headed at all.</p>
