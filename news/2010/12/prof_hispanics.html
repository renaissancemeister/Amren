<h1><a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=239797">Prof: Hispanics Should Replace &#8216;Old White Men&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jerome R. Corsi, WorldNetDaily, December 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A UCLA professor has given public speeches in support of the DREAM Act in which he has made inflammatory statements, including the suggestion that Hispanics should replace &#8220;old white men&#8221; in positions of power and that Republican leaders in the Senate who oppose the immigration bill are racists.</p>
<p>On the UCLA website, Kent Wong is listed as the director of the Center for Labor Research and Education at UCLA, where he teaches Labor Studies and Asian-American Studies.</p>
<p>On Dec. 13, Wong gave a speech at a pro-illegal immigration rally at McArthur Park in Los Angeles in which he endorsed the DREAM Act in racist terms, according to a video first surfaced by Eyeblast.tv.</p>
<p>Toward the end of his speech calling for the DREAM Act to be passed by Congress, Wong proclaimed to the rally, &#8220;When that day happens, the young people of the DREAM Act movement will go on to accomplish and do great things with our lives. You will go on to become lawyers, teachers, doctors and members of the U.S. Congress to replace those old white men. (Applause) You are the hope and future of this country. You represent the hope and future of your generation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The website of the Center for Labor Research and Education includes as major funders, with donations of $10,000 or more, George Soros&rsquo; Open Society Institute and the Tides Advocacy Fund, as well as the city of Los Angeles and the Ford Foundation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a separate video, posted on YouTube.com, Wong is shown giving a speech in what appears to be a classroom setting during a Dec. 9 press conference in which he said:</p>
<p>{snip} Let us be very clear what is behind the anti-immigrant hysteria in Congress today, and especially among certain Republican leaders in the U.S. Senate; it is racism pure and simple. If these young immigrant students were from Ireland, or from Italy, or from Germany, we would not have this massive outcry against the DREAM Act. It is because they are from Latin America, they are from Asia, they are students of color that the minority in the Senate is trying to use a procedure to block the will of the majority.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wong also served as the founding president of the Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance, AFL-CIO, a union group that claims to be &#8220;the first national organization of Asian union members and workers.&#8221;</p>

		<p>It is ironic that Wong claims that the Republicans are trying to block the &#8220;majority&#8221;.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The &#8220;majority&#8221; of Americans do not want the illegals here.  Perhaps the &#8220;majority&#8221; of people Wong knows or identifies with are for the Dream Act but, so what?  </p>

<p>Every year the US plays host to tens of thousands of students from Germany, Italy and Ireland. How many of them join gangs? How many receive food stamps? How many are uninsured? How many end up doing long stints in prison at a cost of 50,000+ a year? How many are convicted felons in their own lands? How many are here illegally?</p>

		<p>Color me shocked.  Time will tell if Kent Wong is just a typical commie professor or a Red Chinese agent doing his part to destabilize the United States through mass illegal immigration.  The blatantly anti-white tone of the pro-illegal movement has been getting louder over the last few years, which should help those with their head still firmly in the sand decipher exactly what those behind this movement see as their goal.  The complete annihilation of white America and it&rsquo;s culture.  This movement is about conquest, nothing more.   </p>

		<p>I am one of those &#8220;evil&#8221; white men that Wong wants to replace.  Let me tell you how &#8220;evil&#8221; I am:</p>
<p>When the USA was starting their all volunteer army back in 1973, I volunteered!  I served two years and rose to the rank of E-4, which is about as good as a raw recruit could do at the time.  I got a letter of commendation for a missile firing exercise.  Later I served four more years in the National Guard.</p>
<p>I have also worked hard all of these years, and paid my taxes.  I have never been in trouble with the law.</p>
<p>I come from a family where just about every man has served in the military, including one decorated member of the Air Force.  My father was involved in developing anti-aircraft missiles for this country.</p>
<p>I have never got a fair shake in the job market due to Affirmative Action policies.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I am one of those &#8220;evil&#8221; white guys that everyone wants to displace.  </p>
<p>The dream act is a NIGHTMARE.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s funny, very few of them have been able to do this in their native lands.  They seem to need the white man&rsquo;s culture and laws for them to be able to achieve much of anything - Asians included.</p>
<p>I suggest we ship Prof. Hop Sing back to where he came from (or where his family originated).  Oh yeah, and let&rsquo;s flood Asia with Africans, Haitians, Mexicans and Dominicans!<br>

		<p>Kent Wong is as racist as they come. Bet if I told him that to his face, he would be shocked. Asians, blacks and all other races except white feel that by being of another ethnicity, that exempts them from being racist. Well, it does NOT. &#8220;Old white men&#8221; built this country, fought and died in its wars defending it, and are the ones who made this country great. Wong and his ilk are the ones who are destroying this country. They contribute nothing but useless verbiage and ideals dangerous to our country - like pro-illegal immigration. Let them disparage white people all they want. We know it&rsquo;s fueled by jealousy and resentment for what white people have done for and in America.  </p>

		<p>This situation reminds me of Jean Raspail&rsquo;s classic novel, &#8220;The Camp of the Saints.&#8221;</p>
<p>It reminds me of the particular moment when the young leftist radical approached the gentlemen who was enjoying his last day of civilization in the south of France, just before the barbarian horde of poor Indians stormed the coast. He spoke just like this man, celebrated the end of Western civilization just like these students are doing. </p>
<p>When the horde finally did approach the shores of France, die hard self-hating teenagers opened their arms. But the horde did not care. They passed over them and swept the cities. They cared not about their guilt, their complex, their &#8220;solidarity.&#8221; All they wanted was their heritage, their land, and their wealth. And thus France fell, not with a bang, not with its young men and women fighting for La Marseillaise or les idéals de la République, but with a whimper. With a last breath, just simply allowing the death knell of a process of self-mutilation that had already been going on for decades.</p>
<p>For those who are older than the undergraduate level, please know:<br>
We are not all like that. We who love the West are here, and we&rsquo;re proud. I still have trouble conceiving how someone can look at the end of their people and their civilization, and celebrate it.</p>

		<p>Wong&rsquo;s anti-White rant has really gone viral and I was even surprised to hear it on conservative talk radio on my way home from work this evening. I&rsquo;m going to keep watching my local paper to find out when any of these enemies of our people are having their rallies, conferences, and lectures. These are often free and open to the public and I will show up armed with my cell phone and make sure to film any similar ravings from those who would displace us.</p>

		<p>If welfare was dismantled tomorrow, within a week, every single illegal would leave the US.  Within a year, nearly every immigrant who came here within the last 30 years would leave.</p>
<p>Immigration, legal and illegal is a red herring.  What this is REALLY about is stealing money from white people to build an empire based on drugs and slavery.  The very second we stop forking it over, it will collapse.</p>
<p>It WILL happen, one way or the other.  What they are doing is anti-life and cannot stand.  Previous attempts at building similar societies (aztecs, mayans etc.) died out so fast they literally vanished with barely a trace.  The only question is if we will share their fate.</p>

		<p>Wait until soul brother Wong learns that Hispanics (what&rsquo;s that? Someone who hispans?) have less use for Chinese than they do for Anglos.  I was going to say European-Americans, but Hispanics are European-Americans, being a mixture of Spanish and Native American peoples.</p>

		<p>Maybe the good Professor Wong would like to take these poor misunderstood Hispanics back to China, and have them live there in all their Multicultural splendor? Sure, that will happen. </p>
<p>And if the Hispanics were to take over this Country, it would become another Mexico or Honduras, or some other poor excuse for a Country, which is crime ridden, and AIDS infected.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t these Chinese and Koreans, like this one, walk their walk by expanding the Africans, Hispanics, and Pakistanis, etc. into their Cultures, if they love them so much? Why, indeed. </p>
<p>The Orientals like the Chinese and Koreans don&rsquo;t want Whites as competitors, and damned good ones we are; which stands in their way to dominate and control the world. Better they insert themselves into this Illegal Alien Scam Act, through those they are paying off in certain circles, to help these Illegals become Citizens.</p>
<p>This guy isnt fooling anyone. Most people have woken up to the fact that they are the enemy. Now it&rsquo;s just a matter of finding alternatives through our own resources to become self sufficient as a people, in our own Countries. Then we can tell China to go away.<br>

<p>Of course I am making this up.</p>
<p>May I suggest that Mr. Wong go back to the Orient? Time was, a few years ago, he would have been forced to do so, by ingenious means. Nowadays, he rises up against the people who made this country.</p>

<p>Comrade Wong, you do make a really &ldquo;good case&rdquo; here!</p>
<p>Of course, obviously, one need only ask why these students of color: from Latin America and Asia, need to be in the USA or any other white country to thrive in the first place, if where they come from&hellip;???</p>
<p>Yawn, it is boring; it is idiocy without remedial scholastics. It constantly focuses on &ldquo;racism,&rdquo; when incompetence and hypocrisy are the real keys here. Or put another way, a Japan or Korea without Mexicans and Jamaicans, must just be like a day without sunshine, right?</p>
<p>And where does that leave Zimbabwe or Cuba&hellip;?</p>

<p>The old White men who didn&rsquo;t protect the border should be dispossessed first.  Target the politicians for the non white Diversity Treatment.  Let them live in the hideous mess they made, and then we will hold up their poetic misery as a testimony of the rightness of our rational prejudices against the non white bloodthirsty third world swarms.</p>
<p>&#8220;YOU see, Sir, that in this enlightened age I am bold enough to confess that we are generally men of untaught feelings, that, instead of casting away all our old prejudices, we cherish them to a very considerable degree, and, to take more shame to ourselves, we cherish them because they are prejudices; and the longer they have lasted and the more generally they have prevailed, the more we cherish them. We are afraid to put men to live and trade each on his own private stock of reason, because we suspect that this stock in each man is small, and that the individuals would do better to avail themselves of the general bank and capital of nations and of ages. Many of our men of speculation, instead of exploding general prejudices, employ their sagacity to discover the latent wisdom which prevails in them. If they find what they seek, and they seldom fail, they think it more wise to continue the prejudice, with the reason involved, than to cast away the coat of prejudice and to leave nothing but the naked reason; because prejudice, with its reason, has a motive to give action to that reason, and an affection which will give it permanence. Prejudice is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision skeptical, puzzled, and unresolved. Prejudice renders a man&rsquo;s virtue his habit, and not a series of unconnected acts. Through just prejudice, his duty becomes a part of his nature.&#8221; -Edmund Burke, Reflections on the Revolution in France, 1790</p>

		<p>I wonder how many interracialist white people will chime in on this article to praise East Asians like they always do, try to make us pretend East Asians are kinda white?  For those white people who acknowledge reality they see the major plastic surgeries East Asians have to look white, the cartoons made of supposed East Asians to look white, adoption of white names like Kent and flooding of higher learning institutions and see East Asians looking to totally replace white people.  It&rsquo;s their objective and no other group is more set on it than East Asians.  You have East and South Asians suffocating white society at the top and Amerindians and Africans at the bottom.</p>

		<p>The Chinese will replace us whites (and blacks) in a few hundred years.  Way back when I was in High School, a friend of mine, a head shop owner, said that we would be living with the Chinese in a few hundred years. I thought that he was nuts at the time.My biology teacher said something similar a couple of years earlier  .I hate to say it, but it looks like both of them were right.</p>

		<p>Aren&rsquo;t Asians Overrepresented at UCLA? If someone should be replaced, simply for fairness, shouldn&rsquo;t Asians like him be the first to go? </p>
<p>Instead he&rsquo;s so afraid of the forces of political correctness, he upholds these preposterous ideals (and perhaps wisely so). Perhaps my idea is absurd too, but I can&rsquo;t help wonder if the craziest anti-reality views of the leftists don&rsquo;t come about in the first place simply because they are afraid of black folks. If that&rsquo;s not what drives it all, if they are not now, in their heart of hearts, not simply afraid of African Americans, and afraid of offending them, they inevitably will be. </p>

		<p>Displace the old Whiteys as soon as possible.  Wouldn&rsquo;t you rather your own White kind dispossessed by the warrior like Mexican indians than by indolent, ignorant, militant  Africans?</p>
<p>Everything taken from us by Mexicans won&rsquo;t be taken from us by Africans.  Once the Mexicans get their hands on it, they&rsquo;ll set for us a good example by keeping it all for themselves, and they will never hand it over to the afrovoodoos in the name of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>We can only wish the Mexicans get their hands on the Mennonite Church endowments before the afrovoodoos do. Take a look at the organized effort by the blacks to take the power and wealth away from Whites, who will no doubt hand it all over in a surrender of destiny and self-respect, as well dereliction of Christian duty.</p>

<p>This is how a White woman pleads to be dispossessed of her White religious birthright:  Mennonites now holding themselves &#8220;accountable&#8221; to afrovoodoos. </p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/2esnlpa</p>
<p>Ha ha ha. What could go wrong?</p>
<p>But I do admire the Mennonite afrovoodoos for their segregationist instincts.  But that White Humanity would do the same thing as led by the White Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>If you want to listen to the Mennonite Holy Spirit, you can only get the message through the afrovoodoos:  </p>
<p>&#8220;Around 80 current and former Racial/Ethnic leaders who are connected to Mennonite Church USA are planning to gather Jan. 9-11, 2011, in Tampa, Fla., to share their experiences as leaders of color within the church and to discern what the Holy Spirit is saying to the church through them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Segregation, Christian style, just the way we want it. Leave the blacks alone to segregate themselves away from us, and then demand they leave us alone when we want our own White Holy Spirit among just our White selves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of the purpose and nature of the event, it is only open to leaders of color.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whites Keep Out!</p>

		<p>Flying Tiger #20: This idiot, Wong, should take another look at the riots that engulfed the Los Angeles area, after the Rodney King verdict. </p>
<p>All the videos that I have ever seen from that typical Minority type of event, showed Chinese and Korean Merchants with guns, shooting at the the Black and Hispanic rioters that attacked their Stores, and killed many of their people in Little Korea. </p>
<p>I wonder if the Orientals that lived through that riot would also look forward to a Black/Hispanic take-over of the United States? </p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s our next Homework assignment. Let&rsquo;s ask these Koreans and Chinese just what they think, on video, and in print. Then we can rub the results of our findings in Wong&rsquo;s face, and every other Liberal idiot out there.  </p>

		<p> Wonder if Professor Wong (his name should be &#8220;Wrong,&#8221; because that&rsquo;s what his assumptions are) is aware of how the minority-dominated state of California discriminates against East Asian students in its university system? There is a ceiling on the number of Asian-American students admitted as freshmen each year, so that more blacks can be admitted (under much-lower academic requirements, of course). </p>
<p> But Wong is not &#8220;wrong&#8221; about one thing: Yes, it IS because Latin Americans tend to be mestizos or Indians (the ones who come to the U.S. illegally tend to be, anyway) that a sizeable number (not &#8220;a small handful&#8221;) of White Americans don&rsquo;t want them here.</p>
<p> Europeans built this country; they secured its independence, founded its system of government; and as late as 1960, made up 89 percent of its population. We were under no obligation to open the floodgates and allow all these darker-skinned people in; we permitted our elected, misguided representatives to change the immigration laws to favor non-Europeans, and to look the other way while this tidal wave of illegal Mexicans has flooded in.</p>

		<p>The people who have visited this site, and this page, more specifically, would do well to read the book, &#8220;The Life of John Birch&#8221; by Robert H.W. Welch, Jr. </p>
<p>Captain John Birch was originally a Baptist Missionary, who was then attached to General Chennault&rsquo;s American Volunteer Group, also known as the &#8220;Flying Tigers&#8221;. That later became the 14th Air Force. </p>
<p>John Birch was able to learn Chinese so well, that many Chinese people believed that he was from another Province, due to his unique command of their language. </p>
<p>Captain Birch was priased by all in uniform who had known and served with him, among them General Chennault, who looked upon John as a son, but also Colonel James Doolittle, whose men he rescued after their aicrafts were downed by the Japanese, behind enemy lines. </p>
<p>Oddly enough, when John Birch was murdered by the Chinese Communists, his body was taken and buried by the Chinese Peasants who knew and loved him. </p>
<p>Later, his body was brought to another part of China, by Nationalist Chinese Soldiers, and he received full Military Honors, while American Soldiers, as well as Chinese Nationalists, and the disengaged Soldiers of the Japanese Garrison in that Chinese Province, stood guard.</p>
<p>I found it quite profound, that the one time enemy of the Imperial Japanese Army, who only months before was searching for John Birch, who had a bounty on his head, gave this former adversary his due respect, and paid tribute to him as a fallen Warrior.</p>
<p>The Japanese were a tough enemy, but no one can take their honor, as displayed here, away from them. </p>
<p>The Communists, who first shot, and then bayonetted John Birch, are the same the world over: cold blooded killers, without regard for any human life whatsoever. </p>
<p>I encorage all of you to read this book, and learn more about the man, who was as valiant in the field of Battle, as Seargent York, or Audie Murphy, and who should be praised as one of our greatest Patriots, and Warriors, of the 20th Century. </p>
<p>Then join the John Birch Society, and take up where this man left off; defending his Country. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;d  probably a little bit correct, because being our fellow  Europeans  we dont  need to suspect  they&rsquo;re coming over  with a hidden genocidal hatred against white people. But isnt it amazing  how open they are about it  nowadays. Now imagine a white man  speaking in the same terms about people of colour. I think it&rsquo;s really about time  offended white people started lobbying back and pushing for  the same protection as  the law gives for people of colour.

The Irish and Italian and German immigrants would not only be of high quality intellectually and temperamentally, much unlike most of the &#8220;Latin&#8221; &#8220;immigrants&#8221;, but more importantly, as this smart-and-almost-certainly-not-lowlife Mister Wong attests to, would identify with the white citizens of this country   &mdash;   the decent, productive backbone of this country   &mdash;   even when they could be said to be in disagreement, unlike the &#8220;Latins&#8221; and Asians and other non-whites, whose cultures, tastes and (because of differences in beauty and intelligence) overall human value   &mdash;   all of which basically genetically determined   &mdash;   are sufficiently different that they immediately cast themselves as confrontational &#8220;others&#8221; and positively <i>itch</i> to find this or that issue of individual or group difference in ability/attractiveness/whatever due <i>actualllly</i> to those evil nasty no-good white imperialist devils.</p>
<p>To state the essence of it: for me to want you to immigrate here, you must be both of high quality and compatible. Much of the &#8220;Latins&#8221; and non-Asians are not high quality, and much of those that are, and the Asians that generally are, are not compatible.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve finished that thought, I&rsquo;d like to suggest that in China there are too many old Chinese men determining national policy, and that, to rectify this ghastly situation, they should be replaced with Malaysians, Filipinos, Koreans and Japanese. Some Chinese might argue that this would cause problems, but I assure you, they are merely xenophobic fools, and nothing whatsoever harmful to the Chinese people would come of such a decision.</p>
<p>So, how about it, Mister Wong? Sound like a good idea?</p>
<p>Heh, I thought not. Get lost!</p>

		<p>Well, this should put the lie, once and for all, to the idea that Asians are our friends. They&rsquo;ll play nice when they have no power, but when they have the chance to influence policy, they&rsquo;ll be happy to join the forces arrayed against us.</p>

		<p>I would call this man for an Asian agent provocateur but I don&rsquo;t see the point.</p>
<p>Yes, Mexico is an -excellent- example, not of the failure of hispanics as a culture group but of the SUCCESS of elitism.  </p>
<p>Mexicans who interbreed with stupid, venal, pretty, whites until they -look- white, form the top 10% of a &#8216;color continuum&rsquo;, using cronyism and nepotism to control billions in individual, industrial and infrastructure monopolies.  With mestizos of varying shades beneath them and an untouchables caste of blacks and native (dark skinned) indians simply unacknowledged at the very bottom.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>While highly _racist_ and effective, this system does not include any Asians.  And Asians show little interest in breeding with hispanics as typically happens in the Latin American solution to &#8216;zero the differences&rsquo; between races by creating hybrid ethnies that are themselves socially isolated.  Like an infection in an amputated limb.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the point?  Does this man, or the agenda which he represents, think that replacing one racial-ethno identity group (whites) with another (Asians will be the &#8216;doctors, lawyers and engineers&rsquo;&hellip;) will not simply move the bullseye to the new empowered group?</p>
<p>Or is there some miracle panacea whereby, having used racial divisivism to instigate anarchial racewar, you can simply turn it off?  Genetic therapies?  Higher fluoride concentrations?</p>
<p>Gotta have high tech hospitals and working water delivery for that&hellip;</p>
<p>My personal belief is that inviting low IQ, low morality, populations into your society to energize it&rsquo;s menial labor and junk consumerism pools is chaining a dragon to cook your dinner that doesn&rsquo;t need to be domesticated to begin with.  We are well past the point where robotics could be doing most of the cheap labor and leveraged currency values have always succeeded in protecting differential payment for the remainder (as higher minimum wages).</p>
<p>Since a post-white America will be one where the dragon destroys the chefs, one must assume that, in using hostile foreign ethnies to genocidally replace us, those in control have a method to in turn destroy them.  As a post-industrial planet doesn&rsquo;t need highly leveraged dumb labor in huge populations at all.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s scary.</p>

		<p>Freedom and Opportunity created by Whites and only Whites as a reflection of generations of White DNA, honed to seek liberty and oppose centralized, authoritarian/strong-arm governments. No other race seems to be capable of creating limited government/free market societies.<br>
And yes, as we Whites become a minority, we (ALL of us) are headed toward the &lsquo;horrors of communism&rsquo;, anarchy and genocide.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid you have this quite backwards.  Immediately after the civil war, the US began its slow transformation into a communist state.  Today, we are most of the way there.  Government owns most assets, confiscates most income, is a gigantic juggernaut threatening to implode under its own weight.  And people living off what has been stolen from their neighbor has become so great that we have accumulated debt that can&rsquo;t ever be paid off.</p>
<p>The issue of white dispossession is a SYMPTOM, not a root cause.  An effect and an agenda of crazy people who think they can get a better form of slave for the empire.  They define &#8220;better&#8221; as will accept a far lower standard of living.  They think, more for them, less for the slaves.  But it doesn&rsquo;t work that way.  They are too crazy and stupid to know it.  Stupid and crazy among the elites is bad news for totalitarian governments.  And the US is experiencing that right now.</p>
<p>Reversing the situation means you can&rsquo;t grab the tail and expect to wag the dog.  The problem is communism, not immigration.  Specifically, the problem is welfare.  Welfare is the reason almost all non-whites come to the US.  Dismantle it and they will flee.  They don&rsquo;t want to live under such a totalitarian regime as ours.  They are used to breaking laws regularly, drunk driving, rape, the occasional murder.  They can get away with all that with impunity in their own countries (which all have weak, token, often missing, governments).</p>

And what, pray tell, is wrong with that? </p>
<p>Take it to a smaller level, and maybe you can understand this. Our country is like a person&rsquo;s home. The homeowner does not have to admit everyone who walks up to the door and wants to come in. Just because he denies entry to some, does not mean he has to deny entry to all, either.</p>
<p>If we wish to admit whites only to our country, that should be OUR decision, not to be decided by people like this Asian interloper who uses the education he got courtesy of this country, to provide a platform from which he can openly call for the genocide of our race and our leaders, even if they are &#8220;old white men&#8221;. Since he doesn&rsquo;t seem to appreciate the freedoms, privileges and opportunities he enjoys here, he should remove himself from our country forthwith, and take with him any woman who has consented to breed with him, and all their children.</p>

		<p>First off, I&rsquo;d just like to mirror #36&rsquo;s comment about The United Way and any other sponsors this loon and his &#8220;University&#8221; might have.  Hit them where it hurts - the wallet.  I wouldn&rsquo;t bother e-mailing &#8220;Kent&#8221; Wong(that&rsquo;s quite a WHITE first name he has there) himself, as he&rsquo;s clearly deranged.  I&rsquo;d make it quite clear that as long as they&rsquo;re funding this nut, TUW will not be on the list of charities you donate to.  I know it just got knocked off of my admittedly rather short list.</p>
<p>The United Way:<br>

<p>1. It is natural for whites to prefer whites as blacks prefer blacks and as Chinese (like you, Mr. Wong) prefer their own.</p>

		<p>&#8220;If welfare was dismantled tomorrow, within a week, every single illegal would leave the US. Within a year, nearly every immigrant who came here within the last 30 years would leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>- This is basically one of the main crucibles here.  No one immigrates to Russia (except for mineral hungry Chinese in the far east) because Russia has a very poor welfare system.  No one immigrates to China (except for stray north korean refugees) because China will not take care of you.</p>
<p>The whole world floods into white nations because the powers that be have set up a nanny state complex that will feed, clothe, shelter, educate and coddle you and ask for nothing in return.  No sanctions for laziness or criminal behavior or irresponsible breeding either.</p>
<p>Of course it&rsquo;s a good deal!  Even though no one is starving in Mexico, and no latinos who come here are skinny scarecrows, life is a lot of hard work in their countries with few amenities.  Go north and boom - you&rsquo;re in the promised land of freebies.</p>
<p>The only way to reverse this is to end the welfare state.  Until that happens, the world will continue to want to come here. </p>

		<p>This individual is highly suspect. First he is Chinese ancestry, presumably is for a merit based hierarchy, if for no other reason than not supporting one could lead to his children not getting the appointments they are striving for. I presume his support for Affirmative Action is literally skin-deep. Playing to the mob, but staying with the elite is the oldest game in town. What rankles is the over-the-top egotism, the showboating. What a combination: Martin Luther King, Che, and Mao all in the same eggroll.</p>

<p>Doctors and lawyers, eh? That seems very, very unlikely. Hispanics have an IQ average that is practically as low as that of Blacks, and those sons and daughters of illegals come from families where the parents think that education is a waste of time.</p>
<p>Many of those mestizos, who come illegally in the US, don&rsquo;t even have the ability to learn the English language, or very basic mathematics!</p>
<p>Those brown invaders, are the hope of the future? PLEASE, JUST GIVE ME A BREAK!</p>
<p>Look at it this way: can the United States remain the driving force in, say, aerospace enginering and modern medicine, if the majority of its population, becomes a collection of hordes of Mestizos, most of whom drop out of highschool, and the rest,  major in Hispanic Studies (if they do get into college)&hellip;?</p>

		<p><i>The issue of white dispossession is a SYMPTOM, not a root cause.</i></p>
<p>  &mdash;  Anon # 58</p>
<p>The root cause is that our government,  media and academia have been co-opted by those who do not represent White interests, only their own. For them,  we Whites are mortal enemies, good only for providing cannon fodder for endless foreign wars, 9,000 nautical miles away from our home, against Third World nations that are no threat to us, or to hand over whatever wealth and property we&rsquo;ve accumulated for government redistribution to non-Whites.</p>
<p>After that, we are and will be expendable.</p>
<p>The hostile elite are neither crazy nor insane:  They know <b>exactly</b> what they are doing.  I believe White genocide to be their primary objective; and, through a 50-year, carefully triangulated plan executed by the media and academia, non-Whites are being primed for not only White displacement, but White destruction as well.</p>
<p><i>We are not quite there</i>, as you stated:  When the gulags open, people fear a knock on the door (or a knock on the head), when neighbors and loved ones disappear forever, branded as subversive and &#8216;enemies of the state&rsquo;, when children are asked to spy on their parents, when the killing fields open, when starvation becomes common, THEN we&rsquo;ll have reached the Great Communist Utopia   &mdash;   one that does not include Whites.</p>
<p>Professor Rummel writes this in <i>Power Kills</i> about Communist-sponsored Democide in the old Soviet Union:</p>
<p><i>Probably 61,911,000 people, 54,769,000 of them citizens, were murdered by the Communist Party  &mdash;  the government  &mdash;  of the Soviet Union&hellip;Old and young, healthy and sick, men and women, and even infants and infirm, were killed in cold-blood. They were not combatants in civil war or rebellions, they were not criminals. Indeed, nearly all were guilty of &hellip; nothing.</i></p>
<p>Kevin MacDonald is not wrong when he writes:</p>
<p><i>Whites living in societies run by non-Whites are in physical danger.  From the aftermath of the Bolshevik Revolution to contemporary Africa, the lesson is the same: Loss of political power means murder and mayhem directed against Whites by minorities with deep historical grudges.</i></p>

		<p>Given California&rsquo;s financial problems, I understand there has been talk of shutting down certain portions of that state&rsquo;s educational system, to include the university system.</p>
<p>A while back I came across pictures of the UCLA campus.  I am 62 but never made my way up to Westwood or wherever the campus is located to visit the library and to see for myself what it and the campus looked like.  Judging from the pictures, I am under impressed.</p>
<p>My Dad graduated from UC Berkeley.  If the choice is to close Berkeley or UCLA, I think the Regents of the University of California would close UCLA. If for no other reason than that Cal is the older institution.</p>
<p>I am sorry to see the horrors that the Left have brought to my beloved birth state of California.  However, now I have something to look forward to in the roar and dust of its destruction.  </p>
<p>I think you will find that the colour of your pink slip will not unduly clash with the colour of your political and racist philosophy.  Indeed, such an event will be both hope and change each of us can believe it.  You have rejected the California of the white man for the Mexifornia of the brown man.  Enjoy, Mr. Wong.

		<p>If a white person complains that mass immigration and illegal immigration are making white people a minority, replacing their culture, traditions and even their language with those of foreigners and strangers, and causing their people to lose power and influence in the nation their ancestors founded that person will be demonized as the worst sort of racist and white supremacist by the mass media, the university professors, the SPLC, and the ADL.</p>
