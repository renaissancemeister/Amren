<h1>New Ag Commissioner Wants Paintings Removed</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Atlanta Journal Constitution, December 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Commissioner-elect Gary Black [the incoming agriculture commissioner] told WXIA-TV that seven pictures in the lobby of the Agriculture Department in Atlanta will go into storage. The Republican takes office next month.</p>
<p>{snip} Two paintings depict slavery, which was allowed in Georgia until the practice was outlawed after the Civil War.</p>
<p>Another shows partially clothed American Indians.</p>
<p>Black said several scenes &#8220;are not acceptable today&#8221; and don&rsquo;t represent modern agriculture.</p>

		<p>What he doesn&rsquo;t understand is that these are surely meant to show how agriculture once was practiced, so that we can better appreciate the standards of agriculture that we have today, and what that has liberated those of us here in the USA from. What do the other paintings look like? Do they show modern agriculture. </p>

<i>&#8220;Black said several scenes &ldquo;are not acceptable today&rdquo; and don&rsquo;t represent modern agriculture.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>While the first painting doesn&rsquo;t represent contemporary agriculture, that the two are acceptable today is a matter of opinion. While not my favorite style of art, I see nothing wrong with the painting of Indians. European art of antiquity certainly showed more male and female skin.</p>
<p>Blacks love to tell us they were slaves. Why are they embarrassed or upset by seeing the truth they love to rub in our faces?</p>

		<p>This is not really about being &#8220;offended,&#8221; of course. After all, the paintings could just as easily be viewed as a &#8220;reminder of the grim reality of slavery in the United States,&#8221; and of the &#8220;noble red man from whom this land was taken.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, this whole brouhaha is about two things: grandstanding on the part of the agriculture commissioner to show how &#8220;upstanding&#8221; and &#8220;high-minded&#8221; he is, and the constant and never-ending hectoring of, and extraction of benefits from, the white man for things he did in the past.</p>
<p>Today, it&rsquo;s the removal of these paintings of Indians and slaves. Tomorrow, it&rsquo;s the removal of paintings of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, because, after all, they held slaves too.</p>

		<p>Why are we to think the first painting necessarily depicts slavery?  It should be sharecropping.  At either rate, the ONLY case I would entertain for removing the painting is that it isn&rsquo;t &#8220;acceptable today,&#8221; ONLY because it depicts black men doing honest work, which is mostly a fiction nowadays.<br>

<p><br>
So?  They don&rsquo;t pretend to  <b>represent modern agriculture.</b><br>
They are trying to show it as it was in the past.</p>
<p>And just  what, if anything, is inaccurate in the paintings? Those Indians in the painting were dressed as they would have been. That&rsquo;s  just reality, and denying it would be dishonest. </p>

		<p>What is bizzare about this is the fact that these paintings acknowledge that chattel slavery existed in the USA and that the opperation of the cotton gin was a factor in its expansion.  That is a matter of historical record.  So who really benefits by sweeping these facts under the carpet?  Perhaps it is Whites who will benefit as &#8216;reminders&rsquo; of why they are providing quotas to minoritiess are removed.  </p>
<p>Removing the paintings of bare breasted American Natives in their natural state is small minded and just inexplicably oafish.</p>

		<p>These are old murals, relics if you will. They are not meant to represent &ldquo;modern&rdquo; life.  Just look at the Greek statues upon courthouses, should we remove them since no one has worn such garb for thousands of years? </p>
<p>This is no different from Christians hiding or destroying pagan art. This is exactly the same thing that happened to The Rescue and Discovery, two classical statues that used to sit outside the US capitol building.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>How much more art will be packaged away and potentially destroyed to not offend anyone&rsquo;s delicate modern sensibilities? <br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m confused. Are these paintings supposed to remind me of the terrible history of slavery or how far whites have advanced agricultural practices? Never mind, just take my debit card and buy some paintings of blacks who have added to the significant advances in modern agricultural production. Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll wait.</p>

		<p>The irony is that in 5 years he will probably commission a multi-cult artist to paint nearly identical paintings to demonstrate the historic role blacks and indians have played in agriculture.</p>

		<p>A major platform of the Marxist is to tear down the history of the conquered. These insignificant paintings are only the first shot in the history we are to never speak about. Next will come statues and monuments to be destroyed and history to be rewritten. Then of course there will be laws protecting the new history. Of course Joe sixpack and Suzie Soccer mom wont mind because they would never want anyone to think them racist because you must always remember, like George Bush said, &#8220;you are either with us or against us.&#8221; So, what&rsquo;s it gonna be! </p>

		<p>This guy plans to run for higher office and he is sowing the seeds for support among non-whites.  These white men that sell out OUR history are sheer traitors and will do ANYTHING for a position in public office.  It&rsquo;s not like the paintings are propaganda.  For cyring out loud they depict actual history in America!</p>

		<p>So here in the 21st century, depictions of blacks actually being productive has officially been declared offensive. Might I suggest that they replace the offending artwork with something that more accurately reflects the &#8220;Black Experience&#8221; in modern-day America:<br>

Exactly. If the blacks were seasonal workers, the picture would look the same. <br>
And what&rsquo;s wrong with the Amerindian painting? Is it not correct in the ethnographic sense? Did the tribe dress differently then? If not, where&rsquo;s the problem?</p>

		<p>How much better off would the world be if a bunch of New England religious nuts hadn&rsquo;t decided they knew morality better than everyone else and demanded A WAR, among their nominally own kind, to prove it.</p>
<p>There were already signs that King Cotton had leached the rich Southern Soil to sand.  There were already signs that steam mechanization would mean the end of large, uneducated, labor forces on plantations.  There were already signs that Southerners themselves felt that this was the wrong way to go and they outnumbered the slave holders as 97% of the population.</p>
<p>But no, there will be no patience.  There will be no subsidies, conversion grants or industrial seed processes to wean the white South off of slave economics.</p>
<p>Instead, we get the costliest war in U.S. history in terms of lives lost.  We lose the -entire- cotton industry to the British who had no problems making Egyptians slaves to the same crop.</p>
<p>And we unleash this hideous mass of blacks on a nation whom nobody wants and who do not fit within a proto-industrial society which they are ill prepared to enter into as anything but what they already are: menial labor.  Ill treated and underpaid.</p>
<p>THAT is the tragedy of the first painting-  A failure to acknowledge and value the differences between the two types of cultures as genes present.  And how uplifting one meant damning all the rest of us.  For nothing.</p>
<p>The second paintings issue is simply that of a failure to recognize that what we have today, for all it&rsquo;s flaws, still has more potential than any neolithic idealized paradise straight out of Avatar.</p>
<p>An HG existence, even one supplemented by early subsistence agro, is a lifetime of hardship on the ragged edge of starvation and environmental collapse.  One which usually controls it&rsquo;s population numbers by means of brutal attrition and constant, internecine, war.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly not modern agriculture, but it should be a lesson in modern applied economics as racial and societal ethics.</p>
