<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20101214/US.Census.Somalis/">Survey: Nearly 1 in 3 US Somalis Live in Minnesota</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Comcast News, December 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nearly one in three people with Somali ancestry in the United States live in Minnesota, although some activists claim there are more.</p>
<p>{snip} The [Census] bureau&rsquo;s American Community Survey says there are about 25,000 people with Somali ancestry in Minnesota and about 85,700 in the United States.</p>
<p>The other states with large Somali populations are Ohio, Washington and California, but their communities are much smaller than Minnesota&rsquo;s.</p>

		<p>Canada has about an equal number, mainly concentrated just north of the border in Toronto and Ottawa.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve distinguished themselves as active street gang members, welfare fraudsters, and drug dealers.</p>
<p>They rate their own sections of municipal lockups, and are overrepresented among the unredeemable criminals to be deported from Canada.  </p>

		<p>There are also a lot of Hmong people living in MN. I have often thought that the last place you would want to send Somali and Hmong to live would be MN. TOO cold. But I guess that has not stopped anyone.</p>
<p>Much to the regret of many in MN., I assume, the folks there are too friendly and willing to help those on the down and out. REGRET?</p>

		<p>The goofy liberals who import these stone age people place them in areas that are overwhelmingly white.  This isn&rsquo;t done by accident. Why are these Somalians being dispersed to the US and Canada anyway?   </p>

		<p>I hope the good people of Minnesota come to their senses before it&rsquo;s too late, but I doubt they will. I live in a Southern state and got into a conversation with a lady from Minnesota who insisted that the Mexicans invading her state were not Mexicans, they were Texans! </p>
<p>She was dead serious, couldn&rsquo;t convince her otherwise.  </p>

		<p>This is an EXCELLENT place to send Somalis. Oregon is another good location. States full of nice gullible white liberals all eager to <br>
celebrate diversity. Portland almost had it first Islamic<br>
bombing at its annual Christmas tree lighting ceremony. <br>
Somalis have brought sex trafficking to Kentucky and shopping bomb <br>
plots to Cleveland.. liberal MultiCulturalism is bearing its<br>
exotic and poisonous fruit and the first to suffer will be the white liberals.<br>
Celebrate Diversity!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Somali gangs linked to sex ring&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;MINNEAPOLIS   &mdash;   Authorities are looking for suspects and potential victims in a Minnesota-based prostitution ring allegedly linked to Somali gangs that stretches to Tennessee, according to a search warrant affidavit briefly unsealed in state court in St. Paul.</p>
<p>The document, filed last Friday and obtained by KSTP-TV before it was placed under seal, alleges a 15-year-old girl was being controlled by Somali gangs and &#8216;promoted into prostitution.&rsquo; The document describes the sex ring as &#8216;large scale.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>

		<p>I live in Minnesota and I have to say, I really wish the Somalis would just leave. You can literally smell them from a block and a half away and I really wish I was joking. Apartment buildings inhabited by them are festering, broken down slums, while a mostly white apartment building in the same neighborhood will be clean and pleasant. <br>
I know because I live in one of the pleasant ones which is right next to the festering ones. </p>

		<p>Here in Utah the LDS church tends to take in misfits from all over the globe- not too many Somalis other Africans as well as South Pacific islanders from several countries and Islamic Europeans from Bosnia and Albania. There have also been groups of Volga Germans who speak a dialect that taxes interpreters who speak high German and ethnic Russians who have also had some trouble assimilating but at least these groups are starting to become absorbed and have mostly learned English. The Africans and Islanders OTOH, have seemed to absorb the ghetto culture (although there are few blacks in Utah) and blare loud hip hop music and act thuggish. The Muslims will NEVER assimilate and unfortunately they are becoming more and more radicalized, even before they arrive. All these groups tax the system and many of them join the LDS church with the aim of getting church welfare as well as government welfare. If anyone had not heard the LDS church will pay for food, rent or mortgage and clothing and other necessities IF a person attends regularly and pays their tithes. </p>

		<p>As other posters have pointed out on this site, why is it that black and latino immigrants are so drawn to urban american black hip hop gangsta rap culture?</p>
<p>What is the draw?  I don&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
