			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brad Knickerbocker, Christian Science Monitor, December 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Just a week ago, Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour was in hot water over an impolitic statement he made about the Citizens Council  &mdash;  the all-white group prominent during the 1960s when burning crosses and murdered civil rights workers were the main news out of his home state.</p>
<p>Today, Governor Barbour  &mdash;  frequently mentioned as a Republican candidate for the presidency in 2012  &mdash;  is being lauded as a &#8220;shining example&#8221; by the NAACP over another story that relates directly to the subject of race in the South.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Barbour suspended the life sentences of two black sisters who&rsquo;d already served 16 years for an armed robbery that netted $11.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This week, Barbour&rsquo;s suspending indefinitely the sentences of Gladys and Jamie Scott is winning him plaudits from African-American leaders.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a shining example of how governors should use their commutation powers,&#8221; said NAACP President Benjamin Jealous.</p>
<p>For years, critics (including the NAACP) have pointed to the Scott sisters&rsquo; case as unjust and possibly racially-tinged. Neither of the sisters, who were 20 and 21 at the time, had a prior criminal record. Three teenage boys involved in the armed robbery were sentenced to just two years and have since been released.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jamie Scott is in poor health and requires regular dialysis treatment. Gladys Scott has offered to donate a kidney to her sister.</p>
<p>Barbour&rsquo;s order says &#8220;Gladys Scott&rsquo;s release is conditioned on her donating one of her kidneys to her sister.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Jamie Scott&rsquo;s medical condition creates a substantial cost to the state of Mississippi,&#8221; Barbour also noted. Releasing the sisters from prison would relieve the state of paying for Jamie Scott&rsquo;s continued treatment.</p>
<p>While supporters of the Scott sisters applaud Barbour&rsquo;s move, some medical ethicists are raising questions  &mdash;  including the appearance of coercion in which Gladys Scott finally wins release but only if she undergoes what can be risky surgery.</p>
<p>&#8220;While Governor Barbour probably meant nothing nefarious by this decision, what he did was unethical and possibly illegal,&#8221; Michael Shapiro, chief of organ transplantation at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, told the Reuters news agency. &#8220;He is unaware of the procedures of transplantation that include making sure donors are not coerced.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If either party could be turned down for medical concerns, the transplant team would feel pressured to continue with the transplant or send them back to prison,&#8221; Dr. Shapiro said. &#8220;It is a position they should not be put in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Implying that the Citizens Councils burned crosses and murdered civil rights workers, which of course is not true.</p>
<p><i>For years, critics (including the NAACP) have pointed to the Scott sisters&rsquo; case as unjust and possibly racially-tinged. Neither of the sisters, who were 20 and 21 at the time, had a prior criminal record. Three teenage boys involved in the armed robbery were sentenced to just two years and have since been released.</i></p>
<p>I get the feeling that there is far more to this story than meets the eye with those words.  I tend to think that the sisters weren&rsquo;t quite as unfamiliar with the long arm of the law as these words suggest.  It is possible to be arrested, in fact multiple times, without racking up an official criminal record.  Maybe they did have a criminal record, but thanks to various &#8220;penance&#8221; programs like SIS, what records they had were wiped away from official view.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;This is a shining example of how governors should use their commutation powers,&rdquo; said NAACP President Benjamin Jealous.</i></p>
<p>Wrong.  It&rsquo;s a shining example of why so many people want pardon and commutation powers to chief executives limited or eliminated.  While I&rsquo;m not in favor of &#8220;eliminated,&#8221; (the CJ system isn&rsquo;t perfect, after all), what I would favor is clearing the gubernatorial or Presidential pardon or commutation through a simple majority of the legislative branch IF the pardon or commutation involves prison doors swinging open.</p>
<p>BTW, if you want a &#8220;shining example,&#8221; Mr. Jealous, I have two words for you:  Brian Aitken.</p>

		<p>I read where Haley Barbour is thinking of running for president.  Obviously, this little porker thinks he needs to play the racial/demographic cards in order to be someone for everyone.  In other words, just another political crook whose only real interest is in gaining power and position to satisfy his own sick ego.  John Bolton, also, is thinking of doing the same.</p>
<p>That they lack any kind of charisma or that they just don&rsquo;t posess any kind of presidential qualities seems to be lost on them, as it was on Bob Dole, John McCain and the many others of the same ilk who are all living proof that the political positions they&rsquo;ve held for so long inflates their egos so greatly they are blinded to their own shortcomings.</p>
<p>This system is dysfunctional, and the empire is in serious decline.</p>
<p>What Haley Barbour does or doesn&rsquo;t do or say, means absolutely nothing in the larger scheme of things.  This failed social experiment is just another empire that has become so currupt it can never recover by peaceful means.  And it won&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>I realize that I may get many of my fellow Amren posters upset with saying this but the fact is that governor Barbour should have freed these two women years ago. The evidence against them was flimsy at best, witnesses who testified had little credibility etc&hellip;</p>
<p>Secondly, while I am all for law and order, to give anyone a DOUBLE LIFE SENTENCE(DOUBLE MIND YOU)for armed robbery when no one was hurt and only eleven dollars!!! (this is just as ridiculous)was stolen is insane. Child predators, many murderers and in some cases, violent rapists do not receive such sentences. </p>
<p>The fact that neither woman had a prior criminal record - three years and two years probation (possible early parole for good behavior) would have been sufficient punishment.</p>
<p>There is no way in the world that such a draconian sentence should have been imposed.</p>

<p>Clearly, Ms. Scott is an indigent and now the federal government(taxpayers in the other 49 states) will pay for the substantial cost. </p>
<p>from the Clarion Ledger, Barbour targets Medicaid payouts:</p>
<p>&#8220;Gov. Haley Barbour is pushing to cut Medicaid payments to hospitals, nursing homes and other providers in a sweeping proposal that critics say could curtail access to health care.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which is it Haley, state rights conservative or supporter of a nationalized health insurance program?</p>

		<p>The irony is that no amount of sucking up to the NAACP will result in a Republican candidate getting a single extra vote, especially when standing against a black president.</p>

		<p>Another &#8216;shining example&rsquo; of course is Mike Huckabee who pardoned a multiple rapist who went on to murder four police officers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee on Tuesday defended his decision to commute the prison sentence years ago of the man who allegedly killed four police officers Sunday near Tacoma, Wash., saying the defendant had received an unfairly harsh sentence because he was young and black.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack Replies:</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what is going on here. Barbour is just doing this to take some of the heat off of him in the MSM for supposedly being an old fashion White Southerner who was/is &#8220;Racist&#8221;.</p>
<p>This act is like Pat Buchanan making his Reform Party VP a Black woman or Ron Paul getting on CNN with Wolf Blitzer and denying he wrote or even read &#8220;racist&#8221; comments in his own Ron Paul newsletter.</p>
<p>The power of the MSM, elite Lib/Min society is still such that all White Conservatives who want to be included in public life and not insulted all the time feel they must back down and accept the PC fundamentalist religious story that America pre 1965 was all evil, RACIST and MLK, the Civil Rights Movement the 1960s was the triumph of good over evil.</p>
<p>Barbour might as well have said that South Africa is worse now under Black rule than it was under White rule.</p>
