<h1>Deported Illegal Immigrants Return Repeatedly</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephanie Czekalinski, Columbus Dispatch, December 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Federal agents took an illegal immigrant to Grant Medical Center in October 2009 to collect proof of his ties to a Mexican-based drug ring.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Three months earlier, immigration agents had deported Mora to his homeland of Mexico. But the free ride home served as no deterrent. Since 2000, Mora has been deported four times, only to return time and again  &mdash;  most recently to Ohio.</p>
<p>A Dispatch investigation revealed that it is common for deported immigrants to return to the United States despite the threat of felony charges.</p>
<p>In another case, Juan Jose Beltran-Coronel&rsquo;s fourth trip to the border with immigration agents came after he was involved in a car crash in Kansas that killed his wife and exposed him as a human smuggler.</p>
<p>On 16 other occasions, Beltran was caught in the U.S. illegally and left on his own, court records show.</p>
<p>He served 5 1/2 years in prison and was shipped back to Mexico in 2002. Within three years, he was back, living in Preble County in western Ohio.</p>
<p>For Antonio Galloso, deportation came in 2005. By that time, Columbus police had charged him with domestic violence twice. But Galloso sneaked back to Columbus, where he sexually assaulted a woman.</p>
<p>A Franklin County judge sentenced him to community control  &mdash;  similar to probation. But U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents got him instead, and federal prosecutors charged him with illegally re-entering the country.</p>
<p>And ICE agents deported Guadalupe Wollum in 2007 after authorities caught her with more than 200 pounds of marijuana in Dayton. It took her a little more than three months to return to Montgomery County, in western Ohio, where federal agents found her again.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>All four immigrants eventually were sent to federal prisons for breaking immigration laws. They were sentenced to between four months and six years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Pat Tiberi, R-Genoa Township, said he plans to try to close the loophole that allows some immigrants to use deportation to avoid prosecution. That occurs when ICE deports an immigrant before local prosecutors can file charges.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very important for these agencies to establish a precedent for communicating and sharing information,&#8221; he wrote in an e-mail.</p>
<p>&#8220;There appears to be a fundamental disconnect between the judicial system and federal agencies like Immigrations and Customs Enforcement,&#8221; Tiberi [U.S. Rep. Pat Tiberi, R-Genoa Township] wrote. &#8220;I plan to work with the incoming chair of the Immigration Subcommittee to close this loophole and strengthen our borders.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aranda, Beltran and Galloso will be sent back home after serving time here. Woolum was deported after being released in January. And after paying to prosecute and imprison them, taxpayers again will foot the bill for their removal. According to an ICE spokeswoman, it costs $1,000 to &#8220;remove&#8221; someone, but she did not enumerate the expenses. The total cost is more than $6,000 for each deportation, according to ICE budget numbers.</p>
<p><b>Serious criminal histories</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prosecutors charged more than 100 immigrants this year in federal court in Columbus with returning illegally after being deported.</p>
<p>The number of prosecutions in federal court here has jumped from 16 in 2006 to 112 in 2010.</p>
<p>Federal authorities say they hope that the prospect of federal prison time will deter immigrants from sneaking back into the country.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Today, illegal re-entry cases represent about a third of the caseload for the federal public-defender&rsquo;s office, according to Gordon G. Hobson, a senior litigator for the federal public-defender&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Not everyone who comes back illegally and is caught a second time is prosecuted.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors say they&rsquo;re interested in bigger fish: people with serious criminal convictions in their pasts, those who were deported and then committed a crime after they sneaked back in or those who have been deported repeatedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The general focus is on the bad guys, the ones that are committing crimes while here illegally,&#8221; said Vipal J. Patel, district criminal chief for the U.S. attorney&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>Nationwide, the number of people prosecuted for coming back illegally after being deported has increased by 175 percent since 2005, according to a report by Syracuse University&rsquo;s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, or TRAC, which gathers and analyzes data from public agencies.</p>
<p>Even with the threat of prosecution, many still find re-entry worth the risk.</p>
<p>Javier H. Armengau, a Spanish-speaking Columbus lawyer who represents clients in immigration and criminal court.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&rsquo;t even count the number of clients that have been deported who came back in to say hello,&#8221; Armengau [Javier H. Armengau, a Spanish-speaking Columbus lawyer who represents clients in immigration and criminal court] said. &#8220;One the other day brought me a fruit basket. One brought me a potted plant.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Open and shut cases</b></p>
<p>To win a criminal re-entry case, federal prosecutors have to prove three facts: the identity of the defendant; that he or she previously was deported; and that that person later came back illegally.</p>
<p>Prosecutors often have a photo, signature and fingerprints taken by ICE or Border Patrol agents to prove the previous deportation.</p>
<p>The evidence that the person sneaked back into the U.S. often is seated at the defendant&rsquo;s table.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On average, defendants spend 13 months in federal prison before being deported again.</p>
<p>Jorge Vazquez-Gallardo was sent home once in 2007 and again in 2009. In September, ICE agents found him back in the country again. This time, he was in the Franklin County jail, charged with carrying a concealed weapon and drunken driving.</p>
<p>The weapons charge was dismissed in September, and Vazquez was to stand trial for drunken driving on Dec. 16.</p>
<p>When he didn&rsquo;t show up, a municipal court judge issued a warrant for his arrest.</p>
<p>But Vazquez had a good reason for not being there. He&rsquo;s serving a year  &mdash;  half the maximum sentence he could have received  &mdash;  in federal prison for illegal re-entry.</p>
<p>Normally, an illegal re-entry case would take about six months to resolve, said Bertha Duran, the attorney representing Vazquez. But his was put on a fast track.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Crime and punishment</b></p>
<p>Immigrant-rights activists say that some people in federal prison for sneaking back into the U.S. are not dangerous and don&rsquo;t belong there.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>ICE says it focuses on immigrants who are threats to safety and national security.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Studies disagree about whether illegal immigrants are more or less likely to commit crimes in the U.S.</p>
<p>In 2000, native-born men ages 18 to 39 were five times more likely to be imprisoned than immigrants of the same age, according to the Immigration Policy Center, a nonprofit group in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Immigrants, legal or illegal, make up 20 percent of inmates in prisons and jails, according to a 2009 study by the Center for Immigration Studies, also a Washington nonprofit group. In 2009, immigrants made up about 7 percent of the U.S. population, census data show.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Saint and sinner</b></p>
<p>Somewhere in the hills between Tijuana and San Diego, a 22-year-old from Guadalajara, Mexico, stepped over the border into the United States this past fall.</p>
<p>In doing so, this man with no criminal history committed a felony.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d been deported about two months earlier and was warned not to come back.</p>
<p>But he couldn&rsquo;t earn a living in Mexico, he said. He wanted to make sure that his two younger brothers still in Guadalajara will have more opportunity than he did.</p>
<p>The man lives with relatives in Columbus. He is among the estimated 120,000 illegal immigrants who were living in Ohio in 2009, according to the Pew Hispanic Center, a nonpartisan research group in Washington.</p>
<p>The man requested anonymity for fear of criminal prosecution and deportation.</p>
<p>He said that he respects U.S. laws, but that the current immigration system offers few visas for unskilled laborers and is unjust and unworkable.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Eight years after the man sneaked into the country, seven ICE agents came to the apartment he and two other men were sharing.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Neither he nor his roommates had heard of the person the agents sought, but they were detained and later deported when they couldn&rsquo;t prove legal status.</p>
<p>The man said that his time at home in Mexico was a welcome vacation. He visited with family, especially his mother, whom he hadn&rsquo;t seen in eight years.</p>
<p>Then he returned to the border to negotiate passage with one of the many coyotes just south of the border.</p>
<p>He used the $3,000 he&rsquo;d saved while working in construction in Columbus before he was deported.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another person who started walking across the border with the man and about nine others was lost in the hills. The coyote didn&rsquo;t stop to look for him, the man said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He said he saw evidence that coyotes and drug traffickers work together.</p>
<p>The coyotes were paying off traffickers, he said. In exchange, the drug dealers agreed not to kidnap their customers and extort money from their families.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the United Nations, about 20 percent of Mexicans who cross the Mexico-U.S. border illegally are caught.</p>

		<p>There is no way around it.  Welfare is the cause of this.  Welfare is what ALLOWS these guys have food, fuel and a place to live while living completely non-productive lives in the US.  But what drives them to WANT to come here is the welfare everyone else is on&hellip;.that is mostly funneled into the drug trade.</p>
<p>Bottom line.  They don&rsquo;t make money selling drugs to people with jobs.  They make a FORTUNE selling drugs to people who obtain that money through welfare.</p>
<p>Further, very little welfare is used legitimately.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to end it.  No, it&rsquo;s more than that.  We either end it now, or it will end in a couple years as our government collapses.  There is no choice in the matter as to if&hellip;.only when and how.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll notice the picture &#8220;scrolls.&#8221;  Each one of those cards is some sort of Missouri or Illinois state benefit card, either for food stamps or some other welfare benefit.</p>
<p>Ironically, putting welfare benefits on bank-style cards was supposed to eliminate this sort of thing, using welfare benefits as currency in the drug trade.  I suppose where there is a will to commit crime, there is way, and where there are ghetto blacks, there is a will to commit crime.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many times I&rsquo;ve said on here that the only way to end illegals is to go after those who are hiring them and renting houses to them. Without a job or a place to live they&rsquo;ll self-deport. They&rsquo;ll have to. And every time I say it someone pops off with some nonsense about &#8220;the only way to stop it is to defend the border and deport them&#8221;. Yeah. Well this article just showed how well that works.</p>
<p>The great thing about my solution is that states can enforce it themselves. Because heaven knows the feds aren&rsquo;t going to defend the border or deport them   &mdash;   at least not fast enough to do any good.</p>

		<p>Just think. In Muslim countries, first they&rsquo;d cut off his hand, then his other hand, and if he STILL came back, his head. Shari&rsquo;a law, I believe it&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>The only thingsaving this guy&rsquo;s neck (literally) is that non-Europeans worked for over 150 years to destroy our Western, Christian legal tradition. Now we have people oohing and aahhing over Noachide laws, which aren&rsquo;t helping the Palestinians much,so why should WE in the West enact them?</p>
<p>So, now we&rsquo;re damned if we do, and damned if we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Which only helps the criminals.<br>
Go fig.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d better go back to English Common Law, and hang all criminals from the highest tree, and have done with it. Our ancestors knew better than we&hellip;. far better.</p>

		<p>The problem is HOW we deport them.</p>
<p>First they should be taken to deportation camps and made to wait up to six months before a boat is ready.</p>
<p>Then they should go on a slow horribly seasick 2 week boat ride to the southern most tip of mexico.</p>
<p>Thats how we used to do it. </p>
<p>Dropping them off in tiajuana so they can skip over the border the next day makes no sense at all.</p>

		<p>I hate to be logical - it&rsquo;s something our government doesn&rsquo;t recognize, but may I offer a suggestion? How about taking these worthless human beings and put them to work building the strongest fence anyone has ever known? Double-layered and backed up with armed US military forces. I think that would stop the invasion from that side. Then, announce to the world that we will no longer be their dumping ground. When illegals are found, their home countries will no longer receive US funds (we think we have to support the world). Then, stop all benefits. That should cause self-deportation. Continue this program until these people learn we are not here to provide them livlihoods. It&rsquo;s up to their countries. And, above all, stop the foolish birthright citizenship fiasco. They are not &#8220;under the jursidiction&#8221; of the US. This can be accomplished with very little money and billions less than it cost taxpayers who have to support them while they send their money home. Insane, isnt&rsquo; it?</p>

		<p>This article paints a disturbing picture of many illegals roaming the country at will, finding their way into our criminal justice system and then, through this process of deportation and re-entry, becoming a transient criminal underclass.</p>
<p>Our government&rsquo;s unwillingness to enforce its laws and secure its borders is having the effect of de-legitimizing itself. If we don&rsquo;t show that we care, then these criminal migrants certainly have no reason to be deterred. It&rsquo;s a sad, self-inflicted state of affairs.</p>

The average mestizo is as corrupt at sea as he is on land.<br>
On any given day hundreds of small boats line the Mexican coast carrying their stash of cocain and other narcotics.<br>
The Navy&rsquo;s counter drug ops in Mexico puts our sailors between a rock and a hard place because we are forced to operate under the guise of political correctness.<br>
That means both the small boats and ships sit side-by-side during the day until a contact makes a move and gets chased down at 15 knots before we go out on liberty and have a beer at the same bar.<br>
The Navy could end drug dealing on the coast by opening up on these small boats with MK-38 25mm machine guns.<br>
I feel that since the situation will only continue to swell well into the next decade its only a matter of time.</p>

		<p>Illegal immigrants should be tattooed on the backs of their right hands with the date of their deportation. When they are sent back to their countries they will serve as evidence that the United States is serious about enforcing immigration laws. If they return to the United States they will be identified immediately.  </p>

		<p>The one thing about border security is that it doesn&rsquo;t get any more &#8216;official&rsquo;.  Here is yours, here is ours, there is no free entry, and we _mean it_.  Double fence lines with a _legally_ mined lane in-between.</p>
<p>It is also a signal to Americans, from Americans that it&rsquo;s put up or shut up time.  No more weenie laws that can be changed after adoption or watered down in application.  A border fence means we must agree to be proud of America as the PEOPLE who built it.  By history, by genetics, by population mass, that is not hispanics.</p>
<p>America should stand as a symbol, not fall as a destination for the unwelcomed.  And the ultimate understanding of this is simple: if you won&rsquo;t breed with them, everyone that earns a paycheck from you takes away money from the white economic pie which will _never return_.  Because they don&rsquo;t make use of the same services you do.  They have no intention of paying taxes for those services.</p>
<p>And anyone who says otherwise is a fool.</p>
<p>Given dedication and a narrow enough focus, we can export &#8216;The Dream&rsquo;.  But we can only import the nightmare.  The global tide of population ratios mass prevents anything less.</p>
<p>WHY then is it that libtards never consider making another nation an &#8216;example&rsquo; of The Dream moving -outwards-, one nation at a time?  Could it be, secretly, that they know it&rsquo;s as hopeless as we do?</p>

		<p>Tattooing is a good idea. A better one would be to inject a chip into their shoulder loaded with all their personal/criminal history and deportation date that can be read with a scanner. We have the technology for this now. The cost would not be prohibitive. And combined with #8.&rsquo;s suggested deportation method of yore would make for a much more effective deportation than the silly way they do it now.</p>
