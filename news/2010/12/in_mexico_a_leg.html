			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nick Miroff and William Booth, Washington Post, Dec. 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In this dusty farm town, an hour south of the U.S. border, more than 40 people were abducted  &mdash;  one a week  &mdash;  in the first nine months of the year. </p>
<p>Then, on Sept. 21, the kidnappings stopped. </p>
<p>That was the day a gang of kidnappers with AK-47s burst into Lolo&rsquo;s seafood restaurant and tried to abduct the 17-year-old cashier. A mob of enraged residents chased down two of the teenage attackers and lynched them in a cotton field on the edge of town. </p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re not proud of what happened,&#8221; said Georgina &#8220;Coca&#8221; Gonzalez, who helped form an armed citizens&rsquo; group after the incident to fight crime and prevent kidnappings. &#8220;But we&rsquo;re united now  &mdash;  the whole town. And we all want justice.&#8221; </p>
<p>Across the country, and especially in northern Mexico, the breakdown of the legal system is giving way to a wave of vigilante violence. As Mexicans grow frustrated with the depredations of drug mafias and the corruption and incompetence of authorities, some are meting out punishment the old-fashioned way, taking an eye for eye, or in some cases, an eye for a tooth. </p>
<p>Some of these retributive acts have happened spontaneously, such as the Ascencion &#8220;uprising,&#8221; as many here have celebrated it. But other killings in the past year appear to have been carried out by shadowy forces who have left bodies along highways or hanging from bridges with handwritten notes that advertise the dead as &#8220;extortionists&#8221; or &#8220;kidnappers.&#8221; </p>
<p>Mexico has a long history of rough justice carried out by citizens, but it has traditionally occurred in isolated villages, in the mountains or jungles, often among Mexico&rsquo;s indigenous peoples. </p>
<p>Today, vigilante groups appear to be at work even in major cities. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Social cleansing&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>In Ciudad Juarez, the epicenter of violence, murder suspects seem more likely to end up dead than appear before a judge. Several days after gunmen massacred 13 people at a party there in October, two heads were found in plastic bags on the hood of a car with a note warning, &#8220;This is what happens to those who kill women and children.&#8221; </p>
<p>A group of Mexican senators has called for an investigation into extrajudicial killings in the country, alleging that &#8220;death squads&#8221; of current and former soldiers and police were to blame for some of the more than 30,000 killings since President Felipe Calderon declared war on the country&rsquo;s drug cartels four years ago. </p>
<p>According to Sen. Ricardo Monreal, wealthy business families have hired former police and soldiers to guard their interests and protect them from kidnapping and extortion. Some of the paramilitary-style groups work as contract killers for the drug cartels, the senator said; others might work as freelancers for the families of victims, who are seeking revenge or tired of paying extortion. Finally, some may be engaged in a kind of &#8220;social cleansing&#8221; aimed at low-level gang members, petty criminals and drug addicts. </p>
<p>Gustavo de la Rosa, a top human rights official in Chihuahua, Mexico&rsquo;s most violent state, said the flood of killings and other crimes in recent years has resulted in the &#8220;collapse&#8221; of the legal system, leaving frustrated citizens to view raw vengeance as their only recourse. </p>

		<p>The rule of Law is the foundation of civilization; if the common folk are reduced to meting out justice on their own then that flies in the face of the forces of the law, like the police and judges. The frontier justice will actually harm the respect by the people for the police and the legal system in general, and bring about more and more of this vengeance killing.<br>
    Eventually a strong man will emerge in Mexico who will crack down on everybody, kidnapper and victims alike, and stop the killing, at a cost of many, many lives, most of whom will be innocent people, not criminals. But the terrible example has to be made, unfortunately, so as to return to the rule of Law.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t really know what to make of this report, except to conclude that, since it came from the Washington Post, a publication well-known for telling many lies, vigilanteism and the neighborhood watch groups are probably not as common or widespread as the Post wants us to believe.</p>
<p>Some citizen justice surely occurs, but probably not as this far left publication describes.</p>
<p>If we are to believe what is reported, it would appear that, between the corrupt officials and police, the drug gangs and other criminal groups, Mexico is on the verge of imploding any day now from lawlessness.</p>

		<p>Why is the WaPo and others so quick to assume that these are legitimate attempts at vigilante justice, and not disguised hits from rival gang bangers?  This is Mexico we&rsquo;re talking about here.  Even the &#8220;legitimate&#8221; law enforcement, when they make an arrest, are usually secretly doing the bidding of one drug gang or another.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Members of the armed citizens&rsquo; group in Ascencion said they&rsquo;re not trying to challenge the drug cartels or interfere with their smuggling operations, which would be suicidal. But they said they can no longer abide the kidnappings, rapes, shakedowns and other abuses that have terrorized residents.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is interesting&hellip;the citizens&rsquo; group is not trying to defeat the cartels or hamper their chief operations, but is apparently hoping that the cartels won&rsquo;t think it worth their while to overwhelm the citizens&rsquo; groups&rsquo; defenses against personal crimes that affect citizens most directly.</p>
<p>We might take a lesson from this, and instead of thinking in terms of how to solve the entire problem of our country, or at least its entire racial problem, try to think of some particular items of importance to us that the system pitted against us might be inclined to overlook as not being of primary importance to it.<br>

		<p>When the government not only fails to protect us from violent invaders, when it favors them over us, there is no other option but one. That is vigilante justice because the rule of law has no credibility any more, followed by civil war. That is what&rsquo;s underway in Mexico right now, an armed insurrection on the part of these drug fiends but there will be citizens there opposing both them and the corrupt narco-government Mexico is saddled with. This is going to spill over into the U.S. because of these criminal invaders, sooner than later!</p>

		<p>So many here are so critical about this, and saying that they are wrong, and that the respect for the rule of law is gone.</p>
<p><br>
What you are missing is that these vigilantes are not criminals in the common sense. They are in fact trying to make the rule of law apply, where the government has faield to do so.</p>
<p>The irony is, that if this continues, and the mexican government doesn&rsquo;t stomp down on it hard, these areas are likely to be less plagued by violence and crime than equivalent places in Europe and North America.</p>
<p>The Wild West wasn&rsquo;t all that wild, vigilante justice and access to guns for everyone meant that the criminals got stopped very quickly and very definetly.</p>
<p>People do not become savage criminals because they get guns and form into militias to protect themselves, their children and their community.</p>
<p>If communities did the same in Europe and North America, forming &#8220;vigilante&#8221; groups that punished those that rob, rape and assault our sons, daughters and friends, then these crimes would stop very quickly.</p>
<p>Yes, a few innocent might get swept up, but exactly how innocent are they?<br>
Lots of people that commit crimes are considered innocent by the courts since there is a lack of evidence.</p>
<p>If your daughter was raped, who would you believe? Her?<br>
Or the 3-4 men she points out that all say she had been drinking a little and was in on it all along?</p>
<p></p>
<p>The &#8220;problem&#8221; is of course that communities rely on being the same, those that are &#8220;different&#8221; are the ones primarily targeted. Which is ususually because they commit a lot of the crime.<br>
Was the south safer under Jim Crow? Why?</p>
<p>Yes, blacks will suffer, if the communities start to clamp down on the crime and criminals, as well as white criminals.<br>
And the authorities won&rsquo;t like that, they are willing to accept high crime rates with thousands of victims, as long as they can be in control.</p>
<p>Vigilantism means going back to the old days, when sheriffs protected their communities instead of the government, when communities where united and looked after one another.<br>
Large crime gangs that hide behind the law, would no longer be a problem, since normal citizens wanting law and order will always outnumber these, and with access to firearms will be able to defeat them.</p>
<p>These mexicans are tired of corruption and a government agenda that doesn&rsquo;t favor them.<br>
Are you tired of the same thing yet?</p>

And I&rsquo;m starting to think it may be the answer for us as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>A benign dictator for us who rules based on common sense?  Yes, I&rsquo;ve often thought that might be the way to go, especially since the whites here keep electing Senators, representatives, and presidents to Washington who are against them in many ways.  Just look at how long Kennedy served and how much damage he did to whites.  Look at Durbin, Harkin, Boxer, Feinstein, Reid, Pelosi, Frank, etc., to name but a few among the worst.</p>
<p>There are just too many do-gooders and dupes in the white population to effectively govern themselves.  Too, there are too many wealthy activists who have the ability to twist society into one of their own perverted making, like George Soros and those who control the media and entertainment industry.</p>
<p>If a pro-white, benign dictatorship had been in place after WWII, I doubt that blacks would be whining their usual songs and affirmative action would never had come into existence.  Too, it&rsquo;s entirely possible blacks might have gravitated to their own area of the country with the right incentives, and the country would still be about 90% white.</p>
<p>Since we&rsquo;re in the process of empire decline and break-up right now, having a pro-white, common sense dictator doesn&rsquo;t sound so bad.<br>

		<p>The action does not suprise me just that it took so long.  Go back and look at Columbia and the Medellin Drug Cartel war in the 1990&rsquo;s.  There was a group of Citizens/Police called &#8220;Los Pepes&#8221; who started killing anyone associated with Carlos Escobar and in the end helped take down the Cartel.</p>
<p>If you go back in our history in the 1800&rsquo;s same thing happened here, as it has been done thoughout History. If a Govenment can not or will not protect its citizens the citizens will protect themselves.</p>
<p>What I wonder is how long it will take or what will trigger this type of action to take place in the American Southwest.  If you go back and look at news articles in the last year or two you will find articles about the Fed Govt prohibiting US citizens from federal land in Arizona due to drug violence.  Who would have ever thought we would ever have a formal govenment policy restricing access due to them not being able to control an area im the United States and then doing nothing to take control of that area.</p>

<p>Very much so, and we are not alone.  Unless things take a turn away from the current course down which our elites are trying to lead us (there is still time, brother), the current situation in Mexico must inevitably begin to replicate itself here.  The elites are terrified of this, and are scrambling frantically to legislate and propagandize us into paralysis before it can happen.</p>
<p>We must all hope and work for the best, but never fail to prepare for the worst.<br>

		<p>Everyone should remember, the American Revolution was started by &#8220;vigilantes&#8221;. </p>
<p>When government fails to protect citizens, it is their right and duty to set up alternate methods and structures on their own. </p>
<p>There is absolutely nothing wrong with citizens fighting back. It is desireable when a country as collapsed. They need to keep organizing and rebuilding alternate structures to eventually replace the government. </p>
<p>Another thing to remember: why are there so many drug gangs that have taken over whole countries? </p>
<p>When the Marxist / Liberals succeeded in destroying American culture and traditions, the result was an enormous appetite for drugs and alcohol. </p>
<p>America&rsquo;s insatiable lust for drugs is what is creating all the violence and destruction. </p>
<p>We must rebuild the culture before there is any hope of saving the current political corruption. </p>

		<p>Like so many other &#8220;enlightened&#8221; countries, Mexico does not have the death penalty for even the most heinous crimes.  When the Federales occasionally manage to capture, try, and convict a cartel bigwig they are incarcerated in prisons completely controlled by the cartels.  Inmates with connections and money have unlimited access to sex, drugs, liquor, fine food and every other imaginable luxury.  They generally manage to maintain their criminal enterprises from behind the walls and have absolutely no incentive to change their ways.<br>
Given the situation, vigilantism is the people&rsquo;s only viable option when the government refuses to mete out justice.<br>
