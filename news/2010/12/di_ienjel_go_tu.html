<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>They say the Bible is best understood in a person&rsquo;s mother tongue. But in the Caribbean they&rsquo;ve had to put up with the stuffy English King James version for centuries.</p>
<p>Now, in a mark of its independent spirit, Jamaica has come up with a translation in patois  &mdash;  the island&rsquo;s own unofficial language.</p>
<p>One of the first stories getting the Creole treatment is the traditional Christmas tale.</p>
<p>In the depiction of the Angel Gabriel&rsquo;s visit to Mary, the New King James Bible&rsquo;s version of Luke reads: &#8216;And having come in, the angel said to her, &#8220;Rejoice, highly favoured one, the Lord is with you; blessed are you among women&#8221;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the patois version, it becomes: &#8216;Di ienjel go tu Mieri an se tu ar se, &#8220;Mieri, mi av nyuuz we a go mek yu wel api. Gad riili riili bles yu an im a waak wid yu aal di taim.&#8221;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Proponents of the Jamaica Bible Society patois version argue that since many islanders have difficulty understanding standard English, it is wrong to have the holy book in a &#8216;foreign&rsquo; tongue.</p>
<p>&#8216;Di ienjel go tu Mieri an se tu ar se, &#8220;Mieri, mi av nyuuz we a go mek yu wel api. Gad riili riili bles yu an im a waak wid yu aal di taim.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most of the words in Jamaican patois are English words filtered through a distinct phonetic system with fewer vowels and different consonant sounds. </p>
<p>Clergy on the island said the patois gospel had gone down a storm. Pastor Lloyd Millen said: &#8216;People feel liberated. They say they are able to visualize the Bible better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A patois translation of the entire New Testament is expected in August 2012, to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Jamaica&rsquo;s independence.</p>
<p>&#8216;The Scriptures have the greatest impact when you hear it in your mother tongue. So this translation to Creole is affirming the Jamaican speaker&rsquo;s language, and it is very, very powerful,&rsquo; said the Rev. Courtney Stewart, general secretary of the Bible Society of the West Indies.</p>
<p>Last week, a local radio station broadcast the patois renditions of Luke every morning, and its Nativity story translation is popping up at Christmas parties. </p>
<p>Members of a church in Spanish Town, just west of Kingston, have even started to memorize it.</p>
<p>Nearly all Jamaicans, regardless of class, speak patois - a mixture of English and West African tongues spoken by slaves who were brought to this Caribbean island by European colonizers. It rarely exists in written form.</p>
<p>Some Anglophiles on the island call patois &#8216;lazy English&rsquo; and dismiss it as a vernacular.</p>
<p>On a page of the Jamaica Gleaner&rsquo;s Web site, a critic named Jo Bent said, &#8216;Patois is not an official language, it has no dictionary, are we to further confuse our youths when most have not mastered English yet?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The bible society has launched a public education campaign to win over skeptics in Jamaica.</p>
<p>&#8216;Many people are skeptical about the bible translation work until they actually hear it. Then they cease being resistant,&rsquo; said Hubert Devonish, a linguistics professor at the University of the West Indies.<br>

<p>??? That is the best I can translate it.</p>
<p>Intelligent Jamaicans deplore this nonsense; but the sad fact is that a language reveals much about a culture&rsquo;s soul and the way they think. </p>
<p>Lazy and sloppy. Much like the public schools here in America, and for the same reasons.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t find this alarming, as the bible has been translated to many languages.  As long as the core values of social responsibility and individual respect are taught, I would think the teachings of the bible remain whole and the Christian mission is accomplished. </p>

		<p>I have seen patois signs on the buses in Fort Lauderdale. At first, I had no idea what they were and couldn&rsquo;t figure them out. I didn&rsquo;t recognize any such language. Then, I noticed the similarity to many French words, but bizarrely spelled and used. It certainly wasn&rsquo;t French!  But kind of. Then I realized it was Haitian.</p>
<p>What advantage do they expect to get, these Haitian and Jamaican patois-speakers?   The &#8220;language&#8221; can only be used among themselves.  It&rsquo;s like Papiamento, which is used only in Curacao and Aruba. For communication with the outside world, it&rsquo;s totally useless. To have any kind of education or career, or even to read a mazazine or book, or watch a movie, they still have to learn an outside, major language. Why waste their time on such nonsense? If you&rsquo;re going to learn a language, learn a real one!</p>
<p>Well, on second thought,  I say let them have their dialects, if that&rsquo;s what they want. It further reinforces their separateness and keeps them away from us. It&rsquo;s their own choice, and it&rsquo;s fine with me. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m no Christian, but oddly enough, I&rsquo;ve never found that I was forced to &#8220;put up with&#8221; the &#8220;stuffy&#8221; King James Bible whenever I wanted to read Christian scripture.  Am I an Evil Racist for wondering if the King James Bible wouldn&rsquo;t seem &#8220;stuffy&#8221; to anyone with at least a room-temperature IQ?</p>

<p>Uhhh&hellip; Sure.  No doubt Jamaica will be the source of the next generation of profound theologians.  </p>

		<p>So, translate the KJV into the Jamaican version of American ghetto-ese?  Yeah, that will get the message across real well I&rsquo;m sure.  After all, the American Ghetto bible (forget what it is called but there is one) has done so well in bringing Christ&rsquo;s full nature into the hearts of the ghetto, hasn&rsquo;t it?  Do they even know He was God with us, or do they think he was just some social gospel preacher dude?  The latter, I suspect.</p>

		<p>I think that is understandable.  After all, reading that translation leads me to conclude that &#8220;ptois&#8221; is so far from King James English that a Jamaican person probably can&rsquo;t understand most of the King James Bible anyway.  I don&rsquo;t know why they used an English bible for so long; the difference between the bible&rsquo;s English and Jamaican patois seems about as great as the differences between English and Dutch, or maybe even English and French.</p>
<p>But it is funny to read their language; it sounds just like jive-talk to me.  In fact, when I read that I was reminded of the scene from Airplane where the old white lady speaks jive with the two black passengers.</p>

		<p>Do the Jamaicans have no language of their own? This patois isn&rsquo;t a language, it&rsquo;s merely a corrupted form of English for those who apparently aren&rsquo;t smart enough to master English.  Just wait for words of this patois to filter into our own language, and to be hailed as a glorious &#8220;enriching&#8221; of English.</p>

		<p>This is a moot point. While I sympathize with using language the little educated can understand, I don&rsquo;t think using the phonetic spelling is advisable. </p>
<p>The sentence:&lsquo;Di ienjel go tu Mieri an se tu ar se, &ldquo;Mieri, mi av nyuuz we a go mek yu wel api. Gad riili riili bles yu an im a waak wid yu aal di taim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>would be as well understood as: The angel go to Mary, an say to her say, &#8220;Mary, me have news we a go make you well happy, God really, really bless you and him a walk with you all the time&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the dialect that the Jamaicans are familiar with, but reinforces their standard English competence. </p>

<p>Gee whiz, no &#8216;overt bias&rsquo; in THIS article!</p>
<p>As a cleric who came to love Christ and Western Culture via (the AV and) the Book of Common Prayer, I can honestly say that the KJV is, and still remains, the bedrock of English Language, literature, and literacy. Because the translators were fluent in Greek and Latin, they made an &#8220;Anglo-Saxon&#8221; version of the Latinate grammar of Medieval Europe, that lasted for five hundred years. Only the LXX offers the same &#8216;staying power&rsquo; in the Greek Church, and it&rsquo;s not &#8216;greek&rsquo; to them!</p>
<p>With the &#8216;Deliberate Dumbing Down of American Education&rsquo; (Isserbyt) to below the level of an eighth grader during my era (1960&rsquo;s) and now asking the question, &#8216;Are you smarter than a fifth grader?&rsquo; in this century, clearly the desire for an illiterate, unintelligent, and docile populace that the Spinmeisters can control, is the desired &#8216;outcome&rsquo; of NCLB, Head Start, and all the rest.</p>
<p>It once was normative that college students knew/studied Latin, and read the KJV in their English classes. But that was also when we were White, at the top of the world in production and science, and had almost no crime in over 95% of the cities in these dis-United States. Coincidence? Maybe we ALL need to go back to &#8220;&hellip;In the Beginning.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>I expected the usual commentary.  There is nothing wrong with Jamaican Patois and nothing wrong with translating the Bible into the vernacular.</p>
<p>Languages - all languages - change over time.  Languages die out and new languages develop.  New languages often start when people who speak different languages mingle.</p>
<p>Creoles are very common.  They are as legitimate as English or French or any other, more widely spoken tongue.  </p>
<p>The Romance languages developed from Latin, as it evolved over time.  They differ because of isolation and local influences.  Does the president of France speak good French?  I would say yes.  But some earlier posters, if they are consistent, would have to say no, he is speaking a degenerate form of Latin.</p>
<p>Does the queen speak good English?  Again, I would say yes, but others would have to say she speaks a bastard tongue, formed from an ignorant blend of German, Danish, French, etc.</p>

		<p>Also, I saw the phrase &#8220;lazy and sloppy.&#8221;  I would like to hear this poster speak.  I wonder if he ever says &#8220;I&rsquo;m gunna&#8221; instead of &#8220;I am going to&#8221; or (for that matter) instead of &#8220;I shall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lazy and sloppy.</p>
<p>And when he says &#8220;matter&#8221; does he really say &#8220;maTTer&#8221; with Ts or does it really come out as &#8220;madder&#8221;?</p>
<p>Lazy and sloppy.</p>
<p>Does he say &#8220;TuesDAY&#8221; or &#8220;Tuesdy&#8221;?  If he says &#8220;Tuesdy&#8221; he is lazy and sloppy but very normal.</p>
<p>Take a word like &#8220;through.&#8221;  Ever notice the &#8220;gh&#8221; at the end?  Ever wonder why they are there?  Once the would ended with a consonant sound, but now we all say &#8220;thru.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Lazy and sloppy?  No.  This is how language works.</p>

		<p>GB #11  &mdash;  it might be how language works, but it is STILL lazy and sloppy!</p>
<p>I would also posit that language evolves differently for blacks and Whites  &mdash;  I think that Whites are largely visual, while blacks are mainly auditory. That is why they had very, very few (if any at all) languages in written form in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>A written language provides an anchor, of sorts, for the preservation of a language&rsquo;s grammar and syntax, and keeps it from going every which way, pulled by whatever group. It shows a LACK of laziness, and a dedication to an orderly system. In so doing, it shows consideration to the speakers, writers and listeners of the language. </p>
<p>I understand what you are saying, within limits. The famous &#8220;be&#8221; saying of blacks  &mdash;  that language is actually in the Miller&rsquo;s Tale in Chaucer&rsquo;s Canterbury Tales, where one of the characters says something like (I don&rsquo;t feel like looking it up, so forgive my example) &#8220;If a man be a man &hellip;  &#8221; or something of the sort.  </p>
<p>It was in standard use at the time, among certain of the populace. Whites, of course, don&rsquo;t use that construction today.   </p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re referring to the Subjunctive Case, which is perfectly correct and is still in use, though diminished  (conditions in question, uncertain, or contrary to fact).</p>
<p>&#8220;If he  WERE a millionaire&#8221; (but he&rsquo;s not)&hellip; &#8220;When he WAS a millionaire&#8221; (which he was, in fact)&hellip;<br>
&#8220;If I WERE there now&#8221; (but I am not)&hellip; &#8220;When I WAS here yesterday&#8221; (which I really was)&hellip; <br>
&#8220;Let it BE so!&#8221; (but it is not so)&hellip;<br>
&#8220;Long LIVE the king!&#8221;  (a hope, not a fact) &hellip; but: &#8220;The king LIVES very well.&#8221; (a fact).</p>
<p>It is more common in other European languages today, but tending to fade out from modern English. </p>
<p>The blacks who use &#8220;be&#8221; (but more often often mis-use it) did not invent that usage. They picked it up from people around them whom they heard speaking Elizabethan English.  But when they say: &#8220;I be Latrisha&#8221;, that is incorrect.  (Unless there is some doubt that she really is Latrisha!!!)</p>

		<p>I understand your point, ghw, though what I was refering to was the &#8220;I be &hellip; &#8221; sayings of certain blacks, which is not correct and is not used by Whites in this country, though I would not be surprised to hear it in Liverpool. Well, maybe certain Whites in Appalachia still use it, also.</p>
<p>What many people think of a black dialect sounds like the way pirates are portrayed as talking  &mdash;  &#8220;I be a dead man soon if you be not Captain Rogers!&#8221; etc. I think there must be a reason that pirates are portrayed as talking this way. I think the lower class English or Irish must have talked this way for this conception to be so prevalent.</p>
<p>Also in the Canterbury tales, again in The Miller&rsquo;s Tale, is the word &#8220;axed&#8221; used instead of &#8220;asked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8221; &hellip;  if that men axed him in certain houres<br>
         Whan that men shoulde have droughte or elles showres, <br>
         Or if men axed him what shal befalle<br>
         Of every thing  &mdash;  -I may nat rekene hem alle.&#8221; <br>
         (The Miller&rsquo;s Tale, vv. 86-90)</p>
<p>I have always thought that blacks&rsquo; talking this way was rather charming, and not offensive like Ebonics. After all, it is OUR olde English.</p>

<p>Good points about the subjunctive mood.  (That is mood, not case, btw, but your points are right on target.  This is one example of a language changing.  Usages which at one time would have made teachers cringe are now accepted.  The subjunctive mood is about to disappear.  Written languages change more slowly than an unwritten ones, but they do change.  And such change is not indicative of degeneracy.  </p>
<p>If I were an unkind person, I would call some of the other posters ignorant.</p>

<p>Ah, yes, you are right. &#8220;Mood&#8221; it is. It&rsquo;s many years since I&rsquo;ve cracked open a grammar book.</p>
<p>Our language is being steadily streamlined. In Fenimore Cooper&rsquo;s novels, he refers to &#8220;a leathern pouch&#8221;. Today, we would say &#8220;leather&#8221;, although we still say a &#8220;woolen&#8221; sweater (or wool) or a &#8220;wooden&#8221; bucket (but not wood). The awkward transition is incomplete.</p>
<p>In Spanish, the subjunctive is still widely used (at least in Spain). Students often consider Spanish an easy language, but that is only until they get to the subjunctive where it gets complicated. </p>
<p>French is tending to follow the English pattern towards simplification.  There has been a movement in France to simplify the language, specifically intended to accommodate the immigrants and minorities who have difficulty with its complexities. </p>
<p>Personally, I find this regrettable, as we are losing the refinement and subtlety of our language(s) in the interest of dumbing everything down for the benefit of third worlders, whereas we should be requiring them to be lifted up to our standards.  Well, that&rsquo;s my opinion.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we might as well revert to speaking pidgin or something like &#8220;Basic English&#8221; (advocated by Winston Churchill) with its 1000 word vocabulary that suffices for everything (or 2000 words allowed for the learned).</p>
<p>#15, I doubt that use of the subjunctive had any class connection to the &#8220;lower class English or Irish&#8221;, as you speculate. If anything, it was probably the educated classes who used it most. Certainly, Chaucer was not of the uneducated classes. But I can&rsquo;t authoritatively comment on that.</p>

		<p>GB, French is NOT a degenerate Latin.</p>
<p>I have been studying French for almost 18 months. It is  a beautiful language, and I grasp it very readily, due to the fact that I studied Latin in high school and college. I have already caught up to those who have been studying French for four years.</p>
<p>But the French also have a very highly respected commission that safeguards their language, and approves changes to it only after long and careful considerations.</p>
<p>The French language is not left to dangle in the winds, blown this way and that by whomever wills it. In other words, my friend, it is NOT democratic.</p>
<p>I find it hard to believe that you are championing patois, when English is available to those people, and they have not even grasped the essentials of it!</p>
<p>Do you champion Ebonics here in America, when the blacks that speak it have not even grasped the essentials of English? </p>
<p>This is a shameful philosophical position, and I am appalled that you have let yourself be maneuvered into it.</p>
