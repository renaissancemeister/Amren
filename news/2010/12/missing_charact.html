<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As the Muslim student population grows in Minnesota, some educators detect a glaring gap: a dearth of books the students can relate to and from which others can learn.</p>
<p>&#8220;There wasn&rsquo;t a whole lot in our library that provided a sense of &#8216;this is what&rsquo;s normal,&rsquo;&#8221; said Julie Scullen, a reading intervention specialist at Northdale Middle School in Coon Rapids, where she took stock of books about Muslims growing up in America.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many educators say it&rsquo;s critical for students to have books in which they can see themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is extremely important for young people to read stories reflecting their ethnicity and/or religion in order to feel like worthwhile human beings,&#8221; said Freda Shamma, director of curriculum development for the Foundation for the Advancement and Development of Education and Learning, based in Cincinnati.</p>
<p>&#8220;The absence of such stories leads to poor grades in school, feelings of loneliness and alienation, and low self-esteem,&#8221; said Shamma, who is working on an anthology of Muslim literature directed at middle-school-age students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Books oriented toward Muslim students are apparently more common at some grade levels than others. &#8220;They&rsquo;re easier to find for elementary kids,&#8221; said Lori Saroya, president of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) Minnesota. &#8220;There are a number of books out there focusing on Ramadan [the Muslim holy month], but they&rsquo;re more targeted for younger kids. I&rsquo;ve heard of some series of fiction books for junior high kids, but they are difficult to find.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Because these Muslim students are in Minnesota, a Western and white region where the students are often living in the culture of well, their ancestors.<br>
It is not natural for these children to move and live amongst whites. That is why there are not Muslims in the books, because they are not in a Muslim region. If these children were raised in Egypt, Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia, etc, etc they would find storybook Muslims in no short supply, but you would be hard-pressed to find anyone else.<br>
What is next? Will Repunzel wear a burqa so young Muslim girls have someone like them?<br>

		<p>What&rsquo;s the big deal here? The only book that Muslims have been REALLY concerned with, is their Koran. Other than that, what about the writings of Omar Khayyam? &#8220;Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves&rsquo;? &#8220;Aladin&rsquo;s Magic Lamp&#8221;? &#8220;A Thousand and One Arabian Nights&#8221;?</p>
<p>What is with these educators in Minnesota, who actually feel that Mohammed, Takrit, Abdul -Aziz, and Mujibur will be alone and isolated, if they don&rsquo;t read books about other Muslims? That&rsquo;s laughable. Are these educators so stupid that they don&rsquo;t realize Muslims want to destroy everything Western, and replace it with everything Islamic? </p>
<p>Maybe these educators haven&rsquo;t heard of &#8220;The Satanic Verses&#8221;. They&rsquo;d rather feed Muslims books like &#8220;Ahmad Rahman and the Somali Pirates&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Public school history textbooks are, of course, spectacularly  dishonest in their portrayal of Islam.  Diane Ravitch, an NYU research professor, was appointed to the National Assessment Governing Board by President Clinton and was appointed assistant secretary of education for President H. W. Bush.  Ravitch&rsquo;s widely-acclaimed THE LANGUAGE POLICE (2003) is must-reading for anyone needing to know just how bad instruction in history (and literature) is in the government systems.  Quoting Ravitch:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The textbooks&rsquo; treatment of religion is consistently deferential, even reverential; they seldom discuss the role of religious belief as a source of conflict.  In their eagerness to show respect to all religions, the texts soft-pedal religious hatreds and the religious roots of many wars in history.  In the textbooks&rsquo; account, wars come and go, empires conquer one another, but religion hovers above all as a beneficent influence. The Crusades are briefly discussed, but their main importance seems to have been to whet the appetites of Europeans for rich goods from Asia.  Children who read these books will not understand the passions stirred by religious differences, because such things don&rsquo;t seem to happen in textbook-land, where all religions coexist harmoniously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The treatment of Islam, for example, lacks any critical analysis.  The texts stress that Islam is tolerant and egalitarian; that its body of laws (the sharia) established a high standard of morality and ethics; and that Islam improved women&rsquo;s status &hellip;&rdquo; p145</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Western democracies have recently become aware that their views of gender equality are not the same as those that prevail in the Muslim world.  Again, the texts do not honestly portray the differences.  Instead, they tell a remarkably consistent story of the improved status of women under Islamic rule &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;Houghton-Mifflin&rsquo;s To See a World says that Islam expanded the rights of women, allowing them to own and inherit property; even if a man has four wives, he must support all of them equally.  If he divorces one of them, she is allowed to retain the property she had when she married him.  In Harcourt Brace&rsquo;s World History: People and Nations, we hear again about the enhanced status of Muslim women, who &lsquo;gained certain rights with regard to property ownership.&rsquo; In World History: The Human Experience, we read virtually the identical language about the enhanced position of women in Islamic societies.  This text claims that the Iranian revolution of 1979 was a gain for women; it created new job opportunities for Iranian women because only women were permitted to tailor women&rsquo;s clothing and only women could teach in girls&rsquo; schools.  Prentice-Hall&rsquo;s World History: Connections to Today states that &lsquo;many educated Muslim women&rsquo; have voluntarily returned to wearing traditional dress to show their &lsquo;resistance to popular governments,&rsquo; their refusal to imitate Western culture,&rsquo; or their &lsquo;sincere loyalty to Muslim values and practices.&rsquo; An accompanying photograph shows women covered from head to toe enjoy [ing] an afternoon of boating.&rdquo; p146</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unable to say anything about religion unless it is positive, the textbooks become tongue-tied when dealing with Islamic fundamentalism.  World History: The Human Experience says that Islamic fundamentalists want to &lsquo;return to Muslim traditions&rsquo; and compares them to conservative Protestants in the United States.  It doesn&rsquo;t say what these traditions are, nor does it explain the difference between a society that protects diverse religious expressions and a theocracy that is ruled by religious authorities.  Because the texts cannot write critically about Islamic fundamentalism, most ignore the aftermath of the Iranian revolution of 1979.  In the textbook version of the story, the cruel and repressive Shah of Iran was replaced by a stern critic, the ayatollah Khomeini, who formed a government based on Islamic law.  For most textbooks, the story of modern-day Iran ends there.  Although a quarter-century has passed, the textbooks do not acknowledge that the theocratic reign of the ayatollahs has turned out to be as oppressive as the Shah&rsquo;s regime, just as willing to suppress dissent, and perhaps even more ready to hunt down and assassinate it enemies.  Of course, none mentions the Ayatollah Khomeini&rsquo;s infamous fatwa against Salman Rushdie.&rdquo;  pp146-147</p>
<p>Textbook publishers practice self-censorship by letting representatives of religious and ethnic groups to serve on &ldquo;advisory boards,&rdquo; effectively giving them a veto over content: </p>
<p>&ldquo;The world history textbooks consistently shade or omit facts that might offend any racial, ethnic, or religious group.  This does not occur by happenstance.  Most of the books prominently identify an advisory board that includes representatives of religious and ethnic groups.  Three publishers  &mdash;  Glencoe, Houghton-Mifflin, and Prentice-Hall  &mdash;  rely on the same individual from the Council on Islamic Education to review their Islamic content.  This may account for the similarity of their material on Islam as well as their omission of anything that would enable students to understand conflicts between Islamic fundamentalism and Western liberalism.  Some textbooks have multicultural advisory committees that include representatives of Jewish, Ukranian-American, Native-American, Asian American, and Afrocentric organizations.  Publishers that invite representatives of religious and ethnic groups to review their materials before publication are practicing self-censorship.&rdquo;  p147</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s <i>not</i> &#8220;normal.&#8221; This is the United States, not the Middle East. </p>
<p>Just for the sake of argument, let&rsquo;s say that it is necessary to have a certain number of &#8220;Muslim-based&#8221; books in the libraries. How many should there be? A few? Exactly the same percentage as the number of Muslims in the community? 50/50?</p>
<p>Notice that this MSM piece doesn&rsquo;t even raise any of the obvious objections. Why should it? After all, this is exactly the point of view the MSM wants to promote.</p>
<p>And what exactly is a &#8220;reading intervention specialist&#8221; anyway?</p>

		<p>This is just another example of Muslims trying to worm their way into the Western world. If they want children&rsquo;s and young adult literature they can go and write it themselves. However, literature written in Arabic is sorely lacking since Muslims in general do not value education much unless it is to further their agenda. Children&rsquo;s literature is full of different subjects and themes, many of them dealing with specific issues and cultures. I have seen kid&rsquo;s books aimed at kids with all sorts of family and personal issues (such as death, illness or divorce) as well as books targeting specific cultures (Orthodox Jews, specific Christian groups, ect) I have even seen an occasional Islamic themed book (I am a former Muslim) so they are out there. </p>

		<p>First you bring them here as a humanitarian gesture. That was easy.  You are going to uplift them, maybe even (you hope) Christianize them. Such good intentions! You feel like a saint.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t end there. Next, they need special education and social workers and cultural counseling, etc., etc.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t end there.  Then they want hallal food. Then they need mosques and minarets. Then they demand changes in the laws. Then dogs, alcohol, and pork must go!</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t end there. Then they need special schoolbooks that display their own ethnic types (to enhance their self-esteem).  Then they&rsquo;ll need teachers that are their own kind, who can give Islamically-correct instruction.</p>
<p>And so on, and so on, and so on&hellip;.</p>
<p>Until they have re-created the same Islamic society that you thought you had rescued them from!</p>
<p>And it turns out that  they have dragged you down to THEIR level  and Islamized YOU!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d be curious to know who the white and christians are who oversee these boards? It sure seems they&rsquo;ve fallen down on the job! Or are the white members of these boards &#8216;marxist&rsquo; students of the multicult too, who are concerned about things being sensitive, but only concerned about things being sensitive towards women and students of color? Sounds like Diane Ravitch could even be one of them.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because there ARE no decent role models in Islam!<br>
Duh.</p>
<p>I can nevertheless attest that the drive for &#8216;multicultural brainwashing&rsquo; is alive and well in Minnesota. A parent I know, (whose children attend a college prep school where the &#8220;Western Canon&rsquo; is the teaching style, believe it or not) even here, had their history books replete with numerous references to how &#8216;wonderful&rsquo; Islam was, and yet, while studying the Medieval era, not more than ONE page was spent on Chivalry- the defining creed of the &#8216;noble knight,&rsquo; the &#8216;fair lady,&rsquo;  the foundation of the ENTIRE WEST, which led to Marian piety, which led to the Gothic,  the great search for learning, and the establishment of the University thereby, which then led to the Renaissance, and all the rest of Western Civilization, from the tradition of knight, page, jousts, and (yes) the Crusades.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there were also two pages devoted to Orthodoxy, which lasted only 1000 years longer as the Eastern ROMAN Empire, than did the West&hellip;.but, of course, no mention was made of the incursions of Islam into Spain, what is now Turkey, the dhimmitude, and forced castration of young boys to serve in the Muslim harems, the janissaries, and the second class status Christians were given (if they were not sent to the galleys, or the gallows!) during the 500-years of Muslim rule in Europe&hellip;.</p>
<p>But all of this pales into insignificance, when you merely ask the question, &#8220;WHY ARE THOSE PEOPLE HERE?&#8221; Until that question is answered (and &#8216;to effect social change&rsquo; is not an acceptable answer!) the response of all Americans, and all Minnesotans, should be, &#8216;What difference does it make? They came HERE- to a WESTERN, CHRISTIAN Culture. Either ADAPT to OUR CULTURE&hellip;. OR LEAVE.</p>

<p>Yes, they need characters who beat their wives, stone to death people for adultry, and massacre converts to Christianity, but most important, they need to show their jihad figures who teach them to hate the countries who gave them sanctuary.</p>

Of course the poster ghw says it all; I just want to add my little bit. I am Jewish - raised among, and lived among non Jews most of my life. When I went to elementary school I was, for years the only Jewish kid in the school (as well as the only white kid). My take: this is (or, until recently was) a Christian nation. This wonderful Christian nation has, for the most part, been tolerant and accepting of every sort of outside religion and creed. I have no problem with Christian holidays and symbols (&#8220;Merry Christmas&#8221;, public creches, prayers before public meetings). I believe that this is a nation under God, not man, and I believe that if we cater to every whim of any non Christian, we are going to wind up having Satan in our textbooks (actually Satan is probably writing them!)</p>

		<p> &#8220;&hellip;literature written in Arabic is sorely lacking since Muslims in general do not value education much &hellip; &#8221; Spartan24 </p>
<p>It is dangerous to &#8220;value education much&#8221; in the Muslim world. A 2003 Chicago Tribune report describes the intellectual wasteland that is the Muslim world: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Grasping the poor state of Arab information industries such as publishing and journalism, they say, is critical to understanding the alienation, isolation and malaise roiling the modern Middle East. &lsquo;There is simply no readership,&rsquo; publisher Ibrahim al-Mowallem says bluntly. &lsquo;We think of this as part of a pan-Arab depression. People are not reading because they have lost hope&rsquo;&rdquo;; &ldquo;Across the Arab world, a region of 280 million people, a best seller is a book that sells just 5,000 copies. Translation of foreign works into Arabic lags far behind translations into many other languages: Five times as many books are translated each year into Greek, a language spoken by just 11 million people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Egyptian scholar Nader Fergany:</p>
<p>&#8220;Take the publishing business; a book that aims to find a market in all Arab countries has to negotiate 22 countries&rsquo; censors. The noose is so tight that very little squeezes through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rise of strict, socialist regimes across the region in the 1950s and &rsquo;60s forced intellectuals to restrict their commentary and accept government intervention, while economic stagnation sapped readers&rsquo; ability to pay for new books. On top of that, the growth of Islamic fundamentalism has put new limits on what writers can safely express.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Recently the highest religious authority in Sunni Islam, Al-Azhar University in Cairo, called for a ban on Egyptian poet Ahmed Al-Shahawi&rsquo;s book &lsquo;Commandments for Loving Women,&rsquo; arguing that its explicit passages desecrate Islam&hellip;.Al-Shahawi is mindful of history. He recalls the example of Mahfouz, the Egyptian who won the 1988 Nobel Prize for literature. In 1959, one of Mahfouz&rsquo;s works had been condemned by authorities at Al-Azhar. Decades later, Mahfouz was stabbed and nearly killed by members of the militant group Gama&rsquo;a Islamiya who cited Al-Azhar&rsquo;s fatwa as the impetus for the attack.  &lsquo;The problem,&rsquo; said Al-Shahawi, holding his hands to his throat, &lsquo;is that a fatwa issued by Al-Azhar will always be like a sword against my neck.&rsquo;</p>
<p>SOURCE: Arabs close the book on reading</p>
<p>&#8220;In a region where a best seller means just 5,000 copies sold, experts blame a lack of money, time and hope&#8221;</p>

		<p>If they want to read something featuring Muslims, they can read the police blotters.</p>
<p>How many Muslims torched their failed restaurants for insurance money, how many were caught smuggling hashish, how many killed other Muslims in &#8216;honour&rsquo; killings?</p>
<p>Maybe they can read how some go with cap in hand to the oil-rich gulf states, to get funding to build a mosque and hoist the flag of Muslim cultural dominance into infidel lands.</p>

		<p>If Arab or Islamic authors had made valuable contributions to Western Civilization, there would be plenty of texts for students to read. My college textbook, &#8220;Readings in Western Civilization,&#8221; dated 1960, did not have a single Arab or Islamic document in its entire 922 pages covering the period from the Old Testament to the Cold War. Don&rsquo;t blame the West for a lack of Arab/Muslim texts.</p>

		<p>The actual problem is people like Scullen who play the role of cultural commissar and try to determine what we&rsquo;re supposed to think. Christians have been murdered for hundreds of years in muslim controlled parts of the world as they are even at present being killed. Let&rsquo;s have more school library books laying out these facts without pulling any punches; facts provide education, not fairy tales. Whatever muslims steal must remain theirs forever and what we have must be negotiated away. We need more books to tell the real story sitting on the shelves.  </p>

		<p>How about if we have students read &#8220;The Song of Roland?&#8221;  That has plenty of Muslim characters. </p>

<p>&#8220;Little Ahmed just can&rsquo;t relate to Western characters.&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;   AmRen&rsquo;s subhead for this article&rsquo;s headline</p>
<p><br>
If little Ahmed just can&rsquo;t relate to Western characters, I would very much like to know what purpose Little Ahmed is serving by BEING in the West? </p>
<p>Because it seems to me that Little Ahmed   &mdash;   not to mention Little Fatima, plus of course Big Rahim and Big A&rsquo;isha   &mdash;   are bringing NOTHING BUT NEGATIVES. </p>
<p>Sure, we&rsquo;ve had immigrant groups in the past who weren&rsquo;t perfect but at least brought some positive attributes with them along with the negatives. The number of positive attributes brought by Ahmed and Fatima and company looks to me like a big fat ZERO. What exactly are WE supposed to be getting out of their presence here? What&rsquo;s all this immigration by followers of Mohammedanism supposed to do for US? </p>
<p>Or is it &#8220;racist&#8221; and &#8220;Islamophobic&#8221; even to ASK such a question? </p>
<p>If Muslims &#8220;can&rsquo;t relate to us,&#8221; then it logically follows that it would be better if they weren&rsquo;t here at all. </p>

		<p>&#8220;It is extremely important for young people to read stories reflecting their ethnicity and/or religion in order to feel like worthwhile human beings,&rdquo; said Freda Shamma</p>
<p>Unless you are white. Nothing more need be said.</p>

		<p>  I have the perfect solution for this problem. Educators need to turn to the Arabian Nights: Tales of 1,001 Nights: Volume 1 (Penguin Classics) [in the new translation by Malcolm and Ursula Lyons}. I recommend the &#8220;Story of the Young King of the Black Isles.&#8221; I think the Somali and Sudanese Muslim students will learn about a portion of Arabic Culture they may be unfamiliar with.</p>

		<p>We could learn a thing or two from muslims. For example, in many Arab nations AIDS is virtually non-existant, and crime and violence virtually zero too. I&rsquo;m guessing those aren&rsquo;t the things we&rsquo;re going to be taught. Just a guess&hellip;</p>

		<p>this is another problem for parents who&rsquo;s children are in the public schools. I have lived in a country with the most mass of muslims in the world for 13yrs and I am continually surprised over the hate that is taught in the Koran. People are People and there is good and badin all, but if you are taught day in day out to hate and to kill like the Koran states then even a good hearted person will fall victim to the hatred. <br>
The difference in the Bible and the Koran is that the Bible states to turn the other cheek, the Koran teaches to kill.</p>
