			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Scott Bobb, Voice of America News, December 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Thousands of Zimbabweans living in South Africa are trying to legalize their stay before Friday. The South African government says after this deadline it will begin deporting Zimbabweans without documents but those who can prove they have begun the registration process will not be expelled. </p>
<p>Large crowds of Zimbabweans were lined up outside South African Home Affairs offices on the eve of the expiration of a special dispensation (exception) that for the past 18 months had allowed them to work without documents in South Africa.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An estimated 1.5 million Zimbabweans are living in South Africa, many of them illegally. Some say they fled repression and human rights abuses in their country. Others say they came looking for jobs after years of economic decline in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>The South African government says they should return home because the situation in Zimbabwe has stabilized since the creation of a power sharing government two years ago.</p>
<p>The government announced the registration program in September saying it would begin deporting Zimbabweans without documents after December 31st.</p>
<p>Human rights activists urged it to extend the deadline saying there was not enough time to process all the applications.</p>
<p>Home Affairs Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma responded saying there would be no extension of the deadline but people with receipts proving that they had applied for the work permit or their Zimbabwean passport would be spared. &#8220;There will be no deportation until we have finished processing everything that we would have received including waiting for those people who are waiting for their passports,&#8221; Dlamini-Zuma said.</p>

		<p>Getting papers legalizing their stay before Friday!!!  Not a snowball&rsquo;s hope in hell. I know individuals who have waited for over 6 months for a passport.</p>
<p>Do thousands of Zimbabweans have any idea of how long it takes to obtain any documentation from a South African &#8220;government service&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Madison Grant, you are so correct.  I lived for 25 years in South Africa until 1999, and the black people from other countries who had moved there for work (short contracts) I mixed with were not worried at all about Apartheid as the conditions and wages were so good they were happy to be there.  In fact this is one reason that the terror groups such as the ANC (Mandela&rsquo;s mob) had to publicly kill black people using machetes or necklacing to force them to support the terrorists who now are in government there.</p>
<p>I am of the opinion that the terror groups we have to endure now exist because the west has approved of the methods in other parts of the World such as Sub-Saharan Africa by appeasing the terror groups..  The terrorists know that murder and terror works with us (not me) ignorant westerners.</p>

		<p>To Madison Grant (re Post # 1):</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because the Bantus knew where the money was. The likes of Kenneth Kaunda, Julius Nyerre and Jomo Kenyatta could spout off all they wanted to about the &#8220;evils&#8221; of apartheid in South Africa and Rhodesia, but they couldn&rsquo;t hide the fact that a civil servant in their country could make more money busing tables in South African and Rhodesian hotels and restaurants.</p>

		<p>I was in Rhodesia at the end. Despite the war and sanctions, it was a functioning country. And here we are mere three or so decades later, and the forces of black &#8220;liberation&#8221; have so thoroughly wrecked this country that it&rsquo;s people are fleeing to South Africa.  It&rsquo;s like reading of the city of Aquilea, after it being pillaged by the Huns. </p>
<p>But the bigger picture is that this can be a precedent for what happens in South Africa as the ANC becomes more entrenched. And then whatever benighted countries in Europe and North America which will get to absorb the refugees.  It&rsquo;s like watching the collapse of civilization. </p>
<p>Well, once again, Ian Smith was proven right.</p>

		<p>One of the excuses I heard in 1999 for our intervention in Kosovo was that a displaced population on the move creates knock-on effects that quickly add up to millions.  Alive or dead.</p>
<p>If Zimbabwe turns out to be he tipping point, then Southern Africa _the continent_ may be next.  I note with sadness the one white woman in the photo, hands held high like Moses, stopping a black sea.</p>
<p>Who does she think she&rsquo;s kidding?</p>

		<p>Poster #7 is right.  It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before liberal white governments open their borders to those desparate refugees from zimbabwe and millions more are brought to our small towns.</p>
