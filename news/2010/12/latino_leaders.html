			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Delen Goldberg, Las Vegas Sun, November 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Latino leaders in Nevada and nationwide are quietly debating whether to sever their traditional Democratic ties and form an independent grass-roots political group.</p>
<p>The idea, born of frustration over the party&rsquo;s inaction on immigration reform and fears that as a voting bloc they&rsquo;re a political afterthought, Latino leaders have discussed the idea among themselves locally and in conference calls with colleagues across the country.</p>
<p>The unlikely model for the movement they would like to launch is the Tea Party  &mdash;  not in substance, of course, but in its grass-roots organizational style. Acknowledging the source of their inspiration, Latino leaders have dubbed the proposed movement the &#8220;Tequila Party.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hispanics have proved to be a powerful political force in Nevada and nationally. They were instrumental in electing President Barack Obama and are credited with saving Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid&rsquo;s re-election this month. In Nevada, Latinos accounted for 15 percent of voters in 2008 and a record 16 percent in this month&rsquo;s midterm elections.</p>
<p>Despite, or perhaps because of, their robust turnout, many Latinos have become disillusioned with party politics. Their efforts haven&rsquo;t led to the changes in policy they would like to see.</p>
<p>Hispanic Republicans complain that party officials court their vote but often advocate policies that marginalize the community.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Latino Democrats, on the other hand, wonder if their support is taken for granted. They express frustration and anger at the lack of movement on immigration and education reform in Washington. They bristle at being underrepresented in the state Democratic Party and the Democratic National Committee. Community organizers complain they are recognized only near the end of campaigns, when polls are tight and their votes are needed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Politicians affiliated with Tea Party groups won more than 40 congressional seats in the midterm elections. All ran as Republicans. And while headliners such as Angle and Christine O&rsquo;Donnell lost at the ballot box, their association with the movement and the party placed them on a national stage, where they were able to amass a significant amount of support and in Angle&rsquo;s case, a stunning amount of money.</p>
<p>Hispanic leaders hope to spur something similar.</p>

						<p>
							<i>Delen Goldberg, Las Vegas Sun, November 29, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The idea of a &#8220;Tequila Party,&#8221; which until recently was only quietly debated among Latino leaders, is now making a splash.</p>
<p>First reported Sunday by the Sun, the proposal has gained international attention and has been featured in news publications worldwide.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Reporters from Fox News, the Mexican broadcasting station TV Azteca and even a Brazilian publication have asked Romero for interviews, he said.</p>
<p>Dozens of news organizations have followed up on the Sun story. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Commenters on the stories appear to have mixed feelings about the potential third party.</p>
<p>Some called the idea of a Latino effort &#8220;racist.&#8221; Others cringed at the name. Many applauded the prospect of a movement to highlight Hispanic concerns.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll say it again.  Hispanics didn&rsquo;t save Harry Reid.  33% of Nevada Hispanic voters voted for Brian Sandoval for Governor, and 30% of them voted for Sharron Angle for Senate.  What saved Harry Reid were the 21% of white voters (themselves comprising 72% of the NV electorate) that voted both Sandoval for GOV and Reid for SEN   &mdash;   Possible culprits for that schizophrenic voting behavior include the casino owners and unions who put on massive pressure to save Reid, and the NRA, which endorsed Reid at first then walked it back because of NV member outrage, (but I think the NRA silently helped Reid after that), because the NRA didn&rsquo;t want Schumer or Durbin running the Senate, and they made the (what turned out to be correct) calculation that the Democrats would hold on to the Senate.</p>
<p>As for this business about Democrats taking Hispanic voters for granted   &mdash;   I wish Republicans would take white voters &#8220;for granted&#8221; in the same way   &mdash;   We might actually have something.  Half of Obama&rsquo;s SCOTUS appointments have gone to Hispanics, as an example.</p>

		<p>This is great! By all means, show brainwashed White America once again that you think of yourselves as a group, as a block, and &#8220;other than&#8221; the rest of America! I cheer everytime news like this surfaces. Keep on wrapping yourselves in your &#8220;Latino&#8221; pride and arrogance - and let America see, once and for all, what is REALLY going on here!!</p>
<p>This would not be like the Tea Party in concept, but the exact OPPOSITE of what the Tea Party, at least originally, stood for! </p>

		<p>I love to hear this kind of news, this is the polarization we need in America to finally let White men come to their senses; see what is occurring, and to act upon it.  I surely hope this new Mexican party is 100% foreigners in membership. </p>

		<p>I think this is funny because they obviously have no idea of the history behind the term Tea Party. They must think it&rsquo;s just a bunch of wishy-washy White teetotalers who are out there complaining about losing their country. </p>
<p>Yeah, Tequila Party is a great idea. Keep it up, you morons! </p>

		<p>This is a good idea! It must be encouraged! These people do not understand american politics. The dems know that any handout to the hispanics is unpopular and can end their political career. That is why the don&rsquo;t want the dream act to come up for a vote.<br>
   If the hispanics split from from the dems, the dems will become as extinct as the Whig party.<br>
   This is the wrong name for the party. It should be called the Bandido party or the mexican party.</p>

<p>This is the shocking news that&rsquo;s never talked about. BUT, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if the half of Hispanics who are &#8220;white&#8221; on the Census voted 50-50 between the GOP and Dems (rather like Nevada whites did) and the other half who are &#8220;some other race&#8221; (but who still get counted as &#8220;white&#8221; in crime and birth stats) voted 90-10 for the Dem like blacks always do.</p>

		<p>I agree with HH. From a purely tactical standpoint this is no time for them to be rattling sabers. I hope they make a lot of noise and are unsuccessful in their attempts to put a cover on their Aztlan kooks. For anyone inclined and able it would be great to infiltrate the Dem party and do everything to heighten the division, like spreading rumors and such. At this point this &#8216;latino&rsquo; movement, coupled with traditionally low hispanic voter turnout and increasingly angry whites, is jumping the gun and hopefully is bound to failure and backlash</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll never understand why Latinos have this need to close ranks as they do. The only thing that they share in common is the language. By creating the Tequila Party they&rsquo;ve identified it as a Mexican political movement. Is it a big tent? Are Argentinos &amp; Uruguayos also welcome or should they form a Mate Party? Aside from language how much do Puerto Ricans, Dominicans and Cubans have in common with Mexicans? I&rsquo;m forever reminding my PR colleagues when they refer to Puerto Rico as &#8220;my country&#8221; that PR is also part of my country ergo. the United States in OUR country. They usually respond with &#8221; Yea, but YOU know what I mean.&#8221;<br>
IT seems that if they&rsquo;re legitimate American citizens they should feel just as threatened as the rest of us by this wave of unchecked immigration especially in view of the fact that so many of those who cross the border are NOT even Latinos.<br>
An Arab or darker complected Pak could easily pass for a stereotypical Hispanic.<br>
Would that we shared such solidarity with Brits, Canadians, Austalians, New Zealanders and English speaking S. African Whites.</p>

		<p>It figuers that he Hispanics would come up with a Political Party named after some alcohol that is most associated with them. </p>
<p>But unlike the Tea Party, which is based on the first &#8220;Tea Party&#8221; which led to the American Revolution, that took place to protest unjust Taxation by the Crown, the Tequila Party would be a self-serving Party for the Bloc of Voters, legal and Illegal, to concentrate their power, and change what&rsquo;s left of existing American policy. </p>
<p>I am just curious to know if the Liberal Media, the Criminal Politicians, and the brainwashed College kids will call the Tequila Party &#8220;Racist&#8221; as they did with the Tea Party, for the lack of White and Black members?</p>

		<p><i>The idea&hellip; that as a voting bloc they&rsquo;re a political afterthought</i></p>
<p>Seems a few of the more aware hispanics are starting to get a hint as to their <b>true</b> role in the Demon party   &mdash;   that of useful idiots, expendable after they&rsquo;ve performed their duty. </p>
<p>As for the laughable name <i>Tequila Party</i>, I hope they keep it, as it will perfectly fit any proposed platforms they may come up with (such as mass amnesty).  Wonder if CPUSA has contacted them yet&hellip;they will.</p>
<p>Also, IMO, any party that drains off and/or splits or fractures the Dems is worth supporting.</p>
<p>Now if we could just reach those stupid Whites who continue to vote for the likes of harry reid and boxer in California..</p>

<p>That America&rsquo;s latino Fifth Columnists should want to do their own Reconquista version of the Tea Party shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising; this kind of mimicry or mirroring is, circa early 21st Century, nothing more than &#8220;identity-politics-as-usual. What is unexpected is that this group would be so tone-deaf to public reaction that they would give themselves the <i>Onion/i&gt;-worthy name of &#8220;The Tequila Party.&#8221; Calling a Raza-type group a &#8220;Tequila Party&#8221; sounds like something us terrible awful gringos would come up with to ridicule and demean their cause! Like back in the early days of American labor history when anti-unionists would joke that the letters &#8220;IWW&#8221; stood not for &#8220;Industrial Workers of the World&#8221; but for &#8220;I Want Whiskey.&#8221; </i></p>
<p>I expect this entire &#8220;Tequila Party&#8221; venture will turn out the way most Mexican tequila parties turn out: a lot of loud and incoherent yelling (<i>en espanol, naturalmente</i>; threats of violence and/or the real thing; some furniture will get smashed; and then finally keeling over and passing out, with nothing positive having been accomplished. </p>
<p>But on the positive side, the food and the dancing should both be quite good. </p>

		<p>Of course the Democrat Party is taking Hispanics for granted.  The Democrats took blue-collar whites for granted for decades and then ditched them once they were no longer necessary; why should Hispanics be any different?</p>
