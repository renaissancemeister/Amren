<h1>Dashboard Camera Captured Trooper&rsquo;s Shooting</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rhonda Cook and Christian Boone, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, December 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A state trooper&rsquo;s dashboard video camera captured his fatal shooting Monday, allegedly at the hands of a man with a lengthy criminal record, according to a GBI affidavit obtained by the AJC.</p>
<p>The video led state and Atlanta investigators to arrest Gregory Favors, 30, a man with an 11-year criminal record but who had no previous arrests for violent behavior.</p>
<p>According to court records obtained by the AJC Wednesday, Favors was out of jail on $19,000 bond following a Dec. 10 arrest, for which he had been charged with several nonviolent felony offenses. He missed a hearing related to that arrest on Monday morning, the same day he allegedly gunned down LeCroy.</p>
<p>According to the affidavit, written by GBI agent A.B. Johnston, the video shows that Favors initially stopped when trooper First Class Chadwick LeCroy pulled behind him with his blue lights on but then sped away as LeCroy approached the Mazda 6.</p>
<p>According to the affidavit, which was used to secure a search warrant, the ensuing chase ended when the Mazda hit a mailbox on St. Paul Avenue in Atlanta. LeCroy walked toward the passenger side of the Mazda; the camera showed the driver leaned over to the passenger window and fired a handgun. LeCroy was struck in the neck.</p>
<p>The driver then got out of the car on the passenger side, walked around the car and tried to move the mailbox to free his car. He had a gun in his hand at the time, the affidavit stated. When he didn&rsquo;t succeed in freeing his car, he retrieved several items from the car and then drove off in LeCroy&rsquo;s car, abandoning it several miles away on Gun Club Road.</p>
<p>Two APD officers saw Favors on Brook Avenue in northwest Atlanta and he was still wearing a heavy white winter jacket and green shirt that the camera recorded. Favors, according to affidavit, had blood on his hand. He later told police the blood was from a fight with his girlfriend.</p>
<p>Several witnesses told police they saw Favors throw a handgun onto the roof of an apartment just before he was captured, according to the affidavit. Police later retrieved a 9mm Smith &amp; Wesson semiautomatic.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>His first arrest in Fulton came 11 years ago to the day: Dec. 28, 1999.</p>

		<p>God bless the fallen Trooper and his family. We see it over and over again, a black punk trades his temporary freedom for the life of another person. Imagine the hue and cry if the Trooper had shot this guy instead? </p>
<p>I see it regularly in my professional life. Officers in greater fear of being sued or pilloried in the press than being killed by these criminal lowlifes! </p>

<p>One of their worst kills one of our best, and not a peep from us about Justice.  Silence and grim resignation to our losing side in the race war is all we give after this latest horror in the long march toward total degradation of Whiteness.</p>
<p>We are reprobate.  No candle light prayer vigils, no protests, no demands, no boycotts.   Just silence.  &#8220;Shhh, don&rsquo;t say anything about it and just move on.  You don&rsquo;t want anybody to think you are a raciss.&#8221;</p>
<p>We should be demanding that Rep. John Lewis be arrested for crimes against humanity.</p>

		<p>The apologia starts in earnest- he&rsquo;s just scared. </p>

 Playing on the emotions of gullible White women jurors.</p>
<p>Scared of that scary big White trooper who may not have attended all of the Diversity and Inclusion Seminars mandated by the Office of Diversity and Inclusion.</p>
<p>In the Days of White Rightness before the civil rights destruction of our White Republic, the perp would have reason to be scared about right now.  In fact, the problem would have been solved already, ef ya know wha um say&rsquo;n?</p>

Only a raciss would watch the video and conclude that a noble, yet oppressed and marginalized, African &#8220;American&#8221; did anything wrong.</p>
<p>&#8220;I din do nuffins!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then again, only a raciss can see that this was a racially motivated murder, which it was, as we all know.  </p>
<p>It always is.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can you say it was racially motivated?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because the black knew the trooper was White.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because the black knew that he was killing a White.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What does that prove?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It proves that blacks take to heart all the virulent and toxic anti-White hatred spewed from all institutions.  Anti White hatemongering creates a climate where extremists feel they have permission to act out their own biases and fears by attacking those whom they are told are evil. Blacks are constantly told that White Humanity stole everything from them, therefore, Whites owe blacks everything.  Blacks can&rsquo;t commit crimes against Whites, they can only &#8216;act out in legitimate rage&rsquo; against the injustice of White America&rsquo;s refusal to universally acknowledge our unearned White privileges and take responsibility for all the harm we have cause to our black brothers and sisters.  Our refusal to share the common spoon over the common bowl is proof that we are raciss who have no human dignity and have no civil rights which must be respected.&#8221;<br>

		<p>People should ask themselves WHY a criminal like this gets arrested 19 times but no serious effort is made to remove him from society until he kills a cop (even then, it&rsquo;s in doubt).</p>
<p>Liberalism?  Non-whites controlling the government and courts?  That&rsquo;s part of the answer.  But the majority of it is an unspoken understanding that he can do these crimes in special special non-enforcement zones like Atlanta without fear of real punishment while, if he moves elsewhere, he would face serious prison time.</p>
<p>In a sense, all of Atlanta is an extra minimum security prison.  There are many places like it&hellip;.LA, Detroit, parts of New York City, New Orleans, etc. etc.</p>
<p>Non-whites know that if they live there, they can do what they want and not go to jail.  While, if they do it elsewhere, they will go to jail.  They really don&rsquo;t understand that is a form of jail in itself.  And, if they ever threaten to disperse, that would likely become formal.  Barbed wire, guards, walls, not to mention national ID with refusal of services outside the authorized areas (no food, no rent, fear of arrest etc.) could become a reality.  In fact, it looks like that is the way the US is headed.</p>
<p>Why?  Simply because there is a need.  A manufactured need&hellip;.that leads to manufactured consent.  Understand something.  When the government tells you everyone needs DNA sampling, fingerprinting, retinal ID, and ID linked to computerized databases that track criminal record, citizenship status etc., not only will you accept it, you will demand it.  To get rid of the illegals and keep them from getting welfare.  To keep criminals like this out of your neighborhood and limited to the Atlanta city limits.  It has all been arranged.</p>
<p>If the government doesn&rsquo;t collapse that is.  The risks these people are taking in order to gain total control, are amazing.  Insane.  People just let it happen too.</p>

<p>Enforcement-free zones like you describe Atlanta and many other major cities and parts of major cities sounds more to me like a characteristic of the segregationist system.  White elites allowed blacks their own &#8220;safe zones&#8221; where they were exempt from the sort of moral rectitude that whites imposed upon themselves.</p>

		<p>As a resident just outside the Atlanta metro area, I was registered with one of the local news affiliates&rsquo; home pages to comment on news articles posted on their website. Being Atlanta, over and over, virtually every day, the news articles on their web page deal with typical black behavior: robberies, shootings, stabbings, drug arrests, DUI arrests, swindling, fraud, shoplifting, etc. You know, the usual. I commented on this vile, reprehensible act of a 19-time convicted black felon not being atypical black behavior, along with the percentage of blacks arrested vs whites, and my post (not surprisingly for the news channel - they pull every post that mentions even a whiff of mention the black race) was deleted, but also after this particular article, my account was terminated for &#8216;race baiting.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>I have said it before, I&rsquo;ll say it again and it is always worth repeating. Those among us who would repeatedly commit anti-social acts should legally have their citizenship revoked and be banished form this country. </p>
<p>I am sure some &#8220;progressive&#8221; contry like Mexico, Cuba or Haiti would be happy to take in our refuse at about $10k a pop. </p>
<p>If some judge would have done this somewhere along his 5th arrest, do you realize how many lives and dollars would be spared and how many tragedies like this one would have been avoided?</p>
<p>This is a humane cost-effective solution who&rsquo;s time has come. If you don&rsquo;t like American society and American laws then we&rsquo;ll send you somewhere where they know how to deal with your behavior and don&rsquo;t give two hoots about &#8220;politcal correctness&#8221;. </p>

		<p><i> a man with an 11-year criminal record but who had no previous arrests for violent behavior.</i></p>
<p>This is stated as if it makes it okay that this felon was let off 11 times. It&rsquo;s like when a known dangerous  animal bites someone for the first time. &#8220;But he never bit anyone before!&#8221; means absolutely nothing. You&rsquo;re supposed to take reasonable precautions. </p>
<p>As far as I know, prior to, say, 1960, it was unthinkable to let a known criminal off 11 times in a row. Each offense would bring a longer and longer sentence until, long before the 11th offense, he would be locked away for so long that he would be too old to commit any more crimes by the time he was released. This insane pandering to blacks has wrecked our criminal justice system. </p>

		<p>Years ago, this black criminal&rsquo;s first conviction would have bought him a long stretch in prison. <br>
A large element of the black underclass appears unable to suppress anti-social urges, and thus society used to deal with the problem by segregation.  Any black who entered a white area was open to immediate scrutiny, and, unless the black had legitimate business there, he knew he was asking for trouble.  And any black who tried to drive away from a traffic stop would have been shot.</p>

		<p>This officer was working, to his knowledge, in a high crime area. As a matter of fact he was assigned here in a unit that was working to lower crime in this high crime area. As a matter of fact Atlanta is will known to all law enforcement as not only one of the highest crime cities in America but also a refuge for criminals on the run. He had stopped a car for a minor traffic violation, a broken tail light. The driver stopped, then sped away, hit a mail box, and crashed the car. Why would a white officer walk up to such a car in such a situation and peer into the passenger window? Why didn&rsquo;t the officer draw his weapon, shield himself with his patrol car, and demand the culprit exit the car with his hands in sight, held over his head? Didn&rsquo;t this situation call for extreme caution on the part of any law enforcement officer in any such situation? He should have already called for backup, explaining the situation briefly and waited for the criminal to comply with his orders or backup to arrive. I mean was political correctness being use here? Had this officer seen too many TV shows?<br>
The fact that the news coverage here has already moved on and not a single person has not, so far, raised a murmur about this shooting of a law enforcement officer dying while trying to protect the city of Atlanta says it all. </p>

		<p>All respect and sympathy go to the family of this Trooper.  I pray for strength and peace to comfort them during this loss.</p>
<p>I loathe all who have allowed this criminal to continue in this society, including those of us who know and yet, do nothing.  Our society has been destroyed by diversity, by tolerance, by changing laws and attitudes, by ruining our educational systems, all our institutions for the unworthy and undeserving.</p>
<p>I too feel white society is too lazy, too foolish, to even recognize our country is lost and things will only get worse.<br>
Weak nonbelieving whites who actually think equality is placing &#8220;their&#8221; culture above ours.  Stand up for something, something decent, real values and unswerving dedication to real justice.</p>
<p>I loathe black culture and the whites who tolerate it.</p>

<p>And you are right this bum will go away for a good long time, he can forget parole for at least 5 years.</p>
<p>If anyone understands what I mean when I speak of blacks getting sex on the Down Low they will understand why a trip to prison for many blacks is like a Vacation To Paradise for a white person.</p>

<p>A major problem in Memphis, TN is that lenient black judges are reducing criminal charges on other blacks even prior to any plea bargaining. Attempted murders are now euphemistically called aggravated assaults, and are reduced to misdemeanors in surprising regularity down here. Judges also ignore automatic felony add-on charges, like mandatory additional sentencing for committing a felony with a firearm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s highly likely that in a city like Atlanta, Gregory Favors had previously committed and was arrested for violent crimes even if he was never charged with any.        </p>

		<p>Must have thought he was bullet proof and in an era where everyone takes the headshot because of vests, that&rsquo;s just stupid.</p>
<p>My part of the country, someone runs, they stay in the car, ignition off, keys tossed outside the vehicle, hands out the window, until help arrives. </p>
<p>And then they get out and kiss dirt while one cop controls them and the other/s clear the vehicle.</p>
<p>ONLY THEN is an arrest attempt made, with cuffs.</p>
<p>God help you if you move your hands or try to get up.</p>
<p>Good cops seldom die alone.</p>
<p>That said, the man who needs to die here is the idiot who supplied an 18 time felon with a weapon.  Because if he will sell to that lowlife, he will sell to anyone.  And has likely done it before.</p>
<p>My sympathies to the family, I hope he was well insured.</p>
