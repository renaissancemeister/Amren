<h1>UN: Migrant Population on Pace to Reach 405 Million by 2050</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Monsters and Critics (Glasgow), December 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>If migration continues at the same pace as in the last 20 years, there would 405 million migrants by 2050 around the world who will bring enormous benefits to local economies, the UN said Thursday.</p>
<p>The statement was issued in advance of Saturday&rsquo;s observance of International Migrants Day.</p>
<p>The International Organization for Migration said the steep rise in the migrant population is in response to an expected 25-per-cent decline in population in industrialized nations.</p>
<p>At the same time, demand for migrant workers will increase as the labour force in developing countries will grow from 2.4 billion people in 2005 to 3.6 billion by 2040.</p>
<p>The IOM said native-born US citizens gained an estimated 37 billion dollars a year from immigrants&rsquo; contributions to their economy, according the US president&rsquo;s Council of Economic Advisers. It said one in 10 self-employed business people in the United States is a migrant.</p>
<p>Yet some Americans have reacted negatively against, IOM said.</p>
<p>&#8216;Unfortunately, many of these discussions are based on emotions and myths and not on social and economic reality,&rsquo; IOM director William Lacy Swing said. &#8216;Migration now and in the future will be driven by global economic, social and demographic trends that can no longer be ignored.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The IOM, which recently issued a fresh report on world migration, cited an earlier study by the University College London, which showed that Eastern European migrants paid 37 per cent more in taxes than they received in benefits and public services in Britain in 2008-09.</p>
<p>Migrants work as doctors, nurses or cleaners in the British national health services.<br>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at that number.</p>
<p>If you were to put a price on what the US citizen is losing, you could factor the increase in human waste and garbage, the loss of open space and affordable property, increases in air and water pollution, added depreciation of utilities and public works, loss of identity and cultural dominance, demand on public services, consumption of renewable and non-renewable heritage resources, and loss of security.  These things are considered free by the statisticians.</p>
<p>Nothing is free, and the loss to the US citizen from mass immigration more than offsets any fictious &#8216;gains&rsquo;.</p>

<p>How nice!  Isn&rsquo;t migration wonderful?<br>
But their enthusiasm is hardly surprising.  What else would they say, when you consider who overwhelmingly makes up the UN?</p>
<p>They all aspire to invade and conquer the West. If they can&rsquo;t take it militarily, they&rsquo;ll take it demographically.</p>
<p><i>The IOM said native-born US citizens gained an estimated 37 billion dollars a year from immigrants&rsquo; contributions to their economy.</i></p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t we lucky!  Did it also say how much they cost us?   <br>
Oh! I thought not.</p>

		<p>More immigrants mean more people. More people mean more consumers and more job applicants. By the law of supply and demand that means higher prices, lower wages, and higher profits. If you are in the employer - investor class you benefit from a high rate of immigration. If you work for a pay check, you pay with a lower standard of living.<br>
 <br>
Liberals favor unlimited immigration because they refuse to acknowledge this. Economic conservatives agree with me that unlimited immigration is a major reason for the growing income gap. They disagree that this is a problem.</p>

<p>Perhaps.  But contributions today, like below market rate lawn care, have longer term costs like supporting indigents with free care at hosptials, education for their children and other welfare benefits.  The proper analysis must include the total lifetime costs.  Migrants are fine, but illegal or poorly chosen migrants are not fine in a technological society.</p>

		<p>Unemployment in the USA is currently around 10%.<br>
In Europe the situation is similarly grim, with Spain posting the inhuman figure of 20%.<br>
   And yet the bold-faced liars running the refugee industry still have the gall to insist the west is short of workers.<br>

		<p>An earlier post stated that the investor/employeer class can benefit from immigration while the poor worker suffers.</p>
<p>If you look hard enough there is someone that benefits from almost any activity, even crime.  I&rsquo;m sure your local car dealer isn&rsquo;t crying because your car gets stolen and you have to purchace a new vehicle. There is always a winner in every situation. The very day that I die will not be such a bad day for the undertaker. </p>
<p>Does immigration benefit the average American or only a select few? That&rsquo;s the real question. </p>

<p>This is a bald-faced lie.</p>

<p>Immigration Policy Costing American Workers $2,600 A Year<br>
A reader recently wrote us:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imagine my tremendous consternation at being caught, even after having read Alien Nation, by this dinner line:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Our economy is better off with immigrants. They do the jobs nobody else wants to do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I said to the last part. They just underbid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I couldn&rsquo;t address the first part, maybe because it&rsquo;s so large and unsubstantiated a claim. I just mentioned such things as: the shutdown of public hospitals in Los Angeles, welfare, crime, etc. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know of anyone with a statistical answer to the challenge, &lsquo;America is better off economically with the immigrants&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Statistical answer: surprisingly, this is actually one of the best-established findings in immigration economics &mdash; albeit the least publicized. </p>
<p>The 1995 findings of Harvard economist George Borjas [George Borjas, &ldquo;The Economic Benefits from Immigration,&rdquo; Journal of Economic Perspectives, Spring 1995] were confirmed by the National Research Council&rsquo;s 1997 report The New Americans: essentially all the increase in Gross Domestic product [GDP] brought about by immigration is captured by the immigrants themselves, in the form of wages. Virtually no benefit accrues to native-born Americans. </p>
<p>(And once transfer payments like welfare, education and healthcare are factored in, immigration becomes a net cost &mdash; for example, over $1,000 in annual extra taxes per native-born household in California. Americans are financing their own dispossession.)</p>
<p>Even less publicized: the Borjas model reveals the true economic consequence of immigration: a massive redistribution of wealth within the American native-born community &mdash; basically, from labor to capital, because of immigration&rsquo;s impact on wages.</p>
<p>The key variable: the rate at which native-born wages fall as the total number of workers rises &mdash; the so-called &ldquo;price elasticity&rdquo; of labor. Borjas estimates that each 10% increase in immigrant workers reduces native wages by about 3.5%. About 14% of employed workers in 2002 were immigrants. So the reduction in native wages attributable to immigrants that year was approximately 4.9% (35% of 14%). </p>
<p>As our reader told his dinner companions, it&rsquo;s true that immigrants don&rsquo;t do work Americans won&rsquo;t do &mdash; they just do it for less. </p>
<p>But, more importantly, immigrants do indeed do one dirty job: make it easier for Americans to exploit each other.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recalculated this immigration impact on the basis of the latest government data. This is how it came out: </p>
<p>Net economic gain from the immigrant presence to native-born Americans, before transfer payments: just 0.2 percent of GDP (that is, two-tenth of one percent!) in today&rsquo;s 10.4 trillion economy   &mdash;   that comes to a mere $84 per native-born American. </p>
<p>Native-born capital-owners&rsquo; gain as a result of immigration: about 3.1% of GDP, or $323.8 billion. This goes to employers and, for example, upper-income owners of stocks and employers of servants. </p>
<p>Native-born workers&rsquo; loss as a result of immigration: about 2.9% of GDP  &mdash; $302.9 billion in a $10.4 trillion economy, or a remarkable $2,578 for each native-born worker every year. <br>
