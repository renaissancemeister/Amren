<h1><a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-health/20101217/EU.MED.Tuberculosis.London/">London, Tuberculosis Capital of Western Europe</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Marcia Cheng, Comcast News, December 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The number of people infected with tuberculosis has jumped by 50 percent in London in the last decade, making it the tuberculosis capital of Western Europe, a new report says.</p>
<p>Unlike other countries in the region where tuberculosis is dropping, the disease is on the rise in Britain, particularly in London. In 1999, there were about 2,309 cases.</p>
<p>By 2009, London had 3,450 cases of Britain&rsquo;s more than 9,000 cases, according to an article published Friday in the medical journal, Lancet. Since only about 70 percent of active tuberculosis cases are picked up, those numbers are an underestimate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While tuberculosis remains rare in the U.K.  &mdash;  about 15 people per 100,000 people are infected  &mdash;  that is still higher than elsewhere in Western Europe. In France, an estimated 10 people per 100,000 have tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Once known as the &#8220;white plague&#8221; in England because of the loss of skin color in patients, tuberculosis was virtually wiped out after the introduction of drugs and vaccinations in the 1960s. But it has surged in recent years, including drug-resistant strains.</p>
<p>Most tuberculosis cases in Britain are in people born overseas, although not in recent arrivals. About 85 percent of people with tuberculosis have been in Britain for at least two years, meaning the disease is not being imported, but circulating locally.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rise in tuberculosis cases has nothing to do with migration and immigrants,&#8221; said Alimuddin Zumla of University College London, author of the commentary. &#8220;This is a fallacy that needs to be corrected,&#8221; he said, noting the same risks that plagued Victorian England  &mdash;  like poor housing, bad ventilation and overcrowding  &mdash;  are to blame for Britain&rsquo;s current outbreak.</p>

<p>A perfect example of double think.  The disease is circulating locally&hellip;within imported populations!!</p>

		<p>Of course it&rsquo;s not the fault of immigrants. It also won&rsquo;t be their fault in several years when they create an antibiotic-resistant strain of the disease by not taking their medication properly.</p>

<p>Alimuddin Zumla Lol, well someone with a name like that would say so. </p>

<p>Yes, but we havent had &#8216;Victorian conditions&rsquo; since  -well, Victorian times. You fool. </p>

		<p>This is the only paragraph that matters:</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
&ldquo;The rise in tuberculosis cases has nothing to do with migration and immigrants,&rdquo; said Alimuddin Zumla of University College London, author of the commentary. &ldquo;This is a fallacy that needs to be corrected,&rdquo; he said, noting the same risks that plagued Victorian England &mdash; like poor housing, bad ventilation and overcrowding &mdash; are to blame for Britain&rsquo;s current outbreak.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>First off, with our gene-typing capabilities, we can easily trace the epidemiological roots of any modern disease to it&rsquo;s geographic ground zero point.</p>
<p>Secondly, if it&rsquo;s overcrowded, why come?  If the ammenities are so poor, why come?  If you&rsquo;re _despised_ for your ignorant and vile social habits by the indigene peoples, why come?</p>
<p>This is not a question for Mr./Mz. Zumla to answer, as Mum Of 3  so aptly puts it, the agenda of that person is clear: More like me until it&rsquo;s all like we.</p>
<p>Instead, it&rsquo;s a question for whites to UNDERSTAND.  When conditions got bad in _pre_ Victorian England, the English left.  And gave their endemic diseases to native populations in North America and Africa and the Sub Continent among others.</p>
<p>And the reason whites left was because it was _crowded_.  Crowded to the point that social mobility was impossible and crowded to the point where demand ensured that rents in tenement like housing was so exhorbitant that a man could not afford a doctor for his sick kid, even if there was a treatment.</p>
<p>Non-whites are flooding our lands, not because they are overcrowded and hopeless in their own.  But because we give them FREE STUFF.  Including socialized medicine whose only obligation is to ensure it&rsquo;s own usefulness by lying about causation while treating (badly) the symptoms.  The new generation of immigrants doesn&rsquo;t know what &#8216;space&rsquo; is about.  They are USED TO being packed 6-8-10 to a home in their world.  Immured to it by generations of such hopelessness.</p>
<p>And that is why we must choose for them.  To save our own heightened sense of ourselves as parts of an OPEN ENVIRONMENT.<br>
Where our kids can grow up and our dreams can be realized, not free of charge.  But _free_.</p>
<p>Because these new peoples never will.</p>
<p>There is no open land left to settle in without oversight or pursuit on this planet people.  We are down to fighting for what we have.  Or losing it.</p>
<p>And which we choose will dictate the form of civilization (survivable replacement level K-Breeding or R-breeding biped locusts) human society morphs into in the 22nd century.</p>
<p>The planet itself cannot sustain the latter mode much longer.</p>

		<p>On a slightly similar theme: Even some people in that 3rd world hell hole called Haiti are blaming &#8220;immigrants&#8221; (UN Peace Keepers) from Nepal for their Cholera outbreak. It also appears that the authorities are taking this quite seriously.</p>
<p>2, Here in NSW the health authorities publish the names of food outlets such as restaurants that get caught for violating food hygiene standards. The offenders are mainly 3rd world ethnic.</p>
<p>3, An increase in TB here has also been blamed on 3rd world refugees. I don&rsquo;t think anyone has tried to deny this. It is also interesting that laws have recently been enacted against the disgusting habit of spitting in public. (This was definitely an &#8220;ethnic&#8221; problem)</p>
<p>Lets be totally honest many of these people come from places where a flush toilet is still science fiction and the use of soap and water is almost unheard of.</p>
<p>A final comment, friends who have just returned from the UK say London is awful, filthy and full of Muslims and foreigners.No doubt this includes UK public health expert Alimuddin Zumla.</p>

		<p>Riiight   &mdash;   and the reason teachers here in SoCA have to have TB screenings every 4 years is because of &#8220;resident&#8221; illegal aliens who NEVER go back to Mexico or Central America - they&rsquo;re just passing around germs right here in their barrios&hellip;.infecting teachers unlucky enough to be susceptible to the germs&hellip;..</p>

<p>This talk of crowding and no open land prompts me to mention also that England is an island and is already one of the most densely populated countries in the world.  It DOESN&rsquo;T NEED MORE PEOPLE! If there are people are looking for open lands to settle, England is one of the last places where they should be going. It is insane to stuff even more population into such a tightly packed little island. </p>
<p>Why are the British authorities so incredibly indifferent to this? </p>

		<p>A number of unpleasant diseases have been making there way into the Midwest via Hispanic immigrants (mostly illegals). Malaria, bed bugs, small pox, you name it, are coming back thanks to these diseased masses.  The Western world has, through our advanced sanitation and medical work banished most of these illnesses from our societies, which allowed a huge step forward.  The third world never went through these advancements, so the diseases remained. Thanks to incredibly liberal immigration and trade policies, these diseases are now returning to not only you, but also your descendants for generations to come. </p>

<p>Obviously, to our politicians and Powers-That-Be, diversity takes priority even over these afflictions. ANYTHING can  (and must)  be sacrificed in the name of holy Diversity. Diversity comes above all!  </p>
<p>What is this Diversity madness that has gripped us?</p>
<p>The TV has been harping about bedbugs lately, and there have been mailings from our politicians warning about a bedbug epidemic. It&rsquo;s distressing to note that in the lobby of my apartment building there is a notice that the building will be visited by a &#8220;special exterminator&#8221; for anyone who thinks they might have a need for it.  I don&rsquo;t have a need, thank goodness, but it is getting disturbingly close to home.</p>
<p>All this we must suffer, in the name of Diversity!!!</p>
