<h1><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/zimbabwe/8179368/White-farmers-return-to-Zimbabwe-land.html">White Farmers Return to Zimbabwe Land</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peta Thornycroft, Telegraph (London), Dec. 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At least 120 white farmers in Zimbabwe have returned to the land by setting up farms under leasehold deals with the black beneficiaries of Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s land seizure policies.</p>
<p>The emergence of a new group of white farmers has drawn bitter criticism from the victims of Mr Mugabe&rsquo;s violent occupation of properties sold under colonial era leases.<br>
 <br>
&#8220;These farmers handed Mr Mugabe victory,&#8221; said former Zimbabwe Tobacco Association president, Andy Ferreira.</p>
<p>In the ten years since Mr Mugabe ordered 4,000 white farmers off their land, Zimbabwe&rsquo;s economy has collapsed. A recent revival in agricultural production appears to have resulted from younger white farmers restoring fallow land to agriculture. </p>
<p>Mr Ferreira has called on international traders to shun tobacco grown on contested land as &#8220;blood tobacco&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mr Ferreira, an evicted farmer, said this new generation of white farmers did deals - often with Mr Mugabes cronies in the ruling Zanu PF party &#8220;because they like the life&#8221; and rewards of farming in one of Africa&rsquo;s most fertile nations. </p>
<p>Hendrik Olivier, director of the Commercial Farmers&rsquo; Union said, in some discomfort: &#8220;Yes it is happening. We advised these (white) farmers not to move onto land without permission from original owners&#8221; Some farmers are paying leases to the Zanu PF beneficiary and the original owner. Others are only paying the Zanu PF person who &#8220;acquired&#8221; the land and its improvements for free.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trevor Gifford, a past president of the CFU, who was forced off his farm in eastern Zimbabwe earlier this year said: :&#8221;I am relieved this is coming out. Some of these white farmers are behaving disgracefully.&#8221; </p>

		<p>This is making a pact with the devil. And those &#8220;collaborator&#8221; whitey farmers in Rhodesia had just better watch out. Robert approves of this now, but tomorrow he will want his due. The devil is smiles first, and then later you know what.</p>

		<p>The description for this article said &#8220;They are renting farms from blacks who stole them from other whites.&#8221; Didn&rsquo;t the whites get the land from blacks in the first place? I am all for white nationalist ideas, and that includes everyone staying in their homelands-whites included. We can not expect our logic to make sense to when we say we don&rsquo;t want non-European immigrants, yet complain about the treatment of white &#8216;immigrants&rsquo; in Africa.</p>

		<p>The original farmers were terrorized and had their farms stolen. Those stolen properties were then turned over to war criminals who lacked the ability to farm it themselves. But now those war criminals will profit by leasing the farms to others who do have the ability to farm it. </p>
<p>As a matter of principle, the situation is despicable. And yet the arrangement does make economic sense. The injustice is a bitter pill but if those farmers don&rsquo;t do it then Mugabe&rsquo;s cronies will just find someone else who will. And it should be safe for the farmers because any disruption will harm everyone&rsquo;s profits. </p>
<p>Still, there are risks involved. The main risks are that the cronies will try to stir up the locals against the farmers to put the squeeze on them. And that the cronies will try to establish some sort of sharecropping feudal system in which the farmers do the work and they get all the profits. If those farmers are wise they&rsquo;ll set enough money aside so that they can get out if the situation turns sour. </p>

		<p>As ever, the worst enemies of white people are other whites.</p>
<p>Now they have a situation where blacks rent out the land and whites do all the work. This only perpetuates Mugabes evil regime.</p>
<p>Its the white mans burden all over again.</p>

		<p>  One hundred and twenty doesn&rsquo;t seem like many out of 4,000. This is another attempt by the controlled media to play down the white genocide in Zimbabwe. After all, Robert Mugabe &ldquo;meant well&rdquo; he just wanted a more &ldquo;equitable&rdquo; society. The returning white farmers, who are probably destitute, will have no impact on the long term viability of Zimbabwe&rsquo;s agricultural economy.</p>

		<p>It won&rsquo;t be long before these whites are killed off, there is no doubt. The only way whites in Africa can survive in the long term is if they leave Africa all together. Africa is the home of Africans, they do not belong there, they belong in the Western world. Africa is a lost cause, and though our brothers and sisters there may try to maintain civilization and culture, it is like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic. Whatever is done is a waste of time, as the African masses will destroy any trace of Western culture over time.   To whites in Africa, I advise you to leave, if you can. My hopes and prayers go to our brothers and sisters who do not have the means to leave that hell.  </p>

		<p>To poster #2, a little known fact is that when the whites from Holland (and later England) began to settle and expand from the Cape northward into what is today South Africa, the land was, for the most part, devoid of people.</p>
<p>Nomadic bands of hottentots, usually around 20 per group, could be found occassionally, but it was basically empty land. (Dutch records that chronicle the nuisance caused by the thieving hottentots make fascinating reading.) </p>
<p>The zulus and other groups were expanding southward from central africa at the same time that whites were moving northward. </p>
<p>The famous zulu wars were not fought near the oceans, but hundreds of miles inland where the whites and blacks met.  After the zulus and others were mollified, they started working the land on the white farms and the good food and medical care brought by europeans allowed their population to multiply exponentially each year until today when they are tens of millions.</p>
<p>Apartheid was a policy instituted to keep the rapidly expanding black population from overwhelming the whites.  It wasn&rsquo;t slavery, just &#8216;apartness.&rsquo;  I do agree that it was a draconian policy and was hardly fair, if you believe in allowing people freedoms, but to the people of the time, it made sense.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I think the south african whites should have partitioned their country into separate nations when they had the chance.  They drank the kumbaya kool aid and now they are fleeing for their lives with nowhere to go.</p>

		<p>#2 Anonymous.The original land (bare bush) was occupied by whites who settled there while the Black Nomads passed through with their herds. The white farmers built houses, roads and eventually Towns and Cities from nothing. How did the Americans do the job? they had no Blacks at the time so they took it from the Redskins.Did they have to take New York? No   they had to build it first.</p>

		<p>2) I believe that most of the land was legally purchased or unused by the black tribes (they generally didn&rsquo;t have agriculture) although whites did steal some of it when we assumed political control over Africa.  I&rsquo;ve tried searching for the exact ratios but haven&rsquo;t been able to find it. Before the colonization era I believe the total African population was ~80 million, uninhabited land was very common. Modern day Haiti for example has 10 million on less than 1% of Africa&rsquo;s landmass.</p>
<p>That said, I generally don&rsquo;t believe in &#8220;generational justice&#8221; where we try to correct wrongs from hundreds of years ago. Especially when those wrongs are taken out of context, as they are in liberal history books.</p>

		<p>I wonder if Mugabee&rsquo;s Chinese advisors had any influence in this matter. When (and if) the Chinese take over, they will want a modern agricultural industry in place. </p>

<p>In no way am I condoning &#8216;Apartheid&rsquo;, but&hellip; SAfrica has a large population because of &#8216;illegal immigration&rsquo; also. This mass immigration occurred during the &#8216;Apartheid&rsquo; era. I guess the media didn&rsquo;t want to report on this &#8216;unfortunate&rsquo; spectacle of self-hate. The 700 club news show did report on this though. </p>

		<p>Mugabe should be an Amren icon.  More than any world leader, he believes in racial separation and by kicking whites out, he actually does something about it.  </p>
