			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Aaron Short, The Brooklyn Paper, December 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>No neighborhood in Brooklyn  &mdash;  perhaps the entire city  &mdash;  has experienced as much transformational change over the past decade as Williamsburg.</p>
<p>A longtime home to Puerto Rican and Dominican immigrants, Williamsburg&rsquo;s south side now includes fancy new condos, bars and restaurants. Where once was a riot of vacant warehouses and inexpensive bodegas along S. Fourth Street and S. Sixth Street is now a new restaurant row.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the influx of new bars and restaurants has flummoxed community leaders, such as El Puente founder Luis Garden Acosta, who said that many Latinos do not feel at home in &#8220;their own community&#8221; anymore.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a daily working-class ritual of coming home from work where mothers and fathers cook for their family,&#8221; said Acosta. &#8220;It&rsquo;s very different from a twentysomething single person who may be paying for one room with a shared kitchen. For them, it&rsquo;s much easier to go to a restaurant  &mdash;  at Southside prices.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the Census bureau, Williamsburg lost one-quarter of its Latino population while the number of white residents steadily increased.</p>
<p>In the heavily Hispanic Southside, Latinos still make up the majority in most Census tracts  &mdash;  53 percent in one zone, 65 percent in another and 72 percent in a third in the area around Kent Avenue, Grand Street, Broadway and Union Avenue.</p>
<p>But the influx of new residents caused median incomes to rise in many areas, as high as 22 percent, as new developments with Manhattan-style amenities began attracting the affluent.</p>
<p>As a result, rents shot up about 30 percent in some areas. {snip}</p>

<p>Usually, a neighborhood becoming more &#8220;Latino&#8221; is a neighborhood where rents are increasing, because the world famous propensity for &#8220;Latinos&#8221; to cram jam multiple people in a dwelling, most with some sort of job or welfare check which can be used toward rent, means that this bids rent prices sky high.</p>

		<p>Ah-HA!  Let them have a taste of their own medicine.  Whites in just about every neighborhood in New York have dealt with the same thing for decades.  They&rsquo;ve also said that they, &#8220;do not feel at home in &#8216;their own community&rsquo; anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>On a similar note, I was just looking at a fascinating map of the distribution of people by race in America.  It has five different colors of dots, each representing a certain number of people of one race, and also shows the racial percentages in each census tract.  Interestingly enough, New York was actually one of the most segregated cities in America.  Of course, there were huge tracts (especially in east Queens) where the racial mixing was almost too much to comprehend, but there were also whole swaths of land that are almost all-white.  In Brooklyn, for example, there were two or three census tracts (containing perhaps 5,000-10,000 people each) that were 100% white.  Also interesting - and disturbing - was the fact that Hispanics actually formed the largets group in two small, northern cities; Liberal, KS, and Yakima, WA.  I&rsquo;m not kidding, there&rsquo;s tons of Hispanics in the towns of the Middle-west and the North-west.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to see this map, just go to http://goo.gl/Xy2gy.  This is a really useful tool for anyone looking to purchase a house.  It lets you see which neighborhoods you should look at, and which should be avoided.</p>

<p>Let me get this straight. Hispanics made the place seedy and run-down, whites came in and fixed it up, and now Hispanics are complaining!?</p>
<p>If they want seedy and run-down, why don&rsquo;t they just move to South America!?</p>

<p><i>&#8220;According to the Census bureau, Williamsburg lost one-quarter of its Latino population while the number of white residents steadily increased.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>When the races are reversed, the controlled governmedia never fail to remind us that the departing Whites are Evil Racist Old Farts, too stupid or too Hateful to get with the program and embrace Holy Diversity.  And they certainly don&rsquo;t get the kind of respectful and sympathetic treatment that Aaron Short gives his beloved &#8220;latinos&#8221; in this article.</p>
<p>Probably the real irony is that those trendy, well-heeled Whites who are moving into Brooklyn were probably attracted there by all that wonderful Hispanic Diversity in the first place.  No doubt the more &#8220;latinos&#8221; who move out, the greater is the self-righteousness of the White liberals, who see the increasing cleanliness and safety of the area as &#8220;proof&#8221; that &#8220;minorities&#8221; are swell folks after all.<br>

		<p>They forgot to mention the attacks on young whites in Williamsburg a few summers ago. They go on all the time, but in this case the young men in question were attacking young, white hipsters with machetes. Yes, you read right, MACHETES! </p>
<p>That being said, anyone with half a brain knows that moving into and gentrifying Puerto Rican Hispanic neighborhoods is far safer than Black neighborhoods. The PR Hispanics just move out after rents rise. Blacks on the other hand stay riiight there, thanks to our government&rsquo;s free apartment program.</p>
<p>The most idiotic, liberal, Obongo supporters will actually willfully move to Black neighborhoods like Bed-Stuy and inevitably get to know the character of the noble savage firsthand! Every single friend of mine who lives in the Black areas has had a serious run-in in the &#8216;hood. </p>
<p>But the rents are soooo cheap!</p>

		<p>White flight has been taking place in NYC for the past 5 decades.  Williamsburgh is getting like Park Slope.  Young multicultural people like young Whites, mulattoes, Orientals, who are replacing the Hispanics.  I can tell you though that Brooklyn is becoming less habitable and Queens is as well; as a matter of fact Queens is probably the fastest demographically changing county in the US.  Because NYC has so many companies located here and people come here to make money, in more and more cases, other groups are actually replacing some Hispanics and Black neighborhoods.  There is evidence of Orientals, Indians and some others actually beginning to &#8220;invade&#8221; Harlem and &#8220;driving&#8221; the Blacks out if you ca believe this.  The Blacks and Hispanics don&rsquo;t like it.  Of course when this happens to them it&rsquo;s wrong and when they are the ones displacing Whites it&rsquo;s right.</p>

		<p>This demographic shift is of a pattern.The great and good liberals of NYC have segregated Manhattan. Black numbers have been greatly reduced,even in Harlem. Black neighborhoods on the West side are gone. Manhattan is largely lilly white.Brooklyn is next.Where have the lower class black and hispanics gone? To New Jersey and Long Island.Ny liberals love to tell the rest of the country how to live their lives, but by their actions they have mirrored the actions of the old South.Theres nary a peep from the NY Times.It seems that an all white city is good for buisness,tourism and peace of mind.</p>

<p>- Umm, those neighborhoods used to be 100% white up until about 50 years ago when the latinos first invaded, er, moved in and forced the whites out (by making the whites not feel at home, of course).</p>
<p>I go to Williamsburg all the time now and it&rsquo;s really great.  Awesome restaurants, little &#8216;Main Street&rsquo; kinds of novelty stores.  It is a cool place to hang out and it&rsquo;s wall-to-wall white people.</p>
<p>The irony is that those same whites consider themselves VERY liberal, but the irony of their white re-colonization of the area escapes them.</p>
<p>My girlfriend, who grew up in NYC here, told me that back just 15 years ago, Williamsburg was a horrible, seedy place filled with muggers, prostitutes and gangs.  Of course, we know what the demographics of the area were back then.</p>

		<p>I guess I could be considered one of these white yuppies.  While I dont live in Williamsburg, I did live in NYC my entire life.. in one of the lily white areas.  after my Husband and I got married, we looked at homes in Williamsburg.  I didnt know it at the time, but that is where my Grandma grew up.  She could not believe we were looking at homes there as she and her family fled that area in the past.  Needless to say, she was kind of proud that whites were taking these areas back and turning them into beautiful cultural havens.</p>
<p>Ultimately we settled outside of NYC along the hudson in NJ.  We live in a largely white &amp; asian area, but a short drive away is 100% hispanic.</p>

<p>When my neighborhood of West New York, N.J. was invaded in the 60&rsquo;s, the crooked politicians raved about how these &#8220;industrious&#8221; people revitalized the town. I couldn&rsquo;t see how turning a working class town into a third world barrio was revitalization.</p>

<p>Hispanic diversity can be found all over the place.  You don&rsquo;t have to go to Williamsburg.  The far more likely answer is that Williamsburgh is just a subway stop away from Manhattan, right across the river, thus making it ideal for those who want the convenience of Manhattan living but don&rsquo;t want to pay Manhattan prices.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been in Williamsburgh in ages, but I know there used to be a large Orthodox Jewish community.  I wonder if they are still there, of if they long ago evacuated the place. Odd that there&rsquo;s no mention of them in the story.</p>

		<p>I grew up in this neighborhood. It was Hasidic Jew, Latinos, a few blacks, and Italians. The area where the whites live now and rebuilding this hip neighborhood was mostly in a Latino area flooded with poverty, drugs, and run down tenements mostly owned by the Jews from the same neighborhood. What are the Latinos crying about? They had their chance. The same thing is happening now in the Bushwick area not to far away from Williamsburgh.  Trust me the people welcome it.  I only caution the brave whites who venture into these neighborhoods to be mindful that you stand a chance of being injured by the natives who see you as their prey. <br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I posted here on Amren but I couldn&rsquo;t resist this article. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been living in between Wburg and the Lower East Side for the past 10 years. I now live right in the heart of Wburg on Bedford Avenue. Everything the article mentioned is true. Whites have taken over. Thank God! You should see what a great place Wburg is now. Full of great restaurants, unique boutiques, great nightlife, etc&hellip; It&rsquo;s full of mostly twenty something White and Asians. </p>
<p>The few Latinos who still live here all live in rent controlled apartments paying a fraction of what everyone else pays. They&rsquo;ll be gone soon enough. </p>
<p>Wburg and the LES have made some of the most dramatic transformations of any neighborhood in NYC, even more so than Harlem in my opinion. No worries though, Harlem is looking better and better each year. I give it another 10 years before it&rsquo;s almost completely white and Asian. The blacks can&rsquo;t last that much longer there. It already looks totally different from 10 years ago. </p>
<p>What good news! </p>
