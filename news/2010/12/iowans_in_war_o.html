			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Philip Brasher, Des Moines Register, December 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Objections that Rep. Steve King and other Republicans have raised to a settlement with black farmers &#8220;have kind of a funny smell about them,&#8221; Sen. Tom Harkin said today, escalating a war of words among prominent Iowans over the issue.</p>
<p>King, R-Ia., this week called for a congressional investigation into possible fraud in discrimination claims paid to black farmers. The House approved a bill appropriating more than $1 billion for a new round of payments.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>King argues that the eligibility standards in the case are too lax, because claimants don&rsquo;t have to prove they were discriminated against. {snip} He acknowledged that the issue makes southern Republicans uncomfortable. &#8220;They cringe because they don&rsquo;t want to have to deal with the subject,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Harkin said there is no evidence that past discrimination claims by black farmers have been riddled with fraud and that the latest settlement has adequate safeguards. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2007, blacks operated 31 farms in Iowa out of nearly 93,000 statewide, according to the Agriculture Department.<br>

		<p>I still don&rsquo;t understand why they need to be given money just because they didn&rsquo;t get some loans.  (Loans are not &#8216;owed&rsquo; to anybody.)</p>
<p>Why not just tell the black farmers to just line up and we&rsquo;ll give them all the loans they want?  Then they can go farm and pay them back over 20 years!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll never happen.</p>

		<p>What!? Some Republicans are hinting that black claims of Discrimination might be less than the gospel truth?  Racism!  Shout down the heretics!  It&rsquo;s gotta be <i>Racism</i>!</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Harkin said there is no evidence that past discrimination claims by black farmers have been riddled with fraud &#8220;</i></p>
<p>Say that again, Tom?  Do you mean that past claims were actually <i>investigated</i> for validity?</p>
<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t think so.  They were no more validated than this latest round of black gimme-mongering will be, if you and your RINO pals get their way.</p>
<p>Sorry, Tom.  Your whinings have&hellip;kind of a funny smell about them.  And a very familiar one.<br>

		<p> The &#8220;settlement&#8221; itself has kind of a funny smell about it. Can you say, &#8220;shakedown&#8221;? Blacks will never quit pulling these stunts on the U.S. until the White majority (we ARE still a majority, aren&rsquo;t we?) puts its foot down and says, &#8220;No! No more! No more extra payments to black farmers, no more &#8216;settlements&rsquo; of other racially-tinged lawsuits, and no reparations!&#8221;</p>
<p> Until we grow some backbone (we used to have one   &mdash;   remember?), each of these cases will be, to paraphrase Winston Churchill, &#8220;just another sip of a bitter cup that will be proffered to us again and again.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Can you say &#8220;backdoor reparations&#8221;, just how many black farmers has American had in it&rsquo;s history? I am guessing not many, but I am sure there are a whole lot of black people now claiming to be a &#8220;farmer&#8221;. And this article says 1 billion was appropriated for a &#8220;new round of payments&#8221;. Exactly how many rounds of payments are we going to have hand over to &#8220;black farmers&#8221;?</p>

A rough estimate of 31 black farmers in 50 states would be about 1550 black farmers in the US in 2007.</p>
<p>If we assume a completely new generation of black farmers approximately every 20 years for 200 years, that would make approximately 15500. Double that and you get 31000 black farmers. Double it again and you get 62000 black farmers.</p>
<p>Even if there were 62000 (or 80000 as claimed), not every one could claim discrimination.</p>
<p>When Pigford vs. Glickman was settled, I said I could live with it IF it settled the issue once and for all. Of course, I knew it wouldn&rsquo;t be the end. Neither will this second judgment.</p>
<p>The only question is what is the next convoluted justification blacks will use to extort more money.</p>
<p>The barn door is open and the stampeed is on.<br>

		<p>Yes, blacks should always prove discrimination and it should cost them when their claims are proven to be a scam (as was the whole Civil Rights Movement to begin with)</p>

		<p>If these were white farmers in south africa, then they would be killed, not given money. Amazing how blacks have no guilt in Africa. Apparently only white guilt exists. White liberal guilt, handing over white money to blacks. </p>

<p>Wayne:</p>
<p>Not everywhere are we Whites a majority.  Come to California and you&rsquo;ll see what YOUR state will look like soon.  Blacks are being systematically driven out of California by hispanics, who don&rsquo;t want blacks around them in neighborhoods, schools or prisons   &mdash;   and aren&rsquo;t afraid to use violence to achieve this end. </p>
<p>After we Whites are reduced or gone, and this country broken up along racial/ethnic lines, blacks will be welcome exactly nowhere, their whines met with bullets.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll realize old Whitey was the best friend they ever had.</p>

		<p>blacks are settling in their stronghold - atlanta and dc. they own and control these cities. even they know detroit is now in ruins and time to move on.</p>
<p>by having our jails majority maurading psychotic blacks&hellip; it is basically a huge political deterrent to WHITES against ever going against the government. a white being set to jail is a death sentence, for a black  its a family reunion</p>

		<p>There have been NO instances of racial discrimination levied against the FDA&rsquo;s employees.  Yet the FDA has taken it upon themselves to pay out billions to far more &#8220;farmers&#8221; than were in existence.  If I don&rsquo;t have to be a farmer to have my claim processed, perhaps I should also claim (falsely) I am black.</p>

		<p>As for Tom Harkin (who should have been sent packing years ago), he could not spot fraud perpetrated by minorities if some of these charming people sold him Iowa oceanfront property.  How the people of Iowa keep sending this nincompoop back to DC is amazing. Can any Iowans in the audience offer any excuses?</p>

		<p>It says here somewhere that there are now 31 black farmers in Iowa, so that can only mean that discrimination and racism have resulted in this alarmingly low number.  Therefore, these 31 survivors are obviously entitled to, say, five million or so each in reparations.  Seems only fair, right?</p>
