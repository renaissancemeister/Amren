<h1>Chicago Police See Spike in Cop Killings, Assaults</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Don Babwin, San Francisco Chronicle, December 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Five police officers have been killed in the line of duty this year  &mdash;  the most in at least 25 years. A sixth police officer was gunned down as he sat in his vehicle while off-duty just a few days before Flisk&rsquo;s death. Add to that, the number of reports of batteries on police officers has nearly tripled in just over a decade.</p>
<p>In 2009, there were just under 3,300 reports of battery on a police officer, more than twice as many as were reported in 2002 and nearly triple the number reported in 1999.</p>
<p>Police say the most dramatic jump came after the process of reporting the batteries was fully automated in 2004, when it became more accurate. But between 2007 and 2009 the number of reports climbed from 2,677 to 3,298  &mdash;  a 23 percent increase  &mdash;  and this year the number is on pace to climb well past 3,000 again.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a lack of respect for the police, a lack of fear of the police that&rsquo;s getting worse,&#8221; said Officer Nick Spencer, a 17-year-department veteran. &#8220;They see a cop, and they just don&rsquo;t care anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Officers routinely return to their station with stories about rocks and other debris pinging off their squad cars as they respond to calls or being confronted by crowds that no longer disperse just because an officer tells them to. Also, the sound of gunfire that used to stop whenever they arrived at a scene now continues long afterward.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But he has said many times in the last several months that criminals are becoming increasingly brazen, and clearly he has been baffled in recent months by people who don&rsquo;t hesitate to take on a police officer.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It was a similar story when off-duty Officer Thomas Wortham IV was shot and killed when he tried to stop a group of men from stealing his motorcycle.</p>
<p>&#8220;He identified himself as a police officer and they still killed him,&#8221; Spencer said.</p>
<p>Another officer, Michael Bailey, was shot and killed while washing his car outside his home after returning from working the overnight shift, where he was assigned to protect Mayor Richard Daley&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>The department has about 1,000 fewer officers than the 13,500 it had as recently as March 2008, according to the police union. As the department scrambles to cover the city  &mdash;  more officers are riding alone in squad cars, dubbed &#8220;rolling coffins&#8221; by beat cops  &mdash;  there is a growing concern that the uptick in violence is linked to the smaller force.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>With Weis saying more than half the homicides committed in the city this year involved gangs, police say they have no doubt that many of the assaults and at least some of the police slayings were committed by known gang members  &mdash;  including the 19-year-old parolee charged with killing Flisk.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some of that escalating violence, police say, may be due to changes in the gangs.</p>
<p>Lt. Thomas Waldera said gangs are far less structured than ever because many gang leaders have been sent to prison  &mdash;  resulting in less organization and control among members who are not only more likely to attack rivals but members of their own gangs.</p>

		<p>I notice an interesting fact was scrubbed from this version of this article.  Crime, supposedly, is down in chicago.</p>
<p>The contradiction has an obvious cause to anyone familiar with what has happened in the past in say, New York City.  Police are routinely fudging crime statistics to make things appear far safer than they are.  This is to prevent a detroit style mass migration of whites out of chicago.</p>
<p>Obviously, the rank and file cops are figuring out this isn&rsquo;t true.</p>

<p>And what, if I may be so Racist as to ask, was the ethnic makeup of those gangs?  It can&rsquo;t have been White, or that fact would have been trumpeted from the rooftops by the controlled governmedia.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Lt. Thomas Waldera said gangs are far less structured than ever because many gang leaders have been sent to prison &mdash; resulting in less organization and control among members who are not only more likely to attack rivals but members of their own gangs.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Now <i>there&rsquo;s</i> logic for you.  It has nothing to do with the race of the criminals, you see.  It&rsquo;s all because their leaders   &mdash;   strong, concerned fellows with a gift for organization   &mdash;   have been clapped in jail, presumably by the Racist Criminal Justice System.  If they had only been allowed to roam free, I&rsquo;m sure they would have prevented those unruly gang members from being so irresponsible.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that the police union&rsquo;s primary interest lies in membership numbers, which appear to be their only concern.  Certainly the problem can&rsquo;t have <i>anything whatever</i> to do with Chicago&rsquo;s level of black and mestizo populations.</p>

<p>Tell the NAACP, the Congressional Black Caucus, The ADL, LA Raza and the SPLC about it, Nick.  And while you&rsquo;re at it, drop a note to the current occupant of the White (sic) House, would you?  <br>

		<p>I have had family living in Chicago my Dad&rsquo;s old brothers and sisters still live on the far Northwest side one of few White areas left. My Grandparents home of 47 years where they would raise 12 children is now in an all hispanic neighborhood with a big black gate in front of it. It is all so sad. In 1960 Whites madeup of 75% of the population of the city and it was truly a world class city, today Whites are less than 1/3 of the population and the city is a disaster.</p>

<p>Has anyone noticed that most all the cops killed are white and the perp black?</p>
<p>I read an article not long ago that said the Chicago gangs have members on the police force who flash gang signs.  It&rsquo;s claimed that they can&rsquo;t be fired for just belonging to a gang.  The US military is said to be rife with them as well.</p>
<p>These are just a few more examples of the deterioration of the police forces and military in the last days of this dying empire, and the brazenness of non-white criminals.</p>
<p>Martial law with these politically correct whites and non-white clowns in charge and a rapidly disintegrating military where blacks are in leadership roles means whites are going to be at a distinct disadvantage.</p>
<p>However, the separation in the police forces is occurring right now, as many military and police are breaking along lines of politics now, but racial lines soon.    </p>
<p>There is, however, one military/police organization that swears the following oath to protect the people AND the constitution. It consists of active and inactive military and police, but associate memberships are open to anyone who wants to join.  They&rsquo;re called Oathkeepers, and they deserve our support.<br>
Note photos of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan that have &#8220;Oathkeeper&#8221; patches on their left shoulders.  Many prefer to remain anonymous and don&rsquo;t wear the patches.</p>
<p>The founder appeared on the O&rsquo;Reilly Factor a short while ago, which, I&rsquo;m sure increased membership considerably.  He made an excellent account of himself and his organization.</p>

		<p>Perhaps this will turn out like Cincinnati, OH, where a decade ago a number of police were being killed each year. When police killed an unarmed black youth in there in Cincinnati, activists took note and a riot ensued and it became a major issue. Not that police were being killed, but that police killed a black youth.  </p>

		<p><i>Officers routinely return to their station with stories about rocks and other debris pinging off their squad cars as they respond to calls or being confronted by crowds that no longer disperse just because an officer tells them to.</i></p>
<p>This behavior is not uncommon in minority neighborhoods. In Bel-Ridge, Missouri it was common for the police to have: rocks, bottles, and other debris thrown at them when they entered the section-8 housing complex off of Springdale Road near Natural Bridge Road. Sometimes the residents there would even shoot at them. This is not dissimilar to what happened to officers in Cabrini Green in Chicago when they went into the project housing towers there. Cops wouldn&rsquo;t enter that project without backup if they had a choice. It was a way of announcing who owns this spot, and that it is not the police. </p>
<p>As much as I sympathize with officers patrolling these zones, it is not without the understanding that most of these officers treat these areas, and indeed many white areas,  as simply occupied territory rather than as public servants. I see far too often where the police respond to a situation that would have been talked down in the past with: the civilian equivalent of tanks, riot gear, tear gas, and/or military assault style tactics. Even trying to hold a simple protest brings in such things as &#8220;free speech zones&#8221;, cordoned off areas, police in riot gear, brutal beatings, and agent provocateurs.  </p>
<p>I see far too often police respond with 5 squad cars for a simple speeding ticket, felony stop techniques, and policing trained to treat everyone as the enemy. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I do understand it. I do understand that minorities don&rsquo;t respond the same way, but I grew up in a different America. I grew up in an America with different promises, and different expectations. An America where law enforcement could generally be counted upon to serve &amp; protect, rather than to occupy, and oppress. That America is gone, and the way Law Enforcement Officers respond to even the most casual of encounters has changed because of it. We are all losing our freedoms to it; we are all the worse for it, and far more likely to deal with a confrontation than we would be otherwise. Perhaps these freedoms are not compatible with having a large minority population, but the federal government keeps allowing more minorities in, and it seems at most points to be outside of the wishes of the majority of the people. </p>
<p>The extent to which the government deals with its citizens in harsh, arbitrary ways, and like an occupation force is reflected in a great number of things. An example of which is our child support system. 50% of marriages end in divorce, and a certain number of these involve children. Even though most people pay if they are able, this system has been granted far reaching, and draconian powers to compel payment, and abuse the citizens subject to it. As much as the Internal Revenue Service is feared; the IRS does not reach for the most draconian, and abusive of its powers on a routine, and arbitrary basis. However, the child support system does, and this mess is automated in many states.  Drivers license suspension is routine, passport revocation, professional licenses suspension, hunting license suspension, denial of &#8220;entitlement&#8221; benefits (food stamps, medicaid, medicare), and other benefits is routine, and automated, as is the seizure of bank accounts, securities, properties, etc. These things were reserved once for recalcitrant blacks that did not pay under any circumstances, but they are now applied to the middle class in an automated manner. 65% of income seized is not enough, and 12% left to live on it &#8220;just too much&#8221; for &#8220;deadbeat dads&#8221; who find themselves unemployed, and unable to change the nature of their obligations in a system that doesn&rsquo;t respond to economic realities such as the loss of a job. Tax returns are intercepted, bank accounts seized (even if they are setup for automatic payment of support), and if one is in arrears, its not enough that 65% of income can be seized, anything one owns from a joint account, to property, to a motor vehicle can be seized, and often is as a matter of automated process as due course. </p>
<p>What does this have to do with you, you ask? You work, you do what you can! Yet, you are subject to this if you find yourself divorced, or with alimony. A simple job loss, and one can find themselves on the business end of this. Parental rights are always in question, and the state claims powers it does not have routinely. While blacks <i>are</i> more sociopathic. they are far more likely to have encountered these things on a routine basis. The loss of a job, and one finds oneself a the end of a heavy, and oppressive stick if it happens There is no justice, there is no ability beyond a few short months to dispute paternity, and little to no allowance for a change in circumstances, despite what the law claims to allow.  For no other reason than one finds themselves unemployed one can be dragged into a pit from which they cannot recover, and can not use the truth, and a lack of income to defend themselves.</p>
<p><br>
White Americans are finding themselves in a similar bind, even those that were once middle class. When people can&rsquo;t get justice inside of the system, and indeed many blacks, and many whites cannot   &mdash;   it leads to a disrespect for the law. Similarly, much of the war on drugs leads to a similar disrespect. </p>
<p>The response to this has been to crack down even harder. At some point this response triggers outright disdain, anger, and disrespect of the law entirely.  Police are no longer helpful servants, but simply an occupying force that helps extort them. Too many of us were fine when this response was largely subject to minorities only, but we balk when its everyone, and for good reason. We balk at injustice. The system has reached a point where either our freedoms disappear, and we accept the loss of 1:10 men among us, or we start acting out because what is going on isn&rsquo;t right.  Blacks do all of the above, out of a sense what is happening isn&rsquo;t right, and knowing they don&rsquo;t have a recourse to get justice, and because they have a higher degree of sociopathic behavior. </p>
<p></p>
<p>In general Amren reflects my views, but in this case, I do understand the counter to those views, and why they are counter. I also understand we fail to live up to the standards we set largely because our minority populations are unwilling to come to terms with them, and the laws tend to be applied to everyone eventually. We have legit reason to gripe, but we have legit reason to gripe when the laws are applied disparately period&hellip;in this case we have reason to gripe when they are not, because they exceed reason, and justice; however, we have a history with this e.g. prohibition, a law most of didn&rsquo;t want once we had thought about it. </p>
<p>Fixing these broken laws, or allowing some process for justice wont fix the race problem, and it wont stop blacks from reacting to the feeling the police are merely an occupation force, but it might allow us to reign in the worst of abuses, and return our police to a position of helpful public servants versus one where we are to be subservient to them, and our values turned upon their head. While blacks will always have a higher crime rate, the sympathy for this will disappear when unjust laws have due process, and have some means for those wronged to address those wrongs. </p>
<p>What do you hold dear? What rights do you hold dear? What of them are you willing to sacrifice to achieve a government that becomes more &amp; more abusive?  </p>
<p>Amren rarely asks that questions, but it is the one on my mind when I read stories like this. </p>

<p>Large portions of Chi have been controlled by the gangs for at least a forty year period.</p>
<p>Colonel David Hackworth has stated that street gangs even a number of decades ago pose a real internal security risk to the U.S. in way that is frightening. Have the numbers, money, organization, weaponry, mental wherewithal to use violence in a staggering way. Chicago is not the exception. That cops are now being HUNTED in the manner that they are is somewhat different but not all that unusual.</p>
<p>The laws as written for the juvenile justice system, so called,are totally inadequate too. Who would have ever thought a 12 year old would obtain a handgun and deliberately hunt a cop to kill with intent? Happens now!</p>

Waldera said those gang members don&rsquo;t seem nearly as concerned about the police as they once did.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re not afraid of us at all anymore,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Most are not stupid enough to fight it out with the police, but there is something going on.&#8221;<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>What did you expect?  Economies are crashing, new multicult is moving in next door to the established diversicrud already in place and bangers and crooks everywhere are facing pressure to make ends meet off their 2-3 girlfriends without having to face down other rivals to the same business they are in.</p>
<p>As cultural islanding and Bowling Alone effects hit the barrios and ghettos in equal hard measures, first, so too will the natives becomes a lot more restless and the residents a lot more savage.  &#8216;Then along comes a car painted like a gurnsey cow as authority unable to entitle&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And bam you&rsquo;re a hated symbol and a statistic all in one.</p>
<p>In this, it was also a grave mistake to jail so many gang bosses without overtly, quickly, brutally, executing them as their &#8216;boys&rsquo; were forced to watch the example being made.</p>
<p>Because a gang provides a sense of home and society only so long as it&rsquo;s authority figures don&rsquo;t look vulnerable and inept in their own positions.  Take away a thug&rsquo;s father figure as the guy who at least has -some- awareness of organization and order behind his admittedly criminal acts and you leave homey with no one to tell him where to buy drugs or how to split up the profits so that everyone gets a cut.  Which means he&rsquo;d better be scared bleepless about getting caught and killed, himself.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no honor among thieves, thugs and bangers.  </p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that there isn&rsquo;t a beneficial hierarchy.  </p>
<p>We saw this happen in New York in the 90s when the last of the Italian and Sicilian mafia were run out, only to be replaced by a polymorphous bunch of Russians, Jamaicans, Columbians, Mexicans and Asians of every flavor.  The cancer that is crime metastasized at twice the rate in the resulting vacuum and now it&rsquo;s everywhere with virtually 10 times as many ethnies to infiltrate and half as many ethnic-specific cops able to do it.</p>
<p>Get a clue and pull up the new millenium coppers.</p>

		<p>The suspect in Ofc. Flisk&rsquo;s murder really wasn&rsquo;t a known gang banger.  He returned to the scene where he committed armed robbery against another man several days previous, in order to clean up evidence.  When he got there, he overheard Flisk and former CHA Ofc. Steven Peters saying that they&rsquo;ve got clean prints (presumably the suspect&rsquo;s), so the suspect came out of hiding and greased them both.  These were the typical murders of a low IQ man.</p>
<p>As for Chicago as a whole, along with everything else, there is one big reason why black-on-cop assaults are on the rise.  It happened about two years ago.  It&rsquo;s spelled O-B-A-M-A.</p>

		<p>There are several interpretations here:</p>
<p>One is that the criminal element/gangs are becoming more militant. Crime is assuming the form of low level insurgency in American cities.</p>
<p>Another is that respect for law enforcement is down for any number of reasons: one is the war on drugs, with the usual impact that prohibition has on criminalizing &#8220;victimless crimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another might be due to political factors in which gang organizations are being used as muscle by sectors of the Chicago political establishment (to get out the vote, for example). The gangs then become a counterbalance to the police, a sort of urban paramilitary. </p>
<p>And finally, we have to look at how PC indoctrination for decades has vilified the white power structure; thus respect for these institutions is declining and with that decline, comes more of a willingness to take on the police who are seen as the front for white &#8220;oppression&#8221; of the urban underclass.</p>
<p>Be interesting  to see if this degenerates into urban guerrilla warfare. </p>

		<p>Gangs are to blame? Let&rsquo;s clarify it, then. By calling it Black or Latino gangs!</p>
<p>Oh, never mind. That could be construed as being politically incorrect. </p>

		<p>This is a prelude to Zimbabwe all of our largest cities. NY, Chicago, LA, and especilly that anus of the contiguous 48 New Orleans are becoming 3rd world hell holes. What could be worse than living in a s__t city like those. </p>
<p>Soon there will be no place to hide and as Barbara Spector says it will be the role of the Jew to intercede as we become more multicultural. Just like Europe. </p>

		<p>&#8220;There is a lack of respect for the police, a lack of fear of the police that&rsquo;s getting worse&#8221;</p>
<p>There is a lack of respect for everyone and everything now, (including oneself) that is permeating all of society; not just blacks, though it is overtly true of blacks. To blacks the word &#8216;respect&rsquo; simply means fear and intimidation; to &#8216;disrespect&rsquo; someone is just not fearing them. The true meaning of respect is foreign to them.</p>
<p>Even worse, nothing, not even life, has more value to them than respect. Losing one&rsquo;s life is meaningless. Losing one&rsquo;s respect is deadly.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve moved back to Lakefront SS. Chicago where I was raised. I lived in New York City during the worst, pre Gulliani years 1985-91. </p>
<p>Chicago&rsquo;s racial, crime situation has stayed about the same these last 30 years - there are huge geographical areas that are simply third world, but if you know how to handle yourself you shouldn&rsquo;t have too many problems. </p>
<p>For the police, it should just be acknowledged that we have a Brazilian style situation where many areas are Third World and it makes no sense to have English style policing in areas where the only thing that is respected is military incursions.</p>
<p>It many ways, Chicago is a good place for racially conscious Whites to live, because everyone knows the score and there are few idiots - liberals or libertarians or race denying Religious Right Conservatives around saying or doing stupid things.</p>
<p>Everyone who has anything positive going for them wants the worst of the Blacks, Latrinos &#8220;kept down, moved away&#8221;.</p>
<p>In politics - it&rsquo;s often good to support mixed race women candidates - as they know the worst of the underclass Black, Black men.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not afraid of us at all anymore,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Most are not stupid enough to fight it out with the police, but there is something going on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That &#8220;something&#8221; going on is the incremental evolution of criminal elements transitioning from crime to a kind of low intensity warfare with deadly intentions.  These kinds of incidents have  preceded nearly every armed insurgency.  They&rsquo;re occurring in Mexico right now, only on a more intense level than they are here.  </p>
<p>The motivation, however, is different.  In Mexico it is solely to advance their criminal enterprises.  In the US, most of black violence is the result of what blacks feel are paybacks against whitey who they have been taught to hate.</p>
<p>As in Mexico, the gangs in the US are particularly dangerous because they acquire huge profits through the sale of narcotics, which enables them to direct their attention to what they believe are paybacks to the police and whites in general.</p>

		<p>As bad as it is now,wait until the hispanic drug gangs get even more ingrained in our urban areas. Our cities will be worse than Baghdad or Kabul. There will be IED&rsquo;s,grenades,and RPG&rsquo;s added to an already potent arsenal.The savagery will be even worse than now.Maybe this is what it will take for Whites to rise up and say enough.</p>

		<p>Many areas of the country are now occupied by populations and cultures that are utterly foreign to Western civilization. Our laws, courts,policing methods, and education systems evolved over hundreds of years to serve people that think and act a certain way. These institutions can not work for people that not only reject but are outright hostile to Western values.  These so-called gangs are actually foot soldiers, a vanguard of these alien cultures, and are fully supported- financially, physically, and morally, by their &#8220;communities&#8221;.  The foreign cultures are allowed to fester by the Globalist Banksters and their puppets in CONgress for the express purpose of weakening Western civilization in this country to make it so much more easier to loot and rule over.</p>

		<p>I have lived in Chicago for almost 25 years, and it is a better city now than it was before.  Many areas of the city which were black have been reclaimed by white yuppies and the center city areas are thriving.  The huge increase in Mexicans has driven many blacks to the southern suburbs.  I&rsquo;ll walk around Mexican neighborhoods while I won&rsquo;t walk around black neighbornoods.  The infamous Cabrini Green housing project has been torn down and turned into expensive housing.  </p>

		<p>They don&rsquo;t care anymore? Those criminals haven&rsquo;t cared for a long, long time. The last time those types ever had any kind of real fear or respect for the police was about 50 years ago. By an astonishing coincidence, that was also right before the snivel rights (bowel) movement got into full swing. </p>

		<p>Salt comments: <i>White Americans are finding themselves in a similar bind, even those that were once middle class. When people can&rsquo;t get justice inside of the system, and indeed many blacks, and many whites cannot  &mdash;  it leads to a disrespect for the law.   </i></p>
<p><br>
Unfortunately, he is making a good point here. You trap people within an increasingly draconian system, and respect for the law erodes. </p>
<p>Yeah, there are a lot of bad guys among the minorities.  But there are decent people who are getting the short end of the stick when it comes to things like the aforementioned child support regime, the war on drugs, and even gun control.  Look at the recent case in NJ where an otherwise law abiding citizen got a seven year jail sentence for possessing a firearm.  The difference is that blacks seem more willing to do something, even if it is toss rocks at police cars. </p>
<p>The question is, why has the white middle class for so long put up with being dispossessed by its own government?  Why aren&rsquo;t whites out in the streets rioting over affirmative action, or outsourcing, or illegal immigration, or PC indoctrination, and all the rest? Why the passivity in the face of the new degradations at the airport the TSA cooks up periodically?  The best that can be done, it seems, is some tepid tea parties. </p>
<p>The police are the visible representative of the system.  So they get the rocks tossed at them, and the occasional bullet. The real problem is much higher up, in a system which is betraying all Americans.  Can we honestly say that the government   &mdash;   or corporations or media or universities   &mdash;   represents the interests of the majority of Americans?  </p>

		<p>Ranger (17) got hit the nail on the head with his comment about low-intensity warfare.  Tom Chittum had lots and lots to say about the same issue in &#8220;Civil War Two.&#8221;  Californian (12) mentions that the gangs are being used as muscle by some elements in the Chicago establishment as a counterweight to the police.  This is exactly what went on in Haiti with the &#8220;Ton-Ton Macoutes&#8221;.</p>
<p>In the short term, what I think we will see is a progressive &#8220;de-policing&#8221; of these trouble areas, perhaps with periodic, heavy incursions based on the Brazilian model later on.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s where the &#8216;whites are all privileged&rsquo; and &#8216;people of color are all poor victims&rsquo; propaganda comes in. Make it constant from all sources and whites who are having their country and their very lives taken from them will believe they are lucky or even superior. </p>
