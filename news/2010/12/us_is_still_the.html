<h1><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/dec/14/united-states-immigration-numbers-perucca">US Is Still the World&rsquo;s Leading Destination for Immigrants</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Guardian (London), December 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In a study published last month, France&rsquo;s Demographic Studies Institute (Ined) lists countries that have the largest number of migrants in absolute or relative terms, and also where the millions of migrants come from.</p>
<p>Although a large number leave their homes in the developing world in search of work in industrialised countries, there is still significant movement between emerging economies, and from one part of the developed world to another.</p>
<p>Of the 214 million people living outside their home country (just over 3% of the world&rsquo;s population, according to a UN estimate published this year), 62 million left a country in the south for a destination in the north. Migration between countries in the south involved 61 million people, against 53 million in the north.</p>
<p>With 43 million foreign nationals on American territory in 2010, according to UN forecasts, the US remains the world&rsquo;s prime destination for immigration, well ahead of Russia, with 12.3 million immigrants. In all, some 13% of the population were born outside the US. For the last five years its &#8220;migratory balance&#8221;  &mdash;  the difference between the number of people entering and leaving the country  &mdash;  is estimated at 1 million a year.</p>
<p>In most other industrialised western democracies the proportion of immigrants ranges from 7% to 16%, according to Ined. This category includes Germany (13%), France (11%), the UK and the Netherlands (10%), and Belgium (9%). Spain is a relative newcomer, having only become a big destination for immigration in the past 20 years, with a peak in 2002-07. Immigrants now account for 14% of the population.</p>
<p>But in terms of the share of the total population these countries have fallen far behind the Gulf states, where immigrants sometimes outnumber the natives, as in Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait. Europe has also been overtaken by Australia and Canada, where 21% of the population are immigrants.</p>
<p>Lastly, the proportion of immigrants is particularly high in countries with an attractive tax system, such as Monaco (72%), Singapore (41%), or to a lesser extent Luxembourg (35%) and Switzerland (23%).</p>
<p>So where do the migrants come from? The answers here are less precise, &#8220;arrivals being more accurately registered than departures&#8221;. Mexico ranks as the top source country (10 million migrants) with many of its citizens resident in the US. India is close behind (9 million), followed by Bangladesh (6.5 million).</p>
<p>But as a percentage of total population the smaller countries rank highly for emigration. A third of the population of the Cape Verde islands live abroad. The same is true of Bosnia, with almost as many (27%) having left Albania. The UK stands out: in 2000, it had almost as many emigrants (4.2 million) as immigrants (4.9 million). In contrast, France is one of the countries with the smallest number of expatriates.</p>
<p>Finally a word of caution: the national perspective underpinning the Ined study fails to reveal the full picture regarding migration. For example, proportionally only a very few Chinese move abroad (0.1%), but huge numbers of people have migrated from one province to another in recent years.</p>

		<p>1.  Immigration of the unwanted poor to the wealthy areas of the world is not healthy, it is simply profit inducing for the corporations that don&rsquo;t mind disenfranchising the people that gave them power.</p>
<p>2.  (According to Sam Francis and Steve Sailer) NONE of the highest export nations have &#8216;pro immigrant&rsquo; policies of their own, so even if you wanted to move to a hell hole like Egypt, Saudi, China or India, you couldn&rsquo;t.  Turnabout is not happening, nor is there a change in social attitudes or population growth rates in these &#8216;donor countries&rsquo;.</p>
<p>3.  &#8216;Migration&rsquo; and &#8216;living abroad&rsquo; implies a likelihood of return by the expat in question.  It doesn&rsquo;t happen.  More importantly, if you don&rsquo;t like their looks or their SES or their &#8216;cultural beliefs&rsquo; you WON&rsquo;T breed with them which means that whatever amount of money they cut from the GDP pie for their own will _never_ come back to you.  This is particularly important because these people have breeding rates which are rapidly filling up the natural open space and thus social breathing room of our lands as well.  Which translates to us losing productivity (the jobs these people qualify for in a &#8216;service economy&rsquo; are just shy of scut labor) and being replaced by those who cannot sustain the same kinds of innovation.</p>
<p>i.e.  EVEN THE CAPITALISTS, who exist solely to sustain their own posh existence at the head of money making supranational corporations, will end up bending themselves over a barrel because they cannot continue to sustain their edge in technology and supply as the population grows and resources shrink.</p>
<p>And when America in particular collapses, around 2025, these self same &#8216;migrants&rsquo; will revert to primitivism mighty fast and very viciously.</p>

		<p>If anyone want to know the countries immigrants to the US are coming from, here is a PDF file with the data: <a href="/uploadedFiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/Reports/Hispanics_in_America/PHC_foreignborn_1006.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.pewtrusts.org/uploadedFiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/Reports/Hispanics_in_America/PHC_foreignborn_1006.pdf</a></p>
<p>The information is on page 3 and 4.</p>

		<p>When ever related statistics are given with their calculations expressed differently, a red light should go off in the reader&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>Why are immigrants displayed as raw total numbers (in millions) and emigrants shown as percentages?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d imagine that&rsquo;s the optimal way to soften the blow; This representation is saying, &#8220;See, it&rsquo;s just a tiny portion of the sending countries&rsquo; people that are here, which translates into just a few million among us.&#8221; </p>
<p>There might be quite a different reaction to this reality shown here if one could see the millions that are sent and the significant percentages of foreign-born inhabiting those host societies.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s nice to see that Italy is seeing most of its &#8216;migrants&rsquo; leave. This is undoubtedly due to the new policies that crack down on immigration and encourage locals to form patrol groups.</p>
<p>God bless the Lega Nord.</p>

//<br>
I disagree.<br>
America will not collapse, it will simply become a 2nd rate country, kinda like Brazil.<br>
However even in 2nd rate countries there are &#8220;pockets of prosperity&#8221;&hellip;Folks you&rsquo;ll know where to find me.<br>
*grin*<br>
If you are smart you will plan ahead RIGHT NOW (save your $$$) so you can pay the required admission fee to enter one of these white enclaves in the future.</p>

		<p>Immigration is neither needed nor wanted by First World Nations. All immigration means is that while White people have access to cheap labor, our taxes support these parasites ad infitum. As well as supporting their numerous progeny since the invading immigrants will stupidly try to &#8220;outbreed&#8221; the local population to gain political power.</p>

		<p>Sorry to be negative but just ponder this for a second.  Has anybody thought about; NOT using the Hispanic landscapers, about NOT using the illegal housecleaners?  Shall I go on?  These people are going to your country, and mine to a lesser extent because WE can&rsquo;t get off our asses and do a lot of these tasks ourselves.  In MY opinion WE are enabling OUR own demise.    </p>

<p>Arthur Kemp remarked (during the faux-Apartheid era) that a white South African was someone who would rather be murdered in his bed than make it. Apparently, the same statement would apply to many white Americans.</p>
