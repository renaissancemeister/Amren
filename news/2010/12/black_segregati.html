			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WTOP-FM (Washington, D.C.), December 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>America&rsquo;s neighborhoods became more integrated last year than during any time in at least a century as a rising black middle class moved into fast-growing white areas in the South and West.</p>
<p>Still, ethnic segregation in many parts of the U.S. persisted, particularly for Hispanics.</p>
<p>Segregation among blacks and whites fell in roughly three-quarters of the nation&rsquo;s 100 largest metropolitan areas as the two racial groups spread more evenly between inner cities and suburbs, according to recent census data.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Milwaukee, Detroit and Syracuse, N.Y., were among the most segregated, all part of areas in the Northeast and Midwest known by some demographers as the &#8220;ghetto belt.&#8221; On the other end of the scale, cities that were least likely to be segregated included Fort Myers, Fla., Honolulu, Atlanta and Miami.</p>
<p>Hispanic integration was mixed. There was less Hispanic-white segregation in cities and suburbs in many large metros such as Buffalo, Washington, D.C., and Chicago, according to preliminary census figures. But in many smaller neighborhoods, large numbers of more recently arrived Hispanic immigrants are believed to be clustering together for social support, experts said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Asians were most segregated in large metros such as Greensboro, N.C., and Stockton, Calif. They were most integrated in Phoenix, Washington, D.C., and Las Vegas, due partly to the movement of more affluent Asians to suburbs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>* Other large metros showing less segregation included those with technology-based economies, such as Boston, Seattle, Houston, Austin, Tex., and San Francisco, which attracted middle- and upper-income blacks to their suburbs.</p>
<p>Still, the recent gains in racial integration are somewhat limited, said John Logan, a sociologist at Brown University who has studied residential segregation. He noted that black-white segregation remained generally high in areas of the Northeast and Midwest. In those areas, there is slow population growth and white flight from increasingly minority neighborhoods is still common.</p>

		<p>I live near Washington, DC, which, in terms of blacks vs. whites, is extremely segregated.  All of Southeast DC is literally 98+% black (and thus, a no-go zone).  There are efforts to &#8220;revitalize&#8221; part of the Southeast riverfront, in an attempt to make it an attractive nightspot.  Unfortunately, absent a heavy demographic shift, I don&rsquo;t see the project turning out too well.</p>
<p>There are also neighborhoods in Northeast DC that are 100% Black.  If you take a look at the DC crime maps on websites like spotcrime.com, and narrow it down to shootings or homicides, it is absolutely stunning how they are all located in the Eastern portion of the city, while the Northwestern section is almost completely violence-free.</p>

		<p>In upscale neighborhoods things like loud music or trashy lawns would not be tolerated so any blacks or Hispanics who managed to buy in those neighborhoods would quickly learn to keep in line. in more middle or working class areas the ghetto can quickly creep in before anyone realizes it and often too late to sell and get out. As soon as minorities move in the neighborhood starts to accumulate dead cars, unmoved lawns, loud music and obnoxious parties. No matter how hard you try to stop &#8220;ghetto creep&#8221; you can&rsquo;t fight it. In my hometown there is a deteriorating neighborhood of crumbling bungalows that had once been rather upscale but once the blacks moved in the crime and urban decay followed.</p>

		<p>This article is an effort to conceal reality.  It says segregation drop for whites and blacks.  Actully, it is more acccurate to say white areas were invaded by blacks fleeing the chaos and crime of their own areas.</p>
<p>Hispanic and Asians remain more segregated because they don&rsquo;t pander to blacks the way whites do.  So when blacks look to flee thier own messed up neighborhoods they of course seek out white neighborhoods.  </p>
<p>This will continue to happen.  As Hispanics move blacks out of LA and California, those blacks will move into white neighborhoods.</p>

		<p>The only one of the &#8220;least likely to be segregated&#8221; cities that I am familiar with is Atlanta. Believe me when I tell you that their numbers on Atlanta are skewed. The predominately White northern half of Fulton county was Milton County until the Great Depression, and now the Whites who live there are trying to sever themselves from the predominately Black southern half of Fulton county by re-founding Milton County. They are tired of paying for schools and services for the Blacks who contribute very little to the county coffers.</p>
<p>That being the case, I wonder if the numbers on the other Rainbow Cities are also skewed. White flight has always been the popular choice for Whites who find themselves being invaded by foreign or domestic third-worlders and I cannot imagine a scenario in which it would go out of style.</p>

		<p>In one sense, this is true, but it&rsquo;s LEGISLATED integration, or a form of stealth integration.  Many liberal States (including Wisconsin unfortunately) have legislated a mandate that ANY and EVERY developer of homes for SALE in new developments MUST include section 8 rental properties somewhere in the same development.  Meaning, wherever a farmer sells his acreage, and a developer buys it to develop with homes built for sale, that developer must also include a given number of low income rental units as part of the plan, else he does NOT get his permits.  I absolutely HATE this approach and kind of mandate.  It&rsquo;s like building a new community of victims, complete with the predators and criminals close by for convenience.  ALWAYS the only problems in our neighborhoods of otherwise nice single family homes are the renters imposed on the neighborhoods by this satanic legislation.  Moreover, there is constant turnover as the renters are arrested, enough complaints lodged for noise ordinances, or they simply flee prosecution and/or rents in arrears.  Many states and communities have adopted this abomination.  It&rsquo;s specific purpose is to DENY Whites the ability to flee from black crime, and to foil &#8220;white flight&#8221;.  </p>

		<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t move as much as they are moved.  Both federal and state governments move blacks into white areas through HUD and Section 8 vouchers.  That&rsquo;s what happened to my neighborhood.  </p>

		<p>Very recently I have seen signs of strange things beginning  &mdash;  Whites and Blacks sometimes joining TOGETHER to fight the illegal Mestizo invaders. Many Black Americans feel strongly (and correctly) that they are being  pushed aside by the hordes of Spanish speaking people who will stick together, and will work for less than the blacks can afford to, and will suck the social services systems dry  &mdash;  systems the Blacks are used to depending upon. This may be an avenue to encourage. We may not care for the reasons WHY they will join us to remove the Mestizoes, just welcome the help. We can worry about the Blacks when the Mestizoes are out of here. One problem at a time!  </p>

<p>Who are the idiots that write such nonsense? These neighborhoods aren&rsquo;t more integrated, they&rsquo;re in transition. The Blacks move in, the Whites flee for their lives. These &#8220;integrated&#8221; neighborhoods just haven&rsquo;t reached the tipping point yet.  </p>

		<p>When other races huddle together it&rsquo;s for &#8216;social support&rsquo; and something for them to all celebrate. Their behavior is considered enlightened behavior thru and thru. When whites are together it&rsquo;s a sign of how bad they are and this must be changed no matter how belligerent we must get in order to change it. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m surprised no one has said the obvious.</p>
<p>This is, in no way, an accident.  We just had a major market collapse triggered by bad loans given to minorities they don&rsquo;t intend to pay back (and now being refused to be foreclosed upon).</p>
<p>These loans are an intentional scheme to ethnically cleanse white neighborhoods.  Move blacks in with loans they should not be able to get.  Then buy up the property cheap as whites attempt to leave the new high crime area.</p>

		<p>I read the oringinal article in the Atlantic City Press this morning. The very first line was:<br>
 &#8220;America&rsquo;s neighborhoods took large strides toward racial integration in the past decade as blacks and whites chose to live near each other at the highest levels in a century&#8221;</p>
<p>This paragraph doesn&rsquo;t appear in the &#8220;original article&#8221; on this site.<br>
 &#8220;Chose&#8221;? Ask 100 White people whose neighborhood has &#8220;integrated&#8221; and I&rsquo;d wager that very few feel that they had a &#8220;choice&#8221;. Even the most misguided liberals would be hard pressed to indicate any verifiable improvements in said neighborhood due to the addition of blacks.<br>
I&rsquo;s also like to see the social engineers give some statistics on how many whites move into existing Black neighborhoods, Bill Clinton being the rare exception with his full time SS (Not the Schutzstaffel but rather the Secret Service)protection. </p>

		<p>Once again the media hides the truth from American citizens.  It is true that segregation has dropped because of Blacks moving into White neighborhoods, but this is NOT because of rampant growth in the number of Blacks in the middle class rungs of the socioeconomic ladder.  It has happened because our nation&rsquo;s endless legions of Leftist social engineers have deliberately PUT Blacks into YOUR neighborhoods with a variety of programs using YOUR money.</p>
<p>This is particularly evident in the larger cities which have been dismantling their inner city housing projects due to the ugly fact that they have been dismal, catastrophic failures.  The Blacks who lived in those projects have been redistributed to the suburbs, sprinkled into upscale apartment complexes and into individual homes.  As a result, many suburban school districts have seen their demographics change with incredible speed as bewildered White parents wonder how their neighborhood school, ranked in the top of the charts only a few years ago, is suddenly an under-performing den of thuggery, drugs, and failure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s being done quite deliberately.  The cancer of failure from our inner cities has been quietly metastasized to your neighborhoods, and now you will get to enjoy all of the fine urban experiences you have seen only on TV before.</p>
<p>But cheer up - on a positive note, the liberal suburban teachers absolutely adore the chance to make a progressive statement in their classrooms, and they will ceaselessly promote the new students as the absolute models of masculinity and &#8220;coolness&#8221;.  Your children will be ceaselessly exhorted to mix and you will see standards fall with a speed that will flat out amaze you.</p>
<p>Sound unlikely?  Do a few minutes of research on the redistribution of housing project residents, and prepare to be amazed.</p>
<p>Never forget - none of this is happening by accident.  Your &#8220;leaders&#8221; have decided that what is best for you, is for your race to disappear.  Don&rsquo;t support their efforts - starve the beast.  Minimize debt, minimize tax payments, direct your charity to your own people, and do everything you can to quit making the destruction of your own people and culture a profitable enterprise.</p>

		<p>The really disgusting thing about all of this is that it has been wrought upon us by other white people.  It&rsquo;s time to expose them and their agenda for the absolute racism it represents in the form of abused power and genuinely racist legislation that has clearly been designed to put white people at an absolute disadvantage in an effort to &#8220;level&#8221; the field for everyone.  <br>
 <br>
Is that how anyone remembers America working?  I seem to recall a time when it was YOU who had the responsibility for raising yourself to the level you wanted to be.  This psychotic Robin Hood strategy is causing far more pain that it can alleviate.<br>
 <br>
It&rsquo;s time for common sense to come back into American policy.  Equality is equality, not pre-programmed advantages measured against hoped-for results that have never come to be.  <br>

		<p>Old White Jim #4, you&rsquo;re right about Atlanta. Apparently you, too, are in the area. Even though it is one of the &#8216;least segregated&rsquo; cities, I take that to mean that groups of blacks and groups of whites sometimes simply inhabit the same areas at at the same times. But blacks still stick with blacks and whites with whites for the overwhelming majority. Though both groups may share, for example, the same physician, blacks all sit together in the waiting area, and whites do the same. In cafeterias blacks will always group together. In restaurants you will often have groups of black tables together, indicating that either the hostess is aware that races are more comfortable together or that white patrons requested another table when led to a predominantly black section.</p>
<p>No matter where you go, even in Atlanta, whether it be a sporting event, shopping, or anywhere people congregate, they still  choose to be closer to their own kind and only integrating because they have to.</p>

		<p>I have also seen areas that were considered &#8220;blighted&#8221; restored to former glory after the section 8 and HUD renters fled the area due to being offered rentals in better neighborhoods. Mostly yuppies needing to be close to downtown areas for work they restore the crumbling homes and when (or if) they have children they want the local public schools to be decent. Meanwhile the urban decay spreads to the suburbs. I read an article (it might have been on Amren) where a brand new low income apartment complex had been built and carefully selected tenants were allowed to move in. At first they were awed by the fresh paint, carpet and fixtures but after a while the old problems began to surface. Even though they were carefully selected many of the tenants had children whose friends came to visit and brought the old vices of drugs and crime with them. Not long after that tenants began to destroy apartments or just allowed them to fall into disrepair and the neighbors outside the complex began to complain that the low income crime was spilling into their well kept streets. It didnt mention whether or not the schools were suffering but I am sure the test scores took hits with the influx of blacks from the complex. This tells me that the movement of low income ghetto type minorities is completely controlled by local, state and federal governments.</p>

		<p>My last two trips back to visit the folks in my 100% white small town revealed some disturbing things.  </p>
<p>On the first of those trips, two years ago, there were ghetto thugs walking down main street.  I was SO SHOCKED.  I see them everyday in the big city I&rsquo;m in now (for work reasons) - but in my good &#8216;ol &#8216;Mayberryesque&rsquo; town.  Oh God no!</p>
<p>The second of those trips, last year, saw black men walking down the dirt roads that I used to call home, and white girls hanging (three on one) on the arms of a real dumb looking black teenage boy.  </p>
<p>White America is finished.  Death by a thousand cuts.  Our descendants will live in a Brazil-like nation.  Welcome to the new dark ages.</p>

		<p>One other thing that WTOP missed&hellip;Asians.  Before I start, WTOP is owned by the Washington Post so one can clearly see it&rsquo;s a lefty station.  Out here in Centreville, VA about 18 miles west of the beltway, we are being overrun by Koreans.  The vehicle accident rate has skyrocketed and every single strip shop area has a Tai Kwon Do business along with a Korean restaurant that serves Sushi (which really pisses off the Japanese).  One would think that all is calm here but every couble of months, a townhouse is raided for gambling, selling untaxed cigs or questionable massage practices.  Also this same townhouse element produced the Virginia Tech shooter.  Whites are leaving the area as the median signs are all in Korean, the giant 5000 seat church just opened and they literally flood the place.  I guess the only place left is west in Middleburg.  Went to a nice restaurant there for Thanksgiving and it was pure Heaven.  All White patrons and staff.  No Koreans hacking up lung butter because they smoke 4 packs a day and no Korean wives/girls that dress like the Seoul hookers and bathe in Charlie perfume.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve lived (and live) in an area considered to be &ldquo;integrated&rdquo; and I&rsquo;ll tell you how it is. The black families are a complete nuisance, constantly fighting, playing obnoxious music, and attacking the white residents. The more modest Euro-Americans build fences and fear even leaving their homes let alone letting their children play in their own yards. The Euro-American families try to maintain their properties, keep the sidewalks clean, plant fruit trees and gardens, and the black families turn around and destroy everything. It isn&rsquo;t integration, it is an invasion! Mexicans just know they&rsquo;d rather live with each other than blacks anyday. We whites also feel that way, but unless you have the money, you are stuck with them, clinging to the only other white neighbors and trying to find a way to maintain civilization within your circle. </p>
<p>Want to put a nice Greek statuette in your garden? Smashed. Want to plant flowers along your fence? Pulled and destroyed. Want to plant a plum tree? Plucked and destroyed. Want to have a nice car? Destroyed, stolen, etc. <br>

<p>I live in such a place.  There are two whole suburbs where I&rsquo;m at that are 90% korean/chinese and you can drive for 60 blocks in any direction and not only see no white faces, but every sign is in korean.  </p>
<p>(They are expanding their cultural zone out in every direction and push both blacks and latinos out as they go.  They seem to actually like us white people, probably as an oddity - harmless relics.)  </p>
<p>Most of the businesses don&rsquo;t even bother putting any english translation anymore.  </p>
<p>On my block, there are only two white families out of some 50 homes, and the other white family is an elderly couple from Ireland.  The koreans are nice enough, to be sure, but gosh&rsquo; darn it, I&rsquo;m the only American left here!  And they do drive HORRIBLY!  I could tell stories&hellip;</p>

<p>Black people typically despise white culture and they hate it when we live within our own culture, but when foreigners (especially darker foreigners) embrace it, it makes them livid. You should see the way they torment blacks that &ldquo;act white&rdquo;.  European civilization is amazing, beautiful, and like other advanced civilizations, capable. All of these things many blacks feel (and often can&rsquo;t) achieve, thus, they hate it. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Act black&rdquo;= be a thug, rape white women, steal things, play obnoxious music, don&rsquo;t bathe, eliminate any trace of gentility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Act White&rdquo;= Be a civilized human being capable of being a part of an advanced culture and reap the benefits through out life, not only for yourself, but your descendants.</p>
