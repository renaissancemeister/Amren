<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Of all the unfamiliar products in a Chinese supermarket, one of the most shocking to American visitors is a toothpaste featuring the logo of a minstrel singer in a top hat, flashing a white smile. Even more shocking: the paste, known as Darlie in English and as Black People Toothpaste in Chinese, is a product of the Hawley &amp; Hazel Group, a Hong Kong  &mdash;  based company established in 1933, which is now owned in part by the Colgate-Palmolive Co.</p>
<p>Darlie used to be called Darkie. {snip}</p>
<p>After Colgate purchased 50 percent of the firm in 1985, religious groups, African-Americans, and company shareholders protested the racially offensive nature of the brand. After more than three years of criticism, Colgate switched the name from Darkie to Darlie and modified the logo to a less crude version of a black man. {snip}</p>
<p>Yet the Chinese name of the product has remained unchanged. And China is not exactly a paradise of racial harmony. While the crucial dichotomy in China is between Chinese and non-Chinese, many blacks face discrimination in the country. A Ghanaian who lives in China and asked to remain anonymous told NEWSWEEK that a prospective employer told him, &#8220;We can&rsquo;t hire you because you&rsquo;re black.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, the Chinese don&rsquo;t view the toothpaste&rsquo;s name as something reprehensible. &#8220;To most people in China it wouldn&rsquo;t even occur to them that Black People Toothpaste is offensive,&#8221; says P. T. Black, who researches Chinese consumers. According to the Chinese news site Southcn.com, Hawley &amp; Hazel has even trademarked the name and image and recently sued two companies in Shenzhen for making toothpaste using a similar logo with the words &#8220;Black People.&#8221; The court ordered the defendants to pay more than $300,000 in damages.</p>
<p>Yet Colgate is a Western company and, as such, &#8220;should know better,&#8221; says Kwame Dougan, an African-Canadian living in China. Colgate declined NEWSWEEK&rsquo;s interview requests, instead releasing a statement saying, &#8220;There are different perspectives on this issue.&#8221; {snip} Colgate&rsquo;s Web site has only two mentions of Darlie, both of which talk about how the brand is driving growth in the Asia-Pacific region. {snip}</p>

		<p>Oh, come ON! The Chinese product name, &#8220;hei ren,&#8221; simply means &#8220;black person&#8221; in Chinese (pronounced &#8220;kokujin&#8221; in Japanese and &#8220;heuk&rsquo;in&#8221; in Korean) - it&rsquo;s the commonly accepted term for &#8220;black person&#8221; in the East Asian Chinese cultural sphere and is not considered derogatory, the way &#8220;darkie&#8221; now is in English (as opposed to 1933).  Unless it&rsquo;s per se &#8220;demeaning&#8221; to feature black people as part of a logo (such as &#8220;Aunt Jemima&#8221; and &#8220;Uncle Ben&#8221;), I don&rsquo;t see what this fuss is about (except of course as a probable racial &#8220;shakedown&#8221;&hellip;).</p>

		<p>The Chinese, and most asians for that matter, are not obsessed with patronizing race lies and usually call things as they see them.  Many asians believe it is self evident that the black race is pitiful at best and to be avoided at least.  How Americans became indoctrinated to the degree that many are, will fill plenty of books in the future when it&rsquo;s time to write about one more lost civilization that committed suicide.  </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the thing about blacks.  To them non blacks are racist, even when they&rsquo;re not.  How can anyone win with these people?</p>
<p><i>And China is not exactly a paradise of racial harmony.</i></p>
<p>China, at least racially, is very harmonious.  That is because it&rsquo;s almost all Han Chinese.  And the fact that a Ghanaian would go to China, and then complain that he can&rsquo;t get a decent job is risible. I wonder what made him leave Ghana?  Obviously he was escaping the legacy of colonialization that continues to keep black Africa down.  </p>

		<p>When Colgate bought the brand the whole thing became part of &#8220;The White Man&rsquo;s Burden.&#8221; If the thing was exclusively a Chinese matter, we would never be hearing about it. </p>
<p>Other races do not share the exquisitely delicate sensitivities about blacks that whites have. In Mexico, a popular cartoon depicts a black boy as a simian-looking character far cruder than any white depiction of blacks ever was, and that character is honored on a set of Mexican postage stamps. </p>
<p>Now that a white-owned company has bought out the Chinese brand, it has become yet another example of wicked white racism. </p>

		<p>In Germany you can go into a bakery and ask for a &#8216;negger- kuss&rsquo;. Translated: something-kiss. It&rsquo;s a chocolate treat. Personally, I&rsquo;ve ordered and ate one. It&rsquo;s not my favorite. Germans love their bakeries though. </p>

		<p> Must have been a slow news week at Newsweek, if they were able to find time to write an opinion piece that takes itself oh, so seriously, about such a nothing subject as the brand name of a toothpaste in China.</p>
<p> So there is a toothpaste that could conceivably be considered &#8220;offensive&#8221; to blacks (the writer just assumes that everyone agrees it&rsquo;s offensive) that is sold in China, and not the U.S. Does anyone think that there&rsquo;s more than three or four of China&rsquo;s 1.3 billion people who give a tinker&rsquo;s damn?</p>
<p> Once again, the blacks and their White liberal allies assume that the entire world revolves around them and their exquisitely tender sensibilities, their carefully nursed and petted grievances. Wake up, folks, and smell the (black) coffee!</p>

		<p>So, I take it that it is called Darkie (or black person) toothpaste, because the teeth of black people look whiter and stronger by virtue of the contrast with the dark skin?  </p>
<p>In any case, now that Colgate was so idiotic to buy the brand, they can expect a class action suit from some aggrieved black activist group.  It&rsquo;s only a matter of time now.  </p>

		<p>  When the company was 100% owned by asian, there was no complaint to anything as the owners would laugh at them.<br>
 As ownership is also western now, all this does is put the race hustlers in reach of the western legal system to anyone with western citizenship that can access being, &#8220;hurt by the hate you sell&#8221;.<br>

		<p>If the Ghanian immigrant and the African-Canadian living in China have a problem with the portrayals of Bantus in China; then why in the samhill don&rsquo;t they complain to the Chinese Commission on Human Rights? </p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t blame the Chinese people for feeling the way they do about this toothpaste. Why should they have a problem with it? The only ones having a problem with it are Bantu immigrants living in China. </p>
<p>Different races can look at the same thing, and come away with different perspectives. For instance, African Bantus consider the zebra to be a black animal with white stripes, while Caucasians consider the zebra to be a white animal having black stripes.</p>
<p>During the late 1950&rsquo;s at Louisiana State, Paul Dietzel the head football coach there, called his team&rsquo;s defensive unit, the &#8220;Chinese Bandits&#8221;. I don&rsquo;t think Mao Tse-tung or Chou En Lai ever screamed or went apoplectic over it. </p>

		<p>Anonymous 1: That&rsquo;s right. The Chinese just reads &#8220;black person toothpaste&#8221;. I doubt that many or Darlie&rsquo;s (formerly Darkie&rsquo;s) customers even know what the English means.<br>
The debate centres on the caricatures used in the toothpaste before it was changed.<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Darkie_Toothpaste.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Darkie_Toothpaste.jpg</a></p>
<p>The company used a black person as the basis for the brand was because of the perception in China that black people tend to have very white shiny teeth. When I was in Guangzhou, I heard a Chinese man commenting on an African diplomat on television, saying that he was smiling so widely that his face was more white than black. I think he should&rsquo;ve phrased his words in a less offensive manner, and I still think China has a long way to go before racial relations are &#8220;harmonious&#8221;. There should be more education in Chinese schools about these issues, so that China can become less of a &#8220;racist&#8221; (I know those on this site think its overused, but I think its justified in this case) country.</p>
<p>4- Tom Iron<br>
I don&rsquo;t deny that China&rsquo;s racist, but I think you&rsquo;re over-generalising. I know plenty of Chinese who welcome others&rsquo; views and feelings, and the non-Chinese being a non-person idea borders on ridiculous. The Japanese and Koreans I&rsquo;ve met don&rsquo;t share this view. Indeed, the Chinese who went through school during the early 80s have an almost devout admiration of Japan&rsquo;s economic success. That said, the Chinese do tend to be wary of foreigners (bordering on racism), but they don&rsquo;t look down on them. If you learn the language enough (Cantonese in my case), you&rsquo;ll find that they&rsquo;ll admit to this fact quite readily. In fact, the reason why I admire the Chinese over their Korean and Japanese cousins is their almost brutal bluntness. The shopkeepers in Japan are overly courteous, those in Korea maintain a dignified silence, but the ones in China, will haggle, argue and even shout at customers. This kind of behaviour extends to all parts of life in China.<br>
I don&rsquo;t know why, but these vulgar habits give the Chinese an air of naturalness (I can&rsquo;t think of a better word) that the Koreans and Japanese don&rsquo;t have.<br>
Looks like I&rsquo;ve gone on another long rant. Well just to be quick, I think china is a racist country and the people there are racist not out of hatred, but ignorance and must be educated so they can become more accepting of others. However, I don&rsquo;t wish the average Chinese city to lose its slightly chaotic but enjoyable air.<br>
If you wish to gain an ACCURATE insight into the mind of the avergae Chinese I suggest you go to<br>
<a href="http://www.chinasmack.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.chinasmack.com/</a><br>
The site translates articles and all comments on Chinese websites for articles about major news stories. Of interest to people at amren may be the case of Lou Jing, the half black, half Chinese woman who made headliens around the world. The comments there range from hatred, to ultra-liberal. I hope you enjoy reading.</p>

<p>This tangy treat is produced by Algida, (&#8220;Good Humor&#8221; in the U.S.), a division of Unilever.  Where&rsquo;s the outcry?  Oh yeah, the caricature is of an Asian; it&rsquo;s okay to poke fun at them.</p>

<p>If anything, it is the style that provides the appeal. It raises the image of Africans by association with white Western customs and grooming.  An image of an African in native dress would not sell hygienic products.<br>

<p>Why MUST the Chinese be educated about black people and stop their &#8216;racism&rsquo;? Why do they need to accept blacks, Muslims, Pakistanis etc.? China is already overcrowded so you can&rsquo;t possibly argue for non-Chinese immigration. China doesn&rsquo;t NEED mixed hybrids or crime or racial strife.

<p>That&rsquo;s interesting because I would say archeology and history stand for deceitful emotion. Whenever &#8216;history&rsquo; is studied in the West it would be more accurate if the word &#8216;emotion&rsquo; were substituted in it&rsquo;s place. At least something good will come about along with the end of whites. <br>

		<p>End of Illusion in post #15 states the chinese &#8220;must be educated so they can become more accepting of others&#8221;</p>
<p>No, they don&rsquo;t. They are a smart people to reject all this multi-culti nonsense. And who must educate them to this &#8220;vibrant&#8221; new mindset, hmm? Now, here is one for the multi-culti bunch. </p>
<p>Oh&hellip;.wait&hellip;.if a powerful China is what we fear, Here is a great idea..export multi-culturalism to their shores. Then China will destroy itself,and BINGO no more threat from a newly empowered China. Maybe teaching the Chinese to be more accepting of others isn&rsquo;t such a bad idea after all!</p>

		<p>@ 21- History is important if we are not to repeat the mistakes of the past. Emotion is what makes us human and distinguishes us from automatons and the like. Without emotion we would not be able to enjoy our successes and regret our failures, we will not grow, and will not be filled with the desire to improve ourselves. Thus both History AND emotion is vital to our ongoing existence.</p>
<p>@19-Lauren- &#8220;the Asians, with their relentlessly objective mindset, will have little use for either the future or the past.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then you obviously haven&rsquo;t come across the &#8220;Twenty-Four Histories&#8221; composed by Chinese historians over the span of 2300 years. Toegether, they are roughly the length of the Encyclopaedia Brittanica. Add to that the works of countless historians not patronised by the Chinese Emperor and you have a mass of information that matches or maybe even exceeds the records available in Europe. In Zhaoqing I was amazed to find that the palace of the Governor during the imperial era still contained an enormous collection of memos and essays dating back to the 10th century, which even the Chinese haven&rsquo;t go to cataloguing in detail yet. The Chinese have an immense respect for the past, and those who attempt to claim otherwise only have to set foot into a Chinese historical repository (found in most cities with a population greater than 100,000) to see it in action.</p>
<p>And to Posters 20 and 23:<br>
China needs tolerance of others, not necessarily immigration from other countries (though I&rsquo;m not opposed to the notion of that either). If the Chinese remain closed to others, they&rsquo;ll repeat the mistakes of the Ming Dynasty; by closing themselves off during the 15th century, the Chinese lived an illusion that lasted until the 1800s. I don&rsquo;t think the average Chinese wants to go down the path of stagnation once again.</p>

		<p>to #24: It would be perfectly fine with me, and I am sure many others, if China decided to isolate itself once more. I doubt that will happen, however. </p>
<p>The Chinese I have met and known have been quite race conscious, and very biased against non-Chinese, and very jealous and hateful towards whites. So, why the double standard? Why are Chinese allowed to go unquestioned in such behavior? Why are they in the USA at all?</p>
<p>And let China take in the Asian immigrants to THEIR shores. That is the economy that is booming, not the USA&rsquo;s, so why should we take in immigrants (legal or not) from Laos, India, Cambodia, Viet Nam, and God only knows from where else, only to take jobs and school seats away from whites. Let them go to another Asian country.That would be closer to their own culture. The USA is a nation, NOT an economic choice.  </p>

		<p>   As I recall. the old label from the thirties for this product had a much more sterotyped depiction of the &#8220;Darkie&#8221;.

Today&rsquo;s toothpaste ad is no more racist than &ldquo;Aunt Jemima&rdquo; or &ldquo;Uncle Ben&rdquo;.</p>
