<h1><a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Many-Biracial-Students-Game/125715/#top">Many Biracial Students Game Racial-Classification Systems, Study Suggests</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Schmidt, Chronicle of Higher Education, December 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A study of biracial people with black and white ancestry has found that many identify themselves solely as black when filling out college applications and financial-aid forms, raising new questions about the accuracy of educational statistics and research based on racial and ethnic data derived from students.</p>
<p>The study of 40 biracial people  &mdash;  all of whom reported having one black parent and one white one  &mdash;  found that 29, or nearly three-fourths, reported concealing their white ancestry in applying for college, scholarships, financial aid, or jobs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In their article describing their methodology and results, the researchers behind the study stress that the biracial people who claimed only black ancestry on forms were simply appropriating  &mdash;  and employing to their advantage  &mdash;  a way of thinking about race that had been used throughout much of American history to oppress and disadvantage people like them. Under the &#8220;one-drop rule&#8221; rooted in slavery and the Jim Crow era, multiracial people with any black ancestry generally were treated simply as being black. Even now, the researchers found, many of the participants in the study felt much more accepted among black people than among whites.</p>
<p>Moreover, people from other segments of society have similarly been known to try to gain an advantage by manipulating how they are racially or ethnically classified. For example, colleges have long struggled with how to deal with white students who latch onto or falsely claim some small, far-removed portion of American Indian ancestry to gain an edge in applying for admission or financial aid. And a study on enrollments at three private California colleges, published in 2005, found evidence that white students were disproportionately more likely to fail to specify a race on college applications, thus probably inflating the declared minority enrollments of institutions that assume such students are multiracial.</p>
<p>Precision and Prejudice</p>
<p>The new study nonetheless represents bad news for those hoping that educational research on minority students would become more nuanced  &mdash;  and would better reflect the diversity of American society  &mdash;  in the wake of developments such as a 2000 revision of the U.S. census allowing people to check more than one box when asked their race.</p>
<p>{snip} What is at stake in such debates {snip} [is] that how researchers classify biracial and multiracial students &#8220;can have profound implications&#8221; for their analyses.</p>
<p>The new study suggests that many researchers start out with bad data that conflate information on students with two black parents with information on students with one white parent and one black one, even though those biracial students are less likely, on average, to have grown up with the same disadvantages.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The article describes most of the research subjects as offering fairly precise descriptions of their racial backgrounds in their discussions with Ms. Khanna. In that context, just six of the 40 identified themselves as black, and 33 used some multiracial descriptor such as &#8220;biracial,&#8221; &#8220;multiracial,&#8221; or &#8220;mixed race.&#8221;</p>
<p>How the respondents reported characterizing themselves elsewhere depended on the context, however, with 29 reporting that they &#8220;strategically&#8221; identified themselves only as black when they thought they would benefit from doing so. One respondent, whose name is given only as Natasha, told the researchers, &#8220;I know that if I say I&rsquo;m &#8216;biracial,&rsquo; I will get certain things, and if I say I&rsquo;m &#8216;black,&rsquo; I will get certain things.&#8221; Another respondent, Julie, said, &#8220;If I&rsquo;m trying to get more money from the government, I am &#8216;African American.&rsquo; There is no white aspect to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>In defining themselves as black, the study respondents &#8220;are not necessarily challenging contemporary social norms which arguably define them as black anyway,&#8221; the article says. Nonetheless, it says, the study&rsquo;s findings &#8220;raise broader questions about who should benefit from affirmative-action programs,&#8221; and whether beneficiaries should be required to have two black parents or whether the &#8220;one-drop rule&#8221; should be applied to people with biracial or multiracial backgrounds.</p>

		<p>Frankly, I have a hard time finding fault with them. After all, they&rsquo;re simply exploiting the system. If it weren&rsquo;t for these ridiculous race-based privileges and handouts, this wouldn&rsquo;t be happening.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it with my own eyes.  Had a coworker that could&rsquo;ve passed for white anywhere, he had a white daddy, a light-skinned &#8220;black&#8221; mom that was 1/4, maybe 1/2 black at most.</p>
<p>Claimed the &#8220;black&#8221; box on everything!  Used to brag about how beneficial it was to him in life.  <br/>
White skin, black goodies  &mdash;  -that&rsquo;s a jackpot combination.</p>

In defining themselves as black, the study respondents &ldquo;are not necessarily challenging contemporary social norms which arguably define them as black anyway,&rdquo; the article says. Nonetheless, it says, the study&rsquo;s findings &ldquo;raise broader questions about who should benefit from affirmative-action programs,&rdquo; and whether beneficiaries should be required to have two black parents or whether the &ldquo;one-drop rule&rdquo; should be applied to people with biracial or multiracial backgrounds.<br/>

<p>No, what it raises is the obvious hypocrisy of racial rather than merit driven scholarships.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s going to be by race, then white indigenes, with 64-69% of the population, should be given the maximum benefit, outranking the 25% Jewish and 23% Asian groups that now gain the largest &#8216;merit based&rsquo; admission.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s going to be by merit, then blacks should not complain when their mean 87 IQ denies them all but a tiny fraction (2.5%, 800,000) of the 115 IQ necessary to succeed in the collegiate environment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like they don&rsquo;t get HUGE entitlements elsewhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not for nothing that (IQs normalized to include verbal/conceptual skills) whites have created most of the worlds historical technology innovations, law, art and philosophy.</p>
<p>Does ANYONE want to screw that up for the purposes of proving (again) that Lysenkoist &#8216;water the plant more and it will match the rest!&rsquo; claptrap isn&rsquo;t true?</p>
<p>In Africa, every off-the-street U.S. black would have at least 1MSD -advantage- over the locals.  They could run the place better than the natives and _fit in_ like the natives because they would /stupendously/ rich off what the Chinese gave them to rape the land&rsquo;s resources.</p>
<p>Here, they insist on &#8216;rights&rsquo; which are not earned and screw up everything for the one people whose continued progress in the sciences of the 21st Century: Genetics and Robotics, could make the rest of the world gradually come up to our standards.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not fair for 13% of the population to be given such unfair accomodations for their innate genetic failures.</p>

		<p>These people aren&rsquo;t cheating anyone. No one is part white. Anyone who has the least bit of understanding of Mendelian genetics knows this. This is why Obama is the first *black* President. He&rsquo;s not &#8220;part white,&#8221; he&rsquo;s black, just like everyone else with any black ancestry.</p>

		<p>Immigrants from India and their descendants can be far, far darker than most African Americans yet the government considers us to be &#8220;Asians&#8221; which holds us to higher standards than whites. </p>
<p>Whatever happened to &#8220;By the color of our skin?&#8221;</p>
<p>I propose that us dark skinned Indians (dot not feather) start calling ourselves Black so we can also get the same benefits of them. Since most Indians in the U.S. are intelligent and law abiding, we should have no problem actually performing when hired or admitted.</p>

I guess this ends the &#8220;White Privilege&#8221; debate. </p>
<p>If minorities know they are better off just being a minority, it is time to end affirmative action.</p>

<p>No, for the purpose of receieving small business loans, the government considers Hindus to be a minority. Thus, you are being held to a lower standard. How do you think the Patels got control of half the hotels in the U.S.?</p>

		<p>A co-worker was telling the other day about her experience at college. Her room-mate was black and from Chicago. Her father was very wealthy and owned several grocery stores. She still received financial aid just because she was black. No one at the school ever checked her background out, they just gave it to her because she was black. My co-worker (white) had to work in the cafeteria to help pay for her schooling, she comes from a middle class family. The black room-mate would brag and laugh about the aid money and throw it in everyone&rsquo;s face. </p>

		<p>Recall that recently Arab americans were saying they want to be reclassified to get affirmative action goodies because the government has always classified them as whites.</p>
<p>Granted, many Arabs do look white and have a lot of caucasian DNA (lots of contact with europeans over the centuries), but other Arabs are actually really dark and have more in common with Africa.  </p>

		<p>I agree with poster #4. People with any amount of black ancestry, no matter how slight, is very noticeable.  You can&rsquo;t identify as White if you don&rsquo;t look White or accepted as being White.  The same is pretty much true for most mixed race non-Europid groups except a few caucasoid peoples like some Arabs who might be able to approximate the look. Half oriental/half White looks oriental, half mestizo/half White looks mestizo, etc. Even a person with mostly caucasian DNA with 1/8 Chinese might lose the oriental facial features but there is still something peculiar looking about the person.    </p>

DEAD wrong.  It is not always noticeable.  I have personally known a few people in my lifetime who fit that qualification.</p>
<p>In regards to the coworker I mentioned  &mdash;  there was nothing to indicate that he was black. Nothing. Believe me, I looked hard.  I thought he was lying till I saw his parents  &mdash;  father (a blue-eyed blonde  &mdash;  mother, a very light-skinned black).</p>
<p>The other two where in my family.  There was no question of paternity, and NO indication of blackness (and no, they were not my kids).  People look for those things, you know.</p>
<p>Had a white coworker once, surprised to find that he had a Chinese grandmother.  Looked like any white guy on the street, nothing peculiar AT ALL.</p>
<p>When you find that stuff out, you tend to scrutinize so much more.</p>
<p>Those things DO happen, though I agree it is NOT commonplace.  If you live long enough (and get out often enough) you will probably encounter it at least once in your lifetime.  You may not even know it.  So that blanket assertion does not hold up.<br/>
