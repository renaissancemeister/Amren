			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News, December 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Johnson [Ethel Johnson, a 60-year-old Buffalo woman] is among 33 people charged so far in a large-scale investigation that has opened a window into an emerging class of suppliers in the illicit drug trade: medical patients, including many who rely on the publicly funded Medicaid program to pay for their appointments and prescriptions. She has pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>For the first time, the Buffalo investigators devoted the kinds of resources normally aimed at street drugs like heroin or crack  &mdash;  wiretaps, buys, surveillance and cross-agency cooperation to trace the drugs from pharmacy to street. Even they were taken aback by the burgeoning market for the kinds of pills found in medicine cabinets in typical American homes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Often at no charge, the patients see a doctor, or several doctors, and come away with prescriptions for narcotic OxyContin and other pills they then sell to a dealer for as much as $1,000. If they are on Medicaid, the program is billed about $1,060 for a typical 60-pill, 80-mg prescription, along with the $23-to-$39 cost of the doctor&rsquo;s visit.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A report last year by the Government Accountability Office estimated that 65,000 Medicaid beneficiaries in New York and four other states had visited six or more doctors in fiscal 2006 and 2007 to acquire duplicate prescriptions for controlled substances.</p>
<p>The cost to Medicaid was $63 million for the drugs alone, excluding doctors&rsquo; exams. The report examined Medicaid abuse in New York, California, Illinois, North Carolina and Texas, high-volume states in Medicaid prescription drug payments.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dealers &#8220;don&rsquo;t have to get their money together, smuggle or reach out to connections in Mexico or anything,&#8221; said Tomaszewski, who helped oversee the Buffalo crackdown before becoming the city&rsquo;s deputy police commissioner. &#8220;They were clever enough to find the sources of supply were in their own neighborhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>After buying the pills from patients, dealers resell them for an average of $1 a milligram, investigators say. With a single 80-mg OxyContin selling for $80, the 90-count bottle of pills McCall allegedly paid $1,000 or less for was worth $7,200 on the street. {snip}</p>
<p>After OxyContin was introduced in 1996, it quickly became the top prescribed painkiller in the nation, and among the most abused. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>McCall, Johnson and their co-defendants are charged with possessing and distributing oxycodone and hydrocodone, two of the most commonly prescribed and commonly abused opiate pain medications, but authorities say various sedatives and stimulants changed hands, too.</p>

		<p>What in God&rsquo;s name these political fools think they&rsquo;re accomplishing by restricting prescription drugs to people who really need them in yet another fight on drugs that is doomed to failure is beyond most of us, especially since their war on non-prescription drugs is an incompetent mess.</p>
<p>The illegal drug trade earns about 60 billion plus per year from the drugs smuggled into the US, but the authorities still refuse to properly guard the border.  The war on drugs is not only a dismal failure it is funding violent drug gangs which threaten to take over Mexico and are already branching out into the US.  Homeland security estimates that Mexican cartels have drug gangs in about 200 US cities.</p>
<p>These government fools can&rsquo;t afford another war they can&rsquo;t win.  By putting restrictions on prescription drugs that have a therapeutic value, the politicians once again are causing the honest citizen to be treated as a criminal simply for wanting to ease his/her pain.  They wind up once again as the true victims in the clumsy attempts by political hacks to try to control something, but are too dense to know how to go about it.  It&rsquo;s like making everyone go through a groping to get on a plane, because they don&rsquo;t want to profile Muslims, who are the only ones who have EVER blown up an airplane&hellip;.or tried to.</p>
<p>These prescription drugs are going to be manufactured and distributed in Mexico and smuggled into the US along with pot, heroin, cocaine and amphetamines, and the cost for them will be no more&hellip;.or maybe even less&hellip;.than the going rate right now from ones obtained by these doctor shoppers.</p>
<p>And the end result will be that most ALL the prescription drugs on the street will come from Mexico&hellip;.and other countries&hellip;. and will be available illegally, while doctors in this country will be so terrorized they&rsquo;ll be afraid to write a needed prescription.  A legitimate patient will likely have to buy from a dealer in order to ease his pain. </p>
<p>These government fools should get out of drug enforcement and legalize drugs, because they&rsquo;ll never win.  As Ron Paul says, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t advise it, but what a person puts into his body should be his own business.  The government should have nothing to do with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the economy doesn&rsquo;t bring this empire down, than illegal drugs will do the job.  Case closed!  </p>

		<p>A couple of things not mentioned in the article.</p>
<p>The money to buy those drugs is itself siphoned off from welfare.  This article is just one of the many ways that non-whites turn welfare &#8220;services&#8221; into cash.  The reason they want cash is to buy drugs.  Almost all of that money that is being paid to a welfare recipient in return for their pain meds is itself used to buy drugs.  Welfare, all over the world, IS the narcotics trade.  They are one and the same.</p>
<p>Almost nobody is working for the money to get their drugs.  It all comes from welfare in various forms.  Eliminate the welfare (or, if whites ever wake up enough for this&hellip;..eliminate the welfare, except for white people) and you eliminate the drug trade.</p>
<p>And no&hellip;..legalizing drugs will not help.  Drugs are not a normal commodity like food, fuel, or even tobacco.  Normal laws of commerce don&rsquo;t apply and anyone who studies the history of drugs, both when and where they are legal and illegal, will easily see this.  Drugs = death&hellip;.not only for individuals but for society.  YOUR drug habit harms MY family.  So YOU go to jail and no silly rationalization will change that.  Luckily, nobody has much of a mind to work for their drugs&hellip;..making welfare both the source of the problem and its Achilles heel.  You may find the occasional dirt bag pot smoker holding down a normal job (barely&hellip;although they never admit it).  But that&rsquo;s the exception, not the rule.  Drugs are about non-white, violent criminals&hellip;.often as they victimize a woman slave who was trafficked since she was a child.  That is the cold, hard truth.</p>
<p>The other thing to notice is that prescription painkillers don&rsquo;t give much of a high.  Not for the buck anyway.  Pain meds are not normally a recreational drug.  Too expensive.  The high is largely non-existent, as anyone who has had to take the occasional percocet (oxycontin is nothing but percocet without the tylenol added, by the way) can tell you.  No.  At high levels or snorting, injecting or whatever drug psychopaths do, it&rsquo;s probably more intense, but a high dose of these meds could easily stop a person&rsquo;s heart&hellip;..severely limiting how much you can take.</p>
<p>The point is, pain meds and drug abuse are not normally intertwined.  Pain patients are not feeding the source of drug users and drug crime.  Welfare to non-whites feeds this problem.  Not grandma who needs her percocet to deal with her hip fracture.  Nor the cancer patient.  Nor the poor person in intensive care for whatever reason.  The idea that they do is a lie, designed to enable real drug users while causing real SUFFERING to those in need.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only the non-white drug psychopath who gets it into his head that he might like snorting his grandmothers pain meds (or his AIDS medication for that matter).  Not the other way around.  NEVER the other way around.  No cancer patient develops a heroin habit after he comes off his pain meds with chemo/radiation/surgery or whatever.</p>
<p>This is an important thing to get.  Our disgusting elites KNOW all this.  It&rsquo;s the main reason welfare exists in the first place (what&hellip;you thought welfare existed to feed the poor&hellip;..better wake up).  It&rsquo;s also the reason why doctors and pain patients are persecuted.</p>
<p>This article exists, not in the hopes that people will wake up and demand welfare be disbanded, but as a sick excuse to make it difficult or even impossible for sick people in real hardcore pain, to get appropriate treatment.</p>
<p>Think on that.  And think about what a proper&hellip;..response&hellip;..should be to those doing these things.</p>

		<p>Like this is supposed to shock me?  There are few things I can read on here that shock me anymore.  I thought this was common knowledge, not even news worthy.  Amren should look up all the bridge card/food stamp fraud in southeast Michigan that the Arabs that own all the gas stations around here buy from welfare queens in Detroit.  They take their money for 80 cent on the dollar and the welfare queens (and kings) go to the casino or buy 40&rsquo;s and weed.  Laugh or deny all you want, but stereotypes are called stereotypes because they are mostly true.  </p>

		<p>This happens all the time in my experience. I have had more than one person I have dealt with who has a valid medical issue and gets SSI. He wants to supplement that SSI with some cash, and starts selling his prescriptions to dealers.  A valid Medical card is essentially a small business. The patients are herded to doctors in on the scam, create a phony pain/illness,  then they are taken to sell the drugs, and a bonus is paid to bring other new patients into the scam by the dealers. There is an enormous amount of prescription drugs on the black market this way. And we pay the bill for this theft. </p>

		<p>Just like with any other type of entitlement.  Drug dealers open coach welfare claimants for the interview and know the forms better than some social workers.</p>

		<p>A simple partial solution would be to bar anyone caught doing this from receiving any more mediciad for life, but the real key to combatting this would be undercover sting operations going after the doctors.</p>
<p>The existing mandatory minimum sentences for trafficking in hard drugs, with the added sentences for medicaid fraid, are going to make the participants in this theft from taxpayers rather less pleased with the money they were making.</p>
