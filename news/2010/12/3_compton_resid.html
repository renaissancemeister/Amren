			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Abby Sewell, Los Angeles Times, December 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Three Compton residents are suing the city under the California Voting Rights Act, contending that the city&rsquo;s elections are stacked against Latino candidates.</p>
<p>The complaint filed Thursday in Los Angeles County Superior Court alleges that the at-large elections for City Council seats have the effect of diluting the Latino vote. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The mayor and the four members of Compton&rsquo;s City Council are African American. Compton was long seen as a primarily black community, but Latino residents now make up about two-thirds of the city&rsquo;s population. The suit alleges that although Latino candidates have run for council seats in a number of elections, no Latino candidate has been elected since at least 1999.</p>
<p>Compton council members represent specific geographic districts within the city, but voting for each seat is not restricted to residents of the district. {snip}</p>

		<p>You know what&rsquo;s going to happen?  The latinos will eventually take over that city, and all others around it, and the blacks will move further into white areas and file the same type of civil suits against white towns.  (I say towns because save for three or four places, there are no more &#8216;white&rsquo; cities.)</p>

		<p>Now THAT takes chutzpah.  What the article fails to mention is the reason hispanics are now a majority is they have instituted wide scale ethnic cleansing of blacks.  Shooting them on sight and at random has had the effect of forcing the majority of them to flee.  Now that they are the majority, they want to control things politically.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is an orchestrated pogrom.  But it&rsquo;s &#8220;racist&#8221; to notice.</p>

		<p>While I know Hispanics aren&rsquo;t going to be our friends if/when a race war breaks out, I can&rsquo;t get myself to have any sympathy for blacks getting shut out and displaced by them.  Mostly because of how hypocritical lots of blacks are when it comes to racial issues, and also because blacks pushed whites out of their neighborhoods and forced whites to associate with them.</p>

		<p>Why didn&rsquo;t they petition for illegals to get the vote? Haven&rsquo;t they voted themselves the vote in any of these small districts yet?</p>

		<p>Maybe Mr. Jones can organize one of his Compton cookouts. Forty ouncers, fried chicken, plenty of rap music. Bring all the interested parties together - - bring harmony and settle all issue. Check you piece at the door, however.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s see. Hispanics ran for office but didn&rsquo;t get elected. This naturally didn&rsquo;t have anything to do with the fact that more people voted for &#8220;the other guy&#8221;. Noooo, it&rsquo;s all due to the evil racisssssts&hellip;</p>

		<p>Interesting article, even though it&rsquo;s not quite clear what&rsquo;s going on here. Looks like the &#8220;at large&#8221; voting scheme is keeping blacks in power, but this doesn&rsquo;t tell the whole story. A large illegal immigrant community is making the Hispanic population look very large, but the fact is they can&rsquo;t vote. Also, Hispanics in general don&rsquo;t vote. Also, blacks, for all their faults, DO vote - and in this case they&rsquo;re voting far more than the Hispanics are. So, in effect, Compton&rsquo;s Hispanics probably only have themselves to blame for not being able to take power commensurate with their numbers. This will likely change though. The demographic tide is inevitable.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more interesting to me about this article is the glimpse of the future that it offers us, especially if nothing is done to stop the invasion of illegals from Mexico.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this multicult myth that once whites are outnumbered and made a minority that the skies will open up and a new day of social justice will arrive. </p>
<p>Ha! </p>
<p>Some of the most racist countries towards blacks that I&rsquo;ve ever visited were in Latin America. The great anti-white multicult coalition will collapse with a resounding boom once this becomes a minority majority country.</p>

		<p>It looks like the Rainbow Coalition is doing about as well as expected.  We all know that when whites become a small and insignificant minority the blacks and Hispanics will be at each others throats.<br>

		<p>For a generation raised on supposed tales of blacks being denied voting rights in America&rsquo;s south, it is rather ironic that once blacks have got power they are racially exclusive than any other ethnicity.</p>

		<p><i>it is rather ironic that once blacks have got power they are (more) racially exclusive than any other ethnicity.</i></p>
<p>Hispanics are also racially exclusive.  ALL races are racially exclusive, which is normal.   Whites are &#8220;inclusive&#8221; only because of government force.</p>

		<p>I understand why Conservative White Anglos take the side of American Blacks against invading illegal and legal Latinos - it always gives conservatives a &#8220;feel good&#8221; that they are on the side of the Blacks as liberals always bash conservatives for being RACIST against Blacks.</p>
<p>The reality is our White indo European people simply can not live under the power, domination of Black Africans, Black African Americans - not in Santo Domingo/Haiti, not in Detroit, Zimbabwe, St. Louis or Compton.</p>
<p>We can find ways to live with/around Hispanics - so what if some LaRaza, Reconquistas mouth off and try to be as anti White as the worst Blacks, it just isn&rsquo;t the same.</p>
<p>Lots of higher caste Hispanic women make perfectly good wives and mothers to straight White American guys getting abused on US college campuses - so learn some Spanish.</p>
<p>Whites have done well, OK in Latin America - just check out those great White Hispanic soccer teams that kicked a** in the World Cup held in South Africa.</p>
