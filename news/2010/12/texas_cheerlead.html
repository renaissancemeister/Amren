			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nina Mandell, New York Daily News, December 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A former high school cheerleader who claims she was kicked off the team when she refused to chant the name of her alleged rapist is taking her case to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The cheerleader is asking for the country&rsquo;s highest court to reverse an appeals court ruling dismissing the suit and ordering her (and her parents) to reimburse tens of thousands of dollars in legal costs, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Her lawyers argued that no terms in the cheer squad contract required her to cheer each time the squad began a chant and doing so violated her first amendment rights.</p>
<p>&#8220;She cheered the entire game except for a two brief times when the accused rapist went to the free-throw line,&#8221; her lawyers said in a court briefing.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lawyers for the school district deny any wrongdoing and said that Bolton had not been charged at the time  &mdash;  and had in fact been cleared by two grand juries. When he was finally indicted by a third one, he was expelled, according to ABC.</p>
<p>He eventually was indicted on felony sexual assault of a minor and pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault, receiving a one-year suspended sentence, two years probation, community service and a $2500 fine, KDHM reported in September.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel relieved,&#8221; he told the news station after the ruling. &#8220;I&rsquo;m glad we came to an agreement and I&rsquo;m just ready to move on with my life.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I hope our Supreme Court has a few more brain cells that that Texas appeals court. Their ruling was underhanded and stunk to high heaven. Her rapist is just as disgusting. &#8220;I feel relieved we came to an agreement and I&rsquo;m ready to move on with my life.&#8221; He&rsquo;s only relieved because he&rsquo;s not in prison, which is where he belongs. Easy for him to move on. Not so easy for his victim. And the school district should be ashamed, trying to wiggle out of it by saying Bolton had not been charged at the time. I hope the victim brings a civil suit against all involved - from the officials of her school district, that creep Bolton and the NAACP. Having your school make you choose between cheering for your rapist or being kicked off the cheerleading squad not only adds insult to injury, it should be considered a HATE CRIME.<br>

		<p>If the cheerleader had been  black, and the alleged rapist, white, every black moral charlatan in the country would have flown to the E. Texas town and demanded justice, demonstrations, the destruction of the downtown, torching of the high school,a guilty verdict, followed by a speedy trial and federal hate-crime charges. And our post-racial president would have assured the black community that his DOJ is following the local prosecution.  In Durham, the putative victim didn&rsquo;t have to be a cheerleader or a minor: being black was sufficient. What outrage and horror will it take to arouse the white race?</p>

		<p>Although I disagree with the punishment, I also take issue with the idea that the federal government should review all school policies.  It is simply too easy to print a story that gives the people a biased view of facts that favor policy X and then pass it for political reasons, causing endless problems at the local level.</p>
<p>Do we know all the facts of this case?  Not really, and neither do the federal politicians who write the laws that the federal judges are required to base their conclusions on.</p>

Move on! I guess that is the battle cry of the &#8220;oppressed&#8221; minority that has been caught in the act! Just say you are sorry and everything is OK! You are vindicated - and the assailant is let go and can continue on their decadent ways! </p>

<p>I can just about hear these do-gooder white cowards on the first two juries wanting to be all-compassionate, all-caring, giving the benefit of the doubt to the black criminal, feeling morally superior for doing so, even though they probably knew he committed a crime.</p>
<p>None of them deserve safety or prosperity and would evolve as better individuals if they lost their homes, their money and mostly their positions during this continuing economic plummet, while they stood by and observed a black controlled government passing them up for government assistance in favor of blacks, telling them their lives of privilege was over.</p>

		<p>It is in such incidents as this one white commentators need to bring up the US Dept of Justice stats which show an average of 37,500 black on white rapes per year, while the reverse is almost non-existent.</p>
<p>The same thing should have been done in the La Cross debacle where white boys were wrongly accused by a black prostitute.</p>
<p>We need to get out copies of Amren&rsquo;s Color of Crime and send it to all our local talk shows, then call in and make referenbce to the black on white stats.</p>
<p>I sent copies of the report to the circuit judge in my area, the high school, the grade school and several members of the Sheriff&rsquo;s Department, as well as the police chiefs in about a 60 mile radius.  Both radio stations received copies.</p>

<p>One is no more &#8220;cleared&#8221; by a grand jury than one is found &#8220;innocent&#8221; by a petit jury. Failure by the grand jury to return a true bill (indictment) means no more than the State failed to proffer <i>sufficient</i> evidence that this man committed a crime. The defendant&rsquo;s side of the story is, for a grand jury, meaningless, because its decisions speak only to the State&rsquo;s burden. He is not &#8220;cleared&#8221;; he is merely not charged, for the time being. Moreover, because a grand jury&rsquo;s proceedings are <i>not</i> a final decision on the merits, double jeopardy protections don&rsquo;t even arise. How, then, can it ever be said that the grand jury has &#8220;adjudicated&#8221; anything, one way or the other? </p>
<p>This is all basic criminal law, which surely these &#8220;lawyers for the school district&#8221; must know, yet they appear to be issuing misleading statements in anticipation of litigation. Doesn&rsquo;t this now make their conduct a matter for the state&rsquo;s lawyer disciplinary body?</p>
<p>Not to mention their role in denying this victim her protections under the 14th Amendment. </p>

		<p><i>The cheerleader is asking for the country&rsquo;s highest court to reverse an appeals court ruling dismissing the suit</i></p>
<p>SCOTUS may or may not choose to take this case.</p>
<p>Here is another heart-breaking case out of Indiana:</p>
<p><i>Teenage student commits suicide after &#8216;sex attack&rsquo; by Notre Dame football player</i></p>
<p> <i>A university student has committed suicide days after alleging she was raped by a Notre Dame athlete.  Elizabeth Seeburg was just a few weeks into her freshman year at Saint Mary&rsquo;s College in Indiana when she took her own life.</i></p>
<p>Did you guess that Elizabeth Seeburg was a young White female?  A beautiful, young White female.</p>
<p>Did you also assume that the Nortre Dame athlete was a black football player?</p>
<p>Move to the head of the class!</p>
<p>This article is from the Daily Mail, from the UK, not the US.  I wouldn&rsquo;t doubt if this story were not reported anywhere in the US.</p>
<p><i>Nine days earlier Miss Seeburg had reported being sexually assaulted by a football player at the neighbouring college</i><b> but no one has been charged with a crime.</b></p>
<p><i>More than two months after the alleged incident, Notre Dame has not yet released details of its investigation saying they are &#8216;legally prohibited&rsquo; from divulging any information.</i></p>
<p>Yet another case of a black athlete rapist being protected because of his race, no investigation forthcoming, the victim White, so not worth investigating.</p>
<p>The Daily Mail published a photo of the White rape victim, but not the black &#8216;athlete&rsquo;   &mdash;   no mention of the rapists race, even though the victim&rsquo;s photo is prominently displayed.  Are you surprised?</p>
<p>This was also at the bottom of the Daily Mail&rsquo;s article:</p>
<p><i>We are no longer accepting comments on this article.</i></p>
<p>Wonder what was in those comments.</p>
<p>For a photo of both the rape victim and the rapist, see here:</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t it interesting how so many of these news items come to our attention via Britain, Australia, etc.?  Is that indicative of a shameful laxity   &mdash;   or even downright timidity - on the part of the American press?</p>
<p>I could even say  &#8220;complicity&#8221; because if they&rsquo;re not telling the truth and discharging their obligation to disseminate the news (instead of covering it up) then they&rsquo;re contributing to the lie. </p>
<p><i>Nine days earlier Miss Seeburg had reported being sexually assaulted &hellip; but no one has been charged.<br>
More than two months after the alleged incident, Notre Dame has not yet released details of its investigation &hellip;</i></p>
<p>If indeed there is any &#8220;investigation&#8221; going on!  (Which seems dubious. At the best, after two inconclusive months,  it can hardly be very vigorous.)</p>
<p><i>The Daily Mail published a photo of the White rape victim, but not the black &lsquo;athlete&rsquo;  &mdash;  no mention of the rapists race, even though the victim&rsquo;s photo is prominently displayed. Are you surprised?</i></p>
<p>In the US, it is common practice not to release the identity or photographs of sex-crime victims.  I don&rsquo;t know about the UK. And don&rsquo;t know about the protocol AFTER the victim is dead. </p>
<p>At the least, if they&rsquo;re going to release the victim&rsquo;s photograph, it would seem appropriate to release the attacker&rsquo;s also.  It is bizarre to show one but not the other.  The only explanation can be that they are protecting him. WHY? What is there to hide? </p>
<p>Of course, we all know the answer.</p>

<p>Here is the <i>Daily Mail</i> article.  Notice the large photo of the victim, no photo or mention of the rapist or his race (which in and of itself is indicative that the criminal/murderer/rapist/assailant is black).</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/2e3fzqy" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2e3fzqy</a></p>
<p>And yes, it&rsquo;s amazing how many times I&rsquo;ve had to go to the Australian, British or even South African press to find out information about crime stories that have taken place in the US, especially black male/White female rapes and murders.</p>

		<p>Bon, I stumbled upon the Seeberg/Notre Dame story a few days back, and googled around furiously, until I found an alternative news site that (finally!!!) named Seeberg&rsquo;s alleged assailant.</p>
<p>I dare not mention the mental images from 1930s movies that are summoned by the name &#8216;Prince Shembo&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Anyway, It&rsquo;s difficult to piece the story together, because no one dares tell it in more than bits and pieces: but from what I can gather together, &#8216;Prince Shembo&rsquo; from the Congo caused considerable distress to his classmates in America, before entering college.  Reportedly, after years of complaints about his bullying, he was finally expelled for throwing a desk at a teacher who had confiscated his Cell Phone.</p>
<p>This would have easily been discovered by Notre Dame&rsquo;s recruiters, who supposedly screen players carefully, that they might only have players whose inner spirit/moral rectitude/la la la la la&hellip; is in keeping with the school&rsquo;s Christian ideals.  YEAH!  </p>
<p>The more I read, the more the story seems to be about Notre Dame&rsquo;s efforts to intimidate the Seeberg family (Who for several generations have been &#8216;Notre Dame People&rsquo;) into silence, and the school&rsquo;s efforts to protect a football player at the expense of a third-generation student&hellip;a girl who spent her summers building houses for Habitat&hellip;someone who, indeed, lived her Christian ideals.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t these gung-ho booster families know that while their hearts and souls may belong to the institutions they revere, those institutions regard THEM as nothing but fodder for their money machines?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d imagine Elizabeth Seeberg&rsquo;s family has a solid millennium of service and tithing to the Church in its history.  Yet all of that is worth naught, when the reputation of a Football team at a Church-affiliated college might be tarnished.</p>
<p>A thousand years of tithing?  Old news!  Just fodder&hellip;.</p>
