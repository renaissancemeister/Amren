<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Lured by unsupervised, third-party brokers with promises of steady jobs and a chance to sightsee, some foreign college students on summer work programs in the U.S. get a far different taste of life in America.</p>
<p>An Associated Press investigation found students forced to work in strip clubs instead of restaurants. Others take home $1 an hour or even less. Some live in apartments so crowded that they sleep in shifts because there aren&rsquo;t enough beds. Others have to eat on floors.</p>
<p>They are among more than 100,000 college students who come to the U.S. each year on popular J-1 visas, which supply resorts with cheap seasonal labor as part of a program aimed at fostering cultural understanding.</p>
<p>Government auditors have warned about problems in the program for 20 years, but the State Department, which is in charge of it, only now says it is working on new rules. Officials won&rsquo;t say what those rules are or discuss on the record the problems that have plagued J-1 visas.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The AP interviewed students, advocates, local authorities and social service agencies, and reviewed thousands of pages of confidential records, police reports and court cases. Among the findings:</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Many foreign students pay recruiters to help find employment, then don&rsquo;t get work or wind up making little or no money at menial jobs. Labor recruiters charge students exorbitant rent for packing them into filthy, sparsely furnished apartments so crowded that some endure &#8220;hotbunking,&#8221; where they sleep in shifts.</p>
<p>Students routinely get threatened with deportation or eviction if they quit, or even if they just complain too loudly. Some resort to stealing essentials like food, toothpaste and underwear, according to police.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>  &mdash;  The State Department failed to even keep up with the number of student complaints until this year, and has consistently shifted responsibility for policing the program to the 50 or so companies that sponsor students for fees that can run up to several thousand dollars. That has left businesses to monitor their own treatment of participants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Businesses that hire students can save 8 percent by using a foreign worker over an American because they don&rsquo;t have to pay Medicare, Social Security and unemployment taxes. The students are required to have health insurance before they arrive, another cost that employers don&rsquo;t have to bear.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Strip clubs and adult entertainment companies openly solicit J-1 workers, even though government regulations ban students from taking jobs &#8220;that might bring the Department of State into notoriety or disrepute.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>J-1 students have been recruited to smuggle cash that authorities said was stolen from U.S. bank accounts, court records show, and their identities have been used in a million-dollar income tax scam.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the worst cases, students get funneled into sexual slavery.</p>
<p>The J-1 Summer Work and Travel program, which allows college students to visit for up to four months, is one of the State Department&rsquo;s most popular visas. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hotels, restaurants and other businesses often hire third-party labor recruiters to supply the J-1 workers. Many of those brokers are people from the students&rsquo; native countries, often former Soviet bloc nations.</p>
<p>These middlemen commonly dock students&rsquo; pay so heavily for lodging, transportation and other necessities that the wages work out to $1 an hour or less, according to George Collins, an inspector at the Okaloosa County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department in the Florida Panhandle who has worked cases involving J-1 students since 2001.</p>

		<p>They speak of &ldquo;abuses&rdquo; in the student visa program as if the whole student visa program isn&rsquo;t already an abuse to begin with.  That concept is as bone-headedly redundant as saying the phrase, &#8220;tragic murder.&#8221;  (As opposed to all those non-tragic murders.)</p>
<p>People incorrectly think that various companies that use a lot of H-1B visas actually go to India and China and recruit people to come over to the United States and work.  No, they don&rsquo;t do that, because they don&rsquo;t have to  &mdash;  The Indians and Chinese are already here on legal student visas, and once they graduate, the tech big wigs or whatever corporate big wigs merely do the paperwork to shift their legal immigrant visa from a student visa to an H-1B or similar visa.  Of course, most or all of the expense to move the from Asia to the United States already occurred when the students started school on their student visas, those costs being covered through student loans or scholarships or grants or what not.</p>
<p>Also, while the term &ldquo;illegal alien&rdquo; usually provokes the thought of Jorge or Jose sneaking across a busted fence in the middle of the desert in the middle of the night, the truth of the matter is that a big percentage, if not a majority, of &ldquo;illegal aliens&rdquo; in the United States are from countries where a direct land migration isn&rsquo;t possible, i.e. from the other side of the world and a whole ocean away.  Their status as an illegal alien is merely the result of their overstaying their visa.  So they enter legally but don&rsquo;t stay legally.</p>
<p>Point is, for the most part, the student visa program is the keystone of the economic dispossession of native born working and middle class white Americans.</p>

<p>Sounds like what the US, state, &amp; local governments have been doing to me through taxation for the past 50 years. <br>

		<p>Yeah, and over 25,000 of these students come from Saudi Arabia alone (the U.S. has a special deal with the Saudis).  It&rsquo;s funny how so many of these college students would rather live in steerage-like conditions and being a hooker/stripper and making less than a dollar an hour then go home where they can get an amazing job with a U.S. degree in their native land.  Something does not add up.  Please fellow Amreners, please enlighten me as to why this is so.  I honestly do not know.  Are they really coming over hear for a college education, then claiming asylum?  Do they want welfare and this is the easiest way to get it?  A bachelor&rsquo;s degree from a U.S. college would go a LONG way in India, China, or the middle east.  Why do they stay if life is so bad?  WHY?</p>

		<p>Student visas are a racket anyway. Many students, especially Muslims will come here on a student visa and start looking for an unsuspecting American woman to marry so he has a ticket to a greencard and the ability to bring the rest of his family here- possibly including a wife and family. Since people for whom English is not a first language often take more than 4 years to finish a degree they often resort to this deceptive tactic to finish a degree.</p>

		<p>The University of Pittsburgh is a &#8220;state related&#8221; school in Western Pennsylvania i.e. it is partially supported by taxpayer money.</p>
<p>One of its official documents published on the internet outlines for business the great advantages of hiring foreign students.  It also offers to work with companies to avoid any problems with visas and points out the tax advantages - no FICA no Medicare etc.</p>
<p>It is disgraceful that an American institution is actively working against the interests of the great majority of people that make its existence possible.</p>
<p>I suggest that no one consider sending their children to Pitt especially Pennsylvanians. Tell everyone about their disgusting behavior.</p>

		<p>   It&rsquo;s no secret that American Universities run white-collar sweatshops with foreign teaching assistants. These students get little money but teach multiple sections of undergraduate classes. I&rsquo;ve known some of these foreign students to continue their twilight existences for over ten years! I might say that in my experience few South Asian, Middle Eastern, Latin American or African Students return to their home countries after graduation. They are either hired by U.S. companies for cheap labor and affirmative action quotas, or they simply jump their Visas and stay on working illegally in the underground economy.</p>
