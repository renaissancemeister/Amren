			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), December 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A school district is being sued for not allowing a Muslim teacher to take unpaid leave to make a pilgrimage to Mecca.</p>
<p>The Federal Government has brought the case on behalf of Safoorah Khan, claiming that it is a violation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.</p>
<p>It is the duty of every Muslim to join the million of pilgrims at the Hajj in Mecca at least once in their lifetime  &mdash;  and the middle school teacher had hoped to go in 2008.</p>
<p>Khan had started at Berkeley School, in the suburbs of Chicago, Illinois, in 2007 and asked for unpaid leave of three weeks to visit Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>After the education district twice denied her request, Khan wrote to the board that &#8216;based on her religious beliefs, she could not justify delaying performing Hajj&rsquo;.</p>
<p>She resigned shortly thereafter, according to the lawsuit filed in federal court.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors say the leave was unrelated to her professional duties and was not set forth in the contract between the school district and the teachers&rsquo; union, thus violating her civil rights.</p>
<p>The government asked the court to order the school district to adopt policies that reasonably accommodate its employees&rsquo; religious practices and beliefs, and to reinstate Khan with back pay and also pay her compensatory damages.</p>
<p>In November 2008, Khan filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which found reasonable cause that discrimination had occurred and forwarded the matter to the U.S. Justice Department.</p>
<p>The school district would not comment.<br>

		<p>The leave was unpaid but I think that she should have saved vacation or sick days for the trip- either that or take a sabbatical. I do wonder about the wisdom of having Muslim teachers to begin with.</p>

		<p>The majority of these types of people do not like Americans and are only here to make money that they can&rsquo;t make elsewhere. A large number game the system in various ways, such as welfare scamming, tax schemes, immigration fraud, and so on. No matter how kindly they are treated they will never appreciate it as we are the enemy. That the federal government backs her just shows how we end up financing our own undoing.  </p>

		<p>Keep in mind that this pilgrimmage is the celebration of the life and journeys of a mass-murdering, illiterate, epileptic madman and pedophile.  There is absolutely nothing noble about Islam.</p>
<p>According to Answers.com a Semester is between 14 and 16 weeks long.  So with two semesters per school year, she is asking to be absent for one fifth of a semester or one tenth of a school year, &#8216;off&rsquo;.  Either when her students are presumably either just getting comfortable with (imprinting) her &#8216;special talents&rsquo; or have not even met her.</p>
<p>And this is The Hajj for those who haven&rsquo;t cared to delve-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
The pilgrimage occurs from the 8th to 12th day of Dhu al-Hijjah, the 12th and last month of the Islamic calendar. Because the Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar, eleven days shorter than the Gregorian calendar used in the Western world, the Gregorian date of the Hajj changes from year to year. Ihram is the name given to the special state in which Muslims live while on the pilgrimage.</p>
<p>The Hajj is associated with the life of Islamic prophet Muhammad from the 7th century, but the ritual of pilgrimage to Mecca is considered by Muslims to stretch back thousands of years to the time of Abraham (Ibrahim). Pilgrims join processions of hundreds of thousands of people, who simultaneously converge on Mecca for the week of the Hajj, and perform a series of rituals: Each person walks counter-clockwise seven times around the Kaaba, the cube-shaped building which acts as the Muslim direction of prayer, runs back and forth between the hills of Al-Safa and Al-Marwah, drinks from the Zamzam Well, goes to the plains of Mount Arafat to stand in vigil, and throws stones in a ritual Stoning of the Devil. The pilgrims then shave their heads, perform a ritual of animal sacrifice, and celebrate the three day global festival of Eid al-Adha.[2][3][4]</p>
<p>As of 2010, about three million pilgrims participate in this annual pilgrimage.[5][6] Crowd-control techniques have become critical, and because of the large numbers of people, many of the rituals have become more stylized. It is not necessary to kiss the Black Stone, but merely to point at it on each circuit around the Kaaba. Throwing pebbles was done at large pillars, which for safety reasons in 2004 were changed to long walls with catch basins below to catch the stones. The slaughter of an animal can be done either personally, or by appointing someone else to do it, and so forth.[7] But even with the crowd control techniques, there are still many incidents during the Hajj, as pilgrims are trampled in a crush, or ramps collapse under the weight of the many visitors, causing hundreds of deaths. Pilgrims can also go to Mecca to perform the rituals at other times of the year. This is sometimes called the &#8220;lesser pilgrimage&#8221;, or Umrah. However, even if one chooses to perform the Umrah, they are still obligated to perform the Hajj at some other point in their lifetime if they have the means to do so.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj</a></p>
<p>As you might expect from a historicallly barbarous butcher of innocents (but not a religion that specifically forbids idolatry) it includes such joys as sacrificing animals and circling the Kaaba shrine seven times to pay homage to a black meteorite stone, kissing it if at all possible.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d think they were Irish.</p>
<p>It does not fall within the Gregorian Calender but within the lunar one which means that it&rsquo;s dates rotate quite a bit and a little bit of careful planning (i.e. longterm notification) could allow the Imrah pilgrim to perform their duties as a muslim without any fuss.  Indeed, the _umrah_ alternative allows them to go at other dates, if they have no choice.</p>
<p>The question then becomes how much Mz./Mrs. Khan tried to synchronized her personal, religious duties, with her professional, secular, ones.  And indeed how much we can trust such a &#8216;devout&rsquo; person to -ever- have the care and guidance of her _non muslim_ charges uppermost in her mind, separate from any proselytizing or other religious driven behavior.</p>
<p>I have no problems with this woman practicing her primitive rites outside our lands.  I just wish she would stay in Saudi and enjoy the freedom of her beliefs there.  She certainly won&rsquo;t have any others.</p>

<p>And why three weeks? Hajj week doesn&rsquo;t exceed five days. </p>
<p>There is also &#8216;Umrah&rsquo; (al-Umrat al mufradah), which means visiting Mecca at other times of the year. </p>

		<p>The law says REASONABLE accomodation of religion. I&rsquo;d like to take off on a three week vacation somewhere on the other side of the world, too, and have my job waiting for me when I felt like coming back  &mdash;  but it isn&rsquo;t likely to happen in this lifetime! To liken this foolishness to actual religious discrimination is ridiculous and outright Muslim pandering. Let me guess  &mdash;  she&rsquo;s also a member of one of the &#8220;protected&#8221; classes&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Well, I should mention that I am Cannabologist, and my church worships the holy Marijuana leaf. </p>
<p>I demand a 3 week vacation to Mecca (read: Amsterdam) as well, and if I damn don&rsquo;t get it I&rsquo;ll scream BIGOTRY until my face turns blue!</p>
<p>(And what about those guys that really love spaghetti too?) </p>
<p>But in all seriousness, the 3 weeks should be considered vacation time. No one else gets 3 whole weeks of vacation for *their* religion. And if she only has to do it *once* during her whole life, then why the hell can&rsquo;t be manage her vacation time in such a way that its possible?</p>

<p>If she has her entire life to take this trip why do it within a year of starting her job? Why not give a better advanced notice.  is it in her contract that she can take three weeks off &#8220;at-will&#8221; or does it need managerial approval based on school needs?</p>
<p>Watch the Fort Hood shooter try to say his religious convictions demanded he perform Jihad and if we try to convict him we are violating his civil rights.</p>
<p>These are the kinds of things tolerated in Europe and we as Americns must stand up to this hypocrisy.</p>

		<p>I requested one unpaid day before the Easter (oh excuse me!! Spring Break)holiday in order to get a head start on a drive to Florida from NJ. The School district refused it because it fell before a holiday. It was only a half day to start with. That&rsquo;s the way it works. TS Ms. Khan. Go back to from whence you came.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m beginning to think this hajj deal is a gigantic marketing scheme by the Mecca Tourist Board. </p>
<p>If none of this makes sense that&rsquo;s because you have islam in the middle of the story so don&rsquo;t expect anything to make sense.</p>
<p>First, it&rsquo;s a slippery slope. I generally don&rsquo;t agree with that type of argument but knowing how Americans love to game the system pretty soon you&rsquo;ll have scientologists asking to attend three week yacht races because some of the &#8220;religions&#8221; big-shots dress up as Love Boat Captains or some nonsense.</p>
<p>Taken to its extreme you&rsquo;ll end up having atheists asking for three weeks off to not practice their non-beliefs.</p>
<p>Civil rights, you would think, denotes some common sense. Let&rsquo;s say Safoorah wanted a day off to dress in a curtain and run in the direction of giant air horns every three hours. Fine. Whatever. Three weeks whenever you want to travel to the other side of the world so you can walk in circles around a big rock. Sorry - you have a job. You can&rsquo;t go. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that what she does that&rsquo;s the problem. Hey - you want to join 3 million others and hang in the desert - be me guest. Just do it on your own time. If that means finding a new job - hey - it&rsquo;s a free country (or it used to be).</p>
<p>She doesn&rsquo;t live in Saudi Arabia - she lives in the United States. Perhaps if she lived in Saudi Arabia she can go hajjing. So move there.  </p>
<p>This woman is taking advantage of - and using - American law to twist it for her personal and likely financial advantage. The school system knows that once they give her the okay to head off to jihad land the door is open for those suddenly celebrating &#8220;the nine weeks of Kwanza&#8221; or else more of those precious and expanding civil rights will be denied.</p>
<p>Besides, can&rsquo;t this woman see that she will essentially be a lightening rod for anger, and a pariah, in the job she wants back. A job working for an employer she apparently hates and has sued. Who in their right mind would want to go back to such an employer in the first place.</p>
<p>Does she think this will advance her teaching career when she applies for other jobs? She is a walking red flag - a loose cannon. How long before she demands special food in the cafeteria? A separate prayer room? Extra-curricular activities in bomb making?</p>
<p>The US government&rsquo;s involvement in this is a disgrace.</p>
<p>Why have we allowed things to reach this level of failure in a once great country?</p>

		<p>Since Hajj occurs at various times of the year she could also wait until it occurs in the summer time and make her pilgrimage. I think this is another case of Muslims pushing the system to try to get their agenda. They will push and push until eventually someone pushes back. How many stories about women wearing hijab getting hired and then demanding to wear the garment at work- after they were told that this was not allowed- and running to organizations like CAIR for lawsuits. </p>

		<p>Based on what the anonymous poster said in posts 4 and 6, this case should be thrown out and she should be forced to pay court costs. I&rsquo;m up to here with this moslem nonsense being forced upon us at every turn. If I, as a Christian, were to make even the smallest of demands in any muslim country regarding my faith, I&rsquo;d be lucky not to get stoned, let alone actually listened to. <br>
I&rsquo;ll retire to Bedlam. </p>

		<p>It occurs to me that schoolteachers receive three MONTHS of unpaid leave every year.  It&rsquo;s called &#8220;summer vacation&#8221;.  Christmas break is also normally a month, which would also cover the three weeks she wanted.  Use those times or quit your job, Safoora.</p>

		<p>Both Barack Obama and Eric Holder are storefront legal aid lawyers who don&rsquo;t realize the most important part of the Fifth Amendment is not due process, which was inserted into that amendment by liberal courts, but the core of the Amendment which protects private property from govt seizure. </p>
<p>There is nothing in the Constitution to guarantee that an employee can take off for Mecca to learn to hate Christian and Jews, or just to get a suntan, even if the sun&rsquo;s rays can penetrate the ugly garment she&rsquo;s made to wear. The employer&rsquo;s fifth Amendment property rights are violated by the Holder decision to rip off employers so Muslims can be happy and we thus bribe them yet again not to set off bombs in DC and other similar localities that liberals, lawyers, and policy wonks inhabit. </p>
<p>It would be helpful if the chief &#8220;law&#8221; enforcement officers of our gvt can read, and yes I know they went to Harvard.  For the likes of Holder and Obama, critical thinking skills and simple reading comprehension are not required for Ivy League admission.</p>

<p>Sounds like a scam to me. She started a job, ask for 3 weeks off that she knew she couldn&rsquo;t get, then resigns and sues. If she really wanted to go, she could have gone before she took the job.</p>
<p>I wonder what type of Muslim she is. Was she born into a Muslim family or did she convert? Remember the American women that converted to Islam and them demanded to have her driver license picture taken with her face covered. All that was showing were here eyes, complete with eye makeup. Sound like the same type of Muslim convert to me. <br>

<p>This is a lie. Islam says you may attend the hajj only if you can afford it. This includes getting permission to go. If you owned your own business, you would not need permission. If you have to get permission and cannot then you cannot afford the trip. Period</p>
