			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Scott Jaschik, Inside Higher Ed, December 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center is among the premier civil rights organizations in the United States, known for taking on hate groups and defending the powerless. A group of leading genocide scholars this month sent the center a stinging letter, obtained by Inside Higher Ed, that charges the center with getting out of a lawsuit in part by assisting &#8220;unscholarly and unethical&#8221; efforts to cast doubt on the Armenian genocide. </p>
<p>How could the Southern Poverty Law Center end up facing such an accusation?</p>
<p>One of its publications, Intelligence Report, in 2008 published an article called &#8220;State of Denial&#8221; about efforts by Turkey and the country&rsquo;s supporters to contest the view about which there is a wide scholarly consensus: that the deaths of up 1.5 million Armenians during World War I constituted a genocide. </p>
<p>Guenter Lewy, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, does not believe that a genocide took place, and he sued the center over two places where the article says that he is among those scholars whose work has been financially supported by Turkey. </p>
<p>One of the quotes in the article says: &#8220;Lewy is one of the most active members of a network of American scholars, influence peddlers and website operators, financed by hundreds of thousands of dollars each year from the government of Turkey.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; The problem with that statement   &mdash;   as the center has since acknowledged   &mdash;   is that there was never any evidence that Turkey financially supported Lewy&rsquo;s work. Lewy charged that it was defamatory to suggest that his scholarship was influenced by Turkish financial support.</p>
<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center settled the lawsuit with, in part, a retraction and apology for those statements. {snip}<br>
The retraction says in part: &#8220;We now realize that we misunderstood Professor Lewy&rsquo;s scholarship, were wrong to assert that he was part of a network financed by the Turkish Government, and were wrong to assume that any scholar who challenges the Armenian genocide narrative necessarily has been financially compromised by the Government of Turkey. We hereby retract the assertion that Professor Lewy was or is on the Government of Turkey&rsquo;s payroll. To our knowledge, Professor Lewy has never sought to deny or minimize the deaths of Armenians in Ottoman Turkey; nor has he sought to minimize the Ottoman regime&rsquo;s grievous wartime miscalculations or indifference to human misery in a conflict earmarked by widespread civilian suffering on all sides.&#8221;</p>
<p>The retraction goes on to say that Lewy&rsquo;s book, The Armenian Massacres in Ottoman Turkey: A Disputed Genocide, &#8220;does not substantiate a premeditated plan by the Ottoman regime to destroy because of ethnicity, religion, or nationality, as opposed to deport for political-military reasons, the Armenian population,&#8221; and that in holding this view &#8220;he is joined by such distinguished scholars as Professor Bernard Lewis of Princeton University.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But genocide scholars were galvanized as well. They said that the Southern Poverty Law Center, as a well-respected group, had been used to encourage a view that there is widespread disagreement over what happened to the Armenians. </p>
<p>Gregory H. Stanton, president of Genocide Watch and a research professor in genocide studies and prevention at George Mason University, said he understood the law center&rsquo;s need to settle the lawsuit. &#8220;We just wish that the statement they agreed to publish in their apology had not repeated Lewy&rsquo;s claim that there was no evidence of &#8216;premeditation&rsquo; of the Armenian genocide.&#8221; {snip}</p>

		<p>What this highlights is that there are problems with the definition and litmus test for use of the word &#8216;genocide&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If a regime carries out a policy to rid its territory of an identifiable group, but not necessarily bring about the deaths of all who belong to that group, it is debatable whether its policies can be called &#8216;genocide&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8216;Genocide&rsquo; either has a very broad definition covering many nuances, or a very strict and narrow one.</p>
<p>Attempts to extinguish the white race through miscegenation and multiculturalism is arguably a genocide, by the broader definition. </p>

		<p>I said it before when this issue came up, and I guess I&rsquo;ll say it again at the risk of sounding repetitive.</p>
<p>In taking the position that the Armenian mass murders was an act of genocide, the SPLC is putting itself into the direct line of fire of the ADL, an organization very similar to the SPLC in many ways.  (At least it is now, but the ADL really didn&rsquo;t become SPLC-ish until the SPLC came along, and the SPLC raised too much money from ADL members.  The ADL had to respond somehow.)  The ADL&rsquo;s position on Armenia is that it wasn&rsquo;t genocide, mainly because they don&rsquo;t want to cheapen the concept in light of the Holocaust.  On top of that, the ADL does accuse those who think Armenia was genocide of &#8220;holocaust denial.&#8221;</p>
<p>Open warfare between the ADL and SPLC in 2011.  Anyone bring any popcorn?</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t really know anything about the Armenian genocide, and am willing to leave it to others with far more knowledge than myself to determine what did or did not happen and who was responsible.  To me the most controversial statement in the above article was that Southern Poverty Law Center is &#8220;a well-respected group&#8221;.  Well respected by the lefties at MSNBC, maybe, not by normal people.</p>
<p>After all, the SPLC recently added the Family Research Council and Focus on the Family as hate groups because they oppose homosexual marriage.  But I can&rsquo;t help but note the inconsistency   &mdash;   the Catholic Church, conservative Protestant churches like the Southern Baptists, the Mormons, and, I believe, the majority of orthodox Rabbis all oppose homosexual marriage.  Why don&rsquo;t all those churches and synagogues get labeled as hate groups?  Probably because even the SPLC realizes how ridiculous it would make itself if it officially put 70% of Americans in hate groups.</p>

		<p>The most ironic (read: &#8220;hypocritical&#8221;) thing about the Southern Poverty Law Center is that NOT ONE of its top ten, highest paid executives is a minority.</p>

<p>In fact, according to the SPLC&rsquo;s hometown newspaper, the Montgomery Advertiser, despite being located LITERALLY in the back yard of Dr. Martin Luther King&rsquo;s home church, the SPLC has NEVER hired a person of color to a highly paid position of power. </p>

		<p>The SPLC is simply an agenda driven, Leftist fraud that seeks to impose its views on the entire nation. It does not hesitate to label as terrorist ordinary citizens who have political views that oppose their agenda, supporters of the 2nd Amendment, etc. It long ago ceased to be anything more than a very high profit, fraud that draws on a well chosen name to appear to be quite different from what it actually is.</p>

		<p>If we have decided to promote the idea of insidious genocide of whites via a conspiracy of leftist political programs like AA, and the rise of Political Correct thoughts and the need to police the apparent thoughts of people via law and media pressures, then we must accept that no premeditation was necessary for the Ottoman Turkish Army&rsquo;s actions in exterminating somewhere between 1,000,000 and 1,500,000 Armenians who had been systematically arrested beforehand and marched out to where they were liquidated.  I have to conclude that Lewy has likely been &#8220;encouraged&#8221; by the Turkish government in some manner.  The need for similar organizations to refrain from infighting so that they may focus on their raison d&rsquo;etre, the ferreting out of &#8220;racists&#8221; and other threats to the emerging social order trumps the truth of the Armenian genocide that was clearly a planned and orchestrated series of events with a clear intent of significantly reducing the Armenian population, if not extinct.  There is a very well documented page on the Armenian Genocide on Wikipedia, as well as other online sources.  One item worth mentioning is that during that time, a great deal of aid for Armenians was raised through the Near East Foundation, founded in 1915, in response to the ongoing extermination of Armenians, but aimed at other groups in need as well.</p>
<p>The American based Armenian community has been politically active lately in regard to this subject.  Turkey wants EU membership, and other Western links.  But we must remember that Turkey as the Ottoman Empire ruled for over 500 brutal years in the European Balkans and waged a never ending war against Europe, seeking to militarily break in and take over.  We have to assume that similar genocides of Europeans would have ensued, since the Armenian genocide occurred just before and during WW1, and was not the only case where the Ottoman government sponsored ethnic massacres during the late 19th century to the beginning of WW1.  </p>
<p>After reading the details of the Armenian Genocide, the following ideas emerge; Since Turkey was an ally of Germany and deployed methods of extermination that appear to have been copied and expanded upon later in WW2 by the Nazis, it seems that Holocaust scholars would naturally link them as an example of a growing brutality that combined medieval style ethnic massacres with emerging technologies including gas, drugs (morphine), and the use of concentration camps (up to 25 locations).  That Lewy hasn&rsquo;t acknowledged this obvious comparison seems to provide evidence for some immediate consideration as a motive in obscuring all that is known about the events commonly termed &#8220;The Armenian Genocide.&#8221;  I find it interesting that Hitler and his companions actually borrowed and enlarged upon methods used earlier by Muslims.  I have always felt secure in the idea that the Turks were the originators of torture and sadistic aspects of interrogation and punishment.  I always have thought that even the excesses of the Dominican Inquisition in Europe utilized methods learned or inspired through experiences as victims during the period of The Crusades.  All one need do is research the various reports of sadistic treatment of Ukrainian and Russian sex slaves in Turkey today to understand the inherent brutality of the Turks.  And they think (demand) that they ought to be admitted into the E.U.!  The obvious underlying aim is to complete through treaty what they were not able to do through military conquest.  But the brutality that awaits Europe (as it is already evolving) is guaranteed by history.</p>

		<p>Sorry for the second post, but I failed to add to my previous one item regarding evidence of funding, in this case from the Turkish government to Lewy or anyone in order to influence scholastic results.</p>
<p>Of course, such purchases of pre-determined findings occurs and has always been a major political player since the first written word.  For example, modern scholars (since the 17 century) have used handwriting analysis and a growing array of forensic technology to show how and when certain additions and modifications of texts of the New Testament were written, often as forgeries that claimed an earlier origin.  But one need not go so far in tracing the influences for Lewy&rsquo;s book on the Armenian Genocide.  As one who has served as a voluntary lobbyist for my professional organization as well as having a family member who was by profession a lobbyist, I can provide witness to the point that Lewy or anyone could have been graciously rewarded by the Turkish government via many methods.  No one at the SPLC or anywhere else could know what bank account in Switzerland, or Luxembourg, or Barbados, or anywhere might laundry deposits for anyone.  It would require the FBI to find out if he had any offshore accounts opened for him.  And sometimes rewards are material.  I recall one legislator whose secretary informed me that a certain national organization had just installed a swimming pool for his boss, so it wasn&rsquo;t likely talking to him would do me much good.  There must be a plethora of means for garnering or rewarding favorable scholarship.  It is well known that the few scientists who find anti-global warming data are typically employed or supported by the petroleum industry or other related concerns.  Researchers know that studying an entire project, from its sponsors to its actual methods of deduction and statistical interpretation is important, not merely the soundbite a claimed result might gain in political influence.</p>
<p>If we really want to win, we have to be smarter than them, not simply a reactionary force to them.  That means purging ourselves of the tendency to falsify or continue in obvious falsehood out of vainglorious pride.</p>

		<p>Hold the presses!  I just spent several hours reading up on this issue.  The genocides against Armenians by the Turks occurred over a period of years.  Lewy only stated that the Young Turks actions in 1915 did not appear to be genocidal as they were rather in reaction to the Allies invasion of Gallipoli and the fact that many Armenians were either Russian or antagonistic to Turkey and therefore had to be removed as they were engaging in guerilla warfare all over the peninsula at the time. The qualifiers to genocide is that premeditation/planning had to be demonstrated.  Since it resulted as an act of war during a war, he simply claimed that it did not qualify.  I did not read that he included any of the other much clearer examples of Turkish genocide of Armenians.  I don&rsquo;t think he would argue that the killing of the Armenians was not a war atrocity, just not genocide.  </p>
<p>It does seem that everyone involved in the controversy has some link to ethnic/national interest, as they are either Turkish, German, or in Lewy&rsquo;s case, an Ashkenazi Jew born in 1923 who escaped from Germany and fought in the &#8220;Jewish Brigade.&#8221;  But his history of the Armenian genocide seems less driven by personal interest than not.  He actually does not support the idea of the uniqueness of the Holocaust as a genocide and criticized the claim that Amerinds were subjected to genocide.  He seems more objective than most.  </p>
<p>So what we have is the SPLC making statements based on attitude and the need to find victims for persecution.  They might actually go out of business if they ran out of issues, so they have to look everywhere, EVEN AMONG THEIR OWN.</p>
