<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Eden Prairie School Board on Tuesday endorsed a plan to move as many as 1,100 elementary school children to new schools next fall, largely to desegregate the increasingly diverse district.</p>
<p>In a gymnasium packed with 200 people, the board voted 4-3 to let district administrators, led by Superintendent Melissa Krull, move the children to address capacity issues as well as disparate concentrations of students with economic needs. It&rsquo;s expected to result in the district&rsquo;s most extensive boundary changes in a decade.</p>
<p>Eden Prairie&rsquo;s decision has been widely anticipated by metro-area districts facing similar changes in student demographics, as they address the segregation of poverty and race in their schools.</p>
<p>The plan has been strongly opposed by many parents who fear the loss of neighborhood K-4 schools. While voicing public protests, they had urged school leaders to come up with a better plan.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Eden Prairie, home to 9,700 students, district administrators say they need to balance uneven capacity in schools and reduce a more than 33 percent gap among elementary schools in the number of low-income students.</p>
<p>The plan, championed by Krull, would move grades five and six from an intermediate school into K-4 elementary schools. Boundary lines would be redrawn to balance concentrations of poverty, which aligns with race.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Parent Ahmed Jama was the only person to speak on behalf of the plan. &#8220;We need to change in order to educate all of our students,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>About six parents spoke against it, pleading with the board to rethink other options to integrate the district and close the achievement gap while keeping schools K-4. &#8220;{snip}</p>

		<p>White people are tormented unmercilessly.  Being poor does not prevent a child from doing well in school.  I was poor has a child but my parents made sure we were well mannered, clean and fed.  And made sure our homework was done.</p>
<p>I, like many white folks, are forced to pay school taxes as well as private school tuition because of this nonsense.  That is essentially double taxation.  The camel&rsquo;s back is breaking and the system is near collapse.</p>

		<p>The School Board believes that Blacks are inferior to Whites.  They think that Blacks are incapable of learning (or behaving) if they associate with other Blacks.  The School Board believes that the only way that Blacks can learn is if they are intermingled with Whites   &mdash;   maybe White children can civilize them or maybe some of the White juju-magic power will rub off onto the helpless and ignorant Black children?</p>
<p>This type of action by the School Board is insulting, racist, and evil.  The School Board members should be thrown in jail for their hate-activities.  We have long known that Blacks are exactly the same as Whites, and therefore require no special programs.</p>

		<p> Why do the opponents of the plan insist on insisting (so to speak) that they&rsquo;re not against &#8220;integration of the schools&#8221;? If past experience is any indication, in the newly, artificially &#8220;integrated&#8221; schools, the under-achievers, mostly black or I don&rsquo;t know horseflesh, will drag down the Asian and White students who were doing much better than they. So why should parents of the kids who are doing reasonably well, want them mixed cheek-by-jowl with those who are racially and culturally different, and who are failing?</p>
<p> It&rsquo;s as a friend of mine, now deceased, who was a teacher in a suburban district near a large city in our state, said once. The schools there, urban and suburban, were subject to busing pursuant to a court order. &#8220;The White kids started learning all the black kids&rsquo; bad habits,&#8221; my friend said ruefully.</p>
<p> Ironically enough, a few years later, I heard a TV news report about just such a district, and the similar problems that it had after being artificially integrated. Only this time, the reporter was careful to find someone who said, and I quote, &#8220;The White kids and black kids learned each other&rsquo;s bad habits.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Again, drinking the liberal Koolaid!</p>
<p>They actually believe that putting poor people with middle class people causes the poor people to suddenly wake up, smell the coffee, develop a new purpose in life, gain a better work ethic and improve their habits, prospects and outlook.</p>
<p>Well it sounds good in theory, but it has not worked anywhere as advertised.  The only thing that has happened is that middle class adults and children LOSE quality of life and get scared.  Their taxes go up to pay for more &#8216;services&rsquo; for the poor, who just seem to stay hopeless no matter how many millions are shoveled at them every day.  </p>
<p>The white flight will set in and in 5-10 years that town will have been surrendered to the ghetto.  The whites will build a new town somewhere else and then another liberal admin in the school system will promote &#8216;desegregation&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Rinse and repeat until there is nowhere left to go and all of America is a hellhole ghetto.</p>

		<p>It never ends, does it? Various bureaucratic dictators implement social engineering schemes using other people&rsquo;s children as their pawns. Children are just their property to shuffle around as they see fit, never mind what the parents want. You&rsquo;ve only have the right to pay taxes in order to finance the government turning you into a mere serf.   </p>

<p>I mean, they are mixing in the most typical fashion: crime.</p>

When will the SPLC,ADL,NAACP, and National Coalition of Black Journalist start the candlelight prayer vigils and protests and boycotts against the AJC for &#8220;over-reporting crime in a shameful manner that reflects poorly upon the black community&#8221;?</p>
<p>https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta/sexual-assault-in-virginia-788431.html</p>
<p>Police say the suspect is a black man in his mid-40s who stands about 5-foot-8 and has little hair. He was &#8220;wearing a lot of dark clothes and had a very unpleasant odor,&#8221; said Officer Kim Jones, a police spokeswoman.</p>

<p>And just were does this &#8220;Ahmed Jama&#8221; get off thinking their opinion matters to us. Ahmed needs to understand that even if he&rsquo;s got his &#8220;papers&#8221;, he will NEVER be looked upon as an American, and in a sane world he wouldn&rsquo;t even be here to begin with. When people thru-out the world think of an American, I&rsquo;m sure most of them don&rsquo;t get visions of Snoop Dogg or Ahmed Jama!<br>
Someone needs to ask these idiots to give a list of the predominantly White schools that&rsquo;s gotten better academically after bussing in &#8220;yufs&#8221; from the ghetto! Demand a list - I want to know how this worked out at other schools before it happens to mine! Lets start out by studing the results of &#8220;diversity&#8221; at Little Rock High!</p>

		<p>The dream of uniform neighborhoods and schools, blended racially and socioecnomically, animates a large percentage of the people who control our government school systems.</p>
<p>These people cannot conceive any advantages in neighborhoods or schools that are allowed to be distinctive   &mdash;  - like, say, the once rich tapestry of ethnic neighborhoods of New York City before the busing mania drove whites to the suburbs.</p>
<p>No, universal conformity/sameness/drabnesss is the dream of people like Eden Prairie school board.  It&rsquo;s a Bolshevik&rsquo;s dream.  And it will take Bolshevik-like force to maintain it.  And, in the end, it will fail anyway   &mdash;  - as whites, once again, are driven from their schools and neighborhoods. </p>

		<p>Certainly the community needs to organize and toss out the four bad board members.  Can anyone here tell me when it became common practice to use schools as experiments in social engineering?  How can American communities tolerate this nonsense?<br>
I feel bad for the white students who will experience the change.  Their education will be compromised when the unavoidable regression to the mean sets in.  Then they will enter college completely unprepared, but without the affirmative action benefits of being a nonwhite or female.<br>
Support groups should be made for the parents and children when this happens in order to help them cope, to help them rise above the antiwhite discrimination, and to help them get a good western education.<br>
I am in my twenties and will probably be starting a family in the near future.  I can&rsquo;t imagine rolling over like these people have and like white communities did in the 60s with busing.  Revive our strong white communities we took for granted to fight this stuff and to damn with the self hating liberals.</p>

My child is dressed well, fed well, has both parents rearing him, does his homework, is polite, curious and hard working, he is part of a successful family environment; and you are going to sit some riff-raff kid next to him who comes from a single parent environment, whose mother is more likely into drugs, lives on the dole, who can barley read, can&rsquo;t do numbers, and brings nothing of value to the classroom but chaos? You people are nuts! Like politicians, school boards are there to sreve constiuents. if they don&rsquo;t, VOTE THEM OUT PRONTO!</p>

		<p>Poster #9 said: &ldquo;&rsquo;The White kids started learning all the black kids&rsquo; bad habits,&rsquo;&rdquo; my friend said ruefully.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is basically what happens.  The white kids decline in quality across the board.  The ones who were already bad become worse.  The mediocre ones slump in their scores and the smart kids get really, really jaded.</p>
<p>I have seen it with my own eyes.  I had a lone white student in an all black and latino school.  Yes, one italian boy.  He was just as ghetto as his peers.  IT was so, so sad to see a white person acting like that.  He also was allowed to use the &#8216;N&rsquo; word because he was an honorary homie.</p>
<p>Poster #17 mentions the &#8216;dream&rsquo; of our liberal elites, ensconced in government as they are.  They really do have this vision of a multicultural, multiracial wonderland where &#8216;diverse&rsquo; cultures meet, mingle and myscegenate to create a paradise of social justice.</p>
<p>This sounds simplistic, but it is their basic vision.  What they fail to realize is that when people mix they do not retain unique &#8216;diverse&rsquo; cultural markers but blend things together.  They say this is fine, but when whites move in a neighborhood (that used to be white decades before, by the way), the same liberals decry the &#8216;invasion&rsquo; and &#8216;gentrification.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When non-whites move into a white place, though, the liberals rejoice and say the raciss&rsquo; whites need to learn diversity to &#8216;better compete&rsquo; with a &#8216;more diverse&rsquo; world.  So whites must mix and change but non-whites can retain their &#8216;distinctive&rsquo; cultures.  </p>
<p>So why do they not tell that to the Tibetans who are being overwhelmed by Chinese cultural and political intrusion?  Oh, because the Dalai Lama is so cute!  That charming little non-violent man!  Let&rsquo;s protect his culture from diversity and &#8216;change&rsquo;!</p>
<p>The truth is that they are the authors of the &#8216;diversity&rsquo; that is flooding Amerika.  They are aiding and abetting it to fulfill their dream.  The right wing doesn&rsquo;t object because they want the cheap, slave-like labor peopns.  These liberals, btw, are self-hating whites who drank the marxist juju and look upon their own nation and race as all bad and all other races as innately good.</p>
<p>By the way - the movie Avatar showed exactley what kind of a world they dream of.  Noble forest dwellers in harmony with nature and possessing of a natural earth wisdom, vanquishing the evil chronologically-based white world of machines and cold science.  The whites will pass away save for the cleansed and repentant liberals who will assimilate and merge with them racially.</p>
<p>What they didn&rsquo;t answer was, when someone gets sick, where will the medicine come from?  (Natural herbs, they cry.)  When they want to play with their Ipad or turn on the TV, where will the electricity come from?  (Solar power, they say.)  But who will make the solar panels etc?  (The Chinese! they cry.)  Why will the Chinese sell them to us when we are primitive, in-touch-with-nature dweebs?  (Because they are noble and good! they will chant.)  Really?</p>

		<p>Liberals never face this.  In Chicago avoidance of black students became an art form, and still is to this day.  White libs used the elementary schools when they got a ruling for neighborhood schools that required some token bussing in of blacks of the grade appropriate age (not 13 year olds in the 4th grade).  Then whites got slots in the magnet schools based on race/academic scores allowed smarter whites a chance to save money on private school for their children.  If you do not qualify then the white tax of sending your kids to private school is a must.  The racial scorekeeping in Chicago would make Strom Thurmond blush in its exactitude, of course putting to rest the notion that race does not exist.</p>

		<p>Poster #17 mentions the &lsquo;dream&rsquo; of our liberal elites, ensconced in government as they are. They really do have this vision of a multicultural, multiracial wonderland where &lsquo;diverse&rsquo; cultures meet, mingle and myscegenate to create a paradise of social justice. This sounds simplistic, but it is their basic vision.&#8221;<br>
Jay</p>
<p>  Jay, this is exactly what most of our privileged elites believe. The &#8220;great liberal dream&#8221; is the elimination of racism through miscegenation. If everyone is part of everything (multi-racial), then no one can exclude anybody. Obviously, the liberals have never looked at racially mixed countries like Brazil, Dominican Republic, Mexico, etc. and asked themselves if these countries are really the utopias of racial harmony and progress they imagine. If anything, racially mixed countries have a more rigid continuum of color (lighter skin equals higher status) than even the United States.</p>

		<p><i>The schools there were subject to busing pursuant to a court order. <b>&ldquo;The White kids started learning all the black kids&rsquo; bad habits,&rdquo; </b> my friend said ruefully.</i></p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>This seems to be the pattern universally. Isn&rsquo;t it obvious?  Can&rsquo;t anyone see it?</p>
<p>This is been going on now for decades.  The white kids get dragged down to the lower standard.  The black kids DON&rsquo;T get lifted up to a higher standard.  As Jim said above, you end up with White boys who wear baggy pants and speak Ebonics, and  White girls who bring home brown babies for their parents to raise.   Exactly!</p>
<p>The bad apple, if not removed from the barrel, spoils the whole bunch. The good apples do not make the bad one good.  This seems to be a sociological equivalent of Gresham&rsquo;s Law:   Bad money drives out good. (Unfortunately, good money doesn&rsquo;t drive out bad.)</p>
<p>Why can none of these busybody social engineers see this?  Because it&rsquo;s un-PC?  Because someone might be offended?</p>

		<p>I can name one place where &#8220;minorities&#8221; do better than &#8220;whites&#8221; and the &#8220;minorities&#8221; have much higher test scores and behavior than the &#8220;whites&#8221;. The school is 90 percent &#8220;minority&#8221; and 10 percent &#8220;white&#8221; but has the highest test scores in California. If you google, &#8220;Faria School in Cupertino&#8221;, you will have the solution to reversing the minority problem. Import the right &#8220;minorities&#8221; and they will bring whites up rather than drop them down.</p>

<p>The school is only 10% white?   Was it ALWAYS that way? <br>
It would seem to me that rather than pulling the whites UP, they will drive them OUT.</p>
<p>I have a better idea: why import ANY minorities at all?  Before we started all this minority obsession, we didn&rsquo;t need anyone to &#8220;pull us up&#8221;.  We were doing just fine by ourselves.</p>

		<p>Apparently, someone decided that the white children of Eden Prairie need to learn the joys of being randomly punched in the face for being white and then being called racist if they complain about it.</p>
<p>Sending your white child to a school with more than 1% blacks in it is tantamount to child abuse.  The blacks are racist, and will take advantage of any situation they can to physically abuse whites and rob them. </p>

		<p>I have a friend who lives in this upscale suburb (Eden Prairie- EP) in the Twin Cities. Their taxes are among the HIGHEST in the whole of Hennepin County,  (e.g. $5000 per year, for a 3000-sq.ft home) and Hennepin is one of the most &#8216;tax-heavy&rsquo; counties of the state: it is also the most LIBERAL/Democratic counties in the state.</p>
<p> Proof of that fact? Keith Ellison (Black Catholic turned MUSLIM) counts large numbers of inner-city Blacks and Somalis, as well as the predominantly Jewish &#8216;St. Louis Park&rsquo; as his voting bloc. Bizarrely enough, it is also one of the largest homosexual populations after Seattle, which is like #3, after San Francisco, and Los Angeles (or is it New York) so you KNOW the area is both a) liberal and b) &#8216;diverse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>EP also has a VERY upscale area known as &#8216;Bear Path,&rsquo; where Million dollar homes are not unusual. It is probably there, where the &#8216;parents fear the loss of neighborhood K-4 schools.&rsquo; They don&rsquo;t fear the loss of local schools. They FEAR THE NON-WHITE BEING BUSSED IN! And now they&rsquo;re going to have to move FARTHER OUT, to &#8216;escape the horde.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always said, &#8216;The rich can always afford their own apartheid.&rsquo; This is merely Minnesota &#8216;Nice&rsquo; backfiring in their own faces. If this is established as protocol, property values will plummet in EP making it another Richfield, with just bigger footprints, but the same drugs,crime, and lower educational scores.</p>
<p>And to think, Edina (a neighboring suburb that is older) was one of the first suburbs in the USA to have a &#8216;non-whites may not buy or live in our city&rsquo; in their real estate contracts, back when sanity prevailed in the USA. Minnesota&rsquo;s urban landscape is getting darker (literally) all the time. It&rsquo;s not just Camden and Brooklyn Center anymore, folks!</p>

		<p>If the White man hadn&rsquo;t granted suffrage to his servants and traitorous women only to have a Red Marxist government foisted upon him, still had pride in himself and put half as much effort into his children as the Asians do with their shame and guilt, the White man would be standing on Mars, he&rsquo;d still be building things in his own country and the Asians would still be doing his laundry and gardening.  </p>
<p>He also wouldn&rsquo;t have to hear stories about schools in Cupertino where the median income is nearly $120,000 in a town of 50,000 and 95% of the population comes from a racial group with a median IQ over 100 yet more than half of those get government affirmative action benefits in employment and education because of an arbitrary designation of &#8220;minority&#8221; status that is not earned or deserved.  </p>

		<p>The more racially aware parents (probably a very small percentage) will remove their kids immediately from the public school system. For the rest of the parents who have bought into the indoctrination that all races are the same it will take them longer to figure out what has been done to their kids. Hopefully they wise up and their kids don&rsquo;t lose more than a year or two to this experiment. what will happen is that behavior will begin to ghettoize and acheivement levels will drop off. Since classroom materials will have to be dumbed down to the lowest common denominator some kids will get bored and act up. Not to mention the kids chosen for long bus rides will have an hour or more on the bus every day making them tired and less able to interact with family or do homework. I went to a highly regarded magnet school in 9th grade. Due to the location of the school my parents wanted me to take the bus- which was about an hour and a half each way. After a few weeks they noticed my work slipping and started driving me- still a long drive and out of the question for working parents. After looking at the school and programs offered other schools offered the same things but did not cater to black students for social functions. Bottom line it is better to make the sacrifices and home school or put you kids in a decent private school.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m delighted to see this happening in the North, especially that leftist, pro-miscegenation state of Minnesota.  I hope their daughters come home with brown babies, their sons come home with drug problems, their property values plummet, their schools become a business opportunity for drug dealers, and mostly I hope they witness crime and violence perpetrated on their children and themselves daily.  That has been life in the South since the federal government by way of federal judges took control of all school systems in the South.  These unelected judges imposed integration on an occupied people and oversaw the destruction of public education.  </p>

And it&rsquo;s no mere accident. This isn&rsquo;t just coming from out of the blue. All of this is being coordinated by people who have an agenda and know what they are doing. The problem is that our people are confused while they are organized. They have an agenda, and we don&rsquo;t. </p>
<p>In fact, our people are almost as confused and disorganized as the blacks are. And that&rsquo;s our weakness.</p>
