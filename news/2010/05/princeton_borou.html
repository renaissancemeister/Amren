<h1><a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/05/princeton_allows_illegal_immig.html">Princeton Borough, Township Allow Illegal Immigrants to Get Community Identification Cards</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeff Diamant, Star-Ledger (Newark), May 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yesterday, Princeton Borough and Princeton Township became the state&rsquo;s third and fourth municipalities where residents can obtain community identification cards that will be accepted at many local agencies and establishments even if the residents are in the United States illegally.</p>
<p>The cards  &mdash;  available to any Princeton resident wanting a first or second form of photo ID  &mdash;  are being distributed by the Latin American Legal Defense and Education Fund. The Hispanic advocacy group, based in the borough, plans to give out the cards each yesterday morning to anybody who has a passport from any country or other ID and also has documents such as utility bills or tax bills that show the person lives in Princeton.</p>
<p>While the cards  &mdash;  valid only in Princeton  &mdash;  are not an official government form of ID, the Princeton police departments and the Mercer County sheriff&rsquo;s and prosecutor&rsquo;s offices have endorsed their use.</p>
<p>Still, such cards remain controversial, especially following last month&rsquo;s passage of a law in Arizona mandating that immigrants carry ID and requiring police to check the immigration status of detainees they suspect of being in the country illegally. National legislative efforts to give illegal immigrants ways to remain legally in the United States have stalled.</p>
<p>Proponents of the Princeton ID cards say the cards, which cost $10 for adults and $5 for minors, will make life easier for illegal immigrants who, ineligible for driver&rsquo;s licenses, struggle to get basic services even though they work and pay taxes in New Jersey.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think this card is useful to anybody, but specifically for those who are the most marginalized,&#8221; said Maria Juega, treasurer of the Latin American Legal Defense and Education Fund. &#8220;Our intent is to decrease that level of marginalization and make sure that everyone in our community has access to health care, police services and emergency medical services.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds like Princeton is basically setting up its own immigration policy separate from the United States,&#8221; said Gayle Kesselman, who co-chairs New Jersey Citizens for Immigration Control. &#8220;They may think they have a wonderful motive doing what they&rsquo;re doing, the good people of Princeton, but they&rsquo;re just encouraging something that should not be encouraged.&#8221;</p>
<p>Similar cards have been available in Asbury Park since 2008 and Trenton since last year. Different versions are available in a handful of other cities, including San Francisco and New Haven, Conn.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear what the demand will be for the cards. Wilkes estimated Princeton has 900 residents of Latin American descent, many in the country illegally, {snip}</p>
<p>Wilkes said he had expected a less enthusiastic response, figuring illegal immigrants wouldn&rsquo;t want to do anything that might bring attention to them. But the Latin American Legal Defense and Education Fund  &mdash;  or LALDEF, founded in 2004  &mdash;  is respected in the community, and, Wilkes noted, police in New Jersey are not allowed to investigate suspects&rsquo; immigration status unless the suspects are charged with a felony or drunken driving.<br>

		<p>The unfortunate truth of the matter is that many illegal aliens are registered to vote and do get drivers licenses.  If they were such great taxpayers, why should they need these city ID cards to get the services which illegal alien advocates claim they don&rsquo;t need?</p>

<p>Pay taxes? Most are paid under the table and send their money home yet don&rsquo;t hestitate to get free medical care at the emergency room, use fraudulent ID, cost money when they are arrested and jailed and have anchor babies and then enroll them in all kinds of welfare services. They take far more than they give. However, go ahead Princton, you&rsquo;ll be inundated with them and they&rsquo;ll leave places like Arizona.</p>

<p><br>
Yes&hellip;..as a means of identifying criminals, finding and seizing their assets and jailing them, lol.</p>
<p>The truth about immigrants in New Jersey.  They aren&rsquo;t welcome and are borderline not allowed out of their little areas.  Outside the &#8220;bad&#8221; parts of New Jersey, these guys stick out like a sore thumb&hellip;..and the cops hassle them.</p>
<p>Even that is about to change.  New Jersey is on the cusp of putting into office a whole bunch of anti-liberals to support Christie.  Next year, we&rsquo;ll be like arizona.</p>

		<p>The whole town is not lost to Mexicans, just the black area. I remember reading an article several years ago of a 90 year old black resident commenting on the loud music emitting from the new Mexican households.The adjacent Community Park, once a collection of baseball fields are now soccer fields.</p>

		<p>The ID cards will make &#8220;life easier for the illegals&#8221; Why in God&rsquo;s name would they want to make life any easier? They are given free run of this country with all sorts of benefits when they don&rsquo;t even BELONG here! What is going on in this country? I am sure that if the same idiots who are responsible for this insanity had been around on Dec. 7, 1941, they would have invited the Japanese to tea after their run on Pearl Harbor! </p>

		<p>Princeton Borough&rsquo;s historically black part of town, namely the few square blocks from Witherspoon St. to Rt. 206, has been transformed into a litter-strewn, crime-ridden enclave of third-worlders who don&rsquo;t speak English. Princeton will become a sanctuary city, consisting of wealthy snobs and the legions of illegals who service their lawns&hellip; </p>

		<p>I personally know Princeton Police Commissioner, Kevin Wilkes. He is a very nice guy, who knows about his architecture. He is also involved with his local community.</p>
<p>I have mixed feelings about the communiy ID cards. Mr. Wilkes brought up an excellent point about identifying victims of violent crime. And, it could ironically help crack down on illegal immigration, if more of the politicians had the right intentions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I am also worried the cards will be used to benefit illegals. I also do not think it is appropriate for a Hispanic Nationalist organization to directly distribute Government Identification Cards.</p>

		<p>Illegals already have Mexican government issued picture ID cards that are recognized as valid ID by American collaborators and Quislings.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the &#8216;Matricula Consular&rsquo; card and it has been around for awhile: </p>
