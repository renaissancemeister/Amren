			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dave Gibson, Norfolk Examiner, April 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On Wednesday, the man believed to be responsible for an attack on a disabled woman, William Douglas, 25, turned himself into Hampton police.</p>
<p>Around 11:15 p.m, on Friday, April 16, Douglas allegedly followed 59-year-old Sylvia Hollingsworth out of a 7-Eleven at the corner of North King Street and Rip Rap Road in Hampton.</p>
<p>As she got into her car, he attacked her.</p>
<p>According to the police report, he punched the woman in the face, neck and arms and repeatedly slammed her legs with the car door. Throughout the ordeal, the woman was subjected to a tirade of racist profanity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The victim told WVEC 13 News: &#8220;Never once did he try to take my keys. Never once did he ask or try to take my pocketbook or any money. He was just out to hurt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hollingsworth continued: &#8220;It leaves me hurt, and I feel like I&rsquo;m a victim of a hate crime. Just in his own words, he hated whites and he was going to kill my &#8216;f  &mdash;  ing&rsquo; white ass, as he put it, and that&rsquo;s what he was trying to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hollingsworth, who walks with a cane, is still recovering from the attack.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite the evidence pointing to a racially motivated attack, Douglas has not been charged with a hate crime.</p>

		<p>I know it&rsquo;s redundant to point out that if the races had been reversed, the &#8220;authorities&#8221; would have no trouble whatever finding &#8220;hate.&#8221;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s <i>really</i> interesting about this is that someone in the media actually had the temerity to point out the hypocrisy.  The lid is rattling as the pot begins to boil&hellip;<br/>

		<p>Blacks suffer from genetics (e.g. low IQ) and self-inflicted social pathologies. Yet for generations, black leaders - educators, politicians, clergymen, and activists - have told their followers that whites are to blame for all the woes which fill black lives. So, sad episodes like this one are to be expected.<br/>
I hope all whites learn a lesson from this story: AVOID ALL CONTACT WITH BLACKS! AVOID THEM LIKE THE PLAGUE!<br/>

		<p>FBI Hate Crime statistics routinely claim about 75% of race-based &#8220;hate&#8221; crimes are white-on-black.  Stories like this explain why.  Law enforcement simply refuses to call it what it is.</p>

		<p>He hasn&rsquo;t been charged with a hate crime because for decades Republicans and Conservatives have struck a deal with the Left, a gentleman&rsquo;s agreement if you will,  to never mention the tidal wave of non-white on white violence, to never mention its political nature,  in order to not antagonize those who are sponsoring it so that they, the Republicans and Conservatives,  get a chance to strike deals for their Wall Street clients with the sponsors of this violence.   </p>

		<p>Most blacks have never been hurt by whites and so have no reason to hate whites.</p>
<p>But the schools and the media indocrinate blacks to hate white people.  </p>
<p>So you have the phenomena of blacks who have never been wronged attacking whites who have never wronged them, and feeling justified in doing so.</p>
<p>They are abetted by prosecutors who treat them with kid gloves. </p>

		<p>And to think, some fellow Whites still look at many of us who are highly critical of Law Enforcement and their obscene complicity in the anti-White bias of the government at large, with a jaundiced eye. Many of the LAWS of this country target and harm only Whites, and thus Law Enforcement must necessarily be against us as well. Sure many individual officers may feel differently - but they still agree to play by and enforce the rules of those who hate us and wish us naught but harm. It is sad but it is true.  </p>

		<p>Nothing new for Virginia.</p>
<p> A while back I read how University of Virginia White law students wanted to repeal Virginia&rsquo;s &ldquo;hate crime&rdquo; law, since it was applied only to Whites, as Black gangs using anti-White tirades continuously attacked outnumbered White students</p>
<p>After catching some of the gang members, the police refused to charge them with a hate crime.</p>
<p>The last I heard the students were suing the police. I wish them luck.</p>
<p>Needless to say, guns are forbidden students on campus, even those over 21 and who have a concealed handgun permit.<br/>

		<p>What is amazing is how the left can claim that there is a White Power Structure and &#8220;institutional racism&#8221; when the USA is replete with cases such as this. The law is applied according to a double standard in which White victims do not get equal protection from &#8220;hate crimes.&#8221; </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also interesting that a major complaint of black activists is that blacks are &#8220;over-represented&#8221; in prison, supposedly proving that law enforcement is biased against them. Yet we have numerous incidents in which Whites can be charged with &#8220;hate crimes,&#8221; but not blacks. You&rsquo;d think that someone would make a civil liberties case out of this, but of course, we can see that White people are somewhat on the order of second class citizens insofar as such things as equal protection under the law are concerned.</p>
<p>The situation is not unlike that in the new South Africa. But at least in new SA, Whites are in the minority. What is bizarre in the USA is how Whites are treated as if they are a despised minority when they still are the majority.</p>

		<p>No surprise here.  Any one with half a brain who looks at the ridicoulsy high black cirme and who are the object of most of their crimes, would realize that an undeclared and disorganized race war has been going on for years against whites.  Forget trying to make nice to these people, they will always hate us no matter what we do or don&rsquo;t do, because at some level they<br/>
recognize their own intellectual and capability shortcomings. It&rsquo;s just too bad that we can&rsquo;t make idiotic, guilt-ridden, none racially conscious whites live in a black hellhole for at least a year, so they would find out what blacks are truly like.  I was<br/>
stationed in the Hampton Roads area in the 1980&rsquo;s,  and it was<br/>
even bad then thanks to the doings of the glorious black race.</p>

		<p>Social and political activists created &#8220;hate crime&#8221; and &#8220;hate speech&#8221; laws and codes for the purpose of elevating &#8220;people of color&#8221; against whites, so anyone who is surprised by the double standard in the application of the laws and codes is willfully blind or woefully naive. At this point, though, the double standard is <i>so</i> obvious that no one has any excuse for not being painfully aware of it. </p>

		<p>Berkely, it&rsquo;s the same trend it&rsquo;s always been.  Blacks are, by and large, cowardly.  Hence, a solitary black will pick what he thinks is a helpless victim - the aged, the infirm, the retarded, girls.  A black alone will rarely pick a fight or try to victimize another young, fit, aware male.  If blacks want to target a white male alone, who could reasonably expect to exact as much harm as given, they engage in the &#8220;swarm&#8221; tactic where a number of them jump the guy.  And, blacks being blacks, if the guy STILL manages to defend himself relatively successfully, black bystanders will jump in and &#8220;help&#8221;.  Writ large, it&rsquo;s what the new phenomenon of &#8220;spontaneous&#8221; cell phone instigated, mass mobs swarming a usually White, prosperous, downtown area is all about.  And it will get worse.  As long as we allow it to.  They are getting bolder, more murderous, AND more organized.  It&rsquo;s about time WE did also.  It&rsquo;s the ONLY thing they know, the ONLY thing they respect, and the ONLY thing ever known to keep them under control.</p>

		<p>This story appeared in the Daily Press over the weekend.  The paper initially did not identify the race of the perp, but it did not take much to figure it out when the story read that he told the victim he hated White people.  At least he was honest.</p>
<p>Two days later before they captured the thug, in the &#8216;Letters to the Editor&rsquo; section, someone did comment on why the Daily Press neglected to identify the race.  Usually, the canned answer is either it&rsquo;s unknown or too generic (doesn&rsquo;t help so it&rsquo;s not needed).  However in this case, the editor&rsquo;s response did ID the race explaining that it was just an oversight.</p>
<p>Anyone that does not see that there is a conscious effort to hide the race of a violent criminal, unless of course the criminal or suspect is White, is a blind fool. Kinda like the SUV bomber in NY until they found out that was not the case.  In a sane society, we would not only know the race of the perp but that of the victim as well.  </p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s on fire and every White needs to realize there is a bullseye painted on his/her forehead.  It&rsquo;s going to get much worse before it gets better.</p>
