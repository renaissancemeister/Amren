<h1>Is Dora the Explorer an Illegal Immigrant?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sophia Tareen, Google News, May 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In her police mug shot, the doe-eyed cartoon heroine with the bowl haircut has a black eye, battered lip and bloody nose.</p>
<p>Dora the Explorer&rsquo;s alleged crime? &#8220;Illegal Border Crossing Resisting Arrest.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctored picture, one of several circulating widely in the aftermath of Arizona&rsquo;s controversial new immigration law, may seem harmless, ridiculous or even tasteless.</p>
<p>But experts say the pictures and the rhetoric surrounding them online, in newspapers and at public rallies, reveal some Americans&rsquo; attitudes about race, immigrants and where some of immigration reform debate may be headed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dora is kind of like a blank screen onto which people can project their thoughts and feelings about Latinos,&#8221; said Erynn Masi de Casanova, a sociology professor at the University of Cincinnati. &#8220;They feel like they can say negative things because she&rsquo;s only a cartoon character.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Dora&rsquo;s case, especially because her image is so widely available, she&rsquo;s an easy target as discussion ramps up on how lawmakers should address the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants living in the United States.</p>
<p>For about a decade, the pint-sized Latina character has taught millions of children the English alphabet, colors and Spanish phrases on a Nickelodeon TV show and through a global empire. Her smiling cherub face is plastered on everything from backpacks to T-shirts to fruit snacks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Several websites, including The Huffington Post, have narrated Dora&rsquo;s mock capture by immigration authorities. One picture circulating on Facebook shows an ad for a TV show called &#8220;Dora the Illegal Immigrant.&#8221; On the Facebook page &#8220;Dora the Explorer is soo an Illegal Immigrant,&#8221; there are several images showing her sailing through the air over the U.S.-Mexican border.</p>
<p>Many of the Dora images assume the Latina character is an illegal immigrant from Mexico.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Representatives from Nickelodeon declined to comment on Dora&rsquo;s background, and her place of birth or citizenship have never been clear.&#8221; She has brown skin, dark hair and some experts who have studied the show say she speaks Spanish with an American accent.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&rsquo;s always been ambiguously constructed,&#8221; said Angharad Valdivia, who teaches media studies at the University of Illinois and has explored the issue. &#8220;In the U.S. the way we understand race is about putting people in categories and we&rsquo;re uncomfortable with people we can&rsquo;t put into categories.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dora lives in an unidentified location with pyramids that suggest Mexico, but also tropical elements such as palm trees and her friends, Isa the iguana and Boots the monkey. Does that mean she&rsquo;s from South America or Florida?</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s oak trees and her fox nemesis Swiper, which are more common to the American Midwest.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many immigrant families, particularly Latinos, see Dora as a symbol of freedom, someone to relate to. She&rsquo;s a young girl with brown skin who lives in a borderless world and can travel anywhere she wants without consequence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the same time, Guidotti-Hernandez says the ambiguity and negative imagery makes Dora susceptible to being used by those who support the Arizona law.</p>

<p>Sure, Dora should try going to North Korea or China and let&rsquo;s see how well she is treated. A black eye would be nothing.</p>
<p>This attitude of &#8220;Latinos&#8221;, that they think they can just walk into any country in the world &#8220;without consequence&#8221; is just infuriating in its arrogance!</p>

		<p>Oh, c&rsquo;mon Google News.  Dora is a cartoon.  </p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re going to fool around with juvenile fluff, then maybe we should start debating whether The Great Cornholio was an illegal alien, as he was mistaken to be on one episode of that certain MTV cartoon series from the 1990s.</p>

		<p>Although I do not allow my daughter to watch Dora I think that the picture is a bit silly. Any agent who did this to a child (as Dora is supposed to represent) would and should be jailed. More to the point, I think that shows like Dora and the new show with the Chinese character (I cannot remember her name) are literally programming young children to accept Spanish and Chinese invaders. I know that this sounds silly but witness all of the other shows where the evil White man is the cause of all of the problems. </p>

		<p>Its pretty barbaric to show a little girl, even a cartoon, beaten up like that.</p>
<p>But the article mentions comething that got me thinking about reverse rascism:<br>
&#8220;Then there&rsquo;s oak trees and her fox nemesis Swiper, which are more common to the American Midwest.&#8221;</p>
<p>It sounds as if the creators have some well-hidden anti-white rascism on their agenda. Swiper (who is always stealing things from poor, Hispanic Dora&hellip;) actually IS the only white character on the show, and in fact I think even the Christmas episode featured a brown Santa.</p>

		<p>This is completely made up propaganda.  Can a single one of you say honestly that you saw this before Amren brought the article to your attention?</p>
<p>The grain of truth in the article is that the US is turning anti-immigrant, on the cusp of militant.  However, that sentiment is just and directed at violent criminals who mean the people in the US harm. Nobody (except blacks&hellip;.cough) directs those attitudes toward non-criminals.</p>
<p>The issue the article is covering up, is most of these people ARE in fact, violent criminals.  This article would have people believe that mexicans are like loveable, iconic Dora, being victimized by violent racists&hellip;.when the truth is almost the mirror image.  Mexicans are NOTHING like Dora.  They are the ones being violent and who hold ultra-racist views&hellip;.against us.  The person with the black eye isn&rsquo;t Dora and didn&rsquo;t get it while &#8220;resisting arrest&#8221; for an immigration offense.  The reality is a defenseless white person targeted because of their race&hellip;.and a violent freak from mexico arrested for beating/raping/killing them.</p>
<p>They may or may not be deported.  If deported, they will probably walk right back over the border and right back onto the welfare rolls&hellip;..and right back onto the street corner selling drugs.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is Americans aren&rsquo;t fooled anymore.  The most common response to this article will be, hmmm, I didn&rsquo;t see anything like that Dora picture&hellip;.anywhere.  What are they trying to pull&hellip;.followed by some acknowledgement of what mexicans are really like.</p>

		<p>8:07 I actually did see the picture before seeing it here but by not much more than an hour or so. I do think that you are right that a picture of a child beaten up is barbaric, even if it is a pen and ink drawing and it is just feeding the frenzy that those of us who are against illegal alien invaders are cruel people who would even hurt children. </p>

<p>There&rsquo;s that reference again to &#8220;a borderless world&#8221; that they keep slipping across on us, almost unobtrusively, until we get used to it.  </p>
<p>Let me ask, though, why that &#8220;borderless world&#8221; seems to apply only (and tacitly) to OUR borders. The Hispanic countries also have borders, which are enforced very strictly, but they don&rsquo;t seem to have any objection to that. Nobody is complaining about the borders of Peru, Venezuela, or Guatemala.   It&rsquo;s OUR borders that they want to dismantle, not theirs.</p>

		<p>Do liberals who advocate open borders actually think it would have a good effect or no effect on the nation?  Don&rsquo;t they care that social welfare organizations will be overwhelmed, crime will rise, and that schools and hospitals will have to close?  Taxes and the costs of security will soar.  Rich liberals will have to fight their way through hoards to enter their gated communities and walled-off office buildings.  Even grocery shopping will become a risky undertaking.  <br>
It&rsquo;s amazing to me that around 4/5 of American Hispanics favor this kind of crazy rhetoric.  They must be confronted with the same crime and infrastructure depletion as any other citizen, and, in many cases, they&rsquo;re probably feeling the brunt of it.<br>
There&rsquo;s a big difference between a path to citizenship, guest workers, and open borders.  </p>

Dora is just a cartoon but Jordin Paulder was a real 9 year old American boy who was murdered by a Honduran illegal alien.  Jordin was murdered in a most violent and heinous way.  He was hit in the face with a hatchet.  </p>
<p>This should have been national news but it was suppressed and could only be found in the Georgia news and on the internet.  Pravda and Tass have nothing on the American media.</p>

		<p>We as white racial realists or white nationalists, must come together about something. We must decide, if the white race is worth saving; we must end our esoteric ideological squabbling and work for that until the situation has improved. I think our race is worth saving, how about you?</p>
<p>Look, we are in a crisis, and we exacerbate it by not focusing on the basics!</p>
<p>We have got to concentrate on preserving the declining (65% to 62%) white majority in the USA; or better still, reversing that sorry trend back toward 75% to 85% without regret or apology. We have every right to do this, and any who say otherwise, should be subjected to the harshest consequences. Such as being enthusiastically encouraged to &ldquo;emigrate to Zimbabwe or Cuba. </p>

		<p>Actually, I recall some years ago  &mdash;  at least two or three  &mdash;  a Web comment that suggested this same exact premise!  &mdash;  cute little Dora <i>does</i> seem suspiciously &#8216;undocumented&rsquo;. (As a reminder, more honest words would be &#8216;guilty of willful criminal trespass&rsquo;, probably multiple counts.)</p>
<p>I think the poster listed several contributing factors: &#8216;Latina&rsquo;-looking (mestizo, actually)? Check! Spanish-speaking with little or no English proficiency? Check! Backpack to stow personal effects while crossing pesky deserts, rivers, fences, walls, etc? Check!</p>
<p>Ever since, I&rsquo;ve thought &#8216;illegal&rsquo; whenever I see the character.</p>

<p>Oh please&hellip; The injustice towards these brown peoples is just too much to bear! I suppose to rectify this we should just let in as many as want to come to this country especially since Whites are already allowed to travel, for any reason, wherever they want in those brown peoples&rsquo; countries without consequence.</p>
<p>Although, how about the Whites in the US that can&rsquo;t even travel in many public areas of their own country &#8220;without consequence&#8221; due to &#8220;many immigrant families, particularly Latinos&#8221; living there in their neighborhood-sized colony?

		<p>Here in Vancouver, WA a section is known as the immigrant area.  A video store there has some traditionally white European characters like Pinochio and Snow White shown with unmistakably brown complexions.  Dora and many other commercial presentations are simply an extension of the multicultural/pro miscegenation propaganda hammering whites everyday. You know they aim at children too. The recent program on CNN that worries about the racial bias of children is a new high in the attempt of some to influence thinking and interlope into parenting of children.</p>

<p>Indeed!</p>
<p>I agree with all those above who contend that this doctored photo of Dora, is clearly the work of Reds and other idiots who wish to insinuate that this is where our so-called immigration policy toward &ldquo;undocumented migrants&rdquo; is heading. It is meant to humiliate and degrade white people into falsely thinking that the: pedophiles, drunks, drug dealers, and murderers that Mexico sends us, are just misunderstood and benign diversity and enrichment &ldquo;educators&rdquo; for our country and children.  </p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t they show Dora 10 years from now? That is, show her as she would really be, in reality; an entitlement seeking octo-mom and living off our tax dollars, while carousing with Isa and Boots in her spare time. </p>
<p>I guess, that would be a little too close to el casa for comfort?</p>

<p>As always, God help us all!&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; I agree with you on this, and I have said it myself very often in different ways for years via Amren posts.  Perhaps we could start the end of idealogical squabbling by not invoking God or Christianity in or at the end of every post?  Does it have to be your way or no way?</p>
<p>The classic history by Gibbons reports that in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, Christians were more harsh towards one another, due to idealogical squables than the then Pagan Roman government was on any of them.  After the fourth century this continued as heretics were hunted down by the Christian institutions and destroyed for the next 1,000 years at least.  This is not to mention the wars between Catholicism and Protestantism that ravaged Europe for a couple hundred years.</p>
<p>What good will it do to put off the internal wars over idealogy if we will simply resume them after we &#8220;gain back&#8221; some sort of majority?</p>
<p>Because of this dilema, which I am very conscious of, I often propose that those in need of religion reject all this Christian harshness and frank sellout of the notion of racial/ethnic identity and go with some of the Neo-Pagan ideas that already exist out there in the white world.  It is an underground, pretty much, but it is more relavant to whites because it is genuinely of European origin, whereas Christianity is all about middle-eastern religion and cosmology with a little polytheism thrown in by Paul and Catholicism.  But even Orthodoxy is polytheistic as all Christianity really is, if you really define it.  My point is that by centering on real European heritage as it was before it was conquered by Pagan Rome and then Christian Rome, we might find our real heart, our &#8220;tribal memories.&#8221;  Christianity destroys tribal memory and our once beautiful connection to our land.  This is how whites were first disenfranchised and hitched to a plow that still enriches the church, but leaves its members so empty that only daily, psychotic like repetition of its dogmas can perpetuate it. Anything that unnatural must lead to disaster.  And it always has.  I watched a documentary on WW1 the other night and noted how Germany as well as everyone else was invoking God as they went out to fight their fellow whites.  Think about it.</p>
<p>IMO, the only religion for whites is one where ancestors are acknowledged and venerated. </p>

		<p>This falls into the Bambi syndrome, where cartoon characters are made to seem human, a clever ploy used for years by the left to turn the undiscerning populace against anything they deem unsuitable in their sight. I have always wondered why the right hasn&rsquo;t spun this to their advantage.

		<p> If Dora had shown her drivers license, passport,or any accepted proof of legal status-she will be ok,but if she is illeagle then she would have to go back to where ever she is from,and try and enter US legally. If she is from mexico-she should be willing to accept the consequences,as mexican law requires mexico to act in similar situation.Dora just might be one of those Anchor babies.I hope so,as all my grand children have Dora as one of their icons. I suspect she is a decendant of the SPANISH conquistadores which fled the inquisition in mexico city,and settled way up north in Colorado..Perhaps her ancestors were penitentes..I can assure you this-If she is then she and all her people are dead set against illeagles from mexico..<br>
  This picture is a bad example of propaganda from the la raza&hellip;</p>
