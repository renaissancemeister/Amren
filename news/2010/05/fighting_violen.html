<h1>Fighting Violent Gangs in Newburgh, NY</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Douglas Kennedy, Fox News, May 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Newburgh, New York once one of the prettiest river towns on the Hudson, is now home to the highest violent crime rate in New York state. Earlier this month the town was the scene of one of the largest gang bust on the east coast. &#8220;We have brought federal narcotics charges against 78 members and associates of 2 notorious national gangs,&#8221; told U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Valentine also blames the federal government&rsquo;s urban renewal project in the 1970&rsquo;s which demolished homes and then failed to rebuild in the area. He credits the government for at least getting involved with law enforcement. He says the May gang bust was the first step in getting his city back on track.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If the government is able to provide the monetary funds to support Newburgh then it seems there is hope in bringing this beautiful river town back to life.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been all through New York State and, if there is a nice small or mid-sized city in that dilapidated, socialist mess, I&rsquo;ve never seen it.  You can tell all those towns were prosperous, nice places to live around the turn of the last century and possibly up to the 1920&rsquo;s.  At the very latest, there has been no prosperity in that part of the country since the 1950&rsquo;s and, the closer you get to NYC, Albany, or Buffalo, the more the towns look like Newburgh.  Cops everywhere, too  &mdash;  to bad they&rsquo;re all sitting on the highways with lasers, trying to bust you for speeding.  Whenever I think of where this country is headed, I think of New York State.</p>

		<p>Over twenty years ago now, driving on the interstate just north of Newburgh, headed from Mass. to Chi. Seen Newburgh for myself. Curious in a way I should not have been, knowing the history of the place.</p>
<p>Newburgh during the Gilded Age was an impressive place, noted for the many summer residences of the rich and famous from NYC.</p>
<p>NOW Newburgh is not for the rich and famous! Boarded stores and residences line the main street. NOT a place you want to visit. Very delapidated and run down. NO more steam boats bringing weekenders to Newburgh from NYC now.</p>

		<p>A reply to &#8220;One of Odin&rsquo;s Ravens&#8221;:</p>
<p>You are largely right: the North is reaping the fruits of its sanctimoniousness of a century and a half ago.<br>
The liberals have for a long time used the exception to make a general rule. For example, forty years ago, there were 55,000 illegal abortions a year in this country. To eliminate that problem, abortion was legalized, and now there are over 1.5 million a year.<br>
In the same way, liberals seized upon the example of the very small percentage of blacks who are intelligent, decent people and used that to get rid of all legal discrimination against blacks. White Southerners, with their long personal history of living day-to-day with the black race, warned against this, to no avail. <br>
In the long run, the South won the argument.<br>
In the long run, the South won the War.   </p>

		<p>The idea originally was that if you could just get them away from the corrupting influence of the big cities, and relocate them out in these nice little American towns, that would cure their propensity to crime, anti-social conduct, and violence.</p>
<p>Apparently, that didn&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p>I live in NY City, but knowing nothing about Newburgh, I checked.   </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s   33% black, 36% &#8220;Latino&#8221; (meaning in this case Dominican or Puerto Rican),  and only  42% white. </p>
<p>Well, that tells the whole story.</p>

<p>It is true that there are some downtrodden places in NY State but having lived in Western NY for the past 10 months I have been surprised at the number of very nice little towns along the lines of the ones you imagined might have existed a century or so ago.  They are still here.</p>

		<p>If you go to Newburgh NY, you will see pregnant Central Americans all over the place. Unbelievable. This is the home of West Point. What exactly is the US military defending us against? Invade the World;invite the World. America is becoming a joke nation. If the US military had its way, it would enlist all the Central American gang bangers and potential gang bangers.</p>

		<p>Once beautiful NYS. Washington&rsquo;s headquarters were in Newburgh. Went to go see it as a kid, I think on our way up to Cooperstown or Lake George, on one of those many cheap but great vacations my family would take in the summer to get out of the city. Can&rsquo;t bear driving through it these days. Something&rsquo;s got to give. </p>
<p>&#8220;Attention yankees: The South didn&rsquo;t keep slaves because it enjoyed being surrounded by blacks. We knew what would happened if they were free. Now you do too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Are you kidding me? If the south wasn&rsquo;t so addicted to black slaves to begin with (giving poor white sharecroppers the shaft, BTW. Yeah, real racial solidarity, that) there would be no self-righteous abolitionists in the north (almost all exclusively from the upper classes). Do you think the NYC draft riots were overflowing with love for the black slave? Do you think that those of us in the outer boroughs back when I was growing up (&rsquo;60s) were just thrilled when they started putting up section 8 housing and couldn&rsquo;t wait to welcome our new neighbors? Why do you think the propagandist Norman Lear set &#8216;All in the Family&rsquo; in Queens? He knew who he was targeting. Also, since the &rsquo;80s the great majority of the libs in the northeast came from somewhere else, with the great wave of yuppies that poured in. Lots of lib neo-abolitionists (anti-racists) from the south, too. Imagine that.</p>
<p>You southern boys should get off your high-horse and keep your eye on the ball. You&rsquo;re all getting overrun, too. We here in the northeast don&rsquo;t need lessons from you as to how bad this whole thing is. The historical reasons for the current political alignment are complex and the last thing White people need are these old regional conflicts cropping up to divide us (not unlike the specious Nord/Med split some keep harping on). The stakes are the ultimate.</p>

<p> - - To #7 -</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t regressed.  In days gone by We - Whites - set the standards FOR THEM.  They attempted to emulate us because we were in charge, which is as it should be.  Today, 2010, the media has White kids dressing, speaking, and acting like Blacks.  Blacks are allowed now to &#8220;do their own thing&#8221;.  If they were allowed at that time to do whatever they wanted their behavior would have reflected their true essence, just the way it does today.  No, they haven&rsquo;t regressed, but we are being brought down to their level.</p>

<p>These doctors testified before the Supreme Court that a lot of lives would be saved in the process of legalizing abortion. NO more danger from back alley abortions, what they were called. About 70 women per year, year after year died from such abortions.</p>
<p>And now, year after year, we have about 1.5 million abortions each year. </p>
<p>Well, to save [?] 70 women per year, they now abort 1.5 million babies in the womb. Do the math and figure if it was worth it.</p>

<p>You are correct.  In the 1960s we were the &#8216;enlightened&rsquo; Northeasterners who derided &#8216;ignorant&rsquo; Southerners for warning us of the results of Civil Rights.  Now after 40 years I&rsquo;m wondering just exactly who the real ignoramuses were.  Maybe it takes common sense and historical knowledge rather than politically correct education to understand cultural differences between races.  </p>

<p>That is good to read. I grew up in Western NY State, but havn&rsquo;t been there in some years.  That is how I remember it   &mdash;   clean, tidy, and wholesome.  Yes, and white too. All white. It was ENTIRELY white when I lived there as a child. And I don&rsquo;t mean 99%. (I&rsquo;ll leave out Buffalo.)</p>
<p>I suspect that what MD had in mind were those places within the corrupting orbit of NY City. THAT is another world from the rest of the state!  In fact, people in &#8220;The City&#8221; regard Northern and Western NY as part of the Middle West, not even in the same state as NYC  (and culturally, it isn&rsquo;t).</p>

		<p>The entire State of New York, especially the Hudson River valley, is filled with small cities that are hellish ghettos.  It&rsquo;s part of the massive &#8220;exurban decay&#8221; that surrounds New York City.  As new immigrants from Indian, China, Pakistan, Mexico, Dominican Republic etc. have flooded NYC over the last 20 years, the blacks and Puerto Rican who used to live in places like the Bronx have largely moved to depressed former mill towns in upstate New York, Eastern Pennsylvania and Western Massachusetts.  </p>

<p>Could not agree more with the above statement.  Both the North and the South have made big mistakes, and unfortunately there is still a longitudinal divide that exists in the U.S., different from though related to, the White/colored divide.  The end-game we seek is the same.  If more of the blame for our current situation might lie with the &#8220;North&#8221; rather than the &#8220;South&#8221;, so be it.  But do not let it detract from our  White Nationalist cohesion that will be all we are left with.</p>

<p>I would bet that now in 2010, very few whites in NY have ancestors who lived there in the mid-19th century and served in the CW.  Me for one.  My great, great uncle served in the 6th NY Heavy Artillery.  But I don&rsquo;t live in NY, even though some distant cousins do.  But they are way up on the St. Lawrence river in small towns.  But don&rsquo;t look down on me too much.  I am also a distant cousin to General Robert E. Lee.  I have some evidence that those New Yorkers who served as youths soon regretted their participation.  I also have evidence that they really didn&rsquo;t care about slavery.  What they cared about was their jealousy of the Southern way of life, the idea of elitism, etc.  I am pretty sure that they realized their folly long before they grew old.  Such things are not worth that much death and destruction.  They got used by religious and political firebrands who had to see blood and Armageddon.</p>
