			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bob Egelko, San Francisco Chronicle, May 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>College officials in Arizona were under no obligation to punish a professor who sent e-mails to fellow employees in 2003 denouncing a Latino celebration as racist, complaining about &#8220;multicultural stupor&#8221; and proclaiming the &#8220;superiority of Western civilization,&#8221; a federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled Thursday.</p>
<p>The messages from Walter Kehowski, a math professor at Glendale Community College near Phoenix, were constitutionally protected free speech and did not constitute harassment of Latino employees who received them, said the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>&#8220;The government may not silence speech because the ideas it promotes are thought to be offensive,&#8221; Chief Judge Alex Kozinski said in the 3-0 ruling. The panel also included retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor, sitting by temporary assignment.</p>
<p>The court overturned a judge&rsquo;s decision that would have allowed a jury to decide whether the Maricopa Community College District, Kehowski&rsquo;s employer, violated Latino employees&rsquo; right to be free of discrimination and harassment by refusing to fire or discipline the professor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kehowski has taught in the Maricopa district since 1998. In October 2003, he sent what the court described as three &#8220;racially charged&#8221; e-mails to all district employees.</p>
<p>One described Dia de la Raza, a celebration observed by some Latinos instead of Columbus Day, as &#8220;explicitly racist.&#8221; Another saluted Columbus Day as a time to &#8220;celebrate the superiority of Western civilization.&#8221;</p>
<p>The third message replied to accusations of racism, saying, &#8220;Boogie-boogie-boo to you,&#8221; and said the nation must pull itself &#8220;out of the multicultural stupor.&#8221; It also contained a link to Kehowski&rsquo;s own Web site that said the only immigration reform needed was &#8220;preservation of White majority.&#8221;</p>
<p>The messages drew student protests and criticism from the district chancellor, who said nevertheless that any disciplinary action would violate academic freedom.</p>
<p>The suit by Latino employees argued that the e-mails constituted harassment, just like racial slurs spoken at work, and that the district was complicit because of its refusal to punish Kehowski. But the court said their real objection was to his viewpoint.</p>

		<p>I detest these reply-to-all public discussions by email that seem characteristic of educational institutions. Most instructors and other recipients delete them as junk mail. On the rare occasions I do chime in, it&rsquo;s after reading and re-reading what I&rsquo;ve said to make sure that nothing can be used against me by the campus thought-police.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pleasant surprise to see this protected as free speech, but it&rsquo;s always wiser and less annoying to others to seek a more appropriate forum for spouting opinions.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m shocked that the Ninth Circuit Court got something right.  And to those who disagree with Walter Kehowski&rsquo;s assertion that Western civilization is superior, please explain why it is that third worlders from all over the planet are always wanting to move into countries founded by whites (i.e., Westerners).</p>

		<p>The very fact of something like this actually becoming a court case at all is an outrageous assault on our society that should fill every good American with a terrible resolve.</p>
<p>Do non-white teachers wind up in court for saying Columbus day is racist?</p>
<p>Or for saying that Chinese astronomy was superior to that of the West, at a certain time?  Or that during the so-called Islamic Golden Age, they were superior to the West? </p>
<p>It is clearly nothing other than the action of people wishing white culture destroyed. There should be no such court cases, no compromise of any kind.  </p>
<p>Sound &#8220;extreme&#8221;? Think about what &#8220;compromise&#8221; means.  How much of your culture and society do you think you should be destroyed?  If &#8220;getting along&#8221; is your priority, compromise your method, then you must accept the destruction of your own, at least in part.   And we already have, for that matter.  Has it made things better? </p>
<p>Note that Japan never had a problem saying the West (in particular, America) was superior.  &#8220;We must catch up&#8221; was a common refrain.  And so they did.  This is the healthy response to another&rsquo;s success: inspiration to better one&rsquo;s own - NOT  obsessively and compulsively destroying all that&rsquo;s good in the world, and those who make it.  But that is all the invading third world can do.  </p>
<p>Compare that, and the results, with those in the U.K., U.S.A., and Australia who ban words such as &#8220;gang&#8221;, &#8220;islamic terrorist&#8221;, those who bind, gag, and bend the public over to be the first in line to rape it, and to take first cut of the loot, before leaving the bound, gagged, beaten, robbed, and raped public to the third world hordes whipped up for the greatest sacking of all time.  </p>
<p>&#8220;under no obligation to punish the professor&#8221; is absolutely revolting.  They have no business even considering it.  What a sad state, when the 9th circus is the last line standing for the rights of white Americans.  </p>

		<p>Wow, this is a surprise.  I guess that all those poor people who have been fired for sending emails with pictures of watermelons on the White House lawn and so forth should now be able to sue for their jobs back.  And the Obama administration is guilty of illegally firing that Washington University in St. Louis professor from their gulf clean-up team for saying that the human body is not designed for (male) homosexual activity and that anyone who cares about diversity is racist by definition and that disabled kids should not receive double time for college exams, etc.  Of course, this ruling will surely be appealed and overturned by the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Exactly. The 9th is the last appeals court before the Supreme Court. Based in San Fran and is noted for a lot of rulings considered goofy. That this case got this far and then was ruled in favor of free speech does say a lot? Whitey had just better be careful of what he says.</p>

		<p>A few days ago a scientist was dumped from the oil spills team for saying similar things. Someone needs to issue legal guidelines about what can be said. What speech can be prosecuted under law and what speech can lead to legally being dismissed from a job? What speech can lead to public censure or condemnation? A district chancellor of the college was critical of the professor. As someone in authority we need clarity for when he is going to criticize someone.  And then there are differing legal jurisdictions. People in Europe or Canada read this site but are subject to different laws.</p>
<p>The time line in this case is interesting. This case started seven years ago in 2003. That&rsquo;s a long time for resolution. Most people would be intimidated by so long a period of uncertainty. It&rsquo;s better to keep one&rsquo;s mouth shut. The professor was hired in 1998, or five years earlier. Did he wait for tenure to say what he really thinks?</p>

In the face of such confusion, and such PC tyranny, and such egalitarian hysteria, the wisest course is to say NOTHING (that is racial), in print, that can be used against you. <br>
Such are the times we live in!</p>

		<p>Uh, Poster #1, &#8220;La Raza&#8221; is translated &#8220;the people,&#8221; NOT &#8220;the race.&#8221;  A colloquialism if you will.  I&rsquo;m not supporting it, BTW; but I do think if we&rsquo;re going to translate Spanish we should do it correctly, as an Hispanic would hear it.</p>
<p>Well, kudos to Prof. Kehowski!!  It really is boiling down to the need to preserve the white race.  I never thought I&rsquo;d say that, but since our numbers are dwindling and the black &amp; brown numbers are mushrooming, we have got to get busy&hellip; if you know what I mean.  I&rsquo;m 65, way too old, but you younger white folk, have at least 4 kids per couple!!!  Preferably 6&hellip;.  We whites should make arrangements to help support those of our race who have a lot of kids - they could use the help, and we can be grateful to them for preserving our race.</p>

<p>How do you propose I, a younger white man, go about doing that considering the following: most white women today are selfish and either focus on careers, will sleep with a non-white man, or don&rsquo;t want kids (or more than two); it&rsquo;s more expensive to raise kids these days; most good-paying jobs are going overseas/being filled by non-whites for quoats; taxes will be raise to fund more anti-white and anti-West agendas; and most white women and most white men, the younger ones, are pro-black, are too willing to make hispanics feel at home, and want to just have fun, screw around, get drunk, use drugs, and be irresponsible?  Yes, as a younger white man, I have observed this among most whites under the age of 35 and 40.</p>

		<p>Dr. Kehowski showed extreme bravery in the face of the administration threatening termination and placing him on leave from his teaching position.  He did not have the requisite 7 years for tenure at the college.  I believe that he stood his ground because of the strength of his convictions.</p>
<p>If we all followed suit we would change this country.</p>
