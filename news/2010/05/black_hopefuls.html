<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/05/us/politics/05blacks.html?emc=eta1">Black Hopefuls Pick This Year in G.O.P. Races</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Steinhauer, New York Times, May 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Among the many reverberations of President Obama&rsquo;s election, here is one he probably never anticipated: at least 32 African-Americans are running for Congress this year as Republicans, the biggest surge since Reconstruction, according to party officials.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But now black Republicans are running across the country  &mdash;  from a largely white swath of beach communities in Florida to the suburbs of Phoenix, where an African-American candidate has raised more money than all but two of his nine (white) Republican competitors in the primary.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But interviews with many of the candidates suggest that they felt empowered by Mr. Obama&rsquo;s election, that it made them realize that what had once seemed impossible  &mdash;  for a black candidate to win election with substantial white support  &mdash;  was not.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many of the candidates are trying to align themselves with the Tea Partiers, insisting that the racial dynamics of that movement have been overblown. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still, black Republicans face a double hurdle: black Democrats who are disinclined to back them in a general election, and incongruity with white Republicans, who sometimes do not welcome the blacks whom party officials claim to covet as new members.</p>

		<p>The GOP lost my vote forever when it adopted Juan McShame and Michael Steele. The GOP may as well go completely Black now, because I will never donate another dime to their party or cast another vote for a Republican candidate as long as I live.</p>
<p>I know many fellow Whites who feel the same way. We&rsquo;ve permanently tossed the GOP overboard with their egalitarian friends on the Left. The GOP has not been a Conservative party in many years and it will only become worse. They&rsquo;ve gone completely Black and they&rsquo;re not coming back. Good riddance.</p>
<p><br>
Don&rsquo;t betray our race by voting for them.</p>

		<p>Big mistake by the republican party here.</p>
<p>In many ways, this election is the last chance for our federal government.  People in this country are dog tired of no representation no matter which party is in office.  And by people, I mean white people on both the left and the right.</p>
<p>Clearly the republican party plans to get into power and immediately institute more anti-white racism similar to what Obama is doing.  The states will respond to this by nullifying federal law.  It won&rsquo;t be long before taxes no longer go to the federal government but are kept within states.  There will be vast differences in policy among states as none of them listen to the federal government anymore.  Where a person lives will determine if their community is governed by white values of justice, morality and the rule of law or multicultural values of kleptocracy and forced redistribution of wealth from whites to non-whites.</p>
<p>In the beginning, race won&rsquo;t be mentioned.  But only in the beginning.</p>

		<p>A timely reminder for anyone toying with the notion that the GOP is somehow, just maybe, a kind-of &#8220;conservative&#8221; or &#8220;opposition&#8221; party. Where exactly have these black &#8220;Republicans&#8221; been? Most likely in the other party, until now, when, having stuck their fingers in the wind, they&rsquo;ve determined that the wind is blowing the other way. The sorry records of black republicans such as Julius Caesar Watts ought to dispel any illusions as to what these candidates are all about, but all too many Tea Party whites will jump at this opportunity to prove that they&rsquo;re not &#8220;racist.&#8221; If only we could separate ourselves from such sorry, pathetic fools.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t trust them.  I&rsquo;d want to see a CLEAR and LONG record of conservative behavior, voting, and activism.  Just as the liberal commie front tried to insert stooges with racist signs into Tea Party rallies, this could be a planned 5th column of candidates who once elected will vote &#8220;conservative&#8221; as much as Insane McCain and Olympia Snow-job did.<br>
Put another way, RINO of the worst sort.</p>

		<p>Quite likely this will be the final nail driven in the republicans coffin. Republicans have spit on their constituents, one time after another. In the Indiana senate race there were 5 Rep candidates,4 of whom were Indiana resident conservatives, against gun control, abortion, illegal immigration, cap and tax, and  for free enterprise and capitalism. The republican senate committee went to Virginia and coaxed Dan Coates, a replacement for Dan Quail, when he recieved the nomination for vice president. Mr. Coates never saw a draconian gun grabber law he didn&rsquo;t love. He voted with Chuckie Schumer, Barbara Boxer, and Diane Feinstein numerous times to defeat the second ammendment. He voted with the dems on cap and tax, and is an absolute RINO. He won the nomination using the H. Ross Pee-rot ploy, by splitting the conservative votes. Now hoosiers are stuck with the Juan Mcamnesty syndrome, vote for the dem or the rino.The NRA has already said they would support the dem candidate if Coates won the nomination. Brad Ellsworth a blue dog dem who sold out his constituents on the health scare fiasco. Then of course you have Michael Steele, and now a bunch of anti white, black candidates.They are in our face, and they can&rsquo;t figure out why they are losers? duh!</p>

		<p>It is racist to make them run for office and spend money on their campaigns. We should just give them the offices because they want them. Blacks deserve everything, and only a racist would resist or suggest that democratic rules apply to blacks.</p>
<p>Blacks will own everything one day, and they will sue us when it all falls apart. The will say we made all our inventions racist so that they wouldn&rsquo;t work when blacks owned them.</p>

<p>Yes, and if there are enough foolish whites to vote for them, the&rsquo;ll spend their time in office doing what they think will help blacks and ONLY blacks.</p>
<p>No blacks.  I don&rsquo;t care who they are.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they became Republicans just in order to help turn the party more to the left.<br>

		<p>If these candidates were of the caliber of Clarence Thomas or Ward Connerly then I&rsquo;d consider them. But I&rsquo;m not voting for a candidate just because the party insiders want a few tokens. Speeking of tokens, isn&rsquo;t it about time they dropkick Michael Steele&rsquo;s tail out?</p>

		<p>It is very much in black&rsquo;s interest to rise against their liberal overloards, and reject their serfdom. Their leaders are bought and paid for as house slaves on the Welfare plantation.  I will choose to believe there are freedmen yet among the descendants of slaves.</p>

<p>The last time I voted Republican was in 1980 when I voted for Ronald Reagan.  After he and the Republicans came out in favor of &#8220;free trade&#8221; policies I realized I had made a mistake.  My Republican friends said I was crazy.  I was vindicated when he signed off on the Simpson-Mazzoli Act of 1986, giving amnesty to many (non-White) foreigners living here illegally. Let&rsquo;s also never forget Iran-Contra, people. </p>
<p>Whenever I hear Republicans talk about how &#8220;great&#8221; Reagan was I always throw those embarrassing facts in their faces.  They quickly shut up.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party should change its name to the Socialist Party because that&rsquo;s what it is, in fact.  The Republican Party should change its name to the Plutocratic Party for the same reason.  Neither party&rsquo;s leadership cares a whit for White Americans or for the future of this country (Republican Party flag-waving notwithstanding).  Despite what they preach to their constituents, they only care about getting elected so they can stuff their pockets with their filthy lucre.</p>

<p>I am a registered member of the Conservative Party of the State of Zoo York but to tell you the truth, I don&rsquo;t like them, either.  In Europe, especially in places like Italy, Germany and France, as corrupt as those places are, ethno-nationalists at least have parties that represent their interests.  What choice do we have here?  The Evil of Two Lessers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been more afraid of the future than I am now.</p>

		<p>5 White Slave:</p>
<p>Actually, according to V-Dare, Brad Ellsworth has the best immigration record of all the major candidates for that Senate seat in Indiana of both parties.  I&rsquo;d definitely vote Ellsworth if I lived there.  Also, in Ohio, the GOP is sending up Rob Portman for Senate, who is a free trader.  Which should resonate as well in that rust belt state as a lady of the night emitting flatulence in a house of worship.  I don&rsquo;t know much about the Democrat (Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher), but I think he&rsquo;ll win.  This hurts GOP chances to take back the Senate.</p>
<p>As for the article&rsquo;s subject matter, I think with a few exceptions, most of these black Republicans are Republicans because the queue is too long in the Democrat power structure.  All you have to do is feign a little neo-conism, and the Stupid Party will make you someone in a hurry.  </p>
<p>In the British elections yesterday, David Cameron, Tory Party leader, who, after Obama was elected, said that he is going to find &#8220;Britian&rsquo;s Obama,&#8221; ran two black Tories in two different districts.  One has a successful food business, and one is a &#8220;youth activist.&#8221;  And both lost, thankfully.</p>

		<p>Speaking of the uselessness of the Republicans, why is it that all of Western Europe has small-but-growing nationalist political parties, but here in North America a nationalist has absolutely NO party to vote for? Now I&rsquo;m not voting age yet, but in two years when I can vote I&rsquo;d like to have a reasonable choice. Now I don&rsquo;t mind the GOP fielding some upper-class, educated blacks once in a while, but I fear that next they&rsquo;ll be fielding Hispanics left-and-right. And the Republicans don&rsquo;t support our political views generally so I just don&rsquo;t see who a nationalist can vote for in America.</p>
