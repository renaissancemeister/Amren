<h1><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/05/17/obamas-aunt-granted-asylum-prevent-return-kenya/">Obama&rsquo;s Aunt Granted Asylum, Stopping Her Deportation to Kenya</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News, May 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A U.S. immigration court granted asylum to President Barack Obama&rsquo;s African aunt, allowing her to stay in the country, her attorneys said Monday.</p>
<p>The decision was mailed Friday and comes three months after Kenya native Zeituni Onyango, the half-sister of Obama&rsquo;s late father, testified at a closed hearing in Boston, where she arrived in a wheelchair and two doctors testified in support of her case.</p>
<p>The basis for her asylum request hadn&rsquo;t been made public. People who seek asylum must show that they face persecution in their homeland on the basis of religion, race, nationality, political opinion or membership in a social group.</p>
<p>Her lawyer, Margaret Wong, said last year that Onyango first applied for asylum &#8220;due to violence in Kenya.&#8221; The East African nation is fractured by cycles of electoral violence every five years.</p>
<p>In a November interview with The Associated Press, Onyango said she was disabled and was learning to walk again after being paralyzed from Guillain-Barre syndrome, an autoimmune disorder.</p>

		<p>Funny, I seem to remember a similar story from a South African who claimed asylum due to violence. Didn&rsquo;t the media drag that guys name through the mud and slam him, and didn&rsquo;t they decide to review the decision made to grant him asylum. I am sure they will review Onyango&rsquo;s claim aswell in the interest of fainess. Oh silly me, shes black and the aunt of the Messiah, of course they won&rsquo;t. They will probably give her a warm welcome with heaps of praise about how she survived such a terrible ordeal. Oh the sweet irony.</p>

		<p>Well, I guess by the standards cited in this case, that Obama&rsquo;s aunt feared violence in her native Kenya, all Kenyans should be granted asylum in this country.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d go along with that if Fish and Wildlife would declare open season throughout the year on Kenyans, a pleasant fantasy one must admit, but unlikely in the current political environment.</p>

		<p>The only thing that surprises me about this is Obama cared enough about a blood relative of his to actually pick up the phone and intervene.  I notice he has not intervened with a number of &#8220;close&#8221; relatives in dire straits even though it would be nothing for him to do so.</p>
<p>More likely, some flunky (some WHITE flunky) of his did it for him, without his direct knowledge&hellip;.feeling more empathy for his aunt than he ever did.</p>

		<p>Surprised??  Hardly.  What would have been surprising is if they had actually followed the law and deported her.  No way B.O. is going to let them send his ailing auntie back to her home.  After all, it might make him look like he doesn&rsquo;t care&hellip;</p>

		<p>Not at all surprised by this decision. The only silver-lining I can find is that Barack H. Obama&rsquo;s Aunt is a post-menopausal woman, meaning she won&rsquo;t be popping out a litter of babies. As for the rationale that Kenya experiences election violence every five years, that country has a population of 38 million people, so does that now mean we have to let every one of its citizens come here for asylum so they can escape this re-occuring &#8220;electoral violence?!!&#8221;</p>

as she walked briskly along to escape the reporters. Now she is in a wheelchair. And of course she faces &#8220;torture&#8221; if she goes back to Kenya. </p>

<p>NO WAY! the White SA will eventually be handed back to the black Africans&hellip; BTW! I work with a number of Kenyans and they seem to be a pretty decent lot with nothing but praise for their country and telling me how safe and progressive it is.  I believe them more than anything that would come out of D.C. ((district of coloreds))</p>

		<p>I knew this would happen. We all did. Just what we need&hellip;&hellip;another fraud commiting handicapped illegal alien to support.</p>
<p>Another sham, just like his Nobel Prize. It&rsquo;s obvious this guy is in over his head and just trying to get through his term. He&rsquo;s not the entitled, self-important moronic Bozo that Dubya was, but he&rsquo;s every bit as bad in his own way. The fact that he&rsquo;s shown no decisive leadership is going to really bring some chickens home to roost. The only good side is he will be a one term President.</p>
<p>I have a lovely White Australian girlfriend that I&rsquo;d love to bring over here and marry. She&rsquo;s sweet. honorable. intelligent and a hard worker. But it looks like it may not happen because there are so many hoops for us to jump through and money to spend to get official clearance. You can imagine how I feel when I see lawbreakers like this continually rewarded, while we, who are trying to do the right thing, continually have obstacles thrust in our path&hellip;..And to think a man with my name was here at the inception of this nation and fought in the Revolution&hellip;&hellip;.</p>

<p>I agree. Absolutely!   It&rsquo;s outrageous to force these pathetic people to live in Africa among Africans.  It&rsquo;s inhumane cruelty!  The same goes for Haitians.  We should take pity upon our fellow humans, since we are all brothers under the skin,  and import them here so that they can live as we do,  with access to free medical care, welfare, and all the other benefits the American  (and  Canadian and  European)  taxpayers are willing to provide.  It&rsquo;s our moral duty!</p>

		<p>On the Mainstream article on Yahoo, many of the first posters noted that, hidden in the article, it mentions Aunt Obama was living for free in public housing after her original petition for asylum was denied. In other words she was an illegal alien living for free in US public housing, at time when liberals tell us no shenanigans are going on. They were much more effective than me. After the comment everyone can vote whether they agree or disagree with the comment. Almost everyone agreed with their sentiments.  </p>
