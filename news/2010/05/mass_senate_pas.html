<h1>Mass. Senate Passes Crackdown on Illegal Immigrants</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Noah Bierman and Maria Sacchetti, Boston Globe, May 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With one lawmaker citing President Lincoln&rsquo;s respect for the rule of law, the Massachusetts Senate passed a far-reaching crackdown this afternoon on illegal immigrants and those who would hire them, going further, senators said, than any immigration bill proposed over the past five years.</p>
<p>In a surprising turn of events, the legislation replaced a narrower bill that was passed Wednesday over the objections of Republicans.</p>
<p>The measure, which passed on a 28-10 vote as an amendment to the budget, would bar the state from doing business with any company found to break federal laws barring illegal immigrant hiring. It would also toughen penalties for creating or using fake identification documents, and explicitly deny in-state college tuition for illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>The amendment would also require the state&rsquo;s public health insurance program to verify residency through the Department of Homeland Security, and would require the state to give legal residents priority for subsidized housing.</p>
<p>The amendment will now be part of negotiations with the House as part of the entire state budget.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Democrats had resisted such a sweeping proposal, but spent last evening negotiating today&rsquo;s measure, shortly after a new polled showed 84 percent of the liberal-leaning state&rsquo;s voters supported tough immigration rules barring state services to illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The measure comes weeks after immigration measures failed in the House, and amid heightened debate over illegal immigration fueled by the state&rsquo;s election season and Arizona&rsquo;s passage in April of the toughest immigration law in the nation.</p>
<p>Recent polls have found that, while voters supported blocking illegal immigrants&rsquo; access to public benefits, they were split over whether the Bay State should have a law such as Arizona&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Thursday&rsquo;s Senate amendment would also authorize the state attorney general&rsquo;s office to broker an agreement with federal authorities to help enforce immigration law. {snip}</p>
<p>The legislation also would increase penalties for driving without a license, one of the main problems facing illegal immigrants in Massachusetts. {snip}</p>
<p>Most immigrants in Massachusetts are here legally, but an estimated 190,000, or 20 percent, are here illegally, according to the census.</p>

		<p>The MA State Senate is overwhelmingly Democrat, and the few Republicans therein are moderate/liberal types, such as one of their former members who got a new job in January.</p>
<p>Also, both the Republican and Independent running for Governor against Deval Patrick have come out for SB 1070 like laws.</p>

		<p>A few decades ago, in Massachusetts, a child of a state rep died on an amusement park ride. Prior to this, our legislature (known officially since colonial times as &#8220;the Great and General Court&#8221;) had ignored all attempts to regulate these rides and have them periodically inspected. Within days of the unfortunate death of this child, regulations were passed into law.<br>
A few days ago, Amren reported the car accident that involved an illegal immigrant and a Massachusetts state rep. The actions of the legislature in this matter at this time are neither surprising nor coincidental: once one of their own was involved, they somehow discovered the real world.<br>
The best thing about this is that we elect our governors in the off-presidential years, so this will be a major issue in the fall election.<br>
A lot of Massachusetts is not ultra-liberal. Brookline sure is, but South Boston still produces more than its share of Marines. The Boston City Council did vote to boycott Arizona, but in Worcester, the second-largest city, the City Council voted down a similar proposal on the grounds that Arizona&rsquo;s laws were none of Worcester&rsquo;s business - which, of course, they aren&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>Even if the Mass. House comes to its senses and passes this new bill from the Senate there&rsquo;s always Deval Patrick to worry about. I&rsquo;d bet the ranch that he would veto it and whether they could override him seems quite uncertain. If he loses reelection in Nov. both of the men who hope to replace him are much more supportive of a crackdown, but that means we won&rsquo;t see anything happen until 2011. Remember, Deval&rsquo;s a far-leftist black who headed the civil right division under Clinton, he loves minorities and criminals and can&rsquo;t stop pandering to them. </p>

		<p>As I&rsquo;ve said before this liberal egalitarian hogwash is just a cover, a way to form alliances with people of color for political power. White liberals have now flinched because of the threat of growing latino political power that threatens to replace them and they&rsquo;re looking out for their own interests.  I predict even California will fall in line once it becomes one of the few last bastions of refuge for the unwashed masses.  </p>

		<p>To Question Diversity, regarding your above post and this tidbit from the article:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Democrats had resisted such a sweeping proposal, but spent last evening negotiating today&rsquo;s measure, shortly after a new polled showed 84 percent of the liberal-leaning state&rsquo;s voters supported tough immigration rules barring state services to illegal immigrants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is interesting that a state such as Massachusetts, so long a comfortably supermajority white &ldquo;multicultural utopia,&rdquo; is suddenly more interested in being an eastern seaboard version of Arizona and not California. The Democratic establishment in the state, seems to be doing a &ldquo;reactionary&rdquo; move against what was lost upon the Kennedy &ldquo;safe seat&rdquo; going to a Republican. Plus, I would guess that like every other state in the union, they are finding that the economic realities of diversity, are a more strain than &ldquo;strength&rdquo; when a recession hits.  </p>
<p>Put into place an ineffectual,  but also Orwellian &ldquo;Presidency,&rdquo; such as has become Comrade BO&rsquo;s General Secretariat (&lsquo;did you plug the hole yet, daddy?&rsquo;) and what do you get?</p>
<p>Well, time will tell; and as such a judge, the bell that tolls into the ever reverberating and unpredictable waters of history and that telling time it engulfs, will be interestingly fluid!</p>

<p>George Wallace carried whole sections of South Boston in the Democrat Primaries for President in 1976 (?, Perhaps it was 1972).  The main reason that deseg was heating up as an issue in Boston, thanks to one Federal judge.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not true. The federal immigration law is much tougher than arizona&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s just that the feds don&rsquo;t enforce it.</p>

		<p>MA is obviously changing.  If I&rsquo;m correct, even Ted Kennedy did not enjoy the level of support in his last years that he did previously.  We&rsquo;re all super-aware of Scott Brown, and recall that Hillary won there in the presidential primary, despite all the Kennedy hype for Obama.  </p>
<p>Politically, Deval Patrick is probably a dead man walking figuratively, so he may, in desperation, not veto an anti-illegal vote.  Then again, he may just stick whitey in the eye one more time.</p>

		<p>The US is splitting up along state lines.  Soon, the federal government will lose its ability to redistribute wealth among states and enforce homogeneity of law.  Arizona is only one highly visible example of what is happening.</p>
<p>Without the diffusion of consequences this brings, it becomes very, VERY unpleasant for any state to solely bear the consequences for their liberal decisions.  More to the point, any taxpayer, can choose, at any time (for now at least) to pick up, move to another state, and bring their tax money with them.</p>
<p>There is now competition among states to maximize the resource of good, law abiding, tax paying people and minimize the liability of violent criminals on welfare.  Several famous white nationalist ads say &#8220;Choose Your Future&#8221;.</p>
<p>Well, the states are choosing.</p>

		<p> I think that for years the northeast has enjoyed the lower wages caused by illegals in the south and southwest with a feeling of superiority over the hicks down here. Now that they are getting their share of non white illegals they are prepared to bellyache.<br>
 The immigration issue will be fully attacked as a repeat of the know nothing party revisited by the press and repeated ad nauseum. This time it wont work because we have our own media now and wont be stopped by milque toast cries of racist without our own media backing us up.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t you just love how black, hispanics, and self-hating whites thought they&rsquo;d take over normal, hardworking white folks without a fight?  Well, they&rsquo;re in for a surprise.  You can only push someone too far before it all blows up in your face.  Even if they do succeed with their anti-white and anti-west agenda, at least they will have to work at it really hard.</p>

		<p>What a coincidence, after State Representative Michael J. Moran was rammed by an illegal alien, Massachusetts decides to crack down on illegals. If it&rsquo;s the dumbed down masses and their families getting harmed, that&rsquo;s ok. But now it&rsquo;s getting close to home, close to the rulers and their families. So what have we learned here. We have learned that the people can protest, or go to the courts for relief, and nothing will happen, however if the rulers and their families are physically threatened or harmed, then they will make the right decisions.</p>

		<p>Why haven&rsquo;t we heard anything about the laws Ma. has passed? No marching to oppose it? No lawsuits aimed at stopping it? No Presidental opposition? Why does Arizona bear the only brunt of trying to uphold the laws of this country? In watching the dueling marches yesterday in Arizona, I thought, here we have one group of people who love their state and their country and want us to remain a law-abiding nation, while the other demands that they be allowed to continue breaking the law by being here at all. I think we&rsquo;ve all been sickened by seeing our country heading toward being the next third world. Why? Isn&rsquo;t there anyone in this country who cares about it with no ulterior motives? No open border traitors who only want votes or cheap labor? No one who will stand and say, no more, this is our country. Get out! If so, please step forward and we&rsquo;ll make you the next President in 2012.</p>
