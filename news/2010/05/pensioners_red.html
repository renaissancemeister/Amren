			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), May 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A pensioner who put up a red, white and blue election poster telling voters to kick out MPs was accused of racism by police.</p>
<p>After being inundated by canvassing politcians, Roy Newman, 74, decided to tell other voters: &#8216;GET THE LOT OUT.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But 90 minutes after he put up the homemade sign up in an upstairs room at his house, two police officers arrived and threatened with arrest.</p>
<p>They said the Union Jack-coloured lettering on a white background could be considered &#8216;racist&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He was told there had been a single complaint and he was ordered to remove it or change it otherwise he would end up in court .</p>
<p>But the former Tory councillor, from North Anston, near Rotherham, South Yorkshire, said police had misunderstood his message.  </p>
<p>He said : &#8216;My sign is up there because the MPs and council leadership we have in place at the moment are a load of rubbish and I want them out, nothing more.</p>
<p>&#8216;The police told me that due to the fact that the words were written in red and blue and the background was white, my sign had racist connotations.</p>
<p>&#8216;What a load or rubbish  &mdash;  it certainly wasn&rsquo;t my intention to come across as racist. I&rsquo;m not racist.&rsquo; </p>
<p>And the furious pensioner, chairman of his local history society and a former Samaritan, slammed police for wasting their time.</p>
<p>He said : &#8216;Three years ago vandals put a brick through my window and when I called the police all they offered me was a crime reference number.</p>
<p>Defiance: Mr Newman put up the sign after being bombarded by canvassers</p>
<p>&#8216;Put up a poster and a police car with two uniformed officers arrives quick as a flash  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s unbelievable.&rsquo; </p>
<p>In the end, under protest Roy altered the colour of some letters to yellow, but refused to change the words.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for South Yorkshire Police said: &#8216;Officers responded to a call from a complainant who had seen the sign and interpreted it as being racist.</p>
<p>&#8216;Given this sign was displayed publicly and seemed to be causing offence we did see fit to attend the address.</p>
<p>&#8216;Officers spoke to Mr Newman and were told that his words referred to councillors and MPs. WE advised him that the wording could be changed to make that fact more clear.</p>
<p>&#8216;Following the officers&rsquo; visit the complainant was contacted by us and the meaning of the sign was explained . They said that they were no longer offended and were happy to let the matter rest.</p>
<p>&#8216;It is unlikely that any further action will be taken.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>Several times in the past America has bailed out the Brits. They gave up their guns and we furnished them more. we stopped the nazi&rsquo;s from wiping their butts. Yet they are still controlled by the leftists, and once great America may no longer be capable of bailing them out since we are rapidly becoming a weak radical leftist country ourselves. When the blind leftists, with their glorious red leaders, led by King Hussein conquer us we will fall into a horrible fate. Mark these words! </p>

		<p>&lsquo;Put up a poster and a police car with two uniformed officers arrives quick as a flash &mdash; it&rsquo;s unbelievable.&rsquo;</p>
<p><br>
What is unbelievable is that Britains haven&rsquo;t gotten this yet.  Their laws, government, police and courts are a sham.  There is barely a pretense at the rule of law anymore and, instead, the job of the so called, police, is to oppress the population.</p>
<p>The government there needs to be overthrown and those responsible dealt with in the typical manner despots are dealt with.  That is only possible if the average Brit is willing to at least admit there is a problem.</p>
<p>Instead, the average Brit seems more inclined to act like the average russian did after the communist revolution.  A very, very tiny minority was able to commit incredibly heinous crimes and atrocities because their victims, although they outnumbered them several millions to one, was simply too apathetic to do anything about it.  Far worse, many, if not most, were willing to sell out everyone else for a pittance.  Since that was mostly a starvation existance, where before, russia had been one of the wealthiest places on earth, the irony is pretty impressive.  Britain is headed down that road.</p>
<p>Perhaps they deserve their fate.</p>

<p>Britain is a nation that is every bit as much on the brink as the US and bot countries will rue the day they ever brought so many third world anti-white haters to its shores.</p>
<p>The radical leftist elites get hysterical when their migration program might be in jeopardy of being denounced, because it could very well lead to their being physically ousted from office.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re walking a tight rope high above everything and one mistep will send them in a death tumble clear to the ground.</p>
<p>Have someone taken the time to explain to them that they might as well jump and get it over with, because, in the end, they&rsquo;re going to fall anyway.</p>

		<p>I suppose we should believe him, but what if he had meant &#8220;Get the lot out&#8221;. As in get the immigrants or the people of color out of Britain? Are they so afraid of one man&rsquo;s opinion? According to Americans in the past, at least over here, &#8220;the very purpose of our institutions is this: that we can think what we like and say what we think&#8221;.</p>
<p>Now our very principles must be betrayed, quite boldly, in order to not be &#8216;insensitive&rsquo; to outsiders? Folks often times coming from societies where these principles do not exist, and from people highly insensitive to whites. Among non-whites, it&rsquo;s considered enlightenment and &#8216;education&rsquo; to be intolerant towards whites. </p>
<p>The authorities can call their program &#8216;tolerance&rsquo; or &#8216;diversity&rsquo; all they want, but it&rsquo;s really just an anti-white, pro-everyone else agenda. Forget speaking your mind, it&rsquo;s an agenda that brings the police and media to your doorstep if you do not even 100% agree, just for words.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been said here before on AmRen. &#8216;errant&rsquo; words spoken by whites are taken more seriously than assault and worse by non-whites.</p>

		<p>Barry #11 totally irrelevant to my post, also a considerable amount of several ethnicities died during that time frame, many on the allies side. I never said we single handedly saved their arses, however we were the main force in the war effort. Ps I never intended to belittle the russians, who will however undoubtedly fight against us in a future major war. I wonder whose side would you support in such an event?</p>

		<p>yeah, barry, a lot of russians died between 1941-1945 (you got the dates wrong there fella, the russians were allies of Hitler in the takeover of Poland).  But, to your argument - yeah, a lot died.  And then they refused to leave ANY of the countries they had swept through to get to Germany, established communism by force in all of them, shot the intelligencia and military in those countries that had existed prior, established the berlin blockade, funded and supplied revolutionary blacks in Africa and asians in Asia, as long as they professed marxist principles, AND let&rsquo;s not forget supplied Castro with nuclear missiles aimed at US 90 miles from our coast.  Good to be able to discern from your post that you are a &#8220;traveler&#8221; though.  Hmmm.  Barry?  Barry?  Would your last name be Obama?  You tell the other guy to grow up?  I say to you, learn your history from somewhere other than the Daily Kos.</p>

<p>Because the police don&rsquo;t want to be accused of ignoring a race complaint, which the tabloid media would blow up into a front page story. </p>
<p>What needs to happen is every concerned Brit should put &#8216;Get the Lot Out&rsquo; signs up in their windows, as a cheeky way of making their thoughts on immigrants known, while they can plausibly say it means something else.</p>

		<p>Of course the British Union Jack is red, white, and blue, so now the British cops are saying their own flag is racist.  I guess if a white person gets out of bed and breathes, that must be racist too.</p>
<p>Now that <i>everything</i> is racist can we just retire that word?</p>

		<p>WHITE SLAVE etc: I&rsquo;ve spent the last 25 years working for two US companies in western Europe and seen US popularity drop to almost nothing. Not hard to see why sometimes.</p>
<p>At least blacks have the sense to stick together.</p>
<p>And BTW, we didn&rsquo;t join WW1 until 1917 (that IS right) and had to borrow guns from the French. All countries have ups and downs so smug comments don&rsquo;t wear well.</p>
