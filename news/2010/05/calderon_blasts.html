<h1>Calderón Blasts Arizona Immigration Law During White House Visit</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Todd J. Gillman, Dallas Morning News, May 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mexican President Felipe Calderón, arriving at the White House for a state visit, wasted no time today criticizing Arizona&rsquo;s new immigration law as unfair and discriminatory.</p>
<p>The law makes it illegal to be in the United States without permission, and requires police to demand documentation from anyone suspected of doing so. Such a law, Calderón asserted at a Rose Garden news conference with President Barack Obama, will subject Mexican citizens to discrimination and was created so that people who &#8220;work and provide things to this nation will be treated as criminals.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mexico is hoping the White House will initiate a federal court action to prevent enforcement of the law.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Calderón said: &#8220;I know that we [he and Obama] share the interest in promoting dignified, legal and orderly living conditions to all migrant workers. Many of them, despite their significant contribution to the economy and to the society of the United States, still live in the shadows and, occasionally, as in Arizona, they even face discrimination.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rep. Lamar Smith of San Antonio, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, took Calderón to task for criticizing the Arizona law, even as illegal border crossings persist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mexican government officials openly talk of a Mexican government boycott of Arizona but make no effort to prevent their citizens from going there,&#8221; Smith said. {snip}</p>
<p>Improving the immigration system is not only possible, it&rsquo;s vital, Calderón said on the South Lawn before a private Oval Office meeting with Obama, followed by a joint news conference in the Rose Garden.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can do so with a community that will promote a dignified life and an orderly way for both our countries,&#8221; Calderón said, adding in English: &#8220;Can we overcome these challenges? Can we build that future of prosperity we want for our people? Yes, we can, if we work together.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>By some estimates, one-tenth of Mexico&rsquo;s population resides in the United States without permission.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Arizona controversy is intertwined with border policy and a lingering debate over immigration reform. This year&rsquo;s volatile electorate has made it hard to see a breakthrough in that area, which has eluded Congress for years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More than 23,000 Mexicans have been killed in three years of drug wars. That includes traffickers, law enforcement officers, soldiers and innocents.</p>

		<p>Question for President Calderón:</p>
<p>If these illegal (and legal) Mexicans make America strong, then why can&rsquo;t they make Mexico strong?  Best not to be racist and hog all these economy-enhancing, society-enhancing and family values-enhancing Mexicans to ourselves.</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;The law makes it illegal to be in the United States without permission.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Shocking!  Such a radical innovation. </p>
<p>And&hellip;how legal is it to be in <i>Mexico</i> without permission?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Mexico is hoping the White [sic] House will initiate a federal court action to prevent enforcement of the law.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>So El Presidiente wants the Mulatto Messiah to exercise his godlike power to nullify a legal action of an American state?  And we allow this cocky foreign fomenter of treason to enter our capital city and openly advocate dictatorship?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;We can do so with a community that will promote a dignified life and an orderly way for both our countries&hellip;&rdquo; </i></p>
<p>No, Felipe, there is no &#8220;community.&#8221;  There is <i>your</i> country, and there is <i>our</i> country.  The two are not identical.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;Calderón said, adding in English&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Say, that was nice of him.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Can we overcome these challenges? Can we build that future of prosperity we want for our people? Yes, we can, if we work together.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>No, no, Felipe.  Let me explain it again.  Only <i>you</i> can overcome those challenges, in <i>your</i> country.  There is no &#8220;our&#8221; people, there is only <i>your</i> people and <i>our</i> people, and unless May-hee-co was annexed as the fifty-first state while I wasn&rsquo;t looking, they are not the same group.</p>
<p>If you can clean up the mess in your own country, get started at once.  You&rsquo;re wasting time coming to <i>our</i> country to demand that we do the job for you.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Will subject Mexican citizens to discrimination&#8221;.</p>
<p>Calderson said it all right there. No one is worried that it might affect American citizens of Latin origins. The people in question are in fact &#8220;Mexican Citizens&#8221;. </p>
<p>I need a passport and Visa to enter almost any country in the world so what so special about Mexican citizens?</p>

		<p>A well known Chicago area chef is scheduled to prepare the luscious meals for Obama and the visiting Mexican president. Nothing is too good for these leaders as they fawn over each other, as all the while  the mere peasants in both countries are given the shaft. Never mind regime change in countries thousands of miles away, we should be pushing it now for Mexico. They are trying to be clever by dumping tens of millions of their citizens on us, a hostile act. Their government is rotten and they&rsquo;ll do nothing whatever for their own people even as the well off classes live high on the hog. The country has plenty of natural resources and should be able to provide a living for the population. Give Calderon an ultimatum and send him on his way to implement it without delay, not wine and dine this two faced character.   </p>

<p>I saw video of Obama and Calderon denouncing SB 1070 from the South Lawn of the White House.  If they look out to the distance, they can see fences and armed guards.  That is indicative of a security system, which those charged with keeping the occupants and premises of the WH secure use to enforce their desire to let in whom they want in, and to keep out who they want to remain out.  </p>
<p>Kinda like&hellip;um&hellip;a proper border?</p>
<p>As an aside, the Secret Service is going to give the classic proctological exam to this year&rsquo;s graduating class of Kalamazoo Central H.S. in Kal., MI.  The graduates will, among other things, be asked about their citizenship status.  Everyone of course will be asked to produce IDs.  In other words, &#8220;Your Papers Please.&#8221;  If I were one of those graduating seniors, I would boycott graduation, and make sure the President and my soon to be former school&rsquo;s administrators get the message that I&rsquo;m not about to enable the Wacko-In-Chief&rsquo;s Hypocrisy   &mdash;   They rightly scour the graduates for security threats, but want to give Arizona one-tenth of those security rights.  AFAIC, mail me both my diploma and the transcripts from the teleprompter.</p>

		<p>This infuriates me. Mexico has NO business coming here telling us what we should do in our own country. Illegal entry is a crime in every nation including Mexico. As a matter of fact, Mexico has some of the toughest immigration laws in the country. Mexico is the biggest hypocrite in the world. Calderon needs to take care of his OWN country&rsquo;s problems and these illegals have no right to be here breaking our laws and costing the American taxpayer billions in addition to the crime they cause. According to Calderon, they help our economy, what a joke. Everywhere the illegals go, it&rsquo;s a drain on us. Of course, Calderon wants to dump HIS responsiblity on us. That is why he is yacking about Arizona.</p>

		<p>Our local rag has taken a poll on this visit and 100% of the comments are anti-illegal, pro-border control. One hundred percent. Maybe people are waking up. Americans are getting blow-their-top angry about all taxes they pay and pay, yet still are seeing severe county &amp; federal services cut, school teachers fired, entire SCHOOLS CLOSED, all due to our tax money being squandered on illegals sucking dry our system. American citizens are being forced to do without because of these criminals hiding in our country. I would love to ask Calderon what the procedure is for an American sneaking into his country, demanding their laws be changed to accommodate me.</p>

<p>Yes, illegal immigranst provide all sorts of wonderful things, including but not limited to: murder, rape, robbery, drugs, and increased unemployment. Thanks Calderon for pointing that out.</p>
<p>I have the feeling that, with a Democratic majority in both houses, and a Democratic President, amnesty will soon be passed. Of course even with a Republican government you can&rsquo;t feel safe, didn&rsquo;t Reagan grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants back in the eighties?</p>

<p>Notice he said OUR people. Don&rsquo;t think he was taking about us &#8220;gringos&#8221; do you! This Mexican dictator has alot of gall to dictate to us how to treat &#8220;his people&#8221; while we&rsquo;re footing the damn bill. Where was this sympathy when they were still living in Mexico? He wasn&rsquo;t &#8220;promoting dignified, legal and orderly living conditions&#8221; for his people then, why now! Trust me folks, that &#8220;we&#8221; in &#8220;if we work together&#8221; means the U.S. taxpayers - or rather the &#8220;gringo&#8221; U.S. taxpayers. We are NOT obligated to uplift the poor of the whole planet, especially when they&rsquo;ve done it to themselves. Ending foreign aid and taxing money wired to Anna Sanchez Martinez Hernandez Lopez in Mexico at 80% would put a dent in our debt.   </p>

<p>The greatest abuser of immigrants is Mexico.  The government looks the other way when the are raped, killed, robbed and beaten by federal and local authorities.</p>
<p>But not one word from this administration on that, nor have we heard a peep from the UN.</p>
<p>Speaking for myself, I&rsquo;m rooting for the drug gangs to take over.</p>
<p>If any of the terrorists who are in the US after being ushered into the country by the cartels commit ANY kind of terrorist act, the pro-black community organizer will be impeached.</p>

<p>This is correct. Normally a foreign dignitary as a guest in the U.S. would not speak this way, no matter what. Such criticism is usually described as &#8220;unacceptable&#8221;, the speaker receiving a persona non grata declaration and a notice to leave immediately. Begone from this premises!!</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s hard to blame Mexico or Calderon, in that they have an excellent immigration policy which they enforce, and they are also regaining territory they lost in the Mexican-American War. If I were Mexican, I&rsquo;d immigrate to America to be part of the invasion force.  That we have yet another anti-American president certainly doesn&rsquo;t help our country, but as with many other issues, &#8220;they&#8221; aren&rsquo;t the problem, we are (present company excepted). Should the breakup come, I nominate &#8220;liberalism&#8221; as a criminal offense.</p>

		<p>The kids at Kalamazoo High School are being asked about their respective citizenship status.  Did anyone quiz the Pres about HIS actual citizenship status?</p>
<p>Sounds to me like the Secret Service has a big hole in its security net.  They had better not let this guy with the big ears into the ceremony.</p>
<p>But all is not lost.  The graduation can proceed.  Just turn the teleprompter around and let everyone read its screen as it scrolls down through the President&rsquo;s speech.  I&rsquo;m sure that the teleprompter can produce its citizenship papers.  After all, somewhere on the outside of that machine is the manufacturers plaque stating its model number, serial number, name of the manufacturing company and that companies physical location.</p>
<p>But I am presuming that the teleprompter was made in the good ol&rsquo; USA.  But then, maybe it was made in Canada!</p>
<p>Oops!  Another security breach!  An illegal alien teleprompter has infiltrated the East Room of the White House!  The horrors!</p>

		<p>I couldn&rsquo;t believe my eyes when I saw a Mexican president on the steps of the white house telling the American public what he doesn&rsquo;t like about one of our States in the union, and have our President, the elected official of the American people, nod his head in approval and agree with the Mexican President.  Good grief.  If I were the US president, I would have punched that Mexican in the face and sent him packing.  </p>

		<p>I have an idea.  I could be wrong on this, but aren&rsquo;t the vast majority of illegals from Mexico, not from say, Honduras, or Guatemala, or Argentina?  I know that plenty of them come through Mexico, but I think it&rsquo;s safe to assume that the vast majority are Mexicans.  So  &mdash;  let&rsquo;s assume, probably optimistically, that we do seal the border, and we reinstitute some form of &#8220;guest worker&#8221; program again, whereby the lettuce pickers are truly seasonal, and pack up and go home once they&rsquo;re done.  Since Mexico is such a large scale abuser of the rights of &#8220;immigrants&#8221; from other countries, let&rsquo;s banish Mexico from the guest worker program.  Make the jobs available only to those countries south of Mexico, and tell them it&rsquo;s first come, first serve for picking lettuce.  Then we could sit back and laugh our butts off when Mexico has to go full bore when the Guatemalans and Venezuelans invade Mexico full scale.  Of course, it&rsquo;s quite possible none of the &#8220;guest workers&#8221; from south of Mexico&rsquo;s borders will arrive, with Mexico cracking down on illegal migrants and all  &mdash;  oh, &#8220;the horror!  the horror!&#8221;  Just a thought.</p>

		<p>Bush cozies up to Vicente Fox and relatively few notice it. Now Obama goes all out kissing Calderon and people have now definitely noticed. If it were McCain it perhaps would have caused a few more grumbles than in the past but no more. Obama would seem to be a Godsend to those of us who want this brown drown stopped and reversed. Despite all attempts to make a distinction between illegal and legal I can tell you that the people on the ground, whose towns and neighborhoods were destroyed by third world colonization will no longer care about who &#8216;came in the front door&rsquo; (ask Minnesotans about their legal Somali refugees). Now the developing boycott feud between Arizona and LA, by extension CA (&#8216;boycott us, CA, and we&rsquo;ll rethink those power contracts&rsquo;), is providing us with a model for future and greater conflicts between the states. With the economic and debt crises popping now who knows where all this will end up. At the very least this is now all out in the open. Let the backlash begin.</p>

		<p>What a delicious opportunity this would have been for the President to have asked Senor Calderon, in wide-eyed innocence for some advice on how this Wise Latino would handle the problem of illegal aliens in the Mexican manner. After all, Mexico has quite an effective policy regarding illegals. Perhaps we could learn something from them. </p>
<p>And while having the chance to ask for advice, he could also have asked the Wise Latino just how Mexico is uplifting the quality of life of its own &#8216;community&rsquo; so that they will not have to mass-migrate by jumping their neighbor&rsquo;s fence to escape their own homeland&rsquo;s misery.</p>

		<p>24 Passing By:</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re in the middle of a unhappy political coincidence.</p>
<p>The center-right of the Mexican body politic, represented by the current and last Presidents from the PAN Party, Calderon and Fox, and both the establishment center-right and establishment center-left of the American body politic, as symbolized by most Republican Party and Democrat Party Presidents and many statewide office holders, match up rather well.  The PAN wants to rid Mexico of lower class peasants to guarantee its own political future, and the U.S. elite Rs and elite Ds gladly welcome them for different but concurring reasons.</p>
<p>The obvious solution is either a change in the American body politic so that either an old time left-populist mentality of a Samuel Gompers or even the Walter Mondale/Ralph Abernethy/Cesar Chavez that actually protested illegal immigration at the Mexican border in the late 1960s (!) coming to power (highly unlikely now), or a populist right of the Buchanan mold coming to power (less unlikely).  And in Mexico, the leftist parties like the PRI/PRN need to win elections   &mdash;   They want their Mexicans in Mexico for very obvious reasons.  The flaw in that theory, though is that U.S. Mexicans can vote in Mexican elections, and Vincente Fox actually kicked off his 2000 campaign for the Mexican Presidency in Los Angeles.</p>

		<p>If Calderon maintained his side of the border then this wouldn&rsquo;t be an issue. But since he&rsquo;s a slob, Arizonans have to do the job that Mexicans won&rsquo;t! :) </p>

 &#8220;I think that our immigration policy ought to be exactly the same as in Mr. Calderon&rsquo;s country.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
I agree.  Absolutely!   I have maintained all along that we ought to adopt a policy that is strictly reciprocal. That way there could be no complaints from the other side.<br>
Nor could &#8220;human rights&#8221; agencies blame us while ignoring Mexico.</p>

<p>Yes, they want them HERE (working and sending dollars back home), but to have them voting THERE.</p>
<p>But that little &#8220;problem&#8221; could be remedied very easily, if we just had some guts. All the US would have to do is make it illegal to vote in a foreign election &hellip;. Do that and - bang!- they&rsquo;re deported. </p>
