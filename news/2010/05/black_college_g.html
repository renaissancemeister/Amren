<h1><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/forum/2010-05-11-column11_ST1_N.htm">Black College Graduates Face Bumpy Road</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>DeWayne Wickham, USA Today, May 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In his first commencement speech as president to a black college, President Obama talked about the importance of education to graduates of Hampton University, a school that was founded in the wake of the Civil War just a short distance from where the first slave ship landed on these shores 249 years earlier.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} When it comes to educating African Americans, schools such as Hampton do the heavy lifting. While they graduate nearly 25% of blacks who earn undergraduate degrees, the nation&rsquo;s 105 historically black colleges and universities have produced the lion&rsquo;s share of black professionals. More than half of the students who get their undergraduate degrees at these schools go on to attend a graduate or professional school, according to the United Negro College Fund.</p>
<p>But the ugly truth is that the road to success that the degree they&rsquo;ve earned was supposed to open up is littered with potholes that their education alone cannot overcome. This year, blacks who have earned a bachelor&rsquo;s degree and higher have a higher unemployment rate than whites who have only obtained a two-year college degree. And blacks with college degrees earn substantially less than white college graduates.</p>
<p>In 2008, the mean annual income of blacks with a four-year degree was more than $13,000 less than that of whites with the same level of education. And blacks who had a master&rsquo;s earned about $1,500 a year less than whites with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree.</p>
<p>Obama might have had some of this in mind when he told Hampton&rsquo;s graduates the education they received has had the effect of opening their minds to the broader world beyond their campus and then added: &#8220;But now that your minds have been opened, it&rsquo;s up to you to keep them that way. And it will be up to you to open minds that remain closed.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is those closed minds, I suspect, that are largely responsible for the potholes that ratchet up the unemployment rate of black college graduates and keep down their earnings. {snip}</p>

		<p>My organization has hired many blacks with BAs and the fact is they cannot write, they cannot speak and they cannot reason.  A Bachelor&rsquo;s degree is worth less than a 1955 high school diploma.  The way they fill out the job application tells you just how awful they will be as employees.<br>

		<p>Say, could it be that those &#8220;historically black colleges&#8221; (where are the historically <i>White</i> colleges?) don&rsquo;t have the highest academic standards in the world?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Hampton University, a school that was founded in the wake of the Civil War just a short distance from <b>where the first slave ship landed on these shores 249 years earlier</b>.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>And this little historical tidbit is relevant to the rest of the article&hellip;how?  Oh, I&rsquo;ve got it!  To make sure all the White lemmings out there understand that it&rsquo;s Oppression, Racism and the Legacy of Slavery (c) that&rsquo;re keeping the black man down.  It&rsquo;s <i>never</i> the fault of blacks themselves.</p>

		<p>In my experience, the majority of blacks in college (with whom I graduated) make no attempt to alter their dress and speech patterns to conform with the mainstream white collar society they ostensibly seek to enter with their degree.</p>
<p>Dressing sensibly and speaking coherently would be &#8220;akkin white&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I am taking a few classes at the local community college.  A black guy, an obvious transplant from LA, or some larger city, hardly shows up for class, but when he does, he tries to answer questions and is always way off.  He and another woman constantly complain to the teacher because they are not doing well.  Another case, a Chinese woman, cannot hardly speak English.  She is or course, failing the class so far, or barely passing at best.  All these people display the attitude that they are owed a pass because they are in minority groups.  It is obvious to me that to them being in a &#8220;proteced group&#8221; means that they don&rsquo;t have to try so hard.  After four years that same attitude of entitlement is there, with all the &#8220;got it made&#8221; attitude on top.</p>
<p>So what does a four year degree mean to an employer when it comes with all that?  As a one time employer myself, I can clearly see problems with employees and lawsuits galore at every turn.  Can you say, &#8220;improper termination?&#8221;  Once they get in, it is very difficult to get rid of them.</p>

<p>OK I will have to go on memory here, but if I remember correctly the first group of blacks that landed in VA were indentured servants, not slaves.  The dates seem right here.  </p>
<p>1865 - 249 = 1616.<br>
1860 - 249 = 1611.</p>
<p>Hasn&rsquo;t it been said that whites were not slaves but indentured servants?  <br>

		<p>Any data on SAT scores at historically-black colleges compares to SAT scores of blacks elsewhere?  </p>
<p>Maybe the students who would pull up the employment rate are off at other schools.  A black with a good SAT math score will be recruited by a mainstream school.  A black with a 1300 SAT score is going on full scholarship to an Ivy League school, or MIT, or other premier institution.  One of the most closely-held secrets in universities is what the SAT scores of blacks on scholarship are, compared with what whites and Asians had to score to receive a full scholarship.  This is discussed often by Thomas Sowell, who argues affirmative action mismatches blacks and whites.  A black in the 90th percentile in SAT math would graduate with honors from the local university.  Instead, he is recruited to a place like MIT.  If he goes to MIT, he&rsquo;s in classes where everyone else has is in 99th percentile in math.  He&rsquo;s always behind, gets a C, and drops out.</p>
<p>Walter Williams also rails against mismatching blacks in &#8220;<a>Academic Mismatch I</a>.&#8221;  He writes that admitting a black to a top-tier law school, instead of one he can cope with, makes in more likely the student will drop out or not be able to pass the bar exam.  </p>
<p>Finally, if half go on to graduate school, how many of those are to graduate degrees in education, public policy and other tracks to government jobs, and how many in medicine, business, engineering, and other areas that are entrepreneurial?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Unemployment for blacks with BAs higher than for whites with two-year degrees.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nobody wants to hire a black with an AA degree he can barely read.  Come on!</p>
<p>People know blacks DO NOT earn accreditation, but are given it as part of the plan to keep them from rioting.</p>
<p>Having a degree but reading at an eighth grade level and doing math at a 6th grade level doesn&rsquo;t impress masny employers.</p>
<p>They have been hiring them when times were good as a part of private AA policy, but the money isn&rsquo;t there now.</p>
<p>Next headline to cry over:  &#8220;BLacks are first to be laid off in corporations across country!&#8221;<br>

		<p>So why do white college grads earn more than their black counterparts?     Three guesses:</p>
<p>1. The white grads are far more likely to start up their own businesses</p>
<p>2. As Eric (#1) noted, the whites are more likely to get their degrees in high-earning vocations like engineering and medicine while the blacks take up teaching in pursuit of a &#8220;gubmint job&#8221; </p>
<p>3. Many employers know that blacks and hispanics are often handed unearned affirmative action diplomas because the school had a quota to fill. </p>

		<p>This is such nonsense. Basically, the article implies that once ANYONE receives a college degree from ANYWHERE then total equality is exists in both intelligence and potential of the degree holder. So when blacks do poorly or cannot compete after graduation in what is really an ultra-competitive marketplace then it must be racial discrimination.  </p>
<p>For example, Tyrone, the proud black studies graduate of some third-rate doofus HBC, is equal to a white student who double-majored in marketing and accounting at the University of Wisconsin. Who would you hire if your small-to-medium-sized company needed to grow and prosper? The sad part is that everyone knows this but no one will say it?</p>
<p>Really, if a black could perform well and make money for an employer, he/she would be retained and promoted. In America, ultimately, performance is the bottom line. Because most American companies do not have the extra cash that Fortune 500 corporations can waste on PR-based affirmative action hires, the overall statistics tell the real truth. </p>
<p>Many of us now are getting more than tired with excuse after excuse for black failure when it is really black inability. </p>

		<p>This is just another one of those silly articles that pretends that a BA in black studies from a historically black college is somehow equivalent to a BA in electrical engineering from MIT.  The truth is that the policy of extreme egalitarianism (&#8220;everybody should go to college!&#8221;) has resulted in many universities (not just historically black ones) dumbing down the curriculum to the point where a BA means less than a high school diploma did 50 years ago.  So it shouldn&rsquo;t be a surprise that a BA in some soft subject is no guarantee of a high income. </p>

		<p>You can graduate with a BA or BS with all C&rsquo;s, and at some institutions even a few D&rsquo;s, or classes which you can take on a simple pass/fail basis (passing being 51%, or 60% depending on the institution). </p>
<p>I had many conversations with black students during my undergrad work that consisted of: Me: &#8220;Don&rsquo;t you find this class stressful?&#8221; Black student: &#8220;Only if you are trying to get more than a C.&#8221; These folks obviously had no ambition of going on to graduate level work, and they would be in a for a shock at never being able to get a C again if they did. </p>
<p>My view may be more jaded because of being a hard sciences major (once you got past the &#8216;intro to&rsquo; type classes, blacks virtually disappeared). Maybe the blacks going on to graduate work are getting business degrees, or black studies degrees?). I can think of only a handful of black undergrads that had the skills for graduate work. </p>
<p>Aside from the &#8216;C&rsquo; students, the other things that stood out with the black students was the lack of manners, and that many of them could not speak, and write in English clearly. I walk with a cane sometimes, and I frequently used the handicapped door because of it. If I hit the button to automatically open the door, the vast majority of black students would pour the other way through it rather than allow a disabled student to enter. It didn&rsquo;t matter if there was a person in a wheelchair trying to get through. Sometimes they would even cut in front of the person in the wheelchair going in as well. Simple courtesy was beyond the grasp of the vast majority of black students I encountered. I often felt like &#8220;Introduction to Manners and Basic Social Graces 101&#8221; should have been a required course. Many of them could have benefited from remedial speech, and writing courses. (I&rsquo;m sad to say that even at the graduate level, and in medical school some of these deficits exist in the small numbers of black students present.)</p>
<p>I met some exceptions along the way, and one that I would be happy to work with, and would happily hire anywhere I go, but the majority of black students I encountered are severely lacking in: manners, work ethic, long range planning, and basic communication skills. </p>

<p>I have to agree with Obama here:</p>
<p>the only way to convince people that blacks are intelligent, confident, efficient, hard-working, model employees is for black people to BE!!! intelligent, confident, efficient, hard-working, model employees.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a big difference between a degree from Hampton, and a degree from Harvard. Or even LSU. </p>
<p>But aside from academic standards, there are other issues that cloud the comparison that USA is trying to make. Like criminal records and incarceration. I&rsquo;d be willing to bet that a black with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree, from a decent school, with a good GPA, with no criminal record, can probably earn MORE than his white counterpart. He will be highly sought out by companies that want to show their diversity, and he can command a higher price just because he is so rare.</p>

		<p>If whites with two-year Associate&rsquo;s Degrees have better employment prospects than blacks with BA&rsquo;s, this is likely because whites in two-year programs study things like welding &amp; pipefitting, nursing, machining, auto mechanic work, etc.  Those two-year degrees are generally in skilled trades, and even in a sour economy, people still need their cars fixed and hospital patients still need care.  A black studies BA teaches the student no genuine skills, and in a recession functionally illiterate AA window dressing is not much in demand as companies try to reduce expenses.</p>

		<p>If a black person&rsquo;s I.Q. were on par with a white person&rsquo;s I.Q. there would be neither a need, nor a desire, for a &#8220;black college.&#8221; Moreover, &#8220;affirmative  action&#8221; would have long ago been relegated to the attic of &#8220;historical anachronisms&#8221;. </p>
<p>It is beyond cavil that some blacks are quite bright; but, to extrapolate this extremely small percentage of intellectually superior blacks into infering that the population of blacks as a whole is correspondingly quite bright defies everyday observations and common sense. </p>
<p>The reason that blacks are not hired out of black colleges is because, as Randy said in his song: &#8220;they went in dumb and came out dumb too&#8221;!     </p>
