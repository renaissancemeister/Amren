			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Julie Ray, Gallup, May 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Despite frequent news of drug war-related deaths in Mexico, Gallup polls show the average Mexican is less likely than those in several other Latin American countries to say a close friend or relative was murdered in the past year. Five percent of Mexicans interviewed in August 2009 said someone close to them was murdered in the past 12 months  &mdash;  about average for the region.</p>
<p>Drug- and gang-related deaths in Mexico&rsquo;s nearly four-year drug war surpassed 22,000 this year, but the country&rsquo;s homicide rate is lower than it was a decade ago. Mexico&rsquo;s homicide rate (11.6 per 100,000 in 2008) is still lower than those in other countries such as Colombia (38.8 per 100,000 in 2007), where residents are among the likeliest to say a friend or relative was murdered. Other Latin American countries with significant percentages claiming this  &mdash;  the Dominican Republic (14%), Brazil (11%), Venezuela (10%), and Honduras (10%)  &mdash;  tend to have relatively high homicide rates. [The homicide rate per 100,000 for the United States is 5.4.   &mdash;  ed.]</p>
<p>Gallup found Mexicans (5%) and Colombians (5%) are similar, however, regarding the number who report a friend or relative was kidnapped within the past 12 months. But Dominicans are more likely than Colombians or Mexicans  &mdash;  or anyone else in the region  &mdash;  to report this.</p>

And do note what is left unsaid:  that all of those countries mentioned above, which exceed or equal Mexico, have a large black proportion in the population.  Interesting that it does not mention Argentina, Uruguay, or Chile   &mdash;   stable countries with white populations.</p>

		<p>These stats can be a little misleading in that the places where the murders are super high are concentrated in only a few areas such as the border towns of Mexico with their drug problems. As far as Colombia goes I live there 3 months a year and see no violence, in fact I think its a great place to be. But I live in a high class area, a suburb of Medellin called Poblado. The population is professional and overwhelmingly white. I am not sure the population of Poblado but its a big city in itself and has to have at least 3-400,000 residents. There were just 6 murders there all last year making it far safer than just about any American city. Colombia has a terrible reputation from 20 years ago but now is safe in the cities. The murders do happen but in the poor barrios primarily among drug dealers/users fighting for turf. </p>
<p>   The previous poster noted Chile Uruguay and Arg. I completely agree with his hypothesis.  Although Medellin is my place of choice, I think that a lot of us need to look to parts of Latin America as a place to run if things go bad in the USA. Much of Latin America has not been hit as hard by the recession due to the fact some of the countries, not all, have economic policies that are good for the country, low or no debt, and a surplus instead of deficit. Colombia has both. No deficit spending and more exports than imports. A sensible right wing government, at least today as elections are coming and a left wing candidate has a good amount of support but at this point still is not projected to win. If he wins I may have to look harder at Chile, Uruguay or Arg,, although Arg has a long history of lefty presidents, the Peronists. Arg also has a lot more economic and political problems than more right wing Chile and Uruguay.  Kingfish </p>
