			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Sunnucks, Phoenix Business Journal, May 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Phoenix business executive wore a pro-immigration law T-shirt to Game 2 of Los Suns against the Spurs on Wednesday night. The executive was hassled over the shirt by Suns security but was later allowed to return to his seats behind the San Antonio bench, and he was allowed to still wear the shirt.</p>
<p>Jim Clark, CEO of Republic Monetary Exchange in Phoenix, got two seats to Game 2 and decided to don an orange shirt that read &#8216;Viva los 1070&rsquo; for the game. Clark said a friend who has a professional security background also wore the shirt. It was in response to the Suns&rsquo; opposition to Arizona&rsquo;s immigration law (Senate Bill 1070).</p>
<p>The Suns wore &#8220;Los Suns&#8221; jerseys for Game 2 in protest of the immigration bill. Clark supports the immigration bill and does not like the Suns&rsquo; public stance against the measure</p>
<p>Clark said he and his friend were approached by security guards early in the game at US Airways Center and asked to take the shirts off or turn them inside out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said, &#8216;No, I&rsquo;m not going to do that,&rsquo;&#8221; said Clark. Republic, based in Phoenix, deals in precious metals and offers investments in gold and silver.</p>
<p>Clark said the security guards then removed him and his friends from their seats, but they were later allowed to return after discussing the matter with the Suns&rsquo; security director.</p>
<p>They were allowed to keep their pro-1070 shirts on right-side out. Clark said he later received a call from Suns president Rick Welts, who apologized for the incident and is giving Clark four seats to the next 10 Suns games. Clark said Welts still defended the Suns&rsquo; stance against the immigration bill.</p>
<p>The Suns did not comment on the episode. Clark said he plans on wearing the pro-1070 again, and he might print up some more shirts to sell.<br/>

		<p>If SB 1070 would have never passed, then far many fewer people would have been offended by the &#8220;Los Suns&#8221; jersey stunt, because they would have attributed it to Cinco de Mayo.  But since the team brought politics into it, then they shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised when opponents also bring politics into it.</p>
<p>Though my idea of a political statement would have been not to go to the game and ask for a refund on the tickets.</p>

		<p>He should sell them at cost, with the goal of having all the buyers wear the shirts to a game on the same day.  It may not make much difference regarding the immigration law, but it might send a message to sports teams to stay out of politics.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s going to have to sell something, because the people whobuy gold and silver do not do business with radical leftist fools, so I hope he makes his idiotic views known to them.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ll writ him an email to let him know that I&rsquo;d never buy anything from him and let him know I think his business fails.</p>
<p>With 70% of Arizonans in favor of the law, I doubt he&rsquo;s going to sell many shirts either.  Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a shame if he had to go on welfare?</p>

		<p>I have to agree with poster number 2&hellip; The old adage Money Talk, and well you know what walks.</p>
<p>This man more than likely has the money and connections to make a stink.  If it had been me or you we probably have been beating up and maced by security in some back room and then carried out.</p>
<p>That being said, I take my hat off to this man.</p>

		<p>Clark should actually bury the hatchet, so to speak.</p>
<p>A fine gesture, in my opinion, would be to give the tickets to some deserving citizens. I would think these poor oppressed peoples who are being so scrutinized these days, would be a fine way of showing his compassion. </p>
<p>Myself, I would gladly buy these fine folks a couple rounds during the pregame &amp; get that warm feeling as I would watch them on national TV. The very thought of filling the seats behind the &#8220;Sols&#8221; bench with these fine representatives of upstanding cultural value is something to behold. </p>

		<p>I hope the Suns eschew hyprocrisy and adopt the same rules for getting into a basketball game as they want the US to adopt for getting into the country. From now on, anyone who sneaks into a game without a ticket gets to stay.  No ushers can ask anyone for their ticket stub, even if they suspect they are gate crashers.  Anyone who sneaks is is entitled to any giveways, and should be provided with free beer and hot dogs if they say they can&rsquo;t afford it.  If anyone has a baby during the game, they are automatically awarded season tickets.</p>

		<p>Good job. Security guards have no business trying to suppress political speech.</p>
<p>By the way, I&rsquo;m wondering if anyone has looked into the man who actually wrote SB 1070. A lot of attention has been given to the Arizona governor who signed the bill, but the man who wrote it has an interesting background. He is a professor of law who also has a history of challenging the ACLU. </p>

<p></p>
<p>Translation.  Since this was a man of wealth, influence and power, he basically told the security people that he would unleash his legal minions and easily win a multi-million dollar free speech lawsuit.  And that he would make sure every single peon involved in hassling him would lose their jobs.  He further assured them that, since the vast majority of people agree with him and not the Suns, the likely result would be nobody coming to their games anymore, once they found out about how he was treated (and he had the resources to make sure lots of people found out).</p>
<p>Once they figured out who they were dealing with, they got down on their hands and knees and kissed his butt&hellip;.and made sure to call their bosses so they could call him up and apologize.</p>
<p>I am quite sure, had this been an average person, the outcome would have been quite different.  However, I am glad to see an incident where the interests of the average person is aligning with the interests of the wealthy and powerful.  If for no other reason than such people learn the truth about such things.  Too many rich people doing as much as they can to flood the country with mexicans, not understanding the consequences.</p>
<p>We need more of this.</p>

		<p>This all started with a rancher named Robert Krenz, residence of Arizona. He was murdered by illegal immigrants whom left a foot print trail back to Mexico across the border from his property. He was left for dead when authorities found him sitting up in his car or atv with a bullet hole between his eyes. I don&rsquo;t blame anybody for this. I blame the United States for not enforcing our immigration laws :( and the Federal Government for not securing our borders in Arizona. I hope not for amnesty because we have already granted it to 3 million immigrants in 1986 under Regans term. Now&hellip; we are looking at over 20 years later with 4 times as many here now ILLEGALLY (12 million) who want the red carpet treatment. Anybody notice the crime rate and kidnapping SPIKE in Phoenix AZ over the last 3 years? I see profiling to be irrelevent when there is evidence that roughly shows that 99% of these crimes are commited by mexicans. Wow, I can go on on &hellip;. please email at junglist562@hotmail.com if you disagree, please elaborate to me why this is racists?  Are there Canadians commiting crimes, kidnapping, or drug smuggling in Montana, Washington? No, and if they were AB 1070 I&rsquo;m sure would be immplimented there too. Every Country in the world requires you to have a photo ID on you and if you can&rsquo;t provide that, you go to jail, black, white, hispanic, whatever. PEOPLE, please research the topic more before saying its racists. THANK YOU &amp; GOD BLESS AMERICA</p>
