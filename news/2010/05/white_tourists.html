			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Asian News International (ANI), May 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The safety of white tourists visiting South Africa for the upcoming FIFA World Cup is under a cloud. There are fear that they could be this summer&rsquo;s easy targets of racial violence and may even lose their lives in the process.</p>
<p>The brutal murder of white supremacist leader Eugene Terreblanche has brought South Africa&rsquo;s simmering racial tensions to the fore.</p>
<p>Over 900,000 white people have fled the country since the onset of racial violence, though there are a few who hace decided to stay behind and fight.</p>
<p>Fifty-one-year-old Lita Fourie is one of those who stayed. She maintains a memorial in remembrance of white farmers who have been murdered as a result of racial violence. Over 3,400 crosses stand sepulchrally along a hillside bearing testimony to years of racial slaughter.</p>
<p>Her own parents were brutally murdered by farm-hands and she lives in constant state of fear so much so, that she has even taught her five-year-old son Neels how to use a hunting rifle. She warns tourists to stay away from the world cup extravaganza for the sake of safety.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want everyone to know what is really going on, I think FIFA want to keep this quiet. Every day there is a murder, sometimes three a day. We don&rsquo;t feel safe here. And it is irresponsible of the organisers to play down the risks and dangers to white football fans.&#8221; She told News of The World.</p>
<p>Another victim of racial brutality, Sophia Aucamp, echoes Lita&rsquo;s view, she recognizes that the violence is not just racially motivated, a lot of the time the perpetrators are looking to make a quick buck at the expense of someone&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Football fans will come with lots of money, cameras and mobile phones and people here won&rsquo;t give your life a second thought for a nice watch,&#8221; she told the paper. &#8220;South Africa is not safe for anyone right now. It could turn nasty. FIFA could end up with a very embarrassing situation if fans are murdered.&#8221; she concludes forebodingly.<br>

		<p>Yes, that will be embarrassing for the dead Whites who went to S.A. </p>
<p>Expecting naturally violent black south africans to adhere to the Rights of Man, etc., and then getting killed when africans stay true to themselves by killing you surely will be embarrassing for the stupid Whites.</p>
<p>As a White, I&rsquo;m embarrassed already for being related to such stupid White people. </p>

		<p>The liberals will say that the White tourists were killed while assauting the blacks. Why yes, that 70yr. old White grandmother was killed trying to rob those 10 black yuf! They HAD to kill her because she kept hitting them while they were going through her purse and pulling off her cloths. &#8220;She was fittin ta mess up ma grillll!&#8221;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very embarrassed to be a White person still residing in S.A. where the blacks have gone beserk and are killing us all. I&rsquo;m very embarrassed that I don&rsquo;t have enough respect for my White self to get out of S.A. during the emergency, which is forever.<br>
I&rsquo;m very embarrassed that I don&rsquo;t know how to protect myself from african on White violence.</p>

		<p>Two things can happen here. EIther there will be no more mayhem and murder than usually happens in the U.S. after Super Bowl or there will be so much of it that the black SA government can&rsquo;t cover it up and it will be up to the U.S. to cover it up as they do black on white crime in the U.S. I think there is a black staffed government agency that does the black on white crime cover ups:)</p>

		<p>&#8220;liberals will say that the White tourists were killed while assauting the blacks&#8221;</p>
<p>That, or that the white victim was a racist or it was a racially charged situation or there were racial &#8216;tensions&rsquo;. Making it seemed deserved or a conflict. </p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s going to sound like hyperbole, but that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s called in the media when whites are attacked and even killed by blacks, &#8216;racial tension&rsquo;. And it&rsquo;s made out to be the fault of whites. </p>

		<p>White South Africans have always known how to protect ourselves. We have done so for 350 years against all forces. The end of Apartheid meant giving up that right to protect ourselves. I am sure that if the 1992 referendum had been worded in such a fashion, most, if not all would have voted against it. Instead it was worded. Do you want the National party to continue to negotiate with the ANC? That was it folks. We were betrayed by our leaders, much like you are currently being betrayed by yours.</p>
<p>When South Africa falls to chaos, white South Africans will finally have the opportunity to defend themselves. Right now it is the ANC government and the liberals that tie both our hands behind our back. Once this falls, all bets are off and the true war will begin. Remeber, us South Africans, have had a true initiation into the workings of the black. We may be grossly outnumbered, but we are not outmatched. </p>
<p>The world cup will be interesting, no doubt about that. However, the true test will come afterwards.</p>
<p>Thanks CSA</p>

		<p>Interesting that it took a news organization called Asian News International to report the truth about black on White violence and racism without bias.</p>
