			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FAIR Legislative Update, Federation for American Immigration Reform, May 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One week after Arizona Governor Jan Brewer signed a tough immigration enforcement measure into law, amnesty forces are scrambling to organize protest rallies, boycotts, and file lawsuits. Despite the fact that a large majority of Arizonans support the law (64%) and that Arizona Governor Jan Brewer&rsquo;s approval ratings jumped sixteen points after signing the law, many groups and individuals from outside the state and even outside the country are voicing their opposition. (The Washington Post, April 29, 2010; Rasmussen Reports, April 28, 2010). Joining in the fray, President Obama, Attorney General Eric Holder, and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano also sent a clear message that the will of the people in Arizona is irrelevant, as the federal government prepares an attack on the popular state law.</p>
<p>To that end, President Obama last week directed a team of top government attorneys from the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to devise a plan to challenge the Arizona immigration law. (Los Angeles Times, April 29, 2010). This is an extraordinary step, as it is so rare for the federal government to directly challenge a state law even constitutional law experts are unable to cite a comparable example. (The Washington Post, April 29, 2010). Nevertheless, hoping to prevent the law from taking effect and to discourage other states from enacting similar measures, the administration is reportedly exploring different options. These include filing a lawsuit against the state or joining a lawsuit brought by special interest groups who are claiming the bill unfairly targets Latinos. (Los Angeles Times, April 29, 2010). One possible legal ground they are exploring is the doctrine of &#8220;preemption&#8221;  &mdash;  which they would use to argue that the state&rsquo;s law illegally intrudes on immigration enforcement, which they argue is solely a federal responsibility. (The Washington Post, April 29, 2010).</p>
<p>However, if the Obama Administration argues the doctrine of preemption applies, it could expose the fact that the Administration has wholly abandoned its responsibility to secure the border and enforce our immigration laws, ultimately forcing Arizona to enact the law. Indeed, supporters of SB 1070 argue that Arizona was left with no choice but to act after enduring years of the federal government&rsquo;s failure to secure the border. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) described the law a response to the federal government&rsquo;s inaction, &#8220;I think the frustration is that the federal government isn&rsquo;t enforcing the laws, so we&rsquo;re going to do it on the state level.&#8221; (The Hill, April 26, 2010). Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) said that his state had to pass a tough immigration law because Obama has failed to &#8220;secure our borders.&#8221; (The Associated Press, April 27, 2010). He added that the situation in his state is &#8220;the worst I&rsquo;ve ever seen.&#8221; </p>
<p>Further complicating Obama&rsquo;s plan is the fact that similar preemption arguments failed when Arizona passed a 2007 law that sanctioned employers for knowingly hiring illegal immigrants. Kris Kobach, a senior Justice Department official under George W. Bush who is now a constitutional law professor, said of a preemption challenge, &#8220;They tried this on for size already, and it failed.&#8221; (The Washington Post, April 29, 2010). Kobach, who helped draft the legislation, pointed out that the law does not seek to regulate immigration but merely adds state penalties for what are already federal crimes, and under the legal doctrine of &#8220;concurrent enforcement&#8221; states are allowed to ban what is already prohibited by federal law. (Los Angeles Times, April 29, 2010).</p>
<p>Amnesty forces have already filed two lawsuits challenging the Arizona bill. The first, filed by The National Coalition of Latino Clergy and Christian Leaders alleges that the measure usurps federal enforcement responsibilities. The second, filed by Martin Escobar, a Tucson police officer filed suit seeks prevent the law from going into effect. (Los Angeles Times, April 29, 2010). Tucson police spokesman Sgt. Fabian Pacheco said Escobar was not acting on the department&rsquo;s behalf. (The Washington Post, April 29, 2010).</p>
<p>Even the government of Mexico is getting involved. The Mexican government  &mdash;  battling drug cartels for control of territory along the Mexican border  &mdash;  ironically issued a travel warning urging Mexican citizens to be careful in Arizona and telling them to expect harassment and questioning. (Los Angeles Times, April 28, 2010). In addition, the mayor of Mexico City, Marcelo Ebrard, announced he would try to join the lawsuits seeking to overturn the law, stating that the measure is &#8220;a planned Apartheid against Mexicans.&#8221; Id. Ebrard was unable to explain how the Mexican capital could overcome its lack of legal standing in U.S. courts, but he did say the issue could be taken to international human rights forums. Id.</p>
<p>Others outside the state of Arizona, including the people of some cities in California, have reacted to Arizona&rsquo;s new law by calling for boycotts. (Los Angeles Times, April 28, 2010). Several members of the Los Angeles City Council signed a proposal for a boycott, calling for the city to &#8220;refrain from conducting business&#8221; or participating in conventions in Arizona. Councilwoman Janice Hahn, who coauthored the proposal, seemed unconcerned with the logistical complications of such a boycott and made the absurd statement that, &#8220;When people are asked to show their papers, it brings back memories of Nazi Germany.&#8221; Clearly Councilwoman Hahn is unfamiliar with current federal law, which for decades has required aliens to carry their immigration documents with them &#8220;at all times.&#8221; (8 U.S.C. ยง 1304(e)).</p>
<p>In addition, officials in the sanctuary city of San Francisco introduced a similar resolution and Mayor Gavin Newsom imposed an immediate moratorium on city-related travel to Arizona, with exceptions. The American Immigration Lawyers Association is reportedly moving its fall convention from Scottsdale to a new location. Members of the District of Columbia Council are also planning to introduce a resolution calling on the city government to boycott Arizona, though it is not clear if D.C. actually does any business with Arizona. (The Washington Post, April 28, 2010). In the face of these threats, Governor Jan Brewer has remained calm and has stated that she isn&rsquo;t concerned about possible boycotts. &#8220;I believe it&rsquo;s not going to have the kind of economic impact that some people think that it might.&#8221; (Los Angeles Times, April 28, 2010).</p>
<p>Indeed, there are many who are voicing support for the Arizona law and lawmakers in other states have been prompted to consider similar legislation around the country. In Utah, state Representative Stephen Sandstrom (R) is pushing an identical bill because Utah is &#8220;becoming a kind of sanctuary state.&#8221; (Los Angeles Times, April 29, 2010). Many illegal alien day laborers say they will leave Arizona because of the new law, and Jose Armenta, an illegal alien from Mexico, is already planning to move to Utah. (The Associated Press, April 28, 2010). Public officials in Ohio have asked Ohio Governor Ted Strickland to ensure that a similar law is passed in Ohio. (The Enquirer, April 27, 2010). Meanwhile, a group of state lawmakers in Oklahoma said they plan to introduce a bill similar to Arizona&rsquo;s and Texas State Representative Debbie Riddle plans to introduce a similar bill. Republicans running for governor in Colorado and Minnesota have also expressed support for the crackdown. (Id.)</p>
<p>There has been much misinformation about the content of the law since it was first reported, perpetuated by many in the national media who continue to get the facts wrong. Last Thursday, weeks after the bill was passed by the Arizona House, The Washington Post reported that the &#8220;law criminalizes illegal immigration by defining it as trespassing and empowers police to question anyone they have a &#8220;reasonable suspicion&#8221; is an illegal immigrant.&#8221; (The Washington Post, April 29, 2010). Unfortunately the reporters at the Washington Post were looking at the wrong version of the bill. The language regarding trespassing was stripped from the bill weeks ago and a simple search of the bill as enacted reveals no mention of trespassing. (See FAIR&rsquo;s Summary of Arizona SB 1070). </p>
<p>Additionally, the Arizona law does not empower police with any more authority to stop individuals or any additional authority to question individuals about their immigration status. The Supreme Court has addressed numerous times the authority of law enforcement officers to do both. (See, e.g. Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968); Muehler v. Mena, 544 U.S. 93 (holding 9-0 that during a lawful detention, a police officer&rsquo;s inquiry about immigration did not constitute a Fourth Amendment intrusion and did not require reasonable suspicion.)) Instead, the Arizona law directs the police to attempt to determine someone&rsquo;s immigration status only after a lawful stop, arrest, or detention, and then only if the officer has a reasonable suspicion that the individual is an illegal alien. (HB 2162, amending SB 1070). As Andrew McCarthy put it, &#8220;Essentially, it criminalizes (as a state misdemeanor) something that is already illegal (namely, being present in the United States in violation of federal law), and it directs law-enforcement officers to, yes, enforce the law.&#8221; (National Review, April 29, 2010).</p>
<p><big><b>May Day Amnesty Rallies Turn Violent</b></big></p>
<p>Amnesty forces staged protest rallies and demonstrations across the country on May 1, International Workers&rsquo; Day. (The Washington Post, April 29, 2010). Such &#8220;May Day&#8221; rallies have become an annual ritual for special interest groups and amnesty advocates since 2006, when they came out to urge Congress to pass a sweeping amnesty bill. Arizona&rsquo;s recent crackdown on illegal immigration ignited a renewed sense of urgency, and protesters took to the streets to decry the new law and demand amnesty. (The Washington Post, May 1, 2010).</p>
<p>The rallies turned violent as thousands of marchers swarmed Los Angeles, hundreds gathered in Phoenix, and dozens were arrested in Washington, D.C. (ABC News, May 1, 2010). A rally in Santa Cruz turned into a riot when some of the masked protesters smashed storefront windows and painted graffiti signs on dozens of businesses. (NBC News, May 3, 2010). Bearing torches, they stormed the city&rsquo;s main street on Saturday night and vandalized at least 15 businesses, causing at least $100,000 worth of damage. (San Francisco Chronicle, May 3, 2010). In San Francisco, ABC-TV affiliate KGO reported that May Day marchers attacked supporters of the Arizona law, punching and kicking them while calling them racists. (ABC News, May 1, 2010).</p>
<p>The protests resulted in arrests around the country, including the arrest of U.S. Congressman Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.), who was arrested along with 34 others who staged a sit-in in front of the White House. (The New York Times, May 1, 2010). It appears that Rep. Gutierrez had every intention of disobeying police orders and getting arrested as he wore a t-shirt that read, &#8220;Arrest me, not my friends.&#8221; (See The Hill, May 1, 2010) Amnesty advocates promised civil disobedience and they delivered violence courtesy of angry mobs gathered throughout the nation, all in the name of open borders.<br/>

		<p>One of the things I want to see about what Arizona is doing is if they choose to simply ignore the federal government.</p>
<p>This showdown with the states has been brewing for some time now.  The states say they are soveriegn and that the federal government is illegally co-opting their power and going against their will on a whole host of issues.  For decades now, the federal courts have shown that they are not legitimate.  They rule in favor of federal abuse of power, NO MATTER WHAT THE LAW OR CONSTITUTION SAYS.  Their arguments are at best thin&hellip;..often bald faced lies.</p>
<p>In short, the result of any lawsuits and other court action has already been decided by corrupt judges who were placed on the bench to do exactly that.</p>
<p>Considering this, what exactly is the reason a state should listen to them?  Look at our Supreme Court&hellip;..obviously packed with those without even a shred of respect for the law.  Why exactly should the states, should anyone listen to them.  More to the point, what exactly is their mechanism for enforcement should the states simply declare they have no authority and ignore them?</p>
<p>The answer is none.</p>
<p>And once it begins, that will be it for the federal system.  It lacks legitimacy and combines the very worst elements of a rogue state and a collapsing, ineffectual government.</p>
<p>So.  I want to see.  The issue is already decided against Arizona.  All law is on their side as is all public opinion.  But that doesn&rsquo;t matter because a small group of fascists have co-opted the system and the law is what they say the law is.  And they don&rsquo;t want Arizona stopping illegals.</p>
<p>Will Arizona obey?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to think they have already decided that, long before they went public with this.  And the answer is no.  And it will start something in this country.  Something we&rsquo;ve needed for a very long time now.</p>

		<p>I can not emphasize this enough; once we send a relative handful of these invaders back to Mexico feet first the rest will follow on their own.  </p>
<p>Hispanic illegals will self-deport in mass rather than place their families at risk.  </p>
<p>So please stop acting as if all hope is lost and there is nothing we can do about illegals.  </p>
<p>It simply isn&rsquo;t true&hellip;</p>

		<p>Boycotts by Los Angeles, San Francisco, and the District of Columbia are undoubtedly forms of extortion.  They are also acts of aggression against the State of Arizona. </p>
<p>Is extortion ethical or moral when done to prevent a legitimate government from exercising its civil rights?  Is extortion practiced by tolerant, liberty loving people of good will? </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s being considered against Arizona could be called a conspiracy in restraint of trade.  It could also be called an embargo and, in it&rsquo;s broadest sense, a blockade. An embargo is an unfriendly act; a blockade is an act of war!</p>

		<p>Clearly, America is no longer a nation of laws.  I predict in the coming years that more states will rise up to overcome the tyrannical lawlessness of our Federal Government.  Arizona is only the beginning. I also predict that states will eventually succeed from the Union starting in the South.  Trust me, the Confederate flag will fly again.</p>

		<p>The US Justice Department can&rsquo;t be bothered to look into voter intimidation by Black Panthers, but has decided to go into overdrive against an American state doing the job the feds have been negligent in doing, protecting it&rsquo;s citizens. Can it be anymore clearer to everyone that the federal government of the United States of America doesn&rsquo;t give a damn about its citizens and puts the concerns of not only non-citizens, but people who shouldn&rsquo;t even be here in the first place ahead of the concerns of US citizens.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a MUST for AZ to hold on to their position and don&rsquo;t give it up for anything.  SOMEBODY has got to set the trend.  Once it&rsquo;s set, I think two things will happen:  (1) It&rsquo;s going to backfire on B.O., &#8220;outing&#8221; his basic unwillingness to do anything to secure the border because he wants the Hispanic votes, (how embarrassing), and (2) The other border states, seeing success in AZ, are going to follow-the-leader and enact identical legislation in their own states.  And I say IT&rsquo;S ABOUT TIME!!!</p>

		<p>The Arizona law is ALMOST identical to the federal law.  Obama and Holder both are not the brightest bulbs in the history of administration personnel, so I doubt that either of them have the intellect to really understand what the law is all about.  </p>
<p>If they were really bright, they would understand that the law was passed for the purpose of prompting the feds to protect the southern border.  But this ghetto bunch in right now just isn&rsquo;t operating on a high enough frequency to pick up on a lot of things.</p>
<p>Bush was pretty dense, and he revealed that many times on this issue of illegals, but he&rsquo;s beginning to look like he was definitely a cut above this president and his administration.</p>
<p>Holder and Obama are looking scarier and scarier with each passing day.  Ever notice the &#8220;What, me worry?&#8221; attitude of Obama even during serious, critical times when others would be a little shaken and very grim when particularly bad news came up?</p>
<p>Like most blacks, he acts like a child.</p>

		<p>The image of a country going to court to prevent its own laws being enforced is the height of absurdity.The opponents now claim that it is against your constitution,this is cherry picking,no mention of the constitution when it comes to ensuring that your president is &#8220;natural born&#8221;in fact in 49 states the legal obligations are strenuously ignored.This is the same strain of marxism that infests the entire western world,you may only say that which is in the marxist interest,you may only observe laws that are in the marxist interest.This is the way freedom dies.</p>

		<p>States may not discriminate against other states in matters of trade. Period. This is the sole legitimate purpose of the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. It is so often twisted and contorted to authorize everything from anti-porn laws to federal education funds.  </p>
<p>In this case, however, in which some states are legislating a boycott or a ban of Arizona, it should be used for it&rsquo;s intended purpose and the boycotting states, cities, or counties should be sued. </p>

		<p>The latin invaders and their allies did not &#8220;scramble&#8221; at all in attacking the Arizona law.  They have been lying in wait, ready to ambush anything like it and generate the propaganda war you see racing along the airwaves and through the internet.  They spent over a year delegitimizing the opposition.  They bought off Lou Dobbs, made Geraldo Rivera the voice of immigration &#8220;sanity&#8221; on Fox News, undercut the funding from VDARE, and, most notably for this message board, prevented American Renaissance from even meeting in public.  THEY are WINNING.</p>

		<p>I find it amazing that the President, the Attorney General, the head of Homeland Security, a couple of alert citizens and all the NYPD have combined forces to capture the Times Square would-be bomber. Has anyone seen a bit of interest in the millions of terorists who have occupied our country for decades? They too actually kill people, murder and injure citizens with their drunk driving. They rape, molest, steal, present false documents, names and fake IDS. How about them, Washington? Oh, I see&hellip; you need them to supply cheap labor to your business friends and see that their supporters vote for the fat cats. Well, we&rsquo;ll have to change all that in November at the polls, I guess.</p>

		<p>To paraphrase something I heard on Fox News Network, &#8220;Let me get this straight, according to the Obama Administration, if you don&rsquo;t have health insurance it will be considered a crime, but entering the country illegally is not.&#8221; The absurdity of liberalism.</p>
