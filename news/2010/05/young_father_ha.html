			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), May 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A young father was slashed across the face as his five-year-old son looked on in what claimed was a random &#8216;anti-white&rsquo; revenge attack sparked by the murder of an Asian teenager.</p>
<p>Reece Johnson told how he and his son, Tyrel, were walking with Mr Johnson&rsquo;s girlfriend when a mob of 20 Asian youths surrounded him.</p>
<p>He claims one of the youths said, &#8216;Your lot killed one of ours&rsquo;, before he was set upon.</p>
<p>The attack ended when one of the gang sliced open his left cheek with a craft knife.</p>
<p>As Tyrel screamed in horror, his father was left reeling with a giant gaping wound in his face which later needed 68 stitches.</p>
<p>Police are investigating whether the attack was sparked by the murder of student Saffer Khan, 19, by two white youths in the same area more than two years ago.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson, a labourer from Great Lever, near Bolton, today said: &#8216;My face is a mess but the fact is I&rsquo;m very lucky to be alive.</p>
<p>&#8216;The doctors told me if the blade had continued another few millimetres then it would have hit my jugular vein. The nurse said it must have been a very sharp blade, like a razor.</p>
<p>&#8216;She said another finger tip across my neck and that would have been it, I would have died. These guys picked on me for no other reason than because I was a white and killers of that young lad were white.</p>
<p>&#8216;It&rsquo;s just unbelievable. Obviously I had nothing to do with what happened to Mr Khan yet I was tarred with the same brush as the killers simply because of the colour of my skin.</p>
<p>&#8216;I&rsquo;m scarred for life now and people might look at me and think I?m a violent thug.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Johnson had been for a day out with the friends in Blackpool and was walking past the entrance of Bobby Heywood Park in Great Lever where Mr Khan was beaten to death by two teenagers in November 2007.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson said: &#8216;I was with my son and a girlfriend when this mob of 20 Asian youths came up to us. They were saying &#8220;Your lot killed one of ours&#8221;  &mdash;  meaning white people killed an Asian lad.</p>
<p>&#8216;One of the guys was acting aggressively and the group was swearing and hurling racist abuse. They attacked me because of the colour of my skin. They were very racist.</p>
<p>&#8216;I saw one of them in front of me with a small hand knife and I was watching him. But then another lad came at the side of me and punched me and that&rsquo;s when I was slashed.</p>
<p>&#8216;I was scared for my life. The lads who attacked me have no respect. My little son was with me  &mdash;  he&rsquo;s five years old and he was traumatised.</p>
<p>&#8216;He was screaming, clinging on to one of my friend&rsquo;s legs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Johnson was taken to a specialist facial unit at the Royal Blackburn Hospital on Saturday night. He was given 20 stitches inside his face and another 48 on the outside.</p>
<p>He left hospital at 6.30am on Sunday and is now recovering at his parents&rsquo; home.</p>
<p>The father-of-three said he and his girlfriend will now move home because they are scared to return to the area.</p>
<p>He said his son has been badly affected by the attack.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson added: &#8216;Tyrel was very upset, he was hysterical. He woke up the other night crying. That is not normal for him. There are people in the community that know who has done it but it is whether they are brave enough to admit it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A Greater Manchester police spokesman said: &#8216;The 23-year-old man had been out with his girlfriend when he was confronted by a group of up to 20 youths.</p>
<p>&#8216;An argument broke out and during this, the man was slashed across the left cheek, suffering a six-inch wound. Inquiries are ongoing.&rsquo; A 16-year-old was arrested but later released without charge.</p>
<p>Mr Khan was kicked to death by 18-year old Joseph Booth who ripped off an electronic tag he had been ordered to wear as a condition of his early release from jail.</p>
<p>Manchester Crown Court was told in the hours before the killing Booth had been on a boozing spree and after downing cheap cider simply broke open the tag and threw it away.</p>
<p>As the authorities alerted by a fault on the tag began a search for Booth, the teenager and a 15-year old boy began prowling the park looking for a victim to mug and ambushed Mr Khan who was punched kicked and and had his head stamped on.</p>
<p>Booth and the 15-year old were later jailed for life for murder.</p>

		<p>Please note:<br>
In Great Britain they call Pakistanis and Afghanis &#8220;Asians&#8221; because Asians means for many people &#8220;East Asians&#8221; and East Asians are not as criminal. That is a typical trick to make every race the same. It would be like they call Detroit a Asian crime.</p>

		<p>Whenever you hear the word &#8220;Asian&#8221; in connection with CRIME: gang violence, terrorism, drugs, rape, murder, etc., it really means &#8220;Pakistani or Bangladeshi Muslim&#8221;.  It never (and I mean NEVER) means Japanese, Korean, East Asian, or Indian (Hindu or Sikh).</p>
<p>Everyone in Britain knows this, but the PC media keeps using it.  How odd&hellip;</p>

		<p>WHAT! Revenge for an attack that happened over two years ago. It is amazing how far whites will go to make themselves believe that it was not just the fact that these Asians just attacked someone because they hate whites. No really. Two years ago. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to sound callous, but this guy could be the poster-boy for the smiling face of multi-culturalism.</p>
<p>This reminds me of another UK based  Pakistani gang revenge attack which I&rsquo;ve just recently read about.</p>
<p>Where the young randomly chosen victim the fifteen year old Kriss Donald was stabbed thirteen times, castrated (!), had his tongue cut out (!) and was then dosed with petrol and set alight, literally burning alive(!!)<br>
(I couldn&rsquo;t imagine a more horrific way of dying myself).</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Kriss_Donald" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Kriss_Donald</a></p>
<p>Then in a similar move to your would be Times Square, &lsquo;White man&rsquo; Pakistani terrorist, the perpetrators all fled back &lsquo;home&rsquo; to Pakistan.</p>
<p>In a twist, Britain&rsquo;s first ever Muslim elected MP who helped secure the no doubt hard, extradition of the Kriss Donald&rsquo;s murderers from Pakistan. Had to resign as an MP himself, due to the ongoing death threats he received from his fellow Countrymen (I&rsquo;m not talking about the native born Britons), for helping in this process.</p>
<p>&lsquo;MP who pursued racist killers to quit Commons after death threats&rsquo;<br>
http://tinyurl.com/38d36no</p>
<p>Apparently when this story was news, the BBC only televised its details on the Scottish National broadcast as opposed to UK wide, which is probably why I&rsquo;ve only recently heard of it.<br>
I didn&rsquo;t know about Amren in 2006 and it looks like this story was well covered here.<br>
http://tinyurl.com/2u4zwh9</p>
<p>Going back to the feature story today of the young father with son, who both will now wear the permanent scars from this attack, both emotional and literal.<br>
In regards to the facial scar, quite the conversation starter hey. What better warning sign and reminder could the father now possibly display to his wider circle of friends, family and co-workers as to the dangers of diversity?<br>

		<p>This was an act of terrorism but because a single person was attacked instead of a large number of people, it will be put under the prosaic category of &#8220;crime&#8221;.  The word &#8220;terrorism&#8221; gets everyone&rsquo;s attention, but the word &#8220;crime&#8221; is so hohum because we have always had crime. This way we cannot see the pattern of what is happening.  The media minimizes the problem by not putting all of the facts together.  So one person gets his face sliced today, a girl in some other city is raped a week later, someone else is beaten several days after that and at the end of the year it might add up to hundreds or thousands of Britons being senslessly attacked.  If hundreds of people were killed or injured in an explosion, all of the nation would realize that it was a terrorist attack.  But when the attacks come in drips and drabs, the public is kept in the dark about the true extensive nature of what is happening.  It is terrorism under the radar.</p>

		<p>This is the true face of racism in England. A young man attacked and nearly killed in front of his crying 5-year-old son for the crime of being white. But if whites in England were 1% as racist as they are portrayed, wouldn&rsquo;t there be mobs of whites randomly attacking Muslims for revenge?</p>

		<p>This sounds like the perp used a craft tool, a X-acto knife to do the cutting. That schmiss [scar] looks like what the German students desire when they duel with swords [they still do it!]. Jagged cut with a &#8220;tool&#8221; that is a deadly weapon but is legal to carry. NOT a weapon as defined by law. Similar to a box cutter as gang members carry. This slasher wielding the knife was up to no good and that was just an excuse to cite the previous incident from two years earlier.</p>

		<p>This is supposedly in response to an incident that happened two years ago? Talk about your holding a grudge syndrome. Yet the victims had nothing to do with that incident. Obviously these brilliant Asians are drawing down the supposed intelligence level of their race. Looks to me like just a bunch of genious Asian gang bangers trying to find an excuse to torture and kill a few whites for a thrill. The world against the whites, in the past it&rsquo;s been the whites having been the world champions. Now since so many whites are anti white, which is a true mental disorder, I fear the tables will turn. Watch your backs!</p>

		<p>It absolutely disgusts how the British media calls Middle Eastern Muslims &#8220;Asain&#8221;. You all know how violent and dangerous those Chinese and Korean math students are- attacking innocent victims with sharpened protracters!

<p>Wrong. They are called Asians because the first significant immigration from Asia was from Pakistan and India in the 1950s. The UK does not have a significant Japanese or Korean population and the Chinese are easily identifiable as such in the Chinatowns of Manchester and London. And the term is used to include Hindus and Sikhs.</p>

		<p>Whether American posters like it or not Pakistan and India are countries in Asia,and while there are many other constituent nations to the world&rsquo;s largest continent(at a stretch it could include Europe),the majority of &#8220;Asians&#8221; in the UK originate from the Indian sub-continent.In ancient times &#8220;Asia&#8221; was what we now call Turkey,so the inhabitants of Japan and the far east are in some ways less entitled to the epithet than middle easterners.I do however have the greatest sympathy for them in not wanting to be associated with those that we in England lazily describe as &#8220;Asians&#8221;</p>
