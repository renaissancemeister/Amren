<h1><a href="http://www.annarbor.com/news/black-student-only-field-trip-sparks-controversy-at-ann-arbor-elementary-school/">Field Trip for Black Students Sparks Controversy at Ann Arbor Elementary School</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Jesse, annarbor.com, May 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An Ann Arbor elementary school principal used a letter home to parents tonight to defend a field trip for black students as part of his school&rsquo;s efforts to close the achievement gap between white and black students.</p>
<p>Dicken Elementary School Principal Mike Madison wrote the letter to parents following several days of controversy at the school after a field trip last week in which black students got to hear a rocket scientist.</p>
<p>&#8220;In hindsight, this field trip could have been approached and arranged in a better way,&#8221; Madison wrote. &#8220;But as I reflect upon the look of excitement, enthusiasm and energy that I saw in these children&rsquo;s eyes as they stood in the presence of a renowned African American rocket scientist in a very successful position, it gave the kids an opportunity to see this type of achievement is possible for even them.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not a wasted venture for I know one day they might want to aspire to be the first astronaut or scientist standing on the Planet Mars.</p>
<p>&#8220;I also think it&rsquo;s important that you know that I have talked to the children who did not go on the field trip, and I think they have a better understanding of the purpose of the AA Lunch Bunch now, as I hope you do. I&rsquo;m sorry if any kids were upset by the field trip or my discussion afterwards with them, and I have let them know that.</p>
<p>&#8220;The intent of our field trip was not to segregate or exclude students as has been reported, but rather to address the societal issues, roadblocks and challenges that our African American children will face as they pursue a successful academic education here in our community.&#8221;</p>
<p>A handful of parents have complained to district administrators about the trip, the group and Madison. More than a half-dozen parents contacted AnnArbor.com to raise the complaints, but none would agree to talk on the record, citing concerns of reprisals to their children by Madison.</p>
<p>While there&rsquo;s no clear agreement between the two sides about exactly what happened, most of the controversy centers on a field trip taken last week by the Lunch Bunch for African American boys and girls to hear a black rocket engineer talk.</p>
<p>District spokeswoman Liz Margolis said after the trip was over, those who went returned to their fifth-grade class and were greeted by boos by those who didn&rsquo;t go on the trip. Margolis said Madison, who is black, heard the boos, and went to talk to the class. She said he and the class had a &#8220;discussion&#8221; about race issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;He wasn&rsquo;t yelling at them. He was very passionate about it,&#8221; Margolis said.</p>
<p>Parents have complained he was yelling at the class and belittled a Muslim girl who said she also had experienced racism and discrimination.</p>

		<p>Pardon my cynical mind, but I am guessing the rocket scientist in question is the diversity enforcement officer for a company full of rocket scientists, not a rocket scientist himself.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen lots of white doctors and lawyers practice their trade.  Yet, I&rsquo;m not a doctor or lawyer.  Seems like you have to do something more than just see someone practicing a profession in order to be able to succeed in that profession.  </p>

<p>Blacks and their friends in MSM can&rsquo;t even discuss them without calling them &#8220;renowned, pioneering, heroic, esteemed, iconic, etc.&#8221;</p>
<p>We all know that means &#8220;recipient of Affirmative Action Diversity Privilege&#8221; which cost a truly meritorious White American Citizen his earned job and career opportunities.</p>
<p>Hurting the rights and futures of Whites is what makes blacks &#8220;renowned&#8221;. </p>

<p>So not only are White students being discriminated against on account of their race, they&rsquo;re being terrorized by a black supremacist.</p>
<p>I get tired of asking this question, but here we go again: if the races had been reversed, would this incident have been buried in a small Michigan website?  We all know that there would have been a national media outcry against such Racist Hate, the offenders would have been fired at once and our Magic Mulatto would have devoted an entire speaking tour to the necessity of stamping out Racism.  <br>

		<p>Why are these kids even allowed to have a group in school that&rsquo;s based on race???  Where I taught, such a thing would never have been allowed.  The fact is, ALL the 5th graders could have benefited by hearing the rocket scientist, regardless of their ethnicity.  That is rank discrimination by that school and its principal, and he SHOULD be censured for it.</p>

<p>That is the real joke here, and a rather (if recently) archaic one!</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really fight wars or travel in space anymore with crude &ldquo;rockets;&rdquo; whites build: ICBMs, Guided Tactical Missiles, and Space Shuttles. Of course, blacks made it to Nubian &ldquo;greatness&rdquo; with such things in Egypt and on the Moon thousands of years ago, so what do I know?</p>

<p>Roadblocks? And who exactly set these roadblocks there? The word &#8220;roadblock&#8221; carries with it the implicit assumption that it was set there deliberately to impede or stop someone else&rsquo;s progress. </p>
<p>So who set these roadblocks? Of course we all know it was white people and white society, according to the standard explanation promulgated by the left to explain all black failure. </p>
<p>So now we have a school principal promoting this conspiracy theory that an evil cabal of whites is deliberately trying to block the success of honest, hard-working blacks. Great way to boost black or white students&rsquo; mental health, to tell them that their people are either the victims or the perpetrators of a vicious racist conspiracy. </p>
<p>Anyone  wonder why some students were apparently upset by this principal&rsquo;s talk?</p>

		<p>The white kids made out.  The black kids would have ruined the trip with their constant yakking, fidgiting, stealing of milk money and lunches, fighting on the bus, etc..  What the parents should be protesting is the principal giving the white kids a racial beat-down.  The district spokeswoman said he was &#8220;passionate&#8221; in his speech.  A &#8220;passionate&#8221; white man would be accused of terrorizing the children.  He should be forced to public ally apologize and recant!<br>

		<p>The principal is an idiot. He should be fired. What gives him the knowledge and power to decide which child goes on a field trip? This is blatant racism. </p>
<p>He also doesn&rsquo;t realize that it ironically, and publicly, makes blacks appear even more stupid than they are. For example, why are only black children going? Oh - because their test scores are so far below whites. Why see the BLACK rocket scientist? Because he is so rare - like a freak show. </p>
<p>Can the principal offer a cogent explanation as to how this field trip would have been any different if white children went along? Perhaps he was afraid the white students would be the ones asking the intelligent questions - embarrassing the black future rocket scientists.</p>
<p>And who is this famous black rocket scientist, anyway? He probably graduated from one of those elite historically black rocket science schools.</p>

		<p>Home school.  Get them OUT of the government schools.  They will receive nothing but indoctrination, victimization, beat downs, dumbed down classes, racial and religious persecution, and impediments.  Home school.  Then you can set your own field trips, AND it has been shown all across the nation that home schooled kids do better on Scholastic Achievement and Entrance exams than public school kids on average.<br>
It&rsquo;s time we let the Government run public schools fail the way the Liberal bastions of lunacy called cities and States are failing.  </p>

		<p>There is no such thing as an &#8220;achievement gap&#8221; between white and black students.  The global disparity that we have been witnessing for decades is an INTELLIGENCE GAP.  The average black IQ is 15 points lower than the average white IQ.  No amount of money, social programs, or politically correct speech can change that. </p>
<p>If the liberals truly care about black children, they would advocate segregation in our nation&rsquo;s schools so that each race can reach it&rsquo;s full potential at it&rsquo;s own pace. </p>

A neighbors high school student kid let me in on another one. &#8220;Disadvantaged&#8221;. The new school term for what we used to call poor. I asked him, &#8220;And who do you think they mean when they imply that someone is working against them and taken away their advantages?!?! </p>

		<p>A High School here in Northern California offers a trip to local college campuses for the students to check out. The trip is ONLY available to Latinos only. School buses are hard to come by for field trips and sports teams, but the Latinos some how always have one available to them.

		<p>Hey! That was my elementary school. In the 60s it was all white.  We had a Christmas tree and sang carols.  During the summer a story teller came to the playground for the Park Dept. and told Uncle Remus stories.  Later, when I was a high school senior, I learned about the government instituting busing to force integration.  I felt very mad about it, and said to myself, &#8220;If this is what&rsquo;s becoming of the country, I will never have a child, I don&rsquo;t want them to have to live in it.&#8221;  And I never did.</p>

<p>On a lighter note, there is a latino youth college support group out here that we white teachers are asked to work with and lend a hand to.  I keep thinking, why not support ALL kids who want to go to college?  Why race based helping?  Isn&rsquo;t that, ahem, racist?</p>

		<p>RE 7 The real travesty is that there are people in power who see no problem with this. They are clearly insane and/or racist against whites&hellip; and in charge.<br>
This is another example of a strange emotional release experienced primarily by liberals. The release occurs when they &#8220;self-disavow&#8221;; i.e., when they betray themselves as having deficiencies that merit correction, and to prove it enact laws that discriminate against their own racial group. Something out of Marxist self-criticism, I think. The sting is removed because the confessors, unlike the poor victims of Communism in the real, are wealthy Americans who can retreat after a hard day&rsquo;s work in group political therapy to the comfort of their suburban homes.<br>
 A &#8220;holier than thou&#8221; attitude then ensues after the redemptive act. This whole process is usually not shared with the ruled, otherwise known as the public. Secrecy is required because the hypocrisy is transparent. An army of smokescreeners,the MSM,is employed to assure this.</p>
