<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Susan Mwarabu apologized profusely and repeatedly Thursday before she was sentenced in Ramsey County District Court for biting off  &mdash;  and apparently swallowing  &mdash;  part of a man&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>{snip} Mwarabu {snip} lost her teaching job at Northfield Middle School after she was charged in the incident. It happened March 14 at the Uptowner Cafe in St. Paul.</p>
<p>Mwarabu, 31, of Rochester, pleaded guilty April 5 to felony third-degree assault. She did not know her victim, Christopher Hough, 33, before the incident. {snip}</p>
<p>District Judge Rosanne Nathanson gave Mwarabu a stay of imposition sentence and up to five years on probation. She was ordered to serve 60 days, but can do so on home monitoring or other programming if she is eligible.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nathanson gave Mwarabu until Sept. 2 to turn herself in after her attorneys requested she be able to visit her ill mother in Kenya before she reports to the workhouse.</p>

		<p>Wow, I would love to know the full story behind this episode. Is the newspaper hiding something?</p>
<p>My guess is that they were having an &#8220;honest discussion&#8221; of the &#8220;benefits of diversity&#8221; when the ear-biting incident happened.</p>
<p>This reminds me of a story covered on this site awhile back where a black male professor sucker punched a white female colleague in the face when their discussion on &#8220;civil rights&#8221; got a little too heated.</p>

		<p>I read the original article before it was posted here and I could not fathom why she did this.  Usually when something odd like this happens it is because the individuals got into some sort of fist fight.  Did this woman just have a cannibalistic urge to eat a white man&rsquo;s ear?  Things have become so bizarre in this country that I actually believe her natural Kenyan instincts just kicked in and on the attack she went.  I mean we do read about African albinos and white South Africans being butchered alive for body parts.  Could this have been her subconscious motivation?  I love diversity.<br>

		<p>I found more on this case including this from the police report:<br>
Mwarabu then approached the friend who made the comment and &#8220;leaned down, licked his face and appeared as if she was going to throw up,&#8221; the complaint said. The friend gently pushed her away. </p>
<p>Mwarabu then leaned toward C.R.H. and licked his ear. C.R.H. &#8220;moved her back from him,&#8221; according to the complaint, but Mwarabu leaned in again and bit off part of his ear. </p>
<p>Mwarabu&rsquo;s friends asked C.R.H., who was now bleeding, if he was OK. &#8220;He was in shock,&#8221; the complaint said.</p>
<p>As they left, one of C.R.H.&rsquo;s friends told police, he saw Mwarabu pick up the piece of C.R.H.&rsquo;s ear from the floor and put it in her mouth, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>This cannibal needs to be back in Kenya pronto! </p>

		<p>This is a truly bizarre story. I went out to the original site to see if they provided any more information about why the attack happened, but there was no explanation for it at all. The victim said that it didn&rsquo;t make any sense. From what I can tell, they didn&rsquo;t even know each other. For some odd reason, she apparently just attacked him in the street and bit his ear off. Later, in court, while she was &#8220;apologizing profusely,&#8221; she said &#8220;I disappointed myself, my family and hundreds of students.&#8221;</p>
<p>I guess so. I mean, if I was in middle school and one of my teachers attacked some stranger, bit off his ear and then swallowed it, I would probably be pretty disappointed in her myself. Luckily, however, we live in a forgiving society and it sounds like the judge is going to give her a break. If she is eligible, she can do her 60 days on &#8220;home monitoring or other programming&#8221; and if she complies with her probation&rsquo;s conditions, the conviction eventually will become a gross misdemeanor. Not only that, but they&rsquo;re going to let her go back to Kenya to visit her &#8220;sick mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>I guess biting some stranger&rsquo;s ear off on the street isn&rsquo;t that big of a deal anymore.</p>

<p>As if the barbaric practice of biting off (and consuming) the ear of another human being isn&rsquo;t outrageous enough, this story is filled with the unbelievable.</p>
<p>1. Susan Mwarabu had a teaching position before this incident? What, pray tell, was she teaching?</p>
<p>2. Visit her mother in Kenya? Since when does the judicial system allow a defendant being sentenced to leave the country prior to serving time?</p>

		<p>The article does not even attempt to explain why she did it.  The victim has no idea.  And now they are letting her leave the country (which is a high risk of flight).  </p>
<p>It is a shame what is happening to the United States.  There is no outrage anymore.  It is all ho hum.  No explanation given and no explanation needed why she bit someones ear off.  Her attorney no doubt then wrote an apology, but the apology offers nothing in the way of explanation.  The judge seems to go over backwards to be lenient.</p>

		<p>By the way, does Minnesota law specify that the penalty be indexed to the particular appendage bitten off and consumed? Is biting off, say, a nose thought to be a more outrageous affront to good table manners, and so more heavily punished,  than biting off an ear? If so, It would seem wise to formalize the matter by applying fixed values to every edible body part.  The law could be framed in a manner analogous to the old Germanic wergild:  Simply exact a monetary penalty from the cannibal and award it to offended (and mutilated) party.  $100 for an ear, $200 for a nose &mdash; and someone more skilled in evaluating body parts can figure out the relative worth of other appendages. The substitution of a monetary penalty for jail time would also have incalculable advantage of not interfering with anyone&rsquo;s ability to visit ailing relatives in Kenya or some other place where biting off an appendage may be a standard medical procedure and the sick person may actually need the services of an accomplished cannibal.</p>

		<p>Only 60 days of possible home monitoring for mutilating some random stranger? That&rsquo;s outrageously light considering the victim must now live with an ear deformity. How did this person come to have a job working in a school? Cannibals in St.Paul? Just doing the job Americans don&rsquo;t want to do, I guess.   </p>

		<p>This whole thing doesn&rsquo;t make any sense, especially the rather lenient sentence for such a horrid and primitive act. And how can you &#8220;apologize profusely&#8221; for biting off and eating part of a stranger&rsquo;s ear? This person should be in a mental institution. If there was any justice left in this crazy country, that mental institution would be back in Africa.</p>

		<p> Ah, this incident shows the enrichment of diversity. A previous posting mentioned how Minnesota was becoming a popular destination for African immigrants. It appears that some of these immigrants have folkways unknown to most Minnesotans, as well as &#8220;difficult to meet needs.&#8221; I&rsquo;m sure most people in Minnesota prefer diverse immigrants from Africa, rather than let&rsquo;s say&hellip; Norway? </p>

<p>The story makes total sense now. Apparently, the victim was in a diner around 3 a.m. He was sitting next to a table with four women. He said something to one of the women after noticing that she was &#8220;eating french fries&#8221; and the cannibal came over, licked his face, then chomped his ear off. Or something like that.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m reminded of a lesson repeated many times to me as a child interested in animals.  <br>
It was: Wild animals remain wild.  Always.  &#8220;Domesticated&#8221; describes species, not individuals.  If the individual animal is of a wild species, there is always a danger it will act according to its wild nature.  </p>
<p>So, this &#8220;lady&rsquo;s&#8221; mother is in Kenya?  The same Kenya from which hails the president&rsquo;s family (the side he&rsquo;s proud of, that is&hellip; the side it&rsquo;s both legal and fashionable to be proud of~ )?  </p>
<p>As for an unprovoked attack resulting in the loss of a body-part being punished by two months of sitting at home, and then being reducing to a misdemeanor, all after being allowed to travel to another country, on another continent~  Sorry for so much regurgitation of the report, but this is a hard one to keep down.  I&rsquo;m just shocked.  </p>

<p>Armin Meiwes&rsquo;s &#8220;victim&#8221; volunteered himself to be eaten after they met online and even ate some of his own privates at his own request before Meiwes killed and ate him some more. Meiwes gave his &#8220;victim&#8221; pain killers while he bled in the tub too. Meiwes even had other offers from other Germans for this event that he advertised online, but they backed down, and Meiwes left them alone because he didn&rsquo;t want to force anyone into doing this act.</p>
<p>I would say these acts DO say something about Germans in general: apparently, even the totally crazy Germans are civil, courteous, cleanly, and considerate and respectful of others&rsquo; wants and needs (even of their own &#8220;victim&#8221;).</p>
<p>As for the &#8220;Russians,&#8221; I suspect those 3 &#8220;Russian&#8221; criminals were Russian by citizenship only in a country of 140+ million people with approx. 150 indigenous ethnic groups where only 75-80% of the population are ethnically Russian.</p>
<p>But even if they were ethnically Russian (but I&rsquo;d bet not so Nordic looking), race isn&rsquo;t everything. Culture matters too as does economic conditions, etc. because we still share our basic humanity (whatever that is) as a species.</p>
<p>A generality is just what its definition entails, a characteristic that fits as a description much, if not most (but definitely not all or none), of the time for whatever is being described, but the question is how applicable, or to what degree is a generality fitting to most accurately portray a given anything; in other words, exactly how much is much or most of the time for this one?</p>
<p>The Kenyan of this article and the German you brought up probably do indeed tell a general truth about deviant behavior in those populations. Those generalities are just possibly more suited to reflect the intensity of that deviant behavior, and maybe not its propensity to be found in those respective populations.</p>
