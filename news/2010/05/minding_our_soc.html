<h1>Minding Our Societal Manners: When Human Rights Meet the School Lunch Room</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lysiane Gagnon, Globe and Mail (Toronto), April 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Damages of $17,000 awarded in exchange for a rude remark by a teacher? It appears that as long as there&rsquo;s the slightest hint of &#8220;racism,&#8221; whether it&rsquo;s real or perceived, one&rsquo;s chances of success at a human rights tribunal are good indeed.</p>
<p>The story in a nutshell: In April, 2006, Luc Cagadoc, then a seven-year-old Filipino boy, was allegedly told by a lunch-room monitor at his Montreal elementary school that he ate &#8220;like a pig&#8221; and was ordered to sit at a table by himself. The boy ate with a fork and spoon, in the Filipino tradition, and his slurping noises, as well as the spilling of food, disturbed the other kids. The school employees thought he was clowning with his food (which might have been true, since this is something many a seven-year-old boy likes to do). His mother was also reportedly told that Luc should &#8220;eat like a Canadian.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now these remarks certainly are, in today&rsquo;s parlance, insensitive. Yet I can&rsquo;t remember how many times I heard the expression addressed to youngsters by loving parents who wanted their child to learn table manners: &#8220;Stop eating like a pig!&#8221;</p>
<p>As for the remark about eating &#8220;like a Canadian,&#8221; the school board representatives maintain that nobody ever said that. But even if these infamous words had been uttered, would it have been a truly denigrating remark? It&rsquo;s a fact that young Luc was indeed in the process of becoming a Canadian, and that it&rsquo;s useful to learn the eating habits of the country you&rsquo;re living in.</p>
<p>In any case, Maria-Theresa Gallardo, the mother of the boy, was furious when her son reported the incident. She argued that eating with a fork and spoon was an integral part of the Filipino cultural identity and that any attempt to force her child to use another set of cutlery amounted to discrimination, if not racism. There were many angry exchanges between the teacher, the school principal and the mother.</p>
<p>This tiny quarrel should have been solved quickly. Perhaps the school representatives should have acted more delicately with the outraged mother. Perhaps they were guilty of digging in their heels when they found themselves faced with what they saw as an unfair accusation of racism.</p>
<p>Ms. Gallardo, meanwhile, filed a complaint with Quebec&rsquo;s Human Rights Commission, which investigates and decides whether there are grounds to forward a case on to the Human Rights Tribunal. The commission dismissed the case, saying it was an isolated incident and that the events were impossible to judge since the dispute was based on two contradictory versions of events. The commission also wrote that it was quite possible that Luc Cagadoc had been disciplined for clowning around rather than for using a fork instead of a knife.</p>
<p>However, in Quebec, under certain circumstances, people can apply directly to the Human Rights Tribunal, even if the commission previously rejected their complaint. And so the tribunal agreed to hear the Cagadoc family&rsquo;s case, even though the evidence was murkier than what would have been deemed acceptable by a small-claims court. Last week, that tribunal ruled against the school board, arguing the boy had been discriminated against because of his ethnicity.</p>
<p>Ms. Gallardo had asked for $24,000 in damages, but she&rsquo;s satisfied with the $17,000 award. &#8220;Hopefully, it&rsquo;s all over and we can move on,&#8221; she said. As for Luc Cagadoc, at the tender age of 11, he&rsquo;s mastered the language of victimization: &#8220;I&rsquo;m always going to remember how I was humiliated and discriminated against,&#8221; he said.<br>

		<p>He may be Filipino, but his name is Quebecois.  It seems that someone whose name does not reflect a minority immigrant background may have no grounds for a discrimination lawsuit.  The kid was simply &#8220;eating like a pig.&#8221;  </p>
<p>All awards like this do is convince other immigrants to seek to create situations where they can claim discrimination.  Speaking of culture, where has all our cultural wisdom gone?</p>

<p>Gee, I didn&rsquo;t know I could sue for $17,000.  <br>

		<p>Eat like a Canadian?  There is no such thing as a Canadian.  And that is OFFICIAL!  There are French-Canadians, Sikh-Canadians, Haitian-Canadians (Hi there Governor-General) but there are no &#8220;Canadians&#8221; as such.  Thus requesting a child eat like a Canadian is like asking a walrus to eat like a guppy.</p>
<p>Table manners are so western, white and outdated anyhow!  There are plenty of people through out the world who eat with their fingers, sticks, empty animal skulls, etc..  Who is this school official to impose her idea of &#8220;civilization&#8221; on some poor immigrant boy?  To think there are racists in the public schools of Canada is chilling.  Perhaps Canada&rsquo;s independence should be revoked and the country put under direct rule from Westminster.<br>

		<p>What a shame, that a child that young was taught unequivocally that being a victim pays.  Other kids have rights too, and if this boy&rsquo;s table manners were disgusting, the other kids have the right to be protected from viewing it.  Canada is just as bad if not worse than the U.S. in perpetrating the myths of victimization and entitlement.</p>

<p>Perhaps even MSM Canadian journalists are finally willing to accede to the obvious conclusion set by new 3rd world immigrants - &#8220;follow the money, honey&#8221; - other than &#8220;Coming here for a better life&#8221;. </p>

		<p>I do not think that isolating the child at a table was the appropriate thing to do.  He should have been gently told by someone   &mdash;   a teacher, a family member, or both, that &#8220;when in Rome, you do as the Romans do.&#8221; Like it or not, public schools are based upon inclusivity.  BUT, for inclusivity to work (however much it can, which is a whole other topic), PARENTS have to meet the schools halfway.  I do not know how much this boy&rsquo;s mother was willing to do so. </p>
<p>I once lived with an Asian family.  They did slurp, but I was not offended.  I suspect the custom evolved from the practive of slurping soups, which are more prevalant in Eastern cultures (Eastern European ones included.) Napkins were also used much more sparingly (why, I don&rsquo;t know.)  Still, the family was incredibly hospitable and the food was healthy and well prepared.    When in Rome, you do as the Romans do&hellip;  </p>

<p>Nonsense! I have worked with and am working with Philippino men here in Afghan and in Iraq. They are pleasant and friendly people, but they generally eshew forks and spoons and eat with their hands, Indians are the same way. This was/is just a winning hand at ghetto lottery</p>

		<p>Man! This is pretty far-fetched!</p>
<p>I guess, if you want to make a quick buck, these days, the best strategy would be to create a situation, in which you&rsquo;re pretty sure you&rsquo;ll draw negative attention to yourself, and somene will possibly make a remark about it. Then, you can take them to court.</p>

		<p>I am a non-white immigrant in Canada as well&hellip; but in Toronto</p>
<p>I agree with Kat most.  Having lunch without manners is certainly not very appropriate, but telling a little boy that he eats like a pig + telling him to eat by himself alone away from other kids is not quite civil either.  The Filipino boy likely did not mean to harm anyone or disturb anyone.  </p>
<p>I feel a formal apology letter to his parents stating that they are assured their son will always be treated with more courtesy from here on out would have sufficed.</p>
<p>but 17,000 dollars for hearing that comment regarding his lunch manners is too much&hellip;  and of course, the fact that he is a non-white certainly did help him win in this case.  If non-white immigrants from certain parts around the world keep getting easy money like that in the name of affirmative action, in no time, the immigrant kids&rsquo; parents will start taking advantage of it&hellip;  just wait for their kid to hear one short negative remark at school, then jump right on, scream racism, and request a five figure compensation&hellip;. and what will also happen is that the schools will have to start letting the non-white immigrant kids get away with even worse, truly wrong, outrageously inappropriate things&hellip;.  </p>
<p>but it has already been happening quite a while by now&hellip;. while I was in highschool, I have never, ever seen or heard of a black male student or brown student receiving a discipline for making inappropriate advances at white female pupils&hellip;. and I saw it a hundred times everyday while I was at highschool. </p>
<p>whereas I, other gentle East Asian boys and gentle white boys always were threatened that we will be expelled from school, and had to basically beg on our knees, if we made ever so slightly sexual comment to a white female pupil.  </p>

		<p>Slurping? No. Playing with your food? No. But eating with a knife and fork? Have I been doing this wrong for more years than I care to remember? If so, put me down for about $20,000. I&rsquo;m older than Luc and need a lot more things.</p>

<p><i>This tiny quarrel should have been solved quickly. Perhaps the school representatives should have acted more delicately with the outraged mother.</i></p>
<p><br>
Or perhaps they should have told her to take a long walk off a short pier. </p>
<p>Or better yet: a short drive to the nearest airport to board the first plane back to where eating like a pig is the norm. </p>
<p>BTW, how the heck do you eat with a fork and a spoon? I&rsquo;m aware that Filipinos do this, but I&rsquo;ve never seen (or heard) it in action. But it sounds like a really terrible idea   &mdash;   one which would make decent table manners impossible no matter how delicately practised. </p>
<p>Oops! I think I just committed &#8220;hatespeech&#8221; in Canada! I&rsquo;d better cut somebody a check for $17,000 to pay for my unacceptable Eurocentrism! </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll admit I don&rsquo;t know about the dining habits of Filipinos. But I have spent time in Thailand where the people eat with a fork AND spoon (one utensil in each hand), and time in Malaysia where I witnessed many people eating with their fingers. In both cases the diners ate with a certain grace and did not draw attention to themselves.</p>
<p>The slurpingest, lip-smackingest people I&rsquo;ve seen are Koreans, but again it is the diner&rsquo;s choice whether to eat with a certain quiet dignity or with contrived obnoxiousnes.</p>
<p>My guess is that this kid received attention from eating in a manner reflective of his native(or familial) style.</p>
<p>When he realized that he had attained a certain reputation in the lunch room he exaggerated and capitalized on it til he had regressed to a truly swinish manner of eating.</p>
<p>A return to classroom corporal punishment would have stopped this stuff at the get-go.</p>
