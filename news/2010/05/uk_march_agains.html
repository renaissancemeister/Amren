<h1>UK March Against &#8216;White Genocide&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nivashni Nair, Times of London, May 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>About 600 South Africans living in the United Kingdom are expected to march in the London city centre to bring attention to what they call a &#8220;South African genocide against white people&#8221; tomorrow.</p>
<p>The protest began with an invitation on social networking tool Facebook to an &#8220;awareness campaign against crime, genocide of white people, murder of all races, farm murders and the current state of things in South Africa&#8221;.</p>
<p>The event  &mdash;  which is not affiliated to any official grouping  &mdash;  has drawn over 446 Facebook supporters and more than 150 other marchers.</p>
<p>Ivan Cornelius, the mastermind behind the stint to publicly &#8220;reveal the atrocities in South Africa&#8221;, told The Times in London yesterday that he was tired of the slaughter of South Africans and that global awareness was necessary.</p>
<p>Though the Facebook group and event listing on the website have brought in several views, including that whites are being targeted by criminals in South Africa, Cornelius insists the genocide is more than that.</p>
<p>&#8220;A genocide goes beyond murder. The genocide that we are talking about highlights other issues too. Whites are the only group whose language is being attacked and eliminated. White culture is being attacked and eliminated. We have ticked the boxes which qualify a nation of genocide and there is a genocide of whites,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Cornelius said the event has no affiliation to the right-wing AWB.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&rsquo;t control who comments on the Facebook page. We have received loads of e-mails from South Africans who support us. We stand as a whole with a specific view but we cannot break down every individual&rsquo;s other views, whether racist or not,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>This has been evident on the Facebook event page, where Cornelius has called for marchers to carry national South African flags tomorrow  &mdash;  however, several have refused to do so, saying that they detest the democratic flag.</p>
<p>Cornelius does not believe that the march will cause further racial tension in South Africa.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t see how it can. I am not a racist yet as whites we are called that. If it does bring up racial tension then it will reveal the truth and will expose .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the real racists.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that the march is not meant to dent South Africa&rsquo;s image ahead of the World Cup.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want the World Cup to be a success. Why would we want it to be a disaster?&#8221;</p>
<p>However, not everyone attending the march is on the same page as Cornelius. Some have written that they want the world to be warned before the tourists leave the World Cup in body bags.</p>
<p>The march has been authorised by London police, who will monitor the protest tomorrow.<br>

		<p>Finally, they&rsquo;re taking tothe streets.  To be effective they have to keep the pressure on day and night 24/7.  Anything less will do nothing.  Continued protests will bring other biases against whites into the open.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got to quit making excuses about not being racists though.  It weakens their cause.</p>

		<p>I hope that they succeed in attracting the right sort of attention but, in reality, it&rsquo;s very unlikely that the BBC (among others) will see fit to report on such an unfashionable cause.<br>
All Afrikaners should sell their immovable property and resume their great trek, this time to Orania where they could use their resources and talents to turn the semi-arid and sparsely inhabited country south of the Orange river into a flourishing homeland for themselves alone. There, their racial and cultural identity would be safe, and their nation consolidated, to wait out the bad times coming for South Africa. Once the decline and disintegration of the country is sufficiently advanced, who knows what opportunities might arise for the Oranians?</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I am not a racist yet as whites we are called that.&#8221; - Of course.  Crying &#8220;Racist!&#8221; is just them rallying for genocide.  They are painting their target.<br>
Anti-racist is a codeword for anti-white.   </p>
<p>&#8220;If it does bring up racial tension then it will reveal the truth and will expose &hellip; the real racists.&rdquo; - News-flash: it doesn&rsquo;t matter.   They know they are anti-white.  </p>
<p>It is only whites who don&rsquo;t get it.  It won&rsquo;t stop until they do, or die. </p>
<p>If you think that pointing out the evil of genocide against whites to those who are guilty of it, as though the whole thing is a great mistake, simply decades of a worldwide faux-pas, you are truly deluded.   The devil does NOT fear a mirror - he knows what he is, and laughs at pathetic, deluded cries for mercy to some imagined core of human decency you think must be in him.  It&rsquo;s not.  His gleeful genocide should have made that clear at the outset. </p>
<p>I wish this demonstration luck.  Not the perfectly wasted wish that those guilty of genocide against whites will find a human heart within them and change their minds  about it.  The problem is not in their minds.  It is more fundamental than that.  It won&rsquo;t change, because it can&rsquo;t.  It is a biological imperative.  They literally can&rsquo;t stop killing us, even to save themselves.  Look at Zim.  </p>
<p>What I hope is that more white people will realize what&rsquo;s going on. <br>

		<p>In doing some research, I&rsquo;ve been going through old microfilm from 1985 (major U.S. newspaper). There&rsquo;s hardly an issue without an article or editorial about apartheid, Botha, the White government/police killing blacks, U.S. companies divesting, etc. Jump ahead 25 years and the same paper makes no mention of what&rsquo;s happening in South Africa today. </p>

		<p>To number 3:  It&rsquo;s not so much that the marchers hope to persuade the devil (the black murderers and administration in SA) as much as it is to demonstrate to the world that there is a huge genocide occurring in SA.  It was the world (European and American Whites) who condemned whites in SA, who encouraged and demanded black rule, who boycotted and shunned White South Africa, who pandered to Mandela, the ANC et al and gang jumped the White South African government.  Now that blacks rule SA, Europe and America have lost interest.  They just don&rsquo;t care, or want to know, what their beloved concept of black rule has wrought.  It&rsquo;s a lost cause though, I fear.  </p>
<p>At least unless, or until, Europeans and Americans become minorities in their own countries through the same misguided suicidal policies imposed on them that they imposed on SA.  Once they see what third worlders, blacks, and ignorant hispanics do to Whites once in power and control, they won&rsquo;t much care what happens to a few Whites in South Africa.  Some actually think White South Africans deserve what they are now getting.  </p>

		<p>This is very good activism - and the event organizers should be complimented for successfully using modern social networking tools like Facebook. Amren readers should do the same.</p>
<p>That said, I hope the marchers are prepared to deal with Antifa attacks.  our people must develop the the ability to defend our people from attacks at our events.</p>
<p>God bless.</p>

		<p>These people are right and brave for making this issue known.  If only more whites would wake up to what is occurring before they too become victims.</p>
<p>We will see if any US news organization covers this issue including FOX News.</p>
