<h1><a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=149729">U.S. Marines Boot Recruits With Confederate Tattoos</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chelsea Schilling, WorldNetDaily, May 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A widely regarded Southern symbol of pride and states&rsquo; rights is standing in the way of would-be Marines in their quest to serve their country  &mdash;  a Confederate battle flag.</p>
<p>Straight out of high school, one 18-year-old Tennessee man was determined to serve his country as a Marine. His friend said he passed the pre-enlistment tests and physical exams and looked forward with excitement to the day he would ship out to boot camp.</p>
<p>But there would be no shouting drill instructors, no rigorous physical training and no action-packed stories for the aspiring Marine to share with his family.</p>
<p>Shortly before he was scheduled to leave Nashville for boot camp, the Marine Corps rejected him.</p>
<p>Now, the young man, who wishes to remain unnamed and declined to be interviewed, has chosen to return to school and is no longer an aspiring Marine.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When the young recruit didn&rsquo;t go to boot camp, Andrews [former Marine 1st Lt. Gene Andrews, a friend of the man and patriotic Southerner who served in Vietnam from 1968 through 1971] learned of his rejection based on his tattoo of the Confederate battle flag on his shoulder.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Right now, it&rsquo;s a flat-out denial&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>WND contacted the Tennessee recruiting station, and a Marine sergeant explained, &#8220;The policy is if a tattoo can be construed by anyone as being gang-related or racially biased, then we can&rsquo;t accept them.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Asked whether an exception might be made for a Marine recruit who could provide a full explanation on the meaning of his tattoo as an expression of Southern pride, the recruiter explained, &#8220;At this point in time, no. If it can be construed by anyone as being racially biased, then right now it&rsquo;s a flat-out denial.&#8221;</p>
<p>He acknowledged that the tattoo is quite popular in the South and that recruitment has been impacted by the ban on Confederate-flag tattoos, but he explained that the policy has been set by Headquarters Marine Corps.</p>
<p>Headquarters Marine Corps has not responded to WND&rsquo;s requests for clarification of the policy.</p>
<p>However, the U.S. Marine Corps &#8220;Guidebook for Tattoo Screening, Volume VII,&#8221; a manual that outlines procedures for enlisted recruiting and officer procurement operations, explains, &#8220;Users of this guidebook should keep in mind, however, that few symbols ever just represent one idea or are used exclusively by one group. For example, the confederate flag is a symbol that is frequently used by white supremacists but which also has been used by people and groups that are not racist. To some it may signify pride in one&rsquo;s heritage, but to others it suggests slavery or white supremacy.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>&#8216;We&rsquo;ve seen this before&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Other service members and recruits have dealt with similar issues concerning Confederate flag tattoos and military policy.</p>
<p>The Southern Legal Resource Center, or SLRC, is a nonprofit legal foundation that has handled a number of legal cases involving the Confederate battle flag.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve seen this before,&#8221; SLRC Chief Trial Counsel Kirk Lyons told WND. &#8220;This is not a unique situation. {snip} There was one more incident a couple of years ago where another Marine recruit was refused enlistment because of a battle flag tattoo.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lyons said the case of the Marine with a Confederate flag bumper sticker was resolved without legal action because the base commander decided to leave it alone. However, he said most enlistees and recruits don&rsquo;t pursue legal action or complaints, so the policy is never challenged.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>&#8216;This is an insult to us&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a recent commentary posted on numerous blogs, Andrews recounted his experience:</p>
<p>&#8220;I informed the young sergeant that my family had defended the state of Tennessee (also his home state) against a sadistic invasion under that flag and to call our sacred flag of honor a &#8216;hate symbol&rsquo; was an insult to all southerners, but especially to those southerners who had risked or even given their lives in service to the Marine Corps. Southerners had served at Belleau Woods, at Tarawa and Iwo Jima, at Inchon and the Chosin Reservoir, and at Khe Sanh and Hue City, but now we are no longer wanted in the politically correct, don&rsquo;t-offend-any-minorities military?&#8221;</p>
<p>The sergeant politely explained that the policy was handed down by headquarters.</p>
<p>Andrews continued, &#8220;I asked the sergeant if he had taken out the trash yet. He replied that he hadn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;I then said, &#8216;Please add these to the day&rsquo;s garbage,&rsquo; and returned my lieutenant&rsquo;s bars, my gold and silver Marine Corps emblem from my dress blues, my shooting badges and my Vietnam ribbons.</p>
<p>&#8220;{snip}</p>
<p>Andrews told WND he was born in the South, raised in the South and will always be a Southerner.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an insult to us,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&rsquo;ve laid our lives on the line in the Marine Corps since there was a Marine Corps. We fought in every campaign that the Marine Corps has been involved in. When I was in Vietnam, there were Confederate flags at every base, every fire-support base over there. Nobody said anything about it. There were state flags, Confederate flags, and it was no big deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Andrews said he is not angry. Rather, he is disappointed in the Marine Corps.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought if it had been a bunch of political hacks or a school board or a local government or some municipality that was pretty spineless anyway, I really wouldn&rsquo;t have been surprised,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That happens all the time. But I felt that the Marine Corps had a little more backbone and a little more character than that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked what he would say to people who believe the Confederate flag represents racism and slavery, he responded, &#8220;I&rsquo;d say they don&rsquo;t know much about history. Slavery existed under the United States flag much longer than it ever did under the Confederate flag.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Confederate flag: Symbol of &#8216;terrorism&rsquo; or independence?</b></p>
<p>The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, or NAACP, recently fought to ban the Confederate flag from the South Carolina Statehouse. NAACP leaders have said the Confederate flag &#8220;supports the evils of slavery&#8221; and &#8220;represents terrorism.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a May 9, 2000, survey by Gallup Poll News Service posed this question to Americans, &#8220;Do you, yourself, see the Confederate flag more as a symbol of Southern pride, or more as a symbol of racism?&#8221;</p>
<p>A full 59 percent of all respondents said they believe it is a symbol of Southern pride, while only 28 percent saw it as a symbol of racism.</p>

<p>How about if a person is racially biased? Wouldn&rsquo;t that be more important than if they simply had a tattoo? If they take the next logical step, political correctness aside, the military would be all white. How about a little objectivity among our military leadership? Don&rsquo;t tell me our military leadership would be willing to lie. And go along with something they don&rsquo;t believe in? Is it Semper fi, or not?</p>

		<p>In spite of the blatantly discriminatory tone of the whole series of events, there is something in me which is glad that he&rsquo;s not a U.S. Marine.  For some odd gut feeling on which I can&rsquo;t put my finger, I think this is going to turn out to be a blessing in disguise.  Can anyone help me out here?</p>

		<p>Years ago I read in Leatherneck magazine about Marines, under heavy fire, raising and flying the Confederate battle flag over an important enemy position they had won on one of the islands contested in WWII, Okinawa, maybe. </p>
<p>When it was reported to the commanding General, he was supposed to have happily and proudly explained to critics something to the effect that the Confederacy was one of our most valuable allies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a Southerner but I was delighted to read about it because I&rsquo;m privileged to share the same nationality with such high-spirited, proud, dauntless, wonderful men.</p>
<p>Bill Mauldin, the great artist of WWII, did a cartoon joking that the U.S. could not have won the war without allies like Brooklyn and Texas.</p>
<p>Three of my grandparents were Irish Catholics.  Every time I see an Anglo-Saxon Protestant (and that isn&rsquo;t so often these days) I feel like dropping to one knee and genuflecting in gratitude and homage to the Great Race that created this country in its image and likeness and allowed me to share in its countless blessings. </p>

		<p>I too am disappointed in the Marine Corps position.  It definitely sends a message to all that says the Corps is not what it once was - now it&rsquo;s weaker, and takes its orders from opinion polls and loud mouths.  What a shame.  I really believe they need to rethink this.  If it&rsquo;s a badge of honor to be a Marine, then they need to so honor ALL who prove themselves able to serve as Marines, regardless of their heritage - or tattoos.</p>

<p>As a Southern wasp, thank you so much !  I am really getting sick of white liberals from up North and elsewhere telling us Southerners how we are supposed to live.  If you spit on the South, you spit on the original founders of this nation.  Whether you like it or not, the South is one of the last areas of the country where a majority of its white population can trace its lineage to the Revolution. As a Southerner, I am loud and proud about this, and I am going to keep talking about it as much as I want to.  </p>
<p>I am glad, that in spite of all this hatred, whenever I go back to my home state in the Deep South, you can find stores everywhere with merchandise that honors this beautiful flag that represents our region of the country. One of these days, I might just get me one of those bikinis that has the beloved print on it.  It is a beautiful flag, one of the most beautiful flags the world has ever seen, and as a Southern Belle, I am not ashamed to flaunt it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Slavery existed under the United States flag much longer than it ever did under the Confederate flag&#8221;. - True, but I believe this statement is disingenuous in nature.  Had the South won their independence, slavery would have continued and may still have been in practice today (although I doubt it), and be in existence under the Confederate flag.  Otherwise, the Slave states could have voted to end all slavery in 1808 or sooner, thus halting the importation of Africans, but declined to do so. The lesson of Haiti seems to have been overlooked in the pursuit of the almighty dollar. Otherwise, AmRen often decries Black activity in America, but the only &#8220;solution&#8221; discussed is a small enclave in the Northwest for Whites only.  What of the South should we reach a point of ethnic separation?  What comes of the White Southerners should Blacks reach super-majority status in the former slave states and declare a racially independent Black nation? Blacks leaving the Southwest are moving to the Southeast, Whites are moving North. I know this post will probably be seen as contrary to the pro-Southern-White comments being solicited, but to maintain the hope of an overwhelmingly White anything in the future America seems a bit overly optimistic.</p>

		<p>This is truly sickening.  The simple truth is that the military professionals of this nation, especially the NCO ranks (which are the backbone of the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps), have always been overly represented by Southerners.  The men who fought under the Stars and Bars, whatever their personal ideologies, were fighting for home, hearth, and family.  Only a tiny percentage of them owned slaves, and many of them were sympathetic to the goal of abolition.</p>
<p>To denigrate the Confederate flag and its display, whether in the form of a tattoo or a home decoration, is a national disgrace.</p>
<p>I say this as Yankee-born and disabled veteran of the Vietnam war, during which I was surrounded by southern-born infantrymen, who were generally the best troopers I had under my command.</p>
<p>I might add that the best racial relations I observed during that conflict were between southern whites and southern blacks, who often seemed to show a sense of brotherhood and good-natured cooperation that I rarely observed between northern whites and northern blacks, particularly northern city blacks.</p>

		<p>Oh how the mighty have fallen, or more correctly, come under the influence of Political Correctness. In 1994, Bill Clinton was hell-bent on forcing all of the services to implement &#8220;gender&#8221; mixed training. A number Marine Generals stood up and stated that they would retire rather than order this travesty. Bill Clinton actually backed down and this is why Marine boot camp is segregated to this day. (Words have gender, people have sex). </p>
<p>Since Southerners make up a disproportionate number in the military, what would happen if they went on strike against the Marines? Same thing with a reinstatement of the draft; this nonsense would come to a screeching halt. How many waivers do the Marines hand out to minority gang-bangers to make mission, but God-forbid they see a guy in their platoon who sports the stars and bars. We are reaping what was sown by the draft dodgers from Vietnam who have now worked themselves into positions of authority. </p>

		<p>I must disagree here.  I think the Marines did this young man a favor.  With his stars and bars tatoo he would be a marked man.  One black is all it takes to kill the young man in his sleep because he &#8220;don&rsquo;t like no rasis tatoo&#8221;.</p>

		<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t want anyone in the U.S. military sporting a symbol of patriotism and battle courage now, would we?  I served in the infantry and the majority of guys I served with were white southerners and fine soldiers.  I hope this story helps potential enlistees understand what our military, and our nation, has become.  Most soldiers are not serving what they think they are serving, and I think more and more of them are waking up to this fact.  This empire is like Rome at the end of the 4th century.</p>

		<p>I work with the U.S. military in Afghanistan (at the moment)mostly Army and Marines and I can tell you that there are indeed gang bangers in the military. Some are sleeved totally, many have, what I KNOW to be gang tats on their necks and the military doesn&rsquo;t seem to know it. Tribal tattoos are rampant and visible no matter the uniform the troops wear. When I was in, getting a tattoo without the COs permission resulted in an Art-15, loss of 1/3 pay for 3 months and possible discharge but NOT in this modern PC military. Again! I would point out that the military has monthly classes to point out that RAPE and SEXUAL ASSAULT are crimes!!!! but it continues to happen often and the usual victims and culprits are the usual colors.</p>

		<p>Why would white guys join a military that serves a country that every day diminishes them, insults them, scapegoats them and is actively legislating them into second class citizenship in the first place? I find it amazing that I can&rsquo;t walk anywhere in my city (Las Vegas) without running into some third worlder now living here. Yet, when I see film footage of the front lines in Afghanistan or Iraq it is overwhelmingly white guys doing the brunt of the dirty work. Funny how there are no calls for &#8220;diversity&#8221; when it comes to who is doing the real fighting and dying for this country.</p>

		<p>War is all about a lot of really good men fighting for some really bad causes. Most of the men that fought for either the North or the South had nothing against each other on a personal level. </p>
<p>About a half million good white men died during that war and it&rsquo;s really nothing to be proud of.  My ancestors died on both sides and I can&rsquo;t think of any good it did any of them. Just like most other wars both sides lost because only a few people got rich and many people suffered. </p>
<p>White pride is much more important than Southern pride and you can&rsquo;t get that with a tattoo, it&rsquo;s in your heart. </p>
<p>If we whites don&rsquo;t stop fighting each other then we are going to lose out. Forget about the Civil war and start getting ready for the next one. </p>

		<p>Well, Screaming Eagle, it might just be a policy of gradually replacing conservative, honorable Southern White patriots who typically flock to military service with another type of person&hellip;..latinos from foreign countries, latinos from the barrio, even more blacks than are in the military currently, gays and the effiminate, feminists and man-haters.<br>
Picture a military predominantly composed of those types and none of the traditional types.  Now ask yourself which of the two groups - the groups being excluded, or the groups being currently sought by our leadership - would fire upon Americans on command?  Eh?  It becomes pretty clear then what is going on.  By the way, I also tucked my trou into my boots.  Airborne.</p>

		<p>@bannerrwb  -  your original thesis is ENTIRELY incorrect. the Confederate constitution banned importation of africans. furthermore, the Confederacy had a working plan for repatriation of same. there was even land purchased in africa [liberia if i remember correctly, which i may not] to send them to. many were sent there before the commencement of northern aggression to try to get them established. of course, the attempt to teach them how to conduct their affairs in a civilised manner failed, but it was tried. remember too, that at one time there were more white slaves in this country than black, AND that the vast majority of blacks came in thru the northeast on jewish owned ships. and that a small percentage of Southrons owned slaves. and, and, and&hellip;</p>

		<p>Perhaps ALL Whites should get a Confederate flag tatoo, including those currently serving in the military. This APPARENTLY would have the effect of having the entire military composed of &#8220;people of color&#8221;. Perhaps they could &#8220;defend America&#8221; by going to the middle east and giving their lives like so many White boys have already done. </p>

		<p>We have had similar problems with the old South African flag, die oranje blanje blou, being called a flag of oppression or the flag of Apartheid. Not that this has ever stopped those true white South Africans from waving it at rugby or cricket matches much to the distaste of the ANC and liberals world wide. </p>
<p>The powers that be try to ban it and have effectively done so for the Fifa world cup, but somehow I believe it will make an appearance in full view of the international audience. Funny how a flag can mean everything to the people that bear its mark. </p>

		<p>This is out of my realm, but I just couldn&rsquo;t let it go.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so anti-militaristic that rather than opt for a student deferment, I avoided the Vietnam war draft as a conscientious objector (my apologies to our honorable veterans  &mdash;  white, black, red, or yellow  &mdash;  and especially those maimed or killed in service to their country).  Some of my relatives died defending the Confederacy and other patriotic causes before and since, but I realize this doesn&rsquo;t entitle me to any moral high-ground.</p>
<p>Despite my disclaimer, please indulge me as I pull a few comments out of context to make a point.</p>
<p>From a Marine sergeant at a Tennessee recruiting station: &#8220;&#8216;The policy is if a tattoo can be construed by ANYONE as being&hellip;racially biased, then we can&rsquo;t accept them.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>And from Istvan, post #10 (9:27 PM, May 5): &#8220;ONE black is all it takes&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And from Screaming Eagle, post #11 (9:51 PM, May 5): &#8220;Most soldiers are not serving what they think they are serving&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>On the one hand, American law was written to protect INDIVIDUAL rights.  And on the other hand, in response to the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; movement (of which I regret having taken part), it now makes exceptions to accommodate certain &#8220;protected&#8221; or otherwise favored groups or &#8220;CLASSES.&#8221; </p>
<p>The NAACP and other &#8220;liberal&#8221; agitators are seeing to it that the Rebel flag can now officially be considered verboten, and Istvan was undoubtedly right about watching your back if you&rsquo;ve offended some of the blacks in your barracks.  So, as per Screaming Eagle (and Question Diversity post #2), maybe certain would-be recruits should re-examine their calling before enlisting.</p>
<p>My nephew, who was enrolled in ROTC, once admonished me: &#8220;This is still the best country in the world!&#8221;  And I couldn&rsquo;t really argue that with him.  Fortunately, in spite of his &#8220;education,&#8221; he has decided against pursuing a career in today&rsquo;s military.    </p>
<p>Nonetheless, George Orwell&rsquo;s keen equations seem appropriate here: &#8220;War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I might humbly add a couple of other familiar misconceptions: Black is White and Left is Right.  </p>

		<p>Reminds me of the stupidity I have been reading about that took place in the great war. (1914 -18) While front line troops were being slaughtered in their hundredsn of thousands the British Officers were regularly sending out memos about the Australian troops not saluting properly!<br>
Banning a Stars and Bars on a keen young man who is willing to put his life on the line for his nation is the ultimate absurdity.<br>
As a casual observer I have noticed even here on Australia the Confederate flag is a symbol used by men who want to be men.<br>
Perhaps the US military should encourage men to be men again!</p>

		<p>To Poster #2:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore, should the partaking in such a police action, war, etc. help to eradicate or eliminate our race, through any reason, then such association must be refused and profusely rejected.  No more will we be deceived and misinformed into sending the European American/European son and daughter into the pointless conflict or the trumped-up war for someone else and his or her interests (the person/individual other than our own).  Why should the European American/European son and daughter be required or expected to fight and to die for an institution of government from which he and she has long since been separated (i.e., a government which adamantly and openly moves against the European American/European and disagrees with said being in awareness, view, and application; a government which moves to be ecstatic in the suppression of the European American/European; and, a government which through policy and appointment hopes to eliminate the European American/European from his and her country)?&rdquo; (The Metaphysics of the Model by Eiderzen, p. xvi)</p>
<p>It may be stated to this young man that was rejected; some of the biggest disappointments perceived at the time become some of the greatest blessings as years come and go.   <br>

		<p>The flags stands for something different now. At least the way I see it. Means a rebel, an unconventional person, a non-conformist who does not go with the flow. NOT as meaning something negative at all. And individual showing his individualism.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s excellent!  This way, the USMC can fill body bags with diversitoids instead of young whites.  If I was 20 years younger and the armed forces were conscripting men again, I would head off to the nearest tattoo parlor right away.</p>
<p>HOA rules at our townhouse complex allow display of the American flag (the Welsh red dragon earned us complaints).  Since the stars and bars are an American flag, this is the one we fly.  Nobody has complained.</p>

		<p>For some reason, this reminds me of that line in Apocalypse Now where Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) says that it&rsquo;s all right for a pilot to drop napalm on a village full of children, burning them all to death, but it&rsquo;s immoral for him to have the word &#8220;f***&#8221; painted on his fuselage. In this case, it&rsquo;s all right for the Marines to kill people, but God forbid that they have any &#8220;racist&#8221; tattoos while they do it. Maybe the Corps should start doing what the Soviets did during World War II and start assigning political commissar officers to root out ideological deviants in the ranks.</p>

		<p>There is a piece to this story that my fellow posters are not getting. </p>
<p>Within the Marine Corps, it would be incredibly hard to find any Marine who doesn&rsquo;t have a tatoo - and this applies to both enlisted and commissioned ranks. </p>
<p>I myself have several, but because of my civilian job, they are in places where they will not show below a shirt sleeve or above a necktie. </p>
<p>Black and hispanic Marines are adorned with any number of race-centric tatoos, some of them downright anti-white. </p>
<p>What this article fails to say is that the definition for &#8220;racist&#8221; is quite different for white poolees (what potential enlistees are referred to) than it is for minorities. </p>
<p>About three years ago the Commandant finally passed down guidance as to what was considered acceptable, so for instance, full sleeves, partial sleeves, above the neck, etc., were ruled as unauthorized. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more disturbed that the Marine Corps is not being quite honest about how its policy is applied, rather than that they are applying the policy in the first place. </p>

		<p>17-jh: I appreciate your response and the information.  I believe the main point of my argument stands though, in that the Nation as a whole and the South in particular could have ended Slaverly 1) at the birth of America, 2) The South anytime before the 1808 compromise time frame, or 3) The South at anytime in the FIFTY PLUS years prior to 1861.  I understand the economics of it all, and feel that if the North was so intent upon ending Slavery, they should have coughed up some compensation to the Slave owners and the Slaves. But again, the South would have had to agree.  The cost of failing to reach a compromise resulted in destruction, 600,000 White deaths, and our never-ending racial conflict. Otherwise, I understand there were White indentured servants who were not seen as investments and who suffered greatly, but I have no information on their numbers compared to Slaves.  I agree the majority of Slaves came through the Northeast - mostly Maryland I think, which was a Slave state.  I can&rsquo;t debate ship ownership as I have no knowledge in that regard, but would be interested in seeing such evidence.  I do agree that only a minority of people owned Slaves, but that is off point - that White America and Black Africa would have been better off without Slavery, period.  In this instance though, for someone to say America as a whole was worse than the South in particlar on the issue of Slavery, is, I believe, incorrect to the point of needing a rebuttal.  Hence, my original comment.  I believe the end result will be ethno-centric Nations coming out of the current America, and if we can&rsquo;t find compromise to do it peacefully, we&rsquo;re in for another Civil War. </p>

<p>What if one were to construe a Woody Woodpecker cartoon as racially biased?  What if one were to construe a tattoo of a sun god as gang-related?  We can&rsquo;t help how one construes artwork or is offended by it.  That&rsquo;s their problem.</p>

		<p>Daniel, I wish I could agree with you.  Sorry, but there are just some liberal ( most of the time Northern) whites who are almost impossible to like.  They have shown more hatred towards my people than anybody else ever has.  Our worst enemies are actually a certain percentage of our fellow whites in this country.  </p>
<p>I work with a bunch of Northern liberal whites, and they enjoy sitting around talking about how stupid and violent WHITE Southerners are, but they seem to have no problem with Third World immigrants. Until certain things change, I am going to be very proud of my Southern heritage and I am always going to remember the Civil War. If you are from the North, and you are tolerant of the South, then and only then am I willing to stand beside you. Otherwise, what good does it do?</p>
<p>I am most certainly NOT stereotyping Northerners, but there have just been far too many that I have run into who are hostile and hateful towards white Southerners, while in the mean time they embrace immigrants.</p>

		<p>Actually they could say a woody woodpecker tattoo is &#8220;racist&#8221; as peckerwoods,old black prison slang for whites who stand up for themselves, was sometimes symbolised with a woody woodpecker tattoo.<br>
 One wonders how many hispanic gang tattoos in old english lettering are considered offensive and result in rejection, full sleeves or not? </p>

		<p>Random Thoughts:</p>
<p>This country is obsessed with a cult of Abe Lincoln.  Interesting that Lincoln thought that the white man and black man could never live together peacefully.  His stated intention was to deport all blacks, including free blacks after the war.  Hmmm.</p>
<p>Most of the elite forces of this country&rsquo;s military services are white and mostly from south of the Mason-Dixon.  The rest of the mil is becoming darker in color and feminine.  And more non-citizens than ever thought possible.  Women on subs, whoo whoo.  Makes &#8220;Any time, any where, always ready, always there&#8221; subject to interpretation just like tats.  Sheesh, glad I&rsquo;m on the retired mos these days.</p>

		<p>Courtney, I know what you&rsquo;re talking about when you refer to the liberal Northerners. I&rsquo;m a transplant myself who came down here to get away from these idiots. Unfortunately, I discovered that half of them had already beat me to it. The place I live in is crawling with them.  </p>
<p>That being said, most of the working class Whites up North know the score. You would be amazed at the things I&rsquo;ve heard them say when it comes to race relations, political correctness, etc.  When the whole thing falls apart we&rsquo;ll be able to count on them. </p>

		<p>   To set the record straight, Massachusetts and Rhode Island were the major importers of African Slaves into America (after the British of course) . To a lesser degree would come Connecticut . New York was more peripherally involved because of her industry . American slavery, even in the old South, was benign and minuscule compared to South and Central America and the Caribbean . It&rsquo;s extremely doubtful slavery would have continued in the South . Some Confederates fled to Brazil with their slaves . Slavery in the New World didn&rsquo;t come any more brutal than Brazil&rsquo;s version of it but those Confederates would be giving their slaves up to freedom before the turn of the century . Jim Crow was common nationwide though less institutionalized than the South . Sammy Davis Jr had to stay in black hotels while in Las Vegas, Nat King Cole had a cross burned in his front yard in Beverly Hills . The last two cross burnings directed at blacks that I heard about were both on Long Island around 2002 . Now more and more, it is whites who have to labor under Jim Crow like laws and edicts levied directly at them .</p>

		<p>Bill R., airborne all the way.  Re: your point about troops willing to fire on Americans, that might be the case.  I find it difficult to believe that most of the people in our government have become evil and corrupt enough to pursue that kind of policy, but it only takes a few at the top I suppose, and I know we have some of those already.  These are dark days, indeed.</p>

		<p>I agreed with the article, but, having no military experience, forwarded it to a 60+ female friend who&rsquo;s family (including her mother) were Marines.  Here&rsquo;s what she replied with, and she is very conservative and live in Idaho:</p>
<p>i totally side with the US Marines.  tattoos have ALWAYS been rejected by the Corps, in spite of what you are reading.  I have known this since i was a little kid when my Daddy told me the only tattoo he would ever put on his body was of the US Marines anchor-globe emblem because the Corps does not allow any other tattoos. the Corps has always demanded high standards.  they have to have harmony and not conflict for obvious reasons.  if the guy loved the Marines so much he should have had the tattoo removed and he would have been admitted if his test scores were high enough.  he is whining over his choice.  tough.</p>
