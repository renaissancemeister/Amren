<h1><a href="http://www.eutimes.net/2010/05/arizona-bans-multilingual-requirement-for-businesses/">Arizona Bans Multilingual Requirement for Businesses</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>"Europe," European Times, May 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Arizona did it again! Fresh from signing a law that reinforces a federal law giving police the right to ask a person stopped by police for an unrelated matter to produce papers proving the right to be legally in the US, followed by a law banning schools from teaching minority/ethnic studies courses advocating separatism, group superiority and subversion of this country, Arizona Governor Jan Brewer (R) signed legislation affirming that nothing in state law requires businesses to provide &#8220;trained and competent&#8221; interpreters when a customer comes in speaking a language other than English. Assistant Attorney General Michael Walker said that has probably always been the law.</p>
<p>If it was always the law, why the need for this law? Because of a lawsuit of course. A unilingual Spanish speaking woman in Arizona was treated by a unilingual English speaking optometrist in his Arizona office. The woman&rsquo;s underage 12 year old daughter offered to be the interpreter; fearing legal, insurance and medical problems if the child misunderstood the optometrist refused, asking the mother and child to return with an English speaker over 18 or alternatively, visit some Spanish speaking optometrists. Instead, the Spanish speaker, whether legally in this country or not, understood enough of this country to file a discrimination suit against the English speaking optometrist. Refusing to settle, the optometrist finally won after the Arizona Attorney General took a year to decide no laws had been broken.</p>
<p>But the lawsuit and the trouble it caused the optometrist, Dr. Schrolucke, pushed him to reach out to Sen. John Huppenthal, R-Chandler, who agreed to sponsor what he called &#8220;clarifying language&#8221; to the state&rsquo;s civil rights law.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody should be treated like this,&#8221; Huppenthal said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a nightmare to go through this. He was drug through the mud by us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Learning other languages, studying other cultures can be valuable, can be interesting but should not be a legal requirement for a person&rsquo;s business. Learning the language, studying the culture of the country of residence for an immigrant should be legally required for such public activities as voting and obtaining such government documents as a driver&rsquo;s license.</p>
<p>If the immigrant cannot or will not adapt and prefers to live in an ethnic ghetto that is the immigrant&rsquo;s right. But imposing the alien culture onto this country, expecting the host culture  &mdash;  the US&rsquo;s  &mdash;  to adapt to the immigrant&rsquo;s culture by rule of law and suing to bring it about should be illegal.</p>
<p>Step by step Arizona is proving to be the little state that can!<br>

I am curious to note if Arizona will attempt to secede from the so-called Union in the months to come! I have for so long forsaken the notion of calling myself an American, and I am most surprised the at this point, so late in the game, white people are fighting back (in the system) and not with weapons, (which by this time you would think inevitable) but with laws and ideals! Congratulations. No, Hail!  To the bravery of these Arizona legislators. Though, this will not last long. The Federal tyrants will put down the iron heel.</p>
<p>And as for ICE not doing there job, Obama&rsquo;s remarks on the border, and the wrath of the media, this is inherently showing all white people what WE HAVE TO LOOK FORWARD TO in 2050, and after, when we don&rsquo;t even have faux pas people in office, but are completely ruled by these people. </p>
<p>Arizona, vae victis. And well done.</p>

		<p>Lots of good things coming out of Arizona lately! I never cared too much for the Grand Canyon State, but now I&rsquo;m really starting to like it. I just hope that other states will follow,a nd that Arizona is  able to effectively use their new law to remove hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants. As for the federal gov&rsquo;t meddling in Arizona&rsquo;s affais, I have no problem with mosre centralized gov&rsquo;t, as long as the gov&rsquo;t isn&rsquo;t insane. The government under Obama definately qualifies as insane in my book. I don&rsquo;t think the good people of AZ will accept government meddling with this law which they overwhelmingly support. There would probably be large-scale rioting if that happened.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m going to have to find some occupation that will enable me to move to the great state of Arizona.  It appears to be the last sane patch of America.</p>

		<p>1. Since when is it illegal to discriminate against you if you don&rsquo;t speak English?</p>
<p>2. You&rsquo;re here illegaly, therefore, you have no rights.  Case closed.</p>

		<p>Arizona has it right,  The patient should seek out a spanishing speaking doctor but chose not to because she wanted to win the ghetto lottery.  As long as ARIZONA continues to pass laws protecting her people I believe the public will follow and cheer.  The big trouble will be when Obama wanta to send in Federal troops to squash Gov. Brewers government.</p>

		<p>The more I hear about AZ, the more I&rsquo;m liking it - maybe I need to move there rather than to the CA Gold Country!!!  I think Jan Brewer and Dr. Schrolucke deserve Medals of Honor for standing up for what is RIGHT in this country!</p>

		<p>Score another one for Arizona. Thank you, Governor Brewer, for standing up for your citizens and our country. We&rsquo;ve been invaded for a quarter of a century and it took one brave women with the help of others like Kris Kobach, John Cavanaugh, and Russell Pierce to show Washington what a complete mess it has made of protecting our nation and its people.</p>

		<p>In many European countries (admired by liberals) there are official languages. Many have a clause in their Constitutions. <br>
The language of Denmark is Danish - this nice, simple and obvious statement is the law in Denmark and its people are not hicks, nativists, racist etc. Far from it. Why this cannot be done in America? </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure this law is going to cause the left to fall on its knees and cry for &#8220;justice&#8221; and &#8220;fairness&#8221;. Instead they should be investigating, why it is, that in so many Southwest States, businesses openly and bigotedly have want ads that say, Spanish required, Mandarin required,(yes, I&rsquo;m not kidding a lot of ads),etc. By the way, these aren&rsquo;t jobs that need high level language skills or office type work, they are often simple warehouse jobs. Sound like a little racial favoritism going on here?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t even mentioned the websites of many large corporations or public utilities, that also discriminate against non-Spanish (basically whites) speakers by requiring Spanish. If asked why they have this policy, I&rsquo;m dead sure the reason would be  that,&#8221;well, those are our customers&#8221;,that&rsquo;s our demographic in this area.&#8221; Hmm, these same considerations never seem to apply where there are a majority of whites living. They still have to hire the appropriate amount of Hispanics,etc. Sounds like a good way to conquer territory for a certain group, doesn&rsquo;t it? All the left cares about however, is that English doesn&rsquo;t unfairly &#8220;hinder people looking for work&#8221;, and that, as Robert Reich said, &#8220;I hope these jobs won&rsquo;t go to white construction workers&#8221;&hellip;..  </p>

		<p>The language of Denmark is Danish </p>
<p>HA! The language of Denmark is turning into Somali, Ethiopian, Sudanese and any other African language to include Arabic!!! It is thus all over EU now. CDG in Paris is all African and Heathrow in Londinistan is all rude Pakistani muslim controlled.</p>
