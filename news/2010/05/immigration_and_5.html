			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Walter Williams, Creators Syndicate, May 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} Their [my libertarian fellow travelers&rsquo;] vision of immigration has some blind spots. This has become painfully obvious in the wake Arizona&rsquo;s law that cracks down on illegal immigration. Let&rsquo;s look at the immigration issue step by step.</p>
<p>There are close to 7 billion people on our planet. I&rsquo;d like to know how the libertarians answer this question: Does each individual on the planet have a natural or God-given right to live in the U.S.? Unless one wishes to obfuscate, I believe that a yes or no can be given to that question just as a yes or no answer can be given to the question whether Williams has a right to live in the U.S.</p>
<p>I believe most people, even my open-borders libertarian friends, would not say that everyone on the planet had a right to live in the U.S. That being the case suggests there will be conditions that a person must meet to live in the U.S. Then the question emerges: Who gets to set those conditions? Should it be the United Nations, the European Union, the Japanese Diet or the Moscow City Duma? I can&rsquo;t be absolutely sure, but I believe that most Americans would recoil at the suggestion that somebody other than Americans should be allowed to set the conditions for people to live in the U.S.</p>
<p>What those conditions should be is one thing and whether a person has a right to ignore them is another. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Regardless of the hardship suffered, being in the U.S. without authorization is a crime.</p>
<p>When crimes are committed, what should be done? Some people recommend amnesia, which turns out to be the root word for amnesty. {snip} Amnesty supporters probably wish amnesty to apply to only illegal immigrants. That being the case, one wonders whether they wish it to apply to illegals past, present and future, regardless of race, ethnicity or country of origin.</p>
<p>{snip} Similarly, imprisoning some illegal immigrants and then deporting them after their sentences were served would send a signal to others who are here illegally or who are contemplating illegal entry that there&rsquo;s a price to pay.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Williams&rsquo; suggestion in a nutshell. Start strict enforcement of immigration law, as Arizona has begun. Strictly enforce border security. Most importantly, modernize and streamline our cumbersome immigration laws so that people can more easily migrate to our country.<br>

Years ago, I was watching a libertarian giving a speech on c-span.</p>
<p>He began by noting that Mexicans take siestas and love to drink beer. He actually used this as the premise as to why we should welcome these people and their culture. He wasn&rsquo;t joking.</p>

<p>Only, then he becomes somehwat like the &#8220;everyone deserves to live here&#8221; people. If we streamline immigration, in terms of actual numbers of immigrants (legal or illegal) it isn&rsquo;t much better than just granting illegals amnesty.<br>

<p>Here is my suggestion and Mr. Williams probably wouldn&rsquo;t like it, nor any of the other &ldquo;establishment&rdquo; zonked wonks or gullible gurus that try to control opinion on this subject. Why not let the American people vote on this, in a national referendum on this issue? With this tactic, the tawdry fools and outright strumpets that run this country, would have cover for their craven inactions and sanctimonious duplicity on the &ldquo;immigration&rdquo; question.</p>
<p>Such a national referendum need only ask two questions on a ballot. These would be:</p>
<p>1.) Should all illegal aliens be treated as invaders and dealt with accordingly;</p>
<p>2.) Should unlimited legal immigration be allowed, or should it be persistently restricted to only individuals that could be easily assimilated into our Western cultural traditions and will contribute to this country&rsquo;s future prosperity and advancement. </p>
<p>Mind you, those are only suggested questions, but they do cover our bases quite well!</p>

		<p>Due to the foolishness of the white race, the present advanced civilizations built by white brain power are rapidly being destroyed.  The white race is being forced, past and present, to support peoples of color.  Now these people of color are invading their countries en mass where soon the white race will become the minority.   Will the majority of the white race acted in time to save themselves from being submerged into other races?  In every past advanced civilization built by the white race, allowing too many peoples of color where they become the majority have destroyed that advanced civilization.  There has to be a certain critical mass of intelligent genes to maintain an advanced civilization!  This reality cannot be avoided by endless pumping of money into affirmative action, Head Start, public housing, etc.  The only future solution is selective breeding.  </p>

		<p>I generally agree with Mr. Williams but not on his final point.  We should not make it easier to emigrate to the US.  We should halt all immigration.  We have enough unemployment to fill any job available.  We have enough under-employment of white males over 40 to fill any technical position.  We need to stop welfare so that our underclass is forced to work.  The last thing we need is more people or more diversity.  Let&rsquo;s sort things out first before deciding to add to the non-melting pot.<br>

		<p>Williams is right when he says we need to start strict enforcement of immigration laws and border security, but when he says that we need to &#8220;modernize and streamline our cumbersome immigration laws so that people can more easily migrate to it our country,&#8221; I would change the word &#8220;people&#8221; to &#8220;white Europeans.&#8221; We don&rsquo;t need more &#8220;people.&#8221; We need more white people.</p>
<p>Also, I disagree with his emphasis on legality and rights in general. Asking whether everybody in the world has the &#8220;right&#8221; to live here is irrelevant for the simple reason that there are no such things as &#8220;rights.&#8221; Rights are a legal fiction. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what the Constitution says or what the law says or anything else. If you can&rsquo;t defend your rights, you don&rsquo;t have any. Just ask the Japanese Americans who were interned during the second world war. They were Americans, right? The government saw them as a menace, so it&rsquo;s simply suspended their rights. George Carlin figured this out a long time ago. We don&rsquo;t have rights. What we have are revocable privileges granted to us by our masters.</p>
<p>Does everyone in the world have the right to live in the United States? The question gets it backwards, if you ask me. If someone can get over here one way or another and they have the political strength to maintain their position in this country, then YES they also have the &#8220;right&#8221; to live here. Might makes right and might makes &#8220;rights.&#8221; That&rsquo;s just the way it is.</p>
<p>As far as &#8220;legality&#8221; goes, I couldn&rsquo;t care less that Mexicans living in the United States are here illegally. I&rsquo;m not against &#8220;illegal immigration&#8221; because it&rsquo;s illegal. I&rsquo;m against it for purely racial reasons. Racial and cultural. I guess that makes me a racist, but so be it.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;mot exactly sure this is the right question.</p>
<p>I think a better question to ask is who would choose to live in our communities with us, according to our laws, values and mores, linked to us by family bonds, when welfare, crime and access to the drug trade are removed from the equation.</p>
<p>Immigration isn&rsquo;t really about immigration.  The issue is a red herring.  It doesn&rsquo;t exist as an issue when this other thing is removed.</p>
<p>If we told non-whites tommorow, as many as they want can come here but there will be no welfare of any kind (including access to free education, healthcare, housing etc.) and we will punish severely anyone who disobeys our laws, the number who would come under those terms would be extremely small.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what has changed with regard to immigration over the last several generations.  There was never a time when non-whites were not allowed in the US.  Where those seeking to cross the border were turned back by troops.  What has changed is we have allowed incredible amounts of welfare and other redistribution of wealth into the hands on non-whites.  And they have paid back our generousity by funneling most of that money into the drug trade&hellip;.and turned ultra-violent to boot.</p>
<p>We could meet these people with arms.  We could round them up and give them the boot and place an army on our border.  But that really isn&rsquo;t necessary.  What IS necessary is to seperate non-whites from socialism.  Stop taking away from our own people to give to them and they will VANISH.</p>
<p>In a way, this isn&rsquo;t really a choice anymore.  As is usual, california leads the way with regard to these issues.  Welfare, in california is essentially collapsing.  Soon, it will cease to exist.  People (unfortunately ALL people&hellip;not just non-whites) will show up at the welfare office and it will simply be closed, with a big padlock on the door.  The popular opinion is this will result in rioting.  But I don&rsquo;t think so.  Instead, I think the result will be a mass exodus of mexicans from california.</p>
<p>They will try to move on to other states but no state or even collection of states, has now or ever had the resources california had.  Non-whites moving to any nearby state in any appreciable numbers will simply cause welfare there to collapse&hellip;.immediately.  Sooner or later, probably much sooner than later, these people will self-deport because of this.</p>
<p>Actually, it&rsquo;s already begun.  Best estimates I&rsquo;ve seen are about 2 million non-whites have left the US because of &#8220;the economy&#8221;.  This is nothing more than a euphemism for they aren&rsquo;t getting as much welfare as they used to.  Interesting to note that it doesn&rsquo;t take welfare to be disappear completely.  Alot of people leave simply because they aren&rsquo;t getting a certain amount.  It&rsquo;s a scaled thing.</p>
<p>Why is this important?  Well, think about what Ron Paul wants to do with welfare.  Not dismantle it outright but sort of wean people off of it over time with small, but regular decreases over a set schedule backed by presidential veto of the budget if congress refuses to comply with small, reasonable cuts to welfare according to that schedule.  Dismantlement of the warfare/welfare state as he likes to put it.  What would be the result of that?  Based on the observation of non-whites leaving over not getting a certain amount of welfare (as opposed to welfare at all), it would probably cause a substantial steady movement of non-whites out of our country, over time.  They will leave, rather than tighten their belt, is the issue.  The more it is cut, the more will leave.</p>
<p>Understand this about non-whites and welfare.  It&rsquo;s not about them being able to support themselves.  It&rsquo;s the greedy stealing of wealth to funnel into their sick drug industry.  They don&rsquo;t come here to find a better life or to support themselves (they can do that just fine in mexico or other areas south of the border).  It&rsquo;s about profit&hellip;.making a profit by abusing our social institutions.  If they can&rsquo;t make a certain amount of profit, they suddenly don&rsquo;t want to be here.  They do not really want to live here.  They don&rsquo;t want free healthcare, schooling, food and a place to live&hellip;even at our expense.  They want to get rich addicting our poor and children to their disgusting drugs.  They want to pimp whores in our communities.  They want to work slaves in our lands.  But they only want to do these things if they can get rich doing it.</p>
<p>And whether or not they can, is completely within OUR control if only we open our eyes, see what they are doing, and put a stop to it.</p>

<p>There is another issue. One that asks is constant immigration needed? The answer is no. No country needs constant and steady immigration. Small amounts of immigration of carefully chosen people can add fresh blood and skills but not constant immigration. Any nation needs a time out on this. Frankly, the US is one such country. We are in a recession. As such, we don&rsquo;t need immigration now or for several years.  In my opinion, immigration needs to be halted unless one marries a citizen, one is some scientific or medical genius, there is a genuine shortage in a field, or someone is coming to open a business.</p>

<p>I get it.  Deport the 30 million or so Mexican and other latino immigrants and replace them with 30 million legal Mexicans and other latinos.  Better yet, &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221; could make all 30 million or so illegals return to their countries of origin, stop at the nearest US embassy and pickup their green cards and return to the US, all within 24 hours.  That way there won&rsquo;t be any more Mexicans driving on our roads under the influence or without insurance, our schools will magically improve, the drain on the taxpayers will stop, the gangs will disband and they&rsquo;ll all become flag waiving Americans eating apple pie and singing Yankee Doodle.  </p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t get anymore stupid than this.</p>

		<p>Except for the last sentence, I agree with Walter Williams far more than I do with white liberals.  Given that legal immigration is already far above one million a year, I think that it&rsquo;s too easy to immigrate legally.<br>

<p>I take issue with that!  Why blindly accept the proposition that we need to facilitate immigration AT ALL?  </p>
<p>Legally or illegally, so what? I think they come here much too easily either way.  Who says that immigration is essential to our national well being?  Why must we just accept it without a murmur of doubt?</p>

		<p>I have another idea; allow the entire Third and Fourth Worlds permission to live in the US, while the rest of us Americans, Canadians, Argentines, Europeans, Russians, Japanese, Australians the money and equipment to settle the moon and Mars.  I&rsquo;d like Mars.  It&rsquo;d make a good rifle range.  We could call it an &#8220;amicable divorce&#8221;.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what we are going to be allowed, is it?</p>

		<p>All immigration laws and common sensibilities aside, the physical constraints of the nation cannot support many more people than are here now. The only thing that would happen with mass immigration (and is happening now) is that the population relocating here will turn America into what they just left.</p>

		<p>The question is similar to: who is White? Anglo-Scotch Americans who descend from Colonial times have the most right to live in America, followed by pre-1830 immigrants. Anyone else is merely a junior partner. But these Old Americans, as Ales Hrdlicka called them, are the sleeping small town rural vanguard in the South and Pacific NW that today&rsquo;s WN leaders like Jared Taylor &amp; Kevin MacDonald should be meeting now. Especially JT with all his MSM exposure&hellip;JT was even on the Queen Latifah Show.</p>

		<p>Study what the anti racists say about White people. You will find a recurring theme that wherever Whites gather in groups, racism breaks out of its hiding places and runs wild.  The only way to combat racism is to keep Whites either surrounded or infiltrated with non whites.</p>
<p>White America must be racist because it is White, therefore, we must let the world, which is 92% non white, come and cure America of its original sin.</p>

		<p>To those of you who think ending welfare will make the immigrants go home without prodding - you are wrong.  Unless we are proactive with removing the invaders they will simply become squatters.  We will have shanty towns filled with hispanics, just like Brazil does.  These people have nothing to go home to.  Calderon and his ilk don&rsquo;t want them back.  We are Latin America&rsquo;s pressure relief valve.  You can live in a shanty in Honduras or in California.  And even without welfare a white run America (or even a heavily influenced by whites America) is more humane than anything south of the border.<br>

		<p>I believe the U.N. has even passed a resolution to the affect it&rsquo;s a human right to be able to live where ever one would like. This contradicts with the rights of whites to exist. In multiracial societies whites become smaller and smaller in number while every other race grows in number. Perhaps multiculturalism Would work out perfectly in a society without whites. </p>

		<p>Who has the &#8220;right&#8221; to live in the United States of America?</p>
<p>No one really has any kind of a right to land, the land was here before us and will be here once we are gone. The Native Americans understood this logic better than the white man. </p>
<p>A territory is controlled by the group of people that is strongest. For we white people to have any claim on the land we have to be able to defend it. The Indians understood that the white man didn&rsquo;t steal the land we won it fair and square just like they did. </p>
<p>Now we can either fight for the land or be to cowardly and lazy to do anything and sit on our behinds while others come in and take it away. Sooner or later they will be stronger and it will be our children&rsquo;s children that will be looking for a place to live. <br>
 No one has rights to any thing, you have what you can take and what you can hold. That&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;s always been and the way it will continue to be. </p>

I guess that makes me a racist, but so be it.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>Exactly, legality has very little to do with it although we most certainly do need a legal manner of entrance.</p>
<p><b>&#8220;Most importantly, modernize and streamline our cumbersome immigration laws so that people can more easily migrate to our country.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>There are multiple things wrong with this statement. As indicated above. We don&rsquo;t necessarily need to make it easier for people to migrate but we do need to revisit and alter the 1965 immigration act. Be very selective on just who we let migrate here. With race and culture issues being paramount plus education and need factors.   </p>

		<p>I asked a pro-mass-immigration family member if the U.S. should actually have totally open borders, given that the planet&rsquo;s population is 7 million.  He replied affirmatively, since  &mdash;  he claims  &mdash;  not everyone would WANT to come here!!  This person lives, as I do, in a white rural community untroubled (so far) by ghetto thugs or Mexican drug dealers.  He might think differently if bullets were plowing through his bay window!<br>
If we allow droves of third-worlders in, we will become a third-world nation.</p>

		<p>I have pointed out the insanity of our immigration policy to people many times. That our nation simply cannot accommodate every one of the probably at least three BILLION who would come here, given the opportunity. It&rsquo;s simple arithmetic. Raise our population to 600 MILLION-PLUS and you double our pollution, along with the overuse of fresh water to feed those 600 million. You deplete natural resources at exactly DOUBLE the present rate&hellip; and so on and on.</p>
<p>Shut the damned door NOW! Enough already. We need at least a 20-year moratorium on ALL immigration. While our economy receovers. Until we have jobs for everyone wanting to work.</p>

<p>The majority of America&rsquo;s new influx of third-world foreigners comes as parasites to colonize and not to assimilate.  </p>
<p>They cleave to their own languages, cultures and they wave their own flags.</p>
<p>American citizenship is a means to bring their entire families and to vote for the wretches that promise them the sun and moon.  </p>
<p>These interlopers are not our friends nor are they to be trusted and they will never act in our country&rsquo;s best interest.  </p>
<p>Because they have extremely low levels of intelligence they are easily manipulated by America&rsquo;s communists.  </p>
<p>Corporate America is driving this to gain new customers and the Democratic Party is driving this to gain new voters.  </p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;What has changed is we have allowed incredible amounts of welfare and other redistribution of wealth into the hands of non-whites&hellip;. What IS necessary is to separate non-Whites from socialism. Stop taking away from our own people to give to them and they will VANISH&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>You wrote a very good post and made a number of important points:  Welfare MUST be cut off as it grows a parasitic, seething underclass and is a magnet for the dirt poor of the world to come here by any means necessary to live off of Free White Money in perpetuity.</p>
<p>Anyone accepting welfare of ANY SORT should be mandated by the government to be fitted with an IUD, Norplant or undergo government-paid for sterilization.</p>
<p>But as the government is not working in the interests of Whites, is in fact opposed to White interests and is actively seeking White demise, it encourages non-White irresponsible breeding, immigration and expansion into White cities and neighborhoods of (r)-factor non-Whites.</p>
<p>I was going to make several other points but Istavan beat me to it!  To his fine post I would only add that there will not only be massive, seething shanty towns surrounding White communities, as in apartheid-era SA,  but violence as well, and lots of it, directed at the &#8216;haves&rsquo;  &mdash;   Whites.  The black-on-White violence currently happening in SA  &mdash;  torture-murders, rape-murders, dismemberments, slashings, and hackings of White elderly and children WILL happen here. </p>
<p>Remember:  The Free Education the US stupidly offers to ALL comers, legal, illegal, refugee is completely saturated in egalitarian mythology  &mdash;  any White/non-White inequities are blamed on White Oppression.</p>
<p>Non-Whites are told that all of their problems are due to White Oppression and White Racism.  Poverty?  You, as a non-White are poor because the economy is zero-sum and Whites made you poor, took away your portion of the &#8216;pie&rsquo;.  School failure?  Not your fault if you&rsquo;re non-White!  You live in an Oppressive White society surrounded by White Racism!  Criminal tendencies?  Don&rsquo;t worry if you&rsquo;re non-White!  You are a victim of White society, the media won&rsquo;t report your crimes AND you will never be accused of Hate Crimes because only Whites, the &#8216;haves&rsquo; and &#8216;oppressors&rsquo; can be guilty of Hate Crimes and Hate Speech. </p>
<p>Whites are being set-up, on purpose, to be the recipients of non-White targeted violence.  The true purveyors of egalitarian lies and White Hatred, those who direct non-White to despise Whites, will also blame Whites  &mdash;  when they should be the recipients of vitriol for the lies, hatred and hostility they&rsquo;ve directed at Whites for the past 50 years.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s no moral imperative to immigration,  it&rsquo;s a policy of genocide against white America (actually that&rsquo;s the moral imperative to the left).   The whole argument isn&rsquo;t about immigration per se,  it&rsquo;s about race.   Anyone who favors border control is guilty of secretly desiring to maintain the existence of white people and their civilization,  in other words is a racist.   That&rsquo;s why most establishment critics of our immigration policies can&rsquo;t simply come out for a moratorium or a great reduction in immigration numbers,  they have to talk about streamlining legal immigration, etc.   You&rsquo;ll never stop the invasion until you truthfully acknowledge its nature - its a policy of genocide against white America.   Whining about whether individual invaders hold certain pieces of paper is simply a cowardly avoidance of the real issue.   The system will simply legalize such huge numbers that the point will become moot,  leaving the &#8220;I&rsquo;m just against ILLEGAL immigration&#8221;  crowd standing around with their slack jaws open.   That is in fact what the Senate attempted to do a couple of years ago,  the &#8220;anti-ILLEGALS&#8221; were against it but couldn&rsquo;t say why.   </p>

		<p>I believe that if we turn off the magnets, the vast majority of illegal aliens will self-deport.  Heavily fine and file criminal charges against any American business who uses illegals.  Ditto with anyone who houses them.  End all welfare.  There is absolutely no reason for any able-bodied citizen not to work. </p>
<p>Also we need to legalize prostitution and all drugs and tax and regulate them.  That will not only get rid of the gangs, but any reason for the government to interfere in our private business to &#8220;protect&#8221; us from drugs and prostitution.  Companies will continue drug-testing their employees to keep from being financially liable for any employee who is high enough on the job to cause an accident.  </p>
<p>We also need to end the anchor baby loophole.  First, by making it impossible for an anchor baby to get other family members in when s/he is eighteen and then put in a Constitutional amendment requiring any baby to be born here be produced by parents who have a legal right to be here in the first place before s/he is considered a legal citizen.<br>

		<p>To those of you who think ending welfare will make the immigrants go home without prodding - you are wrong.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There is no way to know this one way or another.  However, it will be a heck of alot easier to start by cutting their welfare than to start the process of using armed force against them.</p>
<p>Strong arguments can be made that both are inevitable.  In the end, we really will not be allowed to choose if we do these things or not. The choices will be forced on us.</p>
<p>I am simply suggesting that the welfare angle is a good place to start and this is being forced on us now as welfare is collapsing outright.  In other words, we will see in california (very soon) what happens when welfare is cut off.  After it happens in california, it will spread.</p>
<p>My opinion is, though, that it takes incredible effort, money and resources to keep non-whites in the US, not to keep them out.  That&rsquo;s why the democrats were willing to risk everything to get Obamacare passed no matter what.  And it&rsquo;s why they focus on amnesty no matter how unpopular it is.  Then they will try to drastically increase taxes to keep welfare from failing.  They have to do something, anything, to keep these people from leaving.</p>
<p>They will fail.  After they fail, we should do whatever it takes to finish the job.  That might take alot.  But somehow I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>

		<p>The purpose, means, and ends for the USA is delineated in the Preamble to the US Constitution. Illegal immigration and unjust and/or excessive legal immigration are extremely inimical to the same on the same scale as the more direct forms of invasion and warfare. When our government refuses to demonstrate it&rsquo;s loyalty to the US Constitution and the Preamble to the same, the American people must exercise it&rsquo;s right to change that political system which treasonously has overthrown the fundamental rights of the American people as enumerated in the U.S. Constitution and the Preamble to the same.</p>

The question then becomes, who should be eligible to immigrate to the US?<br>
Anyone that wants?<br>
Or should there be conditions?<br>
Seems like we need to screen people for their intelligence, training, and potential for being successful on their own and making a contribution to the country that allows them in.<br>
we also need to screen those for their potential for criminality and liklihood of taking advantage of handouts, as well.</p>
