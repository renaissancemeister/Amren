			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Cheryl Wetzstein, Newsmax, May 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An undercover investigation into the federal government&rsquo;s Head Start program has found enough enrollment abuses to generate a report to President Obama and a major damage-control effort by the agency that runs the program.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fraudulent enrollment is &#8220;a blatant violation of Head Start&rsquo;s rules.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Our administration will not stand for it,&#8221; Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a letter Monday to Education and Labor Committee Chairman George Miller, California Democrat.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In testimony presented to the House panel Tuesday, GAO special investigations official Gregory D. Kutz said that in at least eight cases, Head Start employees &#8220;manipulated&#8221; information to admit ineligible children.</p>
<p>Enrollment rules were so lax, he warned, that Head Start workers could easily &#8220;doctor&#8221; enrollment applications, and families could enter the program with &#8220;bogus&#8221; documents created at home.</p>
<p>Out of 15 visits, there was no evidence of enrollment fraud in seven places, including two in Washington, D.C., and one in Maryland, Mr. Kutz said in his testimony.</p>
<p>But in Wisconsin, one Head Start worker looked at the incomes of two agents posing as a grandpa and a grandma, and &#8220;picked&#8221; one of the incomes to report.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other abuses included admitting a family who lived outside the Head Start service area, ignoring proof of employment, and admitting extraordinarily high numbers of &#8220;homeless&#8221; children. Under new rules, homeless children are automatically eligible for Head Start.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The GAO also found two Head Start families who reported incomes &#8220;in excess of $110,000,&#8221; and that 63 children were counted more than once to make centers appear fully enrolled.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Carmen R. Nazario, HHS assistant secretary for the administration for children and families, told the committee that HHS would take swift action against misbehaving grantees, and was already in the process of upgrading integrity standards, reminding grantees of Head Start rules, and conducting unannounced visits to centers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Head Start, created 45 years ago as a &#8220;war on poverty&#8221; program, receives $7 billion a year. Last year, it received an extra $2 billion under the stimulus bill, and the Obama administration has requested another $1 billion for it for 2011.</p>
<p>Head Start&rsquo;s main purpose is to narrow the school-readiness gap by giving poor preschoolers free educational, medical, nutritional and social services.</p>
<p>Early studies have showed that Head Start services pay off when the children start school.</p>
<p>But in January, a massive, 10-year study found that by the time Head Start children finish first grade, they score no better than non-Head Start children on most of 112 measures.</p>
<p>Head Start proponents have tried to downplay the devastating results, but the program&rsquo;s critics say they have heard enough happy talk about Head Start.</p>

		<p>Years ago, when my son was about two years, a teacher I knew who was apparently a huge fan of the Head Start program, asked me if I was going to put my son in the HS program.  I asked her why, because I thought it was for underpriveleged kids.  I told her we were neither underpriveleged, nor were we incapable of getting our own darn child ready for kindergarten.  She warned me that our child would be so far behind the other children, he would probably NEVER catch up.  Well, fast forward a few years, and I ran into her after not having seen her a long time.  I made sure I informed her that our left behind child was in the national honor society with the highest grade point average there is, and he had never made below an A in school.  HA, I wanted to say stick that in your pipe. So, after reading this article, I sure am glad I kept him home and taught him myself, or the Head Start people might have really put him behind the other kids.  </p>

<p>Look at all they&rsquo;ve tried in order to get blacks to learn on a normal level, besides this head start nonsense, all failing miserably.</p>
<p>The only time the truth will be told about black lack of learning abilities is if the country splits wide open and chaos is the order of the day.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, that&rsquo;s EXACTLY where we&rsquo;re headed.  And not at some future time way down the road, but right now&hellip;.this year.<br>
In fact it&rsquo;s beginning to show signs of chaos right now.</p>

<p>Right you are Q. All the dire predictions are cast so far in the future that most of us will have passed on BUT! this breakdown is  moving along exponentially toward civil, social and racial chaos that the best investment a White person can make right now is GUNS AND AMMO! and maybe MREs</p>

		<p>As I&rsquo;m sure the informed people here know, attendees of Head Start do show some modest improvement relative to their peers when they first leave the program, but by the time they&rsquo;re juniors or seniors in high school a prior enrollment in Head Start has no discernible effect.  This is consistent with a broader group of IQ vs. environment studies.  Perhaps the most unintuitive result of these studies is that the heritable part of IQ becomes more significant the older you get, and the environmentally determined part of IQ becomes smaller.  This is contrary to the commonsense view that the longer you live the more time there is for environment to modify your IQ.  Instead, IQ at maturity is more like a hill top that is pretty much fixed at birth, and environment determines the path you take to get there.  You might go straight up early on in your life, or you might mosey along some switchbacks, but ultimately you wind up at the same place.  If more of the graduates of our teachers&rsquo; colleges were aware of these studies they&rsquo;d be a lot less starry eyed about programs like Head Start.  (And more worried about the dysgenic consequences of welfare.)</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t go to nursery school or kindergarten.  (It wasn&rsquo;t treated as mandatory back then.)  My first formal schooling was first grade.  I do remember being very bored in first grade reading class because the kid reading the book out loud would be speaking&hellip; each&hellip; word&hellip; very&hellip; slowly&hellip; while I had long since read to the bottom of the page.  I did just fine, and have an advanced degree in a technical subject.  I agree with Mark Twain that you shouldn&rsquo;t let your schooling interfere with your education.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a high school teacher in Los Angeles and I can attest to the fact that EVERY SINGLE program, such as Head Start, is implemented without any data to suggest they will produce the student benefits they claim to offer.  I&rsquo;ve taught after school classes through a program called Beyond The Bell to prepare 12th grade seniors to pass the exit exam (roughly 8th grade level material). They are exactly like regular classes.  Rather than studying to pass the test and graduate, students do little work, are disruptive and argumentative, or simply don&rsquo;t show up at all.  Not another penny for these bureaucrats and their welfare state.  </p>

		<p>The original aim  &mdash;  or selling point  &mdash;  of closing the attainment gap has long wanted for evidence of efficacy.  Having intersected Head Start programs in particular school settings in which I used to work, I&rsquo;ve found clear indication that some individuals have apparently had their performance boosted on a somewhat enduring basis. However, these individual instances over time are so infrequent they are dwarfed by group comparisons.  I have never understood why anecdotal evidence has to be entirely discarded and ignored.  I believe it betokens a kind of academic &#8220;publish or perish&#8221; fetish ?  Conventional studies have indicated in some instances a broad degree of enduring value in terms of social adjustment and reducation of crime proneness as shown between experimental and control groups.  Beyond this, is the evident fact that many of the Black children, in particular, have for a time in their lives a few hours of pleasant environment in Head Start and safe and <br>
charitable environment.  That there has to be some larger &#8220;pay off&#8221; is easier arrived at from afar than from close up to those of us who&rsquo;ve been there, seen them.   These facts of the matter do not arbitrate the larger question of whether the Program should be funded anywhere near present levels or should be recast, or terminated etc.  Acknowledging facts is not a matter of making concessions to &#8220;the enemy&#8221;.  It is a favor we do ourselves.  A further example, is the $PLC program of &#8220;Teaching Tolerance&#8221;.  Wrong-headed as portions are and based on an anchronistic set of assumptions from &#8220;the Franfort School&#8221;, elements of this Program are fully commendable right across the political spectrum ( &#8220;mix it up&#8221; . e.g., ) Fidelity to truth and principle demands clear discriminations, if that is the term we may use.  </p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s waste in the Head Start program, so they say.</p>
<p>Sorry, I&rsquo;m not a big fan of redundancies.</p>
<p>The whole HS program has been a waste, and a colossal $150 billion expensive since the 1960s epic fail.  HHS, which runs HS, largely admits that now.</p>
<p>The reason it&rsquo;s a failure is because it didn&rsquo;t raise black academic success in the long run.  The reason it didn&rsquo;t do that is that HS is given to children at about the age period in life when blacks just happen to be maturing mentally (and physically) faster than whites.  So if you send them all to a proto-school environment like HS, of course the black will do rather well.  But they tend to level off in terms of brain development (but not physically) around age 10, while whites&rsquo; brains tend to mature for several more years.</p>

<p>WR, the results of the failure of Head Start appear MUCH sooner than high school. </p>
<p>The Cato Institute reports (Jan, 2010):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Results released today from the Impact Study show that children&rsquo;s gains from participating in Head Start, documented in a 2005 installment of the study, do not last through the end of 1st grade&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Response from the government (viz. the exact same report)?:</p>
<p>HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius responds: &ldquo;Research clearly shows that Head Start positively impacts the school readiness of low-income children!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/yg8danf" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/yg8danf</a></p>
<p>Also:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Regarding mood and behavior problems, such as aggressiveness, depression or hyperactivity, Head Start reduced some of these problems in 3-year-olds but not in 4-year-olds&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Professor Jensen of Berkeley explains why Head Start is doomed to fail in perpetuity:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; He suspects that real, underlying intelligence  &mdash;  what he calls g  &mdash;  cannot be improved by instruction. He thinks that in the Milwaukee Project, children were taught specific ways to take certain IQ tests but he says &#8216;g remained unaffected.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/2dqeg7q" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2dqeg7q</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, according to The Cato Institute, not one msm outlet felt this was worth reporting to the American taxpayers who foot the bill for this monstrosity:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;A day after it was released, here&rsquo;s a roundup of how the mainstream media are covering the HHS study showing that America&rsquo;s $100 billion plus investment in Head Start is a failure:</p>
<p>[&hellip; crickets&hellip;]</p>
<p>Nada&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>But then are you surprised?</p>

		<p>My wife and I made certain that our children understood basic phonetic and mathematical principals before they were ever in kindergarten. Counting reading simple words all things that can easily be accomplished by a 3-4 year old. </p>
<p>Our children went to daycare and they received some remedial teaching there as well. As far as blacks being able to sustain long term benefits from a program like head start the results speak for themselves.</p>
<p> I wonder how many of those screaming youths who have participated in the flash riots went to head start. Do they have any idea of the catastrophic investment that has been made in them only to have it proven a catastrophic failure.<br>
