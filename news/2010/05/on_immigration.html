			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Murray, MSNBC, May 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>White and Latino Americans are deeply divided over immigration, their allegiances to the nation&rsquo;s political parties and their opinions about President Barack Obama, according to a new NBC/MSNBC/Telemundo poll.</p>
<p>And in the wake of Arizona&rsquo;s controversial anti-illegal immigration law, the survey suggests that Republicans could get an immediate political boost, but may face a long-term problem among Latinos, the nation&rsquo;s fastest-growing demographic group.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Breaking down the white-Latino divide</b></p>
<p>In the poll, 61 percent say they favor Arizona&rsquo;s new anti-illegal immigration law, {snip}.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a divide among white and Latino respondents: 70 percent of whites support the law, versus just 31 percent of Latinos. In fact, 58 percent of Latinos say they strongly oppose it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the only chasm between White and Latino America. While 68 percent of Latinos believe that immigration strengthens the United States, just 43 percent of whites think that.</p>
<p>And they differ in their perceptions about Obama and the political parties. Although the president&rsquo;s job-approval rating sits at 48 percent overall, down two points from an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll earlier this month, only 38 percent of whites approve of Obama&rsquo;s job, versus 68 percent of Latinos who do.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, 37 percent of whites view the Republican Party favorably, while just 22 percent of Latinos have a favorable impression of the GOP.</p>
<p>And although only 34 percent of whites hold a favorable opinion of the Democratic Party, 54 percent of Latinos view the party in a positive light.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Short-term and long-term political fallout</b></p>
<p>According to the poll, Arizona&rsquo;s law could benefit Republicans in the short term if they choose to make it a campaign issue. {snip}</p>
<p>Forty percent of registered voters say they would side with a Republican congressional candidate who supports the law, compared with 26 percent who would back a Democratic candidate who opposes it.</p>
<p>In particular, Hart notes that women over 50 and white suburban women  &mdash;  who tend to support generic Democratic congressional candidates  &mdash;  are more inclined to vote for a Republican who supports the Arizona law.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Latinos remain a sleeping  &mdash;  yet growing  &mdash;  political giant. In the poll, 23 percent of Latino respondents said they aren&rsquo;t registered to vote, versus 12 percent of whites and 16 percent of African Americans.</p>
<p>In addition, Latinos under the age of 40 have a stronger attachment to President Obama (73 percent of them approve of his job) and a stronger dislike of Arizona&rsquo;s law (75 percent of them oppose it) than older Latinos do.</p>
<p>And Latinos young and old think Democrats would do a better job than Republicans in protecting the interests of minorities (58-11 percent), in representing the opportunity to move up the economic ladder (46-20 percent), in dealing with immigration (37-12 percent) and in promoting strong moral values (33-23 percent).</p>
<p>The only advantage that they gave Republicans was in enforcing security along the U.S.-Mexico border (31-20 percent). </p>
<p><b>Early support for comprehensive immigration reform</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yet the NBC/MSNBC/Telemundo poll shows early public support for comprehensive immigration reform, with 60 percent of all adults favoring it and 29 percent opposing it.</p>
<p>Also, supermajorities back the individual components of this reform.</p>
<p>For example: 73 percent support imposing new fines on businesses that hire illegal immigrants; 71 percent support increasing border security by building a fence along the border and training more Border Patrol agents; and 65 percent support allowing undocumented immigrants who are already in the country to pay a fine, learn English and go to the back of the line for the opportunity to become U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>McInturff, however, cautions against reading too much into this early support  &mdash;  given that the poll didn&rsquo;t test the language that opponents of comprehensive immigration reform would use. In addition, he points out that only 19 percent of all adults say they strongly favor the legislation, which suggests soft support.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Other results</b></p>
<p>Here are some other results from the NBC/MSNBC/Telemundo poll:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>* And 49 percent say the U.S. should continue to grant citizenship to all children born in the United States, versus 46 percent who believe the law should be changed so that children of illegal immigrants are not automatically granted citizenship. (Among Latinos, a whopping 79 percent believe the country should continue to grant automatic citizenship.)<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s truly amazing that that this poll indicates that 43% of White people could actually think that immigration strengthens the U.S.  Or maybe they were not being specific enough.  What kind of immigration do 43% of Whites believe strengthens us?  Seventy percent of whites supporting Arizona&rsquo;s new law is not enough, not nearly enough.  It should be 95-100% of Whites, just like 95-100% of Blacks were in favor of Obama&rsquo;s election.  When that happens we&rsquo;ll know Whites are awakening.</p>

		<p>How come I didn&rsquo;t see any black opinions?  Blacks are even less enthusiastic about the Hispanic takeover than whites so I suppose they have to leave them out.  Sort of like the black/white education divide, Asians are never mentioned because it doesn&rsquo;t support the MSMs agenda.</p>
<p>And what is the break between Hispanic-Americans and foreign born and the children of foreign born Hispanics?  This poll seems a little fishy.</p>
<p>Of course foreign born and first generation Hispanics see Latino immigration as a strength because it is strengthening their foot soldiers in the take over of America.  They also favor birth right citizenship for the same reason.  These polls make about as much sense as asking a German soldier in 1940 Paris if he approved of the take over of France.<br>

		<p>&ldquo;White and Latino Americans are deeply divided over immigration, their allegiances to the nation&rsquo;s political parties and their opinions about President Barack Obama, according to a new NBC/MSNBC/Telemundo poll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How predictably laughable; as if any poll run by NBC/MSNBC/Telemundo, could be considered even remotely unbiased!</p>
<p>They are so fecklessly blinded by their multicultural (NBC/MSNBC) and Raza (Telemundo) dogmas, that they make assumptions and calculations in both their questions and analysis of the obtained responses, so as to turn &ldquo;reality&rdquo; into a Red phantasmagoria of  wretched whimsy. Take for example, this gem of insight:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Latinos remain a sleeping &mdash; yet growing &mdash; political giant. In the poll, 23 percent of Latino respondents said they aren&rsquo;t registered to vote, versus 12 percent of whites and 16 percent of African Americans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This Latino &ldquo;sleeping &mdash; yet growing &mdash; political giant,&rdquo; is not inevitably a given, regardless of their current (or future) opinions on American politics and their greedy entitlement focused support of the Democrats within that assumed nexus. That is to say, we are not yet, nor do we have to become a white minority country. Quite the contrary, if current trends in white political activism and racial awareness should begin to slowly accelerate, Republicans might find a long-term advantage in boosting it to light speed every chance they get. That is, if they can transform themselves from the stupid party and into the survival party.</p>
<p>I know many here find this a doubtful future occurrence, but stranger things have happened.</p>
<p>Hey, I say, may God let it be so!<br>

		<p>On immigration, the political party &#8220;divide&#8221; runs deep.  Watch congressional Democrats give the Mexican president a 17-second standing ovation when he slams the Arizona immigration law in a speech to Congress   &mdash;  - starting at the 2 minutes, 5 seconds mark in this May 20, 2010 video clip:</p>
<p>Set-up:</p>
<p>President Felipe Calderon: &ldquo;&hellip;I strongly disagree with the recently adopted law in Arizona.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Democrats jump to their feet and clap:<br>

That 43% probably includes Hispanic &#8220;Whites.&#8221; Also, liberal Whites who want Democrats to keep and expand power will answer yes on these question so that the % will be higher and momentum of &#8220;welcoming tolerance&#8221; will be projected by the polls.  These Whites don&rsquo;t live in or near communities that are being Mexicanized.  Sort of like yankees who wanted to solve all the Southern race problems, but never invited all our problems to come and help diversify their own neighborhoods up north.</p>
<p>Progressives always have solutions to other people&rsquo;s problems, and they never bear the expense of their proposed solutions, but they are powerful enough to use the force of government to make us suffer what they never will suffer themselves.  Maybe unlimited immigration and amnesty will find them and introduce them to the non white world.<br>

		<p>Why would anyone take a poll by Telemundo seriously?  Obviously, it&rsquo;s a fabrication.  The entire immigration &#8220;issue&#8221; is a fabrication.  Almost 100% of everyone, except mestizos has turned militantly anti-immigrant.  The controversy only exists in the media.  It does not exist even to the slightest extent even in the strongest bastions of liberalism.</p>
<p>An example.  LA decides to boycott arizona.  Yet a poll (a reliable yet completely ignored/buried poll) of the population of LA reveals that over 90% of them are against that.  That&rsquo;s in LA&hellip;.only san francisco (or north korea) is possibly worse on the liberalism scale.  Elsewhere, the only people even slightly opposed are those who don&rsquo;t think pro-immigrant politicans should be jailed for treason.  It&rsquo;s like&hellip;hmmm, should immigrants be deported&hellip;.or should they be dropped by plane from the sky without parachutes over mexico city.  Seriously.  Ask around.  See if you can find a single person who isn&rsquo;t rabidly anti-immigrant.  If you do, congratulations.  Time to consider moving out of the bario.</p>
<p>Another example&hellip;..video coverage of the (really tiny yet heavily covered in print only media with no pictures) demonstrations in support of amnesty.  Number of people there who are not mestizos?  Zero.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t exist as an issue except in our controlled media trying to instill doubt in the voting public.  There is CONSENSUS.  We want these chuckleheads gone&hellip;and we aren&rsquo;t too concerned about how.</p>

		<p>I agree with Celtic Muse. The hypocrisy of white (many times NORTHERN) liberals disgusts me. I am a Southerner who is currently living in the wrong state, and I would like to move back South as quickly as possible.  </p>
<p>The next time I hear a white liberal in my office say &#8220;white people are illegal immigrants from Europe&#8221; I am going to explode.  The hypocrisy and hatred in that statement of theirs&rsquo; is deafening.  </p>
<p>I want to ask them: &#8220;if the white people who came over here and created this great nation were the real illegals since they &#8216;killed off&rsquo; the Indians, then why oh why are you living here reaping the benefits&hellip;.why not go back to Europe?&#8221;.  They make me sicker than sick!</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think that whites necessarily are against immigration as such, they are merely against illegal immigration and the entire process as it is carried out now. Cheaters, evil doers, those who &#8220;cut in line&#8221; not wanted. You do things the legal, proper, orderly and peaceful way, then welcome. At least that is my perception.</p>

<p>There is going to be long-term political fallout regardless. There is no way the GOP can &#8220;out-pander&#8221; the Dems. And it would be foolish to even try. The only question is whether the GOP will take advantage of the short term opportunities while they can.</p>

		<p>I did a 5 year study/survey of myself where I considered 100% of my opinions over those 5 years and found 100% are totally 100% against any immigration at all. This survey is subject to a + or - .001% error. NO hispanics OR blacks were considered in this survey as their opinions don&rsquo;t count according to 100% of the person surveyed:)</p>

		<p>There is only one reason why America was once a great nation and is still a better nation than the countries that comprise Central and Latin America. America is comprised largely of White people of direct northern European descent. The third-worlders clamor to be near us with every fiber of their being because of the order, intelligence, and civilized behavior we have, my friends. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, people of color, by the very hand of nature, are our polar opposites. Their countries are undesirable places of hell that they wish to escape from. Why? Is something wrong with the earth, water, or climate in their native countries? Of course not! But, there is something wrong with the people there. The problem lies with themselves! That is what they are running from! Their own disorder, lack of intelligence, and uncivilized behavior drives them to be near our good graces! </p>
<p>Undesirables clamor to be near near us, my friends, and some of us   &mdash;   a very wealthy, and powerful few   &mdash;   profit by their existence here. Very disturbing!</p>

		<p>Not really surprising, a lot of older mestizos are smart enough to realize that the more mestizos flood the country, the less of the white man&rsquo;s wealth there is to go around.</p>
<p>As for it being a long-term problem for the Republicans - only if they don&rsquo;t kick out all the illegals and crush the welfare system, making the legals leave as well.</p>
<p>Of course, a massive economic depression would do both just as nicely, and it&rsquo;s probably inevitable anyways.</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;Watch congressional Democrats give the Mexican president a 17-second standing ovation when he slams the Arizona immigration law in a speech to Congress&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Did the Dems not realize this plays directly into the hands of Republican candidates, especially newer candidates that don&rsquo;t have a record of hispanic pandering?</p>
<p>In California, Republican candidates running against barbara boxer are already using this in their campaign ads  &mdash;  showing her jumping enthusiastically to her feet to clap and cheer for a corrupt, foreign leader of a failed Third World oligarchy as he dictates policy to the US Congress. </p>
<p>And from the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Yet the NBC/MSNBC/Telemundo poll shows early public support for comprehensive immigration reform, with 60 percent of all adults favoring it&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Geez, gimme a break.  Does anyone believe that 60% of ALL adults favor amnesty for illegal colonists?  From what I read on this board, enough mexican colonists have penetrated the US far past California  &mdash;  every corner of the US, it seems now  &mdash;   that I cannot in anyway believe this &#8216;statistic&rsquo;, especially as it comes from the likes of telemundo.</p>
<p>Other areas besides the Southwest are experiencing the &#8216;joys&rsquo; of &#8216;diversity&rsquo; via mexican colonization  &mdash;  your once-quiet White neighborhood marked by strewn trash and circling helicopters, your beautiful parks and landmarks covered with gang graffiti, your child&rsquo;s former White school celebrating foreign holidays and catering to those who do not speak English, a huge explosion in costly social services such as free breakfasts and lunches, Section 8 housing, food stamp cards, increased numbers of &#8216;first time&rsquo;, unlicensed drivers  &mdash;  often drunk  &mdash;  behind the wheels of unregistered, uninsured cars, and feral, menacing-looking, tattooed males standing around cat-calling to your beautiful 10-year old daughters and grand-daughters (and make no mistake  &mdash;  I also caught them ogling my young son).</p>
<p>I cannot believe, after listening to and reading others&rsquo; experiences with illegal colonists across the US, in such places as New Hampshire, Montana, N. Dakota, the UP of Michigan  &mdash;   that 60% of ALL adults support amnesty for these welfare parasites.</p>
<p>What I believe is this:  This article is (yet one more) direct attack on Whites via the msm  &mdash;   telling us to &#8216;give up&rsquo; and that it&rsquo;s &#8216;game over&rsquo;  &mdash;  the illegal colonists have won, we have lost and that resistance is futile.</p>
<p>The msm give the impression that the hispanic voting block is so huge, so massive in numbers that we Whites might as well stay home and not vote, but according to non-msm columnist and blogger Steve Sailer:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The monopoly exit poll is asserting that the black share in 2008 (goosed upward by Obama&rsquo;s presence on the ballot) was 13 percent, the Hispanic share was 9 percent, and the White share 74 percent. My guesstimate is that the definitive Census Bureau numbers will be more like 12 percent black, 7 percent Hispanic, and 77 percent white. But the White share could be as low as 75 percent White because McCain did so little to motivate whites to turn out&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/2wvqwm7</p>
<p>If we Whites were allowed by the government to organize ourselves along racial lines, as is every other ethno/racial group (and even encouraged to do so), it would be &#8216;game over&rsquo; for hispanics, blacks and Asians, and the alien, hostile elites in government and msm  &mdash;  and they know it, hence the &#8216;Nazi&rsquo; moniker thrown constantly at the tea partiers, AmRen, V.Dare, OO and OQ by the ADL and SPLC.</p>
<p>Is there anyone out there who still believes anything the White-hating msm print, especially anything about Whites?  Or that the msm actively work against the interests of Whites?</p>

&ldquo;While 68 percent of Latinos believe that immigration strengthens the United States, just 43 percent of whites think that&rdquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think that whites necessarily are against immigration as such, they are merely against illegal immigration and the entire process as it is carried out now. Cheaters, evil doers, those who &ldquo;cut in line&rdquo; not wanted. You do things the legal, proper, orderly and peaceful way, then welcome. At least that is my perception.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; I&rsquo;ll go further - Americans are right to object even to legal immigration because the INS is corrupt, as if the government.  It is a matter of proportions.  If you make the yearly quotas high and select out white Europeans, as we have been doing since 1965, than that is the argument against even legal immigration.<br>
