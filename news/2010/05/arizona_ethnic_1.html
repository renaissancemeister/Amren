<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One of Bill Ayers&rsquo; courses at the University of Illinois includes Pedagogy of the Oppressed as required reading. Author Paulo Freire, a Brazilian Marxist, declared:</p>
<p>&#8220;This, then, is the great humanistic and historical task of the oppressed: to liberate themselves and their oppressors as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>It turns out that the Freire book is required reading in &#8220;Raza Studies&#8221; or Mexican-American courses in the high schools in Tucson, Arizona, where students have been protesting Arizona&rsquo;s new immigration law. Other required books are Occupied America by Rodolfo Acu√±a, a professor emeritus of Chicano studies at California State University in Northridge (CSUN), and Prison Notebooks by Antonio Gramsci, the Italian Communist.</p>
<p>Occupied America, the fifth edition, {snip} refers to white people as &#8220;gringos&#8221; and actually includes a quotation on page 323 from Jose Angel Gutierrez of the Mexican American Youth Organization (MAYO), who was angry over the cancellation of a government program. He declared:</p>
<p>&#8220;We are fed up. We are going to move to do away with the injustice to the Chicano and if the &#8216;gringo&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t get out of our way, we will stampede over him.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Arizona citizens upset about this kind of material said that they initiated an investigation into the problem back in 2007 and found it difficult to get access to the books. One activist said the concern began when parents came to be aware of violence in the schools directed against white and black children. &#8220;This investigation was undertaken to find the roots of this hate,&#8221; she told me. Another person, in turn, &#8220;told me the books in their Mexican-American classes are kept under &#8216;lock and key&rsquo; and the kids can&rsquo;t even take them home. She said she asked to see them but they were very secretive about them and she was prohibited.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} Eventually, a list of books was produced, and a controversy ensued.</p>
<p>The footnotes for Pedagogy of the Oppressed tell us a lot about the nature of the book. Sources include Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, Mao, Herbert Marcuse, and Vladimir Lenin.</p>
<p>The American Educational Research Association (AERA), which Bill Ayers serves as a vice-president, includes a &#8220;Paulo Freire Special Interest Group&#8221; in his honor. {snip}</p>
<p>More open than even Bill Ayers about the mission, Paula Allman wrote Critical Education Against Global Capitalism, incorporating the ideas of Marx, Freire and Antonio Gramsci, the Italian communist who emphasized the subversion of Western cultural institutions such as the educational system.  Allman is in the School of Continuing Education at the University of Nottingham, England. The foreword to her book is by UCLA Professor Peter McLaren, one of those on Bill Ayers&rsquo; own &#8220;blog roll&#8221; of favorite websites, and an open advocate of &#8220;Revolution as education,&#8221; the subtitle of one of his books.  Allman, he wrote, was &#8220;part of a bold new group of Marxist educationalists in Britain .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>The &#8220;Oppressed&#8221; in America</b></p>
<p>In the hands of a skillful &#8220;educator,&#8221; and in the context of the reading of Pedagogy of the Oppressed and Occupied America, the apparent aim is to convince the Mexican-American youth that they are the victims of the &#8220;oppressors&#8221;  &mdash;  white society. Occupied America opens with a map of &#8220;The Mexican Republic, 1821,&#8221; showing Mexico in control of the Southwest United States. The subtitle of Occupied America, &#8220;A History of Chicanos,&#8221; sets the tone. Freire promises them &#8220;liberation&#8221; from the gringos.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a lengthy analysis, Stern [Sol Stern of the Manhattan Institute] notes that Pedagogy of the Oppressed &#8220;has achieved near-iconic status in America&rsquo;s teacher-training programs&#8221; and that one study found that it was &#8220;one of the most frequently assigned texts&#8221; in the curricula of 16 schools of education  &mdash;  14 of them among the top-ranked institutions in the country. &#8220;These course assignments are undoubtedly part of the reason that, according to the publisher, almost 1 million copies have sold, a remarkable number for a book in the education field,&#8221; he noted.<br>

		<p>Professors like this (Professor Soto, PHD, University of Arizona) who used her commencement address to slam AB 1070 (she was booed)are why we should not  have ethnic studies.</p>
<p>Here are here qualifications.<br>
&#8220;Sandra K. Soto is Director of Graduate Studies, Co-coordinator of the Chicana/Latina Studies Concentration, and affiliate faculty of English, Mexican American Studies, and Latin American Studies. She holds a PhD in English from the University of Texas at Austin (with a focus in Ethnic and Third World Literature). Her interdisciplinary research agenda draws on Chicana/o and Latina/o literary and cultural studies, queer theory, and gender studies to offer innovative approaches to the overdetermined terrain of social relations, cultural representation, and knowledge production. Her book Reading Chican@ Like a Queer: The De-Mastery of Desire (University of Texas Press, 2010), replaces the race-based oppositional paradigm of Chicano literary studies with a less didactic, more flexible, framework geared for a queer analysis of the discursive relationship between racialization and sexuality. She is currently working on her second book tentatively titled Feeling Greater Mexico, which pursues unlikely connections between critical transnational studies and U.S. ethnic studies and focuses on the Mexican photographer Graciela Iturbide. Her teaching interests include Chicana/o and Latina/o literary and cultural studies, feminist theories, transnational feminisms, critical race studies, US Third World Feminism, and queer theory.&#8221;</p>
<p>Who wants their kids indoctrinated with &#8220;experts&#8221; like these?  At least she is in higher education, but that kind of tripe is taught as social theory in public schools too.</p>

		<p>The truth is that Americans - both of Hispanic and European origin - fought at the Alamo, died at the Alamo, and women and children were slaughtered by raiding Mexican army units. The slaughter at the Alamo was the last straw and Americans - both Hispanic and European in origin - fought off the Mexicans and finally signed the treaty of Guadalupe in which Americans PAID Mexico for the territory. This was not simply hostile seizure. The Mexicans agreed to take money for the land. They did NOT have to do so. In truth the lands were NOT occupied by Mexicans as the stories are told in school, most of the settlers were European (that&rsquo;s right not WHITE, EUROPEAN, now stop letting them discriminate against us by calling us white) Americans and some Hispanic Americans. The frontier was NOT settled by Mexico. </p>
<p>Their cries of &#8220;we didn&rsquo;t move over the border the border moved over us&#8221; well if they want to be so patriotic to MEXICO what the heck are they doing HERE in AMERICA? GO BACK!</p>

		<p>Jose Angel Gutierrez, whom Mr. Taylor debated brilliantly and was then threatened for his trouble, said in the above article, that if white people(he said Gringo, but meant white people) don&rsquo;t get out of the way, we will stampede over him. You&rsquo;ve got to love this guy, if nothing else, he&rsquo;s intelligent enough to know that he can get away with this stuff. HATE CRIME!! HATE CRIME!!</p>
<p>Well, at least this comment shows a higher degree of intellectual style, for Gutierrez at least,compared to one of his other outrageous comments, if the worst comes to worst, we will have to kill the gringo( translation  &mdash;  whites)</p>
<p>Compared to the things whites are routinely and falsely accused of in the Main Stream Media, this stuff,that IS true,is never reported,or made a big deal of.</p>

<p>If the education system is subverted, does that mean all the &#8216;communists&rsquo; there will be looking for a new job? Liberals certainly have it both ways. Bravely &#8216;fighting the system against all odds&rsquo;, while an educator (appearing here on AmRen yesteryday) offering an opposing view, is forced to publish his work under a pseudonym for fear of job loss.</p>

<p>And of course very few if any white kids ever take these classes and see the books. So only those in the classes know what the contents are? This all seems so strange. It is a PUBLIC school.</p>

<p>This encouraging of hate and violence could very well be the subject of major law suits. The school districts are helping to establish a climate of hate that is leading to physical attacks on white and black students!!</p>

		<p>The on-going problem of African Americans using the history slave mentality to escuse theior failures to keep up with other ASmericans erconomically can be fought on sevearl fronts.  One is obviously constant publicity about their failures to achieve as well as others in the USA.  One is to publicise constantly te failurse of the black states in Africa and then to advise the African Americans how lucky they are to be living in the USA.  This needs to be constantly broadcast to them, and that they should go on holiday there to Africa to see for themselves.  I lived there for 23 years and so know.</p>

		<p>As far as I can tell the American Southwest was origionally settled by non-Hispanic Native Americans. If is much later that one sees the advent of Spanish-speaking expansionists from the south (Mexico).  Does anyone know if this vast territory was legally purchased from the non-Hispanic Native Americans by the Spanish-speaking expanionists from the south (Mexico)?  Moreover, there are any number of sizeable Native American reservations in the American Southwest today. Does Mexico allow reservations for it&rsquo;s surviving non-Hispanic indigenous population today?</p>

__   __   __   __   __ </p>
<p>No, it was NOT.  No more so than the Spanish (then later Mexicans)  purchased ANY of their territories from the Indians. Theyt just TOOK what they wanted.  After all, Spain had been awarded all of this territory by the Pope (in the Treaty of Tordesillas).  The Indians were just occupying the land, but the Spanish considered that they had legal title; and the Mexicans in turn inherited that title. The Indian occupants had no say about it.</p>
<p>In fact, the Indians in the Southwest repeatedly rose against them and threw the Spanish (then later Mexicans) out.  The Indians had no wish to be considered &#8220;Hispanics&#8221;, nor to speak the Spanish language, be forced to practice their religion, be governed by Spanish or Mexican law, or see the Mexican flag flying over them.  They were never governed by consent.</p>
<p>To the Navajos, Hopis, etc., Mexico was an  agressive, expansionistic foreign country.  In truth, so was the USA, but the Americans treated them better than the Mexicans ever did. </p>
<p>Some of those tribes are wealthy and self-governing today. That cannot be said of ANY Indian tribes in Mexico, who are invariably at the bottom of the heap.</p>

		<p>  History can&rsquo;t be sugar coated. Basically, the Spanish stole the Southwest from the Native Americans. Next, the Mexicans took it from the Spanish, and finally North Americans took it from the Mexicans. We paid for it, but the Mexicans had to sell. Only whites developed the Southwest into a First World Country.</p>

<p>They know that they both outnumber blacks and have a higher average IQ.  Blacks are a non-issue, and may or may not be used temporarily against whites by mestizos before they are discarded, we&rsquo;ll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>@ 18) There are plenty of natives left in Mexico, and they&rsquo;re looked down on by mestizos with the same level of disdain and/or pity most whites and asians look down on blacks with.  No idea about the reservations bit though.<br>

<p>The Navajo and other Amerindians in Arizona generally don&rsquo;t get along well with the Mexicans. The Tohono O&rsquo;odham reservation in particular, which abuts the border, has its own border patrol to catch illegal aliens.</p>

		<p>Too bad most Americans are too ignorant to see through the &#8216;Atzlan&rsquo; deception. <br>
As #18 comments correctly the aboriginal settlers of the American Southwest are those native groups still resident today. These were absorbed into Spain&rsquo;s empire from the mid-16th Century to 1821. Very few Mestizos would live north of the Rio Grande because the native groups were quite warlike-Apache, Commanche, etc. Only California had a sizeable Spanish/Mestizo population prior to the Mexican War. The lack of settlers lead to the invitation to White Americans to establish settlements. <br>
One fact is that Mexico only held this territory from 1821-1848-losing much of Texas by 1836. So only a little over 27 years. Prior to 1821 the land was part of the Spanish empier. Before the mid-16th Century it was only occupied by Red Indians. </p>
<p>Toltecs, Mixtects, Mayans, Aztecs, Tlascallans, etc. NEVER had any territory that far north, so this &#8216;disputed&rsquo; part of the United States belongs to Mestizos as much as Ireland belongs to Nigerians. </p>

		<p>&#8220;what I find rather perplexing, is how these racist Hispremacists always use whites as their common enemy, yet it&rsquo;s BLACKS who are killing them and robbing them&#8221;.</p>
<p>There was an article about Hawaii and another poster asked the same thing. He noted that Japan attacked Hawaii, they were particularly brutal during WWII, they immigrated to Hawaii and now they hold most of the political power there, and they have the most money in Hawaii, and yet everyone hates white folks. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the same thing with blacks.  They whine about white racism and how they glee when &#8220;whites become a minority&#8221; yet they don&rsquo;t realize it&rsquo;s the hispanics displacing them and when there is no longer a white-majority (taxpayer) base, there goes their goodies and first-world country they&rsquo;ve been leeching off of for the past 50 years.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Junipero Serra was a Spanish Franciscan Friar who forced American Indians to learn and speak Spanish exclusively or else face the death penalty.&#8221; &hellip; QD</p>
<p><br>
True.  Just take San Diego for example, a city Mexicans consider rightfully their own.  </p>
<p> In 1769   &mdash;    the Mission of San Diego, the first Spanish foothold in California, was founded by Junipero Serra.  (actually an Italian from Naples, btw, not Spanish, as the King of Spain, Chas. III,  was also King of Naples).   (This was merely 7 years before the English colonies on the E. coast declared independence.)     <br>
It was several times attacked by Indians and burned down.<br>
 <br>
1777 - The first major group of non-soldier settlers arrives. </p>
<p>By 1790, more than 200 soldiers, civilians and children will live at the Presidio. </p>
<p>By 1797, the mission had the largest native population in Upper California, with over 1,400 living in and around the mission.</p>
<p>1821 - After an 11-year war, Mexico wins independence from Spain and San Diego comes under Mexican rule.</p>
<p>1826 - Mexican soldiers skirmish with Indians, 28  killed..  The survivors withdrew. <br>
 <br>
1835 - The Mexican military and last residents abandon the Presidio. </p>
<p>1838 - San Diego&rsquo;s pueblo status is  revoked because of a decrease in population. For the next 10 years, San Diego  area is governed as part of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>1847 - San Diego was destination of the 2,000-mile march of the Mormon Battalion, members of whom established a brickyard and built the first courthouse.</p>
<p>1848   &mdash;   Calif. becomes US territory.</p>
<p>1850 - The 1850 U.S. Census sets non-Indian population of San Diego at 650.</p>
<p>1867 -  A  Connecticut Yankee, Alonzo Horton,  arrives from San Francisco. He acquires 800 acres of land  for $265.  and lays out what is  the present city of San Diego. .<br>
1870 - City of San Diego population reaches 2,300. </p>
<p>1889 - the first city charter was adopted in 1889.</p>
<p>Thus, even the city of San Diego was founded  and developed by Americans!    Under  Mexican rule, after 14 years, it had been abandoned.</p>

		<p>Oppressed? What about the fact that so many Latinos live on Welfare, at the expense of the White population. And what about Affirmative Action?</p>

		<p>Bill Ayers?</p>
<p>Is this the same Ayers who used to be a dangerous anti-American fanatic and a terrorist? The same Ayers who actually planted bombs&hellip; and who is actually an old buddy of Barack Obama, even to this day?</p>
<p>They let that kind of guy teach, at the Univsersity of Illinois?</p>
