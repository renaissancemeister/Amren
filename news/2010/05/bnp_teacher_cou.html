			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), May 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A BNP activist described immigrants as &#8216;savage animals&rsquo; and &#8216;filth&rsquo; in an online forum while working as a technology teacher, a disciplinary panel heard today.</p>
<p>Adam Walker, who also claimed that parts of Britain are a &#8216;dumping ground&rsquo; for the Third World, is the first teacher to appear before the General Teaching Council accused of racial intolerance.</p>
<p>The 40-year-old used a school laptop to access the website on which he allegedly also made derogatory remarks online about asylum seekers, immigrants and gay people.</p>
<p>Mr Walker, who resigned from Houghton Kepier Sports College in Houghton-le-Spring, near Sunderland, admits posting racist comments about Muslims.</p>
<p>He left the school three years ago but the GTC is still to give its verdict over whether he should be struck off due to lengthy delays in the proceedings after the BNP member attempted to have the case thrown out.</p>
<p>His legal team argued that because his comments were not linked to his work, Mr Walker, from Spennymoor, County Durham, should not face professional misconduct charges.</p>
<p>Opening the case against the former soldier, GTC presenting officer Bradley Albuery alleged that postings made by the teacher demonstrated views suggestive of both racial and religious intolerance.</p>
<p>Mr Albuery said Mr Walker used the pseudonym Corporal Fox to make the postings to a forum on Teessideonline, which addressed the popularity of the BNP, during February and March 2007.</p>
<p>In one posting, Mr Walker claimed the BNP had risen in popularity because &#8216;they are the only party who are making a stand and are prepared to protect the rights of citizens against the savage animals New Labour and Bliar (sic) are filling our communities with&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In another posting on the same day, Mr Walker wrote: &#8216;By following recent media coverage of illegal animals and how they are allowed to stay here despite committing heinous crimes, I am, to say the very least, disgusted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another posting claimed that some immigrants hated people who were white and had western values.</p>
<p>It is alleged that the views expressed in the postings constitute unacceptable professional conduct.</p>
<p>Mr Albuery added: &#8216;This case is not about the BNP or whether teachers should be members of that lawful party.</p>
<p>&#8216;This case is about the actions and behaviour of a registered teacher, using a school property on school premises in school time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Walker is alleged to have spent more than eight hours using the laptop for purposes not connected to his school duties.</p>
<p>The teacher, who worked at Houghton Kepier for more than six years, resigned after his headteacher asked IT staff to investigate his use of the internet.</p>
<p>The teacher&rsquo;s trade union representative, Patrick Harrington, told the three-member disciplinary panel that Mr Walker accepted he was wrong to use a computer to access Teessideonline during school time.</p>
<p>But Mr Harrington submitted that none of the terms used by Mr Walker, who is now working as a campaigns coordinator for the BNP MEP Andrew Brons, had demonstrated racial or religious intolerance.</p>
<p>&#8216;To us, the subject matter of what he was doing is not relevant,&rsquo; Mr Harrington said.</p>
<p>&#8216;Immigrant is not a racial term. Immigrant is simply a description of people moving to one country from another country  &mdash;  immigrants comprise of all different races.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a statement read to the hearing, Mr Walker stressed that he had not communicated his political thoughts and beliefs to staff or pupils at Houghton Kepier.</p>
<p>His statement read: &#8216;I have always sought to bring out the best in my pupils.</p>
<p>&#8216;I have certainly never discriminated against an individual on grounds of race, faith or sexuality. Part of why I became a teacher is to help people overcome social disadvantage and reach their full potential.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Walker, who lived in Germany, Cyprus, Egypt and Israel while serving in the armed forces, said many teachers used the internet for many different reasons.</p>
<p>&#8216;I do not deny that I used my computer to access the internet,&rsquo; he stated. &#8216;With the value of hindsight I now regret making any personal use of the internet during lesson time. I would like to apologise for it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Walker  &mdash;  who previously lived and worked as a teacher in Japan and married a Japanese woman  &mdash;  said his travels had led him to value the beauty and diversity of different cultures.</p>
<p>Commenting on the content of his postings, Mr Walker said he had been influenced by media coverage of a female PC shot dead by two illegal immigrants and the murder of British hostage Ken Bigley in Iraq.</p>
<p>&#8216;Looking back now I feel that I was unduly influenced by the hostile climate the media created,&rsquo; Mr Walker explained. &#8216;This led me to express intemperate views which lacked complexity and balance.</p>
<p>&#8216;I should have taken more time to think about the possible offence my words might have caused and I think I could have expressed myself more carefully and positively.</p>
<p>&#8216;I have never condemned all immigrants or asylum seekers. My comments relate to those I perceive as coming to our country and committing criminal offences or otherwise behaving badly.</p>
<p>&#8216;In many cases, I cut and pasted views from a variety of sources in order to provoke debate and these were not attributed.</p>
<p>&#8216;Had I been posting under my own name, I would have taken more case to distinguish between my own views and the views of others I was reposting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The hearing is expected to run for three days.<br>

While I sympathize with Walker, his defense is going to virtually impossible, as he used State issued computers to post his socio-political worldviews. Now if it can be shown that the posting of opinions based on socio-political doctrines using same State owned laptops that are deemed &#8220;acceptable&#8221; by the British State edjukashun bureaucracy, then perhaps a case can be made.</p>

		<p>How did they, the authorities discovered that Mr. Walker had been making postings under a different name?  Was it due to taking away his computer owned by the school?  It appears to be violation of freedom of speech which I suppose the British do not believe in since they still have a &#8220;Queen&#8221;.  This case sounds similar to a recent decision issued by a this country&rsquo;s Federal Circuit Court except that court issued a favorable ruling toward the defendants based on the First Amendment.  Thank Goodness! </p>

		<p>2-Anonymous:  The Queen has no say so over speech.  Britain has no freedom of speech because they have no written constitution enshrining such a right.  Their constitution, a truly &#8220;living document&#8221;, is merely a set of traditions and most importantly case law.<br>

Not even close to being the real reason there is such tyranny going on in Britain.  The truth is, Britain started turning into an anti-white fascist state the very second they allowed their guns to be confiscated.</p>
<p>A grim warning to us in the United States.</p>

		<p>Accusing someone of &#8220;posting racist comments about Muslims&#8221; makes as much logical sense as accusing someone of &#8220;posting racist comments about atheists.&#8221;  The aim of implying that it is &#8220;racist&#8221; to criticize Muslims is, of course, to make everyone afraid to do it.<br>

		<p>I read an article a few weeks ago which compared the new &#8220;far-right&#8221; with the hippie movement of the 60s:</p>
<p>They are getting fight and the state does much to prevent the new views but at least the movement will win because just too many feel the same way, in the movements and in the society.<br>
So this only shows that Mr. Taylor and his work are successful if even teachers now accept this right views.</p>

		<p>He blamed the media?!? Why, because the media already shows too much non-white/immigrant on white/Brit crime? A bit of a sell out if you ask me, but at least he didn&rsquo;t apologize for supporting and being a member of an upcoming mainstream party that wants to repatriate (voluntarily) all non-whites and assimilate the rest.</p>
