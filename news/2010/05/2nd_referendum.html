			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ginger Rough, Arizona Republic (Phoenix), May. 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The second of two referendum efforts challenging Arizona&rsquo;s tough new immigration law has been scrapped by its organizers.</p>
<p>A group called One Arizona originally filed petitions with the Secretary of State&rsquo;s Office on April 28, but decided over the weekend to disband the effort, said Chairman Andrew Chavez, who runs a petition-circulating company.</p>
<p>Chavez said that effort was scuttled after he and his clients determined that the Secretary of State&rsquo;s Office would likely refer the referendum to the 2010 ballot in November, rather than put it before voters in 2012.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When asked if the group had concerns about its ability to collect the needed 76,682 signatures from registered voters, Chavez responded, &#8220;not at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>A second effort to repeal Senate Bill 1070 was abandoned last week.</p>

						<p>
							<i>Martha R Gore, Washington Examiner, May 11, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Tucson and Pima County voters will not have to make a decision about some of the referendums that were supposed to be on the ballot in 2010 and 2012. Two of them were dropped on May 10, 2010.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a poll taken among Arizona residents on May 4, 2010, 52% of the public favored the law, 39% opposed it and 9 percent were unsure. {snip}</p>
<p>Other challenges to SB 1070 include that of the National Coalition of Latino Clergy and Christian Leaders, one on behalf of Tucson Officer Martin Escobar and Phoenix Officer David Salgado.. Joining in suits are the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona, the Mexican Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the National Immigration Law Center.<br>

<p>Well, Comrade Chairman Chavez is clearly maneuvering here for what he thinks will be better future political rivers, when compared to the currently tumultuous socioeconomic oceans we now find ourselves adrift upon!</p>
<p>Thanks, I would guess somehow, to his political &ldquo;savior&rdquo; and countercultural dominatrix of the &ldquo;heavens,&rdquo; General Secretary BO. In some respects, this is laughably expected; in others, it is ominously astonishing.  Indeed, we do expect the: nonwhites, hybrids, and Reds to go by their normal rainbow playbooks or other &ldquo;reincarnated&rdquo; Marxist-Leninist  &ldquo;dialectics,&rdquo; which means a predictable freak show demanding tolerance, while also threatening violence and terrorism, if they are not spontaneously acquiesced to by all decent whites. However, to have them sort of ratchet down their current maudlin derangements and work toward a more demanding future goal, is an unsettlingly unforeseen and adamantly unwelcome development. </p>
<p>In short, it seems these alien invaders and amnesty &ldquo;citizens,&rdquo; may have actually learned from their past mistakes and overreaching ambitions?</p>
<p>If so, God help us all!</p>

		<p>I think those numbers are wrong.  Here in SoCA they&rsquo;ve been quoting 70% of Arizonans are in favor of the law.  I imagine that is more accurate - the folks in Arizona are rather tired of having their people pay with their lives on their own land for these illegal trespassers.</p>

		<p>I suppose One Arizona would insist border jumper signatures should count.They also will insist border jumpers have the right to vote on the ballot referendums.</p>

		<p>I can only imagine how many doors that they may have had slammed in their &#8216;cajas&rsquo;. </p>
<p>I wonder if their sentiments changed after this story came to the fore?</p>

<p>Very little coverage of something that sounds like another senseless kidnapping / murder by these people. I can not see the law abiding citizens tolerating this for much longer without demanding a mass exodus.</p>
<p>Having a pick-up with good suspension could cost you your lives folks.</p>

		<p>I think these people are starting to see the writing on the wall. This law is constitutional and is here to stay and the majority of the voting people of Arizona support it.</p>

<p>Given demographic trends, it is only a matter of time before hispanics form an impenetrable race-based voting bloc that will be 70% hispanic, 30% White and closed borders and Senate Bill 1070 will be but a dim memory never to return.</p>
<p>As Jupiter keeps expounding (and pounding):   White Race Replacement is our biggest issue, not socialized health care, tea parties or 1070  &mdash;  that is merely rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic (sorry for the cliche, but is very early here and it IS entirely apropos).  It is only a matter of time before we become a permanent minority in the country we created, beholden to those who not only do not share our values but despise us.</p>
<p>From OO:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Whether or not [the new hispanic majority] share certain values, such folks hate Whites and will seek payback for historical and present injustices and grievances, real and imagined. </p>
<p>&hellip; Big government will be an agent of anti-White revanchism and oppression: not only socialized medicine as racial revanchism and wealth redistribution, but also hate speech laws, an anarcho-tyranny criminal justice system in which black and hispanic predators who murder and rape and rob and assault Whites are almost invariably coddled, if they&rsquo;re not acquitted by jury nullification, while Whites who tell the truth about crime and other issues are charged with felonies and incarcerated; sweeping racial quotas to impose or try to impose an &#8216;equality of results and conditions&rsquo; in higher education, the workforce, politics, perhaps even jails and prisons&hellip; oppressive taxation to  uplift the black and hispanic underclasses; totalitarian censorship and thought-control&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/29tjvmx</p>
<p>My only quibble with the author of the above is that he includes blacks in the non-White Amerikan NWO and from my own personal experience living in 21st century LA, I believe the only plans hispanics have for blacks is genocide.</p>
<p>This is where we&rsquo;re inevitably headed as Whites are replaced by third world non-Whites.</p>
<p>It will be much safer in Doggerland  &mdash;  which is 100s of feet underwater.</p>
