<h1>Swedish Man Arrested for Plotting Somalia Attack</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Malin Rising, Google News, May 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sweden&rsquo;s security service on Tuesday arrested a man suspected of plotting a terrorist attack in Somalia, the latest in a string of Somali-linked terror cases in Scandinavia.</p>
<p>The man is a Swedish citizen and was detained in the Goteborg area in western Sweden, according to a brief statement from the security service, known as SAPO.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since the 1990s, more than 50,000 Somalis have fled to Sweden, Denmark and Norway from the war in their homeland.</p>
<p>Police have expressed concerns about the radicalization of young men in Somali immigrant communities and say about 20 people have left Sweden to join Islamists waging an insurgency against Somalia&rsquo;s government.</p>

		<p>And oddly enough, there&rsquo;s no accompanying photo of this &#8220;Swedish man.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seems that the Swedish media dance to the same tune as the amerikan media.  How odd.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Police have expressed concerns about the radicalization of young men in Somali immigrant communities and say about 20 people have left Sweden to join Islamists waging an insurgency against Somalia&rsquo;s government.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Note to Sweden: if you didn&rsquo;t have any &#8220;Somali immigrant communities,&#8221; you wouldn&rsquo;t have any Somali radicalism.<br/>

		<p>The war in Somalia has been going on for well over 20 years, and present instability could perpetuate for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>This makes Somalia, with it high birthrates, an incubator for refugees. Taking 50,000 into Scandinavia &#8216;for their safety&rsquo; seems a futile gesture, as for each refugee given asylum, another one or two is born to take his place in the restive Somali homeland.</p>
<p>Will any Swede be brave enough to call into question the policy which allowed up to 50,000 East African tribesmen into the Nordic homelands?<br/>

		<p>This &#8220;Swede&#8221; isn&rsquo;t a Swede.  And that &#8220;Dutchboy&#8221; that survived that airliner crash last week wasn&rsquo;t Dutch.  Anyone besides me notice that?</p>
<p>The EU is making a mockery out of European ethnicity. I mean, they are working to destroy it.  They must be stopped.</p>

<p>Right, after 9/11 the media told us that Germans, Frenchmen, Englishmen, Danes had all been caught in Afghan. Well, not really Germans, Frenchmen, Englishmen, etc. Muslims that maybe HAVE a passport from Germany, France, England, but DO NOT practice the culture, language, race, religion of that nationality as German, Frenchman, Englishman is generally, commonly, and usually understood.</p>

		<p>Its time for Sweden to have some sense kicked into them. Denmark has reacted to their immgrant problems, why can&rsquo;t their northern neighbors do the same?</p>

<p>The black muslim Somalis didn&rsquo;t &#8220;flee&#8221; to those countries, they premeditatedly INVADED those countries with their Saudi masters instructing them to do so in order to begin the conversion to muslim states.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s fine with me, just make sure they don&rsquo;t return to Sweden.  Keep Somalian battles on Somalian turf, likewise allow Nordic countries to remain intrinsically Nordic.  Everything has its place.</p>

		<p>Only ten years ago, Sweden was the &#8220;Swedish Model&#8221; e.g. good for everything. But since they let Africans in, we only hear about riots in Sweden.<br/>

		<p>To poster #3.  Yes, I noticed that too.  The &#8220;Dutch&#8221; boy looked a bit African to me.  Fear not!  Race is but a social construct!  In 100 years, Europe will be 50-80% non-white and a multicultural paradise of social justice and propsperity for all!</p>

		<p>These pathetic excuse for journalists know exactly what they&rsquo;re doing when they right these misleading headlines. </p>
<p>I can only imagine many more people read the headlines of most articles than read the articles in totality, so they get that much more anti-White (Whites-are-often-criminals-too,-so-we&rsquo;re-all-the-same message) propaganda when just skimming the news, and if anybody asks, well (the logic goes) only so many words fit in a headline; plus, technically (in a political sense) it&rsquo;s true, and only &#8220;racists&#8221; would argue against this kind of labeling anyway.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an ingenious system for control.</p>
