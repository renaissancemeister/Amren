<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Children who experience discrimination are more susceptible to becoming depressed, new studies suggest.</p>
<p>The study, conducted by Lee M. Pachter, DO, co-author of the study and professor of pediatrics at Drexel University College of Medicine and St. Christopher&rsquo;s Hospital for Children in Philadelphia, is based on the realization that racism is an added and extremely potent psychosocial stressor in minority children. His research took the lead in trying to find more concrete affects discrimination has on a child&rsquo;s self-esteem and overall mental health.</p>
<p>During this study, 277 minorities between the ages of 9 and 18 were provided a 23-item questionnaire to fill out. The questions dealt with how the subjects saw racism play out in their everyday lives.</p>
<p>The group consisted of the following minorities:</p>
<p>* 104 Latinos who were predominantly Puerto Ricans</p>
<p>* 85 African Americans</p>
<p>* 20 West Indian and Caribbean</p>
<p>* 53 multiracial</p>
<p>* 15 fell within a category listed as other</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Children sited [sic] they had been subjects of having insults hurled at them and being followed by security guards were the  most frequent forms of racism they&rsquo;ve dealt with.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not only do most minority children experience discrimination, but they experience it in multiple contexts: in schools, in the community, with adults and with peers.&#8221; Dr. Pachter said. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The amounts of racism the kids faced were relatively the same for Latinos and African American, and the same for the males and females. Also, the impact the racism had on the children didn&rsquo;t differ in age. All aspects of the group were impacted in a way that negatively affected their self-esteem and in turn children expressed symptoms of depression.</p>

		<p>More aptly put, Whites who experience these things, are the ones who experience depression as has recently been proven. Few blacks ever suffer depression since it is a mental disorder, which requires a certain level of mentality which is lacking in their genes. We all know what is in their jeans, the thing which controls their actions.</p>

<p>The usual Communist/Multi Cult rubbish, that passes for &ldquo;research&rdquo; these days!</p>
<p>This is but another worthless self-report and correlation study, that proves nothing; a &ldquo;relationship&rdquo; might be measured here or it might not, in other words. For example, did this study and its &ldquo;scientifically&rdquo; Socialist/Marxist inquisitors, think to control for media influences or educational indoctrinations that might account for unnaturally inflated responses in their subjects, who falsely have assumed acts of &ldquo;discrimination&rdquo; or &ldquo;racism&rdquo; are being directed against them?</p>
<p>I bet it didn&rsquo;t, since they are attempting the very same here!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

		<p>For four years I attended a majority black high school on the South side of Chicago.  My fellow whites and I feared for our safety on a daily basis. My most vivid memory of high school is listening to a group of black thugs sing &#8220;kill the white people&#8221; while I was forced to stand in the hallway with them waiting for the bell to ring. I was the only white there at the time. I knew better than to complain to administrator or teacher because I knew that if I did I would be beaten as soon as I left campus. I doubt any of these kids have experienced that kind of stress.</p>

		<p>Why weren&rsquo;t the White kids included in this study! Only &#8220;minority&#8221; kids experience racism! Why doesn&rsquo;t this &#8220;professor of pediatrics&#8221; pass out these questionaires to the White kids that have to ride the city school busses in St. Louis or any other city with a high % of blacks. This is just another &#8220;hate Whitey&#8221; study intended to further legitimise their hatreds and assaults on Whitey. And, of course, nobody has the &#8220;rocks&#8221; to ask this heifer where SHE lives and where SHE  sends her kids to school.      </p>

		<p>I am truly, truly sorry for the pain I have helped inflict on these children and I, for one, am willing to suffer the agony of the only sure cure for this pain - separatism.   It&rsquo;s what we owe the children. </p>

		<p>Yes.  As a white man, I feel the stress of racism.  I see the non-whites taking over my country, Europe, Canada, Australia, raping my women, brainwashing (and killing) white children, and I am not allowed to fight back or oppose it.  As a white man, I get blamed for all the faults and failures of blacks and hispanics.  As a white man, women think I am far more evil than Arab men, African men, or Asian men.  Yes, I do see racism.</p>

		<p>The article mentions one of the main causes of minority children feeling racism as being the minority children being followed around by security guards (presumably in stores).  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how it is for the rest of the Amren community, but around here, ALL the security guards anywhere you go in NYC are either black, latino or Asian of one kind or another.  And they do look at other minorities more suspiciously and there are often complaints by minorities of being harassed by other minorities.  How can they call this racism?</p>
<p>For the most part, the black people out here in NYC have next to zero interactions with any whites (save for criminals who might deal with older, white cops).  Blacks out here are more likely to suffer &#8216;racism&rsquo; at the hands of latinos who think they&rsquo;re lazy and bad or Asians who WILL NOT GIVE BLACKS THE TIME OF DAY.  </p>
<p>You notice how Asians were not included in the list.  It may be because of the unspoken secret that the growing and influential Asian crowd is more anti-black and more racist against outsiders than anyone else.  Even the few whites who are left out here, myself included, feel distinctly unwelcome in Asian owned businesses, except for Japanese and Chinese restaurants.  All other businesses might as well say &#8220;No round eyes allowed.&#8221;  Should I be depressed?  </p>

		<p>As a child, my first experience with blacks was 3 adult blacks, 2 males 1 female, sitting at a WMCA, throwing what i would later find out to be &#8220;racial slurs&#8221; at me. I was maybe 12 at the time. </p>
<p>I wonder if Pachter would like to include my experiences in his &#8220;study&#8221; and discuss the &#8220;psychosocial stressors&#8221; caused by black on white racism.</p>

		<p>Just another pseudo-psychological explanation to explain failure. There&rsquo;s a new one every week. They fail though because they are innately incapable of succeeding the modern world. They belong back in their jungles, and should go there before they turn the West into one vast concrete jungle.</p>

		<p>I guess their &#8220;stress&#8221; is the only one that matters as I suppose they are the only people that count. The comment by ex-liberal (#3) is a reminder of what happens when these wonderful stressed out people have you over a barrel. They are very sensitive so don&rsquo;t hurt their feelings, even when they rape, rob or hassle you.</p>

		<p>I can certainly relate.  After 35 years working in the same place, I was the only White male clerk at my post office.  The discrimination inflicted against me was often depressing.</p>

<p>That would be racism, and for all his wonderful study indicting whites and white society, Mr Pachter doesn&rsquo;t want to be known as a racist, at least against non-whites. </p>

		<p>Seriously, should we be making public policy based on the survey answers of a few 9-year olds?</p>
<p>Of course they&rsquo;re all going to say they&rsquo;ve been negatively impacted by racism.  Their public school has done nothing but tell them so for all their time in school.</p>

		<p>To poster #2.  This reliance on &#8216;questionairres&rsquo; to collect &#8216;data&rsquo; is the big liberal thing.  They do it out here where I&rsquo;m at all the time in the schools.</p>
<p>What they don&rsquo;t realize is that this is the worst form of &#8216;data.&rsquo;  Anyone can say anything on one of those and the questions can be leading, if that is the intent of the designers.</p>
<p>Give a questionairre in the morning to someone and then give it to them again in the evening and you will get different results.  The &#8216;sheeple&rsquo; don&rsquo;t usually understand the unreliability of these tools, however.</p>
