<h1>ALIPAC Withdraws From AZ Rallies Over Nazi Groups &amp; Tom Tancredo</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Press Release, Americans for Legal Immigration, May 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>We are sad to announce that ALIPAC is withdrawing support for any rallies in Arizona in June to support SB 1070 due to the discovery of racist group involvement and the actions of former Congressman Tom Tancredo.</p>
<p>We take our commitment to working with and unifying Americans of every race and walk of life behind the effort to secure our borders very seriously. While the illegal alien supporters constantly make false accusations of racism and racist involvement, it is of paramount importance that groups like ours work to keep any racist element out of our events and operations.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, we got behind a rally in Phoenix on June 5 being planned by Dan Smeriglio of Voice of The People USA and retired Congressman Tom Tancredo. On Monday, May 10th, we discovered two painful truths that forced us to take a new direction.</p>
<p>First, June 5 organizer Dan Smeriglio had radically misinformed us about his possession of permits for a location in Phoenix on June 5. He did not have any permits and the illegal alien supporter had permits for the location he had promised us. This happened last year when Smeriglio promised us he had permits for a rally in DC and we had to cancel when we learned he had misinformed us and the illegal alien supporters had the permit for our rally location. Unfortunately we had quite a case of political déjà vu with Mr. Smeriglio misleading organization leaders about permits, while our opposition held the ground he promised us.</p>
<p>The second problem also arose around June 5, when we picked up a release by a smaller illegal alien supporting group called One People&rsquo;s Project. The group was attacking Dan Smeriglio claiming he was working with skin heads and Nazis and attacking ALIPAC for associating with Smeriglio.</p>
<p>The illegal alien and amnesty supporting activists and groups constantly play the race card and twist information in a way that is false and designed to try to throw mud on anyone who stands up and speaks out against illegal immigration.</p>
<p>However, we reviewed the video and computer screen shots that our opposition possesses regarding Dan Smeriglio and discovered that they are correct.</p>
<p>The video and screen shots of Dan Smeriglio&rsquo;s Facebook account indicates that he has willingly been working with members or racist skin head groups long after he knew their identities and politics. In fact, Dan&rsquo;s Facebook profile, which remains his main way of broadcasting a rally for June 5, promoted one of Europe&rsquo;s most popular neo-Nazi rock groups until a few days ago.</p>
<p>TO REVIEW THE VIDEOS, SCREEN SHOTS, AND EVIDENCE SHOWING DAN SMERIGLIO ASSOCIATING WITH SKIN HEADS AND NEO-NAZI ROCK GROUPS CLICK HERE:</p>
<p>http://www.alipac.us/ftopicp-1062223.html#1062223</p>
<p>On Tuesday, May 11, we were invited to join a Tea Party group out of Florida rally in Phoenix on June 12, so we spoke to some leaders and moved to unify on the 12th for a larger rally and to move away from Dan Smeriglio and his skinhead associates. We felt leaving the June 5 event was the best way to protect many of the vulnerable candidates wishing to attend a rally in Phoenix.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our plans to get the skinheads out and away from the Phoenix effort was thwarted, when retired Congressman Tom Tancredo, who had self titled himself as the &#8216;key note speaker&rsquo; at the June 5 event started telling leaders and candidates to come back to the June 5 rally. Tancredo even claimed that ALIPAC&rsquo;s concerns about Dan Smeriglio were false, when he had not reviewed the video and screen shots which we find to be fairly conclusive.</p>
<p>We must point out here that Tom Tancredo had nothing to do with helping pass SB 1070 or circulate it to other states to our knowledge although the three largest national groups fighting illegal immigration have.</p>
<p>Some fine folks in Arizona took action at the end of last week and assured us that Dan Smeriglio&rsquo;s involvement was being completely removed from the June 5 rally and that we would have no more difficulties from Tom Tancredo.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we found out yesterday that Dan Smeriglio is still involved with the Facebook effort to support the June 5 event, even though the neo-Nazi rock group and friends and their comments have been sanitized from his Facebook pages. We also found out that Tom Tancredo is continuing to try and persuade leaders to abandon the June 12 event for the 5th event.</p>
<p>ALIPAC will not work with any group or event that is working with or supportive of neo-Nazis or anyone working with them. We do not feel comfortable asking our national network to travel into Arizona at great expense to attend an event that Tom Tancredo is attempting to undermine.</p>
<p>We have spent a great deal of time, effort, and energy trying to get these events into place for the people of Arizona and America. We have worked diligently behind the scenes to try to resolve this situation with the knowledge that our political opposition does have strong evidence of neo-Nazi supporters being involved with the event still going forward on the 5th.</p>
<p>We feel it is completely unacceptable that Dan Smeriglio and Tom Tancredo or anyone else would put the brave activists, lawmakers, candidates, and citizens of Arizona at risk by proceeding with an event that our opponents can use to harm our cause of stopping and reversing illegal immigration.</p>
<p>We are releasing the video and screen shots that the illegal alien supporting groups posses and intend to use against the rallies. We have documented their findings and the screen shots are our copies.</p>
<p>We apologize to all of you who were excited about going to events in Arizona and already making travel plans to support SB 1070 and AZ.</p>
<p>ALIPAC will not be attending or promoting any rallies in June in Arizona and we advise anyone consider attending any event to review the information showing white nationalist influence involving the core organizers.</p>
<p>We will have no future dealings with Dan Smeriglio or retired Congressman Tom Tancredo due to the neo-Nazi connections and this disaster they have cooked up in Arizona that puts our issue at risk. Our friends in the Tea Party groups still plan to carry on with a much smaller event on June 12 in Phoenix.</p>
<p>The donations we received over the last few days will be used to help spread SB 1070 to other states. Any ALIPAC supporter that would prefer a refund please contact WilliamG@alipac.us</p>

		<p>Groups like ALIPAC are essentially useless to our cause anyway. Like Lou Dobbs and others who moan only about the legality of the situation, screeching about their &#8220;nation of laws&#8221; and similar toothless nonsense, these people/groups miss the real dangers and concerns over this massive foreign invasion completely! One stroke of the Federal/Executive pen could make them all &#8220;legal&#8221; in an instant - would that solve even a single real issue or problem these invaders bring into our midst? </p>
<p>These immigration-clowns that are pathologically terrified of being called &#8220;racists&#8221; are really only scarcely better than the open-borders types themselves. </p>

&ldquo;Neo-Nazis&rdquo; = Unashamedly White.</p>
<p>&#8220;This wasn&rsquo;t an SPLC press release by any chance, was it?</p>
<p>ProWhite groups will get exactly nowhere as long as they live in fear of being called &ldquo;Nazis.&rdquo; Oh, wait  &mdash;  this &ldquo;ALIPAC&rdquo; bunch isn&rsquo;t proWhite, is it? That&rsquo;d be Racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>As long as white race realists allow Nazis to represent them, by not making it clear that Nazism is not the goal of white race realists through clear dissociation, groups like the SPLC will apply the label when Nazis show up at white cause rallies, pretending to represent white interests.</p>
<p>Remember, Hitler turned on Germans in the end.  Hitler destroyed Germany and the reputation of the Nordic archtype because he called on them to dominate the world and kill everyone Hitler considered inferior or the cause of his and &#8220;his people&rsquo;s&#8221; problems, failing to take responsibility and in the end, coping out with a cowardly suicide.  He even had to take a woman along with him then, because of his cowardess.</p>
<p>I have no time for Nazis who still as their core argument, blame the ever shrinking world population of Jews as a group to fear because they are &#8220;taking over&#8221; the world.  (So cleverly, no one can see them doing it.  Or maybe the Arabs and Chinese are actually, the &#8220;Jews&#8221;)?</p>
<p>Intelligent whites will not follow Nazis, we need a better way than to repeat the past and hope for better results this time.  Nazis today are irrational dark hero worshippers, with no real intellect of their own.  Nazis are the reason why whites have such a difficult time gaining traction where parity of rights is concerned.</p>
<p>To succeed, we need to do some work untangling our own nonsense.  Then perhaps we will succeed at making a sound case for white, ethnic rights.</p>

		<p>One of the things that is happening as immigration enforcement groups work so hard to not appear &#8220;racist&#8221; is they are learning that there is essentially no difference between legal and illegal aliens.  They are both criminals here to steal welfare and sell drugs.  The difference is, the illegals cannot meet the pathetic minimum standards to come in legally in our virtually unlimited legal immigration open borders system.  They are also getting a crash course in the fact that it is the non-whites who are actually racist&hellip;.and rabidly so.</p>
<p>This is an important change in perspective that needs to become widespread.  The cure for anti-racist white guilt is the realization these other racists are not only unabashedly racist and filled with incredible and irrational hatred of whites but that they act on it.  Anti-racism relies on projection of ones values and idealization of the other race.  Burst the bubble and&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Lou Dobbs was the most outspoken anti-immigrant man in the media until he just recently quit (over his refusal to stop airing &#8216;birther&rsquo; stories btw). Who the hell have you been listening to?</p>
<p>Also, why is Tom Tancredo so scary? Could it be that he&rsquo;s the perfect example of a decent, law-abiding LEGAL immigrant to the U.S.? (or his parents anyway) Darn those law-abiding people who believe in freedom&hellip;and the American way of life  /sarcasm</p>

		<p>I agree with 3-HH.  If ALIPAC wants to show and push their agenda, then they need to be involved with this debate.  By choosing to stand aside, their default position is to help those supporting the illegal aliens.  Should the illegals win, ALIPAC loses; should Arizona and America win, ALIPAC becomes inconsequential. I question how ALIPAC can justify their existence by bailing out of the current immigration debate.</p>

		<p>Neo-nazis are NOT allies.  And they should NOT be.  Skin heads are NOT allies, and they should NOT be.  They are a pathetic bunch of losers counting small numbers and can only bring bad light to any cause they are allowed to participate in.  They seek desperately, even through deceit, to attach themselves to any large, legitimate cause or organization to give themselves credence far in excess of their sickly small numbers.  Moreover, we ARE a nation of LAWS.  To sneer at the rule of just law, is to sneer at the American ideal which has sustained us and made us a great nation.  But then, neo nazis and skinheads have no intention of standing up for America.  They just hate anybody not white.  That&rsquo;s their platform.  Period.  They hate God, they hate the rule of law, they hate the American economic and political model (not those perverted by Obama but those established by the Founders) and wish to merely replace all those with National Socialism.  Ask them.  Read their sites.  National Socialism is nothing more than communism without trying to pretend to be democratic on the face of it.  These worms try to get recognition by attaching themselves to legitimate causes like leeches or parasites.  ALIPAC did the right thing.  And so should all other legitimate causes and organizations.  </p>

		<p>The left never has to worry about <i>their</i> ties and connections.  You can attend a church for 20 years whose preacher gave a lifetime achievement award to Louis Farrakhan, a virulently anti-white, anti-Jewish nut case who gets messages from flying saucers, and still get elected President.  You can be friendly with a domestic terrorist who doesn&rsquo;t regret having planted bombs in his youth and still get elected President.  Pro-illegal immigration groups have no trouble cozying up to extremist racial groups like MEChA.  Or Marxists like this guy: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ya5QoT306k" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ya5QoT306k</a></p>
<p>But a conservative must be careful never to be a friend of a friend of a skinhead, lest he be cast into the outer darkness.</p>

		<p>If mestizos make up the majority of America, we will simply become a slightly worse Mexico 2.0(we get their degenerates) with pockets that are nice due to high concentrations of whites.  Much like what you see in South America already.  </p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether or not it&rsquo;s &#8220;racist&#8221; to say this, because it&rsquo;s true.  So really the only question you should be asking most whites is, &#8220;Do you want to live in Mexico?&#8221;  </p>

		<p>Well, when the inevitable race war happens(unless Jared Taylor becomes president, and I doubt that will happen anytime soon) I&rsquo;d rather have neo-nazis on my side than limp-wristed ALIPAC supporters.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re race deniers and can&rsquo;t see the writing on the wall.  If illegal immigration was 100% white, christian and english speaking I&rsquo;d have zero problem with it.  Instead it&rsquo;s 99.9% spanish speaking and mestizo.  Which wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem if all races were equal in every aspect.  They aren&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>   I won&rsquo;t speak for others, but I would work with the devil himself if it meant putting an end to all the illegals pouring into our country. What ALIPAC doesn&rsquo;t understand, it is far too late in the scheme of things to be so picky about your allies. At least the Neo-Nazis are unashamedly white. Do not think for a moment that things will ever get better without being unpleasant to your enemy. That time has long passed. If ALIPAC doesn&rsquo;t have the guts to get tough, then get out of the way. The ballot box alone isn&rsquo;t going to change things for the better. We must take a page from our enemies. It&rsquo;s easy to see what works for them. Turn it to our advantage. I feel that alot of whites are not comfortable with the thought of getting their hands dirty in order to effect change. There in lies the rub. We are in deep trouble. Far too many are scared to death of being labelled a &#8220;racist&#8221;. That word means nothing to me. If anything, I wear it as a badge of courage.  I admit it, I care only about white people. All others will care for themselves. My first concern is for my own race, period. ALIPAC is one of those groups that wants change, but they don&rsquo;t want to be considered &#8220;racist&#8221;. If all they can do is beg, then they need to step aside. It is time to choose your team and play this out. Win or lose, at least we will have shown up.</p>

		<p>This reads like a school-girl&rsquo;s diary. &#8220;I wanna help but there was this guy, and this other guy lied to me, and there was a band, and I looked at a Facebook page and&hellip;&#8221; The situation couldn&rsquo;t be much more straightforward; there&rsquo;s a law allowing enforcement of another law. Support it or don&rsquo;t.

		<p>  I find these assertions about Mr. Tancredo&rsquo;s character insulting. Tom has been on the front lines fighting for enforcement of our laws for decades.</p>
<p> After reading this press release I find myself questioning ALIPACS motives and wondering who&rsquo;s side they are really working for. Trust me, there will be no shortage of Mexican Nationalists working for the open border groups.  Yet the far right isn&rsquo;t welcome to have their voices heard?  American Nationalists need not attend?</p>
<p> I&rsquo;m sick and tired of Skinheads being thrown under the bus for the sake of political correctness.  I&rsquo;ve seen MANY examples over the last 20 years when it&rsquo;s been skinheads, and skinheads alone who stand up and fight for their communities.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re living in delusion. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be even worse - being replaced by immigrants who are superior to you in every way? Assuming that&rsquo;s what you meant to imply - the problem is mestizo&rsquo;s are not equal to whites. </p>

<p>You&rsquo;re living in delusion. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be even worse - being replaced by immigrants who are superior to you in every way? Assuming that&rsquo;s what you meant to imply - the problem is mestizo&rsquo;s are not equal to whites. Obviously non-white does not equal white.  </p>

		<p>Actually, it&rsquo;s not a racial issue.  It&rsquo;s a BORDER issue.  It&rsquo;s a SOVEREIGNTY issue.</p>
<p>And neo nazis and skinheads are thrown under the bus all the time for the same reason the so called Rev Wright was thrown under the bus.  Too radical, too narrowly focused, an embarrassment, not representative of mainstream middle conservative America, does more harm than good, and is the antithesis of American values.<br/>
That should be simple enough.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Intelligent whites will not follow Nazis, we need a better way than to repeat the past and hope for better results this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>  Honestly, this is a smear campaign to discredit any opposition to the &#8220;open borders&#8221; crowd. Of course, people who want secure borders are not Neo-Nazis. Many of our fathers, uncles, and cousins fought against Nazism in Europe. My uncle was in North Africa and Italy during WWII and he wasn&rsquo;t taking a vacation. Why are we blamed for a few anti-social nuts?  This is deeply insulting. </p>
<p>The controlled media has tried the same tactic against the Tea Party activists. Americans want constitutional fidelity, limited government, fiscal responsibility and controlled legal immigration. Now what does that have to do with Nazism?<br/>

		<p>This is surrendering to the same guilty-by-association techniques that briefly stalled the left during the Second Red Scare-McCarthy era. Folksinger Pete Seeger, for example, was briefly cast out of the mainstream because of his performances-along with other Communist connections-at CPUSA-sponsored concerts. In a few years he was un-blacklisted and it was if the recent unpleasantness had never happened, or certainly not discussed as a negative among the people who really counted. </p>
<p>Given the continuing dominance of Cultural Marxism one can&rsquo;t expect a similar happy ending for those who defend the interests of whites. If you don&rsquo;t want to be complicit in an orgy of self-destruction you have to reject the demand that anyone who just might possibly have some Hitlerite connections with x number of degrees of separation  must necessarily taint <br/>
any event that contests the dominant narrative on Diversity-Muticulti-unrestricted immigration. </p>
<p>Standing on a stage with someone who agrees with you on one issue does not mean that you agree with them on every issue. Employing a band that may have also performed for what may be a <br/>
neo-Nazi group does not necessarily make that employment a &#8220;hate crime&#8221; or the equivalent. Recall that for the Thirties to the present mainstream liberals and leftists have associated with totalitarian communists-not to mention Black and Hispanic racists-and were called to account for it for only a brief time at the height of the Cold War. </p>
<p>This, of course, does not mean that one should welcome or pander to uniform-wearing kooks and other clear admirers of Hitler. But just being a skinhead or some other variety of WN does not automatically mean you deserve exclusion based on loose charges of neo-Nazism. White Pride or some other variety of pro-white ideology does not automatically equate to neo-Nazism. </p>

<p>Nothing!  But you&rsquo;re asking a rational question and trying to be reasonable.  It&rsquo;s a waste of your time because to the Left, that&rsquo;s irrelevant.   Have they ever shown interest in being objective and fair?  They&rsquo;re only interested in getting their way.</p>
<p>Anything that is good for whites or that is even vaguely race-oriented will be equated with nazis.  That&rsquo;s the stick they will use to badger and attack you.   That&rsquo;s their strategy,  and it&rsquo;s simply a fact we have to live with.  Trying to appease the extreme left and assure them that we&rsquo;re not &#8220;racists&#8221;, &#8220;supremecists&#8221;, or  Klansmen will do absolutely no good.  It&rsquo;s futile to convince them that we&rsquo;re not genocidal because they don&rsquo;t WANT to be convinced.  Expecting them to be reasonable, civil, fair,  and to engage in rational discussion is pointless. They will chant and scream &#8220;nazis&#8221; nonetheless.   The spectre of smoking chimneys will always  be held over your heads because that&rsquo;s their ace in the hole. They&rsquo;re not going to give it up!  And, according to &#8216;Godwin&rsquo;s Law&rsquo;, it effectively terminates all further discussion.<br/>

		<p>Its really sad to see so many people slag off skinheads.  I&rsquo;ve known plenty of skins over the past 25 years and the majority are decent, hard working citizens.  Not all skinheads are nazis either.  Most are patriotic and plenty are White Nationalists.</p>

I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s right to judge or repudiate people on the basis of labels. They&rsquo;re only superficial.  Isn&rsquo;t the Left always telling us not to stereotype people?   &mdash;    that we have to judge people as individuals, not as stereotypes?</p>
