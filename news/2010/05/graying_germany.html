<h1><a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,697085,00.html">Graying Germany Contemplates Demographic Time Bomb</a></h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Germany is already facing a demographic nightmare as birth rates fall despite a slew of family-friendly policies. Now, new statistics show that more people are leaving the country than immigrating  &mdash;  adding to concerns about the country&rsquo;s shrinking population.</p>
<p>Germans fretting about the country&rsquo;s looming demographic problems are unlikely to have been cheered by recent news on birth rates and emigration. With its graying population, the country&rsquo;s cradle-to-grave welfare system could become unaffordable due to a dearth of working-age people to keep the system going. And the country seems to be failing to either attract enough immigrants or produce babies fast enough to dispel fears of future demographic disaster.</p>
<p>Only two weeks ago, hopes of a government-created baby boom were dashed by the latest birth rate figures. The Federal Statistics Office revealed that despite heavy investment in maternity and paternity pay and other family-friendly policies, the birth rate was actually declining in Germany, with 651,000 children born in 2009, fully 30,000 less than in 2008.</p>
<p>With an average of just 1.38 children being born to each woman, the birth rate is not high enough to keep the population stable. The aging country will find it hard to secure the tax revenues to support all those pensioners of the future or to maintain economic growth. In fact, demographers expect Germany&rsquo;s population to fall by 17 million from the current 82 million over the next 50 years.</p>
<p><b>Net Emigration Since 2008</b></p>
<p>Now adding to the woes are the latest migration figures which show that more people are actually leaving Germany than choosing to make the country their new home. For a quarter of a century, Germany had been a country of net immigration but in 2008 that trend was reversed. The figures for 2009, while showing a slight improvement, are still worrying. On Wednesday, the Federal Statistics Office released figures showing that 13,000 more people had left Germany in 2009 than had arrived.</p>
<p>In total 734,000 people opted to leave the country last year, while only 721,000 immigrated. Although the immigration total showed an increase of 39,000 over 2008, at the beginning of the decade over 800,000 people were choosing to make Germany their home each year.</p>
<p>Most of those who chose to leave were foreigners returning home, with the prime destinations being Poland (123,000), Romania (44,000) and Turkey (40,000). Of the 155,000 Germans who chose to leave their homeland, most favored the US and Switzerland.</p>
<p>There was a slight dip in emigration, with 4,000 fewer people leaving than in 2008. The global recession is thought to have been a contributing factor here, as prospective emigrants know they will have a tougher time securing jobs abroad. Spain, for example, had long been a popular choice for German emigrants but its high unemployment figures are now acting as a deterrent.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Not Exactly Inviting&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Klaus J. Bade, the chairman of the Expert Advisory Board for Integration and Migration (SVR), argues that Germany has to make itself more attractive to Germans and immigrants alike. He says that many people leaving Germany complain of the &#8220;narrow hierarchies in German companies, the poor chances of getting ahead and the lack of fairness in recognizing performance.&#8221; On the other hand, people in other countries are put off by Germany&rsquo;s reputation for not welcoming foreigners, an image &#8220;that is not exactly inviting,&#8221; Bade told the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper.</p>
<p>Uta Koch of the Hamburg-based relief agency Raphaels Werk, which advises emigrants and returning migrants, says that opting to leave home has little to do with seeking adventure. &#8220;Most people find it difficult to leave Germany,&#8221; she told the Die Welt newspaper. The decision is made out of a fear of unemployment at home, or the hope of better pay and childcare abroad, she explains.</p>
<p>The Green Party migration expert Memet Kilic says that figures show that &#8220;our country is no longer so attractive, particularly to migrants.&#8221; He points to the fact that there are now 10,000 more people leaving Germany for Turkey than coming the other way.</p>
<p>Reiner Klingholz of the Berlin Institute for Population and Development meanwhile told the business daily Handelsblatt that for the economy to make up for the falling birth rates there would need to be &#8220;an additional half a million people immigrating per year until 2050  &mdash;  and that is not likely.&#8221;<br>

		<p>&#8220;Germany is facing a demographic nightmare&#8221;</p>
<p>Germany already faced that nightmare twice in the last century, after loss of life in two world wars.  Germany bounced back on its own both times.</p>
<p>That people are leaving looking for greener pastures comes as no surprise. They will probably just meet other white Westerners in the same predicament.  </p>

		<p>I disagree with the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;The aging country will find it hard to secure the tax revenues to support all those pensioners of the future or to maintain economic growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>I actually view a declining birth rate as a BENEFIT to Germany, as long as they simultaneously keep out immigrants.  The Baby Boomer generation will simply have to make its social sacrifice in old age, and forego the pensions that their prior tax payments may have entitled them to.  Once that generation is hurdled, future generations will be smaller and there will be more jobs to go around, and more land and housing available.  The American preoccupation with &#8220;growth&#8221; is not the only answer.  A smaller population is another answer, as long as the military can protect the country from envious others.</p>
<p>In short, there will be one generation of pain for aging Boomers, who will have to live more ascetically, but after that the benefits will be reaped by German society.  The other path, i.e. welcoming immigrant to prop up the old Boomer pensions, would be a disaster from which Germany would never recover.  Fast forward two more generations, and even more foreigners would be needed to feed such a Ponzi scheme.</p>

		<p>Notice what is getting the blame?  It&rsquo;s the demographics that&rsquo;s blamed whereas the problem is the socialism. Without socialism the country would merely be going through a demographic phase of no consequence whatsoever other than making the country more liveable.  Prices of land, housing, traffic congestion and crime all would decline because of less demand.  Of course, if you are addicted to generous state handouts then you have to bring in folks from outside.  </p>

		<p>I was stationed in Bavaria, near Nuremburg, in the 1980&rsquo;s.  The people I got to know in small towns and farms were healthy minded, basically conservative, with large families.  They were open and friendly to Americans who took the trouble to learn some rudimentary German. They were a joy to be around. Of course, Bavaria is one of the most conservative and traditional German states, although I also think there is a huge difference between city-Germans and rural/small town Germans.  I knew some city Germans as well, mostly from outside of Bavaria (relatives of the ones I knew from Bavaria), and they were different.  Unbelievably leftist, haters of Germany&rsquo;s culture and history, lovers of anything Third World or Communist.  They were soft and effete, politically correct before there was PC. They didn&rsquo;t like children and didn&rsquo;t like traditional marriage.  They had been indoctrinated as school children to despise their own country and Western society. Unfortunately, there are a lot more city Germans than rural/small town Germans.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s the down-home version of Peter Brimelow&rsquo;s &#8220;Hitler&rsquo;s Revenge.&#8221;</p>

Germany,</p>
<p>South Africa is the short-term solution to your demographic problems.</p>
<p>There were about 4,472,100 white people in SA as of July 2009,<br>
many of them living in abject poverty and terror. And almost all of them eager to leave the carnage of SA behind.<br>
  <br>
As Afrikaans speakers, they will learn German faster than<br>
Third Worlders. They&rsquo;re industrious, intelligent and they will be so grateful to germany for facilitating their escape from the coming bloodbath.</p>
<p>Why not save them?</p>

		<p>In those years immediately after the end of WW2, Germany had a worker shortage. Negative unemployment they called it. Needed workers. Brought in workers from Spain and Turkey, etc.</p>
<p>That is no longer the case? Germany now has had a prolonged unemployment rate HIGHER than the U.S.?</p>
<p>West Germany by itself was a model of success. A combined Germany has not been? And those Germans leaving are replaced to some extent by persons who are hardly the like to revive a thriving and prosperous society.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Those policies, unless they&rsquo;re limited to ethnic Germans alone, are only going to do more harm than good, as they will attract more Third Worlders and induce them to have more children   &mdash;   just the same as in France and Sweden.</p>
<p>But under the delusion that everyone must be treated equally, &#8220;a bady is a baby&#8221;, and &#8220;we are all the same&#8221;,  those policies are not going to be limited to Germans alone.  Thus, Germans will end up paying for their own displacement. </p>
<p>Like us, the Germans are terrorized into silent compliance by fear of the  awful word, &#8220;racist&#8221;, and the even more terrible N-word (the four-letter one ending in &#8220;i&#8221;.)</p>

		<p>Given Germany&rsquo;s notoriously stifling political correctness, maybe it is not a bad thing that Germans are voting with their feet. There is the case of that German homeschooling family that got asylum in Tennessee because they couldn&rsquo;t stand Germany&rsquo;s sickeningly PC public school system.</p>
<p>German-Americans, who have a fertility rate of about 1.9, will soon outnumber Germans in Germany, who are at 1.4, because of this. It should be obvious, based on this one simple fact, which country is better to live in!</p>
<p><i>The Green Party migration expert Memet Kilic says that figures show that &ldquo;our country is no longer so attractive, particularly to migrants.&rdquo; He points to the fact that there are now 10,000 more people leaving Germany for Turkey than coming the other way.</i></p>
<p>See? The news isn&rsquo;t all bad. The cost of living in Turkey is much lower, the food is great, and the people are friendly; despite it being an almost homogeneously Muslim country, it is more civilized and prosperous than the rest of the Islamosphere. The Turks are finally understanding this and heading home.</p>

<p>Much better than to let totally unrelated types into the country who are in reality a drag on the economy and whose offsprings will never adapt or pay their fair share of taxes.  France right now is a very good example of this with Britain not far behind.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t see that an increase or decrease of a few million over one or two generations makes a whole lot of difference one way or the other. The problem is, as a previous comment pointed out, that social services are a ponzi scheme. And one is not going to keep that ponzi scheme going by bringing in less productive third worlders. If anything they will only make the situation worse as immigrants leech social services themselves. The solution is to:</p>
<p>1. repatriate unproductive third worlders who are leeching social services</p>
<p>2. make up the difference organically by providing tax breaks to those who have more children. Tax breaks would encourage the highest earners (read &#8220;smartest&#8221;) to have more children since they are most likely to pay the most in taxes</p>
<p>3. start paring back that blamed socialist mess that&rsquo;s causing most of your problems. it&rsquo;s unsustainable.</p>
<p>By the way, this is actually a pretty good plan for EVERY country to follow.</p>

		<p>The article is scaremongering rubbish.<br>
Germany actually has a very high unemployment rate, particularly in the former communist East which is persistant and intractable.So much for a &#8216;shortage&rsquo; of workers.<br>
  The real cause of German unemployment was the deflation of the economy done in the past 20 years to prepare for the Euro currency.That the Euro has proved to be a unworkable disaster is a cruel irony.</p>

<p>Good idea.  HOWEVER&hellip; Given the influence of ethnic and racial self-interest groups, and the great clout which they wield in our government, that will never be allowed to happen.   White South Africans are &#8220;tainted&#8221;, they&rsquo;re not politically correct.</p>

		<p>I wonder how many Germans read that Spiegel article and contemplated the fact that for years in their nation, the people who accurately predicted this exact sequence of events were shouted down because of their &#8220;hateful&#8221; rhetoric.</p>
<p>So we see that logic and common sense are hateful only up to the point that the crisis is no longer avoidable.  At that point, it becomes A-OK to discuss the matter as the authorities work to convince the public that the only way out of the mess is STILL MORE IMMIGRATION.</p>
<p>The leaders of the European nations have betrayed their people, and will not be content until the last White citizen is dead and buried.  How long will the people let this constant attack on their homelands continue before they put a stop to the madness?</p>

		<p>The only people concerned with a decrease in population are the ones who stand to lose money because of it.  A tight labor market means higher wages must be payed to attract employees.  Less consumerism means fewer strip malls, grocery stores, big box stores, etc. being built or natural areas being paved over.  </p>

<p>Its not that simple.  There will not be &#8220;more jobs to go around&#8221;.  There will be fewer.  If there are fewer people, demand for goods and services decreases.  Having fewer children will not result in an unemployment-free utopia.</p>
<p>And, as you yourself point out, &#8220;envious others&#8221; will come after land that is not populated to carrying capacity.  Sparsely populated lands will have more trouble defending themselves.</p>

		<p>This is nonsense that can compete with the anthropogenic global warming idiocy.</p>
<p>Overpopulation drives average living standards down (relative to what can be reasonably expected in times of astonishing progress in technology of production), yet the morons are lamenting that this damaging trend may actually reverse?</p>
<p>They are pushing us vigorously into Malthusian trap, and call any sound research based on Malthus laws (I highly recommend Gregory Clark&rsquo;s &#8220;A Farewell to Alms&#8221;) &#8220;absurd&#8221;.</p>
<p>(It&rsquo;s worth remembering that the Renaissance in Europe that led to unheared of progress in arts, science, and individual liberty, happened right after plague decimated Europe&rsquo;s population.)</p>
<p>But what could you expect? The now largely dysfunctional system of enforcement of academic statndards and passing criteria allowed many morons to land on position of influence once reserved for the most intelli8gentand educated. And they do their moronic job undoing like termites what generations of Americans did in order to separate the smart for the dull.</p>
<p>Expect more of the same as long as the curse of diversity (which includes state support for exorbitant non-white fertility) is being imposed on us.<br>

Sifota speaks sense. It only figures that as the population diminishes, the number of jobs and opportunities will not remain the same.  The number of jobs required to service that reduced population will decrease proportionately. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the more people you bring in, the more people you will need to service them.  Ad infinitum!  The growth racket becomes an endless &#8220;Ponzi Scheme&#8221;  &mdash;   as some posters have perfectly described it.  That&rsquo;s exactly what it is.</p>

<p>A very astute observation. I think in order to understand the birth rate factor, we need to look at factors that are applicable in all low-birth rate countries, including those from East Asia. East Asia, like Russia, does not have many immigrants, so immigration/multiculturalism cannot be blamed (although they are more dangerous when a people are experiencing low birth rates). </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s things that I can think of that the Anglosphere, Europe, Russia, and East Asia all have in common:</p>
<p>- Developed nations with a history of civilization, technological development, and/or imperialism. </p>
<p>- Feminism/liberated women (in contrast to the Third World). </p>
<p>- Materialism</p>
<p>- Greater wealth/prosperity (in contrast to the Third World)</p>
<p>- Higher average IQs. </p>
<p>- Greater levels of pollution, environmental damage. Greater reliance on processed foods.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to blame all of these things for the birth rate of the West/East Asia. I really don&rsquo;t know. But because all of these things are factors that all of these countries have in common, perhaps a reasonable hypothesis can be formed. Does anyone have any ideas?</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is that the ancient Romans and Greeks went through low birth rates (and possibly extinction as a result), so perhaps it would be worthwhile drawing comparisons between the West of today and Greco-Roman civilizations. </p>
