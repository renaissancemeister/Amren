<h1> 16 Illegals Sue Arizona Rancher</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jerry Seper, Newsmax, May 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An Arizona man who has waged a 10-year campaign to stop a flood of illegal immigrants from crossing his property is being sued by 16 Mexican nationals who accuse him of conspiring to violate their civil rights when he stopped them at gunpoint on his ranch on the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
<p>Roger Barnett, 64, began rounding up illegal immigrants in 1998 and turning them over to the U.S. Border Patrol, he said, after they destroyed his property, killed his calves and broke into his home.</p>
<p>His Cross Rail Ranch near Douglas, Ariz., is known by federal and county law enforcement authorities as &#8220;the avenue of choice&#8221; for immigrants seeking to enter the United States illegally.</p>
<p>Trial continues Monday in the federal lawsuit, which seeks $32 million in actual and punitive damages for civil rights violations, the infliction of emotional distress and other crimes. Also named are Mr. Barnett&rsquo;s wife, Barbara, his brother, Donald, and Larry Dever, sheriff in Cochise County, Ariz., where the Barnetts live. The civil trial is expected to continue until Friday.</p>
<p>The lawsuit is based on a March 7, 2004, incident in a dry wash on the 22,000-acre ranch, when he approached a group of illegal immigrants while carrying a gun and accompanied by a large dog.</p>
<p>Attorneys for the immigrants  &mdash;  five women and 11 men who were trying to cross illegally into the United States  &mdash;  have accused Mr. Barnett of holding the group captive at gunpoint, threatening to turn his dog loose on them and saying he would shoot anyone who tried to escape.</p>
<p>The immigrants are represented at trial by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), which also charged that Sheriff Dever did nothing to prevent Mr. Barnett from holding their clients at &#8220;gunpoint, yelling obscenities at them and kicking one of the women.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the lawsuit, MALDEF said Mr. Barnett approached the group as the immigrants moved through his property, and that he was carrying a pistol and threatening them in English and Spanish. At one point, it said, Mr. Barnett&rsquo;s dog barked at several of the women and he yelled at them in Spanish, &#8220;My dog is hungry and he&rsquo;s hungry for buttocks.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lawsuit said he then called his wife and two Border Patrol agents arrived at the site. It also said Mr. Barnett acknowledged that he had turned over 12,000 illegal immigrants to the Border Patrol since 1998.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This is my land. I´m the victim here,&#8221; Mr. Barnett said. &#8220;When someone´s home and loved ones are in jeopardy and the government seemingly can´t do anything about it, I feel justified in taking matters into my own hands. And I always watch my back.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Illegal foreign nationals suing an American citizen rancher.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beyond comment. Why be specific? All that one can think is that Americans who don&rsquo;t get it yet, NEVER, EVER WILL GET &#8220;IT&#8221;. </p>
<p>Hint: We have so many traitors, in the courts, in the schools, in different levels of government, and right among us as plain ordinary &#8220;citizens&#8221;, that it&rsquo;s twilight zone type stuff. It seems it can&rsquo;t be true, but it is.</p>

		<p>Only citizens of a country can claim the civil rights, priveleges and responsibilities of that nation. MEXICANS do not have AMERICAN Civil Rights. They do have humanitarian rights, and I do not see that the rancher violated those. They were not detained for days, physically beaten, raped, deprived of food or water or other necessities or comforts. <br>
On the other hand, THEY deprived him of his civil rights as a citizen of the United States to have a home free of criminal invaders swarming across his land, killing his cattle, vandalizing his water tanks, machinery, and outbuildings, and depriving himself, his wife and children of basic safety and peace of mind. <br>
Shouting at someone does not harm them, and if you are a lone person protecting yourself, family and property against criminals breaking into your nation via your back yard, armed is the only way to sure you will live to see the sun rise.</p>

		<p>He might have committed unlawful detainment, but that&rsquo;s up to the county prosecutors to determine.  This lawsuit is a simple shakedown attempt; it is not illegal or a &#8220;rights violation&#8221; to call law-enforcement agents when one witnesses criminal activity.</p>

		<p>The rancher who was killed by the illegal aliens, as unfortunate and tragic as it was, has become a martyr for our cause.Because of his death, the Arizona law was passed,other states are following suit, and I have observed a groundswell of support stopping the illegal alien invasion.  </p>

		<p>I hate it so much everyone time I hear this argument (I hear it a lot).</p>
<p>There are two main things to consider:  Civil Rights and Human Rights.</p>
<p>Human Rights are entitled to everyone on the planet, even the ones that do not receive them.  Things like water, not being murdered, etc.</p>
<p>Civil Rights ONLY exist in America and are only guaranteed to American Citizens.  Things like not being persecuted, a right to pursuing happiness, owning property, etc.  Illegal immigrants are never guaranteed Civil Rights.</p>
<p>Another right that goes along with owning property is defending your land/possessions.  If anything Barnett had his Civil Rights trampled on by the judicial system and a bunch of people not even citizens of this country.  Its not like Mr. Barnett made them all kneel down and executed them.  Don&rsquo;t get me started on today&rsquo;s legal system.</p>
<p>&#8220;Constant exposure to dangers will breed contempt for them.&#8221; -Seneca</p>

		<p>&#8220;He might have committed unlawful detainment&#8221;</p>
<p>This would depend on the state laws of AZ. More than likely because they were in the process of violating the law on his property at the time, he was probably within his rights to use reasonable force to engage in a citizen arrest. A confrontation with a large group would have mandated his use of a dog and firearm for his own protection.</p>

		<p>Those illegals should consider themselves lucky to be alive, thanks to the fact that the rancher is a decent guy. If this is what happens when you do the right thing and turn them over then wheres the incentive not to just shoot them right there? 22,000 uninhabited acres of land&hellip;. i think i&rsquo;d run the low risk of getting caught for that, rather than be sued for $32 million </p>

		<p>Again, I can only comment that the USA and Western Europe today are in a position similar to the Roman Empire after the Battle of Adrianople, AD 378. It&rsquo;s worth a google to see the similarities.</p>
<p><i>The lawsuit said he then called his wife and two Border Patrol agents arrived at the site. It also said Mr. Barnett acknowledged that he had turned over 12,000 illegal immigrants to the Border Patrol since 1998.</i></p>
<p>12,000? </p>
<p>And that is just the number he <i>caught</i>?!  His property must be a super-highway for illegal immigration. But also consider that, if one man and his wife are able to apprehend this number of invaders, what could be done if we had a concerted effort to defend the frontiers. </p>

		<p>Criminal invaders have no rights, and hence no standing to sue. That these illegals were even able to sue this guy is a mockery of justice and our legal system, at the hands of criminals and hostile invaders. Moreover, this lawsuit will in the end be counter productive, along with the murder of an Arizona rancher at their hands. It will get to the point where these ranchers are going to shoot and kill these invaders then dump the bodies somewhere if this willful persecution of native citizens suffer harm at the hands of illegals keeps up. The man was a victim time and time again, what about his rights? This is where vigilante justice and armed rebellions come from, people being abused and stripped of their civil rights, property, even lives at the hands of either criminal governments or invading aliens. This man&rsquo;s family is in grave danger of being murdered by these enemy aliens, I hope they are all armed and alert for trouble.</p>

		<p>You should be unsurprised to hear that both La Raza and MALDEF received their initial funding from the Ford Foundation.  (It will do you no good to boycott Ford Motor Company, I&rsquo;m sure the Foundation has long since diversified its holdings.)</p>
<p>Henry Ford created the Ford Foundation as a way of keeping his money from being taken away in inheritance taxes.  Had he known what it would become I&rsquo;m sure he would instead have put all his money in one giant pile and burned it.</p>
