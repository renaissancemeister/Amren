<h1>Which Group Faces the Most Discrimination Today?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lizz Carroll, Diversity, Inc., May 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The results of a recent Associated Press-Univision poll showed that 61 percent of people overall said Latinos face significant discrimination. This percentage was higher than that of other traditionally underrepresented groups: 52 percent said Blacks face significant discrimination and 50 percent said women do.</p>
<p>Latinos aren&rsquo;t the only ones feeling that they face significant discrimination; while 81 percent of Latinos said their ethnic group confronts a lot or some discrimination, 59 percent of non-Latinos said the same about Latinos.  </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In response to the poll, Lisa Navarrete, vice president of the National Council of La Raza (NCLR), felt positive about the results from the general population. &#8220;They&rsquo;re recognizing that this community has been singled out and targeted,&#8221; she told The Associated Press.</p>
<p>Other notable results include:</p>
<p>    * Forty percent of Latinos said they had experienced discrimination personally</p>

		<p>What is ironic is that the mention of anti-white discrimination was not mentioned and probably no whites were asked if they have felt discrimination and the just forgot to add in that whites were the one doin the descrimination </p>

		<p>White men are the most discriminated against people in America, and probably the world.  This is a widely ignored fact that white guilt, and male guilt is poured out in the media, literature, and taught in schools that the white man is the cause of the worlds problems. There are colleges for women only, blacks only, but what about for white men? There are womens groups and minority groups ranging from the black caucus to National association for Women, Women only hospitals and health clubs, but what about for white men?  There are more women in college than men, and women now make more money than men, so how are the discriminated against?</p>
<p>This is the irony of these ridiculous surveys, that the most discriminated and hated person on the face of the earth, the one who gets all the blame, and no thanks, the one who is not allowed any group affiliation, the one who it is widely accepted and ENCOURAGED to hate, the white man isn&rsquo;t even an option as being discriminated against. That&rsquo;s how much he is disregarded. Still he is the one who has the BURDEN and has given his power and entitlement to the other peoples of the world, remember, He didn&rsquo;t have to.  </p>
<p>The most hated people in the world continue to fight for others, and yet does not complain against the bigotry and double standards put upon him, but realizes he doesn&rsquo;t have to complain because a real virtuous people don&rsquo;t blame others, they just do their best, and good flows from that. That IS the White Man.</p>

		<p>Univision is a Hispanice Television Group. They have spanish language newscasts and spanish programming. What would you expect them to find. Of course they are gonna say Mexicans are the most discriminated against. </p>
<p>Here are a few facts to undermine the theory that Mexicans are the most discriminated against. </p>
<p>I work to pay taxes and send my kids to private school so they won&rsquo;t get beat up. That&rsquo;a a double whammy on whitey. </p>
<p>I am not eligable for food stamps and I pay my medical insurance while Mexicans pay nothing and are supporting thier families with all kinds of government benefits. </p>
<p>Affirmative action just knocked me out of a promotion. </p>
<p>Affirmative action just knocked me out of law school.</p>
<p>I am having fewer children since I am responsible for their well being. While the Mexican is propagating with impunity since he doesn&rsquo;t have to care for his progeny. </p>
<p>I am paying taxes to support prisons, schools, hospitals and added law enforcement all because Mexicans are running rampant in out society. </p>
<p>Mexicans are keeping wages low by flooding the workforce.</p>
<p>You tell me who is the most discriminated against. </p>

		<p>The most discriminated against group: white males over 40 who are either underemployed or unemployed.  The Federal government, the nations largest employer and biggest discriminator.  The Feds did away with civil service tests in order to be able to hire more non-whites.</p>
<p>What I find interesting is the statement that immigrants add to our economy.  Now we all know that government employees are NET tax consumers, not contributors.  If immigrants add to our economy why do so many work in local, state and federal government?  <br>

		<p>I am a 54 yr old white male, and our world, you have to earn everything you get.  So we do.  Now, because we worked hard and have life a little better than the slugs who are doing the complaining, we are the bad guys.  Well, I don&rsquo;t feel one bit guilty for working hard.  I work in the High tech medical electronic field, where you only get  by if you know what you are doing, and can do the job.   In other words, you have to be smart AND hard working.  Oddly enough, there are only about  5%  minorities&hellip;..</p>

<p>What an irony that there is one group discriminated so much that the study doesn&rsquo;t even have to say it would be his fault that Mexicans are discriminated against.<br>
Everybody who reads that article exactly know which group was not asked because it is an evil groups which is to blame for everything and can never be a victim with feelings and rights but just can be a devil.</p>

		<p>* Fourty percent of Latinos said they had experienced discrimination personally. </p>
<p>* The other sixty percent couldn&rsquo;t understand the question because they couldn&rsquo;t speak English. </p>
<p>If I were to go to Germany tomorrow and try to get a job I could feel discriminated against. I can&rsquo;t speak German and would have a hard time communicating, I don&rsquo;t have a visa and could feel that I was being treated unfairly because they hired a German ( or Turk) instead of me. </p>
<p>So if I decide to move to another country where I&rsquo;m uninvited and do so illegally and they don&rsquo;t roll out the red carpet for me then I&rsquo;m being discriminated against. </p>

		<p>I saw a commercial last night for cameras.  A white male paid full price for his camera.  A hip, attractive, well-dressed, intelligent looking black couple got the same camera for less money.  The three of them are standing near a cliff trying to take pictures, and the idiot, clumsy white male  &mdash;   same guy who paid too much for his camera  &mdash;   falls off the cliff and tumbles &#8220;hilariously&#8221; to the ground, while the wonderful black couple stands calmly on the cliff, ignoring his plight and competently taking pictures.  I guess we were supposed to laugh, ha ha.  My point?  The white male is the only one who can be openly ridiculed like that.  Reverse the races and just imagine!!</p>
<p>Years ago, John and Yoko Lennon came out with a song called &#8220;Woman is the (n-word) of the world.&#8221;  Now it&rsquo;s the white male who is the n-word of the world.  HE is the most discriminated against.</p>

		<p>We absolutely agreed with your viewpoint for white men - the most discriminated people on Earth.  Since I am an unemployed white disabled man and I am still out of work since two years ago, I had enormously experienced in reverse discrimination, prejudiced and taunted by ethnic minorities.  </p>
<p>We strongly support stricter Arizona Immigrant Law and banned Ethnic Studies.  Ethnic Studies promoted racism and created belligerents toward common white American people.  For example, looked at the racial incident on the day of Cinco de Mayo in Live Oaks High School in Morgan Hill - 200 Latino students walked out of the school for their protest of five students who wore American patriotic flags and decals that led these five students to expel from the school by the order of Latino assistant principal.  A large gang of Latino students yelled &#8220;Mexico!&#8221; and taunted to a white male in a wheelchair who waved the American flag - it was offensively racial and anti-American disturbing.  How could Mexican-American students desecrate American flags and mock our American rights and dignity on the land of the freedom?<br>
   <br>
After I left Riverside, California in mid-1980s, I recently visited my old white friend there a few months ago and he despondently told me that California already became Mexifornia.  I was deeply shocked to see the result of the deteriorating quality of life and depressing living condition in California - high taxes with eroded services, state bankruptcies, reverse racial discrimination, a glut of illegal immigrants, and high crime.  Illegal immigrants certainly sank the golden state of California to turn into a land of the broken dream.  America was no longer to be the land of melting pot because of a lack of American cultural assimilation, especially for huge illegal alien population and rising younger minority population.  Today America is the land of a salad-mixed bowl because of numerous fragments of ethnic enclaves across the country.  Recently, Latino-majority bigotry-minded Los Angeles city councils voted to boycott Arizona for their inane protest of stricter Arizona Immigrant Law.  They will pay their consequence for boycotting other state, dividing the country and tear down the American civilization. <br>
  <br>
Eventually American civilization will fall imminently and thanks to President Obama  for extinguishing the American civilization by letting several millions of illegal aliens roaming freely and creating racial tensions among multi-ethnic American people to end up a huge divisions of tribalism across the country - Balkanization of the USA.  We feel sad to see this happen because Obama, his friend Eric Holder and his influential backers (Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson and Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr.) are playing the propaganda-ploy media game for bringing the idea of racism and outcry over stricter Arizona Immigrant Law in order to promote more Democratic and Latino voters to elect for Obama on the Presidential Election of 2012. These situations certainly stir-up and intimidate multi-ethnic American people to embroil into a racial hostile feeling.  Obama is not a civilization builder nor unifier neither and also, he is not a military soldier, historian nor an economist neither.  He was only a civil rights lawyer in Chicago for his civic involvements in mainly racial issues.   Economy and jobs are number one priorities for American people who need financially help.</p>
<p>Heterogeneous society never achieve successfully for every civilization through the human history because of the mentality of cultural and racial differences, and intense competitions among multi-ethnic populations that never meld together effectively.  Egyptian Empire, Roman Empire, Spanish Empire, British Empire, Ottoman Empire and Soviet Union collapsed because of huge heterogeneous society and moribund economy that led them to fall.  American civilization will be the next fall.  Obviously, American civilization is dying.  Looked at the history from the day of the American Independence to today&rsquo;s era.  We already passed the golden age of a homogeneous society of American civilization that was in late 1960s and early 1970s - the first men on the Moon and the robust economy with its self-sufficiency which nearly everything was made here in USA.  We are already facing toward a bleak and dark future for our American civilization.  Russian academic Igor Panarin will definitely be right for his prediction of America collapses within a few years.  We remembered French historian Emmanuel Todd in mid-1970s who made his accurate prediction of the Soviet Union collapses that was actually happened twenty years ago!<br>
