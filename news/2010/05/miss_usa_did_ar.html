	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Miss Oklahoma Morgan Elizabeth Woolard finished first runner-up to winner Rima Fakih of Michigan, and conspiracy theorists are grumbling that her support of SB 1070 may have cost her the crown in a repeat of last year&rsquo;s Carrie Prejean controversy.</p>
<p>When &#8220;The Office&#8221; star Oscar Nunez posed Miss Oklahoma a question about where she stood on Arizona&rsquo;s SB 1070 Sunday night, the crowd erupted in boos over the intrusion of politics, Fox News reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m a huge believer in states&rsquo; rights. I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so wonderful about America,&#8221; Woolard answered of the law which requires state police to stop and question possible undocumented immigrants. &#8220;So I think it&rsquo;s perfectly fine for Arizona to create that law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Woolard added that she is against racial profiling.</p>

<p>But both of these young women had more balls than most and gave the un-PC answer.  Good for them.</p>

		<p>Clearly it&rsquo;d be difficult to verify whether Miss Okla.&rsquo;s stand cost her,but the pros &amp; cons are:<br>
 Why would they use a Latin Oscar Nunez,to ask her the question THAT &hellip;was suspicious. and definitely in poor taste.They should be castigated for that alone,since50% of Latins are against the ariz. law,that constitutes a slanted probability of his bias.</p>
<p>His demographic hardly comes close to matching national polling opinion</p>

		<p>One of the judges was Cuban-Hispanic, who had the audacity to ask a question about an American immigration law in a condescending tone.  The winner of this pageant was an Arab woman with ancestry in Lebanon.  And they dare call this thing &#8220;USA.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Well, Miss America, just like everything else, has gotten politically correct.  Give the &#8220;wrong&#8221; ie. un-PC answer and you can forget winning. Of course, I agree that they shouldn&rsquo;t bring politics into it.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure Miss Woolard&rsquo;s response didnt help her any. But lets face it. She stood little chance. A panel full of leftists, with names like &#8220;Nunez&#8221;, were not about to choose a White girl over a non White. </p>
<p>In an ideal world, Whites would boycott these anti White contests and have there own Whites only beauty pagents, just like other races have. But we all know that isnt going to happen. </p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t really take these contests seriously, because they have ceased to be about beauty or talent. they are about political correctness. I&rsquo;m sure Miss OK has spent a big part of her life preparing for these competitions, and I don&rsquo;t know what kind of person she really is, but her answer to the question suggests that she is a person of integrity; there&rsquo;s no way she  wouldn&rsquo;t know the implications of such an answer. So in my book, she is the true winner. She is a lady and an American. </p>

		<p>It seems Elizabeth Woolard is a politically literate beauty pageant contestant. Asking the average citizen what they thought of SB 1070, especially as it&rsquo;s a state bill from another state, would normally draw a glazed eyes response. Such a question was obviously a loaded one, that would have meant little to most of the contestants. </p>
<p>Miss Woolard must have understood the implications of answering as candidly as she did. It&rsquo;s too bad she felt she had to qualify her answer by disapproving profiling, which I doubt is her genuine opinion. Still, she is a brave woman who deserves recognition for her stand as well as her awareness. </p>

		<p>First of all, I&rsquo;d like to applaud the audience for booing that idiot Oscar Nunez.  Kudos to them!</p>
<p>Secondly, it&rsquo;s unfair to target Ms. Woolard for saying she&rsquo;s against &#8220;racial profiling.&#8221;  Did you notice the expression on her face when she said it?  Can you say &#8220;gag me with a spoon&#8221;?  The only reason she made that disclaimer is because she knew that&rsquo;s what the lefties wanted to hear. </p>

<p>She was also probably aware at that moment she had no chance of winning due to her answer (and her complexion).  Double kudos to her for coming out in favor of states&rsquo; rights and Arizona!  She deserved to win, since unlike Rima Fakih, Elizabeth Woolard is a real American.</p>
<p>Sorry, but I have to say this.  Why does any White person even bother watching beauty pageants anymore?  Since 1984 when the Miss America pageant was rigged to insure a black winner (both winner &amp; first runner-up were black) it should be obvious to anyone with a working brain these pageants are bogus!  The winners are supposed to represent &#8220;the ideal of American womanhood&#8221; but they&rsquo;re anything but these days.</p>

<p>I stopped watching them after 1984.  I never went back.  I don&rsquo;t miss them, either.  It&rsquo;s worth noting since 1984 the % of the TV audiences watching these shows has dropped dramatically.  The Miss America pageant can&rsquo;t even get network coverage anymore.</p>

		<p>I think allowing that pro-illegal immigration buffoon to be a judge, took the crown from her. He no doubt voted against her because he didn&rsquo;t like her honest, states rights answer. I would guess that 99 out of a 100 guys asked, would say that Ms. Oklahoma is hands down a more beautiful woman than the winner. A final comment. This whole incident shows again, how blatantly, without the slightest fear or shame, hispanics like Nunez will always,ALWAYS, be a thorn in the side of Americans who believe in borders and immigration law. </p>

		<p>So let&rsquo;s get this straight: a beautiful White American-born beauty pagaent contestant, was entrapped by a Mestizo judge with a political question designed to uphold the inundation of our nation with his kind   &mdash;   for which the correct patriotic answer was as obvious as it was different from the PC one that the leftist panels running all such events, would approve of. And the result? some Michingan Arab woman won the contest. Seems to me Ms. Woolard was racially profiled in this anti-White ambush.</p>

		<p>The most important thing about this beauty contest decision is that it&rsquo;s another stick in the eye to the bulk of most Americans.  I, for one, don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re doomed to extinction, dhimmitude, or Atzlanization.  The more the cultural left and its minions poke and prod, the closer will come the day we finally turn on our tormentors.  </p>

		<p>Looking at the YouTube video I think she answered it very well given it&rsquo;s such a hot topic. I did notice that she didn&rsquo;t actually answer the question but it would have forced her to support Arizona by choosing one of the two options. Perhaps that was the idea?</p>

<p>If you listen to the video, it&rsquo;s obvious from the tone of her voice that she added the thing about being &#8220;against racial profiling&#8221; as a bone to the PC crowd so they wouldn&rsquo;t totally rip her apart.

		<p>This year&rsquo;s Miss Oklahoma is one of the most gorgeous females is have yet seen, and her Arab rival just couldn&rsquo;t hold a candle to her. But the Arab won.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s intersting that the judge who asked her a difficult question (or a trick question?) about immigration VS the law, is a Mestizo man named Oscar Nunez.</p>
<p>Well, this is another insult to the White majority, I&rsquo;d say. </p>

<p>When she begins acting like a respectable woman, I&rsquo;ll applaud her political views.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amen brother.</p>

		<p>So in the 2009 miss USA contest, the openly gay judge Perez Hilton asked the blonde conservative contestant Carrie Prejean about gay marriage resulting in<br>
 1. Her not winning.  <br>
2. An ongoing smear campaign against her, for her &#8216;right wing&rsquo; stance.</p>
<p>And now in the 2010 Miss USA contest, the Cuban-Hispanic judge does a similar act, again acting in his own peoples self interest and again aimed at the contestant from the same demographical background i.e. &#8216;the founding stock&rsquo;.<br>
Leads me to speculate that surely these question are screened and/or scripted by the organisers of the event, so it must have been a strategic decision in assigning that particular question to Miss OK.<br>
If this Lebanese girl qualifies to be &#8216;Miss USA&rsquo;, why not give her the loaded question on immigration?  But then I suppose she would&rsquo;ve given the clichéd response of &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the American Dream to come here and build a better life, look at me now&hellip;.blah, blah&#8221;.<br>
In the way it&rsquo;s now culturally accepted that you must never say to a Black person the &#8220;N word&#8221; or call them &#8220;a slave&#8221; or &#8220;boy&#8221; etc., surely in polite circles it must be known that you must never ask a White person about immigration, eugenics, colonisation or having any sort of ethnic pride (national yes, ethnic no). <br>
I wonder what sort of judge the organisers have lined up for the 2011 Miss USA as to eliminate the most beautiful blonde, perhaps an Native American judge asking &#8220;was it right for America to be colonized&#8221;? <br>
Or maybe a HIV+ judge asked &#8220;would you accept a blood transfusion from me&#8221;? Etc.</p>
<p>So the message to the young ladies is &#8220;if you support traditional marriages or the States right to admit only legal immigrants, you&rsquo;re not beautiful!</p>

		<p>Just to add to <i>the message that the Miss USA pageant covertly sends to the young</i>, based on the 2006 Miss USA scandal around Tara Connor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also okay to do cocaine, sleep around, under age drink, and experiment with homosexually as long as you say you are sorry and of course are pro-immigration and pro-gay marriage. </p>
<p>(For the record I sincerely do not follow or watch these types of shows, so don&rsquo;t ask me how I know this stuff).<br>

		<p>I applaud the comments under this article.  It looks like we have real men with integrity posting under this article.  Under the other article, which talks about the arab American winning, there were multiple posters supporting the nomination.  I was shocked.  I really hope most of those people were drive by posters who usually disagree with us, but after looking at some of the names, I am afraid I am wrong.</p>

		<p>In response to the question regarding &#8216;racial profiling&rsquo;, always answer that you favor &#8216;criminal profiling&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Throw the question back at them.  How can they respond?  That they favor criminals?</p>

		<p>I browsed through the pictures of the contestents and noticed the white women &#8220;stood out&#8221; from the brown faces.  However, all of the contestants were heavily made up with the same make up, same hair styles, tan skin and flourescent teeth making it hard to tell what these women look like naturally.  IMO when I imagine this arab winner with a natural appearance, ie. a few pounds, no makeup and limp hair, she could not compete with a white woman in her natural state.</p>
