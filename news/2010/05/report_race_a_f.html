<h1>Report: Race a Factor in Police &#8216;Friendly Fire&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Deepti Hajela, Buffalo News, May 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A panel convened after two officer-on-officer shootings said police departments must confront both overt and unconscious racial bias among officers to reduce the risk of one officer harming another during &#8220;friendly fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The task force examined police-on-police confrontations around the country, finding 26 killings during the past three decades. The panel also found numerous other officer-on-officer confrontations that did not lead to a fatality.</p>
<p>The review of the confrontations found that &#8220;inherent or unconscious racial bias plays a role in shoot/don&rsquo;t-shoot decisions made by officers of all races and ethnicities,&#8221; the report said.</p>
<p>Ten of the officers killed were off duty, including Edwards and Ridley. And nine of the those were minorities. The last white off-duty officer to be killed by an on-duty colleague died in 1982, the task force found. The report didn&rsquo;t find any obvious racial or ethnic pattern among officers who were killed while on-duty.</p>
<p>It issued nine recommendations for local, state and federal police agencies that include developing protocols on how to take police action when an officer is off duty and how an off-duty officer should respond if challenged by on-duty police; and developing testing that measures for unconscious bias, training to help reduce any bias, and a policy that mandates all firearm discharges be reported.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Maki Haberfeld, a professor of police studies at John Jay Criminal College of Justice who wasn&rsquo;t involved with the study, said it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to separate race from these incidents, but not because officers are inherently racist. Police are trained to identify suspects based on body movements and behavioral patterns, but also on the types of paradigms in the neighborhood, she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Haberfeld said she favors any training that would diffuse or minimize stereotypes police officers may have.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Bias&#8221; is now just the nice way of saying Racism.</p>
<p><br>
If you don&rsquo;t hire enough blacks to make the splc, adl, naacp, aclu happy, you will be subjected to &#8220;bias audits&#8221; to root out problem biases (systemic and institutional racism).  These unconfessed biases are what force you to hire Whites when you really want the job done.  Your weakness for not wanting to be surrounded by non whites is the kind of bias we must root out and overcome.</p>
<p>You can have Civilization or Diversity, but you can&rsquo;t have both.</p>

		<p>There should be a study of who has killed, and injured, officers in the last three decades.  Minorities are over represented in these areas.  That would explain some of the &#8220;bias&#8221;.</p>

<p>Stereotypes?  You mean like blacks commiting an insanely disproportionate amount of crime relative to their population?  Oh wait, that would be a fact - not a stereotype.  A fact police officers are very well acquainted with.</p>
<p>Carry on.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;d better worry instead about the layoffs that are coming soon, because the state and cities are having to cut back on all their police personnel.</p>
<p>Next year more drastic cuts will be needed in order to keep the state from collapsing altogether.  2012 looks even worse.</p>
<p>Some police departments in low revenue areas around the country have cut 50% and more of their police forces.</p>

		<p>Living in Western New York and having recently required the assistance of Buffalo PD, I know first hand what a difficult job it is in the multicultural jungle called Buffalo, New York.  Buffalo Police Officers have at times very difficult working conditions, unsympathetic citizens, gobs of drugs being sold openly, gangs, twenty plus thousand abandoned structures for gangs and thugs to hide in, a dull black mayor and a dull white Common Council President.  I believe being a member of the Buffalo Police force is either for those with a special calling or those hard up for a job that pays fairly well and provides decent benefits.  I cannot imagine genuine training that makes the job less hazardous being refused or declined, but politically correct indoctrination will only serve to make the job more dangerous and ultimately further demoralize the force.</p>

		<p>Was there any mention of whether the shooters were white cops or black cops? I suspect a black cop might be more likely to &#8220;bust a cap&#8221; in another black cop than the white cops are.</p>

		<p>Task forces like the one in the article have to come up with some proposed &#8220;solution&#8221; to the problem at hand, so naturally some PC, liberal claptrap will be handed down.  Telling people to change their attitudes won&rsquo;t cost anything, and such vacuous advice can handily be ignored by the police.</p>

		<p>If cops are shooting law abiding citizens (As I am, as a reader, supposed to assume the &#8220;off duty cops&#8221; were) - then shouldn&rsquo;t there be some outrage about cops shooting law abiding citizens, not that they are not shooting them in the correct racial percentage?  </p>
<p>The rules of PC Totalitarianism really confuses me, and I consider myself a fairly smart guy.</p>

		<p>The issue is simple.  When off duty, the white policemen stayed as far away from non-whites in their personal lives as possible.  The non-white cops, did not do this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why on-duty fatalities show no racial pattern while off-duty ones do.</p>
<p>The only &#8220;training&#8221; that will change this is to train the non-white cops to avoid non-whites when off duty and go hang out with whites.</p>

		<p>I agree that a black officer is not only more likely to live among thugs but to have relatives and close friends who are career criminals. The rate of incarceration itself is so high, that it would be hard for a black officer to not be part of it.</p>
<p>I also would not be surprised to learn that a Hispanic on-duty officer would feel freer to use reasonable force when confronted with a swaggering, intoxicated and armed off-duty black than his White counterpart. White officers have seen too many instances in which their training to protect the lives of citizens and fellow officers has had to be put aside for fear of seeming racist.</p>

		<p>Maybe if the off-duty black cops didn&rsquo;t dress like thugs, they wouldn&rsquo;t get mistaken for thugs. I mean really, do the white cops dress up like outlaw motorcycle gang members or skinheads when they&rsquo;re off duty? </p>

		<p>The whole PC/ diversity thing that came from the Civil Rights movement has proven it&rsquo;s self to be a complete and total failure.  As long as blacks look up to people like Jackson, Sharpton and the rest of the con men (and those are good guys compared to the rap and athlete felons) instead of acting like decent citizens nothing will change.  The &#8216;black culture&rsquo; is not a culture it is a criminal way of life and I am sick and tired of supporting it.</p>

		<p>Black cops are likely to socialize with other blacks while off duty.  Even if they are careful about their friends, what about their friends&rsquo; friends?  Given the astronomical crime rates among blacks, it probably doesn&rsquo;t take many steps removed before one encounters genuine lowlifes.</p>
