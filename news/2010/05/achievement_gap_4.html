			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Anonymous, National Association of Scholars, May 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><i>The author of the following article is a teacher who is also a graduate of a prominent school of education. We have agreed to withhold the author&rsquo;s name in light of the plausible prospect that revealing it would damage this high school teacher&rsquo;s professional career. {snip}</i></p>
<p>{snip} I tell them [my high-school students] that they can google me, read up, and ask any questions after they&rsquo;ve done their due diligence.</p>
<p>The first student to do so, a freshman named Alex, came up to me in class and said, &#8220;Hey, I read that article about you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did? What did you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>He hesitated. &#8220;It was weird. I couldn&rsquo;t figure out what it was you did wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} There had to be some reason other than what was reported, because what was reported just didn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m wondering is, does anyone feel the same way Alex did? [At this point I pause and confirm that several people share that confusion.]</p>
<p>Okay, so I&rsquo;ll give the background needed to answer Alex&rsquo;s question.</p>
<p>But be warned that what I&rsquo;m about to explain is something that is a monstrously big free speech red zone in and of itself. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The achievement gap pervades every corner of American educational policy discussion. Nothing else matters. No Child Left Behind was entirely about the achievement gap and measuring schools to see if they&rsquo;d closed it. Obama&rsquo;s Race to the Top is just another take on the achievement gap  &mdash;  again, focusing on testing and this time holding teachers responsible if they can&rsquo;t get low-performing students to improve.</p>
<p>In the public domain, you&rsquo;ll hear two contrasting views about the achievement gap, its cause and solution. The first is the progressive view, the one associated with &#8220;progressive education,&#8221; which holds that social injustice, institutionalized racism, white prejudice, and other societal ills cause the achievement gap. {snip}</p>
<p>So progressives push for underachievers to spend more time with achievers who will model desirable behavior. When achievers aren&rsquo;t available, progressives seek to create the value system within the child and the community by demonstrating their involvement and cultural acceptance. {snip}</p>
<p>Those who have this progressive view are also generally well left of center. More importantly for purposes of this discussion, teacher education programs do not readily tolerate any deviance from the progressive view.</p>
<p>The second view, what I&rsquo;ll call the conservative view of the achievement gap, also focuses on student values. But instead of encouraging teachers to respect the student&rsquo;s culture, conservatives say that parents and teachers of low-performing students are the cause of the gap, by failing to give the students the correct cultural values. Hard work, family values, commitment to the importance of education, and &#8220;no excuses,&#8221; to quote the Thernstroms, who are major proponents of the conservative view, will close the achievement gap. {snip}</p>
<p>To illustrate the difference between conservative and progressive viewpoints on the achievement gap, consider how each discusses Asians. (Note: I am well aware that &#8220;Asian&#8221; is a ridiculously large population about which you can&rsquo;t generalize. I&rsquo;m just telling you the conversation.) Those with a progressive view of education almost never mention Asians. I often joke that in ed school, you only read about white boys in special ed class, white girls in the eating disorders unit, and Asians make a brief cameo in the ESL course. {snip}</p>
<p>If all you watched were the shout shows, you&rsquo;d never know there was another way of assessing the achievement gap. And in fact, while progressives and conservatives have many adherents and could even be described as &#8220;groups,&#8221; those holding the third view don&rsquo;t get together much. They don&rsquo;t hold meetings, they don&rsquo;t have organizations, and in general, they avoid the field of educational policy. People holding this third view  &mdash;  again, not a group  &mdash;  don&rsquo;t talk much in public. Let&rsquo;s call this third view the Voldemort View: the View That Must Not Be Named.</p>
<p>To introduce you to the Voldemort View, here&rsquo;s an exchange between Steven Pinker, one of the foremost cognitive scientists (and not, I hasten to observe, way out there on the Voldemort ledge), and Malcolm Gladwell, a trendy writer whose writing on education and achievement pleases both conservatives and progressives and who, in the interests of full disclosure, I must tell you I can&rsquo;t stand.</p>
<p>{snip}<blockquote>The common thread in Gladwell&rsquo;s writing is a kind of populism, which seeks to undermine the ideals of talent, intelligence and analytical prowess in favor of luck, opportunity, experience and intuition.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Unfortunately he wildly overstates his empirical case. It is simply not true that a quarterback&rsquo;s rank in the draft is uncorrelated with his success in the pros, that cognitive skills don&rsquo;t predict a teacher&rsquo;s effectiveness, that intelligence scores are poorly related to job performance or .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that above a minimum I.Q. of 120, higher intelligence does not bring greater intellectual achievements.<br>
</blockquote>Gladwell replied loftily in his nytimes.com blog, &#8220;It is always a pleasure to be reviewed by someone as accomplished as Stephen Pinker, even if he is unhappy .&nsbp;.&nbsp;. with the fact that I have not joined him on the lonely ice floe of IQ fundamentalism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pinker shot back, &#8220;What Malcolm Gladwell calls a &#8216;lonely ice floe&rsquo; is what psychologists call &#8216;the mainstream.&rsquo;&#8221; (pause while I snorfle appreciatively)</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Did you notice that neither progressives nor conservatives ever mention cognitive ability in their diagnosis? Ask either group about this omission, and they will vigorously assure you that it has no relationship to the achievement gap  &mdash;  but they&rsquo;ll also look at you with narrowed eyes, wondering why on earth you&rsquo;re bringing up cognitive ability in the first place. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And so, the Voldemort View: academic achievement is primarily explained by cognitive ability, and therefore the achievement gap is also most likely caused in large part by differences in cognitive ability. People with this view don&rsquo;t promote solutions, primarily because in order to even start thinking about solutions one has to be able to discuss the possible cause and mentioning this cause is politically unacceptable. People who think it likely that the achievement gap is primarily cognitive don&rsquo;t usually risk mentioning it in public because it&rsquo;s a career destroyer. Please do not infer any other opinions about those with a Voldemort View, because I promise you, most of what you&rsquo;re likely to assume is simply wrong.</p>
<p>You might be wondering whether I&rsquo;m a conservative or a Voldemort. Here&rsquo;s the really funny part  &mdash;  it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I would have run into trouble at ed school regardless. {snip}</p>
<p>Why? I think ed schools see the public rejection of affirmative action, its embrace of welfare reform and crackdowns on illegal immigrants, and all the other rollbacks of the liberal agenda as profoundly wrong and evil acts. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much easier to move from teaching to an education think tank or a doctoral program if you&rsquo;ve got a degree and credential from, say, Columbia Teacher&rsquo;s College than if your degree has the local state diploma mill stamp. Elite ed schools use the one area where they reign supreme to withhold legitimacy from dissenters.</p>
<p>Someone who provided essential support during my troubles told me a funny story. He was posting information about me on Facebook, and up popped an ad for USC&rsquo;s online Masters of Arts in Teaching program. On impulse, he called the recruiter to see if they had any sort of ideological requirements and (quoting from his note) &#8220;asked him if USC enforces belief in specific values like &#8216;equity&rsquo; or that &#8216;everyone can learn,&rsquo; and [the recruiter] assured me that one of the admission essays is precisely on this point and that people with unsuitable views are weeded out!&#8221;</p>
<p>And so when the head of my ed school became aware that I already had opinions about educational policy, and that these views weren&rsquo;t progressive, no further information was needed. {snip} What was imperative to the head of my ed school was that someone with my views could not be given the imprimatur of this university. {snip}</p>
<p>I knew  &mdash;  or thought I knew  &mdash;  what I was getting into. I understood the politics. I understood that progressives controlled ed schools, and I was under no illusion that I&rsquo;d have anything approaching academic freedom.</p>
<p>What I didn&rsquo;t understand until that point, however, was how impermeable the barrier was. I figured that a few had gotten in before, they&rsquo;d be chagrined that one other had slipped in, and oh well. Instead, the blockade had never been breached  &mdash;  or if it had, the other intruders had taken the hint and left. I had underestimated both their determination and their prior success at keeping non-progressives out, and how one seemingly minor comment had set off klaxons and red lights throughout the education complex.</p>
<p>Many people think this is entirely reasonable behavior for a private university. I&rsquo;ll merely observe that the universities themselves don&rsquo;t think so, and adamantly deny that the behavior exists. Moreover, the federal government provides loan forgiveness to teachers who meet certain categories, and the ed schools that benefit most from loan forgiveness are the elite schools who charge a small fortune. Should ed schools impose an ideological litmus test when their income is reliant on federal loan forgiveness? I would argue no. In any case, I think the associated university should openly acknowledge the ideological demands that ed schools  &mdash;  which are usually university cash cows  &mdash;  impose on their applicants.</p>
<p>So to answer Alex&rsquo;s question, this is what I did that was wrong: I revealed that I probably didn&rsquo;t view the achievement gap through the progressive lens. This ed school, like all elite ed schools, wants neither conservatives nor Voldemorts to benefit from its elite status. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Does that clarify anything? (Emphatic nods). Phew. Consider yourself initiated and stop scratching your heads. Now let&rsquo;s go onto something easy like the free speech implications of my case.<br>

		<p>The belief that cognitive abilities, or for that matter any other cognitive traits, are distributed evenly among racial groups is an entirely political conclusion that defies what we observe in every aspect of racial quantitative measures.</p>
<p>Science, like the rest of life (i.e. academia) is still, like through history, subordinate to the politics of the day rather than discreet impartial measure.</p>

		<p>Not much to add here, except that the &#8220;conservatives&#8221; in this case are just as anti-racist as the progressives, and inevitably, many miles down the road, the conservatives and the progressives would merge, even if there was no external &#8220;threat&#8221; of a &#8220;Voldemort&#8221; to battle.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Why? I think ed schools see the public rejection of affirmative action, its embrace of welfare reform and crackdowns on illegal immigrants, and all the other rollbacks of the liberal agenda as profoundly wrong and evil acts. {snip}</i></p>
<p>Here, I think the progressives are merely looking at the world through the lens of a slippery slope.  They think that any concession to the conservative mindset will inevitably lead to Voldemortism, and all the nefarious consequences that progressives think are a result of it, such as genocide.  For progressives, you&rsquo;re either a 100% progressive all the way, or you might as well have been a German fascist from the 1930s   &mdash;   This dove tails back to the discussion about rectitude (aka a certain type of consistency) between A Reader and myself from Friday&rsquo;s news item.</p>

		<p>If Asian are discussed (and why is everyone, including places like California, obsessed being second best? Always and only compared with the white group: the oppressors) if they are discussed, educators will quickly mention the &#8216;model minority&rsquo; stereotype and the assertion that every group is oppressed by this &#8216;stereotype&rsquo;, Asians and non-asians alike, with the exception being whites of course, who are always the oppressors. And yet Asians often seem to rise above this oppression. Oops, there I go again&hellip;</p>

		<p>What the egalitarians fear most is the revealing of their own inferiority.</p>
<p>A truly superior man cares not what others will say about his ability because he can demonstrate to himself and others that he is superior.  This man welcomes challenge and publicity.</p>
<p>A truly inferior man cares very deeply what others will say because he can not even measure up to the average.  This man fears challenge and publicity.</p>
<p>White egalitarians are very often above the intelligence of Hispanics and Blacks but low compared to other Whites, Jews and Asians.</p>
<p>They are not so concerned with the perception of Hispanics and Blacks as they are with the perception of themselves.  </p>
<p>(Don&rsquo;t expect for them to tell you this with their words.  They are either too ashamed or too deep in denial to honestly discuss it.)</p>

		<p>The only lingering doubt in my mind about all this is the old saw about how we use only a small percentage of our brains. I mean, is EVERYONE potentially way smarter than the level at which they currently perform? Some part of me still refuses to believe that blacks and Mesoamericans are really as dumb as they seem, or at least that it&rsquo;s because of hardwiring.</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s an unpopular view to take here, but does anyone have an interesting perspective on it? If we were all transported to some nebulous &#8220;higher level&#8221; where we use all of our cognitive abilities, would the average black high school &#8220;graduate&#8221; STILL be unable to read, write, and do simple arithmetic?</p>

		<p>Professor X may fancy himself quite an intellect, and those in the education business may fancy themselves as even more sensitive, but the facts in the case, and the direction education, and indeed our country, have taken, is simply based on being able to use the words &#8216;racist&rsquo;, &#8216;bigot&rsquo; and &#8216;ignorant&rsquo;. Liberals may fancy themselves quite educated, but deep down this is what rules their &#8216;decisions&rsquo;, this fear. </p>
<p>You could argue that the very reason for our government, and the hierarchy at universities, is to protect citizens from this kind of bullying, so the truth can come out, or so folks can, &#8216;think what they like, and say what they think&rsquo;, or conversely, you could argue: we always need this fear, coming from a higher source, to keep us on the straight an narrow. Whichever it&rsquo;s right&hellip; what it&rsquo;s harder to argue is that this fear is moving us anywhere in the right direction.</p>
<p>Educators might defend themselves, surprise, surprise, by saying, the course is true because we are moving away from racism, but that&rsquo;s not true at all, and could only count in a society that doesn&rsquo;t really consider whites people, certainly not equal citizens. That&rsquo;s the only way it could work, because it designed to be as racist as possible towards whites. </p>

		<p>The situation is that we&rsquo;re all dealing with the fear of being called heretics, and the principal 20th century heresy is to state unpleasant truths about the I.Q. gap between blacks and whites, which actually does exist.</p>
<p>However, the Education Departments and almost all Liberal and Conservative &#8220;intellectuals&#8221;, just won&rsquo;t allow any delving into the truths that this web site is able to discuss. It reminds me of a scene from a play I once saw in Buenos Aires, Argentina, &#8220;Galileo, Galilei&#8221;, in which various priests are asked to look through the telescope to at least see for themselves whether the earth really does revolve around the sun -all refuse to even look. This is unfortunately the case with the intellectual hierarchy in the universities at present, since they not only refuse to even consider information about differences in average intellectual achievement among different racial groups, but they have various subtle, and not so subtle means, to enforce intellectual conformity in this regard. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t question the IQ differential between the races, but what effect do liberal policies have? Instead of telling the Black community, that their children have (thanks to the liberals) good education and good employment opportunities. So it is now up to them to take advantage of these benefits, the liberals constantly make excuses for Black non-performance. </p>
<p>This makes me wonder if the liberals really believe that races have equal intelligence or if liberals really want blacks to be successful workers, as opposed to being destructive parasites.</p>

<p>Some well-meaning white nationalists believe that people of all races are capable of doing better than they are doing now. They speculate that, if black and mestizos were more highly motivated, they would do better in school. They also believe that black and mestizo societies could be better managed, if the people of those societies had better cultural values. For example, the population of the nation of Barbados is over 80 percent black, the same as Detroit&rsquo;s black population. But Barbados is considered to be a tropical paradise, which attracts millions of white tourists from Europe and North America, every year. Detriot, on the other hand, is the worst city in America, and no white people want to go there. So, clearly, there are huge cultural differences that separate the blacks of Barbados from the blacks of Detroit.</p>
<p>Having said that, well-meaning white nationalists love white people because of the simple fact that they are white. They concede that the Japanese are more law-abiding than whites, but they do not want mass Japanese immigration in their countries, even if there is evidence that the Japanese could make their countries better. They simply want white societies to remain white. The unique white genotype is as worthy of preservation as the Eskimo, Zulu, Korean, Arab, or Native American genotype.</p>

		<p>Public schools who claim to be narrowing or eliminating the<br>
B-W achievement gap ( e.g., &#8220;Effective Schools&#8221; ) give much<br>
internal evidence of arriving at their &#8220;successes&#8221; by way of<br>
somewhat hidden manipulations and distortions.  These are fairly<br>
easily detectable to second and third tier administators in such systems  who themselves  have not been  making the decisons about such program implementation and who, accordingly, are not ego-invested in the success claims leading to the local adoption of t h i s    or   t h a t  panacea for ending the achievement gap.  The manipulations and deceptions that evolve under pressures to narrow or eliminate the gap can involve such &#8220;off stage&#8221; devices as that of  imperfectly implemented small group &#8220;cooperative learning&#8221; arrangements that amount to visiting impediments and neglect upon the abler members of the group.  Group achievement tests sometimes are tallied only after answer sheets have been disaggregated by having special education student answer sheets omitted from the overall tally.  There are a great many other such impacts that crop out when, if, a program is audited, as it were, by coldly<br>
objective scrutiny fed by healthy scepticism.  Again, I note it is the second and third tier administators who are especailly positioned to break through the delusion barriers into the obscured facts lurking  behind the appearances of success.  In urban situations where the stakes are high, I&rsquo;ve seldom found the ablest among such  administrators to be otherwise than quietly and covertly highly receptive to the &#8220;forbidden truths&#8221; from the works of such scientists as Art Jensen, Hans Eysenck, Chris Brand, and others. If one posits that the findings of &#8220;Jensenism&#8221; are scientifically valid, then the inner features in a school program that one would hypothesize to account for the claims of success are, in fact, the inner features that upon scrutiny are discovered.  I compiled an<br>
assortment of AR articles that were bound in plain paper cover and circulated &#8220;like wild fire&#8221; among such ranks.  One of the administrators remarked to me, &#8220;If we&rsquo;re caught up in promoting a Big Lie, career survival is best insured by knowing what the truths are.&#8221;          </p>

		<p>Stands to reason, if you have a certain number of potentially useable brain cells, and you are only ever capable of using, lets say 10% of these cells, the ones with a higher number of total cells is going to be able to utilize the greater number, given equal effort. Plus to a certain extent brain cells are the same as lets say muscle cells, and exercising them will increase their ability to function. Therefore it is certainly likely that someone who exercises one or the other more will have increased proficiency in that area. Thus that being said, it is absolutely true that a person with less of one or the other than someone else can excel above the person with more. This is more easily seen in muscular development, but can be readily seen in a classroom or in everday functions in the development of brain cells. Given a period of enough time those who lived in an environment where they did not have to use their brains much to survive ended up with far less brain cells, and conversely if they used their muscular cells to a greater extent they were able to run faster and jump higher, and vice versa.</p>

		<p>I think it is well known (even among Blacks) that the root cause of this black- non-black achievement gap is the innate gap in cognitive ability, but it is considered divisive and certainly impolite to mention it. However, it is literally <b>a matter of life &amp; death </b>that this cognitive gap be publicly discussed since, in light of the recent Supreme Court ruling that allows Black firefighters to sue for &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; on testing for firefighter promotions in Chicago. A similar &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; exists for police promotion tests throughout the country. Clearly it is of utmost importance to have the best &amp; brightest people trying to save lives and we can&rsquo;t afford political correctness in fire and police departments. </p>
<p>But if there is a public discussion &amp; understanding of this cognitive gap then the claim of disparate impact implying racial discrimination becomes untenable. As long as the subject matter of the tests is relevant it must be up only to the departments as what constitutes a valid test for competence &amp; promotions without these costly lawsuits. <br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m suprised the armed forces have not introduced enlistment essays of this sort already.  The Pentagon has made it clear they want to keep &#8220;racists&#8221; out, which is code for &#8220;white conservatives&#8221;; this will allow the desired successful conversion of the armed forces into a Soviet-style MVD organization for crushing domestic civil dissent.  Requiring a written essay and perhaps a long, multiple choice MMPI-like test would help recruiters weed out the &#8220;right&#8221; people, even if they don&rsquo;t have Confederate flag tattoos.</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;Some part of me still refuses to believe that blacks and Mesoamericans are really as dumb as they seem, or at least that it&rsquo;s because of hardwiring.</p>

<p>As a teacher, cognitive ability is only one of the factors needed for educational success (albeit a crucial one).  To succeed, one must also have focus, motivation, drive and foresight  &mdash;  the fortitude to sacrifice and defer pleasure (studying hard, not partying, using drugs or goofing-off) for bigger rewards in the future.  You must also love learning, be intellectually curious, have a desire to better yourself through self-reflection, and an ability to learn from your own mistakes and not blame others for your own shortcomings.</p>
<p>Motivation, focus, foresight, self-reflection, curiosity and drive cannot be taught  &mdash;  they are inherent in (k)-driven White DNA.  Those who lacked these qualities did not survive the last ice age in N. Europe.</p>
<p>It has been my overwhelming experience in the schools that the vast majority of blacks and hispanics do not have these traits.  They are lethargic in school, arrive late without materials, are hostile to authority, live in the here and now and are disinterested  &mdash;  if not downright hostile  &mdash;  to the educational process (to cover for their lack of cognitive abilities, I believe). </p>
<p>Many are entitlement-raised, believe they are victims of White Oppression and have a &#8216;you owe me&rsquo; mentality.  Why study hard when everything you need is handed to you by the government, including plush government jobs that Whites are locked out of?</p>
<p>I believe, for the most part, that education past a very rudimentary level, about the third grade, is wasted on most blacks and hispanics.</p>
