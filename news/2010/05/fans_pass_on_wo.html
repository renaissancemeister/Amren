<h1>Fans Pass on World Cup Tours</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Yomiuri Shimbun (Japan), May 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Demand for tour packages from Japan to the World Cup finals in South Africa is far lower than anticipated, with travel agencies blaming high prices, concerns about safety in the host country and tempered expectations about the national team&rsquo;s prospects. </p>
<p>Although the event is less than a month away, unsold packages are abundant. </p>
<p>Among the travel agencies certified by FIFA, the organizing body of the World Cup, JTB Corp., Nippon Travel Agency Co. and Kinki Nippon Tourist Co. had achieved only 50 percent of their sales quotas for tour packages as of Thursday. </p>
<p>Nishitetsu Travel Co. lowered its sales quota from 1,500 for the 2006 World Cup to 600 for this year&rsquo;s event, but still has sold only 70 percent of the latter.</p>
<p>Concern over security in South Africa has been identified as one contributor to the slow sales. According to local police, armed robberies are 28 times more frequent in South Africa than in Japan. </p>
<p>Packages for this year&rsquo;s event are more expensive than similar tours to the 2006 finals in Germany. Some packages for that event were sold for less than 300,000 yen, but the typical price for a South Africa tour is 400,000 yen to 500,000 yen, partly because of the longer and hence more expensive flight.</p>
<p>Poor performances of late by the national team have also dampened interest in the tours. Manager Takeshi Okada has said the team aims to reach the semifinals, but it suffered a disappointing 3-0 loss to Serbia last month.</p>
<p>Travel agencies are hoping sales will get a boost if Japan prevails in its May 24 home match against South Korea, the team&rsquo;s last domestic outing before the World Cup. </p>
<p>&#8220;I hope the team will win and make people feel like going to see them play in South Africa,&#8221; a Kinki Nippon Tourist employee said. </p>
<p>&#8216;Most dangerous city in world&rsquo;</p>
<p>Johannesburg, the primary host city and site of the tournament&rsquo;s final match, has been dubbed the most dangerous city in the world. Public security is also poor in other cities scheduled to host matches. </p>
<p>The Foreign Ministry has warned visitors to Johannesburg, Pretoria, Cape Town and Durban during the event to be especially cautious.</p>
<p>According to an official Web site of the South African police, nearly 2.1 million crimes were recorded in the nation in fiscal 2008.</p>
<p>About 30 percent were cases of murder, assault causing injury, or robbery. </p>
<p>There were about 18,000 murders, and about 121,000 armed robberies. Sixty percent of armed robberies occurred on public streets.</p>
<p>Although South Africa&rsquo;s population is one-third of Japan&rsquo;s, it is plagued by 14 times more murders and 28 times more armed robberies. </p>
<p>Many areas are regarded as too dangerous to walk through alone at night.</p>
<p>According to the ministry&rsquo;s Japanese Nationals Overseas Safety Division, many robberies are &#8220;smash and grab&#8221; attacks, in which thieves approach a stationary car at an intersection, shatter the front passenger window and snatch valuables from inside the vehicle.</p>
<p>Travel agencies have warned customers traveling to South Africa to avoid displaying their wallets when out at night. </p>
<p>&#8220;Our customers are not yet sufficiently aware of the security problems [in South Africa]. I&rsquo;m anxious because not many customers have asked us about the situation,&#8221; a Nishitetsu Travel Co. employee said.<br>

		<p>If you think that the media did a good job of covering up the total breakdown of society during Katrina, just tune into the coverage of the upcoming World Cup.  If any foreigners actually go to South Africa that is.  I predict half empty stadiums with breathless commentators making excuses.</p>

		<p>What were these soccer-dolts thinking, putting the World Cup ANYWHERE in Africa???  Now that simply epitomizes &#8220;dumb&hellip;&#8221;  Ha, ha, last night in a local restaurant I won a $25 wash, cut and blowdry at a nearby salon for correctly answering the question, &#8220;Which continent (Antarctica excluded) has never hosted a world cup soccer event?&#8221;  I hollered out &#8220;AFRICA!!&#8221; and all the Mexican dudes at the next table looked daggers at me.  I guess they wanted the prize for their girlfriends.  So I took my prize home and promptly sold it to a neighbor.  Hip, hip, AFRICAYYYY!!!</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a thought: why don&rsquo;t all the anti-apartheid activists from the USA and Europe show their support for the new rainbow nation by buying up outstanding tickets for the World Cup Finals? Then they can experience the cultural enrichment of the new SA by strolling the streets at night. There can even be special ticket packages called the Amy Biehl Tours. </p>
<p><i>I predict half empty stadiums with breathless commentators making excuses.</i></p>
<p>And the failure of the World Cup Finals will be blamed on  &mdash;  apartheid!</p>

		<p> Japanese are not stupid.  Like other East Asians, they are<br>
very racially realistic regarding Africans or people of African descent`s propensity for<br>
crime,chaos, and disorder wherever they settle in considerable<br>
numbers.  As an aside one of the biggest stories in Japan is<br>
the question of shifting US bases from Okinawa to other parts of Japan,  The people of a an island close to Okinawa which have been recommended to host some of the US bases are deeply opposed to it,<br>
if you scratch beneath the surface the real reason they don&rsquo;t want US Marines (which include a considerable number of African Americans) there is because of all the crime and social problems they bring.(Not meaning to slander the other law abiding marines  but that&rsquo;s how they are viewed overall)  <br>
  The rape of a young schoolgirl by three African American marines several years ago amongst numerous other crimes,many unreported,have definitely not been forgottten by Okinawans and many mainland Japanese&hellip; if you have a fluency in the language and can converse with the common folk  its amazing what you can learn that wont be printed in the evening newspaper.  <br>

<p>Imagine that!</p>
<p>The Japanese government and media looking out for the Japanese people by informing and warning them of the dangers of SA.</p>
<p>It will be a cold day in **** before the anti-White American media warn White Americans of the dangers of SA.  White lives are worthless in the eyes on the media as they refuse to publish stories of black-on-White murders, hackings, slashings, tortures IN THE US.  Yet a White kid makes a stupid comment in Wal-Marx and it&rsquo;s national news for days on end.</p>
<p>Cancel any/all subscriptions to lefty newspapers that refuse to print heinous black-on-White crimes and/or continue to champion illegal immigration and others who &#8216;don&rsquo;t look like you.&rsquo;  They do not serve your interests and refuse to warn you about the dangers of criminal blacks.</p>

		<p>In regards to my previous post I would like to add as someone with some knowledge of the Japanese tourism system many Japanese tour companies fear being held liable if any of their esteemed, `valued` guests are victims of crime in South Africa&hellip;<br>
.Apart from the massive financial compensation, the stigma of having to accept full responsibility for the inevitable muggings,beatings and possible<br>
murders, means that tour companies are probably reluctant to<br>
promote World Cup packages to their Japanese clients without<br>
adequate warnings which probably have scared off many Japanese anyway.<br>
  This is I believe a much more telling factor than<br>
the national teams poor performance or so called èxpensive`<br>
flights/tour packages      </p>

		<p>OCCAM, Australia is regarded as a country first, an island second, and a continent third. No matter if it hasn&rsquo;t hosted a World Cup before. All the other continents on planet Earth (save for Antarctica) are made up of several countries. Australia is a single nation. So DixieProud is technically correct. </p>

<p>   If Japan no longer needs our protection (and I don&rsquo;t think they do), why shouldn&rsquo;t our troops leave Japan? I can&rsquo;t understand why we have troops in Japan to supposedly protect them from China, and yet where do we get the money to pay for it  &mdash;  we borrow the money from China!</p>

		<p>Thank you, Soprano Fan!  I may be wrong, but I thought New Zealand and some other islands were included in the continent of Australia.  Of course, I also thought that the Aussies HAD hosted a world cup soccer event, so on that I was wrong.  But I agree that Africa is the only contiguous continent never to have hosted a W.C.S.E., and, happily, the guy giving out the prizes thought so too!</p>

		<p>DixieProud, New Zealand is a separate and independent nation, not part of Australia. The small island of Tasmania IS a part of Australia. There are some tiny islands in the Pacific that are administered by Australia, like Lord Howe Island.</p>
<p>To Mrk in L.A. - I don&rsquo;t know why NATO hasn&rsquo;t been disbanded, since the primary reason for its creation - the Soviet threat - no longer exists. NATO is not even being used to protect our shipping near Somalia, for crying out loud.</p>
<p>If the USA wanted to save billions of dollars, it could start by withdrawing from NATO.  But that&rsquo;s easier said than done, because we are still guided by post World War II foreign policy that makes us allies of the British and Western Europe, for better or worse.</p>

		<p>New Zealand is not geologically a part of the Australian continent.  Tasmania, however is (the Bass Straight is so shallow that during the last ice age it was dry land, and allowed Aboriginees to walk to what is now Tasmania).</p>
<p>New Zealand had the option of joining Australia, but they were a bit snobbish since theirs had been a colony of voluntary migration, while Australia got its start as a penal colony (after the American revolution broke out, the British were no longer able to send convicts to Georgia, as they had been earlier doing).</p>

<p>  Honestly, I don&rsquo;t. Our government claims we are there to protect the Japanese, but it is actually to support our military industrial complex and an overseas United States Empire. The public needs to be aware of this and demand that we withdraw to America proper. </p>

		<p>The question of Australia is an interesting one. <br>
So I looked it up.   Generally, it is regarded as a large island, or sometimes as part of &#8220;Oceania&#8221;.  That&rsquo;s alright to include New Zealand because Asia includes Japan, and Europe includes the British Isles. There is no listing of Australia alone. So Dixie &amp; Soprano are right.<br>
