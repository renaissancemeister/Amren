<h1>McCain, Kyl Demand Top Obama State Dept. Official Retract Statement and Apologize for Likening AZ Immigration Law to Chinese Human Rights Violations</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Susan Jones and Pete Winn, CNS News, May 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) Tuesday called on the top Obama State Department official responsible for human rights issues to &#8220;retract and apologize&#8221; for telling officials of the Communist government of China that Arizona&rsquo;s new immigration-enforcement law is an example of a &#8220;troubling trend in our society&#8221; and for portraying Arizona as the moral equivalent of Communist China. <br>
 <br>
In a <a href="https://mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Files.View&amp;FileStore_id=44f25afc-5e9c-4293-beac-e878c93cf980">letter</a> to Assistant Secretary of State Michael Posner, the senators said that he &#8220;seemed to imply&#8221; during the recent U.S.-China Human Rights Dialogue that Arizona&rsquo;s law &#8220;is morally equivalent to China&rsquo;s persistent pattern of abuse and repression of its people.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
McCain and Kyl told Posner his comments were &#8220;particularly offensive&#8221; because he heads the State Department&rsquo;s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor.<br>
 <br>
&#8220;We demand that you retract your statement and issue an apology,&#8221; they wrote.<br>
 <br>
{snip}</p>
<p>Asked by a reporter if the Arizona law came up in the discussions, Posner said it did  &mdash;  and it was U.S. officials, not the Chinese, who brought it up.<br>
 <br>
&#8220;We brought it up early and often,&#8221; Posner told reporters last Friday. &#8220;It was mentioned in the first session, and as a troubling trend in our society and an indication that we have to deal with issues of discrimination or potential discrimination, and that these are issues very much being debated in our own society,&#8221; Posner said. The Chinese did not raise any concerns about Chinese people visiting Arizona, Posner added.<br>
 <br>
During the press briefing, Posner explained that &#8220;part of a mature relationship is that you have an open discussion where you not only raise the other guy&rsquo;s problems, but you raise your own, and you have a discussion about it. We did plenty of that. We had experts from the U.S. side, for example, yesterday, talking about treatment of Muslim Americans in an immigration context. We had a discussion of racial discrimination. We had a back-and-forth about how each of our societies are dealing with those sorts of questions.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
Posner characterized the discussions as a give-and-take: &#8220;I think the tone of the discussions was very much not &#8216;We&rsquo;ve got all the answers; we&rsquo;re telling the Chinese how to behave.&rsquo; It was framed in an international context, international standards. We&rsquo;re both obligated. And let&rsquo;s talk about things that we&rsquo;re both dealing with, and try to figure out  &mdash;  can we help each other? And where we have differences, how do we mitigate those differences?&#8221;</p>

								<h2>No Breakthroughs in US, China Human Rights Talks</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Foster Klug, Yahoo News, May 14, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>The United States and China reported no major breakthroughs Friday after only their second round of talks about human rights since 2002.</p>
<p>The Obama administration wants to push Beijing to treat its citizens better, but it also needs Chinese support on Iranian and North Korean nuclear standoffs, climate change and other difficult issues.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Michael Posner, the assistant secretary of state, told reporters that another round will happen some time next year in Beijing. The countries also plan to hold talks on legal matters soon and he said he will participate in a high-profile economic and security summit in Beijing this month.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Posner said in addition to talks on freedom of religion and expression, labor rights and rule of law, officials also discussed Chinese complaints about problems with U.S. human rights, which have included crime, poverty, homelessness and racial discrimination.</p>
<p>He said U.S. officials did not whitewash the American record and in fact raised on its own a new immigration law in Arizona that requires police to ask about a person&rsquo;s immigration status if there is suspicion the person is in the country illegally.</p>

<p>It sounds like all give and no take.  Having dealt with Chinese and experienced their shrewd ways, I think they will write the Obama administration off as weak. </p>

		<p>Why do we assume that Posner is telling the truth?  I bet you a dollar to a doughnut that:  (1) The Chinese didn&rsquo;t bring up homelessness, racism, treatment of Arabs (hint: Uhigirs), Arizona&rsquo;s SB 1070 or anything Posner claims they did.  Beijing doesn&rsquo;t give a rat&rsquo;s tail about any of those things.  (2) That any American in the State Department would dare lecture China about human rights when they&rsquo;ve been the sugar daddy for BushObama profligate spending.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think human rights were discussed at all.</p>

		<p>And here we have yet another example of the insane foreign policy that characterizes the B.O. administration.  He and his fellow marxists are determined to destroy this nation with their words as well as by their actions, and turn it into a socialist nonentity.  My personal opinion is that all of them should be tried and shot for treason.</p>

		<p>McCain is pretty shameless in trying to capitalize on this as a way of garnering some fast publicity in his campaign to reinvent himself. He&rsquo;s just trying to flim-flam the public into forgetting his shabby record by sounding tough. What more do people like him, Pelosi, and all the rest want from us, haven&rsquo;t they cashed in enough from all these many years of being in government? In 1653 Oliver Cromwell lambasted Parliament, saying &#8221; &hellip; you were deputed here by the people to get grievances redressed, are yourselves become the greatest grievance&hellip;..In the name of God,go!&#8221;. He then  dismissed all of them. Something like this is long overdue to clean out the stable.     </p>

<p>Are they serious?  Haha oh wow, I just gained a lot of respect for the Chinese.  They only have one race problem as far as I know, it&rsquo;s with the Uighurs and it ends in violence when they get too uppity.  And they have the stones to complain about U.S. human rights and have our officials take them seriously?  Hilarious.</p>

<p>I hardly think China is in any position to talk to the USA on &#8220;racial discrimination&#8221;. China is about 95% Han Chinese and they have very few Blacks, no Mexicans or whatever so no understanding. China doesn&rsquo;t allow immigration of other races and certainly doesn&rsquo;t give them equal rights.<br>

<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t everyone mind their own business. China should be left alone to do its&rsquo; own thing and the Chinese have no understanding of American issues. So both should butt out on this.<br>

		<p>J.D. Hayworth (McCain&rsquo;s Republican primary opponent) must have McCain scared.  All of the sudden McCain pretends to be in favor of enforcing immigration law.  There&rsquo;s a video he put out where he says they should &#8220;build the dang fence!&#8221;.  That&rsquo;s the fence that McCain voted against.  The same McCain that teamed up with Ted Kennedy for an illegal alien amnesty.  The same McCain that said, &#8220;Americans wouldn&rsquo;t pick lettuce if it paid $50 an hour!&#8221;.  McCain&rsquo;s opposition to illegal immigration will end the day he is reelected as senator.</p>
