<h1>Cop-Watchers Look for Racial Profiling on the Streets of Phoenix</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Emanuella Grinberg, CNN, May 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Margarito Blanco trains his camcorder on the officer approaching a Chevy pickup, while his friend Andrew Sanchez furiously scribbles notes on a pad.</p>
<p>They are not working for the police. They&rsquo;re watching them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about 8:10 p.m. on a recent Thursday and the turquoise S-10 is pulled over at a Circle K gas station in Phoenix.</p>
<p>Anywhere else in the United States, this might appear to be nothing more than a routine traffic stop. But Phoenix is ground zero in the battle over illegal immigration, and to Blanco and Sanchez the stop represents a potential opportunity to catch a member of the Maricopa County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office in the act of racial profiling.</p>
<p>CNN accompanied the pair as they cruised around Phoenix looking for traffic stops to document on the Thursday after Gov. Jan Brewer signed what&rsquo;s being called the nation&rsquo;s toughest anti-immigration enforcement law, SB 1070.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In response to concerns that the law encourages police to racially profile, Brewer and the legislature amended it to specify that police can stop suspected illegal immigrants only while enforcing another law or ordinance.</p>
<p>Sanchez, an American-born community activist from the Arizona town of Guadalupe, began engaging in reverse police surveillance a year ago.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since 2008, the Maricopa County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office has staged 15 street patrol operations targeting areas suspected to have high concentrations of crime related to illegal immigration. Arpaio himself announces each operation with a press release and news conference a few hours before deputies and so-called &#8220;posse volunteers&#8221; take to the streets.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The traffic stop CNN witnessed with Sanchez was part of an operation focusing on the west Phoenix community of Maryvale. Arpaio describes the area as a hub for drop houses used by human traffickers that&rsquo;s also a crossroads of transportation routes to move illegal immigrants throughout Arizona and beyond its borders.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sanchez, who has himself been arrested in what he says was a case of racial profiling, has garnered his fair share of publicity in Arizona as a community activist and cop-watcher. His family&rsquo;s claim that the sheriff&rsquo;s department has retaliated against them for their activism was the subject of a 2009 cover story in the alternative newspaper Phoenix New Times.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As soon as an operation is announced, the cop-watchers head somewhere with a Wifi connection  &mdash;  a home or Starbucks  &mdash;  to monitor police scanners. They send text messages of the locations of stops to others who, like Sanchez, cruise the area. They usually travel in pairs and try to reach the stop while it is in progress so they can record it and document it.</p>
<p>On the night CNN accompanied them, Sanchez and his partner pulled into the Circle K just as the deputy, sporting a crew cut and bulletproof vest, took the man&rsquo;s license to his partner inside the vehicle and conferred with him. A few moments later, he brought the license back to the driver, returned to his patrol SUV and drove away.</p>
<p>As the driver pulled the pickup to a gas pump, Sanchez and Blanco walked over and peppered him with questions: Why did they stop you? What did they say? Did they give you a ticket?</p>
<p>The driver said the officer initially spoke to him in Spanish, telling him he was pulled over because the temporary tag affixed to the truck&rsquo;s cab window was not properly illuminated.</p>
<p>As the man rattled off details, Sanchez nodded, interpreting the incident as an example of racial profiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the fact that he started speaking to him in Spanish shows that he approached him with a certain idea in mind of who he was,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Also, there are hundreds of people driving around with temporary license plates. If this guy were in another part of town, he wouldn&rsquo;t be pulled over.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the Maricopa County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office sees it another way. The temporary tag was not visible in the back of the cab, so the deputy felt obligated to pull the driver over to verify it, a sheriff&rsquo;s spokesman said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The deputy did not even notice what the driver looked like until he pulled him over, Lee said, noting that the officer had a hard time remembering the incident from the many other car stops he made that night.</p>
<p>The deputy did recall, however, that the driver had an outstanding felony warrant from another state, Lee said. The details of the warrant were not available to the deputy because it was not an extraditable offense, and so the officer decided to let the man go.</p>
<p>&#8220;The guy seemed a little bit nervous and he thought it was because he had a felony warrant but it was not an extraditable offense,&#8221; Lee said. &#8220;Obviously if the deputy gets information that a guy has a warrant then his level of awareness goes up a bit.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Policing the police?  How noble.  These people seriously need to get a life or more productive hobby.  I wonder how Mr. Sanchez would like it if I followed him to work each day, watching him make snow cones or whatever lame job he has that affords him so much free-time.  </p>
<p>What worries me most is:  What happens when Mr. Sanchez gets in the line-of-fire and catches a stray bullet.  Somehow, it&rsquo;ll be the fault of the police and his family will win some insane amount of money from the tax-payers.</p>
<p>This country is out of control.  When the Whites leave the USA, will these leeches continue to follow us?  Seems they can&rsquo;t survive on their own, and would surely need another host for survival.</p>

		<p>SB 1070 applies all over Arizona.  So why are these professional cop watchers only watching Maricopa County Sheriff&rsquo;s Deputies?  Why not City of Phoenix P.D. officers?  Or any city police or county sheriff&rsquo;s department in AZ, much less the State DPS Officers?  Answer:  Joe Arpaio.</p>
<p>If we had an FBI we could be proud of, they would get their forensic accountants to work, to sift through what I think is surely a long money laundering process that has this &#8220;cop watcher&#8221; milieu on one end, and Hispanic drug gangs on the other end.</p>

		<p>Of course there are going to be whiners like these who watch the cops and hope desperately to catch them in a mistake.  My God, do they have nothing better to do with their time than tail the police?  How pathetic.  Police are human, and with being human comes error.  But, in the vast majority of cases, the actions will be legitimate, and these sorry &#8220;activists&#8221; are going to go home empty-handed.</p>

		<p>Reminds me of a cartoon years ago by Stein (?) featuring a little boy walking hand-in-hand with his father and asking &#8220;Daddy, what&rsquo;s the difference between racial profiling and affirmative action?&#8221;</p>
<p>Years ago when I worked at the Social Security Administration an Hispanic man had a full-time executive-level job finding ways for SSA to hire more Hispanics.  He gave lectures to employees on how important and necessary it was to have more Hispanics in the Government for the sake of &#8220;diversity.&#8221; </p>
<p>In the question period after one of his speeches extolling the virtues of Hispanics I observed that, if a white person touted the white race the way he praised Hispanics, the white would be called &#8220;racist&#8221;; why should his group get special treatment?</p>
<p>I got glares and frowns from the audience (mostly women) and a reply to the effect that &#8220;we&rsquo;re here and we&rsquo;re not going away,&#8221; for which he received loud and lengthy applause.  I raised my hand several times after that and was ignored by the speaker, but a large, muscular black man came and stood by my side.</p>
<p>The Russians called people like this COMMISSARS, didn&rsquo;t they?  And, yes, at SSA employees had to be approved by WORKERS&rsquo; COUNCILS before they could be promoted.  Russians called workers&rsquo; councils SOVIETS.  WAKE UP, AMERICA!!</p>
<p>A slick, glossy Hispanic Yearbook was published, flush with many full-page, full-color advertisements from U.S. Government agencies, including the U.S. Marine Corps, all saying how much they wanted Hispanics. </p>
<p>Hispanic employees had an Hispanic Affairs Advisory Council to represent them before management at SSA, as did blacks, but whites were forbidden to have a corresponding organization.  Hispanic organizations in Government had an annual convention under Government sponsorship in nearby Crystal City, VA and employees were given time off to attend.</p>
<p>When I exposed this on the front page of the Washington Times newspaper I received a police escort out of the building and out of my job.  It was then I learned that, the 14th Amendment to the contrary not withstanding, because I am a white man the law does not protect me from racial discrimination because the group to which I belong - - white males - - is not &#8220;protected&#8221; under administrative law of the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>Messrs. Blanco and Sanchez and their allies are in favor of selective enforcement of the laws, and they are socking white folks like a pinata. </p>
<p>Do they have full-time jobs?  How do they support themselves while they do this extra work?  Who pays for Sanchez&rsquo; &#8220;community activism&#8221;?</p>

<p>And so it goes, and how laughably so&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;?</p>
<p>Honestly, if any questions about a Comrade Sanchez are in dispute, this country should act on the side of caution. Which means, Comrade Sanchez needs to be in the guacamole and then blended with a salsa. I cannot think of a better place for an alien criminal invader, and &ldquo;community activist and cop-watcher,&rdquo; to be transformed or &ldquo;folded&rdquo; into.</p>

		<p>Felony warrant?  And they let him go? Hmmm&hellip;.</p>
<p>They could just do mass traffic stops like they do for drunk driving.  Just stop everybody on a particular road.  You get stopped because you are driving down route such and such and have to show the police your documents.  No profiling there.  Pain in the behind but what can you do if you want to avoid profiling charges.</p>

As with all &#8216;civil&rsquo; and &#8216;human rights&rsquo; actions, these people will either provoke the police or set-up a narrowly defined scenario that will be used to throw enforcement into chaos.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll likely enlist a natural-born American-Hispanic and make him look like an illegal and prance him around until the police &#8216;harass&rsquo; him to prove the law is a useless form of profiling. </p>

		<p>These two vigilantes apparently are using their efforts against the (usually) imaginary crime of &#8220;racial profiling&#8221;.  You would think that this was a crime greater then rape or child molestation.  Just think if they allowed the police to do their jobs and capture and deport illegal aliens, how much would &#8220;real&#8221; crime go down in Arizona and everywhere this cancer has infested itself.</p>

		<p>This is actually a good thing.  Whites are discovering (in great numbers and reflected in important institutions like state governments) that they must look out for their interests racially to avoid heinous crimes where they live.  They are still adamant about doing so the conservative way.  In other words, creating and applying laws designed to be fair and honest, ignore the race of the person and focus on their behavior.  That doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t work because non-whites only care about race, not about behavior.  They literally want to be free to do as they please (and they please to victimize whites) while whites are ultra-restricted in their legitimate freedoms.  More and more, whites are waking up to this&hellip;.as they experience both things&hellip;.heinous crimes they are not protected from and serious discrimination and oppression.  As our awareness goes up, our tolerance goes down and suddenly you have laws like what is in arizona.  It&rsquo;s not enough but it is a start.</p>
<p>The next stage is non-whites doing everything they can to strike down the law by applying unreasonable standards to it.  They will eventually find a single case of racial profiling and demand the law be struck down over it.  But here is the rub&hellip;..will the people of arizona comply?  Or will they tell mexicans that it doesn&rsquo;t matter and they better get out of their state.  In other words, will they graduate from adhering to the letter of the law (while non-whites ignore the law) to demanding what is in their own best self interests despite what anyone has to say about it.  And by anybody, I mean, corrupt federal courts, an even more corrupt supreme court and our federal government.</p>
<p>I think this is a real possibility.  And will cause a tsunami of similar sentiment once the first is displayed.  And there is nothing these people can do about it.  Everything they do, everything they are, depends on our willingness to cooperate. They have no power of their own.</p>

		<p>If someone would start an watchdog group that identified buisnesses that hired illegal aliens, and then recommend to the public that those buisnesses shouldnt be patronized, then that could have an effect on how many illegals are hired.And none of the illegal alien sympathizers, government or private, could do a thing to stop them.</p>

		<p>In reply to #10, Itsvan:</p>
<p>Of course everyone knows they exist. What I did wrong was to CALL it racial discrimination and to say it was both illegal and immoral.  You&rsquo;re not allowed to do that.  Not for long, anyway. </p>
<p>I was suspended for three days without pay for simply asking to discuss the front page story with my supervisor, a black woman.  When I appealed the suspension they told me I had offended her, hurt her feelings and she had to be protected from that.</p>
<p>Itsvan, racial discrimination is prohibited by both the 14th Amendment to the Constitution and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Please call your Congressman and Senators and ask them why they permit the law of the land to be flouted by flagrant racial discrimination.  </p>
<p>And then please report back to this site.  Your response will edify us all.  </p>

<p>In 1997, a white employee of the Social Security Administration named Frank Keliher asked permission to form a White Affairs Advisory Council, modeled on the Black Affairs Advisory Council, which was established years ago. He was turned down. When the Washington Times ran a story about this the Social Security Administration grudgingly gave permission to form a white group. When Mr. Keliher put up signs advertising it, blacks tore them down. Although Mr. Keliher named them in a complaint, the administration did not discipline the blacks, and instead said signs angering employees would not be permitted. </p>
<p>Mr. Keliher then asked if he could invite a speaker  &mdash;  AR editor Jared Taylor  &mdash;  to address employees. Patricia Carey, Acting Director of the Office of Management wrote back, explaining the prior decision about posting notices, and also ruling on whether Mr. Keliher could invite a speaker: </p>
<p>&ldquo;[Y]our prior request was denied, consistent with Agency guidelines on employee communications, because we determined that continued posting of that notice could potentially not be in the best interests of safety and the working environment. [Emphasis added] Based on the information currently available to us, your request to invite this speaker poses similar concerns and therefore must be denied.&rdquo; In other words, anything that makes blacks angry  &mdash;  whether posting notices or inviting speakers  &mdash;  is a threat to workplace safety and must be forbidden. <br>

<p>&hellip;.<i>The times they are a changing</i> so fast these days, 1997 was a different time to now for sure. <br>
Just look at the strange changes in attitudes from 9/11 to now, who would&rsquo;ve guessed half of the stuff that has, and is going down?<br>
Looks like Mr Keliher was a pioneer of sorts.</p>

		<p>What would really be funny&hellip; if the Phoenix cops made a point of studiously watching ALL Latinos&hellip; but not say or do anything without justified cause&hellip; Just make the illegals uncomfortable as hell by the illegals realizing they&rsquo;re being watched!</p>
<p>I heard from a close friend, who&rsquo;s daughter and son-in-law are Phoenix residents&hellip; That the wife is thinking of quitting her job. Because of the crimes which are a daily occurrence&hellip; crimes committed, of course, by illegals. Cars broken into on the parking lot where the daughter works. Despite guards on the premises. Women having handbags snatched by illegals. Muggings, burglaries, break-ins everywhere.</p>
