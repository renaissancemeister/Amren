<h1><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE64Q6BP20100527">Toll From Jamaica Violence Climbs to 73</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Horace Helps, Reuters, May 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At least 73 people died this week as Jamaican security forces stormed a Kingston slum and battled armed supporters of an alleged drug lord wanted for extradition to the United States, police said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Residents complained of abuse and rights groups questioned whether police and soldiers had used excessive and indiscriminate force.</p>
<p>Most deaths occurred during an assault by police and army troops on Tivoli Gardens, a volatile Kingston slum and bastion of support for suspected drug kingpin Christopher &#8216;Dudus&rsquo; Coke, Deputy Police Commissioner Glenmore Hinds told reporters.</p>
<p>Coke was still at large. Tension gripped the upper middle class community of Kirkland Heights early on Thursday when word came that he was hiding there in a house owned by a friend.</p>
<p>Police stormed the area and a two-hour firefight broke out. Keith Clarke, the 58-year-old brother of former Minister of Industry and Commerce Claude Clarke, was killed by security personnel, apparently caught in the crossfire.</p>
<p>The violence in the capital started on Sunday as Coke&rsquo;s supporters torched police stations to protest his potential extradition to the United States. He was indicted last year in New York on drug trafficking and gunrunning charges.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Bruce Golding declared a state of emergency, giving security forces broad powers to restrict freedom of movement, search premises and detain suspects without warrants.</p>
<p>Four of the dead were police and soldiers. The rest were civilians, mostly young men.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many people said they were hungry and had not been allowed to leave their homes to buy food. Others were angry at the prime minister, who is also their member of Parliament.</p>

		<p>A lot of people are making too much of the gun issue.  While I think it would be better for Jamaica not to have all the gun control laws that it has, that&rsquo;s not the reason why it&rsquo;s in the fix that it&rsquo;s in.  The reason is that it&rsquo;s almost all black.  Besides, those laws are rarely enforced, except on the occasional white tourist who happens to have a bullet in his luggage, so guns and ammo might as well be legal for natives.</p>
<p>Now for my main point.  Any person with at least a room temperature IQ who studies Jamaica understands that the operations of a legitimate political party and an allied drug gang are so intertwined that it&rsquo;s impossible to tell where one ends and the other begins.  So this begs the question  &mdash;  Why is apprehending the drug lord in question so important to the American government that it would stick its fist in a hive full of wasps?  If you don&rsquo;t want drugs coming out of Jamaica, it&rsquo;s easy  &mdash;  It&rsquo;s an island.  Just use the Navy to blockade the island.  But if you start messing around internally, you&rsquo;re going to cause nothing but trouble.  As this article states, 73 have already died.  And should Mr. Duds Coke be apprehended?  It&rsquo;s going to open up a big power vacuum within his politicalpartydruggang, which won&rsquo;t be resolved without a lot of shooting, violence and dead bodies.</p>

		<p>My girlfriend suggested a trip to Jamaica, because the vacation packages offerred were so attractive a couple, three years ago.</p>
<p>After I finished pulling up information from the web on Jamaica and letting her read it, she wouldn&rsquo;t go near the place after that if they offerred free trips.</p>
<p>Is there one black nation on earth that isn&rsquo;t a total disaster?</p>
<p>Of course there isn&rsquo;t, and what&rsquo;s the reason for it?  Slavery?  White oppression?  White racism?  And I&rsquo;m including Africa as well.</p>

		<p>Jamaica has one of the highest homicide rates of any nation, along with Colombia and South Africa. That notwithstanding, I agree with Question Diversity as to why this country must feel the need to play narco cop by going after every international drug dealer on the planet. All it&rsquo;s going to do is increase the animosity some nations have for the U.S.</p>
<p>On a sidebar, I saw on Yahoo News, that the USA is considering a unilateral military strike against Pakistan, if al-Qaeda commits a terrorist act against us. According to this article, The U.S. has given Pakistan a matter of weeks to show that a crackdown against al-Qaeda is effective. This must be the &#8220;hope and change&#8221; the Obama regime promised.</p>
<p>So much for the &#8220;prestige&#8221; of the Nobel Peace prize.<br/>

		<p>I recently saw the original James Bond &#8220;Dr. No&#8221; film which was  shot in Jamaica in 1962. In the film the British High Commisioner is white. In the background of the action scenes   you can see the roads are well kept, the houses neat and modest and the hillsides are green. After 50 years of black rule the whites have fled, the roads are dirt, the houses are shanties of cardboard and tin, and the hillsides washed away from erosion. <br/>

		<p>Unfortunately, I have to go to a wedding in Jamaica this weekend.  It&rsquo;s at a resort with a private beach, so maybe I&rsquo;ll be insulated from the third-worldness.  It will be my first trip to a black country.  Not looking forward to it.  I&rsquo;m not eating salad because of a TV show about parasites I recently saw.  They don&rsquo;t really wash the lettuce there since they have a third-world understanding of sanitation, and snails that host rat-lung worm larvae get chopped up with your salad.  The worms eventually eat your brain.</p>

No vacation there, no matter how great the &#8220;bargain&#8221;, is worth it. I have a friend, a professional black woman, who took a cruise, stopping at Jamaica.  She came back, saying that one time was enough and that she would never go there again.<br/>
Well, that&rsquo;s good enough for me. If she wouldn&rsquo;t want to, then I wouldn&rsquo;t want to either. </p>

		<p>I still remember the TV ads of the &rsquo;80s in which a black man with a thick Jamaican accent says &#8220;Come bock to Jamaica! Make eet Jamaica&hellip;and make eet your &#8216;OME!&#8221; I don&rsquo;t hear so much from the Jamaican travel industry these days. It&rsquo;s funny how the fewer in number whites are in a black area or country, the worse the effects of &#8220;racism&#8221; become!</p>

		<p>The Clash wrote a song about vacationing in Jamaica in 1979.  The song made it clear that they were never going back there again and wanted to be back in their &#8220;Safe European Home.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Anonymous #9, I just had to Youtube it, and then look up the lyrics for &#8220;Safe European Home&#8221; (a title which, in itself, would qualify as a Hate Crime in today&rsquo;s Europe):<br/>
&#8220;I went to a place, where every white face, is an invitation to robbery&hellip;&#8221;  That&rsquo;s the gist of the song&hellip;and of Jamaica.  When Mississippi Magazine&rsquo;s Wedding Issue has a writeup telling us that a couple honeymooned in Jamaica, we all go &#8220;mmmm-hmmmm&hellip;either stoners or swingers&hellip;knew those were bad kids&hellip;&#8221; Jamaica, today, is strictly for bottom-feeders.</p>
<p>And thirty years later, Europe is being transformed into something similar to the hell-for-whites The Clash described.</p>
<p>A mainstream, radio-friendly band would never have said something honest about black behavior, even back then.  My group listened to Punk/Alternative bands precisely because the punk bands did not idolize black culture, and their singers did not imitate black mispronunciations. The mainstream bands all sounded as black as possible, and it was so cornball.</p>
<p>Today, if that nauseating schmalz bucket of a song, &#8220;Walkin&rsquo; in Memphis&#8221; comes on, while I&rsquo;m trying to shop, I stop and just leave.  That&rsquo;s rude, but I don&rsquo;t want it in my head.  And anything where someone is crooning about &#8220;beh beh&hellip;yo bah-deh&hellip;&#8221; is likely to get the same reaction.</p>
<p>Thanks for some musical antivenin, to erase a bit of the ear poison I&rsquo;ve been subjected to!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not only here. It&rsquo;s everywhere!   You can&rsquo;t get away.  If you go shopping in Paris, or sit in a restaurant, your ears will be assaulted by a stream of endless black American songs   &mdash;   in English!   &mdash;   probably 4/5ths of them by American blacks, and the 5th song may be in French. </p>
<p>Ditto in Amsterdam . Ditto in Frankfurt, etc.   I spent Christmas a couple of years ago in Nuremberg,  wanting to experience a typical German Christmas.  The hotel played nothing but West Indian rap music in the lobby endlessly.  No Christmas music!!!  No carols!  As WiFi only worked in the lobby, I had to use my computer there, and I actually had to wear earmuffs to muffle the rap noise.</p>
<p>I was on a bus in France (on the Riviera, near Monaco) and the driver, a  young white man, was playing American rap music,  and very loudly. Apparently he thought he was entertaining us.  The words were extremely filthy (and anti-social, talking about shooting people), and I don&rsquo;t think he had any idea what they meant. It was really embarrassing, as there were a number of English people on the bus too.  This  so-called &#8220;black art form&#8221; from America is considered fashionable abroad today, among those who want to be trendy. To an American, it&rsquo;s an embarrassment.   </p>

		<p>No problem, Lauren.  That&rsquo;s a great song, isn&rsquo;t it?  Apparently the two principal songwriters of the Clash went to Jamaica as a getaway to write songs, and were robbed at gunpoint while they they were, and they wrote one of their best songs about the experience.  </p>

The 1970s hit &ldquo;Dreadlock Holiday&rdquo; by 10cc follows a similar theme.</p>
<p><br/>
This 10cc song, like the Clash song, was inspired by real events. It was told to 10cc by a member of the Moody Blues who, as &#8220;Dreadlock Holiday&#8221; tells, was not exactly robbed in Jamaica, but was intimidated. The Moody was persistently pestered by some aggressive yardie who took a liking to his family-heirloom wristwatch, and demanded to buy it &#8220;for one dollar.&#8221; I believe the situation was less an armed robbery than what New Yorkers call &#8220;aggressive panhandling.&#8221; But still unpleasant   &mdash;   and the sort of thing that EVERY white tourist in Jamaica is confronted if they leave their hotel or compound. </p>

Ironically, Europe is being transformed into something similar to the hell-for-whites The Clash <i>fought for.</i> The band was actively, stridently left-wing, even titling the 1980 album &#8220;Sandinista.&#8221; They played more black music styles (reggae, funk, soul, even early rap) than just about any other Punk band. They sang admiringly of &#8220;The Guns of Brixton.&#8221; They played at (communist-organized) &#8220;Rock Against Racism&#8221; benefit concerts. They associated with   &mdash;   and promoted to the world through their music   &mdash;   the West Indian immigrant community (and criminal underworld) of London. </p>
<p>And they did all this despite the fact that the one time they&rsquo;d actually been to a black country, they not only found the place to be dirty and chaotic, they were even <i>robbed at gunpoint.</i> </p>
<p>Multiculturalism = Mental Disorder. </p>

		<p>To ehunter (re post # 5):</p>
<p>Another film that shows life in Jamaica, is &#8220;Marked For Death&#8221;, with Steven Seagal. He goes to Jamaica with his cop partner to hunt down a dope dealer named Screwface. In one scene his cop partner is walking down the streets with a local Jamaican cop named Charles, who is also after Screwface. They go down a street which is littered with stoned-out Jamaicans sitting against buildings, oblivious to everything.</p>
<p>Charles says: &#8220;Dese are da streets which produce the Screwfaces of da world&#8221;.</p>
<p>Cop Partner says&#8221; I&rsquo;ve got to apologize to you. For the first time, I&rsquo;m beginning to see it&rsquo;s not all sunshine and bikinis&#8221;.</p>
<p>Charles: &#8220;Ah, no need to apologize, mon&#8221;.</p>
<p>Seagal and his partner wipe out the Jamaican posse, of course. Here&rsquo;s the kicker: Toward the end of the film credits, there&rsquo;s actually a disclaimer that says Jamaican posses in no way reflect upon the other 99% of Jamaicans.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re telling the viewer not to jump to conclusions. Kind of hard NOT to, with all of this stuff going on in Jamaica.</p>

		<p>I went to Trinidad last year.   It is very lush and tropical and scenic.  It&rsquo;s  about half East Indian and half black African, and a good deal more prosperous than the other Caribbean islands which are all black. (They have oil.)  Nonetheless,  I was warned repeatedly not to walk around, be out after dark,  or go anywhere except by taxi. I was first told this by the stewardess on the plane, who was herself  from Trinidad.  Even in the hotel (the Hilton) there were printed notices warning guests not to go out after dark or walk anywhere outside the hotel grounds.</p>
<p>What kind of vacation is it, I ask you, when you can&rsquo;t stray outside the hotel?  It&rsquo;s like being in a fancy prison.</p>
<p>I was interested to observe that there are numerous  well-off AA-type American blacks who now vacation in such places, spending their money among their own.  No doubt in Jamaica too.  (I wonder if they also experience the same problems?)   This gives the islands a new tourist market, aside from the whites who were traditionally their bread and butter.</p>
<p>Oh, another thing:  the hotel  (although beautiful)  had bedbugs!  I had thought going to a high-end hotel like that would guarantee me against such things.  But no.   Trinidad did it;  one time was enough.  I would not want to see Jamaica. </p>
<p>One last thing: I have flown over  Jamaica and seen it from the air.  It must have been, in its natural state, very lush and tropical.   But it&rsquo;s now crowded with little towns  everywhere and appears to be densely overpopulated, although it&rsquo;s not all barren  earth, stripped clean like Haiti.   Not yet.</p>
