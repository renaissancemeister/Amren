<h1>Discount Offered for Racially Diverse Dining</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WLBT-TV (Jackson, Mississippi), May 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Thirteen restaurants around the metropolitan Jackson area are taking part in Mission Mississippi&rsquo;s &#8220;Two &amp; Two Restaurant Days&#8221; on Tuesday and Thursday of this week.</p>
<p>Those who eat at participating restaurants for lunch and/or dinner will receive a 22-percent discount on their meal if they dine with someone of a different race.</p>
<p>A minimum of two people should be on each ticket order. Once you&rsquo;re seated, mention that you are participating in the program to receive the discount. {snip}</p>
<p>Here is a list of the participating restaurants:</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure alot of co-workers will go out at lunch time to take advantage of this offer but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re going to become close personal friends.  They&rsquo;ve been working in the same place for ten years and hardly speak to each other.  Why would they start now?</p>

		<p>Ummmm&hellip;.do they have a specific definiton of &#8220;race&#8221;?</p>
<p>What about bi-racial? What about someone who is 1/6 American Indian? I am 1/16th Laplander and some white nationalists claim that is a different race. Do they classify Jews or Persians as a &#8220;different race&#8221;?</p>
<p>Would love to see each server have to make those judgement calls, I seriously doubt if they would want to get into an argument over it.</p>

<p>Life imitates satire: Around 20 years ago, Canadian author Mordecai Richler wrote a long piece in the New Yorker about the absurdities and inequities of Quebec&rsquo;s French-supremacy laws   &mdash;   including the regulation that signs inside stores throughout <i>la belle province</i> were required to have all French text printed twice as large as the English version. The writer proposed a new law whereby in restaurants ordering your meal in French would get you portions twice as large than if you ordered in English. </p>
<p>Richler was being facetious, of course. But his proposal was no sillier than this 22% discount offer in Mississippi. </p>

		<p>Well, well.   What will the diversitarians think up next?<br/>
I&rsquo;ve speculated all along that we&rsquo;re going to see, eventually, government programs offering tax rebates to mixed marriages, rent subsidies to mixed-race families, and to those who adopt children of another race, etc., as well as other forms of economic inducements.</p>
<p>But I hadn&rsquo;t thought of this one!  The minds of these marxists are endlessly fertile in coming up with carrot-and-stick approaches to either coax you or bully you into miscegenating.</p>
<p>I suspect that we&rsquo;re going to see a lot more of these subtle carrot-or-stick inducements in the future.</p>
<p>However, it must be said that they only prove how unnatural race-mixing is. When you look at the birds in the park, the sparrows and the pigeons get along: they do not hate each other or fight. But they DO NOT MIX either!  Each goes with its own kind.</p>
<p>The Marxists constantly peddle their propaganda that we are a sick society, that &#8220;racists&#8221; are sick and evil people.  But, to the contrary, if racial mixing were natural, we would all be doing it without any incentives.  It would not be necessary for them to resort to so many devious incentives to entice us to do what does not come naturally. </p>
<p>When you have to PAY people to sit at a table with someone of another race, that&rsquo;s pretty pathetic.  That says silently but loudly just how unnatural and undesirable  it is.</p>

		<p>And yet again, liberals have me reaching for the barf bag. This is absolutely disgusting. But I will take advantage of it if I ever go to Alabama (which is unlikely). I&rsquo;m one-thirty-second Cherokee Indian, therefor technically I must qualify for this discount, right? If they deny it to me, I will sue them for committing a hate crime. Give them a taste of their own medicine.</p>

		<p>Every white person should bring along a Chinese or Japanese friend to get that 22% discount.  This will disturb the restaurant owners greatly, as I&rsquo;m sure this isn&rsquo;t the diversity they had in mind.  Alternatively, stretch the definition of race, and insist that your Celtic heritage is racially distinct from that of your Italian wife.  After all, race is a social construct, so you may as well construct it to your advantage.</p>

		<p> Wonder how many black males and their White girlfriends   &mdash;   or worse, wives   &mdash;   will show up to take advantage of the discount? If they have half-breed kids, will the kids get an 11 percent discount?</p>
<p> This has to be the most ridiculous, most White-guilt ridden scheme I&rsquo;ve heard of in many a day. It&rsquo;s like the title of a children&rsquo;s program I listened to on the radio when I was young, back in the 1950s: &#8220;Let&rsquo;s Pretend.&#8221; Let&rsquo;s pretend that we all have a good friend who is of another race. Let&rsquo;s pretend we&rsquo;re here just to show how virtuously liberal and broad-minded we are   &mdash;   not just to get the 22 percent discount. Let&rsquo;s pretend lots of us would be doing this anyway, even if we didn&rsquo;t get the discount.</p>
<p> Let&rsquo;s pretend the person who conceived this idea has even a lick of sense. </p>

		<p>Nobody&rsquo;s mentioned this   &mdash;   but this is flatly illegal.  Charging a customer more for a meal because he dines with someone of the same skin color is exactly the sort of discrimination that Title VII doesn&rsquo;t allow.  I&rsquo;d love for some AR readers in Mississippi to challenge this with the EEOC and then in court.</p>

		<p>Let private businesses do as they wish.  But if businesses can give discounts for mixed groups and couples, they must also be allowed to charge extra for mixed groups and couples.  What I&rsquo;m saying is that &#8220;cheap&#8221; and &#8220;expensive&#8221; are relative terms.  If my group is not mixed, then I am being charged more (penalized, if you will) for racial reasons and that&rsquo;s discrimination.  I hope somebody sues them for racial discrimination - just to clear this up.</p>

		<p>I live in Jackson. The restaurants listed are almost all somewhat pricier places that tend to be frequented by whites. Most of these would probably be considered kinda &#8220;yuppie&#8221; type places. Or, are owned by Indians. The city is over 95% black and these places (not in the ghetto) think that they would do better if they could tap into this majority group. They don&rsquo;t really know what they will get&hellip; <br/>
Did you know that all Taco Bell restaurants in the city have removed the packets of sauces (Mild, hot and fire) from public access and now ask you how many packets you want. People were stealing hot sauce! Almost all the &#8220;All U can eat&#8221; buffets have gone out of business. (We&rsquo;ve got some fat folks!) Businesses of all kinds have shut down, Theft (from employees), Robbery, poor service and  mismanagement are common place here. Even the fast food places have these problems. Gunshots are so common place that no one even raises an eyebrow (I just look to make sure I have mine handy). Had an actual gunfight go down at one rental house and the cops wouldn&rsquo;t even look for any evidence (shell casings, bullets, etc.) they wrote up a report and told the renter to find out the real name and address of the shooter and they would then arrest him! (Just another shooting)!!! Welcome to &#8220;Little Africa&#8221;&hellip; I found a poster nailed to a light pole, titled &#8220;LiL Tank, salute a Real N***a&#8221; with a color photo of &#8220;Tank&#8221;. Guess he just wanted people to know who he is??? </p>

		<p>Is interracial social interaction so repugnant we must be bribed and cajoled?</p>
<p>Now I wonder:</p>
<p>On the one hand the multiculturalists insist that race is a social construct that really doesn&rsquo;t really exist. </p>
<p>On the other hand the multiculturalists must recognize the existence of race when determining what constitutes an interracial dinning experience.</p>
<p>If I were to walk in with a German, Irishman and Kentuckian and declare my dining party &#8220;raciall diverse,&#8221; we would probably fail the restaurant&rsquo;s racial profiling test. </p>

		<p>Is this going to carry over into other things? </p>
<p>Does inter-racial sex get you a discount at the already-cheap motels? or does it entitle you to free condoms at the Health Department? (I certainly hope so.) </p>
<p>If you have to work alongside a person more diverse than yourself, who gets the extra pay? (We could probably argue about that one.)</p>
<p>Do you think it might ever get to the point that they have &#8220;Diversity Lanes&#8221; on the major urban routes, that can only be used by carpoolers with diverse riders in the same car? (Would those lanes also be available to those families formed by interracial marriage?)</p>
<p>This just might catch on in this country&hellip;<br/>

		<p>It is always important to bring social conventions into accord with the unprecedented pace of scientific advancement.  It is<br/>
perfectly plausible that not only social commingling but intermarriage might be fully compatible with our traditional values in those rare instances  &mdash;  rare instances  &mdash;   in which DNA profiling would indicate a finer standard of discimination than that which we&rsquo;ve had to rely on previously. &#8220;The uniform of war&#8221; no longer becomes in such rare instances  the color of the skin but the nature of the DNA profile.  It is noteworthy that President Obama&rsquo;s paternal grandfather had reservations about his Kenyan bloodline being possibly defiled by marriage under the particular circumstances.  Madilyn Payne, the President&rsquo;s  maternal grandmother, appears to have been bright, but the other Caucasians were nothing to write back to Kenya about.  ( Nor is Michelle Robinson Obama, for that matter )       </p>

		<p>This absolute nonsense is just one step closer to ordering who you may/may not associate with. As one poster said, if diversity is so enjoyable and beneficial, why do people have to be bribed and begged to participate? And it is totally, completely and blatantly RACIAL in nature. Isn&rsquo;t that what we&rsquo;re supposed to be avoiding???</p>

		<p>Is this even legal?   Is this fertile grounds for a lawsuit?</p>
<p>If I am sitting at a table with another white person and paying full price&hellip;. and you are sitting with a non-white, and paying less than I am for the same meal, does that not constitute blatant racial discrimination?  I thought it was illegal for businesses to discriminate by race!</p>
<p>You mean my white partner doesn&rsquo;t qualify for a discount, but your non-white partner does?</p>
<p>I would think this would be good grounds for legal action on the basis of racial discrimination.</p>

		<p>I am not certain, but differential pricing for individuals based on race is probably a violation of various civil rights laws.  That said, the oxygen-waster we have impersonating an Attorney General recently claimed that white people do not have civil rights, so my point is probably moot.<br/>

		<p>Found out about this, when our usual waiter gave me and three black girlfriends/colleagues the discount, without our asking.</p>
<p>The listed eateries, BTW, are some of the best in town&hellip;in case you&rsquo;re passing through.</p>
<p>Contrary to media portrayals, race relations in Mississippi are, and have always been, better than one could reasonably expect.  There are a lot of very nice blacks.  We&rsquo;ve been here, together, for about two centuries, and share a common religion and culture (not to mention Scottish/Jewish/Indian bloodlines).</p>
<p>My friends are third-generation college grads, descended from black landowners, who inherited their farms generations ago, from members of families like mine.  There is no harm in getting along, and frankly, it is wise to do so.<br/>

Lauren,</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of a woman who wanted to get along: </p>

		<p>Lauren, blacks and Whites get along better in the South because there&rsquo;s an unspoken racial barrier that most good Southerners (black and White) don&rsquo;t cross.  It&rsquo;s alright to be polite and pleasant and interact with blacks at a casual level or even eat lunch with a black co-worker, we simply do not want to live in the same space, send our kids to the same schools or intermarry each other and by the way that feeling is mutual.  This is just my opinion but if I&rsquo;m dining out in a higher class establishment with a dress code, linen tablecloths, a maitre d and a roaming violinist, I don&rsquo;t want to look around and feel as if I&rsquo;m sitting in a bus station in downtown Atlanta or in the audience of some sleazy talk show.  </p>

		<p>What if my black buddy and I both brought books or papers to correct, or some office work and sat at the same table  &mdash;  just not &#8220;interacting&#8221; with each other?  Would that give us a lesser percentage off our bill, you know, for time not &#8220;interacting&#8221; with each other?  Do we even have to make eye contact once in a while?  Who monitors this? </p>

<p>&#8220;I live in Jackson. The restaurants listed are almost all somewhat pricier places that tend to be frequented by whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.  Forget the media brainwashing.  The sort of people that frequent these kinds of places probably have little contact with blacks outside of an occasional shoeshine at the airport.  Mixed race anything has always been a marker for low class and if the restaurants aren&rsquo;t careful they&rsquo;re going to scare off their loyal customers. </p>

<p>I appreciate black folks who make an effort to participate in our Western heritage, am grateful for my black friends and highly respect the few conservative black leaders who have the courage to stand against the status quo. </p>
<p>But refusing to acknowledge the reality that black on white (and black on Asian) hatred and violence is both intrinsically innate and culturally instilled will not make those issues disappear. </p>
<p>Popularly called &#8220;white guilt&#8221; the multiculturalist agenda of the political left has successfully embedded a state of cultural psychosis in the minds of white people. We allow ourselves to be physically beaten, robbed, and scammed through government-imposed programs such as the mis-named Affirmative Action. All the while we have been mentally conditioned to blame ourselves. </p>
<p>While your delusion of racial harmony is admirable, it is not reality. It is psychotic.</p>
<p>Fortunately there are a few who are capable of resisting mind manipulation and think clearly. If you care to join us, there are several prescribed cures for your psychosis:<br/>
 <br/>
1. Move into a black neighborhood   <br/>
2. Volunteer to work in a predominantly black high school<br/>
3. Take the L in Chicago<br/>
4. Enjoy a liesurely mid-night stroll through any black neighborhood<br/>
5. Get a job working the counter at a convenience store in a black neighborhood<br/>
6. Ride a school bus in East St. Louis<br/>

		<p>Perhaps there&rsquo;s a commercial opportunity here.  One could establish a Rent-a-Black agency in order to provide black dining partners with which to qualify for the 22% discount.</p>
