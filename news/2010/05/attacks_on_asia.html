<h1>Attacks on Asian-Americans Lead to Racial Tension in SF</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Juliana Barbassa, Sacramento Bee, May 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still, such attacks and the death of a Chinese immigrant from San Francisco who was assaulted during a visit to Oakland have focused the anger of Asian-Americans here, pushing them to vent in emotional rallies their long-simmering perception that they are targets of racially motivated violence. In all cases, the perpetrators were black teenagers, police said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This just sent them over the top. This is an activist city, but this isn&rsquo;t an activist population at all,&#8221; said Chia-Chi Li, one of the organizers of a rally that drew hundreds of mostly older Chinese-Americans to the steps of San Francisco City Hall bearing signs saying, &#8220;Asians are not punching bags,&#8221; and &#8220;Stop attacking the elders and the vulnerable.&#8221;</p>
<p>In this bastion of diversity and tolerance, the tension between two of its minorities has become painful.</p>
<p>Although both groups have suffered discrimination over the decades, the African-American community has been declining here faster than in any other major city, while the Asian-American community has been growing, partly due to immigration.</p>
<p>Now almost one in three San Franciscans is of Asian descent, and many have moved into affordable, historically black neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Street violence in these neighborhoods is not new, say people in the black community. They&rsquo;ve suffered it for years. It just never drew much attention, they said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police Chief George Gascon has played down the role of race in the attacks, and pointed to statistics to show Asian Americans are not disproportionately targeted in street crimes in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Asian Americans make up 30 percent of the city&rsquo;s population, and account for 19 percent of the victims, Gason said. African Americans are 7 percent of the population, but make up 21 percent of victims.</p>
<p>These are crimes of opportunity, agreed Greg Suhr, police captain of the Bayview district where Mrs. Cheng lives. Victims tend to be vulnerable  &mdash;  the elderly, the young, women, &#8220;whoever&rsquo;s easiest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Cheng is about 4 feet 10 inches tall, he said. One of her assailants, a 15-year-old who was arrested and charged with felony assault, is 6 feet tall.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some of the violence suffered by Asian-Americans in San Francisco comes from the fact they are moving into neighborhoods that have crime, said Rev. Amos Brown, pastor of the Third Baptist Church of San Francisco and head of the city&rsquo;s NAACP chapter.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When Asian-Americans moved into black neighborhoods like Mrs. Cheng&rsquo;s, it may have created tensions that were exacerbated by economic stresses and deep language and cultural barriers, experts say.</p>

		<p>The San Francisco po-leece are doing all that they can to lie to then Chinese community that these incidents arent racially motivated by pointing out that there are more black on black incidents than black on asian.That may be technically true, but they leave an important detail out.The black on black assaults are cases where the victim and the assaliant knew each other, and therefore there was a definite motivation for it. </p>

		<p>&#8220;African Americans are 7 percent of the population, but make up 21 percent of victims.&#8221;  Hmmm, I wonder how much of that crime is committed by Orientals against blacks?  Not much I bet.</p>
<p>&#8220;they are moving into neighborhoods that have crime, said Rev. Amos Brown,&hellip;.head of the city&rsquo;s NAACP chapter.  Gee, and I wonder who made those neighborhoods crime infested holes?</p>

<p>So don&rsquo;t worry about it, Mrs Cheng. It was nothing personal. </p>
<p>To think that if blacks were being disproportionately robbed by Whites the media and politicos would demand all kinds of soul searching and extra-special double-jeopardy court cases to make sure the evil Whites do time. <br>
Since Asians are not yet one of the protected groups the cops will make up excuses for the black criminals that terrorize them. It is interesting that the crime stats quoted above leave out the race of the perps. So blacks are 7% of the populace and 21% of the victims, so what percentage of the criminals are black? I&rsquo;m sure much more than 7%</p>

		<p>I lived in the Bay Area for 6 years.  What I know from that experience is that nobody who isn&rsquo;t black has any business at all moving into Oakland.  Or Richmond either, for that matter.  These are black enclaves, and if you&rsquo;re not black, you are risking severe bodily injury or death if you even go into Oakland for a short errand, let alone move there.  I&rsquo;m sorry the Chinese lady got hurt, but really, what was her family thinking, letting her move over there?  She&rsquo;d be better off in the Tenderloin than in Oakland.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Experts say&#8221;that tensions are created by &#8220;stresses&#8221; and &#8220;barriers&#8221;. So who are these &#8220;experts&#8221; and what qualifies them as such? They have a knack for throwing up smokescreens and portray situations like this as things that just happen, beyond human control. They also seem to imply that the Asians are triggering the attacks by moving into black areas, thus perhaps being partly to blame. They have every right to live there if they&rsquo;re here legally. Blacks seem to think they own the streets they walk on, even if they&rsquo;re only food stamp recipients or section 8 dwellers. Bashing vulnerable, easy marks is considered a sport, fun and games for black youth, a part of the culture. Once people grasp this simple concept the picture becomes clearer. The last person to ask about this, though, is one of these &#8220;experts&#8221;.     </p>

		<p>	There would be far less problems in the United States if we were a white only nation&hellip; our fore fathers knew this and attempted returning blacks to their homeland beginning in 1822 ending in 1847 that&rsquo;s 25 years of sending them to Liberia; we called it the (Africa Campaigns) but you will never hear the blacks speak of these campaigns&hellip; white&rsquo;s have never attempted sending Asians back to their homeland, because Asians are actually productive.	 </p>

		<p>Just about kicked the television in last night, watching a preview of the remake of &#8220;The Karate Kid.&#8221; The victim is now a black girl, bullied by hordes of Asians&hellip; just about perfectly the opposite of reality!</p>
<p>BTW, in an enlightening experience last weekend I was walking just outside a college campus when a scrawny white kid in an SUV came roaring up, screaming at me that I&rsquo;d punched his car. I hadn&rsquo;t the faintest idea what he was talking about, and still don&rsquo;t. I suspect he was either tweaking or drunk and in a foul mood over something else. He screamed obscenities at me, threatened to kick my ass, then sped off with tires screeching.</p>
<p>Though I probably could have dusted his broom without working up a sweat, it was initially quite intimidating to be approached like that while minding my own business and not paying him the slightest attention. Once in a great while you&rsquo;ll have an encounter like that with another white person, but with blacks it&rsquo;s a way of life. Does it make us a bunch of wussies when we don&rsquo;t go around everywhere with a hairtrigger &#8220;fight&#8221; reflex or even know quite how to respond to such behavior?</p>

		<p> So the blacks feel like they&rsquo;re being &#8220;invaded&#8221; by outsiders when Chinese move into their neighborhoods, and react violently, and we should be &#8220;understanding&#8221; of that? Sounded to me like that&rsquo;s what the article said.</p>
<p> That&rsquo;s funny. When blacks started moving into a lot of all-White neighborhoods, 50-odd years ago, and some White teenagers attacked blacks, the attackers were simply condemned as &#8220;racists,&#8221; weren&rsquo;t they? When it comes to social problems, blacks are given the benefit of every doubt; Whites are condemned, out of hand. </p>

<p>Surprising this isn&rsquo;t blamed on the anti-immigrant sentiments of bigoted whites. In fact, by omitting certain facts, it probably will be. </p>

<p>How laughable! Will the city boycott itself over this lawlessness, as they have decide to do to Arizona for enforcing the law?</p>
<p>Personally, I was once sympathetic towards the Asian victims of black criminal rampages; however, I am not any longer. These Asian &ldquo;Americans&rdquo; have largely decided to participate in the game of hands out and mouths open, guilt and grievance mongering against whitey, that all the other nonwhite invaders employ. Thus, should blacks and Hispanics begin to target them as entitlement competitors, I say, oh what a pity!</p>

<p>At least the Asians were willing to shoot at these black thugs.  Remember the Korean shopowners in LA?  Most whites would just sit there and say, &#8220;Please, don&rsquo;t hurt me.

#9 -The answer is -because Liberia is such a civilized, model example of Civilization, a treasure trove of &#8216;cultural achievement&rsquo; and in all ways a success. -Just like Haiti or Rhodesia&hellip;   Just look at the government&rsquo;s own warnings about travel there. IDK how to do this tinyurl thing, so go to <a href="https://travel.state.gov/" rel="nofollow">https://travel.state.gov</a> and midway down, under &#8220;country specific information&#8221;  pick a country. They should also do ones for Detroit and Atlanta etc but do not.</p>
<p>If you visit that page, which is the State Department, Department of Consular Affairs page BTW  -see if it strikes you as odd that the picture banner at the top depicts 12 blacks, 3 &#8216;latinos&rsquo; and 4 whites, 0 asians. Kind of makes you wonder.</p>

<p>I also think that it&rsquo;ll be just a matter of time before the &#8220;Shanghai Dragons&#8221; will rumble with the Black Crips. When that happens, Bantus will be screaming &#8220;racism&#8221;, and the police will STILL be denying that the fights have &#8220;racial undertones&#8221;.</p>
<p>Remember those articles posted here on Amren about the gang wars in CA between Bantus and various Mexican/South American gangs? Well, it&rsquo;ll be Bantu/Chinese gang wars soon. And I can&rsquo;t wait, because the city of San Francisco - for whom tourism is its economic life blood - will be dumping a load in its panties trying to figure out what to do about it.</p>

<p>This actually did happen in Chicago a number of years ago now. They are called the &#8220;Ghost Shadows&#8221;. Operate out of Hong Kong and have branches in all U.S. cities. Very tough, stake out a turf in the local Chinatown and keep the blacks out. Good for the local restaurant owners that cater to a whitey clientele.</p>
