			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Eugene Volokh, The Volokh Conspiracy, May 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As I said in my first post on the Harvard e-mail controversy, I believe we <em>should</em> be open to the possibility of genetic racial differences in intelligence, just as we should be open to a wide range of other scientific possibilities. I have not simply been arguing that people should have a First Amendment argument to express such openness. I have been arguing that such openness is in fact sound, and that closing off this possibility in our minds (and in our conversations) cannot be sound, especially given how much scientists have yet to learn about the genetic basis of intelligence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But in case it&rsquo;s helpful, I thought I&rsquo;d pass along some recent statements from scientists who work in this field  &mdash;  statements that I think help highlight the correctness of the view I defend, and its practical importance for the coming years. First, a 2006 item from noted Harvard psychologist Prof. Steven Pinker, who is actually <em>skeptical</em> about claims of racial differences in intelligence:<blockquote>The year 2005 saw several public appearances of what will I predict will become the dangerous idea of the next decade: that groups of people may differ genetically in their average talents and temperaments.</p>
<p>	<ul><li>In January, Harvard president Larry Summers caused a firestorm when he cited research showing that women and men have non-identical statistical distributions of cognitive abilities and life priorities.</p>
<p>	<li>In March, developmental biologist Armand Leroi published an op-ed in the <cite>New York Times</cite> rebutting the conventional wisdom that race does not exist. (The conventional wisdom is coming to be known as Lewontin&rsquo;s Fallacy: that because most genes may be found in all human groups, the groups don&rsquo;t differ at all. But patterns of <em>correlation</em> among genes do differ between groups, and different clusters of correlated genes correspond well to the major races labeled by common sense.)</p>
<p>	<li>In June, the <cite>Times</cite> reported a forthcoming study by physicist Greg Cochran, anthropologist Jason Hardy, and population geneticist Henry Harpending proposing that Ashkenazi Jews have been biologically selected for high intelligence, and that their well-documented genetic diseases are a by-product of this evolutionary history.</p>
<p>	<li>In September, political scientist Charles Murray published an article in <cite>Commentary</cite> reiterating his argument from <cite>The Bell Curve</cite> that average racial differences in intelligence are intractable and partly genetic.</ul></p>
<p>Whether or not these hypotheses hold up (the evidence for gender differences is reasonably good, for ethnic and racial differences much less so), they are widely perceived to be dangerous. Summers was subjected to months of vilification, and proponents of ethnic and racial differences in the past have been targets of censorship, violence, and comparisons to Nazis. Large swaths of the intellectual landscape have been reengineered to try to rule these hypotheses out a priori (race does not exist, intelligence does not exist, the mind is a blank slate inscribed by parents).&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Advances in genetics and genomics will soon provide the ability to test hypotheses about group differences rigorously.&nbspl;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [T]he prospect of genetic tests of group differences in psychological traits is both more likely and more incendiary [than the more commonly discussed prospects of cloning and human genetic enhancement], and is one that the current intellectual community is ill-equipped to deal with. {snip}</blockquote></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Or consider this material from 2009 <cite>Nature</cite> article by Profs. Bruce T. Lahn (Univ. of Chicago) and Lanny Ebenstein (UC Santa Barbara), titled <cite>Let&rsquo;s Celebrate Human Genetic Diversity:</cite><blockquote>[E]nough evidence has come to the fore to warrant the question: what if scientific data ultimately demonstrate that genetically based biological variation exists at non-trivial levels not only among individuals but also among groups? In our view, the scientific community and society at large are ill-prepared for such a possibility. We need a moral response to this question that is robust irrespective of what research uncovers about human diversity.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>The current moral position is a sort of &#8216;biological egalitarianism[,]&rsquo; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the view that no or almost no meaningful genetically based biological differences exist among human groups, with the exception of a few superficial traits such as skin colour.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We believe that this position, although well intentioned, is illogical and even dangerous, as it implies that if significant group diversity were established, discrimination might thereby be justified.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.{snip}</blockquote></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other scientists say related things. University of Virginia psychology professor Jonathan Heidt asserts that &#8220;Recent &#8216;sweeps&rsquo; of the genome across human populations show that hundreds of genes have been changing during the last 5-10 millennia in response to local selection pressures,&#8221; and that &#8220;traits that led to Darwinian success in one of the many new niches and occupations of Holocene life  &mdash;  traits such as collectivism, clannishness, aggressiveness, docility, or the ability to delay gratification&#8221; may therefore prove to be ethnically linked (to a degree, of course) on a genetic level. (By the way, as I said in my first post on this matter, I would no more rule out the possibility that Jews, my own ethnic group, are genetically predisposed to more acquisitiveness than average than that some ethnic groups are genetically predisposed to less intelligence than average  &mdash;  though of course I would not accept either conclusion as true without solid evidence. You can&rsquo;t rule out scientific possibilities just because some evil people had, for unscientific reasons, asserted similar things in the past.)</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that the &#8216;Bell Curve&rsquo; wars of the 1990s, over race differences in intelligence,&#8221; Heidt continues, &#8220;will seem genteel and short-lived compared to the coming arguments over ethnic differences in [these sorts of] traits.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [W]hatever consensus we ultimately reach, the ways in which we now think about genes, groups, evolution and ethnicity will be radically changed by the unstoppable progress of the human genome project.&#8221;</p>
<p>Likewise, here&rsquo;s an excerpt from an article by University of New Mexico psychology professor Geoffrey Miller in <cite>The Economist,</cite> Nov. 13, 2009:<blockquote>[Coming developments in] genetics will reveal much less than hoped about how to cure disease, and much more than feared about human evolution and inequality, including genetic differences between classes, ethnicities and races.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>In 2010, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [d]ozens of papers will report specific genes associated with almost every imaginable trait  &mdash;  intelligence, personality, religiosity, sexuality, longevity, economic risk-taking, consumer preferences, leisure interests and political attitudes. The data are already collected, with DNA samples from large populations already measured for these traits.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>When sequencing costs drop within a few years below $1,000 per genome, researchers in Europe, China and India will start huge projects with vast sample sizes, sophisticated bioinformatics, diverse trait measures and detailed family structures. (American bioscience will prove too politically squeamish to fund such studies.).&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>We will .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. identify the many genes that create physical and mental differences across populations, and we will be able to estimate when those genes arose. Some of those differences probably occurred very recently, within recorded history. Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending argued in &#8220;The 10,000 Year Explosion&#8221; that some human groups experienced a vastly accelerated rate of evolutionary change within the past few thousand years, benefiting from the new genetic diversity created within far larger populations, and in response to the new survival, social and reproductive challenges of agriculture, cities, divisions of labour and social classes. Others did not experience these changes until the past few hundred years when they were subject to contact, colonisation and, all too often, extermination.</p>
<p>If the shift .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to sequencing studies finds evidence of such politically awkward and morally perplexing facts, we can expect the usual range of ideological reactions, including nationalistic retro-racism from conservatives and outraged denial from blank-slate liberals. The few who really understand the genetics will gain a more enlightened, live-and-let-live recognition of the biodiversity within our extraordinary species  &mdash;  including a clearer view of likely comparative advantages between the world&rsquo;s different economies.</blockquote></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Of course, these scientists may be wrong. There are doubtless other scientists who disagree with them. The history of science is filled with highly credentialed and respected scientists who have proven to be wrong.</p>
<p>But the question right now isn&rsquo;t whether there <em>are</em> the genetic differences among groups that these scientists suggest might (or might not) exist. It&rsquo;s whether we, both scientists and interested laypeople, should be <em>open to the possibility</em> that they exist, and whether those of us who admit  &mdash;  in an e-mail to a close friend  &mdash;  that such openness should be publicly pilloried for daring to think that this is indeed a possibility. The answer, it seems to me, is that we should indeed be open to this scientific possibility, as the scientists whom I quote above are open to it, and that we should not be condemned for this openness.</p>

		<p>When racial differences in intelligence are irrefutably proven, I don&rsquo;t think that &#8220;live and let live&#8221; will be the prevailing response.  Too much damage has been done to let the Reds slip past without a reckoning.  </p>

		<p>I can hear the applause from Dr. Rushton and Mr. Taylor now!!  Indeed we must keep our minds open to whatever the geneticists discover about differences between the races, be it intellectual, kinesthetic, or whatever.  Those of us who have read The Bell Curve (yes I did - every single page!) and Rushton (ditto) already have a pretty good idea of what&rsquo;s coming.  The question is, when the Asian scientists prove their contentions beyond a shadow of a doubt - what in the world are the spineless liberal scientists going to do?  And how about those whose groups are proven to be low on the intelligence totem pole?  Hmmmmmmm&hellip;&hellip;</p>

<p>Amren supporters and bona fides may be enjoying the possibility that their belief in low black IQs will become universally accepted as scientific fact and thereby roll back the Equality Syndrome that has been destroying our country since Boas.</p>
<p>But the future isn&rsquo;t a return to sanity.  The future is frightening, bleak, hostile, dangerous, extreme, and violent.</p>
<p>The same tyrannical powers who force Multicultural Diversity upon us will twist the genetic science facts to suit their genocide against Whites.  </p>
<p>The logic will work something along the lines that while we accept the genetic science, the fact of the science is an indictment against White Privilege and racial exclusivity, i.e. racism.  </p>
<p>White intelligence will be equated to historically selective mating that is based on Whites&rsquo; hatred of blacks. If Whites hadn&rsquo;t been such racists, their genes would have been more equally shared within the Global Family, lifting all and not just the few.  With more intelligent genes circulating through the populations, there would have been less oppression, marginalization, exclusion, inequality, and White Privilege. </p>
<p>Therefore, intelligent White Women, especially the pretty ones, need to atone for racist White breeding habits by never breeding again with intelligent White men.</p>
<p>Everyone will be given the genetic test and their scores will be used to determine what breeding will be disallowed. If the planned results don&rsquo;t work, White males will all be castrated, and the Evangelical Christians will declare that the Holy Spirit is moving through history and helping us overcome outdated bigotries.</p>
<p>A couple of steps before that, until the blacks have their chance at the White Girls of their choice, no White Man will be allowed to mate.</p>
<p>We will live through times of sexual tyranny in this country that would be too horrible for the most horrible science fiction horror movie imaginable. </p>
<p>Your White Bloodlines will become muddy brownish yellow within the next three generations, and there is nothing you can do about it.  Wherever you run, they will follow.  </p>
<p>But this time, they won&rsquo;t rob, rape, and murder the White girls. They will just rob and rape and inseminate, all in the name of social justice, human rights, global equality, and human dignity.<br>

		<p>&#8220;A timid beginning, but at least a beginning.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read well-meaning comments from Amrenners who say that we must do this or we must do that in order to get more people on our side.  But, nothing will turn the tide.  This country has gone wayyyy to far into political correctness ever to change into a WN mindset.</p>
<p>Seceding or a new geogrphical home are our only chances to be rid of non-whites and rabid political leftists.</p>

		<p>There are just too many ignorant white people in this country to ever expect that things will get to the point where the truth isn&rsquo;t taboo.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a caption from one of the stories on the Drudge Report tonight:  Poll: 39% Would Pick Obama Again&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a VERY large percentage of whites in that figure.  They will NEVER learn.</p>

		<p>This is a great article and stupidity of the leftist comments on that page is mind boggling.  </p>
<p>I get the impression that the powers that be already know about the racial (and genetic) I.Q. gap and they are desperately working to prevent the masses from finding out.  In the meantime, they work feverishly to mix away the white race as quickly as possible.  That way, when the truth does get out, they can proclaim, &#8220;What does it matter?  We&rsquo;re all mixed anyway!&#8221;</p>

<p>You have just stated what I have believed for a long time! It will be a HATE crime for Whites to have White babies!  And as you say, those indoctrinated by their false prophets sitting in the churches, Evangelical Whites will be all for it! I am a Christian but not &#8220;their kind of Christian&#8221;&hellip;I am far from it. When I listen to Christian radio it only confirms that they are all for interracial marriages (as long as they are &#8220;Christians) and for interracial adoptions, especially African children. If that isn&rsquo;t anti-White I don&rsquo;t know what is.</p>

On the posts regarding Stephanie Grace and her open-mindess on the possibility of racial differences in IQ, </p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/2694nzz</p>
<p>one posters on the website posted using the name of &#8216;galtonian&rsquo;,</p>

<p>submitted a number of links regarding human adaption and population differences.</p>
<p>This &#8216;galtonian&rsquo; (a student of Francis Galton I assume), made it very clear that there was a great deal of researching being done behind the scenes on &#8216;human population differences&rsquo; (which he explained was the politically correct term used for &#8216;race&rsquo;).</p>

		<p>Please note all devoted Amren readers, that this Eugene is TRYING TO JUSTIFY HIS EVEN SUGGESTING THAT WE SHOULD BE OPEN JUST TO THE SUGGESTION THAT THERE MAY BE inheritable genetic differences in the mental capacities of the various races. He first has to JUSTIFY HIS SUGGESTION. So TOUCHY is the subject Eugene must first JUSTIFY himself.</p>
<p>We should obviously at least be open to the suggestion, agreed. After all, we see obvious physical differences to the races, various as they may be. Mental ability is associated with your brain, which is after all a physical part of your body, so it is reasonable at least to &#8220;suggest&#8221; that mental aptitude is also possibly genetic, inherited, etc. This is reasonable?</p>
<p>&#8220;roll back the Equality Syndrome that has been destroying our country since Boas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right. When China and India rule the world, it will only be accepted WITHOUT QUESTION THAT FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES IN MENTAL CAPACITIES EXIST BETWEEN THE RACES, AND THIS SHOULD NOT ONLY BE ACKNOWLEDGED, BUT EMBRACED. And whitey beware!!</p>

		<p>deceptions, lies, stealing, mass murder, slavery, colonization, the spread of disease as bio-warfare, the creation of the &#8216;gun&rsquo; the nuclear bomb, the creation of all vehicles of war and destruction&hellip;&hellip;and as you said and admit raw hatred..</p>
<p>Blacks had to learn this new way of life, from Whites&hellip;&hellip; Whites invented hatred, and every other race had to follow suit or die..</p>
<p>We agree here, Blacks were never as talented as Whites as far as radical raw hatred - used as a &#8216;tool&rsquo; to take over the world.</p>
<p>Every where Blacks are on this planet, has been interfered with by Whites, our perceived failure to you   &mdash;   is the direct result of your people&rsquo;s great hatred of us as a people!</p>
<p>Our gains as a people are always interfered with by White people.</p>
<p>And the fact that you and others like you come her innately and kinetically to hate us here, while we do not return the hate in forums Whites dominate is clear evidence of what has occurred through out history.</p>
<p>Your hatred is your disease, and our motivation to continue to with out use of nuclear weapons and the create of man-made disease to PASS you and as you can see by your dwindling population size and your losses in the White House - a great tide is coming, without wars, without committed your people to slavery, without sending your people the gift of &#8216;smallpox&rsquo; as a gift like your people did the Native Americans, without putting your people in concentration camps like you did the Japanese after you dropped nuclear bombs on their women and children   &mdash;   with out any of the oppressive methods Whites use&hellip;.</p>
<p>BLACKS will move forward, as it is our INNATE function and kinetic ability to raise regardless, it is our ability everywhere to live even in the worst of conditions, it is our ability to survive the greatest race of hater on the planet and replace them! In power, in success and in life all without doing ONE of the most oppressive things they have done to us. After Apartheid in Africa, the Whites there are the minority - they are still free after they did the worst things humans could do..</p>
<p>You know why, because Blacks are innately not like Whites, Whites use oppression globally.<br>
When you come here to hate us, I can feel it, I use it to motivate my personal success, the more your people hate me and my people - the more they energize me and my people</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our race cannot keep up a civilized society because your race is a bunch of savage as devils. Research Black wall street, research Timbuktu, research the Songhai empires everything the black man built the white man destroyed. Why is this ? Because when your race mutated from blacks you lost pigmentation and a moral conscience. Your race is a race of murderers and you all are inherently evil. Good thing nature is correcting itself by because by year 2050 most of your parasitic race will be extinct. Its natures way of correcting itself.</p>

		<p>I suspect that these scientists are pulling their punches, for two reasons.  First, they don&rsquo;t want to be lynched, so they limit themselves to allowing for the possibility of racial inequality, something no honest scientist could deny.  Second, they don&rsquo;t want to cause a panic or a hard political backlash.  Let the idea of the possibility of (face it) Black inferiority seep into the public&rsquo;s mind before announcing its confirmation.</p>

<p>Oh, please.  I rather doubt that the white race is going to be subjugated and its women turned into sex slaves for black Africans.  If they outnumbered us fifty to one there might be some possibility of whites being subjugated by blacks, though given the history of the Zulu wars in Africa, in which blacks hugely outnumbered the Dutch and English settlers, even this would seem doubtful. No intelligent race has ever been widely subjugated by a race of markedly lesser intelligence.  Katrina was only the most recent example of black incapacity and helplessness.  Note that in the mostly white communities wiped out by floods in the midwest recently there was no panic, no plaintive cries for help, only a systematic, stolid effort at rebuilding. Blacks aren&rsquo;t going to rule anybody, not now, not ever.  They can&rsquo;t even rule themselves, as evidenced by the many examples of urban decay and outright devastation wrought by them throughout our nation.  Someday in the not too distant future there will have to be a reckoning with them.  However it ends, it won&rsquo;t be with them on top.</p>

		<p>This may sound a bit &#8216;out there&rsquo;, but last weeks &#8216;Science journal&rsquo; published results from the most detailed look yet at the Neanderthal genome.<br>
The findings show that contray to popular belielf, Cro-Magons and Neandertals have most certainly interbred with genes from Neanderthals found in modern humans.<br>
 <br>
If these results are true, they may be another reason for differences in intelligence from within various racial and ethnic groups. <br>
These findings of course also add some weight to the Multiregional hypothesis regarding the origins of man.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/328/5979/680" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/328/5979/680</a> (Article)</p>
<p>{snip} &hellip; &#8220;This suggests that early modern humans interbred with Neandertals after moderns left Africa, but before they spread into Asia and Europe. The evidence showing interbreeding is &#8220;incontrovertible,&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip}&hellip;&#8221;Unexpectedly, the researchers found that Neandertals share more genetic variants with present-day non-Africans than with Africans. These results can be explained if gene flow occurred from Neandertals into the ancestors of non-Africans&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/2defqph" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2defqph</a> (map)</p>
<p>{snip}&hellip; &#8220;Between <b>1 percent and 4 percent of genes in people from Europe and Asia</b> trace back to Neanderthals&#8221;. </p>
<p>Neanderthals who died out about 25-30,000 yrs ago, had tools for things like hunting and sewing, controlled fire, lived in shelters and buried their dead and the Neandertal brain size was 1400-1450cc, compared the homo sapians modern &#8216;average&rsquo; of 1350cc.</p>
<p>All this information is pretty intriguing. <br>
I think one thing that even the left and right wings of politics should agree on, is that none of us really know enough yet about &#8216;our differences&rsquo; genetic or otherwise, to be blindly and arbitrarily pushing on with social experimentation and change for changes sake.</p>
<p>Surely all of those low self esteem, minority mental health studies, we often read about ought to at least prove, is that multi-cultural societies generally make people sad, I know they make me sad. <br>
Trying to maintain the status quo as the numerically dominant group is only a natural instinct, and those who live on the outside of this dominant group will always be the enemy of that drive.<br>
This is probably the rational behind why &#8216;White pride&rsquo; can never be officially recognised by our current Western leaders, as it discourages gentic socialism, as our leaders surely know that miscegenation is the only way that &#8220;all of the gaps can be bridged&#8221;.<br>

		<p>&#8220;The IQ of Croatia is 90, that of Greece 92, that of black America 91(Dickens and Flynn, 2006), that of Ireland 93.&#8221;</p>
<p>Occam&rsquo;s lone source for this assertion about blacks in America (he used to say all blacks) is Flynn, whom he clearly misrepresents:</p>
<p>&#8220;According to Flynn, the average IQ for black four-year olds is 95.4, which drops to 89.4 at age 14 and widens further to 83.4 by age 24&#8221;</p>
<p>http://reason.com/archives/2006/12/01/closing-the-black-white-iq-gap/2.</p>
<p>Flynn is forced to agree with his opponents that the black-white IQ gap widens with age, as environmental factors become increasingly less important, with genetic components assuming a greater role (something the American Psychological Association conceded long ago).,</p>

		<p>Being Jewish, I find it amusing when some articles state that Jews are &#8220;biologically&#8221; selected for intelligence. To be blunt, the Jewish people or culture one could say, self selected for intelligence. Nothing wrong with saying it but so many people dance around this issue or say it is Anti-Semitic to mention it. So the Jewish people have a higher average IQ, big deal. The overlap with most whites is huge and our &#8220;average&#8221; is actually about the same as that of Germans, Poles and other Northern Europeans, and many of us are intertwined genetically with these peoples. </p>
<p>I am more interested in what the Standard Deviation for IQ is among different ethnic groups. I have read all kinds of takes on this, with some claiming that the SD for Ashkenazi Jews is a bit narrower than that for most Caucasians, which is about 15 points. I have read of a couple of studies that pointed toward E. Asians having a narrower SD than whites, which seems to anger Asians to no end when this possibility is mentioned, and the same stance for blacks regarding a narrower SD than whites with E. Indians and Amerindians having the same 15 point SD as Caucasians. But most of the time this information is considered too hot to put forth to the general public. Those who seek to hide the truth about anything are cowards. </p>

<p>Or it could all play out like this.</p>
<p>The current genetic science confirms that blacks inherit their lower IQs, and it becomes widely broadcast over the internet.  Everyone goes nuts. The splc, adl, aclu, naacp don&rsquo;t challenge the findings, because they know they will lose. The science will just confirm to them what they&rsquo;ve always known.</p>
<p>But they will go ballistic about DANGEROUS AND EXTREMIST HATE SPEECH ON THE INTERNET regarding the low IQ gene in blacks, and will call for strict governmental controls of internet news and discussion. </p>
<p>The White scientists who want to keep their jobs won&rsquo;t try to refute the findings, but they will all agree that we should forbid any interpretation of the science if the discussion impedes our progress toward Social Justice and the American Promise of Equality. Forbidden will be any &#8220;low IQ in blacks&#8221; talk that makes anyone doubt our ongoing need to &#8220;atone for the past sins of slavery and segregation.&#8221; (That would be ALL normal  speech.)</p>
<p>Some will come out and say that the findings themselves aren&rsquo;t racist, but only a racist would draw any conclusions from the findings. In other words, we all know what&rsquo;s in this box, but nobody is allowed to have an opinion about what is in this box. </p>
<p>The findings will be considered off limits for discussing until &#8220;society has evolved in its understanding of the uniqueness of each individual and our responsibility toward historically marginalized group.&#8221;  Whites will lead this nonsense. Whites will say that until we progress in our social discourse to the point where discriminatory thoughts and words are so outdated as to become extinct, that we shouldn&rsquo;t ever talk about this &#8220;troubling&#8221; news.  </p>
<p>Some blacks will yell that &#8220;genetic science is racist,&#8221; but since blacks yell most of the time, nobody will pay much attention to them.</p>
<p>The real effect will be on the White scientists. They will all proclaim that they are passionately committed to embracing Diversity in science, but none of them will voluntarily offer their jobs to any blacks &#8220;scientist.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Then the attack.  </p>
<p>They will be accused of irredeemable biases caused by the White Racism Gene that makes them prone to think of black scientists as having lower IQs.  The &#8220;black stupid gene&#8221; will be blamed on racist White scientists who just wanted to have some &#8220;empirical&#8221; reason for not surrendering their jobs to more deserving blacks.</p>
<p>The argument so framed, the splc, adl, naacp, and aclu will easily demand that the government and any other institution not fund any White science experiments that have White scientists in the highest paid and leadership positions. </p>
<p>Thus will be the end of science, all because Whites surrendered their White Republic to the afrovoodoos through abolition, emancipation, the vote, miscegenation, Civil Rights, Affirmative Action, Multiculturalism and the Diversity Privilege.</p>
<p>There is a teleological end to all our madness, and we are right now witnessing a big leap forward toward that end.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care. If we Whites were really so smart, we wouldn&rsquo;t let a low IQ afrovoodoo race take everything away from us.</p>
<p>We have a flawed gene, and we should all discuss it openly. We are victims of our genetic inheritance that tell us to play fairly, but we forget to remind ourselves that those genes that came down to us were cultivated in a None Diversity, purely Northern European environment. These genes make us unsuitable for contact with other races who don&rsquo;t share that predominating gene of cooperation and high civilization.  Unless we are dominating and suppressing other races, we are committing suicide when letting them come around us and into our body politic. </p>
<p>We are doomed, and we deserve that horror lesson to come.  Nature has a justice of her own, and it is poetic.  </p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t be victims- we will be exhibits in the Hall of Fools.</p>

<p>In fact, I can see how focusing on the race and IQ can sidetrack very far away from the race-replacement issue in a public debate on immigration.</p>
<p>If I am wrong about this, someone here should explain why I am wrong about this.</p>

		<p>RE 18.. I recall meeting a Jewish man with aquiline nose, dark black curly hair, fair skin, and very very blue eyes. I didn&rsquo;t want to say anything ( I couldn&rsquo;t as he was doing a root canal on me)but I know the guy, who had a German name, was only partly Semitic. Someone once hypothesized that the German nation prior to WW2 was on average 25% Jewish by blood. So this guy, then, would have been quite commonplace. Too bad for all that the Nazis got so worked up by the Jewish influence in leftist circles. I don&rsquo;t know what the fate of Europe would have been today had less fear prevailed then. Probably much better.</p>
