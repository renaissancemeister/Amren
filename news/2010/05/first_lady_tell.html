<h1>First Lady Tells Illegal Immigrant&rsquo;s Daughter That U.S. Must &#8216;Fix&rsquo; System</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael O&rsquo;Brien, The Hill, May 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During a trip to an elementary school in Silver Spring, Md., with the first lady of Mexico, Margarita Zavala, Obama took questions from one young girl who said that she had heard &#8220;that Barack Obama is taking everybody away that doesn&rsquo;t have papers,&#8221; adding later that her mom lacks such paperwork.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to work on that. We have to make sure that people can be here and get the right kind of papers; that&rsquo;s exactly right,&#8221; Obama responded. &#8220;We have to work on that. We have to fix that.&#8221;</p>

		<p>By fixing the &#8220;problem&#8221;, that could mean anything from deporting the illegal alien to giving her and tens of illegals amnasty.Michelle didnt give any details and she was vague to the maximum,but what she really means is amnesty.</p>

		<p>The great thing about Obama (and his wife) is that they give lip service to these people but have a strong track record of not following through.</p>
<p>This is a HUGE advantage over Hillary Clinton.  We get all the perks of the stupid leftists endorsing issues like this (enraging most voters) but not the costs had they actually followed through with it.  </p>
<p>Like Obamacare, which will never see the light of day in actual practice, people will freak out over this.  And nobody will actually get amnesty. Had Clinton gotten elected, she would have been effective in making these things a reality.</p>
<p><br>
Makes me wish I&rsquo;d voted for Obama, instead of McCain.  Who would have though that the way to destroy liberalism would be by allowing them to get elected.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s less than a year ago that President Obama got caught red handed taking a &#8220;spontaneous&#8221; question from a young girl that turned out to be contrived beforehand so he could answer it and pretend to be talking off the cuff.<br>
Does anyone actually believe that an eight year old girl asked the first lady a question like this out of nowhere, with the cameras rolling? </p>

		<p>I have a suggestion for a fix, Mrs. Obama. How about immigration ENFORCEMENT? I know that&rsquo;s a bad word in Washington, but it sounds pretty good to the rest of us.</p>

		<p>Is this the usual way that the Obama&rsquo;s come up with ideas regarding policy change?</p>
<p>{snip}&hellip;.she had heard &ldquo;that <b>Barack Obama is taking everybody away</b> that doesn&rsquo;t have papers,&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought that was the actual problem, that not enough bodies were being <b>taken away</b>, by Barack Obama himself or whomever (this statement is making Barack <i>personally</i> responsible for the current injustices and hence the hero for eventually standing up and saying &ldquo;no more&rdquo;!  or &ldquo;not on my watch&rdquo;, &ldquo;let my people go&rdquo; etc.)<br>
And the &#8216;papers&rsquo; aspects has a real 1939 Poland sound about it, and then add in the sympathetic little girl child and you have a very well engineered message.</p>
<p>If this amnesty was given to all of America&rsquo;s illegal&rsquo;s, that sure would be a slap in the face to the States ability to self govern, especially those who are currently trying to legally enforce the federal immigration laws.</p>
<p>I feel that I&rsquo;m beginning to understand more so some of the circumstances to why your last civil war happened, also makes the <i>no tattoos of the confederate flag</i> in the military rule, make more sense now too.<br>

		<p>If it weren&rsquo;t for the passage of the 1965 Immigration Reform Act, the Democratic party-the nonwhite party -would hardly ever get elected. So unpopular is the Democratic party among NATIVE BORN WHITE VOTERS, that it has resorted to importing its voters for any number of nonwhite nations. This is just another way of saying that the Democratic party is waging a vicious race war against the NATIVE BORN WHITE MAJORITY</p>
<p>Barack Obama would be incapable of being elected if the US population was still 90 percent White like  it was before the passage of the 1965 Immigration Reform Act.</p>

		<p>Staged Staged Staged.</p>
<p>Please.  Give me a break.  How old was that little girl?  No girl her age says, &ldquo;that Barack Obama is taking everybody away that doesn&rsquo;t have papers,&rdquo;  Don&rsquo;t you just love how they had her say &#8220;Barack Obama?&#8221;  Saying Arizona would have been a dead give away that it was staged.  Gee, you sure are clever! (much sarcasm)</p>
<p>Without rehearsal and coaching there is no way children of that age know these things enough to comment at that precise of timing.  If her mommy really lacks those papers chances are the child doesn&rsquo;t even speak English.</p>
<p>Newsflash for you Michelle, these staged, fishing for sympathy, tactics may work on your fellow gutless liberals, but not me.</p>
<p>Nice try.  Maybe you should stick to dressing up and looking &#8220;glamorous&#8221;  for the MSM and corrupt heads of state.  </p>

		<p> The more non white third worlders that enter the U.S. the more it will ensure that no Republican will ever win a national office. All of our large states have sufficient numbers of minorities to guarantee national offices for Democrats. All the leftist commies need is a few more minorities in some of the other states to guarantee no Republican will ever win a national election. For that reason you should never vote Democratic. I noticed that Ohio always was Republican but I think it now has sufficient numbers of non whites to guarantee  a Dem victory in national elections. So long, Republicans.</p>

		<p>Obama lacks the intelligence and maturity to be president and nearly every member of his administration is patently unqualified to be cabinet members.  </p>
<p>They focus entirely on politicizing everything to fit their communist agenda while accomplishing no legitimate work for the people.  </p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t afford to wait for the next election to depose these wretched communist traitors&hellip; </p>
