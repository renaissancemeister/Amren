			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Patrik Jonsson, Christian Science Monitor, May 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Swedish cartoon artist Lars Vilks, who became the target of an alleged international murder plot for his 2007 cartoons of Mohammed as a dog, again angered Muslims Tuesday by showing an Iranian film that depicts the Prophet entering a gay bar.</p>
<p>When Mr. Vilks showed a scene from the film at Uppsala University in Sweden, a protester charged the dais and hit him, breaking his glasses. Police were forced to detain or pepper-spray some unruly members of the crowd as other protesters yelled &#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221;  &mdash;  &#8220;God is great.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Mr. Vilks, who has booby-trapped his own house and says he sleeps with an ax beside his bed, the right to unfettered speech  &mdash;  regardless of whether it offends Muslims  &mdash;  is a point of principle. &#8220;This must be carried through. You cannot allow it to be stopped,&#8221; he told the Associated Press, saying he wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to give the address again.</p>
<p>But the university apparently disagrees. Officials said they would &#8220;not likely&#8221; invite Vilks again because of the incident. In some quarters, the university&rsquo;s reponse is adding to concerns that violence and threats from some members of the Muslim community are effectively muzzling free speech.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;When it comes to depicting the Prophet, this has nothing to do with social issues or integration,&#8221; says Professor Klausen. &#8220;This is about a political movement by sectarian groups where [depicting Mohammed] has now become a primary trigger for political contention. The university pretty much told [Vilks] to shut up and go talk somewhere else, and I find that reaction very dangerous and problematic. It means that the extremists have achieved what they wanted.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>The Muslim viewpoint</b></p>
<p>Many Muslims would contest Klausen&rsquo;s assertions. Fundamental to Islam was the Prophet&rsquo;s turning of his followers away from the idol worship that characterized Arabia in the Seventh Century. For this reason, any depiction of any of the prophets  &mdash;  in either a positive or negative light  &mdash;  is strictly forbidden.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, American authorities arrested two American women, charging them with taking part in a plot to travel to Sweden and murder Vilks. Even before that plot was uncovered, Vilks had created a &#8220;panic room&#8221; in his house and booby-trapped some of his art with an electrical shock device.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Western outrage</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;By deliberately insulting Muslims in this already-charged climate the artist placed himself in danger,&#8221; writes Robert on Stockholm News, an English-language news site in Sweden. &#8220;Insulting people&rsquo;s deep-felt religious beliefs is not free speech .&nbsp;.&nbsp.; it&rsquo;s hate speech.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mac Turk responded: &#8220;We either have free speech or we do not. There&rsquo;s NO reason why any religion should be privileged, or given special immunity from &#8216;insult.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Klausen [Jytte Klausen, the author of the bowdlerized book &#8220;The Cartoons That Shook the World.&#8221;] contends that institutions self-censoring Islamic themes arguably hurts Muslims the most. &#8220;Now every time illustrations are picked for stories about this issue, we&rsquo;ll get pictures of Muslims burning a Danish flag, reacting violently, which reinforces the notion that this is what Muslims do continuously, which is not true,&#8221; she says. &#8220;This is not Muslims doing this; it&rsquo;s a global extremist movement that&rsquo;s doing it.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Any depiction of &#8216;any of the prophets&rsquo;?  They regard Jesus as a prophet.  Christians go further than endless depictions of Jesus, apparently forbidden to Muslims, with the Sistine Chapel&rsquo;s depiction of God.  So this outrage doesn&rsquo;t even make sense on their terms!</p>

		<p>Didn&rsquo;t &#8220;they&#8221;(not muslims) show Jesus as a homosexual and how about in a jar of urine and excretment? How about Mary as a harlot? But do Christians get upset? No, they are too foolish and stupid and dumbed down to ever do anything &#8220;improper&#8221;. As I have said so many times. Whites are the stupidest people on earth and the most naive and prone to indoctrination and altruism, especially the Christian variety.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s most alarming to me is the fact that the other students seemingly did NOTHING. Of course, the police where there, but if a group of roudy Muslims got up and started screaming Allahu Akbar (there&rsquo;s usually an explosion ten seconds after that), I would either attack back or run for the hills. I wouldn&rsquo;t just sit on my ass with a horrified look on my face.</p>

<p>Creating an imaginary schism between &#8220;free&#8221; speech and &#8220;hate&#8221; speech is another leftist strategy that has been repeated so much, people are parroting it without realizing it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>

		<p>Funny how grossly insulting Christianity isn&rsquo;t hate speech, or even mildly objectionable to our moral guardians.  Of course, Christians don&rsquo;t respond to such insults by murdering those ridiculing their religion, as do Muslims.  This sounds more to me like craven cowardice masquerading as sound moral judgment.</p>

 <br>
On the other hand, if you&rsquo; do grant such immunity to one religion  (Islam), then you&rsquo;re going to have to grant it to all.   Does that mean Scientolgy cannot be criticized?  Hare Krishna?  How about Satanism?  Wicca?  Voodoo?</p>

<p>Christian churches are filled with  statues of Christ.  And a great deal of  our heritage of  great Western art consists of such depictions. </p>
<p>Since Christ is considered by Moslems to be one of the prophets, would that justify them invading churches and museums to destroy such &#8220;blasphemous&#8221; art?   <br>
Will  the Pieta by Michelangelo and The Last Supper by Da Vinci  have to be condemned  as sinful portrayals of  a prophet?</p>

		<p>I think we waste valuable time and resources attacking symptoms.  For instance, Muslims, who allowed them to come here?  These are the people we should be focusing on.</p>
<p>If someone were to drop a hornets nest on you, you would first knock away the hornets, kill any you could, then you would not be concerned with hornets but with the person/s who dropped them on you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reading a book on McCarthy by Roy Cohn and the extent of communist subversion in America at that time was shocking.  Then McCarthy was demonized, ex-communicated and the whole plan marched on. Look at the total transformation of this nation over the last 60 years.  It is no accident.</p>

<p>Devout Muslims believe that the Sharia applies universally, to Muslim and non-Muslim alike.</p>
<p>This is what the supposedly &#8220;liberal&#8221;, &#8220;pluralistic&#8221; societies of the West are up against. The Muslims in their midst do not accept the authority of the civil law and government of the host society (except to exploit them temporarily in the furtherance of their own agenda), and wish ultimately (sooner rather than later) to replace them with Sharia and an Islamic Caliphate.</p>
<p>For more information, watch Robert Spencer&rsquo;s videos on YouTube (especially &#8220;Islam: What The West Needs To Know&#8221;), or read his books, and those of Serge Trifkovic, Bat Ye&rsquo;or, Oriana Fallaci, Ibn Warraq and &#8220;Fjordman&#8221;. </p>

Excellent observation, Richard.  Too many of us are like the foolish gardener who &#8220;weeds&#8221; his garden by stripping away the leaves but ignores the roots.  A week later, he comes back and the leaves have all grown back again! &hellip; ad infinitum.   We need to go after the ROOTS of the problem and not waste time plucking at the leaves.  </p>

<p>But not very long ago they did without even the provocation of insult.  They murdered as a perceived duty.  We must have ethics that go beyond religious dogmas, and this is where Christianity, at least the mainstream forms, has succeeded.  However, that success is a thin venir and is only due to the often criticized reason of Humanism.  And it often shows its tentative nature right here on the pages of Amren.<br>

You are correct!  It has NEVER been an accident. It was a PLANNED agenda to replace the demographics of America from White to black/brown and NON Christian.</p>

<p>Of course, which is when I travel to Dubai (once I can afford it), I won&rsquo;t bring along a collection of cartoons depicting Mohammed as a dog. However, last I checked Denmark was a Christian (well, I guess its more secular now) country, not an Islamic Sheikhdom.</p>
