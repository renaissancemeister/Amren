			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Arizona Republic (Phoenix), May. 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Boston City Council approved a resolution Wednesday that urges the city to curtail economic ties with Arizona by pulling investments, ending city contracts and halting purchasing agreements to protest the state&rsquo;s recently passed immigration law.</p>
<p>The resolution, passed by a voice vote, also asks city employees not to travel to Arizona for city business.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re asking that the people&rsquo;s money, the people of the city of Boston .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that their money (not) be used to support something like this,&#8221; said Councilor Felix G. Arroyo, who co-wrote the resolution with City Council President Michael Ross.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We have many issues before us now,&#8221; said Ross. &#8220;But we have to take a moment to speak out against the erosion of basic and fundamental civil rights wherever it occurs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ross said once city officials find out what investments Boston has with Arizona and Arizona cities, he might ask for a city ordinance to outlaw those investments.</p>
<p>Councilors said they had received a slew of angry calls from people  &mdash;  many of them prompted by area talk radio hosts  &mdash;  who support Arizona&rsquo;s law.</p>
<p>Councilor Ayanna Pressley said some of those e-mails trying to persuade councilors to vote against the resolution were written in &#8220;the most harshest and offensive possible language.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Washington, D.C., New York and Los Angeles are considering similar measures.</p>

		<p>To the city fathers of Boston: Until you&rsquo;ve lived in a city rife with kidnappings, murders, rapes, robberies, molestations, domestic abuses and all the crime that comes with the fixation on &#8220;diversity,&#8221; then MYOB. Thank God, this wasn&rsquo;t the atmosphere on December 7, 1941. We were attacked there and we&rsquo;ve been attacked here for the last twenty-five years with no one in Washingon willing to fight back. So, the people of Arizona have decided to defend themselves. Those who are protesting must be comfortable with people dying because their country didn&rsquo;t protect them. If the Boston police had caught the killer of Rob Krentz, they probably would have let him go rather than ask if he were illegal. God help Arizona and even the insanity of the  city council of Boston.</p>

		<p>I suppose they should cut ties with Mexico too, or maybe the Federal Government, the laws of the latter are merely echoed by Arizona.  I&rsquo;d never go to Boston anyway.  It&rsquo;s not even in a free state, ironic.</p>

		<p>I would hope that Arizona adopts an automatic reciprocal policy towards these cities.  Let&rsquo;s see who is hurt more. They would only be getting what they&rsquo;re asking for.</p>
<p>Btw, it would be interesting to see the cities and states almost coming to war over this issue&hellip; economic war, at least.  Does their action not intrude upon the freedom of interstate commerce   &mdash;   the regulation of which is a federal monopoly?</p>
<p>And incidentally,  it was made illegal to comply with the Arab boycott of Israel that existed some years ago.  Should not the same be done where a state of the USA is concerned?</p>

		<p>Under civil reciprocity isn&rsquo;t one state obligated to observe and respcet the law of another.  Also what about the federal commerce clause that is constantly used by D.C. and the Supreme Court to run all the states to the left.</p>
<p>I wish I were more knowlegable about this.  Would any poster here be more informed?</p>

		<p>     In 1976 Boston was ordered to integrate, codified as &#8220;busing.&#8221; Essentially, they refused to comply . After much violence they just walked away and voted with their feet, fleeing I guess to the suburbs . Last I heard, and it wasn&rsquo;t too long ago, Boston remains one of most highly segregated metro areas in the U.S. If all of this still holds true, then they&rsquo;ve got a lot of brass to be boycotting anyone .</p>

The people in Boston have no idea what the people of Arizona are experiencing with the influx of illegal aliens.</p>

<p>Were we rich, we&rsquo;d pay for their transportation to the front steps of the homes of everyone who signs in favor of the boycott.  Tell the illegals that the Bostonians want them and will take care of them.  Videotape what happens when they arrive and get the Boston Snob Treatment.  </p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ll check further,  you&rsquo;ll see that  the City Council President who wrote this  proposal  and pushed it through is most definitely NOT  from the same group as those resistant groups you refer to above. Read the original story.</p>

		<p>This is really scary.  What it amounts to is an act of war by one state against another - and for the &#8220;provocation&#8221; of wanting to enforce the federal law that applies in both states. Easy to see where Councillor Arroyo&rsquo;s (good old Scottish name!) loyalties lie. Partition seems to be the only option left, but I fear the chances of that happening are about the same in the USA as in South Africa.</p>

		<p>As different parts of there Unites States become racially dissimilar to other parts of the United States, there will develop irreconcilable differences. It will start with economic retaliation over immigration policy and affirmative action policy. Eventually there will be separation. But separation doesn&rsquo;t mean there won&rsquo;t be violent racial conflict between the racially different states.</p>
<p>The enormous question is this:how will millions of native born white Americans react to a massive loss of territory. How they react to this will determine whether or not their will be violent racial conflict within the borders of America.</p>
<p>I will so this with 100 percent certainty:  White Politicians who voted for race-replacement over the years are in very big trouble. But since they are sociopaths who are incapable of thinking about the long term consequences of their actions, they very likely do not understand that their race-treason will have very serious consequences.</p>
<p>The White politicians who are voting to impose these sanctions were voted into office by post-1965 nonwhites. These economic sanctions should be seen as a declaration of war by post-1965 nonwhites against the majority native born white American population.</p>

		<p>What does a place like Boston have in terms of being able to bring straight cash to a table to buy something Arizona has for sale anyway. As to divesture of sucurities with an Arizona connection, we can just chalk this up to Boston needing a pretext to sell off some of its investment portfolios for its own fiscal rearrangement of the deck chairs on the Titanic. Sell off after Thursday? Make our day Boston.</p>

		<p>Agree with the last post. Hypocrisy is essential reading for any liberal. Much of Boston is as anti-Hispanic invasion as can be imagined; think of the resentment the Hispanics engendered when they tried to outlaw the Irish displays on St Patrick&rsquo;s Day, yet of course nothing is to be said about their May 5th biggie. Given the strange and intoxicating emotional release liberals find when they self-disavow ( i.e. trash their own heritage) it isn&rsquo;t odd to see such a political move amongst Democrats in Mass. Sooner or later, though, the politics of cowardice and evasion takes its toll; no one but the brain-dead remain to applaud it. Those with sense and minimal courage abandoned the Dem party and voted Scott Brown in.  </p>

		<p>Boston official should gauge public opinion before beginning the boycott. Ask the people of Boston if they are against all border controls and regulation of entry into the US. If most people of Boston don&rsquo;t want any controls then proceed with the boycott. If the majority of Boston want at least some controls then there is no ethical basis for opposing Arizona&rsquo;s efforts. </p>

		<p>Being pursuers of radical leftist ideology, the MSM is so corrupt it will lie, exaggerate, ignore and inflate any news that is in opposition to their agenda.</p>
<p>These calls for boycotts are vigorously reported, but the don&rsquo;t really mean anything, mostly because there&rsquo;s really not enough people in opposition to this law.  The ones that are for it  amount to a good percentage of blacks and mestizos, a wee contingent of radical leftist whites, and an oddball, flake or misfit here and there.  It is the media that is making it sound as if this is some kind of huge movement that will bring Arizona to its knees.  But it will not. </p>
<p>What all these riots and chaos prompted by the president will do, however, is anger more rank and file Americans and cause them to become even more entrenched in their opposition to giving amnesty to a bunch of criminals who behave as criminals.</p>
<p>Frankly, I&rsquo;m delighted to see how things turned out.  The media harps about boycotts and any other lies it can think of, but what it stupidly has succeeded in doing is bring the majority of people more firmly against illegal immigration than ever.  It&rsquo;s back firing on them now, and it is back firing on this community organizer as well.  Every time he opens his arrogant mouth he loses a few more white voters.</p>
<p>And, he can&rsquo;t afford to do that if he wants his party to keep control of Congress in November. Such a pitiful type.  <br>

Why, out of all the posts on this article, and all the ranting against &#8220;minorities&#8221;, has no one mentioned the President of the City Council who wrote and pushed through this bill?

		<p>The Boston City Council has just shot themselves in the foot. They are the ones that will wind up being boycotted. Any rational American that believes we have a right to protect our borders from criminals and believes in our basic freedoms to have commerce with anybody we choose will &#8220;willingly&#8221; not ever have anything to do with Boston again. When Boston goes bankrupt and gets avoided like the &#8220;plague&#8221; the people can blame the City Council for their act of sheer stupidity and reckless Marxist behavior. The City Council wants to outlaw those who invest, or travel to Arizona which is totally illegal, goes against the Constitution, and is something that you would see only in a communist country, yet they have the audacity to talk about &#8220;civil rights&#8221;, what a joke!  You just can&rsquo;t fix stupid. </p>

		<p>I recently read where Robert Bennett was the first incumbant to be voted out of office in the current primaries, he being a republican, endorsed by the N R A. Should this be true that would mean that the anger at the dems everyone is so sure of, is not manifesting itself, since that means no dem has been ousted, even though every last one voted for the health scare fiasco This is exactly as I predicted in an earlier earlier post. The dumbpublicans are going to take it up the back side big time, I believe contrary to popular opinion they may in fact lose seats. Once again I ask, do you give up yet? Keep voting Democrat, and go buy some vaseline you WILL need it. John #22 Yes you are correct there are not Nationwide reciprocal carry laws, thanks once again to the democrats, therefore answering the previous reciprocal laws questions.</p>

		<p>7  &mdash;  loudmouth57 Your suggestion has to be the most sensible and practical one to show the residents of Boston what they are (may be) missing.  The illegals would welcome it as it would appear that they are being accepted in the USA at last and the Boston authorities could not legally offer any resistance as they publicly approve of illegals and the breaking of Federal laws.  Hoist by their own petards it could be said and overall, the cheapest solution while Arizona does its Federal/State duty of upholding the laws.  Just think, if all other States followed this example.</p>
<p>PS, I do not live in the USA but have done so working there legally in the 1960s and I love your country. I am now a &#8220;wrinkly&#8221; (age 72) retired in Spain where the illegal immigration is strictly policed.     </p>

		<p>This situation is getting more frightening every day. Up until now I never even another secession taking place but things have reached a point where this has become a very real possibility. The Federal Government is either unable or more likely unwilling to perform its most important function, namely the maintenance of our national security. To augment it ever growing power for decades it has been creating and cultivating a vast sociopath underclass both homegrown and imported that is sucking the very life out of society through dependency on entitlements and violent crime. Many of our major cities are fearsome havens, our public education system is failing, our justice system is hamstrung. Now states who have taken the matter of security into their own hands are being bullied. Could Arizona be the first state to vote for secession? Could Texas be next? Are we going to witness the creation of a new Confederacy, possibly preceded by another Mexican War?</p>
<p> On a recent trip to South Florida I was discussing these issues with a group of real many generation Floridians and their anger was quite palpable. Several of them remarked that although a surrender was signed at Appomattox, the issue has yet to be settled. </p>

		<p>What kind of business does the city of Boston do with the state of AZ anyhow?  It couldn&rsquo;t possibly be all that meaningful and I&rsquo;m sure there are private companies in Boston that sell goods and services to the state but the city council has no control over them and the city could be sued if they attempted to exert any.  This boycott is just a token measure that means absolutely nothing in the real world.  These city council members are cowards and even passed their resolution by a voice vote so there would be no official record of who voted for or against it.</p>

		<p>The United States may very well break up along racial-national lines. NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS are ging to be in for a very very rude awakening. They will be surrounded by hostile asian-race-based nation,muslim race-based nation,mexico and afro- carribean race based nation. The nonwhite population in these new race-based nations will continue to expand. All the garbage and pollution in these new nonwhite race-based states will make its way to the White homeland. There will be violent conflict over water to be sure. </p>
<p>Secessionist are living in a fanatasy land. There is ultimatetly only one choice:start the process of reclaiming White Territory. Quite frankly, I am very hostile to the idea of separation and secession..it is fundamentally a policy of suurrender. I think it is very far from obvious that a majority of NATIVE BORN WHTE AMERICANS-once they understand the full consequences of being surrounded by several hostile nonwhite race-based new nations within the borders of &#8220;America&#8221; will find this at all acceptable.</p>
<p>I really wish that the White Nationalists who are now pushing for separation-and secession, would  instead encourage their fellow NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS to fight back.</p>
<p>I will go a step further and state that the events in Arizona and possibly several other states with significant large White populations is a rejection of secession,undestood as a stage to the creation of several nonwhite race-based nations surrounding a White Nation.</p>

		<p>This is especially ironic because New England was against the Mexican War precisely because it feared the long-term effects on the nation. In other words, they didn&rsquo;t want to become an extension of Mexico, flooded by Mexicans.</p>
<p>Now, New England is taking exactly the opposition position!  Amazing.  This shows how far New England has fallen. In fact, it ceased to be &#8220;New England&#8221; a long time ago. They should be honest and stop calling themselves that.  They ought to re-name themselves New Megalopolis or New Diversitania.</p>

		<p>As a result of the massive influx of immigrants over the past several decades, Boston is on the fast track to third-world status.  Both the city of Boston and state of Massachusetts are facing severe budget shortfalls, largely the result of the state&rsquo;s rapidly changing demographics.</p>
<p>Most people I talk to in Massachusetts support the people of Arizona on this issue.  An &#8220;us versus them&#8221; mentality is starting to take hold (even in this liberal hellhole), with the Marxists and their colored foot soldiers on one side and the white middle class on the other.                  </p>

		<p>This is not a ban restricted at just Mexicans/Hispanics. SB 1070 is to restrict any immigrant (key word here) from entering illegally. The verbage in this bill does not use the terms Mexicans/Hispanics. It states IMMIGRANTS.<br>
When I travel to Mexico or other countries I have a passport that allows me to enter and leave legally. We Arizonans are asking the same. <br>

		<p>For such people as City Council President Michael Ross [check his story], it seems to be one of their non-negotiable conditions that the white majority of America MUST be dissolved and destroyed.  That is a basic requirement, beyond debate, and he/they will never feel safe or comfortable until it&rsquo;s done. Whites must be reduced to a harmless, impotent minority   &mdash;    just one minority among many.  For him, this is understandable. But for the rest of us, it is intolerable.</p>
<p>This is supposedly a country ruled by democratic procedures. But to him, this politician, the majority is a threat, and must be destroyed.  What sort of democratic procedure is that? It&rsquo;s democracy subverting itself!</p>
<p>He is not representing us!  He is pursuing the separate interests of a small, self-interested minority, but he is not concerned with &#8216;what is good for&rsquo; the rest of us.</p>

<p>That will be fun to watch.  Those hardy New Englander yankees will see most of California be turned into a third world narco state, along with NM, AZ, TX, and FL.  They will get the message in a hurry. If it can happen on the southern border, it can happen to us up here near islamicized multicultural Canada.</p>
<p>Maybe the good American yankee ingenuity and can do attitude will have a moment of self reflection and decide that conquering the South just to &#8220;free the slaves&#8221; was a very bad idea.  If the &#8220;Union&#8221; border with Mexico and Canada couldn&rsquo;t protect the Union from invasion and reconquest by the browns, then the yankees are sitting ducks, and they know it.</p>

		<p>Their silly &#8220;boycott&#8221; is going to be about as effective as a resolution that carries no weight.</p>
<p>I would caution all these radical leftist governments like Boston, San Francisco, et al, to stop and consider that they&rsquo;re already on the precipice of economic collapse and the last thing they need are the tea partiers in their states to boycott those things that offer the governments revenue, and the out of state tea partiers could bypass any trips to their whacko paradises.  </p>
<p>That would bring considerable hurt to them during times of declining revenue and calamitous financial shortfalls, but liberal dregs can&rsquo;t think in terms other than what their shortsightedness allows them, and, of course, if they were equipped with the necessary mental faculties to see ahead, they wouldn&rsquo;t be liberals to begin with.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the country is splitting apart right now.  It is the<br>
liberal policies that caused it all.  Every bit of it.  And it will be these same people that will bring ruin to themselves.</p>
<p>What will you do when the economy bottoms out and liberals are standing around with their hands out after their dastardly deeds are done, still blaming right wing tea partiers for the horrors that the liberals caused?</p>
<p>Speaking for myself, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be able to quit laughing for a long time&hellip;if I ever do.  And charity for these white dregs?  There is no such thing; however, I might pressure whatever government is left to buy them tickets to Africa. </p>
<p>The worst punishment they could get is to have to work the soil and get their hands dirty if they want to eat.  Working and sweating would be a fate worse than death for them, plus putting a well-placed fist in their mouths might cause them a bit of consternation too, since they could no longer run their mouths with stupid ideas aimed at trying to control other people lives with idiotic propositions of multiculturalism.</p>

		<p>Regulation of interstate commerce is a strictly federal matter, but the city of Boston can probably get away with this - the city is not attempting to regulate commerce with Arizona; it is merely refusing to participate in it.  That said, reciprocal boycotts are very likely, given the huge margin of support for the Arizona law both within Az and outside it.  The dingbats in Boston claim that &#8220;basic and fundamental&#8221; rights are being violated, and #3-Anonymous correctly pointed out that criminal immigration to another country is NOT a &#8220;basic right&#8221;, but the truth here is a little more bizarre from the Boston city council&rsquo;s standpoint.  Some 83% of wanted murder suspects in Maricopa county (the Phoenix area) are illegal aliens.  Is Boston now claiming that murder is a &#8220;basic right&#8221;?  This is a fair question, and leaves out the host of other crimes illegals are notorious for: drunk driving, driving without insurance, welfare fraud, social-security fraud, drug-smuggling, drug-dealing, sex-slave smuggling, identity theft, rape, child-molestation, kidnapping and so-on.  Are these basic rights as well?</p>

<p>Good news from Utah: Bennett booted<br>
By Patrick Cleburne</p>
<p>Utah&rsquo;s Republicans have had a fit of good sense and refused to re nominate 3-term Senator Robert Bennett Utah GOP convention rejects incumbent Sen. Robert Bennett By Kevin Bohn CNN May 8, 2010</p>
<p>Bennett, with a NumbersUSA career grade of C-, was bad news on immigration: the worst, in fact, of the entire Utah delegation.</p>
<p>It is a particular pleasure to see him go because of the arrogant way in which he openly scorned the views of his constituents in the 2007 Amnesty battle, as I noted in Utah&rsquo;s Bennett prepares to ignore, betray constituents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My public position is that I&rsquo;m reviewing the amendments,&rdquo; Bennett said Tuesday.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a ploy meant to defuse emotion. But here&rsquo;s what Bennett&rsquo;s staffers are not saying: he plans to vote for it.</p>
<p>The MSM reports on Bennett&rsquo;s demise are coy about what motivated his defeat. Treating the interests and preferences of his constituents with contempt, as on the immigration question, is a good starting point.<br>

<p>It is customary for states to honor reciprocity but is not required. They usually have written into law how that reciprocity will work.</p>
<p>AZ could simply declare that any states or any states with cities that are taking punitive actions not have that reciprocity honored.</p>
<p>What this usually comes down to is warrants, AZ could simply <br>
refuse to cooperate with them and not hold or extradite any folks from these states.</p>

		<p>Instead of railing at the city of Boston, we need to be asking how certain people like this &#8220;Michael Ross&#8221; manage to get to be President of the City Council, from which controlling position they can manipulate the entire city to serve their own ideological ends.  I have to question whether Mr. Ross truly represents the attitudes of the whole city of Boston; but he certainly does represent the minority views of himself and his own clannish clique.</p>

		<p>Agree with #40. Once race is established in the discussion of what makes or does not make a personal identity political, this discussion tends to spread without bounds. I don&rsquo;t foresee a good end for us in the USA, in the sense &#8220;us&#8221; is a non-racial universal identity. The history of the country is marked by a racial war, and the political structure of the country legitimates secessionist thinking. You have to wonder if the immigrants have a breakup in mind. Seems to me the Hispanic movement is not following civil-rights as a metaphor, rather &#8220;war&#8221;. Civil-rights movements have no population epicenter, no linguistic base, no flag, no geographic ambitions. </p>
