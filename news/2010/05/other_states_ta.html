<h1><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/may/10/other-states-taking-cue-from-arizona-illegals-law/">Other States Taking Cue From Arizona Law</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chuck Neubauer, Washington Times, May 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A controversial law passed in Arizona giving state and local police the right to arrest anyone reasonably suspected of being an illegal immigrant is catching on nationwide, with lawmakers and others in several states considering similar legislation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Metcalfe [Pennsylvania state Rep. Daryl Metcalfe], a Republican who introduced legislation last week modeled on the Arizona law, said his bill would give &#8220;every illegal alien residing in Pennsylvania two options: Leave immediately or go to jail.&#8221;</p>
<p>His bill would, among other things, give state and local law enforcement officials full authority to apprehend Pennsylvania&rsquo;s estimated 140,000 illegal immigrants and require law enforcement officers to attempt to verify the immigration status of suspected illegal immigrants. It also would make it a criminal offense for illegal immigrants to fail to register as foreigners or to have proof that they did.</p>
<p>South Carolina state Rep. Eric Bedingfield, a Republican, has sponsored a bill in that state allowing the verification of a person&rsquo;s immigration status and providing for the &#8220;warrantless arrest of persons suspected of being present in the United States unlawfully.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Bedingfield&rsquo;s bill also would target illegal immigrants who fail to complete or carry legal registration documents and would criminalize &#8220;hiring and picking up workers at different locations while impeding traffic.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said his constituents are concerned about illegal immigration and that he had received numerous communications from constituents asking when South Carolina would take the additional step as lawmakers did in Arizona. The bill, he said, has 20 to 30 co-sponsors and is pending in the House, but it might be difficult to get it to the Senate floor before the end of the session June 1.</p>
<p>In Oklahoma, state Rep. Randy Terrill said he and some other lawmakers still hope to pass a bill similar to Arizona&rsquo;s new law this session and &#8220;go beyond it.&#8221; Mr. Terrill, a longtime advocate for tougher immigration laws, said his group also would like the legislation to include tougher penalties for illegal immigrants caught with firearms.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Similar efforts are under way in Minnesota, Maryland, North Carolina, Texas, Missouri, Nebraska and Idaho.</p>
<p>Several political leaders, immigrant advocacy rights groups and others have said they will challenge the Arizona law as unconstitutional.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. on Sunday said the Justice Department is considering a federal lawsuit against Arizona&rsquo;s new immigration law. He told NBC&rsquo;s &#8220;Meet the Press&#8221; that the lawsuit could challenge whether the law would lead to civil rights violations.</p>
<p>The Arizona law is set to take effect in midsummer and authorizes state and local law enforcement officers to determine during lawful stops the immigration status of people for whom there is &#8220;reasonable suspicion&#8221; that they are in the country illegally. {snip}</p>
<p>Reasonable suspicion is a legal standard requiring that before someone is arrested or detained there must be reasonable belief that the person has been, is or is about to be engaged in criminal activity.</p>
<p>A recent Rasmussen Reports poll found that 70 percent of likely Arizona voters approve of the legislation, while 23 percent oppose it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Utah House Speaker David Clark said he expects an Arizona-type bill to be introduced next year when that state&rsquo;s legislature returns to session. Mr. Clark, a Republican, said Utah residents are &#8220;concerned&#8221; and &#8220;frustrated&#8221; about immigration and that Congress needs to act.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Utah, we don&rsquo;t have the right to deport anyone,&#8221; he said. {snip}</p>

		<p>Tennessee is the Loser State.  We had a chance to make English Only in Nashville, and all the blacks, Vandy professors, and White Evangelical Christians put a stop to it because it was exclusive and racist.</p>
<p>Tennessee needs more exclusive racism, not less.  We should pass the Arizona law, but won&rsquo;t, because we are the Loser State.</p>

		<p> Liberals reading this item in the Washington Times might say, &#8220;Ah, ha! All the people initiating this legislation are Republicans! That proves it&rsquo;s political!&#8221;</p>
<p> But isn&rsquo;t that as broad as it is long? Couldn&rsquo;t one say, conversely, that because no Democrats appear to be pushing such legislation, it proves that the Democrats refuse to take illegal immigration seriously because they see all these Mexicans as potential Democratic voters? Maybe if we had a law such as Mexico does, that limits the franchise to native-born Americans, the Democrats could be induced to see the &#8220;Brown Invasion&#8221; as the threat to America that it really is!</p>

		<p>I promised God that if more than 5 states considered enacting a law like AZ&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;d go to church for 4 whole Sundays in a row.  I was astounded to find a headline stating that TWELVE states had this type of a law up before their legislators!  So, guess where I was at 5:30PM last Saturday - yup, in Mass, at Holy Name of Mary Catholic Church.  Guess it won&rsquo;t hurt me to go for 3 more Sundays; I mean, I never said I was a GOOD Catholic&hellip;.</p>

Sounds great. But what does the wording mean at the end of the quote? You can legally hire these ILLEGAL workers as long as you dont impede traffic??</p>

		<p>What you are seeing here is the states in competition with each other.  A very important change has taken place in the US.  In the past, states could indulge in the multi-cultural agenda because wealth and prosperity were still available despite what they were doing and the consequences were spread evenly over the entire US.  People were willing to accept that via the abuse of our federal system because they still believed in that system.</p>
<p>What has changed is people, in general, no longer believe in the legitimacy of that federal system (thank you Obama).  On all levels, that lack of faith is being made manifest.  Eventually, it will be taken to its logical conclusion and the federal government itself will be defunded and taxes kept on the state and local level&hellip;.but that is the future.  Today, you have states all over the place looking to replace the federal way of doing things with their own.  The reason is simple.  They need to attract their tax base.</p>
<p>There is now heavy competition among states to increase their tax payer to liability ratio.  They need more tax paying citizens and less welfare/criminal costs in order to stay solvent.  They do this by controlling their taxes (individual tax payers spend less but are much more numerous) and improving their standard of living.  That means fewer criminals and low quality people.  And immigrants, especially illegals are the main source of both of these now.  Not much can be done about blacks (they have no place to go) but ALOT can be done about the immigrants.  Most will self-deport if you stop indulging their criminal behavior.</p>
<p>A state who gets rid of the immigrants is now far more attractive to productive tax paying citizens than one that doesn&rsquo;t.  That is the bottom line.  And it&rsquo;s the way those who have co-opted our federal system will be beaten back.  Although some people may like the fantasy of a multi-cult world, nobody wants to live with the reality of a multi-cult world.  When it is no longer possible to indulge the former without experiencing the latter, support for that way of thinking collapses.  That is now happening&hellip;..fast.</p>

<p>Well there you go.  And I bet if you had a similar poll in every state, youd get at least 60 percent or higher, perhaps even in California. </p>

<p>Mr. Holder, Ill let you in on the dirty little secret: no one cares!  They already are law breakers who have forfeited their own civil rights.  The invasion is endless; it has to be stopped at all costs. </p>

		<p>   If South Carolina approves an Arizona-like bill, then we will stop our petition to have that state&rsquo;s voting rights abolished.Of course this petition was started because of the obvious insanity of said electorate. This widespread insanity was proved by their election of lindsay graham. &#8216;nuff said.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m now living in PA but I lived in AZ for 7 years.  Mexican nationals had more rights than American citizens.  They drive cars that won&rsquo;t pass an emissions test nor do they have car insurance.  If an America is caught without insurance in AZ, the car is impounded immediately.  Do you think that is bad?  If you only speak English, you can expect to be discriminated against for employment esp. government positions.  70% of AZ&rsquo;s support the law.  AZ is also 50% Mexican so there are an awful lot of Meixcan Americans who also support the law but we won&rsquo;t hear of them.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this is true or not, but someone just told me that Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. on Sunday said the Justice Department is considering a federal lawsuit against states that attempt to enforce any law.  He told NBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Meet the Press&rdquo; that the lawsuit could challenge whether enforcing laws (such as laws against bank robbery, car-jacking, rape, kidnapping, murder, embellishment, etc.), might lead to &#8220;profiling,&#8221; and hence to civil rights violations.</p>
<p>There is no crime greater than &#8220;profiling,&#8221; and we will not stand for it.  </p>

		<p>There is a point people don&rsquo;t look at much. But the states remain sovereign. If a state wants to go against the fedgov, for the most part, they can. Of course, the govt. would react by witholding money from the offending state, but they still can do it. It&rsquo;s called &#8220;Nullification&#8221; (its been done before successfully). It&rsquo;s always there. Any governor can take steps to nullify a federal law. Will they do it is the question? It&rsquo;s my opoinion that sometime in the not too distant future, a state will take a stand on some issue against the fedgov. Most likely it will be the illegal alien issue, but it could be any one of a dozen things.</p>

		<p>Do you notice how they always call this a &#8220;controversial new law&#8221;?  In what sense is it controversial, if the vast majority of the (legal) American populace supports it?  How is it even new, if it&rsquo;s simply an attempt to actually enforce existing law?  A good friend of mine has asked me several times why, since all the polls she&rsquo;s seen show enormous support for the Arizona law, somehow the only people ever quoted or shown by the MSM are against it.  She can&rsquo;t be the only one being &#8220;mugged by reality&#8221; over illegal immigration.   </p>
