<h1>Pelosi Calls for Amnesty for Illegal Aliens</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nicholas Ballasy, CNS News, May 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Speaking at the Asian-American and Pacific Islanders Summit held at the Capitol on Wednesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for amnesty for illegal aliens in the United States, a proposal she called a  &#8220;path to legalization.&#8221; <br/>
 <br/>
&#8220;Hopefully, we will be moving toward comprehensive immigration reform that secures our borders, enforces our laws, protects our workers, honors family unification and has a path to legalization  &mdash;  so that we have certainty in our country and respect for the contributions that newcomers bring to us,&#8221; she said on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.</p>
<p>House Minority Leader John Boehner&rsquo;s (R-Ohio) office told CNSNews.com that Boehner &#8220;disagrees&#8221; with Pelosi&rsquo;s comments and thinks immigration reform will not pass this year.<br/>
 <br/>
{snip}<br/>
 <br/>
Speaker Pelosi also spoke about immigration reform last week on Capitol Hill at the Catholic Community Conference. At that event, she said she had asked Catholic bishops to speak from the pulpit about how immigration reform was a &#8220;manifestation of our living the Gospels.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The cardinals, the archbishops, the bishops that come to me and say, &#8216;We want you to pass immigration reform,&rsquo; and I say, &#8216;But I want you to speak about it from the pulpit,&rsquo;&#8221; said Pelosi. &#8220;I want you to instruct your, whatever the communication is  &mdash;  the people, some of them, oppose immigration reform are sitting in those pews and you have to tell them that this is a manifestation of our living the Gospels.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
{snip}<br/>
 <br/>
Speaker Pelosi voted against the &#8220;Secure Fence Act of 2006,&#8221; which funded the construction a 700-mile-long double-reinforced fence along the Mexican border. President George W. Bush signed the legislation into law in October 2006. Pelosi has favored amnesty for illegal aliens in the past but has not brought a bill that would provide amnesty to a vote in the House since she became speaker after the 2006 election. In 2004, when she was given the &#8220;Legislative Award&#8221; of the League of United Latin American Citizens, she said:  &#8220;We do not need a temporary worker program; we need a meaningful pathway to citizenship.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Look for this to pass much the same way the Federal Reserve Act did in 1913. They will likely try to rush something through when over half of congress is away from Washington, with a 10,000 page law that is &#8216;so necessary there is no time to actually read it.&rsquo;<br/>

And if she gets that, in 10 or 20 years the Nancy Pelosis of the world will be saying, &ldquo;We do not need citizenship or nations; we need a meaningful pathway to Global Governance and the free movement of labor anywhere in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which is why the Nancy Pelosis of the world must be stopped NOW and not 10 years from now. </p>

		<p>This woman is so far from reality.  She is so full of guilt.  Perhaps she can atone for her sins by giving away her vast wealth and living in a third world county.  Just by doing all that, she will have contributed greatly to humanity instead of playing this holier than thou game which have contributed to the downfall of this country.</p>

		<p>Pelosi is a blasphemous mocker who could care less than nothing about the gospel. I would not want to be in her shoes when judgement day arrives. I would hope the clergy would not listen to such garbage. Although many in the clergy are certainly worse than she committing adultry, homosexuality, and themselves claiming to represent GOD while dishonoring, and mocking HIM in the most horrific of mannerisms, and trampling on the blood of HIS SON the LORD JESUS CHRIST, theirs will surely be a far worse punishment, so sayeth the LORD, and yes it also says judge not lest ye be judged, and the apostle Paul also said: &#8220;know this that the Christians shall judge the very angels in heaven.&#8221;</p>

		<p> The problem is that the Catholic Church, dominated by extreme liberals like Cardinal Roger Mahoney of San Diego, were already doing this before Nancy Pelosi asked them to. And people wonder why the Church is dying? With prelates like Mahoney, the Church will soon be populated exclusively with vegetarians and college professors, together with hispanics unlikely to bring much to the collection plate. As the Bible says, As ye sow, so also shall ye reap!</p>

		<p>I used to believe the most dangerous woman in America was the Hildebeast (aka Hillary Clinton), then I started reading about this woman.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m convinced Demon Queen of the Abyss Pithius (aka Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi) is not only the most dangerous woman in America, but all around the most dangerous person, period!</p>
<p>Though I am not a Catholic (I&rsquo;m an agnostic), I find it laughable this woman presumes (as a Catholic) to tell other Catholics how they should vote, especially since she has already been publicly rebuked by her own archbishop AND THE POPE for her ultra-leftist views that run counter to her church&rsquo;s teachings.</p>

<p>Nancy Pelosi, like Barack HUSSEIN Obama, is a dangerous neo-Marxist who has no business being in government, especially at the Federal level.  1-Robert is correct: people like them will eventually destroy this country.</p>

		<p>As a Catholic, I am astonished at Ms. Pelosi&rsquo;s hypocrisy. She has ignored the Catholic bishops in the past on her support of abortion, yet she calls on the Church to offer an opinion on illegal immigration when it seems politically helpful to her! Please, California, vote this hypocrite out of office!</p>

<p>Exactly. She does not believe in GOD or the gospels or any such thing. That is my impression. NOR do any of her most devoted followers. They are good at trying to preach to the religious when they themselves are not only not religious, but anti-religious.</p>
<p>She and her &#8220;path to citizenship&#8221; group quote scripture while basically being a group of non-believers.</p>

		<p>What a foul thing.  What an embrace.  A sodomy activist asks the Church to do its bidding?  Isnt that what happened with all of the secret deviants that have infiltrated the church due to the ill-advice of liberal &#8220;theologians&#8221; from the 60s.  The church needs to be cleansed of these degenerates.  Show them the door.  They show no mercy in what they teach and inflame in the hearts of children. Shout them down and out of the church.  Shame hides in their every word.  Remind them of their naked perversion. Thats how they found themselves inside.  Look what they have done.  Look what we sleeping citizens have let them do.</p>

<p>&#8220;Camp of the Saints&#8221; by Jean Raspail. </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s disturbing is that Raspail&rsquo;s novel seemed to be apocolyptic a generation ago, but today seems to be what is happening on the six o&rsquo;clock news. </p>
<p><i>And if she gets that, in 10 or 20 years the Nancy Pelosis of the world will be saying, &ldquo;We do not need citizenship or nations; we need a meaningful pathway to Global Governance and the free movement of labor anywhere in the world.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>You are on to something. It&rsquo;s the old liberal one-world agenda. But instead of the UN running the show, you instead turn each Western nation into a mini-UN with people from all over the third world, each protected under the ideology of multicultism. <br/>
One wonders if a generation down the line that the concept of national sovereignty will have been rendered OBE by mass migrations and globalization.</p>

<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s shocking and disgusting to see the number of open traitors now occupying so many high positions in our government. They no longer even hide it.  When did this transformation come about?  </p>
<p>At one time, public officials used to consider it their sacred duty to enforce our borders and protect the USA&hellip;. not to look out for the welfare of the world at the expense of the USA. Now, they&rsquo;ve fallen in line behind the race-replacing  program of the right-wing globalists and the extreme left.  There has been a silent revolution that has taken place beneath our noses, and our officials ARE NOW BRAZENLY INFORMING US THAT OUR COUNTRY IS NO LONGER OURS, that it is our Christian duty to share it.  Such chutzpah! </p>
<p>When will these traitors be sent packing?</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>I agree with you, Robert, all but for one word.  I would not consider her an &#8220;idealist&#8221; but a very cynical and cunning politician.</p>
<p>Pelosi is a multi-millionairess, and one of the wealthiest members of Congress.  She did not get that rich by being an idealist. Her wealth (and her humband&rsquo;s) is derived in good part from the employment (and support) of illegal aliens.<br/>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p><b>Pelosi&rsquo;s Wealth Greater Than Other Congressional Leaders</b><br/>
(CNSNews.com) - Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is <b><i>the wealthiest of the top congressional leaders,</i></b> with total assets valued at somewhere between $30 million and $131 million, according to federal financial disclosure statements. <br/>
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/26zjs4r" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/26zjs4r</a><br/>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Nancy Pelosi&lsquo;s socialist views are what have kept her elected in San Francisco   &mdash;  - along with the flow of union campaign money. The staunch &ldquo;union supporter&rdquo; Pelosi has even received the Cesar Chavez Award from the United Farm Workers Union.  <br/>
Pelosi has received more money from the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees unions than any other member of Congress in recent election cycles.<br/>
But her $25 million Napa vineyards and winery, that she and her husband own, are non-union shops. The extra profit she earns is more than she gets from labor unions.</p>
<p>Loraine Stewart, a farmworker advocate with Napa Valley Community Housing, in a 2004 SF  Chronicle article estimated that half  the migrant labor force in the valley consisted of undocumented workers, without whom &ldquo;not one bottle of wine would get made here.&rdquo;<br/>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br/>
Pelosi and her husband have amassed a fortune approaching $55 million from real estate development and Napa Valley vineyard ownership&hellip;. it is a near certainty that part of [that] wealth is derived from illegal immigrant labor. Their vineyards use non-union labor to pick grapes and sell those grapes to non-union wineries.<br/>

<p>Sorry, but religious people have just as much right to influence public policy as secularists and atheists do.  Separation of church and state, first of all, is not in the constitution.  It is a dicta, Jeffersonian, I believe.  </p>
<p>The Constitution simply prohibits the government from &#8220;establishing a religion&#8221; or restricting the &#8220;free exercise thereof&#8221;.  That means the government can&rsquo;t official endorse any religion, or even religion in general.  Nor can it burden the practice of religion.  </p>
<p>That has nothing to do with individual voters applying their religious principles in the exercise of the franchise.  If you don&rsquo;t like it, debate it on the merits, but you have no right to simply tell religious people to sit down and shut up.</p>
<p>Religious people on this site don&rsquo;t bash the non-religious, please return the favor and don&rsquo;t divide us by religion.  That just weakens us.</p>

<p>By the way, it was God who instituted nations.  First we were separated by race (Shem, Ham, Japheth), then by language (Tower of Babel), and finally by land (in the days of Peleg was the earth divided  &mdash;  think Pangaea).  There was a reason for that.  The whites migrated to Europe, the Orientals to Asia, the blacks to Africa.</p>
<p>Wanting to preserve the white race is far from being a sin.  Wanting to preserve your nation and its heritage and culture aren&rsquo;t sins either.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Sorry, but religious people have just as much right to influence public policy as secularists and atheists do.&#8221;   &mdash;   Sofita</p>

Yes, they do have that right. Of course.   As they should.   But that applies to ordinary citizens and voters.  A politician   &mdash;   a political REPRESENTATIVE   &mdash;   occupying a powerful position such as Peolsi&rsquo;s, has the obligation to  <i>represent </i> ALL the citizens, and not use her position to favor a few or to impose her own views on all the rest. </p>
<p>Anyway, I don&rsquo;t even believe that she&rsquo;s being sincere about it. She&rsquo;s cynically trying to exploit this issue in order to favor her own political (and personal) objectives.</p>
