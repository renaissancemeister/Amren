<h1><a href="http://www.city-journal.org/2010/eon0514hm.html">Distorting the Truth About Crime and Race</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Heather Mac Donald, City Journal, May 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The New York Times&rsquo;s front page story this week, {snip} written by Al Baker, began with what the Times thinks is a shocking disparity: &#8220;Blacks and Latinos were nine times as likely as whites to be stopped by the police in New York City in 2009, but, once stopped, were no more likely to be arrested.&#8221; (The fact that blacks, Hispanics, and whites are arrested at the same rate after a stop undercuts, rather than supports, the thesis of racially biased policing, but more on that later.)</p>
<p>The Times&rsquo;s story includes a graphic breakdown of police stops by race: blacks made up 55 percent of all stops in 2009, though they&rsquo;re only 23 percent of the city&rsquo;s population; whites accounted for 10 percent of all stops, though they&rsquo;re 35 percent of the city&rsquo;s population; Hispanics made up 32 percent of all stops, though 28 percent of the population, and Asians, 3 percent of all stops and 12 percent of the population. The article details a host of other police actions by specific racial numbers, including arrests, frisks, and use of force.</p>
<p>But when the Times gets around to mentioning crime rates, more than halfway into the piece, it does so only because the NYPD raises them in its defense, not because the Times deems them independently worthy of note in a story on police stops. And it mentions them only as a form of reported speech, in the most generalized of terms: &#8220;Mr. Browne, the department spokesman, .&nbsp.;&nbsp;. said the stops mirrored crime  &mdash;  that while a large percentage of the stops involved blacks, an even larger percentage of violent crimes involved suspects described as black by their victims.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Only in 2007 did the Times disclose some actual black crime rates in discussing stop-and-frisk activity  &mdash;  though as usual, only as an aspect of the NYPD&rsquo;s defense of itself, and only by attributing those crime rates to what the police &#8220;say,&#8221; as if they were a matter of opinion, unlike the stop-and-frisk rates, which the paper reports as a fact so indisputable that it does not need a source. That 2007 slip has never been allowed to reappear, however; the disclosure of crime rates has been purged from all subsequent Times stories on the NYPD&rsquo;s stop activities. The actual numbers convey the shocking magnitude of the city&rsquo;s crime disparities with a vividness that a mere generalized statement about a &#8220;larger percentage of crimes than stops&#8221; cannot, which is why the numbers are almost always left out. The actual crime rates reveal that blacks are being significantly understopped, compared with their representation in the city&rsquo;s criminal population, another reason for omitting them from the paper&rsquo;s reporting.</p>
<p>Here are the crime data that the Times doesn&rsquo;t want its readers to know: blacks committed 66 percent of all violent crimes in the first half of 2009 (though they were only 55 percent of all stops and only 23 percent of the city&rsquo;s population). Blacks committed 80 percent of all shootings in the first half of 2009. Together, blacks and Hispanics committed 98 percent of all shootings. Blacks committed nearly 70 percent of all robberies. Whites, by contrast, committed 5 percent of all violent crimes in the first half of 2009, though they are 35 percent of the city&rsquo;s population (and were 10 percent of all stops). They committed 1.8 percent of all shootings and less than 5 percent of all robberies. The face of violent crime in New York, in other words, like in every other large American city, is almost exclusively black and brown. Any given violent crime is 13 times more likely to be committed by a black than by a white perpetrator  &mdash;  a fact that would have been useful to include in the Times&rsquo;s lead, which stated that &#8220;Blacks and Latinos were nine times as likely as whites to be stopped.&#8221; These crime data are not some artifact that the police devise out of their skewed racial mindset. They are what the victims of those crimes  &mdash;  the vast majority of whom are minority themselves  &mdash;  report to the police.</p>
<p>You cannot properly analyze police behavior without analyzing crime. Crime is what drives NYPD tactics; it is the basis of everything the department does. And crime, as reported by victims and witnesses, sends police overwhelmingly to minority neighborhoods, because that&rsquo;s where the vast majority of crime occurs  &mdash;  by minority criminals against minority victims.</p>
<p>The Times&rsquo;s analysis, by contrast, which follows in lock step with the New York Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights, assumes that policing should mirror census data. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} A good place to start would have been a police-community meeting in East New York, Bedford-Stuyvesant, or other any high-crime area. Here is what the reporter would have heard from community members: &#8220;We want more officers, we want more arrests, we want the dealers off the corner.&#8221; The police cannot respond to these heartfelt requests for public safety without generating disproportionate stop data that can be used against them in a racial profiling law suit. If a grandmother in a public housing project calls the police about the young drug dealers in her lobby, a properly responsive officer is going to question the youths hanging out there. The officer is not &#8220;profiling&#8221; the youths; he is responding to a citizen request for action. But the NYCLU and the Center for Constitutional Rights will tally all those stops against the police as evidence of &#8220;racial profiling.&#8221; The police aren&rsquo;t getting calls from Riverdale residents about the young gang members congregating on the corner or in their lobby. If they were, the police would respond the same way that they do in Harlem: by finding legal grounds to stop the gang members and let them know that they&rsquo;re being watched. {snip}</p>
<p>Contrary to the Times&rsquo;s assumption, the fact that an identical proportion of stops of whites and blacks  &mdash;  10 percent  &mdash;  results in an arrest or summons strongly suggests that the police use the identical quantum of reasonable suspicion in stopping whites and blacks. The police stop a greater absolute number of blacks because the overwhelming majority of crime, suspicious behavior, and calls to respond to crime occurs in black neighborhoods.</p>

		<p>If every crime was covered by the news and the truth about the race of the criminal and the victim mentioned, as just information, in a neutral manner, the US would be a very different place today.  The opinions people hold would be very different.</p>
<p>Much the same could be accomplished simply putting various webcams all over detroit and showing the unedited footage 24/7 on one cable TV channel.  It would also be the highest rated show on TV.</p>

		<p>This sort of disengenuous reporting is par for the course with the entire MSM, which will go to almost any lengths to deny that blacks and Hispanics comprise the criminal class in this nation.  Members of both groups, though blacks lead the statistics, commit the great majority of crimes in this nation, and almost all the violent crimes.  Were police not paying particular attention to them they would be utterly derelict in their duty.</p>
<p>Only in such clearly misguided and troglodyte publications as AmRem is the truth about crime in this nation addressed.  All other media outlets can&rsquo;t summon the courage to speak the truth, not only on crime but on other racial phenomena.  And they wonder why they&rsquo;re steadily losing market share, circulation, and viewers.</p>

<p>Now, now, Miss MacDonald, are you not forgetting that &ldquo;racism&rdquo; sees more blacks subjected to capital punishments, than their white counterparts?</p>
<p>It is a give and take here: More blacks kill and rape whites, but such is &ldquo;enriching;&rdquo; more Hispanics, confuse ignoring borders, with free entrance into comprehensive boarding houses; and most other &ldquo;enrichers,&rdquo; see the whole game as &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; to them, because they have questionable access to white concubines and a bed and breakfast to violate them in.</p>

		<p>So, the real story is that &#8216;minorities&rsquo; are committing crimes, often against whites (according to The Color of Crime 53% of the time, to be exact); while the public story sold to the community is that police are racist against and harassing people of color in our racist society filled with too much hate and profiling. And as any good liberal organization, the Times and their employees get to present this information while posing as fact-checkers getting to the hidden truth, fighting against all odds no matter the cost. </p>

She also points out what I thought we already knew&hellip;.when the cops are called to deal with the black violence, they are held accountable for showing up to do their job.

		<p>Of course, the correct response to these complaints would be to withdraw NYPD officers from neighborhoods where blacks and Latinos live, until the numbers of arrests, stops, searches, etc. are on parity with the other parts of the city. (Are there any other parts of NYC?)</p>
<p>And the poor, unfortunate black and brown people who live in these areas will live in the worst sort of savagery&hellip;..primative and lawless, vicious, and cruel neighborhoods.</p>
<p>It seems the do-gooders had rather the ordinary black and brown citizens live in terror and pain, rather than have the worst of them incarcerated for their misdeeds against their own people. What kind of life do they have in mind for these people&hellip;.and why do the Liberals hate them so much?</p>

		<p>All what Heather Mac Donald writes about has been said and known for year&rsquo;s by anybody with sight and half of a brain. But it gets so futile after a while, sort of like talking to a wall. In NYC the Mayor, Governor, Police Comm, DA&rsquo;s all known the truth, yet like the coward&rsquo;s they are they dance around the subject and the problem just goes on and on. One can only imagine though what life in NYC would be like if the population was only made up of White&rsquo;s and Asian&rsquo;s. A check of the crime figure&rsquo;s gives a pretty good hint.</p>

<p>One could argue that the liberal is not really about helping kids in Africa, or in this case, in Harlem NY, they are concerned with something a lot closer, you. It&rsquo;s not about helping someone unseen, it&rsquo;s about hurting you, there in person. And being able to do this, that&rsquo;s what explains the &#8216;success&rsquo; of liberal ideas no matter the results. </p>

		<p>Black criminals shoot off guns the way children play cowboys and Indians.  And, of course, most of the people who get hit are other blacks.  Black criminals also rape about as indiscriminately, the victims often being in their eighties or nineties.  (&#8220;We had sex&#8221;, they&rsquo;ll claim!)  <br>
About the only thing non-blacks (and law-abiding blacks) can do is just stay away from ghettos and avoid strange black men.  But the liberals and their MSM enablers continue to drum that blacks are no more dangerous than whites or Asians.  At least 1/3 of all rapes on white women are by black men, but we&rsquo;re constantly told that fear of black rape is an old myth from slave days!  Hopefully, most people glean the true facts from everyday observation, but there are too many naive young people who don&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>it has been depressingly obvious for a long time now that the talented contingent of blacks it out of the ghetto a long time ago, and that there isn&rsquo;t much untapped potential left inside it.</p>
<p>LetÄs face iut: ghetto life is so unspeakably awful that anyone who can get out, is out.</p>
<p>Heather Mc believes passionately that if single moms are the root of all the bl community&rsquo;s problems - wh/ begs the question: why are bl men almost never adequate fathers (citizens, employees&hellip;). </p>
<p>natural differencs between the races renmains unthinkable for her.</p>
<p>hence her unrealistic expectations: marry &#8216;em all up and await the miracle: the black ghetto transformed into suburban Conn!!</p>
<p>what she really believes remains a mystery&hellip;.</p>

		<p>The Corporate Media, of which the New York Times is a flagship, is nothing but the military-style propaganda machine of the Globalist Banksters. Everything said or even unsaid in the Corporate Media is a lie or distortion scientifically designed as a tool of population management and social engineering.  Since racial tensions has been one of the most if not the most effective weapons in undermining Western civilization coverage of it is going to be the most manipulated.</p>

		<p>there is no need to wax ecstatic of Ms. Mac Donald, while she does not shill for the libtards like many journalists out there, she does shill for the Big Government and big law enforcement. And ultimately the high tech, paramilitary style police force that she loves so much will threaten the life and liberty of patriotic Americans a lot more than any black or latino banga could ever dream of, regardless of who happens to be the puppet in the White House.</p>
<p>Also, I have serious doubts about her intellectual honesty or lack thereof. E.g. this big article <a href="http://www.city-journal.org/2010/20_1_chicago-crime.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.city-journal.org/2010/20_1_chicago-crime.html</a> about the urban decay and crime in Chicago inner city makes a single profound conclusion - black teenagers do crime because they &#8220;lack fathers&#8221;. No other reasons and issues to consider, apparently, it&rsquo;s all about those &#8220;fathers&#8221;. If you ask me, this is just plain lie and shilling for &#8220;compassionate conservatism&#8221; type of programs.</p>
<p>I dunno, maybe right-wing atheists are as proficient in lying on behalf of whoever pays them as the left-wing ones. And maybe the non-atheists lie too&hellip; One way or the other, Ms. Mac Donalds is to the Bushies/Cheneys what Goebbels was to Hitler, just more low key. Old doc Joseph may have been a nice intelligent chap, but lying on behalf of evil for a living is not a nice thing to do.</p>
