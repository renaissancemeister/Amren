<h1>Canada: Must Address Worker Shortfall</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kevin Doyle, Construction Digital, May 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Regina businessman Wayne Morsky, now serving a one-year term as Chairman of the Board of Directors for the Canadian Construction Association, is sounding the alarm for the need to address a growing shortfall in construction workers across Canada.</p>
<p>As a large number of workers approach retirement age, fewer are entering construction and the ancillary specialty trades. Construction Digital often speaks with companies that have implemented innovative in-house solutions such as mentoring programs designed to allow young workers to work with and be trained by one nearing retirement.</p>
<p>However, that won&rsquo;t address the big picture as Morsky says Canada will need more than 300,000 new construction workers within seven years. He said the active recruitment of young people  &mdash;  particularly young aboriginal people  &mdash;  should be a big part of the solution to finding new workers to fill vacancies and to replace retirees.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Saskatchewan, we are looking at a (construction) worker shortfall of more than 6,200 employees,&#8221; Morsky told the spring meeting of the Saskatchewan Heavy Construction Association. &#8220;We must enhance the industry&rsquo;s efforts in promoting careers in construction to our youth, particularly to Canada&rsquo;s First Nations, where the median age is 27.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aboriginal Canadians have been part of the strong and proud history of this industry and we must find a way to get them re-engaged in construction if we are to meet the future labour challenges,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Immigration of skilled workers could be another part of the solution, Morsky said. However, he said Canada&rsquo;s immigration system &#8220;is no longer construction-friendly and does not appear to be headed for significant retooling in the near future.&#8221;</p>
<p>MORE IMMEDIATE CONCERNS</p>
<p>Morsky mentioned there is serious concern that government support for infrastructure projects will be reduced as the economy improves and as efforts to control budget deficits intensify. Canada faces an infrastructure deficit (of repairs or new construction that needs to be done) which some people believe could be in excess of $200 billion, Morsky said.</p>
<p>He warned that a decision to cut back public funding on road, water, sewer, bridge and other infrastructure projects as the economy improves would be a repeat of mistakes made in the past that have created the existing infrastructure problems.<br>

		<p>&#8220;young aboriginal people&#8221; are never the answer. Being from this area for over 40 years I can confidently attest that this &#8220;group&#8221; is usually the main part of our problems. Intentionally unemployed, chronically engaged in criminal activities, uneducated, comprising 72% of our correctional system while making up only 10% of our population, and a significant drain on our social service system. The only things that I have seen local aboriginals excel at is making children out of wedlock and without finance, and complaining that white man is responsible for all thier ills.</p>

		<p>Canadian developers are eager to follow Spain, Ireland, and the United States into a housing bubble, with money spewing everywhere for acres of hastily built subdivisions.</p>
<p>The public fight is for more foreign workers to build houses. Behind closed doors the developers are pressuring government for more immigrants to fill those houses.</p>
<p>Without mass immigration, their would be no construction worker shortage.</p>

		<p>So, rather then letting the free market do it&rsquo;s work.. they think we need to import workers from the third world?</p>
<p>The entire REASON we have these infrastructure deficits is because all the money is being spent on communist social engineering projects instead.</p>

		<p>Not said is that whites are being routinely denied access to these jobs&hellip;..so they stop applying.  Discrimination, not lack of employees is the reason for the labor shortage.</p>
<p>This is a manufactured problem designed to manipulate people into accepting more immigration.</p>

		<p>There would be no shortage of construction workers (if, indeed, there really is one) if Canada were not flooded with immigrants.</p>
<p>Everyone involved knows that there is a snowball&rsquo;s chance in Hell, of &#8216;re-engaging young Aboriginals&rsquo; in Construction.  This, as other posters have noted, is merely a ploy for admitting more third-worlders, to &#8220;do the work that Canadians won&rsquo;t do&rsquo;.  Why the millions of immigrants already in the country aren&rsquo;t doing that work is a question that, of course, will never be asked.</p>

		<p>Forty years ago, on a cross country trip, met a Canadian at a rest stop.  We had quite a discussion about America and Canada.  The main conversation, and the main conclusion, was that the &#8220;black&#8221; problem WE had, was an identical &#8220;aboriginal&#8221; problem in Canada.  What we saw as black behaviors, criminality, and welfare entitlement mentalities, were identical in Canada, but of an aboriginal nature.  Seems nothing there had changed, nor here, except to have gotten worse.<br>

		<p>How about hiring based on ability to do the job, instead of race?</p>
<p>Oh, wait, that&rsquo;s racist&hellip;.</p>
