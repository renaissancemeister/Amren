<h1>Europe Faces Pressure to Pay Slavery Reparations</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dave Clark, AFP, May 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Historians and anti-racism campaigners are to urge the countries that oversaw and profited from the Atlantic slave trade to recognise it as a crime against humanity, opening the way for reparations.</p>
<p>Next week, activists are to send a letter to the leaders of Britain, Denmark, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain asking them to recognise the trade as an historic injustice a century and a half after it ended.</p>
<p>They have already convinced France to do so.</p>
<p>The European Memorial Foundation for the Slave Trade will launch the appeal at the French Senate on May 10, backed by the French historian Louis Sala-Molins and John Franklin from the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are several reasons for this, including its symbolic value, to restore the memory of this crime against humanity,&#8221; Karfa Diallo, chairman of the foundation, told AFP.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s also a question, shall we say, of justice,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The continuing problem of racism in a Europe that now has an ethnically diverse population that could be precisely traced back to the 16th and 17th century texts justifying and codifying slavery, he argued.</p>
<p>&#8220;Racism and discrimination persists in Europe. Young people of Caribbean and African ancestry are victims of it. And we know, historians have shown this, that racism was born in this story.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It has found allies in other cities of Western Europe that grew wealthy on the profits of the trade, from Bristol in England to Porto in Portugal.</p>
<p>And now it wants other European states to follow France in recognising that the slave trade was not just a historical tragedy, but a criminal act that has enduring social consequences in Africa, the Caribbean and Europe&rsquo;s melting pot cities.</p>
<p>France passed a law in 2001 recognising slavery as a crime against humanity and the then president Jacques Chirac declared May 10 as a national day of remembrance for the victims of slavery.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we accept that it was a crime, then there should be reparations. All crimes deserve compensation for victims and punishment for perpetrators,&#8221; argued Diallo.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;d like to see the creation of an international memorial fund, that would support a School of Memory. A fund managed by the United Nations,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The school would teach the history of the slave trade to descendants of victims and slavers alike, he added.</p>
<p>While European nations now accept that slavery was an injustice, governments have fought shy of offering compensation. Some Europeans argue it is impossible to put a price on the suffering of slaves long dead and of regions of Africa that weren&rsquo;t then even states.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Europe owes a part of its capital to those that suffered,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So far, only the slavers have been compensated. In all the colonies, when slavery was abolished, states decided to compensate.</p>
<p>&#8220;For as long as there are no reparations to the descendants of the victims, we remain in a situation of extraordinary injustice, which is that we paid off the slavers. That&rsquo;s hard to accept in the 21st century.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Does it work the other way?  Do the Muslim nations pay reparations to European countries for the more than 1 million white slaves they took over the centuries?  <br>
Muslims were also the prime slave hunters in Africa during the days of slavery in the U.S.   The Muslims need to pay reparations to all the African nations where they captured and sold slaves.</p>

		<p>Good. Let Europe suffer from the afrikan curse.  Nothing good has come out of Europe since the Renaissance. I demand that all White Europeans pensions (declining pensions) be hit with an explicit and increasing &#8220;Slavery Reparations Tax&#8221; that is shown as a monthly deduction from their pensions checks.  Whites need to learn the consequences of not forcing afrikans to stay in afrika.</p>

		<p>The amount of effort it takes to read this article and not want to throw up is immense. White &#8220;nations&#8221;, can&rsquo;t even call them that anymore, will be paying forever for the so called sin of slavery even though every nation from the beginning of time has been in the slavery business. From the Egyptians to the tribes of Africa, namely the Bantu, conquering neighbouring tribes and turning them into slaves. </p>
<p>Hm, why don&rsquo;t they make Turkey pay Romania, Poland, Hungary, Greece and all the other European countries for their slave trade? Maybe the descendants of the black elite that sold their fellow blacks to Arab slave traders should also pay reparations. What about all the indentured servants of America? Who will compensate their descendants?</p>
<p>Hey I know, why not make the Arab nations hand out oil for free for their involvement in the slave trade? That might just get those jihad warriors a wee bit upset, so maybe not. Oh heck, we can&rsquo;t forget about the Chinese now can we. Not with their modern day slavery workshops. All those rich Chinese business men and their western counterparts should be made to pay every person suffering under this tyranny. All 1.4 billion of them. </p>
<p>Seriously though I could go on and on, if I did a little research into slavery but I would get no satisfaction from it, so I won&rsquo;t. More to the point, but don&rsquo;t they have something more important to worry about? Like the economies of these countries?! Guess not. They should get Greece to pay some aswell, you know, to cover the cost towards its bail out. I wonder how well that would go down with the Greek public?</p>
<p>Slavery ended over 150 years ago. Any white person alive today had no choice in the matter. None at all. Seriously black people, time to get over it.</p>

		<p>I am not surprised that France was the first to cave. </p>
<p>I have long maintained that the true French lost effective control of their country long ago. They have been overwhelmed and they have very little say today. Especially in the large cities, France has been invaded (lately) by swarms of non-European immigrants, who are visably noticable. But long before that, France was similarly populated by less noticeable white immigrants (the current president being an example of this). For two centuries, since the Revolution, France has not sustained its own numbers and has lived off immigration. It was easier to import labor, they thought. Their present predicament is the direct result. It should serve as a sobering lesson of what happens when you think you can re-stock your dwindling population with immigration, without adverse consequences, and that &#8220;anyone can be a Frenchman&#8221;.  Such folly!</p>

		<p>Great, here we go! Once the weak willed Europeans cave in and start giving money to those claiming to be victims of the legacy of slavery, the American race hustlers like Sharpton are going to be demanding the same. Blacks are always looking for the easy score and they&rsquo;ve found it with White guilt and shakedowns. Reparations will tear this country apart. Once money is handed over, Blacks will expect it on an annual basis. Since they&rsquo;ll never reach equality with Whites, they&rsquo;ll continually whine that they didn&rsquo;t get enough money. Just thinking about the implications makes me nauseous. </p>

		<p>Ok, maybe after North Africa and the Islamic world pay Europe for white slavery, which was common in the ancient world.  White slaves extracted from Europe didn&rsquo;t survive as a people; they were absorbed into the gene pools of their captors.  Most nations were enslaved at some point.  It&rsquo;s funny how some have prospered and even forgotten the enslavement of their kinsfolk, while others think they suffer its legacy and deserve a payment.  Those seeking reparations likely have a higher living-standard than their ancestors did prior to slavery, and the irony is that this quality of life has been facilitated by the very people at whom they point the accusatory finger.  Slavery is in the past.  Don&rsquo;t go to a foreign continent and blame the natives, none of whom owned slaves, for not giving you their livelihood, land, and women. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a White American.  I would like reparations from Africa for  their having sold people into Slavery in the first place.  If they would have said - &#8220;Nope, we&rsquo;re not selling any of our people to the Europeans.&#8221;, Slavery in the new world would never have taken place.  I believe what they did was a crime and that their actions have caused irreparable harm to me. By the way, is this &#8220;School of Memory&#8221; going to be located in the center of Africa where it may actually make a difference in today&rsquo;s world?  How about putting it in the middle of some Islamic nation where again, it may actually do some good?</p>

		<p>Africans&rsquo; role in profiteering from slavery needs to be prominently featured in any discussion of reparations. African American studies professor Henry Louis Gates Jr:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did slaves make it to these coastal forts? The historians John Thornton and Linda Heywood of Boston University estimate that 90 percent of those shipped to the New World were enslaved by Africans and then sold to European traders&rdquo; (&ldquo;Ending the Slavery Blame-Game,&rdquo; New York Times, April 23, 2010).<br>

<p>Well all their economies are doing so well, I think they should pay reparations.  About 10% into the disbursements they&rsquo;re funds should be setting right about zero.</p>

<p>All significant European colonization took place after or during the tail end of the Italian Renaissance.  So I&rsquo;m just trying to understand what you mean by your statement.  Sounds to me like you are writing off western civilization after 1500.  Maybe that was your intent?</p>
<p>With the financial situation of Europe right now I can&rsquo;t see this passing, much for the same reason it doesn&rsquo;t in America.  $$$  (don&rsquo;t have the Euro sign on my keyboard). </p>
<p> Also how about Great Britain&rsquo;s role in ending the slave trade?  Do they have to pay as much as Portugal or Spain who traded slaves much longer?  Do you see the can of worms that could be opened up with this one? One thing for politicians to let old, dead, black Lawyers pass the bar in Pennsylvania, but quite another to pay out large sums of money.  Everybody could sue everybody over their dead ancestors.  What about mixed raced people?  I&rsquo;m sure the Pakistanis (hate calling &#8216;em Asian like English newspapers) in England would want a slice somehow.  Could Indians and India sue England?  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure in China this would only find itself in the cartoon section of the newspaper.</p>
<p>The sad fact is that such idiocy is only seriously discussed in the west!</p>
<p>OF course if our governments keep printing out money in 10 years we could give them a trillion and it would be less than the paper it was printed on.  Don&rsquo;t send them a trillion dollars worth of paper; what would they do with it?  Kindling? </p>

		<p>Does Europe have a money to pay with?  The best thing Europe could do would be to start a population trade with the middle east and Africa.  Europe would take in our remaining whites in exchnage for the blacks and muslims returning to their homelands.</p>
<p>Using European engineers and Turkish/Arab/Black labor we  would help them rebuild there infrastructure.   The remaining Europeans would work on recovering Europe and having babies.</p>
<p>I truly think that the Japanese will find a way to survive their demograohic decline and reverse it so as to achieve a stweady state population.  The Chinese demographic decline would actually help China if they could get a better balance between male and female births.  Even if the excess male situation continues they can always be employed in the military and mass engineering projects where much labor is employed.  AS lomg as they keep close tabs on the population trends and pln for them I think a numerically declining China would be an even wealthier China.</p>

		<p>Fine.  I&rsquo;m gonna be itemizing my bill to England for the enslavement of my Scottish ancestors during the Highland Clearances.  I&rsquo;ll estimate the value of the lives of various many-times-great aunts and uncles who were worked to death on plantations in Virginia and the Caribbean, while I&rsquo;m at it.  </p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m wondering&hellip;. Who is going to pay for the hundreds of thousands of children currently enslaved by Africans in Africa and Haiti?  And do those &#8216;Slave Checks&rsquo; go to the currently living slaves, or to their masters?</p>

&#8220;What about all the foreign aid Europe has paid? Doesn&rsquo;t that count?&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
And that&rsquo;s the barest beginning of it.  What about all the free education we&rsquo;ve given them, and the transfer of technology? This has all been without charge. In short, we&rsquo;ve lifted them up from savagery, given them our inventions and taught them the and arts sciences which took our own ancestors thousands of years to discover and develop. There  was no charge; it amounted to a gift.  If we had actually charged them for this MASSIVE transfer of technology (instead of leaving them to figure it out for themselves), they would be still fumbling and they would be paying for generations. </p>
<p>On the other hand, what did they do for us, other than picking the cotton and making the beds?  At the bottom line, when you add it all up, THEY should be paying US.<br>

<p>I agree with #11. Foreign aid is a form of reparations. Most African nations have been freed for about a half century. It is time to end the foreign aid and let the Africans stand on their own.</p>

		<p>As a descendent of whites who suffered in the slavery of Reconstruction, I too would like reparations for the injustices suffered by my white ancestors at the hands of the Radical Republicans.  If only today&rsquo;s blacks could see true history as does H.K. Edgerton, the former NAACP chapter president who changed his attitude about the War Between the States and slavery after finding out he had ancestors that voluntarily fought in defense of the Confederacy from Northern invasion.  www.southernheritage411.com.  One can find true history about slavery right there at his site.  He marches all over the south, educating blacks on the true history of that time, not the revisionist history that pollutes the federal indoctrination centers (public schools).  </p>

		<p>&#8216;Shamelessness&rsquo; is another black characteristic to go with the all the other negatives.<br>
Of course, the hard-nosed, unsentimental and proud East Asian would see the fact that his ancestors didn&rsquo;t fight back hard enough and allowed themselves to be enslaved as a cause of deep shame and humiliation.</p>

		<p>AS the non-white population of Europe increases the greater the political power to demand and get &#8220;reparations&#8221;, which would be just a wealth grab away from the whites - Justice has nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>The irony is that the Black descendants of slaves now in Europe are actually beneficiaries of the slave trade which put them in Europe rather than in wretched Africa.</p>

		<p>These people have a very narrow view of slavery.</p>
<p>Both the ancient Greeks and Romans practiced slavery. The Ottoman Turks, Arabs and Barbary Pirates grew fat off the slave trade. The Vikings owned slaves. The Egyptians had many slaves. Black Africa had no problem with the practice of slavery. Nearly every slave brought to the Americas were sold to the slave traders by black Africans near the coast. (Visiting tropical Africa was certain death for white men due to the incidence of diseases.)</p>
<p>In fact, there has been slavery for much of human history. It simply is not possible to compensate everyone descended from slaves&hellip;.black, white, brown, red or yellow.</p>
<p>It seems the French are only interested in compensating the descendents of slaves that were black.<br>

		<p>Yes, the enslavement of Africans was certainly a crime.  I say this crime should be reversed by sending all those blacks back to Africa (with some money and skills to get them started on their new lives). But the victims were not only Africans; they are also the millions of whites who have been forced to live among the descendants of those African slaves ever since.  Many of those whites have been murdered, raped or mugged.  Many of them must live in fear.  Who is going to compensate them?</p>

		<p>Me thinks all money shall be given to those wonderous African leaders who just need a little help to get their countries and people back on the track to becoming equal or greater than anything us stupid white racist rednecks could ever dream about. I mean, here we are complaining about a few billion euros and we simply forget about all the suffering the black man has gone through over the past 450 years due to blantant white racism which honestly still continues to this day. We should really be grateful that they don&rsquo;t murder us all for simply reminding them of our racist existence. Havn&rsquo;t you guys heard, everything the whites &#8220;created&#8221; was stolen from those mightly intelligent blacks. Therefore this is just giving back to the rightful owners, nothing more.</p>
<p>Whats that you say? This is a race realist publication that deals in truth rather than unsubstantiated lies and &#8220;diversity is strength&#8221; dogma. Huh, how can this be?

		<p>If we agree on the principle that all crime deserves reperations, lets start with black crime statistics in the US. All the rapes murders and crimes perpetrated by blacks should surely come under this definition. I think the black community owes YT a huge debt on this basis alone. A point another poster made is that in actual fact the blacks in the west are very fortunate to even be here. Perhaps if they&rsquo;re so upset with having been taken from Africa we should help them all to get home.</p>

		<p>The idea of European reparations is, quite simply, an insult.  As Greece and Germany struggle to reach a financial agreement to save the continent&rsquo;s financial system, non-Europeans are asking  EU countries for money.  </p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t blacks display even a modicum of respect?  Bono and U2, Irishmen, pleaded for African debt forgiveness.  The G8 countries have pardoned much of Africa&rsquo;s debt.  People like Bob Geldolf have held events like LiveAid for African peoples and nations. </p>
<p>And what, exactly, would African nations intend to do with the money from reparations? Let&rsquo;s suppose for a minute that the request wasn&rsquo;t a preposterous one.  Let&rsquo;s suppose Africans got their way, and their (well, our) money. What would they intend to do with it? </p>
<p>Any organization or people approaching others for aid usually has to have some sort of project proposal to accompany the request.  Can the Africans come up with a coherent and legitimate &#8220;bill of particulars&#8221; for the money they feel they are owed?  </p>
<p>Doubt it. </p>

		<p>Agreed, slavery was a heinous institution and reparations should be paid to anyone who was enslaved by their former slave-masters. Let all former slaves be allowed to sue their former masters for every penny. As for history, it is immutable, no one is responsible for the actions of their forefathers, were they then Britain could quite rightly sue the United States for being deprived of its rightful and legally held colonies, Austria could sue Mongolia for the actions of Gengis Khan, Eastern Europe could demand the whole of Turkey in reparations for the horrors inflicted upon them by the ancestors of the Turks today. All that is history, better get over it.</p>

cerveaux de bois (brains of wood). Perhaps, as the French think, this is an anglo-saxon trait, as anglo-saxons are known for their stiffness.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve done enough for them by teaching them our White English language at White Tax paid for public schools. We&rsquo;ve done enough for them by letting them access our Whites Wombs and stealing our White Bloodlines and better IQ genes than they could have created on their own.  </p>
<p>We owe them nothing more. Send them all back and charge them an Exit Tax to compensate us for the robbing, raping, and murdering with which they have cursed our White Nation for these hundreds of years.</p>

		<p>In entry #24 ghw argues that foreign aid and transference of the arts of civilization should have a reparative value to the descendants of the enslaved.</p>
<p>&#8220;In short, we&rsquo;ve lifted them up from savagery, given them our inventions and taught them arts [and] sciences which took our own ancestors thousands of years to discover and develop.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
I have no quarrel with the general tenor of this proposition.  But in the interest of accuracy, ghw should have written something like this: </p>
<p>   We&rsquo;ve given them the arts and sciences of civilization that SHOULD HAVE RNABLED THEM to transcend savagery &hellip;<br>
 <br>
However, in view of the level of civilization prevailing today in most American cities blessed with majority black populations, his initial clause seems a little wide of the mark, if not downright delusional.</p>

Good. Let Europe suffer from the afrikan curse. Nothing good has come out of Europe since the Renaissance. I demand that all White Europeans pensions (declining pensions) be hit with an explicit and increasing &ldquo;Slavery Reparations Tax&rdquo; that is shown as a monthly deduction from their pensions checks. Whites need to learn the consequences of not forcing afrikans to stay in afrika.<br>
