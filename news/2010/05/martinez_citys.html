			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mary Tuma, Impact News (Austin), May 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A unanimous vote by Austin City Council on Thursday effectively ended all of the city government&rsquo;s business-related travel to and investment with the State of Arizona. The resolution, sponsored by Mayor Pro Tem Mike Martinez, comes in response to the Arizona&rsquo;s controversial immigration bill that compels law enforcement officers to detain people if they have &#8220;reasonable suspicion&#8221; they are in the country illegally.</p>
<p>Martinez underscored that the city will sever ties with the state, but not individual businesses. Currently, Austin has no contracts or investments with the Arizona government.</p>
<p>With the exception of emergency-related events, city employees will no longer travel to Arizona for educational training, like conferences or technical assistance. This year, 45 employees traveled to Arizona, and five will head there during May. According to a city memo, these commitments were made prior to passage of the immigration law.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tim Lucas, an opponent to the council&rsquo;s resolution, said Arizona had taken a proactive step to enforce valid laws that federal authorities are not.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think more of this country needs to stand behind Arizona on this,&#8221; said Lucas, a resident of both Austin and Arizona. &#8220;It is getting out of control there with kidnapping and crime. What is happening there is going to happen here soon, and people will regret not supporting the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Members of the Austin Immigrants Rights Coalition were present to show their support for the council. {snip}</p>

		<p>Conveniently, Los Angeles is boycotting everything Arizona except electric power from the nuclear power plant in Arizona.  My grandfather always said that if you&rsquo;re going to do something, do it right and do it all the way, or don&rsquo;t do it at all.  My advice to LA is to stand up for Hispanic power and don&rsquo;t take any electric power.</p>

<p>A majority of Americans know this which is reflected in the polls supporting this law. </p>
<p>The people are starting to speak their minds and it appears their legitimate concerns are going to have to be addressed or politicians are going to be losing their jobs and the media will lose any remaining credibility.<br>

		<p>&#8220;A strong message?&#8221;  Baloney.  A meaningless message is what it is.  AZ could give one less about whether Austin, TX supports it or not.  The only reason Austin took that step is because they&rsquo;ve got a Hispanic pro temp mayor; if s/he was white or black, there wouldn&rsquo;t be any message to quibble over because both whites and blacks oppose illegal immigration.  This is a self-aggrandizing piece if ever I heard one.</p>

&gt;&gt;&gt;Why didn&rsquo;t Austin just roll out the red carpet and invite all the huddled masses of persecuted undocumented workers and their anchor baby citizens to come to Austin?</p>
<p>Please take no offense, but you dont know anything about Austin - it HAS rolled out the red carpet &amp; much much more. It is a sanctuary city, one that does all it can to suppress the wonderful doings of these people. Austin is a liberal enclave in this &#8216;red state&rsquo; and overrun with tree-huggers and illegal slime alike. UT, in all its diversified glory, is here along with every type of interest group one could imagine. When thinking of Austin&hellip;.. that is&hellip;. Austin, TEXAS - forget about your perceptions of Texas. When parts of the US falls to the brown hordes from down south, we can blame Washington - when Texas falls &hellip;. we can blame Austin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful geography and good economy aside, Austin is enough to give a conservative ulcers. Blacks &amp; neo-Mexicans are running wild &amp; never sentenced accordingly, many schools have charter programs that instruct students in both English &amp; Spanish ( so the &#8216;English Learners&rsquo; can keep up ), their saying is &#8216;keep Austin weird&rsquo; and their most famous person is a transvestite named Leslie.</p>
<p>No &hellip;. you just cant make this up folks.</p>
<p>Austin pushing this meaningless boycott comes as no surprise to many of us down here in these parts.</p>

		<p>6 WR:</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great to hear that the Texas legislature wants an SB 1070, but there is one huge roadblock in the way.  I&rsquo;ll give you a hint:  All the professional right wingers were snookered by his rhetoric, but I wasn&rsquo;t.  And now that he&rsquo;s won his election, and there&rsquo;s no more elections that matter for him anyway for another four whole years, he can go back to being the globaloney Mexico-loving artist that he always was.</p>
<p>You get three guesses, but I think you only need one.  </p>
<p>Texas, you got Rickrolled.</p>
<p>As an aside, for all of her other faults, I would have voted Kay Bailey Hutchinson in that election, because she was the only one of the three major candidates who was for E-Verify.</p>
<p>As another aside, I was listening to my recording of Rush&rsquo;s show today.  Rush has been standup (in as much as a lamestream conservative can) on the SB 1070 issue.  He even let some caller today rattle on, and he sounded like he would be a typical poster here at AR.  </p>
<p>However, Rush said something which was both hypocritical, and got my mind to thinking about a nightmare scenario for SB 1070 supporters:  Jokingly so, Rush said today, &#8220;why not simply just abolish the border?&#8221;  The part that was hypocritical about him saying that is that he supported NAFTA, and part of the NAFTA treaty technically weakens the US-Mexico and US-Canada borders, for the purposes of &#8220;free trade.&#8221;  So, by his supporting NAFTA, so much so that NAFTA supporter Al Gore called Rush &#8220;a prominent American&#8221; in Gore&rsquo;s NAFTA debate with Ross Perot, Rush essentially did abolish the border, in sorts.</p>
<p>Then I started thinking further:  Here is a way the open borders amnesty crowd is going to try and knock down SB 1070 in the courts   &mdash;   NAFTA.  Unfortunately, treaties supersede the Constitution itself and every state law.  I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if some leftist group is scouring the text of the NAFTA treaty looking for some conflict with SB 1070.  If one is found, then the courts will have to nullify SB 1070 or the part of it that conflicts. </p>
<p>What might preclude that is that this is an election year, and the Democrats might not look very good trying to campaign in the rust belt with the notion that they&rsquo;re using the treaty which is partially responsible for the economic depression in Michigan and Ohio to let more cheap labor Mexicans into the country.</p>

		<p>This incident has done more to wake up white America than most anything has.  I think it&rsquo;s great!</p>
<p>Everything that the anti-immigration groups always constantly warn about is on the television for everyone to see.  I&rsquo;ve talked to many people, and they&rsquo;re outraged more about the Mexicans putting their flags up, wearing them, etc., than anything in the last 50 years.  Nothing else could have made them that mad.</p>
<p>Also all the text book anti-white rhetoric that is no more than pure propaganda that insults whites and unifies non-whites has been declared illegal by Arizona.  That too drew more attention to the subject than anything else could have done, simply because the law was an Arizona one.</p>
<p>But the one hilarious thing of all this brouhaha concerning the Arizona illegal immigrant law is that Los Angeles is boycotting Arizona.  Like California has any money to spend.  Hahahaha! They&rsquo;re bankrupt and its SPECIFICALLY because of the drain on their money by illegal aliens.  The one thing that could have saved them is if they had enacted the Arizona law 20 years ago.  The poor fools STILL haven&rsquo;t learned their lessons and they deserve to collapse economically.  And they will.  The government stimulus will not save them.  It will only delay the inevitable.  They&rsquo;re on the way out with BIG, BIG TROUBLE in their pitiful future.</p>
<p>Texas is doing better than about any state in the union&hellip;.BUT&hellip;.that won&rsquo;t last long.  They&rsquo;re losing revenue too, and they&rsquo;re going to have to start cutting budgets by the Fall of this year at their present rate of decline.  Wait until the howling starts there.</p>

		<p>Somehow I&rsquo;m sure Arizona will be impressed by Austin&rsquo;s &#8220;strong message.&#8221; As a Texas resident of some 30 years, I&rsquo;m ashamed of the airheads in Austin, our state capitol.</p>
<p>Texas has been severely impacted by illegal immigration for decades. Supporting these parasites every which way. You see them at the welfare offices, lined up waiting for the office to open. At the hospital ER facilities. Our public schools hopelessly dumbed down by the million or so half-witted brown children.</p>

They were too stupid, collectively, to appreciate the threat posed by illegal immigration.

		<p>Since I live within spittin&rsquo; distance of Austin, I would like posters to know that most Texans stand with Arizona&hellip;I certainly do. We have a governor who rushes out at election time with all sorts of promises to secure the border. His edicts are issued from his office in a sanctuary city. Please consider the source and remember the last name of the Mayor Pro Tem. That should speak volumes. Go Arizona! </p>

		<p>#5 is right. I have lived in Houston for over 20 years. Austin is a state of mind - a sick one. It&rsquo;s where Houston kids, raised by the state-run media, go to college - to have their &#8220;learning&#8221; rooted for life. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s unfair to call UT Austin the Berkeley of TX and one of the only reasons I still - though rarely - visit is to float the Camal with friends I still think can be saved.   </p>
<p>Even in Houston one can see the occasional &#8220;Keep Austin Weird&#8221; bumper sticker. Weird, indeed.</p>
<p>I think the reason Rick Perry has &#8220;denounced&#8221; the AZ &#8220;immigration (sic)&#8221; law is because it&rsquo;s an election year and he feels a need to play it carefully. I am still voting for him.     </p>

		<p>The sanctuary cities and their states are indeed heading for massive budget trouble.  Colorado has really hit the skids, and even Colorado Springs - not a sanctuary city the way Denver is - has a budget cliff approaching next year.  One can only wonder about Denver&rsquo;s fiscal condition.  I won&rsquo;t even drive through the city &amp; county anymore - I take highway 470 West around Denver to Golden to get to Boulder.  Cities in this much financial trouble can be expected to have pressured their police to issue more traffic citations, and they probably will not allow motorists the usual five mph &#8220;cushion&#8221;.  If there is a sanctuary city near you, &#8220;don&rsquo;t shop there&#8221; was the old rule, but &#8220;don&rsquo;t even drive through it&#8221; has to be a new one.</p>

		<p>To Schoolteacher:<br>
It is a myth that many went to great lengths to spread.<br>
Especially Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and his brother Allen.</p>
<p>&#8220;This [Supreme] Court has regularly and uniformly recognized the supremacy of the Constitution over a treaty.&#8221; - Reid v. Covert, October 1956, 354 U.S. 1, at pg 17.&#8221;</p>
<p>Treaties do not override the Constitution, do not have the power to amend it and can be set aside by Congress or the states.</p>
<p>Now, if we are stupid enough to believe the lie and allow it to happen, whether it is &#8220;constitutional&rsquo; or not really doesn&rsquo;t matter does it?</p>

		<p>11 Schoolteacher and 20 Anonymous:</p>
<p>From Article VI:</p>
<p><i>This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.</i></p>
<p>Meaning that treaties &gt; state laws and constitutions.  </p>
<p>Sen. John Bricker (R-OH) tried but failed in the 1950s to amend the U.S. Constitution to prevent treaties from being used to dilute civil liberties.  Now, could he have been reacting to the Dulles bravo sierra you mentioned?  Maybe.  However, U.S. Senators aren&rsquo;t given to paranoia and chasing phantoms.  Maybe he wanted to play it safe.</p>
