			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), May 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Catholic schoolgirl has been branded a &#8216;truant&rsquo; by her teachers after she refused to dress as a Muslim for a school field trip to a mosque.</p>
<p>Staff had ordered 14-year-old Amy Owen and her classmates to dress in headscarf, wear trousers or leggings and keep her arms covered for the compulsory visit to the mosque after it was arranged to promote &#8216;community cohesion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Parents at the 1,100 pupil Ellesmere Port Catholic High School in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire were also told they were each required to make a £3 contribution towards the trip for all Year Nine students.</p>
<p>But when Amy refused to dress in Muslim attire for the visit to Al Rahma Mosque in Toxteth, Liverpool, staff warned her about rules and said refusal would mean non attendance which would then be marked down as an &#8216;unauthorised absence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a stern letter to her family with words in block capitals and underlined, the school&rsquo;s headmaster Peter Lee said the visit was &#8216;as compulsory as a geography field trip.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He added: &#8216;There are two reasons for these visits. One is that the scheme of work in religious studies REQUIRES children to have knowledge and understanding of other world religions.</p>
<p>&#8216;The second is that the school is REQUIRED to promote tolerance respect and understanding. This is known as community cohesion. A failure to do this could result in an unwelcome inspection judgement. None of us would relish that.</p>
<p>&#8216;Whilst I may not require you to pay for this I must require your child to participate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is believed up to ten other families from Amy&rsquo;s Year 9 classes also refused to dress as Muslims and were marked down in the truanting register.</p>
<p>But Amy&rsquo;s mother Michelle Davies, 34, a home help said: &#8216;It&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re putting a gun to your head  &mdash;  either you go to a mosque, or you&rsquo;re marked down as an unauthorised absence on your record  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s it no two ways about it.</p>
<p>&#8216;It&rsquo;s like they are saying she is playing truant for not wearing a head scarf. If the trip had been without the leggings and the headscarf, that would have been fine but I wasn&rsquo;t having my daughter dressed in the Muslim way.</p>
<p>&#8216;There are some parts of RE lessons that children who are Jehovahs Witnesses don&rsquo;t have to attend because that&rsquo;s part of their religion and the fact is Amy is Catholic and not a Muslim.</p>
<p>&#8216;She&rsquo;s proud of her school uniform and what it represents and she should be able to wear it like she would on any normal school trip.</p>
<p>&#8216;She likes to learn, she takes history and she is really interested in it, she wants to learn, but she can do that her classroom without changing the way she dresses.</p>
<p>&#8216;I even did some research on the internet about non-Muslims attending mosques and it says you don&rsquo;t have to adhere to the dress code.</p>
<p>&#8216;I also fail to see how a three-hour trip to a mosque is of any educational value to a Catholic when she can learn about the Muslim faith in the classroom.</p>
<p>&#8216;I can guarantee that if there were ten Muslim girls coming to our school it would adhere to what they wanted, because that&rsquo;s their faith, their religion, their dress code.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The school claimed it had arranged the trip in accordance with diktats sent down by Oftsted and the Roman Catholic diocese and said it to abide by a &#8216;strict dress code.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Davies who has two other children said: &#8216;No sooner had I objected to the dress code, I got a phone call from her head of year saying I don&rsquo;t see what the problem is, it teaches them respect. I said to her, is that not my job and your job as a school?</p>
<p>&#8216;Then she asked it was a problem with the cost, and I told her not to patronize me. I said it was for religious reasons. I&rsquo;m not a devout Catholic, I&rsquo;ve never claimed to be but my daughter is a white, British Catholic girl  &mdash;  not a Muslim girl, therefore she is not adhering to a Muslim dress code.</p>
<p>&#8216;The next thing Amy was in Mr Lee&rsquo;s office with three other kids being told it was a compulsory trip. He gave me a parent consent form, but I didn&rsquo;t give my consent and I was told it would be an unauthorised absence.</p>
<p>&#8216;I&rsquo;m so angry  &mdash;  in particular with the letter Mr Lee sent with bits underlined and words in block capitals. And also, you can&rsquo;t tell me that by making some year nine kids attend a trip to a mosque is going to make his his OfSTED report look better.</p>
<p>&#8216;I had to send a letter in to the school explaining why Amy was absent, and I explained exactly why Amy wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>&#8216;What really infuriates me is that if she wore leggings to school, she would be told to take them off because they&rsquo;re not school uniform.</p>
<p>&#8216;If Muslim girls came to Amy&rsquo;s school, the school would probably allow them to wear their leggings and head scarf because it is respectful. If they were told to remove them, there would be uproar.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another parent Kirsty Ashworth, of Ellesmere Port, whose daughter Charlie Sheen was due to attend the trip said: &#8216;I didn&rsquo;t see the educational benefit of it and I can&rsquo;t see how it would help her get a job or anything like that.</p>
<p>&#8216;I&rsquo;m not racist or anything but I send my daughter to an English speaking catholic school, so I don&rsquo;t see why she should dress as a Muslim.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A spokesman for the school said: &#8216;In keeping with accepted good practice we are pleased to provide students with an experience of a visit to a Mosque and the chance to talk and question a representative of the community which it serves.</p>
<p>&#8216;This is an exciting and for many, a unique opportunity to learn at first hand how Islamic practices and beliefs map against their own.</p>
<p>&#8216;We hope to provide other experiences to further our students&rsquo; appreciation and tolerance for faiths and culture as opportunities present themselves, as all good schools will do in the name of education.&rsquo;<br/>

		<p>Headmaster states there are two reasons for the visit. One is to learn about other religions. Yea right. Learn that Muhammad ordered his followers to kill all non believers is something that is NOT going to be taught. Instead they will taught a lie. They will learn the exact opposite of what it means to be a muslim. </p>

I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll be one of many saying &#8220;Bravo!&#8221; for this mother refusing the Dhimmi status the elites tried to impose upon her. And although I&rsquo;m not Catholic (or even religious at all), I also applaud her for unapologetically describing her family as &#8220;white, British and Catholic.&#8221; But what I&rsquo;d like to know is: faced with an endless supply of PC outrages like this one against our white children, why don&rsquo;t MORE white parents react like this Michelle Davies? </p>
<p>Quoth the Multicultist: </p>
<p><i>&lsquo;This is an exciting and for many, a unique opportunity to learn at first hand how Islamic practices and beliefs map against their own.</i></p>
<p>If Christian students <i>really</i> need &#8220;to learn how Islamic practices and beliefs map against their own&#8221;   &mdash;   and I for one would argue that there&rsquo;s no compelling reason that they do   &mdash;   such comparisons can be accomplished with some Googling, or a decent encyclopedia. The face-to-face aspect of actually visiting a mosque is entirely unnecessary for this learning. The up-close-and-personal field trip to the mosque will reveal no information not readily available in reference works   &mdash;   but it WILL provide an opportunity for some <i>taqqiya</i>-spouting imam to propagandize on the wisdom of Islam to impressionable young infidels. </p>
<p>And THAT, of course, is the point of the whole exercise. <br/>

		<p>Got to give some respect to this girl. Don&rsquo;t ever back down on what you believe. However, looking at the picture posted on the article, I don&rsquo;t think either her or her mother will win any beauty pageants. </p>
<p>Back to the article. If she does not want to dress up as a Muslim, then she shouldn&rsquo;t have to. However, if she chooses not to dress according to the mosque dress codes then she shouldn&rsquo;t be entitled to go on the trip. Sounded fair to me, that is until the school decided to punish her for not willing to do what she is told. </p>
<p>I would be an extremely proud parent if this were my child, even when faced with punishment she still stuck to her guns. Sometimes a criminal mark against your name can be a boon. Just ask Mandela. </p>
<p>In the coming future I see many more such anti-white, anti-Christian rules at schools, universities, public areas and just about everywhere. We are under attack and simply trying to convince our enemies that they are wrong will no longer work. Time to get creative ladies and gents. Playing by our enemies rules will only lead to our destruction. Democracy is not a friend, but a corrupted ideal. Time to ditch it and embrace Nationalism as was intended by your founding fathers.</p>

		<p>Not as strange as it seems. Mother Theresa spent her time worrying about Hindus &amp; Moslems in India (I guess White People don&rsquo;t need any help.)</p>
<p>..it appears that many White Catholics (Theresa was some sort of Albanian) are more worried about non-Christian non-Whites, than they are of their own kind. <br/>

		<p>The Catholic establishment continues it&rsquo;s downward slide, abasing itself by groveling before the muslims. At least this woman has some sense of dignity and pride that they haven&rsquo;t been able to bully her out of. I&rsquo;d like to have seen all of them stand up to this degrading exercise but I guess people have been conditioned to be increasingly craven these days, over there as well as here.    </p>

<p>What does your rather harsh opinion on the attractiveness of Amy and Michelle Davies have to do with their courageous refusal to &#8220;play the PC game&#8221; at Ellesmere Port Catholic High School? </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also highly impressed with the Davies women for standing firm under pressure. </p>
<p>We need more daughters like Amy and mothers like Michelle to support them in the face of the paradoxical leftist logic of &ldquo;Compulsory Tolerance&rdquo; being crammed down their throats. </p>

		<p>England is doomed. I have come to the conclusion that maybe there is something inherently wrong with the Anglo Saxon and maybe it might not be so sad to see him go. However, we Slavs have also been one of the most historically conquered and oppressed European peoples, but they have more fight left in us than almost anyone. The American Yankees of New England who are also predominantly of Anglo Saxon lineage are also the worst of America in regards to adherence to the multi-cult. They are also the people that from the beginning of America tried to impose an all powerful tyrannical federal government on the rest of Americans, until finally succeeding during the 1860&rsquo;s. Reading the comments to that article only shows how little fire the so-called English have left. A recent article stated that as many as 75% of English have seriously thought about leaving their country, couple that with the fact that labours plans about purposely inflicting the rot of mass immigration onto Whites and the Tories still only managed to squeak out a meager victory coupled with the disastrous showings of Britains Nationalist parties shows how far along England is in its march to death. The English have simply lost any will they ever had to even resist. Forget France, Forget beleaguered Germany, or even Saccharine Sweet Sweeden, England will be the first European nation to completely fall to Islam. There will only be token resistance in the UK compared to other European lands. There is something wrong with the Anglo Saxon.</p>

		<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m missing something here.  Read the school letter in the original article.  It doesn&rsquo;t state that she has to dress like a Muslim, but to be in school uniform with a skirt that covers the knees, and that a simple headscarf would do.  A scarf is no big deal, I&rsquo;ll wear on myself when it&rsquo;s windy.<br/>
I understand the mother&rsquo;s concerns and certainly would not let a child dress as a Muslim, but I&rsquo;m not seeing it (at least not in print).  Maybe they were given additional instructions?</p>

		<p>Islam has no place in Britain or in most of Europe for that matter as it is a middle eastern religion which is very foreign to the European way of life. However certain principles of Islam (or of any traditional religion) like modesty, family values etc&hellip; are welcome in an over-modernised, liberal, marxist Europe. </p>

		<p>I do understand that religious houses should have the right to require their standard of dress; the issue is more whether the school had a right to insist the field trip was mandatory. NO field trip should be mandatory. A child should not go if not agreed upon by the parents. Why do so many make simple things so complicated??</p>

		<p>Are there no lawyers (barristers) in England? The parents need to SUE the school officials&hellip; for forcing them to conform to other religions radically in opposition to their own. This is intereference with freedom of religion! No more, no less. Given the students are FORCED to conform to Muslim requirements.</p>

		<p>Someone mentioned that there is &#8220;something wrong&#8221; with the Anglo Saxon.  You should read Spengler, Decline of the West for more on this.  Spengler says our Western civilization is dying   &mdash;   he says all cultures will eventually die out, it is just a matter of time.  Some disagree with him, but he is very tough to refute.  He speaks of &#8220;civilization at its peak&#8221; in terms of its art, music, mathematics, architecture, etc.  and points out that our best such happened more than 200 years ago.  Something to think about&hellip;<br/>

		<p>How scikening that the once great, reactionary Catholic Churhc has been reduced to sending their private school students on diversity field trips to Islamic mosques. The only vestige of traditional catholic tecahing here is the fact that the field trip is mandatory.</p>
<p>And here in America, no field trip is &#8220;mandatory&#8221;, and parent&rsquo;s permission is ALWAYS required. I guess the British have different rules, or is it due to the fatc that this is a private school?</p>

Tolkien&rsquo;s words are chilling. How prophetic. He, Lewis, Belloc and Chesterton saw this crisis coming, 75 years ago.<br/>
When will we expel the Mohammedans en masse from the West? You can&rsquo;t tell friend from foe. And some of the nicer ones could be inadvertently beaten up by yobbos. For their safety and ours, they must all &mdash; ALL &mdash; be returned to the armpits of the earth whence they crawled. <br/>
We must also ban every single liberal Kulturverraeter. The Labour party must be banned, and the Tory party must return to its genuine character and the glories of 65 years ago.<br/>
We must reconstitute and re-invigorate the monarchies of Europe, allowing Christian kings to rule by fiat. And we must bring back bona fide Imperialism. With luck, we can marginalise and sanction into irrelevance all the Mohammedan countries, reducing them to their 19th-century dung heap status.<br/>

while i&rsquo;m now an agnostic, i was brought up as a christian and i attended catholic school. <br/>
 <br/>
i&rsquo;d say the the root of the whole debacle was caused by the trip was made compulsory. during my school days at the catholic school, they made it compulsory for the NON catholic pupils to attend the catholic mass once per month. Now why would this british &#8220;catholic&#8221; school made it compulsory for its catholic pupil to visit a NON catholic place of worships is just beyond me. can anyone say heresy?</p>

		<p>When one considers the amazing advances in chemistry over the last century it is not entirely inconceivable that the Brits are being drugged by their politicians into surrendering their culture and their countries without so much as a whimper&hellip;               </p>

		<p>While Christianity ascribes evil to the wrongful free will usage of angels and men, with God&rsquo;s permission so as to allow the greater good of true love:  Islam ascribes evil to the positive will of God.  We can not live side by side much less integrated with these two systems.  One will ultimately prevail.</p>

		<p>Rome did indeed lose its empire, but it still retained Italy.</p>
<p>It is the Globalists (communists) who keep preaching about the fall and decline of the West.  </p>
<p>They want us to fail so they can have their one-world communist police state.  </p>
<p>Sooner or later Western men with backbones will wake up and crush their nation&rsquo;s fifth-column traitors and cleanse their lands of enemy aliens.  </p>
<p>We are, after all, whites and we will never kowtow to the soon to be removed foreign bottom feeders infesting the lands of our fathers&hellip;         </p>

		<p>To England is Doomed: <br/>
You said,&#8221;&hellip;The American Yankees of New England who are also predominantly of Anglo Saxon lineage are also the worst of America in regards to adherence to the multi-cult.&#8221;</p>
<p>You must not know the Yankees of New England very well. I was born and raised there. I can&rsquo;t imagine anyone I grew up with putting up with this type of thing. Go out into the countryside, and you will see a different mindset than what you encounter in university towns or Boston. </p>

		<p>This is one reason why Militant Catholicism is on the rise. Traditional Militant Catholics are fed up with the Liberal Theologians who entered the Seminaries in the 1960s and &rsquo;70s, and who have taught this semi-Socialist bent on the Gospels. We have had enough of it. </p>
<p>I adhere to the Church that stood in defense of Europe and its Culture, in the midst of numerous Islamic assaults, all of which were eventually beaten back, with GOD&rsquo;s help, to where they began. </p>
<p>As for this School Administration, they need a good butt chewing. Who pays their salaries? The parents of the Students, that&rsquo;s who. That is who will have the final say, not the Faculty and Principal. </p>
<p>These Teachers and Administrators seem as dense as the Principal who sent four White High School boys home for wearing American Flag Tee shirts, on Cinco de Mayo. My blood boiled with that story. Some of these idiots need to be made examples of, and fired from their jobs. They have done enough damage to their students. </p>
<p>I also read in the body of the article, that the trip to the Mosque was an important segment for the Catholic students&rsquo; Geography field trip. </p>
<p>Just how is an English girl&rsquo;s trip to Liverpool teaching her, or her Classmates, anything about geography, that they couldn&rsquo;t learn from looking at a London Underground Timetable and map?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest. This has nothing to do with Tolerance and Cohesion, of which the Muslims practice neither, even in host Countries. This has to do with conditioning White Catholic, and other Christian children, into accepting anti-Christian Islam. </p>
