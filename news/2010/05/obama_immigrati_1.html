<h1>Obama Immigration Pledge a Boon for Mexican Leader</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alexandra Olson, Google News, May 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Barack Obama just made life a little easier for his Mexican counterpart. His promise to tackle immigration reform this year ensures Felipe Calderon will not come home empty-handed when he visits Washington in two weeks.</p>
<p>The pledge sets a lighter mood from just a week ago, when Calderon vowed to push immigration reform during his May 19 trip, even while Obama warned &#8220;there may not be an appetite&#8221; in Congress to take on the sensitive issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obama making it very clear that he believes in reform is probably something that will make Calderon&rsquo;s trip a little more successful,&#8221; said Peter Hakim, president emeritus of the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue. &#8220;He can say some things that the Mexican president would very much welcome, and Calderon understands the difficulty of this issue in Washington.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obama remained cautious in his comments at a Cinco de Mayo celebration at the White House on Wednesday acknowledging immigration reform would be difficult and making no commitment to finishing the process this year.</p>
<p>Even so, it&rsquo;s a sign of commitment that Calderon needs amid Mexican outrage over Arizona&rsquo;s tough new immigration law. His government has protested the bill  &mdash;  even issuing a travel warning against the U.S. state  &mdash;  while trying to assure Mexicans that the Obama administration remains sympathetic to the plight of migrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Faced with that atmosphere, Calderon has been reluctant to trumpet the cause.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was an issue that both sides were keeping very quiet in their bilateral discussions,&#8221; said Andrew Selee, director of the Mexico Institute at the Washington-based Woodrow Wilson Center. &#8220;Calderon is in a better place now to bring this up now that it&rsquo;s back on the U.S. domestic agenda.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Immigration across the U.S.-Mexican border has plummeted, and with it, remittances sent home from migrants. That only makes it more urgent for illegal migrants to have a path for legalizing their status, said Mexican central bank President Agustin Carstens.</p>

		<p>This is why I want the PRN (the main leftist party) to win every Mexican election they can.  They want as many Mexicans, especially the impoverished Amerindian/Mestizo types, to be in Mexico as possible, to foment the anti-white anti-plutocratic revolution.  For all the faults of Hugo Chavez, note that there aren&rsquo;t millions of Venezuelans sneaking into the United States.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m convinced that strong heads of state governing from the center-left and focusing on mild wealth redistribution is the only way for the average Latin American to have something in life, and the best way to keep them from sneaking into here.</p>

		<p><i>The plain fact is that the Obama Administration has very shallow roots in historic America. It is, to put it brutally, a minority occupation government.</i> - Peter Brimelow</p>
<p>The effects of allowing your people to be displaced don&rsquo;t really kick in until the occupiers assume political power.  Detroit didn&rsquo;t really become &#8220;Detroit&#8221; until Coleman Young was elected.  Conservatives and political neutrals can pretend that the newcomers are &#8220;just like the Irish&#8221; until the reality of minority misrule hits them in the face.  The day is very soon coming when they will look back on Obama with nostalgia.   </p>

<p>When does the Mulatto Messiah plan to make life easier for American citizens, and make sure that <i>we</i> don&rsquo;t go home empty-handed?  Just exactly who does this marxist fanatic think he represents?</p>
<p>It seems that he considers himself the president of Mexico.  If only it were true.<br>

		<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t Mr. Obama ask the Mexican why his country, with almost limitless natural resources and a relatively high GDP sends it unwanted and poor citizens across the border to leach off of the US citizen instead of helping them.  I guess that would take some sort of leadership so nix that.  I&rsquo;m sure Mr. Obama will just apologize for the racist white people who believe in things like national sovereignty and promise to keep those racist borders wide open just like El Presidente Boosh did.</p>

<p>Mexico has laws that state that foreign nationals may not interfere politically in Mexico. We need the same thing. How dare Mexican leaders etc. interfere in OUR business. The American people do NOT want a pathway for citizenship ie. amnesty. We want the Mexicans back in Mexico. Mexico simply wants to use the USA as a cash cow for their lack of success,  that&rsquo;s all. Mexico needs to fix it&rsquo;s own problems. We&rsquo;re sick of being used, losing jobs and having to put up with their crimes and fraud.</p>

<p>Not every South American country is so bad. Uruguay, Chile, and Argentina, all overhwlemingly white (primarily SApanish, Portugese, and Italian) are all pretty industrialized, clean, and modern. </p>

		<p>Washington has absolutely no intension of ever sealing our southern border.  </p>
<p>In fact their whole impetus is geared towards permanently erasing the border between Mexico and the US.<br>
  <br>
Granting amnesty to between 20-30 million Mexican illegals would be the catalyst that sparks our second revolution.  </p>
<p>These 20-30 million amnestied Mexican illegals would be added to the welfare rolls, because employers would replace them with the unending flood of Mexican illegals.  </p>
<p>We would have no choice but to respond to this government treason by exercising our Second Amendment rights&hellip;  </p>

It&rsquo;s never going to come to that.  Both mexico and the shadowy forces that have co-opted our government want to dissolve our soveriegnty.  However, they didn&rsquo;t count on something.  Mexico is very close to having that government overthrown and replaced by a violent, communist narco-terrorist government.  Not a legitimate government but rather a state of enforced anarchy.  What I am getting at is these people will not tolerate the sort of fascist state control planned for the North America.  The north american union has failed before it even came close to fruition.</p>
<p>The only question is&hellip;.now what.  Mult-culturalism is destroying the very thing these people wanted to use it to create.  So what new thing are they going to try next?</p>

		<p>The great Obamanator cares more for what Mexicans want that what Americans want. Some &#8220;democracy&#8221;! It&rsquo;s more like a plutocracy here.</p>
<p>Regarding the comment about erasing our borders, I wonder how the SPP and the North American Union are progressing. I haven&rsquo;t heard much about those two in some time.</p>
