<h1>Beaten and Sold</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Randy Ludlow, Columbus Dispatch, May 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The conspiracy to enslave and sell women for sex began at the Matchbox, a hard-edged tavern wedged against the railroad tracks along S. Washington Street in Circleville.</p>
<p>Army Spc. Craig Allen Corey II was on leave back home in Chillicothe. Over beers at the Circleville bar, he talked to a pair of childhood buddies about his plan to pad his soldier&rsquo;s wages. And there would be good money in it for them, too.</p>
<p>{snip} With some risque photos of the offerings and some explicit erotic-services listings on craigslist, Corey calculated he could pocket $150,000 a year on top of his drug-dealing income.</p>
<p>That night in late 2008 in Circleville marked the origin of Corey as &#8220;Pimp C.&#8221; His drinking mates  &mdash;  Jacob Tyler and Robert &#8220;Little Rob&#8221; Harris II  &mdash;  would act as enforcers to keep the women and johns in line while he played Army. The men added another hometown friend and drug dealer  &mdash;  Richard &#8220;Little Richy&#8221;Johnson II  &mdash;  to the operation and set out to stock their brothel.</p>
<p>The young men did most of their shopping for women  &mdash;  both willing and not  &mdash;  on the turf where they already peddled drugs: Chillicothe.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Corey also used MySpace, YouTube and Web ads to recruit a few women from Virginia, and he imported a woman from Watertown, N.Y., where he once was stationed at Fort Drum. But most of the women  &mdash;  and a 16-year-old girl  &mdash;  came from Chillicothe and surrounding Ross County.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think any area is immune,&#8221; said William Winter, special agent in charge of the Baltimore office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which built a case against the men that sent them to prison for a combined 57 years. &#8220;A lot of the women had not traveled much and were low on the socio-economic scale. They were ripe to be exploited by someone with strong personalities like these guys.</p>
<p>&#8220;They would recruit these women by saying .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#8216;Come to the big city of Baltimore and bring your friends. Come party with us,&rsquo; basically. &#8216;We have a lot of money,&rsquo;&#8221; Winter [William Winter, special agent in charge of the Baltimore office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] said.</p>
<p>Nearly nude photos of the women soon were posted on craigslist, with rates of up to $200 an hour &#8220;for modeling, role-playing, sensual body rub, personal assistance and private dancing.&#8221; A disclaimer added: &#8220;I do not offer illegal or immoral services.&#8221;</p>
<p>The operation was short-lived, spanning January to April 2009, before it was busted after &#8220;Holly&#8221;  &mdash;  a 28-year-old Chillicothe woman  &mdash;  accepted $100 for her services from an undercover cop.</p>
<p>But during those four months, beatings, threats and drugs underlined the coercion and control in play in Millersville, an unincorporated area of populous Anne Arundel County south of Baltimore.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Women who balked at serving sex customers or attempted to withhold cash paid by the johns would be beaten and threatened with more violence. Tyler and Harris had guns and were not shy about flashing them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 16-year-old was ferried from Chillicothe by Corey and his fiancee under the pretext of partying. Then, she was forced to have sex with three men who had responded to an Internet ad from &#8220;Vanilla.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>With little money, no transportation and total reliance on their captors for food and shelter, the women had nowhere to turn.</p>
<p>With thousands of dollars a week coming in, the guys from Chillicothe were living large, buying electronics, clothes, jewelry and car accessories. Harris added gold teeth.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police also found the 16-year-old, drugs and a gun in the apartment. &#8220;Holly&#8221; was charged with prostitution. Corey was charged with human trafficking. Johnson and an 18-year-old woman from Chillicothe were charged with drug possession.</p>
<p>Because a minor child had been imported across state lines for prostitution, local police turned the case over to ICE, and federal agents visited Chillicothe to help build their case and track down and interview the women who had returned home.</p>
<p>On Sept. 29, the men were arrested on a multitude of federal charges that included sex trafficking by force, sex trafficking of a minor, interstate transportation for prostitution, drug trafficking and conspiracy.</p>
<p>Even after Corey was busted, he continued dealing drugs, traveling to Detroit to buy drugs that were then sold on the streets in both Maryland and Chillicothe. He also sold to an undercover officer.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>With all but Tyler facing the possibility of life in prison, the men signed plea arrangements. Corey, 23, will serve 171/2 years. Tyler, 23, and Harris, 21, each received 15-year terms. Johnson, 23, was sentenced to 10 years.</p>

<p>And just guess, what percentage of the population in Chillicothe happens to be white?<br>
That would be over 89% my friends. See this link:</p>
<p><a href="https://chillicothe.areaconnect.com/statistics.htm" rel="nofollow">https://chillicothe.areaconnect.com/statistics.htm</a></p>
<p>This is why I favor very drastic and draconian measures against black sexual predators and black males in general, when any such &ldquo;young men&rdquo; of that race commit any form of sexual pillage and plunder against white women, period. Blacks and most other nonwhites are base and cowardly manipulators, who cannot fight real battles, let alone wars, and they know it. In a real fight (and we always prove this historically) an alert and united white population,will utterly smash its racial rivals. Blacks, Latinos, Arabs, and even Asians know this to the very core of their being; they cannot defeat us in a straightforward manner, so they must always slither toward underhanded openings and exploit those as best they can. </p>
<p>You can almost gauge the &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; and &ldquo;adaptability&rdquo; of any rival racial group pitted against whites, by the methods they use. With Asians it is: technological theft, crude banking practices, and haphazard attempts at military expansion and colonization. With Arabs it is: terrorism, oil bribery, and invasion through &ldquo;immigration.&rdquo; With Latinos it is: &ldquo;migration&rdquo; invasion and an arrogant orgy of crime and entitlement &ldquo;assimilating&rdquo; once in a country. And finally, with blacks it is always: sexually oriented criminal marauding, riots, murder, theft, and all other manner of generalized chaos that is open to them.</p>
<p>In one word, Apartheid, is the only solution to these racial problems in the West. </p>
<p>And I am not talking your grandparents&rsquo; version of it either; nope, when I say Apartheid, it means separate and equal development only in terms of socioeconomics. Once any breach of white racial survival and expansion is criminally violated, collective retribution is fully acceptable to me!</p>

		<p>So, this is what billions of dollars of taxpayers&rsquo; money have brought.  This is one of the end products after wasted money from affirmative action, public housing, Head Start, etc.  Next shake down will be slavery reparations.  What is wrong in making these people work for a living in their own capacity?  Blue collar job training would have given them at least some job competition and capability to instill some self respect.   </p>

		<p>Think what you want about the Muslims, but they have their women IN CHECK.  You don&rsquo;t ever hear things like this happening to Muslim women because they know if it did their men would kill them.  </p>
<p>I read a story today about a woman who was sexually assaulted on a flight to Hong Kong by the man in the seat next to her while she slept.  Of course everyone was aghast at the disgusting behavior of this man, and rightly so.</p>
<p>But of course the flip side of the coin is never examined.  There was once a time when women didn&rsquo;t travel alone, and this is why.  Because they can&rsquo;t defend themselves and they don&rsquo;t always make the wisest decisions, as this story about these pimp wannabes proves all too well.</p>
<p>We need to look out for our women because the black bucks trying to get in their pants and exploit them for easy money certainly aren&rsquo;t going to do it.</p>

		<p>We live in a society in which black criminals and black pimps are widely praised and respected.</p>
<p>Endless rap songs and movies glorify black criminals.</p>
<p>Recently a song glorifying pimps won an Oscar.  The white liberals in the audience applauded.  No one in the liberal media objected.</p>
<p>These pimps are getting off lightly.  By forcing women to engage in sex acts against their will they are responsible for raping these women.  They should be charged for one count of rape for every sex act these women or girls are forced to engage in.</p>
<p>The reason the pimps got off so lightly is that they&rsquo;re black and their victims were white.  </p>
<p>We can thank the black supremacist, anti-white liberals for this. </p>

<p>This sentence describes pretty clearly what fuels human trafficking.  It&rsquo;s ALWAYS seen as an add on business to the drug trade.  That&rsquo;s how you stop it.  Stop welfare from being diverted into drugs and you disempower the people and their institutions that do this.  These things depend on drugs to happen.  And drugs depend on welfare money to pay for them.  No welfare&hellip;no drugs.  No drugs&hellip;no power.  No power&hellip;no gangs.  No gangs&hellip;.no human trafficking.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how to beat these people.</p>

		<p>Slavery is alive and well in America. But in almost all cases, it is dark skinned men enslaving either other dark skinned persons or white females.</p>
<p>Usually when it is report in the media, it is reported as &#8220;man&#8221; or &#8220;men&#8221; running a slavery racket. NEVER the full story.</p>
<p>ONLY in Amren will you see the photos and find out the truth. Picture worth thousand words someone said.</p>

		<p>Generally, blacks are dishonest and naturally gifted in the art of verbal conmanship - which is a psychopathic trait.<br>
No, I will resist the temptation to make cheap comparisons with realtors, but many here are puzzled by the success of blacks with White women as, o course, it can have nothing to do with looks, wealth or status.tHe answer is verbal conmanship, you see the black is persistant in working his devilish charm with these silly white women, and on top of that he is totally unashamed of playing an emotional fool by mock displays of begging and crying for favors - he really is a shameless, despicable individual.<br>
  Only afterwards does the silly slut see what the black man is all about.When she is the grasp the violent beatings, intimidation and abuse start.</p>

<p>Oh give me a break!!! Women are not to be kept &#8220;in check&#8221; by men. Men just need to keep themselves in check. As far as making wise decisions, it depends upon the individual, man or woman. Most women, like men, are perfectly capable of making wise decisions and can and should travel alone. Women aren&rsquo;t children.</p>

		<p>I suspect that most of the women being pimped out were black or mestizo.  Just because the black population is under 10% doesn&rsquo;t mean they aren&rsquo;t brutalizing each other just as much as they do everywhere else in America.</p>

		<p>Truly sickening, I cannot imagine forcing a 16 year old to perform sexual favours on three guys. This article makes me cringe. These sexual predators don&rsquo;t belong in human society, they should be executed.</p>

<p>I agree with you, women do not need to be kept in check. What we as Western Society need is to root these criminals out, punish them accordingly and enforce our laws in whatever way we see fit. Doing this will slowly but surely return society into the safe place it once was, a place where women can walk freely on the streets without fear.</p>
<p>The problem of course is trying to get our governments to see past their corrupt greedy short term needs and get them to start enforcing the very laws they keep shouting down. </p>
