<h1>Detroit Boy, 13, Found Guilty of Murder in Woman&rsquo;s Death</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joe Swickard, Detroit Free Press, May 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Detroit teenager was convicted this morning of felony murder and could face life in prison for the killing committed when he was 12 years old.</p>
<p>A Wayne County Circuit Court jury found DeMarco Harris, 13, guilty of killing Trisha Babcock during a robbery last year. Deliberations began Friday and resumed this morning before Judge Sheila Ann Gibson.</p>
<p>Harris will be sentenced June 1under a law that allows juvenile to designated as an adult.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Harris claimed he was forced by an older youth to take part in the bungled robbery of Babcock, 24, of Genesee County as she sat talking in a parked car on the west side of Detroit.</p>

		<p>13 is young to be given a death sentence or life behind bars.  Yet, there are in fact some kids that young who harbor mature and adult motives when they commit their crimes.  If this is one of those, then society will be better off without him.</p>

		<p>	Whites have demonstrated an extraordinary benevolence and tolerance towards less productive races for decades, we have transgressed the law of natural selection by not only supporting inferior life-forms, but actually encouraging their propagation; the off spring of these people have little to contribute, and have become a burdened to society.</p>

<p>Demarco Harris, 12, Faces Adult Charges in Trisha Babcock Murder<br>
by Tina Kells, August 19, 2009 at 08:18 pm<br>
https://tinyurl.com/39ktvyj<br>
Here is an excerpt from the above weblink:<br>
&#8220;&hellip;According to police, the boy tried to rob Trisha Babcock, 24, of Davison, just after midnight on Aug. 1. She had come to Detroit seeking work as a dancer and was sitting in the driver&rsquo;s seat of a parked car when the boy pointed his gun at her and a struggle ensued, police said. He shot her once in the chest, police said, and she later died at a hospital&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>A dancer.</p>
<p>I may be old fashioned, but I would have liked to have seen her be someone&rsquo;s wife.  It is a shame that the world has lost another pretty lady (under such terrible circumstances).</p>
<p>Pleasant evening to all.</p>

		<p>Take a big breath, sit down and read my words very very slowly.</p>
<p>How would you feel if you were black and this beautiful woman of an obviously superior average IQ bell curve intelligence drove through your run-down trashed-out ghetto town?</p>
<p>Be honest.. it would Goad you with envy. Envy day in and day out. That is why God created the mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean and the Ural mountains. </p>
<p>Envy hurts. And when we pretend that envy doesn&rsquo;t hurt, and that such obviously differently enabled races and live in the same government/school/market/society/institutions we are DELUDING OURSELVES. </p>
<p>Blacks hate whites because blacks are white supremacists. <br>
One part of their psyche wants to breed off us and feed off us. The other part of their psyche (as exemplified here in the murder) wants to destroy the object of their envy.</p>
<p>Have mercy on blacks, push towards National Partition. Then they won&rsquo;t have to be goaded on a daily basis by superior intelligence, appearance and financial condition.</p>

		<p>I agree with the first post. I noticed in school that the black kids slowed or stopped cerebral maturity around thirteen years of age and began to fall behind. By high school the stasis presented a stark difference in learning levels. There were only one or two blacks in any of the advanced placement classes and the graduating class was about one thousand with whites making up a sixty percent majority. Many were slow learners relegated to special education classes where they could be given a grade which would allow them to graduate (or be processed out of the system). Most would be better served if allowed to leave high school at sixteen if college is not and the picture- perhaps two years of paid trade school. Though with race preferences in admissions and affirmative action, blacks can continue to pretend to &#8220;school&#8221; and afterwards pretend to &#8220;job&#8221;. Nothing like an affirmative action hire in a small office and picking up the slack for someone perpetually pubescent emotionally while childlike in reasoning and accountability. Oh, the stories that could be told.</p>

		<p>Whenever there is a big gap between the reality and the media-reality, you know a tyranny is at power.</p>
<p>I watch television a lot. In the last 3 to 4 years I haven&rsquo;t seen one, just one black guilty man in movies. Always a white man is the evil character and blacks are nearly always either doctors or judges or just &#8220;have heart&#8221; (what suggest none-criminal hardworking white man hasn&rsquo;t).<br>
But whenever I watch news, it was a black guy killing white women.</p>

		<p>She was a &#8216;dancer&rsquo;. She was in a black side of town to &#8216;dance&rsquo;. It wasnt the first time she has been &#8216;dancing&rsquo; for blacks. Hell, she probably had a black boyfriend.</p>
<p>Sometimes these cases look differently than what they actually are.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m glad #10 brought up the overused concept of &#8220;robbery gone bad&#8221;.  That phrase is one of my pet peeves, since robberies are exceptionally bad to begin with.  I recently heard a cop on TV refer to the phenom as a &#8220;robbery gone haywire&#8221;.  That&rsquo;s at least more realistic, though often I believe the robber meant to kill the victim from the get-go, either from spite or desire to eliminate a witness.  I&rsquo;ll never forget the office-building video of the Hispanic thug who calmly shot a woman in the back of the head and then, unable to quickly untangle her purse strap, casually swaggered away.  </p>

		<p>Scratch one more beautiful, precious White female and any equally beautiful and equally precious white babies she might have given as gifts to our shrinking white world.  Oh, and according to the report, she had come to Detroit &#8216;looking for work as a dancer&rsquo;?    I tend to assume that means a job dancing with less than a full compliment of modest clothing.   Knowing the demographics that are associated with Detroit - this employment idea of hers would go down in history as one of the stupidest and most poorly thought out decisions on the part of any white female.   Shaking your booty in front of a bar full of inebriated and barely civilized Africans - is not my idea of how a lady proves her sanity.</p>

		<p>His father was 10 years older than his mother. He would pick her up after school hours from middle school. She was raised by a single mother as was her mother`s mother. The only man in her son`s life was the white insurance man who came by every last Thursday in the month. He was raised by the televison set and Granny. The only thing he ever heard from his mother was,&#8221; Mommy be back,&#8221;as she left for the streets.On his first day of school he was equipped with all the knowledge of a two year old.By the second grade he had not learned to spell his own name. By age ten his role models were the punks with gold teeth who sell dope or play in the NBA.By age 12 he had seen at least three killings and not one kid in his fourth grade class lived in a family with a mother and father who were married to each other. We now want to teach him a lesson by locking him up for life. Charles Dickens at his most creative could not have penned a more miserable plot. This kid was destroyed by the republicans who invented the food stamp program in 1950 and the pandering democrat Union stooges who wanted blacks to be a servile race so they wouldn`t be able to work Union jobs. Crack babies,child killers, nihilitic atavists, Martin Luther King`s dream has become a ghastly nightmare.<br>

		<p>A dancer indeed. This young lady came to Detroit from a White suburb to become a &#8220;dancer&#8221; of the pole and lap type. She was one of those brainwashed white girls that came to experience the &#8220;dark&#8221; side of Detroit night life. She was sitting in a car with a black male. In my book she committed suicide. </p>

		<p>#22 OH come on, What happened to you? I normally find you to be a reasonable blogger. Are we to believe this cretin is all whiteys fault? I&rsquo;m sure the blacks and lefties love your post. A typical liberal ploy, blame someone else for your iniquities. No one made him murder anyone. Certainly also no one is trying to teach him anything, they will be trying to remove him from society, for the protection of the public. Dangerous people cannot be roaming the streets looking for victims. He is not the victim here, I don&rsquo;t believe for a minute he did not know it was wrong to kill her. A poor upbringing does not make someone a murderer, I personally know several people who have been witness to equally horrific upbringing, and never murdered anyone. HE has a free will and chose to kill, he alone is to blame for his actions period. </p>
