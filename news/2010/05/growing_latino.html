<p>Some Texans predict that the &#8220;Latino giant&#8221; won&rsquo;t fully flex its political might until 2012. Some say 2014. Others see the tough immigration law in Arizona moving the impact to this year. All agree that when Latinos arrive at the polls in huge numbers, the results won&rsquo;t please Republicans.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they know that the day is coming,&#8221; Camarillo [Lydia Camarillo is vice president of the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project] said. &#8220;That&rsquo;s why they are coming up with obstructions, such as voter ID laws.&#8221;</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s not much Republicans can do about a surging Latino electorate in the short term. Even if they appeal to more Latino voters and Hispanic turnout stays weak, the raw numbers may overwhelm them.</p>
<p>As Rice University political analyst Bob Stein explains, over the past three decades, Latino support for Democrats in Texas has actually fallen from 75 percent to 60 percent. But as Democrats lost 15 percentage points, they almost doubled in the number of votes received because of the explosive growth in the Latino population.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 1980, there were 3 million Hispanics in Texas. In 2008, the total nearly reached 9 million, and projections put it at almost 10 million this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;One national figure that sticks out is the change in the younger-than-20 population,&#8221; Murdock [Steve Murdock, former director of the U.S. Census and now a professor at Rice University] told me. Between 2000 and 2008, the number of 20-and-younger non-Hispanic whites fell by 2.6 million, while Latinos increased by 3.8 million.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Fifteen years ago I was trying to tell people why the dems and repubs wanted illegal immigration, and in wanting it, the repubs were committing eventual political suicide.  Lets face it, the dems are more cunning and crafty than the repubs, much better at long range strategy.  Without the new hispanic immigrant vote, Obama would not be in the White House now.  The survival of our country as a republic is very uncertain unless we can get the repubs to wake up to their stupidity and join forces with the conservatives who they have been studiously ignoring for years, thinking that if they acted like liberals they could capture some of the left wing vote.   </p>

		<p>Some of us are VERY aware of that situation.  The thing is, though, many of the Hispanics who came here LEGALLY resent the gall of the illegals&rsquo; demands for amnesty, and they are not going to vote in their favor.  The ones I know say that if Mexicans or other Hispanics want to come here, let them do it legally just like they did - or no go, period.  This is a factor that could surprise the Dems at the polls - unpleasantly.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s get to the heart of the issue. White Liberal Democrats and White Republican insiders are issuing a threat to millions of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS. And the threat is this:We are going to import millions of nonwhite  high fertility foreigners into America who will out number you&hellip; out vote you&hellip;discriminate against you,,and if they want to-because they will have the power to do so-commit acts of violence against NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS with complete impunity. You are White and you have no rights and legitimate interests worth protecting.</p>
<p>Now what I have just stated is obvious. But what I have just described is a war of racial annihilation against the majority NATIVE BORN WHITE POPULATION OF AMERICA&hellip;.GENOCIDE.</p>
<p>There was a recent post on Alternative Right about the personality profile of White Republican and Democratic politicians. They have the exactsame  personality profile as a serial killer. The current political system selects for White politicians who have no concience about annihilating their own king&hellip;for profit and fame.</p>
<p>Like sociopaths in general, they are incapable of thinking in the long term&hellip;all that matters is short term satisfaction.</p>
<p>What they are not considering is that something will fill the political vacum&hellip;NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS are under no obligation to commit racial suicide because it would make sociopaths Bill Clinton-war criminal and rapist- and his war criminal wife Hillarly happy.</p>

		<p>They will only help Democrats until they are of numbers to take over the entire state.  At that point, they will then help Mexico.  Anyone think a Latino majority state will pass a strong anti-illegal immigration bill? For perspective, check out the Wikipedia page on Texas where it refers to &#8220;colonization&#8221;. It&rsquo;s the same thing happening now, only in reverse.  Texas is currently 50% White and 35% Latino.  In 20 years, it will be Tejas.</p>

		<p>Why can&rsquo;t Republicans see the obvious?</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re complicit.  They see it fine.  It&rsquo;s just that they don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not like they can do anything about it anyway.  How can you compete with the party of cradle-to-grave entitlement?  </p>
<p>Just when the average American seems to be waking up to the fallacies behind the welfare state, in rushes the naive Hispanic bloc who know nothing but dirt and tortillas.  Seems like a hell of a deal, free health care, free food stamps, free school, and the white man has no choice but to pay for it or be labeled a racist right-wing extremist.</p>

<p>Sorry, Viejo&hellip;I do not buy a word you say about the &#8220;legal&#8221; ones! I have seen far too many that side with the illegals simply because they are of the same race! Race trumps all! LEGAL &#8220;hispanics&#8221; vote for the Dems and for Obama, so pandering to them is a big mistake. They are NOT the White man&rsquo;s friend, period.</p>

		<p>The real goal of hispanics, especially Mexicans is absolute power for themselves and the Democrat party is just a useful tool for that. Once they have power through shear numbers (which is why they don&rsquo;t want any controls on immigration) they will no longer have any use for the Democrat party or Democracy for that matter. It will be about hispanic supremacy and dictatorship. Once the useful white idiots of the Democrat party realize this and how they have been played, they will join the fight against this hispanic supremacy which will finally mean the end of America and the beginning of racial enclaves, aka &#8220;Balkanization&#8221;. Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t think I will live long enough to see it or participate in the fight, damn.</p>

		<p>The Republicans who tolerate more hispanic immigration are just shills for their own interests, or other businesses who desire cheap labor and more consumers.  However, when the percentages of hispanics becomes too large Texas will accelerate its transformation into a Mexican like state.</p>
<p>The Republicans who believe they can understand and control the hispanics after the tipping point occurs are fools beyond measure.  They can then dream about how great Texas used to be while residing in their few remaining bastions.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not that the Stupid Party can&rsquo;t see the damage they are inflicting on this country.  It&rsquo;s just that they don&rsquo;t see it happening while they are enjoying being in office.  Let the next guy worry about all the problems they have created.</p>
<p>The CPUSA (AKA Democratic Party) has a more realisti long-term view.  They know they are going to get creamed in November and in 2012.  They plan to inflict all the damage they can on this country until then, in the sure and cetain knowledge the vast majority of American voters will notice the damage during the next Republican administration, and, with typical American voter ignorance, blame the party in office for all the problems.  This will then ensure a Communist return to power by 2016, at which time the replacement of the American people will have progressed sufficiently that the Republican Party will be effectively destroyed.</p>

		<p>I notice how &#8220;conservative&#8221; talking heads have danced around this issue endlessly for years. It is obvious to anyone even remotely aware from a political standpoint, yet the Republican party and their media cheerleaders somehow still cannot see it. That is awfully hard to believe is it not? Makes one wonder what these Republicans are really up to, doesn&rsquo;t it?  </p>

		<p>Goodbye to happy white girl cheerleader Pelosi?</p>
<p>The first stage will be for the Republican Party to still win nationally only when the Democrats really mess up, a Vietnam or Watergate-type situation. Second stage, the GOP will pretty much never win. Third stage, the Democratic Party will have become so overwhelmingly &#8220;minority&#8221; that minorities will ask themselves why in the world do they have so many white people running their party, at which time clueless Self-Dispossession leaders like Pelosi and Reid, or their successors, will be summarily handed their walking papers. And that, at least, will be fun to watch.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s mathematically absurd for Repubs to pander to a demographic group that&rsquo;s only 8% of the national vote and never has been close to a Republican majority.  When they do this they risk losing part of the White vote, their natural base, which at 75% of the vote outnumbers the Hispanic by a 9-to-1 ratio.</p>
<p>They need math lessons.  For every 9 percentage points lost from the Hispanic, they only need a 1 point increase in the White vote to make up the difference.  Standing up for conservative, constitutional and sovereignty issues would earn them a higher percentage of the much larger White vote and drown Hispanic losses.</p>

		<p>Sorry, #17</p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t buy it. Just how many LEGAL hispanics do you know? One hundred,two hundred? A drop in the bucket. I go by NOT seeing any of them speak out and that means deep inside they DO want their kinsmen here to take over!  I have heard maybe 3 hispanics call talk shows and declare they are against illegal immigration. How sincere were they? They sure did not convince me. They just want us to think that there are hispanics who are on our side, but in reality, they are anything but!</p>
