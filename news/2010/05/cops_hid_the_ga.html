			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Bolt, Herald Sun (Melbourne), May 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>NO wonder Victoria Police is furious that we yesterday published excerpts of a leaked police report on Asian gangs.</p>
<p>Some of the truth about Melbourne&rsquo;s ethnic crime is out at last, you see.</p>
<p>Worse, police command must now talk about what it&rsquo;s hidden for so long.</p>
<p>That leaked report in fact reveals little that a sharp-eyed reader wouldn&rsquo;t have figured out over the years, with one news item after another about people chopped up outside nightclubs, stabbed in Springvale, arrested in their dozens for drug trafficking or chased to their deaths from Asian-themed events.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s flick through its four brief pages.</p>
<p>As the Herald Sun reported, it says we have at least half a dozen Asian gangs with &#8220;extensive&#8221; membership. Check.</p>
<p>They can be incredibly violent, and favour machetes. Check.</p>
<p>They like to hang out at the &#8220;Asian&#8221; theme nights we increasingly see at inner-city nightclubs. Check again.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re getting worse and if police don&rsquo;t crack down it&rsquo;s &#8220;highly likely .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that a person will be murdered&#8221;.</p>
<p>Actually, more people will be murdered. But check again.</p>
<p>See? Nothing new, and we kept secret sensitive details of the policing operations recommended by the acting sergeant whose report this is.</p>
<p>So why is police command putting it about that we were reckless in publishing no more than this bleeding  &mdash;  and I do mean bleeding  &mdash;  obvious?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one clue. We did also say this report called for an Asian crime squad  &mdash;  which is just what former chief commissioner Christine Nixon scrapped four years ago.</p>
<p>Time to cut to the chase. It&rsquo;s Nixon in particular who foolishly got police to play dumb about precisely the kind of thing this report discusses.</p>
<p>Never mind that certain ethnic groups  &mdash;  Aborigines, Pacific Islanders, Sudanese, Lebanese and Vietnamese in particular  &mdash;  have imprisonment rates much higher than the average.</p>
<p>Under Nixon, ethnic crime became a topic the police did not discuss  &mdash;  and at times deceitfully denied. In my opinion, disbanding the Asian crime squad was in part a sign of that denial.</p>
<p>But Nixon also refused to release data on ethnic crime rates, and intervened in the last federal election to falsely claim &#8220;Sudanese refugees are actually under-represented in the crime statistics&#8221;.</p>
<p>She even banned the word &#8220;gang&#8221;, leading to this exchange with Neil Mitchell on 3AW :</p>
<p><i>Nixon: What we saw in that more recent incident was one of two gangs, which I gather was around two women, which started fighting.</p>
<p>Mitchell: But gangs are an issue.</p>
<p>Nixon: Well, we&rsquo;re seeing some groups of people. I&rsquo;m not describing them as gangs.</p>
<p>Mitchell: Well, you just did.</p>
<p>Nixon: Well, you know what I mean.</p>
<p>Mitchell: I thought the word gang was banned by your media people.</p>
<p>Nixon: Well, it is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it&rsquo;s got connotations.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. These are groups of people who come together and just cause problems together.</i></p>
<p>Farcical. As if banning a word makes what it describes vanish.</p>
<p>Yet her police got the message. Take this Herald Sun report on attacks on Indian cabbies around Flemington: &#8220;Police will not officially acknowledge any particular ethnic group is a target, or that any other group is carrying out the crimes. But in every case the victims told police their attackers were African.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then there was the police &#8220;multicultural liaison officer&#8221; in Dandenong who in 2007 tried the Nixon method in waving away a spate of bashings by African gangs.</p>
<p>The Sudanese in the area were actually &#8220;doing quite well&#8221;, he claimed, and the real problem was merely one of perception: &#8220;People might see 30 or 40 Sudanese gathering in a group and think they must be a gang.&#8221;</p>
<p>Only after scared residents and cranky talkback hosts revolted at such flim flam did Assistant Commissioner Paul Evans concede his officers were struggling to deal with newcomers from a &#8220;culture&#8221; of violence and with a &#8220;tribe mentality&#8221;, and needed help.</p>
<p>And under new Chief Commissioner Simon Overland we&rsquo;ve seen the same policy of denial.</p>
<p>He, too, has refused to release data on ethnicity and crime, and wouldn&rsquo;t even say that many of the recent attacks on Indian students in Melbourne were by people from ethnic backgrounds  &mdash;  Lebanese, Maori and Pacific Islanders in particular. Not even when Indian papers railed at our &#8220;white Australian&#8221; racism did he set the record straight.</p>
<p>Indeed, you see this police culture of deception and dog-ate-my-homework excuses in a recent Victoria University study on those Indian bashings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Police interviewees .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. suggested that without being able to draw on specific data about offenders from the Victoria Police database, they could not speak with certainty about offender profiles.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>Then this dust in your eyes: &#8220;Police officers did stress, however, that anecdotal reporting suggested that where groups of offenders were responsible for assaults against international students, there was no evidence of ethnic or racial homogenisation within the groups, with the majority being mixed-race, mixed-ethnicity groups of offenders across the cultural spectrum, sometimes including but definitely not limited to young male offenders of Anglo-Celtic background, and sometimes not including Anglo-background youth at all.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sound like word games to you?</p>
<p>Yet this same study pointed out that almost everyone else except the police knew just who was doing the bashing: &#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. those who were known to be involved in crime are often relatively new arrivals to Australia themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>You may excuse the police, saying they&rsquo;re just being nice. They&rsquo;re trying not to make newcomers feel unwelcome, or our racists feel licensed.</p>
<p>These are honourable motives. As the son of immigrants, I know many migrants, whether African, Lebanese or Anglo, are a blessing to this country.</p>
<p>Only this week the principal of Melbourne&rsquo;s newest selective high school, Nossal High in Berwick, said more than 80 per cent of his students were of non-Anglo ancestry, having that wonderful get-stuck-in spirit you often see in the immigrating kind.</p>
<p>BUT Victoria Police&rsquo;s secrecy has a price. We&rsquo;ve seen ourselves damned around the world as racists, for instance, for the crimes of new ethnic minorities. Worse, we&rsquo;ve seen crime fighting compromised.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t just mean that police on the beat say ethnic gangs have little respect for a force they now take to be weak.</p>
<p>Consider also a recent police appeal for the public&rsquo;s help to find an African man who&rsquo;d tried to drag a 14-year-old Brighton girl into his car.</p>
<p>Our don&rsquo;t-mention-the-race police once more refused to note the man&rsquo;s most obvious characteristic, and described him merely as having a &#8220;dark complexion&#8221;. What, is he Greek?</p>
<p>All well intentioned, I repeat. But there&rsquo;s one reason in particular we must at last be more frank.</p>
<p>We need to understand there&rsquo;s often a risk in bringing in traumatised and badly educated people from war zones  &mdash;  Lebanon, then Cambodia and now Somalia  &mdash;  or from backward cultures and angry faiths.</p>
<p>Until we understand how much culture matters in helping  &mdash;  or hindering  &mdash;  assimilation, we&rsquo;ll have many more humiliated newcomers here wondering how the hell they can fit in to a society as alien as ours, or at least get some respect.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll also find more such bruised people seeking the company of others with their background  &mdash;  and their resentments. And no sweet lies from the police will help you then.<br>

I bet the people they were raping and murdering were thinking, hey, this is just a group of similar people gathering together to cause trouble.  It&rsquo;s definitely not a gang though.</p>

		<p>Unbelievable. Political correctness is resulting in police coverups about the kinds of people committing violent crimes in Australia. Instead of being outraged at the criminals, the police are outraged that their coverups are exposed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s past time for Australians to push for repeal of their onerous gun-control laws, and arm themselves. The police no more protect them, than do the police in any other country protect their subjects.</p>

		<p>I believe it is a little too coincidental that every Western&#8221;white&#8221; nation in the world has adopted this self destructive ideology of multiculturalism, lying through there teeth, and installing draconian laws to keep it together.</p>
<p>I am of the opinion we are experiencing the final stages of a centuries old conspiracy. To either take complete control, or destroy the European peoples.</p>
<p>Just by looking at statistics you can see that we shall be minorities in our country by 2050, in every single country that we inhabit, Even Europe our Indigenous homelands.</p>

		<p>Now how is it that I just saw an article about the Aussie PM telling all immigrants to learn English and assimilate into Aussie culture, or go home?  Those words were music to my ears.  So why these police don&rsquo;t act in accordance with the words of the PM, and tell the rock-bottom truth about those whom they arrest?  If the arrestees are immigrants, I&rsquo;d say they are not assimilating very well, and is this not grounds for deportation?  It should be.  And it should be here in the U.S., not just in Australia.</p>

		<p>Nobody keeps land they can&rsquo;t effectively defend.  Eventually it is taken from them and they become refugees.  Eventually their culture is overwhelmed.<br>

		<p>Andrew Bolt is one the most outspoken, candid critics of multiculturalism and lax immigration policies. Yet even he has to stop short at culture as the crucial fissure between peoples. He has to stress that he has friends of Anglo, Lebanese and African background. I wonder if he really does have African and Lebanese friends. Judging from his blunt appraisals of Islam, it&rsquo;s unlikely he has any Muslim friends.</p>
<p>He feels he has to remind us that he too is a migrant. But he is from Britain. The idea that Britain is a foreign state would have been risbly 30 years ago. Britains and Australians were the same people, and as far as I am concerned we still are, except for the &#8216;British&rsquo; who have their religious, cultural and racial routes in Asia or Africa. </p>
<p>It is sad Andrew Bolt has to hide behind these disclaimers. Still, he is the best we have.</p>

		<p>Everyone on AmRen seems to be worshiping Japan&hellip;.</p>
<p>I have been to Japan twice and there were times when I was certainly impressed, but there were also just as many times when I felt very awkward and wondered what on earth was going on in those people&rsquo;s minds&hellip;.</p>
<p>a perfect example:</p>
<p>bra for men, designed by a company in Japan</p>

<p>The CEO says the bra is designed so men would feel equal to women, and is designed to help very obese men.  </p>

		<p>In the &#8216;Post a Comment&rsquo;section, it is stated that &#8220;we encourage polite debate.&#8221; Andrew Bolt&rsquo;s comments constitute a piece of invective which has little reasoning and much name-calling. The basic concern of the writer is an anxiety about the spread of gang &#8216;culture&rsquo;, its extent, and the two-faced role of the Victorian police.<br>
The unwillingness of the police to call a spade a spade is frustrating, but comprehensible - why hand the media a headline? Any normal person knows that the media are a pack of dogs that will never analyse anything except easy questions.</p>

		<p>This sounds like a lot of big city police departments in the US. They regularly bury crime reports and fudge the results that are sent to the FBI. I don&rsquo;t think they have reached the levels of political correctness that you see in Great Britain and Australia, but they are well on their way. </p>
<p>Indianapolis is becoming more like Detroit on a daily basis. From time to time, the local fish wrap (aka &#8220;The Indianapolis Star&#8221;) will release names or pictures of suspected criminals. But usually only under duress. Three whites and one black kid who were involved in a hazing incident were front page news. The fact that there are videotapes of them &#8220;clowning around&#8221; in a holding cell didn&rsquo;t help their case. While I would agree that these kids need a swift kick or two, there are far more dangerous characters out there. </p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have the Chicago style gang bangers here (yet). So far, our biggest headache with the illegals are DUI&rsquo;s and vehicular manslaughter cases. I&rsquo;m curious to see what will happen when the number of whites in Indianapolis falls below critical mass and those who cannot run a productive society are the majority. </p>

<p>While Euro-peoples should certainly have larger families we would still face minority status in our own nations if our treasonous government continue to flood us with foreigners.  With a population of 1.2 billion India can afford to take over the US, Britain, Spain, etc. through migration and still be overpopulated.  Our biggest enemy is ethnic cleansing, aka migration!<br>
