<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} At least 10 other states  &mdash;  many inspired by Arizona  &mdash;  are talking about enacting similarly draconian legislation. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>* Oklahoma: The state has already passed a law that makes it harder for illegal immigrants to obtain IDs or public assistance, lets police check the immigration status of anyone they arrest, and makes it a felony to knowingly shelter or employ an illegal immigrant. A court has thus far barred the state from enforcing key provisions of the law.</p>
<p>* Missouri: The state legislature is considering a law that would make it unlawful for any person to conceal or shelter &#8220;illegal aliens,&#8221; and would also make it a crime for illegal immigrants to transport themselves. Similar local laws have in the past been declared unconstitutional.</p>
<p>* South Carolina: A GOP legislator just introduced a bill he says is &#8220;virtually the same&#8221; as Arizona&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>* Texas: A Republican lawmaker has said she plans to do the same when the legislative session starts in January.</p>
<p>* Ohio: Two Republicans  &mdash;  one a state legislator, the other a county sheriff  &mdash;  sent a letter recently to Gov. Ted Strickland, a Democrat, asking him to work &#8220;to assure legislation is passed that will mirror&#8221; Arizona&rsquo;s. Strickland has been non-committal.</p>
<p>* Colorado: Scott McInnis, the presumptive GOP nominee for governor, said this week that if elected, he&rsquo;d try to pass something &#8220;very similar&#8221; to Arizona&rsquo;s bill.</p>
<p>* Georgia: Nathan Deal, a former congressman and GOP gubernatorial candidate, also has said he intends to propose similar legislation to Arizona&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>* Utah: A GOP state lawmaker has advocated a bill that would make immigrants carry proof of status, and would ape Arizona by requiring police to question anyone they believe is an illegal immigrant. He says he &#8220;has the support to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>* Maryland: A Republican state legislator has said he plans to send a survey to state lawmakers and gubernatorial candidates to get them on the record as to whether they support Arizona&rsquo;s approach.</p>
<p>* North Carolina: An anti-immigration leader said this week: &#8220;I believe the chances similar legislation [to Arizona&rsquo;s] will be filed here is (sic) over 95 percent likely from what lawmakers are telling me.&#8221; Allied groups concede, though, that with a Democratic-controlled statehouse, such a bill might not get far.</p>

<p>Notice how, in the very first sentence, we&rsquo;re told what to think about this information.  Arizona&rsquo;s laws   &mdash;   which pretty much mirror the federal laws that aren&rsquo;t enforced   &mdash;   are &#8220;draconian,&#8221; and therefore harsh and unjust.  </p>

		<p>People are tired of the garbage that has come out of DC since B.O. got elected, and we&rsquo;re ready to take our country back.  AZ&rsquo;s law is nothing but a mirror of the federal law that is already on the books, so it really is not that big of a deal.  What IS the big deal is that people are now ready and willing to see to it that said laws are ENFORCED!!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Sanity is breaking out all over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Besides possibly causing the passage of the same kind of law in other states, illegal immigration is brought again to the fore and again in an unfavorable light. </p>
<p>And, in spite of their militant arrogant attitudes, these protesting Mexes just got a lot more people mad at them all over again.</p>
<p>Of course, the traitorous lamestream media stupidly sings their song, but it&rsquo;s beginning to look like that isn&rsquo;t going to help them too much.</p>
<p>And the community organizer&rsquo;s comments amount to an incitement to riot.  Has anybody ever known of another president&hellip;or his administration&hellip;utter anything close to provoking a racial fight?  This man has done just that, and I truly believe it&rsquo;s an impeachable offense.</p>
<p>The division between the races is getting wider thanks to the black liar who we now know lied about almost everything.</p>

		<p>States and local law enforcement used to arrest people for violating federal immigration laws. But congress knew local politicians and law enforcement were more accountable to their constituents than the fat cats in DC. Plus, one is more likely to enforce the law when illegals are flooding their own hometowns. So congress passed a law against local enforcement. See, by consolidating power at the federal level there is no accounability to the people. All the accountability is to the lobbyists in the agriculture, meatpacking, construction and hospitality industries who just love that cheap illegal labor.</p>
<p>So now the states are passing laws to give local law enforcement the power to do the same thing they used to do just a few years ago. And now the industry lobbyists don&rsquo;t like it and are having their trained chimps in Washington badmouthe their efforts. Why? Because they know it&rsquo;s going to work and they don&rsquo;t want it to work.</p>

<p>Yes you do.  This is typical media conditioning.  They&rsquo;re telling us it&rsquo;s Draconian to want to enforce our laws, as long as those laws keep out non-Whites.  It&rsquo;s Draconian to keep out non-Whites.  It&rsquo;s those evil White racists that are behind it they would have us believe.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s really going on is that states are going broke (if they aren&rsquo;t already there) and they&rsquo;re realizing that illegal immigrants are a key contributor to going broke because they take more in government services than they contribute in taxes, fees, etc.</p>

This is what Obama said at the W.H. Cinco de Drinko fiesta regarding Arizona law:</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;We can&rsquo;t start singling out people because of who they look like, or how they talk, or how they dress.&#8221; </p>
<p><br>
Good God - affirmative action, visible minorities, positive discrimination, the census, closing the gap, cultural credibility, diversity, multiculturalism, hate crime laws, the list goes on of all the rampant institutionalized discrimination in play - and this pin head says;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&rsquo;t start singling out people because of who they look like, or how they talk, or how they dress.&#8221; </p>

<p>Oh, Really? Obama singles out people for appointment to the bench and other federal offices because of who ( sic) they look like. </p>
<p>He does not disapprove of Democrat representatives in the Congress caucusing together because of what they look like. </p>
<p>He has taken no steps to discourage our federally subsidized universities who prefer applicants for admission because of what they look like.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The question is not that we can&rsquo;t start - too late for that - but when will we stop singling out people because of who they look like?</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s ironic that Legislator Draco is known for the worst part of his life but none of the good:</p>
<p>* Draco was the first Greek to codify law into written form which allowed for injustices to be dealt with by anyone who could read. All laws were hung outside so all could know the law and how to appeal their convictions.</p>
<p>* He invented the concept of &#8216;involuntary homicide&rsquo;, now known as manslaughter, and differentiated it from murder.</p>
<p>* He formed the first democratically elected constitutional legislation body, called the Council of Four Hundred.</p>
<p>* He was extremely popular in Athens because justice was originally controlled by a select few and he had effectively given it to all Free Men. It is said that he died from all the praise given to him because the traditional Greek way of giving thanks was to give a person items of clothing. It is said he suffocated from all the hats and cloaks that were showered upon him.</p>
