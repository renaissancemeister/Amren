<h1>Cuban Lawmakers Denounce Arizona Immigration Law</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Haven, Google News, May 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Cuban lawmakers have passed a resolution denouncing Arizona&rsquo;s new immigration law as &#8220;racist and xenophobic,&#8221; recalling an old dispute in the process: the argument that the United States&rsquo; purchase of Arizona from Mexico in the 19th century was tantamount to theft.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the denunciation of the law by Cuban lawmakers, who called it a &#8220;brutal violation of human rights,&#8221; is sure to raise anger among U.S. backers of the law.</p>
<p>The tightly controlled, communist-run island has long been criticized for its human rights record, which includes the jailing of 200 political prisoners, the banning of a free press and the outlawing of opposition political parties.</p>
<p>Cuban citizens are required to carry identification with them wherever they go, and can be stopped by police and sent home if they are found in a part of the island where they don&rsquo;t belong.</p>
<p>Havana bristles at criticism of its human rights record, saying its system provides deep food and housing subsidies, as well as free health care and education to all citizens, while capitalist countries are in the thrall of powerful corporations. It considers the dissidents to be paid mercenaries of Washington.</p>
<p>The lawmakers&rsquo; resolution, dated Wednesday and reprinted in the Communist Party daily Granma on Thursday, says the Arizona law &#8220;has a profound racist and xenophobic character, and permits police to use racial profiling.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The lawmakers said the Arizona measure &#8220;aims to close the doors on immigrants to territories that were stolen by force from the noble Mexican people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mexico was forced to sell most of the territory that is now Arizona to the United States in 1848 following its defeat in the Mexican-American war. {snip}</p>

		<p>Here is an idea. Give any illegal Mexicans apprehended here the option of going to Cuba,and see how many will go for it.And make the results of their choices known to Cuba and the Casstros.They would not even have to learn English! </p>

		<p>Why don&rsquo;t all these people butt out of America&rsquo;s business? How we enforce our immigration laws is our business. Cuba certainly enforces its&rsquo; immigration laws very harshly.  Cuba needs to clean up its own backyard. As for stealing, Mexico sold Arizona, that&rsquo;s right, SOLD it. It wasn&rsquo;t forced, Mexico considered Arizona desert wasteland (it was at the time), it was virtually empty and Mexico wanted the money for it, for which they were well paid. It wasn&rsquo;t until the gringo made something of it, that Mexico made it an issue. Don&rsquo;t these Hispanics realize that it&rsquo;s not the land, it&rsquo;s the PEOPLE that make something a success.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Cuban lawmakers&#8221; is an oxymoron.  Who cares (besides Michael Moore, anyway) what a bunch of tinpot Stalinists have to say about anything?</p>
<p>&#8220;Havana bristles at criticism of its human rights record&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Poor babies.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;saying its system provides deep food and housing subsidies, as well as free health care and education to all citizens&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And in the process took what was once a fairly prosperous agricultural society and reduced it to the level of a Third World country, now and for all time!  You&rsquo;ll find more real Cubans in New Jersey than in Cuba.</p>
<p>&#8220;The lawmakers said the Arizona measure &ldquo;aims to close the doors on immigrants to territories that were stolen by force from the noble Mexican people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moral of this story: don&rsquo;t go to war with someone if you can&rsquo;t win it!  </p>
<p>Fact: the United States offered to peacefully purchase Mexico&rsquo;s northern territories, which Mexico rejected.  </p>
<p>Fact: at the time the government of Mexico was frequently changing hands due to widespread political instability.  </p>
<p>Fact:  the United States wanted the territories to offset British expansion into the region. At the time Great Britain was still unquestionably the most powerful country on earth (and not yet our friends).  It took the United States less than 19 months to defeat Mexico.  It would have probably taken the Brits less than half that time, if even.  Either way, Mexico&rsquo;s hold on those territories was transient.  The Mexicans are kidding themselves if they believe otherwise.</p>
<p>By the way, it&rsquo;s widely known among historical scholars there was hardly anyone living in most of what is now the American Southwest back in those days.  Under all those circumstances, I&rsquo;d hardly call it &#8216;stealing,&rsquo; but then again, non-Whites have never been hesitant to twist the truth against Whitey when it suits their interests.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Cuba instructs US on &ldquo;human rights.&rdquo; </p>
<p>They ARE experts on human rights all right.  If someone declares he has a right to speak freely in Cuba his human rights consist of a bullet to the brain or if he begs hard enough they might just hang him by his thumbs in a dungeon for a few years until he gets his mind right.</p>
<p>Executions were so numerous, involving such great numbers of victims, there&rsquo;s not many left in Cuba who complain about human rights.</p>
<p>Cuba today would be like the America of tomorrow if they employed Cuban human rights strategies and tortured, imprisoned and executed all the millions of tea partiers, plus about a 100 million others who belong to organizations that oppose this present administration. </p>

<p>The American government paid the Mexican government for the very expansive cessation of land that is now the American southwest, that was part of the war spoils.  We didn&rsquo;t need to pay Mexico anything, but we did anyway.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a few years after the end of the M-A War, and after the territorial cessation, the American government did a straight purchase of even more land from Mexico.  It was called the Gadsden Purchase, consummated in late 1853.  The purpose was to have some relatively flat land for a potential southern trans-continental railroad (this was even before the first one, the Union and Central Pacific, was started).  The Gadsden Purchase is what is now southern Arizona and far southwestern New Mexico south of the Gila River.  If you know anything about Arizona geography, then you&rsquo;ll know that using mid-19th century building technology, an E-W railroad line would have been impossible to build either across what is now central AZ (Mogollon Rim), northern AZ (Grand Canyon), or southern Utah (numerous buttes and formations).  Since the CP-UP was slated to go through northern Utah, pushing a southern transcon route up to Central Utah seemed rather redundant.  The solution was south, but that was still Mexico.  So the US bought a little bit more land for a little bit more money.</p>
<p>If the Mexicans want to say we &#8220;stole&#8221; the Southwest, then fine.  Give them back the Mex-Am War spoil, but we keep the Gadsden Purchase, b/c we bought that fair and square.</p>

		<p>Check the history of the Mexican War (1846-48) and you&rsquo;ll find that not only did Mexico lose it, they also started it. The Mexican government threatened war if the U.S. annexed Texas. Then Mexico sent troops north of the Rio Grande and fired on American soldiers (the Thornton Affair).</p>
<p>Emerging victorious, even occupying Mexico City, the U.S. could have annexed the whole country, but President Polk wisely refrained from seizing heavily populated land. We had the sense then not to merge with Mexico. Besides assuming Mexico&rsquo;s debt to U.S. citizens, and other magnanimous gestures, the U.S. agreed in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and subsequent agreements to allow Mexicans in the Southwest to stay, granted them citizenship, and guaranteed their property. Their descendants still live there now. </p>
<p>After losing the war they started, not only did Mexico sign the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, and accept payment and other compensation for mostly empty land they&rsquo;d hardly controlled since their independence in 1821, land which was never even Aztec land, Mexico even sold the U.S. more land later with no war: the Gadsden Purchase of 1853. In 1954, Mexico cooperated with the Eisenhower Administration&rsquo;s successful mass deportation, &ldquo;Operation Wetback.&rdquo; Thus, a generous peace was made long ago, both with Mexico and Mexicans in the Southwest, which both countries embraced   &mdash;   until we became PC patsies.</p>
<p>Please just remember that today&rsquo;s illegal aliens clearly have ZERO historical, legal or moral claims. </p>
<p>Besides, do Mexicans break and enter the U.S. because it &#8220;really&#8221; belongs to Mexico, or because it ISN&rsquo;T Mexico? If they wanted to live in Mexico, wouldn&rsquo;t they stay there? What about places they invade that were never Mexico&rsquo;s, like Chicago, New York or Canada? If the Southwest rightfully belongs to them, then do the 13 Colonies still rightfully belong to Great Britain? Does Mexico itself belong to Spain? Then there&rsquo;s the hypocrisy of their own immigration policies, such as using their army against Guatemalans who enter Mexico, and denying foreigners the right to even protest.</p>
<p>In short, why do their absurd claims even get a hearing?</p>

		<p>President Obama no doubt highly values Cuba&rsquo;s human rights advice. Google pics of his lovefest with Venezuela&rsquo;s anti-American, Castro-wannabe President Chavez. They looked ready to neck! </p>
<p>And didn&rsquo;t American diplomats just tell the Chinese we&rsquo;re worse than they are on human rights due to Arizona&rsquo;s new law? The Chinese must have chuckled at that crack. They&rsquo;ll expect Obama to bow everytime they meet him, now. </p>
<p>Count on &#8220;our&#8221; government to grovel before the Cuban communists, and pledge to make full amends to those poor, wronged Mexican invaders.<br>

<p><br>
Now, this is a key element that should be explained to all the la Raza people: there was a war, the mexicans lost, and a treaty was signed. So, purely from a legal point of view, Arizona and other such territories, no longer belong to the Mexicans. So the whole &#8220;reconquista&#8221; is not legitimate. It&rsquo;s more like an attempt to rewrite history, or a wish to get some kind of revenge.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s call it for what it is! I personally have had it with the Edward James Olmos types, among Latino celebrities, who are so openly pro-Aztlan, or pro-reconquista.</p>

		<p>Do not forget that any Mexican Nationals in the territory after the signing of the Treaty of Hidalgo were welcomed as new American Citizens, with our government recognizing all Spanish land grants etc. as owned and recognized property. Any &#8216;Mexicans&rsquo; who had the right to be there were already there, and their decendants are still there&hellip;supporting 1070 that protects them as much as us from the criminal invaders pouring over the southern border.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Obama seems totally incapable of standing up for his own country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obama doesn&rsquo;t regard this country as his own.  He thinks of it as occupied territory that belongs to blacks and other non-whites, and he&rsquo;s determined to see that the land our ancestors fought for and settled and made unimaginable sacrifices for is given to non-whites  &mdash;    &mdash;  but mostly blacks  &mdash;    &mdash;  - with perhaps a token given to whitey.</p>
<p>He believes as other black leaders do that blacks are not included in the many professions, because they have been the subjects of oppression and racism.  He does not believe the thousands of tests, life experiences, etc, that prove blacks cannot achieve on the same level as whites&hellip;or other races for that matter. He even appointed an unqualified black to head NASA.  I&rsquo;m betting this pitiful man could never pass a basic test in science on the high school level. </p>
<p>These are the &#8220;wrongs&#8221; he refers to when he apologizes to totalitarian heads of state when he visits them.</p>
<p>To this warped man true justice is blacks integrated into every facet of American society despite ability or qualifications just like South Africa where the country continues to deteriorate to third world levels every day.</p>
<p>In fact, South Africa today is an excellent example of what America would look like after 8 years of this President.</p>
<p>And the majority of the blame for such a scenario would go to a VERY large degree to the leftist whites mostly in the media and the out-of-touch white fools who support him.<br>

		<p>&ldquo;Mexico was forced to sell most of the territory that is now Arizona to the United States in 1848 following its defeat in the Mexican-American war.&rdquo;<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Well, guess what? &hellip; That&rsquo;s what happens when you lose a war! And so it has been down through the ages. Anything unusual or unique about that?</p>
<p>Suppose every country in the world decides to renege on treaties and restore themselves to a former condition! Imagine the wars that would cause!!!  Suppose the Queen of England decides to consider the USA her colonies again!  Suppose Italy decides to reassert its ownership of France and Britain!</p>
<p>And btw, how did Mexico gain claim to those territories anyway?  The natives there were NOT Spanish-speaking (nor Aztec either), and they did NOT invite Mexicans to come in and fly their flag. They did not consider themseives to be Mexicans.  (And as pointed out above, there were very few Mexicans in those territories anyway.)</p>
<p>Much of the Southwest, particularly Arizona, is a desert. Most of the year it is an oven. In the 1800&rsquo;s hardly anyone wanted to live there. The only thing that makes it inhabitable today is irrigation and electricity (air conditioning)   &mdash;   both introduced and developed by whites. Now that it is flourishing and productive, the Mexicans want it back!</p>
<p>I could add that the USA had in fact conquered a lot more territory than it chose to keeep (including all of Lower California), but the Americans decided to give it back. They did not have to do that.  They should have kept it all.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly certain any of what has been said about Obama&rsquo;s idealogy is entirely correct.  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, he is pretty clear and out in the open about what he supposedly believes (fascist, race based marxism).  And the groups that support this were largely responsible for getting him elected.</p>
<p>But I can&rsquo;t help but notice that those same groups are very upset with him now for NOT supporting their agendas.</p>
<p>Obama is FOR SALE.  And the usual people simply offered him more money than the fascist race based marxists.  That&rsquo;s why he governs exactly the same way Bush did&hellip;.except he is willing to be more extreme about it.  He&rsquo;s willing to do more for less money.</p>
<p>Bush was a high class whore.  Obama is more a $5 crack whore.</p>
<p>Heck, if we could raise enough money, he&rsquo;d turn into a white nationalist if we bribed him enough.  That amount is probably alot lower than people would think.</p>

		<p>Ulysses S. Grant, who served in the war against Mexico;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Generally, the officers of the army were indifferent whether the annexation was consummated or not; but not so all of them. For myself, I was bitterly opposed to the measure, and to this day regard the war, which resulted, as one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation. It was an instance of a republic following the bad example of European monarchies, in not considering justice in their desire to acquire additional territory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Southern rebellion was largely the outgrowth of the Mexican war. Nations, like individuals, are punished for their transgressions. We got our punishment in the most sanguinary and expensive war of modern times.&#8221;</p>

<p>That about sums it up for all those names you posted.  It was their BELIEF this war was &#8216;unjust&rsquo;.  Consensus is a rare thing in politics.  There were people in this country who felt we shouldn&rsquo;t have gone to war with the Axis powers, even after they declared war on us.  Need I remind you there were people in America who thought the Louisiana Purchase was &#8220;unconstitutional&#8221;?</p>

<p>Odd, I don&rsquo;t recall reading any of these people making this claim saying we should have given it back to the French.</p>
<p>Tell me, what did Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant do while holding the office of President to &#8220;right this wrong&#8221;?  End of story.</p>

<p>&#8220;Henry David Thoreau wrote &lsquo;Civil Disobedience&rsquo; as a protest against the US war against Mexico.&#8221;</p>
<p>What is your point in all of your quotes?  The Southwest US was remote, and the war between Mexico and the US was started by Mexico.</p>
<p>If you love Mexico so much, why don&rsquo;t you relocate?  I think you would bemuch happier there.</p>
<p>Incidentally, you never included any quotes from the scores of people who felt defending the US against Mexico was more than justified.</p>
<p>And, of course, you believe that murdering the survivors of the Alamo by Santa Ana was justified too, don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>The moral of the story is:  If you yank on superman&rsquo;s cape you&rsquo;re<br>
apt to get your teeth knocked in.  And when you do, don&rsquo;t whine about what you had coming to you.</p>

<p>&#8220;Obama seems totally incapable of standing up for his own country.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because he was raised mostly offshore and in foreign countries by a mother who not only hated whites, especially white males, but her own country.  I can imagine the dinner time conversations, can&rsquo;t you?  No fortuitous propulsion by political fluke into the top office in the land can counter such deeply seated notions, implanted so early, like a religion.</p>
<p>But BHO seems to be mostly hiding behind his desk and coming out when he can appoint another committee to take responsibility for future mistakes or grandstand with another America hater.  What he has the talent for is jive, but in the tongue of the white man.  The emptiness behind the jive is beginning to become painfully evident to even his own supporters, the most ferverent of whom must shreak with outrage when confronted with statistical facts about the negative effects of his misrule.  </p>
<p>I experienced this firsthand when I got a phone call from an old friend - who was I found, a polarized Obama supporter.  He severed our friendship permanently because I sent him proof that California is no longer a white majority state - something he vehemently denied.  Now, he has lost an old white friend in service of his allegiance to a man and a set of ideals that are set to eliminate his kind from existence.  This sort of denial of reality is usually termed &#8220;true belief,&#8221; and it functions to perpetuate most of the things that truly hold us back.<br>
