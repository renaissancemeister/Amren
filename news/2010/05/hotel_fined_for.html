<h1><a href="http://www.thelocal.se/26780/20100521/">Hotel Fined for Guest Slur at Discrimination Seminar</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Vinthagen Simpson, The Local (Stockholm), May 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Swedish appeals court has ruled that a Norrköping hotel was guilty of discriminating against a guest who was participating at a conference on ethnic discrimination at the time.</p>
<p>The court upheld a district court ruling in favour of the Discrimination Ombudsman (Diskrimineringsombudsman  &mdash;  DO) who had taken up the woman&rsquo;s case, and ordered the hotel to pay 8,000 kronor ($1,000) in compensation plus interest and court costs.</p>
<p>The woman, whose is member of Sweden&rsquo;s Roma community, was attending the conference at the Elite Grand Hotel in Norrköping in eastern Sweden when she was repeatedly asked by staff as to why she was there.</p>
<p>According to court documents three different members of staff approached the woman and asked her whether she was a guest at the hotel. At one point she was informed that the coffee which she was helping herself to at the time was for the consumption of paying guests only.</p>
<p>The woman was in Norrköping to attend a conference addressing the subject of ethnic discrimination and she later reported the hotel to DO.</p>
<p>The hotel responded, in its defence, that it had previously had problems with Roma and thefts, an explanation the hotel later changed, arguing instead that staff are instructed to check the identity of all guests that they don&rsquo;t immediately recognise.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is almost impossible to imagine that hotel staff in practice approach every single guest that they do not immediately recognize,&#8221; the court stated in response to the hotel&rsquo;s explanation.</p>
<p>The court furthermore ruled that the Grand Hotel had not sufficiently been able to prove that the woman had not suffered insult or injury as a result of the discrimination and thus remained liable to pay the damages awarded by district court.</p>
<p>The Elite Grand Hotel Norrköping&rsquo;s general manager, Krister Eriksson, told The Local on Friday that he was unwilling to comment further on the case.<br>

		<p>What&rsquo;s really funny about this is that she probably stole the hotel blind and wasn&rsquo;t caught in the act and now she gets an extra $1000 from the hotel because of the courts. </p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>In other words, based on her allegation alone, they were  guilty until proven innocent.  <br>
And they were  unable to prove themselves innocent!</p>
<p>Incidentally, this is a 4-star spa hotel.  I wonder what organization was paying her bill?   (Certainly not she.)<br>
 <br>
How interesting that she was attending a conference on discrimination at the time!  Is that where she picked up the idea?</p>

<p>The truth is no defense.</p>

		<p>Not that I know much about the Roma beyond what I read here and hear from co workers (all bad I might add) these people can be muslims, catholics or anything else and are just as likely to be black which would most likely explain the situation the hotel found itself in here. How does one say GHETTO LOTTERY in Swedish?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve had the misfortune of dealing with gypsies while vacationing in Europe. How anyone could trust them or not suspect them of stealing is beyond me. But no, in today&rsquo;s backwards world, we&rsquo;re supposed to give the gypsies and all other non-whites the benefit of the doubt, much at the expense of our own people.</p>

		<p>How ironic (and hypocritical) that this woman would be &#8220;discriminated&#8221; against at a discrimination seminar! It seems that while one minute liberlas bemoan discrimination, the next minute they are engaging in it!</p>

<p><br>
Yeah!  What a perfect place! Is that what they were teaching at the seminar   &mdash;   how to fill out the forms?   </p>
<p>Apparently this woman learned her lessons well and lost no time in appying them.  She couldn&rsquo;t wait!  All that free money in Sweden. It would be interesting to follow through and see how many more complaints she  files over the next several years! Not to mention all her relatives.</p>

		<p>I think the most illuminating way to describe Roma to readers here at Amren who are unfamiliar with them would be to pass on a story from a friend of mine who was vacationing in Italy.</p>
<p>There was a Roma woman (elderly, likely over fifty years of age) begging for money at a traffic stop.  Out of nowhere, she bends over and scrapes something off the bottom of her foot (she was bare footed) and puts it in her mouth and begins chewing.  This was shortly after he was robbed by roughly twelve Roma children who crowded him begging for money (he found out very shortly afterward his wallet had mysteriously gone missing).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen homeless people with more dignity and self-respect than that.</p>
