<h1>Left Is Mute on Racial Double Standard in Kagan Pick</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Roland S. Martin, CNN, May 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>If a white Republican president of the United States appointed a white male as his next Supreme Court justice, and upon the inspection of his record, it was discovered that of the 29 full-time tenured or tenured track faculty he hired as dean of Harvard Law, nearly all of them were white men, this would dominate the headlines.</p>
<p>It would be reasonable to conclude that the special interest groups that vigorously fight for diversity  &mdash;  civil rights organizations, feminist groups and other liberal institutions  &mdash;  would be up in arms, declaring that this person&rsquo;s records showed him unwilling to diversify academia, and unqualified to consider diverse views as one of nine members of the U.S. Supreme Court. There would be widespread condemnations of Republicans having no concern for the nonwhite males in America.</p>
<p>But what if the choice were made by a black Democratic president, and it was a woman? A white woman? A white Democratic woman?</p>
<p>Some of you may not like the fact that I am focusing on the race of the individual, but when diversity is raised, the person&rsquo;s skin color, gender and background are considered germane to the discussion. And if there is silence from black and female organizations, their race and gender matter as well.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Guy-Uriel Charles, founding director of the Duke Law Center on Law, Race and Politics, has heavily scrutinized Kagan&rsquo;s hiring record as head of Harvard Law School. In a scathing blog post, he has said that of the 29 positions Kagan had a chance to fill, 28 were white and one was Asian-American. And of the group, only six were women  &mdash;  five white and one Asian-American.</p>
<p>These numbers on the surface are appalling, and would be ripped to shreds by those who value diversity, but my gut tells me that even though Kagan has been tapped by Obama, the normally vocal and persistent voices in this area will be tight-lipped and quiet, unwilling to oppose or heavily criticize the nomination of a woman to the court, and especially one made by an African-American Democratic president.</p>
<p>If that does happen, Republicans will rightly cry foul, saying it represented a double standard  &mdash;  that the silence was a signal of partisan hacks more concerned about not offending the Obama administration, rather than the ideals they hold near and dear.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to be seen as going against an ally, and they are more concerned about their access to the White House than the mission they have always valued.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So basically, the White House wants everyone to believe that Kagan made offers, but nearly all of the minorities chose not to go to work for the most prestigious law school in America.</p>
<p>Folks, I wasn&rsquo;t born yesterday.</p>
<p>The real issue will be reaction from the left. It is shameful and disgusting when civil rights organizations, feminist groups and others lose their conviction and sense of purpose when a Democrat gets in the White House. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The Black Women&rsquo;s Roundtable of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation released a letter Sunday night questioning Kagan&rsquo;s commitment to civil rights, as well as criticizing the Obama administration for its failure to seriously consider African-American female judges.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we continue to promote the legacy of our late founding leader and Co-Convener, Dr. Dorothy I. Height, we will always seek to highlight the concerns of Black women, our families and our communities. Thus, as Dr. Height stated in our previous meeting with your Administration, we believe it is time for African American women to be represented in all sectors of government  &mdash;  including the Supreme Court of the United States, which in its 221 year history has not had a Black woman nominated to serve on our highest court in the land,&#8221; the letter stated.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Demanding accountability about diversity isn&rsquo;t a one-way street meant only for Republicans. Democrats should never get a pass either.</p>

		<p>Obama is such a shameless bean-counter. He appointed Senora Sotomayor to the Supreme Court because she was a &#8220;two-fer&#8221;- female and Hispanic.</p>
<p>Now he nominates Ellen Kagan because she&rsquo;s a &#8220;three-fer&#8221; - female, Jewish and gay. </p>

		<p>I predict that there will be an intranicene food fight within the Democrat Party when the rubber hits the road to get Elena Kagan confirmed.  It will mainly be black vs Jewish and/or a black vs GLBTQ fight.  Roland Martin is merely firing the first salvo.</p>
<p>Since Obama&rsquo;s first SCOTUS pick was Sonie the Phony, I doubt the Hispanic/Raza types will whine this time around.</p>

		<p>I started to offer points in rebuttal, then I saw it was Roland Martin who &#8220;wrote&#8221; the article.  </p>
<p>First of all, let me say that I debated this clown in an exchange of emails once that was quite extensive, and while he isn&rsquo;t quite illiterate his ideas, phraseology and inane points of contention appear to come from a child.</p>
<p>Someone helps him with these articles.  Before I refute anything he says I&rsquo;d like to know who it is I&rsquo;m arguing with.  It certainly isn&rsquo;t him.</p>

		<p>He&rsquo;s trying to say whites are evil, but that&rsquo;s not &#8216;insensitive&rsquo;. Whites seem to inhabit a sort of racelessness, where nothing can be considered offensive to them regardless and they are always in the role of oppressor. Anything else, might be insensitive. I suppose this strategy on CNN works. Instead of calling on others to improve, the call is for anyone who is not a white heterosexual male, to be promoted, regardless. Should we defend nominee Kagan, on this issue, under the warning of &#8216;first they came for&hellip;&rsquo;?</p>

<p>I am ashamed that White Scientists have not yet learned how to clone Roland Martin. We need more of him on TV and everywhere. No one shows White America the incompetency and thorough unattractiveness of afrovoodooamerika than does Roland Martin.  His position in the media projects him as someone with something worthwhile or wise to say, but as soon as he opens his mouth, that lie comes streaming into all White Homes still watching CNN.</p>
<p>If CNN thinks he&rsquo;s important, then God Bless CNN! He is important, to us, that is.</p>
<p>We need more of that media Race Lie being broadcast into more White Homes.  Cloned copies of Roland Martin would help greatly in our growing White Awakening.</p>
<p>Roland Martin on multiple TV shows at the same time, and on the lecture circuit speaking at several colleges at the same time would be a huge leap forward in the right direction for our White People.  Just seeing him and hearing him does our White Cause more good than will the next afrovoodoo Race Riot or afrovoodoo interracial robbery, rape, or murder.  </p>
<p>Roland said <blockquote>Some of you may not like the fact that I am focusing on the race of the individual, but when diversity is raised, the person&rsquo;s skin color, gender and background are considered germane to the discussion.</blockquote></p>
<p>Wrong, Rolly!  </p>
<p>We love it when afrovoodoos focus on the race of White People! We love seeing afrovoodoos exercising their Diversity Race Privilege.  Every time you do, we get more recruits. Please keep talking about Race, especially my Race!</p>
<p>As the White Nurse at the Urban Hospital said, &#8220;Before I started working here, I wasn&rsquo;t a racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every grotesque expression and incompetent sentence that we get from Roland Martin just sends more White Nurses into our ranks.</p>

		<p>Post-racial America.  Was there ever a bigger lie than that liberal claptrap?  There has been more whining about race in the last 18 months than any other time in history I would bet.  It is literally all these people think about.  Just imagine that.  All day every day, race, race, race and only race.  The sooner this country breaks apart along racial lines the better all of our lives will be. </p>

<p>I concur. It seems the court percentage wise is mostly, Catholic, black, and jewish.(maybe homosexnual) Now Kaglan&rsquo;s friends are out there denying she is a lesbian..Now, who would buy into that one? </p>

I wish that were true, Jed. But think of all the thousands of hours of TV time that&rsquo;s been given to anti-white buffoons like Sharpton and Jackson and Farrakhan and Cornel West and so many more. If repeated exposure to the above race pimps and pseudo-intellectuals hasn&rsquo;t caused a widespread &#8220;awakening&#8221; of white ethnic solidarity   &mdash;   and, let&rsquo;s face it, it hasn&rsquo;t, certainly not to the extent the average AmRenner would like to see happen   &mdash;   then I&rsquo;m not convinced an &#8220;all Roland, all the time&#8221; channel would do the trick either. </p>
<p>As for what WILL finally wake up Mr. &amp; Mrs. Willard Winnebago, I&rsquo;m not sure. But because white people are so forgiving and so empathetic to others, that no amount of televised insults to the white race   &mdash;   even from clearly unworthy adversaries like the scoundrels listed above   &mdash;   ever seems to reach the threshold. I suppose it will take not just words, but violence. Most of our fellow caucasians need to be <i>literally</i> knocked over the head to get it. </p>
<p>Sad, but some people can only learn the hard way. </p>

		<p>Roland Martin has a point&hellip;.there has never been a black woman on the US Supreme Court. Of course, there have not been very many emminent jurists in this country&rsquo;s history that were black women to pick from.</p>
<p>Lemmie see&hellip;..black Americans are 13% of the US population. One black US Supreme Court Justice is 12% of the total court. That is very close to proportionate representation, it seems clear. So an additional black justice would be twice their proportion in the population.</p>
<p>OK&hellip;.Hispanic Americans are 14% of the US population&hellip;.and, Lordy be, there is a Hispanic justice on the Supreme Court&hellip;.which is very close to the 12% proportion of the court.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has 9 members and only two are women, so clearly, women are under-represented on the court&hellip;.but what kind of woman should it be? There is no justification, on a racial basis, for another black or hispanic. Both are fully represented on the court&hellip;..but there has never been an Asian member of the Supreme Court. And since the retiring justice is the last remaining Protestant on the Court, the Asian female should be Protestant. (Right now, there is one Protestant&hellip;the rest of the Supreme Court are Roman Catholic and Jewish.)</p>
<p>Jews are 1.7% of the US population. Christians are 78.5% of the US population&hellip;&hellip;broken down as 51.3% of the US are Protestant and 23.9% of the US are Roman Catholic. It seems obvious that Jews are wildly over-represented on the Supreme Court by any measure. If Elena Kagan (Jewish) is appointed to replace the only Protestant on the Supreme Court&hellip;.there will be three Jews and six Roman Catholics. Apparently, three Jews are too many and the present six Roman Catholics are too many too. Less than a fourth of the US population is Roman Catholic, so there should be only two Roman Catholics on the Supreme Court. There should not be any Jewish Supreme Court Justices&hellip;..and it does not matter if they are lesbian, or fat, or have a Germanic surname. The Court&hellip;..our Court&hellip;&hellip;should represent us and we should trust them to be proportionate and even handed. I do not buy the nonsense of the &#8220;wise Latina&#8221;.</p>

<p> Apparently you were, Mr. Martin!   Or so it would certainly  appear.  Were you really born so dumb?  All you can see   &mdash;   like most blacks   &mdash;   is race, race, race.  But there is more  in involved here than just black and white. <br>
  <br>
Martin fails to understand that he is a minority only once, but she is a minority thrice!  And some minorities can outweigh other minorities! She is a  member in full standing  of the Insiders&rsquo; Club and a first rate representative of the liberal  &mdash;  minority coalition  on three counts, as  M. Grant detailed in post#1.   That&rsquo;s a triple win for the Obama administration.  <br>
Martin just doesn&rsquo;t get it!</p>

		<p>This mentally vacuous fool makes the case &#8220;everytime&#8221; for separatism.  Intelligent mental exercise means anything, the law of the land means nothing, it all comes down to race.  Rolly is a race man, as is our Kenyan President.  Race, race, and more race.  Just like the panthers or la raza.  No caps by design.</p>
<p>People just get it&hellip;grip and acknowledge it, the white race is no longer essential (except for taxes), the other races and genders count, not ours.</p>
<p>The only thing that could make Kagan more significant would be a physical affliction.  </p>

		<p>Kagan is no surprise following the appointment of Sotomayor. I had expected Obama would appoint a black man or woman, perhaps Halle Berry. But he&rsquo;s obviously hoping the remaining white men die off while he&rsquo;s in office, these being CJ John Roberts, J Paul Srevens, Anthony Kennedy, Samuel Alito and Stephen Breyer. There&rsquo;s a good chance minorities and women will dominate the court by the end of a second Obama term, if such a catastrophe occurs.</p>
<p>He followed Clinton&rsquo;s lead in appointing Kagan. He had wanted her to be Solicitor-General, a position for which she was ill-equipped having never appeared before the Supreme Court as an attorney. But Obama used his control of Congress to force her appointment to that position. Then, within a year, though she has never held a judicial position she is elevated to the Supreme Court. She has no proven capacity as a high level advocate, nor any experience as a judge. Her only qualification is that she wants homosexuals in the US military. Obviously genuinely suitable candidates with the views Obama needs to keep homosexual voters on side are thin on the ground, if not non-existent.</p>
<p>His appointment of Sotomayor was even less warranted. She is effectively illiterate, having used an amanuensis to do her law assignments. Her qualifications were being a Hispanic woman, and condemning white privilege, seeing it as a justification for leniency in the sentences she passed down to black and Hispanic criminals, in her New York Federal District judgeship, and then nominated by President Bill Clinton to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, vacated by J. Daniel Mahoney, in 1997. Her career is more in keeping with a conventional judicial cursus honorum, but her decisions and reasoning are notable for irrational bias. </p>
<p>But who would expect anything else?</p>

		<p>If we were really committed to diversity, the next Supreme Court nominee would not be a Jew or a Catholic. I have nothing against Jews or Catholics, but why can&rsquo;t we have at least ONE Protestant Christian on the court?</p>
<p>For that matter, how about having at least ONE supreme court justice who isn&rsquo;t the product of the Ivy League? Again, I have nothing against the Ivies, but aren&rsquo;t there some other good law schools in the country? Why not a nominee from the U. of Chicago, or Duke, or something?</p>
