<h1><a href="https://www.ocregister.com/news/young-74675-ocprint-life-group.html">Group Splits on Racial Lines</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brittany Levine, Orange County Register, May 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Young Life is a religious group that tries to keep teenagers out of trouble. But to do that in a city like San Clemente, where group leaders say teens seem to be more comfortable in their own demographic clusters, the groups are separated along racial lines.</p>
<p>Young Life has been in San Clemente for two decades, but three years ago it began a downtown chapter to focus primarily on Latino teens, a population that wasn&rsquo;t joining the original group based at San Clemente High School. Young Life leaders say their group, which has hundreds of chapters worldwide and focuses on connecting adolescents to Jesus, is separated in San Clemente because they want teens to feel comfortable. Having a single chapter may discourage one demographic from joining, leaders say.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At a recent Young Life pancake breakfast at Max Berg Plaza Park, some students said the nonprofit has changed their lives by steering them away from bad choices. But many said they wish the two chapters didn&rsquo;t have to be separated.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s Hispanics, then there&rsquo;s white people,&#8221; said Saul Bonea, who was a Young Life member before graduating from high school last year. &#8220;I mean, if everybody came because everybody is a child of God, that&rsquo;s good. But there&rsquo;s still race stuff in existence, and it always gets us in trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>By trouble, the 19-year-old, who wants to work in ministry, meant fights. Teens said there have long been tensions among certain cliques at the high school, some of which are divided along racial lines. Group leaders say they were aware of those tensions and that&rsquo;s why they thought it would be best to make a new chapter. Last school year, San Clemente High enrollment was 73 percent white and 19 percent Latino, according to Capistrano Unified School District data.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thrash said it is not uncommon for Young Life to have a downtown group and a suburban group in the same city.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While many teens echoed Mota&rsquo;s enthusiasm, several said they&rsquo;d prefer if everyone could just get along. The two groups have mixers such as beach bonfires about every five weeks, but usually they are awkward, some youths said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would rather have it all together. There should be no separation between the races,&#8221; said Francisco Martinez, 17. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Young Life leaders say San Clemente&rsquo;s two groups eventually will merge, but it may take some time.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s just my opinion here, because things religious and spiritual are always highly subjective.  But I think Mr. Monea should be a little more careful with his New Testament   &mdash;   Christ Himself said that we should give unto Ceasar&rsquo;s what is Ceasar&rsquo;s and give unto God&rsquo;s what is God&rsquo;s.  My interpretation of that is that Christians are both part of a Church and human beings in the world.  That means they, as humans in this world, have obligations indicative of which race, ethnicity or tribe of their kinship, and duties as a citizen, subject or slave of a political entity.</p>
<p>The long and short of it?  There is white and there is Hispanic, no matter how much of God either has.</p>

		<p>Right on, righton, Question D!</p>
<p>But notice that the goal of this Christian organization is racial equality an mixing, not racial individualism.</p>
<p>I, myself, went to a Young Life camp in Colorado in the late &#8216;60&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I swear, all the head honcho talked about was Willie Mays. What would Willie Mays do? What DID Willie Mays do? Blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>As these were the days when Blacks (a few!) were included, the Young Life Blacks were treated like young gods!</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t blame the Blacks, I blame the Christian Whites!</p>
<p>But, to be honest, no one knew what to do. I blame the leaders for putting us in that situation. Yes, the Christian leaders.</p>

		<p>Question Diversity makes an excellent point. There are other things in the Bible which suppot ethno-nationalism and anti-miscegenation, such as the fatc that God, in the Old Testament, creates nations and says that they will not be abolished until End Times, or something like that. I haven&rsquo;t read muh of it but going by what others have told me,a nd what can be found on the internet, it sounds like the Bible is actually sufficiently supportive of our cause.</p>
<p>In fact, this segregation among a Christian youth body is more evidence of that.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interestign about Orange County is that it is a satellite of the Bible Belt, but it is also relatively supportive of nationalist movements, so I&rsquo;ve heard.</p>

		<p>For those who don&rsquo;t know, San Clemente is one of SoCA&rsquo;s most affluent areas, located on the beach not too far north of San Diego.  Pres. Nixon once had a home there.  A lot of very wealthy folk still populate the area today.  It isn&rsquo;t surprising to me that the kids would feel better meeting in their own groups, separated by race.  White teens from wealthy families live a lifestyle that poor Hispanic kids don&rsquo;t even know exists - the white kids go skiing at Aspen for a couple of weeks in winter, and spend their summers in Europe!  The mammoth difference between rich and poor would be more of an aggravation than a help to any effort to meld the groups.  I say let &#8216;em stay separate.  It would be healthier for all. The libs would want to redistribute the wealth - but I say that each person attracts his or her economic state by their own consciousness.  The rich have earned their position, and so have the poor.  And NOTHING is a guarantee - anybody can change their status whenever they choose to do the work that&rsquo;s required for it.</p>

		<p>Spiritually, Christians are one in Christ.  Physically, we are still of different races (for now).</p>
<p>Some people take the &#8220;we are one in Christ&#8221; and twist it around.  &#8220;See, there&rsquo;s no black and white!&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, know where that can go?  Gays can use that to their advantage.  &#8220;See  &mdash;  no male and female!&#8221;  Yet the Bible condemns homosexuality.</p>
<p>I agree with what Question Diversity wrote.</p>

		<p>Ethnic groups in which religion and ethnicity go hand in hand like the national churches of Orthodox Christianity, plus Judaism, Shintoism, Hinduism and Confucianism always help the ethnic group preserve its cohesion. Catholicism &amp; Protestantism are too individualistic &amp; multicultural.</p>

		<p>I note the downtown chapter has many former and current Latino gang members in it. Why then, would white teenagers want to be a part of that chapter?</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s something else I&rsquo;m always wondering   &mdash;   Young Life and almost all charismatic fundagelical Christian outfits like them believe in racial equality.  Yet, they&rsquo;ve never thought to ask themselves these obvious questions:</p>
<p>(1)  Why do white teenagers seem to behave relatively well without the need for charismatic fundagelical ministries?  If the races are truly equal, it would stand to reason white teens would need their help.</p>
<p>(2)  Why do blacks and Hispanics take up most of their time and efforts when it comes to avoiding crime?  If the races are truly equal, then it would stand to reason blacks and Hispanic teens wouldn&rsquo;t need as much help as they do.</p>
<p>(3)  Why haven&rsquo;t their decades of working with blacks and Hispanics worked to the point that they&rsquo;re not needed anymore?  If the races are truly equal, and it was all a matter of a bad environment, then it should stand to reason, that the &#8220;good environment&#8221; provided by these ministries would kick in and start working.</p>

<p>NOT ONLY teens. Anyone for that matter feels &#8220;more comfortable&#8221; among their own kind, no matter what the circumstances.</p>
<p>Is there a problem with that??</p>

<p>What causes race problems is the mixing of races. There wouldn&rsquo;t be race problems if people separated by race.</p>

		<p>Orange County apart of the bible belt-Wrong! Church attendance is according to both Pew and Gallup about 6 to 10 percent below the national average. Its Rick Warren&rsquo;s megachurch which is a bit on the liberal side since he gave a prayer for Obama distorts the reality of the place. Also, besides being about 34 percent hispanic and good old San Clemente is only 15 percent but notice that the school is already 19 percent and probably by less than ten years will be 30 percent, since among kids  according to the County of Orange is about 51 percent hispanic and 16.5 percent asian and ony 28.8 percent white among those 5 years and younger. San Clemente will be less wealthy by 2025 and the well to do area will get smaller and the barrio will grow. San Clementine wasn&rsquo;t as smart as the asian city Irvine which replaced whites with asians who are smarter than hispanics.</p>

		<p>It is hard to have ONE group for everybody AND have the program be bilingual.  Many, probably most people don&rsquo;t like to be in a social situation in which groups of people are speaking another language, but then switch over to your language or become silent when you approach them.  The whole situation is just unnatural.</p>
<p>How on earth do you hold a bilingual Bible study?  It is just so much more productive to have people read it and discuss it in their own language.  The Bible is already a translated work, and a lot of what is discussed at a Bible study is what the original Greek or Hebrew meant, etc.  </p>

<p>So much of liberalism has seeped into the Christian religion under the guise of compassion and brotherhood.  The civil rights movement has taken on many dimensions of a religious movement.  Even those ubiquitous marches and candle light vigils have become a form of psuedo-religious worship.</p>
<p>Christianity does teach brotherhood but it does not have a utopian vision of humanity.  Jesus never spoke of a world without nations or borders.  The Bible does talk about people of all nations and races worshipping God but that is under the kingship of Christ after the second coming of Christ. Christianity does not teach that sinful humans are going to bring about a peaceful perfect world.  It believes that only God can create such a world.</p>
