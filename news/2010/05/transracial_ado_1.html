<h1>Transracial Adoptions: A &#8216;Feel Good&rsquo; Act or No &#8216;Big Deal&rsquo;?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jessica Ravitz, CNN, March 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8220;White people adopt black kids to make themselves feel good .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A black child needs black parents to raise it.&#8221; &#8220;Maybe she adopted one because the blacks in the community wouldn&rsquo;t step forward and adopt?&#8221; &#8220;What&rsquo;s the big deal? If no white person ever adopted a black child, they&rsquo;d be saying why don&rsquo;t white people adopt black children.&#8221; &#8220;Who cares what race they are? A woman got a child, a child got a mother .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it&rsquo;s BEAUTIFUL!!! And yes I am black .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if it matters.&#8221;</p>
<p>These impassioned comments and thousands more poured in earlier this week when CNN published a story on the stirred-up debate surrounding Sandra Bullock&rsquo;s recent adoption. {snip}</p>
<p>So when it comes to transracial adoptions in this country, where are we?</p>
<p>Stacey Bush is the white child of a black mother whose adoption sparked controversy and whose attitude forces people to think about the issue differently.</p>
<p>Stacey wouldn&rsquo;t change a thing about her life, which is saying a lot for a young woman who spent her early childhood being neglected and bounced through the foster-care system. That was before a drawn-out legal case ended in 1998, allowing a single black woman, Regina Bush  &mdash;  the only mother Stacey had ever loved  &mdash;  to become her forever mom.</p>
<p>The Michigan lawsuit was filed when a county agency cited concerns about &#8220;cultural issues&#8221; in an attempt to keep the pair apart. Regina Bush&rsquo;s adoption of Stacey&rsquo;s biracial half-sister had already been completed, without challenge, and Bush says she wanted to keep the girls together. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;People are sometimes startled. &#8216;She&rsquo;s white, but she doesn&rsquo;t seem white,&rsquo;&#8221; she says with a laugh. &#8220;I can relate to everyone. I like being exposed to everything.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Seeing me, hearing me  &mdash;  it doesn&rsquo;t matter what color you&rsquo;re raised just as long as someone loves you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Forty percent of children adopted domestically and internationally by Americans are a different race or culture from their adoptive parents, according to a 2007 National Survey of Adoptive Parents, the most recent study of its kind conducted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Legislation passed by Congress in 1994 and 1996 prohibits agencies getting federal help from discriminating against would-be parents based on race or national origin.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;In the old days, meaning the &rsquo;70s and &rsquo;80s, there was this notion that these parents need to be colorblind. This sounds wonderful, but by being colorblind you&rsquo;re denying they&rsquo;re of a different race and culture,&#8221; Johnson says. &#8220;Families that are successful are those that acknowledge race.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It&rsquo;s not a curse. It&rsquo;s not an impossible feat. They just need to work harder to give a child a sense of self-identity.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Seventy-three percent of official adoptions  &mdash;  including those arranged through foster care, private domestic arrangements and internationally  &mdash;  are done by whites, according to the 2007 survey of adoptive parents. But that doesn&rsquo;t account for informal arrangements, when relatives take in other family members&rsquo; children, which is much more common in the black community, says Toni Oliver, vice-president elect of the National Association of Black Social Workers. She says the black community takes in &#8220;more children than the whole foster care system does,&#8221; although Johnson [Chuck Johnson, acting chief executive of the National Council for Adoption] adds that often these arrangements don&rsquo;t have the safeguards and protections legal adoptions provide.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;But love is not enough,&#8221; said Simon [Rita Simon, author of &#8220;Adoption, Race &amp; Identity: From Infancy to Young Adulthood&#8221;], a professor of justice and public policy at American University in Washington. &#8220;You really have to make some changes in your life if you adopt a child of another race.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the case of a white parent adopting a black child, that might mean living in an integrated neighborhood, having pictures in the home of black heroes, seeking out other families in similar situations, attending a black church and finding role models or godparents who are black. The same need to integrate a child&rsquo;s culture applies across the board, whether parents are adopting from Asia, Central America or elsewhere.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bill Barry and his wife, Joan Jacobson, adopted two boys as newborns. Willie, 17, is biracial and Alex, 15, is black. Race never mattered to the white couple when they set out to adopt, after it became clear they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to bear children on their own.</p>
<p>&#8220;We simply wanted a healthy newborn,&#8221; Barry says. &#8220;We didn&rsquo;t care about race, didn&rsquo;t care about sex, and we knew we wanted them locally.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That may be true, but the National Association of Black Social Workers has long argued for keeping black children in black homes. About 40 years ago, the association released a four-page position paper on transracial adoption in which it went so far as to call such adoptions &#8220;genocide&#8221;  &mdash;  and that word choice has dogged the organization ever since.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The preference, Oliver [Toni Oliver, National Association of Black Social Workers] says, remains that kids be placed in same-race households whenever possible. And if it isn&rsquo;t possible, or if a birth parent selects an adoptive family of a different race, then those adopting must be educated to understand &#8220;the impact of race and racism on the country, their family and the child in particular,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a negative impact that children and families are going to experience based on race,&#8221; she says. &#8220;The idea that race doesn&rsquo;t matter is not true. We would like it to be true, but it&rsquo;s not.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Regina [Bush, the adoptive mother of Stacey Bush] says she got attacks from both sides.</p>
<p>&#8220;White babies were a precious commodity. &#8216;Blacks can&rsquo;t take care of white children,&rsquo;&#8221; she remembers hearing. &#8220;And blacks were outraged&#8221; because there are so many black children in the system who need homes, and &#8220;they didn&rsquo;t understand why a black woman wouldn&rsquo;t adopt one of her own.&#8221;</p>

		<p>40% of adoptions are inter-racial? Really, so low? I would have thought it might be higher. The reasons are simple. The abortion rate amongst eligible white mothers is near 100%. The few white healthy babies who do make it to term and are put up for adoption are few and far between. </p>
<p>The converse of this is blacks and hispanics, displaying little forethought to there own well-being, let alone the consequences of getting pregnant, tending to bring illegitimate children to term - and subsequently cannot take care of them, or just don&rsquo;t want to. Thus the absolute glut of dusky children over-flowing every social-service agency in the U.S. and Canada.</p>
<p>This, coupled with the inane white liberal mindset that allows them to imagine that raising a black baby will elevate them to liberal sainthood, well, nobody should be surprised.</p>
<p>Still, I&rsquo;ll bet that Sandra Bullock wouldn&rsquo;t be so uppity about her new black baby if she was getting by on twenty-five grand working at a diner. No it&rsquo;s mostly well-to-do white women who are competing with their Oprah watching liberal peers.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s so pathetic that many Whites fall for this nonsense.  This is all part of the genocide for Whites, make them believe that they&rsquo;re &#8220;doing right&#8221; by adopting a non-White baby.  Make them think it&rsquo;s their duty by inflicting a guilt complex on them.  Make them think it&rsquo;s cool to adopt a non-White baby and that &#8220;Everyone is doing it&#8221;.  That&rsquo;s how the media gets White couples and especially White women to adopt non-White children and neglect their own race.  This is unreal, it really is.  By not having children not only are White participating in their own genocide but they&rsquo;ve been conditioned to feel so guilty that many now feel it&rsquo;s their &#8220;duty&#8221; to bring up other races, both in the child-rearing sense and the worldly sense, as in &#8220;elevating&#8221; other races to the previous position held by Whites.  It&rsquo;s a masterful job they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Wake up White people.</p>

		<p>I think any and every person faced with the choice of adoption and having their own children, should always choose the latter. I doubt that our ancestors went off to war and struggled through hardships so that we could forgo continuing the family line. Adoption is fine if you have the extra money and have already had our own children, but the money going towards an adopted child will always rob your actual children of resources that would make their lives better. The continuation of your family line should be the number one priority for any person, especially Whites, which are dramatically declining in numbers.</p>

		<p>Does anyone remember the spate of television shows in the 70&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s showing White families adopting Black kids? Diffrent Strokes and Webster were just two of them and they all came out around the same time. It is just like now with all of the television shows and commercials showing interracial couples- particularly Black men with White women- a programming mechanism to make Whites more favorable to interracial adoption or marriages. While I feel bad for kids stuck in foster homes I do not feel that the answer is to put Black kids with White families unless the families understand what they are getting into with raising a Black child. I have heard news stories about outreaches to the Black community to try to get more foster families for Black children but with little success. To me it is worse for the kids to get put with White families who do not understand or are prepared for Black behavior and when the kids begin to misbehave or perform poorly in school they are often bounced from foster home to foster home. Of course it would be &#8220;racist&#8221; to educate a White family on Black behavior.</p>

		<p>Any adoption is risky unless you know something about the child&rsquo;s genealogy. Did either parent have mental illness? Are any biological relatives in prison? Are their any hereditary diseases which will make the  kid expensive to raise? </p>
<p>To better assure the most &#8220;natural&#8221; family outcome I think kids should be matched to parents with a DNA test. Trans-racial adoption should be panned as unnatural.</p>

		<p>Whites adopting only whites would be surely branded as &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; I suppose.</p>
<p>Here is a link a commentary on this kind of idiocy:</p>

<p>Quote:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I have to remind you that if you object such a replacement [of white American by Mexican mestizos], which is a form of forced national cuckoldry, you are automatically labeled a &ldquo;racist&rdquo;? But then, would you rather be a cuckold who just loves to raise children not of his choice that don&rsquo;t carry his genes and are statistically less likely than his own progeny to take good care of him when he is old, poor, and sick?&#8221;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m wondering how long they searched to find a black who adopted a white child.  The media loves placing very unusual scenarios before it and pretending it is the norm.</p>

		<p>&#8220;40 per cent are bi-racial adoptions&#8221;!?  I DOUBT that. I&rsquo;d like to see the statistics.  I&rsquo;d be willing to bet you would see some &#8216;Hispanic&rsquo; adoptions in that data.  As we all know, &#8216;Hispanic&rsquo; is a loaded term when you&rsquo;re speaking of Race, because PURE WHITE SPANIARDS are included in that designation. How many of these children were adopted by those kinds of &#8216;Hispanics&rsquo;?  And, as is the case anytime the establishment wants to push one of its pet agendas, the data is ALWAYS skewed in its favor. </p>

		<p>Not even a real question, of course it&rsquo;s a feel good thing 98% of the time. I believe most should have bought a pet, but it&rsquo;s certainly better than live cross breeding. I&rsquo;ve always liked Sandra Bullock but I think she needed a fix, after finding out what a loser she&rsquo;d been married to, and chose not to do drugs. She should have read the writing on the package in the beginning [pun intended.] However as has been said there is no accounting for taste.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s foisted off on us everywhere.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Sims 2 player.  One family in the Veronaville neighborhood consists of a white woman living with a black man and their two adopted children.  I don&rsquo;t play that family.  Any Sims 2 players out there  &mdash;  I&rsquo;m referring to the Summerdreams.</p>
<p>One family you can play consists of two teens, two children, and two toddlers, who range from white to mulatto to black  &mdash;  the story is they were all adopted, then their adoptive parents died.  Now if they were all white or all black, I&rsquo;d create an elderly couple of the appropriate race and have them move in with that couple.  But since they&rsquo;re a &#8220;rainbow&#8221; so to speak&hellip;forget it.  They can stay in the family bin.</p>
<p>You go to adopt a child in that game, you can&rsquo;t even choose the race.  I save the game before I have my Sim couple call the adoption service.  I don&rsquo;t know how many times I&rsquo;ve done that scenario and the child winds up black if not mixed.  I&rsquo;m surprised if the child turns out to be white (I always play white families).</p>
<p>(Don&rsquo;t get me started on some of the townies in that game.  Black with blond hair and Oriental names?)</p>

		<p>&#8220;40% of adoptions are inter-racial&#8221;?. Why be so imprecise? Just say &#8220;40% of the children whites adopt are not white&#8221;, since only whites adopt the children of other races or usually adopt at all.</p>
<p>Legalize baby selling. Then, no healthy white baby would ever be aborted since they&rsquo;re worth about $50K. Whites wouldn&rsquo;t have to adopt nonwhites so satisfy their parental instincts. But then, nonwhite babies would stay on the shelf. So be &#8220;fair&#8221;, we kill them all.</p>

		<p>American blacks are the wealthiest group of blacks anywhere in the world. American blacks are actors, doctors, scientists, teachers, professors, professional athletes, government employees galore, and many are world famous multimillionaires and billionaires. Blacks have all these talk shows where they dispense wisdom to their faithful white followers. American blacks are are the most educated and richest of blacks anywhere in the world. Why isn&rsquo;t this group of blacks taking care of their own when it comes to adoptions or any other thing for that matter? Blacks who have a white parent rarely acknowledge their white parent and blacks can be hurt badly by other blacks for acting white. Obama checked black or African American on his census form. I notice when I see a white woman with a black man there is usually no kids seen and when I see a white woman with a black baby there is not a black male anywhere around. Seventy percent of all blacks born in this country are born to a single black woman. Blacks need to man up, but I don&rsquo;t count on that anytime soon with the amount of white enablers that abound.  </p>

		<p>Some U.S. states ban transracial adoption, and much of this prohibition, in modern times, comes from objections by black social workers.  Of course, many whites are wary to begin with and opt for Asian infants.<br>
It&rsquo;s certainly true that black-by-black adoption rates are low.  Many black families are already raising relatives&rsquo; children, and, while 70% of black births are now out-of-wedlock, black women abort 50% of their pregnancies.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a coterie of Hollywood big shots who constantly, openly disemminate their &#8220;racial&#8221; views at various social events, which is why we are hearing Tom Hanks being shown on T.V. saying racial slurs were used against the Japanese just because they were &#8220;different&#8221; during world war II.  Anybody that believes it is wrong to slur a people who committed a sneak attack on Americans, killing 2500 of them is some kind of fool that needs to be eliminated from US society somehow.  They deserve to be relocated to Africa or Haiti, etc.</p>
<p>And anybody who can&rsquo;t see the obvious reasons as to why such criticism abounds is just plain dumb.  Sorry, but there&rsquo;s no other way to describe them.</p>
<p>These Marxist types aren&rsquo;t effective against people who can think, especially if their employment doesn&rsquo;t hinge on whether or not they adhere to the party line.  Saturating the likes of weak-minded recipients, like Hanks, with all this inane criticism about whites being intolerant and &#8220;racist&#8221; towards others is why we have the Madonna types, the Jolie types and the Bullock types adopting blacks.  &#8220;See I&rsquo;m not racist, Mr. Producer; mMr. Director;  Mr. Writer; Mr. Studio Exec.&#8221;</p>
<p>That any white would feel guilty of such obvious attempts at promoting anti white hatred is so gullible as to be worthless in this society.</p>
<p>The despicable hate that comes from Hollywood is absolutely amazing.  But these people responsible for creating such a situation are going to face severe repercussions the first time this society comes apart.  Note also that none of the instigators have black kids.  None of them!</p>
<p>Oh, these gullible, naive white woment.</p>

<p>We young whites do indeed have a commitment to our fathers, both living and long dead, to validate their sacrifices and troubles by giving them the earthly immortality they deserve. To anyone reading, the message couldn&rsquo;t be clearer, pass on your genes!</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s an Asian woman, who was adopted by whites herself, and works for one of these pro-Asian groups who claims that white parents are racist towards their Asian children nearly traumatizing them. Whites are really loud and offensive, at least compared to Asians. </p>

		<p>You would think that the Obama example of a black male raised by whites who abandons the white side of the family and relates only to the black side that abandoned him in infancy would make white people LESS likely to choose interracial adoption.</p>
<p>The best line that I ever heard about whites adopting blacks was that the white adopters needed to realize that when they adopted a black, they became a black family, not an interracial family.  Their child would be seen as black, their grandchildren would be seen as black, etc.</p>
<p>When I was younger, I would have considered adopting a non-white, and some of my relatives have adopted Korean children and it has worked out well, but our society is breaking down, and interracial families are probably going to be in a difficult situation within the next 10 to 20 years.</p>

<p>If race is a &#8220;social construct,&#8221; as they say, why is it important for whites who adopt black children to live in integrated neighborhoods, send their kids to black schools, attend black churches, and have pictures of black heroes in the home in an effort to prevent &#8220;genocide&#8221;?</p>

		<p>The term race is too broad, it should be broken into Black, Hispanic, and Asian. My guess is that many of the Asian and a batch of the Hispanic adoptions go pretty well, it is only the Black ones that are so politicized they rarely work out. So forces are larger than parent/child love and one of them is racial politics, especially black/white relations.</p>

		<p>Here on the North Shore of Chicago i see lots of Asian kids  &mdash;  99% girls  &mdash;  adopted by white(often Jewish) families. (I think a fair amount of women who are losers in the game of love,who have no interest in,or who have given up on men,adopt these Asian girls. Theyre so cute and prob easier to raise than,say,a black male with a learning disorder. ) I rarely see BLACKS adopted by these hard-charging-striving-college-application white people. I DO see inetrracial kids when the working class girls from up north come to shop,and also the occasional white grandparents with the black child. The first group trains there kids to run the country. The second,to hand you the fries with your Big Mac. </p>

		<p>I may be mistaken, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure I remember this case.  The reason that the black woman was allowed to adopt the white girl was, basically, because no one else would.  If I remember correctly, this was a &#8220;troubled child,&#8221; probably forever damaged emotionally from being bounced around from one foster home to another.  Again, I may be conflating this case with another, but if it&rsquo;s the same one, this black woman already had a bunch of kids already  &mdash;  adopted black kids, mostly street urchins.  I also noticed there&rsquo;s no followup at all  &mdash;  what became of the girl when she grew up, her education, her job.  She was probably doomed from the outset anyhow.</p>

		<p>Regardless of the feel good stories and anecdotes, the primary reason 40% of adoptions are interracial is due to the dearth of white children available for adoption.  I&rsquo;ve known two couples who adopted and although they eventually were able to adopt white babies it was a struggle due to the high demand for white children especially with Northern European features.  </p>
<p>No doubt more and more whites couples are adopting non-whites out of feelings of guilt combined with a Christian zeal to uplift the &#8220;oppressed&#8221;.  At any rate the practice should be condemned and made illegal since it will inevitably lead to the introduction of third world DNA into the white gene pool.   </p>

		<p>It appears that the main reason that this black woman was allowed to adopt the white girl was that she had ALREADY adopted the white girl&rsquo;s biracial half-sibling.  At that point, &#8220;family reunification&#8221; issues kick in, as it is desirable for siblings and half-siblings to grow up together.  It was a VERY unusual case, as there are FAR more examples of such sibling groups (in which one child is white, and another non-white) being adopted by a white person or white couple.</p>

Another factor is that her sister was an &#8220;inter-racial&#8221; child. In other words, their mother was shacking up with black men. And white ones too. Very like she was a junkie or alcoholic, or at the very least not a person with much good sense. This experience of having various men, black and white, coming and going in the home could not have given the child a sense of security and stability. It must have been a harmful experience in her development&hellip; not even knowing which one you father was!</p>

		<p>Years ago, when our own kids were off on their own, my wife and I flirted with the idea of adopting or fostering another child or two. The local Catholic adoption agency welcomed us with open arms&hellip; couldn&rsquo;t wait to have us meet the children&hellip; all Black or mulatto. When we explained our White only policy, the atmosphere became absolutely glacial. Needless to say, we walked out quickly. Transracial adoptions are simply not our cup of tea.

I doubt other than a few couples trying to &#8220;prove something&#8221;, damned few White couples would really want a mixed-race child. The obvious inference people draw, when seeing a White couple with a mulatto child or two&hellip; being the husband was cuckolded or desperate enough to marry a woman no one else wanted&hellip; because of her mulatto kid(s).</p>

		<p>This is a sad subject but the bottom line is in most cases the inability to find a white kid. Of course there are some whites that want to make a liberal political statement. They think that theses kids will grow up as white kids who happen to have black skin. So wrong, but they wont see it for years to come. <br>
   The real culprit here is abotion, the pill, and brainwashed liberal white girls. White girls either take the pill and dont have babies or kill/abort thier babies, or have black babies while black girls just get a increase in welfare with every one they can pop out. Statistic we all are aware of show us the decline in the white race now and seriously far worse in 50-100 years. Most of us will not see it, but whatever is left of our white grandkids in that time are facing some tough times ahead. KF   </p>

<p>This is a fascinating comment, and it is worth asking why non-whites who have been adopted and raised by whites, end up turning against whites. Why did Obama, who was raised by whites, turn against whites? Also, why do so many white people, hate their fellow whites? </p>
<p>As a person who travels around the world on a regular basis, I believe in the racial diversity of the human species, and I believe that the disappearance of any single racial group would be a tragedy for humanity. Every race has its virtues and vices, and I do not believe that any race of people is better than other races. This is why I oppose interracial marriage and interracial adoptions. I want to keep the races pure, not because of the racial supremacist theories that are advanced by some whites, but because each race is unique and valuable. No dog breeder ever considers one breed of dog to be &#8220;racially superior&#8221; to other breeds of dogs.</p>
<p>Some people commenting on this article have noted that whites are hated by non-whites, as well as by many of their fellow whites. It is time that white nationalists had an honest and frank debate as to why whites are hated by non-whites, as well as by so many of their fellow whites. White nationalists like to focus exclusively on the virtues of whites, and completely overlook the vices on the part of whites that make them so hated, including being hated by so many of their fellow whites. But it is only by focusing on those vices, that we can get the many whites who hate their fellow whites, to hate their own people less.</p>
<p>I will start by talking about white virtues. There is no question that whites are better than other races, in their ability to build prosperous and technologically advanced societies. This is what attracts non-whites to white societies. The non-whites are interested in enjoying the material comforts that are available in white societies. But non-white immigration to white society is not driven by a love for whites. Non-whites love the material civilization that whites create, but they do not love whites. Why is this the case?</p>
<p>This brings us to the difficult issue of white vices, that many here find difficult to talk about. Non-whites (as well as many whites) view white people as selfish, cruel, mean, ruthless, greedy, heartless, self-righteous, arrogant and conceited. Therefore, whites are seen as a horrible people, who create great civilizations. These white vices may be a sort of evolutionary adaptation, that may be intended to protect white people from genetic annihilation. In Northern India, there are white upper-caste Hindus, who are racially indistinguishable from Europeans. Some have blue and green eyes. They have managed to retain their racial purity, even after having lived among non-whites for 5,000 years. If whites were a sweet, loving, and loveable people, who loved all humans equally, then their civilization-making abilities would put them at risk of being overwhelmed by the non-whites who are attracted to their advanced civilizations. </p>
<p>In any case, the exotic tribes in the third world that are sweet, nature-loving, and friendly, lack the ruthless character that is needed to establish fiercely competitive capitalist societies. It is quite likely that it is the white vices, that make it possible for whites to create the great civilizations that they create. Talking openly about white vices may actually reduce anti-white racism on the part of non-whites, as well as by many whites. We cannot hate pit bulls for being pit bulls, it is just part of their nature.  </p>

Do you really think that Whites built the modern world solely because we&rsquo;re crueler than other races?  This sounds to me like a clueless primitive&rsquo;s way of explaining to himself why the White man has more.  The primitive cannot understand how civilized White societies operate, so he has to fit it into a story that he can make sense of.  &#8220;If you have more than me, you must have stolen it.&#8221;  It reminds me of a White guy from New York who, on hearing that I had a government job, asked me how big a bribe I had paid to get it.  That&rsquo;s the only way he could imagine anybody having a better job than his.  A dumb, White, primitive.  </p>

		<p>#45 - Mr. Patel, you pose many interesting concepts!  Thank you!  May I throw in my 2 cents?  I think the first big problem with the white race is that many whites are not loving enough to our own people, and this begins within our families.  Also whites are competitive amongst themselves and reject each other if they do not fit the mold of high status whites.  </p>
<p>What makes a white high status?  Achievement, intelligence, advanced college degrees, social skills, wealth, good looks, and so on.  Missing any of these fabulous qualities, whites are not too impressed with each other.  WHEREAS, non-whites do not require extraordinary qualities to love or like each other.  They set the bar lower and are more accepting of non-achievement.</p>
<p>The lack of love from their own kind that whites endure cause them to turn against their own race subconsciously.  Disliking their own, they then embrace the other races in the hope they will give them the respect and love they long for.</p>
<p>Many non-whites, who are more emotionally demonstrative, see whites as cold and aloof.  You are right about that.  However, the real reason I think they dislike whites is non-whites are jealous of whites&rsquo; intelligence, achievements, beauty and wealth.  </p>
<p>If there were a race of people on this planet who as a group were more beautiful than whites, more intelligent, more prosperous, inventors of wonderful things, creators of uniquely sophisticated societies, how would we whites feel?  Maybe a little jealous?  That is what non-whites are feeling.</p>

<p>Contrast that attitude with Jews.  My uncle by marriage was born and raised Jewish. Two factors that led to him marrying out was a bitter divorce in his family, both sides remarried and had other children, leaving him the odd man out AND he joined the military, made contact with exotic food, ate it and loved it.  I think great seafood more than my aunt stole my uncle away from Jewish Orthodoxy, LOL.</p>
<p>In any case, as a pre-teen the Holocaust came up and reasons for Antisemitism given by people who had been Nazis were that the Jews didn&rsquo;t suffer as badly during the Great Depression as the Europeans, etc.  So I simply went to the man and asked him from his perspective as someone who was raised Jewish why the Jews had prospered at a time when the Europeans failed to thrive.  </p>
<p>He told me that the Jewish community across every land was very tight-knit and supportive and actively mentored each other.  When a new Jew was trying to get established in an area, the entire local Jewish community would try to help him get established in his own business three times.  They had charities that would give him loans without interest.  They relied heavily on contacts.  If they want to get their kid into a good school, they network and tap an alumnus who pulls some strings for him. </p>
<p>It struck me then as it does now that this is nothing that White people could not have done over the centuries if they had any unified or somewhat cohesive vision of themselves as a race.  I also believe that Whites pay lip service to the idea that they are a minority in this world, but don&rsquo;t believe it (and so don&rsquo;t circle the wagons around each other) because so much of their culture dominates the world.  They confuse cultural consumption on the part of non-Whites with cultural assimilation, which is not the same thing at all. When they become racially realistic enough to see the truth, they pull an Adolf and blame the Jew rather than looking in the mirror at the picture of laziness and complacency.  </p>
<p>Conversely, Whites have abysmally low standards for non-Whites, indulge them like spoiled children, and bend over backwards to lift them up. </p>
<p>I think this represents both a nasty competition with other Whites by our White so-called elite, but a soft bigotry on their part where non-Whites are concerned.  They get to play Lord and Lady Bountiful to people of color expecting to be exalted for it even if, in their heart of hearts, they believe that helping these people is ineffective.  And I think that&rsquo;s by design.  There are some brilliant people of color out there.  But affirmative action is NOT based on finding the Walter Williams, the Thomas Sowells, and the Condoleeza Rices and mentoring them.  All of these people got to where they were by merit not mentoring.  Its based less on finding exceptional people of color and more on quotas.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what color they are, most people are no fools and have a pretty good idea what their own capabilities are.  Even though AA gave Michelle Obama a life that more deserving Whites would envy on a silver platter, she is still bitter about her Harvard experience even though she is loath to concede that she was not qualified and should have never been admitted there in the first place.</p>
<p>In any case, successful White Nationalism has to be a case of Whites being more cooperative and less competitive with each other.  God knows we have enough non-White competition out there without our own piling on each and every one of us.  Until we can do that, our problems will not only continue, but get worse.  A house divided cannot stand.  </p>

		<p>#19 One of the best ways to take back our country is to avoid the entertainment industry like the plague.  It seems that practically every time we watch some entertainment we get exposed to some Hollywood indoctrination.  Don&rsquo;t let Hollywood rent space in your head avoid them whenever you can and teach your kids to develop interests other than television, garbage music and movies.  Teach them that big media doesn&rsquo;t mean better media. Buy them good books as soon as they can read.  Look for books that teach them morality, patriotism and pride in their culture and history.  </p>

		<p>Clytemnestra makes some good points. Basically, whites do not stick together. We have no sense of common identity whatsoever.</p>
<p>Anyone who has ever worked in a large place, one with a large number of both blacks and whites, knows that there are certain issues on which blacks would all stand together resolutely as a group. Whites, on the other hand, have no sense of racial loyalty; and anyone who even suggests it would be shunned like he was radioactive.  Whites don&rsquo;t hesitate to stab another white in the back, and wouldn&rsquo;t want to be associated with any  hint or notion of white unity.  As always, whites are fearful most of the stigma of the word &#8220;racism&#8221;, but also of white brotherhood. With whites, it&rsquo;s each dog out for himself and don&rsquo;t trust anyone else.</p>

		<p>54 Anon: We Whites who grew up in White neighborhoods with White schools did not learn to reflexively side with other Whites because ALL our enemies and friends were White.  We sorted ourselves out as greasers or brainiacs or hippies or jocks or some other kind of socio-economic categories.  Many of us are having to learn about racial loyalty at relatively advanced ages.  </p>

<p>Yes, that is very true.  Whites never had to learn self-identification. It&rsquo;s alien to them. </p>
<p>But, going beyond that excellent observation,  the point I was making is that in a large organization, feeling the hot breath of racial Orthodoxy breathing down their necks, and when their jobs and careers are at stake,  most whites are too intimidated to dare to support other or stick together in any way. If anything, they want to demonstrate how &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; they are. </p>
<p>There is a racial Inquisition going on, probably going to get worse. If everyone stood against it, the Inquisition would be powerless; but most people are sheep who seek the easy way.  <br>
 And white solidarity is seen as the worst, most dangerous, sort of heresy in 2010.  <br>
