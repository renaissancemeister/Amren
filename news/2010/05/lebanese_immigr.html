			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), May 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 24-year-old Lebanese immigrant has been crowned Miss U.S.A.</p>
<p>Rima Fakih, from Dearborn, Michigan, is believed to be the first Muslim to win the pageant despite nearly stumbling over in her evening gown last night.</p>
<p>Born in Lebanon, she emigrated with her parents to the U.S. as a baby. She was raised in New York and attended a Catholic school.</p>
<p>Miss Fakih told pageant judges that her family celebrates both the Christian and the Muslim faiths.</p>
<p>They moved to Michigan in 2003, where she was later crowned Miss Michigan.</p>
<p>Pageant officials said competition records were not detailed enough to confirm if she is the first Arab-American or Muslim woman to win the contest.</p>
<p>The Miss U.S.A. pageant, co-owned by Donald Trump and NBC, was held at the Planet Hollywood Resort &amp; Casino last night.</p>
<p>Miss Fakih competed against 50 others in the swimsuit, evening gown and interview competitions.</p>
<p>She nearly fell while finishing her walk in a long, strapless gown because of the length of its train  &mdash;  but managed to recover.</p>
<p>In the interview, Miss Fakih was asked whether she thought birth control should be paid for by health insurance.</p>
<p>She said believed it should as it is expensive. &#8216;I believe that birth control is just like every other medication even though it&rsquo;s a controlled substance,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>Last night supporters at La Pita in Dearborn were ecstatic.</p>
<p>&#8216;This is the real face of Arab Americans, not the stereotypes you hear about,&rsquo; Zouheir Alawieh, 51, of Dearborn, told the Detroit Free Press.</p>
<p>&#8216;We have culture. We have beauty. We have history, and today we made history .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She believed in her dreams.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Supporters wore T-shirts emblazoned with Miss Fakih&rsquo;s picture. On the back was a quote from her: &#8216;It&rsquo;s beauty that captures your attention, personality which captures your heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Miss Oklahoma Morgan Elizabeth Woolard was first runner-up after handling a question about Arizona&rsquo;s strict new immigration law.</p>
<p>She said she supports it.</p>

		<p>Interesting to note that while this woman is supposedly a &#8220;muslim&#8221; there are photos being circulated around where she participates in a stripping contest.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what is worse&hellip;.islam being pushed down our throats or truth coming out about western corruption of islam.</p>
<p>Of course, the real issue here is that better looking women did not win&hellip;because they are white (and sexualized).</p>

<p>Maybe when they get their first taste of Islamofascism and Sharia Law, they will wake up to the Reality that Jesus&rsquo; &#8220;Sermon on the Mount&#8221; put more obligation upon him in earl A.D. than it does on us during our Existential Emergency.</p>

		<p>The article says, &#8220;Miss Fakih told pageant judges that her family celebrates both the Christian and the Muslim faiths.&#8221;</p>
<p>Great!  Well, since the Koran says that &#8220;God had no Son&#8221; making every orthodox christian a enemy of Islam, and since Pope Urban II called all muslims an &#8220;accursed race&#8221; making every muslim an heritic, I think miss Fakih (pronounced fakir?) should do the right thing and drink a hemlock on the next globally sensitive, community oriented, diversity conscious traditional gathering of her choice and be a REAL change agent of the &#8220;Novus ordo seclorum.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus, we know that this was a rigged game. </p>
<p>She should have lost points for not using her rainbow flying carpet, to avoid such an ungraceful physical gaffe!</p>
<p>Seriously, this country has become a joke and the state of Michigan is its punch line. The place is going bankrupt, it continues to be blue in spite of this, the auto industry is in a shambles, and it is home to about 250,000 or more Arabs. If their greatest claim to fame, besides having its largest city look like a cross between a zoo and a war zone, is contributing to the crowning of the first Muslim as &ldquo;Miss USA,&rdquo; Hamtramck, we have a problem!</p>

		<p>Stating that her family celebrates both the Christian and the Muslim faiths tells us nothing. It&rsquo;s what SHE celebrates that counts.<br>
I doubt that if she were a Muslim that there wouldn&rsquo;t be an uproar over her appearing in a beauty pageant and wearing revealing clothing including the bikini.  The pictures in the original article also show her pole dancing and having dollar bills shoved between her lovely breasts.</p>
<p>I have several Lebanese friends and none of them is a Muslim but rather Maronite Christians. The father of one of them was a priest. According to them their being called Arabs is mostly due to the fact that they are Arabic speaking.  They claim that historically their ethnicity is closer to the Phoenicians.</p>

		<p>To be fair, this woman is actually staggeringly attractive. I just fear the politically-correct use to which her newfound celebrity could potentially be put. (Not by Miss Fakih herself, but by various grievance-mongers who would jump at the chance to have a glamorous young woman as the public face of their cause.)</p>

<p>It really shouldn&rsquo;t be that hard to tell. In fact, I&rsquo;m just about 100% sure she&rsquo;s the only Muslim Arab to win the Miss USA pageant. After all, how many Muslim Arab women are there in the US? And how many are well-assimilated enought o win a Miss USA pageant? Not many. So I&rsquo;m pretty confident that she IS the first, even if they don&rsquo;t have the &#8220;records&#8221; to prove, whatever that means.</p>

		<p>Most of the time I detest Ann Coulter, but there are moments when I love her.  One of those moments was when, just after 9/11, she observed that &#8220;Not all Muslims are terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Fakih may be the &#8216;real face&rsquo; of ARAB Americans (The fraternities at Ole Miss, and the Episcopalian congregations I&rsquo;ve observed, seem to be full of them, these days.), but she is hardly the &#8216;real face&rsquo; of MUSLIM Americans.  </p>
<p>However, I would add that young women who parade before audiences, wearing bikinis and high heels, hardly represent the &#8216;real face&rsquo; of American Christians, either. </p>
<p>The fact is that we already had our hands full, dealing with the &#8220;World&rsquo;s Great Religions&#8221; we already had in this country.  We did not need another one. </p>

		<p>This woman is certainly a beautiful woman and deserved to win. Lebanon is one of the most forward thinking and liberal of the muslim countries and the people have always been friendly to Americans. Sadly, it is also one of the most war torn countries too. BUT! anything said by any muslim coming from Dearborn, Michiganistan by anyone with an arab name may not be from an Arab man as so many stupid black converts quickly adopt arab names (no idea why) and it is usually done in prison where most  blacks convert! </p>

		<p> Look for some radical Islamic fringe group to issue a &#8220;fatwah&#8221; against Rima Fakih soon, demanding that pious Muslims kill her because she revealed her body (and what&rsquo;s worse, her HAIR!) to millions of infidel males   &mdash;   and on national TV, yet. Obviously I hope it&rsquo;s never carried out if they DO issue one   &mdash;   but we&rsquo;ve all learned in the past few years that, yes, they are that crazy!</p>

<p>This woman is beautiful, while the runner -up was OK in appearance. (That was a pun.)</p>

		<p>If she came from Lebanon that could explain a lot. Lebanon is an extremely atypical Arab country. It has always had a very high number of Christians and was much more exposed to European and western influences and cultures. Beirut was once known for its casinos, beaches and nightlife before the mid-1970&rsquo;s, much like Havana before Castro. The great majority of America&rsquo;s original Arab community came almost entirely from Lebanon, almost all of them Maronite Christians (Ralph Nader, Jamie Farr, etc). They are worlds apart from Arabs from places like say, Saudi Arabia.</p>

		<p>Her Middle Eastern appearance makes her less attractive than a white woman, though I guess she was above average for Arabs. </p>
<p>Since the judges likes to ask politically sensitive questions, like the one they asked Miss Oklahoma (about Arizona&rsquo;s immigration law) and previously Miss California (about homosexual marriage), they should have by the way asked Miss Michigan what she thought of Hezbollah, the jihadist Lebanese organization that has not only killed Israelis and Lebanese Christians, but also Americans.</p>
<p>That would have been really interesting to hear.</p>

		<p>John,</p>
<p><br>
What do Arabs living in Michigan have anything to do with what&rsquo;s being discussed? Michigan has an estimated(2009) population of 9,969,727. By your numbers that means less than 5% is of Arabian Ancestry.  </p>
<p><br>
I&rsquo;m against immigration; every society that has opened it&rsquo;s borders freely suffered collapse. But blaming less than 5% of a population for the whole state&rsquo;s well-being, or lack thereof: Non sequitur. </p>

Obviously the contest is now political and means little . A beautiful young lady indeed . But she does not meet my biased standard of Anglo/European beauty .

<p>I don&rsquo;t know how much of it is true, but if it&rsquo;s taken at face value, she&rsquo;s either a muslim tool or will soon be beheaded by her terrorist relatives.  If it is, indeed, true.</p>

<p>Quite possible as Muslim men can marry Christian or Jewish women (Mohammed had a Christian wife). The wives are not asked to convert, only caveat is the children are raised Muslim. It is quite possible her fathers side was Muslim and her mothers side was Christian so she was exposed to both.</p>

		<p>Has anybody else noticed that in two pageants recently the runner up LOST due to answering a loaded question honestly but in the politically incorrect way?  And the winner WON due to answering an easier question in the PC way?  Not that I care much.  I stopped watching bogus, rigged, flashy pageants such as these once I graduated past hormonal puberty.</p>

I couldn&rsquo;t agree more about the inanity of combining two diametrically opposed religious beliefs. It&rsquo;s practically an insult to any one with a brain to see past the banal issues most of these people consider of any worth. </p>

		<p>  I can&rsquo;t agree with those idiots who absurdly claim that the gorgeous Rima Fahih is a &#8220;Hezbollah&#8221; babe just because she has the same last name as some Hezbollah officials. I doubt that organization is much interested in beauty contests. Some of the best looking Arab women are Lebanese or Syrian.</p>

<p>Possibly&hellip; Catholics are the same way as Muslims in this regard, except limited to baptized (Protestant or Eastern Orthodox) people of either sex; Mel Gibson is one famous example. Since Muslims (and Jews) aren&rsquo;t baptized, it is theoretically a serious sin to marry one, although since Catholic morality has broken down in the last half century, it is likely not seen as such any more. (Likewise, secularized Muslim women   &mdash;   such as the model Iman   &mdash;   seem to have little problem with marrying non-Muslims.)</p>

		<p>Heh, what about those pictures of her pole dancing? Sounds like an honor killing in the making. She&rsquo;s not white. That&rsquo;s why they chose her. Because she&rsquo;s a &#8216;Muslim.&rsquo; A pole dancing Muslim. Anything&rsquo;s better than white and Christian. It&rsquo;s just like that half-Persian woman that won Miss Norway a while back and was found out to have done porn a few years earlier.</p>

<p>I did  not blame the Arab population for destroying the state of  Michigan single handedly. If one group is to be targeted for that, it is the blacks; however, Arabs are no prize and in the Detroit area, cause a lot of problems and disharmony. My remarks were a general criticism of my home state and its multicultural politics, with an added reflection on my eye rolling disgust that we would be the state that provided the Miss USA contest with its first Muslim winner.</p>

		<p>To Wayne Engle (re post # 21):</p>
<p>I posted on the site accompanying the article that the winner would probably be stoned to death, if this pageant were held in Iran or Saudi Arabia. In a way, your post is not far-fetched.</p>
<p>I remember one time, -I think at the 2000 Summer Olympics - a female track runner from Morrocco was almost stoned by male Muslims because they were outraged that she wore shorts and a top that exposed her arms. It didn&rsquo;t happen at the Olympics, but I think it happened in Morrocco, after she returned.</p>
<p>I wonder if any of the mullahs in Iran or the Saudi &#8220;religious police&#8221; have seen this tape of the pageant winner?  If they did, they&rsquo;d foam at the mouth and then their heads would explode.</p>

		<p>Well, I must say, I am shocked by a lot of the comments on here, but I guess I am not surprised.</p>
<p>It is irrelevant that she is pretty.  It is also irrelevant that she could be &#8220;white&#8221; (some of you are stretching the envelope for what &#8220;white&#8221; is).  It is irrelevant that she could be Christian instead of Muslim.  The fact of the matter is that she most certainly doesn&rsquo;t represent America.  </p>
<p>There were many blondes in that pageant that were more beautiful than she (not just blondes, but other EUROPEAN American women). When we pick a contestant to represent the United States in the Miss Universe pageant, we should be picking a woman who is NOT only stunningly beautiful, but also representative of our country. </p>
<p>I guess we are at the point where discussing how waspy looking women are representative of America is somehow racist.  I am very irritated that even on this website in the midst of this discussion, a lot of posters here are oddly accepting of her nomination.</p>
<p>I guess it doesn&rsquo;t matter.  I stopped watching these pageants a long time ago.  Maybe if men ran these pageants, instead of women and homosexuals, we would see women win based on their beauty and how well they represent America.  Women and homosexuals running these pageants means that the winner is usually ethnic, interesting, unique, or a victim of something.</p>
<p>As a woman from Alabama I have been very upset over the women who have been picked to represent Alabama in recent years.  Alabama is full of very beautiful women but yet we some how pick our most homely women to represent us in beauty pageants.  As I was saying&hellip;&hellip;.when women run beauty pageants,&hellip;this is what you get.</p>

		<p>John,</p>
<p><br>
I misinterpreted your earlier post, but I can see the points now, thanks. </p>
<p>In your view, why are the blacks responsible?</p>
<p><br>
I&rsquo;m not trying to be snarky or attack your argument: my inquiry is sincere. </p>
<p><br>
Here in L.A. things are absolutely crazy and I&rsquo;ve no doubt we&rsquo;re headed in the wrong direction. This city is running on facade, and pretending unimportant, destructive things are profound.  </p>
