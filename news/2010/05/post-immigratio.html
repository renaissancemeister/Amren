<h1>Post-Immigration March Scuffle Targets National Anarchists</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lauren Smiley, San Francisco Weekly, May 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Three members of the Bay Area National Anarchists  &mdash;  a group that believes in white separatism and which supports the controversial Arizona anti-immigrant law  &mdash;  were attacked with mace, punches, kicks, and shoves as they left the immigration reform rally Saturday, according to BANA founder Andrew Yeoman.</p>
<p>The thousands of demonstrators marching for immigration reform down Mission Street Saturday afternoon were mostly preaching to the choir here in the sanctuary city. {snip}</p>
<p>But once the marchers arrived at the Civic Center Plaza for the rally, they were greeted by a small phalanx of counter protesters standing on the sidewalk in front of City Hall, including the Golden Gate Minutemen and four members of the Bay Area National Anarchists (BANA).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But as Yeoman and three other BANA members were leaving the rally and walking near Market and Van Ness, a group of three guys started following and yelling at them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was targeted,&#8221; Yeoman told SF Weekly. &#8220;They know me from the videos [on YouTube] and being involved in the anarchist movement for years.&#8221; </p>
<p>Yeoman says the group following him grew to roughly ten, all white people except for one black man. Yeoman says he crossed the street in an attempt to get away from the group but they followed him and yelled things like &#8220;Why do you hate immigrants?&#8221; &#8220;Why are you conservative?&#8221;</p>
<p>He said he saw that two of the men had brass knuckles, yet it was a woman who started the attack by macing Yeoman in the face. He says his sunglasses kept it from getting in his eyes. He remembers that two men pushed to then got him to the ground and kicked him, causing welts on his head. He alleges that they hit BANA member Parker Wilson in the back, and pushed a female member.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After questioning, the anarchists were released by the police. KGO-TV reported that at least two people involved in the fight were arrested and will likely be charged with felony assault and robbery. While police were unable to confirm details on Saturday night, Yeoman claims the police arrested six in all.</p>

		<p>It is Obama who must take the responsibility for any violence or incitement to violence by these illegal immigrants and their open border supporters.</p>
<p>He egged them on with his heated rhetoric, as did most of the mainstream media, the very same people who condemned the grandmothers in the tea party movement for inciting violence.  </p>
<p>Their reluctance to condemn the violence and hate rhetoric in these demonstrations tells us they approve of it.  And they will continue to ignore it, and it will encourage the militants to greater heights of violence and illegality.</p>
<p>Look for white groups across the board to have an eruption in membership numbers, especially the militias.  Gun sales are going to again sky rocket.</p>

		<p>In most locales, merely carrying brass knuckles [knuckle dusters] is itself a crime. Arrest can be had beforehand if known bad guys are in the area and police are about and informed.</p>

		<p>What else would one expect in San Francisco?  I&rsquo;m surprised BANA got out alive!  Any conservative person who goes there to demonstrate had better be a black belt in Tai Kwan Do or karate, and have a couple of knives handy for backup.  I used to live in SF, and the people there are crazy far left liberals.  I wouldn&rsquo;t even go there to visit today.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t understand.  If Mr. Yeoman is an anarchist why is he complaining about the anarchy he encountered?</p>

<p>For the same reason the Poles hated the Germans.  Nobody likes having his country invaded. </p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Why are you conservative?&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Because leftists are violent, totalitarian thugs.</p>
<p>I <i>guarantee</i> that the SPLC will not have this incident described in their Intelligence Report.  Their policy is strictly, &#8220;No enemies on the left!&#8221;<br>

		<p>Welcome to my world. In Sweden (and most of Europe) everything from rallies to demonstrations to politicians informing school children considered &#8220;anti-immigration&#8221; is attacked by the so called &#8220;Black block&#8221; of anarchists and communists. Brass knuckle is normal among them, but so are knives and of course the classic, a Molotov cocktail. Just a few weeks ago a local politician was attacked after a visit to a school. He was invited by the principal to inform about his views on immigration. Not even an extreme view. He wanted less immigration but still accepted the ones we sent via UN. For that he was stabbed two times on his way home. Non lethal but it was not for the lack of trying from the anarchist. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m confused. Recent history shows anarchists inciting blacks to violence against whites, exclusively! Did something change? The black-bandana wearing thugs you see destroying property at rallies are all anarchists.</p>

		<p>People on American Renaissance should check out the BANA Bay Area National Anarchists. They have a great program and they have been willing to take to the street, do real action on behalf of our people.</p>
<p>Their program is to promote local, tribal ways of living, local economics, local environmentalism and the rights of local people to be with their own kind, including White European Americans. </p>
<p>These National Anarchists understand the truth that Big is big, big corporations, big government, big media, &#8220;international&#8221; anything is now hostile to the rights of local people, including our local White people to be in control of their lives.</p>
<p>White people - in particular White Americans have fallen in to the terrible trap of always being &#8220;Conservative&#8221;, right wing. Whites are not in power, we don&rsquo;t want to &#8220;Conserve&#8221; the existing &#8220;Powers that Be&#8221;, We must find new ways of living and thinking that are pro White and increasingly Leftist.</p>
<p>These National Anarchists have done some great work and the fact that they are now being persecuted shows that they are being effective.</p>
<p>I salute the courage and idealism of the National Anarchists.</p>

		<p>Tom in MI: Good point.</p>
<p>Jedderman: Is it a crime if no one prosecutes? Good luck finding a cop who will arrest an illegal alien protester. The elite train the police to threaten anyone exercising free speech rights - unless it is illegals, leftists, communists, gays&hellip;</p>
