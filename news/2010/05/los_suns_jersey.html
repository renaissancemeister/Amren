			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Nash, ESPN, May 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Phoenix Suns will wear &#8220;Los Suns&#8221; on their jerseys in Game 2 of the Western Conference semifinals on Wednesday night, owner Robert Sarver said, &#8220;to honor our Latino community and the diversity of our league, the state of Arizona, and our nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The decision to wear the jerseys on the Cinco de Mayo holiday stems from a law passed by the Arizona Legislature and signed by Gov. Jan Brewer that has drawn widespread criticism from Latino organizations and civil rights groups that say it could lead to racial profiling of Hispanics. President Barack Obama has called the law &#8220;misguided.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;However intended, the result of passing the law is that our basic principles of equal rights and protection under the law are being called into question,&#8221; he [Sarver] said, &#8220;and Arizona&rsquo;s already struggling economy will suffer even further setbacks at a time when the state can ill-afford them.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sarver came up with the &#8220;Los Suns&#8221; jersey idea but left it up to the players for the final decision, Suns guard Steve Nash said, and all of them were for it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&rsquo;s fantastic,&#8221; Nash said after Tuesday&rsquo;s practice. &#8220;I think the law is very misguided. I think it&rsquo;s, unfortunately, to the detriment of our society and our civil liberties. I think it&rsquo;s very important for us to stand up for things we believe in. As a team and as an organization, we have a lot of love and support for all of our fans. The league is very multicultural. We have players from all over the world, and our Latino community here is very strong and important to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nash was born in South Africa and moved with his parents to Victoria, British Columbia, when he was 11‚ÅÑ2 years old. He was one of four Canadians to light the torch in the opening ceremony of the Vancouver Olympics this year.</p>
<p>San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said his team was interested in taking part but couldn&rsquo;t get new &#8220;Los Spurs&#8221; road jerseys in time for the game.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a wonderful idea,&#8221; Popovich said. &#8220;because it kind of shows what we all should be about. {snip}&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The NBA Players Association released a statement criticizing Arizona&rsquo;s immigration law and praising the Suns for the gesture.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Kerr [Phoenix general manager Steve Kerr] said &#8220;this isn&rsquo;t a huge political stand as much as it is just a celebration of diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Suns coach Alvin Gentry didn&rsquo;t want to comment on Arizona&rsquo;s immigration bill and said he was focused on showing appreciation for the Latino community and Arizona&rsquo;s diversity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s going to be great to wear Los Suns,&#8221; Phoenix&rsquo;s Amare Stoudemire said, &#8220;to let the Latin community know that we&rsquo;re behind them 100 percent.&#8221;<br>

		<p>The irony of a person born in South Africa protesting this law in Arizona is so noted.  For in many ways, the parallels between South Africa and the American Southwest are striking.  In both instances, the indigenous population were largely absent from the territory in question.  White people move in, take the territory, which was largely unpopulated at the time, and make something of it.  When that happens, then people of the same race as the indigenous people all of a sudden want their &#8220;territory&#8221; back.  Of course, when that happens, the territory will slowly revert to what it was before whites came along.</p>
<p>Non-whites want what whites have made for themselves, but want it on their own terms.  </p>
<p>BTW, the arena the Suns play in is viva City of Phoenix taxpayers, and I&rsquo;m sure most of that comes from whites.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a known fact that it is White people who pay for tickets to sports events, and Whites  provide the most for scholarships, support, etc - and it is Whites who are under siege from the illegal invasion - Whites who passed the law protecting themselves from the invasion - and Whites who are being murdered&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;yet these privileged basket ball players want to slap Whites in the face while &#8220;honoring&#8221; the illegal invaders?  All Whites should thus cease attending their games entirely, cease providing scholarships, cease supporting this team, and boo them at every chance they get.  When the stands are empty, and support dries up, these race traitors will get the message.  Let them go play for some Mexican team in Mexico.</p>

		<p>I hope the 70 per cent of Arizonians who back the bill will show what they think by not attending the game, and that the NBA will face criticism as well.</p>
<p>The wide-ranging, spontaneous celebrity criticism of the bill needs to be met with a tough response. Arizona&rsquo;s anti-illegal law is now a cause being fought well beyond Arizona&rsquo;s borders, even internationally.</p>

		<p>Cinco de Mayo is a Mexican holiday, not a Hispanic holiday.  We are honoring the Hispanics in this country by celebrating a Mexican holiday?  Strange.</p>

		<p>There are many different ethnic communities in Arizona that also contribute to the illegal alien population. Canadians, Chinese, Asian Indians, Africans, Muslims, and lots more, are all going to be subject to the new law. Why did the Suns decide to honor the Latino community only?</p>

		<p>Mexicans in L.A. &#8220;boo&#8221; the U.S. National Anthem with no outrage from the media or our representatives.  The Mexican government is active in its effort to take back the Southwest with little or no response from U.S. politicians, and now we have our sports teams assisting illegal aliens in the invasion of our Nation.  Such are characteristics of a Nation in rapid decline.</p>

<p>The diversity of our league? The NBA is over 70% black! Outside of the whites from Spain and Argentina there are no Hispanics in the NBA. And only 2 Asians.</p>
<p>The buffoons couldn&rsquo;t even get it right in Spanish. It is Los Soles, Not Los Suns.</p>

		<p>Rush made a good point today about this subject:  If the Phoenix Suns were consistent, then they should tell the cops not to pursue charges against those who sneak into the arena without paying.  Comprehensive game ticket reform, if you will.  </p>

<p>Who is the bogyman waiting in the shadows to devour those whites who don&rsquo;t pay homage to &#8220;diversity&#8221;?</p>
<p>Are blacks and Hispanics so dim witted they don&rsquo;t know them they are being patronized?  </p>
<p>Next on the communist agenda will be to punish whites for &#8220;thought crimes&#8221; against minorities and the majority of whites won&rsquo;t even challenge it&hellip;</p>
