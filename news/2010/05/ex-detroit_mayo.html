<h1>Ex-Detroit Mayor Gets up to 5 Years in Prison</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Corey Williams, Google News, May 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Time and again, Kwame Kilpatrick&rsquo;s exceptional oratory skills rallied Detroit voters to his side despite his frequent troubles as mayor.</p>
<p>But all his swagger and professions of love for family, God and the city failed to sway a judge Tuesday, who sent Kilpatrick to prison for up to five years for violating his probation stemming from his conviction for lying under oath about an affair with his chief of staff.</p>
<p>The former mayor&rsquo;s rehabilitation &#8220;clearly .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. has failed,&#8221; Wayne County Circuit Court Judge David Groner said before announcing his sentence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Frankly, your continued attempt to cast yourself as the victim, your lack of forthrightness, your lack of contriteness and your lack of humility serve to affirm that you have not learned your lesson,&#8221; the judge said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Brash and arrogant, Kilpatrick was criticized during his first term for improperly using city credit cards to pay pricey restaurant tabs. It was later revealed that his wife used a city-leased vehicle for her personal use. Each time, he asked for his constituents&rsquo; forgiveness, and he came from behind to win re-election in 2005.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At issue during Tuesday&rsquo;s hearing was $1 million Kilpatrick was ordered to pay the city after pleading guilty in 2008 to obstruction of justice. Groner ruled last month that Kilpatrick failed to report all of his assets and meet other conditions of his probation.</p>
<p>Before Groner sentenced Kilpatrick to one-and-a-half to five years in prison, including 120 days for time served, the former mayor was allowed one more chance to plead for leniency.</p>
<p>Dressed in a dark, custom-fit suit, Kilpatrick stood, paused several moments then cleared his throat as the courtroom packed with the news media, supporters and the curious hushed to listen.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Over the next 15 minutes, Kilpatrick recounted how he fell in love with his wife, Carlita, and later cheated on her; failed as mayor; admitted to the text message scandal, which led to perjury charges and forced him from office; and the 99 days spent in jail after pleading guilty to obstruction of justice charges that stemmed from the scandal.</p>
<p>Kilpatrick described how, after joining his family in an affluent Dallas suburb, he lavished them with gifts &#8220;trying to make everything perfect.&#8221; The problem was that the money spent on plastic surgery for his wife, presents and high living should have been used to help pay what he owed Detroit.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To date, about $140,000 has been paid toward restitution since his 2009 release from jail, with $3,000 each month coming from his $120,000 annual salesman salary at Covisint in Dallas.</p>
<p>But on Monday, Covisint&rsquo;s Detroit-based parent company, Compuware Corp., said it was firing him and that he&rsquo;d be off the payroll by the end of the month. The company said it &#8220;didn&rsquo;t have any&#8221; choice but to fire Kilpatrick.</p>
<p>During restitution hearings, prosecutors revealed that Kilpatrick had funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars into his wife&rsquo;s bank accounts and failed to disclose $240,000 in loans from Compuware Chair Peter Karmanos and other prominent businessmen.</p>
<p>Those claims led Groner to find Kilpatrick guilty of probation violation and to Tuesday&rsquo;s decision to send him to prison.</p>

		<p>Fifty years ago or even 30 years ago it would have been unthinkable for someone like Kwame Kilpatrick to even be elected to office.  Detroit is probably the quintessential example of the destruction that takes place when Blacks run the infrastructure of a city - or anything else for that matter.</p>

		<p>This happened in state court?</p>
<p>I can see what&rsquo;s going to happen, in about October of this year:  Gov. Granholm will commute his sentence to get black voters to vote for whoever the Democrats nominate for Governor; she herself is TLed out.</p>
<p>Otherwise, America&rsquo;s first hip hop mayor is going where all good hip hoppers go.</p>

		<p>I particularly like this quote, from Wayne County Circuit Court Judge David Groner: </p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Frankly, your continued attempt to cast yourself as the victim, your lack of forthrightness, your lack of contriteness and your lack of humility serve to affirm that you have not learned your lesson,&rsquo; the judge said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How predictably laughable!</p>
<p>Antisocial and anti-white psychopathic Marxism, is what drives the blacks of Michigan in general, and the ones from Detroit in particular. There is nothing that is too unacceptable or even unforgivable with the &ldquo;enriching&rdquo; blacks of that so-called city, if &ldquo;whitey in the &lsquo;racist&rsquo; suburbs&rdquo; is going to be hurt in the process. Worse still, a mewling and puking Marxstream media in the city&rsquo;s limits and suburbs, encourages this folly.</p>
<p>This video from the 1980s, should say it all:</p>

<p>All the best to everyone, as can be such; and of course, may God help us all,</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Frankly, your continued attempt to cast yourself as the victim, your lack of forthrightness, your lack of contriteness and your lack of humility serve to affirm that you have not learned your lesson,&rdquo; the judge said.I guess Judge David Groner wasn&rsquo;t in a very sensitive mood and just could not understand how former mayor Kwame Kilpatrick&rsquo;s behavior was the result of white racism.Maybe judge Groner should attend some sensitivity and diversity classes.I am sure we will be hearing how Kilpatrick is the victim of the white mans oppressive court system.If judge Groner is black he must be an uncle Tom.</p>

<p>Kwame the Irish mayor of Detroit just seems to do well, no matter what he does. He must just have such amount of ability that anyone not wanting to hire the man is missing out on something good. </p>
<p>Having worked hard all my life, gotten an education twice, with a lot of experience, I don&rsquo;t even make half that amount of money per year, and AM NOT A CROOK. Much less the mayor of Detroit.</p>
<p>Being the mayor of Detroit is not necessarily such a good thing?</p>

		<p>This is our political future.</p>
<p>Can whites even criticize blacks for anything anymore? Not unless they want to be called &#8216;racist&rsquo;, so they don&rsquo;t. </p>
<p>Whites can now be raped and casually murdered at will by blacks and other minorities. </p>
<p>However, whites don&rsquo;t criticize the statistical facts of their rape and murder for fear of being called &#8216;racist&rsquo;. </p>
<p>If a race will not even complain about their rapes and murders, then that race is doomed. Sorry to put it so bluntly. </p>
<p>This story reminds me of a fantastic documentary online about Liberia. Mass-murdering African warlords run for political office all the time. Africans have no qualms about electing them, much like the situation in Detroit. </p>
<p>If memory serves, I believe it was warlord Mosquito Spray (see the doc for reasons why warlords take outrageous names) who mass-murdered men, women and children in his first term. Now he was up for re-election. </p>
<p>Believe it or not, his campaign slogan was, and I quote:</p>
<p>&#8220;He killed my Mother</p>
<p>He killed my Father</p>
<p>But I would still vote for him again&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, can anyone guess who won the election? You got it, Amren reader! He won by a landslide!</p>
<p>Same thing, practically, in the big D.</p>

		<p>Years back liberal reporters raved that Kwame was &#8220;America&rsquo;s first hip hop mayor&#8221;.</p>
<p>He proved it by ending up in prison just like Lil Wayne and the rest of the Rap Music Rogue&rsquo;s Gallery.</p>

<p>Which, in black parlance, means perhaps 5 months of being treated as a celebrity in jail, and probably coming out with more money that he went in with:)</p>

<p><br>
Kwame Kilpatrick = African &#8220;Big Man&#8221; Syndrome (American version). A child&rsquo;s brain, with a child&rsquo;s lack of self-control   &mdash;   but in an grownup&rsquo;s body, with a grownup&rsquo;s appetites for vice (adultery) and access to (<i>wealthy</i>) grownup&rsquo;s box of toys (expensive cars, clothes, jewelry, cosmetic surgery for the wife) with the help of a Gold Card supplied by the local taxpayers. The proverbial &#8220;kid in a candy store.&#8221; </p>
<p>In short: a foolproof recipe for financial irresponsibility and political disaster. </p>
<p>Just further proof that the words &#8220;hip-hop&#8221; and &#8220;Mayor&#8221; should never be used in the same sentence. </p>

		<p>I think parole eligibility for non-violent crimes in state prison systems tends to kick in after 1/3 of the sentence has been served.  Kwame will be out on parole after serving at most 20 months.  Of course, restitution will still be owed, and if non-payment continues, his P.O. will send him right back to the Big House.</p>
<p>As a side-bet, his wife will probably file for divorce in order to make it harder for Detroit to come after her for the money.<br>
