<h1>Many Blacks Split with Civil Rights Leaders on Immigration</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Earl Ofari Hutchinson, New America Media (San Francisco), May 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The cameras homed in on the Reverend Al Sharpton as he led thousands to the Arizona state capitol building in Phoenix in an old fashioned, energetic, shouting, chanting, sign-carrying civil rights style march. The marchers demanded the repeal of Arizona&rsquo;s hotly contested immigration law. Meanwhile, on the periphery of the march, a small band of counter protesters shouted, hooted, and hectored Sharpton and the other marchers. Their action drew almost no news mention. However, their counter-protest was different. They were mostly African American. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In fact, there is a quiet but glaring disconnect between civil rights leaders&rsquo; outspoken support for liberal immigration reform measures and the unease, wariness and outright antipathy that many blacks feel toward illegal immigration. That disconnect is evident in blog posts, chat rooms, Web sites, letters to newspaper editors, and radio talk shows. Many blacks blame illegal immigrants for the poverty and job dislocation in black communities.</p>
<p>{snip} Far more blacks than whites agree that illegal immigrants take jobs away from blacks and claim to know someone who has lost a job because of illegal immigration.</p>
<p>The first big warning sign of black frustration with illegal immigration came during the battle over Proposition 187 in California in 1994. {snip} But nearly fifty percent of black voters supported it.</p>
<p>Then Republican Gov. Pete Wilson shamelessly pandered to anti-immigrant hysteria and rode it to a reelection victory. Wilson got nearly 20 percent of the black vote in that election  &mdash;  double what Republicans in California typically get from blacks. {snip} Blacks also gave substantial support to anti-bilingual ballot measures in California.</p>
<p>{snip} Despite a handful of lawsuits and settlements by blacks with major employers for alleged racial favoritism toward Hispanic workers, employers vehemently deny that they shun blacks, and maintain that blacks simply don&rsquo;t apply for these jobs.</p>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t just flimsy covers for discrimination. Many blacks will no longer work the low-skilled, menial factory, restaurant, and custodial jobs that they filled in decades past. The pay is too low, the work too hard, and the indignities too great. On the other hand, blacks that seek these jobs are often given a quick brush-off by employers. The subtle message is that blacks won&rsquo;t be hired, even if they do apply. An entire category of jobs at the bottom rung of American industry has been clearly marked as &#8220;Latino-only.&#8221; That further deepens suspicion and resentment among blacks that illegal immigration is to blame for the economic misery of poor blacks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The group that shouted their pro-Arizona immigration law slogans at Sharpton was not much of a sideshow to the immigration march. But their message  &mdash;  that civil rights leaders say one thing about immigration while many blacks feel another way about it  &mdash;  is a sign that immigration draws a line in the sand even among blacks.<br>

		<p>This just proves that the Civil Rights Leaders are  accustomed to dealing with compliant and pliant Whites who give up whatever is demanded of them.  These &#8220;leaders&#8221; automatically see a victim of color anytime Whites do something to respond to an existential crisis, and they go on the always rewarded attack on the Whites.  They are so in touch with White weakness, that they ignore black vulnerability to the illegal brown invasion.  Browns hate blacks, and aren&rsquo;t timid about proving it.  </p>

		<p>I think Hutchinson&rsquo;s article is bull.  &#8220;Blacks don&rsquo;t want the jobs illegals held?&#8221;  Nonsense - anybody who&rsquo;s unemployed and able to work will TODAY take any job that&rsquo;s available; we don&rsquo;t need these illegals to take low paying jobs.  Today people count themselves lucky (and they are!) to have ANY kind of job to get that bread on the table and the roof over the head.  White, black, it doesn&rsquo;t matter; a job is a job today, and while that may not have been true 2 and more years ago, it IS true today.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t buy it that blacks are against illegal immigration. Many illegals ARE black. Also I do not buy that blacks WANT any job that pays minimum wage. I also believe that non-professional blacks will sit on welfare or deal drugs and commit crimes to get quick money and lots of it. From what I have witnessed about blacks is that they are lazy and want &#8220;free&#8221; money, especially since most of that free money comes from Whitey. How long has it been that blacks worked in the fields? A lot longer than when Whites were working the fields!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m impressed   &mdash;   here&rsquo;s a fact that more blacks than whites know.  I guess I have a higher opinion of the average American black than the liberal whites do.  After all, I believe that most blacks are perfectly capable of mowing a lawn, hanging sheet rock, or putting shingles on a roof.  Liberal whites apparently believe that only illegal immigrants are able to do those jobs.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve said this before and I&rsquo;ll say it again, this whole unity thing with blacks and illegal aliens is a charade being put on to show unity for their rainbow coalition.  Many of those black politicians in Washington are sitting in heavily hispanic districts and supporting amnesty is political suicide.  Those grateful latino brothers will return the favor by voting their own people in their seats.  They&rsquo;ll also bring in their families from Mexico and swell these neighborhoods until they eventually  chase the blacks out.     </p>

		<p>Actually all able bodied people black and white [aren&rsquo;t] willing to work, and in fact never have been. Having been an employer all my adult life I can personally attest to that fact especially when the gov&rsquo;t pays them so well in fact they don&rsquo;t even need to work, unless they want a better lifestyle in which case most would still not be willing to work, unless they thought they were going to get wealthy, in fact I&rsquo;ve even known several whites to say this. Why would any [sane] white person [willingly] hire someone who at the drop of a hat would start a  discrimination suit against them? blacks or union, plus I will no doubt be ostrasized but the reason mexicans, legals and illegals, take jobs from blacks is because they will work, and cheaper, however I must say how cheap could we all work if we didn&rsquo;t have to pay the tax bills for all of them? However how many would work for their wages even with no taxes? Few I doubt!</p>

		<p>Well, contrary to what Mexican imperialists and supremacists would have people believe, that blacks and hispanics, are some kind of natural allies against whites. Blacks know they have more in common with American whites then they do with Mexicans. Mexican imperialists and supremacists are just looking for more useful idiots and black elitists like Sharpton fit the bill. Of course black elitists like Sharpton see massive non-white immigration as a way to delute white power, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s in it for them. Of course most black people would rather live under a white power structure then a brown one, even if they won&rsquo;t admit it. The average black person sees know advantage for themselves in following Al Sharptons lead on this issue.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;there is no concrete evidence that the majority of employers hire Latinos at low-end jobs and exclude blacks from them solely because of their race.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, my friend, concrete evidence or not, the fact remains black employment wouldn&rsquo;t be as high as it is if there were no mestizos around, legal or illegal.</p>
<p>And employers DO hire mestizos over blacks, because they&rsquo;re not only better workers they don&rsquo;t complain as much.</p>
<p>But if Hutchinson and black leaders don&rsquo;t want to believe this then I don&rsquo;t mind at all.</p>
<p>Another thing they can&rsquo;t seem to grasp either, is that if mestizos ever take control of the Southwest blacks will have to move out, because mestizos will NOT want them in their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>This &#8220;people-of-color&#8221; nonsense, all under the same umbrella, might work for the leaders of both groups right no, but there are NO people-of-color that have anything in common with blacks and vice versa.  If whites weren&rsquo;t around, both groups would be fighting in the streets right now.</p>
<p>Come to think of it though, they&rsquo;re going to be fighting in the streets anyway, just as they&rsquo;re doing in California, times 100.</p>
<p>Blacks cannot maintain civilizations; they can&rsquo;t run countries effectively without bringing them to ruin.  They&rsquo;re just like a five year old who wants to sit on dad&rsquo;s lap and drive because he thinks he can, but once he&rsquo;s given full control he would wrap the vehicle around a tree.</p>

		<p>Most blacks I&rsquo;ve worked with are 100% against illegal immigration, even the black illegals poster #3 mentions.  There is no love between Nigerian illegals and American blacks.</p>
<p>That said, blacks dont vote the issue generally so its useless to try and form a single issue coalition with them.</p>

		<p>I was there when illegal immigrants broke the (mostly black) janitor union in the 1980s. It happened mostly to the downtown office buildings but I worked at a defense contractor in the San Fernando Valley. When I worked overtime we would see the cleaning crews come in around 9:00 PM. There was never, to my knowledge, any problem with the quality of their work or any reported thefts. While talking to a few of them, they were happy with their jobs and made a decent wage.</p>
<p>One day they were gone and replaced by a crew with only one English speaker who gave orders in Spanish. They lasted for about a month. The rumor was that somebody ratted them out. I left that facility shortly thereafter and do not know if they found a way to get back. You had be a US citizen to work there and classified (as opposed to secret and above) information was stored in locked (easily picked) desks. Obviously, nobody in management vetted the cleaning company, they just wanted the cheaper contract.</p>
<p>People who say the Mexicans took their jobs because of attitude or whatever would be wrong in this case.<br>

		<p>Mestizos are useful to black &#8220;civil rights leaders&#8221; who&rsquo;s entire lives are built around tearing down the white way of life and white people in general.  </p>
<p>As far as your average black and mestizos go, mestizos look down on blacks as some sort of lower life form, and blacks hate them back just as much.</p>
<p>@ (7 - The fact that only a few blacks will admit they had it better under white rule in SA and Zimbabwe(or at least that&rsquo;s what journalists will have us believe) despite the fact that they&rsquo;re starving or dying in the streets now is a testament to the african ego.  They know it&rsquo;s true, but good luck getting them to admit it, ever.</p>

Blacks are split on this issue.</p>
<p>One side sees hispanics as their comrades in joining forces to take down the white man. What these blacks don&rsquo;t understand is that hispanics are using blacks (and the precedents they set) as stepping stones. Hispanics have their own agenda and when they become powerful enough, they will cut off blacks in a heartbeat. </p>
<p>Others do see hispanics as a threat, moving in and taking jobs and their neighborhoods.<br>

<p>So I guess we should hand the country over to Mexico because the are doing such a great job. Mexico is a toilet and now they are pissing all over America. This is exactly why I would never vote for any one for illegal immigration. They feel because whites pretend they serve a real purpose that they are better. Who else would clean their houses, care for their brats and stay in their place?</p>

		<p>At the school where I used to work, I recall many of my black co-workers say things like &#8220;The government does more for the Mexicans than they do for us.&#8221; or &#8220;They get more than we do.&#8221;  I would sometimes raise the question &#8220;Do you know where all the money that the government gives people comes from?&#8221; Only to be met with blank stares. The sense of entitlement is unbelievable. Liberals remind me of spoiled children who have no idea where their parent&rsquo;s money comes from.  What on earth are these people going to do when there are no longer enough white people to produce wealth?  Where is John Galt?</p>

<p>White-  And what none of them will say to us is that for the first time since cowing the whites, blacks have real fear.  They know that if it was up to the mexicans, the blacks will be put on as we whites have: robbed, beaten, raped and murdered.<br>

		<p>Mexico is a failed state, or nearly so. It may become a narco-state.The Mexican immigration problem is a serious national security issue which transcends the human-relations problems illegal immigration represents. The Mexican Mafia is no laughing matter and the amount of money they are cornering is huge. I suspect that over the next few years the government controlled media will be downplaying the hurt feelings of immigrants and the whole Cinco de Mayo fest as things get serious on the border. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised at a news blackout on the border incursions and inevitable firefights. I also wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised at the use of drones, and a few more than usual cases of plague or strangely disabling strains of virus.</p>

		<p>During one of the immigration reform rallies held in St Louis, I avoided the so called free speech zone, and ran my own awareness campaign on Broadway in front of the Fleishmen Hillard building (whose security harassed me repeatedly, but couldn&rsquo;t stop me.) </p>
<p>I had a nice sign, and plenty of pamphlets. Of the people on foot, I got a far more positive response from the blacks than I did from many of the whites that passed. Two of them even helped pass out pamphlets with me. One of them had lost his job as a supervisor of a floor cleaning crew due to not being able to speak Spanish, and Chinese. </p>
<p>Blacks may not like whites, but most of the working class blacks understand dollars, and cents enough to know the illegals are hurting them. </p>
