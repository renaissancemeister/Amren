			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Taranto, Wall Street Journal, May 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Eric Holder is turning into the Joe Biden of the Obama administration. When the attorney general shows up on Capitol Hill, you never know what crazy thing will come out of his mouth. Yesterday he testified at a House Judiciary Committee oversight hearing and produced a memorable addition to his blooper reel.</p>
<p>As the Washington Times reports, just this Sunday Holder had strongly criticized Arizona&rsquo;s new immigration enforcement law:<blockquote>Mr. Holder told NBC&rsquo;s &#8220;Meet the Press&#8221; program that the Arizona law &#8220;has the possibility of leading to racial profiling.&#8221; He had earlier called the law&rsquo;s passage &#8220;unfortunate,&#8221; and questioned whether the law was unconstitutional because it tried to assume powers that may be reserved for the federal government.<br>
</blockquote>Rep. Ted Poe, a Texas Republican, asked Holder to elaborate. FoxNews.com has the transcript:<blockquote><b>Poe: </b>So Arizona, since the federal government fails to secure the border, desperately passed laws to protect its own people. The law is supported by 70% of the people in Arizona, 60% of all Americans and 50% of all Hispanics [see note below], according to the Wall Street Journal/NBC poll done just this week. And I understand that you may file a lawsuit against the law. It seems to me the administration ought to be enforcing border security and immigration laws and not challenge them and that the administration is on the wrong side of the American people. Have you read the Arizona law?</p>
<p><b>Holder: </b>I have not had a chance to  &mdash;  I&rsquo;ve glanced at it. I have not read it.</p>
<p><b>Poe: </b>It&rsquo;s 10 pages. It&rsquo;s a lot shorter than the health care bill, which was 2,000 pages long. I&rsquo;ll give you my copy of it, if you would like to  &mdash;  to have a copy.</p>
<p>Even though you haven&rsquo;t read the law, do you have an opinion as to whether it&rsquo;s constitutional?</p>
<p><b>Holder: </b>I have not really  &mdash;  I have not been briefed yet. We, as I said, have had under way a review of the law. I have not been briefed by the people who have been responsible  &mdash;  who are responsible for that review.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p><b>Poe: </b>You have some concerns about the statute. And it&rsquo;s  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s hard for me to understand how you would have concerns about something being unconstitutional if you hadn&rsquo;t even read the law.</p>
<p>It seems like you wouldn&rsquo;t make a judgment about whether it violates civil rights statutes, whether it violates federal preemption concepts if you haven&rsquo;t read the law. So can you help me out there a little bit, how you can make a judgment call on  &mdash;  on that, but you haven&rsquo;t read the law and determined whether it&rsquo;s constitutional or not?</p>
<p><b>Holder: </b>Well, what I&rsquo;ve said is that I&rsquo;ve not made up my mind. I&rsquo;ve only made  &mdash;  made the comments that I&rsquo;ve made on the basis of things that I&rsquo;ve been able to glean by reading newspaper accounts, obviously, television, talking to people who are on the review panel, on the review team looking at the law.<br>
</blockquote>We should note that Poe misstates one finding of the WSJ/NBC poll: It found that only 27% of Hispanics support the Arizona law (15% strongly, 12% somewhat). Seventy percent oppose it, including 58% strongly. We should also acknowledge that we haven&rsquo;t read the law either, have not formed any opinion about its constitutionality, and are ambivalent about it as a matter of policy and politics.</p>

		<p>I haven&rsquo;t read the law, either, but I can tell you that Holder made himself look like a total idiot on this one.  I actually started laughing at his bumbling attempts to sound intelligent on this issue.  I suggest that he needs to find another job.  We don&rsquo;t need a pendejo like him as our Attorney General!</p>

		<p>Holder&rsquo;s selection as AG was the ultimate blooper. That&rsquo;s the one for which he should apologize. <br>
If BHO&rsquo;s goal was to appoint a Black, Algonquin J. Calhoun would have been a better choice.  At least he would have been amusing.</p>

<p>I am fairly certain that nobody reads anything longer than a couple of pages except</p>
<p>1) Books we choose to read for fun.<br>
2) College texts for class.<br>
3) If our job is on the line (think lesser-paid grunts) </p>

		<p>Underdog,&hellip;..I am unfamiliar with any aspect of the United Nations Charter or the UN Declaration of Human Rights or any other treaty with the United Nations Organization that enables the UN Human Rights Commission to have an opinion on the subject of laws passed by the legislature of a state of the USA and duely signed by the Governor of that state. </p>
<p>Perhaps you could enlighten us as to the authority and expertise of the UN Human Rights Commission.<br>

		<p>Just saw a film clip of Janet Napolitano who hasn&rsquo;t read the law either. Boy! What a Cabinet Obama has. Just yesterday the head of the State Department seemed proud of apologizing to China for our &#8220;Human Rights&#8221; transgressions! Pozner put forth the Arizona Law as equal to China&rsquo;s treatment of their own people as well as any others who crossed their path. Obama must have searched out those who specifically hate America.</p>

		<p>Eric Holder &#8220;hasn&rsquo;t been briefed&#8221; as yet.  Interpretation:  Token ignorant black man, incompetent and in over his head, needs White folks to read and explain 10 pages to him, and they haven&rsquo;t gotten back to him as yet.  Pretty much like ANY workplace that has token, ignorant, unqualified blacks.</p>

		<p>Well, this helps to dispel the whole &#8220;blacks have to be twice as good just to get half the reward&#8221; line commonly uttered by anti-racists. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s certainly not the case for Holder. Holder needs to be dismissed. If for no other reason, Obama needs to be voted out just to get rid of Holder. </p>

		<p>Apparently, any black who can speak in public without repeating Yu-know-wuddum-sayin&rsquo; endlessly qualifies as &#8220;brilliant&#8221;, because I&rsquo;ve heard the term applied to Holder way too many times. Don&rsquo;t know which is more infuriating about this man, his undisguisedly anti-white biase or his utter lack of competence. He must be 85% white, but as usual the 15% part drags the rest down.</p>

		<p>Great comments everyone.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, I have a solution that would fix Washington.<br>
It is simple, perfect really, and it occured to me after living on the back door of Cheyanne Mountain in Colorado. I mean, here is this fortress of a bunker, buried under a mountain and with security ordered to kill anyone like you or me sneaking about.<br>
Bunkers like that are spread from Maryland and VA to Missouri and beyond. Each primed and waiting for political VIP&rsquo;s -as a refuge from some event triggered by Their bad decisions.<br>
Meanwhile, the rest of us are left to go down with the Titanic, while they (the Capitan and crew)escape in those luxury VIP lifeboats.<br>
Power and responsibility Must balance. That is why the Capitan went down with his ship.<br>
SO:<br>
Every time we hold an election, from County Dog Catcher to POTUS, the crook&rsquo;s only fear is to loose his re-election bid and end up out of a job, golfing his taxpayer funded retirement away or &#8216;consulting&rsquo; for the crooks who owned him while in office.</p>
<p>The Solution:<br>
We need a Constitutional ammendment that says,<br>
When a politician (or his appointee) is voted out of office, on their Last day in office there should be a special vote -by the public at large. The ballot should ask one simple question and offer three voting choices.<br>
Did the Office Holder Perform his Job to the satisfaction of We the People?</p>
<p>1. Yes. He did a fine job and deserves his pay and the thanks of a grateful populace.</p>
<p>2. He did a middling job, and has earned nothing -no paycheck, no retirement and no secret service tail for life.</p>
<p>3. No, he did a terrible job. He deserves no pay,more: he and his family shall be stripped of every asset -the proceeds to benifit the general tax fund for the state. Additionally, he should serve a prison term of no less than his time in office.</p>
<p>As I said, it is perfect. Finally political responsibility and political power will balance. Politicians unwilling to obey the people, or just looking to profit from our misery would be unwilling to risk the penalty of failure and would remove themselves from politics for ever, ushering someone willing to be a true voice of their constituancy.</p>
<p>Sorry it is so long, I had to get it out. I felt it was important.</p>
