<h1>Black Lawyer, Rejected in 1847, Admitted to Bar Today</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, May 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has ordered a black lawyer rejected from practicing law in 1847 in Allegheny County because of his race to be posthumously awarded admission to the bar.</p>
<p>George Vashon graduated from Oberlin College in 1844 and went on to study law in Western Pennsylvania under then Judge Walter Forward. {snip}</p>
<p>Pittsburgh attorney Wendell Freeland read about Mr. Vashon&rsquo;s case and along with some of his relatives filed a petition with the state Supreme Court earlier this year. The petition asked Pennsylvania to amend the records to show Mr. Vashon was qualified to be a lawyer.</p>

		<p>Having thought about this a few minutes,I have concluded that I cannot object. A lawyer that is already dead is a much better addition to the bar than one that is alive and capable of causing misery.</p>

		<p>Awarding a person a position who&rsquo;s not even alive? Utterly insane. </p>
<p>In perhaps related  news here in Indiana, a black student became the first valedictorian in a certain university&rsquo;s history. Rather than asking why it took so long, the media swooned over the event as being &#8220;historic.&#8221; </p>
<p>The first black (or hispanic) awarded to any position in any state or any city from dog catcher on up can also be swooned over as being &#8220;historic,&#8221; ensuring a steady progression of false historic events to remind whites of their past vicious racism (and also, of course,  how far we have to go). </p>
<p>Now, as if that is not enough, dead people can now be awarded positions posthumously that they were denied in life, ensuring an endless chain of white penitence and self-flagellation. We might run out of positions we can elect blacks and hispanics to, but we will never run out of dead people.</p>

		<p>So I guess if I ever want this man&rsquo;s services, do I go to the cemetery to contact him, or how do I go about that?  Since he&rsquo;s dead, does that mean I won&rsquo;t need to pay him for his services?  Yes, I know these are stupid and absurd questions.  Then again, it&rsquo;s stupid and absurd to give a man whose been dead for well over 100 years a license to practice law.  Does the Civil Rights industry know no end to their stupidity and depravity?

		<p>If Mr. Vashon was qualified to be an attorney under the standards that were in place in 1847, he should have been admitted to the bar at that time. Did Pennsylvania have a law forbidding blacks from becoming attorneys? The fact that he was a college graduate in that era places him in the talented 10th (more likely, the top 1 - 2%). I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if he had significant amounts of Caucasian DNA. </p>
<p>He probably had a valid case and it has been rectified over 160 years after the fact. The problem I see is that how many people are going to come out of the woodwork to claim ancestry or to claim a wrong that happened in another time and place. </p>
<p>Every so often you hear about the labs that can trace your DNA back to (fill in the blank African country, then region, then down to the tribal level). Could these same firms venture out and start tracing out the fact that your 5th great grandfather was the sole shoemaker for a plantation and he was rented out from time to time to make shoes for some village in the 1800&rsquo;s that is now tract housing or some soulless strip mall. I could see the shakedown artists going after the owner of this strip mall; some poor Vietnamese guy who caught one of the last helicopters out of Saigon when he was 17. Starting off as a dishwasher for $2.00 an hour in 1976, he has moved up to the top 5% of Americans. This guy really oppressed your ancestors.  </p>
<p>George Carlin used to do this bit about people looking for their keys. &#8220;Make sure you look in the watch pocket of your grandfathers WWI uniform, I&rsquo;m sure you handed him your car keys before the Battle of Verdun!&#8221;</p>

		<p>This sounds like North Korea, where the deified Kim Il Sung (&#8220;Fatherly Chairman,&#8221; &#8220;Great Leader,&#8221; &#8220;Heavenly One,&#8221; etc.) remains president, though dead. The starving country, at huge expense, keeps its &#8220;Eternal Leader&#8221; preserved like a frozen vegetable in a glass box, inside his vacated palace, and no one else can ever be called &ldquo;President.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&hellip; Which reminds one of our own &#8220;sainted&#8221; Martin Luther King, whose personality cult now looms larger than that of the Founding Fathers. Then, of course, there&rsquo;s their latest fabrication, the entire bio of the mysterious President Obama. </p>
<p>It seems essential to leftism in general, across the world, to perversely and hysterically defy reality: to forbid, rewrite, legislate, coerce and indoctrinate it from existence. So why not admit a dead lawyer to the Bar?</p>

		<p>If George Vashon  were made President, maybe he could act as a bridge between the deepest division in American society  &mdash;  between the living and the dead?<br>
What are graveyards if not massive ghettos for those whose only crime is to not to be as alive as you?<br>
&#8216;Dead&rsquo; and &#8216;alive&rsquo; are not even useful categories to describe people. There really are no such things. Where do people in a comas fit in? What about people who are in a persistant vegetative state? There is no fixed boundary between the living and the dead. Modern science, with it&rsquo;s ability to have people cryogenically preserved, will further blur the distinction. This is the reality of the 21st century. Mortophobes will just have to deal with it.</p>
<p>Vote change.<br>
Vote Vashon.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t these jokers have anything better to do? Like maybe read the Constitution and consider what it was meant to do then and now? Please, people, go practice law and let the dead worry about passing the bar exam. Unlike the current attorneys, he may have been too honest to make a good lawyer anyway. Please, please stop this nonsense. Stop looking for another way to make yourselves feel pure as the driven snow and non-racist. Spend time with your children and wives. Read the Bible. But please stop looking for people to make your contrived guilt less.</p>
