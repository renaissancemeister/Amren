			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Francis X. Gilpin, Fayetteville Observer (North Carolina), May 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Arizona officials say they are overrun with Mexicans. In Hoke County, though, Mexicans seem to be heading home  &mdash;  and some business owners miss them.</p>
<p>Raeford mobile home park owner Isidoro Basurto said scores of Mexican families have re-crossed the border in the past year, resigned to tougher immigration enforcement and a bad economy north of the Rio Grande.</p>
<p>../../../../__8220.css;I can tell you, 99 percent of the people that move from this mobile home park, they go back to Mexico,&#8221; Basurto said.</p>
<p>The Mexican departures may be subtly reshaping the demographics of Hoke County and other North Carolina communities where, until recently, Hispanic immigrants were recruited for demanding but low-wage jobs in farm fields and meat-packing plants  &mdash;  jobs that Americans have shunned.</p>
<p>Business owners who cater to Hispanics bemoan the slumping sales that have followed the sad farewells of customers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>El Ranchero, a Mexican grocery store in Lumberton, used to be a well-known spot for immigrants to find anything from fresh produce to the latest Mexican music CDs.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s the place to buy a one-way ticket back to Mexico  &mdash;  with buses departing seven days a week.</p>
<p>../../../../__8220.css;Nobody wants to give us steady work,&#8221; Dagoberto Garcia said in Spanish as he waited with four other men under the shade of an awning. ../../../../__8220.css;For many years, places like the meat-processing plants and farms welcomed us with open arms. Today, they won&rsquo;t even let us on the premises to apply for work.</p>
<p>../../../../__8220.css;I&rsquo;m going home and coming back when it gets better.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In addition to fickle employers and a wobbly economy, immigrant laborers such as Garcia and Herrara say controversial deportation efforts, including the 287(g) program, are prompting them to leave North Carolina. The 287(g) program is named after a section of the federal Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act.</p>
<p>Supporters of a crackdown on illegal immigration hope 287(g) and other U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement initiatives will create jobs for unemployed Americans.</p>
<p>In response, however, employers have chosen other ways to find cheap foreign labor.</p>
<p>Mountaire Farms, which runs a large poultry-processing plant in Lumber Bridge, is said to have hired a contractor to supply immigrant workers from Burma and Thailand.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Michael Tirrell, vice president of human resources and business services for Mountaire Farms, would not directly address whether Burmese or Thai workers have taken jobs once held by Mexicans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hispanic advocates said they are witnessing what amounts to a widespread repatriation to Mexico.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>../../../../__8220.css;Who&rsquo;s staying? The people who could care less if they get arrested,&#8221; said Vasquez [Lucy Vasquez, executive director of Amigos International in Wilmington], whose agency does work in Bladen and Sampson counties.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Basurto, who runs a cafeteria at the plant, said the personnel office began getting rid of Mexicans after a 2008 U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement raid at a sister plant in South Carolina.</p>
<p>House of Raeford settled criminal charges of deliberately hiring undocumented workers last year by paying a $1.5million fine and agreeing to closer monitoring by ICE in Raeford and at seven other plants.</p>
<p>Basurto has felt the fallout in the cafeteria. Basurto said he has gone from selling $2,000 worth of Mexican food a day to about $200.</p>
<p>During a recent lunch break, a procession of black workers were seen walking from the plant to a nearby convenience store. Basurto said he is considering more Southern comfort food for his menu.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sister Jeanne Morgan, pastoral administrator at St. Elizabeth of Hungary Catholic Church in Raeford, said fewer Mexicans attend a 9 a.m. Mass in Spanish on Sundays.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Morgan speculated that the disappearance of Mexicans may just be peculiar to Hoke County because the meat plants are close by.</p>
<p>State figures show the Hispanic student body in Hoke County public schools increased by 11.3 percent between the 2007-08 and 2008-09 school years. But the growth in Hispanic enrollment slowed to 5.2percent this year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The CommWell Health chain of community clinics in Bladen, Sampson and nearby counties is treating fewer migrant farm workers. Victoria Martin, marketing and public relations manager for what used to be called the Tri-County Community Health Council, said the clinic has seen modest decreases in migrant patients for three consecutive years.</p>
<p>Like Hoke County, Bladen County reported a slowdown in Hispanic public school enrollment, from an 8 percent increase in 2009 to only 2 percent this year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many Hispanics cleared out after Smithfield began rechecking their Social Security numbers and ICE raided the slaughterhouse, both in 2006.</p>
<p>Blacks took the place of many Hispanics. Black workers went from 41percent of the Tar Heel work force in 2006 to 54percent in 2008.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although the same Mexican-to-black employment transformation has taken place at House of Raeford, census estimates have yet to reflect an outflow of Hispanics from Hoke County  &mdash;  and may never.</p>

		<p>I live in Virginia but my dad grew up near Greenville, NC and I used to go there to visit my grandmother.  I remember seeing Mexicans there in the early 90s but it was another decade before they showed in the area of Virginia in which I live.  Even as late as 2000 I would have said ../../../../__8220.css;What Mexicans?&#8221;  But North Carolina got infected with them first.  In fact, NC must be an easier place to get a driver&rsquo;s license because you see many cars around here with NC plates, much more so than a decade or two ago.  But whenever you see the driver they are Hispanic.</p>
<p>Hopefully the Mexicans aren&rsquo;t numerous along the NC coast.  We used to drive down to Atlantic Beach each summer and I have fond memories of those places.  Haven&rsquo;t been since 1998.</p>

		<p>Some people who post here say the demographic trends can&rsquo;t be reversed. But this news story is an indication that it can be reversed. Native born white Americans haven&rsquo;t even flexed their muscles yet, and when they do there will be many more self-deportations.</p>
<p>We will have absolutely no problem getting rid of the Muslims. We are only one more major terrorists attack away from doing it.</p>
<p>The Asians..shut down the H-1 B and L-1 B visa programs immediately along with a complete shut down of Asian immigration O. If the larger Asian community is perceived as a fifth column by the majority native born white American population, the Asians will start to self-deport.</p>
<p>The very enormous question is, How will millions of native born white Americans react to the very real possibility of a greatly reduced living space? Millions of native born white Americans haven&rsquo;t even contemplated this question yet. But if they do, there is a strong possibility that there will be a very strong reaction against the losing several large states with several trillions dollars worth of  infrastructure. </p>
<p>From an ecological perspective, the mass self-deportation of millions of high fertility Mexicans will provide a breathing space for the three thousand endangered species in America. The ecological case against importing high fertility Mexicans is very strong.</p>

<p>If an HONEST investigative reporter really did some detailed research on employment figures regarding blacks and Hispanics, I&rsquo;m pretty sure he would report that the mestizo invasion has put millions of blacks on the welfare rolls.</p>
<p>I know for a fact that crooked employers would rather hire mestizos before anyone else, because they have almost complete control over them, and they pay them less.  Rarely, in my experience, have I known of employers who pay overtime to mestizo laborers.</p>
<p>However, even if the truth were known, I&rsquo;m pretty certain Jesse and Al would still be huddled under the non-white umbrella with other non-whites.  Mestizo leaders feel the same as the black leaders.  Both groups are in favor of promoting any policy that will weaken the white power base in this country, uncaring one iota about whether or not such policy is economically disastrous.  They want power and they&rsquo;re willing to throw anyone under the bus who they see as obstacles to that quest.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sick of hearing this tired old lie. Who did these jobs before????? Americans did, that&rsquo;s who. The statement should read ../../../../__8220.css;jobs in farm fields and meat-packing plants-jobs that Americans can&rsquo;t do for slave wages so they get illegals.</p>
<p>../../../../__8220.css;In response, however, employers have chosen other ways to find cheap foreign labor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again in a nutshell. It&rsquo;s not the jobs Americans shun, it&rsquo;s the jobs Americans can&rsquo;t do for slave wages. The problem isn&rsquo;t just Mexicans, it&rsquo;s GREEDY TRAITOR AMERICAN EMPLOYERS.</p>

		<p>I was born in NC and occasionally visit my parents who live in a small town north of Asheville.  It&rsquo;s absolutely shocking how many Mexicans live in the state, it&rsquo;s seems to be about the same number you&rsquo;d find in a border state.  My own hometown which was almost 100 percent White back in the 80s is now about 10 percent or more Mexican and there&rsquo;s one area of Asheville that looks like Tijuana.  I don&rsquo;t really trust these stories about them leaving because I suspect the game is to use the media to create an illusion that they are leaving to keep the pressure off the government to do something and to set us up for ../../../../__8220.css;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221; not too distant in the future.</p>

		<p>While tough economic times are part of the impetus, note that this article shows that even a modicum of law enforcement will drive the mestizo invaders away.  Just remember that next time some politician, usually a Republican, says that there are too many to send home.  All it takes is the will to do so.</p>

		<p>North Carolina used to have plenty of Americans who would work in the fields and meat-packing plants.  Then in the 60s the feds decided to start paying them to do nothing.</p>
<p>Now, given the chance to make minimum-wage working in the fields, or get more money from the government for doing nothing, what would you do?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the insane liberal policies that have wrought the immigration nightmare.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;ve killed off 40-50 million Americans through the abortion genocide since Roe v. Wade you shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised that you&rsquo;re going to get millions of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>When you raise the minimum wage to a rate that doesn&rsquo;t justify the output, you&rsquo;re going to get an influx of off-the-books workers who don&rsquo;t know anything about labor laws and couldn&rsquo;t care less anyways.</p>
<p>When you take the manual labor class and spend 50 years pretending they&rsquo;re going to all become doctors and lawyers so long as you throw enough money at them and surround them with enough white kids, you shouldn&rsquo;t shrug your shoulders and wonder aloud where all the Americans went that would do these jobs.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re at Southern University, ../../../../__8220.css;completing&#8221; their freshman year, when they can find the time in between assault and battery incidents and Sharpton media circuses.</p>

		<p>Jobs Americans won&rsquo;t do&hellip;not true.  Not too long ago a meat packing plant in Arkansas(?) had to fire it&rsquo;s Mestizo workers and Americans (white and black) were lined up for the jobs.  During the dust bowl whites went west to pick crops.  After the war blacks had most of the northern big city custodian jobs - good unionized jobs (W. Williams a number of years ago wrote how the employers were able to break the janitor unions by hiring Chicanos to take the blacks place).  When I was a kid the crops in South jersey were picked by Puerto Ricans (remember, Puerto Ricans are Americans too).</p>
<p>We have plenty of unskilled whites, blacks and Puerto Ricans.  We do not need a single Mexican or any other immigrant for that matter!<br>

It was a good many years ago, (the early 70&rsquo;s) to be sure, but my siblings,classmates and myself worked summers picking and packing fruit to earn extra money for things we wanted for the coming school year. (I am a white female) We worked hard, were paid fair wages (for high school students) and everybody was happy. I would wager that if the orchards got rid of the gangs of illegal Mexican rapists and other thugs, so high school students (and their parents) felt safe again, and a slightly higher wage was paid, you would again find throngs of American teenagers willing to work in orchards, hop fields, cold storage facilities, as hotel housekeepers, construction jobs (for the boys, and even a few girls) at McDonalds, as janitors at cinemas, and all the other low-level entry jobs that America&rsquo;s young people are effectively shut out of presently. </p>

		<p>The situation in Southern states like Georgia, Virginia (where the numbers are low except around DC) and North Carolina (where the numbers are definitely the greatest) IS probably reversible through increased enforcement.

		<p>There is a larger economic point everyone here needs to understand:labor scarcities are a wonderfull thing.The White White underclass has always benefitted from labor scarcities. In fact when labor scarcities are severe, the economic status of White American workers dramaticlly improves.</p>
<p>A labor scarcity should never be used as an excuse to import nonwhite workers. If you do, you get exactly what is happening today:the rapid race-replacement of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS with post-1965 nonwhites. So the even bigger noneconomic point is this:do not allow immigration enthusiasts and post-1965 nonwhites make an economic case against the race-replacement of the NATIVE BORN WHITE MAJORITY. There is no economic case for doing this. WE can very easily live with a severe labor scarcity. WE have done it before. </p>
<p>Labor scarcities can be addresed in very easily. Mechanize and roboticize the work force. This can be done very easily. I follow the robotics field very closely. You can not believe how far advanced the field has become. Take a lesson from the Japanese. </p>
<p>I can not overemphasize how important it is for White Nationalists to realize that the economic case against OUR race-replacement does  not exist&hellip;not for economic reasons&hellip;but for racial reasons. This is exactly how you all should frame the issue in public.</p>

		<p>Jupiter #2 is correct.  Native-born Americans are beginning to react mightily to the Mexican invasion.  I believe the Tea Party movement is gaining strength primarily because neither major party wants to stop illegal immigration.  The proposed plan which would require an ID card with DNA would certainly go a long way toward stopping it, but now that&rsquo;s on the back burner (at best!)  Most Americans are afraid of large fines and/or imprisonment and will not take the chance of either by getting caught with illegals on their payroll.  </p>

		<p>I live in a small town in NC in a farming area. I do beleive that a lot of the latinos have left although a lot are still here. 3 or so years ago one could go in wal mart on a sat or sunday and it may as well be in mexico. Probably 60-70% mexicans. Now it only probably 40% or so. I learned spanish about 6 years ago and it paid off,, I made a lot of money selling to mexicans because I could talk to them,, but now only a sale once in a while. They left when the construction industry stopped building. Still a bunch on the farms. The only reason the mexicans came is that there were jobs available of which the blacks and white trash would not do because they did not have to work. Its far easier to just walk to the mailbox and get your welfare check. You cant really blame the employers when they cant find other workers to fill the jobs that should be done by the blacks. One mexican will perform better than 6 blacks who are just constantly complaining and trying to find something to sue the employer for.  We are in a mess,, lets hope we are waking up. KF</p>

		<p> I&rsquo;ve been surprised by the number of Mexicans in North Carolina myself. This is a very recent development. Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m a little skeptical about the Mexicans returning home. My bet is they are going to other states, particularly Midwestern States.</p>

		<p>They obviously haven&rsquo;t been to my neck of the woods. The warm weather has brought them out of the woodwork, just like a swarm of termites. There has been a rash of [more than usual] arrests for DUI, drug dealing, robberies and traffic accidents involving illegals in the past month or so. They&rsquo;re ALREADY home. Here.</p>

		<p>Isidoro Basurto has felt the fallout in the cafeteria. Basurto said he has gone from selling $2,000 worth of Mexican food a day to about $200.</p>

<p>Lo siento mucho, Senor Basura, but your business shouldn&rsquo;t exist and you should leave the country pronto, along with your compatriots. BTW, I see no evidence that they are leaving the country, just scattering like cockroaches when the light is shone on them.</p>

		<p>I certainly haven&rsquo;t seen a slowdown on West Washington St. in Indianapolis. It still looks like a chunk of Mexico City plopped down here in flyover country. However, like a lot of people have stated about the work ethic of blacks and deadbeat whites, the Mexicans will work. Shut off welfare, that will clear out most of the ghettos and the black &amp; white deadbeats will find a work ethic or starve. I also suspect that if I took a 64 Impala into the ../../../../__8220.css;Taller Mecanico&#8221; that he would do a better job than Tyrone or Leroy. </p>
<p>This ought to be interesting when the Mexicans and other Hispanics start dislodging the blacks who are in positions of power. There are lots of undeveloped corn fields that can be turned into housing here in the doughnut counties of central Indiana.  </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not in favor of importing ANY cheap labor foreign workers.  But at least it must be said that these  Asians have NO TERRITORIAL AMBITIONS on the United States, and they&rsquo;re just here to work (not to  re-colonize or re-conquer).   Therefore, they&rsquo;re at least preferable to Mexicans who are here in a double role.  (But should we have to pick between them?  As Ranger said above, the mestizo invasion has probably put millions of blacks on the welfare roles. And the Asian invasion will enable them to stay there.)</p>

		<p>This article is one piece of the puzzle in my understanding of why socialism/Marxism/Communism made significant inroads into America.  Corporate fat cats in their quest for cheap labor import millions of illegal workers to undercut American&rsquo;s wages and drive them out of the meat packing industry.  An industry that at one time used to provide a good living for working class people.  Now that these illegal workers have become problematic, they don&rsquo;t even bother to hire Americans at a decent wage but instead import legal cooley labor at pennies on the dollar.  This is a war against the working class and the poor.  Call me old fashioned but I believe that any adult in this country should be able to work any job and be able to buy the basic necessities of life with enough money left over for the pursuit of quality of life issues.  That&rsquo;s how it was back in the 1950s.  Now you&rsquo;ve got these evil CEOs who&rsquo;ll do anything to make a buck, even sell out the country.     </p>

<p>Wonder how much of that he paid taxes on. HERE&rsquo;S an idea! let&rsquo;s do what most other countries do, if a foreigner opens a business in the U.S. and is not a citizen, a CITIZEN MUST OWN 51% of the business and collect 51% of the profits made by said business! The 51% is not bought by the CITIZEN is is an obligated REQUIREMENT to do business in the U.S. Closely monitor and audit them and if they cheat, instant criminal deportation and loss of all bank assets surrendered to the sponsoring citizen.</p>

The black leadership care no more for the black population than do the hispanic or white leadership care for their own people. They are only in it for themselves.  The blacks, hispanics and liberal white leaders are all part of the ruling cadre that only cares about holding on to their power.  The huge numbers of Mexican illegals are future democrat voters which will guarantee power to the white, black and hispanic political leadership.  They have no racial solidarity with their own ethnicities, it is all about the elites.</p>

<p>I considered moving there in the 1970s, when I already sensed what was coming.  That was 35 years ago! Inevitably, multiculturalism and the Third World invasion will catch up with you and will come to everywhere.  There is no little corner of America where you can escape. When will Americans realize this and stop running?</p>

<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>So true.   Greed now rules!  I can remember the 50s. And the 60s too. And I will never see the same standard of living or quality of life that my parents (and grandparents)  had.  In every respect, they were better off.  The USA was far less populated, with more of everything for everyone. </p>
<p>Even such basic things   &mdash;   not measurable in monetary terms   &mdash;   such as abundant space, safety, trust, neighborliness, civility &hellip;. all of these things today are gone. You can&rsquo;t get them at any price.  Schools didn&rsquo;t have guards and metal detectors!  It was unimaginable.  And they didn&rsquo;t teach that whites are the cause of all evil, and our history is a chronicle of shame. That blacks and minorities have built this country, and that whites are parasites and expoiters.  Stores didn&rsquo;t require you to check your bags upon entering.   Clerks were polite.  Civility was the rule, instead of rudeness.   And filthy language was totally unknown in public life. You would never see or hear it in the media.  All of these things are gone now, in favor of   ../../../../__8220.css;civil rights&#8221; and multiculturalism, which was supposed to be an improvement. So we were told.  What a loss!</p>
