	<p>&#8220;Why is it racism is we call them &#8216;black&rsquo; and not racism if they call us &#8216;white&rsquo;&#8221;?</p>
<p>&#8220;I never called anybody &#8216;Nigger&rsquo; or &#8216;Black&rsquo; or anything like that. On the other hand, those of us who were White were talked about derogatorily. It was negative to be White, Christianity and Norwegian culture was negative and there were many curses,&#8221; says Mari Morken (16) and rattles them off &#8220;Whitey, potato and white cheese&#8221;</p>
<p>Three years ago she couldn&rsquo;t take it any more. She moved from a school in Groruddalen to a school on the west side. Every morning she takes the subway to the other side of the city to escape the curses and the bad class-environment. Where she goes now, it&rsquo;s good to have good grades, and she doesn&rsquo;t stand out because she&rsquo;s light. Before she made dark stripes in her medium-blond hair. Now she dyes her hair a bit lighter. She&rsquo;s in the process of &#8216;taking back&rsquo; her Norwegianity, and is happy to be blond without being branded &#8216;whore&rsquo; and cheap&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, girl, blond whore!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8216;Josephine&rsquo; was met with these words on the first school day at a high-school in an immigrant-dominated suburb south of Stockholm. Josphine was quite baffled, since aside from her hair color there was nothing about her appearance that would indicate she was promiscuous. She didn&rsquo;t use makeup and had completely neutral clothing. It was exclusively her hair-color that branded her a &#8216;whore&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8216;Josephine&rsquo; is one of the informants for researchers Maria Bäckman, who did an ethnographic field study in a suburb south of Stockholm, where ethnic Swedes make up about 20% of the population. They&rsquo;re therefore a minority. Klassekampen met Bäckman this week when she visited the University in Oslo and the Culcom research program (cultural complexity in the new Norway). She&rsquo;s the first in Sweden who researched ethnic Swedes as a minority. A similar study was not done in Norway.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the suburbs the invisible Swedishness become visible. Ethnic Swedes experience being defined and labeled by their culture and religion, similarly with minorities of a different background,&#8221; Bäckman told Klassekampen.</p>
<p>In her study she focused on ethnic Swedish girls. They experience being linked to the notion of free, Swedish sexuality, which in the densely immigrant suburbs is not necessarily linked with something positive. The strategy for the suburb girls was therefore to play down their Swedish identity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Several dyed their hair. Not necessarily because they wanted to look like immigrants, but because they didn&rsquo;t want to look so Swedish,&#8221; says Bäckman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&rsquo;s typical, Exactly like that.&#8221; Mari Morken nodded vigorously to us from the other side of the cafe table when we repeated some of what Maria Bäckman has found out. &#8220;I was called a whore so many times, I became immune.&#8221;</p>
<p>We meet her and her mother, Kristin Pedersen, for a talk about why Mari changed schools. They tell of systematic bullying and harassment since Mari reached puberty when she was 10-11, till she transferred school when she was 13.</p>
<p>Pedersen is still upset at the school&rsquo;s lack of handling of the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;They laid the responsibility for the situation on Mari. She just had to cope, because she was strong in resources, white middle-class. But Mari also has a right to a good and safe environment,&#8221; says Pedersen, who tried to address the harassment repeatedly without anything being done. She was told that the bullies had a very difficult time at home.</p>
<p>Mari says that now, after three years, she&rsquo;s distanced herself enough to come forward with it. &#8220;I want to show that I won&rsquo;t let it break me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although school was a nightmare, they like their home area, and they have a good relationship with their Pakistani neighbors. Mari remembers her childhood as safe and nice. She also enjoyed school during the first years. In first grade a third of the students were of non-Norwegian background. When she left, barely a third of the class were ethnic Norwegian.</p>
<p>&#8220;At first all the Norwegian girls were active in class, but in the end we Norwegian girls sat in the back of the classroom and were silent as a mouse while the others made a racket,&#8221; says Mari.</p>
<p>Kristin Pedersen thinks it happens when the group of immigrant background becomes too big and dominating. Something which isn&rsquo;t positive. The elementary school Mari started at, has just 5% ethnic Norwegians. Mari knows three girls who started there but then moved to a school with a smaller proportion of immigrants. All the girls are naturally blond, but had dyed their hair dark.</p>
<p>Althoguh Mari got negative attention from the boys, it was a girls&rsquo; gang made up of an ethnic Norwegian and three girls of Pakistani background who devastated her.</p>
<p>&#8220;the girls too on the boys&rsquo; role in a way. They were into fighting and conflicts,&#8221; says Mari, who was also physically attacked.</p>
<p>Once, the situation escalated so much that the teacher chose to calm the situation by asking Mari to go home. After school eight of the students trooped home with her.</p>
<p>For a long time Mari didn&rsquo;t dare go to the local center. She knew that the girls had told older boys in the A and B gangs [ed: Pakistani gangs] that she had said nasty things about their skin color and religion.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s what provokes them the most,&#8221; says Mari.</p>
<p>Kristin Pedersen says that boys who parents are assumed to be linked to the gangs, had for a long time acted threateningly towards Mari&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>But the straw that broke the camel&rsquo;s back for Mari was that when she was in 7th grade, she got the responsibility to teach the others in class choreography for a school play. Mari was mainly active in dance and the school therefore thought she could take the job. Of course everything went wrong when she was supposed to teach the bullies.</p>
<p>At that point, Pedersen and her husband got tired of the lack of response form the school and complained about it to the county, which agreed with them on several points. A few days after they lodged a complaint, the principal was put on early retirement.</p>
<p>Klassekampen has been in contact with the retired headmaster. She says it&rsquo;s a positive thing that we&rsquo;re dealing with the issues regarding how we live together, but thinks maybe we should take with somebody else. For reasons of confidentiality, she didn&rsquo;t want to go into the specific harassment case. She didn&rsquo;t want to comment on the decision of the county either.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before I always went in long pants and t-shirts, regardless of how warm it was,&#8221; says Mari.</p>
<p>She changed after transferring schools. She replaced the hooded sweater with tight clothes and makeup. This summer she will go with a singlet, which she didn&rsquo;t dare do before. She was ashamed if her bra strap was showing. But now she&rsquo;s decided not to care about the stares.</p>
<p>Maria Bäckman&rsquo;s field work outside Stockholm shows the same trend. Girls dress neutrally and tone down their femininity, in order to avoid stares and attention. Another thing she found out was that several went with a cross. Not necessarily because they were so Christian but because it was embarrassing not to have a religious identity.</p>
<p>Mari nods vigorously again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know people who go with a cross in order to be accepted. It&rsquo;s a little like going with brand clothes. There are just some codes you need to follow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I&rsquo;ve been confirmed secularly, but I think it would be difficult to be accepted for that, if I had continued to go to a school in Groruddalen,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Though Mari doesn&rsquo;t see herself as Christian, she sees Christianity as &#8216;her religion&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We learned more about the others&rsquo; religion than about our own.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought it was more exciting with other religions, but our religion never got the same positive attention,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Upbringing, education and living conditions are the key words for the government&rsquo;s effort in Groruddalen, which will continue till 2016. Mother and daughter have noticed that there&rsquo;s new recreational activities for the youth, but Mari has stayed away, both because she&rsquo;s uncomfortable in the community, and because she feels foreign in those activities.</p>
<p>&#8220;They reach group who don&rsquo;t have any activities today. It doesn&rsquo;t unify. Many of the ethnic Norwegian don&rsquo;t go to this. It actually reinforces the differences,&#8221; says Mari.</p>
<p>Kristin Pedersen thinks the problem is the attitudes of the responsible politicians and the professions who work with integration.</p>
<p>&#8220;They need to understand that were we live, we could all feel like a minority. Therefore it&rsquo;s also necessary to have a minority perspective for the ethnic Norwegian parts of the population,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>When it comes to the teachers and school administration in Groruddalen, Pedersen thinks that they should be trained in creating a positive environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are so afraid of being called racists. They fear getting involved with the difficult things, because they&rsquo;re afraid it will be used against them,&#8221; she says.</p>

		<p>I saw a documentary about a Swedish boy, is late 30ish parents ONLY child and how awful life was as a minority in his school.  He had no friends and couldn&rsquo;t play outside.  His parents thought living in a diverse community would be good for him.  They had no intentions of moving but did transfer him to a private school.  The boy was sad looking, I think he was about 10 or 12, talking about the abuse he took and being lonely.  But this is what the politicians want.</p>
<p>Until the Scandinavians start peacefully holding protests outside the residences of their kings and prime ministers and start voting the liberal parties out of office the politicians will continue on their suicidal way.<br>

		<p>Were Sweden and Norway one of the previously-100% white countries that chided whites, especially white southerners, for their &#8216;racism&rsquo; and &#8216;mean&rsquo; treatment of blacks?  If so, maybe they now know what we put up with.  It&rsquo;s easy to criticize whites for NOT wanting to be around large groups of blacks or for wanting laws like Arizona when these same liberal whites have not experienced it for themselves.  </p>

<p>No need to be ironic about the whole situation. The reality is, non-whites are &#8216;proud&rsquo; of sticking it to whitey, while whites are &#8216;proud&rsquo; of how anti-racist they are. That is, proud of favoring non-whites over other whites or themselves. It is quite possible a day will come when this will change.  </p>

		<p>This is such a sad story.</p>
<p>Right away you have to wonder why on earth there are Pakistanis and other muslims in Norway and Sweden. But we already know the answer, don&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p>The party line is that immigrant labor is needed to do the low skilled, low paying work that Swedes and Norwegians won&rsquo;t or don&rsquo;t want to do. And then there&rsquo;s the other likely argument which is that the Swedes and Norwegians have such low birth rates that third world immigrants are needed to help fund the retirements for the elderly population.</p>
<p>But did any of the social engineers who came up with the brilliant idea of bringing in Pakistanis and Somalis consider the costs of introducing alien cultures and races into Scandinavia? Is having someone clean the toilets cheaply really worth the social turmoil that comes with multiculturalism? </p>
<p>They could have tightened their belts and worked a bit harder to provide for their aging population, but instead they decided to import foreigners into their midst who are so different culturally that they will never become Scandinavians, and furthermore, these foreigners are actively hostile toward the cultural and values of traditional Scandinavia. Some deal, these cheap workers.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason for bringing the foreigners in&hellip; it&rsquo;s not worth it! There is nowhere else on earth for Swedes and Norwegians to go and be themselves as they have been for thousands of years. Scandinavians, preserve what you have - your culture and history is tied to your homelands. It&rsquo;s irreplaceable and sacred. Don&rsquo;t throw it away for short term economic gain.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope there&rsquo;s still time for Scandinavia to wake up and come to their senses.</p>

		<p>Not to beat a dead horse but what would happen to the demographics of that area is sweden suddenly refused to give welfare to non-whites (or more likely to anyone at all)?</p>
<p>They would vanish.  As would the problem.</p>
<p>White countries don&rsquo;t have a race problem.  The race problem is only a symptom.  We have a socialism problem.  Socialism only works for white people.  That&rsquo;s one of the reasons it holds such strong appeal to so many white people.  They look at it and say&hellip;.man, if we adopted this, life would be so much better, happier etc.  The poor would be fed and uplifted.  No one would sweat it if they temporarily lost their job.  Grandma would be cared for even if she had no family to look after her.</p>
<p>Great.  Except it only workds for whites&hellip;.because only christian whites have altruism for each other.</p>
<p>When non-whites are allowed to participate, they quickly attach themselves as parasites, feel free to indulge a whole host of pathologies now that the survival pressure is off them and then, when their numbers are sufficient, use it as a weapon of warfare against whites.</p>
<p>Armies need to eat.  These people are too stupid and dysfunctional to feed themselves.  They hate us and would make war on us but can&rsquo;t maintain the supply chain.  Welfare and socialism solves this problem for them.  So they then war against us.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also their weakness.  At any time whites can, specifically, cut their supply chain and wipe them out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s our choice, not theirs.  This goes on because we choose it, not then.  Five minutes after we decide to not do it, they will start to fall apart and disperse out of our lands.  We could get them in a matter of weeks&hellip;..no a matter of days&hellip;.just by choosing to.</p>

		<p>Sweden is not alone in the school scenario related here. Britain, Canada, Australia, U.S. or any other prosperous white country that floods their country with non-white immigrants, all report similar experiences in their city schools. </p>
<p>To add insult to these students&rsquo; fragile natures, their teachers whether in Europe or North America, always manage to turn a blind eye to what is happening under their noses.</p>

		<p>To Poster 3 - White is Right</p>
<p>Yes, Sweden&rsquo;s Gunnar Myrdal got the whole civil rights movement going with his 1944 book</p>
<p>&#8220;An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy  is a 1944 study of race relations authored by Swedish economist  Gunnar Myrdal and funded by The Carnegie Foundation. The foundation chose Myrdal because it thought that as a non-American, he could offer a more unbiased opinion. Myrdal&rsquo;s volume, at nearly 1,500 pages, painstakingly detailed what he saw as obstacles to full participation in American society that African-Americans faced as of the 1940s.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
And, he probably invented this line, which you hear endlessly repeated (apparently someone else added &#8220;the legacy of slavery&#8221; later on):</p>
<p>&#8220;White prejudice and discrimination keep the Negro low in standards of living, health, education, manners and morals. This, in its turn, gives support to white prejudice. White prejudice and Negro standards thus mutually &lsquo;cause&rsquo; each other.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The solution is simple - Swedes need to screw up the courage and demand that foreigners be repatriated. Some might say that one can&rsquo;t be deported after they&rsquo;ve gotten a passport. Baloney. It&rsquo;s the only reasonable solution. And, sooner or later, they&rsquo;ll realize it.</p>

They were so militant in opposing South Africa in the good old days of Apartheid, and now that they are becoming disenchanted with the multiracialism that they thought would be so great, now they don&rsquo;t even have the guts to stand up for themselves.

		<p>Never mind about the bigger issues of economic and social decline that are resulting from our demographic eclipse, lets focus on the rights of teenage Swedish and Norwegian girls to dress like tramps. Strange article.<br>
Being half Swedish and visiting often they have real problems and will only act if other nations lead first, the Norwegians are more likely to, their memories of German occupation mean there is plenty of fight left in them especially with an anti immigrant party well established.</p>

		<p>Europeans are now beginng to see what whites go through in America.  Most don&rsquo;t hate minorities by the way they look; we hate them because of the way they act. No one is forcing these people to live outside Africa or the Middle East.  They are always free to go but they would rather whine, bitch, complain and run to the welfare office minutes after they get off the boat.</p>

		<p>I met a swedish family on a cruise ship 2 years ago. They were the typical blond ayran upper class types. They were a very serious type of people and were completely indoctrinated in the liberal marxist superiority dogma even chiding me for the health system in the USA. I tried to gently talk sense to them but they were totally sure the other races are the same as us and sure all the socialistic nonsense is the only way to go. When the populace has been brainwashed as were these upper class swedes there is not much hope for thier nation until its too late, and even then I am not sure they would change thier mind. I think most of Europe is in this mindset and in 100 years or so, maybee less, europe will be nothing but a brown skinned image of the greatness it once was. We are just a little further behind. kingfish</p>

		<p>Although its unnecessary, I can at least understand why most British-derived Whites would feel guilty for enslaving &amp; holocausting hunter-gatherer tribes BUT what on earth do Scandinavians have to feel guilty about?! Nothing! Western Science killed Germanic Spirituality, Collectivism, Culture &amp; pride. You Germanics killed 80 000 000 Slavs &amp; Balts in 1000 years but your self-destruction sickens my soul.

		<p> Norway and Sweden are very open friendly societies. I&rsquo;m not surprised that they have been duped by multiculturalism. Many in our own country, who should have known better, are equally duped. There is still time to turn things around in their countries. Our time here in America is rapidly running out, particularly if &ldquo;comprehensive immigration review&rdquo; is passed.</p>

<p>I hear you and agree with the sentiments. But the white children suffering because of multiculturalism, black racism and immigration were not the ones who spoke out against South Africa. Moreover, it was the elites of these nations - not the working classes who must now live with racism - who pushed the anti-white agenda. If the sons/daughters of the elites who supported the blacks in SA were now paying the price I would certainly rejoice. But they have enough money to avoid the immigrants, thier dysfunctional culture and their racism. Same as in the U.S.</p>

<p>I hear you, those without the political elites power shouldn&rsquo;t be blamed for the elites decisions, especially children like the girl in the article. At least now they know what it feels like. However, as you say, it would be better if the elites were the ones feeling the pain of their decisions, not normal folk.</p>

<p>Myrda had it wrong. It should be:</p>
<p>&#8216;Negro standards cause whites to form negative opinions about Negros&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If blacks behaved and performed exactly like whites, I could see myself not seeing any other difference than the color of skin.</p>
<p>This is not the case. Race clearly influences behavior. Blacks behave as they do because of their race. When we see the behavior we see the race.</p>
<p>When blacks stop acting black I&rsquo;ll stop seeing them as black. But can a leopard change his spots?<br>

		<p>&#8220;Never mind about the bigger issues of economic and social decline that are resulting from our demographic eclipse, lets focus on the rights of teenage Swedish and Norwegian girls to dress like tramps. Strange article&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, Swedish and Norwegian girls have the right to dress how they want in their society. These foreigners don&rsquo;t have the right to come over here and dictate to them. Also, I agree with &#8220;White South African&#8221; and others. When my father was in Scandinavia back in the 60&rsquo;s, he used to get lectured on how &#8220;racist&#8221; Americans were and how &#8220;tolerant&#8221; Scandinavia was. Of course Scandinavia was 100% White then so very easy to be &#8220;tolerant&#8221;. They had no idea. Now they are learning.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is what happens when a western country is only Christian culturally.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nonsense, when they became Christians, their fate was sealed, as were all Europeans.  Christianity wants everyone, regardless of color or nationality.  There is nothing in the New Testament that calls on races to either identify themselves by race or make it exclusive, except for when it comes to Jews - and that is understood by scholars to be borne of historical competition early on, and then a cover for murder guilty Rome, that wanted to sell Christianity to Romans.</p>
<p>What you and many white, conservative Christians don&rsquo;t recognize that it is your earlier, pre-Christian tribal attitudes AND religion that causes you to constantly seek to insert racial identity into Christianity.  The Normans (who I am descended from) were the best fighters for Christianity, not because of their understanding of scripture (they couldn&rsquo;t read anyway), but their Viking roots, that the Church cleverly exploited in order to make wordly conquests and solidify their power, holdings, and wealth on earth.</p>
<p>The Swedes and Norwegians don&rsquo;t need Christianity in any form.  There is no &#8220;right&#8221; Christianity.  If our world was only full of Christians they would soon be at war over who was the real Christian church, just like they did for over fifteen hundred years. <br>

I think that is always so in the case of poor children who are thrown in with the lowest elements and left to survive, somehow.   It is a problem that the political and social &#8220;elites&#8221; in all western countries do not encounter or know anything about.  They assume  that they know what&rsquo;s best for YOU, you ignorant bigots. And you will just have to get used to it, because that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s going to be.  From their lofty standpoint, they wonder what these  cranky &#8220;rednecks&#8221; are complaining about!   Naturally, THEIR children (if they have any) do not go to such schools or travel through such neighborhoods.  But that&rsquo;s YOUR problem! And it&rsquo;s assumed to be YOUR fault.  <br>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>You are correct there.  Just look at the HORRIBLE masacres and persecutions over who was &#8220;more Christian&#8221; than someone else. The massacres of the Huguenots, the extermination of the Cathars, the Anabaptists,  etc&hellip;.. our history is not a pretty picture when you look at it objectively.</p>
<p>Many thousands of Saxons were executed (by Charlemagne) for refusing conversion to Christianity, after a 30-year war of conquest.  He is still known in German as the &#8220;Saxon-slaughterer&#8221;.   </p>
<p>At the time of the Reformation, the ENTIRE POPULATION of the Netherlands was placed under the death sentence by the Vatican. The Dutch only survived because they managed to hold off the Spanish armies with fantastic bravery, knowing they were doomed otherwise.  At one time, ALL English sailors, without exception, who were shipwrecked on the Spanish coast were put to death, on the automatic assumption that they were heretics. </p>
<p>When the St. Bartholemew&rsquo;s Day massacre of Protestants took place in France, with thousands of bodies floating in the rivers, the Pope declared public rejoicing!  When there was a question about who were the real Christians, during the Cathar suppression, Simon de Monfort declared:  &#8220;Kill them all!  Let God sort out his own.&#8221;  And so it was done. <br>
 <br>
Those are just a few examples. There are so many!  Need I go on?</p>

<p>Gunnar Myrdahl had it all wrong, of course. He thought that Caucasian prejudice was the SOLE REASON for the way in which blacks behaved. That is stupid. What would Myrdahl say about the observations of Herodotus, Arab travelers, missionaries and others who remarked on the sexual behavior and practices of blacks on their mother continent? What would he say about the behaviors of  Mike Tyson, O.J. Simpson, Rae Carruth, Michael Vick, and Reggie White, all of who were paid millions of dollars by a &#8220;racist&#8221; society, and still messed up?

<p>St. Olav was the first, and last ORTHODOX Christian ruler the Norse ever had. Pray to him for that, sir!</p>
<p>On that front, Whiteplight is either inadvertently lying, or is merely propagandized against True Christianity, when he says: &#8220;Nonsense, when they became Christians, their fate was sealed, as were all Europeans. Christianity wants everyone, regardless of color or nationality. There is nothing in the New Testament that calls on races to either identify themselves by race or make it exclusive, except for when it comes to Jews - and that is understood by scholars to be borne of historical competition early on, and then a cover for murder guilty Rome, that wanted to sell Christianity to Romans.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have written extensively that it was due to the Filioque, the &#8216;&hellip;.and the Son&rsquo; which was illegally inserted in the Nicene Creed, that caused the Church of Rome a) to go into Schism in 1054, b) to start forming the dual errors of c) universal jurisdiction and d) Papal rule. Those two things are UNIQUE to Rome, and not at all present in the Eastern, or Orthodox faith. </p>
<p>Moreover, the &#8216;inhabited world&rsquo; as the early Church knew it, was called the &#8216;Ecumene&rsquo; - which meant the Roman Empire. And, as any sane individual knows, the Roman Empire encompassed only those lands historically ruled/occupied by CAUCASIANS. </p>
<p>Thus, the older (the REAL) Christianity is still, and will forever, remain &#8216;the White Man&rsquo;s religion.&rsquo; It is only the errors of post-Schism Rome that have led to Multiculturalism, the Enlightenment, Darwin, Evolution, and the desire to be &#8216;inclusive&rsquo; - whether one is a Protestant, or Roman, as both have adopted that earlier &#8216;filioquism&rsquo; as theological philosophical paradigm.</p>
<p>True Christianity is both ethnically exclusive to Whites, as well as Geographically exclusive to Europe. The latter is well-known to Islam, the former has been forgotten by us&hellip;. but not by other claimants to the moniker, &#8216;Chosen People.&rsquo; That that thought is denied by Scripture, [Rev. 2:8,9] don&rsquo;t make it right, either! </p>
