<h1><a href="/features/19961104rushton.html">Statement on Race as a Biological Concept</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>J. Philippe Rushton, amren.com, November 4, 1996</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<blockquote><i>In 1996 Professor Phillippe Rushton of the University of Western Ontario released the following statement on race in response to attempts to discredit the very concept of race and to argue that race &#8220;has no validity as a biological concept when applied to man.&#8221; We are pleased once again to make a copy of this important statement available to our readers.</i>
</blockquote>Discussion of &#8220;race&#8221; shows little sign of diminishing, despite efforts to deconstruct the concept. Deconstructing the concept of race not only conflicts with people&rsquo;s tendency to classify and build family histories according to common descent but also ignores the work of biologists studying non-human species. Ever since 1758, when the Swedish naturalist Carolus Linnaeus created the classification system still used in biology today, most zoologists have recognized at least the four human subdivisions Linnaeus delineated: Asians, American Indians, Europeans, and Africans. (Technically, some would group the first two Linnaean subdivisions together, thus yielding three major races, often termed, mongoloids, caucasoids, and negroids.) Such high-level classifications do not rule out making finer, hierarchical subdivisions within these major groups.
<p>A race is what zoologists term a variety or subdivision of a species. Each race (or variety) is characterized by a more or less distinct combination of inherited morphological, behavioral, physiological traits. In flowers, insects, and non-human mammals, zoologists consistently and routinely study the process of racial differentiation. Formation of a new race takes place when, over several generations, individuals in one group reproduce more frequently among themselves than they do with individuals in other groups. This process is most apparent when the individuals live in diverse geographic areas and therefore evolve unique, recognizable adaptations (such as skin color) that are advantageous in their specific environments. But differentiation also occurs under less extreme circumstances. Zoologists and evolutionists refer to such differentiated populations as races. (Within the formal taxonomic nomenclature of biology, races are termed subspecies). Zoologists have identified two or more races (subspecies) in most mammalian species.</p>
<p>Unless one is a religious fundamentalist and believes that man was created in the image and likeness of God, it is foolish to believe that human beings are exempt from biological classification and the laws of evolution that apply to all other life forms. Of course, individuals vary greatly within each racial group and should be treated as such. Nonetheless, much has been learned by studying the statistical differences between the various human races. In my book <a href="https://store.amren.com/cart.php?target=category&amp;category_id=95" target="REB" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>Race, Evolution, and Behavior</b></a> (1995, Transaction Publishers), as well as in other recent writings (e.g., the February 1996 issue of <cite>Current Anthropology</cite>), I review the behavioral, morphological, and physiological differences between the three major human races  &mdash;  mongoloid, caucasoid, and negroid  &mdash;  and show that these statistical differences are constant across both historical time, national boundaries, and political and economic systems.</p>
<p>Here I will briefly summarize the findings. Asians and Africans consistently aggregate at opposite ends, with Europeans intermediate, on a continuum that includes over 60 anatomical and social variables. These 60 variables include brain size, intelligence, sexual habits, fertility, personality, temperament, speed of maturation, and longevity. If race were an arbitrary, socially-constructed concept, devoid of all biological meaning, such consistent relationships would not exist.</p>
<p>Those objecting to the concept of race argue that the taxonomic definitions are arbitrary and subjective. Although critics are correct to point out that the variation within each race is extremely large, that there is disagreement as to exactly how many races there are, and that there is a blurring of category edges because of admixture, they are in error when they claim that classifications are arbitrary. For example, race-critic Jared Diamond, in the 1994 issue of <cite>Discover</cite> magazine, surveyed half a dozen geographically variable traits and formed very different races depending on which traits he picked. Classifying people using anti-malarial genes, lactose tolerance, fingerprint patterns, or skin color resulted in the Swedes of Europe being placed in the same category as the Xhosa and Fulani of Africa, the Ainu of Japan, and the Italians of Europe.</p>
<p>Jared Diamond&rsquo;s classifications, however, are arbitrary and nonsensical because they have little, if any, predictive value beyond the initial classification. More significantly, they confuse the scientific meaning of race, that is, a recognizable (or distinguishable) geographic population. In everyday life, as in evolutionary biology, a &#8220;negroid&#8221; is someone whose ancestors were born in sub-Saharan Africa, and likewise for a &#8220;caucasoid&#8221; and a &#8220;mongoloid.&#8221; This definition fits with the temporal bounds offered by the best current theory of human evolution. Thus, since Homo sapiens first appeared in Africa about 200,000 years ago, branched off into Europe about 110,000 years ago, and into Asia 70,000 years after that, a &#8220;negroid&#8221; is someone whose ancestors, between 4,000 and (to accommodate recent migrations) 20 generations ago, were born in sub-Saharan Africa  &mdash;  and likewise, for a caucasoid and a mongoloid.</p>
<p>Social definitions  &mdash;  that is, self-identification and other-identification actually accord quite well with the physical evidence. Mongoloids, caucasoids, and negroids can be distinguished on the basis of obvious differences in skeletal morphology, hair and facial features, as well by blood groups and DNA fingerprints. Forensic anthropologists regularly classify skeletons of decomposed bodies by race. For example, narrow nasal passages and a short distance between eye sockets identify a caucasoid person, distinct cheekbones characterize a mongoloid person, and nasal openings shaped like an upside down heart typify a negroid person. In certain criminal investigations, the race of a perpetrator can be identified from blood, semen, and hair samples. To deny the predictive validity of race at this level is nonscientific and unrealistic.</p>
<p>The mean pattern of educational and economic achievement within multi-racial countries such as Canada and the United States has increasingly been found to prove valid internationally. For example, it is not often recognized, perhaps because it contradicts the politically correct theories that intelligence is purely a matter of socio-economic conditions, that Asian-Americans and Asians in Asia often outscore white Americans and white Europeans on IQ tests and on tests of educational achievement (even though the tests were largely developed by Europeans and white Americans for use in a Euro-American culture). Blacks in the Caribbean, Britain, Canada and sub-Saharan Africa as well as in the United States have low IQ scores relative to whites. For violent crime, analyses of INTERPOL data from the 1980s and 1990s show the same international distribution that occurs within the United States (that is, Asians least, Europeans in the middle, and Africans most). A similar racial gradient is found both within the U.S. and globally for measures of sexual activity and frequencies of sexually transmitted diseases such as AIDS (based on World Health Organization data).</p>
<p>One neurohormonal contributor to crime and reproductive behavior is testosterone. Studies show that black college students and military veterans have three percent to 19 percent more testosterone than their white counterparts. The Japanese have even lower amounts than whites. Sex hormones are circulated throughout the body and are known to activate many brain-behavior systems involving aggression and reproduction. For example, around the world the rate of dizygotic twinning per 1,000 births (caused by a double ovulation), is less than four among Asians, eight among Europeans, and 16 or greater among Africans. The differences in multiple birthing are known to be heritable through the race of the mother regardless of the race of the father, as found in Asian/European matings in Hawaii and European/African matings in Brazil.</p>
<p>Publication of <cite>The Bell Curve</cite> brought widespread public attention to the research on race that has been accumulating over the last 30 years in technical and specialist journals that demonstrably challenges each and every article of the dogma of biological egalitarianism. Startling, and alarming to many, is the conclusion that follows from these data that if all people were treated the same, most average race differences would not disappear. With egalitarianism under siege, there has been a major effort to get the &#8220;race genie&#8221; back in the bottle, to squeeze the previously tabooed toothpaste back into the tube, to suppress or deny the latest scientific evidence on race, genetics, and behavior.</p>
<p>Regardless of the extent to which the media promote &#8220;politically correct,&#8221; but scientifically wrong, resolutions from professional societies such as the American Anthropological Association, facts remain facts and require appropriate scientific, not political, explanation. On average, the Chinese, Koreans, and Japanese are more similar to each other and are different from Australians, Israelis and the Swedes, who in turn are similar to each other and are different from Nigerians, Kenyans, and Jamaicans. None of this should be construed as meaning that environmental factors play no part individual development. But with each passing year and each new study, the evidence for the genetic contribution to individual and group differences becomes more firmly established than ever.</p>

70&rsquo;s,  Oxford University&rsquo;s renowed John Randall Baker&rsquo;s magnum<br>
opus (reviewed back in the 90&rsquo;s in AR ) RACE deserves acknowledgement in any discussion of the contemporary verbal engineering of race as non-existent.  The book, if dated, is the logical starting place  for the fullest exposure of the verbal-intellectual mirage that race does not exist.  </p>

		<p>Several years ago, a friend gave me some discarded books.  A small version of Rushton&rsquo;s Race, Evolution, and Behavior was among them.  Before I read this book, I held a leftist view of racial differences, and the indisputable facts within this tiny volume actually turned my thinking completely around!  For years, I had been trying to deny the evidence presented before my eyes, but mathematical statistics do not lie.  </p>

		<p>A very informative article. I&rsquo;m glad an increasing number of scientists have &#8220;come out of the closet&#8221; lately, when it comes to views on racial differences.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleasantly surprised that a group as distinguished as the Guggenheim society would allow a person who says things like this to be a member of their society. Also good to hear he&rsquo;s been able to retain his job as a psychology professor at a state university (must have tenure or something. The bias in the academic world leads me to suspect its very difficult for someone with divergent and &#8220;dangerous&#8221; views to be accepted in academic circles).</p>

		<p>Race has been proven to have a biological variable basis.   There are drugs that work better on one race than another.  Of course, those statistics are buried due to &#8220;political correctness&#8221; and the (misguided and dead WRONG) belief that all races are biologically equivalent.<br>
All one has to do is look at how the so-called &#8220;equal housing&#8221; race-baiters have difficulty when performing their telephone-based search for &#8220;racist&#8221; landlords and real estate agents.  It is easy to tell (sight unseen) whether someone is black or white by speech alone.</p>

<p>What white nationalists never mention, is that it is white people who lead efforts to deny that racial differences exist. Blacks, Hispanics and Asian-Americans, do not have the power and influence in American academia to suppress discussion on racial differences, even if they wanted to do so. Denial of racial differences in behavior is more of a &#8220;white thing&#8221;, rather than a minority thing. Racial minorities in America discuss racial differences all the time, within their own communities. White nationalists are quite happy to talk about racial differences, so long as the subject under discussion is white virtues and accomplishments. But they are reluctant to talk about racial differences, if the subject under discussion is white vices. The genetic basis of both white virtues and white vices (as well as the virtues and vices of all other races), should be discussed.</p>
<p>Some of you have probably never heard of Michael Bradley, who, like Phil Rushton, is a white Canadian scholar who specializes in racial differences. He is a left-wing version of Prof. Rushton. Bradley&rsquo;s best known book is &#8220;The Iceman&rsquo;s Inheritance&#8221;, which focuses on how evolving in the ice age shaped the behavioral characteristics of white people. In the late 1970s, Bradley became the first scholar to propose that white people carry Neanderthal genes, which was confirmed over thirty years later by the scholarly journal, &#8220;Science&#8221;. https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100506/ap_on_sc/us_sci_neanderthal_genes  </p>
<p><br>
Unlike Phil Rushton, Bradley focuses on negative aspects of white behavior, that are the product of their evolutionary development in cold climates. As a result, Bradley has endured far more persecution than Phil Rushton. White nationalists should not be afraid to discuss negative aspects of white behavior, because it is in their own racial interests to do so. Such a discussion may solve the mystery of why so many white American men are marrying East Asian women, despite the fact that all people agree that white women are more beautiful. It may also explain why so many whites dislike the behavioral characteristics of their own race, despite the great technological achievements whites have made, which surpass those of other races. </p>

		<p>J. Phillipe Rushton is RIGHT!!!  I read every single word of his book (the complete one, not the abridged version) - and I am proud to have it on one of my library shelves.  There seems to be a small movement towards telling the truth these days, and it is my hope that Rushton&rsquo;s work will receive new attention in the light of this truth.  For far too long people have attempted to crush the truth just because they don&rsquo;t like it.  Well, opinions are like noses - everybody&rsquo;s got one, and some expel more hot air than others.  It&rsquo;s about time Dr. Rushton&rsquo;s work is read by people who aren&rsquo;t afraid of the truth.  THEN try to stamp it out!  It&rsquo;s not gonna happen.  We&rsquo;ve already been there.</p>

		<p>Science Daily: Whites have lowest instance of MAOA-L Gene, which is linked to aggression, violence, crime, and sexual abuse.</p>
<p>American black males in the are twice as likely than American White males to have MAOA-L which has been linked to crime, violence and aggression in scores of studies going back over fifteen years. Black males are also 13.5 times more likely to have a rare version of the gene associated with &ldquo;extreme violence and extreme aggression.&rdquo; Latinos and American Indians are also nearly twice as likely as whites to have the more common version of the gene. However they are only about one fourth as likely to have the extreme version compared to blacks.</p>
<p>New scientific techniques have brought to light exactly how the so-called &ldquo;warrior gene&rdquo; named MAOA-L works. New studies using MRI show how brain activity in those who have the MAOA-L gene differs from those without it.</p>
<p>Studies have linked the gene to increased levels of sexual violence, alcoholism, crime, and even higher levels of credit card debt. However, very little is said about it outside of scientific journals. The reason is obvious. Many articles published on the gene even state that it has serious implications concerning race and ethnicity.</p>
<p>Whites, usually referred to in euphemisms like &ldquo;westerners,&rdquo; are said to be less likely to have the gene than other groups. One third of whites have MAOA-L, while groups usually only identified as &ldquo;others&rdquo; have instances of two thirds or higher. It has also been suggested in scientific journals that whites may be less affected by the gene than &ldquo;others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In fact, researchers have even censored their own findings on race and MAOA-L! Others have faced hostility from the University community for mentioning which races have the highest rates. Source.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, is even less is said about some of the even rarer extreme forms of the gene. Most people with MAOA-L have the &ldquo;3 allele repeat version.&rdquo; There is a rarer &ldquo;2 allele repeat version&rdquo; that is usually described as &ldquo;associated with extreme aggression and extreme violence.&rdquo; Several studies have concluded that 1% or less of all white males in the United States posses the dangerous 2 allele repeat version. Meanwhile a study of &ldquo;non-white Americans&rdquo; showed that the extra dangerous version occurred in 6% of non-white American men. One lone study from 2006 tested tested blacks alone and found that 13.5% have the extra dangerous version of the gene. Source.</p>
<p>MAOA-L, which causes low activity of the metabolizing enzyme monoamine oxidase A, is spoken of in euphemisms when it comes to ethnicity. However, already it has been used in court cases in the US, Britain, and Italy. In Italy lawyers claimed an Algerian immigrant should get a lighter sentence for stabbing a Columbian immigrant to death, because his DNA contains the MAOA-L gene. The judge agreed and reduced the defendants sentence. Source.</p>
<p>Already, we have leftists college professors making declarations like &ldquo;if African Americans have higher rates of MAOA-L, than that should be a factor in sentencing!&rdquo; The hypocrisy of these leftists is deafening. On one hand they will say that the &ldquo;races are all equal,&rdquo; then demand special treatment for blacks for a &ldquo;genetic deficiency&rdquo; in the same breath.</p>

		<p>Forensic anthroplogy is a misfit fact of life within the campus mantra that &#8220;race does not exist&#8221;.  It is yet of intense practical importance that a few skeletal remains can often permit criminal investigators to extrapolate with high reliability as to the race, age, gender of the victim.  </p>

		<p>A concept or not a concept&hellip; what difference does it make. The REALITY is there are differences between the races. Differences beyond skin tone and physical appearance. The Caucasian people (White Europeans) are who made our modern civilization what it is. With virtually little or no help from darker races.</p>
<p>If there were no difference between the average intelligence of the races, ALL races would have progressed nearly equally through the past few thousand years. That they did not shoots the liberal promulgated nonsense of racial equality full of holes. Whites led the intelligence race; Blacks lagging very far in the rear; coming in dead last vis-a-vis other racial groups.</p>

<p>I find it interesting that this is called the &#8220;warrior gene.&#8221;  Traditionally, black &#8220;warriors&#8221; (e.g. in the former Rhodesia) fare the best against unarmed noncombatants, rarely against other races&rsquo; fighters.  The most successful &#8220;warriors&#8221; in history have been either of European or Asian extraction, which probably possesses low levels of this particular gene.  Inchoate violent tendencies, lack of impulse control and sexual aggressiveness, do not a &#8220;warrior&#8221; make.</p>

<p>If you look a little closer into the issue, you will discover that it is NOT White people who &#8216;lead efforts to deny that racial differences exist.&rsquo;  Our culture, academic institutions, government and media have been hijacked by those who do not consider themselves White and who in fact wish for our demise.</p>

<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/oh4w3x" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/oh4w3x</a></p>
<p>And you write:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;White nationalists should not be afraid to discuss negative aspects of white behavior, because it is in their own racial interests to do so&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Why are you concerned with this issue?  Why are we White Nationalists of any interest to you?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no need to discuss anything about &#8216;negative aspects of White behavior&rsquo; as it is thrown into our White faces every single day via the media, academia, intelligentsia and government.  We are subjected to withering criticism, scorn and mockery  &mdash;  along with overt, blatant, anti-White discrimination. </p>
<p>Yet, if we Whites deign to complain about huge, disproportionate rates of black crime or unfettered Third World hispanic immigration that is displacing us, destroying our schools and neighborhoods and driving our taxes into the stratosphere, we are called Racist Nazis.</p>
<p>Have you watched American TV lately?  Whites are presented as buffoons, fools and violent, racist idiots in need of the &#8216;wise counsel&rsquo; or &#8216;straightening out&rsquo; of non-Whites.  From the looks of crime &#8216;drama&rsquo; shows such as CSI, you&rsquo;d think there is a White crime wave in New York!</p>
<p>The anti-White, alien government has its boot on our necks.  That this is true is easily provable and not in dispute.</p>
<p>And finally:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; Such a discussion may solve the mystery of why so many white American men are marrying East Asian women&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Not True.</p>
<p>You have a lot to learn about Whites. You seem to think you know a lot about us but you do not.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Interracial and inter-ethnic marriages began to increase in the 1970s and continued to grow through the 1980s..But the rate of intermarriages began declining in the 1990s– particularly those involving Whites and Asian Americans or Hispanics&hellip;In the U.S., according to the Census Bureau, about 97% of married non-Hispanic Whites in the U.S. are married to other non-Hispanic Whites&hellip;&#8221;</p>
