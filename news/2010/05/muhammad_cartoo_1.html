<h1><a href="https://my.att.net/s/editorial.dll?eeid=7301128&amp;eetype=article&amp;render=y&amp;ck">Muhammad Cartoonist in Hiding After Arson Attack</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Malin Rising, AT&T; News, May 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Swedish artist whose drawing of the Prophet Muhammad with a dogs body angered Muslims said Sunday he doesn&rsquo;t feel safe in his home at night, after a week of attacks against him.</p>
<p>Lars Vilks told The Associated Press he has started sleeping elsewhere since an attempted arson attack Friday against his home in Nyhamnslage, southern Sweden.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;During the day I don&rsquo;t think it is dangerous because I can keep watch over myself,&#8221; Vilks said. &#8220;But I have to realize that I can&rsquo;t be there during the night.&#8221;</p>
<p>The artist has faced numerous threats over his 2007 sketch. Earlier this year, U.S. investigators said Vilks was the target of an alleged murder plot involving Colleen LaRose, an American woman who dubbed herself &#8220;Jihad Jane,&#8221; and who now faces life in prison. She has pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>Swedish police arrested a 21-year-old man late Saturday and a 19-year-old man on Sunday on suspcion of the attempted arson attack. Earlier Saturday, they had found bottles filled with gasoline and minor fire damage to Vilks&rsquo; home. Several windows at the artist&rsquo;s house had also been smashed. Vilks was not home during the attack.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>How sickening.</p>
<p>Muslims are a fairly small percentage and still do not hesitate to threaten, intimidate and attack whites in a majority white country.</p>
<p>Can any Amren&rsquo;ers name one majority non-white country that would tolerate anything remotely close to this?</p>
<p>Whites on this planet are doomed.</p>

        Clouds Across the Sky</p>
<p><br>
Where the air is cool and free<br>
In a nordic forest just maybe<br>
Among the flowers with a fine lady<br>
Is only where I want to be</p>
<p><br>
Clouds across the sky so white<br>
Day will surely come with light<br>
And from the shadows of the night<br>
We&rsquo;ll gaze upon the truth so bright</p>
<p><br>
Wondrous things there may we see<br>
Well hid from those no longer free<br>
Eternally so shall it be<br>
In times forever mystery &hellip;</p>

		<p>Muslims have a very simplistic view of the world. </p>
<p>They believe in murdering everyone who offends or disagrees with them. </p>
<p>Muslims will eventually be driven out of the West at gunpoint and those who refuse to leave will be martyred&hellip; </p>

		<p>This article brings a forum to which I can address a concern that is distressing to me. Having long ago lost any trust in the mainstream news media I looked to FOX news as a relatively objective source of information. I was okay with different points view as I am a supporter of debate. However, having learned some Saudi prince or some type of Arab entity holds a ten percent interest in Murdoch&rsquo;s NewsCorp which owns FOX news, my trust factor of FOX news has gone down considerably.<br>
 <br>
Every time I read something or see something on television about Muslims committing violent acts, they are described as radical Muslims. Having read the Koran, anyone with an iota of intelligence would understand that these &ldquo;extremists&rdquo; are following the teachings of Mohamed. While they may be described in the news media as whackos and nut jobs, in other circles they are holy warriors. They are the tip of the spear of Islam pointed at the heart of Western Civilization. To think otherwise is to be clueless. <br>

The two young men arrested, brothers, are Swedish citizens, &#8220;originally from Kosovo&#8221;.</p>
<p>Thisincident  follows the beating of an elderly Swedish couple  in a parking lot. One of them, the wife, 78, has died after coming to the aid of her husband, who was being attacked.<br>

<p>(Landskrona, btw, lies across from Denmark, in the extreme south of Sweden. Because of its large Kosovo pupolation, it is known as the &#8220;Albanian capital of Sweden&#8221;.) <a href="https://gatesofvienna.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">https://gatesofvienna.blogspot.com/</a></p>

<p><b>Muslim community fears violence after attack on elderly couple&hellip;</b><br>
Four Islamic and Arab associations called for a press conference in order to calm the unrest in Landskrona after the fatal beating of Inger, 78.  Though the associations call it an accident, the police classify it as a murder.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are deeply shocked and saddened and can hardly believe that this tragedy happened,&#8221; said Othman Tawalbeh of the Muslim Association.</p>
<p>In his speech he protested against the &#8220;we and them&#8221; attitude spreading in society.</p>
<p>&#8220;Violence has no ethnicity, it has no religion,&#8221; he said in response to the online hate-campaign against the suspect, who is of immigrant background.</p>
<p>&#8220;His family have been threatened. He is convicted in advance.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;The family says they&rsquo;ve received death threats after the suspect&rsquo;s identity was published online, and one of the brothers said he doesn&rsquo;t dare let his children go to school. The suspect&rsquo;s wife got a call from someone saying they&rsquo;ll kill her children.  The 36 year old brother said his wife and children have left Landskrona. They can&rsquo;t sleep but are terrified and do not feel good at all. They see all the police who came in to the apartment to arrest their father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;According to the suspect&rsquo;s lawyer, the suspect denies everything. His lawyer also said that the suspect was threatened by phone and by internet, that those threats have racist characteristics and that he&rsquo;s taken it up the issue of his protection with the police.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Police detective Tommy Lindén says that the family is safe in Landskorna and that, from his experience, they&rsquo;re playing the victim card in order to give them a better negotiating position.&#8221; <br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>
There have been Moslem protests in nearby Helsingborg. (One of the brothers was arrested in Helsingborg, which is another center of Moslem settlement.)</p>
<p>Interestingly, for whatever it&rsquo;s worth,  there is at this moment a huge fire raging in a printing plant in Helsingborg, caused by an explosion of unknown origin.<br>

		<p>The men being from Kosovo is interesting, because usually the refugees from Kosovo have been regarded as being secularized, since that&rsquo;s how things were in Kosovo before the war. The hardships revived Islam in the region, and supposedly there&rsquo;s now a cultural rift between those who fled and those who stayed. Looks like they&rsquo;re bridging that gap, one arson at a time.</p>

		<p>ATBOTL, A ten percent interest in a corporation gives you a place at the table. I do not believe the Saudis should be sitting at our table. Their investment in building Wahabi based mosques in the United States is a relatively small amount of money yet I do not care to see this seed planted. </p>
