<h1>Asian Majority a College Crisis?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Charlie Butts, OneNewsNow (Family News Network), May 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The various school campuses around the Golden State show representation of Asians ranging between 40 and 54 percent of the total number of students while only representing 13 to 14 percent of California&rsquo;s population. So the question is whether standards for admissions ought to be lowered in favor of non-Asians to create more of a balance in the schools&rsquo; student makeup.</p>
<p>Ward Connerly, founder of the American Civil Rights Institute (ACRI), explains that some administrators say there are just too many Asians and believe that &#8220;the only way to curtail that is to raise the standards on Asians and to apply a different standard to them than we apply to  &mdash;  quote  &mdash;  &#8216;underrepresented minorities&rsquo; who are black, Native American and Hispanic.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The ACRI founder goes on to explain that he sees no problem with the Asian student population, but when he asked a UC administrator what was wrong with the school being dominated by Asians, he was told that they are &#8220;too dull  &mdash;  they study, study, study.&#8221;</p>
<p>Connerly suggests that while administrators are considering &#8220;discrimination&#8221; against Asians, they should be wondering whether those students will rise up against the proposal.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a little surprised to hear such a comment coming from Ward Connerly, who&rsquo;s always seemed to me to be a rather reasonable activist for civil rights.</p>
<p>Of course, Asians are crowding out Caucasians as well, and in so doing are making it that much harder for blacks and Hispanics.  In a word, tough.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hear anybody complaining that Asians are underrepresented in professional sports in this country, or in the performing arts.  Unfortunately for less energetic people, Asians are smart, focused, and they work harder than most others.  A society that tries to handicap its most talented and hardest workers in favor of the less talented and motivated is heading for a diminished quality of life for all its citizens.</p>

		<p> Could it be that the Asian students just tend to be   &mdash;   well, SMARTER, than those of other races? Oh, bite your tongue, you racist bigot!</p>
<p> At least on a campus where the smartest and hardest-working are allowed to rise to the top, there won&rsquo;t be any danger of &#8220;too many&#8221; blacks, will there? Except on the basketball team, of course.</p>
<p> Interesting how these top-lofty college administrators can talk of &#8220;too many Asians&#8221; in the classroom when they wouldn&rsquo;t dare say that about blacks in athletics. &#8220;Study, study, study&#8221; apparently is frowned upon, while &#8220;party, party, party&#8221; and &#8220;miscegenate, miscegenate, miscegenate&#8221; are not. </p>

Not being Asian, we have no obligation to care for their welfare.</p>
<p>But we do applaud any efforts that discriminate against their achievement for the benefit of blacks and other low performing non whites.</p>
<p>Sends a good message to Whites that discrimination isn&rsquo;t by definition a bad thing, and they might want to try more of it themselves.</p>
<p>Whites need to readily acknowledge that Diversity is racial profiling, therefore, and to take a page from the Progressive Marxist playbook, some kinds of racial profiling are desirable.</p>
<p>Whites need to wake up and start making decisions for themselves what forms of desirable racial profiling they will support and encourage and perform.  </p>
<p>When a White racially profiles, it should always be in favor of other Whites, as long as they are one of us.  Racial profiling against liberal race traitor Whites is permissible.  Forms of this desirable racial profiling would be enforcing protocols that prevent liberal Whites form living in White neighborhoods or sending their kids to majority White private schools.</p>
<p>If they aren&rsquo;t aware enough to teach their children Racial Reality, then let&rsquo;s force them to live around Racial Reality and let nature be their children&rsquo;s guide.</p>
<p>As the White Nurse who went to work at a non white hospital, &#8220;I wasn&rsquo;t a racist before I came to work here.&#8221;</p>
<p>We need the White Nurse Syndrome to spread like wildfire among the children of the race traitor Whites whom we keep out of our White neighborhoods and force into non white slums.<br>

		<p>Hm, silly me. I thought the purpose of being in college was to&hellip;.study.  Just saying.  </p>
<p>I got flak for the same thing (not Asian, rather Cherokee): students, many of them as white as rice, asked me why I was always studying. That was exactly my answer to them  &mdash;  -college is for STUDYING. I never drank back then either, it was all about the books and grades, as well as not disappointing my family. I&rsquo;m still studying now actually, taking courses at Yale while working two jobs. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t buy the the Asians are smarter than whites argument for one minute. A cursory review of my math, chemistry, physics, medical or any other textbook convinces me that WHITES are the smartest race of all. For example; how many of the formulas, theorems, and proofs in a modern math text did NOT come from WHITES? What about the same question for modern chemistry, physics, medical, etc textbook?</p>
<p>However, the importance of this post is not in regards to the debate over whether Whites or Asians are smarter. The importance is to note that as recently as the 1970 census, whites were close to 80% of Californias population (12% Hispanic, 7% Black, 3% Asian)! </p>
<p>California colleges and universities were filled with WHITES   &mdash;   and overwhelming so!</p>
<p>A mere 40 years later, Whites are barely 43%  (counting Arabs and Iranians as Whites no less) of California&rsquo;s population   &mdash;   and less than 30% of ALL California live births.</p>
<p>With this in mind, it should be mentioned that foreign immigration is by far the largest component of US Asian population growth   &mdash;   in contrast to the Hispanics for whom births are now the main population driver.</p>
<p>Thus, if we can just get immigration under control   &mdash;   we might just have a chance at securing the survival of our people in our land!</p>
<p>California is the canary in the coal mine. Either Whites WAKE UP   &mdash;   or soon the continent our forefathers conquered will be wrested from us and we will face the same fate as the Whites of South Africa.</p>

		<p>This is the inherent problem with multiculturalism - achievement rates aren&rsquo;t universal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a board game.  Everyone starts with the same number of pieces.  As the game progresses, the more gifted or aggressive win the greatest rewards, and the gap widens between them and the losers.  </p>
<p>Multiracialism is theoretical communism.  In order for it to work as it was meant to, the gifted races must hold themselves back, or be held back to the lowest denominator by a totalitarian dictatorship using &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo; and &#8216;equality&rsquo; laws.</p>

		<p>Notice white Californian students, whose parents and their parents and so on helped to build and support those universities through taxes and donations, aren&rsquo;t mentioned at all.  You must never help whites, ever.  If there are too many asians, it just means that there are not enough &#8220;underrepresented minorities&#8221;.  Asians would grumble amongst themselves if they are held to a higher standard in favor of blacks and latinos, but they would absolutely scream if whites would benefit from it also.  </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think Asians are smarter.  For one thing, Asians takes in an awful lot of groups and they are not all on the same level.  The explanation I have heard that makes complete sense is that what they have is excellent memory and recall.  That is from the nature of Chinese and Japanese, any language that uses characters.  They must be learned in a rote manner.  This creates memory and recall talent and after three generations it becomes imprinted genetically via the epigenetic model.</p>
<p>I have a young Vietnamese woman in my class.  I tried to engage her in a thoughtful discussion about the Vietnam War.  She claims that she knows nothing about it.  I have heard that the young people in Vietnam are taught nothing about it, and I also know that we have at least some who came over in 1975 who hate communist Vietnam, much like Cubans hate Castro&rsquo;s Cuba.  But I will never know, she just kindly stonewalled me.  And that is the problem with Asians.  They can be full of hate and resentment, but they will smile at you and act as if they are quite happpy.  But all the while they have a plan and if that plan is not good for you, they won&rsquo;t tell you.  Nor will they feel a bit of remorse if you die.  They are used to death and they know how to survive better than whites.  Maybe that is where whites are not so intelligent.</p>

		<p>The Chinese have been migrating beyond their borders for as long as we have.  For example, they&rsquo;ve been migrating to Malaysia since the fifteenth century, and many migrated further within the British empire.</p>
<p>When Asians are able to out-pace the indigenous populations of the countries they&rsquo;ve settled in, they naturally form a well-educated professional and entreprenurial class (as they&rsquo;ve done in parts of Africa and South Asia). </p>
<p>What will the Asian professional class think of whites and how will they treat them?  </p>
<p>They will attempt to intermarry with whites of social status, and generally be contemptuous of whites of low social status. In other words, their influence will racially weaken whites through miscegenation, and drive us apart from ourselves based on class.</p>

		<p>I learned some time ago that Silicon Valley is full of Asians and a white hasn&rsquo;t got a chance at being hired at nearly every company as they are dominated by Asians and hardly anyone in management even speaks English.  Asians will be the masters in California.  Hispanics will be the slaves.  Whites and blacks will cancel each other out.</p>

		<p>One thing to remember is graduating from the best colleges&gt;best paying jobs/careers&gt;power. I see in NYC the best high school, Stuyvesant is not far from where I work and it is Asian dominated. I worry about Caucasian youth and their future. </p>
<p>Also remember Asians can qualify for AA and do sometimes. They also qualify for SBA loans and other government perks.</p>
<p>I know in a way its nice to see blacks and Latinos get &#8220;Diversifried&#8221; but no one is talking about empowering white, especially white Gentile youth. The book The Bell Curve was really a tome about how separate societies are forming in America. I have nothing against Asians, many are quite appealing but&hellip;and one thing I&rsquo;ve noticed is that whites are so competitive with other whites, we bring our own selves down.</p>

In this instance I think the debate about intelligence is a red herring.  From my personal I believe the Asian kids just study harder.  Go to any Barnes and Nobles or Borders and what will you see: a bunch of Asian kids studying.   </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see why this article is so amazing.  The more you study the better you are at school.  </p>
<p>What would be more interesting would be a follow up study and find out how often kids study.  I don&rsquo;t think its unreasonable to assume that there is VERY STRONG CORRELATION between time studying SAT scores and High School GPA.</p>
<p>Honestly I wonder why people look for the most obscure and arcane causality when the answer is sitting right in front of their faces.  </p>
<p>One reader mentioned something about empowering youth.  How about laying off the Play Station and X-Box and spending more time hitting the books?  People talk about the information era, perhaps we should go back to the information ERA V 1.0 and go back to reading books.  </p>

		<p>I have always felt that Asians were best at studying and improving upon inventions whereas whites were much more creative and better at thinking outside the box.  Americans (whites) invent new things and then the Japanese improve upon them.  Asians (Orientals) don&rsquo;t seem very creative but do seem very industrious.  Whites are not only more creative but also more adventurous.  Whites colonized the world at one point.  Whites started the space race and went to the moon.  Asians (Orientals) seem to be content with refining what already exists.  Two different kinds of intelligence that could be complimentary if managed properly.  South Asians (Indians/Pakistanis) really don&rsquo;t seem to be smarter, or more industrious, or more creative than whites or Orientals.  They seem to be &#8220;average&#8221;.</p>
<p>Hispanic culture is such a mish-mosh of races that they really don&rsquo;t seem classifiable as a group.  Euro-Hispanics act like whites.  Oriental-Hispanics (Chinese Cubans, for instance) seem to act like Orientals. A big problem with Amer-Indians and Mestizos is that they seem out of place in western society.  In their native villages they come across as quite pleasant but when set loose in a modern urban setting they just can not cope.  Their civilization is not our civilization.</p>
<p>Black Hispanics are just Spanish speaking blacks.</p>
<p>Asians may be civilized but whites still need to separate from them so that we can survive and thrive as distinct races.  My people have just as much right to survive as some toad!<br>

		<p>We are a White in a large suburban, upper-class neighborhood, which is almost all Chinese.  I talk and work with these people regularly and have for many years.  They are nice, quiet, and relatively average when it comes to smarts.  Few strike me as particularly smart at all   &mdash;   clever or intelligent on tests maybe, but not unusually smart.  They are not able to think very abstractly; they have trouble seeing &#8220;big picture.&#8221;   I have determined that the common belief of them being so much smarter than Whites is mostly media hype.  Nothing can replace the unique blend of intelligence and creativity of Europeans.  </p>

		<p>Many years ago Bill Moyers did an interview with a Chinese American science professor who had won a Nobel. They talked about the difference between his white and Chinese grad students at the American university where he was teaching. He said the Chinese got better grades but the whites were more innovative in their research projects. The whites just seemed to be more open-minded than the Chinese. Co-incidentally there was an article in the AmRen newsletter a few months ago about whites being more open-minded and how that plays a great role in civilization achievements along with average IQ.</p>
<p>Of course universities mostly accept students based on test grades, so higher innovation whites can&rsquo;t get past the initial acceptance stage. </p>

		<p>Maybe civil rights activists don&rsquo;t hate whites. They just hate anyone who&rsquo;s too smart and successful, which of course includes Asians. They&rsquo;re keeping the poor blacks and Hispanics down, liberlas think, and so they must be &#8220;positively discriminated&#8221; against, in order to balance things out. But then why doesn&rsquo;t anyone complain about the fact that blacks are over-represented in basketball and football? And hip-hop? And on the BET? What about the fact that Hispanics are over-represented in baseball and on Telemundo? In fact, aren&rsquo;t there too many Mexicans in Mexico? SoWeTo doesn&rsquo;t have enough Vietnamese! Its not nearly diverse enough, is it? But no, liberals don&rsquo;t ask these questions. They just care about inequality and homogeneity when its white people (and now Asians too, apparently) who dominate.</p>

		<p>From the original article:</p>
<p>Reports that that one of the reasons the number of Asian students exceeds that of other races is because they typically work harder and ultimately attain higher levels of achievement. Connerly contends that their work ethic should not create an issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;I subscribe to the view that Ronald Reagan had when he was governor of California, when this same circumstance presented itself at the University of California, namely – quote – &#8216;too many Asians.&rsquo; Ronald Reagan said, &#8216;I don&rsquo;t care if every seat is held by an Asian if they&rsquo;ve earned the right to be there.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>I think it is important to remind everyone that Connerly is one of the very few Minorities who opposes Affirmative Action.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if it makes Caucasians feel better, there should be a Special Action for Caucasians.  For example, adding several hundred points to any Caucasian college applicant, and once in school, the professors should keep separate grade books and bonus-up the grades where appropriate.  Sounds good?</p>
<p>Of course, one would need to deal with the problem of graduation and that first real job.  What do you think the prospective employer will do, if the employer knows that there is an artificial slanting of entrance requirements and grades?</p>
<p>The real paradox: Caucasians faired better when Affirmative Action was in effect because Affirmative Action created a ceiling above which Asians were not allowed.  Also, Affirmative Action gave preferential treatment to Caucasian females.</p>
<p>Well, the People got Affirmative Action removed from the University of California system, and now, the People must deal with the consequences.</p>
<p>Side Note: I have only officially lied once in my life, and that was on my application to the University of California.  I marked the box labeled &#8220;Other&#8221; and entered nothing in the blank beside the box.</p>

		<p>I agree with Poster 18. I grew up in a street where half the houses were owned by Asians, and was still at school when large numbers of Asians really starting coming over, and I really think this whole idea of Asians being incredibly smart is way overblown. They study hard - that&rsquo;s about it, really. Their parents push them to sit and study for endless hours. They don&rsquo;t have part-time jobs which might eat into their study time, and are fully financially dependent on their parents till after they graduate from college. They socialize much less than other races, and spend the majority of their afternoons and evenings at home studying (memorizing) or having piano lessons (when younger). For pure creativity, ingenuity, and overall abilitiy, Whites are still far and away the benchmark, of that I have absolutely no doubt. We&rsquo;ve just dropped the ball in some respects and need to start pushing ourselves a bit once more.</p>

		<p>While I don&rsquo;t condone their business practices whilst here in the US, I have to hand it to the Asians when it comes to studiousness, work ethic and academic discipline.</p>
<p>As a white man: do white people like it? No? Then work harder.</p>
<p>Time after time, Asians outscore whites on myriad academic tests. Whose to say, though, that whites aren&rsquo;t capable of the same things? Both political correctness and modern culture have instilled a sense of mediocrity in young white adults; it&rsquo;s no surprise that foreign Asians seem to outscore them in every way imaginable. </p>
<p>White people   &mdash;   Wake up! Are you to be subverted and therefore conquered in your own White nation? Truth be told, Asians have proven themselves outside of their own domain; it&rsquo;s up to whites to decide whether that&rsquo;s above their means or not. Considering the negligible difference in IQ, I&rsquo;d have to say that it comes down to work ethic and motivation rather than inherent genetic difference. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s up to you, white people, whether this is acceptable or not.</p>

		<p>Some of you are suggesting that Asians got special preferences to get into these universities, but you&rsquo;ve forgotten that affirmative action was outlawed in California, pushed through by the actions of Ward Connerly. When affirmative action was ended, Black and Hispanic enrollment plummeted and Asian enrollment rose. The plus side that even liberals agree with is that the Black and Hispanics that do go to college are less likely to flunk out now that they&rsquo;ve made it on their own merit instead of racial preference. I&rsquo;m not even sure how they could lower standards to get more NAMS into higher education as that would go against current California law.</p>

		<p>The real issue is here is Ward Connerly. He is the fundamental disgrace in this story. He shows his innate stupidity by complaining that Asians in college study too much. Therefore, they should face stiffer admissions criteria, which sounds like discrimination to me. Yet he&rsquo;s the first to yell discrimination when manifestly incompetent blacks are not admitted to first-rate academic programs - failing to see the irony. </p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say in some parallel universe Asians are placed on what amounts to a quota. Logically, whites should benefit since Asians and whites are essentially equal in intelligence and whites would be next in line to fill the open university seats. But Ward and his fellow knuckleheads seem to forget this - they want to skip the whites and give the extra seats to blacks - blacks with no hope of ever performing better than their genes allow. </p>
<p>Perhaps he feels the liberal white race traitors have already neutralized the white race as a whole so he doesn&rsquo;t have to worry about them.</p>
<p>In academia, the bottom line is performance and brainpower and abstract thinking. With the relatively minor difference in Asian and white test scores overall I can see factoring in creativity and thought patterns into admissions decisions where an Asian with a 3.9 GPA and a combined 1520 [M/V] SAT is perhaps passed over in favor of a creative, imaginative, more well-rounded white with a 3.8 GPA and a 1490 SAT. But not for a black with a 2.3 high school GPA and an SAT that was never taken who has a diploma from Malcolm X Prep on MLK Drive in Urban America, CA.</p>
<p>But to deny any American a reward for extra effort leading to achievement in academics and the promise of future contributions to society is beyond Orwellian. Especially when the &#8220;reasoning&#8221; behind it is that dysfunctional blacks have no other option left but to advertise their own failure in intellectual ability and a horribly stunted work ethic as the basis for enrollment over others far more deserving.</p>
<p>The issue is not too many Asians, or whites, but too many blacks.<br>

		<p>Asian&rsquo;s are the most discriminated group in America when it comes to education.  On average, Asians must score much higher than blacks and Hispanics, and slightly higher than White&rsquo;s to get into the best colleges and universities.  Especially at the graduate schools.  </p>
<p>Most Asian family&rsquo;s place a very high importance on the value of an education but not the entrepreneurial skills that White&rsquo;s excel in.  No matter how many Asian&rsquo;s go to college and get advanced degrees, most will end up working for or being dominated by the White owned business corporations of the world. </p>

		<p>Perhaps one factor is that white males are discriminated against; while Chinese and Indian males are given neutral treatment in schools. Women and liberals realize that much technical competence is needed for America to function. Since women and black men can&rsquo;t supply this capability, they will use Chinese, Indian, and other non-white males for these functions, thus eliminating an important source of white male income.</p>

		<p>They study study study, and learn learn learn, yes practice makes perfect. The reason &#8220;asians&#8221; excell is they apply themselves as opposed to most other races who go to party. If you practice at a sport and someone else never even knew what it was, who would be better? Lets say Einstein was raised in a primeval jungle what would he have accomplished?  I become weary of all the hoopla about asians being smarter than whites. Only a minute percentage of any race is truly intelligent, since these are the ones who come up with mathematical theroms, and invent complicated things that nearly all others could live thousands of years and never conceive of. Those who many consider smart can barely work mathematical problems even after the masters have shown them the formulas, and they are sort of able to use the inventions those geniuses have made. If a great catastrophe should occur we would revert to life as it was a thousand years ago almost instantly. All that being said, I believe liberal whites are the stupidest humans on earth, since they are all hell bent on self destruction</p>

Wise claimed they weren&rsquo;t doing better than blacks and that they had to struggle hard and it was, of course, white people&rsquo;s fault. At least with Asians they value working, be responsible, not relying on the government, they hate panhandlers (I was told this by a Chinese girl recently), and they don&rsquo;t go around attacking whites or other racial groups.  I&rsquo;d prefer my daughter or son to date an Asian than a hispanic and certainly more than I would a black man.

		<p>Higher east Asian intelligence is a bit overblown.  Their average IQ is 107, a little higher than average for whites, but the curve for them tends to be a bit narrower, with fewer geniuses and fewer idiots at the ends.  Where creativity is concerned, European whites have the market pretty much cornered, but this may not be biological, as Asian society values conformity.  Westernized Asians have produced some remarkable creative work, such as Larry Shinoda&rsquo;s styling of the 1963 &#8220;Stingray&#8221; body for the Corvette, which again suggests a cultural, rather than biological basis for creativity.</p>
<p>As for &#8220;They&rsquo;re too dull - they study, study, study&#8221;, I have to agree.  Everyone knows that the reason we have universities is not so young men and women can receive an education that will make them better citizens and provide them access to good jobs.  Rather, the purpose of universities is so these young people can get drunk, use drugs, and have unprotected sexual intercourse with lots and lots of partners.  Asians are viciously refusing to get with the program here, and perhaps strict admissions quotas are necessary to allow our universities to maintain their status as centers of Bacchanalian debauchery.<br>

We can compare that intentional ommition to other countries that could be named in the dozens and that are the cause of most of today&rsquo;s tensions and real problems, if they did not hold onto resentful memories.  Perhaps Vietnam looked at North Korea and decided on a different future?</p>

		<p>While certain IQ tests may appear to prove Asian intellectual superiority, I agree with numerous other posters that cultural imperatives (never let anyone get ahead of you) and intense parental pressure are mistaken for genuine genetic intellectual achievement.  In other words, no, they aren&rsquo;t all that bright - they just work hard, and they love showing up Whites (they find us stupid and lazy and feel that their civilization is obviously superior).  I&rsquo;ve lived in Asia and my upper-middle class neighborhood is overwhelmingly immigrant (Chinese and Indians and Pakistanis) and I detest it.  Chinese social, cultural, and business life is centered on extended family and clan - it&rsquo;s intensely tribal and if you&rsquo;re not related, forget about anything resembling traditional Western notions of friendship, let alone a job opportunity.  I was fortunate to finish college before the immigrant wave quite took over; so many are still so unaware that approximately 50% or more of Ivy League students are Asian or Jewish.  Undergraduate education at these schools is appallingly bad, too - you&rsquo;re far better off at a smaller, second-tier school for your initial degree.  Why any White American students would aspire to join them is beyond my ken.  Let them have all the spots - of course, once we start other predominantly White schools and they find we&rsquo;ve left their party, they&rsquo;ll rush to follow - just as they do in housing and everything else.  No one can take advantage of you without your consent - decline and fall.</p>

<p>Even if one grants that it may be a good thing (or a tolerable thing) to have a few people around from some non-white, non-European countries, we couldn&rsquo;t possibly  have any need for more than 10%, max.  Preferably no more than 5%.  </p>

That would be people not old enough to remember when the assumption that &#8220;American&#8221; meant &#8220;white&#8221;  was a reasonable one.  For example, in 1960 it had a 90% chance of being correct, more if one were to specify one of the regions that were more like 95% white.   </p>

However, it&rsquo;s not the average people that make society progress- it&rsquo;s the people at the far end of the bell curve that do. And that&rsquo;s precisely where whites dominate. There are more white geniuses as a percentage of the white population than there are asians as a percentage of the asian population.

		<p>The Japanese have produced a good number of Science Nobel Prize winners in recent years; there have also been a few Chinese-American winners such as Roger Tsien and Charles Kao. This means that Asians definitely have the intellect, they just need the right environment to thrive in. While the majority of technological and scientific progress has been made by Whites, it should be noted that places like China, for most of its history, didn&rsquo;t have the financial resources nor the political stability to carry out research - but that&rsquo;s different today. As they further develop and acquire the means to support innovation, I have a feeling that we&rsquo;ll eventually see great things from the Far East.  </p>

The post-1965 asians would have us believe that without them, White Americans would experience a massive decrease in their statndard of living. This of course, is a very big lie.</p>
<p>Everyone here should be outraged that White Americans are being forced to compete for the scarce resources of America with the children of asian foreigners.</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;What do you think the prospective employer will do, if the employer knows that there is an artificial slanting of entrance requirements and grades?&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Hire them anyway, as mandated by government-enforced AA policies and to avoid being sued into bankruptcy by race-based &#8216;activists&rsquo; and their government- funded organizations, and, most importantly, to keep the government&rsquo;s boot off his neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Well, the People got Affirmative Action removed from the University of California system, and now, the People must deal with the consequences&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>After the passage of Prop 209:  &#8220;By fall 2006, only 250 of the 12,189 students admitted to UCLA&rsquo;s freshman class were African American, roughly 2%. This is the lowest number since at least 1973  &mdash;  results that could have been predicted right out of the tables and graphs in The Bell Curve.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Since that time, the UC regents have turned themselves itself inside and out to circumvent Prop 209  &mdash;  to return to admissions based on race rather than academic achievement.  After all, isn&rsquo;t it main the job of the UCs to promote &#8216;diversity&rsquo; and &#8216;multi-culturalism&rsquo; and to exclude White applicants whose parents&rsquo; taxes fund the UCs?</p>
<p>PLC (Pacific Legal Foundation) reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;University of California, Los Angeles, switched its admissions policy, to a &#8216;holistic review&rsquo;. Strong evidence suggests this was done with an eye to admitting applicants based on race&hellip;which violates Proposition 209, the California Civil Rights Initiative</p>
<p>PLF has formally requested admissions-related data that would help in an assessment of whether the holistic process is being used to violate Proposition 209. But UCLA has rejected the request in total.</p>
<p>UCLA&rsquo;s resistance to transparency and refusal to divulge key information now makes it necessary for PLF attorneys to proceed with litigation, to compel compliance with the state&rsquo;s Public Records Act&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Professor MacDonald writes in OO:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;By using &#8216;holistic&rsquo; rating systems that deemphasize test scores, Blacks entering UCLA had SAT scores that were on average 300 points below White and Asian students&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>These students are expected to compete with those admitted on the basis of intellectual ability, setting them up for quick failure.</p>
<p>Thomas Sowell writes that when black or hispanic students realize they are in way over their heads they either drop out or scream &#8216;racism.&rsquo;  I would add that they most likely switch majors from pre-law or pre-med to black or chicano studies  &mdash;  perhaps these ridiculous departments were opened for this very reasons.</p>
<p>So, yes, this is the system we Californians have to live  &mdash;  one where the voters pass a legitimate Proposition barring race-based admissions to the UCs we pay for via our satanic tax burden, only to have those same universities do everything in their power to bar admission to our high-achieving White and Asian children in favor NAMs who score &#8216;300 points below&rsquo; our children.</p>
<p>Sounds fair to me.</p>

		<p>Asians, while working very hard, do receive preference over whites. For example, Yale and Harvard admit Asians (and some others) at three times the level they would be admitted if grades and test scores were the only criteria. Obviously race is being used as a consideration even if that&rsquo;s denied by officials. It should also be noted that while a higher percentage of Asians have good test scores for college admittance, in terms of raw numbers, there are many more White students with top end qualifications. They are simply ignored, discriminated against. </p>
<p>Listing the styling of an automobile is not comparable with massive, sweeping changes, ideas and innovations produced by Whites. The difference between Whites and Asians is in the structure of each group&rsquo;s intelligence. Asians have a structure skewed heavily toward visuospatial abilities, on average outscoring Whites in this area, while Whites on average outscore Asians in verbal/analytical reasoning portions of IQ tests - and verbal does not only mean language or reading, this is where people get confused. It should also be noted that if psychometrists hadn&rsquo;t decided to change the way different portions of IQ tests are weighted, lending more &#8220;weight&#8221; to visuospatial questions, Whites would have a higher average IQ than Asians.  The main thing that should be noted is that Whites are the only racial group that seems to score evenly between Visuospatial / Verbal on average when it comes to IQ tests. Asians and almost all other non-whites score better on visuospatial reasoning than verbal/analytical. Even psychometrists who like to pretend they&rsquo;re being brave and speaking the truth try to avoid dealing with this fact.  It is this &#8216;balance&rsquo; that some believe might be the root of the inventiveness that seems to show up more often in Whites than in non-whites, including 40 hrs per week of study East Asians. </p>
<p>Other people wonder about the SD (Standard Deviation) being different between the races. Daniel Vining did some research that pointed toward E. Asians having a narrower SD than Whites, which drove the Asian supremacists nuts. While almost every indicator points this way, everyone wants to be in denial (even Lynn has contradicted himself on this). Then there was Linda Gottfredson, who tried to show Asians as having a fractionally wider SD than Whites. But this was because she dropped SE Asian scores into the mix with NE Asian scores. If one wants to do this, then they must do it when presenting IQ &#8220;averages&#8221;, which would then drop the overall average IQ for Asians. What do I mean? When you read about Asian IQ, it&rsquo;s the averages for North East Asians; Koreans, Chinese, Japanese.  South East Asians are excluded. Their lower average intelligence would drag down the overall average for &#8220;Asians&#8221;&gt; But when Whites have their IQ &#8220;average&#8221; presented, it&rsquo;s everything and everyone from all over Europe. If Whites were separated say, as Northern Europeans being one group, then the averages would change. But that wouldn&rsquo;t be PC mentioning Germans, Poles, Swedes etc. walking around with average IQ&rsquo;s of 106 - 107, depending on what freaking IQ test is being used. It&rsquo;s only OK to separate groups to help with scores if the groups are non-white. </p>
<p>All this brings to mind another note, the different numbers tossed about for averages. You can read the Bell Curve or what have you, and some chart may show E. Asians 5 points higher on average than Whites, but the authors will say the difference is 3 points. Same thing goes on all over, with certain groups clinging to unrealistic info showing them with a ten point bulge over those horrible Whites. The fact is that there is a huge overlap between Whites and E. Asians. The difference again, is the structure. Just because Asians can learn, memorize, comprehend, does not mean they can innovate, link unrelated ideas, and make certain leaps of logic. But they can and do take advantage of what is offered in the US, honestly and dishonestly. Anyone stating that Asians are the most discriminated against group in the US is being disingenuous. Asians have been coy in claiming discrimination in college admittance, but their problems have been due to being put head to head with the other Asians trying to get in. They never mention that head to head against a White with equal or even slightly superior qualifications, the Asian will get the nod. Instead they&rsquo;ll go off and harp about some politician&rsquo;s kid getting admitted somewhere because of connections, but never about what happens to whites, especially white males when pitted against Asians and other non-whites. The White will be out in the cold. Because the US is run by an anti-white government, and that can&rsquo;t be argued. </p>

		<p>Anyone who follows college admissions knows that at most schools (UC, perhaps, excepted) there is outright discrimination against Asians. If it weren&rsquo;t for this discrimination the overrepresentation would be even higher.</p>
<p>US News: &hellip; Translating the advantages into SAT scores, study author Thomas Espenshade, a Princeton sociologist, calculated that African-Americans who achieved 1150 scores on the two original SAT tests had the same chances of getting accepted to top private colleges in 1997 as whites who scored 1460s and Asians who scored perfect 1600s.</p>
<p>Espenshade found that when comparing applicants with *similar grades, scores, athletic qualifications, and family history* for seven elite private colleges and universities:</p>
<p>Whites were three times as likely to get fat envelopes as Asians. Hispanics were twice as likely to win admission as whites. African-Americans were at least five times as likely to be accepted as whites.</p>
