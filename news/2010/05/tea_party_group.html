<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t want the worst elements to take this over,&#8221; said Brendan Steinhauser, campaign director for FreedomWorks, a national group that helps coordinate tea party activists. &#8220;If they do, the tea party loses independents, it loses moderates, it loses people who don&rsquo;t tolerate this. Being a racist is one of the worst things you can be in this society. No one wants to be labeled this.&#8221;</p>
<p>The challenge is made tougher by one of the defining elements of the tea party movement: No one person controls it. There is no national communications strategy. And incidents of racist slogans and derisive depictions of President Obama continue to crop up, providing fuel for critics who say the president&rsquo;s skin color is a powerful reason behind the movement&rsquo;s existence.</p>
<p>In a new Washington Post-ABC News poll, most Americans see the movement as motivated by distrust of government, opposition to the policies of Obama and the Democratic Party, and broad concern about the economy. But nearly three in 10 see racial prejudice as underlying the tea party.</p>
<p>Supporters and opponents alike say the movement draws its strength from opposition to Obama&rsquo;s policies, but they split deeply on the race question, according to the poll: About 61 percent of tea party opponents say racism has a lot to do with the movement, a view held by just 7 percent of tea party supporters.</p>
<p><b>A matter of perception</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>&#8216;They were thrown out&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Judson Phillips, the founder of Tea Party Nation, said that at the heart of the effort to counter racism accusations is dissociating from protesters who cross the line. {snip}</p>
<p>At a protest in Nashville, Phillips said, there were &#8220;a couple of signs  &mdash;  which I&rsquo;m not convinced weren&rsquo;t plants from the other side  &mdash;  that were really tasteless and inappropriate.&#8221; The people who carried them &#8220;were told to put their signs down and leave.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They were literally thrown out of the event,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Tea party activists also point to the minority participants in their groups. &#8220;There are a lot of people bringing up the race card,&#8221; said Jim Coop, a member of the Tipton County Tea Party in Tennessee. &#8220;The tea parties I&rsquo;ve been to, there&rsquo;ve been black people there, Mexicans and everybody else you can think of.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nigel Coleman, who is black, leads the Danville TEA Party Patriots in southern Virginia. He said the fact that the movement is predominantly white doesn&rsquo;t mean it is inherently racist.</p>
<p>&#8220;I went to a wine festival yesterday,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Weren&rsquo;t too many black people there, either. Nobody called them racists.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nonetheless, tea party activists clearly feel an urgency to end the discussion.</p>

		<p>Being the non white Diversity Privilege Stereotype is one of the &#8220;best things&#8221; you can be in this society. If you were unlucky enough to be born to a breeding pair of White American Citizens, you are damned as a racist in your own White Republic. Tea Partiers will wither into nothing more than a historical footnote because they are White and therefore damnable.  They fail to argue from the critical problem: Do Whites in America have Civil Rights, or not? </p>
<p>Just being White is the Unforgivable Sin.</p>

<p>Guess what, Bishop Petit Bourgeois. By the deterministic logic of liberation theology (which is simply Marxist sociology strategically misnamed) YOU are the oppressor, as you will be till your dying day. To paraphrase James Cone, another luminary of liberation dogma, God is Brown and you are not. You are the enemy. Period.</p>

		<p>Man, I&rsquo;m getting tired of Whites with weak brains who constantly run from being called racists.</p>
<p>One should never say, I&rsquo;m not a racist. Always ask for a definition of the term and then, if you feel like it, pick apart each of the elements of the definition, but never end up saying, &#8220;See, that shows I&rsquo;m not a racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you play the anti-white bigot&rsquo;s game by answering to the term, you lose and you show that you have a weak mind.</p>

If the Tea Party stays on message of lowering taxes and limiting government, implying they&rsquo;re racists is a moot distraction.</p>
<p>As for the so-called unsavory elements of the Tea Party movement, it&rsquo;s likely these aren&rsquo;t members but disruptors and provocateurs:</p>

<p>White the Tea Party is a hopeful beginning, this kind of inverted-mirror thinking cripples them from the start.  As long as they think of Whites who aren&rsquo;t ashamed to be White as &#8220;the worst elements,&#8221; they&rsquo;re not going to get the kind of widespread support they need.</p>
<p>Right now, they&rsquo;re spinning their wheels, spending entirely too much of their energy on making themselves acceptable to the flagrantly leftist media.  If Judson Phillips really believes that &#8220;a racist is one of the worst things you can be in this society,&#8221; he ought to consider joining the Republicans, where he wouldn&rsquo;t have to soil his righteous hands with such distasteful topics.<br>

		<p>Well, if you think about it, what else are the Dems going to do to thwart the Tea Party folks?  The charge of &#8220;racism&#8221; is just about the most potent thing they&rsquo;ve got, even though it is totally false and baseless.  Let&rsquo;s face it, the Tea Party people are the Dems&rsquo; worst nightmare, and the Donkeys will play as dirty as they can to discredit it.  I believe that truth will out, though.  I am a Tea Party person, and the truth is that ANYONE can join us who espouses our point of view.</p>

		<p>No matter how much the tea-partiers try to excise &#8220;racist&#8221; elements from their ranks, it will never be good enough for their accusers, who always will &#8220;discover&#8221; new evidence of racism.  By playing into their tormentors&rsquo; hands, the leaders of the Tea Party Movement assure their irrelevancy. </p>

		<p> This story is written with typical liberal spin. The Tea Party leadership is depicted as scrambling frantically to avoid merited (according to the writers) allegations of &#8220;racism.&#8221; On the other hand, to many of us, the situation seems much more like the Left is using those allegations of &#8220;racism&#8221; to try to tar an organization that is basically not about race, with that dreaded word that Whites nowadays are so terrified of.</p>
<p> If there are a few scattered signs or slogans calling attention to Obama&rsquo;s race, well, what of it? Any &#8220;Tea Partyer&#8221; so weak-kneed as to run away from the movement because it&rsquo;s not flawless, probably didn&rsquo;t belong there and wasn&rsquo;t doing it much good anyway. And call the Tea Partyers what the Left will, at least they have not rioted, stoned police, burned buildings, or, worst of all, killed anyone as Leftist mobs around the world routinely do.</p>

		<p>From what I&rsquo;ve seen of the tea party I don&rsquo;t hold out much hope. They seem to lack focus and don&rsquo;t have a coherent platform, preferring to dwell on taxes and Obamacare. I think they are part of a large and growing mass of people who are disaffected and don&rsquo;t have a political party to go to that will look out for their interests. They feel sold out. Various establishment shills might try to lure them back into the fold with some speeches heavy on the rhetoric. Otherwise, the establishment might fear having too many uncontrolled and independent people out there and try to break them up via dirty tricks, a Cointelpro type attack. I hope they prove me wrong and it matures into a viable alternate party that I can vote for without holding my nose.    </p>

		<p>I got into a back-and-forth argument on Twitter with a national tea party movement leader who shall go unnamed here.  His point was that birthers and truthers have no place in the TPM, my retort was that since the TPM is a movement and not an organization, he was in no position to enforce that wish.</p>
<p>The second paragraph in this article is crucial here   &mdash;   Anyone can organize and attend a TP rally.  While that might be a bad thing, in terms of far-left agitators, it can also be a good thing:  I know for certain that CofCC members and leaders have had crucial roles in several TP rallies in a few localities.</p>

		<p>I can see why the Tea Party has to do what it has to do in regards to race in order to try and get those skittish Whites not to run. It&rsquo;s the policies that count, such as the strong belief in secure borders and fiscal responsibility.</p>

		<p>Everyone is racist, by someone&rsquo;s definition. To breathe the air is to be racist.  All of God&rsquo;s children are racist.  You, me, that guy over there. So, what&rsquo;s the problem anyway?  Just relax, live with it, get on with your life.  Stop worrying, &amp; learn to love the racism.  </p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t win this battle, so we have to stop fighting it.  We need to point out how ridiculous the whole thing is.  It&rsquo;s just a word that means anything &amp; therefore nothing.  </p>

		<p>With all that is going on right now, why in the world do so many whites still act so sheepish and naive about this issue?  This country was doing great in the 1950s in just about every way. If I ever mention this obvious point to the white people I go to church with, they always lecture me on how &#8220;but we weren&rsquo;t nice to minorities&#8221;.</p>
<p>Are white people so clueless to the fact that it is because we have chosen to ignore the issue of race entirely that our country is falling the way it is?  If we are a &#8220;racist&#8221; country, who cares??????   Being racially aware is the only way we will ever become a successful nation ever again.  But I guess so many &#8220;conservative&#8221; whites would rather trade our success for &#8220;tolerance&#8221;.</p>

		<p>If we have 100 professors and 95 white professors say 1 +1 = 2 but only 3 latino professors agree and the 2 black professors say 2 + 2 = 5 does that make the correct answer racist?  NO!  If people would just stop responding to the nit-wit charges of racism it would eventually go away.  </p>

Citizen: We are demonstrating for what is right!<br>
Reporter:  But are you racist?<br>

		<p>Why continue to rise to the race bait either way? All this bellowing about &#8220;racism&#8221; hasn&rsquo;t appeared to harm the movement in the slightest - and as Pat Buchanan noted in his recent piece on the TPers, most seem surprisingly undeterred by all the accuasations and such that normally send whites reeling in terror. </p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a good deal of evidence that the Tea Party Movement is being co-opted by Neo-Con forces to sidetrack the movement and divert it fromk its original course.  That being said, the forces that want to destroy White people want to control both sides of any issue.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter if all of these White people hung their heads and begged forgiveness for slavery; they&rsquo;d still be called &#8220;racists&#8221;.</p>
<p>It is high time for Whites to literally embrace the word &#8220;Racist&#8221; and be proud to be called one.  There must be an identifiable White movement in this country for Whites to take it back.  Anything less is not enough.  If the Tea Party Movement is the forerunner to that day that&rsquo;s fine.  But worrying about being called &#8220;racist&#8221; is not going to suffice for White people.  They must shed their fear of this word.</p>

		<p>HH has it exactly right.  What do We care what the ENEMY calls us?  When we respond, THEY have just defined the argument and the discussion.  IGNORE THEM.  Period.  When the media brings it up, ignore THEM and begin talking about the FACTS.  Stick to the facts, ma&rsquo;am as Sgt Joe Friday always said.  Just the facts.  Example.  Media asks &#8220;many people believe the Tea Party is racist.  How do you respond?&#8221;  Answer: sir or ma&rsquo;am, we are gathered to voice our opposition to an out of control government, a national budget that has bankruptcy, and soon, written all over it.  We are against Federal mandates that we buy ANY product, but especially one managed by the Federal Government who has NEVER EVER been able to produce a PROFIT, but can only TAKE from us.&#8221;  Thereby ignoring the bait, but answering the question.  </p>

		<p>Of course the Tea Party is racist.  Congressman Charlie Rangel explained it to all back in 1995.  I can&rsquo;t even reproduce his remarks on this page without getting bleeped.</p>
<p>(NY Congressman Charles Rangel) &#8220;They don&rsquo;t say &#8216;sp**&#8221; or &#8216;n****r&rsquo; anymore, they just say let&rsquo;s cut taxes.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>

<p>Absolutely right Schoolteacher!<br>
Remember that all this rubbish has been &#8216;invented&rsquo; by these warped people (whom are in power all over the Western world by the way&hellip;) which is why I don&rsquo;t even have these silly &#8216;isms&rsquo; in my vocabulary.

		<p>I recently had one of these back-and-forth arguments with a self-hating white. My freind posted an article titled &#8220;Imagine if the Tea Party were black&#8221;. I contended that the Civil Rights Movement alone would more than qualify as the black Tea Party, and that the Tea Party&rsquo;s right of assembly was protected under the First Amendment. This self-hating white went on a rant about how Brown vs. Board of Education was hardly enforced these days. I lamented the fact that my argument had resulted in a distraction from the issue at hand, and asserted that every good argument needs a call to action, in other words, what should be done about the Tea Party, and argued that it was racist to encourage a government shut down of the movement because is happens to be composed of whites. There he went off his rocker, all these accusations that I was some ignorant white girl who has never been outside of the suburbs, to which I informed him of my experiences in non-white countries and left the argument. Next day, I recieved an apology, mainly because one of my (surprisingly liberal) friends chewed him out for making assuptions about people he did not know. </p>
<p>Point: Istvan has it right. Remember when you are in an argument to keep you head. When a direct question like &#8220;are you racist&#8221; comes at you, deflect it. Do not try to make a claim that all are racist. You may be right, but the word is too tainted. Otherwise you can stick to the law, the Constitution, as I did. As well, one of the greatest liberal tools is to distract from the issue at hand. I would have loved to go on a rant about Brown vs. Board of Education, but you show yourself a better debater if you can focus on the issue and your less likely to confuse issues. Do not become indignant about ad hominem attacks, defend yourself in a few words, but do not let your opponent put the focus on you. </p>
<p>When he apologized, I acknowledged some of his good points: such as his point that his living in a black city was much worse an experience than I had in the Middle East. Thus, his criticism of me was turned into an example of his own racism: we all know blacks are the most unruly. I do not think he was smart enough to get this, but it was a personal victory. </p>
<p>When your opponents are out to dehumanize you, show them respectful contempt.    </p>

Istvan is correct.</p>
<p>As I said, all the Tea Party members have to do is stick to their message; lower taxes and limited government. Instead, a reporter shoves a microphone in their face as asks they, &#8216;why are you a racists&rsquo; and these idiots fumble under pressure.</p>
<p>The problem with the TPM is that there are too many talkative fools who don&rsquo;t know how to stay on message and shut their mouths. I&rsquo;m also sure the MSM selectively edits to show the least articulate. </p>
<p>If the MSM wanted a real story, they should be interviewing the people with the signs and looking into their backgrounds. It&rsquo;s very likely they&rsquo;re disruptors and provocateurs.<br>

		<p>&#8220;The presidents skin color is a large reason for the movement&rsquo;s existance.&#8221; Oh contrare, the color red of the president&rsquo;s politics is the reason for the movement, regardless of however weak the movement is, that is the reason. The original tea party was over taxation without represention. We now have taxation with represention, forced on us by elected officials, who could care less about their constituents. We now get to pick the democratic fascist government of our choice. &#8220;aka&#8221; &#8220;The pick your poison plan.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t really blame the Tea Party. The forces of orthodoxy are so powerful, it&rsquo;s very difficult for any explicitly racially conscious group to achieve mainstream status. Look at what happened to Amren. It&rsquo;s conference was shut down. The best that can be said for the Tea Party is that it might pave the way for more and more explicitly racially conscious groups in the future. But not now.</p>

		<p>I think liberals can&rsquo;t think of anything else to say.</p>
<p>How do you defend massive waves of illegal immigrants?</p>
<p>How do you defend the actions of inner-city blacks?</p>
<p>How do you defend the hypocrisy of political correctness?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t. So you try and silence your detractors by call them racists.</p>

		<p>A friend of mine said when non-whites and liberals call you a racist to say, &#8220;You know, most psychologists would call that projection.  Maybe you are exactly what you&rsquo;re accusing me of being.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Every white American who is attacked by these anti-white, self-hating, Cultural Marxism brainwashed liberals on the topic of legal and illegal immigration into America should respond with this piece of common sense:</p>
<p>From the Southern edge of the Rio Grande river, stretching all the way down to the distant tip of South America - a land mass that encompasses an entire geographic hemisphere, in addition to the territory between the Equator and the southern-most border of the United States - forms a body of land that is both populated by, and under the exclusive control of, people of Hispanic descent.    These are the ancestral homelands of people of Hispanic origin.   In those countries, Hispanic people are running the show and calling the shots - and they and their culture, language, customs, values and religious preferences are dominant.   And we agree with that dominance.   We also believe that no outside, non-Hispanic ethnic group has the right to interfere in their nations.</p>
<p>But, we, as White Americans of European descent expect and demand the exact same thing for our people within our ancestral homelands, which are in North America.   Our land mass, which encompasses far less physical territory than what these Hispanics currently occupy, is ours to keep and ours to hold onto, and we are not going to apologize or make excuses for being opposed to the colonization and the dispossession of White Europeans within our own nation.</p>
<p>White people, such as these Tea Party folks, have to stop running from the subject of race and<br>
address this issue head-on.   As I&rsquo;ve said previously,  have a printed copy of the 1947/1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in your pocket, and memorize the official, codified, internationally agreed upon, definition of genocide and hammer these anti-White liberals and Cultural Marxists and La Raza race hustlers over the head with it and put these people on the defensive.   Maneuver them into a corner and force them to justify why genocide of European people is supposed to go unopposed!</p>
