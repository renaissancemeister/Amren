<h1><a href="https://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=153149">&#8216;Barack Obama Doesn&rsquo;t Care About White People!&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Larry Elder, WorldNetDaily, May 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} None [who performed on a telethon to raise money for victims of the historic floods ravaging parts of Tennessee, Kentucky and Mississippi] accused the Obama administration of indifference or lack of attentiveness to these floods.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} During a Katrina fundraiser, rapper Kayne West accused President George W. Bush of indifference to the plight of those suffering. West said, &#8220;George W. Bush doesn&rsquo;t care about black people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hurricane Katrina was catastrophic. It caused over 1,500 deaths, with property damage estimated at near $100 billion and hundreds of thousands of people displaced. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But has the traditional media devoted the time and attention warranted by the historic floods?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>How big a deal are these floods?</p>
<p>Hale [Elden Hale, general manager of Nashville&rsquo;s NBC affiliate, WSMV] said his area received 15 inches of rain in two days, a phenomenon of &#8220;biblical proportions.&#8221; People, he said, still haven&rsquo;t grasped the dimensions of this disaster. The rainfalls are the highest since records have been kept. The resulting floods have been described as the greatest tragedy to hit the area since the Civil War. So far, 30 peopled are listed dead, the count expected to grow as floods recede and bodies are recovered. {snip}</p>
<p>Why haven&rsquo;t the floods gotten more attention?</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t want to get into that,&#8221; Hale said, &#8220;but you and I both know they care more about the two coasts than they do Middle America.&#8221; Did NBC network express any interest in airing the telethon? &#8220;No,&#8221; Hale said, &#8220;but in fairness, I didn&rsquo;t offer it to them. We intended for it to be a local affair.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In his piece &#8220;We Are Nashville,&#8221; Tennesee writer Patten Fuqua said: &#8220;Parts of Nashville that could never even conceivably be underwater were underwater. Some of them still are. Opry Mills and the Opryland Hotel are, for all intents and purposes, destroyed. People died sitting in standstill traffic on the Interstate. We saw boats going down West End. And, of course, we all saw the surreal image of the portable building from Lighthouse Christian floating into traffic and being destroyed when cars were knocked into it. I&rsquo;m still having trouble comprehending all of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Consider some alternate explanations for the media&rsquo;s comparative lack of interest:</p>
<p>* Those affected, residents and officials, didn&rsquo;t blame others. WSMV general manager Hale praised the spirit of Tennessee. His station, organizers and entertainers came together with two days notice. Quoting one of his news anchors, Hale said, &#8220;&#8216;Volunteerism is in our DNA.&rsquo; When the Red Cross came in they were surprised because so much had already been done.&#8221;</p>
<p>* The media&rsquo;s beloved Obama failed to carry Tennessee, Kentucky and Mississippi. Those states, alien (if not enemy) territory, are simply of minor importance. It&rsquo;s just hard to feel those folks&rsquo; pain.</p>
<p>* One Bush critic argued that the president didn&rsquo;t care about New Orleans because it is &#8220;black&#8221; and &#8220;sexy.&#8221; Perhaps the media&rsquo;s indifference to Nashville is because that city is &#8220;only&#8221; 25 percent black and therefore &#8220;white and redneck.&#8221;</p>
<p>* Non-Obama voting, self-reliant &#8220;Hee-Haw&rsquo;ers&#8221; who aren&rsquo;t blaming somebody for their troubles just don&rsquo;t make for big news.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the race card when you need it?</p>

		<p>Not only did Tennessee not vote Obama, it was one of the few states to vote more Republican in 2008 compared to 2004.  However, Davidson County did vote more Democrat in 2008 compared to 2004, mainly b/c of blacks swarming the polls to get a black President elected.  </p>
<p>Let me present some silver linings to this cloud:</p>
<p>* The victims didn&rsquo;t need the help, mainly because they were prepared, and linked into church and fraternal organizations that were right there to provide help.  </p>
<p>It is my understanding that almost all the flooding victims were white, because Nashville&rsquo;s blacks tend to ghettoize in areas that happen to be on higher ground.</p>
<p>* Federal/Obama help would have been counterproductive.  It would have involved gun seizures, and forced diversity.</p>

		<p>Haven&rsquo;t heard from Larry Elder in quite awhile - I like him a lot.  He&rsquo;s a Libertarian and calls blacks &#8220;victocrats&#8221; and &#8220;entitlement mentalities.&#8221;  But that&rsquo;s just it - whites are opposite of blacks from the day we set foot on these shores - we did ALL of it ourselves, without any help from any Massa or Big Brother or anybody else.  Blacks can&rsquo;t function alone; they have to have the help of people who know more than they do.  Whites did what they had to do to get the education they needed to get the job done, as opposed to blacks, who had kids at age 14 and were dealing crack at 12.  B.O. can&rsquo;t even conceive of a value system like white folk hold; it&rsquo;s foreign territory to him and his ilk, so obviously he isn&rsquo;t going to help white people.  On the other hand, white people don&rsquo;t really need his help.  He&rsquo;d just put up another expensive guv&rsquo;m&rsquo;t program that screws everyone.</p>

<p>NO!  That just can&rsquo;t be true!</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m stunned to learn that.  After all it has been such a well-kept secret.</p>
<p>The next outlandish claim we&rsquo;re going to hear is that everything Obama does is for the purpose of benefiting blacks someway, and if anyone else benefits it&rsquo;s an unintended consequence.</p>
<p>Oh, the lies thrown about.  I&rsquo;ll have to watch Chris Matthews tonight to be reassured.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s been some major natural disasters in this country more devastating and more widespread than the flood that hit New Orleans and yet people have rebuilt and moved on.  It&rsquo;s been 5 years since Hurricane Katrina and we&rsquo;re still hearing about it and we&rsquo;ll be hearing about it for another 5 years.  </p>

		<p>As usual, only a black is permitted to speak truthfully about racial matters. Had a White commentator made the same remarks, the screams of &#8220;Racist!&#8221; would have echoed all the way to New Orleans. Assuming, of course, that they would have been printed at all. </p>

		<p>I haven&rsquo;t read his stuff but from what I&rsquo;ve heard about him from others, Larry Elder has written some pretty good stuff. Just the title of his book, &#8220;Stupid Black Men&#8221; - an obiovus parody of Michael Moore&rsquo;s sick and lie-filled &#8220;book&#8221;, &#8220;Stupid White Men&#8221; - gives one the idea that he is open-minded to unpopular views.</p>

<p>Perhaps I&rsquo;m misinformed, but I believe that a state government, in coordinating with local governments,  is the first responder to natural disasters. The Federal government acts as a backup and provides financial assistance for rebuilding. </p>
<p>In the New Orleans&rsquo; flooding, the ineptness of the State and local governments made the flood a much bigger disaster. Also the federal levees became defective, a few days after the flooding. Thus the Feds had to do much more and sooner, than in a normal state, compare what happened in neighboring Mississippi.<br>
I got the impression that the newsers blamed Bush mainly to divert attention from this massive state and local incompetence. </p>

<p>&#8220;As usual, only a black is permitted to speak truthfully about racial matters.&#8221;</p>
<p>What disadvantages white conservatives is that they &#8220;don&rsquo;t want to make a scene&#8221; beyond the level of polite debate.  Their intelligence and civility works against them in this regard often when they act unable to recognize a life or death struggle.  But that will change.</p>
<p>Once the fairy tale of the white American-dream diminishes sufficiently, whites will start making waves.  The growth of hostile power blocs amongst blacks and hispanics (and leftist Whites too) will convince pro-Western whites that it is sensible to defend their own interests aggressively.  And this in turn will encourage white politicians to court white interests just as they did 100 years ago.  There will be&hellip; an American Renaissance.</p>
<p>It sometimes seems that sensible whites don&rsquo;t have the stomach to ensure their own survival.  But I have faith that they will never consent to living like third worlders for indefinite amounts of time.  Their pseudo-white counterparts on the Left and all their little dark-skinned minions can be perfectly happy living in primitivism.  But right-thinking Western bred whites will never consent to being ruled over by those whose normative IQs scarcely rise above the level of mild retardation.</p>

<p>Two quick points:</p>
<p>1.) General Secretary BO and his merry band of Harvard Bolsheviks, are not only interested in not helping the whites of these states, they want to eradicate them from the face of the earth. Thus, why offer them any assistance when Allah or the ghost of Che (or whatever other false gods they believe in) visits disasters upon them? </p>
<p>2.) It must also really drive these Red elitists insane with hateful and hyperactive envy, that the whites in these states disprove their multicultural paradigm in both action and outcome. Unlike the &ldquo;downtrodden&rdquo; blacks of that &ldquo;Chocolate City&rdquo; in Louisianan, the whites of these areas did not rape and pillage at the fist chance the disasters offered them. Quite the contrary, they rolled up their sleeves and hitched up their bootstraps, and began to put things in order as quickly as possible. </p>
<p>Not the sort of behavior that the dependency fostering classes of Washington see as very welcoming or progressive, in terms of building a &ldquo;Utopia States of America.&rdquo; </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>I am always reminded of Mayor Nagin&rsquo;s famous &#8220;hep me speech&#8221; in which he decried the white federal government to help him that things were out of control. I reminded me of the old Tudor Turtle cartoons in which he asked the Wizard to make him something he couldn&rsquo;t be and then when he got in over his head he would beg the Wizard to be a Turtle again. </p>
<p>Nagin was the same way he was finally in a position he could not control so he begged for help from the federal government. He also seized fire arms from innocent whites who only wanted to defend themselves from the warring factions. It&rsquo;s no wonder New Orleans is such a hole. <br>

		<p>I heard a horrible conversation between my daughters and her two friends yesterday and it hasn&rsquo;t left my mind since. I overheard the girls playing in the recroom and the one little girl wanted to play &#8220;pregnant teen&#8221; instead of regular house with a mommy and daddy. When I heard my daughter ask her why, she replied, &#8220;don&rsquo;t you see the high school girls that are pregnant? They get to leave school early, they live with their parents and have their own money, I heard they even get a free car!&#8221; I was devastated to hear this and couldn&rsquo;t help but think our white children are being brainwashed into entitlement children. I sat the girls down and tried to tell them the perils of being a single teenage mother and that more than likely if they became so would mean that their kids would be strapped with heavy burden of poverty. Later that night the little girls mother called and screamed at me for putting down her pregnant 14 yr. old and scaring the little sister. </p>

		<p>Midwest flood or tornado disasters are of little interest to the media simply because the white victims just get up, dust themselves off, and start rebuilding their towns and lives.</p>
<p>Black victims typically sit on their haunches, wailing and crying and demanding that rescuers some to their aid, stopping only to do a bit of looting. They&rsquo;re professional victims and have learned their role well.  It&rsquo;s a role the liberal white MSM loves because it allows them to parade their moral superiority while condemning white society for our lack of compassion.</p>

<p>Back in 1996, the area where I live near Chi got 17 1/2 inches of rain in 12 hours. Also Biblical proportions. A state of emergency was declared and folks WERE TOLD TO STAY HOME!!</p>
<p>[that amount of rain in that amount of time is second in the continental U.S., surpassed only by a hurricane in Texas!!]</p>
<p>I cannot even recall one instnace of &#8220;trouble&#8221; in any sense of the word.</p>
<p>Recall the Des Moines IA. floods from some years back [no problems] and the &#8220;Witch&#8221; fire near San Diego a few years ago. 500,000 refugees created overnight and the only looting was by some illegal aliens who took advantage of the situation!!<br>

<p>So true! </p>
<p>Deep down inside, arrogant white liberals must know that their entire premise of &#8220;helping&#8221; only non-whites is based on a feeling of superiority to them. </p>
<p>Libs may dress it up as &#8220;compassion&#8221; but can there be anything more demeaning to a group of &#8220;unfortunates&#8221; than pandering to them? </p>
<p>Whites expect other whites to &#8220;get it together and move on&#8221; after a disaster, with a little assistance. White liberals regard black disaster victims as children who require attention, contributions, and extensive donated labor to be made whole - and the black community (such as in NOLA) rarely disappoints their audience.</p>

		<p>I suspect that if we stopped &#8220;cold Turkey&#8221; giving govt funds to blacks, that they would somehow dig down deep and find a lawful way to survive. The ones that won&rsquo;t find a way can work in the fields for prison system. America as constructed presently is an evil enterprise. </p>
