		<p> It&rsquo;s good to see the Council of Conservative Citizens holding its annal convention, with AmRen&rsquo;s own Jared Taylor as featured speaker. It&rsquo;s also good to see that the CofCC leaders seem to have learned something from AmRen&rsquo;s sad experience with the anti-free speech crowd early this year, in that they&rsquo;ve deliberately left the site for the convention ambiguous.</p>
<p> Might be a good idea, also, to try to have some way to detect and root out any multi-culti leftists who might call in for more information with intentions of disrupting or preventing the conference. And as I&rsquo;ve said before on this website, it might behoove CofCC to have some armed security on hand, also. Whatever Tennessee law allows; we conservative White Nationalists will never be fully respected until we are determined to stand up for ourselves, physically.</p>

		<p>The media and libs all like to bash anyone who was against Civil Rights for the blacks. They portray us as Unamerican Nazi bigots if we complain about Multicultural Diversity and uncontrolled immigration (invasion), and they will say our type are the same who were against MLK.</p>
<p>Everything the Segregation Leaders said would happen is coming true.  The failures of integration, assimilation, and Diversity, i.e. the failures of the blacks in general, all gather as a huge vindication of the &#8220;evil White Supremacists.&#8221;</p>
<p>These men were our prophets and heroes.  We must find way to force their detractors to be on the receiving end of the breakdown of White Civilization. It&rsquo;s happening now, making this the most exciting historical moment in our history.  </p>
<p>The Day of Reckoning soon comes, and we will live to see it!</p>
<p>Cox was a hero.  We should all know and adore him. </p>
<p> <a href="https://www.vahistorical.org/publications/abstract_ward.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.vahistorical.org/publications/abstract_ward.htm</a></p>
<p>&#8220;As an elder statesman of white supremacy, Cox waged a vigorous propaganda campaign from his lonely Richmond apartment. Churning out pamphlets and books well into his eighties, he argued that racial integration would tear apart American society and ultimately destroy Western civilization. White supremacists looked to Cox for encouragement and advice as they resisted the civil rights movement. Although it is tempting to view him as a lonely crusader with obsolete views, this article contends that Cox shared some of the same fears and convictions that motivated other committed opponents of the modern civil rights movement.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can have Civilization or Diversity, but you can&rsquo;t have both.<br>

<p>Armed security?   You do that, and you&rsquo;ll be arrested on weapons charges, or for menacing, or assault, or whatever. (The actual charge becomes irrelevant, as they&rsquo;ll always find something when they really want to.) Show any force or resistance, and you&rsquo;ll be portrayed by the national media (indeed around the world) as violent white supremecists and racists who are a threat to peace and democracy.  It&rsquo;s just what the media will love.   You can&rsquo;t win!</p>
<p>By the way, that&rsquo;s the same national media that wouldn&rsquo;t even notice you otherwise if you stood on your heads and screamed. But show up with guns, and suddenly the cameras and reporters will appear from out of everywhere, to record your arrest.</p>
<p>PS. Not that I&rsquo;m discouraging you;  just warning you.</p>

		<p>Since this event is in Tenneessee, I&rsquo;d love to go, but I&rsquo;ll be in South Florida for a week to ten days, so there&rsquo;s no way I can shake loose.</p>
<p>I would reccommend anybody to go that can, however.  I doubt that you&rsquo;ll have any problems with East Coast crazies anywhere in that entire area, and if you do, law enforcement there won&rsquo;t automatically judge you as a perp.</p>
<p>I have a few suppliers and customers in that area and go up that way often.  I&rsquo;d be surprised to see a protest group against the CofCC.  The members of CofCC know a LOT of people all throughout the South, and they are protectors and supporters of Southern Heritage and are definitely NOT apt to be viewed as anything but friends.</p>
<p>I seriously doubt the East Coast nut cases would EVER go to Tennessee for ANYTHING.  Most of them are so ignorant they view Southerners as rebels ready to fight at the drop of a hat.</p>
<p>But, on second thought, that description, incidentally, is not too far off.  They won&rsquo;t stand for being pushed around by anybody.</p>

Absolutely. Well trained, disciplined, dedicated security  may work well. This could not be a shake and bake operation by any means. A set up on the order of BNP security might do it. </p>
<p>To sit passively is an option whose time  is running out.<br>

<p><br>
Yes&hellip;..but will people believe it?</p>
<p>There is going to come a time when such techniques are not effective anymore because everyone assumes the media is lying and everyone knows about anti-white racist violence.</p>
<p>Things have begun to change.  People are talking about race more and more, behind closed doors&hellip;.just not openly yet.  They make decisions (including political decisions) pertaining to race.  They know it&rsquo;s about race but they don&rsquo;t mention race.  This has an unorganized subversive element to it.  In many places it has become an organized subversive element, up to and including things on the state government level (google Jesse Ventura and what he had to say about the CIA keeping tabs on various state and local governments and ask yourself&hellip;.what is it they are so worried about, hehehe).</p>
<p>In the not too distant future, this will openly be about race.  All the things that have been going on for the last several decades will come out and nothing the media or federal powers try to do can stop it.  They will find out that the only type of power they have is the soft power where most people agree to cooperate.  Expect that cooperation to cease&hellip;..and the evil chuckleheads responsible for all this to fall.</p>
<p>Coming soon.  Real soon.</p>

		<p>Anonymous 4 and Anonymous 6, I think the idea is to contract with a legitimate security company, not get a bunch of regular people to stand out front with guns. </p>
<p>And that sounds like a business opportunity.</p>

		<p>Ranger you are correct about Tennessee.  The CofCC are our friends, we of the Southern Nationalist movement.  However it would behoove them to enquire about some sort of security detail from the Confederate Legion or League of the South, if they can provide a detail.</p>

		<p>There have never been any problems at CofCC conferences. The last time a single protester showed up was way back in 2001, when a van full of &#8220;antis&#8221; drove from Columbus, Ohio to Ashville, NC. They found themselves alone, being laughed at, and packed up and left after only two hours. Since then, none have even bothered to show. </p>
<p>There is no need for &#8220;armed security.&#8221; Not that any hotel would allow it anyway. The only way to have armed security would be to hire off duty cops like they do at gun shows and community festivals.</p>

		<p>#3 Kyle,</p>
<p>The only reason I do not join Facebook nor do I Twitter anything is because there is growing speculation that these sites also serve as a medium for federal agencies to monitor citizens.  Yes, of course it could be some sort of nutsy propaganda.  But, then again, you never really do know until it&rsquo;s too late.  It&rsquo;s like those who believe that if you don&rsquo;t want to be tracked, use cash for everything, etc.</p>
