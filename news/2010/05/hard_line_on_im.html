			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Slevin, Washington Post, May 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>J.D. Hayworth is a {snip} border hawk who called his book about immigration policy &#8220;Whatever It Takes.&#8221;</p>
<p>But [John] McCain, seeking his fifth term, is not about to be out-toughed this year. Once seen as more moderate on immigration, McCain has also endorsed the state law [SB 1070], which requires police to question people they &#8220;reasonably suspect&#8221; are here illegally. And he wants to send thousands of National Guard soldiers to the border.</p>
<p>McCain&rsquo;s advertisements boast that he is &#8220;Arizona&rsquo;s last line of defense.&#8221; In his newest spot, he walks the border with a county sheriff, who turns to McCain and declares, &#8220;You&rsquo;re one of us.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>McCain&rsquo;s repositioning has fueled Hayworth&rsquo;s claim to be the &#8220;consistent conservative&#8221; while the incumbent is at best unpredictable. {snip}</p>
<p>Although McCain won the Republican nomination for president just two years ago, Hayworth pays little homage to his pedigree. He foresees an upset, thanks to the country&rsquo;s anti-incumbent mood and the candidacy of a 73-year-old politician who ran an uneven presidential campaign and is distrusted by many conservatives.</p>
<p>Yet McCain remains the favorite with the Aug. 24 primary still three months away. He has money in the bank  &mdash;  $4.6 million to Hayworth&rsquo;s $861,000 at the end of March  &mdash;  and a lead in the polls. Public Policy Polling showed McCain 11 points ahead in mid-April and the Rocky Mountain Poll showed him leading by 26 points. No top-tier Democrat has entered the race, which makes the winner of the GOP primary the favorite to win in November.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve recognized correctly that we need to be aggressive,&#8221; said Brian Rogers, McCain&rsquo;s campaign spokesman. &#8220;Immigration is the dominant issue. It&rsquo;s that and the economy, and they&rsquo;re connected in people&rsquo;s minds.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCain is likely to benefit from the party&rsquo;s decision to hold an open primary, allowing independents, who typically favor the senator, to cast ballots. He also won the endorsement of former running mate Sarah Palin and got a boost when Arizona&rsquo;s four largest tea party groups decided not to endorse a candidate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hayworth, too, was once more moderate on immigration, and he faces his own challenges, including ties to disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff. As a six-term congressman, he used sports skyboxes that Abramoff billed to clients, but did not report that fact to the Federal Election Commission until Abramoff&rsquo;s criminal troubles became public. Hayworth&rsquo;s campaign committee later repaid the Choctaw and Chitimacha tribes $12,800 for using the suites.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Sun City, where more than 100 people gathered under a golf course gazebo to hear Hayworth, he said to applause that when he served as a congressman, he took an oath &#8220;to the Constitution of the United States and not the charter of the United Nations.&#8221;</p>

		<p> Sure you will John.  We haven&rsquo;t forgot how you pushed for Amnesty in the past.  I trust John McCain about as far as I can throw him.  John McCain will give us lip-service about securing the border, some token effort, say he&rsquo;s going to legalize all the Mexicans only after the border is secure, and then gut the funding from the enforcement end.</p>

		<p>To date, the Tea Party candidates that have run against the other major GOP RINOs have been 100% successful.  McCain will be no different.  His career is over.</p>
<p>A takeover of the GOP is taking place.  It&rsquo;s very similar to the last two takeovers of the democtic party by radical leftists.  Except these people are conservatives with a libertarian bent.</p>
<p>No amount of money is going to make a difference.  Because the simple truth of the matter is white people have woken up.  And they are starting to notice that the other white people have also woken up.</p>
<p>White nationalists used to being mistreated by whites who were still in a stupor will resist admitting this has happened.  But it will soon be obvious&hellip;.to everyone.</p>

		<p>2:  The only place where the TPM hasn&rsquo;t been successful is in IN-Senate-GOP.  Dan Coats, the old time RINO/establishment type, beat back TPM favorite John Hostettler and one other GOPer for the GOP nom to replace Bayh.  Ironically, the man who toppled Hostettler in 2006, Blue Dog Dem Brad Ellsworth, is the Democrat nominee for Senate.  And I&rsquo;d vote Ellsworth if I lived in Indiana.</p>
<p>In Colorado, a TPM activist named Maes came out of nowhere to beat former Congressman Scott McInnis at the CO GOP Convention last week, for Governor.  This one is interesting b/c Tom Tancredo backed out in order to back McInnis.  Now, this convention did not determine the nominee, but only ballot access and ballot order.</p>

NBC Nightly did another report on the Arizona law and impact. They showed a poll that had 61% of Americans in favor of the law (that sounds low to me. These polls are usually hit 80%).</p>
<p>Of course, they were stymied why Americans, the &#8216;land of immigrants&rsquo;, would support such laws.</p>
<p>What appears to be going on is that the problems and frustrations of real people are becoming too much for the propagandists to rationalize.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope the momentum keeps building.<br>

		<p>Classic GOP deception. Just as they are always &#8220;conservative-to-the-core&#8221; when they are out of power, but big-spending, globalist bleeding-hearts once elected. This party cynically takes white people for granted again and again, and the white fools play the useful idiot every election cycle! NO ONE in the US Govt. represents us&hellip;no one! </p>

		<p>I just read the first article on this site: &#8220;John Mccain and the POW Cover-Up.&#8221;  This is a must read for people thinking about voting for McCain.  The well documented article is about hundreds of American POWs held as hostages for leverage at the 1973 Paris peace accords. Hanoi held 1,205 American POWs at the end of the war and only released 591.  North Vietamese general Tran Van Quang told the politburo members that Hanoi was holding hundres of prisoners as leverage to ensure getting reparations from Washington.  Washington did not cooperate and these POWs were never released.  John McCain played a major role in suppressing information about the POWs in question and sought to discredit the compelling evidence from sightings and from the North Vietnamese themselves. </p>

		<p>Never trust a &#8220;johnny come lately&#8221;. People need to beware these politicians who are <i>formerly moderate</i> on immigration. They&rsquo;ll say whatever they have to say to get elected. And then they&rsquo;ll try to stall and ride it out until the political climate shifts again. It&rsquo;s good to get the right people in office. But it&rsquo;s even better if you can create a situation where it&rsquo;s politically necessary for even the wrong person to do the right thing.</p>

		<p>I see the GOP is still endorsing RINOs at every turn.  It&rsquo;s rightfully called the Stupid Party just based on that.  Apparently only the GOP has not figured out what is going on, what kinds of candidates will win, what kinds of candidates the conservatives are DEMANDING.  The Independents LIKE McCain?  I doubt that very much.  Wishful thinking on the part of the Washington Post.  The entire MSM is calling this sea change an &#8220;anti-incumbent&#8221; movement.  Well, it&rsquo;s not.  Conservative incumbents with a track record of being conservative will do well overall.  RINOS, leftists and liberals will not.<br>
America is FED UP with betrayals, politicians who speak out of both sides of their mouths, politicians who sneer at mainstream Americans, politicians who call REAL Americans traitors and nazis while hugging every third world thug they see, and wanting to treat international and home grown muslim terrorists as if they robbed a liquor store.  The MSM knows this is not an &#8220;anti-incumbent&#8221; movement.  It&rsquo;s an anti-Obama, anti-Pelosi and anti-liberal, anti-RINO movement.  We are fed up with both the GOP and the DNC, we are fed up with both parties acting like one Supreme Soviet.  If ANYBODY trusts John McCain and votes for him then I&rsquo;ve got a stuffed Barney Frank huggie bear you can sleep with.  Sarah Palin I had my doubts about until she endorsed McCain.  Now I am convinced:  She is just another GOP shill.  A political harlot.</p>

		<p>Some people think that McCain&rsquo;s flip-flop on the immigration issue is insincere, and that as soon as the election is over, he will again endorse amnesty. But I think it is probably sincere, though the conversion probably didn&rsquo;t occur for a very flattering reason.</p>
<p>McCain was in 2008 known as the big Republican Amnesty advocate, and so he hoped to win the Hispanic vote in the Presidential election. Yet as it turned out Obama won roughly 70% of the Hispanic vote.</p>
<p>I think that really angered McCain and made him view Hispanics as being ungrateful, and so he is no longer willing to support the Hispanic pro-immigration agenda.</p>
<p>Because of this I have mixed feelings about the Arizona primary. While defeat for McCain would in a way serve him right given his repulsive past, it could also send the message that if you were once bad on immigration, you can&rsquo;t change your mind. That can make it more difficult to pressure politicians not to support certain pro-immigration bills in the future (or not to oppose anti-immigration bills).</p>

		<p>A few more comments about Theya&rsquo;s post.</p>
<p>It is massively documented that Jewish organizations are thoroughly hostile to White Christian majority. However, it is from clear that non-elite Jews are on board with this. I do not know the answer to this question.</p>
<p>Also, I do not buy into the HBD claim that Jewish elite hostility to the White Christian majority is rooted in some kind of deep gene-centric program due to Darwinian natural selection. Only a very weak version of this claim could be true in a trivial sense. I just don&rsquo;t see why it is necessary to go in this direction. As Professor Gottfried has pointed out on several occasions, it is the deep South Evangelical Christians who are the most fanatical supporters of the State of Israel - quite possibly much stronger supporters of the State of Israel than the ordinary - and weary looking - non-elite Jews in America.</p>
<p>I only have a conflict with ordinary American Jews to the extent that they expect me to give my allegiance to the State of Israel - which in practical terms means keeping ones shut about the subsidization of Israel and the the murder of mostly White Christian teenagers on the USS Liberty (one of the many wounded American teenagers aboard the USS Liberty was an Jewish, serving on the USS Liberty who is not the least bit happy about having been almost murdered by the Israeli gunships).</p>
<p>If millions of native born white Americans would just flex their muscles, we would start to see self-deportation of nonwhite &#8220;American&#8221; fifth columns-India Policy which owns close to a hundred traitors in the US congress- from Asia and the Muslim world. They would be receiving a very strong signal that the game is over.</p>
<p>My eyes glaze over when I ever I hear &#8220;MLK&#8221;. The 1964 civil rights act gave birth to 1965 Immigration Reform act - race-replacement immigration policy - school busing and the rape of White Women (about 15 years ago a young Jewish woman was kidnapped by a gang  of young black men in SC and ganged raped for two weeks).</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s some good news here. I am a regular on NewsVine and watched with great interest that a lot of Americans are now outraged with illegal immigration. MAKING THEIR VOICES HEARD!</p>
<p>The point is we are waking up. With the November elections coming closer, every Congressional party hack up for re-election is worried about his/her political future. Because being seen as soft on illegal immigration can well be the kiss of death for such party hacks. Let your politicians hear from you. Let them make the choice. Scuttle their careers for Obama and La Raza or heed the will of the Voters and survive.</p>

On immigration I would be very surprised if not stunned if public sentiment had moved one iota on this type of issue, for every one American waking up there is a thousands little indoctrinated  Trotsky&rsquo;s marching of the university production lines. <br>
Until the American universities are recaptured from the reds nothing is likely to change.  </p>

		<p>I truly hope that the people of Arizona have long memories.  IN fact, they don&rsquo;t have to remember back that far. All they have to do is remember back to the 2008 election year and maybe 2007 when John McCain was against building the fence, against installing additional National Guardsmen on the border and tried like hell, to get amnesty passed for the millions of illegals in this country.</p>
<p>This new John McCain is a farce.  And I would hope that the people of Arizona know that he&rsquo;s a liar and a fraud and that the minute he is re-elected, he will push for more amnesty, no fence and no additional troops on our southern border.</p>
