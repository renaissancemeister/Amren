			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thomas Lifson, American Thinker, May 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Arizona just acquired a poster boy for its policy of questioning people about their immigration status in the course of police investigations. Boston Fox 25 reports:<blockquote>A serious car crash involving a local lawmaker and a suspected illegal immigrant is threatening to reignite already heated debates about immigration on Beacon Hill, according to police reports obtained by FOX25.</p>
<p>State Rep. Mike Moran of Brighton was rear-ended by a suspected illegal immigrant this week. The suspect was wearing a Mexican costume at the time of the crash where he slammed into Moran at 60 mph.</p>
<p>The suspect, 27-year-old Isaias Naranjo, was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol, leaving the scene of an accident and driving without a valid license. According to the report, when told of the serious charges he would be facing, he just laughed.</p>
<p>Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick, a close associate of Barack Obama, three years ago revoked an executive order of former Gov. Mitt Romney, which gave state police the power to investigate immigration violations.<br>
</blockquote>Naranjo, apparently aware of Gov. Patrick&rsquo;s actions, averred that he was going back to &#8220;my country&#8221; (Mexico) so nothing would happen.</p>
<p>Donald Douglas of American Power has looked into Moran&rsquo;s voting record, and finds him a big supporter of illegals:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I wonder if Moran is reconsidering his positions? {snip}<br>

		<p>I always figured it would take one of the &#8220;virtuous and enlightened&rsquo; to get hurt before the threat from the illegals would be realized. I wonder if this idiot has come to the conclusion that his family members could have been in the car when he was hit.I hope the guy gets permanent injuries that keep him in pain for the rest of his life. That would be justice to the victims that his policies have caused.</p>

		<p>What am I to say as a resident of pathetically-liberal Massachusetts? Our ultra left-wing  black governor Deval Partick recinded a measure Mitt Romney enacted right before leaving office that would have let the state police enforce federal immigration laws in the state. On the other hand, Deval&rsquo;s opponent Kerry Healey supported the executive order from the get-go, and despite her being a very liberal Republican that supported gay civil-unions and abortion rights, she ended up losing to him. The state&rsquo;s voters were just too mesmerizied by Deval&rsquo;s catchy, feel-good rhetoric to pass him up. Now it seems many are having buyer&rsquo;s remorse. And of course my state continuously re-elected Teddy Kennedy to the senate, despite his utterly despicable and treasonous role in the passing of the Immigration act of 1965 and his coddling of illegal aliens. In short, having this prominent &#8216;Massachusetts liberal&rsquo; enjoy a taste of the mayhem these immigrant invaders are causing will do some good, but will enough of my fellow bay staters (finally) come to their senses on this issue, i don&rsquo;t know&hellip;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but this is the funniest story I&rsquo;ve read this week so far. Talk about karma! Yes, because of YOU and liberals just like you Morgan, this illegal laughs in your face knowing you have done everything in your power to protect him. Morgan got EXCATLY what he deserved. Welcome to the real world buddy, where we average joes deal with this sort of thing every day.</p>

		<p>I predict that Moran will not change his position.  He&rsquo;ll say something like &#8220;people get rear-ended all the time; it could just as well have been a U.S. citizen&#8221;.  If it happens two or three more times to him, then he might consider changing his position.  Those leftists are so predictable.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Injured state rep is &mdash; or perhaps &ldquo;was&rdquo; &mdash; big supporter of illegals&rsquo; &ldquo;rights.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Of course Deval Patrick is favorable to ALL non-whites, because he&rsquo;s an anti-white black, elected by the same kinds of fools that elected the community organizer.  </p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m wondering if this &#8220;injured&#8221; congressman was the same kind of person who supports Obama.  If so, he got what he voted for, so he has no complaint.</p>

		<p>A defense - a slight one, a reluctant one, but nevertheless a defense - of Rep. Mike Moran; from a conservative citizen of Massachusetts.<br>
Mike Moran is probably of Irish descent, as are most of the finest citizens of the Bay State. Irish kids come over here to visit. Then, they find out, like so many of the Irish before them, that they really like this country. They are staying with family; they find a job; perhaps they fall in love with an American; they overstay their visas: they are now illegal.<br>
These young Irish kids speak English; they have at least a high-school education; many of them have a trade; and they don&rsquo;t carry weird diseases like Dengue Fever. <br>
Oh. Did I also mention that they are White?<br>
The problem is that, because of political correctness, we &#8220;can&rsquo;t&#8221; give special consideration to White European immigrants anymore, no matter how much more valuable their immigration would be.<br>
Of course, this Irish illegal immigration blinds people in Massachusetts. All they see is the the young kid from Cork or Kerry tending bar or bussing tables, hustling  like  our grandparents did. They don&rsquo;t see the the murders committed  by Mexicans in Arizona.<br>
Perhaps now, Rep. Moran will have a fuller picture of the invasion crisis than he had before the accident. Perhps, he will come to the conclusion that I reluctantly have, that, if the only way to keep out the Mexicans is to keep out the Irish, then that&rsquo;s the way it has to be. </p>
<p>At least not yet,or, in Rep. Moran&rsquo;s case, not until now.</p>

		<p>When the rich and powerful begin to feel the full brunt of criminal conduct from the dregs of society, the hammer will fall.  D.C. pols have already started to experience muggings and at least one carjacking and one murder (Chaundra Levy) involving themselves, their families, and their staffs.  Illegals, not understanding the law  &mdash;  or not caring about it  &mdash;  seem even more brazen than homegrown criminals.</p>

&gt;&gt;Isaias Naranjo, was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol, leaving the scene of an accident and driving without a valid license. According to the report, when told of the serious charges he would be facing, he just laughed.</p>
<p>Hispanics drive while drunk at a higher percentage than the rest of the population. The problem has become so bad in North Carolina, for example, that the state highway patrol has created an &#8220;Hispanic Affairs Liaison&#8221; who speaks Spanish and can therefore advise against drunk driving in the native tongue of the drunk drivers. </p>
<p>The problem, we&rsquo;re told, should be attributed to &#8220;cultural differences and limited knowledge of U.S. laws.&#8221; </p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll not be laughing like Isaias Naranjo if you read the following two sobering articles. </p>

		<p>Until we find a way to magically conjure more land and resources from thin air, We should all be against all forms of immigration. I thought the nation was full up at 250 million, what are we thinking? A billion is better? Haiti, Brazil, India anyone?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a chart of U.S. oil imports; <br>
https://tinyurl.com/3xd3eat<br>
Recall that the movers and shakers were going to fix our dependence on imported oil in 1975 with the creation of the Department of Energy. The only reduction in those 35 years came during the recession of 1980-83. </p>
<p>Soon we&rsquo;ll be begging people to leave, just like Mexico, China and India.</p>

		<p>After reading this story, it reminded me when an illegal ran a red light and t-boned our family Suburban.  Luckily no one was hurt.  At that time our controversial law didn&rsquo;t exist, so they simply issued a ticket for the traffic violation and no proof of insurance nor drivers license!  Yeah, you guessed it, he never showed up at court and we ended up paying for the repair through higher premiums!  </p>

		<p>Best news all week.<br>
We should capatalize on it and set up a webpage, call it &#8216;La Sanctuaria&rsquo; and post these traitors home addresses as &#8216;Sanctuary locations&rsquo; where illegal invaders are welcome for some respite from their weary flight from justice. Then, the politicals can decide if they want a bunch of &#8216;undocumented&rsquo; criminals on their lawn or parading through their home.</p>
<p>On a side note, did anyone notice the irony when the news reported the White House having problems with &#8216;undocumented guests&rsquo; showing up while the One coddled up to Calderon? Talk about Irony, American Citizens denied entry to the One&rsquo;s house while the topic of conversation was Arizona&rsquo;s attempt to keep uninvited slime out of our nation.</p>

		<p>#21-Azombre-Same here. A couple of weeks ago, an illegal ran a red light, one that had been red a long time. He hit my mom head on, luckily she wasn&rsquo;t injured. He couldn&rsquo;t speak english, had no driver&rsquo;s liscense and all the police could do was give him a ticket for running the red. They didn&rsquo;t even give him a ticket for driving without a liscense, something Americans are arrested for often here in Texas. Now she&rsquo;s had to buy another car and is out 4000 dollars. His insurnce company, a Latino run one that should have never given an illegal insurance, didn&rsquo;t bother with her. </p>

		<p>   A few years ago, my cousin&rsquo;s wife was killed in a car wreck by a couple of illegal aliens. They pulled their truck out into the oncoming traffic while stuck on a bridge during p.m. rush hour. They hit her car head-on, she died instantly. <br>
   Of course, they slimed back over the border right away. The landscaping company that employed them paid my cousin a huge cash settlement. Never saw hide nor hair of the mestizo pair afterward.</p>
