			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gerri Peev, Daily Mail (London), May 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Andy Burnham yesterday became the latest candidate in the Labour leadership battle to admit that his party had ignored voters&rsquo; concerns about immigration.</p>
<p>The former health secretary said their worries over the influx of migrants had, for him, been the biggest issue at the General Election.</p>
<p>The party made little mention of it in its manifesto and Gordon Brown denounced Labour supporting grandmother Gillian Duffy as a &#8216;bigot&rsquo; when she mentioned her concerns.</p>
<p>Former home secretary David Blunkett yesterday endorsed Mr Burnham in the race to succeed Mr Brown.</p>
<p>Mr Burnham said: &#8216;I think our problem on immigration  &mdash;  and it was for me anyway clearly the biggest issue at the election  &mdash;  was the sense that we weren&rsquo;t talking about it, so that some people felt we were either in denial or just didn&rsquo;t want to talk about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He told the BBC&rsquo;s Andrew Marr Show that there were some parts of the country that had changed very rapidly. Labour should have been addressing those concerns &#8216;other-wise we leave a vacuum and those with more sinister intentions come in and whip up fear and hatred&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Fellow contenders Ed Balls and Ed Miliband have both raised immigration during their opening salvoes of the leadership battle.</p>
<p>But they were rebuked for their comments by another contender, Diane Abbott.</p>
<p>The veteran Left-winger said she did not like the way that the other candidates were discussing immigration, adding that it did not lose Labour the election.</p>
<p>&#8216;The black and white working class are moaning about Eastern European immigrants,&rsquo; she told Sky News Sunday Live.</p>
<p>&#8216;It&rsquo;s a proxy for a lack of security on jobs and housing.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It&rsquo;s very dangerous to scapegoat immigrants in a recession.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She suggested reviving the Lib Dems&rsquo; plans to give an amnesty to illegal immigrants who had lived in Britain for a decade or more.</p>
<p>Miss Abbott played down speculation that she had no chance of winning, pointing to a YouGov poll which had her as the second most popular leadership candidate.</p>
<p>The survey for The Sunday Times showed David Miliband has 23 per cent support among voters, Miss Abbott 9 per cent, Ed Miliband 8 per cent, Mr Balls 6 per cent, Mr Burnham 4 per cent, and John McDonnell 2 per cent.</p>
<p>Labour&rsquo;s new leader will be announced at the party&rsquo;s conference in the autumn.<br>

		<p>For the record, Diane Abbott is a black woman.  She is probably in the same class as a Shiela Jackson Lee.  I want Labour to pick her so that they&rsquo;ll never win another election again, and to thumb their nose at David Cameron, who wanted his party to elevate so many blacks.</p>

<p>There should be no black working class in the UK.</p>
<p>That being said if the non-white population of the UK were sent packing think how better the UK would be.  Less crime.  Less environmental degradation.  A more cohesive culture both within the Kingdom as a whole and certainly within each constituent part (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland).  Less unemployment.  Less welfare payments.<br>

		<p>No offense to the Brits but I am not exactly certain it is unreasonable for Labour to have done this.  It simply is not an issue Brits (and by Brits I mean WHITE Brits) care about. The recent election made that pretty clear.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the BNP has more people voting for it then ever before.  But it&rsquo;s nowhere near where it should be.  Most people in britain know who the BNP are.  And they know the main issue is anti-immigration.  And they have at least some understanding that immigration=violence in their communities.  They know that the BNP is a legitimate alternative.  Their vote would not simply be wasted on people with no chance of getting elected.  In other words, they had an opportunity to do something about this problem in a very really and very direct manner and KNEW they had that opportunity.</p>
<p>They simply did not care.  If they cared, the BNP (or maybe that other anti-immigration party) would have had sweeping victories all over the place.  If the people don&rsquo;t care&hellip;.why should it matter if Britains political parties try to move focus off it as a political issue?</p>
<p>I know that if a major third party came to the attention of US voters that made anti-immigration the main focus, it would have huge popularity.  If it crossed the threshold of being a legitimate contender (like the BNP did in Britain) it would absolutely destroy both the democrats and the republicans.  People in the US WANT such a thing desperately.  But big money keeps a third party anywhere near challenging either of the two major parties.  There is no US version of the BNP.  If there were, people here would jump at the chance to put them in power.  Maybe, sometime in the near future, we will get that chance.  If we do, I&rsquo;m there for that&hellip;.ALOT of people will be there for that.  MOST Americans will be there for that, I think.</p>
<p>Britains had that chance&hellip;.yawned and turned the TV back on.  They do not care and cannot complain if thier political parties reflect that.  </p>
<p>For the small number that do care&hellip;.well, consider coming here instead.  Yes&hellip;.Obama is a national embrassment to us.  But just watch.  A year from now, he&rsquo;ll be sitting in a prison cell somewhere after being impeached in disgrace.  And some REAL change will be the focus of American politics.  </p>
<p>Consider coming here and being a part of that.</p>

		<p>The British Labour party hasn&rsquo;t just ignored people&rsquo;s concerns about immigration. Like the Democrat party here in the US they have actively engaged in smearing and slandering people as &#8220;racist&#8221; or &#8220;bigots&#8221; for daring to even bring up these concerns.</p>

<p>And where in the West do they EVER listen to their citizens?</p>
<p>Right before every nation in history disintegrated, ignoring the populace was right at the top of the list of failings.</p>
<p>The West is following the same script in more ways than just this.</p>

<p>Speaking of, I thought it was a practical joke at first, but the Daily Mail confirms:  Nick Griffin will be stepping down as party leader in 2013, or at least before the next scheduled elections.  (That is, if you don&rsquo;t think one will be held earlier, as the marriage made in Hades between Cameron and Clegg falls apart.)</p>
<p>This could be great news, or it could be horrible news.  The BNP could be embroiled in a power struggle, or it could get the Next Great Thing.  What I fear is that it will get another Nick Griffin, very marketable but with too many internal enemies.  Or someone whose mouth runs ahead of his brain.</p>

		<p>To Anonymous @ #3:</p>
<p>The last British General Election was rigged.</p>
<p>R-I-G-G-E-D.</p>
<p>Got it?</p>
<p>There was widespread electoral fraud through the use of postal votes, mainly in constituencies with a large Muslim population and a dwindling indigenous one. (Guess which party the Muslims vote for. Clue: It isn&rsquo;t the BNP.)</p>
<p>The flimsy cardboard ballot-boxes that have recently replaced far sturdier and tamper-free ones are now in general use.</p>
<p>Non-whites were bussed into previous BNP strongholds like Barking and Dagenham, and actively encouraged to vote. (I think you can guess who for now.)</p>
<p>There is also constant anti-BNP propaganda in the mainstream media.</p>
<p>Please, please do not blame the victims - i.e. the indigenous British (and mainly English) white working class. (After all, whose side are you really on?)</p>
<p>Sadly, I think that electoral politics is a busted flush in Britain. It chills me to the bone to contemplate it, but civil war is now inevitable.</p>
