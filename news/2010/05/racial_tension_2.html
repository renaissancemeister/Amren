<h1>Racial Tension Mounts at South Bay High School</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KTVU-TV (Oakland), May 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Tensions mounted at a Bay Area high school Thursday, a day after five students whipped up emotions by wearing t-shirts depicting red, white and blue American flags on Cinco de Mayo.</p>
<p>A group of 50-60 Latino students walked out of classes at Morgan Hill&rsquo;s Live Oak High early Thursday, marching to city hall and rallying to show their support for a school official.</p>
<p>That unidentified assistant principal had ordered the students who wore t-shirts with American flags on Cinco de Mayo to either go home or turn the shirts inside out.</p>
<p>&#8220;We knew it was Cinco de Mayo. But we just came to show our flag,&#8221; said student Dominic Maciel, one of the flag wearing students. &#8220;We didn&rsquo;t mean anything by it. We didn&rsquo;t want to start anything. Nothing like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Four of the five students who wore American flags or patriotic colors on campus later attended a meeting with the superintendent of the Morgan Hill Unified School District Wednesday night.</p>
<p>They were facing unexcused absences because they chose to go home early rather than take off what they were wearing.</p>
<p>&#8220;They said we had to wear our t-shirts inside out and then we could go back to class and we said no,&#8221; said student Anthony Caravalho. &#8220;It would be disrespectful to the flag by hiding it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Daniel Galli, another student who was reprimanded for wearing a US flag, described what he was told by school administration.</p>
<p>&#8220;He said &#8216;If you wear it on any other day, it&rsquo;s fine; but just because it&rsquo;s today you can&rsquo;t wear it,&rsquo;&#8221; Galli said. &#8220;His exact words.&#8221;</p>
<p>Galli said he was told it was inappropriate to wear the shirt because &#8220;it&rsquo;s supposed to be a Mexican Day and we were supposed to honor them.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re not mad that they wore their stuff,&#8221; said student Galli. &#8220;But we&rsquo;re mad that we were asked to change our stuff, but they could still wear their stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some Mexican-American students KTVU spoke with said they thought wearing red, white and blue on Cinco de Mayo was disrespectful.</p>

<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t like seeing the French flag either.</p>
<p>Honestly, an American student can&rsquo;t wear a shirt which bears the American flag because it may offend the Mexicans? Welcome to the new, multi-cultural society in which we are mandated to celebrate diversity, unless it&rsquo;s our own culture. And as a side issue, how can one be a &#8220;Mexican-American&#8221;? You&rsquo;re either pregnant or you&rsquo;re not. Last time I checked, neither, unfortunately, is an ethnicity although increasingly, being an &#8220;American&#8221; means nothing anymore, at least to the liberals. Why isn&rsquo;t Mexico being required to celebrate diversity? Why is it only the white nations? I wonder how many &#8220;American-Mexicans&#8221; there are down there.</p>
<p>In a perverted way, this is a de facto liberal admission that Mexicans can&rsquo;t unify under the US flag. That&rsquo;s a step in the right direction, I guess.</p>

		<p>I think the kids should have been told to take off the shirts simply because there was an American flag on them. Tee-shirts should be reserved for beer and alcohol logos and such witty reparte as &#8220;I`m with stupid!&#8221; <br>
 I believe the flag code prohibits such wearing or utilization of the stars and stipes for advertising or on items of personal adornment. As a personal  aside I think I`m long past the point of celebarting the American flag in any way shape or form.On the 5th of May or even the Fourth of July&hellip;</p>

<p>Well, if they think it&rsquo;s &#8220;disrespectful,&#8221; then it must <i>be</i> disrespectful, right?</p>
<p>I remember a Diversity Seminar we were all forced to attend at my company, back in the Nineties.  We were told with a straight face that what a White person actually <i>does</i> is irrelevant; what really matters is what the nonWhite <i>perceives</i> the White to have done or said.</p>
<p>Apparently that theory is still in full vigor today.<br>

<p>Dominics&rsquo; government has thrown his generation under the bus. Dominic may have been expressing a now mythical pride in America and her flag but it is now just a myth, a relic of a not-too-distant past.</p>
<p>Our hope is with Dominic and his friends. Will they be on the front line fighting for what is now a mythical America? </p>
<p>Heaven help them. Our government wont.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s disrespectful is sporting the Mexican flag on US soil.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s quite apparent that not only are Whites not allowed to be so-called &#8220;racists&#8221;; it is also apparent that they cannot express even simple patriotism otherwise they will still be attacked.  These minor events are just a precursor to what lies ahead.  Whites must lay down and die; that is their only choice otherwise they will be met with opposition everywhere and in everything that they do.  As a matter of fact even if we lay down and die, they&rsquo;ll still call us racists and we will still meet with attacks, both verbal and physical.  Whites must learn again how to fight for their rights or this will be our last century - and it will be our most painful one.</p>

		<p>There is no such thing as a Mexican-American.  Cinco de Mayo is not an American holiday or cultural event (with all due apologies to tequila worshiping college students).  When it is inappropriate to practice your own culture in your own country you no longer have a country.  That it is enforced, even promulgated by, Whites is a tragedy.<br>

This statement is the reason that all latinos, not just illegals, must be forced out of the USA.  And maybe we should send the White marxists with them.  Let&rsquo;s see how they like living in a real third world hispanic country.<br>

		<p>Arrrgh!! Just when I thought there was nothing more that can irritate me!</p>
<p>Starting next year, these high schoolers have inspired me to start a new tradition, starting May 5, 2011. I&rsquo;m going to start wearing the loudest, Uncle Sam looking, stars and stripes everywhere, shirt I can find.</p>
<p>Any Mexican that&rsquo;s offended can kindly get out of my country.</p>

		<p>Assimilation at its best!  If history proves correct (and it always does), words fly first, then bullets. Once Mexico believes it has the strength of numbers and force of will, they will not hesitate in demanding the return of the Southwest. </p>

		<p>That school official should be fired by the school board and barred from ever working in any U.S. school system, even as custodian or janitor. Furthermore, we as a society must clamp down hard on displays of foreign flags and on disrespect for our own national flag. I would also abolish all or most multi-lingualism in the public domain (and certainly the de facto 2nd-language status accorded Spanish), and seriously amend the laws governing naturalization, too: abolish the current (incorrect!) anchor-baby-enabling interpretation of the 14th amendment, and make newly-minted citizenships conditional (e.g. no government financial assistance rights for some decades, no first-amendment rights to publicly disrespect the country and its symbols, and an easy process to strip the citizenship in the event the person was deemed by a court to have violated his or her Oath of Allegiance.) <br>
 And, of course, restore country-of-origin quotas for accepting new immigrants   &mdash;   along the lines of the pre-1965 law. I would also bar non-favored-countries immigrants from bringing in any relatives (chain migration). Best of all would be if immigration from the third world were halted altogether. Nowadays, of course, that would also mean many citizens of first-world countries. For instance, immigration quota laws should define a &#8216;Briton&rsquo; or French person as someone who can produce records proving that ancestors of theirs resided in Europe prior to some cut-off year.  <br>
  Returning to this school, though: schools should be THE prime arena in our society where the steam-roller of immersion and assimilation (&#8216;melting pot&rsquo;) operates in full force. If not there, where?</p>

		<p>I can tell from the comments made in this story that no one (that is no white people) understands this yet.  <br>
White people have given their countries away.  Now that other races are taking over why can&rsquo;t you understand what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>Let me make it plain for you.  They will take from you EVERYTHING and give to you NOTHING.<br>
You can&rsquo;t fly a Nazi flag.  The Confederate flag is just another Nazi flag.  And SOON the Stars &amp; Stripes will be a Nazi flag too.  </p>
<p>You have been stupid for generations.  You are too stupid, even now, to understand that YOU ARE BEING REPLACED!  Too stupid to understand and too weak to fight back.  </p>
<p>If you need a clearer picture, look at S. Africa &amp; Zimbabwe.  <br>

		<p>The &#8220;unidentified assistant principal&#8221; reminds me of a social worker I encountered in the YMCA in a small town in the Allegheny mountains in Western Maryland.</p>
<p>The do-gooder-for-profit was counseling two adult black men who howled obscenties so loudly and for so long that they drowned out the TV viewing of the other men in the lounge.  When one white man politely requested that they &#8220;keep it down&#8221; both blacks stood and advanced on the white man, screaming &#8220;racist&#8221; and &#8220;you&rsquo;re wrong, not us.&#8221; The white man, who&rsquo;d had similar experience in the Government and knew the Y would side with the blacks and he&rsquo;d become homeless, retreated to his room.  One black followed him, shouted insults through his door and promised to have him &#8220;kicked out of the Y.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sure enough, the head of the Y encouraged the man to find lodging elsewhere.  When the man asked the counselor for support, the counselor, who had been present and heard it all, replied, &#8220;May I speak frankly?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said the now ex-resident of the YMCA, &#8220;that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m asking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;YOU SHOULDN&rsquo;T HAVE BEEN SO CONFRONTATIONAL,&#8221; replied the counselor.</p>
<p>P. S. The black, who was allowed to stay at the Y, was later arrested on several counts of possessing drugs and several other counts of intention to distribute.  It&rsquo;s a good bet he was also fencing stolen goods.</p>
<p>The States Attorney freed him on what&rsquo;s called a stet docket, which meant that if he wasn&rsquo;t arrested again within a year, his arrest record would be expunged.  The States Attorney sent him on his way with an avuncular pat on the back and refused to explain why he failed to prosecute.</p>
<p>At least one white man at the Y knew he was dealing, but said the black had done him favors so he didn&rsquo;t turn him in. </p>

<p>No,what&rsquo;s disrespectful is telling students that they can&rsquo;t wear their nation&rsquo;s flag in THEIR nation because it&rsquo;s a foreign holiday. This is unbelievable but not surprising.</p>

Way to go, Conrad!  You hit the nail on the head!  Whites the world over have been STUPID for far too long! Just look at who they adopt and help at all costs!  Africans and anyone that is NOT White!  And, no, Whites do not even know they are being replaced or maybe they do and are too cowardly to do something about it. They have no guts or glory any longer!  Braveheart, where are you?</p>

		<p>Cinco De Mayo is a minor event in Mexican history. But it has been pumped up by racist, imperialist reconquista Mexican agitators like La Raza to compete with America&rsquo;s Independence Day on the 4th of July. I have actually had people come up to me and ask what I was doing for Cinco De May, I responded &#8220;nothing, what does it have to with me or this country&#8221;?.</p>

		<p>I have been viewing the stories and comments awhile now to gain an understanding of the agenda here at AmRen.  Everything I have read is at least interesting and at times profound.  Think I&#8221;ll stick around for awhile.  In thinking about Conrad&rsquo;s (number 11) remarks, I have often wondered if there could be a place where White people could live, work and take care of themselves without so much interference.  A nice fantasy, until I realize that the &#8220;takers&#8221; of the world would just find a way to get in and, of course, would soon complain that they were being treated unfairly, demand handouts, and on and on &hellip;     </p>

		<p>Well, there you have it! Can it be any plainer?  These &#8220;New Americans&#8221; don&rsquo;t give a damn for the USA. How long long will it be until the actual rupture comes? I mean the formal break-up.  </p>
<p>In the meantime, <b>they are only with us so long as the welfare, the jobs, and the free benefits last.</b> That&rsquo;s the only attraction. We have to keep buying them off to keep the peace, shaky though it is. We&rsquo;re just a country of gringos, good only for the plucking.  When those goodies dry up, there will be chaos.  It will be hell. Just a matter of time!</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s going to meet their demands?  Whose family is going to go hungry   &mdash;   theirs or yours? (Not theirs if THEY can help it!)</p>
<p>When the dollar collapse?  When will Washington go broke? When will Japan and China refuse to lend us any more?<br>
Look at the riots going on in Greece right now. The Greek  government is bankrupt; pensions and salaries are being cut. There is no money! They are begging for a loan. They say Portugal may be next. When will it be our turn?   Eventually, it will be. That&rsquo;s inevitable. </p>
<p>But Greece and Portugal are small potatoes. And they don&rsquo;t have multiculturalism and racial minorities to deal with either.  When the USA falls, it will be spectacular. All the jackals will want a piece of the fallen giant.  I won&rsquo;t want to see it.</p>

		<p>Years ago, I put up a small American flag on my desk at work. the owner of the company ordered me to remove it. She said it might offend somebody. She was White, and a member of the &#8220;greatest generation&#8221; to use Brokaw&rsquo;s phrase. </p>

		<p>This is not an isolated incident.  A similar scenario unfolded at Salinas High School, where a young girl was told she could not wear clothing with an American flag on it on Cinco de Drinko.  Salinas is mentioned frequently on AmRen, as it has already been reconquista&rsquo;d and gives you a good glimpse of the future for the rest of Mexifornia, and eventually the USSA.</p>

		<p> &hellip; 12  &mdash;  Frank Keliher:   Your story about the YMCA rings very true.  I can identify with what you say.  After a fire destroyed the apt. bldg. where I lived,  I was forced to take a room at the &#8220;Y&#8221; for a while.  I found that it was run <i>BY</i> minorities <i>FOR</i> minorities. The mis-management was amazing. And the favoritism too.  The noise, especially, was intolerable,  and the lack of consideration for others. But to the management, that seemed perfectly normal, and any complaints were considered crank complaints at the least, if not downright racist.   If you complained, YOU were the one who was causing a problem.  Even white management groveled to the &#8220;minorities&#8221;  (who were actually the majority).  The place was full of ex-cons, welfare clients, junkies and AIDS cases. Overwhelmingly black, needless to say.  And it was run for THEIR benefit.</p>
<p>In many US cities, the old YMCA&rsquo;s that were put up around the 1920s were once magnificant buildings, but now they are slums. This is another great institution   &mdash;   like so many others   &mdash;   that has come under the control of minorities, to its ruin. </p>
<p>And, from what I understand, the Y<b>W</b>CA is under even more extreme leftist control than the YM.  It is entirely given over to &#8220;fighting racism&#8221; and &#8220;empowering wimyn&#8221;   &mdash;   just as doctrinaire Marxist as you can get.   [yes, that&rsquo;s a quote, it&rsquo;s the motto of the Berkeley YW in Boston] </p>

		<p>We need to celebrate the 30th of May, the signing of the treaty in which Mexico conceded it has lost the war and then ceded the Southwest to the United States.  This treaty of Guadelupe Hidalgo is a critical turning point in our country&rsquo;s history - it is when we became a continental power. It should be celebrated as such, and the commemoration of 5th May should be prohibited in all public forums.  For my part, the sad thing is there was I time I enjoyed celebrating the 5th of may. The Second Empire was appalling, and Napoleon III (aka Louie the Litte) well deserved getting his head handed to him for violating the Monroe Doctrine while the US was engaged in its great civil war. Now, that Mexico is invading the US, I can no longer in good conscience enjoy remembering Puebla. Sad.</p>

   First the last couple of years, I would wear a Napoleon victory tour T-shirt to work on May 5th. So far no one has gotten the joke. Maybe it is because the Puerto Ricans are complaining about this holiday. They hate it because they see it as a mexican holiday, not an american one.</p>

		<p>Why give them these red mongoloid ex-Asians the privlege of being called the white word Latino when this is simply the caucasoid European term for someone who speaks Latin which is the root tongue of Spanish or Hispanic and the language the original Book was written in with the Nicean conferences. </p>
<p>Mexicans refuse to acknowledge their real heritage and demand to be called Latin or Spanish aka Latino and Hispanic. </p>

		<p>Imagine that!  American students in America being told they could not wear American flags in an American school  &mdash;  but instead must kow-tow to foreigners and foreign flags that have more rights than they do.</p>
<p>I hope the boys with the American flag t-shirts remember this when the military recruitment letters arrive in the mail or if they see a military recruitment booth inside or outside of their school near graduation.</p>
<p>I  expect  this story goes to go viral  &mdash;  but it will have to be via talk radio and the Internet as the msm will not report this.</p>
<p>This shows how far we&rsquo;ve fallen as any non-White would have immediately alerted his advocacy group  &mdash;  NAACP, LaRaza, newly-formed Asian-advocacy groups, which in turn would have notified the ACLU, SPLC and ADL. </p>
<p>These groups would be out in full force today at the school, screaming about Nazi Racists, featured as the lead stories on CNN, MSNBC and all the other lefty networks.  There would be demands that the principal and AP be fired immediately, the five students expelled the entire school receive &#8216;diversity training&rsquo;, and full scholarships and money for all of the mexican students.   </p>
<p>Why weren&rsquo;t the mexican students told to be &#8216;tolerant&rsquo;, &#8216;sensitive&rsquo; and to &#8216;celebrate diversity&rsquo;?  Why weren&rsquo;t they told their &#8216;free&rsquo; educations, free lunches and breakfasts they have a &#8216;right&rsquo; to are paid for the US and not Mexico?</p>
<p>I noticed the students wearing the shirts are going to be counted as unexcused absences (meaning the teachers do not have to provide any make-up work).</p>
<p>Are the students who walked out in protest going to be charged with unexcused absences as well?</p>
<p>John &amp; Ken on 640 KFI were all over this story last night, this is from their web site:</p>

<p>The racist, non-White assistant principal was the one who demanded the boys turn the shirts inside out  &mdash;   with the principal&rsquo;s full support.</p>
<p>Later, the school board released a letter stating they did not support the actions of the school&rsquo;s administration.</p>
<p>Here is a photo of the boys with the American shirts:</p>
<p>http://www.kfiam640.com/pages/jk2010.html</p>
<p>Please e mail the AP, the school board and the principal and let it be known that we will not tolerate our American children being treated like second class citizens in favor of foreign students and demand that foreign flags and holidays be banned from school campuses.</p>
<p>Or, better yet, get your kids out of the public schools and homeschool them if possible.</p>

<p>Cinco de Mayo isn&rsquo;t a Mexican holiday, either, lol.   NO ONE IN THE REAL MEXICO cares about it.  It&rsquo;s one of those Foundation-manufactured holidays, sort of like how card companies created &#8220;mother&rsquo;s day.&#8221;   From wiki:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;It is celebrated primarily in the state of Puebla and in the United States.[4][5][6][7] While Cinco de Mayo sees limited significance and celebration nationwide in Mexico, the date is observed nationwide in the United States&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s best if people &#8220;consider the source,&#8221; and quit getting so bogged down in the minutiae.   This is ONLY AN AMERICAN &#8220;holiday,&#8221; lol.    It was probably chosen to coincide with &#8220;May day,&#8221; even as many labor day parades may be canceled later for lack of public funds.   It is to generate buzz on communist holiday times that already exist.</p>
<p>These kids MUST NOT BE REAL MEXICANS, if they don&rsquo;t know that, lol.  Or &#8220;children of the revolution,&#8221; born after when this was created, as supposed &#8216;tabula rasas&rsquo; on which some new history can just be grafted on, like a Maoist re-ed program.</p>

		<p>By their own logic, if it&rsquo;s disrespectful to show an American flag on Cinco de Mayo day, it&rsquo;s disrespectful to have a Cinco de Mayo day in America. Remove the first case of intolerable &#8216;disrespect&rsquo; and there&rsquo;s no need to remedy the second. In other words, if you respect their sentiments, then it is obvious their hearts are in the right place yet they have their priorities backwards, and must be forced to live up to their own ideals. Fortunately, their ideals include a willingness to use force and coercion&hellip; and the gentle tongue of chastisement.   </p>

		<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s quite apparent that not only are Whites not allowed to be so-called &ldquo;racists&rdquo;; it is also apparent that they cannot express even simple patriotism otherwise they will still be attacked. These minor events are just a precursor to what lies ahead. Whites must lay down and die; that is their only choice otherwise they will be met with opposition everywhere and in everything that they do. As a matter of fact even if we lay down and die, they&rsquo;ll still call us racists and we will still meet with attacks, both verbal and physical. Whites must learn again how to fight for their rights or this will be our last century - and it will be our most painful one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Awakened has made a profound and correct point. We whites will be harrassed and harried unto the grave if we don&rsquo;t learn to fight back. Mexicans, blacks, asians, whoever will continue to push the envelope with this kind of behavior unless and until we whites fight back. </p>
<p>Young whites are brought up to be tolerant and forgiving - &#8220;turn the other cheek&#8221;&hellip; and so forth. That won&rsquo;t do in the brave new world where our own elected representatives have turned into the enablers of our oppression so that they can win votes and keep their cushy benefits. </p>

		<p>Cinco de Mayo has become an ethnic holiday in the same vein as St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day or Columbus Day. I don&rsquo;t have a problem with that. I enjoy tequila as much as the next guy.</p>
<p>As far as this incident at South Bay High School goes, I have questions about it that the article doesn&rsquo;t answer. They have to do with WHY these white kids put on the American flag shirts. I see two possible reasons, and each reason seems okay with me.</p>
<p>#1 The first possibility is that either consciously or unconsciously these white kids sense that they are being dispossessed in their own country. They are reacting to the &#8220;mexicanization&#8221; of California that they have to deal with everyday. If this is how they feel, then Cinco de Mayo might likely feel like they&rsquo;re having their faced rubbed into their own dispossession. It may very well be that these flag wearing kids are feeling every bit as alienated and disrespected as the latino kids.</p>
<p>#2 The other possibility is that these white kids are pulling a prank, and are deliberately tweaking the noses of the latino kids. This seems to be the line that most people are taking - the white kids are making fun of the latinos.</p>
<p>My response is: so what? Since when has it become illegal to offend someone? I see  and hear stuff that offends me all the time. But big deal, I can handle it, I don&rsquo;t need to run off to any thought police and whine to them to protect me (even if there were any thought police that were sympathetic to the feelings of a white male, which there aren&rsquo;t).</p>
<p>The PC thought police would say that as minorities these latino kids deserve to go to a school free from a climate of &#8220;hate.&#8221; My response is that no, your delicate sensibilities don&rsquo;t trump everyone else&rsquo;s rights to free speech, sorry. </p>
<p>I have no problem with the celebration of Cinco de Mayo, nor do I have any problem with a group of kids teasing  another group by wearing t-shirts. I draw the line at violence, of course.</p>

You&rsquo;re right. But (and I hate to say this) we have offered them every incentive and inducement to lure them to come here.  That is to say, our politicians  and churchmen and business men have done so.  THEY are responsible.  More souls, more bodies, more producers and consumers, more voters!  It&rsquo;s basically their fault. We should be blaming our own mainly. The Mexicans just took what was offered. If you offer a starving dog a bone, you can&rsquo;t blame him for taking it.</p>

		<p>Why do we allow celebration of a foregn holiday?  This school official should be fired.  Kids who want to show respect for our flag should be allowed to wear shirts that show that respect any time they wish.</p>

		<p>I think its absolutely DISGUSTING that we are encouraged to celebrate Cinco de Mayom in America. It has nothing to do with race, its just that why should any Americans be celebrating a holiday that is based on the military triumph of Mexico (a former enemy)over France (a former ally)?! If it were more culturally-based, like St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, then I could understand Mexican-Americans celebreating it, but as it stands it is completely un-American to celebrate this silly holiday. Cpuldn&rsquo;t Mexicans just celebrate an important saint&rsquo;s day as their ethnic/cultural holiday? And not ask us to celebrate it with them?</p>

		<p>Hispanics and blacks are burdened with the delusion that respect from others is mandatory.  </p>
<p>This bizarre notion is tied to the ludicrous self-esteem mantra they learn in government schools.  </p>
<p>Respect is something that must be earned and can never be demanded.  </p>
<p>And legitimate self-esteem is the child of self-respect which is born of self-discipline.  </p>
<p>Hispanics and blacks lack the intelligence to comprehend these simple facts.  </p>
<p>This is why they will never be respected by those who are more intelligent and better disciplined than they are&hellip;</p>

		<p>We have another neighbor (which has no designs on us).  How many Americans &#8220;celebrate&#8221; Canada Day?    How many even know when it is?</p>
<p>And what about all the other republics of the Western Hemisphere?  So why all this hoopla over Cinco de Mayo?  Why just Mexico?</p>
