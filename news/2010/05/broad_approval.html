<h1><a href="https://people-press.org/report/613/arizona-immigration-law">Broad Approval for New Arizona Immigration Law</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press, May 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fully 73% say they approve of requiring people to produce documents verifying their legal status if police ask for them. Two-thirds (67%) approve of allowing police to detain anyone who cannot verify their legal status, while 62% approve of allowing police to question people they think may be in the country illegally.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press, conducted May 6-9 among 994 adults, finds that Democrats are evenly split over Arizona&rsquo;s new immigration law: 45% approve of the law and 46% disapprove. However, majorities of Democrats approve of two of the law&rsquo;s principal provisions: requiring people to produce documents verifying legal status (65%) and allowing police to detain anyone unable to verify their legal status (55%).</p>
<p>Republicans overwhelmingly approve of the law and three provisions tested. Similarly, among independents there is little difference in opinions of the new Arizona law (64% approve) and its elements, which are viewed positively.</p>
<p>Young people are less supportive of the Arizona immigration law than are older Americans. Fewer than half (45%) of those younger than 30 approve of the new law while 47% disapprove. Majorities of older age groups  &mdash;  including 74% of those 65 and older  &mdash;  approve of the law.</p>
<p>However, even most young people approve of requiring people to produce documents verifying their legal status; 61% approve of this element of the law while 35% disapprove. Larger percentages of older age groups support this provision.</p>
<p><b>Most Disapprove of Obama on Immigration</b></p>
<p>{snip} Just 25% approve of the way Obama is handling the issue, while more than twice as many (54%) disapprove. That is {snip} down slightly from last November (31%).</p>
<p>In the current survey, 76% of Republicans disapprove of Obama&rsquo;s handling of immigration policy, while just 8% approve. Independents disapprove of Obama&rsquo;s job on the issue by more than two-to-one (57% to 25%). Even among Democrats, as many disapprove (38%) as approve (37%) of the way he is handling the issue, while a quarter (25%) offer no opinion.</p>

		<p>I think most people overall, and most people that support SB 1070, think that law enforcement already had these powers.  It&rsquo;s like after 9/11, when the Federal government expanded the use of Air Marshalls, plain clothes and armed, onto most flights:  Most people I talked to thought that armed and plain clothes Air Marshals were already on most or all domestic flights, which they obviously were not.</p>

All the news networks have been doing stories on the Arizona law. They all follow the same template of concern for criminal aliens. At the end of each report, the anchor makes a personal comment (subliminal editorial) about this being a shame and hurting (criminal alien) families.</p>
<p>They selectively interview angry white residents to highlight how irrational and filled with hatred and fear they are. There&rsquo;s very little balance or in-depth reporting about WHY this law was needed and passed. To the media, this is about the irrational hate and fear of whites. To white residents living through this invasion, it&rsquo;s about regaining control of their lives and economy.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Just 25% approve of the way Obama is handling the issue&#8221;</p>
<p>We can assume that the Black population if asked, &#8220;Do you approve of the way Obama is handling X?&#8221; will respond with &#8220;Yes&#8221; at a rate of at least 90 percent, regardless of what X represents.  Also, let&rsquo;s assume that Blacks are 12 percent of the general population and further that they are proportionally represented in this survey.</p>
<p>It can be shown, then, that only 16 percent all of non-Blacks approve of Obama&rsquo;s handling of immigration, which is a remarkably low figure.<br>

<p>That says something about their respect for the concept of Majority Rule.  So much for democracy!  The Left likes it only when it agrees with them and goes their way.   They have no tolerance for Majority Rule when it disagrees.</p>

		<p>I hope that every American, regardless of where he lives, will stop and examine his conscience about this and other related incidents.  This Nation was founded by men of many nations and backgrounds.  It was founded on the principle that all men are created equal, and that the rights of every man are diminished when the rights of one man are threatened.  All of us ought to have the right to be treated as he would wish to be treated, as one would wish his children to be treated, but this is not the case.</p>
<p>I know the proponents of this law say that the majority approves of this law, but the majority is not always right.  Would women or non-whites have the vote if we listen to the majority of the day, would the non-whites have equal rights (and equal access to churches, housing, restaurants, hotels, retail stores, schools, colleges and yes water fountains) if we listen to the majority of the day?  We all know the answer, a resounding, NO!</p>
<p>Today we are committed to a worldwide struggle to promote and protect the rights of all who wish to be free.  In a time of domestic crisis men of good will and generosity should be able to unite regardless of party or politics and do what is right, not what is just popular with the majority.  Some men comprehend discrimination by never have experiencing it in their lives, but the majority will only understand after it happens to them.</p>

		<p>What I find appalling is the OVERT USE OF BLACKMAIL (for that is what it is, at base) by leftist, liberal, and sexually perverted special interest groups to FORCE AZ to their way of thinking&hellip; and doing it, as if ANY OF THEM had a moral leg to stand on!</p>
<p>What I also find appalling is that NO ONE in the Conservative wing (Tea Party, White Nationalist, Southern rights afficionados) are mounting a &#8216;Let&rsquo;s support AZ, and vacation in the Grand Canyon for AZ and AZ tourism&rsquo;  sort of unified effort of solidarity, in the wake of Black fraternities canceling their reservations, boycotts from liberal looniebins like  LA, SF, and Boston, on down to small non-entities like the Mayor of St. Paul, MN.</p>

		<p>I would love to see a TV news story about Americans living illegally in Mexico and the problems that they have.<br>
  <br>
I&rsquo;m not talking about blond, blue-eyed surfers who have overstayed their tourista card limits.  No, I&rsquo;d like to learn about the grown-up &#8216;anchor babies&rsquo; who were USA-born in the 1980s from illegal immigrants from Mexico.  Tell us, Ms. Perky NewsWoman, about the people who are for all purposes, except passport color, Mexican.  That&rsquo;s a lot of people, I understand, so concentrate on the ones that dropped out of school,are illiterate in all languages, know no grammar of either Spanish or English, and no skills desperately needed by their new Mexican neighbors.   </p>
<p>How are they doing?  Are their kids, all ten of them, getting focused minority counseling in school, along with health care and daily lunch?  Do the police ignore them rather than risk a career-damaging citation for &#8216;profiling&rsquo;?  How much of their income goes to pay off the local police to not demand to see their Mexican identity papers?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see some real video journalism for a change.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;Terry Stop&#8221; is settled law, upheld by the US Supreme Court. Anyone, upon resonable suspicion, can be stopped, briefly held, and patted down for weapons by a police officer that observes behaviour that leads him to believe a crime has or is about to be committed. If after a stop there is reasonable suspicion that you are in violation of Federal law ( illegal entry into the US )you go to jail and are deported. If you travel to Mexico, you better have a passport. I fully support arresting and deporting illegal aliens. I do not understand the problems claimed by opponents of the Arizona law. The claim of &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; is a red herring. Hispanic is one that speaks spanish, it&rsquo;s not a race. Hispanics from Spain, Cuba, Mexico, or Argentina can be white, black, brown, or red. But if they are in the US without documentation and permission they are all illegal. Identify, arrest, and deport them all.</p>

How would you know?  We have a media that is more state controlled than in the wildest dreams of Mao, Stalin or Kim Jong Il.</p>
<p>A handful of cranks in the worst of the worst bastions of liberalism pose such boycotts.  Meanwhile, the rank and file, even among liberals, even among non-whites, overwhelmingly support AZ.  The former gets everyday coverage.  The latter is lucky to get any coverage.  State after state is preparing to copy AZ.  Did that magically happen overnight?  No.  The vast majority of the US population is getting behind AZ and most likely preparing to severely punish those trying to boycott them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not &#8220;on the news&#8221; is all.</p>

It reflects the conventional wisdom that illegal immigration has virtually no real world consequences and should be thought of solely as a test of the morality of white folks, exposing who are the nice white people and who are the not nice white people.</p>

		<p>Two issues: <br>
1. Equality under the law which means that no one is above the law. The American people have informed Presidents of that fact.<br>
2. Martin Luther King Jr. inspired us to &#8220;judge by the content of their character and not by the color of their skin.&#8221; Well, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m against illegal immigration, because an illegal immigrant is a law breaker, a liar and a thief by definition.</p>

		<p>I am amazed at the liberal types who don&rsquo;t approve of this challenge of Illegal Aliens in Arizona. I&rsquo;d like to ask you people why it&rsquo;s okay to let someone who does not belong here to take over jobs unemployed Americans should be working. Why do you think unemployment is so high? Well, It&rsquo;s because corporations are giving American jobs to illegals. </p>
<p>Anyway If your stupid enough to think American corporations are going to allow amnesty for illegals (and end corporate slave labor in the process) your wrong.<br>
Why don&rsquo;t you hand your job over to an unreliable alien? </p>

Agreed. They are all for democracy   &mdash;   when it goes their way, but not when it goes against them.   That&rsquo;s when they resort to arm-twisting.  Instead of accepting the popular decision and leaving it alone, they turn to other means to get their way.<br>
 <br>
At bottom, they have no respect for the vote - nor  for the popular will. Lefties may march in the streets and shout, &#8220;Power to the people!&#8221;  But that doesn&rsquo;t include you.  They are convinced that they know better than you do.  And it&rsquo;s their way or no way.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sort of bemused by the fact that hardly anyone is pointing out that the United States has the most liberal immigration policy in the world, and that illegal immigrants almost anywhere else in the world are summarily thrown out on their ear. Why should the United States be held to a different standard than, for instance, Mexico?</p>

		<p>Any fool of a nation must be able to control its borders. AZ is right to insist the Federal Government do its job or get out of the way. We all know the influx millions of illegals has been intentional policy for decades by the US ruling elite which has been trying to dissolve the US into a North American Union of Mexico, the US and Canada. The illegals are being used to facilitate this dissolution of our republic. Americans do not want a NAU. We want our republic back and we are going to get it back  &mdash;  one way or another.</p>

		<p>From what I&rsquo;ve read (outside of the corporate news media slanted stories), is that the people of AZ are backing this law because of the issues created by illegal immigration   &mdash;   drug trafficking, kidnapping, violence, car theft, etc, not to mention the financial burden of providing housing, schooling and medical for the influx of people that either can&rsquo;t find work or only find jobs that pay wages so low they cannot support themselves.  Where I live in FL we had a huge influx of illegal aliens several years ago, attracted by the housing boom.  Many local carpenters, roofers, etc lost jobs to these workers because they would work for as little as $5 an hour.  Mexican drug gangs also came into the area.  Our resort beach town now has a full time gang task force to deal with the violence, burglaries and home invasions as a result of 13 Mexican drug gangs operating in the area.  Why isn&rsquo;t the media talking about the issues that lead to the people of AZ saying enough is enough? </p>
<p>Why are people supporting illegal alien slave labor?  Because that is basically what corporations are doing by hiring these people illegally, without benefits, protections or decent wages.  </p>
<p>How can the United States be fighting a true &#8220;War on Terror&#8221; with open borders?  Does that make any sense that you must go through airport scanners that show your naked body to screeners but terrorists can walk across the borders to the south (and north) with little chance of being stopped?   I&rsquo;ve heard almost nothing about the security issues of open borders.</p>
<p>Either our country is truly fighting a war against terrorists and needs to seal all borders or we are being lied to and therefore the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan plus the secret war in Pakistan should end immediately.</p>

<p>No, the majority is not always right but with the Arizona law, they are. We have a right, if there is probable cause that someone is in this country illegally, to ask for their ID and proof of legality. We have the right to deport them, if they are here illegally. Every other country does this including Mexico.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;This Nation was founded by men of many nations and backgrounds&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Not True.</p>
<p>Equality is Equal Under The Law.  </p>
<p>The US Constitution was created by English-speaking White men seeking liberty.  It is not based on the tenets of the Iroquois Nation, nor is it a living document. This is not a proposition nation or a &#8216;nation built by immigrants&rsquo; as currently taught in school textbooks. Of the Founding Fathers:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;One was a shoemaker, surveyor, lawyer, jurist, lay theologian, and statesman. Two became president, one vice president. Over half were experienced in the legal profession. The majority were well off and, for their time, well educated. And when they came together in Philadelphia in 1787, they produced the framework for the most influential document in the history of the United States.</p>
<p>Yet, the original Framers of the U.S. Constitution didn&rsquo;t view themselves as demigods out to &#8216;invent&rsquo; a country. Instead they tackled the nuts and bolts of constitution building by relying on a shared philosophical legacy inherited from more than 1,000 years of British history and culture&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/2d764fp" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2d764fp</a></p>
<p>The US Constitution is written in English, not Spanish, German, French, Russia or Tagalog.  The Constitution was  &#8220;hammered out in a prolonged series of debates in Philadelphia between May and September 1787.&#8221;  These debates were conducted in English not in a myriad of languages; no translators were needed.</p>
<p>The Constitution was created by Whites &#8220;to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity&#8221;  meaning their WHITE descendants.</p>
<p>It was not created so uneducated, dirt-poor refugees from Africa or floods of illegal immigrants from Mexico claiming to &#8216;seek a better quality of life&rsquo; could come to this country as dependents living off of free White money. </p>
<p>John Jay &#8220;thanked Providence for giving &#8216;this one connected country to one united people, a people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language, professing the same religion, attached to the same principles of government, very similar in their manners and customs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>America was not created as a multi-cultural, polyglot nation.  It is not a nation built by or for immigrants.</p>
<p>The first federal naturalization law, the Naturalization Act of 1790, restricted American citizenship to &#8220;free white persons.&#8221;</p>
<p>You also state:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Today we are committed to a worldwide struggle to promote and protect the rights of all who wish to be free&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>This is not the job of the people of the United States. </p>
<p>The overseas wars the USG commits its people to die for is not &#8216;to promote and protect the rights of all who wish to be free.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Birdman brilliantly writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I do not believe in attacking countries which have not attacked us, no matter how odious their governments may be. If their people can&rsquo;t organize themselves and fight for their own freedom, why should anyone expect us to do it for them?&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>You write:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Some men comprehend discrimination by never have experiencing it in their lives, but the majority will only understand after it happens to them&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>We whites well understand discrimination as it is daily practiced against us, fully sanctioned by the USG.  Even the odious AG of the USG stated that the latest hate bill does not cover Whites.  The media refuse to report black/Hispanic-on-White crime, schools preach an anti-White curricula.  We are mocked, scorned and subjected to ridicule.</p>
<p>We are racially discriminated against via AA quotas in the workplace, passed over for lesser-qualified non-Whites for promotions and internships.  We are racially discriminated against in higher education, our children locked out of scholarships and college admissions in favor of academically inferior NAM students.</p>
<p>We are not allowed to promote for ourselves, to form advocacy groups that protect our rights, advocate for our interests without being called Nazis, Racists, K and Haters.  The AmRen conference was not allowed to take place by protesters calling us White Supremacists (we are White Nationalists) and who threatened every hotel where AmRen tried to book. </p>
<p>No government agencies came to our defense.  Have you ever known of a Hispanic/black/Asian group that was forced to retreat when met with screaming White protesters?  </p>
<p>That is discrimination.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;All Men are created equal&rdquo;! The founders had it right, when attempting to form a perfect union and they also knew that they were not there yet but knew we one day would get there. Lincoln moved us forward as did JFK and LBJ. This Nation was founded by men of many nations and backgrounds. It was founded on the principle that all men are created equal, and that the rights of every man are diminished when the rights of one man are threatened.</p>
<p>It is my contention that this AZ law is not constitutional and will fail when challenged (unless, of course, they keep adding more amendments), pretty funny for this so called perfect law.</p>
<p>As for the undocumented workers, as Ronald Reagan said &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Economy, Stupid&rdquo;. When the economy is good we say let&rsquo;s all celebrate &ldquo;Cinco de Mayo, my brothers&rdquo; but when we are in a down &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all your fault, you damn immigrant&rdquo;.  This too will pass. The real problem is the narcosis/drug and people smuggler that&rsquo;s what the focus should be on.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you find it funny that no one ever voted for Governor Brewer, it&rsquo;s all about politics, do not be fooled.  Busy Brewer has passed S.B. 1070, no permit conceal weapons law, the famous Birthers law and if history is a lesson their House Bill 2779 from two years ago (which failed when challenged) and the one that was the funniest the boycott of Martin Luther King Day, not wanting another holiday.  I believe there is an undercurrent to their enactment of new laws, they real love following a distinct pattern.</p>
