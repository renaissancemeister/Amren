			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amana Fontanella-Khan, Christian Science Monitor, May 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Skin color matters in India, a fact made clear by the adjectives used in personal ads seeking spouses. Suitors use keywords such as &#8220;dusky,&#8221; a euphemism denoting dark skin, or &#8220;wheatish,&#8221; meaning one is light-skinned, to indicate their complexions.</p>
<p>While being darker-complected has traditionally been considered an impediment to finding a good partner, things may be changing. April&rsquo;s cover story in Vogue India proclaimed the &#8220;Dawn of Dusk&#8221; saying, &#8220;Every generation has its share of myths. Perhaps it&rsquo;s time to bust this one. Time to say that we love, and always have loved, the gorgeous color of Indian skin.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} Sales in skin-lightening creams are up by 17 percent from the previous year, reported marketing firm Nielsen Company late in 2009. One Indian advertising executive, who worked on a skin-whitening campaign and wished to remain anonymous, explained the growth by saying that &#8220;being fair is seen as a passport to getting the ideal partner.&#8221; These attitudes are also reflected in India&rsquo;s thriving film industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Bollywood, there is a premium on being fair. Dusky actresses .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. aren&rsquo;t considered glamorous,&#8221; says filmmaker Jag Mundhra.</p>

		<p> The real &#8220;myth&#8221; is that the Indian preference for lighter skin is a thing of only the recent past. It dates back thousands of years. In ancient India, light skin meant you were wealthy, or otherwise favored, so that you didn&rsquo;t have to work in the fields where the sun blackened complexions.</p>
<p> The preference for lighter skin exists all over the world. These Third World nationalist attempts to tell people that they should be proud of being dark are doomed, in the long run, to fail. White is beautiful. Black is just   &mdash;   well, black.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve always been attracted to &#8220;dusky.&#8221; Usually my preferences have been more trouble than they&rsquo;re worth, as dark skin correlates all too closely the hate-whitey mentality and the general dysfunctionality of our two favorite minority groups.</p>
<p>Perhaps Indian women are the answer to my dilemma. At any rate, as someone who genuinely finds dark skin beautiful I just can&rsquo;t understand the universal inferiority complex. Sure, black hair/brown eyes is more monotonous than the variety found among caucasians, but it&rsquo;s what floats my boat. What&rsquo;s wrong with that?!<br>

<p>Who the hell is Vogue magazine to tell Indians that their reality is &#8220;myth&#8221;?  In fact, Vogue&rsquo;s and American beliefs that all races are the same and all skin colors equally attractive is the myth into which Americans are brainwashed. </p>
<p>Vogue is making itself the laughing stock.  Since Indians are more blunt and outspoken than Americans, Indians are likely to tell Vogue to go to hell.  Stupid ugly Americans, Indians will say.   </p>

		<p>This article ignores the fact that fair skin is preferred on men by Indian women as well. Go to any Indian matrimonial site and you will see that most women have profiles stating their preferences for fair or &#8216;wheatish&rsquo; husbands. You will never see a profile where a woman would state that she exclusively prefers dark skinned men.<br>
Check this popular matrimonial site if you wish.<br>

		<p>I have been disgusted by black/brown skin ever since I can remember. Olive skin is as &#8216;dark&rsquo; as I go bc it tends to glow, ages the least and is the least cancer prone. Indian women have beautiful bone structure but they are too brown without all that makeup they use in Bollywod.</p>

		<p>The subcontinent&rsquo;s dark-skinned people are primarily of the Dravidian ethnicity, which is related to the Australoids.  Those of lighter skin are mostly descendants of Arab invaders.  There is, of course, a great mixture in the population, but it seems that the lowest strata have the darkest skin.<br>
I personally find that beauty lies mostly in facial features and not in skin tone.  Most Asian movies, including Bollywood and Oriental films, however, have romantic roles (at least) peopled by those of light skin.</p>

		<p>generalquagmyer there is nothing wrong with darker skin but many people DO have a problem with whites that wipe out their own recessive European traits such as light hair, blue/green eyes by choosing a dark mate. Personally I don&rsquo;t see anything wrong with &#8220;dating&#8221; darker skinned people but when it comes to producing offspring it matters quite a lot.</p>

		<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;I am not surprized. Miss India is always a fair skinned woman with green or brown eyes. Some of them are so fair, I wonder if they are biracial</p>
<p>In Northern India, we have white upper-caste Hindus who have lived in India for 5,000 years among brown people, but they have managed to maintain their white racial purity. Some of them have blue and green eyes, and if they walked on a street in Paris or Vienna, you would think they were Europeans.</p>
<p>It is true that Indians are as hypocritical as Mexicans. They love to proclaim &#8220;brown pride&#8221;, but on their TV and movie screens, white Indians and white Mexicans dominate.</p>
<p>This campaign by Vogue India trying to promote dusky skin is part of that hypocrisy, and is unlikely to change 5,000 years of Indian history. White skin is genetically recessive. If people preferred dark skin over light skin, whites would become extinct.</p>
<p>If one was to define a white person as having the skin tone of at least the average Spaniard/Greek, or lighter-skinned, then at least 50 million Indians would fit in that definition. This would put India in the top ten nations in the world, in terms of the size of its white population. I must emphasize that this estimate is on the lower side, in that it defines 5 percent of India as &#8220;white&#8221;.</p>
<p>Some white nationalists claim that the original aryan invaders of India have disappeared as a distinct race. On the contrary, there may be more white Indians today, than there have ever been in history. </p>

		<p>Indian society has valued fair skin ever since the Aryans invaded the place some 3000 years ago, displacing the much darker Dravidians and creating a caste system to ensure those Dravidians remained in their appointed place.  Do the editors of a MAGAZINE - for crying out loud - think that they can undo three millenia of cultural beliefs?</p>
<p>As for &#8220;white&#8221; Indians, an engineer I once worked with had a much lighter complexion than the Italian who also worked with us, so I would say they certainly haven&rsquo;t disappeared as a distinct race.</p>

		<p>The Dravidian [what they are called] people of Indja are the original inhabitants of the sub-continent. Dark skinned. Many invaders have brought a lighter hue of skin color, much preferred. The caste system of Indja enforces the methods by which marriages are arranged, and will probably always do so.</p>
<p>Women the world over prefer the lighter skin look, just a fact. And not because of whitey and the white influence either.</p>

		<p>To comment on some of the comments about #5:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a native Californian; probably not any &#8220;Southern Man&#8221; psychological issues going on. In high school I preferred Latinas. There were a lot of them and they seemed exotic compared with the girls in the Pepsi commercials, but by early twenties the lack of brains and ambition became a turnoff&hellip; though my high school sweetheart was a Puerto Rican who became a doctor.</p>
<p>As a kid I learned to swim at a YMCA with mostly blacks, who come to think of it never advanced beyond learning to float while I went on to Junior Lifesaving. The girls in their swimsuits were kind of cute, and later in the army black women started looking really good. Some of them were halfway smart too, though there were A LOT of losers and hate-whitey types. Blacks always seemed to find my preferences kind of neat, actually, maybe because they were so pure and uncontrived.</p>
<p>Have never wanted to procreate with someone of another race, though. It causes too many problems for the kid, who often comes out funny-looking. Nothing wrong with it, in essence, but a mixed race kid manages to alienate nearly everyone and that&rsquo;s just the way human nature is&hellip; No pro-diversity numbskull me!</p>
<p>Northern Indians are caucasian, while the darker Southern Indians are Dravidians, thought to be most closely related to Australian aborigines. There is some mixing between them, and because of the climate even the caucasians can develop quite a dark complexion. Indian acquaintances tell me the smart ones are here; they reassure me there are plenty of dumb people in India.</p>
<p>Got lots of white ladies as friends, but they just don&rsquo;t do a thing for me romantically. It&rsquo;s like hanging out with my sister. It&rsquo;s tiresome to see so few white people anymore other than the elderly in Southern California  &mdash;  and almost no white males other than cops in positions of authority  &mdash;  while so many dusky dummies still whine about white racism and white domination. It&rsquo;s a rough road to plow, but I can&rsquo;t help what I&rsquo;m attracted to and will probably spend the next phase of my frustrating romantic life being rebuffed by snooty Indians.</p>

<p>The interesting thing about that is that Southern India, which is considerably darker, is more well off than Northern India.  Compare the province of Uttar Pradesh in Northern India with Kerala on the Southwest coast, or the Northeastern city of Calcutta with the Southern city of Bangalore (the IT capital of India).  It&rsquo;s no contest.  I&rsquo;m sure there are other factors at work than skin tone and Australoid ancestry, such as the fact that Southern India has much fewer Muslims.  Islam tends to lower the IQ of any population where it resides.     </p>

		<p>There is an East Indian post graduate student who comes to my work quite often, and we usually strike up a conversation.</p>
<p>It is obvious that she is attracted to white men, and like 100 percent of Asians who live in white countries, she is subtley curious about our attitudes on race.  </p>
<p>She&rsquo;s thrown out a few hints that she wants to know what I think of interracialism. It occurs to me that if whites avoid the topic, profess to be tolerant, or pretend they are color blind, the Asian can&rsquo;t help but think that we are indifferent to marrying interracially or miscegenation.  They conclude we are fair game because we don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>I see too many Asian females with white men, and it looks to me like the female is the conquering race, while the male is in self-induced oblivion. </p>

<p>The caste system was made by white Indians. Three hundred years ago you could guess the caste system very good only looking at the skin color.<br>
The Indians did the same what the Egyptians did, the Arabs did, the Europeans did, even the Vikings did when they were in America: Separate themselves for skin color and race!   </p>

<p>Sorry olewhitelady but this is incorrect. The lighter skinned North Indians are descended from Ancestral North Indians (Aryans/Indo-Europeans) as distinguished from the dark skinned Dravidians of South India and the darker skinned tribals who make up the Untouchables and lower casters. Arabs are semites. There is no semitic admixture in India, North or South.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen it mentioned anywhere in my readings   (most historians are loathe to touch on anything such as racial characteristics), but I wonder if that fact gave an instant and automatic advantage to the British?  Right away, upon arrival, even before they were rulers, they were seen as rulers!   Since the arrival of the Aryans,  Indians were pre-accustomed to seeing light skin as a ruling  trait.</p>
<p>(Just  the same as were the Spaniards upon arrival in Mexico.)</p>

The caste system was made by white Indians. The Indians did the same that the Egyptians did, the Arabs did, the Europeans did, even the Vikings when they were in America: Separate themselves for skin color and race! <br>

<p>Even the Greeks did the same after their conquest of Egypt. <br>
Cleopatra, after ten generations, was pure Greek.</p>

Bono and U2, Irishmen, pleaded for African debt forgiveness. The G8 countries have pardoned much of Africa&rsquo;s debt. People like Bob Geldolf have held events like LiveAid for African peoples and nations. <br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>What one earth makes busybody rock&rollers; like Bono and Geldof  presume that they are experts on international debt?  Or on anything else,  beyond twanging a guitar?</p>
<p>I am so tired of these  pompous celebrities advising all the rest of us on morality, virtue, and how to live properly.</p>

		<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;I am not surprized. Miss India is always a fair skinned woman with green or brown eyes. Some of them are so fair, I wonder if they are biracial</p>
<p>Well in the states they probably are. A family friends daughter took one of the California Miss India titles and she is biracial (Swiss mother, Indian Seik father).</p>

		<p>Great article. But how does this affect SBA loans for 7-11&rsquo;s? I prefer my tax dollars go not to American citizens or right wing veterans but to dusky Indians. They seem nice. Now the wheatish types should not be discriminated against either.They should get the Dunkin&rsquo; Donouts franchises. </p>

<p>Very very true, but you forgot Subway. Seriously Dunkin and Subway have the highest percentage of Indian owners. McDonald&rsquo;s has practically none.<br>

<p>&#8220;The Indian people have a lot of gods for thousand of years.<br>
None of them was ever print dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not true!  Kali, &#8220;the black one&#8221;, historically has been depicted as having skin as dark as night.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that according to historians, the earliest mention of this goddess occurs in the early part of the Vedic Age where she is described as a war goddess.  Some historians believe she was originally a Dravidian goddess whose worship was incorporated by their Indo-Aryan conquerors.</p>

<p>This behavior seems to have been ubiquitous before the so-called modern age.   Even the ancient Hebrews apparently did it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was of sapphire&#8221; - Lamentations of Jeremiah: chapt. 4 vs. 7, Holy Bible, KJV.</p>
<p>I also seem to recall reading somewhere that Francisco Pizarro, the famed conqueror of the Inca Empire, noted the Inca rulers looked appreciably different from the peoples they ruled.  Among other things, according to Pizarro, they were significantly lighter in complexion, suggesting they were the descendants of invaders who set themselves up as rulers over the people they conquered.<br>

<p>India was not a nation when the Aryans arrived from the Eurasian steppes. These white people were not Indians but Aryan/Tocharian invaders and rulers.</p>
<p>You notice that old Buddhist paintings always seem to have fair people with European racial features.</p>
