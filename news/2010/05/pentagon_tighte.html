			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Booth Gunter, SPLC, April 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Since the SPLC warned the U.S. military about extremist activity among active-duty personnel in 2006, the Pentagon brass has steadfastly denied that a problem existed and insisted that its &#8220;zero-tolerance&#8221; policy was sufficient to keep organized racists out of its ranks.</p>
<p>That changed this past November, when the Pentagon quietly tightened its policy on extremist activity, which formerly only banned &#8220;active participation&#8221; in extremist groups but did not define what that meant.</p>
<p>Under the new regulations, military personnel &#8220;must not actively advocate supremacist doctrine, ideology or causes&#8221; or &#8220;otherwise advance efforts to deprive individuals of their civil rights.&#8221; The new rules specify that &#8220;active participation&#8221; includes activities such as recruiting, fundraising, demonstrating or rallying, training, organizing and distributing supremacist material, including online posts.</p>
<p>The revision should give commanders ample new tools to root out racial extremists in their midst. The previous policy, in effect since the mid-1990s, could be interpreted to mean that military personnel were allowed to be &#8220;mere members&#8221; of hate groups or that they could engage in unaffiliated extremist activities  &mdash;  such as posting racist and anti-Semitic messages to social networking websites and e-mail lists or maintaining online profiles filled with racist materials. As the SPLC has repeatedly pointed out, the policy allowed numerous active-duty members to engage in a range of supremacist activities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The SPLC has been urging the Pentagon to revise the regulations since 2006, when it published &#8220;A Few Bad Men,&#8221; a report revealing that large numbers of neo-Nazi skinheads and other white supremacists were joining the armed forces to acquire combat and weapons training  &mdash;  skills that could be used to commit terrorist acts against targets in the U.S.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} [An] unclassified FBI Intelligence Assessment in Fall 2008 detailed more than a dozen investigative findings and criminal cases involving Iraq and Afghanistan veterans as well as other active-duty personnel engaging in extremist activity in recent years. &#8220;The military training veterans bring to the [white supremacist] movement and their potential to pass this training on to others can increase the ability of lone offenders to carry out violence from the movement&rsquo;s fringes,&#8221; the FBI report warned.</p>
<p>In February 2009, the threat became even harder to ignore. Lance Corporal Kody Brittingham, a Marine stationed at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, was arrested and later charged with threatening the president after investigators found white supremacist materials and a journal containing a plot to assassinate President Obama among his belongings.</p>
<p>Then, in April 2009, a Department of Homeland Security report on the threat of domestic terrorism from right-wing extremists stated that the department &#8220;assesses that rightwing extremists will attempt to recruit and radicalize returning veterans in order to exploit their skills and knowledge derived from military training and combat.&#8221;</p>
<p>With no apparent action being taken by the Pentagon, in July 2009 the SPLC appealed to Congress to investigate the problem. In a letter to committee chairmen with oversight over homeland security and the armed services, the SPLC presented dozens of additional profiles of active-duty military personnel on the New Saxon website. {snip}</p>
<p>Two months later, in September, SPLC officials were invited to brief staff members of Sen. Joe Lieberman&rsquo;s Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.</p>

<p>This is the SPLC&rsquo;s own propaganda.  And through all this, the only evidence they have of this vast right wing conspiracy materializing into actual violence is some guy with a journal and literature.  No mentions of Maj. Hasan or Col. Akbar.</p>
<p>In reality, what the SPLC is correct if you apply it to black and Hispanic gangs and Muslim terrorist groups.</p>

		<p>The Black Panthers, in the 1960s, told their members to enter the military so as to gain combat skills, but there was no effort made to stop them, although they didnt use those skills to a great extent.What does the SPLC say about Islamic Fanatics, like the one that killed 12 military personnel at Fort Hood? Nothing.Have you heard about any white extremists using military skills against anyone they didnt like? I havent. </p>

Our military is becoming Islamofied.   Rooting out White Warriors is key to that strategy.  Aware Whites would be the first to complain or interfere, thus they must be dismissed before they can notice anything amiss.</p>
<p>Killer Islamo-Hasan was just the visible front of the transformation. The real work goes on behind the scenes.  </p>
<p>We are surprised this report become public. No we aren&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s fundraising agitprop for the Cohen $PLC.</p>

		<p>The SPLC with help from the Obamites manages to &#8216;clamp down&rsquo; on White Seperatists in the military. Of course we all know that only Whites can be &#8216;supremacists&rsquo;. Members of La Raza or the Nations of Islam get a free pass. </p>
<p>One suggestion to any  young WN who plans to join the armed forces, make sure to keep the tattoos to a minimum. I&rsquo;m sure the SPLC has provided info that will identify popular WN symbolism. </p>

		<p>There is no organization out there that I despise more than the Southern Poverty Law Center. If anyone hasn&rsquo;t already, just go to their website and read some of their material. You&rsquo;ll understand why I feel this way. If they restricted their activities to attacking REAL hate groups, then I&rsquo;d have no problem. But they consider everyone who doesn&rsquo;t hold their strict, liberal views on race to be &#8220;hateful&#8221;</p>
<p>[The Department of Defense&rsquo;s Instruction on &ldquo;Handling DISSIDENT [capitalization added] and PROTEST Activities Among Members of the Armed Forces&rdquo; can be downloaded as a PDF file here.] </p>
<p>I think this underlines the SPLC&rsquo;s real intentions. They are neither accepting nor tolerant. The fact that they want to &#8220;handle dissident and protest activities&#8221; just shows how fascist tendencies run deep in their veins. What kind of civil rights group states its wishes to attack dissident and protest? How paradoxical and hypocritical of them.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m extremely surprised that the Army is being allowed to do this. Such measures are un-Constitutional and in direct contrast to the freedom of speech we are suppose to enjoy in this country. I mean, you could get fired from the military now for handing out &#8220;supremacist material&#8221; (I&rsquo;m sure that issues of AmRen would, under the SPLC&rsquo;s ignorant definition, qualify as &#8220;supremacist material&#8221;, right along the ranks of actual hateful literature such as Hitler&rsquo;s M.K).</p>

		<p>The U.S. Military appears to be 60% or so BLACK and 30+% hispanic along with HUGE numbers of gangbangers..I know gangbangers when I see them too, I am not inexperienced in this area. I have already experienced senior (mostly Army) NCOs leaving the service because of their inability to dicipline blacks for worry of losing their careers and retirement pay! The Army is now particularly ineffective in combat operations unless huge numbers are used. When the troops at FOBs go out on patrols, most that are left are blacks and the places instantly turn into ghettos! Spanish and Ebonics are the primary language in the mess halls, shuck and jive is the primary form of greeting on the camp, the Army is overflowing with black O-3 thru O-5s and lots of black, head bobbing, finger wagging, overweight black women all over the place, to include the officer corp. Sad case for the military indeed from the Viet-Nam days.</p>

		<p>Yet we&rsquo;ve had SEVERAL attacks or planned attacks by MUSLIMS on our military bases, and that wasn&rsquo;t mentioned as a threat by the military. That muslim &#8220;soldier&#8221; that shot what - 31 innocent people in Fort Knox, notice that we never hear anything about that anymore. When was the last time that YOU heard how that was coming along! They must be too busy flushing out all those thousands and thousands of skinheads. I&rsquo;m sure their definition of skinhead would be any White person that refuses to bow down to the black gods and having any pride in their race and calling it like it is. If I had a dollar for every time I&rsquo;ve been called a &#8220;racissss&#8221; for merely stating facts, I could be Donald Trumps next door neighbor.

<p>Doing any of the aforementioned things is synonymous with being &#8216;an American&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The SPLC and its ilk are trying to divide brother against brother, attacking the fabric of the nation.  The military and the armed citizenry are one against adversaries.</p>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m wrong, but I get the feeling that, since the source of this article is the SPLC itself, that they&rsquo;re embellishing the extent of the new policy (hint:  it contains a lot of weasel words) and their involvement with the DoD.  Remember, the SPLC is a fund raising house of cards.  Any written material from the SPLC should be analyzed with that in mind   &mdash;   This pronouncement is designed to elicit donations, by making the Center seem more powerful and influential than it actually is.</p>
<p>The April 2009 report referenced here was SPLC-written.  They denied it at first, then admitted it later.  So too was the infamous Missouri Highway Patrol/DHS &#8220;Fusion Center&#8221; report.</p>

		<p>Frankly, any white man who joins the infantry,  whether Marines or Army,  ought to have his head examined.  He&rsquo;s fighting for a system (whether Republicans or Democrats are in office is irrelevant) which openly declares that the elimination of everyone like him is the highest moral goal of the regime.   It&rsquo;s a bit like a Pole gleefully joining the German army in 1943.</p>

		<p>    Would a majority white, conservative military bust heads or maybe even fire on groups like the Tea Partiers ? Very doubtful . So the anti-white changes being made in the military does have a method to the madness . I believe Thomas Chittum covered this scenario way back in &#8216;96 . Prophetic to say the least . </p>

		<p>I could not be more delighted. The more they reject and eject white men (especially Southern) from the military service, the more such men we will have with us.</p>
<p>They will someday wish they had more white men in the US military, and fewer blacks and illegal aliens. They will sorely miss those magnificent Scot-Irish and German men&hellip;.especially when they are fighting for the other side!</p>

		<p>Not unexpected. Nevertheless.. WNs should not be deterred from joining the army to acquire Military or Trade skills. The archives of AmRen show that the majority of Whites are self-destructive with NO HOPE of a mass revival. Seperatism is the only solution for the 3% to 5% of Whites once the economy deteriorates badly enough in 15 years and military men &amp; tradesmen will be needed. </p>

		<p>When Hitler talked about rooting out jewry (in German &#8220;Ausrottung&#8221; - yes, that is etymologically and semantically the same word), it was interpreted as an order for genocide. Maybe that was correct. When the SPLC talks about &#8220;to root out racial extremists&#8221;, how should we interprete that?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m glad they are keeping whites out of the military who may hold racialist views. When is the last time the US fought a defensive war in its own interests? We shouldn&rsquo;t be joining the military anyway! Let the multi culturalists supply the troops for their illegal and unecessary wars which go against our interests. <br>

		<p>New DoD policy is for a reason but not the one you would think.  THe Army as a whole is undergoing a massive change from white to black and hispanic.  Used to be B &amp; H soldiers did not have the scores or the guts to enter into the various combat fields.  This meant that they usually worked log&hellip;supply, transportation, food service, engineer maybe and chemical.  The scores have been lowered to promote diversity and so now its not uncommon to find B &amp; H aircraft mechanics (God help me as fly AH-64s for a living).  My peers find that a vast majority of the discipline problems&hellip;DUIs, bad checks, wife beating and just not showing up for work, are found in the B &amp; H population.  With B &amp; H officers, most of the line commanders want nothing to do with them so they get assigned to staffs and non-command positions.  But unfortunately the numbers don&rsquo;t add up and so now in order to keep them from commanding, they literally fill the Pentagon and other large commands.  Soooo&hellip;in order to keep the peace and to keep the truth hidden about these types, DoD puts out this policy.  Because, and I paraphrase the Army Chief of Staff&hellip;&#8221;THe greater casualty would be diversity after the Ft Hood shooting&#8221;.  As a battalion commander, I&rsquo;ve never met one trustworthy B or H in uniform no matter how much you try to help them succeed.  After 32 years in the uniform, it&rsquo;s time to leave as the changes are all for the worse.</p>

		<p>If you are in the military, you CANNOT do any of those things for the Democratic, Republican or Independent political parties either.  There are regulations against speaking to the press without authorization.  There are regulations against engaging in political advocacy.  This is no big deal.  Get a grip.  It&rsquo;s the military.  They can issue any order or regulation they want to, as long as it is a lawful order.  Lumping Neo-Ns, Aryan Nations, K, etc activities under the existing regulation isn&rsquo;t ADDING anything to current regs.  It is merely clarifying the reg.  When militaries are allowed to become political, then you have Caesar crossing the Rubicon.  Or a US military willing to shoot Americans on the wrong side of politics on order of politically correct (or incorrect) ideology.</p>
