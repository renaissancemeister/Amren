			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News, May 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Arizona tourists are biting back against San Diego for its city council&rsquo;s decision to boycott the Grand Canyon State over its immigration law signed by Gov. Jan Brewer last month.</p>
<p>Would-be tourists have notified the San Diego Convention and Visitors Bureau and some hotels that they are canceling their scheduled travel to the coastal vacation destination, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune.</p>
<p>According to the newspaper, the convention bureau has received about 25-30 emails from Arizona residents, with some saying they are canceling their reservations and taking their money elsewhere.</p>
<p>That has tourism officials urging Arizonans to consider the resolutions as merely symbolic and local politics at work.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re in a very tough environment already because of everything else going on, and we don&rsquo;t need another negative impact to our industry,&#8221; ConVis President Joe Terzi told the Union-Tribune. &#8220;This affects all the hardworking men and women who count on tourism for their livelihoods, so we&rsquo;re saying, don&rsquo;t do something that hurts their livelihoods.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve been approached by a number of hotels who are very concerned because they&rsquo;ve received cancelations from Arizona guests,&#8221; Namara Mercer, executive director of the county Hotel-Motel Association, told the newspaper.</p>
<p>Roughly 2 million Arizonans visit San Diego each year but the recession has taken a toll on the hotel industry that was hoping for a comeback this year. Hotels are offering deep discounts to fill up their undersold rooms while the tourism board spends $7 million this spring and summer season to promote travel to the area.</p>
<p>Several councils in large cities like Los Angeles, Austin, Boston and San Francisco have approved boycotts on employee travel or future contracts with Arizona businesses as a result of the law that goes into effect on July 1.  The state tourism bureau has said the losses so far have reached nearly $10 million as a result of 23 canceled meetings.</p>
<p>But others are cautious, noting unintended consequences. Milwaukee&rsquo;s city council delayed a vote on a boycott and Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett said he opposes such action.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in San Diego, school board President Shelia Jackson said she is sorry people don&rsquo;t want to come to her city, but she still supports her vote to boycott Arizona.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s sad that people would cancel their plans to come here in reaction to that, but I still think we did the right thing,&#8221; Jackson told the Union-Tribune. &#8220;Certainly, we know how important tourism is to San Diego, and it wasn&rsquo;t my intent to impact the tourism trade.&#8221;<br>

						<p>
							<i>Ed Morrisey, Hot Air, May 18, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>The Los Angeles City Council voted to boycott the state of Arizona over its new immigration-enforcement law, and now the Arizona Corporation Commission has responded.  Gary Pierce, one of the commissioners chosen in state-wide elections to the utility regulation panel, notes that Los Angeles gets about 25% of its power from Arizona producers.  If the City of Angels really wants a boycott, Pierce offers his services to help, as he explains in a letter to Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and copied to Hot Air.</p>

		<p>Every citizen should be doing all they can to boycott any and all who desparage Arizona&rsquo;s stand against illegals.</p>
<p>Instead of sending money to Haiti, which is money lost to a rat hole, send money to Arizona, do some good for America for a change.  We have put the whole world on the expense report for the American taxpayer, plus, the billions in donations out of the goodness of our hearts.</p>
<p>Stop.  Think. Save your own country.  We are the lifeboat of the world, what good is the lifeboat if it sinks (from overloading)?</p>

<p>Good for the tourists of Arizona and Commissioner Gary Pierce, for fighting back on this issue. Perhaps, these Marxist goons in LA and San Diego should remember that blackmail only works from a position of strength, even when it is &ldquo;merely symbolic.&rdquo; Moreover, I think that maybe Arizonians realize that (following the MLK &ldquo;holiday&rdquo; debacle of the 90s) yielding to these Reds&rsquo; demands and threats, never squelches the &ldquo;negative&rdquo; publicity and economic impacts intended, it only exacerbates them.  </p>
<p>Indeed, I hate to say it, but we might be seeing the &ldquo;Red and Blue&rdquo; states beginning to have such serious rifts, that they cannot be casually fluffed off as being &ldquo;merely symbolic&rdquo; anymore. It may be that we are hopelessly drifting toward a breakup of the union, or an outright Civil War II? </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think we can blame AZ for firing back.  Los Angeles and San Diego most inappropriately got too big for their britches - cities do NOT trump states, nor is it proper for them to vote to boycott states.  So now SD and LA are getting their rear ends kicked by AZ.  Good.  And I live in SoCA!</p>

		<p>I live in Arizona and am proud of my state. We finally have leaders who care for the quality of life here and are sick of catering to illegals who don&rsquo;t belong here. And I hope Arizona&rsquo;s example will help other states rid themselves of the illegal invasion. Arizona also has large numbers of well to do retirees who can flex a lot of economic muscle by cancelling travel plans, etc. to California. So we can hit California in its already depleted pocketbook. And wouldn&rsquo;t it be delicious if Arizona cut off the 25 percent of the power it supplies to L.A. God bless my state. We care about being the Americans our Founders intended. And there are more good things to come, like service providers are not now required to provide services in languages other than English. How about that?</p>

		<p>I am writing to Commisioner Gary Pierce to commend him on his splendidly worded letter which really socks the message through. It was masterful.</p>
<p>I am also re-considering my forthcoming vacation in California; as right now Arizona is looking particularly good instead. We should all consider doing so.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s not enough merely to shift our plans; we must take pains to let them know, and to TELL them EXACTLY WHY. I urge all Amrener&rsquo;s to do so.  And when you do, do it with cc&rsquo;s to newspapers, politicians, tourist boards, hotels, and everyone else who might remotely be concerned.  That&rsquo;s the way to get the maximum bang out of your buck. Make your dollars count!</p>

		<p> Many years ago, I made several extended visits to SoCal, and wanted badly to settle down there. I thought it was Paradise. Everyone (well practically everyone) I met seemed so cool and &#8220;with it&#8221;. My more recent visits have assured me that moving to SoCal was the best thing I never did. It has turned into a seaside sewer with nice sunsets. Nevertheless, I was planning to visit some old friends in San Diego, partly because I had never made it that far south in Cali. Now I never will. I won&rsquo;t burn a single gallon of gas or spend a single dime in that state again. I&rsquo;ll go to Arizona instead.</p>

<p>Wait, it&rsquo;s early in the tourism season. I would like to hear more from/about Shelia Jackson later. Will see how confident she and the city council members who opted for a boycott feel  &mdash;  say, around the end of July. By then, many millions more will be have been sacrificed.</p>

You&rsquo;re absolutely right. Well, theoretically at least.<br>
But NY City has been doing that for ages   &mdash;   not only trumping states, but even the federal government, acting as an independent country  with its own foreign policy. </p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been allowed to get away with that for so long that one can hardly be surprised if LA and other cities are now trying to do the same.</p>

		<p>Not to be alarmist, but actual shooting wars often start this way.  Many times harsh rhetoric turns into economic boycotts and then to armed aggression.  Just imagine if Arizona does limit or stop giving power to LA.  Would Washington broker some sort of truce or even send in federal troops to stop Arizona&rsquo;s embargo?  The idea would have seemed unbelievable a few years ago, but this country is as divided as I&rsquo;ve ever seen in my lifetime and it seems as though people are on edge. </p>

<p>It would be folly for me to advocate an armed response by Arizona against the Feds, but what would be great would be a case of total civil disobedience in which NO ONE will turn the power or the water back on for LA.  It won&rsquo;t happen, though, but it would be great if all those who knew where the switches and valves are located just literally sat down on the job, even if they had to do some jail time.  I&rsquo;m glad there are people like Mr. Pierce still with us.  <br>
