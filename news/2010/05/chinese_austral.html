<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8670531.stm">Chinese Australians Angry at Gallipoli TV Casting</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nick Bryant, BBC News, May 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>There has been an angry reaction in Australia after television producers cast a Caucasian man in the role of a Chinese-Australian war hero.</p>
<p>Billy Sing was a hero of the Gallipoli campaign in World War I, but a TV drama has him cast as a white man.</p>
<p>The producers say they could not find a 60-year-old Chinese actor to play Billy Sing&rsquo;s father, so both parts will be played by white actors.</p>
<p>They have been accused of re-writing Australian history.</p>
<p>Billy Sing was known as the &#8220;Gallipoli assassin&#8221;, the son of a Chinese man and English woman, who became a hero of the Australian forces during World War I by killing more than 200 enemy troops.</p>
<p>The recipient of a Distinguished Conduct medal, his memory is cherished within the Chinese-Australian community.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s been such an angry reaction to the decision of the producers of the television mini-series, The Legend of Billy Sing, to cast a white man in the lead.</p>
<p>The director, Geoff Davis, actually picked his son, Josh, to play the role, and defended the decision by saying that he could not find a 60-year-old Chinese actor to play Billy Sing&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>He therefore decided that both men should be Caucasian.</p>
<p>But Chinese-Australians have complained that young people will now grow up thinking that Billy Sing was white, and that is a betrayal of their heritage.</p>
<p>The head of a Chinese-Australian youth association said that &#8220;whiting out&#8221; Billy Sing was not only a gross historical misrepresentation but treading on the grave of a true Chinese-Australian hero.<br>

		<p>Actually&hellip;I agree with the Chinese on this one.  That doesn&rsquo;t mean I think Australia should accept non-white immigrants, Chinese or others, but let the facts be presented.  Of course, if I had a dollar for every time a non-white has portrayed a white historical figure in movies and on TV I&rsquo;d have the price of the #8 dinner down at General Cho&rsquo;s Diner.</p>

		<p>I can actually empathize with East Asians on this one.  Decades earlier it was not uncommon for Whites to portray them in movies and on TV.  It was especially unnerving for them to see Whites portray stereotypical &#8220;Oriental supervillains&#8221; like Fu Manchu.  We&rsquo;re getting that now whenever we see blacks being given roles obviously meant for Whites.</p>
<p>That being said, like Gerald Martin, I don&rsquo;t believe they should be immigrating to Australia, or any White country, for that matter.</p>

		<p>Well as someone who loves history I think its a bad idea to portray a Chinese man with a white actor. On the other hand, in theater (not so much in movies, though) white roles are increasingly played by blacks. And could you imagine if a white person complained about a Chinese man playing a white man&rsquo;s role? The liberal reaction would be scary to say the least.</p>

<p>Well if he&rsquo;s 50/50 what&rsquo;s the big deal? Surely having a Han Chinese play the role wouldn&rsquo;t be entirely accurate either? I&rsquo;ve seen mixed-race Eurasians who have more of the Caucasian look than Asian. So whether it&rsquo;s a white actor made up to look part Asian or vice versa, I don&rsquo;t see a big deal. If they wanted to be completely true to the story they&rsquo;d have to find a mixed race Asian/Caucasian actor anyway.</p>

		<p>This incident emphasizes the need for Australia to deport<br>
Chinese because the true origin of Australias Chinese problem is rooted in Chinese racism and jealousy that a comparatively small nation of whites, far from European shores could resurrect a civilization in less than 200 then technologically advance to the extent of another race wanting to immigrate there.</p>

		<p>I can sympathize with them. At the very least the producers ought to have found a Chinese actors to play his father   &mdash;   honestly how hard could that be? Then again, if it&rsquo;s okay for blacks to play white protagonists and Nordic deities and it&rsquo;s okay for black antagonists from real life to be portrayed with white actors then I don&rsquo;t see what grounds these people have to complain.</p>

		<p>I am Chinese descent and I really don&rsquo;t know what the hoopla is all about. After all, Billy Sing was racially Asian and White; he wasn&rsquo;t 100% Chinese nor was he 100% White.</p>
<p>I personally think it would&rsquo;ve been best if they cast a Eurasian actor for the part.</p>

<p>Asians are the largest ethnic minority in Australia, and blacks are almost non-existent. The few remaining pure-blooded Aboriginal Australians are found mostly in rural outback areas, and are as insignificant as Native Americans are in the US. Asians are the Hispanics of Australia. Whites and Asians compete with each other for economic opportunities. Why should White Australians form an alliance with people who are taking away their jobs, and transforming their Anglo-Celtic culture?</p>
<p>This &#8220;Billy Sing&#8221; character was half-white and half-Chinese, and a white actor has as much right to play the character as a Chinese actor, because he has 50 percent of Sing&rsquo;s white genes. If a full-blooded Chinese character had been chosen, would we be hearing complaints about Sing&rsquo;s 50 percent white ethnic indentity being overlooked? Why do some want to deny a white actor an opportunity to advance his career? </p>
<p>In any case, Australia is a WHITE country, and is obligated to show preference for its white population, and for white actors. If China wants to make its own version of the Billy Sing story, they are free to select a Chinese actor, and an all-Chinese cast, and I can assure you we will not hear any of the whiners complaining if that happens. Whites need to stop being stupid.</p>
<p>This situation is similar to the Kung Fu TV series that was popular in America in the 1970s. The late David Carradine played a fictional half-white and half-Chinese character, Kwai Chang Caine. Carradine, a white actor, was so convincing in his role, that many Americans came to assume that he was part Chinese. Now, that was good acting! <br>

They will not let other races overtake their history. A few months ago I saw a report in which a black guy said, that Kennedy did much less for black community than people believe. Is that true? Or is the Luther King fan just not able to accept not all whites are devils?</p>

		<p>He&rsquo;s half english. Unless his appearance was all asian then I could understand but does that mean we should ignore his European heritage? He fought for Australia not China. <br>
Exactly why was there such an allowance of non white to move to the land down under back then in the first place is beyond me. </p>

		<p>This is green tea temptest in a tea pot.  Chinese living anywhere but China ought to be grateful to any positive referrence made to China or Chinese.  They could have left the character out of the film.  I have a copy of the film, &#8220;Galipoli&#8221; one of Mel Gibson&rsquo;s first films, and there was zero referrence to any half-Chinese war hero.  Where was the outrage?</p>

		<p>Decades ago, there were very few Orientals in the West, very few Oriental roles, and very few Oriental actors.  That&rsquo;s why you saw Toshiro Mifune so often, he was the only Oriental actor available who was suitable for certain parts.  Rather than looking for Orientals with the right persona, the make up artists developed a technique for making White eyes look Oriental.  It might simply be that the director is just going with a reliable method for creating screen Eurasians.  <br>
     OTOH, and this is not clear to me, if they&rsquo;re re-writing history to make this historical figure a White man, then the Chinese have a legit beef, as do all Whites who care about history.  <br>

		<p>The Chinese agenda with the Billy Sing story is to establish &#8216;their&rsquo; role in the history of Australia, so that they can plausibly demand more immigration from China.</p>
<p>They played this card in Canada too. Canada employed some Chinese contract workers to do manual labor when it built the final leg of the transCanada railway in the 1800&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Chinese ex-pats living in Canada today are using the long ago railway workers as a way of claiming Chinese people have a permanent stake in Canada.</p>

<p>My apologies, I was admittedly a bit myopic in with regards to my comment. I live in america you see, the comment I made was referring to an america-centric point of view. It slipped my attention that australia would have differing demographics, social/racial issues. </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;This &ldquo;Billy Sing&rdquo; character was half-white and half-Chinese, and a white actor has as much right to play the character as a Chinese actor, because he has 50 percent of Sing&rsquo;s white genes. If a full-blooded Chinese character had been chosen, would we be hearing complaints about Sing&rsquo;s 50 percent white ethnic indentity being overlooked?

<p>Yeah but take note that his FATHER was chinese. This may sound a bit on the fringe, I but i strongly feel that offspring will physically take on more of the father&rsquo;s attributes. My basis for this reasoning being that with animals, a lion/tiger mix where the lion is the father, is actually a little bit different than a lion/tiger mix where the tiger is the father. They even has different monikers, one is called a liger, the other a tigon. Its actually quite fascinating, I advise you, and everyone here to research it. It makes for a very interesting study, especially when you consider the possible implications for human beings. Beyond that, in a nutshell, whether people want to admit it or not, white features/genes are a global premium. They are the most desirable as much as the multicultural left tries to convince people otherwise. That being so, purity (of the white genes) is an unspoken preference, with regards to other races, purity is not such a prerequisite. </p>
<p>Finally, I want to propose a deal. How about we trade all of your chinese in australia for all our blacks here in america? Sound good? What? No? Why not???? Hahahahaha</p>

I find your remark typical of an asian person. I can say this as I myself am also a person of asian descent (korean), for some reason i have noticed that a large percentage of asian people like to (try) to differentiate themselves from other people (especially other asians) by trying to come across as detached, indifferent, wholly neutral with regards to any matters involving asian people. I myself am only willing to legitimately call a spade a spade and will not take sides solely based on race alone, however I feel that many asians like to take the exact OPPOSITE stance that one would expect them to take (in certain matters, again usually those involving asians) merely to be contrary and to seem different. I find this rather pathetic. Asians should actually consider situations from a personal/individualistic/sincere point of view as opposed to trying to posture only in order to gain brownie points from whoever they are trying to impress. I do not rule out the fact that maybe you sincerely meant what you said, but I have seen it so many times, asian people carelessly stepping on other asians merely in order to try to prove themselves. </p>

		<p>I am a Queenslander (same as Billy Sing) and I agree with the Chinese.</p>
<p>Regardless of the merits of the film, he was half Chinese and to play him as a white guy, robs his memory of a large part of his identity.</p>
<p>A book recently came out about him and I have been fortunate enough to read it.</p>
<p>Billy Sing was a remarkable man. He was a poor man from northern Queensland, who made a living through being a professional kangaroo shooter (the job still exists today).</p>
<p>He never asked for favours and never complained. When his country called he went without hesitation.</p>
<p>He was without a doubt the best sniper on Gallipoli (including killing the best Turkish sniper in a duel). He scored about 250 confirmed kills. </p>
<p>What makes him more remarkable was that a confirmed kill was not recognised unless an officer saw or approved it (there would have been many more by this fact alone) and if he killed a man in a trench who was not his intended target he refused to claim the kill (there were many eye witnesses who testify to this and it apparently happened often).</p>
<p>Added to this he spent 2 - 3 years on the Western Front and nobody at that stage of the war kept count with snipers (so one can only assume many more victims of his marksmanship).</p>
<p>I understand that there was a great US sniper in Vietnam who has 300+ kills and the WW2 Soviets (but who can trust there propaganda).</p>
<p>Given this, there is a good chance that he was the greatest sniper of all time.</p>
<p>He came home and refused any adjulation and got back to work as a working class man. Never asked for any special treatment and actively shunned it.</p>
<p>His &#8216;war&rsquo; caught up with him though and he became an alcoholic. He worked as a short term labourer in Brisbane until his 50&rsquo;s until he died suddenly in a boarding (flop) house on Mantague Road, West End, Brisbane. Nobody attended his funeral. I drive past where he died often and still give him a mumbled salute as I past.</p>
<p>I think he was great man.</p>

		<p>I agree with the protesters on this score.  I&rsquo;m a fan of war movies, and my pet peeve is historical inaccuracy, whether it&rsquo;s the wrong weapons, wrong aircraft, wrong tanks, whatever.  I eagerly anticipated &#8220;Flyboys&#8221; until I actually saw the blasted piece.  The US was described as entering the war during the film, which places the time as early 1917.  The Germans, however, were not using the Fokker triplane until the end of that year.  Their main fighters at the time were the Albatros D-II and D-III, the Halberstadt D-II and the Fokker D-V, none of which were triplanes.  Casting a white guy as Sing is simply more of the same crud.  Surely there is a young Eurasian guy in Australia, Hong Kong or Singapore they could cast in the role.</p>
<p>The Vietnam sniper Poy mentions was marine sniper Carlos Hathcock.  Only 93 kills were confirmed, because confirmation rules in the marines meant that an acting third party had to observe the kill.  Since Hathcock almost always operated with only a spotter and no third observer, most of his kills were &#8220;unofficial&#8221;.  He was so successful that the North Vietnamese army put a $30,000 bounty on Hathcock; Hathcock killed every North Vietnamese sniper who tried to collect it.<br>

<p>Oh please, spare me the psychoanalysis. Look, Sing is EURASIAN. If He was 100% Chinese and a white actor was chosen to play him, yeah I would be annoyed (as a Chinese person myself) out of simple inaccuracy. But Sing is neither Chinese nor White, just something in between. As i&rsquo;ve said before, a eurasian actor would&rsquo;ve been ideal.</p>
<p>And what you described about asians perfectly fits the Koreans I&rsquo;v met. These Koreans look down on other asians yet bootlick to whites. What shame. Apparently. South Korea being an American satellite state since the &rsquo;50s is playing the slave role quite well&hellip;</p>

<p>Are you really that naive? A eurasian actor is ideal, but not really practical. At most there would probably only be a handful of possible candidates. Everybody can tell if a person is full white or not, with the other races there can be some ambiguity with regards to a mixed person. THAT is why they should have gone ahead and hired a chinese person. Its just easier, more practical, and the pool of viable candidates is far larger than if you were looking for a eurasian actor. So please spare us your awesomely insightful logic thats bereft of any observation of the obvious.</p>

<p>That I wouldnt doubt, chinese are equally if not more guilty. And yes, SK is nothing more than a satellite state, you hit the nail on the head, but that still doesnt invalidate what I said earlier. Enough already, im sure that the fine readers at AMREN could care less about our interasian squabbling. good day to you sir and goodbye</p>

		<p>Looking at the one picture I&rsquo;ve been able to find of Sing, I&rsquo;d say he looked a bit more white than Chinese. He certainly does not look as if he would fit in well if he lived in Beijing, for example. Because of this, I see no problem having a dark-haired, dark-eyed white playing him. However, I think that it is ridiculous to have a white play his father and to not even portray him as partially Chinese. That&rsquo;s just playing with the historical record too much.</p>

		<p>If the ROK is a satellite state, just what is poor, starving North Korea?  They seem to have combined the worst features of Soviet Bolshevism with medieval Asian despotism.  Or, put another way, in which of the two Koreas would you rather live?</p>

		<p>But no one is complaining about Law And Order and their portrayal of most major minority crimes as committed by white people.  The Wisconsin Hmong Massacre and the DC Sniper episodes.  Guess who was the antagonist on both of those programs?  You guessed it, black Jews.  Just kidding. Whites get the award.</p>
