<h1>Brothers Sentenced to Six Years for &#8216;Heinous&rsquo; Attack</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matt Gryta, Buffalo News, May 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two teen-age brothers Wednesday were sentenced to six years in state prison for their brutal attack on on a white man walking with his African-American girlfriend.</p>
<p>Both Donte A. Lee, 18, and his half-brother Antoine Blackmon, 16, of Newburgh Avenue were denied youthful offender status and taken into custody about 10:45 a.m.</p>
<p>State Supreme Court Justice Christopher J. Burns told the tearful teens that youthful offender status is for mistakes committed by youth, stressing that the attack &#8220;was not a mistake&#8221; deserving of noncriminal treatment.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was an innocent man walking down the street. There&rsquo;s no excuse for this kind of violence,&#8221; Burns told the two.</p>
<p>Their victim, Brian Milligan, 19, of Depew, still suffers from memory lapses due to the severe head injuries he suffered in the late-night attack on Genesee Street near Floor Avenue last Aug. 18.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Defense attorney Terrence D. McKelvey insisted their younger cousin, who was 12 when the attack occurred and is being prosecuted as a juvenile in Family Court, instigated the brutal stomping incident.</p>
<p>Although the attack initially was suspected of being a race-related crime, prosecutor Lawrence M. Schwegler described it as &#8220;a heinous, stupid senseless&#8221; crime.</p>
<p>McKelvey conceded that Lee and Blackmon &#8220;exercised extremely poor judgment,&#8221; {snip}.</p>

<p>Otherwise these youth would be facing the kind of sentences handed out to white youth for far less violent crimes,and we cant have that can we? </p>

If you go to the link, you&rsquo;ll find that the Buffalo News disabled the comment section. Generally, they let people comment and when it gets too intense, they disable the comments and remove them. In this case, they disabled the comments first.</p>
<p>The police keep saying it wasn&rsquo;t a hate crime because the GROUP of teens (not just two brothers) who attacked Brian didn&rsquo;t know he was dating a black girl. It seems that the line of reasoning they were following was that since they didn&rsquo;t know his girlfriend was blacks, it wasn&rsquo;t motivated by hate.</p>
<p>The real issue is that this GANG attack, where they beat Brian on his skull with a chunk of concrete, involved a GROUP of black teens who for some unknown reason attacked the first person they saw who just happened to be white.</p>
<p>What we got from the prosecutor was &#8216;while it may LOOK like a hate crime, it wasn&rsquo;t. Case closed&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no wonder the Buffalo News posted this without comments. White folks are very ticked off about this blatant double standard.<br>

		<p>A white guy gets 15 years for burning a cross on a black man&rsquo;s lawn but two blacks get less than half that sentence for physically beating a white guy which leaves brain damage.<br>

		<p>Obviously only white people can hate, just as only white people can be racist.  There is no other way to explain the way the law is applied.  </p>

		<p>This is the problem with &#8220;hate crime&#8221; legislation. The prosecution is often politically motivated.</p>

<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t think like you and I? If they made a public display of coming down on these perps for their attack of a white man dating black girl, it would just encourage more of this same attacks? Then again, crime stats would have nothing to lose - except that probably plenty of white men do work with black women during the day.</p>
<p>Speaking of not thinking the same way, why is it, with whites, you&rsquo;re better off among a group of them rather than meeting one alone but with blacks all it takes is more than one and the danger level escalates.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Beating up a white guy with black girlfriend is not a hate crime &mdash; if assailants are black&#8221;.</p>
<p>Blacks beating whites is not a hate crime. Words spoken by whites, that is a hate crime. I think the implication with the story here is - it&rsquo;s not a hate crime because they didn&rsquo;t know his girlfriend was black/the black girl was his girlfriend. The key being the black girlfriend. Blacks beating up whites who are dating black girls, that could be a hate crime, because the black woman in a sense could be considered a victim. Will this go down on the books as a hate crime against blacks? </p>
<p>Who knows what they are saying though&hellip; It&rsquo;s an awfully complex thing when liberals begin the determination process of telling us right from wrong. That&rsquo;s about the kindest thing you can say about it. </p>

		<p>Actually the comments were posted for a few hours before they were taken down.  The comments were all questioning why this was not charged as a hate crime.  I emailed the reporter, Matt Gryta at mgryta@buffnews.com and asked why he or his editor removed the comments and essentially censored the article.  He replied, &#8220;what censoring.&#8221;  I suggest everyone email Mr. Gryta and ask for an explanation.  The Libtards only believe in free speech when it&rsquo;s something they believe in.  </p>

		<p>While I have little sympathy for people that date/marry/reproduce outside of their race, and even less for those stupid enough to walk around in a dangerous(see: black) area at night without an automatic firearm, the double standard is simply sickening.</p>

		<p>In legal jargon, this attack is what is referred to as &#8220;savage and barbaric&#8221;. Unprovoked, without cause, violent in the extreme with the intent to harm for no reason, much less a good reason. Anyone witnessing such an attack would be within their legal rights to use lethal force to defend the person being mobbed and beaten.</p>
<p>I think everyone that is on this forum realizes that these sort of attacks occur more often than we would like to admit. Blacks mobbing and viciously, &#8220;savagely&#8221; attacking whites for absolutely no reason other than just plain old ordinary hate.</p>

		<p>A six year sentence doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean six years in jail.  Lots of things can happen after the perps are in prison.  I would bet that they get lots of time off for &#8220;good behavior&#8221;.  </p>
