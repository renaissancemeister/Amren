			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Allen, London Telegraph, May 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 60-year-old lawyer ripped a Muslim woman&rsquo;s Islamic veil off in a row in a clothing shop in what police say is France&rsquo;s first case of &#8220;burka rage&#8221;.</p>
<p>The astonishing scene unfolded during a weekend shopping trip after the woman lawyer took offence at the attire of a fellow shopper resulting in argument during which the pair came to blows before being arrested.</p>
<p>It came as racial tensions grow in the country as it prepares to introduce a total ban on burkas and other forms of religious dress which cover the face.</p>
<p>A 26-year-old Muslim convert was walking through the store in Trignac, near Nantes, in the western Loire-Atlantique region, when she overhead the woman lawyer making &#8220;snide remarks about her black burka&#8221;. A police officer close to the case said: &#8220;The lawyer said she was not happy seeing a fellow shopper wearing a veil and wanted the ban introduced as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>At one point the lawyer, who was out with her daughter, is said to have likened the Muslim woman to Belphegor, a horror demon character well known to French TV viewers. Belphegor is said to haunt the Louvre museum in Paris and frequently covers up his hideous features using a mask.</p>
<p>An argument started before the older woman is said to have ripped the other woman&rsquo;s veil off. As they came to blows, the lawyer&rsquo;s daughter joined in.</p>
<p>&#8220;The shop manager and the husband of the Muslim woman moved to break up the fighting,&#8221; the officer said. All three were arrested and taken to the local gendarmerie for questioning.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Trignac police said that two complaints had been received, with the Muslim woman accusing the lawyer of racial and religious assault. The latter, in turn, had accused her opponent of common assault.</p>
<p>The French parliament has adopted a formal motion declaring burkas and other forms of Islamic dress to be &#8220;an affront to the nation&rsquo;s values.&#8221; Some have accused criminals, from terrorists to shoplifters, of wearing veils to disguise themselves.</p>
<p>A ban, which could be introduced as early as the autumn, would make France the second country after Belgium to outlaw the Islamic veil in public places.</p>
<p>But many have criticised the anti-burka lobby, which includes the French President Nicolas Sarkozy, for stigmatising Muslim housewives.</p>
<p>Many French woman from council estates are forced to wear the veils because of pressure from authoritarian husbands.</p>
<p>The promise of a ban has prompted warnings of racial tensions in a country which is home to some five million Muslims  &mdash;  one of the religion&rsquo;s largest communities in Europe.</p>
<p>Mr Sarkozy&rsquo;s cabinet is to examine a draft bill which will impose one-year prison sentences and fines of up to £14,000 on men who force their wives to wear a burka.</p>
<p>Women themselves will face a smaller fine of just over £100 because they are &#8220;often victims with no choice in the matter&#8221;, says the draft.</p>
<p>The law would create a new offence of &#8220;incitement to cover the face for reasons of gender&#8221;.</p>
<p>And it would state: &#8220;No one may wear in public places clothes that are aimed at hiding the face.&#8221;<br>

		<p>After the burka came off, did the Arab women magically turn into a White French Catholic?  I suspect not. The burka is not the problem.  The muslims are.  Deluded marxist whites allowed their country to be invaded.  Both the muslim and the marxist must be driven out of White lands.</p>

		<p>Note, the woman in the burka was a convert.  Apparently, French youth have found a way to outrage their establishment.  Oh, that is so cool, so chic!  Idiots.</p>

<p>Well if the French woman ripped off the veil and THAT started the fight the French woman committed the first act of assault. Regardless of what people&rsquo;s opinions are insulting and then ripping a strangers veil off is very very rude and she should be prosected.</p>

		<p>Instead of worrying about what their husbands will do to them if they can&rsquo;t wear burkas, why doesn&rsquo;t Sarkozy just admit that Islam is a filthy, sexist religion, one that has no place in the freedom-loving nation of France.</p>

<p>Soon France will be having riots like Greece when their cuts in pensions, salaries and benefits get larger.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll be a nice situation then won&rsquo;t it, with inter-racial fights like this one, thousands of cars being torched every night, and everyone at each other&rsquo;s throats in that multicultural utopia?</p>

		<p>Seems like their intent is to have the Muslims leave France due to &#8220;hostility&#8221; toward their dress.  Seems to me diversity has been a curse everywhere.  Seems to me the easiest solution is just pass a law expelling Muslims, Gypsies, every body foreign born rather than dance around trying to pass laws alluding to the desire rather than just stating the desire right out:  We are sick of you.  We want you to leave.  NOW.</p>

		<p>Five million Muslims in France - That isn&rsquo;t a community, it is the nebulus of a future Islamic nation in Europe. Just as America imported the future Black nation, and has now imported a future Latino nation, Europeans have given part of their continent to Islam.

		<p>&#8220;Many French woman from council estates are forced to wear the veils because of pressure from authoritarian husbands.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would wager anything that this &#8220;26-year old Muslim convert&#8221;, though French, is married to a Muslim.  That is how it happens. It is quite common.</p>
<p>Those &#8220;authoritarian husbands&#8221; are Muslims!   &mdash;   although I note the article carefully sidesteps mentioning that.   (It lets us assume that lots of Frenchmen force their wives to wear veils.] </p>
<p>Incidentally (for Americans) those &#8220;council estates&#8221; are  what we call housing projects. I could add that this incident happened in a very conservative part of France, a very different place than Paris. (These people never even accepted the French Revolution.) I&rsquo;m glad to see that someone in France is showing some backbone. I hope she does not suffer for it. At 60, she may be retired. Her law career is over anyway, so maybe she can afford to speak out.</p>
<p>But all said, I find this sort of squabbling about clothing to be merely diversionary. It&rsquo;s a distraction away from the heart of the problem, which is that these colonizing  Muslims are there AT ALL. Personally, I don&rsquo;t really care what they wear. That&rsquo;s not the main issue.</p>

		<p>Everytime I see a walking tent I want to rip the thing apart, as this woman did. I know it sounds horrible, but this is my country and I am tired of being exposed to alien Islamic symbols. Is there really a law saying we have to be tolerant? That is to say, can the libs really force their beliefs on us?</p>

<p>We can&rsquo;t blame the husband for this, the woman is a convert! She CHOSE to convert to Islam (and that is a choice, a Christian woman can marry a Muslim man without converting).  Plus when the fight broke out HE was trying to break it up! Sorry but that is NOT an overly controlling husband, that is a husband trying to keep his spit-fire wife out of trouble.</p>

		<p>I agree with Liv, I see the veil as a safety hazard. Can you imagine some of these veil clad women working in a factory and parts of their veil get caught in a machine, they would have the nerve to sue the company? They probably complained when they were told that they could not wear the veil at work due to being a safety hazard.</p>

		<p>Anonymous I suspect your comments were sarcasm&hellip;but&hellip;a lot of these veiled wives came here as veiled brides and that is all they have EVER known.</p>
<p>They should NOT be allowed to immigrate to western countries, and their husbands should not have been allowed to either, but if they grew up wearing the veil some depend on it and it is a comfort zone. Imagine if western women were sold off to places where women went bare chested, many many of them would NOT want to be seen in public that way, and judged and criticized, and would surely want to wear a top.</p>

No,the words &#8220;because of pressure from authoritarian husbands&#8221; is a direct quote from the original story.  Those were not my words. I merely pointed out that those &#8220;authoritarian husbands&#8221; are Moslems.  After all, French husbands don&rsquo;t &#8220;pressure&#8221; their wives to wear veils and  burkas.</p>
<p>According to other sources, the woman was wearing<i> &#8220;le voile intégral&#8221;</i>   &mdash;   the complete veil. The older woman made a comment to her daughter  (that they belonged in their own country), and the veiled woman heard it, then struck the first blow, also hitting the daughter.<br>

		<p>Sarkozy is a typical double talking politician.  He is talking tough about the veil while at the same time making deals to allow in large numbers of more muslims.  Probably what is happening is that the French people are reacting to this most visible sign or muslim intrusion.  This is very jarring to the French and no doubt they have been complaining about it.  Most likely Sarkozy wants it both ways, he wants to appease his globalist bosses with more muslim immigration while trying to calm the French population.  It could be that he believes that people won&rsquo;t notice the extent of the muslim invasion if they do not see women wearing the veil.  Without the veil they would not stand out from the population so dramatically.</p>
