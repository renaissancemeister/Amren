			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fay Schlesinger, Daily Mail (London), May 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A toddler was ordered off a bus because the foreign driver was &#8216;offended&rsquo; by his England football T-shirt, his mother has claimed.</p>
<p>Sam Fardon, 27, was allegedly told to get off the service with her sons Dylan, two, and 10-week-old Adam as they made their way to a childcare group.</p>
<p>The unnamed driver, who had a Polish or Eastern European accent, said Dylan&rsquo;s white England shirt was &#8216;offensive&rsquo; and he threatened to turf the family out on the street.</p>
<p>But he faced a torrent of anger from incredulous passengers, and minutes later backed down and allowed the family to board.</p>
<p>The bus company has launched an investigation.</p>
<p>Miss Fardon, who also has a ten-year-old step-son, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, said: &#8216;He (the driver) said: &#8220;He won&rsquo;t be wearing that during the World Cup, will he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8216;I said Dylan would and the bus driver said: &#8220;I find that really offensive. You should dress your family in less offensive clothes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8216;I was completely gobsmacked. He said we&rsquo;d have to get off the bus but I argued with him and other passengers backed me up, so he let us on.</p>
<p>&#8216;I think it&rsquo;s disgraceful. I had baby Adam with me as well, but luckily he wasn&rsquo;t wearing his England baby-grow.</p>
<p>&#8216;I just think because of the nationality of the driver and Dylan being so young, he picked on him because he couldn&rsquo;t answer back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Miss Fardon&rsquo;s partner Chris Hall, a taxi driver, was so angry he defiantly bought England strips for all the children.</p>
<p>Mr Hall, 55, said: &#8216;It&rsquo;s just showing support for your country during a World Cup  &mdash;  there&rsquo;s nothing offensive about it. I will have England flags on my taxi.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Selwyn Brown, of North Staffordshire bus users group Aces, said: &#8216;It&rsquo;s unbelievable. Assuming it&rsquo;s true, the bus driver is to be condemned.</p>
<p>&#8216;Not just because there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with wearing an England shirt, but that it was a little child. It&rsquo;s totally ludicrous.&rsquo;</p>
<p>First Bus said it is investigating Miss Fardon&rsquo;s complaint, which was made after she caught the 34A service from Newcastle Bus Station, in Stoke-on-Trent, at 9am last Thursday.</p>
<p>Spokesman Paul De Santis said: &#8216;We are fully supporting England&rsquo;s World Cup campaign and will be putting supporting material in all our buses.</p>
<p>&#8216;No one should have to accept those sorts of comments, certainly none of our customers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Last month the Metropolitan Police suggested that some pubs ban customers from wearing England shirts during screenings of this summer&rsquo;s World Cup matches to stop the risk of violence.</p>
<p>But one fan said: &#8216;We often hear of a loss of pride in Britain, and now police want to ban the England shirt. It&rsquo;s like saying anyone who wears one is a yob.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve stated this before, Britain will probably be the first European country to go under.  They are far ahead of the U.S. in total insanity per capita.  The more of these incidents that I hear about coming from the UK the less surprised I get.  Unfortunately this is also happening here in the U.S.  Amren has displayed enough articles indicating this.  But it is far advanced in the UK.  I actually heard something somewhere that about 70% of White Britons want to leave the country.  They better get some backbone and fight for what&rsquo;s theirs.</p>

<p>They, unfortunately, cannot. Britain is not a free country like the United States (although even that is debatable these days) and Britons cannot so much as own firearms&hellip;let alone what they would need to defeat the government forces (British military).</p>
<p>Also don&rsquo;t forget that the state keeps tabs on British citizens at ALL times and you cannot fall &#8216;off the grid&rsquo; unless you go live naked in the wilderness pretty much. Especially with RFID tags going on everything these days.</p>
<p>It should further be noted that the British people are, by and large, extraordinarily poor. They receive government assistance in virtually every aspect of their lives with little in the way of private assets. What little they receive in the form of wages is either paid to the government (taxes) or used up for subsistence.</p>
<p>That is our future if things do not change soon.</p>

<p>I doubt the violence is coming from those wearing the England shirts. A better way to stop the violence would be to ban the foreigners instead.</p>

		<p>Reminds me of an incident at the last world cup. At the time I was working on a housing project (low income housing) in the uk.</p>
<p>The entire street had decorated their homes with England flags and bunting, it looked amazing. Some numb nut then complained that it was racist. No specifics just racist. I had one hell of a time trying to get the powers that be not to ask tenants to remove the flags.</p>
<p>Utter madness.  </p>

		<p>Personally, I find it hard to believe that a Pole in England would object to a toddler wearing an English football t-shirt. I&rsquo;m thinking that the driver is either an Albanian Muslim, a Bosnian Muslim, or a gypsy. I speculate this, because I note the article never identified the driver by name; and a Muslim would be more offended by a football t-shirt than a Pole would.</p>

<p>Since when do Poles or other Eastern Europeans get offended by &#8220;England&#8221; sport T-shirts?  Would this driver be a Chechen Muslim?</p>

		<p>I am certain now that British subjects are subject to subliminal indoctrination being broadcast via their TV programming.  </p>
<p>This is combined with drugs in their food and water designed to intensify and enhance their video brainwashing experience.  </p>
<p>The main concern of tyrannical governments has always been how to effectively and economically subdue the masses from day to day.  </p>
<p>The British Parliament would have spared no expense to develop countless ways to accomplish this.  </p>
<p>It appears they have succeeded&hellip;    </p>

		<p>As I&rsquo;ve said time and time again, the world&rsquo;s newest pasttime is becoming &#8216;being offended.&rsquo;It is almost illegal in liberal societies to &#8216;offend&rsquo; someone. First, Second and Capitol Offending will soon be charges brought in court.</p>
<p>I keep being reminded of one of my all-time favorite movies, &#8220;Vacation&#8221; when, near the end, the black security guard whines, &#8220;He offended my dignity, Mr. Wally!&#8221;</p>

<p>Well I disagree with this. I&rsquo;ve been to Britain several times and most people are not poor. However, like here in the USA, the poor there are often poor because of their irresponsibility and do recieve a lot of government aid in every aspect of their lives.</p>

		<p>The correct answer to a public employee who refuses you service because he or she claims to be &#8220;offended&#8221; is &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>As in &#8220;No, I will not get off this bus.&#8221;  Practice saying &#8220;No&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s easy.  It&rsquo;s one syllable.  Saying &#8220;No&#8221; is habit-forming, and it feels good, as does the look of shock and outrage on the face of some public servant (these tend to think of themselves as public &#8220;masters&#8221; for reasons that are not exactly clear) who expects grovelling obedience like it&rsquo;s some God-given right of theirs.</p>
<p>No.</p>

		<p>I will bet my fully paid for Marin County Ca. 3,000 sq feet house on 2 acres of land with a swimming pool worth more than 2 million dollars that the only reason the bus driver found the England T shirt offensive is that he went through several of those diversity and multicult seminars run by the bus company and was told that anything pro indigenious British was verboten!!!!!</p>
<p>He was probably also told that wearing crosses, even the tiniest earrings and Catholic clerical dress by priests or nuns was also offensive and absolutely verboten on the bus system.</p>
