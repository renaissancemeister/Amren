<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In what can only be construed as a complete loss of any semblance of goodness and morality in the name of multicultural poison, the most advanced civilization on the world is sanctioning .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. clitorectomies. They have issued a policy statement suggesting that doctors in the US perform a mild form of this sick barbarity on girls to keep their families from sending them overseas for it.</p>
<p>According to the New York Times, the American Academy of Pediatrics last week advocated that American doctors be allowed to stick girls&rsquo; clitorises with a needle so as to satisfy Muslim and African families&rsquo; demand for female genital mutilation: &#8220;It might be more effective if federal and state laws enabled pediatricians to reach out to families by offering a ritual nick as a possible compromise to avoid greater harm.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Georganne Chapin, executive director of Intact America, a group defending women from this practice, was &#8220;astonished that a group of intelligent people did not see the utter slippery slope&#8221; that the AAP had started on by allowing for the &#8220;ritual nick.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Also, this is not the first time that the New York Times has given clitorectomies its tacit approval: in January 2008 it painted a rosy picture of the ritual in a piece that never mentioned the pain, bleeding, and infections that often result from it.</p>
<p>Female genital mutilation is not the only horrific Islamic custom that is coming West. The number of honor killings is skyrocketing in Europe and America. It has been reported that thousands of girls in the United Kingdom have been mutilated and the authorities can&rsquo;t (or won&rsquo;t) stop it. To the credit of the U.K. media, at least they have been having a public discussion about it. It&rsquo;s happening here, but to speak of it publicly would insult CAIR.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>By G-d, these are our daughters. This is our culture that these clueless dhimmi buffoons are throwing away with both hands. No matter how you couch this argument, and the New York Times is the master of velvet-tongued barbarity, what the American Academy of Pediatrics has done is grotesque  &mdash;  and it will lead to more approval for Sharia teachings on women.</p>
<p>Our daughters and granddaughters will be the ones who will suffer for it.<br>

								<h2><a href="http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=a0f1c0cf-2452-42eb-bf75-b56f354f9dce&amp;k=84150">Cautious Criticism</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Zosia Bielski, National Post (Toronto), August 25, 2007</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Academia&rsquo;s fixation on cultural sensitivity is changing the debate around female genital mutilation, with a growing number of professors and women&rsquo;s rights activists becoming hesitant to condemn the practice.</p>
<p>Where feminists rallied against the operation from the pages of MS. magazine in the 1970s, today&rsquo;s critics are infinitely more cautious, with most suggesting that the Western world butt out until Muslim African communities are ready to reconsider what they are doing to their daughters.</p>
<p>The shift in attitudes about the practice  &mdash;  which in the worst of cases involves the carving out of a woman&rsquo;s clitoris and inner labia and can cause lifelong urinary tract infections, sterility and even death  &mdash;  comes at a time when high-profile victims of the operation such as writer Ayaan Hirsi Ali and model Waris Dirie, both Somalis, have launched very public campaigns against the practice.</p>
<p>The issue is so explosive, it has two names  &mdash;  female genital mutilation, or FGM, to those most vociferously opposed to the practice; and female genital cutting, or FGC, to those in the less-condemning camp.</p>
<p>The latter includes the chair of anthropology at the University of Toronto, who has written a new book on the subject. Although not prepared to defend what she calls FGC, Janice Boddy defends women who undergo the operation and want the practice to continue in future generations.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are good reasons within the society for the operation to continue, but these are cultural reasons. They are not scientific ones,&#8221; says Prof. Boddy, author of Civilizing Women: British Crusades in Colonial Sudan.</p>
<p>Working through British and Sudanese archives, she looks at the history of FGC in that country, particularly European colonial interactions with the practice, from British nurses attempting to re-educate Sudanese midwives in the 1920s, to the country&rsquo;s outlawing of the practice in 1946 amid Western pressure.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&rsquo;t a happy situation by any means. I wouldn&rsquo;t want it to continue. But I think that up until this point, the West has not been particularly helpful in the way that it&rsquo;s gone about trying to assist in the eradication,&#8221; Prof. Boddy says.</p>
<p>Prevalent in, though not exclusive to, Muslim societies, particularly in Sudan, Somalia, northern Kenya and parts of Ethiopia and Indonesia, female genital mutilation takes on its most severe form in infibulation, or pharaonic circumcision.</p>
<p>This can involve the removal of both the clitoris and inner labia with crude instruments such as razors. The entire vagina is then sewn up with thread, or fastened with thorns.</p>
<p>In this way, a woman&rsquo;s virginity  &mdash;  considered especially important by Muslim men  &mdash;  can be proven before her father is paid the bride price.</p>
<p>The Sudanese, Prof. Boddy argues, are a fiercely guarded culture, one that sees the practice as a defence of their people against intruders, and, astonishingly, as protection against injury.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cultural context in which this practice takes place supports the idea of enclosing the body against harm,&#8221; she writes in her book. The social body is closed against intrusion from the outside by marriages between relatives. People marry cousins&hellip; . The kinship system is quite closed. That image of the defensive society, the defensive social body, is carried over into this idea of defending the physical body.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea of closing the womb, which is the most precious organ of the female body, is very highly supported by other kinds of practices.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although not outlined in the Koran, FGM is so ingrained in cultural norms that it will not be easily eradicated, she says.</p>
<p>Rather, the West must support local counsellors (she names the international women&rsquo;s rights organization Rainbo as one) working on the ground with women to change their notions of marriageability.</p>
<p>The professor also says she would like to see &#8220;more science&#8221; in the arguments against FGM  &mdash;  she takes issue with how often it causes shock and death. To a degree, she also aligns feminists who are ardently opposed to the operation with British imperialists.</p>
<p>Today, Prof. Boddy says, the battle cry is human rights. Back then, it was colonial notions of civilizing the other. It&rsquo;s a stance that pits her against many critics, including the World Health Organization, which called for the absolute abolition of the practice in the 1970s.</p>
<p>The human rights group Amnesty International considers FGM a form of violence against women, and the end result of discriminatory attitudes and beliefs. But even their representatives are careful when speaking of the operation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The motivation is not one of malice or desire to hurt but really to make sure that the daughter is taken care of,&#8221; says Cheryl Hotchkiss, women&rsquo;s rights campaigner with Amnesty International Canada.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what needs to be examined from a human rights perspective is why is it that in order for a woman to live a good life does she have to undergo such an extreme experience?</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s entirely conceivable that a woman may willingly subject herself to it, but our question is, did she willingly subject herself to it because there were so few options to it? That&rsquo;s a core issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prof. Boddy&rsquo;s book has received criticism for leaving Sudanese men out of her discussion. In focusing on the way women perform, perpetuate and desire the practice (since it ensures marriageability), critics say she fails to address the ostracism and potential violence women may face unless they submit.</p>
<p>But these are Western discourses, Prof. Boddy says, arguing that in Sudan, it is women who have power in the domestic sphere.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can abhor the sin, but you can love the sinner,&#8221; she concludes. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t want them to receive the blame from the West for doing what they think is in the best interests of their daughters because otherwise they won&rsquo;t be marriageable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ms. Hotchkiss says the key lies in changing those notions of desirability, likely through a combination of state law, grassroots efforts and intervention by the medical community.</p>
<p>&#8220;[These societies] see women&rsquo;s bodies used as the holders of tradition. That&rsquo;s still because the society sees women&rsquo;s bodies as not their own. They see them as a tool.</p>
<p>&#8220;What Amnesty&rsquo;s desperately trying to get across, along with women&rsquo;s human rights activists the world over, is that women&rsquo;s bodies are their own and they need the right to say what is and what isn&rsquo;t going to happen to them.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Why stop with clitorectomies? In the name of joyous multi-culturalism we could expand the list of quaint cultural customs to include ritual stoning, honor killings, child slavery, and the routine murder of infidels, which could include Catholics, all Protestants, Jews, and atheists.</p>

		<p>This is truly  a sickening and barbaric practice.  Often it is performed by the elder women in the tribe or family.  As an American, I&rsquo;ve often wondered how odd it would be to have my own grandmother mutilating my lady parts  &mdash;   or to put it more bluntly, chopping off my clit and labia.</p>
<p>Not only is this procedure harmful, excruciatingly painful, but the repercussions are awful as well.  For example, when a woman gives birth, her entire &#8220;infibulated&#8221; vagina, now has to be cut open from top, to anus.  Can you imagine the unnecessary complications this causes?</p>
<p>Perhaps the rise in childbirth mortality for women is related to these kinds of people bringing their customs into the U.S.</p>
<p>Everyone is quick to condemn a fatty for eating too much and indirectly raising healthcare costs, but when it comes to the almighty Muslims and their disgusting African customs-HEAVENS NO!</p>
<p>It is also well known that their &#8220;kinship&#8221; networks are just another term for in breeding.  Cousins marry cousins (first cousins mind you) for generation upon generation and then we wonder why they have so many problems&hellip;. </p>

		<p> Pure logic dictates that; in a truly multicultural society in which all cultures are equal; that the practices, customs, religious beliefs and laws of all cultures be practiced without  any interference from any other culture.<br>
 The only thing that all other cultures seem to agree on is to call for the complete destruction of the white race.</p>

<p>No Ms. Geller, they are not MY daughters.  Maybe yours but not mine.  If Western society is racist, Ms. Geller, then you are the poster-girl.  In a multicultural, multiracial, multireligious we must respect all traditions, not just those you, Ms. Geller, approve of.  Clitorectomies are pretty much the female variant of circumcision and should be treated as such.  We have no business telling people in other countries how to live.  And we have even less right to tell them how to live after we have invited (or brought in as refugees) them into our nation.  No, Ms. Geller, they are here and they have rights that we MUST respect.</p>

		<p>I think  most folks are totally unaware that such a practice, a medical &#8220;procedure&#8221; like this even exists. That someone would even conceive of such an idea even seems preposterous. &#8220;It cannot be&#8221; is the normal reaction in the &#8220;west&#8221;.</p>
<p>Back in the 1970&rsquo;s people JUST CAME OUT AND SAID STOP!!</p>
<p>Now they have to exercise restraint when even speaking about &#8220;stopping&#8221; this barbarism. Afraid of offending.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure I disagree with this.  This is a slippery slope, as they say, but it looks to me to be slipping in the other direction.  Not so much that we are slipping into making this acceptable but that they are slipping into allowing a &#8220;token&#8221; procedure to replace the real thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a very large step but it IS a step in the right direction&hellip;..insisting our mores, and not theirs, determines behavior.</p>
<p>Of course, what we should be doing is not allowing them to come here to begin with.  At the very least, we should make it clear that indulging in behavior like this will result in immediate deportation.  In other words, aggressively assert our cultural mores at least and our racial control and demographic dominance, more preferably.  The US isn&rsquo;t yet at the point where that is the dominant attitude.  Getting closer though.<br>

		<p>Whatever primitives choose to do, whether in America or not, so long as it has no deleterious effect upon White people, is of absolutely no concern to me. That said, we who continue the bizarre and unnatural, alien practice of male circumcision should be careful about how much sanctimony we spout on this issue!   </p>

		<p>OK: I&rsquo;ve had enough of hearing FGM referred to as &#8216;Female Circumcision&rsquo;.  And I&rsquo;m sick of Men using this as an excuse to vent their &#8216;issues&rsquo; with male Circumcision, as it is practiced in the West.</p>
<p>Female castration would be a more accurate term for FGM.  Even a &#8216;simple&rsquo; Clitoridectomy is a life-changing and unthinkable thing.  And what happens to many FGM victims goes beyond description.  Frankly, FGM, in many cases, is a fate worse than death.</p>
<p>As an upper-middle-class WASP, I have lived surrounded by men who have been circumcised.  I grew up in a nation founded and shaped by such men.  It would be absurd to assume any sort of widespread debilitating effect from Circumcision, considering that these men created the greatest nation and culture that the world has ever known.</p>
<p>FGM, at its mildest, robs women of the capacity to enjoy sex.  American men have never had that problem.  Women talk and compare, and so I can pass along &#8216;girlfriend stories&rsquo; from all my female chums (and myself) attesting to the ability of young and youngish Circumcised men to stay&hellip;.ahem&hellip;&rsquo;happily busy&rsquo;&hellip;.for protracted periods of time.  I seriously doubt that debilitated men could, or would want to,&hellip;ahem&hellip;&rsquo;engage their female counterparts&rsquo; for entire weekends, as plenty of circumcised American men do.  My circumcised DH says that if that part of his body offered any more entertainment value than it already does, he would not get any work done.  He likes himself, just as he is. How many women who have had their parts taken off with a rusty can lid feel that way?</p>
<p>Circumcision conveys certain subtle advantages, in many areas of life, that I cannot describe without being too graphic.  Yes, there is a decrease in sensory input, but that, apparently, has its advantages.  I know women who have dated and married across class and ethnic boundaries, who have been frustrated by the &#8216;sensory overload&rsquo; situations they get into with their circumcised partners.</p>
<p>There is no equivalency between Female Genital Mutilation, and Male Circumcision (as it is practiced in modern Western nations).</p>

		<p>Perosnally I don&rsquo;t care if Muslims and Africans want to have female circumcisions performed on their daughters. If it decreases their sexual drive that would be a great thing. We don&rsquo;t need these people having more children. </p>
<p>Why do whites spend their time constantly trying to save everyone? I wish more Muslims and Africans would have this procedure done, anything that highlights the fact that they are different from us is good, anything that seperates them from us is good.</p>

		<p>Why do they always say a Muslim custom? It is NOT Muslim it is African! Muslims always circumcize their boys just like Jews do (but at the age of 8 years, not 8 days). The most fanatical Muslim countries (Iran, Saudi, etc&hellip;) do NOT practice female circumcism.</p>
