<h1>17 States Now Filing Versions of Arizona&rsquo;s Immigration Bill SB 1070</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Press Release, MMD Newswire, May 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One of America&rsquo;s national organizations fighting against illegal immigration is announcing that 17 states are now filing versions of Arizona&rsquo;s SB 1070 law which is designed to help local police enforce America&rsquo;s existing immigration laws.</p>
<p>Numerous national and local polls indicated that 60-81% of Americans support local police enforcing immigration laws.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our national network of activists have been working overtime trying to help the state of Arizona and the brave Arizonans who have passed this bill,&#8221; said William Gheen, President of Americans for Legal Immigration PAC. &#8220;Arizona no longer stands alone and we have now documented state lawmakers filing, or announcing they will file, versions of the Arizona bill in seventeen states! We will not stop until all states are protected from invasion as required by the US Constitution.&#8221;</p>
<p>ALIPAC has documented the following 17 states are following Arizona&rsquo;s lead in response to citizen pressure.</p>
<p>Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Utah</p>
<p>Americans for Legal Immigration PAC (ALIPAC) has helped to pass some form of immigration enforcement legislation in over 30 states, while the group has also gained a national reputation for defeating legislation designed to give licenses, in-state tuition, and other taxpayer benefits to illegal aliens in 20 states.</p>
<p>ALIPAC&rsquo;s President, William Gheen is a former campaign consultant, Legislative Assistant, state lobbyist, and Assistant Sgt-At-Arms staffer in North Carolina who has turned his local experiences into a political battle plan by driving the national operations of ALIPAC.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Federal government has been hijacked by special interests that are neglectful of their duties and even hostile towards the rightful citizens of America,&#8221; said William Gheen. &#8220;It is incumbent upon our states to protect American lives, property, jobs, wages, security, and health, when the Executive Branch fails to honor its Constitutional responsibility to do so by enforcing our existing border and immigration laws.&#8221;</p>
<p>Americans for Legal Immigration PAC lobbied state lawmakers and AZ Governor Jan Brewer to pass SB 1070, which strictly prohibits racial profiling while empowering local police officers to enforce immigration laws.</p>
<p>ALIPAC&rsquo;s activists have been working for almost four weeks now to encourage state lawmakers across the nation to file versions of SB 1070, to help alleviate boycotts and other political antagonism towards Arizona. Citizen activist are being asked to call, e-mail, visit, and fax their state lawmakers to encourage them to support existing SB 1070 type bills or to file them as soon as possible.</p>

		<p>The question is:  How long is it going to take for not only the 17 states to enact these laws, but all 50 states?  And what kind of effect will it have?  If it takes 20 years then we&rsquo;re going to have another 50 million illegal aliens here.  We also need laws to stem the tide of LEGAL immigration.  There are well over ONE BILLION PEOPLE IN INDIA, PAKISTAN, etc., immigrating here now and changing our country irrevocably.  How are we going to change that?  We have a monumental job on our hands.</p>

		<p> It&rsquo;s good to see that my home state of Indiana is one of the 17. Of course, the filing of bills doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that all of them will pass   &mdash;   or that some won&rsquo;t be vetoed by liberal governors.</p>
<p> Still, this &#8220;sends a message&#8221; to the boycotters who want to make the sovereign state of Arizona into a national pariah. There is strength in numbers; they can&rsquo;t boycott us all!</p>

		<p>This is good news. The more states that sign on to this the better, but the real question is what they will do after the Supreme Court declares that all these laws are unconstitutional, which is almost sure to happen. Our glorious leader has already announced that he wants to come up with an &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform package&#8221; and we can be confident that he will then try to ram it down our throats. Will Arizona and these other states defy the federal government? I&rsquo;d like to see it happen, but I&rsquo;ve got to admit that I&rsquo;m not real confident that it will. If it does, things could get real lively real fast, especially considering the financial collapse we&rsquo;re facing.</p>

		<p>If Americans were truly down and dirty on the illegal immigration issue, including just plain regular immigration, which is sky high to the point of being an abomination, they could stop both these policies dead in their tracks. Instead, so many stupid and clueless whites, continue to ignore immigration to the detriment of themeselves their friends and families. ONCE, AGAIN, STUPID IS AS STUPID DOES.</p>

<p>The question I ask here, is this enough land and good white people, to form a country?</p>
<p>Next question is this: what if the South, the bedrock of independence in this country, should join such movement en masse? Say the list begins to also read: Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, and (gasp) Florida, joining such  a movement? </p>
<p>What about: Alaska, Kansas, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Virginia, West Virginia, Louisiana, and the crown jewel here, Arizona?</p>
<p>Now we are talking about 34 states, or 68% by territory and population, of our country: ready, willing, and able to end Obamagrad DC&rsquo;s multicultural tyranny over us!</p>
<p>Now that is something to ponder and also to ask God, to help us make it be so!!!</p>

		<p> Best case scenario as I see it: <br/>
If you look at a US map you can see how bill passage in ID,NV &amp; UT w/ AZ leading would isolate pacific states and put more pressure on CA&rsquo;s  southern border shining a spotlight on the left&rsquo;s predatory agenda among other issues. With TX, OK, AR, MO &amp; NE joining, the mountain states are an isolated corridor w/ NM,  which has a hispanic majority, probably the only hold out. W/ MN  joining, IA, IL &amp; WS are cut off by IN. Big lib states IL &amp; WS would probably hold out ; I think IA will &#8220;see the lIght&#8221;.<br/>
MI, OH, PA &amp; NJ cut off  the northeast w/ libtard states NY, MA, CT &amp; VT holding out. I think the south will join except maybe LA &amp; FL ( also, of  DC, no idea on DE, VP Biden&rsquo;s state). With this scenerio, &#8220;the shoe will be on the other foot&#8221; and payback is that &#8216;naughty word&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Number 7 is right to blame apathetic whites who for whatever reason decide to ignore or downplay the very real peril massive Third-World immigration posses to their families and communities. And these clueless whites seem to make up a very large segment of the population, although it does seem like more and more of us are (finally) starting to come to our senses. Certainly the widely publicized controversy over Arizon&rsquo;s new law is helping open some eyes.<br/>
 <br/>
Here are the few basic things those of us who are not clueless on this matter need to fervently support: <br/>
1/ An end to birthright citizenship <br/>
2/ An indefinite moratorium on legal immigration<br/>
3/ Ending the tax-funded goodies these people are now gorging on<br/>
4/ Making E-verify mandatory for all employers<br/>
5/ Completing the border wall</p>

		<p>To pass such legislation in the State of Florida is an uphill battle.  What used to be the paradise of S FL is now just another banana republic. Less than 12% of Miami/Dade County is white Americans.  And how many of those conservative?  Less than 50% so that the population in S Fl will not allow this legislation.  Besides, the Republicans in the state, particularly S FL, still cling to the belief that hispanics are conservative and will vote Republican if only we allow them to basicly take over.  Wrong, it&rsquo;s been my experience of a lifetime spent in that area that latinos will do what they will and will dump the Republicans anytime that it suits them.  This includes many of the staunchest conservative Cubans, at least the newer generation.  It has become increasingly clear to me that whites need to either get tough, tougher than ever or die out as a race and witness a death of the Republic too.  Even a separate homeland is just a dream, one that will keep us safe only so long.</p>

		<p>Illegal immigration is becoming a problem here in Ohio.  I have a friend in Stark County (right next door to my county, Wayne) who says that around Canton there are lots of illegals.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s hope that very soon tens of states secede from the union, and form their own, all white country. I know that I would love to live in such an all white country, but would only expect to be allowed in if the existing population thought I was good enough, and going to be of benefit to the people who were kind enough to allow me to join them.</p>
<p>What a shame that the same sort of attitude isn&rsquo;t found in the vast majority of non-white immigrants&hellip;</p>
<p>We need to start arguing our position at every chance we get: why aren&rsquo;t white people allowed to have their own countries any more? Why do non-whites want to live around whites who don&rsquo;t want them around? Isn&rsquo;t the simple solution to allow all whites who wish to live among their own kind, to do so, and stop FORCING the majority of us to accept millions of third world immigrants?</p>
<p>Nobody can logically argue against any of that.</p>

		<p>This is nothing more than political grandstanding since the Arizona illegal immigration law is unlikely to survive court challenges to its central component; criminalization of an illegal immigrants presence in the state.</p>
<p>Kris Kobach is the law professor widely credited with being the intellectual force behind Arizona&rsquo;s illegal immigration law. In this CNN interview (@ 1:10) he says that an illegal immigrants  presence upon US soil (i.e. Arizona) is a civil, not criminal offense.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9jk7xbRuSk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9jk7xbRuSk</a></p>
<p>Thus, aside from questions concerning the &#8216;supremacy clause&rsquo; (i.e. only the federal government can regulate immigration), there is the question of how a state can criminalize an illegal immigrants presence upon its soil when in fact an illegal immigrants presence upon US soil, per federal law, is a civil offense.</p>
<p>Given the economic and political realities of Arizona, its possible the law gets by a federal judge in Arizona   &mdash;   however   &mdash;   will it stand up to challenges before the 9th district court of appeals   &mdash;   in San Francisco?</p>
<p>Will the Roberts court give its imprimatur a state law that criminalizes an illegal immigrants presence when federal law stipulates that it is a civil offense?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m glad my state, Ohio, is on the list. But, from what I hear though, Strickland has said he&rsquo;ll veto an Arizona-style bill if it reaches his desk.</p>
<p>Hopefully he&rsquo;ll be ousted this coming November. Kasich (in theory) should be more open towards such legislation. Also, because I haven&rsquo;t heard much about such bills in the Ohio State Congress, perhaps the congressmen are waiting for Kasich to be elected before putting anything up for a vote.</p>
<p>Does anyone know where I can find more info regarding the bill&rsquo;s status? The ALIPAC website just takes you to a state-specific forum which provides little to no info.</p>
<p><b>#15 Alexandra</b></p>
<p>Indeed, the illegals have certainly made their presence known here. Back in &#8216;06-&#8216;07 when we had those big winds come through, my father and I were comparing roof repair offers and it seemed that <i>not one</i> contractor in our area didn&rsquo;t use mestizo workers.</p>
<p>We had to settle for a contractor that said they used only legal workers. But when the only people on the job-site who can speak English are the boss (White man) and the supervisor (mestizo), well let&rsquo;s just say I had my doubts&hellip;which were only further confirmed when they did a slip-shot job cleaning up and took long breaks to boot.</p>
<p>I pray that Ohio&rsquo;s bill is not only passed and signed off, but is stricter than Arizona&rsquo;s.</p>

		<p>Texas is filing for legislation?<br/>
Not with any help from rick perry - he stated that &#8220;AZ&rsquo;s law is not right for Texas&#8221;<br/>
Thankfully, SOMEONE in texas government deems himself to be more responsible to the legal residents of TX than to the illegal ones.<br/>
Too bad there isn&rsquo;t a candidate for TX governor that I can support.</p>
