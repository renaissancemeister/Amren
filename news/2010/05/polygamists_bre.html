			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>New Zealand Herald (Nelson, New Zealand), May 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The burqa, or face-covering veil, is getting all the attention in the debate over Muslim immigrants in France. But another controversial tradition among some immigrants is less noticed and far more widespread: Polygamy.</p>
<p>The issue resurfaced last week after a woman received a traffic citation in the western city of Nantes for driving with a veil over her face. Officials then accused her husband of having at least three other wives, and said he may be profiting from them financially while the state pays the bill.</p>
<p>Polygamy is one of several issues, like forced marriage or genital mutilation, that France and other European nations face, as immigrants arrive with customs that conflict with the law of the land. But experts say polygamy in France can also be linked to fraud, where husbands hijack a generous social welfare system to line their pockets with state funds from each of their wives.</p>
<p>&#8220;They practice polygamy just for that,&#8221; said Jean-Marie Ballo, founder of an association that helps women escape from polygamous situations, Nouveaux Pas, or New Steps. &#8220;I&rsquo;d go so far as to say that polygamists here (in France) are breeding for cash.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ballo said he&rsquo;s even aware of cases where a legal wife&rsquo;s papers are used for hospital care for a second  &mdash;  a health risk as medical records intermingle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to count how many polygamous families live in France because of the secrecy of the practice. But the National Consultative Commission on Human Rights in a 2006 report made a minimal estimate of 16,000 to 20,000 polygamous families in France, or some 180,000 people, including children. That compares to fewer than 2,000 women who are thought to wear burqa-style garments.</p>
<p>For decades, polygamy was legal in France for immigrants arriving from any of about 50 countries where it is legally recognised. Historically, taking numerous wives was either a social and economic necessity in poor countries with high death rates, or a sign of external wealth or male domination.</p>
<p>France banned polygamy in 1993. At the same time, it launched a process of &#8220;decohabitation&#8221; to help multiple wives trapped in small apartments with numerous children to move into their own homes. Experts say that system has been largely successful.</p>
<p>But abuses thrive. Especially vulnerable are women who arrived in France after 1993  &mdash;  often here illegally and, therefore, with limited means to extricate themselves.</p>
<p>The state &#8220;minimally resolved the problem of polygamy but didn&rsquo;t provide the means to resolve it completely,&#8221; said Catherine Quentier of the association Rajfire, which helps women in distress negotiate French red tape to gain legal status or state-funded housing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to interview women who live in polygamy because associations say the current sensitive climate has aggravated their daily fears of being caught or their sense of shame. But the human rights report recounts a story that shows how multiple wives and children can lose their own identities.</p>
<p>A woman from Mali, where multiple wives are legal, arrived in France in 1981 at age 14 as wife No. 2  &mdash;  using the documents of wife No. 1, whom the husband sent back home.</p>
<p>The woman, identified as S.Y., had three children under her new identity but bolted when wife No. 3 arrived. She could not reconstitute her real identity for herself and her children.</p>
<p>When the report was written, S.Y. had lost her job, was living in a room provided by an association and could not access her bank account. Officially, she no longer existed, the report said.</p>
<p>Chantal Brunel, a lawmaker from the governing conservative UMP party, called last weekend for a region-by-region examination of the family subsidies program to stop corruption by men profiting from state aid to illegal wives. Brunel, who has written a book about violence against women, said she has polygamous families in her district east of Paris &#8220;and since 2004-2005 I have asked that the state stop closing its eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To have children cannot become like having a salary,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Other countries in Europe also struggle with polygamy. Fines and prison sentences, in some cases up to seven years, are the norm for those convicted of polygamy in Europe. An exception is Norway. In France, marriage to more than one person is punishable by a year in prison and a 45,000 (almost $60,000) fine.</p>
<p>However, the law is being challenged in Ireland. And in Cyprus, with a 5-year prison term, the court can take into account arguments that the accused&rsquo;s culture or religion permits polygamy.</p>
<p>Carina Hagg, a Swedish lawmaker for the opposition Social Democrats, warns against mixing notions of polygamy and culture.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to be careful not to make it an issue about ethnicity,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Fundamentally it&rsquo;s about women&rsquo;s rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those who deal with polygamy also note that in Europe, numerous children can be found living in small apartments with two sets of fighting mothers. They take turns using the kitchen, the bathroom and sharing sleeping space.</p>
<p>&#8220;Polygamy is not at all adapted to the context of life in the West,&#8221; said Ballo. &#8220;There are conflicts, catastrophic hygienic conditions. Kids do poorly in school as there is nowhere to study.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ballo, whose Malian father and grandfather were both polygamous, said he helped &#8220;decohabit&#8221; 12 households with 26 wives and 145 children in Les Ulis, south of Paris, where his group is based.</p>
<p>The human rights commission report notes that &#8220;there is, of course, no question of generalising and considering all polygamous men as executioners.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ballo is more cynical: &#8220;There are always people in life who defend hell.&#8221;<br>

		<p>It is easy enough to do this in the US.  Just don&rsquo;t officially marry the women.  They get welfare as single mothers, and if they don&rsquo;t name you as the father, you don&rsquo;t have to pay child support.</p>

		<p>&#8220;In Europe, you get one welfare check for each wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, and just look at how well Greece is doing.  The UK, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, are all set to combat riots in the street, since they&rsquo;re on the verge of bankruptcy right now just like Greece.</p>
<p>The socialist dream is the musings of a fool, and all of Europe will fall, including Germany.</p>
<p>The US will follow, oblivious to the fact it is heading toward the same system in Europe that is failing right before our eyes.</p>
<p>The result is this:  They imported huge numbers of contentious Muslim tribes and blacks as tax and consumer units, thinking that it would provide the necessary stimulus to keep their ill-conceived uptopia going.  Now they are going to wind up with a failed economy that will have dismantled all its perks, but the real tragedy is that all those warm bodies who always threaten to riot at the drop of a hat will have their social benefits cut off and the collapsed economy will not be able to provide them jobs.</p>
<p>Europe has just starkly realized what a horrendous blunder they have made, because it is highly unlikely they will get through this debacle without massive fighting in the streets, which could lead to all out civil war.</p>

		<p>It is not just happening in Europe but here in the USA. The FLDS church in Arizona and Utah makes a lot of money off of welfare benefits collected by plural wives for each child that they have. These wives are considered single mothers by the state.</p>

<p>145 children divided by 26 wives is nearly 6 children per wife.</p>

		<p>The reason the political will is not there to put a stop to polygamy in the West is because it does no harm to materialism.  </p>
<p>Materialism and consumption of goods and services means a growing economy - more expenditures on such things as diapers, food, gasoline, housing, hubcaps and furnishings. There is no possibility of the corporate establishment urging the government to bite the hand that feeds it.  </p>
<p>Immigrants and their children (illegal or not) are a godsend to the corporate elite.  Polygamy is insignificant on their radar.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if something came along that threatened commerce, the political class would find their backbone in a hurry, as errand boys protecting the interests of the financial elites.  </p>

		<p>Multiple wives in Europe, and a welfare check for each?  Fancy that!  In Australia they pay you a check for each child you have; you get your checks every single month!!!  Wonder if anyone is going to lobby for children&rsquo;s rights there?</p>

		<p>This article begs the question of why these polygamists are in Europe. If the native Europeans were even near sane, the polygamists would not be in Europe. European nations granted independence to  their colonies after WWII, but now are allowing themselves to be colonize. Not just allowing, but subsidizing! The lights are going out all over Europe.</p>

		<p>145 children divided by 26 wives is nearly 6 children per wife.</p>
<p>And I would be willing to bet, knowing the muslims as I do, that each wife is younger than 30 so she can pop out more yet!</p>

		<p>This is a pretty good example as to how almost all problems with non-whites can be traced directly back to welfare.</p>
<p>It really is quite simple.  We pay non-whites to breed while taxing whites so much we are too busy making money to have large families.  End welfare and you end the problem.</p>
<p>Actually, there are TWO sources that burden whites so much it discourages us from having children.  The first is welfare for non-whites.  But even more money is shipped out of the US in the form of foriegn aid and military adventurism.  We should slash about 1 trillion dollars a year in military spending immediately.  And we should cut nearly half that, over time, in welfare spending.  The money that frees up should go toward lowering taxes in all its forms (ie decreased cost of living, increased standard of living for whites).</p>
<p>Doing so would cause an explosion of white births.  The husband will easily support his large family again (as was the norm until very recently).  While the wife will be free to have many children, as is biologically normal for us.</p>
<p>The welfare/warfare state is what is destroying whites.  So it has to go.  Note that not one thing has to be said about the race issue in order to solve the race issue.</p>

		<p>I would point out that the U.S. is very much responsible for the muslim invasion of Europe. WE allowed the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Kosovo, allowing a long sought muslim foothold in Southern Europe and crushing the Serbs and disarming them, THEY who really know how muslims should be dealt with.</p>
