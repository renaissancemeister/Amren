			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Duncan Gardham and Gordon Rayner, London Telegraph, May 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A pair of suspected al-Qaeda terrorists who allegedly plotted to bomb a packed shopping centre cannot be deported to Pakistan because it would breach their human rights, a tribunal ruled.</p>
<p>Abid Naseer and Ahmad Faraz Khan won the right to stay in Britain even though the court accepted they were planning an &#8220;imminent&#8221; attack in Manchester when they were arrested last year.</p>
<p> A judge said he was &#8220;satisfied&#8221; that ringleader Naseer, in particular, &#8220;still poses a serious threat to the national security of the United Kingdom&#8221; but his hands were tied by human rights law because the two men might be tortured if they were sent home.</p>
<p>It means taxpayers will pick up a bill running into millions of pounds to keep the two men under control orders, even though the court stressed that deporting them would be &#8220;conducive to the public good&#8221;.</p>
<p>The head of the country&rsquo;s largest police organisation expressed &#8220;deep unease&#8221; at the situation, which revived debate on the European Convention on Human Rights, on which the men based their appeal against deportation.</p>
<p>Theresa May, the Home Secretary, said she was &#8220;disappointed&#8221; with the decision, but there was confusion last night about whether the coalition Government would repeal the relevant human rights laws. Francis Maude, the Paymaster General, initially said the Government had &#8220;no plans&#8221; to do so, but later ministers announced a commission to study the creation of a UK Bill of Rights which would give British courts supremacy over European legislation.</p>
<p>Andy Hayman, Scotland Yard&rsquo;s former head of anti-terrorism, said: &#8220;Our counter-terrorism legislation has been knocked into a cocked hat and we haven&rsquo;t got the measures that people need in this country to keep them safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Naseer, 24, and Khan, 26, were among 12 suspects arrested in Manchester, Liverpool and Lancashire last April following an intensive surveillance operation led by MI5.</p>
<p>The raids had to be urgently brought forward after the then Assistant Commissioner of Scotland Yard, Bob Quick, was photographed with details visible under his arm. Mr Quick subsequently resigned.</p>
<p>The men were never charged but the Home Office attempted to deport Naseer and Khan on national security grounds after eight other suspects chose to return to Pakistan.</p>
<p>Yesterday the Special Immigration and Appeals Commission (Siac) upheld appeals by Naseer and Khan against the attempt to deport them.</p>
<p>The commission panel, headed by Mr Justice Mitting, a High Court judge, said it was &#8220;satisfied that Naseer was an al-Qaeda operative who posed and still poses a serious threat to the national security of the United Kingdom.&#8221;</p>
<p>The panel was convinced that Naseer had sent &#8220;sinister&#8221; coded emails to an al-Qaeda contact which detailed his intention to carry out a &#8220;mass-casualty attack&#8221;. Naseer&rsquo;s claim that he was writing about girlfriends was &#8220;utterly implausible&#8221;, they said.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Siac said Pakistan had a &#8220;long and well-documented history of disappearances, illegal detention and torture&#8221; and its authorities had not given any assurances &#8220;against prohibited ill-treatment of any of the appellants&#8221;.</p>
<p>The panel said deporting them would breach Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which outlaws torture.</p>
<p>Paul McKeever, chairman of the Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers, said: &#8220;There is a deep sense of unease both within the police service and elsewhere that people are being allowed to stay in this country who are considered a very high risk. It is something the new Home Secretary has to address<br/>

<p>Forgive me, but these assholes deserve whatever Pakistani torture masters can throw at them. They are TERRORISTS, if I were the United Kingdom I would thrilled that there were a place I could send them where they would get what they really deserve, rather than a short prison sentence.</p>
<p>If someone tries to kill people because of their race or religion, then they effectively negate their civil rights.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s another option besides repatriation to home country -  they can be deported to a third country.  The Muslim world is very large, and the precedent has already been set with certain prisoners released from Gitmo. </p>
<p>Surely the Brits can call in a favor. </p>

		<p>&#8220;A pair of suspected al-Qaeda terrorists who allegedly plotted to bomb a packed shopping centre cannot be deported to Pakistan because it would breach their human rights, a tribunal ruled.&#8221;</p>
<p>Contrary to what Western governments want us to believe, these would-be terrorists are incredibly inept and stupid.  Any fool with half a brain that wanted to detonate his underwear or his auto in Times Square could do so with very little effort&hellip;.if he weren&rsquo;t a total bumbling imbecile.</p>
<p>While Western governments are patting themselves on the back for their &#8220;vigilance&#8221; in &#8220;preventing&#8221; terrorism, they&rsquo;re too imbecilic to understand that any trained terrorist, who isn&rsquo;t a total idiot, could cause ungodly damage to any country anywhere anytime he wanted to.</p>
<p>WHY? Because there is really no defense against terrorism.  Getting grandma and grandpa to take off their shoes at airports, and forcing citizens to prove they are who they are in order to renew their driver&rsquo;s licenses, in spite of being licensed for literally years, isn&rsquo;t anti terrorism strategies.  It is the work of mindless fools who are too stupid to be in any position of authority and deserve to be sweeping floors somewhere or working at the car wash, because the people who will do damage deftly work around such inane procedures with ease.</p>
<p>The only reason&hellip;.and I mean the ONLY REASON&hellip;there hasn&rsquo;t been a terrorist attack in this country is because no REAL terrorist has attempted anything.</p>
<p>A black who sets his underwear on fire is too stupid to blow anything up but himself.  That&rsquo;s hardly a trained terrorist attempt.</p>

		<p>The British regime&rsquo;s concern for &#8220;human rights&#8221; is so hypocritical that it&rsquo;s laughable. They could care less about the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p>Britain, like the United States, uses torture all the time. They torture prisoners in black prisons. They &#8220;rendition&#8221; prisoners, outsourcing their torture to other countries. The British use of torture goes way back.</p>
<p>In 2008, for instance, the Guardian published a story revealing that Britain had imprisoned and tortured Obama&rsquo;s grandather during the Mau Mau uprising in Kenya. </p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/5zuzlb" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/5zuzlb</a></p>
<p>More recently, the UN condemned Britain for &#8220;breaching basic human rights and &#8216;trying to conceal illegal acts&rsquo; in the fight against terrorism,&#8221; according to the Guardian. These illegal acts included the torture of terrorism suspects.</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/b4umd2" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/b4umd2</a></p>
<p>Now a British tribunal says it can&rsquo;t deport these terrorists to another country where they might be tortured. What nonsense. The tribunal is either completely out of touch with reality or they have some ulterior motive for keeping these guys in the country. Personally, I&rsquo;m just cynical enough to wonder if these &#8220;terrorists&#8221; might have been working for the British government all along. It wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time. One way or another, though, it&rsquo;s clear that Britain&rsquo;s concern for &#8220;human rights&#8221; is nothing but self-serving propaganda.</p>
