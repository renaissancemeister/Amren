<h1><a href="http://www.9news.com/news/article.aspx?storyid=139867&amp;catid=339">8 Arrested After Downtown Attacks Continue</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeffrey Wolf and Jace Larson, KUSA-TV (Denver), May 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Seemingly-random attacks in downtown Denver may not be over. 9Wants to Know has learned that the attacks on innocent bystanders have continued despite the arrest of 38 people late last year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Denver Police arrested eight people in a new round of arrests this month. Three went to jail on Wednesday in connection with last Friday&rsquo;s assault.</p>
<p>Five others have been charged or arrested for an attack on May 15 and another two attacks on May 8.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Investigators tell 9Wants to Know that gang members were randomly attacking white and Hispanic men.</p>
<p>Some of the people involved in the crime spree are thought to be involved in the murder of University of Colorado graduate student Andrew Graham in November. He rode the light rail home to Centennial and police believe gang members followed him for blocks before murdering him.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Anyone with information about any of the attacks is urged to call Denver Crime Stoppers at 720-913-STOP (7867). You can remain anonymous and could be eligible for a cash reward.<br>

		<p>The only hope of this nonsense getting resolved quickly is if it were white males committing these racial attacks.</p>
<p>Then the controlled media would be all over it&hellip;the politicians and race hustlers would be all over it&hellip;and you know the rest.    </p>

		<p>&#8220;One of the eight people arrested this month, Torrence McCall, turned himself into police last November for a robbery in LoDo and received probation. He was among the original 38 to face charges late last year. Police believe he may be connected to a May 8 assault at 16th and California Streets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Probabtion for robbery with a record like that.  How many people do we read of in our local papers who are given jail time for things as simple as traffic infractions, etc.?</p>
<p>This country deserves to crash.  I don&rsquo;t know which is worse, the judicial system or the other crooks that are on the street. </p>

		<p>Probation for an armed robbery, but in Colorado if you drive drunk with a blood-alcohol content of .17 or higher, you are looking at an almost mandatory 45 days in jail.</p>

		<p>Just another example of the incredible double standard that our media and government apply to Black-on-White crime compared to White-on-Black.  If there were attacks like this be conducted against Blacks in Denver, the government would have the National Guard in the city patrolling 24/7.</p>
<p>But when it comes to attacks on White folks, well obviously it&rsquo;s just good old fashioned random crime, no bias involved.  </p>
<p>And THAT&rsquo;S why huge numbers of White folks today are completely unaware of the relentless campaign of rape against White women that is carried out daily in the USA, averaging more than 100 victims per day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also why Whites are cheerfully oblivious to the fact that Black-on-White murder has claimed more lives since the enactment of the Civil Rights Act, than the total number of American deaths in the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>And saddest of all, it&rsquo;s why Whites continue to send their children to school with violent thugs who victimize them daily while their school administrators warble diversity mantras 24/7.</p>
<p>What does it take to make people start WAKING UP?</p>

		<p>Greetings everyone,</p>
<p>I live in Thornton, Colorado, which is 10 minutes from Downtown Denver, and has the same zip code as Denver, and can tell you this doesn&rsquo;t even scratch the surface of what&rsquo;s actually going on.  These attacks were going on for 8 months prior to the beating death of the young man at the light rail station.  The Chief of Police, The Mayor, the head of Public Safety, all knew about these attacks and yet none of them felt compelled to notify the public! Young couples were being attacked at bus stops, on the 16th St. Mall, and all over downtown Denver. And I&rsquo;m not talking about just a sucker-punch, but groups of 4 or more kicking the hell out of folk for no reason whatsoever.</p>
<p> I have my C&C; and do not go into Denver without being armed.  At one time I had to put my hand on my weapon and demand a group of Blacks and Mexicans back up or I would use deadly force.  They got the hell out of dodge real quick!</p>

		<p>    I believe the generic laws you see popping up now are intended to blur the cold hard facts that minorities are responsible for most violent crime . It allows the liberals to skew the statistics . That&rsquo;s why you see stiffer penalties for say, DUI(borderline DUI that is) or not wearing seatbelts or a myriad of other laws where an otherwise law abidng white can be charged for doing little or nothing . Plus, they can be selective about who they charge . My nephew got charged with a loud car stereo about three times and yet, my wife and I were in line at a drive-thru and the blacks behind us had their stereo so loud you could literally feel it in your stomach in a big way . And they just sat back there with impunity, no cop was going to mess with them . Plus, where I live most of the uniformed cops are black anyway . How many times have you heard someone like Cynthia Tucker or Leonard Pitts, or Les Payne say,&#8221; statistics show more whites than blacks are criminally involved one way or the other ?&#8221; I believe there is a conspiracy against whites and as time goes by it&rsquo;s going to become more apparent to even the most egalitarian of whites . Essentially that&rsquo;s what hate crime legislation is proving to be, right ? A 23 year old white kid throws a brick at rioting blacks in Cincinnati, or an 18 year old rides by protesters in Jena with a noose on his truck and they start talking hate crime charges . In a complete role reversal, Ken Tillery is murdered in Jasper in nearly the exact same manner James Byrd was but no hate crime charges for Ken&rsquo;s murderers . New Black Panthers descend on Jasper with assault rifles or intimidate white voters at polling places and not one thing is done about it . No, I believe there is a plan here to intentionally suppress or should I say oppress  whites .        </p>

		<p>They talk about how many arrests they make. What the media doesn&rsquo;t report is that these 40 people arrested, all of them are going to be back in the street in a night or two.</p>

		<p>I see that this article, though identifying the ethnicity of the victims, does not ID that of the perps.  For all anyone might guess, the attackers could be other Hispanics.  <br>
I think of Denver as a very liberal city, so maybe this is part of the problem.  Luckily, most mature people know to steer clear of groups of non-whites.  But too many young folks, schooled in the ghetto culture, just think thugs are cool and gravitate right toward them.  </p>

		<p>If they would just read the graffitti inked on these arrested losers bodies they would know who is committing these crimes. But alas that would profiling and they certainly wouldn&rsquo;t want to do that. Better if they just let it go unchecked, after all it&rsquo;s only a few evil white racists and who cares about them? Every time I see some loser, black or black wannabe with tats, or pierced jewelery I always want go up to them and kick them in the legs, since for ages past the bearers of such have either been homo&rsquo;s or pirates, and if they don&rsquo;t have a wooden leg well that solves that riddle. Sorry but that&rsquo;s just a logical observation. Of course they could just be wanting to emulate their black heroes, what with their pants below their crack, dragging the ground, and hats on sideways or bass ackwards. </p>

<p>&#8220;W. Seattle teen beaten bloody in possible hate crime&#8221;</p>
<p>The fate of white Americans.  Please note that the attackers were black and Oriental!  Yes, this is what Ted Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsberg, Bill Clinton, G.W. Bush, Nancy Polosi, etc. want for us.</p>
<p>The comments section under the article have comments blaming the boy for being out alone at 2:00AM.  While the parents should not have allowed it it is still no reason to blame the boy.  Like blaming a rape for victim for being raped because she was in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Another commenter compared this kid to Tawana Brawley!  Brawlay was a) not beaten to a pulp and b) had Rev Al to help exagerate her story, this kid was obviously attacked.  What is surprisong is that he wasn&rsquo;t killed.</p>
<p>Our future. ladies and gentlemen, our future.</p>
