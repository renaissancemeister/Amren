			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tracy Jan, Boston Globe, April 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It was a private dinner conversation among three friends. The topic: affirmative action and race. The debate presumably was passionate, given the divergent opinions of the Harvard Law School students.</p>
<p>Stephanie Grace, a third-year law student, felt she had not made her position clear, so she followed up via e-mail, according to a person with direct knowledge of events.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just hate leaving things where I feel I misstated my position,&#8221; Grace wrote. &#8220;I absolutely do not rule out the possibility that African-Americans are, on average, genetically predisposed to be less intelligent.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lengthy e-mail, sent to her two dinner companions six months ago, ignited an Internet firestorm this week when it was leaked and first reported Wednesday by the legal blog abovethelaw.com, followed by other websites.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Martha Minow, dean of Harvard Law School, condemned the e-mail that suggested blacks are genetically less intelligent than whites.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Minow said she had met with leaders of Harvard&rsquo;s Black Law Students Association on Wednesday to discuss the hurt caused by Grace&rsquo;s e-mail. She also said Internet reports alleging the association had made the e-mail public and pressed for the student&rsquo;s future employer to rescind a job offer were false.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Grace, an editor of the Harvard Law Review, is headed for a federal clerkship in California with Ninth Circuit Court Judge Alex Kozinski. She graduated from Princeton University in 2007 with the highest honors and obtained a degree in sociology, according to the university&rsquo;s registrar. A Princeton website said Grace conducted research on how the racial composition of one&rsquo;s freshman year roommates influences behaviors, attitudes, and perceptions in subsequent college years.</p>
<p>In her e-mail to her friends, she wrote that while she could &#8220;be convinced that by controlling for the right variables, we would see that [black people] are, in fact, as intelligent as white people under the same circumstances. The fact is, some things are genetic.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think it is that controversial of an opinion to say I think it is at least possible that African-Americans are less intelligent on a genetic level, and I didn&rsquo;t mean to shy away from that opinion at dinner,&#8221; she continued.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Grace sent an apology to leaders of the Black Law Students Association, the president of the student government, Minow, and several faculty members.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am deeply sorry for the pain caused by my e-mail. I never intended to cause any harm, and I am heartbroken and devastated by the harm that has ensued. I would give anything to take it back,&#8221; Grace said in the apology, obtained by the Globe.</p>
<p>&#8220;I emphatically do not believe that African-Americans are genetically inferior in any way. I understand why my words expressing even a doubt in that regard were and are offensive.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In her statement yesterday, Minow called the incident &#8220;sad and unfortunate&#8221; but said she was heartened by the student&rsquo;s apology. She added: &#8220;We seek to encourage freedom of expression, but freedom of speech should be accompanied by responsibility.&#8221;</p>

<p>I normally do not disagree with the posting/editorial staff here on the AR news board; however, this is going to be one of those times that I do, emphatically. We are asked to send &ldquo;a message of support&rdquo;  to Miss  Grace. I ask the question, why should we?</p>
<p>Miss Grace got it right and then, of course, the groveling begins; this is the worst mistake that can be made in my book, for now she is doomed. I am not unsympathetic to her plight, but I do question her commonsense and sanity on the topic of race now. It would have been to her benefit to stand firm and articulate her racial/genetic concerns, with both vigor and tenacity. Now she is backsliding, and allowing her attackers to see that they have drawn some blood. This will not allow for their mercy or even satiation, but only an acceleration of their need for a feeding frenzy at her expense.</p>
<p>Thus, I cannot send a &ldquo;a message of support&rdquo; to this foolish woman, for it is a waste of time. She has selected her own path toward self-immolation, and any words that I might offer her will do no good for either of us.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

<p>The first sentence, second quote is a near reversal of what she said earlier.  The second sentence, second quote, is perhaps a Freudian slip that reverses the reversal.</p>
<p>The reason that even expressing doubt about Black intelligence is a big deal is because everybody knows Blacks are less intelligent on average than every other racial group.</p>
<p>No one gets mad when you lie about them.  People can check on the lie and will quickly find out what the truth is.  They only get mad when you tell a hurtful truth about them.  People can check on the truth and quickly find evidence to confirm it.</p>

		<p>I can see why she did it(why lose out on potential job prospects because black people are offended), but I still love how her &#8220;apology&#8221; is worded.  She has twice the spine of any white politician in office.</p>
<p>To quote - &ldquo;I emphatically do not believe that African-Americans are genetically inferior in any way. I understand why my words expressing even a doubt in that regard were and are offensive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Notice she said genetically, not intellectually.  I myself don&rsquo;t believe blacks are genetically inferior, unless of course you consider having less intelligence to be a sign of genetic inferiority.  I do not.  Consider the following - </p>
<p>Black african people are instead much more suited to surviving in an african environment at a tribal level than say&hellip; mongoloid people.  Doing high level calculus or having a philosophical discussion on the definition of morality?  Not so much.  They aren&rsquo;t genetically inferior, they&rsquo;re simply not suited for life in a first world civilized white society.</p>

This is disgusting.  Even though she is the product of a marxist religious institution, she could not help but see what her intellect made her see.  Of course, the minute the natives got restless she was labeled a heretic.  I wonder if she really believes in her recantation, or was just frightened?  It is so easy to blame all this on the blacks, but they really are not, and have never been, in charge of the church of marx.  It is the construction of the White race. </p>

		<p>Really disgusting that the truth about black&rsquo;s average cognitive abilities (at least those indicated by IQ and academic aptitude)cannot be mentioned without all kinds of grief intentionally heaped on the teller. This fact I think is well known even to most blacks and pretty obvious but the subject is taboo for the vulnerable. It&rsquo;s actually important for this fact to be openly discussed because the implicit denial of it is at the bottom of many harmful discrimination lawsuits - like those against rigorous written tests for promotion in police and fire departments around the country on which a disproportional number of Africa Americans always do poorly.</p>
<p>Perhaps people should email references to Stephanie Grace on the subject just so she can quote the extensive research that backs up this persistent, world-wide IQ gap.</p>

		<p>Grace never should have bowed down to the &#8220;pressure groups&#8221;. </p>
<p>She should have realized that she was the victim of extortion  and used her connections and knowledge gained from law school to sued the school, the black students group, and anyone else who had threatened her future.</p>
<p>It would seem by her poor reaction and lack of recognizing blatently criminal activity that these are not the best law schools in our country after all.</p>

I do the same. We all know for sure, and history has proved it millions times by the facts known world-widely, that it is whites who are genetically inferior in any way.</p>
<p>Last year I was at a military camp and I had to share a government car with a black policeman. During those trips he told me about about the enormous contribution mercifully granted down to the humankind by black people. Any great name I had presented was, according to him, a black. So then I called several fictitious names. He without any hesitation immediately identified them as blacks as well. After I asked him if there had been a single great white man in the world history. He looked at me condescendingly and replied, &#8220;To tell you the truth, my friend, there has been no one.&#8221;</p>

		<p>There have been other times in history when this country has lived a lie, but at no time was it a lie as big as the one that DEMANDS that everybody play &#8220;Let&rsquo;s pretend blacks are as smart as everybody else.&#8221;  This one even has scientists fudging scientific results to conform to the party line as set forth by the multicult crowd who control our organs of communication, the universities, and the news and entertainment media, etc.</p>
<p>And it is the multicults who have the power and money and want to keep this lie going at all costs and are ready to destroy anybody who is so undiplomastic as to tell the truth.</p>
<p>And why?  Because if blacks aren&rsquo;t forced into as many segments of society as possible via AA preferences for schools, grading, certification, and jobs, they act as free radicals who turn to crime, as well as rioting from time to time.</p>
<p>And crime and rioting are two nasty occurrences that jeopardize the standing of the wealthy and powerful in this country.  Something like, &#8220;Oiling the squeaky wheel.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Well, Professor Minow  &mdash;  the most honest people who&rsquo;ve looked at this issue (let me recommend Arthur Jensen and Richard Lynn) have concluded that the most parsimonious explanation of the phenotypic black-white IQ gap is that the source is genetic. Now, be honest yourself Professor Minow, and admit that you don&rsquo;t know anything at all about this subject, and that you are simply spouting politically correct drivel.</p>

		<p>And so the ultimate conclusion of all such &#8220;controversies&#8221; has arrived, as predictably as the sunrise! And THIS is what we call &#8220;freedom!?&#8221; THIS is what we consider a country where free thought and speech are birthrights, unassailable and ordained from on high!? </p>
<p>The message here is as simple as it is clear - you WILL NOT break from the accepted(that is to say rigidly enforced)orthodoxy on race, or you will be destroyed!!</p>
<p>And this is the draconian madness perpetrated by the same people that call anyone with an opinion different from their own on racial matters a &#8220;Nazi&#8221; etc. The irony of it all is almost beyond human comprehension. </p>

		<p>Any physical anthropologist can tell the race of skeletal remains by bone structure. Yet, the dean of Harvard Law School thinks that there could not be any variation by race in the more than 100 genes that influence intelligence? Surely Minow&rsquo;s position stems from political fundamentalism and not by any kind of scientific observation or knowledge. The tragedy here is that Minow should support freedom of speech based on observation and reality, not on sensitivity. Lordy  &mdash;  this was even a private e-mail. Is Minow trying to run a mini-police state in her school? What kind of &#8220;responsibility&#8221; is there in masking one&rsquo;s knowledge or ideas just because someone, somewhere is going to be offended? Dean Minow and every law faculty member and student in the nation needs to study with heavy lenses Jonathan Rauch&rsquo;s brilliant defense of freedom of expression in his book, &#8220;Kindly Inquisitors: The New Attack on Free Thought.&#8221; Rauch clearly shows why attitudes such as Minow&rsquo;s are a danger to liberty and progress. Minow has no business being dean of any law school  &mdash;  even one that advertises on matchbook covers.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I emphatically do not believe that African-Americans are genetically inferior in any way. I understand why my words expressing even a doubt in that regard were and are offensive&#8221;</p>
<p>So here we have Ms. Grace recantating her position instead of having the courage to stand by her convictions. Absolutely sickening. She should have remained steadfast in her belief that there may be genetically influenced racial differences in average IQ rather than groveling to the intolerant enemies of free thought and honest scientific inquiry. Throughout history people have stood by deeply held beliefs even when threated with far worse things then her detractors could have ever inflicted on her. It&rsquo;s not as if she faced such horrors as the rack, disembowelment or burning at the stake if she didn&rsquo;t admit that the reining dogma on race and intelligence was unquestionably correct. Someday people may look back at the Dark Age we now find ourselves in and conclude that the people who stood their ground were heroic guardians of the truth. But unfortunately for Ms. Grace, she will not be one of those people.   </p>

<p>Hi there, me asian guy. <br/>
no offense but i think the cause is sensitization, happens all around you and starts at an early age. when a society fails to call a spade a spade and starting to use euphimism then it is sensitization at work. <br/>
Example : how many of you westerners todays, instead of using the correct word &#8216;fat&rsquo;, choose to use the word &#8216;heavy&rsquo; to describe a person that is fat? we asians still describe a fat person by the correct word - fat.  </p>

		<p>	One could argue the blacks have been afforded unreasonable accommodation; continuing to indulge the blacks with the false perception of intellectual equality has undoubtedly done them more harm than good.<br/>
	<br/>
Whites must edify the blacks by telling them the real reason for their disparity in achievement is due in part to their narrow minded; often short sided views which tend to marginalize them as a people… this coupled with an inability to take constructive criticism has impeded their progress in many areas… whites are far more analytically with greater intellectual capacity, giving them the edge… whites achieve at much higher levels than blacks; it&rsquo;s imperative to recognize these differences before the blacks can move ahead as a people.<br/>

		<p>Of course, absolutely, positively, Blacks are at least if not more intelligent than Whites. How can we forget those magnificent civilizations flowering up, down and across Sub-Saharan Africa. Peopled by kindly hardworking Blacks. Building paved roads, steam powered trains milleniums before English experimenters discovered the latent power of steam. Shining African towns and cities, their homes and markets lighted with electric lights   &mdash;   thanks to Black scientists learning how to produce and harness electrical energy. Vast libraries   &mdash;   those repositories and storehouses of knowledge, packed with volume after volume detailing the mountains of scientific and anatomic knowledge amassed by Black researchers. Blacks exploring the world around them with steam powered metal hulled ocean liners. Bearing the gift of enlightment and knowledge generously donated by the Black people to the four corners of the world.</p>
<p>All irretrievably lost when early European explorers started travelling throughout Africa. Appalled by the progress made by these kindly industrial Black people, those nasty European explorers burned and razed those cities. Torched those libraries and universities and destroyed all traces of that magnificent Black culture out of sheer jealousy and envy.</p>

All these race apologies amount to is someone saying, &#8220;I&rsquo;m sorry I said that&#8221; (read: told the awful truth).

		<p>Remember:  One of the &#8216;stars&rsquo; of the Harvard faculty was the foolish Gould, author of The Mismeasurement of Man, where he states emphatically and repeatedly that &#8216;Race is a Social Construct!&rsquo; and &#8216;Brain Size is Not Connected to Intelligence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He did this by personally attacking, smearing and debasing the scientists who proved that blacks have smaller brains than Whites.</p>
<p>Professor Lynn reports Gould, writing in The MM of Man:</p>
<p>&ldquo;..Morton, measuring by seed, picks up a threateningly large black skull, fills it lightly and gives it a few desultory shakes. Next, he takes a distressingly small Caucasian skull, shakes hard, and pushes mightily at the foramen magnum with his thumb. It is easily done, without conscious motivation; expectation is a powerful guide to action&rsquo; (p.97).</p>
<p>Professor Philippe Rushton has reported several data sets that confirm these results [the link between brain size and intelligence] and has recorded that he sent his papers describing these results to Gould. Gould did not reply, but must have concluded that the evidence was so strong he could no longer dispute it. Instead of writing a correction, he simply removed all references to brain size from the second edition&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Mendacious theories in The Mismanagement of Man became THE prevailing wisdom in academia,  disseminated via its use as THE only anthropology and biology text  &mdash;  replacing Darwin&rsquo;.</p>
<p>To dispute Gould&rsquo;s theories is heresy.</p>
<p>And finally:   The Dean of Harvard Law School added: &ldquo;We seek to encourage freedom of expression, but freedom of speech should be accompanied by responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, and she, as the Dean of Harvard Law, will determine what constitutes &#8216;Responsible Free Speech.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I expect her to announce shortly that she will present legislation to the courts that deems anyone giving voice to or writing that &#8216;blacks are less intelligent than Whites&rsquo; will find themselves federally charged with Hate Speech Laws punishable by hard prison time.</p>
<p>Orwell was right, of course.</p>

		<p>Dean Minow no doubt considers herself to be a feminist,  someone concerned with the welfare of women.   I wonder if she&rsquo;s ever said a word about the 35,000 white women subjected to racist mass-rape in America each year, many of which must be motivated or aggravated by racial animus,  or does she put those rapes on a scale - on one side the victims and on the other side her desire to be a member in good standing in progressivism,  to keep that coalition together by ignoring  the vicious racial practices of some of its members.   Certainly her views on free speech and privacy, not to mention black intelligence,  have been put on that scale.   </p>
<p>It never ceases to amaze me how the victims of liberal genocidal racism (that is, all white people) routinely allow people (the liberal/non-white/Democrat coalition) who&rsquo;s main goal in life is to stuff them into an oven, figuratively speaking, lecture them on anything, much less race.   This is a controversy only because the left has totalitarian control over the media.   In Minnesota a black man has just murdered three whites without the media expressing the least interest in the possibility of racism being a factor.   Guess which story gets wider play.</p>

		<p>I agree with #6 Sissy White. NEVER GROVEL. That just gives them more rope to hang you with. If one has made a factual error then simply correct the statement in a matter of fact way. It may be tempting to duck and run for cover. But a groveling apology just encourages parasites to sink their teeth in deeper. One is better off standing firm. I&rsquo;m not saying to escalate the situation. Rather, one should simply stand one&rsquo;s ground by saying something like this:</p>
<p><br/>
<i>&#8220;The opinion was based on mainstream sources. And it&rsquo;s fine if others disagree. But one should base their arguments on evidence rather than personal attacks.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>And if, by chance, one did overreach and say something unacceptable I would recommend saying something like this:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;I regret the unfortunate choice of words and will make it a point to be more sensitive in the future.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>And, then, just let it go. Once you&rsquo;ve given a closing remark like that then there really isn&rsquo;t much for them to do besides whine and bitch and look foolish.</p>

		<p>This lady has no business ever practicing law.  She said what she believes at first, which is substantiated by much evidence, and then reverses herself becaue of the dean who does not believe in free speech.  Lawyers take enugh abuse for not being on the up-and-up.  The profession does not need people who are so weak-kneded that they will say anything to get by. </p>
<p>If the dean did release the e-mail to the press, who did?</p>

		<p>In biology, function is almost always related to morphology:<br/>
Longer legs = faster runners<br/>
Bigger stomach = larger meals<br/>
Larger muscles = greater strength<br/>
Larger lungs = greater ventilatory capacity</p>
<p>But, according to the geniuses at Harvard, larger brains have nothing to do with intelligence, and by some amazing quirk of evolution, all races have exactly the same IQ.</p>

<p>There wouldn&rsquo;t be any problem if she hadn&rsquo;t made it into one. It would pay to do some reading up on this woman. </p>
<p>Ideologists like her are the ones who have taken over control of our once-great institutions like Harvard and made them into training centers for radical Marxists.  They are the mysterious  &#8220;hostile elites&#8221; behind the scenes that people complain about.</p>

<p>Surely, you must  know  that  cranial  capacity is  not  related to  intelligence.  If  so,  then women are  doomed  to  be  less  intelligent  than men  and  that  the  Neanderthals  were  more  intelligent  than  homo sapiens  because  their  brains  were bigger.</p>

		<p>Perhaps we may be a little too rough on Stephanie.  There are not many Whites that would display their true feelings about race coupled with their name and address.  The price is so high because many of us cannot afford to lose our jobs or become embroiled in litigation.  Let&rsquo;s face it, most good professions are in a environment of such political sensitivity, that even a suspicion of say, not believing diversity is our strength, could be a career killer.</p>
<p>Think about it.  When you are reading blogs and someone makes a disparaging remark about blacks.  A lot of the responses to the &#8216;racist&rsquo; blogger is, &#8220;Why don&rsquo;t you say that to the nearest black or are you a coward hiding behind the keyboard?&#8221;  Most real concerns are not the one on one physical confrontation, it&rsquo;s the lawsuits and job loss that are the real concerns.  Not to mention the all too real fear of loss of life by some armed thug(s) under the cover of darkess.</p>
<p>The average White cannot afford to reveal his/her hand without the potential for financial ruin or seeing themselves or a loved one hurt.  This is why people of Jared Taylor&rsquo;s caliber are so rare and valuable.  Of all the gifts Mr. Taylor has demonstrated over the years; I would have to say that I admire his courageous spirit above all else.  Of course, the time is coming that will force many of us to make the choice.  While I personally would not volunteer my real feelings in the work environment, I would however, admit to all the blogs that I have written if confronted with them.  As time progesses and things get worse (and they will), I may proceed to the next step and write on the causes of destruction of the Western World with name and address in tact.</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s on fire and I have but one question, &#8220;If it&rsquo;s true, is it still racist?&#8221;</p>

		<p>62 OCCAM: I am smarter than most elephants, yet my cranium is smaller than theirs.  That&rsquo;s because the statistical relationship between cranial capacity and intelligence is not direct, but is adjusted for body size.  Much of the brain has nothing to do with thinking, but with controlling the body and its many functions.  Women are smaller than men, and so have smaller heads as well.    </p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;Surely, you must know that cranial capacity is not related to intelligence&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Nonsense. </p>
<p>Professor Rushton writes in Race Evolution and Behavior:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;My article with C. D. Ankney &#8216;Brain Size and Cognitive Ability&rsquo;&hellip;surveyed all the published research on this topic. It included studies that used the state-of-the-art technique known as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) which gives a very <br/>
good image of the human brain. The overall correlation between IQ and brain size measured by MRI is 0.44. This is much higher than the 0.20 correlation found in earlier research using simple head size measures (though 0.20 is still <br/>
significant). </p>
<p>Studies of race differences in brain size use a number of methods, including MRI. All methods produce the same results. Orientals have the largest brains (on average), Blacks the smallest, and Whites in between. These differences in brain size are not due to body size. Adjusting for body size still results in the same pattern. The three-way pattern is also true for IQ. These race differences in brain size mean that Orientals average about 102 million more brain cells than Whites, and that Whites have about 480 million more than Blacks. These differences in brain size probably explain the racial differences in IQ and cultural achievement&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/237aqt3" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/237aqt3</a></p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;If so, then women are doomed to be less intelligent than men&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>That women have smaller brains than men is not in dispute.  Also not in dispute is that women are vastly under-represented in such nebulous, super-high IQ areas such as theoretical physics, chess grandmasters, Fields medallists for mathematics and Nobel Prize winners </p>
<p>Professor Lynn, emeritus professor of psychology at Ulster University,</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; believes that the differences between the sexes make men better suited to &#8216;tasks of high complexity&rsquo; than their female counterparts&hellip; he has concluded that there is a very strong case that men not only have larger brains, but have a higher IQ, by about five points, compared with women.</p>
<p>He said that the difference meant there was a much higher proportion of men with higher IQs, with three men to each woman with an IQ above 130 and 5.5 men for each woman with an IQ above 145&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>Correct. I absolutely agree. She did not place it in an ad in the campus newspaper or post it on the school&rsquo;s bulletin board.  If it was brought to public attention by a back-stabbling &#8220;friend&#8221;, then that action was reprehensible and THAT person should be the one receiving the reprimand.  Dean Minow should also be reprimanded for interferring in a personal matter and violating a student&rsquo;s privacy. </p>
<p>In short, all of the WRONG people are being punished here.</p>
<p>She should have declined to discuss it, maintaining that her e-mails  (and her private thoughts) are nobody&rsquo;s business but her own.</p>

<p>You  claim  about  cranial  capacity  and  &#8220;intelligence&#8221;  is  just  bogus.  You say  that  &#8220;Orientals&#8221;  have  the  largest  brains  and  that  therefore  they  have  the  highest  intelligence.  </p>
<p>based  on  a  quick  calculation  it  would seem  that  the  overall  IQ of  Orientals[not  to  mention  that  the  average  other-Asian  score  is  about  80 points] would  be  just  over  90.</p>
<p>Consider  the  following scores:  China(100  &mdash;  other results  put  that score  at  95), Burma(86), Thailand(91), Malayasia(92), Indonesia(89), Philippines(86), Laos(89), Vietnam(96), etc.  Only  Japan(105) and  Taiwan(104)  make  it  over  100.</p>
<p>Taking  population sizes  into  consideration  it  would seem  that  the average  &#8220;Oriental&#8221;   score would  be  approximately between  90 and  95.  Flynn and  Dickens(2006)  showed  that  the  average U.S. black  IQ  is  approx. 90 registering  gains  of  some  5  points  in recent  times(post desegregation  era).</p>
<p>So  much for  your  phrenological brain-IQ  hypothesis  &mdash;  courtesy intellectual  alchemists  like  Rushton,  Lynn, et al.</p>

<p>That is because there is a distinct genetic difference between East Asians (Chinese, Japanese and Koreans) and South Asians (South Asia typically consists of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Some definitions may also include Afghanistan, Burma, Tibet, and the British Indian Ocean Territories):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Classical anthropology often placed South Asians  and North Africans in the same taxonomic group as Europeans and designated them both as Caucasoids. But modern genetic studies, such as those by L. L. Cavalli-Sforza, show the South Asians/North Africans are a surprisingly distinct &#8216;genetic cluster.&rsquo; They can be distinguished from Europeans to their north as well as from sub-Saharan Africans to their south and the other Asian groups to their east.</p>
<p>The evidence that the average IQ of the North Africans/South Asians is as low as 85 is extensive&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>Hope that answers your query.  But I don&rsquo;t expect you to believe Professors Rushton, Lynn or Jensen or read any of the links on their research I&rsquo;ve posted as you dismiss their thorough, meticulous research as &#8216;intellectual alchemy.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Do you work for the media, academia, the government or consider yourself a part of the intelligentsia?  You seem to share the same dismissive attitude when presented with hard evidence including decades of research, MRI scans, refereed articles, massive numbers of citations and cross-references from non-statist academics who have spent their professional lives studying IQs and IQ differentials to refute the drivel you&rsquo;re trying to pass off as &#8216;facts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As for the discredited Flynn: </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Rushton showed that the Flynn Effect is not on the g factor, although that is the principal source of the Black-White difference (g is the general factor of mental ability, which is the &ldquo;active ingredient&rdquo; in IQ&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Even Flynn has backpedaled:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;According to Flynn, massive IQ increases are not seen in all types of cognitive functioning, just in a couple of areas, which explains why kids these days don&rsquo;t seem all that much smarter, except at programming their new gadgets&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/2datfxb</p>
<p>Dismiss away  &mdash;  you&rsquo;ll find very few here who believe yours or Gould&rsquo;s theories that &#8216;Race is a Social Construct!&rsquo; or &#8216;There are no Differences in IQ Between the Races!&rsquo;  &mdash;  but in your favor, you do have the backing and full support of the media, government, academia and intelligentsia to convince people that The Emperor Has no Clothes.</p>
<p>Best of Luck to you!</p>
<p>This is my final post on this matter as I find trying to convince those who casually dismiss hard facts and massive empirical evidence as very tiring.</p>
