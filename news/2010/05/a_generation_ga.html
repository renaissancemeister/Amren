<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/37204406/ns/us_news-the_new_york_times/">A Generation Gap Over Immigration</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Damien Cave, MSNBC, May 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Forget sex, drugs and rock &#8216;n&rsquo; roll; immigration is a new generational fault line.</p>
<p>In the wake of the new Arizona law allowing the police to detain people they suspect of entering the country illegally, young people are largely displaying vehement opposition &hellip; .</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meanwhile, baby boomers, despite a youth of &#8220;live and let live,&#8221; are siding with older Americans and supporting the Arizona law. </p>
<p>This emerging divide has appeared in a handful of surveys taken since the measure was signed into law, including a New York Times/CBS News poll this month that found that Americans 45 and older were more likely than the young to say the Arizona law was &#8220;about right&#8221; (as opposed to &#8220;going too far&#8221; or &#8220;not far enough&#8221;). Boomers were also more likely to say that &#8220;no newcomers&#8221; should be allowed to enter the country while more young people favored a &#8220;welcome all&#8221; approach. </p>

<p>The brain-washing is working.  I&rsquo;m still pretty surprised though considering White kids these days are the minority in schools all over the country (and even in a growing number of colleges such as UCLA). <br>
They bear the brunt of this &#8220;welcome all&#8221; approach yet happily embrace it&hellip;    </p>

		<p>I wonder if these young people enjoy having electricity, water, cars, television etc. you know, all the hallmarks of a stable white civilization.  If they don&rsquo;t care for these then I&rsquo;m sure they would love to live in the lands where these immigrants come from and where they are trying to emulate here in America.  </p>

		<p>These foolish young people are the equivalent of the idiotic youth protesters of the 1960&rsquo;s and &#8216;70&rsquo;s if this is true.  Somehow I suspect that even if it weren&rsquo;t, the media would attempt to portray today&rsquo;s youth this way, to make other youth think that it&rsquo;s &#8220;cool&#8221; to want your country invaded by people who want to destroy you.</p>

		<p>I very much doubt the young people who&rsquo;ve been unable to find work are as enthusiastic.  There was once a time when a young man fresh out of high school - or even a dropout - could make a nice living in the construction industry.  No more.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t blame the kids.</p>
<p>The messages they get from advertising, news, and entertainment is that they can have anything they want, without limitations. </p>
<p>This is a hedonistic and nihilistic environment, where the individual is encouraged to be the center of his own pleasure-seeking attention.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re not conversant with material scarcities, economic necessities, or fiscal insecurities, you want &#8216;everyone&rsquo; to enjoy the same limitless possibilities.  </p>

		<p>I would say this divide shows a normal response to the question of immigration.  Older folks, knowing what it takes to maintain a mostly civil and just society, as well as knowing what it takes to earn and maintain the wealth of a nation, generally have no great desire to give it away to everyone else on the planet.  We understand that all aspects of our society need to be protected. Whereas the young, and most of this current generation moreso than any other in the past, have lived a life of wealth, ease and privilege, without having had to work for it. The result is their general lack of understanding of the value of what they have, and as such, they are more likely to see no problem in giving it away. I believe bringing an end to liberalism would go a long way in the proper education of our young.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a small business owner in his early 50s, in a big city, who employs P/T four white male workers in their mid 20s. Two college educated, two not. All bright enough young fellows. And all of them pretty well indoctrinated in white guilt, radical egalitarianism, and a general suspicion about capitalism. </p>
<p>In short, typical specimens from our modern schools. The <i>Frankfurter</i> School, that is. </p>
<p>When dealing with them, I try to keep reminding myself that young people like them never knew anything before Political Correctness. In their schooling they&rsquo;ve never been taught anything but this. And never heard any racial awareness from their hippie or semi-hippie parents either. This makes it VERY hard for oldsters like me to deprogram them. Because as it is, these kids   &mdash;   like the ones in this article   &mdash;   are going to need to attend some kind of caucasian re-education camp to get their heads straight about this stuff. </p>
<p>Either that or find themselves, a few decades hence, surrounded and suffocated by the unassimilable nonwhites they currently   &mdash;   in their youthful idealism and dangerous naivete   &mdash;   want to keep bringing in. </p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t even live to see the very worst of the Third World invasion of the First World. But these kids will. And when they do, they&rsquo;ll wish they listened to &#8220;bigoted&#8221; oldsters like us. </p>

		<p>I guess when you figure in that there are more minorities in the younger age brackets than there are in the 45 or older group that it would be seen as a generational gap.  This is just propaganda with the intended message that immigration is inevitable and that old dying Whites are fighting a losing cause.  They tried the same tactic with gay marriage.  </p>

		<p>Remember that the percentage of whites in the under 18 demographic is noticeably smaller than the entire age range. So, how many of these youths are actually white? Not the overall 65%, that&rsquo;s for sure. It&rsquo;s probably somewhere around 50% or even lower, which means that it&rsquo;s probably far less white youths that support mass immigration than MSNBC makes it out to be.</p>
<p>And the vehement opposition most likely stems from hearsay, rumor, or second-hand information. How many young people do you know that vehemently oppose the Arizona bill have actually stopped to take the time to read it? No, they&rsquo;re too busy with the brain dead pop culture they currently embrace (apparently it&rsquo;s some 16-year-old kid in the news right now), with an obligatory regard for the multicultural mantra. It&rsquo;s the only thing that they can seem to latch onto to make their lives appear to be meaningful and humanistic (for them) instead of being constantly filled with manufactured entertainment.</p>
<p>Most of these youths do not have to worry about holding jobs because they&rsquo;ll be able to leech off of their parents for several years after graduation, all the while touting immigration and diversity. They are indoctrinated and intimidated into accepting it. Being more &#8220;open&#8221; is more like an act of submission.</p>

		<p>Be careful with these generation gap stories. I can remember my grandmother,in about 1966, saying that she didn&rsquo;t think that young people minded immigrants as much as her generation did (she was born in 1895). Yet it seems that it is now those very same &#8220;young people&#8221; - now, like me, in their fifties and sixties - who are more opposed to immigration than the OLDER generation, as well as the younger. How odd, I&rsquo;ve no idea why that should be.</p>
<p>As for why the younger generation should be less opposed to immigration, we have to take into account three things:- 1/ the incessant propaganda of the last fifty years 2/ that it is not &#8220;cool&#8221; to openly admit unfashionable views (they get over it)3/ that whites make up a much smaller proportion of that youngest age group. </p>
<p>You can certain beyond a peradventure that the proportion of anti-immigrationists among young whites will be significantly higher than that already respectable 24%, and much closer to that of their elders. </p>

		<p>I haven&rsquo;t noticed this trend in the real world, however. Most of my schoolmates who I talk to about immigration seem to be pretty much against illegal immigrants, and against things like making Spanish an official language. Of course, one must take into account the fatc that there are few Hispanics in the older category, whereas there are tons of Hispanics in the younger category. And Hispanics are, of course, predisposed to be in favor of more immigration.</p>

		<p>To be fair, the younger generations are much more non-white than the older generations today in the US, so my guess is that has something to do with it; plus, youth in general usually tend to favor leftist policies regardless of where the rest of society stands.</p>
<p>Believe me, I deal with this reality (my peers) all the time &hellip; no wonder I don&rsquo;t have too many friends: respect must be an important factor in maintaining successful relationships.</p>

		<p>Where was this poll conducted?  All the young white people I hang out with in the 19-25ish age range are against illegal immigration(I have one black &#8220;friend&#8221; who also happens to be an albino, and he is more against it than any of my white friends).</p>
<p>Was it a web poll?  Because that would definitely explain it.</p>

		<p>Most or all of the difference is probably due to the larger numbers of non-whites among younger people.  Remember that younger people have grown up in an environment where anti-white attitudes have been promoted by ALL important institutions in society, including supposedly &#8220;conservative&#8221; ones like evangelical churches, the military, the &#8220;business community&#8221; and the GOP.  </p>

		<p>I think the numbers definitely lean strongly to the left but it&rsquo;s far from a complete whitewash. Also a lot of these people have views they haven&rsquo;t formed themselves but rather have been indocrinated with and simply regurgitate, but where their gut instinct tells them otherwise. I think these folks in particular are the sort of people who change their views in their 30s and 40s.</p>
<p>As a 20-something I think it is often a bit difficult to espouse your views in various social settings without getting jumped, and I would probably never let my workmates know the full extent of my views as I prefer to keep that a friendly environment I don&rsquo;t regret or hesitate being in. Having a group of like-minded friends as an outlet helps to no end. </p>

		<p>A few years back, I used to work with some college boys. They both mouthed PC  and made what most blacks would consider &#8216;racist&rsquo; remarks regarding black behavior.</p>
<p>What I found interesting was how they separated the two. I would call them on their &#8216;racist&rsquo; comments and they would say, &#8216;it&rsquo;s not racist, it&rsquo;s true&rsquo;. But when I made a comment about black crime, they would tell me, &#8216;that&rsquo;s not cool. You can&rsquo;t make &#8216;racist&rsquo; comments&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great example of cognitive dissonance; the ability to hold to opposite opinions but to reconcile them.</p>
<p>On one hand, these collage age boys were committed to every PC notion about races but on the other, blacks would define them as racists.</p>

<p>  Unfortunately, many of today&rsquo;s college youth come from brain-washed, politically correct, minority sport worshipping, ex-hippie parents. These kids don&rsquo;t question conventional authority and seem strangely passive. I think the Internet and computer games have had a negative impact on their intellectual development.

		<p>Part of the problem is that too many young people see third worlders through the prism of the university. They assume the more or less well behaved third world students they interact with on campus   &mdash;   many of whom are smart enough to mouth the correct liberal slogans   &mdash;   are the norm. To these young people, the third world mass migration into the first does indeed bring in that &#8220;vibrancy&#8221; which they believe will enrich their lives.</p>
<p>Of course, they are not seeing the downside. At least not the university educated sector of young people who live in the antiseptic world of the campus and mass media. </p>
<p>But I know too many Americans (including legal immigrants) who complain bitterly about losing jobs which are undercut by illegal aliens. I&rsquo;ve observed the overloading of much of America&rsquo;s infrastructure by the expanding underclass of illegal aliens, as well as from the collapsing inner cities. And the transformation of politics as increasing numbers of non-citizens make their weight felt. The fact that much of the ruling elite in the USA has sided <i>against</i>  Arizona in the recent ruckus over its immigration law is one indicator of this. </p>
<p>Perhaps younger Americans do not see all this. The growing dysfunction is not within their field of vision. One wonders when they will receive the rude awakening into reality. </p>
