<h1>Former Jena 6 Defendant Faces Charge of Battering</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bret H. McCormick, News-Star (Monroe, Louisiana), May 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Former &#8220;Jena Six&#8221; defendant Mychal Bell is in trouble with the law once again.</p>
<p>Bell was arrested on Saturday and charged with simple battery after a fight at Brown&rsquo;s Barber Shop on Park Street in Jena.</p>
<p>LaSalle Parish Sheriff&rsquo;s Office deputies responded to a call about the fight, and Bell admitted to getting into a fight, although he called the incident &#8220;a big misunderstanding,&#8221; according to a report by Lacie Terral, deputy sheriff for criminal records.</p>
<p>&#8220;While being booked and after being read his Miranda rights, Mychal stated to deputies that he had hit the victim in the face and grabbed him in a headlock and slammed his head on a table as they were falling to the floor,&#8221; Terral wrote in a press release. &#8220;When asked why he did this, Bell stated because (the victim) was running his mouth about him.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The arrest is just the latest in a long string of run-ins with the law for Bell, who was at the heart of the Jena Six case, which drew national headlines because of the justice system&rsquo;s handling of an incident in which six black Jena High School students beat up a white student on Dec. 4, 2006.</p>
<p>The Jena Six defendants originally were charged with attempted second-degree murder and conspiracy to commit second-degree murder. Those charges were later reduced. Bell was tried and convicted of second-degree battery as an adult.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} He returned to the spotlight in December 2008 when he was arrested on charges of shoplifting, resisting arrest and simple battery in an incident at the Pecanland Mall in Monroe. Hours later, Bell shot himself in the chest in what he later said was a suicide attempt.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bell recently completed his first year of college at Southern University in Baton Rouge, where he was considering playing football for the Jaguars next year.<br/>

		<p>let&rsquo;s not be too harsh on the young man, anyday now he is going to start to think about beginning to try and turn his life around, and if it takes a few more people to be victimized in the process, it a small price to pay,  and besides he&rsquo;s a good boy.  </p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;He served time in prison before an appeals court overturned the conviction in September 2007 and ruled that Bell should have been tried as a juvenile.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lately the Government judges and politicians have been taking measures to ensure their own safety. It appears the fruits of their labors are becoming manifest. It&rsquo;s too bad they are not just as concerned for the safety of the rest of us.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed how black criminals use tall-tale scenerios to try to mitigate their actions.  Note how Bell says the attackee slammed his head on a table &#8220;as they were falling to the floor&#8221;.  A frequent statement is &#8220;He got shot&#8221; rather than &#8220;I shot him&#8221;.  One said he pointed a gun and closed his eyes, and, when he opened them, the victim was lying on the floor!  One lowlife kidnapped a woman and raped and murdered her.  He told cops various versions, then on the stand claimed she killed herself out of jealousy of his girlfriend, stabbing herself in the chest nine times!!</p>

Skip</p>
<p>  Unfortunately, many State Universities have dumbed-down their admissions in their eternal quest for &#8220;diversity&#8221; and increased enrollment. Today, you see more unqualified black students on campus, and students like Mychal Bell are not all that uncommon.<br/>
Most flunk out after a couple of semesters. Parents should be aware of this trend and act accordingly. </p>

		<p>I suspect that Mychal (sic) Bell got into this university because there are people who desperately wanted to prove that any &#8216;troubled&rsquo; and &#8216;ask risk&rsquo; black male could be redeemed. Hence, university administrators were treated to special meetings with Bells&rsquo; supporters who assured the university that Mychal (sic) would be given extra attention and extra help. His supporters wanted to make Bell an example of how every &#8216;troubled&rsquo; black male could be saved by giving them extra help and tender loving care.</p>
<p>Of course, this is all hope, theory, and fantasy. Mychal (sic) Bell is what Tupak refereed to as a &#8216;thug4life&rsquo;.<br/>

		<p>Bell told the police &#8220;it was a big misunderstanding&#8221; and no doubt it was true. Bell wasn&rsquo;t getting his way and didn&rsquo;t understand why, so he reverted to violence to get what he wanted. Bell has a record of many such misunderstandings which resulted in his harming someone.</p>

<p>Yes, but didn&rsquo;t most of us plainly see the truth right from the beginning? It&rsquo;s just that the race hucksters who dominate the country were manipulating the entire incident in hopes of planting the usual racial narrative in the minds of millions of Americans. </p>
