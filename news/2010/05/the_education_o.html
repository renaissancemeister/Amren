<h1>The Education of Stephanie Grace</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reid Johnson, <font color="red">Special to AR News,</font> May 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Life has not been easy for dissidents from blank-slate orthodoxy at Harvard. In 2005, then Harvard President Larry Summers made the mistake of suggesting that biological reasons may explain why women do not excel at science. The faculty gave him a no-confidence vote and he resigned.</p>
<p>Harvard has been closed-minded  for decades. In 1971, long before he touched on race, Richard Herrnstein published an article in <cite>Atlantic Monthly</cite> entitled &#8220;IQ,&#8221; arguing that the concept was meaningful and intelligence was heritable. Leftists leafleted the campus with flyers that said &#8220;Fight Harvard Prof&rsquo;s Fascist Lies,&#8221; and plastered Harvard Square with his picture and the caption, &#8220;Wanted for Racism.&#8221; He received death threats and had to cancel lectures.</p>
<p>Professor E.O. Wilson faced similar attacks after he published his seminal book, <cite>Sociobiology.</cite> His colleagues Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin&rsquo;s &#8220;Science for the People&#8221; held teach-ins, and radicals crashed his lectures. In 1978, a leftist poured a pitcher of water over him and yelled &#8220;Wilson, you&rsquo;re all wet&#8221; when he gave a talk at the American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p>
<p>Now, the same anti-science, anti-free speech fanatics have a new target: Harvard Law student Stephanie Grace. Miss Grace is the classic overachieving law student. She graduated with honors from Princeton and went straight to Harvard Law, where she made Law Review. When she graduates at the end of this month, she is supposed to clerk for the Chief Justice of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, Alex Kozinski, the best kind of clerkship you can get straight out of law school.</p>
<p>While Professors Wilson and Herrnstein were attacked for published research, Miss Grace&rsquo;s sins were limited to a one private e-mail. In November 2009, she had a heated conversation with two friends about affirmative action. She apparently didn&rsquo;t mention racial differences, but later clarified her views by e-mail:<blockquote>I just hate leaving things where I feel I misstated my position. I absolutely do not rule out the possibility that African Americans are, on average, genetically predisposed to be less intelligent. I could also obviously be convinced that by controlling for the right variables, we would see that they are, in fact, as intelligent as white people under the same circumstances. The fact is, some things are genetic. African Americans tend to have darker skin. Irish people are more likely to have red hair. Now on to the more controversial. Women tend to perform less well in math due at least in part to prenatal levels of testosterone, which also account for variations in mathematics performance within genders. This suggests to me that some part of intelligence is genetic, just like identical twins raised apart tend to have very similar IQs and just like I think my babies will be geniuses and beautiful individuals whether I raise them or give them to an orphanage in Nigeria.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I think it is bad science to disagree with a conclusion in your heart, and then try (unsuccessfully, so far at least) to find data that will confirm what you want to be true.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</blockquote><p>Miss Grace ended her message ominously: &#8220;Please don&rsquo;t pull a Larry Summers on me,&#8221; but that is exactly what happened. Months later, one of her colleagues apparently took a dislike to her and sent the e-mail text to the Harvard Black Law Students Association. The BLSA then sent it to every other BLSA in the country, along with the following preface:<blockquote>Today I was forwarded an email written by a 3L HLS student (fellow classmate, though I do not know her personally) in which she apologizes to one of her friends for backing off her racist stance at dinner. A recipient of this email has asked that it be shared. The author of the email will be clerking on the 9th Circuit next year, is a member of the Harvard Law Review, FedSoc, and is a graduate of Princeton. I am saddened that a current HLS student holds such antagonistic and archaic views about our people and that the potential impact of her ignorance is only strengthened by her prestigious affiliations and credentials.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</blockquote><p>Miss Grace&rsquo;s message ended up on the popular legal gossip blog, Above the Law, and before long was picked up by even more popular blogs, such as the <cite>Huffington Post</cite> and <cite>Gawker.</cite> The <cite>Harvard Crimson</cite> and <cite>Boston Globe</cite> took up the story. Harvard Law Dean Martha Minow then denounced Miss Grace in a message to everyone at Harvard Law School: <blockquote>I am writing this morning to address an email message in which one of our students suggested that black people are genetically inferior to white people.</p>
<p>This sad and unfortunate incident prompts both reflection and reassertion of important community principles and ideals. We seek to encourage freedom of expression, but freedom of speech should be accompanied by responsibility.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I met with leaders of our Black Law Students Association to discuss how to address the hurt that this has brought to this community.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I share their wish to turn this moment into one that helps us make progress in a community dedicated to fairness and justice.</p>
<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As an educational institution, we are especially dedicated to exposing to the light of inquiry false views about individuals or groups.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>I would like to thank the faculty, administrators, and students who have already undertaken serious efforts to increase our chances for mutual understanding, confrontation of falsehoods, and deliberative engagement with difficult issues, and making this an ever better community.</blockquote><p>The Associated Press picked up Dean Minow&rsquo;s statement, which then made its way into the <cite>Washington Post</cite>, <cite>Atlanta Journal Constitution</cite>, <cite>Miami Herald,</cite> and dozens of other major newspapers.</p>
<p>Of course, Miss Grace apologized:<blockquote>I am deeply sorry for the pain caused by my email. I never intended to cause any harm, and I am heartbroken and devastated by the harm that has ensued. I would give anything to take it back.</p>
<p>I emphatically do not believe that African Americans are genetically inferior in any way. I understand why my words expressing even a doubt in that regard were and are offensive.</p>
<p>I would be grateful to have an opportunity to share my thoughts and to apologize to you in person.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</blockquote><p><b>False Comparisons</b></p>
<p>There will be comparisons to Larry Summers and to James Watson (who quickly backed down when there was an uproar over his musings about blacks and IQ), but it is more instructive to consider how Miss Grace&rsquo;s case is different. She is a student. She speculated in private correspondence to two friends. Dr. Summers and Professor Watson had established careers and reputations that were so strong that they could have pushed the debate forward if they had had enough guts. When eminent, powerful men are made to bow and scrape, what can we expect from Stephanie Grace?</p>
<p>Her apology is therefore much more forgivable, but it will do her no good. Who is going to believe that she &#8220;emphatically&#8221; does not believe something she considered quite possible a few months ago? The only result is that the anti-science ideologues have again demonstrated their tremendous power.</p>
<p>How do the lefties justify attacking a non-public figure because of private correspondence? They claim that if she gets a federal clerkship she will be in a position to oppress blacks. As <cite>The American Prospect</cite>&rsquo;s Tapped blog argued:<blockquote>Grace is possibly about to launch a career in the public sector which, frankly, makes her an employee  &mdash;  and steward  &mdash;  of the general population. And I don&rsquo;t want to hire her. I suppose it&rsquo;s remotely possible that there&rsquo;s such a thing as a government agency where issues of racial justice do not matter, but the federal justice system is definitely not that place.</blockquote><p>At the same time, the Left is utterly unprincipled, and doesn&rsquo;t hesitate to junk the rules when it comes to &#8220;racists.&#8221; The gossip blog Gawker, which first published Miss Grace&rsquo;s identity, justified it this way:<blockquote>We shouldn&rsquo;t really be worried about the privacy of people who actually mull over the possibility, the mayyyybe, that on an unchangeable genetic level, black people are not as smart as white people. It&rsquo;s the willingness to even entertain the conversation that smacks of ugly.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Why did your brain go there? Because you&rsquo;re an eensy bit racist, is why. In 2010 these people&rsquo;s rocks should be overturned, because they&rsquo;re jerks and sometimes public shaming is just what the doctor ordered.</blockquote><p>Another reason lefties decided to stomp on Miss Grace is that they are incredibly status conscious, and think they are smarter than conservatives, and especially &#8220;racists.&#8221; They are terrified to think that a young lady who is smarter and more accomplished than they are could be thinking &#8220;racist&#8221; thoughts. Alternet&rsquo;s headline was &#8220;When Smart People Say Stupid Things.&#8221; The <cite>Boston Globe</cite>&rsquo;s Brainiac blog acknowledged that &#8220;Grace&rsquo;s comments have drawn attention partly because she&rsquo;s a <cite>Harvard Law Review</cite> editor and headed for an elite appeals-court clerkship.&#8221; In a piece entitled, &#8220;Ho Sit Down: Harvard Law Student Shames Obama&rsquo;s Alma Mater With Ignorant Email,&#8221; the gossip blog Bossip said it was &#8220;worth mentioning that this student graduated from Princeton in 2007 with a degree in sociology.&#8221; It went on to marvel at her position on the Law Review and her post-grad plans to work for Judge Alex Kozinski.</p>
<p>Another major difference between what happened to Miss Grace and to Dr. Summers and Professor Watson is the role of the Internet. What prominent men do is news, and their remarks would have created the same storm 20 years ago. Miss Grace&rsquo;s ordeal is different. There would have been no story about her prior to the proliferation of gossip and political blogs. The <cite>Boston Globe</cite> and <cite>Washington Post</cite> covered this non-story only after hundreds of self righteous liberal bloggers had vented their collective indignation. The Internet has been a great tool for race realists, but it is a double-edged sword.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Mss Grace is not without defenders. Many people have spoken up not only for her freedom of speech, but also for the proposition that racial differences may be genetic. Eugene Volokh who teaches law at UCLA and publishes the popular legal blog, The Volokh Conspiracy, wrote that he hoped there were no racial differences in IQ, but wondered:<blockquote>[What if] scientists know that it&rsquo;s likely professional suicide to argue that some evidence supports the racial differences hypothesis, or undermines the no racial differences hypothesis. Or say they are assured by their colleagues that it&rsquo;s safe to go where they think the evidence might lead, but they see people across the quad in another university department being publicly excoriated for even accepting the <em>possibility</em> of the outcome that those scientists suspect might be worth testing for. Or say that journalists or outsiders who think there might be scientific groupthink undermining the soundness of the scientific process suspect that it&rsquo;s likely professional suicide to challenge no-racial-difference arguments.</p>
<p>At that point, the very attempt to suppress the openness to the possibility that there might be racial differences will <em>make it impossible to disprove that possibility.</em> [emphasis in original]</blockquote><p>David Lat, an Asian who founded Above the Law, wrote:<blockquote>Let me play devil&rsquo;s advocate for a second.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>If we accept &#8220;race&#8221; as a biological concept  &mdash;  which I realize is questionable, becoming diluted through intermarriage, etc.  &mdash;  is it really so insane to suggest that some races might, ON AVERAGE, possess certain qualities to a greater or lesser degree than other races?</p>
<p>For example, would it be racist to say that, ON AVERAGE, African-Americans are taller than Asian-Americans? Or that Caucasians are more likely to have blond hair than Asian-Americans?</blockquote><p>Above the Law, which appeals to students at elite law schools and associates at big law firms, asked its readers if they thought Miss Grace&rsquo;s views were &#8220;racist.&#8221; Fifty-seven percent said they were not. When asked if her comments were offensive, 65 percent said they were somewhat or very offensive, but 12.5 percent replied, &#8220;not at all, in fact I AGREE with her.&#8221; This means one out of eight readers agreed with a proposition that would get them excoriated by their deans and the national media.</p>
<p>It is hard to gauge the effect that this controversy will have on the overall discussion about race differences. I suspect it will prompt many independent thinkers to take a look at the evidence. At the same time, this will make the great taboo even more off limits than before.</p>
<p>In the inaugural issue of <cite>American Renaissance,</cite> Jared Taylor recounted the furor over Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone comment that America had lost its competitive edge because of large numbers of blacks and Hispanics. Mr. Taylor asked, &#8220;How many Americans must have thought to themselves, &#8216;Mr. Nakasone is right&rsquo;  &mdash;  and said nothing?&#8221;</p>
<p>More and more people are beginning to have heterodox thoughts, but they have more and more reason to say nothing.</p>

		<p>As a rational, thinking, observant human being I have noticed the following:</p>
<p>Blacks (not mixed race), generally have curlier hair, larger lips, darker skin pigment, better athletic abilities, better dancing abilities, are more sexually active, and the males have more muscle tone than other races.  These observatiuons could be viewed as positive or nuetral traits.  Therefore the question is, are these truths, misconceptions, am I mistaken, or am I a racist?</p>
<p>On the other hand, I have also noticed blacks generally are not as intelligent, are more prone to crime, and are more prone to violence than other races. Now am I a racist?</p>
<p>I have noticed that most black civilizations never advanced on their own much past the stone-age level.</p>
<p>I have also noticed that some traits in life are passed down genetically and some are learned either culturally or as individuals. I have noticed that other mammals have been selectively bred for intelligence or for other traits that are more desirable and the the outcomes are almost always fruitful. </p>
<p>I believe that some traits are handed down genetically through our ancestors and we are the product of a long line of random DNA experiments that have delivered large groups of people with very similar traits. Given enough time and isolation mammals develop some unique characteristics that set hem apart form other isolated groups.</p>
<p>If I combine all these thoughts together and one day I ponder the possibilty, that like other mammals our intelligence may have in some way been handed down to some degree through our ancestral DNA&hellip;does that make me a racist?</p>
<p>It is odd that in a country that advocates free speech a law student having a PRIVATE communication can become demonized because a debatable thought occurred to her which she expressed to a friend.</p>
<p>How sad that we can&rsquo;t even ponder a thought and talk about it in a supposed free and open democratic society.  We are doomed if this trend continues.</p>

		<p>More attention needs to be paid to what&rsquo;s going on behind the scenes here. And who is behind them. <br>
It seems there was a cat fight between former friends. Here&rsquo;s a picture of the parties involved. Miss Grace is clearly a white woman. Unquestionably white.  The other party is not.  Why has management (meaning Dean Martha Minow) taken the side of the &#8220;other&#8221; party and violated this young woman&rsquo;s right to privacy?<br>
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/2d9lrm2" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2d9lrm2</a><br>
As another poster said elsewhere,  &#8220;Why is there no outrage at THE LEAKER?  Somebody took words from a <i> PRIVATE  </i>conversation  among friends and deliberately sent them someplace where they would cause harm!   Why isn&rsquo;t she being re-educated about respect for privacy?  Seems to me the &#8220;right to privacy&#8221; used  to be cherished by liberals.&#8221;    <br>
Well, it used to be;  but is the right to privacy now anulled in cases where race is involved?  Apparently.  At least at Harvard.<br>
As always with the extreme Left, there is a strict hierarchy of values. And race trumps privacy.</p>

<p>That doesn&rsquo;t even matter.  Or it shouldn&rsquo;t.  Whether they were &#8220;racist&#8221; or not, or even &#8220;offensive&#8221;, ought to be irrelevant.  Even whether (or not) they &#8220;agree with her&#8221; should be irrelevant. (Does agreeing with her make it more permissible?)  </p>
<p>It should be her right to have &#8220;racist&#8221; opinions,  no matter what anyone thinks, and it&rsquo;s nobody else&rsquo;s business.  There should be no need to explain, apologize, or grovel.  Your mind and your thoughts are your own.  (Or aren&rsquo;t they?)  At least they USED to be! But maybe not today at Harvard. </p>
<p>Well, as Harvard goes today, so the rest of the nation goes in twenty years. This is one of the prime training grounds for our new radical elites who are bent on re-making us into the image they would like us to be.  The ruling elites  (like Minow) don&rsquo;t like us the way we are, so we will have to be either re-shaped or replaced.  They&rsquo;re working on it.</p>

		<p>I agree with this young lady, and it galls me to see that the unprincipled Left is going to scar her career before it even begins.  She certainly had the right to express her views without censure - whoever sent her email should be nailed to the nearest wall.  This is, though, how the Left operates.  Grab something even a mere student says, and flay them alive on the grill of pseudointellectualism.  True intellectuals would allow her to have her say, and then express their own views.  That&rsquo;s how it was in the 1970&rsquo;s, before PC took over and replaced the practice of civility with pure animalistic myopia and violence.</p>

<p>So says the anonymous Marxist on Gawker!</p>
<p>How funny, that I find myself in full agreement with this Red imp; certainly not in the Comrade&rsquo;s same leftward direction, but in a soaring rightwing one toward a better future!!!</p>
<p>I firmly believe (and this words, clearly holds this to be true) that we are playing a zero-sum game here, on the questions of race and genetics versus universal &ldquo;humanism.&rdquo;  Thus, I want to tip the scales toward racial and genetic reality, and smash all countercultural utopian precepts. If this means utterly destroying the privacy and life of the unnamed Communist in question, oh well.</p>
<p>So here goes, I need only translate his above rants and raves, into coherent English:</p>
<p>&lsquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t really be worried about the privacy of Reds who actually mull over the possibility, the fashionable maybe, that on an &ldquo;unchangeable&rdquo; socially enforced level, white people must be brainwashed into accepting themselves as equal to (or even inferior to) nonwhite people. It&rsquo;s the willingness to even entertain the conversation that smacks of ugly&hellip; . Why did your brain or dialectic even go there? Because you&rsquo;re an unfathomably and unforgivably genocidal Red, seeking the multicultural extermination for whites and their civilization. In 2010 these people&rsquo;s rocks should be overturned, because they&rsquo;re both psychopathic and utterly worthless,  and sometimes public shaming is just what the good &ldquo;comrade&rdquo; doctor ordered.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

		<p>Not surprising that Gawker led the way here. Gawker readers are the absolute dregs of humanity, hipster losers who have accomplished nothing and try to compensate by shouting down people who dare to think a bit differently. The good news is that Gawker readers tend to rent apartments in ghettos, under the reasoning that to not do so would be racist. Then they get the education of a lifetime.</p>

		<p>The issue here is Free Speech.  Let&rsquo;s keep in mind that if tenured faculty members have had enough pressure put on them that they were forced to take back their statements   &mdash;   (Imagine the department chairman says: &#8220;How would you like to be teaching three sections of 100 students each in Principles of Biology?  Lose your laboratory, graduate assistant and research budget?&#8221;)   &mdash;   then the pressure on a student who hasn&rsquo;t graduated is crushing.  Maybe she fails a course or has an incomplete.  Then she doesn&rsquo;t graduate; she can&rsquo;t take the bar exam and the clerkship is withdrawn.   Or she graduates but doesn&rsquo;t pass the bar exam; in that anonymous, jealously-guarded procedure, she would never know why she didn&rsquo;t pass the bar exam.

The lesson is clear: free speech means you are free to repeat the prevailing ideology.</p>
<p>During the Cold War, the story was an American in Moscow said, &ldquo;In my free country, I am free to openly speak out again President Nixon.&rdquo;   The Russian replied, &ldquo;I am also in a free country.  I too can freely speak out against President Nixon.&rdquo;<br>

		<p>Miss Grace,</p>
<p>White privilege is a dead term, used only by those people that have either been asleep for the last 50 years, or those who choose not to see the reality of the situation. <br>
	<br>
Privilege is defined as an advantage, right, or benefit that is not available to everyone, if whites were truly privileged; whites would feel secure discussing racial issues and protected from media slander while doing so, whites would feel safe walking through black neighborhoods.<br>
	</p>
<p>Blacks need to stir the racial cauldron to prove white supremacists still exist, so when their race baiting fails to produce the desired result they grow increasingly frustrated and resort to falsifying claims bigotry and hate to gain sympathy for their cause.</p>
<p>	The Blacks will continue to be under achievers until the whites admit that blacks simply lack the intellectual capacity to compete, the blacks struggle will indeed be more pronounced if the whites fail to edify them about their cultural disparity as well.</p>

<p>Without a voice to save ourselves! </p>
<p>The enemy has set up laws (anti-discrimination, hate laws etc) to shut us up and if we don&rsquo;t then we will have hell to pay! Our internal and external enemy knows Whites are too law abiding and too afraid to voice any opinion about race. </p>
<p>After all, doesn&rsquo;t their church tell them to love their enemy, pray for their enemy, turn the other cheek, God loves everybody, etc. etc.  This sounds like a doctrine for the genocide of Whites to me. Maybe they TWISTED the Bible on purpose?  Food for thought.</p>

<p>The lies are so entrenched in favor of concepts that are so obviously wrong it&rsquo;s necessary to waste time and effort to make detailed analysis and arguments supporting what anybody in the real world knows is the obvious truth.  It&rsquo;s really like laying out an argument that there is no Santa Claus.</p>
<p>I regard supporting the position that blacks are less intelligent than the other races of the earth as useless against true believers who are as close to zonked out kool aid drinkers as they can get, without actually being in some kind of wacky sect that believes someday they will colonize Jupiter.</p>
<p>It is the separatists who are now living in small self-sufficient communities who have the right idea about how to cope with this spiraling degeneration of society.  They have opted out in favor of building societies that are to their liking without the manipulation by radicals who are completely worthless to society and humanity.</p>
<p>Attempting to fix this present society is completely useless.  It CANNOT improve and is destined to go belly up.</p>
<p>Living apart in smaller societies either by secession or by relocation to remote areas is the only way to go. </p>

		<p>She&rsquo;s not clerking at the Supreme Court, she&rsquo;s clerking for the liberal extremist 9th Circuit BUT she&rsquo;s clerking for a quasi-libertarian on the Circuit, Chief Judge Alex Kozinski.  Yes, this is prestigious but it&rsquo;s not on the same level as clerking for, say, Chief Justice Roberts.</p>
<p>Kozinski might actually sympathize with her plight because he ran into some problems of his own a couple years ago after a website he operated with son was revealed to the public.  Some lawyer wanted Kozinski to recuse himself from a case because of the website (he only did this because he knew Kozinski wasn&rsquo;t sympathetic to his case).  The website contained some embarrassingly bawdy humor (he&rsquo;s a libertarian so the controlled media reported it as a &#8220;porn website&#8221;).  He weathered the storm, and he&rsquo;s still where he was so he might actually feel badly for this poor girl.</p>

		<p>Dean Minow&rsquo;s statement amounts to slander.  I would hope that her victim seeks legal recourse against that slander.</p>
<p>Stephanie Grace did not &#8216;suggest&rsquo; that Africans are less intelligent (or, as Dean Minow states, that they are &#8216;genetically inferior to whites&rsquo;).  Grace, instead, very clearly stated that her mind was not closed to the possibility that they are &#8216;less intelligent&rsquo;.  If Dean Minow cannot, or will not, distinguish between a suggestion that something is true, and a declaration that one is WILLING TO CONSIDER that something MIGHT be true, then the Dean should not be allowed to continue at her post.  </p>
<p>I almost suggested that Dean Minnow should, instead, work in Daycare.  However, I sense that a lack of protectiveness for those whose best interests it would be her job to protect might make her unsuitable for the job.  Possibly, she should have studied Library Science or Cosmetology.  Logic, an area where Dean Minow is clearly deficient, is an integral part of Law.  It is unfortunate that this woman chose to study Law, and even more unfortunate that Harvard should have placed her in a high position within its School of Law.</p>
<p>Dean Minow stated that Stephanie Grace had suggested that blacks were &#8216;genetically inferior&rsquo; to whites.  Grace did no such thing.  Had Grace suggested that blacks were less intelligent than whites (which she did not), an implicit assumption that they were also INFERIOR would not logically follow.  Stephanie Grace did not state or imply that being less intelligent is the same as being inferior. That was an assumption of Dean Minow&rsquo;s, and, in my opinion, a slanderous one.</p>
<p>Since this was a private affair at the time Stephanie Grace emailed her clarification to her friend, Dean Minow could have remained silent.  Harvard could have remained uninvolved.  But in her condemnation of Grace, Minow acted as the agent of Harvard.  One would hope that both Minow and the University would be responsible for compensating Stephanie Grace for the obvious damage Minow&rsquo;s condemnation has done to Grace&rsquo;s future prospects.</p>

		<p>About time to bring some science into the equation.  Somehow it always confuses the ideologue.</p>
<p>Central to their denialism is the heritability of intelligence.  Can they then disprove the results from the study, &#8216;Genetics of Brain Fiber Architecture and Intellectual Performance&rsquo; from the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, Department of Neurology, UCLA, dated Feb 18, 2009?  &#8220;The study is the first to analyze genetic and environmental factors that affect brain fiber architecture and its genetic linkage with cognitive function &hellip;&hellip;. In a cross-trait mapping approach, common genetic factors mediated the correlation between IQ and white matter integrity, suggesting a common physiological mechanism for both, and common genetic determination.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then there is the evidence assembled by a team of scientists in St Louis led by psychiatric geneticists at the Washington University School of Medicine.  They found the most extensive evidence to date that a gene that activates signalling pathways in the brain influences one kind of intelligence, and in so doing they have confirmed the link between the CHRM2 gene and performance IQ which involves a person&rsquo;s ability to organize things logically.</p>
<p>Additionally, a report in Science Daily (Apr.27, 2006), informs us that psychiatric researchers at The Zucker Hillside Hospital campus of The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research have uncovered evidence of a gene that appears to influence intelligence, &#8220;A robust body of evidence suggests that cognitive abilities, particularly intelligence, are significantly influenced by genetic factors. Existing data already suggests that dysbindin may influence cognition,&#8221; said Katherine Burdick, PhD, the study&rsquo;s primary author. &#8220;We looked at several DNA sequence variations within the dysbindin gene and found one of them to be significantly associated with lower general cognitive ability in carriers of the risk variant compared with non-carriers in two independent groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!, but that says nothing about race&#8221;, the denialists cry.  Nevertheless there exists a publicly available gene database known as The HapMap Project.  It holds random samples of genetic sequences from people of European ancestry in the United States, as well as people from Nigeria, China, and Japan. &#8220;It is now possible to search the HapMap database for genes that have been linked with intelligence in published scientific studies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps now the race/IQ denialists would like to do some research to disprove the statistics that so bedevil their ideological standpoint?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re waiting.</p>

Why has management (meaning Dean Martha Minow) taken the side of the &ldquo;other&rdquo; party and violated this young woman&rsquo;s right to privacy?&#8221;</p>

How can discussing, in theory, a very real policy active at Harvard, where Harvard discriminates against white men every day, how can this get the White Person kicked out of school for being bigoted?</p>
<p>I &#8216;disagree&rsquo; with the authors statement at the beginning, &#8220;Life has not been easy for dissidents from blank-slate orthodoxy at Harvard. In 2005&hellip; &#8220;</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really live in a society that believes humans are a &#8216;blank slate&rsquo;. Every since the end of WWII, and the beginning of &#8216;anti-colonialism&rsquo;, we&rsquo;ve lived in a society that has believed two separate things at the same time. Lived by two separate standards, as it were. Whites Are governed by &#8216;original sin&rsquo;. Whites are guilty until they prove themselves innocent. They must be monitored at all times, like this girl, but in every way we are taught that it is non-whites who are a blank slate; noble and pure beings, with vibrant powers, who are only corrupted after having been in contacted with white people or white greed or morality. And whenever in the world non-whites do wrong, either as a group or individually, this is at it&rsquo;s heart caused by whites. This certainly would seem a backward view of civilization&hellip; Exalting the most violent and primitive&hellip; It&rsquo;s easy to see why people of color sell this idea of moral superiority to their populations&hellip; perhaps it even puts them in the mood to want to live among us, those they feel superior to&hellip; what&rsquo;s harder to figure out is why the seat of this idea is inside white nations themselves&hellip;</p>

		<p>This is a watershed moment if you think about it. This is, in a way, the first person of her background to have such comments carried nationally - comments that many whites have been too coerced or frightened to say. </p>
<p>Being the first she had to bear the strongest reaction. But it will empower someone, somewhere, of similar ilk, to voice the same opinion. And then again somewhere else, and so on&hellip;The leftist liars and race traitors can never hope to mount such a fierce response on a regular basis to continued comments on race and IQ. Over time more whites will feel less hesitant to open up on the subject until a critical mass is reached.</p>

		<p>There really is no excuse for this.  The most prestigious university in the country suppresses free speech.  Not uncivil speech, not threatening speech, but an opinion on a public issue, expressed privately.  Higher education in this country needs to be abolished, as it is a criminal fraud.

		<p>It is important to note the subtle twist that Harvard Law Dean Martha Minow gave to Ms. Grace&rsquo;s message when she said that &ldquo;one of our students suggested that black people are genetically inferior to white people&rdquo;.</p>
<p>From a Darwinian standpoint, the measure of genetic fitness is number of offspring, that is, reproductive success. It makes no more sense to say that low intelligence people are inferior than it does to say that short people are genetically superior. The measure of genetic &ldquo;superiority/inferiority&rdquo; is whether or not a group is successfully reproducing, which blacks do well.</p>
<p>Academics like to ram evolution down people&rsquo;s throats to weaken their religious beliefs, but they refuse to apply it to their own beliefs. (Not surprisingly, they also seem to think that intelligence is the only aspect of a person that counts.)</p>
<p>Ms. Grace should sue the Dean for misrepresenting what she said and destroying her career.<br>

<p>It should be clear which category little Stephanie falls under. We may be absolutely certain that she did not rise to such a lofty height without having betrayed her fellow white people and white men in particular.

<p>You are so right, all she did was state that she has an open mind. My Gosh, what a racist bigot! </p>
<p>Personally I would have thought that this is exactly what universities want from their students. To be as objective as Stephanie was to any argument that one finds themselves in. Lawyers or judges must have an open mind which actually makes her a perfect candidate if one subtracts political correctness from the equation. Surely these legal minds denouncing Stephanie should realise that you need to be able to argue from both sides to be an effective lawyer. Whoops, guess I was wrong.</p>
<p>It is such a pity that she decided to grovel and since she did this I don&rsquo;t think there is anyway that she would even think about taking on Harvard or even Minow in a slander lawsuit. Not at this time anyway. Right now I am betting she just wants this whole thing to die down.</p>
<p>I think that one needs to keep a very low profile when dealing with the issue of race. By all means, educate yourself, but keep your views to yourself and those you can trust. At all times you must act as if you agree with the prevailing winds, and if you are at university, tell your lecturers exactly what you know they want to hear. You can harp on about how the current system is unfair but do you really think our enemies care about how we feel? Hell no, they want us out of the way, or worse, dead. </p>
<p>The first thing that White Nationalists need to do is to get rid of the stigma related to that dreaded word &#8220;Racist&#8221;. Once this is done we will find the road to freedom from Marxist oppression far easier. Imagine them trying to attack Stephanie without the charge of racism? They couldn&rsquo;t and she would be free to state exactly what she feels. </p>
<p>We need to find an appropriate answer to the charge of racism that doesn&rsquo;t involve groveling.</p>

		<p>The Grace episode seems to indicate that Liberalism has morphed from an ideology into a quasi-religion. Note that Ms. Grace&rsquo;s field of study is law, not psychology, anthropology, or any life science. Yet her views on the subject of mental capacity are of grave concern to the Dean of the law school (and many others at Harvard). This is the type of attitude that I associate with religious beliefs, not with scientific opinions. Would the views of a physics student on habeas corpus be of overriding interest to the Dean of the physics department? I don&rsquo;t think so. Yet Dean Minnow is outraged at a statement by Ms. Grace about which neither one has Harvard level qualifications to have an independent opinion. Smells like a religious dispute to me!</p>

Also, just because some white nationalists dated outside their race or had a baby outside their race doesn&rsquo;t discredit the entire movement.  What about black nationalists or blacks who hate whites, yet they&rsquo;ll sleep with white women and live in a predominately white country?  Strom was young when he slept with a black girl.  We all make mistakes.  We all did something when were younger that we wish we&rsquo;d not have done.  That doesn&rsquo;t mean that we are hypocrites for preaching against something today that we did yesterday.</p>

<p>Whatever the case may be, Whites DO NOT hunt down, assault, murder and rape blacks  &mdash;  rape being an act of war  &mdash;  while the media look the other way (as part of its ongoing War on Whites).</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; Using data obtained from the FBI and Bureau of Justice Statistics&hellip;90 percent of the approximate 1,700,000 interracial VIOLENT crimes reported each year involve black perpetrators and white victims [emphasis mine]&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet according to the media, the SPLC, the ADL and the government, the greatest threat to the US is &#8216;homegrown WHITE terrorists.&rsquo;  One would think there were a White Crime Wave in NY City from watching CSI.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Freudian psychologists need to devote more study to this issue&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>No, they don&rsquo;t.  They&rsquo;d come to the same conclusion Freudians have always come to:  White Sexual Repression or White Anal Retention to explain away any/all White pathologies.</p>
<p>Freud has long been discredited: &#8220;behaviorism finally ran out of steam when psychologists showed that human learning couldn&rsquo;t be explained without cognition, and since then cognitive science has been slowly and gradually accumulating knowledge of the inner workings of the human mind&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Freud did, however, serve a useful purpose to those whose desire was to destroy Western Civilization. </p>
<p>His stupid theories, accepted as dogma in academia and intelligentsia, are some of THE main reasons for the debasement and decline of Western Civilization.  Freud and his theories, did untold damage to Native Born White American Culture as we and our culture were pathologized and criticized in the harshest terms possible.  </p>
<p> Meanwhile, Freud was deified by the media, academia and intelligentsia and to challenge his unprovable  theories was heresy  &mdash;  but that didn&rsquo;t matter to the alien hostile elite, destruction of Western Civilization and Whites being their main goal.   </p>
<p>He believed all anxieties and neuroses were caused by sexual repression:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Freud&rsquo;s writings are replete with assertions on the need for greater sexual freedom to overcome debilitating neurosis.</p>
<p>Freud&rsquo;s theory was that Western culture is pathogenic as a result of the repression of sexual urges&hellip;Freud points the way to a nonexploitative utopian civilization that would result from the complete end of sexual repression.</p>
<p>Freud himself said:  &ldquo;Sexual morality  &mdash;  as society in its extreme form, the American, defines it  &mdash;  is contemptible. I advocate an incomparably freer sexual life.&rdquo; </p>
<p>And, as he was traveling to America, Freud stated:  &#8220;If only Americans knew, we are bringing them the plague!&#8221; </p>
<p>Yeah, no kidding.</p>

		<p>Of course Blacks, on average, are less intelligent than members of every other race. Everyone knows it, even Blacks themselves. The problem has more to do with the legacy of slavery, for which Whites should rightly take blame. In a way, you can&rsquo;t really blame Blacks - imagine how, if you were a Black, it would feel to have to interact, on a daily basis, with the White descendants of the slaveholders, who basically traded your ancestors like property. </p>
<p>The best thing to do would be to reacquaint Blacks with their African heritage, so that they could gradually move *back* to Africa. Unfortunately, Africa is not America&hellip; this creates another dilemma - that Blacks are STUCK in America for all time to come. The next best thing to do is have an open discussion race and intelligence, and gradually encourage Blacks to attend trade schools, and, thereafter, pay them a decent wage for menial work. At least, this would solve the issue of immigration. </p>

		<p>Re 38 and 57<br>
I find these posts especially commendable.<br>
  What did she say?  Nothing  &mdash;  nothing other than that she was somewhat informed (possibly, given her merits, very<br>
well informed ) but remained AGNOSTIC about the matter and treated the issue with great care and caution!!. When a position like this can attract the witchfinders,  we are<br>
already well into what the late Glayde Whitney in a 1997 commentary speculated might become A New Dark Age.  He was prescient.      </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think Strom Thurmond is the best example of a doctrinaire WN.  He was an opportunistic politician, pure and simple.  When it benefited him to sound like a WN, he did.  When it benefited him not to sound like a WN, he didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The reason George Wallace&rsquo;s independent candidacy for President in 1968 didn&rsquo;t succeed in its goal of throwing the election to the House was that he didn&rsquo;t win NC and SC.  The reason that didn&rsquo;t happen is because Strom Thurmond, who by 1968 morphed from segregationist to standard Republican, shilled for Richard Nixon in those two states, getting enough people who would have voted Wallace to vote for Nixon.  Ironically, Thurmond&rsquo;s own Presidential campaign 20 years earlier sought to do just that, win enough Southern states in order to throw the decision to the House.</p>

		<p>With due respect to the brilliance and remarkable qualities of character producing American Renaissance and this web page,<br>
making much ado about poll results (Above the Law ) is about like preferring to &#8220;view&#8221; a beauty queen by looking only at her shadow in the late afternoon sun.  If ever a circumstance cried out for (necessarily covert ) Candid Camera documentation, this climate of almost virus like fear is such.  My own personal observations  over time, if captured this way, would reveal the astonishing terror and confusion and reflexive evasion that pervades this issue among virtually the whole of the reading public in America.  The topic of bio-diversity and differential<br>
effects of human evolution is rendered utterly trivial by the quality of the unvoiced  &mdash;  and often unrecognized!!  &mdash;  terror and repression.  It is a focus for the artist  &mdash;  not the science journalist or syndicated columnist,or academic etc.  It is especially a topic for the film art.  The taboo will be broken, if at all, in this medium and from work originating within, but developed and produced  outside of, the USA.  It is a challenge at this point that only the Poets of the world can surmount, if anyone can.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m curious what sort of benefits a person like Ms. Grace expects to reap by taking such a position; after all, it&rsquo;s women like her that gain enormously by collaborating with these types of people (i.e. the ones she suspects might be genetically predisposed to lower intelligence). </p>
<p>She is only hurting herself by taking such a position; it would be far more sensible for her to continue collaborating with the other members of the &#8216;coalition of the oppressed&rsquo;&hellip;</p>

		<p>Obviously two diametrically opposed positions. Of the two above positions, which position would most benefit White people?</p>
<p>In my opinion, voter&rsquo;s position seems to offer the least benefit to Whites. Am I seeing this correctly?<br>
   &mdash;  Iconoclast<br>
_____</p>
<p>Yes, you ARE seeing it correctly.  <br>
But I didn&rsquo;t write it as <i>advocacy,</i> but as a  <i>warning</i> that this view could become a PERMANENT one leading to perpetual dependency.</p>

		<p> I find at the end of the story Mr. Yasuhiro Nakasones comment very interesting in light of the fact what happened to the American auto industry. Wonder what he would say today? When they had cash for clunkers people bought Toyotas and Hondas the most. Look at Toyota today. Looks like anybody can mess up! A divided kingdom ends in ruin. A city or home divided against itself cannot stand. Matt. 12: 25 All Americas enemies have to do is sit and wait. Sometimes the more accurate saying might be the blind leading the blind and we are all going to fall in the ditch.</p>

<p>A virtual guarantee, since the 9th Circuit is where the most bizarre, un-Constitutional, America-hating, insane, whacked-out, uber-Marxist higher-court decisions always come from.  You&rsquo;d think that as a law student, she would have known this.  As a matter of fact, her invite was probably pulled the minute this ridiculous kerfuffle erupted.  If not, I will be very, VERY surprised&hellip;</p>
