<h1>Many Fear Recent In-Fighting May Be Death Knell for SCLC</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rhonda Cook, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, May 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Southern Christian Leadership is in a very public fight with itself, a battle that some fear will kill one of the nation&rsquo;s premier civil rights groups.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the past, internal disagreements  &mdash;  frequently described as family fights  &mdash;  were usually resolved discreetly within the Atlanta-based group. But not this time.</p>
<p>In the past six months, two feuding factions have called a string of news conferences. They have made almost weekly trips to the courthouse to argue over who is on the board of directors and who is not; over who has control of the SCLC, and who does not.</p>
<p>On Monday night, the rift took a bizarre turn when one of those up front in the fight, Rev. Markel Hutchins, welded shut a back door to the SCLC headquarters on Auburn Avenue and put heavy chains and padlocks on gates to the parking lot. The next day at a news conference, he proclaimed himself SCLC interim president, chief executive officer and chief financial officer, saying a faction of the organization&rsquo;s board had named him to those posts.</p>
<p>By Tuesday night, both sides of the fight were suggesting they may seek criminal trespass warrants against each other.</p>
<p>It was simply the latest twist in a civil war within the 53-year-old civil rights organization. And those troubles have been compounded by criminal investigations by federal, state and local authorities that began earlier this year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Civil rights leaders and academicians agree that the current fight cannot be resolved by internal negotiations and will have to be settled by a court. Fulton Superior Court Judge Alford Dempsey has scheduled a day-long hearing for June 2.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The dispute began last summer when a former SCLC board member raised questions about spending. A subsequent internal review found expenditures totaling $569,000 that were approved by or paid to chairman Raleigh Trammell of Dayton, Ohio, and treasurer Spiver Gordon of Eutaw, Ala. Some board members said the expenditures were never approved by directors. Others said the funds were already budgeted.</p>
<p>Last fall, Trammell and Gordon initially said they would take leaves of absences until an internal review was completed. When the pair still hadn&rsquo;t stepped aside by December, other board members voted to oust them. SCLC supporters of Trammell and Gordon responded by filing a lawsuit in Fulton Superior Court to get them reinstated.</p>
<p>Within a few weeks, the allegations of spending improprieties became the focus of criminal investigations by the Fulton County District Attorney&rsquo;s Office in Atlanta, the attorney general in Alabama and the FBI in Ohio, where federal agents raided Trammell&rsquo;s home and office earlier this year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Aside from the criminal probe, both sides have continued to take their complaints to court and the press. Each insists they are the true board of directors, which has led to dueling board meetings, and votes to remove members of the opposing side. Accusations, often personal in nature, have been traded. The anti-Trammell group has referenced his and Gordon&rsquo;s decades-old convictions for frauds (Trammell in 1978; Gordony in 1999). The pro-Trammell group has described their opponents as &#8220;dissidents&#8221; and &#8220;renegades.&#8221; Some of the actions have been labeled as &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; committed by &#8220;thugs.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The months of turmoil have resulted in a near-paralysis of the organization King and Rev. Ralph David Abernathy created in 1957 with a philosophy of peaceful protests. {snip}  The SCLC has been fighting a slow drift into obscurity that befell other once-major civil rights groups, such as the Congress of Racial Equality [CORE] and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee [SNCC], both of which eventually disbanded.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s been years since the organization was at the forefront of high-profile social issues.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>SCLC leaders insist the most recent fight has not affected membership. Rev. Bernard LaFayette, a member of the anti-Trammell board, said the number of members has held steady at 10,000 over in the past five years. SCLC&rsquo;s 2007 tax returns shows $889,404 in gifts and grants. The 2008 return, the most recent one filed, shows gifts total almost $1.2 million.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Two of King&rsquo;s children, former SCLC president Martin Luther King III and current president-elect Rev. Bernice King, also have remained silent. Bernice King plans to stay out of the dispute until the lawsuit is resolved and she takes over as SCLC president this summer, LaFayette said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The leadership is going to have to be settled before we can go forward,&#8221; said Johnson of the pro-Trammell group. &#8220;We&rsquo;re still planning on Bernice King to be the president. The question is what board will she serve with?&#8221;</p>
<p>Even if that question is answered, CAU&rsquo;s Holmes says, it may not be enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;They will never recover,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&rsquo;ve lost credibility.&#8221;</p>

<p>It isn&rsquo;t just this org.  When their common hatred of whitey abates to insignificant levels, they will begin fighting with each other everywhere and about everything.  They will also concentrate on fighting Hispanics even more than they do now.  They will fight more with every sing group in the US once their object white hatred no longer offers them a common purpose, and they will disintegrate.</p>

<p>They throw around these words (hate crimes and thugs, among other cliched words such as fascist) so much they have completely lost their meanings. Its funny though how they even refer to their own people as hate crime-committing thugs.</p>

		<p>SCLC has been mildly critical of Arizona SB 1070.  Ironically, Ralph Abernathy, co-founder of the SCLC, teamed up with Walter Mondale and Cesar Chavez in 1969 to protest illegal immigration at the Mexican border:</p>

		<p>I live just a few miles from Eutaw, Alabama, the home of Spiver Gordon. How this man was elected to anything is a surprise to me. He has convictions for voter fraud and molestation of an underage girl. Yet the SCLC elects him treasurer. It just goes to show that &#8220;civil rights&#8221; organizations are nothing more that scams that line the pockets of phony preachers and their fraudulent NPOs.</p>

I say, the best way to destroy blacks is to give them what they want; or in this case, let them do as they will.</p>
<p>Leave them to their own devices, and they will destroy themselves.</p>

		<p>Whenever an elderly celebrity who hasn&rsquo;t been in the public eye for decades passes away many people shrug and respond &#8220;I didn&rsquo;t know [s]he was still alive!&#8221;</p>
<p>I had the same response when I read that the SCLC was nearing its &#8220;death knell&#8221;. </p>

		<p>This situation is reminiscent of the civil war in the Congo in the 1960&rsquo;s when Patrice Lumumba, Joseph Kasavubu and Moise Tshombe fought each other like wild dogs, over who would control the Congo. The resultant anarchy dragged in the United Nations, in a &#8220;peacekeeping mission&#8221; that lasted several years, and almost bankrupted the UN.</p>
<p>The SCLC fiasco has one Bantu unilaterally declaring himself the &#8220;leader&#8221;, with dissidents forming &#8220;governments in exile&#8221;.</p>
<p>The old adage, &#8220;You can take the black man out of the jungle&hellip;&#8221;is as true as it ever was. </p>

		<p>All these groups are at their core a racket. Remember the recent flap where some &#8220;conservative&#8221; group was trying to get a bribe from UPS or Fed-ex over some legislation? They were going to get their memmers to write letters to congress or something for whoever ponied up the money first.</p>

		<p>This is nothing new; these groups tend to implode once they have achieved a modicum of success. I&rsquo;m waiting for them to start focusing on Hispanics. However, when they do that, it becomes much harder to focus on the evil white man for all of their problems. If this were Mississippi in the 1940&rsquo;s you might have a purpose for this group, but not now. It must be embarrassing to see a group that doesn&rsquo;t speak the language come in and become successful in a generation or two. You can learn English, A work ethic comes from within.</p>
<p>In black neighborhoods, it&rsquo;s not the K riding in on horseback and burning crosses. Now, the problem is gang bangers in pimped out SUV&rsquo;s doing drive-by&rsquo;s.   </p>

		<p>Just like MLK&rsquo;s descendants fighting over money, these folks will exhaust the SCLC&rsquo;s treasury with a flurry of lawsuits against each other.  When the dust settles, the only winners will be the lawyers, and the principal actors will descend into the obscurity they deserve.  The acme of diplomacy was once summed up as &#8220;let&rsquo;s you and him fight&#8221;; this should be a fun one to watch, with a very satisfying conclusion.</p>
