<h1><a href="/articles/2010/05/26/news/00lead.txt">Man Claims Racial Profiling by Melrose Police</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matthew Perenchio, Jackson County Chronicle (Black River Falls, Wisconsin), May 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Quincey L. Daniels has submitted a letter of complaint to the village [of Melrose] and the police department following an incident where he claims an officer overreacted by yelling and reaching for his gun when he exited his vehicle.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Daniels  &mdash;  an African American who teaches race and ethnic studies at Viterbo  &mdash;  said he is upset over the incident that occurred in front of his family at Melrose Express last Thursday during a license plate violation.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the southern areas of the United States this can be a common occurrence, but I hardly expected this from the police department in my own small community,&#8221; said Daniels, who&rsquo;s lived in Mindoro since 2000.</p>
<p>&#8220;I worry about a situation where there&rsquo;s a nervous officer, and my daughter is walking around.&#8221;</p>
<p>The incident occurred at about 3 p.m. May 20. {snip} Daniels reportedly had his rear license plate displayed in the back window, but it had fallen down.</p>
<p>Officer Brandon Arnold  &mdash;  who was on his second day with the department  &mdash;  issued the traffic stop with Sgt. Nick Gray; both officers are Caucasian. However, Daniels reportedly didn&rsquo;t see the emergency lights and continued to Melrose Express.</p>
<p>When Daniels exited his vehicle, Arnold reportedly loudly ordered him to get back into his vehicle, and Arnold placed his hand near his sidearm. Daniels got back into his vehicle and was later issued a verbal warning for the license plate by Gray.</p>
<p>Daniels said he feels Arnold&rsquo;s reactions were based on prejudices of African Americans.</p>
<p>&#8220;At this point I am angry and distrustful, and I need to take a moment to reflect that this was a dangerous situation and that this officer .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. could have been going on an assumption that African American men are violent and not to be trusted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Melrose Police Chief Cal Smokowicz said he has reviewed the situation and police car video footage, and he said race was not a factor in the traffic stop or the officer&rsquo;s actions.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s ridiculous to even suggest that any Melrose officer would ever engage in racial profiling,&#8221; Smokowicz said. &#8220;There&rsquo;s no way I would ever tolerate that. They&rsquo;d be fired.</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&rsquo;t any profiling for people who live in the village or those who live outside the village. I don&rsquo;t care who you are  &mdash;  if you&rsquo;re violating the law, you will be stopped.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Smokowicz said it&rsquo;s the department&rsquo;s intent to issue an apology but noted the apology will only be based on Arnold&rsquo;s demeanor. Smokowicz said Melrose officers do not attempt to cause public disturbances during traffic stops or questioning, but he said Arnold didn&rsquo;t do anything incorrect based on training.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Smokowicz said officers are trained that when a subject exits a vehicle unannounced during a traffic stop they expect the subject to either flee or become confrontational.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Usually, from what I&rsquo;ve seen, when someone&rsquo;s trying to get away, they&rsquo;re running at breakneck speed,&#8221; Daniels said. &#8220;I was walking, and I had my back towards them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Granted the officer was new, but that is no excuse for actions committed in the supposed line of duty.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Even in the military I was taught when you brandish a weapon, you have to be ready to use it. Most people do not like the idea of fearing the people who make a promise to serve and protect.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smokowicz said the department has not taken nor intends to take any internal disciplinary action, and he considers the matter closed.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Arnold was a student of Daniels&rsquo; at Viterbo, although the two didn&rsquo;t recognize each other during the encounter last week.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I can only hope that one day it will not be necessary to teach a race and ethnic studies course in order to get people to acknowledge and accept differences. I still believe that we have a great community, even if we do have our challenges.&#8221;<br>

		<p>I think Prof. Daniels wanted to be stopped, in order to get his name in the headlines.  In other words, it&rsquo;s very similar to the Henry Louis Gates incident of last year, the main difference is that Gates used to be somebody but was quickly being eclipsed by younger, more strident Harvard kooks like Cornell West, while this Daniels was nobody to begin with.</p>

		<p>Why are they issuing an apology?  The officer did nothing to deviate from standard procedure.  From the article it seems that he didn&rsquo;t even unholster his gun.  </p>

		<p>Look what brought the police and Mr. Daniels together - a registration plate on the inside of the car. I wonder why Mr. Daniels (and so many other blacks) place their registration plate inside the vehicle&rsquo;s rear window? How ironic is it that what caused Daniel&rsquo;s encounter with the police was his own stereotyping of blacks as thieves. </p>

		<p>The point of his accusation isn&rsquo;t the merit of the facts. It&rsquo;s to get inside the minds of Whites and implant doubts about White ethical duties.  </p>

		<p>  When you get stopped by a cop you NEVER get out of your car unless instructed to do so.  The Officer doesn&rsquo;t know if your going to start shooting or not.  Traffic stops are the most dangerous part of law enforcement.  Many Officers are killed every year by criminals in just this type of situation.</p>
<p> I&rsquo;m sick and tired of hearing blacks and other minorities screaming about police oppression.  I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be a cop, it&rsquo;s dangerous as hell.  It took me 20 years to get it through my head that the average police officer isn&rsquo;t out to &#8220;oppress&#8221; anyone.  All they&rsquo;re doing is keeping all of us safe and trying to go home to their family&rsquo;s in one piece.</p>
<p> I for one would not want to live in a lawless Nation. </p>

		<p>Another ridiculous story from a Gates wanna-be. It makes my blood boil this dept. would issue an apology at all. I&rsquo;m sure if this so called victim filed any kind of law suit without an apology being issued, he wouldn&rsquo;t have a race card to stand on. What he SHOULD be doing is asking himself WHY it is that any officer reacts the way they do when dealing with blacks. I&rsquo;m sure given the proper statistics,the truth would down right embarrass him. On second thought, I&rsquo;m sure he would still find a way to blame whitey.</p>

		<p>Traffic stops are very procedural, and don&rsquo;t include the driver exiting the vehicle to interact with the officer unless told to do so.</p>
<p>I think Quincey Daniels knew this, and was attempting to take control of the situation away from the officers.  He was shut down, and, unable to decide the terms of the exchange, he is now reacting with inflated indignation.  <br>

<p>No, Mr. Arnolds reactions were probably based on real life experiences with Africans.</p>
<p> &ldquo;At this point I am angry and distrustful, and I need to take a moment to reflect that this was a dangerous situation-</p>

		<p>5 Marble Mason 1:</p>
<p>Just this morning, a St. Louis City cop, a 26-year old Marine and Iraq vet, pulled over a car full of blacks in the black part of St. Louis City.  He and one of the back seat passengers got into an argument, and the passenger unloaded a pistol in the cop&rsquo;s direction.  The cop is going to pull through (knock on wood).  Three of the four passengers were caught very shortly afterward.  They just caught up with the fourth passenger, the alleged shooter, just a few minutes before I&rsquo;m writing this.</p>
<p>I slightly disagree with you; I think the average cop is just doing a job, just like you do your masonry work, and I do my job.  The SLPD had a special mini-academy for city residents about ten years ago, which I went through.  One of the chapters is being able to use the firearms simulator which real cops get to train with.  It&rsquo;s not that I didn&rsquo;t understand this before in the abstract, but using a simulated laser pistol on a simulated real world on a screen in front of you drove it home for me   &mdash;   When you have dealings with a cop, make life as easy as possible for the cop.  It&rsquo;s even more dire than the firearms simulator can portray, because the cop&rsquo;s gun is real, and so are the guns of the miscreants.</p>

		<p>When a cop pulls you over you:</p>
<p>1) stay in the car<br>
2) keep your hands on the wheel (he needs to see that your hands do not hold a weapon)<br>
3) do not go to open the glove box until the officer has asked for your documentation (he needs to see what you are going for)<br>
4) if night time, turn on your dome light as soon as you come to a stop (he needs to see in your car)</p>
<p>These rules apply to everyone.  I almost got a ticket once for not wearing my seat belt because I unhooked it before the cop got to the car (I got my documents out of the glove box before he got to my window and needed to unhook the belt to reach across - many years ago when I was young).</p>
<p>Yes, alot of cops are jerks BUT you never argue with a man with a gun.  NO IF ANDS OR BUTTS!  Geeze, is that so hard for a college professor to understand?</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s needed here is for the POTUS to get involved and have the parties involved to a &#8220;Beer Summit&#8221; at the White House.  This will improve race relations 100% and everyone will leave feeling good, depending upon the beers consumed, and we can continue our march like good leemings should.</p>

		<p>How could any police officer suspect an African American male, driving a vehicle without proper license plates, to be non-compliant with the law?  Has he not heard Obama; has he not been paying attention? Did he simply ignore Sharpton?  And Jackson, too?  Does he not know of the moral glory of the historically disenfranchised?  </p>
<p>We can be sure of one thing: he wasn&rsquo;t a classmate of Kagan&rsquo;s!  This policeman needs diversity training, posthaste.  Wait, wait: this policeperson needs diversity training, right now&hellip;</p>

		<p>It seems the professor has a rather large chip on his shoulder, especially as he teaches &#8216;race and ethnic&rsquo; studies.  I have not known of any race and ethnic studies classes that were anything but White-hating, presenting ALL Whites, especially White police as Hateful Racists.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a piece of advice for this black race hustler and something to teach in his &#8216;race and ethnic&rsquo; studies:  When you drive, don&rsquo;t give the cops reason to pull you over  &mdash;  don&rsquo;t break the speed limit, run red lights, make unsafe lane changes or ignore other traffic laws.  Make sure that you and your car are licensed and that the license plate is in the proper location, not in the back window.  And for God&rsquo;s sake, do not exit the vehicle unless instructed to do so.  Tell every black you know to follow these simple procedures if he objects to being stopped by the racist police.</p>
<p>I know this is a huge burden for blacks as they have great difficulty understanding and conforming to rules of any kind, whether in school, the workplace or in traffic.  If blacks are pulled over for breaking traffic laws, it&rsquo;s because of racial profiling (what they call DWB), if blacks are fired from work for stealing, sub-par performance or not showing up, it&rsquo;s because of racial discrimination, if blacks fail en masse in school, it&rsquo;s because of White oppression.  </p>
<p>This is what PC K-12 schools instill in blacks to cover up for their inherent shortcomings, and I imagine is taught &#8216;race and ethnic&rsquo; studies as well, judging by  professor&rsquo;s statement:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.&rsquo;this officer &hellip; could have been going on an assumption that African American men are violent and not to be trusted.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead of stating:  &#8216;Given that FBI and DOJ statistics show that blacks are seven times more likely than Whites to commit murder, 136 times more likely to commit robbery and 39 times more likely to commit a violent crime against a white than vice versa, it is perfectly understandable for White police officers to be extra vigilant when stopping blacks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(Source:  Color of Crime).</p>
<p>And finally:</p>
<p>I looked up the demographics of Melrose, WI:</p>
<p>Hispanic/Latino: 	0.3%<br>
White: 	99.1%<br>
Black: 	0%<br>
Native American*: 	0%<br>
Asian: 	0.1</p>
<p>I would suggest to the professor that he immediately move himself and his family away from racist Whites to an area that&rsquo;s safer for blacks  &mdash;  one that isn&rsquo;t filled with racist White cops enforcing racist White laws, an area free of White bigots and black racial profiling, where he and other blacks won&rsquo;t have to worry about White oppression  &mdash;  somewhere free of Whites and safe for blacks like Detroit or the Southside of Chicago.</p>
<p>And please pass this information along to any other blacks that might be thinking of moving into areas populated by White racists.</p>
<p>Bon</p>

		<p>Why is it that the only academic positions that blacks obtain and teach in are &#8220;ethnic or black studies&#8221;.  I can only remember having a black professor who taught sociology-at the University of Washington in Seattle, years ago.  Does this fact help to explain the disparities in IQ scores between blacks and whites.  Yes, I agree, another Gates wanna be, as someone else pointed out. If any of these whiny blacks had to go to Haiti and Somalia like I had to - compliments of the U.S. government, maybe there would be a little more gratitude for being able to live here.  Or am I being to optimistic and assuming that these people will ever grow up and start behaving like mature, responsible adults?</p>

		<p>My God.  I will mention that I am familiar with this area.  If you just wish to live and live safely, it doesn&rsquo;t come more safe than this area.  There are reasons for this.  It might be because the citizens there have morals, values, respect for each other, respect for the laws and for law enforcement.  I guarantee that among the typical traffic stops there, people would NEVER get out of the car.  There is NO reason to!  I suspect it was to argue with the officer.  If you need to ask the officer a question even to the point of arguing you can do it when HE ASKS YOU if you have any questions.  Why oh why would you get out of the car during a minor traffic stop?  Insanity!  </p>
