<h1>African Influx Reshapes Immigration to Minnesota</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Peterson, Star Tribune (Minneapolis-St. Paul), May 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The flow of immigrants to Minnesota is quietly reaching record highs amid signs of what could prove to be a profound and lasting shift in their continents of origin.</p>
<p>For the first time ever, African nations are supplying more than half the state&rsquo;s legal immigrants. Four countries from that continent now stand atop the list.</p>
<p>Arrivals are doubling and quadrupling from countries such as Kenya and Liberia even as numbers are tapering off, for a variety of reasons, from past immigrant taproots such as India, Thailand and Russia, federal data show.</p>
<p>Africans say they are attracted here for the same reasons as others  &mdash;  quality of life, good schools for their kids  &mdash;  with the additional twist of Minnesota&rsquo;s reputation in parts of that continent as being receptive to immigrants with funny accents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At a time of severe job losses, the rise in the sheer number of immigrants, combined with their increasing likelihood of being black and Muslim, creates the conditions for a backlash.</p>
<p>But demographers are warning that Minnesotans should be grateful for anyone who chooses to plant stakes in the frozen north these days, at a time when Minnesota&rsquo;s population growth has slowed and dozens of its counties are slowly emptying.</p>
<p>The arrivals won&rsquo;t put a huge dent in the state&rsquo;s mostly European-origin demographics any time soon: We&rsquo;re still talking about 18,000 total immigrants counted last year in a state of 5.26 million. {snip}<br>

		<p>On Germany TV tomorrow there will be a big on hour reportage of the sense of aid money.</p>
<p>Some people of Europe argue that so much money didn&rsquo;t changed anything but only made the number of hungry people bigger.<br>
Some people of Africa argue that aid money only keeps Africa dependent on White Countries and help dictators remain power.</p>
<p>The interesting thing are the lefties and people from the aid organizations: <br>
They say without the money the humanitarian conditions in Africa will get unimaginable bad. NOTE: They do not say that with the money Africa maybe has a future. That lie was told too long. They only warn for the results of no aid.<br>
My personal opinion is that the aid agencies today are knowing that blacks will always be poor. They are there so long and nothing worked till today during at the same time Asia is getting richer and richer. They are just scared of consequences.</p>
<p>Speaking of Asians, I saw a report a week ago about Asians going for African land: A black man who had found a well paid work by the Chinese was shouting: &#8220;They disrespect our traditions because they only insure one kid of us, but we are in Africa and here the people have a lot of children. I have 8. Why do they disrespect our culture? Why don&rsquo;t they insure all my children.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Whites definitely need to start laying it all on the line or we have no future in this country. We have to be verbal, boycott products, don&rsquo;t serve in the military and most importantly, network for jobs and services. ..or we go down the tubes just like the bankers want us too. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m almost ashamed to say that my gene pool passed through Minnesota after leaving northern Europe.  I would hope that my ancestors would have been aghast at the African invasian of the land they settled and tamed.</p>
<p>What baffles me is why black Africans would choose to go there.  The northern mid-west is the diametric opposite of Africa climate-wise.  I can only assume that the Minnesotans provide a more inviting welfare environment than most places in the US.  If so, they&rsquo;ll soon deeply regret their generosity.</p>

		<p>This could be completely stopped and all those immigrants expunged (and it will still not be about race, lol) simply by cutting off welfare.  No welfare, no immigrants, legal, illegal, quasi-legal, whatever.  That&rsquo;s the bottom line.</p>
<p>Watch California carefully.  They are threatening to end all cash welfare if Obama doesn&rsquo;t send them billions of dollars immediately.  They say it has to be done to avoid rioting.  More likely, there will be no bailout and no rioting.  Instead, there will be a mass exodus of non-whites out of California.</p>
<p>But again, &#8220;it&rsquo;s not about race&#8221;.</p>
<p>California is on the cusp of showing the entire US something important about non-whites.  They are completely dependent on whites.  Stop feeding them and they vanish.  There is great potential here.  If every state does this, 30 years of non-white immigration could reverse itself in a very short period of time.</p>

		<p>If anyone who&rsquo;s White is still clueless as to why the U.S. Census has been asking all kinds of nosy, inappropriate, illegal, and un-Constitutional questions about &#8216;race&rsquo; for the last few census samplings, here is the reason why.</p>
<p>Our hostile, hate-filled, anti-white, white genocide consumed ruling elites are collecting statistical data on where whites are most heavily gathered in America, and they&rsquo;re deliberately and maliciously deciding to administer a diversity enema to those areas.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think of a better reason.  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not just Minnesota that&rsquo;s suffering from the influx of black Africans. Here on the Canadian prairies, it sometimes seems that they&rsquo;re more numerous than grasshoppers! And where I live, average monthly temperatures are below freezing for five months of the year, so don&rsquo;t expect cold weather to scare Somalis, Liberians, etc., away.</p>
<p>A colleague of mine told me that she did have a conversation with a Somali woman. This Somali woman said that she chose to come to Alberta because there were initially hardly any blacks. She refused to live in places where there were particularly high concentrations of blacks, such as Toronto. She was also afraid that too many Somalis were moving to Alberta, and she frankly acknowledged that this would lead to a lower quality of life (remember, she was a black woman). This woman was scornful of white people and western culture in general, saying that she wore an Islamic headscarf to shield herself from nasty white culture, but then in the next sentence, she complained that too many white people didn&rsquo;t want to be friendly to her and other Somalis!</p>
<p>But I have to wonder what will happen to these black Africans once the majority of white people move elsewhere? Alberta and Minnesota can be awfully cold places to live if you can&rsquo;t maintain power plants, central heating, and much more. Given what&rsquo;s happened to South Africa since the demise of white rule, it doesn&rsquo;t take a rocket scientist to figure out that blacks cannot manage to survive in cold climates all by themselves. Without whites, they have no chance.</p>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t Kennedy say this back in &#8216;65!</p>
<p>Africans say they are attracted here for the same reasons as others &mdash; quality of life, good schools for their kids &mdash; </p>
<p>Yeah right!!! They travel half way around the world from a tropical\desert environment to a place that gets mountains of snow and is bitterly cold, for its &#8220;quality of life&#8221; and &#8220;good schools&#8221;. Let&rsquo;s cut to the chase Mohammed - - Africans come here [ and all other White countries ] because Whites are soft touches. You know that Whitey will take care of your every need without you even having to work, and you intend to steal as much from Whitey for as long as you can. And by moving to a White country, you are automatically entitled to enter the ghetto lottery every time you experience &#8220;racisim&#8221;, something I&rsquo;m sure YOU&rsquo;LL see around every corner. I&rsquo;m sure your &#8220;African American&#8221; brothas will gladly show you what to look for if you have trouble finding any. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t these people understand that WHEREVER they are, there is no &#8220;quality of life&#8221; or &#8220;good schools&#8221;! Moving WILL NOT help! It&rsquo;s like trying to run from your shadow. </p>

Yes, but most of those 18,000 will concentrate into small areas of just a few cities, and quickly make them into reproductions of the sewer of a country they left. From there the infection spreads rapidly.</p>

		<p>The fact is, a critical mass of blacks is a recipe for disaster. They want to be a minority among whites, so that a majority of whites can absorb and mitigate their behavior.</p>

		<p>I would not be surprized that many of these Africans are able to come into this country because of the visa lottery. I once saw the list of countries that are eligible for the lottery. There were a lot of African countries listed. The only English speaking countries listed were Australia, New Zealand and Northern Ireland, which is the only part of the UK that is eligble for the lottery.</p>

		<p>The systems anti-white drive is in full tilt.  CNN is running a series on how children perceive race.  CNN and their cohorts think that it is their responsibility to delve into the thoughts of children and presumably make certain those thoughts are correct.  This is the exact contrary of the meaning of liberty, and freedom of conscience, which is exactly what the Founding Fathers were concerned with.</p>

		<p>The solution is simple.  </p>
<p>If the blacks speak with an accent it means they were imported.  Once a few come to an untimely demise Washington will get the message.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s either that or Minnesota will soon be overrun with African tribesmen.  </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget that not long ago the number of Mexican illegals started out small as well and now they number in the tens of millions.  </p>

The majority of the influx are Black. It is the latest Detroit.<br>
People I think just assume the Twin Cities are overwhelmingly white. It&rsquo;s not. It has become a very trendy place for blacks to move to. Lots move from Gary, Chicago, and Detroit.</p>

		<p>Just let our Minnesota friends keep us posted on how soon and how high local crime rates will rise. Thanks, of course, to the influx of African &#8220;immigrants.&#8221;</p>
<p>Locally, we noticed crime spike a few months after our idiot mayor invited NOLA refugeees here by the hundreds of thousands. Of course we understand the crime spike was just a coincidence&hellip; that it had absolutely nothing to do with the influx of several hundred thousand unemployable NOLA Blacks.</p>

		<p>  I&rsquo;m not at all surprised by this report. I went to Minneapolis fifteen years ago and I was astonished by the number of black Africans, mostly East Africans, working at the airport shops and food concession stands. Moreover, I had an African for a cab driver and noticed more than a few Somalis? milling around in Downtown Minneapolis. I guess Africans are attracted by the Scandinavian tolerance for minorities and abundant welfare in Minnesota. I think Minneapolis may resemble Chicago in the near future. </p>

		<p>If Minnesota truly needs more people, I am sure there are many thousands of White South Africans who would be anxious to seek asylum there from the horror that their country has become.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obvious all over the world: wherever Africans go, they bring Africa and its values (if you can call them that) with them.  Even their descendants in the US have now made our major cities look like parts of their &#8220;motherland&#8221;.  </p>
<p>WHY are they being allowed into our country while the whites of South Africa are being ignored and left to cope with a hateful and disintegrating environment?  They would be an asset instead of a liability.  It&rsquo;s obvious there is an agenda at work.</p>

<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know about that.  (What would tribal Africans know about Minnesota welfare policies and Scandinavian attitudes?) </p>
<p>Frankly, I think they are SENT there!!!  This is part of a deliberate agenda.  And it isn&rsquo;t an African-concocted  agenda!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about what is happening to America for quite a long time and the explanation that lately comes to my mind is the utopian spirit run wild.  I don&rsquo;t know what else can explain the obstinate propogation of absurd policies and ideas even in the face of catastropic consequences. I lived in Delaware, OH (close to Columbus, OH) and remember the Somalians and black Americans constantly at each other&rsquo;s throats.  I remember the proposed solution was to institute sensitivity training.  Here is an exceprt from Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels.  I think  in some respects it resembles what is going on in America:  </p>
<p>The sum of his discourse was to this effect: &#8220;That about forty years ago, certain persons went up to Laputa, either upon business or diversion, and, after five months continuance, came back with a very little smattering in mathematics, but full of volatile spirits acquired in that airy region: that these persons, upon their return, began to dislike the management of every thing below, and fell into schemes of putting all arts, sciences, languages, and mechanics, upon a new foot. To this end, they procured a royal patent for erecting an academy of projectors in Lagado; and the humour prevailed so strongly among the people, that there is not a town of any consequence in the kingdom without such an academy. In these colleges the professors contrive new rules and methods of agriculture and building, and new instruments, and tools for all trades and manufactures; whereby, as they undertake, one man shall do the work of ten; a palace may be built in a week, of materials so durable as to last for ever without repairing. All the fruits of the earth shall come to maturity at whatever season we think fit to choose, and increase a hundred fold more than they do at present; with innumerable other happy proposals. The only inconvenience is, that none of these projects are yet brought to perfection; and in the mean time, the whole country lies miserably waste, the houses in ruins, and the people without food or clothes. By all which, instead of being discouraged, they are fifty times more violently bent upon prosecuting their schemes, driven equally on by hope and despair</p>

		<p>Minnesota gets Africans because major parts of the American refugee racket are based there.</p>
<p>This problem won&rsquo;t go away until we demand the U.S. government end the visa lottery (which also brings in a lot of Africans) and stop accepting refugees. Congressman Goodlatte (R-VA) has tried several times to end the visa lottery, and has almost succeeded; don&rsquo;t say it can&rsquo;t be done.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The demographics of the Twin Cities have gone from roughly 95%<br>
white in the early 90&rsquo;s to just over 60% now.&#8221;</p>
<p> I think that many Americans still think of Minneapolis as it was during the Mary Tyler Moore Show &mdash; 95% white.  We can thank &ldquo;welcome diversity&rdquo; Liberals and greedy, cheap labor Neo-conservatives for ruining another great city.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The arrivals won&rsquo;t put a huge dent in the state&rsquo;s mostly European-origin demographics any time soon: We&rsquo;re still talking about 18,000 total immigrants counted last year in a state of 5.26 million.&#8221;</p>
<p>How many came the year before last and the year before that and so on and so forth?  In 1990, Minnesota was 94.4 percent White and in 2010 it was about 85 percent minus all the Mexicans they&rsquo;re counting as White.  That&rsquo;s a significant percentage drop in 20 years and extrapolated out to another 20 years it doesn&rsquo;t bode well for the future of the state.   </p>
<p>&#8220;But demographers are warning that Minnesotans should be grateful for anyone who chooses to plant stakes in the frozen north these days, at a time when Minnesota&rsquo;s population growth has slowed and dozens of its counties are slowly emptying.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why is slow population growth a bad thing?  We live in a finite world with limited resources and pressures on the environment caused by runaway population growth via immigration.  There were about 270 million Americans in 1990 compared with about 309 million in 2010.  Has all that extra population made the quality of life in this country better or worse?  </p>

		<p>And none of them go to the rich politicians gated hoods.  They dont get to reap what they have sewn for us.  Why not.  Isnt every right of an African the right of access into the bed of every white girl?  Isnt it good PR to have one of them people as an in-law so to morally profile as better than you?  Come on.  Where can I get one?</p>

		<p>Frankly, I think they are SENT there!!! This is part of a deliberate agenda. And it isn&rsquo;t an African-concocted agenda. Browser</p>
<p>  No doubt OUR government is very glad to send black refugees to mostly white cities, but chain migration is also involved. The current African residents write home to Somalia or Kenya and tell their numerous relatives about the easy pickings and laid back attitude of the dumb whites in Minnesota. The next thing you know they&rsquo;re coming by the thousands.</p>

		<p>This was started back in the fifties and mores and sixties It was part and parcel to the &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; program. One of the people leading the charge for civil rights was Minn. Senator Hubert Humphrey. Of course at the time the prime targets were the southern states. I wonder if Humphrey or a candidate with his ideas could get elected in Minn. now that they have experienced a taste of diversity.</p>

		<p>Brendan is correct.  A good number is from the refugee program sponsored by your government with your tax dollars.  For more info go to groups like Episcopal Migration Ministries and Catholic Charities.  They are not even meeting their maximum quotas.</p>

<p>We only paid for 75,000 to come in 2009.  But that&rsquo;s OK - we are a nation of 300 million - just a drop in the bucket:<br>
