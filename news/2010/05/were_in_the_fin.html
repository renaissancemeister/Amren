<h1><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article7116332.ece">&#8216;We&rsquo;re in the Final Days of White Life in South Africa&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jonathan Clayton, Times of London, May 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The gunman leant forward and pushed the pistol hard into Manie Potgieter&rsquo;s neck. &#8220;Listen, you white bastard,&#8221; he whispered, his breath heavy with alcohol. &#8220;I have Aids. We are now going to rape your wife and give her Aids too. Then, we kill you, got it?&#8221;</p>
<p>From his position on the floor, hands tied behind his back, he could hear his assailant&rsquo;s three accomplices pulling the tracksuit bottoms off his wife, Helena, 28.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was sure they were going to shoot me, but I just prayed she would be OK. She was telling me in Afrikaans not to worry. I just prayed,&#8221; Mr Potgieter, 30, a blond giant of a man, told The Times.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a clang of metal echoed through the early morning air  &mdash;  and the attackers took fright. They had been in the remote farmhouse for an hour and dawn was fast approaching. &#8220;Let&rsquo;s go, someone is coming,&#8221; one of them shouted in panic. Without firing a shot they were suddenly gone.</p>
<p>The Potgieters&rsquo; nightmare was over  &mdash;  but it was one of the very few happy endings to a spate of attacks on South Africa&rsquo;s white Afrikaner farming communities in which an estimated 3,000 people have been killed since 1994.</p>
<p>On another farm, a few miles away, Louis Boshoff, 65, and his wife, Elsabe, 57, were not so lucky. A few months ago, Mr Boshoff arose early one morning, as he has done for almost 47 years, to milk his small dairy herd.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two men were hiding in one of the outdoor sheds. They had balaclavas on and came at me. One had a gun and the other a catapult with ball bearings as shot,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>When one of them fired at his barking dogs, Mr Boshoff saw red and tried to rush them, but he was shot twice. He lost his spleen, most of his pancreas and half his liver. His wife rushed to be at his side, tripped and suffered a broken leg.</p>
<p>The subject of attacks on white farmers is deeply disliked by the ruling African National Congress for the unflattering comparisons that it brings with neighbouring Zimbabwe, but it has come to the fore since the murder of the white supremacist leader Eug√®ne Terre&rsquo;Blanche a month ago. That incident followed a sharp deterioration in race relations after Julius Malema, the outspoken leader of the ANC&rsquo;s Youth League, started singing at rallies an old anti-apartheid struggle song that includes the words &#8220;shoot the boer [farmer]&#8221;.</p>
<p>The High Court banned the song but the ruling is now under appeal. Mr Malema faces an ANC disciplinary hearing after he defied orders and continued to sing the song while visiting Zimbabwe, where he praised President Mugabe for land reform policies, under which 4,000 white commercial farmers have been driven off the land in the past decade.</p>
<p>Since Terre&rsquo;Blanche&rsquo;s murder the farm attacks have continued unabated. Last week another two white farmers were killed in separate attacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;The murder of TB [Terre&rsquo;Blanche] was planned. They start singing &#8216;kill the boer&rsquo;  &mdash;  then the most famous boer of the lot is murdered. I did not support him, but do not tell me it is not linked,&#8221; said Ian Bothma, 47, a tradesman from Terre&rsquo;Blanche&rsquo;s home town who has recently applied to emigrate to Australia. &#8220;We are now in the final days of white life in this country.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Government points out that blacks are also the targets of farm attacks; black unions, for their part, emphasise that, 16 years after the end of apartheid, many black farm workers are still ill treated, with their white employers accused of fuelling the violence by paying derisory wages and using illegal migrant labour.</p>
<p>At the root of the problem is the Government&rsquo;s failure to carry out land reforms that meet black aspirations without destroying the productive agricultural sector. It wants at least one third of productive farm land to be in black hands by 2014 but is way off target. The land bank set up to finance farm purchases is broke; fleeced by its own managers, with a corruption investigation under way.</p>
<p>Andre Botha, chairman of Agriculture South Africa&rsquo;s rural safety committee, told parliament recently that the biggest challenge facing the industry was &#8220;irresponsible remarks&#8221; by officials and politicians. &#8220;If we are excluded from being South African then there is a big question mark put on democracy,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Last week, President Zuma promised that there would be no Zimbabwean-style land grabs  &mdash;  but most whites are not convinced. &#8220;I was born and bred here but it is time to go,&#8221; Mr Bothma said. &#8220;It is unfair to inflict such a future on our children.&#8221;</p>
<p><big><b>S<small>IDEBAR:</small> Land in Crisis</b></big></p>
<p>40,000 farmers in South Africa</p>
<p>3,000 farmers murdered since the end of apartheid</p>
<p>800,000 white South Africans out of a total of 4.4 million have emigrated since 1995</p>
<p>200,000 hectares of abandoned farmland has been leased by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo to farmers fleeing South Africa</p>

<p>30% of land must be in black hands by 2014, if government targets for land reform are to be met</p>
<p>2% of land has changed hands so far, with funds for further purchases having dried up and a corruption inquiry under way</p>
<p>20% of South Africans of all races want to emigrate, with 95 per cent of those naming violent crime as the single most important factor<br>

		<p>Whites were ~20% of the population of South Africa in 1904 (500,000 out of a total of 2.5M). Today they are ~10% (4.5M out of a total population of 47M).  In the last 100 years, the white population has multiplied by a factor of 9, whereas the non-white population has multiplied by a factor of 19.  I too would like to see demographic statistics from 1960 to the present to highlight the actual or percieved decline in the White population of South Africa, but doubt we will ever see such information in the main stream public media.</p>

<p>In other words, some white farmers are still helping to bring in more blacks, as if there weren&rsquo;t enough already.  </p>

		<p><em>At the root of the problem is the Government&rsquo;s failure to carry out land reforms that meet black aspirations without destroying the productive agricultural sector.</em></p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t be done.  The South African government recently acknowledged that 90% of the land so far transferred to black owners has been a failure.</p>
<p>In any event, that is not the root of the problem. These murders would still continue, even if they transferred all the land to blacks.  It&rsquo;s a simple matter of race hatred.  Always was. </p>

		<p>   There is an undercurrent of absolute fear among whites in SA. I trevolves around the death of Mandela.Supposedly when that elderly man dies, there is to be a wholesale slaughter of whites.The indifferent corrupt government will not be able to stop it. I have a thought that is pure wishful thinking.If Australia would take in the whites then millions would be saved. And to boot it would stop Australia&rsquo;s deep slide into non-white anarchy. Win Win.</p>

<p>You are quite correct.  The leftists are fudging the numbers to downplay the seriousness of the situation.  No surprise there, since leftists are famous for such things.</p>

		<p>What gary mentions here is actually called Uhuru. The night of the long knives. When the terrorist Mandela eventually pops his clogs the blacks will apparently come out in force and mass murder whites. Thats the general idea atleast.</p>
<p>We whites call the upcoming battle with another name though. Blood River 2. I am one of those South African Boers that will not go quietly into the night. However, I am also not willing to throw my life away without proper cause. South African whites are not scared to death, as Gary suggest, but merely biding our time. We must chose our battles carefully in order to win the war.</p>
<p>Those pleas you see on Praag and other Afrikaner sites are not to save us by letting us emigrate and only emigrate. No, they are a plea for sanity in a world where lunacy rules. They serve as a warning to all whites and also serve to hopefully wake a few right leaning liberals up from their multicult slumber. Remeber, this is not only a fight for Boers but for all whites. We need your help, not only to emigrate if the need arises, but also to be able to stay in the land of our birth.</p>
<p>Thanks CSA</p>

		<p>Alas, the fact that the slow genocide of whites in South Africa has failed to spark much interest in America or the European homelands will come back to haunt us in the near future. I just don&rsquo;t see much of a future for whites in South Africa, and unless things change, I don&rsquo;t think there will be much of a future for whites in America or most of Western Europe either.   </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a public school teacher in the Northeast and I&rsquo;m constantly talking up the genocide against the Boers in SA. Most of the time I get a condescending nod of the head and then an abrupt change of the subject. Nobody gives a rat&rsquo;s ass. <br>
I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;ll take to get these people fired up. I even sent them links from the online editions from the Knoxville papers re.the Christian/ Newsome atrocities and never get an acknowledgment that they&rsquo;ve gotten them.</p>

		<p>The general disintegration of the new SA is to be expected, following as it does the pattern of just about the rest of post-colonial Africa. Despite the utter failure the liberal formula of one-man-one-vote, liberals in the West refuse to learn the lesson. It is one more demonstration of the entrenched ideological brainlock on the Western world, since most conservatives buy into the liberal view on race. </p>
<p>A real issue that ought to be studied is how liberal ideology can be shattered. That is a prerequisite to any kind of defense of European-Western peoples. </p>
