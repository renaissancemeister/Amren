			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joel Millman, Wall Street Journal, May 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nowadays, [Cajun] history is often taught by newcomers from Africa. Someone like Cyran Hounnou. He teaches seventh grade at the Moss Bluff Middle School near Lake Charles, La. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;They [the English] said, &#8216;Be Protestant, not Catholic,&#8221;&rsquo; Mr. Hounnou, 47, continued. &#8220;The Acadians wouldn&rsquo;t. So they were deported. What they called Le Grand Dérangement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Hounnou speaks English, French and Spanish, he says, and &#8220;about seven&#8221; of the 32 tribal languages of Bénin, his West African homeland. This talented teacher and dozens more from West Africa form a veritable French Foreign Legion of imported educators here. They join staff from Canada, Haiti, Belgium and France itself, as Louisiana&rsquo;s present-day Acadians  &mdash;  the &#8220;Cajuns&#8221;  &mdash;  struggle to preserve a language languishing on the Bayou.</p>
<p>Educationally, it&rsquo;s one of Louisiana&rsquo;s proudest achievements, using French immersion to rescue a culture that teetered near extinction 30 years ago. {snip}</p>
<p>Calcasieu Parish, which includes Moss Bluff where Mr. Hounnou teaches, battled parents for weeks over a proposal to end French immersion there. The school board&rsquo;s budget committee voted May 4 to block cuts in the French program, to the relief of pro-French partisans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Initially, there was resistance by some Cajuns to African educators, who were often the first blacks to teach in rural schools. Today&rsquo;s parents take a broader view. &#8220;It&rsquo;s expanded his horizons, having an African teacher,&#8221; says Mrs. Comeaux.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Native teachers are scarce in the immersion programs. Of the 11 working in the schools of St. Martin Parish  &mdash;  considered Cajun country&rsquo;s epicenter  &mdash;  only one was born in Louisiana. The others are from France, Canada and Belgium. Both Belgians were born in Africa  &mdash;  one in Cameroon, the other in Senegal.</p>
<p>A state agency, the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana, or Codofil, handles overseas recruitment. Codofil petitions Washington for temporary work visas to cover 3-year contracts for about 130 imported teachers annually. Top teachers, like Mr. Hounnou, may be asked by their school boards to stay, and eventually earn green cards.</p>
<p>{snip} Louisiana offers Africans good pay and benefits, and a path to U.S. citizenship.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>These days there are Africans from Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso and Mali teaching in mostly white, Cajun classrooms. And Africans are teaching black students with French-speaking ancestors.</p>
<p>Some Africans say they see their own ancestors&rsquo; features in the faces of local African-Americans. {snip}</p>
<p>Others taste their homeland in Louisiana cuisine. &#8220;Le gumbó. It&rsquo;s like what we eat in Africa,&#8221; Odile Mobé, a Cameroonian teaching in New Iberia, says with a laugh. Bibá Idé, a teacher from Niger working in Jefferson Davis Parish, notes another similarity: &#8220;Here, it&rsquo;s a feast with a pig. We do a lamb or a cow. But we call it the same thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 2000 Census counted just 198,000 Francophones in Louisiana  &mdash;  a 20% drop from 1990. With many French speakers well past retirement age, it is expected the 2010 Census will reveal an even smaller Francophone minority. Francophiles hope an uptick will emerge after 2020, when today&rsquo;s students start heading households.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s all about spreading French culture,&#8221; Mr. Hounnou says. &#8220;Remember: No matter how big or great a country you are, you still need small peoples to help.&#8221;<br>

		<p>These Africans they&rsquo;re hiring may speak French, but isn&rsquo;t that about the extent of their &#8220;Cajun-ness&#8221;? How exactly are they suitable to teach Cajuns about Cajun history and culture? I think that they most certainly are not suitable for the job.</p>

		<p>The Acadians [Cajuns] are not able to import talent from Quebec to the extent that they would like?</p>
<p>Of course there are the Haitians. But they speak Creole? NOT totally French? Just not sure.</p>

		<p>Instead of &#8216;French culture&rsquo; I predict they will simply receive Marxist indoctrination writ large, considering the national origins of the teachers.</p>

		<p>What an example of gross leftist hypocrisy. &#8220;Skin color doesn&rsquo;t matter, except when it serves the left&rsquo;s purposes. Black Africans brought into New Orleans are thought to somehow boost Cajun culture  &mdash;  even though their cultures have absolutely nothing in common (despite silly claims that gumbo is like what they eat in Africa). Why? Simply because of their skin color. Yet when whites on the right say that skin color matters, they&rsquo;re called &#8220;racist.&#8221; There&rsquo;s no end to leftist hypocrisy.</p>

		<p>These folks are not teaching black kids but for the most part white kids. They are passing on the morality of hard work, educational effort and family responsibility. Like all Africans I`ve known they think African Americans are lazy, criminal, immoral, and stupid. Soon I predict the NAACP will start attemting to strip this program. What a racist idea for New Orleans black men to study, marry the mother of their first child, and obey the law.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a Cajun descendent living outside of Louisiana. As previously stated, these Africans are no more suited to teach Cajun than the Chinese.  They are really just teaching rudimentary French.  Cajun, although derived from 17th Century French, is a separate language.  It is not the same language spoken in Canada, France or Africa; it is not Creole or Hatian.  When my grandmother traveled to France, she said the southern French thought she was from the North and the northern French thought she was from the South.  Cajun is obviously very similar to French, but it is a separate language.  The Africans are only teaching basic French to children whose ancestors were probably English.  This appears to be just another left-wing Third-World immigration tactic.</p>
<p>By the way, my grandparents refused to allow my mother to learn Cajun or French.  In the 1950&rsquo;s speaking with a Cajun accent was considered low-class.  My mother was the first of her family to go to college.  Although I appreciate a love for our history, it&rsquo;s probably time for Cajuns   &mdash;   like the Irish, the Italians, and other fringe European groups in America   &mdash;   to assimilate and just become Americans like the rest of the European people living here. </p>

		<p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s expanded his horizons, having an African teacher,&rdquo; says Mrs. Comeaux.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to bet that this is not all that they have expanded.  How many of these African teachers are females(what, African children have no need for them)? </p>
<p>But as #2 asks; How is it that there were no Quebecois available to teach?  Certainly, they speak a dialect of French closer to Cajun than any African Francophone.  It just looks like another corrupt immigration program that uses Cajun culture concerns as a means for injecting yet more racial &#8220;Diversity&#8221; into Cajuns, who are of white, European ancestry.  </p>
<p>As an American who is Quebecois just two generations ago, I see this as just another prong into white, European identity.  And it is so devious in its pretense of preservation of a culture while it literally seeks to sow the seeds of its undoing.</p>

		<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not Cajun.  But I know that there is vastly more to being Acadian than speaking French. Come to think of it, Acadians came from Brittany, where (until they were forced to change) the population spoke an insular Celtic language. And Acadian French (as well as that of Montreal) is quite different from what these African teachers are likely to be speaking.  There are plenty of recordings of Cajun French to learn from.  </p>
<p>A couple of years back, an Acadian poster here basically stated that the first group to do anything more than exploit her group were the Americans.  Today, Cajuns are extremely American, and a treasured component of our national culture. They are naturally a perfect fit. That&rsquo;s because they have their roots in Western France (right across the Channel from England), and in Native American tribes. You can&rsquo;t get much more American than that. I see nothing to be gained from their being taught &#8216;Cajun-ness&rsquo; by Africans.</p>
<p>I suspect this importation of teachers has something to do with Lafayette&rsquo;s (admittedly wonderful) &#8216;Festival International de Louisiane&rsquo;, which has bands from all over the francophone world.  Unfortunately, those exotic francophones came, saw, and liked. Acadiana is heaven to some of us, and I can&rsquo;t blame them.  But you can&rsquo;t be taught the subtleties of a rare culture by someone not of that culture.  And Acadian, as with all Celtic cultures, is about things which cannot be codified or put into words.  Acadian, in my opinion, is the best of all Celtic cultures, and is a treasure too precious to risk by this educational experiment.</p>

<p>So the next time I get one of those emails from Nigeria I should trust the offer and give them my money because they are so much more trustworthy than American Blacks?</p>
<p>Your post is simply a comedy to me.<br>
