			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rapid City Journal (South Dakota), April 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>School officials in Chamberlain are investigating an incident in which six high school students wore homemade T-shirts proclaiming &#8220;White Pride World Wide.&#8221;</p>
<p>A derogatory slang term for impoverished white people also was on the back of each shirt, along with a symbol often used by white supremacists. On the front of the shirts was the word &#8220;Peace&#8221; and a peace sign.</p>
<p>Superintendent of Schools Tim Mitchell says officials are looking into why the students made the shirts. He says they violated the school&rsquo;s dress policy. Two of the students changed their shirts and the other four left school.</p>
<p>One of them, 16-year-old Codie Novotny, says the shirts were a response to accusations by some American Indian students that white students and teachers are racist. She also says Indian students are allowed to wear clothing proclaiming &#8220;Native Pride.&#8221;<br>

		<p>These White students are the new heroes in our struggle to regain our sanity and human and civil rights in our own White Republic.</p>
<p>Wolf Blizter made a fool of himself talking about civil rights struggle &#8220;godmother&#8221; Dorothy Height being a &#8220;wonderful, wonderful, wonderful woman who did some much for this country!&#8221;</p>
<p>I call upon Wolf to mention the names of all the White Girls robbed, raped, and murdered by Dorothy Height&rsquo;s &#8220;community&#8221; while he is praising her for being so wonderful.  What wonders did she work on the black thugs to keep them from killing our beautiful White daughters?  What did she ever do to reduce black on white crime, black out of wedlock births, and black drug crime?  She got a state funeral in the National Cathedral for doing nothing but taking advantage of White&rsquo;s genetic defect of &#8220;loving the stranger before loving yourself&#8221; suicide mission.</p>
<p>Reality will force MSM into increasing the absurd worship of the civil rights &#8220;icons&#8221; and &#8220;pioneers&#8221; as this whole house of lies burns before their very eyes.  They will call us racists just for looking at the fire when we were instead supposed to admit our responsibility for it and throw ourselves upon it as an offering to Diversity.</p>
<p>Back in the 1960&rsquo;s, White America didn&rsquo;t riot against the Kerner Commission Report, but today, now that we know the blacks never were really decent, smart, civilized Whites with black skin, we won&rsquo;t take it anymore, and the Establishment knows it.  They will become harsher on us and more lavish on their afro pets.</p>
<p>Soon, masses of Whites will be shaken to their cores and reconnect with their God given sensibility through the best medicine ever invented- RACE REALITY.</p>
<p>We praise and adore White Cotie Novotny, that wonderful, wonderful, wonderful White girl who is doing so much for this White Republic.  </p>

		<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;along with a symbol often used by white supremacists.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>And what mystical and deadly &#8220;symbol&#8221; might <i>that</i> be?  I think the idea here is to leave the reader with the impression that it was a swastika.</p>
<p>Interesting, though, to see more and more little incidents like these popping up.  It&rsquo;s enough to make one wonder how many are being kept quiet by our ever-alert governmedia.  Tip of the iceberg, perhaps?<br>

		<p>Great to see some White youths addressing the racial hypocrisy.  This situation reminds me of one in my workplace about five years ago.  A Black woman on her first day working at our office, came in with a tee shirt proclaiming, &#8220;There&rsquo;s nothing in the world I would rather be, than a Black woman&#8221;.  I can only imagine the reaction had I worn a tee shirt expressing my same feeling about being a White man.</p>

		<p>According to this website, the &#8220;derogatory&#8221; name was &#8220;cracker&#8221; (which I guessed) and the symbol was a celtic cross (I knew it was not a swastika or they would have said so).</p>

		<p>WELL WHAT ABOUT NATIVE PRIDE SHIRTS?</p>
<p>The parents should show up at school board meetings with White Pride shirts and should visit the principal with a White Pride shirt.  These insults against us must be challenged.</p>
