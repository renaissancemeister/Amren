			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jamie Smyth, Irish Times (Dublin), May 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>MINISTER OF State for Equality and Integration Mary White has vowed to root out &#8220;pockets&#8221; of racism in society and called for a radical reform of the asylum system.</p>
<p>She has also pledged to tackle rising discrimination against minority groups during the recession  &mdash;  a downturn she believes could, in the long-term, make Ireland a nicer place to live.</p>
<p>In her first major interview since being appointed, Ms White said she had no doubt &#8220;there were pockets of Ireland where racism rears its ugly head&#8221; and she would do everything she could to support people to embrace multiculturalism.</p>
<p>&#8220;While I am Minister in this brief I don&rsquo;t want any covert or overt racism, whether its awful graffiti spray painted on walls or whether its the nudge, nudge, wink, wink in the place of work or in the school yard.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to be absolutely clear in our hearts and our minds that there is absolutely no place for racism and xenophobia in this country,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Ms White said the legal system would decide what happened in the case of the recent killing of 15-year-old Nigerian schoolboy Toyosi Shittabey, who was stabbed to death in Tyrrelstown  &mdash;  an area with many immigrants.</p>
<p>She said she had spoken to many of Toyosi&rsquo;s school friends, who were traumatised by his death and she promised to speak out against racism at every opportunity.</p>
<p>Ms White said she would travel around the country to speak to migrants, to hear their concerns as part of a new ministerial council on integration. She plans to set up a new integration taskforce, which will include Irish representatives, to consider how to better deliver services to immigrants. A third body of academic and Civil Service experts will sit on an integration commission to consider all aspects of integration, she added.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a good listener. I want to hear their voices,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Ms White also hoped the Government would overhaul its asylum system and extend the right to work to asylum seekers awaiting a decision on their cases.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would certainly like asylum seekers to be able to work. The Government position is that this is not tenable at the current time but I&rsquo;m hoping that during the report at committee stage of the new immigration Bill that we may see some positive changes. That&rsquo;s a personal view,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice argues that giving the right to work to people seeking asylum would encourage bogus asylum seekers to come to Ireland.</p>
<p>It is likely to strongly oppose any amendments to the new Bill proposing to allow asylum seekers to work. Ms White said she recognised the huge frustration felt by asylum seekers who have to wait sometimes up to six years for decisions. She said there was a need to cut back on the timescale so asylum cases could be heard fairly, speedily and justly.</p>
<p>Ms White also criticised rules in direct provision hostels for asylum seekers, which prevent families preparing food in their rooms and close kitchens in hostels outside of designated meal times.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like more flexibility in kitchen opening hours. I know the rule about food in rooms, which may be a health and safety issue. But children don&rsquo;t feed on demand,&#8221; said Ms White, who added strict rules put additional stress on families at the centres.</p>
<p>Ms White said the issues at the heart of her new job  &mdash;  social inclusion and equality  &mdash;  were close to &#8220;core Green principles&#8221; and denied Fianna FÃ¡il had ridden roughshod over the Green Party over the last three years.</p>
<p>She said &#8220;Green handprints&#8221; promoting equality were all over the revised programme for government, which was negotiated during tough economic times.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to make sure no one suffers because we are in hard times,&#8221; said Ms White, who noted a big increase in racial and gender-based discrimination cases heard recently at the Equality Tribunal.</p>
<p>She said she agreed with people who said Ireland would be a nicer place to live after this recession because people now value basic qualities of life rather than money.</p>
<p>&#8220;The uncertainty out there means people are focusing on the basic qualities of life .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. people have time to talk to each other.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will be a fitter country because people are exercising and more people are volunteering,&#8221; she said.<br>

		<p>She said all the Right Things.  Too bad we can&rsquo;t investigate her for White Privilege and prove that in her choices of lifestyle, she would make any of us proud.  She probably has White parents, attended White schools, has a White mate, works for a White boss, stays away from non White neighborhoods, unless she&rsquo;s giving a speech and has bodyguards.</p>
<p><br>
These are the worst people in the world, they are White, and deserve the worst ends of the Multicult Curse immaginable.  I applaud her coming desolation.</p>

		<p>A well-traveled friend of mine once told me that I shouldn&rsquo;t be too concerned about anything that comes out of Ireland. He said this remarkable statement when I asked about some hard-to-believe news such as the above. He said that all of the intelligent Irish people left when the famine ( actually a British campaign of starvation )hit. He said that only the dummies stayed. He also said that most Irishmen who are honest would concur. I hate to say it, but it seems that only a truly stupid people could be led around the yard by the nose like they are.</p>

		<p>I found myself stirred by this wonderful woman&rsquo;s desire to root out racism wherever it may have taken root.  Toward that end I recommend that we export a million blacks and an equal number of Hispanics to the Emerald Isle to serve as racism detectors, helping to root out every last vestige of racism among the Irish.<br>
The problem is that the Irish haven&rsquo;t been sufficiently exposed to certain minorities in order to fully reveal their latent racism. This fearless initiative would ensure that any such latent racist instincts are fully revealed.</p>

Once blacks move in, everything has to change to accommodate them.</p>
<p>The Irish will learn the hard lesson of allowing blacks to move to their country; that it&rsquo;s won&rsquo;t be their country much longer.</p>

		<p>IRELAND (nation of fools)?</p>
<p>That is rich.  In the 1850 during the Great Famine where millions of Irish died of starvation, the other Irish who were living high on the hog did not lift a finger to help their fellow countrymen.  So many Irish were forced to leave, that the population of Ireland today is less than it was in the 1800s.  Ireland is the only nation to suffer famine that never recovered and its been over 100 years.  Today most of Ireland is owned by foreigners.  <br>

		<p>If they were really concerned about racism they would act to keep other races out of Ireland, instead of really only being concerned, seemingly, with browbeating other whites. Something which is itself a form of &#8216;racism&rsquo; I suppose.  </p>

		<p>I was in Dublin in December/January 2009-10 - I hardly saw an Irish face. The city was full of foreigners and begging Gypsies, no Irish people working in hotels at all and plenty of unemployed young Irishmen hanging around.</p>
<p>Maybe thats what she means by doing &#8216;everything she could to support people to embrace multiculturalism&rsquo;. </p>

		<p>What bothers me is the lack of outrage on the part of my fellow Irish Americans. We supported the cause of Irish nationalism when it came to the North of Ireland, but Ireland today is being overrun and ruined by third world immigration. Have we learned nothing from what we&rsquo;ve seen here? </p>

		<p>&#8220;Ireland&rsquo;s Minister of State for Equality and Integration won&rsquo;t stand for any &ldquo;covert or overt racism.&rdquo; </p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t matter what he won&rsquo;t stand for, because Ireland&rsquo;s economy is just as bad as Greece&rsquo;s and the world is watching and waiting for them to crash and burn any day now.</p>
<p>As with Greece, there will be draconian cuts clear to the bone on everything, which means these nonsense jobs like &#8220;Equality and Integration,&#8221; will be first on the chopping block.  Next will be street riots as in Greece for cut backs in pensions, payments social services and a longer work week among many other things.</p>
<p>If Ireland wants any of the stimulus money contributed by the EU, then they will be FORCED to invoke these austerity measures or they&rsquo;ll get nothing and they&rsquo;ll collapse.  They, like Greece, will choose to accept cutbacks.</p>
<p>Next will come street protests over attempts at putting unqualified immigrants in the few jobs available, plus an attempt will be made to continue giving them benefits, but much smaller in size while the citizens will get nothing.</p>
<p>Like Italy, the Irish will be outraged to see themselves put at the back of the line while illiterate blacks, and Arabs, are given preferences and there will eventually be violence against all immigrants and immigration in general, also just as is occurring now in Italy, which, incidentally, is set to get much, much more violent.</p>
<p>And finally, Ireland will run out of stimulus money the same as Spain, Portugal, Italy and the UK, and everyone of those countries will collapse economically and there will be large scale fighting from one end of Europe to the other, with Germany and France entering the fray sometime after the other nations.</p>
<p>Eastern Europe will have fallen in severe economic times, even worse than the West at some point in all this mayhem, but being more homogeneous they will probably have far less street violence.  France&rsquo;s large Arab and black populations will make a wreck of the country which will take decades to repair.</p>
<p>This is what the arrogant Irish minister has in store for himself, his country, and his continent.  Above all, if I were him I wouldn&rsquo;t act and speak in such an arrogant manner, because when the Irish get their &#8220;Irish&#8221; up they have a tendency to start fighting and forget to quit.  </p>

		<p>For 3 hundred years the Irish resisted England&rsquo;s attempt to destroy their culture, and make them English. They suffered pain and poverty, and eventually regained their independence. Now in a few decades Liberalism has acheived the goal that eluded England: It has turned the Irish into Liberals, and destroyed Irish culture.</p>
<p>This illustrates that Ireland is demented. But is there any European-White country that is still sane? Perhaps Russia and some of the former communist block countries are rational, but how long will they remain normal. </p>

<p>This is correct. Ireland is the ONLY place on the planet where the population is LESS now than it was 100 or so years ago.</p>
<p>Keep Ireland for the Irish. ONLY Irish in Ireland. NO diversity is what they need.</p>
<p>This making a pact with the devil [EU] means that now Ireland MUST accept a certain number of &#8220;refugees&#8221; and migrants per year. They HAVE made a pact with the devil and will regret it.</p>

<p>This is another fine example of the kind of thinking that Western liberals profess to abhor; it&rsquo;s absolutely dogmatic, absolutely intolerant of any disagreement, absolutely fanatical, absolutely self-righteous, and absolutely absolutist. </p>
<p>In any context other than race, Mary White would be mocked and berated as a Nazi or a fundamentalist wacko. </p>

		<p>If non-Whites would not have been allowed residence in ireland, this &#8216;racism&rsquo; problem would never have reared its ugly head ever. The best solution to racism in Europe is to keep it 100% genetically European, it is as simple as that.</p>

		<p>I see that Ireland is marching triumphantly down the road to multicultural diversity, and the Irish can look forward to a more vibrant society, with riots and demands for sharia law. John (at #5) has pointed out that the US can help a lot. My country - Australia - could only send a few Islamic extremists, but every little bit helps!</p>

The only time she referred to the actual Irish people is when she was basically threatening them if they don&rsquo;t abide by her glorious agenda which they never asked for anyway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While I am Minister in this brief I don&rsquo;t want any covert or overt racism, whether its awful graffiti spray painted on walls or whether its the nudge, nudge, wink, wink in the place of work or in the school yard.</p>
<p>Is she going to have a large-scale anit-racism para-military taskforce going from house to house? What a complete vacant-headed fool.</p>

		<p>  Ireland was conquered for 700 years. Amere 70 years after getting it&rsquo;s independence; eire is throwing it all away on the altar of political correctness. Hooray for the bozo ruling elite. A finer bunch of &#8216;eejits were never had.</p>

		<p>Mary White&hellip;..now that&rsquo;s a telling name.  I bet she hates the sound of it though, from what I&rsquo;ve gathered from reading the article.  Of course now maybe she&rsquo;s had a wee bit of the poitin(Moonshine)aned its addled her brains.  I&rsquo;d like to think that she is in the minority in her thinking but I&rsquo;m not too sure of that anymore after reading some current issues of the Irish American Newspaper here in the Windy City.  Some of their columnists seem to be very, very much to the Left, especially one &#8216;man of the cloth&rsquo; who cannot keep himself from hoping that America will someday make citizens of the over 12-20 million illegals that have invaded our country.  You would think that after the downturn of the economy in Ireland that they would not want to welcome more of the third world into their country but just take care of their own but I guess that would make too much sense.  </p>

		<p>You cannot have &#8220;racism&#8221; without different races living together. In homogenous nations, the problem of &#8220;racism&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>I find it fascinating that so many anti-racists keep on pushing for open borders and &#8220;diversity.&#8221; Yet, what they fail to realize is that more &#8220;diversity&#8221; results in more &#8220;racism.&#8221; </p>
<p>As long as there is &#8220;diversity,&#8221; there will always be racial conflict and tension. Therefore, when someone wants to push for racial diversity because it will result in a more tolerant and harmonious society, that is a lie. All they want to do is eliminate whites, and replace one form of intolerance with another. </p>
<p>When will whites worldwide finally wake up?</p>

		<p>What did Ireland ever do to deserve diversity? She never enslaved other races, held no empire, committed no genocide. These are excuses for destroying the larger Western countries   &mdash;   the USA, UK, France, Germany and more. Yet transformation is imposed on ALL Western countries, large and small, and only Western countries.</p>
<p>Despite historic cultural ties to the UK, US, and indeed all English-speaking countries, Ireland ignores their awful examples and heeds traitors like this Mary White. How relatively intact white lands like Ireland, Finland, Maine or Idaho NEVER seem to learn from other whites who&rsquo;ve already imbibed PC multiculturalism&rsquo;s poison just baffles. </p>
<p>To chime in with other commentators, embracing the tragedy of diversity mocks Ireland&rsquo;s whole independence struggle. Why did their forbears bother? Was it all a joke? Every white should ponder why our ancestors left us the West&rsquo;s glorious heritage. Was generations of blood, sweat and tears really all so we could dispossess ourselves and join the Third World in just one generation?</p>
<p>WHAT is our mental illness? Is death the only cure? Here is a poem I found at the Garden of Remembrance, Independence Memorial in Dublin:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We Saw a Vision</p>
<p>In the darkness of despair, we saw a vision. We lit the light of hope. And it was not extinguished. In the desert of discouragement, we saw a vision. We planted the tree of valor. And it blossomed.</p>
<p>In the winter of bondage, we saw a vision. We melted the snow of lethargy. And the river of resurrection flowed from it. </p>
<p>We sent our vision aswim like a swan on the river. The vision became a reality. Winter became summer. Bondage became freedom. And this we left to you as your inheritance.</p>
<p>O generations of freedom remember us, the generations of the vision.&rdquo;<br>

<p>You are exactly right!   Very well put.  They push for more &#8220;Diversity&#8221; so they can  then push  for more &#8220;anti-racism&#8221; legislation  to fight &#8220;white supremecy&#8221; and &#8220;white racism&#8221;    &mdash;   which would not even exist if there were no  &#8220;Diversity&#8221; and multiculturalism to begin with.  If they really wanted a &#8220;more tolerant and harmonious society&#8221; they would have left well enough alone and kept their homogeneity as it was. If it&rsquo;s worked well over the centuries, why tamper with it now?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all an excuse to attack and stigmatize whites.  And ultimately replace them.</p>
<p>Those who push this lame-brained line of idealistic nonsense are either supremely cynical and hypocrital,  or just fuzzy minded and haven&rsquo;t really thought it through.  (I&rsquo;d put the leaders in the first category, and the followers in the second.)</p>

It&rsquo;s not fascinating, they only want to keep their jobs. ;-)<br>
Most people who work for anti-racism foundation, welfare offices and &#8220;studies about racism&#8221; would be jobless in China, Japan or South Korea. The more immigrants, the safer their job - until the collapse. <br>
