<h1>Blacks Lose Suits on Fire Exams</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dan Herbeck, Buffalo News, May 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>U. S. District Judge John T. Curtin this week issued orders dismissing legal challenges filed by the Men of Color Helping All Society, a group of African-American Buffalo firefighters.</p>
<p>The society claims that the exams for fire lieutenant promotions [in the Buffalo Fire Department] in 1998 and 2002 were illegal because they had a discriminatory impact on African-Americans. Only a handful of minorities passed the tests.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, many white firefighters feel they were unfairly passed over for promotions because of the long legal fight over the fairness of the exams.</p>
<p>Curtin ruled this week that the exams were valid tests of the skills needed for a Fire Department lieutenant, and he found &#8220;insufficient&#8221; evidence to prove that the city intentionally engaged in discrimination.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The issue has been hotly contested for 12 years. The society has the right to appeal, and the organization intends to do so, said the group&rsquo;s attorney, Thomas S. Gill of Frederick, Md.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Society members have long alleged that African-Americans seeking promotions do not receive fair treatment in the city, an allegation that the city has denied.</p>
<p>The issue of race in firefighter promotions was addressed by the U. S. Supreme Court in a decision that received widespread publicity last June.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Curtin mentioned that Supreme Court decision briefly in his ruling on the 1998 exam but did not cite it as having any role in his decision. {snip}</p>
<p>In New Haven, officials acted out of fear that lawsuits would be filed, while in Buffalo, the Fire Department was already under a court order to refrain from discriminating by race, Perry said.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m guessing this test was relatively easy.  One question on the St. Louis Fire Department promotion test, one that was called discriminatory, and one that too many blacks couldn&rsquo;t get right, required you to divide 90 by 30.  I&rsquo;m glad to know that simple division is a requirement for promotion within the SLFD, but sad to know that it is not required of firefighters on the private rank.</p>

		<p>Of course, nobody would DREAM of doing an IQ test on all those firemen, and then seeing who were the smartest in the group.  It&rsquo;d be the white guys, more than likely.  And that simply proves that smarter people do better on tests.  Now how hard is that?</p>

		<p>Faced with an average four-year achievement gap by 12th grade between black and hispanic students and white students*, employers seeking to devise (or purchase) a written test that does not have a &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; will fail.</p>
<p>*The most succinct definition of the &#8220;achievement gap&#8221; is furnished by Education Trust:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the time [minority students] reach grade 12, if they do so at all, minority students are about four years behind other young people. Indeed, 17 year-old African American and Latino students have skills in English, mathematics and science similar to those of 13-year-old white students.&rdquo; (Closing the Achievement Gap, National Governors Association Clearinghouse, 2002, 9th paragraph) https://www.subnet.nga.org/educlear/achievement/index.html<br>

		<p>All that &#8220;Men of Color Helping All Society&#8221; have to do is appeal the decision until they finally have an Obama appointed judge to rule on it.  Then they will win.</p>
<p>After all, why should black people have to become literate, study, and so on if they can rely upon the specter of &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; to get themselves promoted?<br>

		<p>This group was not fortunate enough to be located in the same district as Sonia Sotomayor. I&rsquo;m sure she would have come up with some sort of tortured reason as to why the minority firefighters should be promoted but the whites who outscored them should not. One of these days the immovable object of the 14th amendment is going to have to run head long into the irresistible force of &#8220;disparate impact&#8221;. With this kind of nonsense, it is bound to happen and the justices will not be able to finesse a finding for either a plaintiff or a defendant. </p>

While I know there is an IQ gap between blacks and whites, I strongly suspect that the issue here isn&rsquo;t disparate impact but disparate input.</p>
<p>I believe that blacks have conspired in groups to do poorly on these tests in order to claim that they are biased, have the tests thrown out, and then be hired through alternative means.</p>
<p>BTW, our black mayor recently denied the reappointment of the white Chief of the BFD and replaced him with a black man, Garnell W. Whitfield Jr.</p>

		<p>Here it is 2010 and they are arguing over a test that was given in 1998?? I would have to think that a lot of the plaintiffs would have retired by now. So what is the point?</p>
<p>And these tests ARE eminently fair. The companies hired to write the tests take great pains to make sure that there is fairness. They actually go around to the fire lieutenants and ASK them what knowledge is needed to do the job. Questions on the test are germane to the job and relevant.</p>
<p>And some folks spend years in preparation for the tests and STILL cannot pass. What does that say?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m convinced that the 14th begat disparate impact.  So far from being an immovable force conflicting with an irresistible object, they&rsquo;re both the same thing.</p>
<p>If the Constitution demands equal protection under the law, and the society believes in racial equality so much so that it practically marginalizes and persecutes those that don&rsquo;t, then what else is the Federal judiciary to do but deem that any test that doesn&rsquo;t result in relatively equal promotion rates among the races is somehow flawed?</p>

		<p>I wonder when someone will notice that blacks aren&rsquo;t equally represented in fighter cockpits, despite dramatic lowering of minimum standards for them by both the USAF and Navy.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re also not equally represented among nuclear physicists. Hmm, there don&rsquo;t seem to be too many of them among mechanical, electrical, and chemical engineers either.  </p>
<p>Clearly, the sheer scope and breadth of this conspiracy is almost beyond comprehension.</p>

		<p>Fire itself does not discriminate on the basis of race.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to fighting fire, a person who has the knowledge, skill, and strength to fight it correctly will succeed better than the person who lacks those qualities, all other factors being equal.  The same goes for fire rescue.  A person who knows what to do, who has the requisite skill, and who possesses the strength will do a better job of rescuing people than someone who doesn&rsquo;t have those qualities.  Again, the fire itself doesn&rsquo;t care.  But you, as a potential victim, should care, and that&rsquo;s the difference!</p>

		<p>Is it possible to devise an exam which is bias in favor of blacks?  I imagine it would have a large section on &#8220;cultural knowledge,&#8221; similar to Jeopardy when it has a black contestant.</p>

<p>You would think that such common sense considerations would prevail within the processes of hiring such life-saving professionals as paramedics, doctors, firefighters, cops, etc. We&rsquo;ve long since reached a point where qualifications are hardly the bottom line. The typical excuse is that such professions as firefighting require skills other than those represented in the content of entrance tests. It&rsquo;s as if the left is really trying invalidate the entrance requirements so that no one will observe how frequently blacks fail to meet them. As if to help underperforming blacks say, &#8220;Hey, who cares if we typically score well below passing on the entrance exam? That test isn&rsquo;t being used anyway!&#8221; It still raises the question of why racial disparities in scores exist. For the well-being of the public, each firefighting applicant should be required to meet ALL qualifications, rather than merely being allowed to excel in one area, as if this compensates for failure in another.</p>
