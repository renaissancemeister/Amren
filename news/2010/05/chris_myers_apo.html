<h1>Chris Myers Apology Katrina New Orleans</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Huffington Post, May 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Fox broadcaster Chris Myers apologized Thursday to the people of New Orleans for disparaging remarks he made about the victims of Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p>Mayor Mitch Landrieu sent a letter to Fox Sports president Ed Goren demanding the apology from Myers for comments made Monday on the Dan Patrick Radio Show. Myers talked about the flood victims in Tennessee pulling together to help themselves, instead of standing on roof tops and blaming the government  &mdash;  an obvious reference to Katrina victims.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I would very much like to apologize to you and the people of New Orleans for the inappropriate and insensitive remarks I made this past Monday,&#8221; Myers said. &#8220;Clearly, these remarks demonstrated poor judgment and I sincerely regret making them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Landrieu also said it&rsquo;s not about Nashville versus New Orleans. And he said anyone who tries to draw that comparison is being divisive and reckless.</p>

I&rsquo;ve noted the same thing about tornado victims.</p>
<p>Every year, you see these people standing in front of the hole in the ground and splinters that used to their home.</p>
<p>When interviewed, through their tears, they say they&rsquo;re going to rebuild.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen follow ups to these stories. A year later, the demolished homes and schools are rebuilt to higher standards.</p>
<p>5 years after Katrina, blacks are still telling us &#8216;George Bush doesn&rsquo;t like black people.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>He has no reason to apoligize. Several years ago an actor made a joke about WT Sherman on the Tonight Show and the audience laughed and applauded!! Dennis Miller made jokes about Al &amp; Jesse&rsquo;s boycott of SC and the same thing happened on the Tonight Show. I no longer watch that show because of those two episodes. As far as New Orleans is concerned,I have a question about the ones that looted tv stores and jewelry stores. How many days did it take them to realize,[Gee I wish I had some food right now?] </p>

		<p>Ouch the truth hurts there is bound to be some sociologist who has the courage to look at these disasters and figure out what the differences were. How much worse was Katrina than the Nashville flood. </p>
<p>As a disaster it is obvious that Katrina was far worse. That said however the aftermath is very telling indeed. Very little looting to speak of the social services, police, ambulance etc. were opperational and non chaotic in their response. No seige mentality where ganstas fired upon rescue efforts. </p>
<p>No banning of fire arms the way Mayor Nagin did in New Orleans. My guess is that someone responsible will be able to ad the x&rsquo;s and o&rsquo;s and come up with more telling observations like education levels and of coars racial make up. Maybe Jared Taylor should write another book.</p>
<p>How bout it Mr. Taylor?</p>

<p>And why, pray tell, was it such an obvious reference to Katrina victims? Because that&rsquo;s exactly what they did! They did stand on roof tops and blame the government! If that weren&rsquo;t  the case no one would have known what he was talking about! Can&rsquo;t you people see this??</p>
<p>Of course, the main purpose of this kind of hysterical reaction is to send the message that nobody had better speak honestly about anything touching on race. That&rsquo;s the way things are in the United States of Amerika&hellip;the land of the free and the home of the brave.</p>

<p>How typical!</p>
<p>The truth is told and then the &ldquo;bold&rdquo; and bastardizing Bolsheviks from Harvard are &ldquo;offended.&rdquo; God only knows, that these feral and rutting Red swine would be &ldquo;offended,&rdquo; if a gingerbread house gets built in Kentucky at Christmas time. </p>
<p>There is no need for an apology, unless it comes from General Secretary Bo and his Marxstream media concubines!</p>
<p>Enough said:</p>

		<p>More apologies for the truth. RACIAL truths, that is. Whites are so far gone that I wouldn&rsquo;t lift a finger to help very many of them anylonger. They a;; must have a racial death wish.</p>
<p> After watching the country music (what they call country nowadays) and blacks now filling their ranks and they all seem so delighted and the White girls in the audience shouting their approval, I decided America is in the abyss. Watch some of these shows, including dancing with the stars and a black guy paired with a White dancer and how the pc judges and audiences just love it all. On EVERY show on TV there is a black in EVERY program and more likely than not paired with a White woman. </p>

		<p>Next time someone is pressured to apologize, instead of apologizing, make a public statement describing the pressure. Make it really clear, so that everyone listening can&rsquo;t help but understand.  Explain in detail what they threatened to do to you, &amp; to your family, if you didn&rsquo;t apologize.  Make a recording of the threats, &amp; play it publicly, over &amp; over.  </p>
<p>Before anything constructive can happen, whites have to stop apologizing. </p>
<p>Blacks never appologize for anything they do. Why do we?</p>

		<p>The real villian of Katrina is Ray Nagin.  Every City in the US has an emergency/evacuation plan, when that fails you fall back on the County resources and after that the State resources.  FEMA usually comes in to mop up.</p>
<p>There were three levels of failure before the problem ever got to the federal level yet nothing is ever said about that fact.</p>
<p>Wonder why?  </p>

<p>It don&rsquo;t get more stupid than this! The Katrina victims Houston took in afterwards. Too lazy to get off their backsides to look for jobs. Years later, still on the welfare train. I remember one TV newscast with a fat Black female being interviewed in a hotel room. While her three kids were using the double-bed as a trampoline. But what the hell? It&rsquo;s not THEIR furniture they&rsquo;re trashing, right?</p>

<p>Well there it is folks, this Landrieu clown DEMANDED and this Myers clown CAVED.  Apologizing for harmless remarks, yes harmless, on a stupid radio show?  Ridiculous.   </p>
<p>Myers, they just demanded you submit your freedom of speech to them and with a sniveling apology, you did!</p>
<p>Apologizing for nothing to another man who demands it from you is the CLEAREST sign of no backbone.  Also a clear sign of how far we&rsquo;ve sunk and where we&rsquo;re going. </p>

		<p>Just once I&rsquo;d like to see a white man in his position reply with something along the lines of, &#8220;I&rsquo;m sorry for telling the truth.  I&rsquo;m sorry that most New Orleans blacks could not refrain from descending into uncivilized african-esque behavior the moment a disaster hits.  I&rsquo;m sorry that people didn&rsquo;t care half as much when disaster hits whites as it does when it hits blacks.  But most of all, I&rsquo;m sorry I didn&rsquo;t say any of this much, much sooner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bonus points if it&rsquo;s on live TV and the camera cuts to the faces of the show&rsquo;s hosts right after.</p>
<p>Ah, the priceless looks alone would be worth the loss of any career.</p>
<p>@ 10) Seems a bit pessimistic.  During Katrina the New Orleans whites patrolled their neighborhoods for blacks, killing several that were suspected of looting/caught looting(I can&rsquo;t remember which, but to be honest I don&rsquo;t really care) and kicking out others.</p>
<p>As far as the TV comments go I wouldn&rsquo;t know for the most part as to their validity, as I only watch one show and it&rsquo;s a science fiction with romance drama thrown in(Stargate Universe, incase anyone was curious - it&rsquo;s like a carbon copy of Battlestar Dramatica).  There are no black&white; relationships, the one black man being a borderline sociopath.  The country music comment seems a bit off though, as whenever I flip over to some show featuring a country band playing the audience is always 100% white, as are the singers.</p>

		<p>the same year that Katrina hit, there was MORE damage along the Mississippi river valley along 4 states than there was in LA. Because the destruction occured in 4 different states (IL, IA, MI, KY) the amount of damage in 1 state was not enough to declare it a disaster zone. combined though&hellip;</p>
<p>these states got absolutely no help from the federal government nor any media attention.</p>
<p>a woman was interviewed by a local radio news agency and the reporter asked the lady what she was going to do without any government assistance, she responded &#8220;what white people always do, fix it ourselves&#8221;. </p>
<p></p>
<p>when we had a massive flood 94&rsquo; in petersburg, illinois, most of the male students @ school were anxious and pissed becuase they would not let us leave school to go help sandbag our water treatment plant. eventually, once the volunteer fire department and the local policing agencies heard of our desire to help, and realized there was no other place to find 200 corn fed, willing, sandbaggers, they let us go help, and we saved the water treatment plant. when we were done securing our water supply, we went and saved another couple dozen businesses and homes. </p>
<p><br>
Myers, we demand an apology for the lies of your apology, and except your initial statement as truth. </p>

		<p>You can look at the floods of 1993 on the Mississippi River and the 1997 and 2009 floods of the Red River in North Dakota and see people who worked to rebuild communities. Oh, and most of these areas are pretty white, especially North Dakota. A quick look at Wikipedia and there is a photo of volunteers at the Fargodome filling sandbags. Imagine that, people actually trying to save their city without waiting on Uncle Sam to do everything. Somehow, I doubt that the North Dakota Highway Patrol or the police departments in Fargo or Grand Forks were looting Wal-Mart and car dealerships while things were going bad. Would I be surprised if there was some low level shoplifting, no, but we weren&rsquo;t treated to the scenes of people walking out with carts full of food, tv&rsquo;s, and anything else that could be taken away.  </p>
<p>Contrast this with the scenes on TV during and after Katrina. What a horror show! My brother and his wife told me about the Katrina refugees showing up where he lived and crime going through the roof. Look at the differences between Chile and Haiti. The Chileans actually cleaned up their mess. </p>
<p>Chris Myers didn&rsquo;t lie, he did much worse, he violated the laws of political correctness. He should have doubled down and told Mitch Landrieu to p*** off. </p>

		<p>  Ever since Katrina I have been puzzled at the photos of school busses sitting in their parking area under water..Were the busses broken down-no gas-no drivers.I would really like to know why these busses were not used in some evacuation ..Is it possible to even think there was some neglect,or did the drivers refuse,as it would be too dangerous..</p>
