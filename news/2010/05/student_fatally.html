<h1><a href="https://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7421853">Student Fatally Beaten in Mexico</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gene Apodaca, KTRK-TV (Houston), May 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A local high school student has been found murdered in Mexico, after her mother told police she went down there to learn how to transport illegal immigrants across the border.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And at Kempner High School, the loss of one the school&rsquo;s brightest students has been tough enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, you want to see everybody happy,&#8221; said student Shaina Ituah. &#8220;We don&rsquo;t want violence. We don&rsquo;t want sad faces.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the school&rsquo;s parking lot, Mandala&rsquo;s parking spot is filled with short eulogies and sweet goodbyes, but now students wonder whether the high school senior who loved Justin Beiber and riding horses at her family&rsquo;s stables led a double life.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve heard a whole bunch of rumors,&#8221; said student Tamara Awofeso. &#8220;At first, I didn&rsquo;t believe it because it sounded like something out of a movie theater.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to a Mexican newspaper, Elisabeth Mandala, 18, was found dead this past Saturday in the small Mexican town of Mina. Her body, along with those of two Mexican men, was found in a Dodge truck which appeared to have wrecked. But, according to the newspaper, authorities suspected the wreck was merely a cover-up for murder, believing the victims had been beaten to death hours before.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mandala, we have learned, was reported missing to Houston police on May 1. Her mother told authorities she had rented a car a few days earlier to go to Mexico to meet up with someone.</p>
<p>According to missing persons, her mother told police that she wanted to be a coyote  &mdash;  a human smuggler. Her mother also told police Elisabeth was an exotic dancer.</p>

		<p>Who lets their 18 yr old daughter go to mexico to meet with &#8216;someone&rsquo;?  In addition, nobody in the car rental business rents to 18 yr olds, and to mexico? This sounds fishy.  Nevertheless, her ideals apparently got her killed. </p>

		<p>I am grieving this one. What kind of mother would knowingly allow her daughter to be an exotic dancer and skip off to Mexico? You can see this poor girl&rsquo;s trainwreck of a life hurtling toward the cliff. What a shame. A very tragic end to a young woman who was never taught how to make wiser choices.</p>

		<p>The most obvious question to ask would be:</p>
<p>What would the White mother of a White girl in Houston Texas allow her teenage daughter to go to Mexico to learn how to help smuggle illegal Mexicans into the United States??</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something wrong here, radically wrong.  If a mother would let her teenage daughter do something like this is it any wonder that we&rsquo;re falling apart as a nation?  The mother and father (if there is one) should be held responsible.  The mother is sick - in plain English.  And coincidentally the girl has blond hair.  It is such a pattern that repeats itself over and over again.</p>
<p>Another little item that is noticeable is that the girl appears Hispanic.  Amren intimated she&rsquo;s White.  Is is possible the Father is Mexican?  That would explain a lot.</p>

		<p> Exotic dancer and aspiring coyote.  Clearly she had her morals and loyalties sorted out. She just couldn&rsquo;t abide the taste of that silver spoon in her mouth, I guess. One is tempted to say that she just didn&rsquo;t have a clue what she was getting herself into, but in fact she was at an age and from a background where clues were readily available to those who seek them.  I suppose she&rsquo;ll become a martyr to the millions of clueless, delusional liberals who think all those people cross the border illegally to pick our lettuce and mow our lawns.</p>

		<p>She was what???  Unbelievable!  The brainwashing is so widespread, it&rsquo;s beyond sickening.  What a foolish, foolish girl!  First, meeting up with anyone in the smuggling business - no matter what they&rsquo;re smuggling - is dangerous and, even more, despicable.  This is one American??? who did not intend to serve her country well.</p>
<p>What kind of citizen are we breeding these days?  Am I suppose to feel bad?  Because I don&rsquo;t.<br>

		<p>Naivete is commonplace in adolescent youth along the border.  Faced with deteriorating elementary and secondary school programs, increasing polarization among adults regarding race and illegal immigration, some adolescents are caught up in the excitement of the moment and resolve their ambivalence through mis-placed idealism.  This could probably be explained as identifying with the aggressor, since many border towns from Arizona through Texas are overwhelmed by the spore of illegal cartels, flouncing into town with Tahoes and AK&rsquo;s, setting up their illicit drug fueled fiefdoms in small towns all along the border.<br>
A sad story.  Reader, this could be a young woman from your town.  She could be a girl in one of your kids&rsquo; classes.  A truly sad story.  But do not be mistaken, she is a casualty of an ongoing border war with Mexico.</p>

<p>True - but when you are 18 years old and get your news from MTV then smuggling is portrayed as helping advance human rights and fighting white racism.</p>
<p>Poor kid never had a chance and there are many more like her. Remember Amy Biehl? </p>
<p>Unless parents teach white kids about race they will think that the white devils/black angels view of the world is true and will often pay with their lives.</p>

<p>I hate to say this, but it could be her LACK of ideals that got her killed. Exotic dancer is often an occupation for those that are drug users, habitual. And the dancer occupation is just the last phase prior to prostitution.</p>
<p>And her family owned STABLES? These were monied people? Monied but Elisabeth was in over her head while still in high school. That blond appears to be from a bottle and she does look Mexican too.</p>

		<p>I was a substitute teacher at Kempner a while back.  The place was a multi-racial, multi-cultural zoo even in 1996.  A huge, windowless main building of modern architecture at its worst; 3,000 students; very disorganized, almost chaotic.  Before class students smoked dope behind the temporary buildings.  When I was there East Indians and Chinese dominated the honors classes. (They also made up most of the tennis team). Mexicans and blacks predominated in the remedial classes, with whites scattered through all levels.  Teacher and student morale was the lowest of any school in the Ft. Bend district - everyone hated the place. One day I substituted in an honors class, mostly Asian. Before the first period, the pledge of allegiance was read over the loudspeakers in each room.  No one got out of his seat.  Already irritated by the surly attitude of this class, I yelled, &#8220;ON YOUR FEET!&#8221; and began loudly saying the pledge. The students slowly, grudgingly, stood up, scowling at me, and mumbled their way through it.  Of course, I wanted to say, &#8220;GET OUT OF MY COUNTRY!&#8221; to these invaders, but didn&rsquo;t.  </p>
<p>Based on my experiences at Kempner, I&rsquo;m not at all surprised by this story. </p>

Tamara Awofeso,  Mandala, Shaina Ituah&hellip;.<br>

<p>Come now!  This &#8220;exotic dancer&#8221; has blond hair that&rsquo;s plainly out of a bottle. Her complexion is much too dark to be a natural blond. She&rsquo;s barely even Caucasian.  And the name, Mandala, suggests India, not Mexico.   It&rsquo;s NOT Spanish.   </p>
<p>She isn&rsquo;t Hispanic (at least on the father&rsquo;s side, although the mother could be   &mdash;    and I would guess there&rsquo;s a good chance of that, because a Hindu mother wouldn&rsquo;t let her teenage daughter become an &#8220;exotic dancer&#8221; and go off alone to Mexico to &#8220;meet someone&#8221;.)   </p>
<p>Just imagine:  she wanted to be a human smuggler.  What a fine profession for a highschooler to aspire to!</p>

		<p>My previous post didn&rsquo;t work, so I&rsquo;ll try again.</p>
<p>This girl is 100% Mexican.  Look at her features.  Her hair must be dyed.</p>
<p>My guess is that the girl may have been the family breadwinner.  She had her own car, and she worked as an exotic dancer, and she was trying to set up an immigrant-smuggling business, probably with an adult Mexican &#8220;boyfriend.&#8221;  The mother was probably OK with all of it as long as the money was rolling in.  She didn&rsquo;t think her daughter would end up dead, but she was obviously comfortable with a level of risk that would have terrified any normal parent.</p>

		<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t wish to be heatless but I&rsquo;ll say it plain - good riddance! That&rsquo;s right, there are many among us for whom no hope is to be held out, whether 18 or 80. I know plenty of wide-eyed, liberal young idealists and NONE of them, so far as I can tell, would do anything as stupid and destructive as this! This girl wasn&rsquo;t only endangering herself - she was endangering ALL of us, and that&rsquo;s where I draw the line. She made herself an enemy and thus, I cannot mourn her passing. </p>

Where does the surname &#8216;Mandala&rsquo; come from?<br>
To me &#8216;Mandala&rsquo; always meant a sacred/religious diagram used by mystics in the East.</p>

		<p>The girl looks Hispanic to me as well, but I trust Mr. Taylor has done his homework. </p>
<p>As a note for fellow Amreners, looks can be deceiving in this world. My older sister is a self-hating white. She tans her skin, paints her face a bronze color, and dyes her hair a dark color. Men often mistake her as a hispanic or asian. it also does not help that she speaks like a black and acts like one too. It is really painful for me, but when she takes off all the make up and interacts with the family, or finds herself away from the company of colored people, she&rsquo;s my big sister again. Sad that is it so rare. </p>
<p>Personally, I used to dye my hair black, and there were times I was mistaken as a hispanic. </p>
<p>I am completely certain this young woman is wearing a thick liquid foundation. Her eyebrows are also painted on.  </p>

		<p>In the picture she appears to have black eyes, meaning she cannot be a caucasian, which is irrelevant in any case, and her name, and the names of these friends are what nationality? They certainly sound Mexican to me. #6 GetBackJack, I totally agree. Plus she needed psychiatric counseling, it may have saved her life, unless she had gone to a liberal counselor who would have probably encouraged her behavior. I feel certain she was a hissy, and was in all probability encouraged by her, I use the word loosley, &#8220;PARENTS.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Research has shown, and observation confirms, that whatever a person&rsquo;s intellectual understanding might be of the dangers that abound in the world, persons tend to feel and act as if the entire world and its behaviors are just an extension of the small world and behaviors they grew up in.</p>
<p>If this girl had been raised among the kind of people she finally met in Mexico, she wouldn&rsquo;t have been so dumb. </p>
<p>But with the upbringing she had, she probably felt that the dangers of the border were just an adult version of the children&rsquo;s games she had played growing up, or were a sort of staged excitement like movies and TV.</p>

		<p>Y&rsquo;all, please stop calling that girl &#8216;white&rsquo;!!!</p>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t you ever heard of BLEACH?  I&rsquo;ve been to enough parties in New Orleans, where you&rsquo;d meet all the siblings of enormous off-white families.  The brothers have uniformly raven locks, while their sisters&rsquo; tresses come in every color.  And the more &#8216;connected&rsquo; the families are, the blonder the sisters are.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s nothing, compared to Houston, which is a mecca for &#8216;colorists&rsquo;.  There&rsquo;s big money in Houston, and the &#8216;coloring culture&rsquo; of rich Latinos there has trickled down to&hellip;people who live beside stables, like the Mandalas.  Going in for &#8216;streaking&rsquo; (or whatever) has probably been a weekly ritual for her, for years.  I&rsquo;d imagine a good chunk of her earnings as a stripper went to her (obviously very good) colorist.  Makeup, BTW, can make the skin appear whiter.</p>
<p>From her nose, and her surname, I&rsquo;d assume her Paternal ancestry is Indian.  There are a handful, still, of natural blonds in India&hellip;..but Houston being Houston, I&rsquo;d guess this is about bleach.  Too, there are older photos of her with very dark hair.</p>

		<p>I took a look at the link to the CBS pics posted by poster #14.  This girl is Asian (Indian) or something akin to that.  There is no chance in H- that she is a &#8216;white girl.&rsquo;  At least one parent is non-white, without question.<br>
  <br>
I have taught Indian/Asian/latina students for years.  Picture #2 is the clincher.  She is standing next to an authentic white girl.  Mandala&rsquo;s giant curvy chin area stands out and is identical to nearly every light-skinned Indo-Pak/Indian latina girl I have ever taught.</p>
<p>There is a whole subculture of light-skinned to just a tad bit brown Indian/Pakistani/latina girls who bleach their hair and act like white girls.  It is a huge culture and I know girls who are in it.  They act totally white and disguise themselves as white and obsess over white acting stars.  This &#8216;Mandala&rsquo; is one of them.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Exotic dancer is often an occupation for those that are drug users, habitual. And the dancer occupation is just the last phase prior to prostitution.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exotic dancer&#8221; is a modern, politically correct euphemism for what is (or was) formerly known as a &#8220;go-go dancer.&#8221; Most certainly those young girls and women involved in that line of &#8216;work&rsquo; are in an &#8216;business&rsquo; environment filled with many unsavory characters and influences.</p>

		<p>She is quite clearly Sicilian Italian, and she may even speak Italian. Looks like an oldtime Sicilian family from the Houston area. On her Facebook page, she lists a FB group that is 100% Italian language among her favorites, and she has several friends with the same last name who have FB Italy pages all in Italy, who are all living in Italy right now. The Mandalas are a Sicilian family who moved to Houston 75-125 years ago, all coming from the same small village in Sicily.</p>
<p>Evidence here, including a list of her probably Sicilian relatives in the Houston area.</p>

		<p>I agree with whoever said the mother should be in jail.  She knew what was going on and apparently did nothing to talk sense into her daughter  &mdash;  in my eyes, that&rsquo;s aiding and abetting.  If my child was involved in that, I&rsquo;d tell him to stop or I&rsquo;d turn him in.</p>
<p>Given that, the mother is as much a traitor as her daughter was.  That&rsquo;s some good parenting there  &mdash;  daughter was an exotic dancer and wanted to help people invade the country!</p>

		<p>It has been anything but a secret for quite some years that the Mexican border area is really, really dangerous.  Someone moronic enough to ignore this fact would probably also think that criminal alien invaders deserve our sympathy and need our help.  Oh, wait&hellip; never mind.</p>

		<p>They sure raise &#8216;em up clueless these days.  Elisabeth&rsquo;s Mom doesn&rsquo;t seem to have been at all concerned that she worked as a &#8220;exotic dancer&#8221; and wanted to bring illegal aliens into the country.  I&rsquo;m sure the mass media and public school culture of political correctness and sexual nihilism have done much to educate Elisabeth Mandala.  Responsible parents should work hard to protect their children from both influences.  The girl doesn&rsquo;t seem to have had a father in the picture, and that figures.  Dads are usually the ones who lay down the law.</p>
<p>If Elisabeth was one of Kempner High School&rsquo;s brightest students I&rsquo;d hate to see what the average is like.</p>
