<h1>Arizona Ethnic Studies Law Signed by Governor Brewer, Condemned by UN Human Rights Experts</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jonathan J. Cooper, Huffington Post, May 22, 1010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed a bill targeting a school district&rsquo;s ethnic studies program on Tuesday, hours after a report by United Nations human rights experts condemned the measure.</p>
<p>State schools chief Tom Horne, who has pushed the measure for years, said a Tucson school district program promotes &#8220;ethnic chauvinism&#8221; and racial resentment toward whites while segregating students by race.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s just like the old South, and it&rsquo;s long past time that we prohibited it,&#8221; Horne said.</p>
<p>The measure prohibits classes that advocate ethnic solidarity, that are designed primarily for students of a particular race or that promote resentment toward a certain ethnic group. It also prohibits classes that promote the overthrow of the U.S. government.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Horne said he believes the Mexican-American studies program teaches Latino students that they are oppressed by white people. Public schools should not be encouraging students to resent a particular race, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A Republican running for attorney general, Horne has been trying to restrict the program ever since he learned that Hispanic civil rights activist Dolores Huerta in 2006 told students that &#8220;Republicans hate Latinos.&#8221;</p>
<p>District officials said the program doesn&rsquo;t promote resentment, and they believe it would comply with the new law.</p>
<p>About 1,500 students at six high schools in the district are enrolled in the program. Elementary and middle school students also are exposed to the ethnic studies curriculum. The district is 56 percent Hispanic, with nearly 31,000 Latino students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Six UN human rights experts released a statement earlier Tuesday expressing concern about the measure. All people have the right to learn about their own cultural and linguistic heritage, they said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The law doesn&rsquo;t prohibit classes that teach about the history of a particular ethnic group, as long as the course is open to all students and doesn&rsquo;t promote ethnic solidarity or resentment.</p>

		<p>The first law gets the lie that cops can pull over anyone based solely on the suspicion of their citizenship status - the second law gets the lie using the blanket term &#8220;ethnic studies.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so much easier to substitute actual critical thinking and debate with insults like &#8220;bigot,&#8221; &#8220;racist,&#8221; and the like, and simply whip oneself into a froth of moral superciliousness, isn&rsquo;t it? Deplorable.</p>

		<p>The problem is and always has been that the ONLY race that doesn&rsquo;t believe in and practice (to the very extent of their power to do so) &#8220;ethnic chauvinism&#8221; is white people.</p>
<p>This is a catch-22 situation.  Whites don&rsquo;t evidence a desire to maintain dominance yet it is our very values (and ONLY our values) that guarantee others the right to their own determination and respect for thier cultures.</p>
<p>Whites need to get this.  To really GET THIS.  The only way to maintain a place in the world for everyone is if we control it and maintain it by insisting our laws, our mores and our racial existence is maintained and dominant.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that evil non-white fascists have tricked us into not understanding what our racial dominance does for the world (that this is a good thing, not a bad thing) as part of a scheme to dominate and then destroy others.</p>
<p>Mexicans would take over parts of the US and ethnically cleanse other races from our lands.  Rape, robbery, murder and torture would become commonplace (as they are in mexico, near the border).  For &#8220;human rights experts&#8221; to support that instead of the US insisting such a things is not allowed, reveals what they REALLY are&hellip;..fascists&hellip;.nazis.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Republicans hate Latinos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Actually, everything on the subject I have ever heard since a boy in California from comments and actions by Latinos informs me of the exact opposite, with the caviate of replacing Republicans with &#8220;White People.&#8221;</p>
<p>But they are most duplicitous about it.  They love us when it is a matter of money or women (white).  They hate us when we resist any of their advances, in any realm.</p>

		<p>In case minority children are insufficiently imbued with racial resentment by the multiculturalism of the K-12 years, American universities are developing a catch-all remedy, &#8220;whiteness studies&#8221;: </p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;whiteness studies is &hellip; taught in 30 universities around the country from Princeton to San Francisco State. It is based on the idea that whites are born to privilege, a position used to oppress blacks, Hispanics and native Americans &hellip;&rdquo; (Fox News, Feb. 15, 2006) </p>
<p>Harvard University is a pioneer: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Make no mistake about it: we intend to keep bashing the dead white males, and the live ones, and the females too, until the social construct known as &lsquo;the white race&rsquo; is destroyed  &mdash;  not &lsquo;deconstructed&rsquo; but destroyed,&rdquo; says a scholar at Harvard&rsquo;s W. E. B. Dubois Institute (Harvard Magazine, September-October, 2002):<br>

		<p> This second Arizona law is a good step in the direction of taking back the country&rsquo;s educational institutions (K-12, colleges, universities, vocational schools). K-12 schools should simply be places and environments where local revenues, under the direction of local school boards composed of legal citizens, are used to forge and mint new generations of Americans, knowledgeable about their nation&rsquo;s origins and history and loyal to its true values and heritage. Yes, technical skills and excellence should be encouraged (and by the way, solid practical education for mid-talent students and fast-track advancement of the very talented should always take precedence over efforts to artificially pull ahead those whose home/ethnic environment and/or genes keep them behind). And yes, independent thought must be nurtured. But doctrinaire, anti Western/White/American teachers should not be tolerated in any accredited school. In fact, getting rid of such teachers and professors will improve freedom of thought for our students, since they will no longer be intimidated and terrorized by treasonous ideologues in the classrooms. Also, restoring a patriotic atmosphere will make it easy to spot those behaviors (in foreign students, or those they brainwash) that have been shown to be correlated with later terrorism. Home schooling should also be encouraged.<br>
  And as for the UN &#8216;experts&rsquo;: the USA set up the United Nations after WWII to promote foreign policy goals deemed by our then elites to be conducive to America&rsquo;s interests and values. But that organization has long become a &#8216;one-dictator, one vote&rsquo; hate-America club, with third-world countries cliquing together based on ethno-religious blocks. Its ideals have become a joke. Furthermore, domestically, the UN has helped us oppress the Serbs in the &rsquo;90s, and it teams up with our new, cosmopolitan, America- and West-hating &#8216;elites&rsquo; (epitomized by the occupation regime of the Kenyan) in order to shove the &#8220;New World Order&#8221; down our throats, and practice genocide against our people. I vote we expel the UN from our territory, and start a new organization: say, one composed of America, the other European-founded nations, Japan, India and a few more carefully chosen countries. I would also give precedence, within Europe, to those nations who better reflect our values at present (e.g. a Poland or Czech Repoublic might be accepted before a Greece). Just like EU membership is based on some gerrymandered criteria of fiscal soundness (cf. the current crisis in southern Europe), membership in the new organization will be based on a country&rsquo;s track record in promoting Western civilization (e.g. the UK in its current manifestation would have to work hard to be accepted!). Frankly, the US itself might not at present qualify; but a federal government that would set up such a new alliance, would also be in a position to lead the several states in curing our ills. And education, immigration, language and culture would be excellent places to begin.</p>

		<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed a bill targeting a school district&rsquo;s ethnic studies program on Tuesday&hellip;The measure prohibits classes that advocate ethnic solidarity, that are designed primarily for students of a particular race or that promote resentment toward a certain ethnic group&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This reminds me of the story of the kid that stuck his finger in the dike thinking he could hold back the Zuider Zee.</p>
<p>This bill is three decades too late.</p>
<p>As demographics change across the Southwest, school boards and political offices will be filled with race-based activists such as the White-hating m. sanchez.  Ethno-centric studies programs that vilify Whites will be brought back, glorified and fully funded.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where the money will come from, though, to fund the schools as the White tax base and productive businesses flee from punitive taxes leaving state coffers dry.</p>
<p>The entire K-12 school curricula is White-hating and non-White ethno-centric as &#8216;historians&rsquo; such like howard zinn re-write American history textbooks.</p>
<p>OO reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;radical historian Howard Zinn [has a] lack of concern for historical truth. An article in Quadrant, an Australian journal, discusses Howard Zinn&rsquo;s disastrous influence. </p>
<p>Zinn&rsquo;s radical (and radically unsound) tome, A People&rsquo;s History of the United States: 1492-Present, has gone through five editions and multiple printings since it was first published in 1980, selling almost two million copies, and is assigned in thousands of university and college courses in America, making it the best-selling work of history ever written by an American leftist&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>All American textbooks that our children read are written in the same vein.</p>
<p>The History Channel has come out with a PC, 12-part, &#8216;The Story of Us&rsquo; which the  the president and general manager of the History channel states is:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; not about dates, facts and dead people. It&rsquo;s about presenting a very rich story in an engaging and entertaining way, and along the way, lo and behold, hopefully millions of people will watch something that they hadn&rsquo;t anticipated&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Notable historians providing commentary include Donald Trump, Michael Douglas, Jimmy Wales, a Wikipedia founder, Brian Williams, Tom Brokaw, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and  Henry Louis Gates Jr.</p>
<p>Does anyone believe henry louis gates will give an accurate account of American history?  Or will American history, according to &#8216;professor gates&rsquo;, be presented as one of Evil White hegemony and Evil White-generated genocide?</p>
<p>The History Channel is also providing free DVDs and teaching guides for The Story of Us for any school that asks. </p>
<p>The only solution is separation  &mdash;  we must separate ourselves from these White-hating racists who plan genocide for us and our children once they become a majority, which is happening rapidly.  Separate and guard ourselves and loved ones with deadly force using every White-created  weapon and strategy in our arsenal and not hesitate to use it.</p>
<p>Is this not how our ancestors survived the ice ages and harsh conditions in N. Europe?</p>
<p>Or the only safe place WILL be Doggerland.</p>

		<p>Whites are just suppose to roll over and play dead when other ethnic/racial groups initiate chauvinistic &#8220;education&#8221; programs that would be called racists if whites were to do the same for themselves. <br>
   The real problem, as usual, is that too many whites actually going along with this effrontery in a cowardly sort of suicidal liberality. Whites make this adversarial nonsense possible because they think anything that looks like white solidarity is wrong. It&rsquo;s as if there is a suicidal guilty gene in whites that other racial/ethnic groups just don&rsquo;t have.   </p>

<p>Whites do not have a &#8216;suicide gene.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The hostile, anti-White media, academia and government have triangulated against us by promoting White guilt  &mdash;  and any White that falls for the media&rsquo;s &#8216;White guilt&rsquo; lies is a fool.</p>
<p>No other group except Whites has the government&rsquo;s boot on its neck.</p>
<p>THAT IS THE PROBLEM.</p>
<p>It is Open Season on Whites as a hostile, alien government legislates and discriminates openly against Whites in favor of non-Whites.  The racist AG himself stated to the Senate Judiciary Committee that the Hate Bill does not protect Whites.</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/26pba2o" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/26pba2o</a></p>
<p>To stand up for White Rights puts one at grave risk of losing his career, pension, reputation and quite possibly his freedom.</p>
<p>Is it worth it?  Is it not better and easier to toe the party line and repeat:</p>
<p>We Are All Equal!</p>
<p>Race is a Social Construct!</p>
<p>All of us are of Equal Intelligence and Capable of the Same Achievements!</p>
<p>Therefore, I wouldn&rsquo;t call it White Guilt but rather White Terror  &mdash;  and it will continue as long as the government demands we Whites and ONLY WHITES remain atomized and individualized with no powerful group or loud-mouthed advocates to represent us, as long as the media and academia portray us as evil and demand that the government keep us in line by rendering us utterly powerless and voiceless (lest we foment a Fourth Reich). </p>
<p>Such as the state we Whites find ourselves in after a well-planned, 50-year long protracted War on Whites and Western Civilization.</p>

		<p>This law will almost certainly stand up to court challenges, since these &#8220;ethnic studies&#8221; classes are generally cover for anti-white, anti-American propaganda.  The reconquistas are certainly entitled to agitate all they want - as per the US first amendment that they otherwise have no use for - but they aren&rsquo;t entitled to do it with public school (taxpayer) money.</p>
