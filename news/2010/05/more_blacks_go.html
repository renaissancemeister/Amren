<h1>More Blacks Go to College, But Graduation Lags</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Russ Mitchell, CBS News, May 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Obama delivered the commencement address today at Virginia&rsquo;s Hampton University  &mdash;  his first as president to a predominantly African-American school. Fifty-five percent of African-American high school seniors go on to college these days, compared to 45 percent in 1970.</p>
<p>But graduation day is another story, as CBS News correspondent Russ Mitchell reports.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since 2004, American universities have used a six-year standard to measure graduation rates; but even with the extended time, African-Americans still lag in obtaining degrees. Only 43 percent of African-Americans who enter college graduate  &mdash;  20 percent lower than the rate for whites. And for black men its more alarming, with only 36 percent who enter finishing college.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hampton currently graduates 55 percent of its students within six-years. That&rsquo;s better than most universities, but significantly lower than schools like Harvard (95 percent) and Yale (94 percent.).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But at predominately black universities where the concentration of first generation and low-income students is high, the challenge can be daunting. Seventy percent of students who drop out cite lack of finances Twenty percent of incoming students have to take remedial classes But, historically black colleges still produce 25 percent of the nation&rsquo;s black graduates.</p>

		<p>In his commencement speech to Hampton U. graduates, President Obama bemoaned the culture of too many iPods and too much information.  Just two years ago, they were telling us that he was going to be the cool one, with his finger firmly on the pulse of early 21st Century America.  Now we find out he can&rsquo;t work an iPod.</p>
<p>Remember, there is a very strong crossover between iCabal tools and Obama/lefty types.  I think Steve Jobs was for Obama.  The Google Brats, Larry and Sergey, were both for Obama, and flew him on their private jet.  So is it really any surprise that Obama bites the hand that feeds them?  Ask Goldman Sachs what that&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>However, I think the fact that Hampton is an HBCU might be telling.  Not that these graduates would do this, but don&rsquo;t forget the three most recent extremist hate mob wildings, two in Philly and one in Kansas City, were all organized on Twitter, and partially on smartphones.  Obama is right   &mdash;   Some people just don&rsquo;t deserve that level of technology.</p>

		<p>There is a silver lining in this for the Diversity Privilege Stereotypes and their White promoters.</p>
<p>The longer it takes blacks to even try to graduate, the longer they will be on campus surrounding the White girls. The government can keep their scholarships flowing as long as it wants.  &#8220;</p>
<p>Transforming amerika means abandoning the outdated notion that blacks should graduate. We need them on campus more than we need them as alumni, and it doesn&rsquo;t matter how long they&rsquo;ve been here. Cultural sensitivity demands of us that we understand their unique challenges and accommodate ourselves to their needs. Diversity is our Strength.&#8221; </p>
<p>Diversity in education means blacks and Whites being put together as social equals.  Blacks then have equal proximal access to the White Wombs of college girls. While the blacks are trying to access the White Wombs from the outside, the professor-priests are converting the inside into believing that &#8220;Making White Babies is a Hate Crime against Human Dignity!&#8221;</p>
<p>With the physical pressure at nighttime parties and the moral pressure during daytime class (i.e. immoral), our White girls don&rsquo;t stand a chance at keeping themselves pure and undefiled by the black curse.</p>
<p>Knowing White girls as I do, they are completely susceptible to &#8220;doing the right thing to bring about change and social justice,&#8221; and they will all be ruined, which is the purpose of the entire experiment.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really care, because if we were such a White Race of Titans, our White Women would protect themselves and their White Bloodlines with ferocity.  They don&rsquo;t save themselves just for us, so let them rot from HIV/AIDS, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, herpes, gyno warts, chancroid, trich, scabies, etc. </p>
<p>College is the worst thing a parent can do to a White Child.<br>

		<p>Apparently black students <i>never</i> simply fail.  They just have to drop out &#8220;because of lack of finances.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, presumably, because of Evil White Racism.<br>

		<p>Guess which one will grow up to be king of afroamerika after being given a free full ride (four years at least, then as many more years as needed to convert all the White girls on campus to the Equality Multicult) scholarship?<br>

<p>The elegant and beautiful Anglo Saxon White girl will become a party favor at the Multicultural Dorm. She will Erasim by never making a White Baby.  She will only make ugly mulatto obamababies, because she will  easily be convinced by MSM, her school teachers and her evangelical preachers that MAKING WHITE BABIES IS A HATE CRIME AGAINST HUMAN DIGNITY.</p>
<p>At least these ubiquitous Diversity advertisements let the mixed race mulattos keep their kinky wool all wild and nappy.  I heartily approve of this important step in the right direction.</p>
<p>Maybe White Racist babies will see these advertisements and instinctively know to avoid anything (I quit saying &#8220;anybody&#8221;) that looks like that.</p>
<p>I recall racist comments made by my White parents when they were raising me, and I cherish these memories as a sacred sacrament of inherited White Wisdom.  I continually pass these on to my daughter, and the results are encouraging.  When I show her this advertisement from JCrew tonight, we will play our nightly &#8220;What&rsquo;s Wrong with this Picture&#8221; game.  She&rsquo;s on a winning streak recently, and her privileges and allowance are increasing in proportion. Racism has its rewards, such as survival, for starters.  <br>

		<p>If a black student can spell his own name and sit in a desk, which is pretty much what one needs to get a high school diploma, he can get untold grants and loans to go to college.  Of course this country needs more black studies majors flooding the workforce like it needs a dozen more Detroits.  Instead of African American studies why don&rsquo;t they call it what it really is, hating whitey and grievance mongering.    </p>

		<p>&#8220;Only 43 percent of blacks who enter college graduate; 63 percent of whites&#8221;</p>
<p>Is there anybody on this site who isn&rsquo;t aware that the 43% graduation figure for blacks is the result of the requirement that blacks are given for AA entry; AA grading: and AA certification?  As one professor admitted, we are under intense pressure to pass X number of blacks, and if we don&rsquo;t we are called forth by the powers that be to explain our shortfall.&#8221;</p>
<p>That 43% figure, like everything else about academia and blacks, is a disgusting lie.  But if they&rsquo;re not catered to they will riot, won&rsquo;t they?  And we all know that the wealth and power in this country wants to create no waves in order to protect their wealth and status with the likes of rioting and civil wars and such.</p>
<p>Almost everything about this empire is based on out and out lies.  I&rsquo;m ashamed to be a part of it and I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s falling rapidly into chaos and breakup.</p>

		<p>An added benefit is that many White males from non-wealthy families are denied a college education. Asians are then imported to do the jobs for which White men are no longer qualified. Everybody benefits, and White men recieve the punishment that they deserve.</p>

<p>Sympo,</p>
<p>To put your statement another way, women lust after conquerers. In these day, non-white men are the moral conquerers. Just look at all the benefits affrimative action and welfare give them. When a country is conquered in war, the women sleep with the the conquerers (The Third Reichs occupation of France, Norway, etc).</p>
<p>Women are also fickle. They will not save our race. As always, it will be up to men willing to risk their lives to save us. There was an article posted here a while ago concerning the lack of female allies in our struggle. The author concluded: &#8220;We do not need to have women on our side to succeed, we need to succeed to have women on our side.&#8221;</p>
<p>Acknowleding and accepting a woman&rsquo;s inferiority in this aspect is vital. Once you succed, and I have faith in you, we will bare your children.</p>

		<p>I go to college in Nashville with these academic wonders who can&rsquo;t even write an English paper at the high school level.  And of course, there&rsquo;s the beauty of black magical thinking to contend with-that is if they just go to school and show up at their classes, the high grades will appear.  Meanwhile, it&rsquo;s easier for them to get grants and loans than I can, because even though I&rsquo;m only second-generation American, I&rsquo;m one of their &#8220;oppressors.&#8221;  Their abuse of money for education will only further bankrupt this government.yeah, I agree there are some stupid white girls who will consort with them, but other whites on campus realize what a scam this is.</p>

		<p>I used to work in a school with a large black population (the rest was latino).  If you knew the extent of the games our young white lib teachers played to get them into college - it would be a scandal!  We had kids who could not write more than a paragraph, and even that was RIDDLED with errors, &#8216;getting in&rsquo; to colleges thanks to the application doctoring of the well meaning urban lib crowd.  </p>
<p>I tried to picture how I was as a first year college student and then compare that with how these 19 and 20 year old &#8216;kids&rsquo; were in &#8216;twelf&rsquo; grade.  They have no chance. Yes, I was clueless at 18 years old, but I had a decent suburbab education in an all white school. </p>
<p>Ahh, but the social justice axe is now being taken to colleges where stodgy old professors are finding themselves swept away in a new round of educational &#8216;reforms.&rsquo;  The second to last class I took, about four years ago, was taught by a young, &#8216;with it&rsquo; social justice adjunct &#8216;professor&rsquo; who did all the touchy-feely exercises with us every single day.  </p>
<p>Thank God my very last class was with an old, traditional, bust your chops, expert professor.  That was real learning in the manner our civilization pioneered and executed so well.  Alas, it is fading away with the addition of lots of affirmative action and &#8216;diversity&rsquo; hip-hop hires.  (&#8216;Different perspectives.&rsquo;)  When we don&rsquo;t even have good colleges anymore, what will America do to make money?  (Our factories are gone already.)</p>
<p>The work of destroying the high school level educational experience and obliterating our &#8216;brain trust&rsquo; of experienced teachers is already nearing the end game.  All the talk of getting rid of tenure, basing teachers&rsquo; jobs on student test scores, etc. is the nail in the coffin.  </p>
<p>When older (experienced) teachers can be dismissed in favor of the 23-year-old &#8216;Teach for America&rsquo; brats, who have no content knowledge and teach with poster board projects and social justice gobbeldy-gook, then all that will be left is the fading memory of our once vibrant civilization, whose last stand will be in private schools.  Even they are not safe.  A future gubbamint will demand they open to more &#8216;diversity&rsquo; and then the cycle will trend downward there.  We don&rsquo;t even have the backup of moving to Europe, the homeland of our ancestors, anymore.</p>

What these figures say to me, is that some significant percentage of these should never have been enrolled in the first place. They might be on our campuses as part of some liberal feel-good effort, or to meet some quota; but they certainly aren&rsquo;t there on <i>merit.</i> </p>

		<p>To Sympo,</p>
<p>Somewhere I read that White women can&rsquo;t resist powerful men, even those of different race. Probably an article by the renowned Kevin MacDonald, now with American Third Position.</p>
<p>Stated that one of the purposes of Diversity is to push blacks into higher and higher positions of authority, thus making them acceptable and attractive to White women who will breed with them and continue to ruin our race through corrupting our pure White bloodlines. The agenda is to weaken us, and it is working. </p>
<p>Nature within us must be heard, and only then can we put a stop to the insanity.  We must find ways to force the White elites who force Diversity upon us to only be allowed </p>
<p>The 1950&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s esteemed Segregationists warned us about all this, and their horrors are coming true.  They were our Prophets of Doom, and we should honor them be reading everything they wrote.   Start with Carlton Putnam, the greatest of all.</p>

		<p>A common game blacks play here in Michigan is to get into a college after they&rsquo;ve been given the money to pay for the schooling, and then bail in less than one semester.  Their wallets are fat with taxpayer money, and they&rsquo;re back on the street.  </p>

		<p>Right. All those affirmative action programs and intensive recruiting GET people into college, but graduating is another matter. If in the first place you were not able to make the grade and high school testing seemed to suggest this was so, graduating is just that much more difficult. Lots get in, but a much smaller number and percentage graduate.</p>

One of the black males,whose ACT of 15(I was amazed the Tribune divulged that bit of info) was below the average for black males at large!!!  &mdash;  this male got an offer of a full free ride at&hellip;are you ready? Johns Hopkins University. What do you think would happen to a white male with an ACT of 15 who showed up at Johns Hopkins? Theyd sic the dogs on him. How could this male POSSIBLY learn ANYTHING  at that school?? Turns out he DECLINED the offer,the Trib said,looking for a &#8220;better aid package.&#8221; Holding ouit for a higher salary. </p>
