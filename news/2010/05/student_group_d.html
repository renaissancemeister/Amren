			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jana Winter, Fox News, May 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Michigan school district investigating whether an elementary school field trip that excluded white students was illegal has disbanded the black-students-only academic support group that participated in the outing two weeks ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have essentially put it on hold while we wait for the final determination on the investigation into possible violation of the State&rsquo;s Proposal 2,&#8221; Ann Arbor School District spokeswoman Liz Margolis told FoxNews.com.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The intent of our field trip was not to segregate or exclude students, as has been reported, but rather to address the societal issues, roadblocks and challenges that our African-American children will face as they pursue a successful academic education here in our community,&#8221; Madison [Principal Mike Madison, who is black] wrote.</p>
<p>But instead of quashing tensions, the letter fueled a week of controversy and an onslaught of parental complaints that culminated late last week in the school district&rsquo;s launch of an investigation into whether the field trip violated Proposal 2, a new state law that bans racial favoritism in public schools.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It is likely this lunch program will be reworked to serve more students who are not testing at proficient or above on the state assessment tests,&#8221; said Margolis, who last week told FoxNews.com that the principal&rsquo;s motives were not in question.</p>

		<p>I am offended at the hold being put on this vital and divisive program.  We need more programs like these to teach White students that afrovoodoos get a special Diveristy Race Privilege that is denied to the Whites because of their race.</p>
<p>White students who witness and experience discrimination are less likely to believe in</p>
<p>the Promise of American Equality, or <br>
Diversity is Our Strength, <br>
or We Need to Do More to Atone for the Sins of Segregation, or<br>
Making White Babies is a Hate Crime against Human Dignity, or<br>
that Black History Month is interesting, or <br>
the Rev. Michael King and Rosa Parks are admirable, or <br>
that the Black Community is anything other than incompetent and violent, or <br>
that obamavoodoo is Our First Truly American President, or </p>
<p>all the rest of what makes us miserable because of the afro curse put on this nation by the Afro Tribal Chiefs who sold their cousins to the Dutch.</p>
<p>Whites students need more exposure to afrothuggery, not less.</p>
<p>Bring back the segregated field trips! Tear down the roadblocks to White Awakening!</p>

		<p>Roadblocks?? Their only roadblock is the size of their brains. With A.Action and special programs for blacks only, its a level playing field so the only roadblock is the one between their ears!</p>

		<p>So there is an &#8220;investigation into whether the field trip violated Proposal 2&#8221;. How &#8216;bout a violation of their own policy as stated in the school newsletter of January, 2010! <br>

No person shall be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination in any educational program or activity available in any school on the basis of race,&hellip;&#8221; <br>

When whites lost the right to discriminate and segregate, blacks lost those rights as well.</p>
<p>When they return those rights to me, they can have them as well.</p>
<p>Until then my message to blacks is, play by the rules you demanded.</p>

		<p>From the comments here at AR when this story first broke, I found out that my initial suspicion was correct, that the black &#8220;rocket scientist&#8221; in question is an AA Diversity/HR/PR hack/commissar/enforcer, not an actual rocket scientist.  </p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re so concerned about real rocket scientists, why are you taking students who by now it is perfectly obvious that they won&rsquo;t be rocket scientists to see one?  They should take the smart and elite students, though the better use of their time, at least during school hours, is on advanced mathematics and science classes so that they can actually become rocket scientists.  </p>

		<p>Yup, it&rsquo;s just as I suspected:  administrators have mush for brains.  It&rsquo;s a prerequisite for anyone entertaining the idea of going into public school administration.  How is it that none of these dolts could foresee that a field trip for blacks ONLY was exclusionary???  My 9 year old nephew saw through that in 2 seconds.  There&rsquo;s something called common sense that seems to elude administrators of every school district in the nation.  With people like these running our schools, how can we be surprised at the product?</p>

Just what else could you possibly call a school activity that would ONLY include you if you were black and EXCLUDE you if you were White???</p>

		<p>As bad as this &#8216;Blacks only field trip goes&rsquo; I wonder why people aren&rsquo;t up in arms about the Bill and Melinda Gates College Scholarship Fund that excludes every minority high school student in the world except Caucasians! Gates turned over the operation of this thing to the UNCF but evidently is happy with the status quo.  I wrote the TV show, &#8216;The O&rsquo;Reilly Factor&rsquo; about this discrimination act against White Americans but Bill O&rsquo;Reilly has never mentioned it on the air.  You would think that most Americans, especially whites would appreciate knowing about what kind of future their kids face in this country, especially those whose sons have come home from Iraq and Afghanistan in body bags or without arms or legs.  If Mr. Gates had excluded Jews, Blacks, and all other minorities from partaking of his charity, why it would be all over the news but since his hatred is only for white people, it doesn&rsquo;t even rate a story on page 69 of the dailies.  White people better wake up and soon.</p>

<p>Of course it was, and that would be just fine if public education funds had not been used for this.  Moreover, the &#8220;societal issues, roadblocks and challenges&#8221; the black students face are really code for family breakdown, sloth and an average IQ a whole standard deviation lower than that of whites.</p>

		<p>There is a typo in my comment(see #12)in the opening sentence.  What I meant to say was that the Bill and Melinda Gates Scholarship Fund is offered EXCLUSIVELY to minorities and EXCLUDES WHITES.  I really goofed there and promise to check out my typing before posting any future comments.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;The intent of our field trip was not to segregate or exclude students&hellip;,&#8221; said Principal Mike Madison (who is black) of a program that was intended for the exclusive benefit of black kids, and intentionally excluded white kids.</p>
<p>Perhaps the &#8220;roadblocks and challenges that our African-American children will face,&#8221; according to Madison, is more related to the Afro-logic being conveyed by educators like Principal Madison than the legacy of evil white racism, which has been used to justify &#8220;legal&#8221; discrimination against whites for the past 40+ years.</p>
<p>When will &#8220;legal&#8221; discrimination against whites end? When will whites stand up for themselves? It&rsquo;s rather sad if not pathetic, but their opportunity to form a majority voting block in America is fast running out.</p>
