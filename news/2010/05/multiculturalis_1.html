			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Salim Mansur, Toronto Sun, May 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The recent comments by Ujjal Dosanjh, former NDP premier of British Columbia and present Liberal MP for Vancouver South, in reference to multiculturalism and political correctness are politically significant and commendable.</p>
<p>The high value of Dosanjh asking tough and relevant questions on a subject that is near taboo among the political and media elite is partly because he represents liberal-left thinking in the country.</p>
<p>In a column for the National Post on April 23, Dosanjh contended minority communities  &mdash;  immigrants of non-European origin  &mdash;  threaten the social fabric of Canada by an obsession with injustices in their &#8220;homelands&#8221; in the recent or distant past. The result is excessive emphasis &#8220;placed on the differences that keep us apart from each other&#8221; and &#8220;diminishing emphasis on commonalities and values that bind us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dosanjh knows from experience what he speaks and writes about in unmasking the negative consequences of multiculturalism. He was a prominent victim of violence for publicly opposing extremists in the Sikh community to which he belongs by birth.</p>
<p>Sikh extremists are not alone in sheltering behind the politics of multiculturalism, then pushing their agenda that runs counter to Canada&rsquo;s national interests and liberal democratic values.</p>
<p><b>Advance their agenda</b></p>
<p>The obvious 800-pound gorilla in Canadian politics  &mdash;  as it is in most of the western democracies  &mdash;  is the ideology of Islamism dressed as religion and its adherents skilfully exploiting multiculturalism to advance their agenda, whether it be importing Shariah (Islamic laws) or undermining Canada&rsquo;s support for Israel.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism as a doctrine stipulates all cultures are of equal merit and deserve equal treatment. What remain unspecified  &mdash;  perhaps deliberately  &mdash;  in this formula are the criteria by which the equality of cultures is assessed.</p>
<p>Moreover, since the multicultural doctrine is untenable and easily falsified, it can only be sustained by the heavy-handed political correctness of the Canadian state promoting this balderdash at much expense and increasing public dismay.</p>
<p>The idea that Canada has been multicultural since the first Europeans arrived on its shores is a recent invention. It was devised out of necessity and bad faith to mitigate the challenge that Quebec nationalism and separatism presented to English Canada.</p>
<p>It could be said that Canada with its aboriginal population was multicultural. But once the English and the French engaged to wrestle control over this vast country, the Canada that eventually emerged as a dominion was bicultural and bilingual.</p>
<p>Immigration made Canada multi-ethnic. The success of modern, liberal democratic and multi-ethnic Canada rests upon the indispensable strength, culture and history of the founding peoples  &mdash;  English and French, Protestants and Catholics  &mdash;  and the institutions they built that would take in immigrants from around the world.</p>
<p><b>Diminishes history</b></p>
<p>Multiculturalism is a diminution of Canada&rsquo;s founding history. It diminishes the vitality and largeness of the political culture that has accommodated a multitude of ethnicities within its borders, while it fails in bringing to immigrants  &mdash;  especially of non-European origin  &mdash;  a compensating increase in appreciation for those values that went into building Canada as a model of civility.</p>
<p>Dosanjh has done a much-needed service to his country. It is now for the rest of us to engage in a constructive discussion on how to roll back multiculturalism, this doctrine of divisiveness, for the love of Canada.<br>

		<p>The only thing the liberal left is concerned about seems to be keeping women of color away from white men. And the lefts followers, unless they are aware this is the agenda, would have to be lumped into the category of useful idiots. In fact, it seems the only thing they are good at. Good enough, apparently, that it keeps them and their &#8216;ideals&rsquo; in power even as western societies collapse around them. </p>

		<p>This is a well written take on Canada&rsquo;s multiculturalism problem, but fails to satisfy with its choice of remedies.</p>
<p>Mansur echoes the thoughts of other non-white intellectuals like Indo-Canadian writer Neil Bisoondath, who wants to see racial and ethnic identities become irrelevant in a future Canada (the term &#8216;post-racialism&rsquo; was coined to describe this).  Rather than find this recomendation appealing, it leaves me feeling I&rsquo;m being taken to the cleaners.</p>
<p>I do not want my race to be stirred into the melting pot of miscegenation and forced &#8216;post-racialism&rsquo;, so that Asians, Arabs and Africans can feel more welcome.  I would rather we abandon official multiculturalism and allow people to freely associate and racially self-segregate, while re-introducing discriminatory immigration policies to favour white Western numerical dominance. </p>
<p>In Canada we called the co-existance of French and English the &#8216;Two solitudes&rsquo;.  The new Canada is the Canada of multiple solitudes. </p>
<p>Non-whites should be encouraged to wear their ethnic garb, maintain their languages, creeds, customs, distinctive names, and continue to intermarry within their own communities. I don&rsquo;t want to appropriate their cultures, and I don&rsquo;t want them appropriating mine. If multiculturalism has a redeeming quality, aiding self-segregation is it.<br>

		<p>This long overdue article on multiculturalism written in the framework expressed here, should have appeared in a Canadian MSM format some 20 years ago, long before Toronto became so blessed with the &#8220;joys of diversity&#8221; from every third world non-white country in the world. </p>
<p>From reading most of the comments from the original article linked above, I was pleasantly surprised that Canadians appear to be throwing away their cape of fear by expressing themselves much as would readers to AmRen.</p>
<p>Canadians are far more reticent than Americans when speaking about racial issues due to our draconian hate laws and self-imposed political correctness, but perhaps <i>change is in the wind</i> judging by this essay, which incidentally, was written by a well-versed non-white immigrant himself. </p>
<p>Perhaps, an actual Canadian-born white journalist could now take the lead and write a similar piece condemning multiculti, now that the &#8220;<i>emperor has been publicly exposed</i>&#8221;. We can only hope!</p>

		<p>Canada actually developed its own multi-cultural society, the Metis, who were half-breed First American and European mix.  They were of course rejected by both cultures, and were the only ethnic group to rise in open rebellion against the Canadian government.</p>

		<p>No one has ever asked the &#8220;diversity&#8221; what kind of diversity they actually celebrated. It is quite obvious that non-whites are explicitly racial and have no use for this bit of feckless fashion that white liberals use to dun other whites with.  I doubt Obama could even answer that question, simply because he is a black racialist with no need for &#8220;diversity.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The former Premier of British Columbia might even have made his speech slightly longer and listed the ethnic gangs which have enriched his province.</p>
<p>To my certain knowledge there are Sikh-origin gangs, Hindu-origin gangs, Chinese-origin gangs and Filipino-origin gangs; Canadian readers can supply a far fuller list.</p>

		<p>It would appear that only Canadian citizens with names like &#8220;Ujjal Dosanjh&#8221; are permitted to question political correctness.  A White making the same statement would attacked as a Racist.<br>

		<p>White liberals enable and indoctrinate non-whites into the mindset that whitey has stolen everything from you.  I come from a humble background and worked my way up - way up.  I never ruminate on who &#8216;stole&rsquo; from my poor ancestors.</p>
<p>Non-whites from Asia come over here and a lot of them get really rich really fast.  Who is enabling that?  If I go to Asia, Africa or Latin America, I doubt the natives there would tolerate me getting rich and living off the system.  Can you imagine a bunch of poor but dedicated white immigrants to Cambodia or anywhere else being allowed to surge ahead of the locals in wealth and influence?</p>
<p>Only whitey provides an easy path to wealth for anyone willing to slave away for it.</p>

		<p>The only people that beleive in &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; are white people. Everyone else just sees it as a way to trick white people to voluntarily give up their position of leadership in the world. <br>
To most minorities in the US, &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; means they get to beat up on &#8220;whitey&#8221;. <br>
As the black panthers intimidating voters said when confronted: <br>
&#8220;You&rsquo;re about to be ruled by a black man, cracker!&#8221;<br>
