<h1>Do I Look &#8220;Illegal&#8221;?  &mdash;  Latino Nationwide Movement Building</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>"axelcaballero," AlterNet, April 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Arizona&rsquo;s draconian immigration law is creating a wave of Latino social network activism. Following the signing of S.B. 1070, one of the most anti-immigrant laws in the country, Latinos have chosen to mobilize online in numbers rarely seen before. Within 24 hours of launching the &#8220;Do I Look &#8216;Illegal&rsquo;?&#8221; campaign, the Latino page Cuéntame has seen an immediate response  &mdash;  with thousands adopting the mantra and ready to take action.</p>
<p>The Arizona bill has hit a nerve within the Latino community, with emotions ranging from disappointment to right out anger. The idea behind the &#8220;Do I Look Illegal&#8221; campaign is precisely to channel those emotions into a new form of social network activism. It is aimed at highlighting how the Arizona law essentially institutionalizes the discrimination and persecution of the Latino community through racial profiling.</p>
<p>Along with the visual campaign, there is a nationwide boycott-taking place and a video series being produced to highlight the movement. For a very long time Latinos have represented a strong economic engine for Arizona. It is often one of the most under-rated and misrepresented aspects of the Arizona economy. The spotlight almost always focuses on the effect of undocumented individuals in the state, and as the signing of S.B 1070 shows, the response is almost always backwards, misguided and a direct attack to the community as a whole.</p>
<p>Latinos taking part in this new wave of social network activism have not only spread the message by wearing &#8220;Do I Look &#8216;Illegal&rsquo;?&#8221; T-shirts, signs and posts but are spreading the message of the campaign online via status updates, pictures, blogs, video and making full use of all the social media tools available. It is reminiscent of the Twitter green movement that took place last year. As such Cuéntame along with other Latino groups continue to plan actions in Arizona and Los Angeles with on-the-ground organizations to protest S.B. 1070.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Do I Look &#8216;Illegal&rsquo;?&#8221; movement shows that not only have Latinos arrived in full force to the world of social media activism but that these actions are prompting massive on the ground efforts which represent the first major Latino mobilization in light of the 2010 mid-term elections.<br>

<p>In the very first sentence, readers are being explicitly told what to think.  Arizona&rsquo;s law   &mdash;   which simply says that illegal border-jumpers are illegal   &mdash;   is &#8220;draconian.&#8221;  And mestizo pro-lawbreaker outrage over this is &#8220;social network activism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Considering the source, this is hardly surprising, but it does illustrate how adept our enemies are at exploiting the media.  Our <i>facts</i>   &mdash;   well-reasoned and incontrovertible as they are, just don&rsquo;t have that kind of visceral impact.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for a few more rabble-rousers on our side.<br>

		<p>They just don&rsquo;t understand that the law doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Yes&hellip;.they are readily identified by the barest visual inspection.  Most are involved in the drug trade.  They have been causing havoc in arizona.  Arizona has decided to basically pull over all mexicans knowing full well the majority will be carrying drugs.  They plan to make it incredibly risky for these people to even be present in the state of arizona.  They are throwing this &#8220;law&#8221; out there as the barest excuse for what they are doing.  Since so many will be caught with drugs, nobody is going to challenge them about what they are really doing, lol.  And they will continue to do it, even if the law is struck down.  They may or may not give lip service to enforcing that law anyway.  What matters is they will be quite successful in using racial profiling to destroy the drug trade in arizona.  Immigration violations are only an excuse (and I&rsquo;m surprised no one has really caught on&hellip;..or perhaps they don&rsquo;t dare point this out for fear the drug trade issue will become widely known).</p>
<p>The real fun is the effect that driving the drug trade into surrounding states will have.</p>

		<p>One can tell an illegal just by looking at them and listening to them. Most do not speak english. I will wager that one in five mexicans ARE illegal and I would even like to see all of the legal ones (since 1965) be deported.That law was unconstitutional and nothing but ANTI-White to begin with and NOT what the Founders ever intended to take place. They were NOT for the nonwhite races to ever become legal or even be allowed to stay for long in this country. They did not set up this country for all the races in the world. Quite the opposite, yet we are told over and again that this is what America is suppose to be about. What LIES!</p>

<p>Let the movement build all it wants.  They&rsquo;re still not going to get what they want.  All they&rsquo;re really doing is making a lot of people angry at them as before.</p>

		<p>This is good.  Since tolerating the invasion is indefensible, the MSM&rsquo;s policy has been to ignore it.  The more fired up the foreigners get, the harder it will be to play dumb.  Plan B and C are accusations of racism and pleading economic necessity, two losing arguments once the muzzles come off.</p>

		<p>  Doesn&rsquo;t a fisherman throw his line in where the fish are? Aren&rsquo;t most Arizona illegals from Mexico or Central America? Wouldn&rsquo;t our overworked law enforcement officers, interested in apprehending illegals, be more interested in Spanish speaking Latinos? We&rsquo;re not talking about random police checkpoints at intersections. The police have to have &ldquo;probable cause&rdquo; to stop and ask for documentation. Racial profiling is prohibited in the law. </p>

		<p>In certain big-city neighborhoods, the cops would truthfully have probable cause to question any black or Hispanic male.  In TV reality shows that feature homicide detectives, about 90% of the perps are black, and another 9% are Hispanic.  Almost all the men stopped have outstanding warrants, and, if in a car, drugs and guns.  Many of the cops are, of course, of the very ethnicity as the criminals, and they treat them just like the white cops do.  If these people want to be treated differently, then they must establish reputations as decent, law-abiding citizens.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t be happy until the last sentence of the above is RETURN AT YOUR PERIL.<br>
We are at war with terrorism, and we allow our border to be completely porous?  We try to stem the tide like a man trying to stop salmon swimming up river with a catch and release policy?  Our border SHOULD be enforced with deadly force and ALL illegal invaders assumed to be either drug cartel, or terrorists.  And if Calderon doesn&rsquo;t like it, he should be asked how he&rsquo;d like a two front war - the existing one against his own home grown drug cartels, and another against THE UNITED STATES MILITARY.</p>
