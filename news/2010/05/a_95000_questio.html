			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chris McGreal, Guardian (London), May 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A huge wealth gap has opened up between black and white people in the US over the past quarter of a century  &mdash;  a difference sufficient to put two children through university  &mdash;  because of racial discrimination and economic policies that favour the affluent.</p>
<p>A typical white family is now five times richer than its African-American counterpart of the same class, according to a report released today by Brandeis University in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>White families typically have assets worth $100,000 (Â£69,000), up from $22,000 in the mid-1980s. African-American families&rsquo; assets stand at just $5,000, up from around $2,000.</p>
<p>A quarter of black families have no assets at all. The study monitored more than 2,000 families since 1984.</p>
<p>&#8220;We walk that through essentially a generation and what we see is that the racial wealth gap has galloped, it&rsquo;s escalated to $95,000,&#8221; said Tom Shapiro, one of the authors of the report by the university&rsquo;s Institute on Assets and Social Policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s primarily because the whites in the sample were able to accumulate financial assets from their $22,000 all the way to $100,000 and the African-Americans&rsquo; wealth essentially flatlined.&#8221;</p>
<p>The survey does not include housing equity, because it is not readily accessible and is rarely realised as cash. But if property were included it would further widen the wealth divide.</p>
<p>Shapiro says the gap remains wide even between blacks and whites of similar classes and with similar jobs and incomes.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do we explain the wealth gap among equally-achieving African-American and white families? The same ratio holds up even among low income groups. Finding ways to accumulate financial resources for all low and moderate income families in the United States has been a huge challenge and that challenge keeps getting steeper and steeper.</p>
<p>&#8220;But there are greater opportunities and less challenges for low and moderate income families if they&rsquo;re white in comparison to if they&rsquo;re African-American or Hispanic,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>America has long lived with vast inequality, although 40 years ago the disparity was lower than in Britain.</p>
<p>Today, the richest 1% of the US population owns close to 40% of its wealth. The top 25% of US households own 87%.</p>
<p>The rest is divided up among middle and low income Americans. In that competition white people come out far ahead.</p>
<p>Only one in 10 African-Americans owns any shares. A third do not have a pension plan, and among those who do the value is on average a fifth of plans held by whites.</p>
<p>Shapiro says one of the most disturbing aspects of the study is that wealth among the highest-income African-Americans has actually fallen in recent years, dropping from a peak of $25,000 to about $18,000, while among white counterparts of similar class and income it has surged to around $240,000.</p>
<p>In 1984, high-income black Americans had more assets than middle-income whites. That is no longer true.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m a pretty jaded and cynical researcher in some way, but this was shocking, quite frankly, a really important dynamic,&#8221; said Shapiro. &#8220;This represents a broken chain of achievement. In the United States context, when we are thinking about racial equality and the economy we have focused for a long time on equal opportunity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Equal opportunity assumes that some people who have that opportunity are going to have pretty high achievements in terms of their jobs, their work, their income, their home ownership.</p>
<p>&#8220;The assumption in a democracy is that merit and achievement are going to be rewarded and the rewards here are financial assets. We should see some rough parity and we don&rsquo;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report attributes part of the cause to the &#8220;powerful role of persistent discrimination in housing, credit and labour markets. African-Americans and Hispanics were at least twice as likely to receive high-cost home mortgages as whites with similar incomes,&#8221; the report says.</p>
<p>Although many black families have moved up to better-paying jobs, they begin with fewer assets, such as inheritance, on which to build wealth. They are also more likely to have gone into debt to pay for university loans.</p>
<p>&#8220;African-Americans, before the 1960s, first by law and then by custom, were not really allowed to own businesses. They had very little access to credit. There was a very low artificial ceiling on the wealth that could be accumulated. Hence there was very little, if anything, that could be passed along to help their children get to college, to help their children buy their first homes, or as an inheritance when they die,&#8221; said Shapiro.</p>
<p>Since the 1980s, US administrations have also geared the tax system to the advantage of the better off. Taxes on unearned income, such as shares and inheritance, fell sharply and are much lower than taxes on pay.</p>
<p>&#8220;The more income and wealth people had, the less it was taxable,&#8221; said Shapiro.</p>
<p>There were also social factors, the study found. &#8220;In African-American families there is a much larger extended network of kin as well as other obligations. From other work we&rsquo;ve done we know that there&rsquo;s more call on the resources of relatively well-off African-American families; that they lend money that&rsquo;s not given back; they help cousins go to school. They help brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles, with all kinds of legal and family problems,&#8221; said Shapiro.<br>

		<p>The last paragraph begins to tell the truth.  The rest of the truth is that the income earners themselves tend to spend their money as fast or faster that they can earn it, and spend it on themselves, and on useless &#8220;bling&#8221; and ostentatious consumption.  Even if they didn&rsquo;t have a lot of &#8220;hanger on&#8221; relatives who needed/wanted money for junk/bail/drugs, they still wouldn&rsquo;t be much better off in terms of savings than they are now.</p>

<p>Where are these pre-1960 laws that forbade blacks from owning businesses? I would like to read them for myself. Shapiro leaves out inconvenient facts concerning how much mollycoddling blacks receive throughout their lives. Blacks have access to loans, affirmative action, and other set-asides that are denied to Whites, yet they still fail at everything. Back in the early 1990s a couple of my friends opened a record store with their own meager savings, while black hair salons and hip hop clothing stores were giving loans. My friends applied for a loan, but were turned down. The record store survived for several years before the download revolution killed it off, but the black businesses failed in rapid succession. </p>

		<p>So in the last 26 years with all the affirmative action and special access to education and jobs, not to mention items like unearned tax credits, welfare and food stamps, blacks are now worse off than when we supposedly were discriminating. This is of course illogical, therefore it is either untrue or it demonstrates that the more society attempts to assist the black community the less responsibility they are willing to take for their own lives. Of course Shapiro&rsquo;s analysis is bogus in any event if one merely examins a single argument; that the black community through broad cooperation drains its resources and eliminates its wealth.  The exact opposite is of course argued as to why the Jewish community is so successful.  Which is it Shapiro?</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s the mystery? Blacks spend their money as soon as they make it-always have, always will. Psychological studies have invariably shown that blacks don&rsquo;t care much for deferred gratification-they want it now, and let the good times roll. End of story-next!</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t believe this is such a hard question.  Whites have more assets than blacks because their PRIORITIES are different!  The principles of saving money, getting a good education, focusing on family values, avoidance of drugs and alcohol overindulgence, relying on cash rather than credit cards, avoidance of committing crimes, keeping 6AM-10PM hours   &mdash;   all of these are white priorities and practices, and they are NOT generally black priorities or practices.  Any questions?</p>

<p>Wait a minute, wait a minute. There are so many claims and charges in this article it&rsquo;s hard to deal with all of them, but this is an outright lie. There were hundreds of businesses in mostly-black Harlem and other black areas long before the 1960s. Even if there weren&rsquo;t, whose fault would it be? </p>
<p>Does anybody really expect us to believe that blacks were prohibited from owning businesses? I&rsquo;ve heard a lot of cockamamie claims over the years, but this is a new one on me. Also note the weasel words <i>not really</i>.</p>

		<p>Not that anyone should expect anything but the usual knee-jerk marxism from <i>The Guardian</i> (of what, one wonders), but this screed reads like a jenkem dream.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;A huge wealth gap has opened up between black and white people in the US over the past quarter of a century&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s always been there.  Genetics, you know.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;a difference sufficient to put two children through university&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Implying that putting their kids through university is the concern uppermost in the minds of most amerikan blacks.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;because of racial discrimination and economic policies that favour the affluent.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Thank you, God, for revealing this fundamental truth to us.  We won&rsquo;t be so impertinent as to expect documentation.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&ldquo;African-Americans, before the 1960s, first by law and then by custom, were not really allowed to own businesses.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Uh&hellip;really?  I remember the Fifties quite well, and I never observed that it was illegal for blacks to own businesses.  I know that marxist morons in amerikan universities are willing to accept nonsense like this without question, but is the average Englishman really so uncritically stupid?</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to read beyond this paragraph without putting on a pair of hip boots.  The fact that it came from Comrade Shapiro of Brandeis should have been warning enough, I suppose.</p>

		<p>Far fewer white men have felony criminal records and far fewer Black men are in stable families. The criminal record makes getting many jobs difficult or impossible and indicates risky personal behaviour. The main separator for poverty in Blacks is an intact 2 parent family. It is Black behaviour that is the problem and not white prejudice but real world experiences that change the outcomes. Black have many advantages and special help but often fail to use it and fail to learn even basic math and reading.</p>

		<p>I am perplexed: Why does a U.K. news outlet make excuses for U.S. Blacks? Aren&rsquo;t there enough minority types in the U.K. to absorb  their interest and promotion? That the excuses are shoddy and inane is beside the point. <br>
By the way, one reason for Black failure is that liberals, like McGreal, claim that this failure is the fault of White men. What would help Blacks, would be pointing the fact that Blacks have the opportunities, and according to non-racist scientists equal ability. Therefore Black shortcomings are their own fault, and by working harder they could equal White success.</p>

		<p>Someone should tell this Brit that &#8220;equal opportunity&#8221; is NOT the same as &#8220;equal outcome&#8221;. For example, there&rsquo;s nothing in the world to prevent a black high school graduate from the Bedford-Stuyvesant district in Brooklyn from applying to admission to Harvard. He/she has every opportunity to do so. Whether they get in or not depends on many things. If the Bed-Stuy student has a 1.0 GPA, and is rejected, then that&rsquo;s that. But, he/she had the opportunity to apply to Harvard.</p>
<p>Vince Lombardi said it best: &#8216;The world does not owe a man a living. It owes him the OPPORTUNITY (emphasis added) to make a living&#8221;. </p>

		<p>If all of us Whites were made to give up the majority of their wealth to blacks (something that Obama is trying to do right now by the way) most of that wealth would be back in our hands within 2 or 3 (at the most) generations. Little would change despite all of the redistribution that is being proposed. It would be tough on Whites for awhile, but after a fairly brief time, we&rsquo;d be back to owning most of the wealth. </p>
<p>Since the 1960&rsquo;s, trillions of dollars has been given directly or indirectly to blacks. Despite that, Whites own a larger percentage of wealth than ever before. That&rsquo;s the point of Shapiro&rsquo;s study. It&rsquo;s amazing that he continues to believe that if the playing field were leveled somehow, things would change. No, they wouldn&rsquo;t. The field has been heavily tilted in favor of blacks in every way imaginable. Still, to no avail. But people like Shapiro continue to do &#8220;studies&#8221; that are pointless. This is like studying the reasons why short, fat White kids are not pro basketball material - in spite of training courses aimed at making them so. Please people&hellip; wake up and quit kidding yourselves. This situation will never change.<br>

		<p>I work with predominantly blacks (plus some mostly bitter Hispanics and Asian Indians) and they are obsessed with disparities as I think white liberals are. There&rsquo;s this sense of helplessness, that is things are because of some evilness inherent in the system or by the people doing better. There&rsquo;s no watching what is on your own plate and any sense of rugged individualism. Of course the Government is the great Savior and the answer to all wrongs. Sad but we are living in the Age of Obama.</p>

		<p>  Seventeen consecutive post, and every one has nailed it. It isn&rsquo;t rocket science, is it? Anyone who has ever lived around blacks knows that very few of them have any sense of restraint or frugality. This socialist Brit author knows it too, but he dares not speak the truth and utter a counter-revolutionary blasphemy. How big can the elephant in the room grow before the floor collapses? </p>

		<p>I live in one of the most diverse cities in America, and I can say with profound confidence that the reason for this disparity is that blacks and Hispanics squandor almost all their money on worthless stuff like big-screen TVs, Cadillacs which lose their value very quickly, and expensive clothes and shoes.  A pair of Air Jordans can cost, what, $150? White teenagers typically by Vans and other cheaper shoes, which rarely exceed $80. Black families eat out more often than whites, it seems, and this definitely leads to a lot of their income being wasted instead of being placed into items that will increase their net worth. A lot of whites have these problems too, but from my observations it seems far more common among blacks and Hispanics. Asians, on the other hand, are so well-off, generally, because they are very careful about spending money, and it definitely pays off. The question is, is this cultural? Or is it genetic? Probably a little bit of both.</p>

		<p>Why are not studies done that compares just to keep it racially simple how blacks compare to the yellow race in wealth accumulation?  There were laws written in this country especially in California that forbid the Chinese from owing any land; laundry shops could only be open at certain hours; no fishing allowed in certain areas; the shooting of the Chinese as sport, etc.  But YET the yellow race still persist and was able to beat the white man at his own game.  Today the discrimation continues, the yellow race is discriminated again in college admissions because their grades and test scores are too high; glass ceiling for managerial jobs, no affirmative action in hiring; no preferential treatment in government and corporate job contracts and in the court system, etc.  Yet despite all this, the yellow race in this country has the highest representation in colleges and wealth accumulation.  It is not that the yellow gene is superior to the white gene, not yet anyway, the yellow gene has more of an ability to stick to the grind.  But how the whites have treated the yellow race in this country is not any different than how the Chinese and Japanese would treat the whites in their own country.  This is how different racial groups of somewhat equal ability compete against each other.  </p>
<p>Hopefully, the white gene will not become submerged into the genes of the black and brown race in this country.  The brown race will eventually become the dominate race in this country if the present trend continues due to breeding and migration in large numbers and the foolishness of the white race. </p>

		<p>&#8220;how do these blacks and Hispanics compare to whites with similar incomes AND credit scores? I bet there&rsquo;s very little difference&#8221;. </p>
<p>I doubt that. The difference in &#8216;net wealth&rsquo; is at least to some degree reality. The stats are compiled, though, as &#8216;family assets&rsquo;. So while a black man may be living with a white woman, the &#8216;family&rsquo; left behind has a low net worth. Two wage earners are better than one. And when there are Two, for the black family, there&rsquo;s a good chance the &#8216;husband&rsquo; is playing the field with one or two other women. That&rsquo;s not cheap. I didn&rsquo;t read the entire original article on this one, but almost certainly white men and racism are implied to be at fault.   </p>

		<p>&ldquo;&hellip;That&rsquo;s primarily because the whites in the sample were able to accumulate financial assets from their $22,000 all the way to $100,000 and the African-Americans&rsquo; wealth essentially flatlined&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, all those ill-gotten  &#8216;financial assets&rsquo; accumulated by Whites were purely by accident, weren&rsquo;t they shapiro?  Or were those White assets &#8216;accumulated&rsquo; on the backs of and at the expense of &#8216;people of color.&rsquo;  Do they have less wealth because you believe the economy is a zero sum game tilted unfairly toward Whites?</p>
<p>Whites didn&rsquo;t do a thing to &#8216;accumulate&rsquo; their wealth, did they, according to you and your fellow marxists.  Assets such as a home and savings account are not the result of years of sacrifice, hard work, deferment of pleasure and living below one&rsquo;s means, are they?</p>
<p>Behavior, of course, explains NOTHING to IDIOT elites such as shapiro.</p>
<p>Saving for a child&rsquo;s college education, one&rsquo;s retirement, or unforeseen disaster is a WHITE thing.   Whites who were too stupid, or did not have the foresight to plan for and accumulate the necessary supplies and protect what they&rsquo;d amassed for the long, dark, cold winter were &#8216;selected out&rsquo; during the last ice age.</p>
<p>Blacks did not evolve in the cold, unforgiving northern regions of the earth where &#8216;accumulating assets&rsquo; was a matter of life and death. Blacks lack the ability to plan for the future and to defer gratification; everything is today, for the here and now.  Assets are to be utilized immediately  &mdash;  only fools sacrifice for an unknown, unforeseen future.</p>
<p>About a month ago, a Larry Elder-type black came to one of our professional developments to sell 403b plans  &mdash;  he was promoting the same 403b plan that I have.  He told me after the meeting that all of the black teachers he had ever met and in turn tried to help had drained their 403b plans the second they were able and not one was able to accumulate any principal  &mdash;  he said none of them understood the advantages of having a 403b and only saw it as a source of &#8216;easy&rsquo; money to be tapped repeatedly.</p>
<p>Whites and blacks are behaviorally different  &mdash;  but to explain this to the likes of elitists like shapiro is not possible.  His response would be to call any such person a Nazi.</p>

		<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;The report attributes part of the cause to the &ldquo;powerful role of persistent discrimination in housing, credit and labour markets. African-Americans and Hispanics were at least twice as likely to receive high-cost home mortgages as whites with similar incomes,&rdquo; the report says. </p>
<p>Now, THAT&rsquo;S a big load of propaganda. Why does this report not mention the Community Reinvestment Act signed by Jimmy Carter (1977) and expanded by Bill Clinton (1995), and the resulting subprime mortgage mess fueled by the socialist-Democrat&rsquo;s decades-long &#8220;affordable housing&#8221; campaign that was intended to especially benefit nonwhites at the expense of whites? </p>

<p>This sentence shows the absurd left wing bias of the <i>Guardian</i>.  It correctly states that whites have on average significantly greater assets than blacks in America.  Then it states as a fact that this is due to racial discrimination and policies that favor the affluent.  Other factors, such as lower black IQ, less willingness to defer gratification among blacks, vastly higher rates of black illegitimacy, and so forth, are not even considered as explanations.</p>

     &#8220;&hellip;one of the most disturbing aspects of the study is that wealth among the highest income African Americans has actually fallen in recent years, dropping from a peak of about $25,000 to about $18,000, while among White counterparts of similar class and income it has surged to around $240,000.&#8221;<br>

<p>&#8220;Among the most startling revelations in the wealth data is that while single white women in the prime of their working years (ages 36 to 49) have a median wealth of $42,600 (still only 61 percent of their single white male counterparts), the median wealth for single black women is only $5.&#8221;</p>

		<p>you would have to live in Europe to get the incredible irony of this ridiculous article.</p>
<p>Europeans used to love it when Americans would beat their breasts over black failure.</p>
<p>this kind of article is less popular now, because in the meantime, the Europeans have acquired their own dysfunctional Third World minorities, and have discovered that European social democracy is no more capable of remodeling them into a modern citizens in our system is.</p>
<p>in a single generation, most of Western Europe has been overrun by incredibly dysfunctional minorities, who are for the most part dependent on the state from from cradle to grave, who have high birth rates, high crime rates, and low IQs, and you have no compunction about imposing their often bizarre customs on their host countries - all the way from wife beating to genital mutilation to human sacrifice.</p>
<p>Europeans are in shell shock from this onslaught.</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re no longer in a position to point the finger at United States for its &#8220;treatment&#8221; of its minorities.</p>

		<p>There was a book that was out a couple of years ago that explained how the modern WASP work ethic came to be.  It talked about how in England in the very late Middle Ages through the 1700s there was a culture that developed in which thrift, accumulation and passing on of assets became the norm for those who wanted to survive.  Any family that didn&rsquo;t work hard and save was doomed to failure and early death, and because resources were scarce, the pressure to change habits caused an ethic of hard work to develop that was far beyond what typical societies around the world had developed.</p>
<p>(For example, southern Europeans didn&rsquo;t develop this new cultural system, but much of northern and Western Europe did.)</p>
<p>America has ridden that cultural wave from the 1700s to until very recently.  The World Wars disrupted our flow and the disillusionment coupled with greater economic prosperity has made many whites lazy and stupid - chasing after every material pleasure and vain activity.  </p>
<p>Diversity and social justice are merely outgrowths of the original hippie movement of &#8216;peace and love&rsquo; which while seemingly marxist in tone, is actually more rooted in the psychology of plenty and pleasure at all costs, a trait found in more tribal and violence-prone cultures.  In other words, the wave of WASP thrift and saving, while still found among many white Middle class families here in America, is waning.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is seen in the alarming number of white families who descend into the &#8216;Hip Hop&rsquo; lifestyle and become utter losers and mimick the cultural values of the black community.  That community, by the way, is burdened by a different set of cultural standards.  But it is not whitey&rsquo;s &#8216;fault&rsquo; that they didn&rsquo;t develop a cultural tradition of thrift, because that was made centuries ago in faraway Europe.  Africa never had such a culture to begin with, so no one took that from their ancestors who were unfortunately brought over here in chains.  (Though 95% of all Africans were brought to the Caribbean and Brazil and not to America.)  No one else around the world has adopted it, save for a few pockets in Asia.</p>
<p>The liberals want to move as many non-white children into white classrooms precisely because they want the minority children to &#8216;imbibe&rsquo; this magical cultural essence from them.  It&rsquo;s in all their literature and public pronouncements.  I read the other day a liberal piece on education that reiterated that.  Specifically it said that they wanted the black children to learn good study habits, a better work ethic and a culture of success from the white kids.</p>
<p>Trouble is, these things cannot be taught like that.  Culture is organic.  It changes slowly, over many centuries, and you can&rsquo;t just adopt new attitudes that will transform whole swaths of people in a permanent way.  You can put your kid in an all-Chinese school thinking it will turn him into a hard worker, but you have just as much chance that he will feel alienated and ostracized or pick up some bad habits from the kids in the class that you didn&rsquo;t intend.  Even worse, your kid might be the one holding everyone back because he&rsquo;s so slow and unprepared.</p>
<p>See how that works?  So all the remedies in the world won&rsquo;t change things.  Some liberals are even talking now about REMOVING black children from their families and sending them to year round boarding schools to get them out of the toxic environment of failure.  I wonder how they justify that.  In any case, this will be a struggle for all concerned for a long time.<br>

		<p>Simply not true about blacks not owning businesses before 1960. Simply not true at all. In fact after the laws were passed to eliminate &#8220;discrimination&#8221; a lot of black resturants and boarding houses had to close as the blacks could now deal with the white esablishments. I am from a small NC town that could mirror the fictional Mayberry. My 81 year old dad who remembers the past perfectly and the present not so well often tells the story of an upstanding self made wealthy black man in our small town in the 30s, 40s and 50s who owned several businesses including a bank and just about all the real estate and houses in the black section. He must have died before my time as I dont remember him but by all acounts was respected just as much in the white business community as thier own businessmen were. Long before civil rights legislation he was an integral part of both the white and black venues in our town. An interesting note that my dad remembers about him was that he had a latino wife who looked like a model and all who saw her thought was the most beautiful woman in the town. I am sure there are stories everywhere similar to this which proves that blacks who work hard and conform to societal norms can make it in any era. KF     </p>

<p>That statement is so stupid that it isn&rsquo;t even wrong.</p>
<p>The first black millionaire in the US was the woman who invented hair-straightener.  Even in old Dixie, some wealthy blacks owned their own farms, and owned slaves to work on those farms.  Inventing and marketing hair relaxer is certainly a business, and any farm large enough to require slaves - or hired farmhands, for that matter - is by any definition a corporate farm, and therefore a business (and a successful one, given what slaves cost - a thousand dollars, back when that was real money).</p>
<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, black-owned small businesses included boarding houses, newsstands, barber shops, shoe repair, and the like.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Although many black families have moved up to better-paying jobs, they begin with fewer assets, such as inheritance, on which to build wealth. They are also more likely to have gone into debt to pay for university loans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh God, where do I start!! I, like almost all of my friends, were the first in their families to go to college, paid their way through, and paid off their loans, often (as did I) raising a family at the same time.  NONE of us inherited anything.  We lived within our means, scratched together what little monies we could for down payments on tiny little houses - often &#8220;fixer-uppers,&#8221; and got out of renting as quickly as we could, building equity.  I, personally, only bought what I could pay cash for, avoiding debt like the plague that it is - which made my first wife mad.  But to this day, all I own is mine, and I have no debt (including no mortgage). </p>

<p>How about High Blood Pressure?  And how about all the myriad illnesses that their improvident behavior eventually visits upon them?  That eventuality comes extremely early for blacks, who collectively view fifty as being &#8216;old&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Black cooking is notoriously unhealthy, even beyond &#8220;eatin&rsquo;dat Poke-meat&#8221;.  Everything is cooked until it is brown. &#8216;Smoked&rsquo; is the preferred state for meats.  Sugar is added to the mushy, brown vegetables. Aside from the few &#8216;vegetables&rsquo; they boil to mush, everything is Fried.  Sugar is added to everything&hellip;even prepackaged things that were already laden with Sugar.  And it all tends to be washed-down with sugary Bubblewater, out of giant, two liter bottles.  That&rsquo;s the regular meals.  Snacks tend to be candy, and more colored sugar water.  </p>
<p>I see blacks whom I dearly love, being dragged under by their own bodies.  I tried, decades ago, to get them to eat like I do.  But they wouldn&rsquo;t listen&hellip;or couldn&rsquo;t comprehend.  It&rsquo;s sad to see forty-year-olds wearing out, and fifty-somethings taking early retirement, because of their health problems.  Really sad.  Sadder still, are their Whale-like teens, already sentenced to lives on the Dialysis Machine, or taking Insulin.</p>
<p>And then, there are the cleaning products they squander money on.  We do our own cleaning, and seldom use more than a warm, damp rag; followed by a dry buffing cloth. No more is needed.  Cheaper, far healthier, and leaves no residue.</p>
<p>But blacks use copious and costly amounts of the smelliest, most enzyme-laden, toxic garbage you can imagine.  I have friends whose houses I will not enter, if the black housekeepers are there.  My sinuses go into overdrive, from all the garbage the maids smear around (they choose the cleaning products).  I would add that those friends, and their housekeepers, are being prematurely stricken with all manner of mysterious illnesses.  Being sick costs money.  Even when you&rsquo;re insured, it can wipe out your Net Worth.  Just one bout of serious illness could more than account for the gap in Net Worth.</p>
<p>But just a little experiment for Mr. Shapiro:  Delete &#8220;Black&#8221; from your article, and substitute &#8220;White&#8221;, then delete &#8220;White&#8221; from your article, and substitute &#8220;Jewish&#8221;.  All the usual explanations for why Jews do so well apply to other white people, too.  </p>
<p>There is nothing sinister, or &#8216;racist&rsquo; behind the fact that we invest in &#8216;shares&rsquo;, rather than in Jewelry or Sports Memorabilia.  There is nothing sinister about the fact that we watch every penny.  There is nothing evil or discriminatory about the prudent manner in which most of us conduct our lives.  We should be praised and congratulated for our success; not reviled and disenfranchised.</p>

<p>You bring up an extremely important point  &mdash;  one that infuriates me  &mdash;  and that I read over and over and over in the media to explain away the wealth disparity between White and black wealth:  </p>
<p>The myth that Whites  &mdash;  ALL OF US  &mdash;  are &#8216;born with privilege and wealth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>What a laugh!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve even heard this myth repeated in teachers&rsquo; professional developments  &mdash;  this myth of automatic White wealth seems to be well entrenched in black and hispanic culture.  Good luck trying to change non-White minds when facts mean nothing to them and everything they know about us was learned from TV shows.</p>
<p>How many Whites received &#8216;inheritances&rsquo; that gave them an easy start in life?  D*** few I&rsquo;ll bet.  The vast majority of us that &#8216;have anything&rsquo; got it through hard work,  self sacrifice and a lifetime of living below our means  &mdash;  all this while the marxist government tries to strip our assets away from us and redistribute them to those who didn&rsquo;t earn it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve encountered so many black/hispanic teachers and administrators who believe that I am rich (because I am White) that I am privileged (because I am White) I have SO much (because I am White) I&rsquo;ve never had to work (because I am White) I live in a mansion (because I am White).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s laughable what they believe about us.</p>
<p>The truth is so far from these myths and lies and as most non-White minds are  closed to reality and I am tired of explaining myself,  I now tell them the following (in no particular order):  Yes, my father bought my teaching license for me so I wouldn&rsquo;t have to go to college, study hard, sacrifice and work for it.  The house that I own free and clear was &#8216;handed to me&rsquo; with property taxes excused for life, my car (with over 100,000 miles on it) just appeared one day in the driveway with the pink slip on the dashboard, with lifetime gas paid for.  The vacations I take every summer are paid for in full (by whom I don&rsquo;t know! A White benefactor, I guess).</p>
<p>The ridiculous thing is&hellip;..They believe me!</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s assume that $300 million is pre-tax, so Tyson actually got to take home about $180 million.  I doubt that he has so many cousins that it took more than a few million to get them all through college (at $100,000 apiece, that would be 30 cousins).  I&rsquo;d be surprised if he spent more than three times that amount on orphans.  So it looks like about $165 million has slipped through the cracks.  Had Tyson put $170 million into bonds and preferred shares (spending $10 million on riotous living), he could be earning a nice, safe, boring 5% a year, or about $8.5 million every year, forever.  That would pay for a lot of orphans and indigent cousins.</p>

		<p>This is my first post on AmRen. I have been reading AmRen daily for the past few months but was moved to comment on the responses to this article. I just want to say &#8220;THANK YOU&#8221; to everyone for the interesting and enlightening explanations for the black/white wealth gap. Each comment made it easier to see how racial propensities (which I have read about in &#8220;A Race Against Time&#8221;) translate perfectly into this real life scenario. It all rings true.</p>

		<p>Black women often have a child at a young age (teens or early twenties) while unmarried, and then one or more children much later, with different fathers, etc., often ending with having their final child in their late thirties or early 40s.  The early child interrupts their schooling and the start of their career, especially because they are unmarried.  The later born children mean that the mother is still supporting children through her &#8220;prime earning years.&#8221;  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like a guy who gets divorced when his first two children are teenagers, marries a much younger woman, and has two more children.  When he is 70 years old, his net worth will be a FRACTION of what it would have been if he had had four children with his first wife and stayed married to her.  </p>
<p>The money from the prime earning years can help you build a decent nest egg, even if you have made a lot of financial mistakes earlier in life.  But if you end up raising a second set of children (or raising grandchildren) you miss out on your last realistic chance to accumulate assets.</p>

		<p>Although many black families have moved up to better-paying jobs, they begin with fewer assets, such as inheritance, on which to build wealth. They are also more likely to have gone into debt to pay for university loans.</p>
<p>This seems ominous - are whites now going to be punished for having frugal and prudent parents. It can&rsquo;t be fair for whites to get ahead from an inheritance - tax it away! </p>
<p>Blacks are at a disadvantage - their parents didn&rsquo;t sacrifice and save for their college educations - give them admittance and &#8220;scholarships&#8221; to level the playing field.</p>

		<p>Question Diversity #46, what a terrible thing for whites to do, try to improve the lot of a primitive stone-age people by educating their children so they can join the human race, exposing them to civilized food so they don&rsquo;t have to eat like Bear Grylls in the Outback, enlightening them to art not found on cave walls or music from anything else but a didgeridoo. The poor dears were robbed of their priceless heritage!  </p>

		<p>I grew up without a father, zero inheritance, (mom did buy a refrigerator for me) fairly unattractive.  I got through high school while working full time, and self-taught in the trade I entered and have never ever seen even a hint of &#8220;white privilege&#8221;, I have been denied loans, I have to fill out loan/job/credit apps, pass credit checks and jump through the same hoops just like everyone else, nothing was given to me just because I&rsquo;m white . I have a fair amount more asset wise than the $100k, and earned every single penny of it along with 5 kids. Why? because I don&rsquo;t make stupid choices, I don&rsquo;t break the law, and I&rsquo;m fairly intelligent. And you know what? a lot of whites did it this way, and many have a more difficult road than I did.  It&rsquo;s time to look at the failings of black instead of the success of white to find the answers.</p>

		<p>Ten years ago in China, I knew a black fellow who was &#8220;gifted&#8221;(by his black benefactor) a mid-high level position in the HR department of one of the American &#8220;big three&#8221; auto makers.  This person was making over 6 figures a year and worked for 5 years before returning to the US.  He left the company/China, not because he was fired(despite his inability to do even the most basic tasks, such as use Word or Excel)but because he felt the company should provide him with a raise, a car/driver, luxury villa, etc. and because he had his sights set on attending Harvard Business School(a difficult goal given the fact that he had only an abysmally low GMAT score of 400).  He returned to the US and 4 months later when I visited him there, he was essentially destitute, living in a small, dirty apartment where he was facing eviction and where the electric company had already terminated his service.  His Mercedes was hidden &#8220;off-sight&#8221; to prevent the repo-men from taking that.  During the time he was in China, he managed to save NOTHING.  Sadly, I think this example is more of the rule rather than the exception.</p>
