			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David N. Goodman and Ed White, WJBK-TV (Detroit), May 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox said Thursday that the Rev. Al Sharpton is staging a &#8220;drive-by at the scene of a tragedy&#8221; by speaking at the funeral for a seven-year-old girl shot by Detroit police.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it is disgusting for him to predict what someone is going to say at a eulogy where a family has invited a minister to come in,&#8221; Sharpton told The Associated Press.</p>
<p>In Twitter messages Tuesday, Cox said he was disgusted but not surprised by Sharpton&rsquo;s planned appearance Saturday at the funeral for Aiyana Stanley-Jones. Cox accused Sharpton of &#8220;exploiting tragedy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The attorney general, who is white, told AP that Sharpton &#8220;parachutes in to get his name in the paper,&#8221; then leaves after creating &#8220;a worse racial divide than existed before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He clearly is trying to be &#8216;Johnny on the spot&rsquo; and get on the news again and exploit the tragedy of a 7-year-old girl being shot in the city of Detroit,&#8221; Cox said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Michigan State Police are investigating the death of Aiyana, who was hit by an officer&rsquo;s bullet during a raid Sunday as police sought a suspect in the killing of a 17-year-old boy.</p>
<p>Cox said Sharpton&rsquo;s visit was premised on police misconduct that Cox said remains to be determined.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sharpton replied: &#8220;There has never been a history of me inciting any problems anywhere. For him to play politics and try to get votes off the deaths of two young people speaks more of him than it does me.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Sharpton never incited problems anywhere.Except in New York City, where he instigated a mass racial killing by arson of eight innnocent individuals because of their race. His nose is longer than that of OJ Simpson.</p>

		<p>Cox is probably the next Governor of Michigan.</p>
<p>In 2006, he was the only state wide office holder AND the only MI Republican of major consequence to endorse MCRI, the anti affirmative action state ballot petition.  It won, and gosh golly, Cox was the only GOPer to win statewide in MI that day.</p>

<p>Oh, yes, Tawana Brawley was just one.</p>
<p>How about Jena, AL?  Wasn&rsquo;t it you who bussed thousands of rent-a-mobs to Jena in support of 6 attempted murders, calling the situation racism against them?</p>
<p>You know, I actually think you truly believe such an absurd claim, because you&rsquo;re too stupid to understand your own rhetoric and actions.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a perfectly exanple of, &#8220;Dumb is dangerous.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, that is the intention that Alfred has from the start.</p>
<p>Stir the pot which was nearly boiling over the top already and make it much worse that it is.</p>
<p>And then leaves, having caused a lot more trouble.</p>
<p>Jesse Jackson is the same way. Big mouth troublemaker like what was done in Decatur IL. Guy and his entourage and big vehicles speeding down the interstate daily hogging the road and making a scene. Makes trouble where it was not needed and then leaves - - those left behind having more hate and &#8220;the divide&#8221; being even much greater.</p>

		<p>This is how Sharpton (and J. Jackson) makes his money!!  He shows up and splits in record time at every racially charged event he can find.  He does not expose himself to much risk this way, but he gains maximum publicity.  Sharpton is not supporting anybody with this strategy - he&rsquo;s supporting his own bank acccount with the publicity that foolish liberal publications and TV news shows give him.</p>

		<p>Immediately following Cincinnati&rsquo;s 2001 racial &#8220;unrest,&#8221; Sharpton breezed in to pronounce our town as &#8220;ground zero for racial profiling.&#8221;</p>
<p>He conveniently ignored all the Afro-shenanigans that had stoked the natives into a dangerously &#8220;restless&#8221; mob; and while he may not personally have incited the riots, it was gasoline, not water he was pouring onto the fire. </p>
