			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Teresa Watanabe and Patrick McDonnell, Los Angeles Times, May 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Galvanized by Arizona&rsquo;s tough new law against illegal immigrants, tens of thousands of marchers took to the streets in Los Angeles on Saturday as the city led the nation in May Day turnout to press for federal immigration reform.</p>
<p>As many as 60,000 immigrants and their supporters joined a peaceful but boisterous march through downtown Los Angeles to City Hall, <b><a href="#flag">waving American flags,</a></b> tooting horns and holding signs that blasted the Arizona law. {snip}</p>
<p>Though the crowd was roughly half as large as police had projected, it was the largest May Day turnout since 2006, when anger over federal legislation that would have criminalized illegal immigrants and those who aid them brought out more than 1 million protesters nationwide. Since then, most activists have deemphasized street actions in favor of change at the ballot box through promoting citizenship and voter registration.</p>
<p>But this year is different. Outrage over the Arizona law, continued deportations and frustration over congressional delay in passing federal immigration reform prompted activists nationwide to urge massive street protests on this traditional day of celebrating workers&rsquo; rights.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rallies in more than 90 other cities drew thousands of people from New York to Phoenix. In Washington, D.C., thousands cheered as 35 immigration rights advocates, including U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.), were arrested in front of the White House after they disobeyed police orders by sitting on the sidewalk along Pennsylvania Avenue, calling on President Obama to move immigration reform forward.</p>
<p>But the national epicenter for opposition to the Arizona law has become Los Angeles. City officials have called for a boycott of the state, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony has likened the law to Nazism, and activists put aside past differences to stage a unified march. Five coalitions representing more than 150 labor, faith and immigrant rights organizations worked closely with Spanish-language media to publicize the call to rally, according to Angelica Salas of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the march&rsquo;s City Hall endpoint, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa took the stage to raucous cheers. Speaking in English and Spanish, he called Los Angeles a &#8220;bilingual city&#8221; and expressed strong support for immigrants&rsquo; rights.</p>
<p>Afterward, Mahony took the microphone. &#8220;Everyone in God&rsquo;s eyes is legal,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are all standing with our immigrant brothers and sisters.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a major theme of the day, one man wore a white T-shirt reading &#8220;Todos Somos Arizona,&#8221; or &#8220;We Are All Arizona.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The marchers also included African American union members, Korean drummers dressed in colorful traditional garb and even a white educator hoisting a sign that read &#8220;Gringos for Immigrants&rsquo; Rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>One illegal immigrant from South Korea, who asked to be identified by his first name, Jeff, said he came to protest the &#8220;broken-down immigration system.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This does not just affect Latinos,&#8221; said Jeff, wearing a white shirt that crossed out the word &#8220;minutemen.&#8221; &#8220;This affects all communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A couple of dozen counter-protesters carried signs that read &#8220;Deport Illegal Mexicans,&#8221; &#8220;Remember the Alamo, Mexico,&#8221; &#8220;Boycott Mexico&#8221; and &#8220;Mexico Out of US.&#8221;</p>
<p>Claudia White, 56, a Tucson resident and naturalized Mexican immigrant who organized the counter-protest, said she supported the Arizona law because she worried about the consequences of what she called &#8220;open-border policies.&#8221; Recent immigrants, she said, show &#8220;less of an interest in how this country was originally set up  &mdash;  where everybody is an individual and doesn&rsquo;t identify as part of a group or a block or a race.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A handful of people supporting the law trickled in during the day and often had to leave under police escort after being surrounded by agitated demonstrators.</p>
<p>Amelia Sally, a 35-year-old customer service representative, held a sign that read: &#8220;Got Your Papers? If So .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Welcome.&#8221; She was disheartened at the way demonstrators around the country were bashing her state.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it is all about the words you use!</p>
<p>I translate the above sentence as follows:</p>
<p>&lsquo;A brave group of patriots supporting the law trickled in during the day and often had to leave under armed police protection after being surrounded by these diabolical invaders, intent on terrorizing or even murdering them.&rsquo;</p>

<p><br>
Ah yes&hellip;but how many &#8220;supporters&#8221;?  This is the million dollar question.  The implication is many and that this is an issue of some controversy.  The truth is somewhat far from that though.  For almost none of those who showed up were not criminal immigrants.  Not even legitimate immigrants support these people.  In other words, no one who votes.  Making this a very interesting issue for the upcoming elections indeed.</p>
<p>In fact, the head immigration problem person in government (one senator Menendez from New Jersey) is in a bit of a pickle.  Despite a legal challenge he presented, a recall vote will probably be on the ballot this year, courtesy of the tea party in New Jersey.  They need 1.3 million signatures to get that on the ballot.  A poll by Rasmussen Reports gives some strong evidence that they will be successful and Menendez will be removed from office.  Quite a feat in ultra-liberal New Jersey.</p>
<p>How/why is this happening?  Because immigration is NOT a controversial issue.  There is broad consensus among whites, blacks, republicans, democrats, left, right and even hispanics.  We want these drug dealing types gone and we correctly identify them as the number one factor in the economic meltdown of the country.  They bring nothing but violence, drugs and mayhem to the US and not all the propaganda on the media will trick Americans into not knowing the truth of this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be issue one in this year&rsquo;s elections (although you won&rsquo;t see much of this on the news).  You will know what&rsquo;s happening when you read (back on page 10) in your local newspaper about Robert Menendez being removed from office in New Jersey by recall vote.  No mention will be given about his political views, motivations and behaviors.  Maybe FOX news will do a bit on him.</p>

		<p>Just the fact that this can even happen is proof positive this war is already, for all intents and purposes, virtually lost. We gave it all away - we didn&rsquo;t fight it when we had the chance - we got lazy, complacent, decadent. Unless a miraculous revival of White Spirit is awakened and this brown horde battled back to their primitive places of origin, this is a fait accompli. And I&rsquo;m not holding my breath&hellip;</p>

		<p>What no one seems to understand, or wants to admit, is that amnesty will not stop the flow of illegals.  Nor will guest worker programs, or anything else except closing the border.  The reason is that too many of the illegals are just too smart to keep working the slave wages jobs forever.  Lots of them discover the opportnities this country offers and move on to higher paying jobs; some even start their own business.  The point is the business that depends on  low-wage illegals need to constantly replace the ones that have moved up the economic ladder.  Amnesty will only give the Demorats the extra votes they need to become the permanent majority part.  Of course that has been the real objective all along.</p>

		<p>I took the Red Line subway on Saturday and saw a bunch of these people with red T-shirts saying &#8220;Legalize Arizona&#8221; and &#8220;Legalize America&#8221; .  They were carrying identical little plastic American flags, the cheapest kind of thing.  Not the sort of flag that anyone would actually own.  That big banner in the photo is the real thing.  </p>

<p>Peaceful? So they were expecting violence? Let&rsquo;s read between the lines here, shall we? Obviously, they&rsquo;re often not so peaceful! Of course, when they&rsquo;re not peaceful, this is just the outward expression of a natural frustration caused by our dastardly immigration laws! </p>
<p>And what is this &#8220;boisterous&#8221; business? It doesn&rsquo;t take a genius to realize this is  a euphemism for loud, raucous, in your face, and possibly even profanity laced ranting  &mdash;  defiant, hysterical, with a sense of entitlement  &mdash;  need I go on?</p>

		<p>I read alot of defeatism over mexican immigration by white nationalists.  I don&rsquo;t get it.  A rather large number of them have left our country within the last couple of years and the entire nation is turning anti-immigrant in the extreme.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s the controlled media.  It does a fine job of blasting misinformation 24/7 and rarely covers the fact that whites are turning militant over the last few months and that states seem to be ready to challenge the federal government for the first time since before the world wars.</p>
<p>There is real opportunity here.  The system &#8220;they&#8221; use to keep us in check is breaking down.  And more people are awake than have been for a very long time.  If whites could be convinced to ramp up reproduction, we could see some major change in our lifetimes. </p>

<p>Try googling these for an historical analogy as to where we are today. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting how many of the political and religious elites of the USA   &mdash;   as represented by the mayor and the cardinal   &mdash;   were on the same side as the invaders. Nothing unique in this, when you consider how a sizable chunk of the media, the universities, the corporations, et alia, are also lined up with them.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another interesting item: the city of Los Angeles is considering cracking down on voter-approved medical marijuana clinics. Yet the mayor, the cardinal and the rest of the gang seem to have little interest in protecting the liberties of California&rsquo;s citizens, i.e., the right to access alternative medications.</p>
<p>Perhaps they are unconnected, but these two examples are one more symptom of Sam Francis&rsquo; anarcho-tyranny. The establishment protects the rights of criminal trespassers, while treating American citizens as criminals. </p>
<p>Makes you kinda think, doesn&rsquo;t it&hellip;</p>

		<p>It is my understanding the the Arizona law is modeled from the Federal law.  And that the key issue is if the Feds are not enforcing the law, can the States enforce it if it is recast as State law.  Further the US Federal and Arizona laws are far less draconian than Mexico&rsquo;s and Quebec&rsquo;s.  As for discrimination, just because the majority of illegals crossing our Southern border are Mexicans doesn&rsquo;t mean its discriminatory.  The rally is about self-interest to the exclusion of others.  It would take a very brave person to counter-rally among that group.</p>

		<p>It is fascinating to watch the mightiest country on the face of the earth convulse itself over a stupid issue like anchor babies. How could this have become lawful, to steal citizenship in this manner? Americans need to grow a backbone very quickly!

		<p>&#8220;Immigration&#8221;, my butt!   Call it what it is: Invasion.  Calling it anything else is the equivalent of calling the pictured flag an American flag.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Broken immigration&#8221; system?  What a pile of horse-squeeze!!  Those people are completely disregarding our system, and our sovereignty.  The only thing that&rsquo;s broken is our response to foreign invaders. </p>
<p>These &#8220;protesters&#8221; are protesting the existence of White America.  But they are not merely protesting it: they have acted.  They have invaded!  </p>
<p>Reinforcements arrive all the time, and they are demanding we surrender control of the areas they occupy, and threaten (not idly!) to cause trouble (in OUR country!) if we dare to do things (in OUR country!) they don&rsquo;t like.  Not that they aren&rsquo;t causing trouble already.  </p>
<p>They are not &#8220;marching on May Day&#8221;, they are marching on us.   It is axiomatic: look where they are putting their feet down, and their flag up.   We need to respond in a far more dramatic fashion; for example, by enacting and enforcing laws that mirror Mexican laws regarding illegal aliens.   Perhaps we should also reciprocate the rallying of &#8220;thousands of of people in more than 90 cities&#8221; across their country as well.   </p>
<p>After all, what&rsquo;s good for the goose is good for the gander, right?<br>

		<p>It appears as though the age-old term &ldquo;culture clash&rdquo; fails to register upon the consciousness of our Washington communist multiculturalists.  </p>
<p>Our Founding Fathers knew all about the divisiveness and disunity caused by different cultures pursuing contrary agendas in the same country.  </p>
<p>Hence our national motto is E Pluribus Unum: &ldquo;Out of many (cultures)&hellip; one (culture).&rdquo;  </p>
<p>Our Washington communist Globalists traitors are doing everything in their power to pervert this concept into: &ldquo;Out of one (culture)&hellip; many (cultures).&rdquo;   </p>
<p>This is key to their &ldquo;divide and conquer&rdquo; stratagem that is intended to Balkanize and destroy us&hellip;  </p>
