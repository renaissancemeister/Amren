<h1><a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2010/0505/Bah-humbug-say-Mexicans-about-Cinco-de-Mayo">Bah Humbug, Say Mexicans About Cinco De Mayo</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sara Miller Llana, Christian Science Monitor, May 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite popular misconception in the US, today is not Mexico&rsquo;s Independence Day. May 5 instead marks the anniversary of the 1862 Battle of Puebla when the Mexican Army defeated the French. Compared to Sept. 16, the day Mexico commemorates its independence, or Easter week, or even upcoming Mother&rsquo;s Day, Cinco de Mayo is practically a non-event.</p>
<p><b>Turning nothing into something</b></p>
<p>&#8220;It has been vastly commercialized on the [US] side of the border,&#8221; says Oscar Casares, who authored the novel &#8220;Amigoland&#8221; and teaches creative writing at the University of Texas at Austin. &#8220;They created this mythology of what it means to Mexicans when it is really a minor [holiday]. It is acknowledged but it certainly is not celebrated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Casares says the holiday found its way to the US in the 1950s and 60s, during the civil rights movement when Hispanic activists were attempting to foster goodwill between both nations and cultures. It was in the 1980s that marketers saw the holiday as a way to make a buck.</p>
<p>In Mexico, meanwhile, work goes on as normal, banks operate, and stores are open.</p>
<p>Not that the holiday is entirely ignored. {snip} But it&rsquo;s not an event that most Mexicans would travel far to see.</p>
<p><b>Bah humbug, say Mexicans</b></p>
<p>&#8220;It is part of the history of our country,&#8221; says taxi driver Noel Perez in Mexico City, &#8220;but it is not relevant. The truth is we do not even know what it is we are celebrating. I do not even know why the French invaded Mexico.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>What they can agree on is that a holiday barely noticed in Mexico City has morphed into essentially &#8220;Mexican pride&#8221; day in the US, the same way that St. Patrick´s Day is celebrated. Like drinking Guinness on March 17, Americans today with no ties to Mexico will find a reason to eat tortilla chips and guacamole, many without being able to locate Puebla on a map.</p>

		<p>A buddy and I celebrate it in parody every year. We get a jumbo meal of Taco Bell takeout, play some Tijuana Brass CDs, and recite the following:</p>
<p>Shrimp burritos? Cool!<br>
Margaritas? Cool!<br>
Colorful cerapes? Cool!<br>
Mexican guy with a leafblower? NOT cool!!!</p>

<p>Like St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, CdeM has morphed into nothing more than a reason to drink large quantities of beer.</p>
<p>The Irish have a reputation as heavy drinkers. Is this a similar stereotype with Mexicans?</p>

		<p>But liberals in California (of course) have made sure that Americans can&rsquo;t be Americans by displaying the American flag in America on Cinco de Mayo. It offends foreign criminals living here illegally. </p>

		<p>All you have to do is look at any American calendar on May 5 and it says, &#8220;Battle of Puebla&#8221; (Mexico).  I.e., it&rsquo;s not a biggie.  The Mexicans in CA have trumped it up for political reasons.  I think a law should be enacted that forbids the displaying of any national flag except the American flag in this country.  The Cinco de Mayo gente would be wildly p**sed, but it&rsquo;d be a step towards teaching them proper behavior while in the USA.  Those who don&rsquo;t like it can go home.</p>

		<p>Why is it celebrated so enthusiastically north of the Rio Grande? </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know for sure, but I think that its commerating the defeat of White men by Mexicans is a factor.</p>

		<p>There is a special significance to this date in history we are not aware of?</p>
<p>Napoleon III hoped to enter the American Civil War on the side of the South.</p>
<p>Napoleon hated the U.S. and wanted to destroy it. Wanted to use Mexico as a staging round for his troops. The Battle of Puebla drastically upset the timetable for the French military and intervention on the part of the French became impossible. When the Civil War in the U.S. was still being fought, Union troops shed their uniforms, kept their weapons, WERE SENT BY BOAT TO MEXICO, fought with the Mexicans against the French AND MARCHED THROUGH MEXICO CITY AS PART OF THE VICTORY PARADE WHEN THE FRENCH WERE FINALLY OUSTED.</p>

<p>I have &#8220;fond&#8221; memories of having to step over many a Mexican who was &#8216;sleeping it off&rsquo; on the steps leading up to the #7 train every Monday morning here in Zoo York City.  It&rsquo;s not an uncommon sight during the warmer months.</p>
<p>I am so grateful I don&rsquo;t have to use the subways, anymore.</p>

		<p>Cinco De Mayo is like the Hispanic version of Kwanzaa, only some Hispanics, in America at least, actually do &#8220;celebrate&#8221; the &#8220;holiday,&#8221; as opposed to Kwanzaa, which outside of schools and media outlets is celebrated, or even widely acknowledged by no one! Aren&rsquo;t identity politics and multiculturalism grand?!  </p>

		<p>I have always heard the U.S. liked that holiday because the defeat benefited the U.S. Government at that time:</p>
<p>From Wikipedia:<br>
Some historians have argued that France&rsquo;s real goal was to help break up the American Union, at the time in the midst of a civil war, by helping the southern Confederacy:[23] &#8220;The Mexicans had won a great victory that kept Napoleon III from supplying the confederate rebels for another year, allowing the United States to build the greatest army the world had ever seen. This grand army smashed the Confederates at Gettysburg just 14 months after the battle of Puebla, essentially ending the Civil War.&#8221; The consequence of Cinco de Mayo to the United States has been thus recognized:&#8221;The defeat of the French army had consequences for America as well&hellip;the French defeat denied Napolean III the opportunity to resupply the Confederate rebels for another year.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Why don&rsquo;t we celebrate other important battles that took place in May.</p>
<p>Mexican American War:</p>
<p>&#8220;On May 8, 1846, General Zachary Taylor defeated a detachment of the Mexican army in a two-day battle at Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma.&#8221;</p>

<p>Why the heck should we care about some battle in Mexico to drive out the French?</p>

		<p>Simply put, then, the conclusion is Mexicans in Mexico don&rsquo;t even recognize the &#8220;holiday&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s only HERE in America that Mexicans from Mexico (mostly illegally here) recognize and DEMAND the holiday be celebrated as an exclusively, &#8220;in your face&#8221; reconquesta &#8220;holiday&#8221;.  Kinda like thousands of Mexican invaders giving Americans the finger. </p>
