			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Todd Wright, WTVJ-TV (Miami), May 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>If you are looking for a way to beat Arizona&rsquo;s new immigration law, look no further than Miami&rsquo;s new Gringo Masks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The product is simple. Choose from a cut out of a blue-eyed, sandy hair-colored white guy or a green-eyed, blond haired white woman.</p>
<p>Cut the face to fit yours. Poke out the eyes. And presto! You don&rsquo;t look like a &#8220;suspicious, potentially illegal&#8221; alien. Rubber band or green card not included.</p>
<p>The Gringo Mask was not created for profit, says Zubi [Zubi Advertising, a Miami advertising agency] execs, but for purpose. It&rsquo;s one of the nation&rsquo;s leading Hispanic advertising agency&rsquo;s ways of showing it disapproves of Arizona&rsquo;s new law.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Now we could see how some might find the mask offensive  &mdash;  kind of along the lines of the infamous &#8220;Illegal alien with green card&#8221; Halloween costume of last year.</p>
<p>But Zubizarreta and her brother, Joe, said with traditional protests like marches and boycotts already in full swing, the Gringo Mask was another direct way of getting the message across.</p>
<p>&#8220;The spirit in which we conceived Gringo Mask,&#8221; Zubizarreta said, &#8220;was not to offend anyone. We wanted to start a dialogue.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Gringo Mask, along with instructions in Spanish and English, can be found at www.gringomask.com</p>

		<p>I hope these mask work. Maybe if &#8221; Third world populations&#8221; wear it then they will do better in school, stop committing crimes, stop having several kids that they can&rsquo;t afford or feed, and will be less violent.  I love daydreaming. </p>

		<p>Funny how it works.  Every Cuban that I have ever seen you would be hard to tell from Italian or Mediterranean.  Certainly they don&rsquo;t look at all like Mexican indians and every one that I have ever talked to has had a conservative outlook.  This particular ad agency seems to be pandering to so called hispanics to drum up business as most Cubans are against illegal immigration and communism unlike the president and his party. </p>

		<p>Then maybe I&rsquo;ll create a &#8220;black mask&#8221; (but call it something else) and see how that goes.  I&rsquo;ll market it for whites who wish, for whatever reason, to venture into certain areas of Detroit or D.C.</p>

		<p>This is going to raise the ire of many whites, and those that never took much offense at anything could well do so now.</p>
<p>This mestizo who thought this idiotic scheme up must be the same one who thought running down the streets with the Mex flag held high overhead would win the hearts and minds of the Gringos.</p>
<p>Notice that non-whites seem to ALWAYS regard blond-hair and blue eyes as their exact polar opposites?</p>
<p>This could backfire as well.  </p>

<p>Illegal and otherwise &ldquo;undocumented,&rdquo; invaders really should not have &ldquo;traditional protests like marches and boycotts&rdquo; open to them, let alone stunts like this &ldquo;Gringo Mask&rdquo; nonsense. In reality, who are they to demand or protest anything?</p>
<p>The answer is quite clear to me, they are at best an infection that needs cauterizing, preferably with blowtorches.</p>
<p>Any who say differently, are filthy Communists and wretched traitors!</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t like we are discussing &ldquo;tea time,&rdquo; in other words!!!</p>

		<p>Aren&rsquo;t blacks against immigration? In fact, aren&rsquo;t most of the real problems, at least with violence, black vs hispanic?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t they use card board cut-outs of black faces?</p>
<p>In fact, I think that&rsquo;s discriminatory, to use one race and not another. They&rsquo;re discriminating against african americans. Someone should bring this insensitivity to their attention, so they can be sure and use some appropriate black faces. </p>

<p>Exactly. In most locales, wearing a mask in public is against the law unless it is part of a gala event.</p>
<p>Well, all life is a gala event to some, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

		<p>At least they&rsquo;re admitting their understanding that a Gringo looks like a White American; in other words, Gringos (&#8220;Americans&#8221;) are (supposed to be) White.</p>
<p>To Hispanic Americans of Latin America, Gringos make up the people of the nation that is politically embodied as the USA, which makes it a White nation, so apparently they agree with us on that issue.<br>

<p>A very dark wig, special make-up to make one&rsquo;s skin tone brown, and a top that looks like a very hairy chest, with a shirt worn unbuttoned all the way down to the navel. Plus, a baseball cap, of course.</p>
<p>Gun and ammunition not included.</p>
