BOND Action<br>
213-804-1872<br>

<p>LOS ANGELES, May 3 /Christian Newswire/  &mdash;  BOND Action, a cultural action organization, which exists to educate, motivate and rally Americans to greater involvement in the moral, cultural and political issues that threaten this country, has come out in full support of Arizona&rsquo;s immigration law, SB1070. President Barack Obama has criticized the bill. Left-wing black activists Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson have compared the state to &#8220;Nazi Germany&#8221; and the law as equivalent to a form of &#8220;terrorism.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;President Obama and his race-hustling friends oppose SB1070 because they want amnesty for the more than 12-million illegal aliens in the U.S. which would create another Democratic Party voting-bloc and help them attain their goal of permanent power,&#8221; said BOND Action Founder and President, Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson. &#8220;This Arizona law is a direct result of the Obama administration&rsquo;s failure to enforce existing federal immigration laws. Those injecting race into the debate are left-wing-ideologues motivated by a political agenda.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Arizona law mirrors federal law, which requires non-citizens to register and carry their identification with them and says that violating federal immigration law is now a state crime as well. It allows police to only ask about immigration status in the normal course of lawful contact with a person, such as a traffic stop or if they have committed a crime. According to federal government estimates Arizona has had one of the fastest growing illegal immigration populations in the country increasing from 330,000 in 2000 to 560,000 by 2008.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sharpton, Jackson and Obama administration officials are misleading the public about this law in hopes of preventing other states from following Arizona&rsquo;s lead. Seventy-percent of Arizona&rsquo;s citizens support the law. It&rsquo;s not designed to racially profile or discriminate. I commend the lawmakers and citizens for taking the necessary course of action on this issue,&#8221; Rev. Peterson said.</p>

		<p>In related news, the MLBPA (Major League Baseball Players Association, the players&rsquo; union) has come out against SB 1070.  It could be that so many of them are Caribbean Hispanic, but they all have to get legal visas in order to play in the U.S., so they can&rsquo;t be impacted on a personal level. </p>
<p>I happen to think that they think it won&rsquo;t be as easy to get steroids, if the drug trade is hurt by the enforcement of this law and what will surely be equivalent laws in other states.</p>

		<p>I am not impressed.</p>
<p>When blacks start raising a stink about being ethnically cleansed from many neighborhoods and demand a military response for being targeted for murder and mayhem as a way to drive them from their neighborhoods, then I&rsquo;ll take notice.</p>
<p>Until then, my belief will be any race issues raised  by them are pure hucksterism.  They loudly proclaim white racism where non exists, purely to get more handouts.  But real racism&hellip;genocide being waged against them and the silence is deafening.</p>

<p>Apparently it&rsquo;s acceptable for the  Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson to say such things.  When Wicked Whites make the same observation, we&rsquo;re shouted down as Racists.<br>

		<p>I read something online about the Congressional black caucus supporting &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221;.  With so many black Congressmen in districts with heavy illegal alien and legal hispanic populations I doubt they&rsquo;re serious about it and are simply going through the motions as part of the rainbow solidarity. Amnesty would gut the CBC in 2012 with all those latinos voting in their own people.   </p>

		<p>Blacks are some of the biggest victims of the illegal invasion.  A key example is south Los Angeles where they have been pushed out and replaced by illegals.  The black employment rates have alsop  soared due to illegals. Blacks clearly do not want amnesty.  Therefore it seems strange that Obama tapped Jackson and Sharpton to take lead roles in pushing for amnesty.  Sharpton said he is going to organze &#8220;freedom rides&#8221; as in the civil rights movement in the south and pretty much suggests that he can rally blacks to push for amnesty.  Big Al may be in for a big surprise concerning black attitudes.  Black unemployment rates are sky high and the very last thing blacks wants in millions and millions legal Mexicans coming in to take the remaining few jobs that are available to blacks. Al and Jesse better get a clue!</p>

		<p>Jesse Lee Peterson is one of few black public figures with any common sense!  While blacks hate whites and want us to be gone, they know they can&rsquo;t live without us.  Plus, they know whites are nicer to them than the Hispanics are.  </p>

		<p>Well, AMEN to that!!!  These folks are absolutely right on; the Democratic Party wants as many Hispanics as they can get to be given amnesty and an automatic membership in their political party, which translates to one h**l of a lot of votes.  Clearly the Feds aren&rsquo;t going to help AZ in this mess.  I hope AZ has the huevos to hold on to their stand - it&rsquo;s supremely important for all of us other border states that they do.  </p>

		<p>Sounds suspiciously like Blacks are finally awakening from their stupor. Realizing illegal immigrants are emphatically NOT their amigos and brothers&hellip; but competitors determined to push them aside.</p>

		<p>As Clarence Darrow observed &#8220;History repeats itself. That&rsquo;s the sad thing about History&#8221;. In the late 19th century, waves of immigration from Eastern and Southern Europe put the freedmen at a disadvantage.  Booker T. Washington plead with businesses to &#8220;throw don your lunch pail where you are&#8221; and hire the former slaves, who had proven to be good workers in the past. But, there is a happy ending to this story.  After 1922, when reforms in the immigration laws greatly reduced the flow of unskilled labor into the US, the economic position of blacks improved dramatically, and at a greater rate than poor whites.  Let us hope history repeats itself this way also.</p>

		<p>To anonymous:  &#8220;Comprehensive Immigration Reform&#8221; is congressional code for AMNESTY.  Always has been.  If the existing laws were enforced stringently and the Feds were doing their job in that regard, there&rsquo;d be NO need for ANY &#8220;immigration reform&#8221; bill unless it was to pass a law denying citizenship to babies born to illegal aliens merely because they scurried across our border to drop their anchor baby.<br>
The other poster nailed it.  The reason most blacks and all Democrats are against enforcing the border, and are for amnesty, is to populate our country with enough aliens to keep them in power in perpetuity.  That makes them TRAITORS and their absolute unwillingness to enforce the border and federal laws is nothing less than TREASON against the sovereignty and laws of the United States and it&rsquo;s constitution.<br>
Period.</p>
