<h1><a href="https://www.blackamericaweb.com/?q=articles/news/baw_commentary_news/18501">Do Latinos Know We&rsquo;re &#8216;Brothers and Sisters?&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gregory P. Kane, Black America Web, May 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Why is the Rev. Al Sharpton butting his nose into Arizona&rsquo;s business?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dig these comments, taken from a news story on the Web site Reuters.com:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am first calling for the resignation and removal of Sheriff Arpaio. Harassment based on color is nothing short of racial profiling, which many of us helped fight to make against the law. Arpaio [Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County] needs to be confronted. He needs to be removed. We also need to suspend the law that he is using. We must stand with our brown brothers and sisters.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rev. Al probably didn&rsquo;t get this memo, but he shouldn&rsquo;t fret. Apparently much of black America didn&rsquo;t get it either. Our &#8220;brown brothers and sisters&#8221; in L.A. have been at war with black folks for at least the past four or five years. Few of us talk about it. None of our so-called leaders do.</p>
<p>To be fair to Sharpton, he did go to Los Angeles in September of 2005 to visit Jefferson High School, where our brown brothers and sisters weren&rsquo;t feeling their black kinfolk. The sentiment must have been mutual, because fights had broken out between Latinos and blacks the previous April.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not saying Sharpton shouldn&rsquo;t go to Arizona. If he feels that passionately about the Arizona law, perhaps he should. (For the record, I&rsquo;m very much for the law. My reading of American history says that a huge influx of non-black immigrants into the country is usually very bad news for black folks. Guess Rev. Al read some different history books.)</p>
<p>{snip} If black folks &#8220;stand with our brown brothers and sisters&#8221; in Arizona, what are they going to do for us?</p>
<p>Historically, some of our brown brothers and sisters have stood with whites, not us. I can&rsquo;t believe Sharpton hasn&rsquo;t read George Jackson&rsquo;s &#8220;Soledad Brother.&#8221; He either hasn&rsquo;t read it, or read it and glossed over Jackson&rsquo;s observation in a June 1970 letter to his lawyer about the situation in a television room at one of California&rsquo;s state penitentiaries.</p>
<p>Jackson made it clear where our &#8220;brown brothers&#8221; stood right on page 23: &#8220;The blacks occupy one side of the room, the whites and the Mexicans the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>On page 219, Jackson wrote of the television room that &#8220;the blacks had to sit in the rear.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. on hard, armless, backless benches while the Mexicans and the whites sat up front on cushioned chairs and benches with backrests!&#8221;</p>
<p>And on page 218, Jackson wrote some more of how Mexican-Americans used &#8220;brown-skin privilege&#8221; to their advantage: &#8220;When I hit the yard in &rsquo;62, the brothers were lining up in the rain, outside the protection of the shed that covers half the upper yard. The Mexicans and the whites had occupied all the lines under the shed.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} Considering the events Jackson described, and what is going on between blacks and Latinos in Los Angeles today, just why are we &#8220;standing with our brown brothers and sisters&#8221; in Arizona?</p>
<p>And when are they going to stand with their black brothers and sisters in Los Angeles?<br>

		<p>Lol&hellip;.the truth is that, if mexicans ever get real control of a chunk of the US, they plan genocide for the black population that doesn&rsquo;t immediately flee.</p>
<p>Their actions speak to this loud and clear.  Any mixed race neighborhood they gain a stronghold in, they immediately target the blacks for random murder and mayhem to intimidate (quite successfully I might add) to move out of the area.  This is NOT a gang thing.  It&rsquo;s extremely common for a non-criminal black to be yanked off the streat, planted face down on the group and shot in the back of the head, execution style&hellip;..as has been happening in parts of New Jersey with increasing frequency.</p>
<p>The ONLY reason this hasn&rsquo;t erupted into full scale race war is the media goes out of its way to scrub the news of these incidents or downplay the racial angle.</p>

		<p>This is a crock.  I&rsquo;m a tough old broad from L.A., and what I know is, it&rsquo;s the BLACKS who aren&rsquo;t willing to stand with their brown &#8220;hermanos y hermanas.&#8221;  As usual, old Al has it backwards.  I have seen a number of instances in which blacks brutalize Hispanics - it&rsquo;s an everyday occurrence here, just as is black-on-white violence.  The blacks stand alone because they CHOOSE to stand alone.  I don&rsquo;t know where Sharpie Al got his info, but it sure isn&rsquo;t from the streets of the LA that I know!</p>

Well, at least someone kind of gets it.</p>
<p>While blacks and browns my not be brothers, browns certainly aren&rsquo;t best friends with whites either.</p>
<p>Browns are interested in their own and not a partnership with whites against blacks.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Our &ldquo;brown brothers and sisters&rdquo; in L.A. have been at war with black folks for at least the past four or five years. Few of us talk about it. None of our so-called leaders do.&#8221;</p>
<p>The black brown war and murders have been in progress for a lot longer than 4 or 5 years.</p>
<p>The fighting and hate has accelerated dramatically the last 8 to 10 years, but the war is one of the best kept secrets the lamestream media has. It&rsquo;s going to get a lot worse no matter how much these black/brown leaders try to flim flam everybody into believeing they&rsquo;re all under the same umbrella.</p>
<p>Sharpton wants the appearance of a black/brown unity, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure he&rsquo;s dense enough to believe he might be able to also actually bring about a merger if he runs his mouth enough with these absurd pretenses at unification.</p>
<p>More and more every day this country is dividing further and further along lines of race.  It&rsquo;s a partial recipe for war.</p>
<p>Add the ingredients of social benefit cut-backs and a huge loss of jobs, and the concoction can be stirred just a bit and voila! We will have a nice home made civil war.</p>

		<p>I am constantly amazed at blacks who think they can find Hispanic allies in the black fight against whites. Hispanics care nothing for blacks and actually look down on them. Its whites who have what Hispanics want. Blacks have nothing to be envied. And blacks can&rsquo;t lay a &#8220;guilt trip&#8221; on Hispanics like they can on whites. Hispanics take jobs once held by blacks so its obvious the Hispanic invasion hurts blacks most of all. Apparently some black leaders think they will find Hispanic allies in their so-called struggle. Hispanics will use blacks when they think it is useful. But Hispanics will never have any real affection for blacks because why should they. They want black jobs and they continue to get them because Hispanics do better work and complain less. <br>

		<p>As far as I am concerned, Hispanics go which ever way the wind is blowing. We as whites should not be duped into thinking that Hispanics are our allies. They are all about one group HISPANICS. </p>
<p>Trust me, if they realize they can align themselves with Blacks or any other non-White group against us to achieve their goals, they will do so. </p>
<p>They are not our allies.</p>

		<p>Actually, upscale Blacks and Hispanics get along with one another very well. I have worked at law firms where I have seen Blacks and Hispanics refer to one another as brother and sister, go to lunch with one another,vacation with each other etc&hellip; I have a friend who is a college professor, he has recited similar stories of upper class Blacks and Hispanics being friendly to one another.</p>
<p>In the lower classes,that is probably a different story. </p>

		<p>Al Sharpton is basically campaigning for black dispossession at the hands of hispanics.  The higher powers want the various factions of the Democrat coalition to support amnesty but the black politicians know privately that it means loss of political power and resources and there&rsquo;s no shortage of White Democrats and Republicans who would support it.  It will be interesting to see how far these black politicians will carry this charade and that&rsquo;s when the liberals will go into crises mode.</p>

		<p>I like to look upon this confrontation between groups as you would look upon a confrontation in the natural world between two predators. Both groups are the &#8220;tough guy&#8221;. And the groups are coming into conflict with one another over turf and the right to be the dominant &#8220;tough guy&#8221;. There can be ONLY one &#8220;tough guy&#8221; on the block and if two exist at the same time, ONE must go, the other will prevail.</p>
<p>When wolves wsere re-introduced to Yellowstone, the first thing the wolves did was to KILL about half of the 2,000 coyotes already to be found in Yellowstone. Eliminate the opposition. Both were species, &#8220;tough guys&#8221;, competing on the same turf for the same prey. Cannot be two &#8220;tough guys&#8221; on the same turf at the same time. One must go when neither wants to go. But ONE WILL GO!!</p>

Yeah, it&rsquo;s a different story. As a long-time blue-collar worker in California I can tell you that it&rsquo;s a nightmare when you&rsquo;ve got blacks and mexicans on the same jobsite. They spend the entire shift alternatingly baiting each other and then complaining to the supervisor about the other one being racist. Meanwhile Whitey gets to do all the work.  </p>

		<p>Note that Sharpton is a New Yorker, where the dynamic is quite different than in LA. In NY the Spanish speakers tend to be Puerto Ricans and Dominicans, who are far less hostile to blacks than are Mexicans. Could the reverend be stupid and naive enough to actually think Mexicans are just like Puerto Ricans? I wouldn&rsquo;t put it past him.</p>

And I suppose that, when it&rsquo;s recorded, it&rsquo;s listed as a &#8220;white-on-black&#8221; crime, no doubt.  Ah, yes, those awful whites! Just nothing but trouble, they are.  Gotta do something about those whites.  Good occasion for more groveling and appeasements.</p>

<p><br>
No argument about that, but this  tri-racial picture, as presented in the story, is extremely over-simplified and unrealistic.  </p>
<p>In present-day America, the situation is complicated by Asians (of many types) and Moslems (of many types) and many other groups too; as well as the fact that so-called &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; themselves come in many types, and some don&rsquo;t even like each other. They will all want to have a say.  What a mess!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Ethan&#8221; I think that is more true accross the board with different racial groups - upper classes/more intelligent will get along better in general. </p>
<p>Of course most non-whites are in the lower classes and from what I have seen, black and brown do indeed have no love lost for one another. I have acquaintances from Honduras and Mexico(legal citizens)who cannot STAND blacks, and say it is very much this way in their countries of origin as well! The feelings seem mutual the other way as well. </p>

<p>I agree with you. All you have to do is watch televison. Rick Sanchez, Julie Banderas,Richard Vieques etc&hellip; they go gaga over any upscale Black person. I was watching one news program and there was a Hispanic journalist interviewing a Black college professor.    </p>
<p>Both men were admittedly classy looking. Nonetheless, the way the journalist was fawning all over the professor was pathetic.  You would think that they had a love affair going on. Let&rsquo;s not even begin to talk about how some of them go on about President Obama.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the majority of non-Whites see color first. We Whites are the enemy.</p>

		<p>Rev Al only does what is good for Rev Al, and the media attention on AZ is apparently too good for him to pass up.  As for black/brown alliances, these are nothing more than anti-white fantasies dreamed up by limo liberals.  The Hispanics themselves have little solidarity.  In Arpaio&rsquo;s tent jails, for instance, there is a gang for Mexican-Americans and a gang for Mexicans.</p>

I think Chicanos may respect whites somewhat more than blacks but I can&rsquo;t say they like them  &mdash;  at least in the Border States.

		<p>What that babbling buffoon Al Sharpton might want to do is to go alone into an all-Hispanic neighborhood and try to organize a rally or protest of some sort on behalf of &#8220;people of color.&#8221; My guess is the cartoonish ninny wouldn&rsquo;t get out alive.</p>
<p>The simple fact is that Hispanics regard blacks as a lower-life <br>
form and would view any proposal by blacks suggesting some sort of alliance as an absurdly presumptuous insult.  They want to kill them, not befriend them. </p>

<p>And #7:  &#8220;&hellip;Actually, upscale Blacks and Hispanics get along with one another very well&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>You have obviously never been in a mixed black/hispanic school where the students self-segregate in the lunch area, in classrooms and on the playing fields.  I saw no camaraderie between blacks and hispanics in the nine years I worked in one of these high schools.  The black staff also segregated themselves from everyone else.</p>
<p>In the students, I saw a deep, seething hatred between the two groups with name calling, racial intimidation, rude comments and shouts of &#8220;Go Back to Mexico!&#8221;  I was present for two riots  &mdash;  one on cinco de mayo because the black students felt dissed, another during a hispanic multi-culti day,  for the same reason.</p>
<p>I also, almost daily, heard about hispanics students being robbed of their lunch money, shoes, jackets and other possessions by blacks  &mdash;  that was inside the school. Outside the school, the black on hispanic robberies and thefts were at gunpoint.</p>
<p>A decade or two ago in LA, black brutalization of hispanics was common  &mdash;  very common  &mdash;   as  blacks objected to hispanics moving into Section 8 housing in black-majority Watts, Compton and other black-created hell-holes.  Black-majority schools began  changing culture from black-centric to hispanic-centric as hispanics flooded the schools  &mdash;   with ESL and bi-lingual programs sucking up massive amounts of educational dollars and mexican holidays prominently celebrated. Blacks don&rsquo;t want to share any part of the White paid-for entitlement pie and responded with violence.</p>
<p>These days, in LA, the hispanics have overwhelmed blacks via their huge numbers (LA is a sanctuary city with a mexican mayor)  &mdash;  and driven them out  &mdash;  Watts (61% hispanic) Compton (57% hispanic) and the former black corridor up the 110 freeway are now majority hispanic.  I don&rsquo;t know if there are any black-majority schools left  &mdash;  it would take me a long time to check, and I will stand corrected if there is a black-majority high school in LA, but I don&rsquo;t believe there is.</p>
<p>Hispanics, with long memories of the terror inflicted by blacks on themselves and their children, are ridding historic black areas of blacks through ethnic cleansing, ethnic intimidation, murder, mayhem and orders from the mexican mafia that doesn&rsquo;t want to share drug turf with blacks.</p>
<p>Black politicians in LA?  ALL support open borders, amnesty and sanctuary policies.</p>
<p>Yet blacks still haven&rsquo;t gotten the message that The Great White Bigot is not their greatest enemy, it is hispanics who once they get control,  as poster #1 stated so well, &#8220;they plan genocide for the black population that doesn&rsquo;t immediately flee.&#8221;</p>

<p>I think you are probably right.  Color makes a convenient marker to distinguish who is who.  Non-whites may not like each other   &mdash;   much   &mdash;   but they like us even less.</p>
<p>In fact, &#8220;liking&#8221; us is not precisely the issue. Envy and resentment are closer.  It&rsquo;s about who has the wealth and the power that others crave. In every case, in nature, contenders  for power always go after the Top Guy, not after the 3rd or 4th down.  In our society, the &#8220;Top Guy&#8221; is whites.  <br>
In short: we have it; they want it.<br>

&ldquo;Ethan&rdquo; I think that is more true accross the board with different racial groups - upper classes/more intelligent will get along better in general. </p>
<p>Of course most non-whites are in the lower classes and from what I have seen, black and brown do indeed have no love lost for one another. <br>
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ </p>
<p>That could be because &#8220;upper clases&#8221; are not under economic pressure. Their lives are confortable; they are well provided for and secure; and they do not feel exposed to any external threat from others, as poorer people may be.  Any disagreements with others are purely abstract and intellectual.   </p>
<p>Poorer people have to struggle for their existance. When there are only so many  jobs or benefits to go around, somebody is going to get left out. They have to fight to suvive.  Another point is that those &#8220;upper classes&#8221; tend to be softer, more conciliatory, and more fearful of any type of social confrontations. They&rsquo;ve been protected all their lives.  Bickering with others just isn&rsquo;t &#8220;good form&#8221;. They are also confined by notions of ethics and chilvary.  The lower classes don&rsquo;t care! They are street fighters and will do whatever it takes to get whatever they want.</p>
<p>Anyone who has ever dealt with a group of ghetto blacks, knows that there is absolutely NOTHING that they won&rsquo;t stoop to. Ethics and principles are not in their vocabulary.  </p>

		<p> &#8220;The simple fact is that Hispanics regard blacks as a lower-life <br>

<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely right there, John.   I had a friend  (Mexican-born but long-time American citizen)  who told me that, frankly, he did not consider them fully human.  He was frank about it.  He was slightly apologetic, but said he just couldn&rsquo;t help it.  He was, btw,  far more &#8220;prejudiced&#8221; than any American I have ever known.  And he didn&rsquo;t deny it or try to hide it.   He also hated West Indians and Chinese immigrants,  and lost no opportunity to let them know it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he was extremely touchy if anyone considered  him non-white.  Like most Latin Americans, he considered himself white.  He would have been infuriated at the insult if someone proposed a non-white alliance!</p>

		<p>&#8220;You are full of it. You know darn well if Blacks were being murderd by Hispanics execution style the way you described in New Jersey or anywhere else, the mainstream media would be all over it. Black politicans would be marching in the streets demanding chnage.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Indeed, this black-Hispanic alliance is a crock. I spoke to a real estate agent who told me that he used to show apartments to Puerto Ricans only on one side of the neighborhood because the whites on the other side didn&rsquo;t want them. When I asked him where he showed apartments to blacks, he replied, &#8220;Nowhere. Even the Puerto Ricans dont want them.&#8221;</p>

<p>When you have an alliance &hellip; even if it&rsquo;s purpose isn&rsquo;t clearly stated&hellip; it is always AGAINST somebody.  That is always the case. Why else have an alliance unless you&rsquo;re preparing for war?  </p>
<p>Therefore, the very fact there is an alliance should not be ignored by us. It should be considered virtually a declaration of war   &mdash;   which it  <b><i>is. </i></b> It means they are preparing to mount an attack.  We would be foolish to blithely ignore it.</p>

		<p>Re Al Sharpton is basically campaigning for black dispossession at the hands of hispanics.<br>
It will be interesting indeed to see if liberal self-loathing takes root in black Americans. This kind of racial self-denial will be alien thinking to blacks. Yet, this kind of thinking is a requirement for Democratic party allegiance. It is well known blacks possess the strongest collective instincts of any ethnic group as measured by their voting record when race is a factor. If push comes to shove, and it appears it has, to where will allegiance tend? I think black splinter groups may form a third black-only party, akin to South African parties. Very dangerous times ahead as the psychology lurches towards an &#8220;Uhuru&#8221; mentality.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s exactly why the anti-racist crowd doesn&rsquo;t harp on blacks or hispanic bigots.  They go after us because we are more successful because of our creativity and work ethic and not relying on the government to help us out.  Most blacks and hispanics are too lazy or too stupid to make the same level of success as whites.  The only rich hispanics or blacks make their money from extortion or selling degeneracy (like rap and hip hop for example)</p>

<p>Racial self denial, as you put it, is alien among all racial groups, even Whites.  White liberals are good at putting on a game face when it comes to race but it&rsquo;s obvious from where they live and the kind of schools they put their kids in, what they really think.  This is all a game of &#8220;let&rsquo;s pretend&#8221; and blacks, sooner than later, are going to figure out they&rsquo;re being sold down the river by proxies like Al Sharpton who represent the interests of the monied elite not the black community.  </p>
