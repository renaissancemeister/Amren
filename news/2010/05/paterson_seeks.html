<h1><a href="https://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/politics&amp;id=7421546">Paterson Seeks to Counter Deportation Laws</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WABC-TV (New York), May 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Gov. David Paterson stepped into the immigration debate Monday, saying he would create the nation&rsquo;s first &#8220;pardon panel&#8221; to investigate requests of legal immigrants facing deportation because of past convictions.</p>
<p>Paterson, proposing the measure as the nation is embroiled in conflict over an Arizona law that critics say would encourage racial profiling, said he would pardon immigrants if they meet requirements including rehabilitation and demonstrate they&rsquo;re not a danger to society.</p>
<p>Paterson is seeking to combat what he calls harsh and rigid federal measures that result in deporting of immigrants who have shown considerable rehabilitation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Paterson said he will seek to use a governor&rsquo;s pardon as a tool to blunt what he called the rigid federal rules for deportation even of immigrants who have successfully engaged in a new life in America.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure, there are some individuals whose crimes are egregious or who pose a threat to public safety. And they are justly removed from the United States,&#8221; Paterson said. &#8220;But there are others for whom the situation is far less clear. For them, our national immigration laws leave no room to consider mitigating circumstances. But in New York, we believe in rehabilitation. And we believe in renewal. And we believe in second chances.&#8221;</p>
<p>The National Conference of State Legislatures says immigration bills are proliferating, with more than 1,500 introduced last year, but none like Paterson&rsquo;s idea. {snip}</p>
<p>Paterson&rsquo;s staff said they know of just a handful of cases that could qualify for a pardon at this point, but expect more after Monday&rsquo;s announcement. The panel will comprise executive branch workers, and no extra cost is expected.</p>

		<p>Paterson knows that a deportee can apply through the regular immigration channels once they&rsquo;ve been removed from the country, so there&rsquo;s no reason for him to interfere with the deportation process.</p>
<p>If he wants to issue a pardon to the deportee to better their chances of getting back in, then he can face the electorate and explain that he personally will guarantee the ex-con foreign national is worth taking a risk on.</p>

		<p>Well of course, this person is a complete bum. He&rsquo;s a sitting governor who is completely ostracized by all elements, both of his party and the opposition. So he figures he&rsquo;ll do what he can to hurt the state as his way at getting back. This type of thing is only to be expected from this &#8220;man.&#8221;</p>

		<p>If any pardons are granted and the person to whom the pardon was granted commits another crime and someone is hurt, the injured party should sue Paterson in civil court for having established a climate to the crime being committed.</p>
<p>Like Al Sharpton would say: &#8220;hit dem&rsquo;s in the pockets&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Governor will pardon criminals so they won&rsquo;t be deported.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is just an excellent example of why black run societies fail miserably.  No society can pardon criminals and expect to hold crime rates down.</p>
<p>This Obamanation is another excellent example of the incompetence of blacks.  He&rsquo;s been in office for just a little over a year and the country is on the verge of a race war.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how &#8220;bringing us together&#8221; works, huh? Really funny.  What comes across really as ghastly, however, is this man&rsquo;s nonchalance at the crumbling situation coming down around him.  Or does he even realize the seriousness of what is going on?</p>
<p>In a word, this time in this country&rsquo;s history can only be discribed as beyond bizarre.<br>

		<p>In NY or anywhere else, if you believe in rehabilitation, with drugs or alcohol, you&rsquo;re going to be a sucker nearly 100% of the time with a person on the first offense, and then about 66% on the second offense.  That is factual information about how many people actually get clean and sober when forced into rehab.  And it&rsquo;s a generous estimate.  Sexual offenders don&rsquo;t rehabilitate, and I believe should be &#8220;gelded&#8221; immediately upon conviction, first offense.  Do bank robbers and thieves rehabilitate in prison?  Not very many do.  Bottom line, I think Gov. Paterson is a sucker, pure and simple, and that his brand of terminal codependency would do far more harm to society than good.</p>

		<p>It is no exaggeration when I say David Paterson is the worst governor in this state&rsquo;s history!  It&rsquo;s telling when even the left-leaning media here is counting the days until he&rsquo;s finally out of office.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, he&rsquo;s free to continue to destroy what&rsquo;s left of what was once a prosperous state.  What a pity there isn&rsquo;t enough consensus in Albany to impeach him.</p>

<p>I absolutely believe every native born American is entitled to be forgiven for his or her mistakes.  Maybe even one big mistake.  But my forgiveness ends with native born citizens.  Naturalized citizens, resident aliens and illegals who mess up should be tossed out.  Let their own people forgive them and help them start over.  Why should we have to?  Are we the world&rsquo;s dump heap?  <br>

		<p>Maybe we should go back to the &#8220;old days&#8221; where we used race as the defining characteristic of who could immigrate here.</p>
<p>After all, race is the single most important difference between peoples.</p>

		<p>The first criminal Paterson pardoned was a violent one.  He was guilty of mugging someone.  For those of you that don&rsquo;t know, a mugging typically involves shooting or stabbing a person and then stealing their wallet as they lie dying.  Either that or being beaten by a large group of people.  Very often, the victim does not survive.</p>
<p>THAT is the type of criminal Paterson is preventing from being deported.</p>

		<p>Anybody watching Paterson in any of his public appearances certainly has to note that he appears to be either a slack-jawed dolt or perpetually drug-addled.  Just as Hillary no doubt picked Al Gore as Clinton&rsquo;s running mate, believing that the dim-witted Gore would be unelectable and therefore no impediment to her plan to succeed Slick Willie, Spitzer probably picked Paterson figuring that Paterson-as-governor would be so horrifying that his many sexual indiscretions would be swept under the rug.</p>

		<p>Wait until American-born blacks figure out that they don&rsquo;t qualify for this pardon program, while Jose down the block is walking away from a conviction.  Should make for an interesting &#8220;civil rights&#8221; lawsuit!  </p>

		<p>Birds of a feather flock together, as one crook to another. Having empathy for ones ilk is universal, except when it comes to AmeriKan whites who as a general rule sympathize with all other races, creeds, and colors.</p>

And these same liberals criticize Arizona for interfering with a Federal Jurisdiction?  These days, I think even flakey New York liberals are sick of Governor Paterson. </p>

		<p>Ironic it isns&rsquo;t it that even the idiotic liberals who populate<br>
New York State can&rsquo;t stnd this guy!  I grew up in New York City. Largely, because of it&rsquo;s divorced from reality liberal policies, besides the obscenely high taxes, you coould&rsquo;nt pay me enough to return to that place.  I doubt they will learn anything useful from having to deal with Patterson; but those kneejerk liberals<br>
who run too much of that state are getting exactly what they deserve.  Welcome to black rule.</p>
