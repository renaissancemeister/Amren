<h1>Kellogg Foundation Awards $75M Anti-Racism Grant</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Yahoo! News, May 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The W.K. Kellogg Foundation announced Tuesday it is devoting $75 million over the next five years to efforts aimed at undoing the effects of racial inequalities on children in poor communities across the nation.</p>
<p>About $14.6 million will go to 119 communities in at least 20 states and the District of Columbia in the first year of funding for the foundation&rsquo;s &#8220;America Healing&#8221; initiative.</p>
<p>Gail Christopher, a Kellogg vice president, said the money will be part of what amounts to more than the $300 million a year that foundation spends on nurturing children through other programs. The difference with this undertaking, Christopher said, is that funds will be specifically devoted to the needs of children of color in dealing with the problems of racism.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Kellogg Foundation, started by the breakfast cereal pioneer in 1930, has recently focused its resources on vulnerable children who face poverty and discrimination.<br>

<p>Somebody left the irony on. In dealing with &#8220;racism&#8221; we will focus only on &#8220;children of color?&#8221; How is this not racist?</p>

		<p>Does anyone believe that a single child &#8220;of color&#8221; will see a single dime of that money?</p>
<p>Go to any school ditrict supposedly receiving such funds and count the number of Mercedez Benz in the parking lot.</p>
<p>This was actually featured in a recent documentary about New Jersey schools (where about a billion in state aid essentially disappeared).  Going to extremely poor (but exceedingly well funded with state money) school districts and counting all the Mercedez and other luxury cars in the parking lot.  Meanwhile the school looked like something out of zimbabwe.</p>

		<p>Fine by me, I&rsquo;ve always like Post&rsquo;s Corn Flakes better anyway.</p>
<p>Maybe they can use some of that foundation money to give all these &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; black and Hispanic children free breakfast cereal, so that we don&rsquo;t have to pay for their breakfasts.</p>

		<p>I have color. Do they care about the effects on my self esteem when I&rsquo;m denied a job because of my skin color?  </p>
<p>Being a proud member of the White Color Race Family makes me a victim of Affirmative Action racial profiling.</p>
<p>When will Kellogg spend money undoing the harmful effects of Affirmative Action, White Dispossession, and White Voter Intimidation?</p>
<p>Until they do the right thing and send a strong message of racial justice, we will boycott all Kellogg products.</p>

		<p>#2  So true.  I remember reading a story about the complete collapse of the Detroit school system and it showed the school board building, which was the size of a shopping mall, and was populated with six-figure blacks strutting around in designer clothes.  The journalist truthfully stated that a huge portion of the sizeable budget stops right at that building while a small percentage trickles down to the schools.</p>

		<p>There is one color that gets the attention of Kellogg and everyone else on this planet - green - the color of money. My simple answer is to boycott Kellogg. Just stop buying their cereals. <br>
Over the years I&rsquo;ve watched so many arrogant corporations die simply because they offended enough people to cause them a significant loss of business. We buy Kellogg&rsquo;s cereals out of habit as much as anything else. They will now be subjected to the loss of my money. True, it&rsquo;s not much, but if enough of us do it long enough, we&rsquo;ll get their attention. Boycott Kelloggs!</p>

		<p>Would someone please tell me how I can form a &#8220;foundation&#8221; dedicated to &#8220;studies&#8221; of racism and &#8220;solutions&#8221; for this most pernicious American phenomenon. Hey, I mean, there&rsquo;s big bucks in this, and any moron can put together a publishable document affirming the existence of racism throughout American society. I mean, this is a pretty sickening get-rich-quick scheme, but everybody else is doing it, and I figure I might as well cash in. All you need is an English vocabulary of maybe two thousand words and it&rsquo;s in the bag.</p>

		<p>Since we&rsquo;re calling it &#8216;racism&rsquo; whenever someone is poorer than someone else, and the group with more money called &#8216;racist&rsquo;, how come &#8216;racism&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t stand for Asians? And the other groups are never said to be racist towards each other? Why don&rsquo;t they say what the really mean when they say &#8216;racist&rsquo; just say &#8216;white&rsquo;?</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s always inspiring to see the insanely wealthy (i.e., the likely descendants of slaveowners) shower cash to &#8220;progressive&#8221; causes that cause resentment between blacks and non-wealthy whites (i.e., the likely descendants of indentured servants).</p>

		<p>Gosh, aint it great that there are no poor white children in the USA anymore.  I&rsquo;d have never thunk that! It seems that most of the big funded charities in this country think so too, I wonder if anyone keeps track of how much &#8216;moola&rsquo; is pumped into these &#8216;communities of color&rsquo; by the Ford Doundation, MacDonald&rsquo;s, The MacArthur Foundation, etc. besides what they get from the USA Taxpayers.  Well, I know for one thing, I won&rsquo;t be buying any Kellogg&rsquo;s products from this date forward.</p>

		<p>In other words&hellip; that $75 million grant will be money utterly wasted! On excessive salaries and &#8220;administrative expenses&#8221; of Black organizations for the purported good of &#8220;children of color.&#8221; I can&rsquo;t wait for the scandals to surface. Which they will. </p>

		<p>From an objective legal point of view, this grant specifically mentions &#8220;children of color&#8221;, thus would only apply to children having skin tones of an unspecified and superficial nature. This is truly a racist grant. So, boycott Kellogs - Yes, but call them &#8220;Racist&#8221; in very loud tones. Shouting the word &#8220;Racist&#8221; will confuse the liberals and blacks alike, and destroy Kellogs!  -El Halcon  </p>

		<p>Where can we find white people who still think that black children are held back by &#8220;racism&#8221;?  At the giant charitable foundations, of course.  This isn&rsquo;t so surprising when you realize that the people who work there are an unholy mixture of third generation blue bloods and graduates of leftist liberal arts programs.  What they all have in common is an astonishing lack of contact with the real world.</p>
<p>Unfortunately charitable foundations usually have little financial connection to their eponymous corporations.  Thus, you could boycott the Ford Motor Company year after year and it won&rsquo;t hurt the egregious Ford Foundation one little bit.  I suspect that taking Special K off my shopping list isn&rsquo;t going to cause any economic hardship to the W.K. Kellogg Foundation.<br>

<p>This money will be spent teaching non-White children to blame their failures on White men (old English translation of &#8220;dealing with the problems of racism&#8221;).</p>
