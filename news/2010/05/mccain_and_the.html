			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sydney Schanberg, The American Conservative, July 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><strong>Note: The following article by legendary Vietnam-era journalist Sydney Schanberg (made famous by the film <em>The Killing Fields</em>) was first published by the leftwing <em>Nation</em> magazine in October 2008, but was completely ignored by the mainstream media. <em>The American Conservative</em> is republishing the article in its July 1 issue, along with several companion articles <a href="https://amconmag.com/article/2010/jul/01/00006/">weighing</a> the <a href="https://amconmag.com/article/2010/jul/01/00021/">evidence</a> presented by Mr. Schanberg and taking the <a href="https://amconmag.com/article/2010/jul/01/00023/">media</a> to <a href="https://amconmag.com/article/2010/jul/01/00008/">task</a> for <a href="https://amconmag.com/article/2010/jul/01/00024/">ignoring</a> a story that could have destroyed both John McCain&rsquo;s presidential campaign and his political career. The <a href="https://amconmag.com/article/2010/jul/01/00010/">original article</a> contains a great deal of information. Readers are encouraged to read it in its entirety, along with the accompanying pieces, and draw their own conclusions.</strong></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>John McCain, who has risen to political prominence on his image as a Vietnam POW war hero, has, inexplicably, worked very hard to hide from the public stunning information about American prisoners in Vietnam who, unlike him, didn&rsquo;t return home. Throughout his Senate career, McCain has quietly sponsored and pushed into federal law a set of prohibitions that keep the most revealing information about these men buried as classified documents. Thus the war hero who people would logically imagine as a determined crusader for the interests of POWs and their families became instead the strange champion of hiding the evidence and closing the books.</p>
<p>Almost as striking is the manner in which the mainstream press has shied from reporting the POW story and McCain&rsquo;s role in it, even as the Republican Party has made McCain&rsquo;s military service the focus of his presidential campaign. Reporters who had covered the Vietnam War turned their heads and walked in other directions. McCain doesn&rsquo;t talk about the missing men, and the press never asks him about them.</p>
<p>The sum of the secrets McCain has sought to hide is not small. There exists a telling mass of official documents, radio intercepts, witness depositions, satellite photos of rescue symbols that pilots were trained to use, electronic messages from the ground containing the individual code numbers given to airmen, a rescue mission by a special forces unit that was aborted twice by Washington  &mdash;  and even sworn testimony by two Defense secretaries that &#8220;men were left behind.&#8221; This imposing body of evidence suggests that a large number  &mdash;  the documents indicate probably hundreds  &mdash;  of the U.S. prisoners held by Vietnam were not returned when the peace treaty was signed in January 1973 and Hanoi released 591 men, among them Navy combat pilot John S. McCain.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The pressure from the families and Vietnam veterans finally forced the creation, in late 1991, of a Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs. The chairman was John Kerry. McCain, as a former POW, was its most pivotal member. In the end, the committee became part of the debunking machine.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Included in the evidence that McCain and his government allies suppressed or sought to discredit is a transcript of a senior North Vietnamese general&rsquo;s briefing of the Hanoi politburo, discovered in Soviet archives by an American scholar in 1993. The briefing took place only four months before the 1973 peace accords. The general, Tran Van Quang, told the politburo members that Hanoi was holding 1,205 American prisoners but would keep many of them at war&rsquo;s end as leverage to ensure getting war reparations from Washington.</p>
<p>Throughout the Paris negotiations, the North Vietnamese tied the prisoner issue tightly to the issue of reparations. They were adamant in refusing to deal with them separately. Finally, in a Feb. 2, 1973 formal letter to Hanoi&rsquo;s premier, Pham Van Dong, Nixon pledged $3.25 billion in &#8220;postwar reconstruction&#8221; aid &#8220;without any political conditions.&#8221; But he also attached to the letter a codicil that said the aid would be implemented by each party &#8220;in accordance with its own constitutional provisions.&#8221; That meant Congress would have to approve the appropriation, and Nixon and Kissinger knew well that Congress was in no mood to do so. The North Vietnamese, whether or not they immediately understood the double-talk in the letter, remained skeptical about the reparations promise being honored  &mdash;  and it never was. Hanoi thus appears to have held back prisoners  &mdash;  just as it had done when the French were defeated at Dien Bien Phu in 1954 and withdrew their forces from Vietnam. In that case, France paid ransoms for prisoners and brought them home.</p>
<p>In a private briefing in 1992, high-level CIA officials told me that as the years passed and the ransom never came, it became more and more difficult for either government to admit that it knew from the start about the unacknowledged prisoners. Those prisoners had not only become useless as bargaining chips but also posed a risk to Hanoi&rsquo;s desire to be accepted into the international community. The CIA officials said their intelligence indicated strongly that the remaining men  &mdash;  those who had not died from illness or hard labor or torture  &mdash;  were eventually executed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For many reasons, including the absence of a political constituency for the missing men other than their families and some veterans&rsquo; groups, very few Americans are aware of the POW story and of McCain&rsquo;s role in keeping it out of public view and denying the existence of abandoned POWs. That is because McCain has hardly been alone in his campaign to hide the scandal.</p>
<p>The Arizona senator, now the Republican candidate for president, has actually been following the lead of every White House since Richard Nixon&rsquo;s, and thus of every CIA director, Pentagon chief, and national security adviser, not to mention Dick Cheney, who was George H.W. Bush&rsquo;s Defense secretary. Their biggest accomplice has been an indolent press, particularly in Washington.</p>
<p><strong>McCain&rsquo;s Role</strong></p>
<p>An early and critical McCain secrecy move involved 1990 legislation that started in the House of Representatives. A brief and simple document, it was called &#8220;the Truth Bill&#8221; and would have compelled complete transparency about prisoners and missing men. Its core sentence reads: &#8220;[The] head of each department or agency which holds or receives any records and information, including live-sighting reports, which have been correlated or possibly correlated to United States personnel listed as prisoner of war or missing in action from World War II, the Korean conflict and the Vietnam conflict, shall make available to the public all such records held or received by that department or agency.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bitterly opposed by the Pentagon (and thus McCain), the bill went nowhere. Reintroduced the following year, it again disappeared. But a few months later, a new measure, known as &#8220;the McCain Bill,&#8221; suddenly appeared. By creating a bureaucratic maze from which only a fraction of the documents could emerge  &mdash;  only records that revealed no POW secrets  &mdash;  it turned the Truth Bill on its head. The McCain bill became law in 1991 and remains so today. So crushing to transparency are its provisions that it actually spells out for the Pentagon and other agencies several rationales, scenarios, and justifications for not releasing any information at all  &mdash;  even about prisoners discovered alive in captivity. Later that year, the Senate Select Committee was created, where Kerry and McCain ultimately worked together to bury evidence.</p>
<p>McCain was also instrumental in amending the Missing Service Personnel Act, which had been strengthened in 1995 by POW advocates to include criminal penalties, saying, &#8220;Any government official who knowingly and willfully withholds from the file of a missing person any information relating to the disappearance or whereabouts and status of a missing person shall be fined as provided in Title 18 or imprisoned not more than one year or both.&#8221; A year later, in a closed House-Senate conference on an unrelated military bill, McCain, at the behest of the Pentagon, attached a crippling amendment to the act, stripping out its only enforcement teeth, the criminal penalties, and reducing the obligations of commanders in the field to speedily search for missing men and to report the incidents to the Pentagon.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>McCain has insisted again and again that all the evidence  &mdash;  documents, witnesses, satellite photos, two Pentagon chiefs&rsquo; sworn testimony, aborted rescue missions, ransom offers apparently scorned  &mdash;  has been woven together by unscrupulous deceivers to create an insidious and unpatriotic myth. He calls it the &#8220;bizarre rantings of the MIA hobbyists.&#8221; He has regularly vilified those who keep trying to pry out classified documents as &#8220;hoaxers,&#8221; &#8220;charlatans,&#8221; &#8220;conspiracy theorists,&#8221; and &#8220;dime-store Rambos.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of McCain&rsquo;s fellow captives at Hoa Lo prison in Hanoi didn&rsquo;t share his views about prisoners left behind. Before he died of leukemia in 1999, retired Col. Ted Guy, a highly admired POW and one of the most dogged resisters in the camps, wrote an angry open letter to the senator in an MIA newsletter  &mdash;  a response to McCain&rsquo;s stream of insults hurled at MIA activists. Guy wrote, &#8220;John, does this [the insults] include Senator Bob Smith [a New Hampshire Republican and activist on POW issues] and other concerned elected officials? Does this include the families of the missing where there is overwhelming evidence that their loved ones were &#8216;last known alive&rsquo;? Does this include some of your fellow POWs?&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear whether the taped confession McCain gave to his captors to avoid further torture has played a role in his postwar behavior in the Senate. That confession was played endlessly over the prison loudspeaker system at Hoa Lo  &mdash;  to try to break down other prisoners  &mdash;  and was broadcast over Hanoi&rsquo;s state radio. Reportedly, he confessed to being a war criminal who had bombed civilian targets. The Pentagon has a copy of the confession but will not release it. Also, no outsider I know of has ever seen a non-redacted copy of the debriefing of McCain when he returned from captivity, which is classified but could be made public by McCain.</p>
<p>All humans have breaking points. Many men undergoing torture give confessions, often telling huge lies so their fakery will be understood by their comrades and their country. Few will fault them. But it was McCain who apparently felt he had disgraced himself and his military family. His father, John S. McCain II, was a highly regarded rear admiral then serving as commander of all U.S. forces in the Pacific. His grandfather was also a rear admiral.</p>
<p>In his bestselling 1999 autobiography, Faith of My Fathers, McCain says he felt bad throughout his captivity because he knew he was being treated more leniently than his fellow POWs, owing to his high-ranking father and thus his propaganda value. Other prisoners at Hoa Lo say his captors considered him a prize catch and called him the &#8220;Crown Prince,&#8221; something McCain acknowledges in the book.</p>
<p>Also in this memoir, McCain expresses guilt at having broken under torture and given the confession. &#8220;I felt faithless and couldn&rsquo;t control my despair,&#8221; he writes, revealing that he made two &#8220;feeble&#8221; attempts at suicide. (In later years, he said he tried to hang himself with his shirt and guards intervened.) Tellingly, he says he lived in &#8220;dread&#8221; that his father would find out about the confession. &#8220;I still wince,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;when I recall wondering if my father had heard of my disgrace.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Is McCain haunted by these memories? Does he suppress POW information because its surfacing would rekindle his feelings of shame? On this subject, all I have are questions.</p>
<p>Many stories have been written about McCain&rsquo;s explosive temper, so volcanic that colleagues are loath to speak openly about it. One veteran congressman who has observed him over the years asked for confidentiality and made this brief comment: &#8220;This is a man not at peace with himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was certainly far from calm on the Senate POW committee. He browbeat expert witnesses who came with information about unreturned POWs. Family members who have personally faced McCain and pressed him to end the secrecy also have been treated to his legendary temper. He has screamed at them, insulted them, brought women to tears. Mostly his responses to them have been versions of: How dare you question my patriotism? In 1996, he roughly pushed aside a group of POW family members who had waited outside a hearing room to appeal to him, including a mother in a wheelchair.</p>
<p>But even without answers to what may be hidden in the recesses of McCain&rsquo;s mind, one thing about the POW story is clear: if American prisoners were dishonored by being written off and left to die, that&rsquo;s something the American public ought to know about.<br>
<strong><br>
10 Key Pieces of Evidence That Men Were Left Behind</strong></p>
<p>1. In Paris, where the Vietnam peace treaty was negotiated, the United States asked Hanoi for the list of American prisoners to be returned, fearing that Hanoi would hold some prisoners back. The North Vietnamese refused, saying they would produce the list only after the treaty was signed. Nixon agreed with Kissinger that they had no leverage left, and Kissinger signed the accord on Jan. 27, 1973 without the prisoner list. When Hanoi produced its list of 591 prisoners the next day, U.S. intelligence agencies expressed shock at the low number. {snip}</p>
<p>2. Two Defense secretaries who served during the Vietnam War testified to the Senate POW committee in September 1992 that prisoners were not returned. James Schlesinger and Melvin Laird, both speaking at a public session and under oath, said they based their conclusions on strong intelligence data  &mdash;  letters, eyewitness reports, even direct radio contacts. Under questioning, Schlesinger chose his words carefully, understanding clearly the volatility of the issue: &#8220;I think that as of now that I can come to no other conclusion &hellip; some were left behind.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>3. Over the years, the DIA received more than 1,600 first-hand sightings of live American prisoners and nearly 14,000 second-hand reports. Many witnesses interrogated by CIA or Pentagon intelligence agents were deemed &#8220;credible&#8221; in the agents&rsquo; reports. {snip} </p>
<p>4. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, listening stations picked up messages in which Laotian military personnel spoke about moving American prisoners from one labor camp to another. These listening posts were manned by Thai communications officers trained by the National Security Agency (NSA), which monitors signals worldwide. The NSA teams had moved out after the fall of Saigon in 1975 and passed the job to the Thai allies. But when the Thais turned these messages over to Washington, the intelligence community ruled that since the intercepts were made by a &#8220;third party&#8221;  &mdash;  namely Thailand  &mdash;  they could not be regarded as authentic. That&rsquo;s some Catch-22: the U.S. trained a third party to take over its role in monitoring signals about POWs, but because that third party did the monitoring, the messages weren&rsquo;t valid.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>5. A series of what appeared to be distress signals from Vietnam and Laos were captured by the government&rsquo;s satellite system in the late 1980s and early &rsquo;90s. (Before that period, no search for such signals had been put in place.) Not a single one of these markings was ever deemed credible. To the layman&rsquo;s eye, the satellite photos, some of which I&rsquo;ve seen, show markings on the ground that are identical to the signals that American pilots had been specifically trained to use in their survival courses  &mdash;  such as certain letters, like X or K, drawn in a special way. Other markings were the secret four-digit authenticator numbers given to individual pilots. But time and again, the Pentagon, backed by the CIA, insisted that humans had not made these markings. What were they, then? &#8220;Shadows and vegetation,&#8221; the government said, insisting that the markings were merely normal topographical contours like saw-grass or rice-paddy divider walls. {snip}</p>
<p>6. On Nov. 11, 1992, Dolores Alfond, the sister of missing airman Capt. Victor Apodaca and chair of the National Alliance of Families, an organization of relatives of POW/MIAs, testified at one of the Senate committee&rsquo;s public hearings. She asked for information about data the government had gathered from electronic devices used in a classified program known as PAVE SPIKE.</p>
<p>The devices were motion sensors, dropped by air, designed to pick up enemy troop movements. Shaped on one end like a spike with an electronic pod and antenna on top, they were designed to stick in the ground as they fell. Air Force planes would drop them along the Ho Chi Minh trail and other supply routes. The devices, though primarily sensors, also had rescue capabilities. Someone on the ground  &mdash;  a downed airman or a prisoner on a labor gang  &mdash;  could manually enter data into the sensor. All data were regularly collected electronically by U.S. planes flying overhead. Alfond stated, without any challenge or contradiction by the committee, that in 1974, a year after the supposedly complete return of prisoners, the gathered data showed that a person or people had manually entered into the sensors  &mdash;  as U.S. pilots had been trained to do  &mdash;  no less than 20 authenticator numbers that corresponded exactly to the classified authenticator numbers of 20 U.S. POWs who were lost in Laos. Alfond added, according to the transcript, &#8220;This PAVE SPIKE intelligence is seamless, but the committee has not discussed it or released what it knows about PAVE SPIKE.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCain attended that committee hearing specifically to confront Alfond because of her criticism of the panel&rsquo;s work. He <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CazKanlYDg"><strong>bellowed and berated her</strong></a> for quite a while. His face turning anger-pink, he accused her of &#8220;denigrating&#8221; his &#8220;patriotism.&#8221; The bullying had its effect  &mdash;  she began to cry.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>7. As previously mentioned, in April 1993 in a Moscow archive, a researcher from Harvard, Stephen Morris, unearthed and made public the transcript of a briefing that General Tran Van Quang gave to the Hanoi politburo four months before the signing of the Paris peace accords in 1973.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Hanoi responded to the revelation by calling the transcript a fabrication.</p>
<p>Similarly, Washington  &mdash;  which had over the same two decades refused to recant Nixon&rsquo;s declaration that all the prisoners had been returned  &mdash;  also shifted into denial mode. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The Russian archivists simply said the document was &#8220;authentic.&#8221;</p>
<p>8. In his 2002 book, Inside Delta Force, retired Command Sgt. Maj. Eric Haney described how in 1981 his special forces unit, after rigorous training for a POW rescue mission, had the mission suddenly aborted, revived a year later, and again abruptly aborted. Haney writes that this abandonment of captured soldiers ate at him for years and left him disillusioned about his government&rsquo;s vows to leave no men behind. {snip}</p>
<p>9. There is also evidence that in the first months of Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s presidency in 1981, the White House received a ransom proposal for a number of POWs being held by Hanoi in Indochina. The offer, which was passed to Washington from an official of a third country, was apparently discussed at a meeting in the Roosevelt Room attended by Reagan, Vice President Bush, CIA director William Casey, and National Security Adviser Richard Allen. Allen confirmed the offer in sworn testimony to the Senate POW committee on June 23, 1992.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>10. In 1990, Col. Millard Peck, a decorated infantry veteran of Vietnam then working at the DIA as chief of the Asia Division for Current Intelligence, asked for the job of chief of the DIA&rsquo;s Special Office for Prisoners of War and Missing in Action. His reason for seeking the transfer, which was not a promotion, was that he had heard from officials throughout the Pentagon that the POW/MIA office had been turned into a waste-disposal unit for getting rid of unwanted evidence about live prisoners  &mdash;  a &#8220;black hole,&#8221; these officials called it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The disillusioned colonel not only resigned but asked to be retired immediately from active military service. The press never followed up.</p>
<p><strong>My Pursuit of the Story</strong></p>
<p>I covered the war in Cambodia and Vietnam, but came to the POW information only slowly afterward, when military officers I knew from that conflict began coming to me with maps and POW sightings and depositions by Vietnamese witnesses.</p>
<p>I was then city editor of the New York Times, no longer involved in foreign or national stories, so I took the data to the appropriate desks and suggested it was material worth pursuing. There were no takers. Some years later, in 1991, when I was an op-ed columnist at Newsday, the aforementioned special Senate committee was formed to probe the POW issue. I saw this as an opening and immersed myself in the reporting.</p>
<p>At Newsday, I wrote 36 columns over a two-year period, as well as a four-part series on a trip I took to North Vietnam to report on what happened to one missing pilot who was shot down over the Ho Chi Minh trail and captured when he parachuted down. After Newsday, I wrote thousands more words on the subject for other outlets. Some of the pieces were about McCain&rsquo;s key role.</p>
<p>Though I wrote on many subjects for Life, Vanity Fair, and Washington Monthly, my POW articles appeared in Penthouse, the Village Voice, and APBnews.com. Mainstream publications just weren&rsquo;t interested. Their disinterest was part of what motivated me, and I became one of a very short list of journalists who considered the story important.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>John McCain  &mdash;  now campaigning for the White House as a war hero, maverick, and straight shooter  &mdash;  owes the voters some explanations. The press were long ago wooed and won by McCain&rsquo;s seeming openness, Lone Ranger pose, and self-deprecating humor, which may partly explain their ignoring his record on POWs. In the numerous, lengthy McCain profiles that have appeared of late in papers like the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal, I may have missed a clause or a sentence along the way, but I have not found a single mention of his role in burying information about POWs. Television and radio news programs have been similarly silent.</p>
<p>Reporters simply never ask him about it. They didn&rsquo;t when he ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination in 2000. They haven&rsquo;t now, despite the fact that we&rsquo;re in the midst of another war  &mdash;  a war he supports and one that has echoes of Vietnam. The only explanation McCain has ever offered for his leadership on legislation that seals POW files is that he believes the release of such information would only stir up fresh grief for the families of those who were never accounted for in Vietnam. Of the scores of POW families I&rsquo;ve met over the years, only a few have said they want the books closed without knowing what happened to their men. All the rest say that not knowing is exactly what grieves them.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it possible that what really worries those intent on keeping the POW documents buried is the public disgust that the contents of those files would generate?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><strong>McCain&rsquo;s Catch-22</strong></p>
<p>None of this compelling evidence in the committee&rsquo;s full report dislodged McCain from his contention that the whole POW issue was a concoction by deluded purveyors of a &#8220;conspiracy theory.&#8221; But an honest review of the full report, combined with the other documentary evidence, tells the story of a frustrated and angry president, and his national security adviser, furious at being thwarted at the peace table by a small, much less powerful country that refused to bow to Washington&rsquo;s terms. That president seems to have swallowed hard and accepted a treaty that left probably hundreds of American prisoners in Hanoi&rsquo;s hands, to be used as bargaining chips for reparations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Which brings us to today, when the Republican candidate for president is the contemporary politician most responsible for keeping the truth about this matter hidden. Yet he says he&rsquo;s the right man to be the commander in chief, and his credibility in making this claim is largely based on his image as a POW hero.</p>
<p>On page 468 of the 1,221-page report, McCain parsed his POW position oddly, &#8220;We found no compelling evidence to prove that Americans are alive in captivity today. There is some evidence  &mdash;  though no proof  &mdash;  to suggest only the possibility that a few Americans may have been kept behind after the end of America&rsquo;s military involvement in Vietnam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Evidence though no proof.&#8221; Clearly, no one could meet McCain&rsquo;s standard of proof as long as he is leading a government crusade to keep the truth buried.</p>
<p>To this reporter, this sounds like a significant story and a long overdue opportunity for the press to finally dig into the archives to set the historical record straight  &mdash;  and even pose some direct questions to the candidate.  <br>

		<p>The more time that passes, the more I honestly believe that the Republican establishment faked up some votes in some key early GOP primary states for McCain, because they wanted him to win the nomination.  And they wanted him to win the nomination because no Republican was going to win the Presidency in 2008.  So they didn&rsquo;t want to spoil people like Romney (who I&rsquo;m not that fond of, really.)  Part of the tragedy that was the McCain nomination was that the GOP uses a winner take all system in its primaries.  Therefore, McCain won all these early states like NH, SC and FL with no more than 37% of the vote, but got all the delegates.  </p>
<p>I think if McCain actually showed any ambition of wanting the Presidency vs Obama, this POW stuff would have been pulled out of the hat.  I also think that the only reason Obama put Janet Napolitano in the cabinet was a reward to McCain for rolling over, in that Obama cleared what was thought to be McCain&rsquo;s only real competition for another Senate term.  This was before J.D. Hayworth came along.</p>
<p>Also, I think that George Soros manipulated the financial system to cause the well timed financial crash in September 2008.  Congressman Paul Kanjorski (D-PA) alluded to that early last year.  BTW, Lou Barletta will challenge him again for that House seat this fall, and the good news is that while Barletta was unopposed in his primary, Kanjorski won his but with under 50% in a three way race.  This might be Barletta&rsquo;s year.</p>

		<p>I must admit that up until the last election I was one of those people who was  loathe to speak ill of John McCain because of his service to America.  I, for a long time, had a great respect for because of what he (allegedly) did while a POW.  It made me wonder how in the world he could be so anti-American now yet so patriotic when young.  People are usually more foolish in youth than in middle age and older.  When I read this story this morning it all started to click.  Politics.  He is all show.  He only does, and perhaps has only ever done, what he feels will advance his political goals.  Perhaps he always assumed he would one day be President and therefore stabbed his fellow soldiers in the back.</p>
<p>The thought that men have been held captive for 35 or 45 years in Vietnam because of some low life politicians lies sickens me.  If it can be proven that these men were left to rot in SE Asia while McCain and other big-wigs knew that they were being held captive those responsible, if still alive, should be imprisoned for what remains of their lives.  Those who are already dead should not be allowed to remain buried in veteran&rsquo;s cemeteries if they were originally interred in one.  These evil men must face punishment.</p>
<p>Maybe we truly are a nation that deserves to go away.<br>

<p>If any AR reader is interested in further information on this subject, I would recommend the following two books:</p>
<p>1.  &#8220;An Enormous Crime&#8221; (2008) by Bill Hendon and Elizabeth Stewart.  This is the best book by far that I am aware of this subject.</p>
<p>2.  &#8220;Betrayed&#8221; (2002) by Joseph D. Douglass.</p>

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t put anything past McCain. I have always found something unwholesome or untrustworthy about him - couldn&rsquo;t put my finger on it exactly, just didn&rsquo;t like or trust the guy from the get-go. None of this, providing it is true of course, surprises me remotely.  </p>

		<p>&ldquo;Nixon pledged $3.25 billion in &#8216;postwar reconstruction&rsquo; aid &#8216;without any political conditions.&rsquo; But he also attached to the letter a codicil that said the aid would be implemented by each party &#8216;in accordance with its own constitutional provisions.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>1. Postwar reconstruction PREDICATED UPON THE ASSUMPTION THAT NORTH VIETNAM WOULD NOT ENGAGE IN FURTHER MILITARTY ACTION AGAINST SOUTH VIETNAM. THIS NORTH VIETNAM DID NOT DO. SO ANY UNDERSTANDING THE U.S. HAD WITH THE NORTH BECAME NULL AND VOID!!</p>
<p>2. I can speak with some degree of accuracy about this matter. When we speak of &#8220;prisoners&#8221; we have to be careful about WHO we are spekaing about. When the last U.S. troops left South Vietnam, it is known for a fact a that about 1,000 deserters were being sheltered by ethnic Chinese in the Cholon quarter of Saigon. Prior to leaving, the U.S. military sent trucks through the Cholon district announcing by loudspeaker to the American deserters to come out of hiding. &#8220;Come out of hiding and take your chances, allow yourself to return to America!! NONE did!  &#8220;So you must ask yourself - - when the communist North Vietnamese captured Saigon in 1975, what happened to those men??</p>

		<p>This is why, whenever our government comes to the American people, saying we need to wage war outside the US, the answer should always be no.</p>
<p>To date, not a single incident of this has not been coerced by deception, worked for our national best interests in any way nor resulted in anything less that flagrant anti-white racism.</p>
<p>Our system of government was designed to tell such people NO.  If they persist, then it&rsquo;s NO with a quick hanging.</p>
<p>We got away from that the last coupld centuries.  We need to return to the old school.</p>

		<p>I read Colonel Bo Gritz&rsquo;s account of one of his missions to Vietnam to find and rescue P.O.W.&rsquo;s, which wasn&rsquo;t successful, and there is DEFINITELY evidence that his mission was  compromised due to the North Vietnamese being informed of the plan in detail.  When the team arrived at the location of the P.O.W.&rsquo;s, they had been moved a day or two before.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know enough about the overall picture, however, to offer an informed comment on P.O.W.&rsquo;s.  </p>
<p>All I can say is that, when it comes to this government or any other there&rsquo;s no end to unscrupulous, despicable actions by politicians and brass, some of which could accurately be described as traitorous.</p>
<p>Contrary to what politicians want us to believe, there is no great dedication and love by these higher ups for the man in the field, excluding, of course, lower echelon officers who are usually included in with all the rest as far as these self appointed VIP&rsquo;s are concerned.</p>
<p>But the way we are regarded by these self-appointed elitists, by not even bothering to free those who were captured by the enemy, is only one example of why we should never follow them again.</p>
<p>Take the issue of equipment.  If there were real, true concern for the American fighting man, the M-16 initial versions would have been replaced immediately after LARGE NUMBERS of malfunctions of these weapons caused jamming due to &#8220;double feed,&#8221; &#8220;case expansion,&#8221; and &#8220;rim shear,&#8221; two of which were disingenuously blamed on the gun powder used in the bullets.   Also dampness was given as a cause for malfunctioning.  This all resulted in the unnecessary deaths of thousands of soldiers.  After the malfunctions and unreliability were brought to the attention of the brass AND politicians literally hundreds of times, no corrections were ever made. </p>
<p>Captured Russian AK-47s were used my many troops in the field as long as possible until they were ordered to use their M-16 issue.  Many of the M-16&rsquo;s, incidentally were M-4&rsquo;s, which is an M-16 with a shortened barrel.  Today&rsquo;s M-16 allegedly is a much better weapon after going through about 35 modifications over the years.  But today is too late for the many men killed due to being issued sub-standard weapons.</p>
<p>The reason for neglecting to correct the M-16 during the Vietnam war could well be the same reason this country left its soldiers rot in North Vietnamese prison camps:  It was politically expedient to take no action at all.  There is no love of comrades or patriotism among those whose ideology is to watch out for number one and CYA at all times.</p>
<p>As it stands now, in today&rsquo;s multiracial empire, things are far worse, and today&rsquo;s white soldier can expect even more egregious conduct, attitudes, and outrage than ever before by the elites.  Just look at how many white troops are in frontline combat positions far in excess of their percentage within the military, while great pains are taken to &#8220;double train&#8221; blacks and other non-whites for rear echelon jobs.  This is all for appeasing the black leadership who wrongly complained about the high percentage of blacks in combat roles.  These white soldiers are political pawns of the brass and politicians, used and regarded as no more than chess pieces to be moved wherever necessary to stop black wailing.</p>
<p>There is no war worth fighting for an out-of-touch bureaucracy that regards the average soldier as mere cannon fodder to be used and expended as needed.</p>
<p>The only battle worthy of our blood is one that pits non-whites against our own people, commanded by our own whom we trust and regard with respect, representing a state or country or enclave that is not too big to know us by our names.</p>
<p>Fighting for an empire is the work of fools.</p>

		<p>I have never believed that Juan McCain&rsquo;s account of his time as a POW was true. I don&rsquo;t believe his tales of torture. He was known by other POW&rsquo;s as Songbird McCain.</p>
<p>Then there is his fable that he was offered release but chose to remain b/c he didn&rsquo;t want to be used for enemy propaganda.To that I say nonsense. If the N.V. wanted to score propaganda points they would have marched him on a plane whether he liked it or not &amp; flown him to a third country &amp; announced his release b/c of their goodwill while he was still in the air.</p>
<p>I suspect the reason for his odd behavior &amp; temper is b/c he was/is being blackmailed.</p>

		<p>Actually, the U.S. has a history of leaving soldiers behind in captivity. The U.S. abandoned several hundred american soldiers that were &#8216;detained&rsquo; by soviet soldiers in Chekoslovakia at the end of WW II when both fighting forces met. They all died in the Soviet Union as prisoners. The U.S. never demanded them back. There are 2 known american pilots that were sent to China during the Vietnam war and were never heard from again. Also, there were a number of pilots that were sent to the soviet union after being shot down during the Vietnam war and were never heard from again. The reason for these pilots being sent to countries outside of Vietnam was the request of these countries for specific individuals for interrogation purposes. There were a number of pilots that had extensive knowledge of the latest aviation and electronic technology that should never have been allowed to fly in Vietnam. Most american pilots, especially high value ones, were well known to the enemy (read Soviet Union especially) and if shot down and captured were subjected to extreme interrogation to extract as much information as possible about these latest technological innovations. Looking on the killing fields of southeast asia for all the missing american combatants will yield very little.  </p>

		<p>John McCain flew an airplane only five times. Four of those times he crashed. Some pilot. When he ejected he neglected to pull his arms in as TRAINED and both his arms hit rails as the ejector seat left the plane. He landed in Vietname with 2 broken arms. His nickname was &#8220;songbird&#8221; because he quickly gave the vietnamese anything they asked for INCLUDING making a daily radio broadcast telling the captured soldiers to give in. </p>
<p>When his wife who waited for him all those years in vietname got sick, he DIVORCED HER and married a prettier younger woman. </p>
<p>He is a sick evil man who knows he has commited the most unethical of acts. He has no honor to redeam, no soul to save</p>

		<p>As a person, old enough to remember the TV shots of the POWs returning home, I remember my father saying that with the amount of men sent to fight in Vietnam, there had to be more than just the 590 something they said there was.  And I remember over the past 40 years, the talk about missing servicemen and our government telling us that there were no more missing servicemen.</p>
<p>I read this article yesterday and wasn&rsquo;t surprised by the McCain connection.  </p>
<p>If this and his flip flop on the border issue, doesn&rsquo;t unseat him in November, I don&rsquo;t think anything will.</p>

		<p>How to judge this? There are so many reasons to dislike John McCain without this. I await more information. Also, we should look with some forbearance at anyone in that awful situation. Try to imagine being a POW.  </p>
<p>The writer Sidney Schanberg, famous through Sam Waterston&rsquo;s portrayal in &#8220;The Killing Fields,&#8221; saw the light about Cambodia&rsquo;s genocidal Khmer Rouge. Good, but during the war he praised the communists and bashed the US. Now, the liberal rewrite of that history is that THEY were on the side of the people of Southeast Asia, when in fact they rooted for an American pullout and communist victory.</p>
<p>In my own revisionism of those times, I&rsquo;ve come to see the light that SE Asia&rsquo;s civil wars essentially weren&rsquo;t our business, even though I do support human rights and self-determination for everyone, everywhere. The real legacy for Americans was both millions of refugees moved to the US, adding to our dispossession, and the loss of some very fine people, as this story shows.</p>
<p>The same will be the endgame of our Iraq and Afghanistan adventures. While the USA dies, our rulers refuse to give up the role of world policeman. They enjoy the global-scale meddling, pontificating, and wielding vast forces just too much.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the fact that the fate of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos really wasn&rsquo;t our concern does show how altruistic our intervention was. Americans tried to help, and basically got nothing from it. </p>
<p>I mention again that I&rsquo;m an Iraq veteran, just to stress the sincerity, the fullness of my support for our brave warriors. But that doesn&rsquo;t give politicians a pass, who chase dragons all across the world, and put our military in harm&rsquo;s way, to feel important and distract Americans. When I hear, &#8220;the Iraq War was all about oil,&#8221; I say I wish it were. Then maybe I&rsquo;d understand it.</p>
<p>Anyway, let&rsquo;s hope McCain gets expelled from the Senate just because he&rsquo;s a phony conservative who played dead for Obama during the election, a grave disservice to the country. If he was a traitor in Vietnam, Americans should hear all about it. I just reserve judgment of what Schanberg says. </p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s hope the whole truth about all POWs and MIAs comes out. They are not forgotten. To close, here&rsquo;s a short, harrowing clip of an American POW: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgelmcOdS38" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgelmcOdS38</a><br>

		<p>Watch old footage of how McCain treated the POW/MIA family members when they were in congress for hearings, like dirt. Its on youtube for all to see, his is a man with no honor. Having grown up near Bragg during the war I well remember that all the adults knew that men were left behind and nothing was done due to politics. He has been a real life manchurian candidate who relied on the reputation other men earned.</p>
