			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Eric Gorski, Los Angeles Times, May 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cheng [Jesse Cheng, a third-year Asian-American studies major at the University of California, Irvine] is part of a growing movement of minority students rallying around a new cause  &mdash;  fighting a budget crisis that&rsquo;s undermining access to higher education at a time when students of color have become a stronger demographic force.</p>
<p>&#8220;For a lot of students of color, this is our dream and our hope  &mdash;  to get to college,&#8221; said Cheng, who is about to start a one-year term representing students from all 10 University of California campuses on the system&rsquo;s board of regents. &#8220;We never thought we&rsquo;d make it and we&rsquo;re here. And we&rsquo;re not going to give it up so easily.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But a visit to a developing activist hotspot like UC-Irvine  &mdash;  where tensions have run high this year over everything from student tuition hikes to gender-neutral bathrooms and Middle East politics  &mdash;  illustrate the challenges involved.</p>
<p>The increased diversity of students, many of them the first in their families to attend college, is both a strength and a liability. Splits have emerged over tactics and agendas, making coalition-building more challenging than ever.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At 27,000-student UC-Irvine, the scene includes a Pakistani-American working behind the scenes on budget issues as her own financial aid disappears, a Filipino-American struggling to shake fellow Asian students from political apathy and a gay African-American activist who thinks the focus on student fees obscures larger problems like the evils of capitalism.</p>
<p>The fact that students of color are at the forefront of campus protests marks a significant shift, said Arthur Levine, a former president of Teachers College at Columbia University in New York who has studied student activism.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the past, minorities have tended to provide leadership for the minority protests,&#8221; Levine said. &#8220;Now they&rsquo;ve moved to center stage. They&rsquo;re leading the protests.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About 1,000 people, a big crowd for a campus often maligned as apathetic, crowded onto the steps and filled an area between two flagpoles on March 4, a national day of college student demonstrations against tuition hikes and program cuts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The momentum building over budget problems, Johnston said, &#8220;speaks to the demographic transformation of the student body. In the 1960s, the average student was coming from a family of means, someone who was white, male, with a history of academic achievement in the family. In 2010, none of those things are as likely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Johnston said the combination of students of lesser means taking on greater loans and American public higher education buckling under diminished state support and recession is a recipe for greater student engagement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s more than just fighting for what&rsquo;s morally right,&#8221; said Sanchez, who has a Mexican father and Costa Rican mother and describes fighting for access to honors programs and Advanced Placement courses in high school. &#8220;It&rsquo;s righting the wrongs of our own experiences, the stuff we&rsquo;ve gone through, for our brothers and sisters and generations after.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At UC-Irvine, capturing students&rsquo; attention is another challenge shaped by cultural currents.</p>
<p>Many Asian and Asian-American students, who are by far the largest racial group on campus at 47 percent of the student body, come from more moderate to conservative families and shy from political action, said Justine Calma, who became involved in campus activism by co-chairing a Filipino student organization.</p>

<p>They don&rsquo;t seem afraid they will be kicked out&hellip; unlike white students who seem afraid to say anything. Like, say, about how the entire university is &#8216;committed&rsquo; to diversity - no matter the cost and hardship it will take to bring it campus - while at the same time there is not a single student organization dedicated to whites. How about a little diversity of thought, of all places, at their campus of higher learning?</p>

		<p>These are children who have been brainwashed since kindergarten by the liberal left politics which has infected all public education, and even some of the parochial education like Catholic schools.  That&rsquo;s the reason they&rsquo;re &#8220;activists.&#8221;  The evils of capitalism indeed; capitalism is why a university like UC Irvine exists - but these ignorant little fools haven&rsquo;t the capacity to think of that.  The fact is, they can activate and protest until Jesus comes, but it will have absolutely no effect because the reality is, THERE IS NO MONEY IN CALIFORNIA.  Period end of report.  It&rsquo;s kind of like a kid screaming for a soft drink when there&rsquo;s nothing but milk in the refrigerator.  Dumb!</p>

		<p>That &#8220;people of color&#8221; have become a stronger demographic force is one of the main reasons California is suffering from a budget crisis in the first place.  When California becomes majority black and Hispanic it will be able to support public higher education about as well as Guatemala and Haiti do today.</p>
<p>White people are leaving California because they are tired of paying for the care, feeding, and upkeep of an increasing third world horde.  The liberals wanted diversity, let them rot in it.</p>

____________</p>
<p>The problem is, is that once whites leave and take their money with them the third world hordes realize they have to depend on themselves and guess what they do? They look around and see where the whites have moved to and they follow hot on their heals. I live in Las Vegas, NV and it&rsquo;s happening here. </p>

<p>WHAT&rsquo;S THIS? an underachieving Asian?? I suspect a degree in ASIAN-AMERICAN studies is about as useful in China as a BLACK STUDIES degree is in Africa.</p>

<p>Wait a minute - i thought diversity was a strength, or an asset, or a panacea for all that ailed society.  Now the minorities (majorities) are finding that they have little in common on the personal, social or cultural level, and they can do little more than unite on the &#8216;gimme more&rsquo; protests that other, ahem, groups have done for years.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, America owes nothing to immigrants because they can&rsquo;t claim &#8216;centuries of oppression.&rsquo;  On the other hand, as was pointed out, the lefties have been brainwashing the kids for a long time now into believing that the government is A) the source for all cures and B) the source of all evils - if it&rsquo;s run by whites.</p>
<p>The reality is, the fewer whites you have, the less of a tax base you have.  Most immigrants come from horribly corrupt and disfunstional countries where few pay taxes, bribes and a culture of kleptocracy are the norm.  Are we to assume they leave those ways behind when they come on our shores?</p>
<p>In CA the minorites have a huge under the table economy.  Many don&rsquo;t pay taxes.  They have a mentality of my ethnic group first, to hell with the rest.  It just goes on and on.  Diversity is not a strength but a plague.</p>

<p>I would advise you to google Youth for Western Civilization. It is a modest organization and I have had troubles getting enough interest on my liberal campus to start a chapter. Nonetheless it is a start. </p>
<p>Often I am crucified for my opinions in class, but I still stand up. My schoolwork always assaults the Zeitgeist on issues from Feminism to Race and I still manage to get better grades than the sheeple. </p>
<p>I know several friends who have experiences similar to mine. I injustice is every done to any of us, we will call on FIRE for defense. FIRE is another organization you should look up. I am hoping to get into a graduate school with close ties either to FIRE or YWC.</p>
