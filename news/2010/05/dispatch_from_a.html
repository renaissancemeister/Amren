<h1>Dispatch from a BNP Activist</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Private correspondence, May 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It&rsquo;s eve of poll.</p>
<p>We in the BNP have 337 candidates in the ring, according to the spreadsheet the Party itself will be using to record results (of which I have a copy). An unprecedented effort by the Movement in Britain, mounted by a small organisation. No mean feat.</p>
<p>Unlike the 1979 campaign, there are no candidates put up with no vestige of a campaign to make up numbers  &mdash;  everyone is supposed to have at least an A5 election address going out. Though I suspect a few campaigns have screwed up on this and I know the Post Office in some Red-ruled Sorting Offices has put spanners in the works, notably in Chelmsford where 45,000 addresses have been &#8220;lost&#8221;. Over 300 at least will have full election addresses put out to all voters and in at least half there will be some sort of decent campaign. But unlike 1979 all the candidates actually exist and all of them know who they are standing for! An unprecedented effort, in which the Party is punching rather above its weight.</p>
<p>The targets are:</p>
<p>1) Get at least one MP. Probability about 1 in 3 in Barking (according to Nick G and the bookies&rsquo; odds) and I&rsquo;d say about 1 in 4 in Stoke Central. There are a few 1 in 10 chances, depending on exactly how the votes of the other parties break  &mdash;  we are in some 3-way marginals. Also polling figures consistently understate our support. I&rsquo;d be surprised if we got a seat, but this is the first General Election in which the very idea is not ludicrous.</p>
<p>2) Take control of Barking Council  &mdash;  about a 40% chance here. The campaign has been hard-fought and vast effort put in. we could also win some other Council seats around the country.</p>
<p>3) Come 2nd in at least 1 seat  &mdash;  never done in a General Election. I will be disappointed if this is not achieved.</p>
<p>4) Get the highest ever Nationalist vote  &mdash;  topping the million-vote mark. More difficult because unlike the Euro-elections there are about 50% of seats where we can&rsquo;t get any votes because we&rsquo;re not standing. We could achieve all of 1-3 and still fail here (and if so I doubt anyone would care!)</p>
<p>5) Avoid a damaging morale collapse afterwards if the members are disappointed. I&rsquo;d regard hitting 2 of 4 as a solid success, but they may despair if we don&rsquo;t get (1). I hope not.</p>
<p>There is no doubt the public are pissed off with corrupt pols and issues like Immigration  &mdash;  famously provoking Brown to mutter about a &#8220;bigoted woman&#8221; when he thought the mike was dead  &mdash;  in fact she was a typical working-class Northern granny the bedrock of Labour&rsquo;s core support. Assuming the media-created Cleggmania boosting the smarmy LibDem leader does not fool enough of the people enough of the time, we may yet see heartening surprises.</p>
<p>Keep an eye not just on Barking but the Stoke seats, and some in Yorkshire like Barnsley, Dewsbury, and Morley. The North-West may poll well in spots also. And maybe somewhere nobody expected.</p>
<p>We live in interesting times, times I long doubted I&rsquo;d ever see.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see how well they do and what can be learned by it. Perhaps they&rsquo;ll be able to put a stop to non-European immigration at some point. That would be a huge first step. The next step would logically be to encourage those non-Europeans already there to return to their countries of origin. After that the job might be to strengthen the social fabric so that the weakness and decadence that allowed it to take place in the first instance gets weeded out.   </p>

		<p>Just in the nick of time, almost a standard fiction thriller.  Great Britain, as well as most of the West, had better get it fast.  We are less than two generations away from utter destruction.  For the US, read Civil War II, The Breaking Up of America.</p>

		<p>The fatal flaw of the BNP from my point of view is that it agrees with the Marxists and Muslims it claims to despise in supporting defeat for Britain and victory for Britain&rsquo;s enemies in Iraq and Afghanistan.  To think that the postwar British nationalist Right, which began with the League of Empire Loyalists, would come to this!</p>

		<p>I think the above targets were a bit too optimistic, though I suppose that&rsquo;s the frame of mind you need to approach elections with. As with many European nationalist parties, the votes see their ups and downs but the overall longer-term trend is upward. I expect them to do much better at the next election, which may be sooner than expected if the global economy takes another turn for the worse, which is becoming an increasingly possible, if not likely, scenario.</p>

		<p>For good or ill, the British electorate has stayed loyal to the two main parties, Conservative and Labour.</p>
<p>One Green was elected in Brighton, an electoral area roughly comparable to Berkeley, California or Greenwich Village. Fringe candidates of Left and Right have been rejected.</p>
<p>With the exception of the Soviet-subsidized - and Soviet-disciplined - Communist Party of Great Britain, extremist parties in Britain either implode or tear themselves apart.</p>
<p>An outbreaking of bloodletting within the BNP began shortly before the election; starting within hours of the opening of the polls on Thursday 6th May with the man in charge of the BNP online website throwing a spanner into the works, screaming about the way he&rsquo;d been treated by the BNP leadership.</p>
<p>Next came a PR semi-disaster; unprovoked, the BNP&rsquo;s actual candidate in person taunted some &#8216;Asian youths&rsquo; in Barking, one of whom spat at him in response and then - in front of the hostile media&rsquo;s cameras - the BNP candidate lashed out at one of the &#8216;youths&rsquo; hard enough to knock him down; he then proceeded to punch him as he lay on the ground &hellip; all this in front of cameras.</p>
<p>One frankly bloddy despairs of the BNP.</p>

		<p>To Bill Corr,</p>
<p>I saw the video of the BNP candidate getting in to a confrontation with some Asian youths and didn&rsquo;t think the White guys came off badly at all.</p>
<p>Some Asian youths confronted perfectly respectable candidates insulted them, challenged them and then one spit in the face of the BNP candidate, where-upon the BNP candidate fought back, was knocked down, got back up and defended himself. No weapons were used, no racist slurs and once the Asians were beaten back a bit, the BNP activists stopped fighting.</p>
<p>I thought they looked fine, I hope Jared Taylor does as well the next time he is attacked by Canadian AntiFa.</p>
<p>Hey White folks, it&rsquo;s OK to stand up for yourself, our people when you/we are insulted and physically attacked by NWs. </p>
<p>This will not cause you to lose votes or the respect of regular Whites.</p>

		<p>Does &#8216;Irish&rsquo; honestly believe it in to be in the interests of Britain to have forces in Afghanistan or Iraq? Or even in the interests of the USA?</p>
<p>In an unguarded moment, Alan Greenspan said that the Iraq war and occupation was &#8220;about oil&#8221; and nobody can even begin to imagine what on earth the mess in Afghanistan is about.</p>
<p>The Dubai real estate glossies tell us that President Hamid Karzai owns a cute little white palace on one of the Dubail palm islands. If he can manage such a purchase on his modest official salary he&rsquo;s a far better money manager than I am. </p>
<p>It is widely believed in Kabul that Karzai&rsquo;s brothers are in the opium and / or heroin trade. We all know what Karzai thinks of Western attempts to supervise free and fair elections in his benighted country.</p>
<p>No Brad, Tad, Bud, Chuck or Leroy should risk his life for such a gang of crooks as the Afghan government.</p>
<p>To the Chicagoan, I&rsquo;d say just this: if the issue of the Barking assault drags out into a court case, we&rsquo;ll hear the whole story in all its sorry detail. In the meantime, it was a grotesque public relations &#8216;own goal&rsquo; for the BNP as they say in soccer parlance.</p>

<p>80% of the British people were against the current war. They have every right to follow their own people&rsquo;s will rather than the desires of certain powerful men. </p>
<p>Besides, why in the hell is the current conflict in Afghanistan/Iraq necessary for the people of Great Britain? Are they getting their old territories back? Nope, just helping to keep corrupt muslims in charge, as always. Wasted blood.</p>

		<p>While there were some disappointments for the BNP yesterday, i.e. no seats, and Nick G actually went a slight step backwards in Barking, proving that every dog doesn&rsquo;t always have his day, there were a lot of districts where the BNP went from no presence five years ago to fourth place now.  BTW, that Labour woman who represents Barking?  I swear to some ineffectual deity, if it weren&rsquo;t for the word &#8220;fascist,&#8221; she would have nothing to say   &mdash;   I saw her on the BBC last night, using that word with every other word out of her mouth to describe what &#8220;she was fighting,&#8221; though she did not mention Nick G or the BNP by name.  On top of that, the main anchor at the BBC election desk must have used the word &#8220;racist&#8221; and &#8220;ilk&#8221; to describe Nick G and the BNP at least five times.  Perhaps &#8220;ilk&#8221; in Brit parlance doesn&rsquo;t have the same derogatory connotation that it does in American English. </p>
<p>Overall, the BNP went from 0.7% of the vote in 2005 to 1.9% yesterday.  In England alone, went from 0.8% to 2.1%, in Wales, it went from 0.1% five years ago to 1.6% yesterday.  It was not expected to do anything in Scotland (Labour happy) and Northern Ireland (different parties there), and indeed it did not.  And the worst news is that the BNP lost a lot of local seats, including all that did did hold within the Barking MP district.</p>
<p>It may not be much, but you have to build on something.</p>
<p>After Obama won, David Cameron said that he wanted his party to find &#8220;Britain&rsquo;s Obama.&#8221;  He ran two black Tories in two different districts, and both lost.  Tee hee.</p>
<p>Jacqui Burqua, the Home Secretary who banned the radio talk show host born Michael Alan Weiner from entering the UK, lost her seat.  George Galloway, who never met a Muslim suicide bomber he didn&rsquo;t like, lost too.</p>
<p>As for those who are going to hold power, I don&rsquo;t think Cameron&rsquo;s immigration proposals will make any difference for the better, and in fact, with his demand for legal immigrant visas, I think it will make it worse for (channeling Jupiter) native born white middle and working class Britons.  However, what few restrictions he wanted will probably have to be tossed to make any sort of deal with the Liberal Democrat Party to make him PM.</p>

		<p>7) Same here, I thought they came off looking fine.  The &#8220;asians&#8221; initiated the fight, and then lost it.  When it became clear that they had won, the white BNP members backed off.  All this to one of the BNP guys going &#8220;calm down, calm down&#8221; constantly to all involved.</p>
<p>What WOULD have been pathetic was if he had just backed off after being spit on the face.  </p>
