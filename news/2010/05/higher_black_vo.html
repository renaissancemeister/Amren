<h1><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/12/AR2010051204687.html">Higher Black Voting Rates in 2008 Mostly Occurred in South, Report Says</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carol Morello, Washington Post, May 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A sharp rise in African American voting rates in the 2008 presidential election was largely a Southern phenomenon, according to a Census analysis of voting patterns released Wednesday.</p>
<p>The South was the only region in the country where the voting rate among blacks increased sizably from the 2004 election, from 59 percent to 66 percent. The West, Northeast and Midwest had smaller increases in black voting rates, but they did not represent a significant change, the Census said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About 64 percent of voting-age Americans went to the polls. Nationally, 5 million more Americans voted than four years earlier, including 2 million more African Americans and 2 million more Hispanics. But the voting-age population increased by 9 million during that period, so the turnout rate remained roughly the same and the percentage of registered voters decreased slightly.</p>
<p>Political scientists and voting rights advocates said the jump in the number of Southern black voters was larger than in other regions because African Americans there had historically voted at lower rates than blacks outside the South. In 2008, only the Midwest had a higher black turnout rate, at 67 percent, and the West and Northeast lagged behind the South.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Census Bureau analysis found voting rate increases among young and middle-age black Southerners, but no increase among black voters 65 and older. Voting by non-Hispanic white voters over 65 did increase, though, and about 4 million more Southerners went to the polls in 2008 than in 2004.</p>

		<p>In other words, the two groups of people that voted way more in 2008 over 2004 were non-elderly blacks in the South, and whites in the South.  What this was were the blacks going to the polls to vote for a black President, and whites going to the polls to prevent there being a black President.  In other words, a racial headcount.</p>
<p>Outside of VA, NC and FL, this strategy didn&rsquo;t work for the other side.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s simple   &mdash;   there are still more blacks in the south than there are anywhere else in the country, and black churches are practically PACs. Every black guy here is a reverend, and it has far more to do with politics than religion.</p>

		<p>Yeah, I have an uncle that is obsessed with the black race. Hes in Georgia and Georgia is the &#8216;mecca&rsquo; to blacks. Theyre everywhere. They drive better vehicles than most Whites. They live in nice neighborhoods that eventually turn to slums after 2 years. They all have cell phones and big wheels, no matter the &#8216;position&rsquo; in life theyre in. MOST of the government jobs here are filled with blacks. Theres a White in charge, but many minions under him/her.<br/>
When we see the road-crews around here you rarely see Whites. Its always blacks or mexicans. And Whites are putting them in these spots.</p>
<p>The south is in a warped-out state of affairs&hellip;.and it seems the rest of the Country is following suit.</p>
