<h1>Iowa Minority Grad Rates Better</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Omaha World-Herald, May 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Graduation rates of minority students at Iowa&rsquo;s three regent universities show improvement over the past 10 years.</p>
<p>Still, minority students at the University of Iowa, Iowa State University and the University of Northern Iowa especially black, Hispanic and American Indian students graduate at lower rates than their white peers, with the biggest gap between black and white students.</p>
<p>Officials say it&rsquo;s troubling, and the State Board of Regents last month made closing that gap a priority of the new strategic plan. The goal is to close the gap in six-year graduation rates for some minorities by 50 percent at each university by 2016.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think all of us would love for there to be no gap,&#8221; said Regents President David Miles of West Des Moines, &#8220;but what is a goal that is achievable?&#8221;</p>
<p>University of Iowa Provost Wallace Loh said cutting the gap in half is doable, with the right programs that better connect students to the university.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The graduation gap is not universal across all minority groups. Asian-American students often have higher rates than white students. The goal for improving the rates applies to black, Hispanic and American Indian students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The minority graduation gap is a crisis nationally in higher education and before students arrive at college. Nationally, high school grad rates are about 70 percent, but rates for black, Hispanic and low-income students are lower, at slightly more than 50 percent, according to the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Black Student Union {snip} wants the university to have mandatory diversity training for faculty and staff and to find ways to get minority students more involved with campus activities and clubs, she said. A chapter of the NAACP also will launch soon, she said.</p>

		<p>To those who think that Asians are so much better and smarter. The Asians that come to the West come from wealthy and educated middle/upper-class families, there are almost no asylum seekers from India or China here. The Indians and the Chinese come as contractors for IT companies or students and later stay in the West. This is a classic brain drain.</p>
<p>Look at standard of living of the West and Japan (the most prosperous Asian country). The Japanese have extremely small flats and houses, the food over there is very expensive, no way Japan can be better than even Greece or Portugal, not to mention USA or Norway. </p>
<p>Asians don&rsquo;t belong here, the West is not their civilization and I feel very sorry for those of you who support them so much. </p>

		<p>Same old, same old. Why are school officials at Iowa&rsquo;s three regent universities perplexed by the lower graduation rates of Bantus, mestizos, and North American aborigines, compared to Caucasian and Asian students? Isn&rsquo;t this the pattern at practically EVERY college and university across the country, that&rsquo;s not a HBCU?</p>
<p>Of course, they&rsquo;re going to precribe the same useless, bromides - more money, more diversity, more programs for (non-Asian) minorities. If they think they&rsquo;re going to eliminate this gap in six years, they&rsquo;re living in a Pollyanna world. </p>

		<p>When are these persons going to GET that you can&rsquo;t make the proverbial silk purse out of a sow&rsquo;s ear???  It&rsquo;s the material you&rsquo;ve got to work with, people!!  Closing the achievement gap ain&rsquo;t going to happen, because the admins are assuming that the white and Asian achievement levels will remain the same.  They won&rsquo;t!  Whites and Asians are just as capable of improving as blacks and Hispanics and Native Americans - and they WILL continute to improve.  So no matter what kind of song and dance the admins put out, the whites and Asians are going to stay ahead of the others because they&rsquo;re (a)smarter, and (b)have a cultural tradition of studying hard to achieve their goals.  It&rsquo;s kind of like hitching a goat to a cart and putting a pole in front of the goat with a carrot on it.  No matter how hard he runs, that goat will never catch the carrot.  Same thing here.</p>

<p>I would say not falling further behind would be an achievable goal. If blacks put their minds to it. </p>

		<p>Now they have to go to Iowa to avoid the real issue. The insidious gap between Asians and everyone else.</p>

<p>You know what diversity training means.  Ebonics is an acceptable form of communication so don&rsquo;t grade harshly.</p>
<p>As for the mandatory program of &#8216;finding ways&rsquo; to get minority students involved.  Ahem, at college, you are supposed to rise to the occasion and SEEK OUT what interests you.  You can&rsquo;t just have everything handed to you.  Oh, wait, that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re used to!</p>

		<p>Because of the nature of these sorts of gaps, they can easily be closed through quota systems. In fact, we all know that it&rsquo;s done routinely both in the workplace and the schools. Simply divorce rewards from merit. Redistribute the fruits of success. Give people jobs, promotions, and pay raises as well as admission to universities, passing grades, and diplomas based on something other hard work, devotion, and intellect. </p>
<p>Result: closed gaps. </p>

As usual they have it backwards. It is the black students who need the training and if they cannot get involved in campus activities it is nobody&rsquo;s fault but their own. </p>

		<p><i>&#8220;Graduation rates of minority students at Iowa&rsquo;s three regent universities show improvement over the past 10 years.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Another way of saying that graduating has been made easier at those three schools.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;black, Hispanic and American Indian students graduate at lower rates than their white peers, with the biggest gap between black and white students.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>No, <i>really</i>?  Gee, I&rsquo;ve never heard <i>that</i> before.  You&rsquo;d think at at least <i>someone</i> in these schools would have heard that every other educational system in the entire country encounters this same mysterious &#8220;gap.&#8221;  </p>
<p><i>&#8220;The graduation gap is not universal across all minority groups. Asian-American students often have higher rates than white students. The goal for improving the rates applies to black, Hispanic and American Indian students.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Say&hellip;  Is it just possible that we can learn something from these statistics?</p>
<p>Naw, that&rsquo;d be Racism.  Let&rsquo;s keep our heads buried in the sand, where they won&rsquo;t have any forbidden thoughts.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The minority graduation gap is a crisis &hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>No, it isn&rsquo;t.  It&rsquo;s been there all along, and no &#8220;crisis&#8221; has developed yet   &mdash;   outside of anguished liberal minds, of course.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The Black Student Union {snip} wants the university to have mandatory diversity training for faculty and staff and to find ways to get minority students more involved with campus activities and clubs, she said. A chapter of the NAACP also will launch soon, she said.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Oh, of <i>course</i>!  How could I not have seen it all along?  Evil White Racism is the culprit!  Has to be.  No doubt about it.  Black failure could <i>never</i> be the responsibility of blacks themselves.  Why, it&rsquo;d be Racist even to suggest such a thing.</p>

		<p>I have the PERFECT solution to REVERSE the white vs. black gap and the white vs. Indian gap.</p>
<p>Import large number of dark skinned people from India and call them Black and also call them &#8220;Indian&#8221; (yes, I know dot but not feather but we share the same name).</p>
<p>Indian dotheads have the highest test scores in the U.S. and we will fill all the liberal quotas without causing crime and welfare and being model citizens.</p>

		<p>AND, from my experience at these schools, in Iowa, blacks get grades based on color, NOT performance. Most female blacks go free, no matter what their GPA. They wish to boost numbers of enrollment and graduates, making IA a degree spewing machine, making others, with degrees AND intelligence, looks like these same people. In IA, there is a MAJOR push towards getting ridiculous &#8216;certifications&rsquo; - as if a college degree isn&rsquo;t enough?</p>
<p>Apparently not with these people lowering the bar- to the bottom. These colleges are run and funded by EXTREME liberals.</p>
<p>Time to leave Iowa too. Go to a big city, join a Union, get your experience an start a business later on, after you have mastered your skill. </p>
<p>In the US today, a degree and even experience mean nothing.<br/>
