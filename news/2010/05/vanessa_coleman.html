<h1>Vanessa Coleman Acquitted of First-Degree Murder</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jamie Satterfield, Knoxville News Sentinel, May 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As the words &#8220;not guilty&#8221; reverberated against the walls of a Knox County courtroom Thursday, the faces of those gathered told the tale behind the otherwise silent reaction.</p>
<p>Slaying victim Christopher Newsom&rsquo;s loved ones looked on with shocked grief; Channon Christian&rsquo;s family with disgust; and suspect Vanessa Coleman&rsquo;s parents with bittersweet disappointment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Coleman simply grinned as a panel of Davidson County residents declared her legally blameless in the murder and related crimes committed against Newsom. The same jury deemed her a legal understudy to the principal actors in the same offenses committed against Christian.</p>
<p>This nine-woman, three-man jury spent nearly a dozen hours deliberating and another half hour reciting their findings. There were 32 counts, ranging from first-degree murder to theft, and more than 300 choices within those primary charges.</p>
<p>On every possible crime involving Newsom, the panel deemed Coleman not guilty. On every count directly involving Christian, the panel opted for the lesser crime of facilitation.</p>
<p>The verdicts show the group rejected the prosecution&rsquo;s theory that Coleman, 22, was either a direct participant in the January 2007 torture slayings or criminally responsible for the trio already convicted as the chief architects of the criminal enterprise  &mdash;  Lemaricus Davidson, Letalvis Cobbins and George Thomas.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Facilitation of Christian&rsquo;s slaying comes with a possible penalty range of 15 to 25 years. Lesser crimes, including facilitation of her kidnapping and rape, carry penalty ranges of eight to 12 years. It will be up to Baumgartner [Criminal Court Judge Richard Baumgartner] to decide the sentences she should face in each of the facilitation convictions and whether those punishments should be served one after another or at the same time. He set a July 30 sentencing hearing.</p>

		<p>Once again I recall the international news when Don Imus made his famous remarks about the Rutgers womens basketball team.</p>
<p>Imus made his remarks in April 2007, four months after the Knoxville horror. I recall my parents were well informed by the mainstream news about Imus&rsquo; so-called &#8216;racist&rsquo; comment, but knew nothing about the racially-motivated Knoxville murders, because of the media&rsquo;s blackout of coverage.</p>

		<p>Betcha Hollywood won&rsquo;t make a movie out of this even though it has all the ingredients of race, crime, horrific-murder and sex. However, had the victim/criminal roles been racially reversed it would have be in theaters already. Whites simply are not to be portrayed as victims.</p>

		<p>The jury was from Nashville, had three blacks on it and the rest whites. The majority of the jury were women.</p>
<p>I watched the reading of the verdict on WBIR in Knoxville. The jury foreman (who sounded very intelligent, I have to admit, in the way he phrased some requests for clarification to the Judge) wasn&rsquo;t visible, but his voice certainly sounded black to me without doubt as he read the verdict.</p>
<p>Listening to the presumably black jury foreman intone one &#8220;not guilty&#8221; after another in his strong and authoritative black voice as he read through all the counts, while the picture on my screen was focused mainly on the bowed pale necks of the parents of the victims, with Chris Newsom&rsquo;s mother slowly shaking her head&hellip;it was a sad and infuriating snapshot of a an entire people defeated, stymied, conquered (not by blacks IMO, but by the activist groups and individuals who put blacks in the position they&rsquo;re now in in our society).</p>

		<p>Relax everyone! Her trial was more of a public relations farce than a search for justice. She had no more chance of beating all those charges than becoming an astronaut. She will die in prison or about 5 years after she gets out. She could not have been given the death penalty even if convicted on murder 1.  At sentencing the judge will stick the court house up her. If she gets less than 15 years I will write an &#8221; Apologia &#8221; ala St. Patrick and eat my Dell oldie.<br>

<p>Right you are Anon.#3</p>
<p>I was close to a shouting match with some of my colleagues over this last week. I mentioned the Christian/ Newsome murders and characterized them as atrocities. They had never heard of the situation. They then turned the discussion to criticisms of Rush Limbaugh, Marc Levin, Michelle Malkin et al. I could hardly contain myself. They just don&rsquo;t want to see. </p>
<p>It must suck to be such a clueless leftist.  They kvetch over  the Black victims in Darfur while at the same time avoiding any comment about the Arab Muslims who are committing the genocide.</p>
<p>Not a mention however about the massacre of the White farmers in SA. When I asked why there was so much attention given to Darfur but nothing about SA, I was told that &#8221; They are completely unrelated situations&#8221;. </p>
<p>As Johnny Carson would have said, &#8220;OOOOOK. Moving right along now&#8221;. </p>

<p>MSM won&rsquo;t tell you it was race crime, but you can always expose the MSM bigotry against Whites and their habit of never blaming Race for anything done against Whites by blacks.</p>
<p>Just ask:  &#8220;Did the &#8216;gathered community of young African Americans know that their victims were White?&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course they knew, therefore, Race was a factor, and always is, and always will Be.</p>

		<p>Under segregation, blacks were kept under control. Now they aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>This crime happened because the apt. complex where the victims were carjacked is integrated.</p>
<p>The ringleader of the attackers, Lemaricus Davidson, came to that apt. complex the night of the carjacking to pay some money for furniture he&rsquo;d bought from a black lady drug client of his who lived there, Ethel Freeman.</p>
<p>Channon Christian was at that same apt. complex that night because she was visiting a white friend of hers who lived there, Kara Sowards.</p>
<p>When the South was segregated 60 years ago, a black drug addict who purchased drugs from a black thug who&rsquo;d already served time for a previous carjacking would not have been living in the same apt. complex as a nice middle class young white girl.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so simple. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve posted the above over and over and over (in slightly different form to get by the censors) at knoxnews.com, the source of the original article above, and I&rsquo;ve never gotten a single response. I think there&rsquo;s no longer a place in people&rsquo;s minds for the concept of segregation.</p>

<p>Those powerful leftists who have control over these things (not blacks) are totally committed to an open society&hellip;. simply because that is good for them. They are not concerned about what is good for the rest of us.  They absolutely will not have segregation ever again, and will fight it bitterly (as they did before) &hellip; because that concept is threatening to them. All doors must be kept open. That same reason why national borders must be kept open, giving us the imigration invasion that we are experiencing today.</p>
<p>Desegration, integration, immigration &hellip; they are all linked.<br>
And they will continue, so long as powerful elements consider them to be in their interest.</p>

		<p>Anon #9: My advice is don&rsquo;t try to reason with unreasonable leftists lest you may lose your sanity, and become as insane as they are. With only one small part of their brain working they can&rsquo;t comprehend reality. Don&rsquo;t look for sanity in an insane assylum. These people talk in code speak, unable to have an original thought or carry it to it&rsquo;s conclusion, therefore always returning to the usually irrelevant learned rhetoric they have been spoon fed. Thus driving a sane person to total frustration. </p>

		<p>#2 re: the media blackout&hellip;There&rsquo;s a booming business in black communities putting images of the dead on t-shirts (often drug dealers and rappers elevated to god-like status)  &mdash;  especially if they were murdered. On the other hand, you could print up a million t-shirts honoring the Knoxville Horror victims  &mdash;  or any other white murdered by a black  &mdash;  but it&rsquo;s doubtful you&rsquo;d even sell one.</p>

		<p>You must segregate the races by your lifestyle.  Avoid blacks at every opportunity.  Our government requires us by law to tolerate blacks on the job and in the market place, aside from them, avoid blacks and live in a state of caution (not fear).</p>
<p>They resent whites&rsquo;, see themselves as justified victims&rsquo;, and will commit any act of evil against whites&rsquo; thinking themselves justified.</p>
<p>Be wise and survive.</p>

		<p>Harumpty, your #12 comment sounds to me more like the Wichita Massacre, where two blacks invaded an apartment and killed everyone except one woman (who they mistakenly left alive).  Both this incident and the Knoxville Horror are notorious because the MSM barely (if even that) touched upon them.  <br>
You&rsquo;re right that during segregation such incidents were much rarer, because blacks were noticed by residents and often stopped by police whenever they came into white areas.  I often wonder if the Wichita Massacre victims opened their door to the two thugs who got inside.  <br>
Look at all the security measures this society has been driven to adopting.  Most of it is due to black criminals running loose.  Even in the rural, 3% black county in which I live, tiny branch libraries now have locked restrooms and controlled access computers.  </p>

<p>A T-shirt that I see a lot of blacks wear has the &#8220;WB&#8221; (Warner Brothers) logo on it.  Sometimes, the shirt has other wording on it, and sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t, but when it doesn&rsquo;t, the wording is implied.  It means &#8220;Warn-a-Brother,&#8221; as in &#8220;if you see the police, warn a brother.&#8221;  Carmelo Anthony, an NBA star, has such a tattoo.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget, Warner Brother is a property of one of the biggest media conglomerates in the world, Time-Warner.  Download one of their songs off the internet, and you&rsquo;ll see how quickly those copywrong extremists are protective of their &#8220;intellectual property.&#8221;  Yet, I have not heard of them suing the makers of the &#8220;Warn-a-Brother&#8221; shirts for copyright infringement.</p>

<p>&gt;  I agree completely.  However, what started off as a left wing idealogy led by admitted communists like MLK, Malcom X, and even Dubois and other blacks since the early part of the 20th century, it has lately come to be an advantage of capitalists who want cheap labor and a sort of unofficial monarchy to rule over everyone.  They are arrogant enough to think that they can do it and not be touched by the social/decline/de-evolution of humanity.  They also seem quite prepared to sell their children in order to keep their momentary illusion of control and self-engrandizement.</p>
<p>None of the politicians count for much, they are mostly interested in getting a vote.  It does appear that the Arizona situation could be the beginning of some sort of turning point.  But as we can see in Thialand, real change requires more than posting on the internet or even holding political meetings.</p>
<p>One thing we are forgetting when it comes to the Christian/Newsom trial; when this story did get national exposure, it was early on when the Nazi party held a rally.  The victim&rsquo;s families shied away from any connection to them.  Racial Realists must realize that few people, even of those who regularly post here, could subscribe to the myths the Nazi party perpetuates and the awful vision they represent.  This isn&rsquo;t the way we are going to get publicity for well-thought-out arguments for white rights and indigenous white accomodation.</p>
<p>As JRR Tolkien, a great promoter of Northern European culture and traditional values wrote of Hitler and the Nazis; &#8220;They have poisoned, for all time, the rich Nordic myths and sagas as they may be applied to modern culture.  The Nazis are the death of our culture.&#8221;  Remember you Nazi sympathizers out there, that Hitler ended up turning on his own German people and condemned them, after they had given him their entire allegience and made sure their fall and suffering was worse than it had to be.  </p>
<p>The way forward must be well thought-out and intelligently objective.<br>

		<p>Last night was refreshing my memory with regard to the Alday case. From way back when in 1973. Georgia! Whole family wiped out by intruders. Three of the perps were sentenced to death and it took 31 years before even one of them was executed. The other two got life after a second trial. Expect this one to last a long time too with appeals for the one evil-doer sentenced to death.</p>

		<p>22) They are only poisoned because we look at them that way.  The Nazi &#8216;guilt by association&rsquo; blasphemy only works if you allow yourself to be silenced by it.</p>
<p>Look at Eugenics.  A perfectly valid field of science, discredited because of &#8220;oooh nazis!&#8221;  Just because the Nazis did something, does not mean it was bad. </p>
<p>The trick is to simply counter-accuse liberals of hiding behind Godwin&rsquo;s Law because they have no true argument.  Works everytime.  They either have to come up with a legitimate counter-argument(which is rather hard, as they don&rsquo;t have one) or lose the debate in the eyes of everyone with half a brain.</p>

		<p>section 8 housing is the biggest evil. Give blacks checks each month so they can afford to live with their welfare in the same neighborhoods as working class whites. its disgusting and disturbing that this is allowed. </p>

		<p>The Nazi &lsquo;guilt by association&rsquo; blasphemy only works if you allow yourself to be silenced by it.</p>
<p>Look at Eugenics. A perfectly valid field of science, discredited because of &ldquo;oooh nazis!&rdquo; Just because the Nazis did something, does not mean it was bad. <br>
**********************</p>
<p>Hey, you&rsquo;re right.  The nazis also breathed.  Does that mean we should all stop breathing?  </p>
<p>You have to look at the actual issue at hand, and not be influenced by the smear someone has attached to it.  The left are cunning at this, and they could smear ANYTHING   &mdash;    if they want to.</p>

		<p>The fact that our judges and politicians are evil personified is the reason for our lack of justice. </p>
<p><br>
The fact that we have an unaccountable federal government beyond the reach of those who elected them, is the REASON we have a lack of justice.</p>
<p>The solution is even now beginning to manifest.  The states, most of them anyway, are working very hard to &#8220;nullify&#8221; federal law.  In the beginning, this will be about specific issues&hellip;immigration law enforcement, denial of Obamacare, right to bear arms, abortion (all of these are areas actively being nullified right now by various states).  This will then become about state soveriegnty OVER federal authority.  The first state to kick out the federal judiciary over obvious lack of upholding the law will start a tsunami of this.  The final stage will be tax revolts.  Look to see state governments to collect taxes locally and deny those funds to the federal government.  Many will create their own reserve banks (like North Dakota has).  Many will look to create their own currencies (like Indiana is).  The federal government won&rsquo;t collapse, it will just become an unfunded joke nobody pays attention to anymore.  Nobody will pay any attention to SCOTUS.  Who is president or in congress won&rsquo;t matter much.</p>
<p>What WILL matter is who controls your state government.  And there will be great differences from one state to another.  It will start with immigrants (ie Arizona) and welfare (ie California) but morph into places where normal, decent (ie white) people live and where crackheads live.  It will be obvious if you belong or not.  Expect great hassles if you are where you do not belong.  Mexicans pulled over every 5 minutes to check their greencards (which will become few and specific to states), those with criminal records arrested on sight (ie blacks).</p>
<p>Race won&rsquo;t be mentioned&hellip;.not in the beginning. But this will be all about race.  Where you live will be of overwhelming importance.  Expect nothing at all in the way of justice (think zimbabwe) in black areas.  But also expect safety, security and prosperity in the &#8220;good&#8221; areas.</p>
<p>The new thing for the next decades is forced acceptance of consequences for where you live.  It&rsquo;s happening because the ability to diffuse those consequences without anyone noticing has reached its limit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already happening.  Actually, it&rsquo;s quite advanced already.  So choose where you live carefully.  And avoid at all costs anything that might peg you as not being acceptable in a &#8220;good&#8221; area&hellip;..drug conviction, marriage to an illegal, &#8220;skinhead&#8221; tattoos (cough, cough, cough).  The US could easily end up with areas similar to that movie &#8220;Escape from New York&#8221;&hellip;..don&rsquo;t end up there, by accident, lol.</p>
