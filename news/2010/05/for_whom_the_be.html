			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dr. Jonathan David Farley, Huffington Post, April 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A recent email by Harvard law student Stephanie Grace allegedly asserts, &#8220;I absolutely do not rule out the possibility that African Americans are, on average, genetically predisposed to be less intelligent.&#8221; According to the Harvard Crimson newspaper&rsquo;s blog, this email was forwarded to black law student associations across the country.</p>
<p>Our outrage over the student&rsquo;s political incorrectness aside, are African-Americans less intelligent than whites? As an African-American who graduated summa cum laude in mathematics with the second-highest grade point average in his class at Harvard, I would have to say, Yes. Because the hypocrisy on the part of black Americans is stunning and self-defeating: Black Harvard economics professor Roland Fryer has written a research paper stating that African-Americans are less intelligent than whites.</p>
<p>In &#8220;Testing for Racial Differences in the Mental Ability of Young Children,&#8221; Fryer writes that &#8220;the results of our analysis do not preclude a possible role for a genetic contribution to racial differences in intelligence for a number of reasons.&#8221; He goes on to give three arguments in favor of the &#8220;genetic story&#8221; that the difference in IQ between blacks and whites comes down to A, C, T, and G.</p>
<p>Instead of being excoriated by blacks, Fryer is celebrated, with black Harvard alumna Soledad O&rsquo;Brien even interviewing Fryer for her CNN series, Black in America; she calls Fryer a &#8220;great guy.&#8221; Fryer&rsquo;s family sold crack, and he personally sold marijuana, stole money from McDonald&rsquo;s, and nearly murdered a white man. At a meeting organized by Harvard Law School professor Charles Ogletree about reducing the number of young black men in prison, the 1,000-person, mostly black audience convulsed with laughter when Fryer joked that he once thought of going into the pharmaceutical industry, street-side.</p>

		<p>There would still be outrage even if the &#8220;genetics&#8221; aspect were left aside, and one mad the irrefutable statement:  on the whole, blacks are less intelligent than whites.  Put it down to environment if you must.  And yet you still couldn&rsquo;t get the Harvardites to admit it.</p>

		<p>If you read the entire article from the Huffington Post, the writer, Dr Johnathan David Farley, is not only saying African Americans should be punished for their beliefs and their speech too, but that basically everyone who has incorrect beliefs (except himself) should be punished and held accountable. The thing is, according to latest in Black Studies, all whites are racist, so everything a white person might say is tainted. I would how many racial aware blacks would claim this article, or something else written by Mr Farley, is racist? That&rsquo;s basically been the program in America since for forever: Find a program or a policy you want and then claim or imply anyone who speaks against it is racist or insensitive. The entire country has been turned upside down in this manner and the more &#8216;sensitive&rsquo; we become, the more crime and incivility and a lack of values are everywhere. </p>
<p>In his call for&hellip; &#8216;standards&rsquo;, and to hold blacks accountable, too, is this Really about making sure whites are never allowed to speak up for themselves, or is he sincere in what he says? </p>
<p>Or are these impassioned call for standards simply a last desperate attempt on the part of the left to bring order out of the very chaos they themselves have created?</p>
<p>Either way, it&rsquo;s a nice try, but it will take conservatives to bring sanity back to the modern world.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m suprised that AmRen choose to &#8216;snip&rsquo; the article after the fourth paragraph, as if you click on the original piece and continue reading it&rsquo;s rather illuminating. From the excerpt above you may infer that he is an open-minded and intellectually honest black man, but that&rsquo;s a misleaing impression. If you read on, he says that Ms Grace should &#8216;certainly&rsquo; be expelled for her &#8216;stupid, offensive, and easily refuted views&rsquo;. Despite the boldness of his statement, he fails to even attempt any refutation, and when challenged on his ridiculous assertion that the student should be expelled his glib response is &#8216;In Germany and Austria, it is illegal to express support for Nazism. I support that principle&rsquo;. I can scarcely imagine a more peurile &#8216;justification&rsquo; coming from anyone&rsquo;s mouth, let alone that of a Harvard graduate who holds the second-highest grade point average in his class. Dr. Farley is transparently a bigot who offers only the laziest justifications for his liberal prejudices.</p>

		<p>Farley, whose intellectual achievements are in fact real and admirable, excoriates Fryer for being part of the problem, essentially for his black attitudes.  Mr. Diversity also calls for the expulsion of the young lady who wrote the email in question. Yet on Farley&rsquo;s website he lists as his heroes Che Guevara, Fritz Fanon, Hannibal, and Jesus as his heroes.  Let&rsquo;s examine this and see whether one black kettle should be calling another black pot, black.  How anyone could put Jesus in the same class as a serial killer like Che Guevara is beyond me.  Maybe Farley likes to pretend Jesus is really black, just as he pretends Hannibal was really black.  Fritz Fanon was one of the left wing originators of blame whitey for everything, maintaining that it was racism or colonialism that perverted the blackmind. Farley&rsquo;s collection of heroes are either fantasies, murderers, or apologists for aberrant behavior.  Even blacks with legitimately high IQs seem to suffer from the black attitude.  So who is really the problem in the black community?  Blacks.</p>

<p><br>
I know I will be at odds with many on Amren when I say this but is IQ REALLY the problem with blacks?  In a rare moment of honesty, Fryer is admitting honestly what the few blacks of normal IQ only say behind closed doors, that most of blacks, especially outside the western world, have so little mental capacity that they can&rsquo;t maintain civilization and are basically wards of the state.  They are completely dependent on whites for survival.  More to the point, the few blacks that have normal IQ, do not care one iota about this or about them.  Their attitude is one where they are of use to keep them in a lavish style.  Pretending that IQ is not an issue enables them to open up opportunities by claiming racism keeps them down.  So they get far more than they otherwise could have on their own merits.  And based on their own races capacity for civilization, they would get nothing.  This is the attitude and behavior of almost every black of capacity high enough to fit in normal society.  And part of the reason they are in normal society is to keep away the perception of what the vast majority of blacks are like.</p>
<p>But is that the real issue here?  Fryer has the mental capacity to take part in civilization.  But is that the end of it?</p>
<p>I would argue no.  The real issue comes to light when you look at his past of anti-social, even violent behavior.  Were society to remove all blacks except those of normal IQ like Fryer, they would still be an incredible problem.  Their descendents would STILL be far more likely to be crack addicts, welfare dependents and criminals than future Harvard Professors.</p>
<p>The same simply can&rsquo;t be said about his white classmates.  And that.  THAT is the issue.  Blacks may largely lack the mental capacity to build and maintain civilization.  But that pales in comparison to the genetic propensity to destroy it.</p>
<p>Fryer is a dramatic example of this.</p>

		<p>Blacks have found a way to overcome their IQ shortcomings by successfully alleging that college and grad school admissions are a Civil Rights issue resulting in Affirmative Action.<br>
Therefore, we have many &#8220;educated blacks&#8221; who tend to fail in their AA gained professions.</p>
<p>In California a black candidate who failed the State Bar exam  several times concluded that the test must be racist. Maybe the next affirmative action will require a separate Bar Exam for blacks.</p>

<p>The only subject in this story that makes it a news story is that a black agrees that blacks are less intelligent than whites.</p>
<p>If he admitted that blacks are less intelligent than all the races of the earth, with the possible exception of Australian Aborigines, he would be closer to the truth.</p>
<p>If he wrote that I missed it, because I didn&rsquo;t want to read beyond the first couple of paragraphs, specifically because I&rsquo;m really not interested in what any black says.  If they all left for Mexico tomorrow it wouldn&rsquo;t be soon enough for me.</p>

		<p>Fryer is a very politicised researcher who promotes the idea of intellectual similarities. He tested children under the age of 1. Children under the age of 1 cannot be tested using language or analytical skills. They can only be tested on reflexes and motor-sensory abilities. </p>
<p>Fryer does admit in his conclusion that differences appear in life but only in &#8216;higher order thinking&rsquo; clearly an intellectual function he regards as inconsequential. He purports that such differences are due to environmental differences because they do not appear in the earliest stages of life. But it is far more likely that blacks do not develop these higher order skills to the same degree because they lack the genetic propensity, a propensity that cannot be expressed without language.</p>
<p>The way Fryer tries to show he is no different to blacks, in that he was a violent thief in his youth, suggests to me he is unlikely to be a good researcher rather than that all youth of all races behaves badly at a certain life stage, as he implies. </p>
<p>As for Dr. Jonathan David Farley, I suspect there is some subtefuge regarding his claims to be a talented mathematician. If he were, I doubt he would risk his reputation defending such biased, politicised &#8216;research&rsquo;. </p>

		<p>So, credit where it&rsquo;s due:  the man says the results of his research do not preclude a possible genetic contribution.  That&rsquo;s a lot more than I&rsquo;ve ever heard ANY black admit to.  Our day is coming, AmRenners!

<p>Yes, like you I can&rsquo;t seem to square with the contention that he is as accomplished as he claims, and it could be because there are so many lying claims made about blacks, by blacks or white dregs, that turn out to be false or greatly exaggerated.</p>
<p>Too, I&rsquo;ve never come across any black that is truly an intellectual.  </p>
<p>The Bell Curve indicates a scant few who would be in the 120 I.Q. range, but then there&rsquo;s nothing after that.  While 120-122 certainly can&rsquo;t be regarded as stupid, it certainly isn&rsquo;t a score that would place an individual in a superior range. </p>

		<p>There is  nothing  new  or  original  in Fryer&rsquo;s  research. What  he  is  professing  has  been  researched ad  nauseam. Sure, anything  is  possible!  It  is  possible that  there  are  genetic  differences of a cognitive nature between  Swedes(IQ 101), Croatians(IQ, 90), Irish(IQ 93) and  Greeks(IQ 92), but where  are  the  obsessive  research  papers on  this issue?</p>
<p>Greece is  now  facing  serious  economic problems and  have  to  be  bailed  out  by  the  IMF and  Germany.  The  Greeks  have  been  accused  of  being  corrupt, irresponsible, tax cheats living  beyond  their  means, etc., but  where are  the  arguments  suggesting  that  the reason  for  the  Greek  economic  problem  derives  &mdash;  I  write  this  tongue in cheek  &mdash;  from their  relative  lack  of  intelligence.</p>
<p>There  is  nothing  new  in  Fryer&rsquo;s  research  because there  have  been  many research  papers  comparing  the  IQ  scores of  identical  twins  reared  apart. One  such  effort was  that  of  Jensen&rsquo;s(1978)  who  claimed  that  for cohorts  of monozygotic twins  reared  apart  &mdash;  but  in similar  cultural  environments  &mdash;  the  average  IQ  gap  was between  6 and  7  points[Jensen&rsquo;s  paper  is  not  with  me  for the  exact  difference].  What  was  significant  about  the  data  though is  that  at  least  10%  of the  monozygotic twins  registered  IQ  gaps  of  at  least 14 points  &mdash;  in environments  that  were  culturally  on par.</p>
<p>The  black box  question  about  &#8220;intelligence&#8221; testing  is  what  impact  does the  environment  have on nominal scores?  The  obvious  answer is  that  it  depends on the difference  quotients  between the  environments in  question.</p>
<p>I  wonder  too whether his  research  pays attention  to  the  Flynn effect(James Flynn). </p>
<p>I  must  add  to  that  Fryer  seems  to  be  overly  mentored  by  the  likes of economists  like Levitt, Heckman, Summers and  Becker.   </p>

		<p>People should realize who Farley is, a black supremecist demagogue.  Funny enough, after 9-11, he teamed with a left wing German mathematician to score money from the US government to fight terrorism: <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/news/2006/march8/mterror-030806.html" rel="nofollow">https://news.stanford.edu/news/2006/march8/mterror-030806.html</a><br>
Here is the link about the East German leftist mathematician. (Farley and the German, Stefan Schmidt, founded Phoenix Mathematical Systems Modeling to loot taxpayer money from the government: https://www.c4ads.org/stefan.schmidt</p>
<p>Here is a collection of Farley&rsquo;s &#8220;writings&#8221; and a picture of him posing before his hero, Che Guevera (keep remembering how Farley got our tax money to &#8220;fight terrorism&#8221;): <a href="https://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/PEEPS/farley_jonathand.getsout.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/PEEPS/farley_jonathand.getsout.html</a></p>
<p>Farley also has founded a consulting company in, not surprisingly, Hollywood, to insert even more propaganda there: https://www.hollywoodmath.com/</p>

		<p>#8: For Whom the Bell Curves is not a great header, or at least not original. That title was very common 15 years ago. Either National Review or The New Republic used that very title on their front cover dealing with the Herrnstein/Murray book.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the webmaster here was unusually inattentive wrt Dr. Farley. Farley was being tongue in cheek, essentially saying blacks were dumb in trying to blame their problems on whites while simultaneously extolling the actions of thuggish blacks, the real destroyers of the black community. I certainly agree with him on that, but he was NOT agreeing that blacks in fact are less intelligent than whites.</p>
<p>As for his claim to being a mathematical prodigy, I have my doubts. His writing style is poor, and his musings unoriginal. He gives no indication whatsoever of possessing a fine intellect.</p>
<p>Incidentally, at my elite alma mater in the 80s a friend of mine, a physics major who earned campus money tutoring other students (often minorities) in physics, said he thought there was some kind of scholastic chicanery going on wrt minorties and their grades. Some of his &#8216;students&rsquo; received grades that he claimed they simply could not have earned had they taken tests of the same difficulty as he had at their stage in the major.</p>
<p>I have my doubts about the IQ of this Farley character, and not simply because I mistrust blacks and their inveterately outlandish claims in general &hellip;</p>

		<p>Taking the time to read the comments to the article posted at the Huffington Post is quite illuminating.  Farley vomits out anti-White comments that should easily draw more fire than what was written by the young lady, yet he gets a free pass.  </p>
<p>Of course, in our modern media any anti-White commentary gets a free pass.  It&rsquo;s a critical part of the agenda for disenfranchising us and transferring our power to other groups.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that White parents out there who are fortunate enough to be able to pay for their children to attend Ivy League schools will take a moment to reflect on the anti-White bile spewed by Farley, and realize you will be paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for people to indoctrinate YOUR children with anti-White propaganda.  Many of your children will swallow the lies hook, line, and sinker, and come out of those Leftist institutions hating themselves, their people, and of course their parents.</p>
<p>By some standards, that might be considered a poor return on your investment.  Choose wisely, folks - don&rsquo;t let your dollars be used against you.</p>

		<p>&#8220;As an African-American who graduated summa cum laude in mathematics with the second-highest grade point average in his class at Harvard, I would have to say, Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>  Of course, some blacks are more intelligent than most whites, but on AVERAGE black IQ&rsquo;s are lower than whites. Many intelligent blacks are quite aware of these differences. Dr. Farley is just being more honest than most in admitting it. </p>

		<p>What a deceptive headline, but I wouldn&rsquo;t expect anything less from the Huffington Posts. Ms. Grace did not say &#8220;blacks are dumber than whites&#8221;; she said she hadn&rsquo;t ruled out that possibility. There&rsquo;s a huge difference, but when you have an emotion-fueled agenda, it&rsquo;s usually best not to let facts get in the way.</p>

		<p>I attended UCLA in the early 1990&rsquo;s and financed my education with a series of grants and stipends reserved for those with high marks. As part of my research I looked into the grades of incoming freshman and was able to break down the academic levels of each race. Come to find out just one of six black frosh had the grades to be accepted in a color-blind setting. A few were legacies or athletic admits but the overwhelming majority were there because they were black. </p>
<p>Seminars at UCLA are revealing as the small class sizes meant we were all obliged to work with everyone else. Often the class would break down into small groups to work on a common assignment. The only black in the class was unable to write or read cursive English. He was sure a lot of help!</p>

		<p> I&rsquo;ve always found that those who argue against IQ differences seldom, if ever, include Asians in the discussion. In addition, I have no doubt these people also are fervent believers in Darwinian Evolution. This is curious because if peoples adapt and evolve due to different environments and isolation from other groups, then why is it argued that intelligence doesn&rsquo;t follow suit but supposedly remains equal across geography and time. PC obviously trumps reason.</p>

		<p>&#8220;read the comments to the article posted at the Huffington Post is quite illuminating. Farley vomits out anti-White comments that should easily draw more fire than what was written by the young lady, yet he gets a free pass&#8221;. </p>
<p>Lets not forget the anti-black comments Farley makes as well. According to his own logic, he should be doubly condemned, and promptly removed from any position of influence or anyplace where could be in contact with the public, or where he has even one employee under him. Except that Farly is part black, so he should be given a medal and a peace prize, because it&rsquo;s tough to rise above such a limited capability (sarcasm off).</p>

<p>You have a reading comprehension problem, don&rsquo;t you? Or maybe you, like Farley, suffer from ABM (Angry Black Man) syndrom and can&rsquo;t think straight when somebody points out the inconsistencies of your PC world view. Nothing in my post was related to Farley being PC. It was all about the rediculousness of calling for the expulsion of a student over some vague un-PC utterance.</p>
<p>You make yourself look foolish by demanding that nobody ever hold an un-PC view unless every scientist on Earth has conclusive proof (whatever that would be) and agrees with it. Open your eyes, there is a preponderance of evidence that this idea is true. (not part of the post but the idea being that blacks have lower IQ)</p>

		<p>This article illustrates what really annoys me. Isn&rsquo;t it obvious that from The Bell Curve onward that the claim of higher intelligence of non-Black people has NEVER been refuted. Yet blithering idiots go on as if it has. I suppose their collective amnesia and denial over the matter is part of their lower intelligence? Or maybe they believe that the current state of PC equals refutation?</p>

Farley has  more than proven  himself  in mathematics. At all  levels  you  either  know  how  to  solve  the  problem efficiently and correct or  you  don&rsquo;t.  At the  higher  level  you  have  to  know how  to do  proofs  of theorems. And you either have  the  gifts  to  be  very  or  great  or  not.</p>
<p>The  mathematics  department  at Harvard  had  absolutely  no  obligation  to  graduate Farley especially  in an  intellectually  demanding area  such  as  mathematics with  a  Summa cum Laude. He  then  did  a  Ph.D. at  Oxford  then  went  on to  win the Johnson Prize  for  solving a  problem than  many  tried but failed at.</p>
<p>You may  not  agree with his  writing  style or  his ideas  but  he will  solve  any  differential  equation put  before him in a  jiffy  while  you  will   will  never  know where  to  begin. </p>

20 years of seeking merited publication was finally given some<br>
conventional access by AR.  If this sort of dignified, quiet<br>

<p>You have no idea who I am, or what my quantitative accomplishments might be. After perusing Dr. Farley&rsquo;s bio, I acknowledge that my abilities in that regard could not begin to compare to his, who is certainly a rarum avis if ever I&rsquo;d heard of one. The exception that proves many rules.</p>
<p>I would note, however, that exceptional quantitative abilities can sometimes be found in otherwise quite mediocre, even stupid, persons. I have known several such, guys with near-perfect SAT quant scores who were regarded by everyone around them as not very bright. It has some relation to the idiot savant phenomenon. </p>
<p>Of course, one doesn&rsquo;t really know the extent to which his huge shelf of awards is truly earned. So breathless are the liberal cretins for any evidence of black intellectual achievement that they routinely heap honor after honor on any slightly promising black (consider the unreadable Toni Morrison&rsquo;s Nobel Prize, awarded but a few years following the death of the unawarded and immeasurably more talented Graeme Greene). Just look at the fawning news articles written about him. </p>
<p>I do know two things about this chump, however. First, his blogging displays a weak intellect. His reasoning is poor, and his writing is merely mediocre. Such traits are, I believe, consonant even with mathematical genius (which I don&rsquo;t think he is). Second, he is a PC, Marxist (love his cute picture with Che), white-hating ingrate who does not belong in America. Why doesn&rsquo;t he move to a black society, and try to raise the academic level there?   </p>
<p>Anyway, if he&rsquo;s so smart, why doesn&rsquo;t he publish his SAT, GRE, IQ, etc scores? I would bet up to $1000 that they are less impressive than his resume would lead us to expect.</p>

<p>It is ALWAYS ALWAYS the&rsquo; black/White or &#8216;hispanic/White&rsquo; achievement gap.  I have attended forced PC educational professional developments for over two decades and have never heard &#8216;the achievement gap&rsquo; couched in any other terms. </p>
<p>This is because Asians are not a part of the dirty War on Whites, waged by the msm, government, intelligentsia and academia which is the bottom line on their insistence that &#8216;There Are No Difference in IQs Between Whites, blacks and hispanics&rsquo; and &#8216;The Achievement Gap is Due Solely to Environmental Causes Caused by White Oppression.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The answer, of course, is ALWAYS billions (or, more realistically, trillions) of dollars for the newest, latest educational program that will &#8216;Finally Close the Achievement Gap Once and For All.&rsquo;  Along with this will be screams to &#8216;Shut Down the Projects!&rsquo; and &#8216;Close Failing Schools&rsquo; (read majority black/hispanic) and move violent, urban blacks into your White neighborhood via Section 8 or bus them into your White child&rsquo;s high achieving school in order to give black children a &#8216;better environment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This is nonsense, of course, because the over-arching goal of the hostile alien elite that controls the government is to eradicate Whites via terrorization, suppression of speech via Hate Speech laws, confiscation of arms, debasement of currency, anti-White federal laws imposed in the workplace and suppression of the huge amounts of black on White crime via the msm.</p>
<p>&#8216;Lifting blacks up&rsquo; is not and has never been the goal, any goal, as the hostile elite are well aware that this is not possible.  Blacks, and increasingly hispanics are used as battering rams against Whites.  Asians are needed to keep the lights on when we&rsquo;re finally eliminated.</p>

<p>Very perceptive and wise words that are worth re-reading and pondering!<br>
Do they sound extravagant?   Probably, to the uninitiated anyway. <br>
But she&rsquo;s right!</p>
<p>In truth, not all liberals are part of some sinister plot designed  to destroy White America. Most would laugh at the notion.  The majority are just naive  and well meaning  fellow travelers.   When I was a naive young liberal, I couldn&rsquo;t imagine it either.  The fact is that the great majority of  &#8220;liberals&#8221;  just go along because that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s expected. It&rsquo;s the thing to do. You have to say the right things and have the right ideas to be accepted and get ahead in this world, as it&rsquo;s structured.  The People In Control require it!   They are the ones who hold the purse strings. And the political power. </p>
<p>But when you look more closely at the ideals they espouse, and then follow through to  the inevitable outcome of those ideals, the destruction of White America  and the white race (our race!) is the unavoidable result.  Is that to our interest?  Some of us (former liberals)  began to perceive that the ideals promulgated to us by the &#8220;hostile elite&#8221;  (while deceptively  put forth as &#8220;humanitarian&#8221; and &#8220;virtuous&#8221;) are  anti-ourselves and that we would be foolish to continue supporting programs and ideas that are anti-us and that can only harm our people.   At that point is when we begin to wake up and do some  independent thinking and studying.  Bon lays it out very well.</p>
<p>I get the impression that very few  posters here are so well aware of the depth of the problem as Bon.  Many posters have asked, in bafflement, what can be the reason for this? What is going on?  Why would anyone want to do this?   I hope her  wise and laden words will be re-read and pondered by those who are confused and wondering about what is really happening.  It&rsquo;s not a simple subject with a quick and simple answer.  It&rsquo;s not out on the surface and immediately apparent.  The philosophical roots of this run very deep and need study.  I hope she&rsquo;s got some people thinking along the right track.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jonathan Farley, a black professor of mathematics, responded with a column for a Nashville newspaper claiming that the &ldquo;UDC honors traitors.&rdquo; He wrote that &ldquo;every Confederate soldier, by the mores of his age and ours, deserved not a hallowed resting place at the end of his days but a reservation at the end of the gallows,&rdquo; and went on to suggest that America&rsquo;s racial problems are rooted in the fact that &ldquo;the Confederacy was not thoroughly destroyed, its leaders and soldiers executed and their lands given to the landless freed slaves.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Approximately 1.2 million Confederate soldiers survived the war, and so what Prof. Farley called for was nothing less than the extermination of virtually the entire white male population of the South, along with a land distribution program that makes Robert Mugabe look timid. Even Joseph Stalin killed only Polish army officers at Katyn. In his column, Prof. Farley went on to compare Confederate apologists to &ldquo;Holocaust revisionists,&rdquo; while at the same time advocating a holocaust of his own.&#8221;</p>

		<p>As someone who is half-black, I readily confess that, taken as a collective whole, Whites are more intelligent than Asians who are correspondingly more intelligent than Blacks.  I will add, and digress for the moment at the same time, that there are those who would argue that Asians are more intelligent than Whites.  However, I would strongly disagree.  In fact, it is not historically true, nor has it ever been the case (who are the inventors, taken collectively?)</p>
<p>That Whites are more intelligent than Blacks should not be a headline, news, a source of controversy, or result in an accusation of racism, per se.  That what is so blatantly obvious is so newsworthy clearly demonstrates just how micromanaged and brainwashed as a society we have become (I am not referring to the generality of Amren readers, of course).</p>
<p>Among many, many things, consider the following simple, undeniable truth.  In the Middle Ages, when the Europeans were fashioning cathedrals, in Dark Africa there wasn&rsquo;t even the concept of a wheel!</p>
