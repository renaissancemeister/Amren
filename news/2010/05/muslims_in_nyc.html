			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ed Barnes, Fox News, May 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As controversy surrounds the construction of a 13-story mosque just two blocks from Ground Zero, FOX News has learned that an effort to place a second mosque close to the hallowed site in New York City is in its advanced stages.</p>
<p>The Masjid Mosque has raised $8.5 million and is seeking an additional $2.5 million to begin construction. {snip}</p>
<p>In fact, the website appealing for donations boldly states that it plans to &#8220;build the &#8216;House of Allah&rsquo; next to the World Trade Center. Help us raise the flag of &#8216;LA ILLAH ILLA ALLAH&rsquo; in downtown Manhattan.&#8221;</p>
<p>One source said he believed the planners are considering a five-story building on 23 Park Place, closer to Ground Zero than the 13-story mosque the Cordoba Initiative is planning to build. But a tax record search shows that 23 Park Place is in private hands and has not changed owners since 2008.</p>
<p>Unlike the massive $100 million Cordoba House mosque, the Masjid Mosque is small  &mdash;  and it is no stranger to the neighborhood. Since 1970 it had been located at 12 Warren Street, about four blocks north of the World Trade Center, in a neat but nondescript industrial space that once housed a printing shop. {snip}</p>
<p>On Friday evenings the mosque, which is popular with street vendors and taxi drivers, becomes so crowded that worshipers spill onto nearby sidewalks to pray in what has come to be a community event.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Masjid mosque leaders claim on their website that they are deeply involved in converting people to Islam and run a special program to convert those who are interested.</p>

		<p>My landlord said that on day on 9/11, his Lebanese tenants cheered and high fived as the towers came down.  Make no mistake, they were not alone.</p>
<p>Building a mosque or &#8216;house of Allah&rsquo; in the West is a gesture of conquest, like planting a flag. It means the earth underneath is under your control. The meaning is as clear as when marines planted the stars and stripes at Iwo Jima.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The most difficult part of Islam and Islamic Law for most Westerners to grasp is that there is no separation of church and state. The religion of Islam and the government is one. Islamic Law is controlled, ruled and regulated by the Islamic religion. The theocracy controls all public and private matters. Government, law and religion are one. In Islam there can be no separation between church and state. The church is the state. The state is the church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Muslim and Arab-American advocates have participated in policy discussions and received briefings from top White House aides and other officials on health care legislation, foreign policy, the economy, immigration and national security. They have met privately with a senior White House adviser, Valerie Jarrett, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to discuss civil liberties concerns and counterterrorism strategy. &lsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Islam has a proud tradition of tolerance.&rdquo;<br>
Barack Hussein Obama</p>
<p>&ldquo;it is important for Western countries to avoid impeding Muslim citizens from practicing religion as they see fit&rdquo;<br>
Barack Hussein Obama</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will convey our deep appreciation for the Islamic faith, which has done so much over so many centuries to shape the world for the better, including my own country.&rdquo;<br>
Barack Hussein Obama</p>
<p>&ldquo;The contribution of Muslims to the United States are too long to catalog because Muslims are so interwoven into the fabric of our communities and our country&rdquo;<br>
Barack Hussein Obama</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have lived in a Muslim-majority country&hellip; I know, because I am one of them.&rdquo;<br>
Barack Hussein Obama</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a student of history, I also know civilization&rsquo;s debt to Islam.&rdquo;<br>
Barack Hussein Obama</p>
<p>&ldquo;Islam has demonstrated through words and deeds the possibilities of religious tolerance and racial equality.&rdquo;<br>
Barack Hussein Obama</p>
<p>&ldquo;And since our founding, American Muslims have enriched the United States.&rdquo;<br>
Barack Hussein Obama</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I consider it part of my responsibility as President of the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam wherever they appear.&rdquo;<br>
Barack Hussein Obama</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moreover, freedom in America is indivisible from the freedom to practice one&rsquo;s religion. That is why there is a mosque in every state of our union, and over 1,200 mosques within our borders. That is why the U.S. government has gone to court to protect the right of women and girls to wear the hijab, and to punish those who would deny it.&rdquo;<br>
Barack Hussein Obama</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not nor have we even been at war with Islam&rdquo;<br>
Barack Hussein Obama</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever we once were, we are no longer a Christian nation&rdquo;<br>
Barack Hussein Obama</p>
<p>&ldquo;We Do Not Consider Ourselves a Christian Nation&rdquo;<br>
Barack Hussein Obama</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will stand with the Muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction.&rdquo;<br>
Barack Hussein Obama</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill Clinton loves Muslimsâ€“or any other force that undermines America. This is the liberal position.&rdquo; </p>
<p><a href="https://www.badeagle.com/2009/11/02/bill-clinton-honored-by-anti-christian-albanian-muslims/" rel="nofollow">https://www.badeagle.com/2009/11/02/bill-clinton-honored-by-anti-christian-albanian-muslims/</a></p>
<p>IMHO, Obama is no more a Muslim than is my cat. Or Bill Clinton. Obama will promote and protect any and all that assist in the ongoing effort to undermine America. It&rsquo;s the old &ldquo;The enemy of my foe is my friend&rdquo; tact.</p>
<p>As long as the Muslims serve that purpose, they will have the likes of Carter, Clinton and Obama to extol their &ldquo;virtues&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Clinton&rsquo;s bombing of the Bosnian Serbs and Serbia was simply another instance of Muslim terrorism, only that time ordered by the Muslim&rsquo;s leftist Western supporters.</p>
<p>The Clinton&rsquo;s actions were a virtual &ldquo;fist bump&rdquo; to Islamists. ATM, Obama and crew are playing a parallel game of branding American veterans and Tea Party protests with the &ldquo;domestic terrorists&rdquo; tag while giving the real supporters of terrorism - the Islamists - cover and &ldquo;most favored&rdquo; status.<br>

		<p>That&rsquo;s just sickening. Whoever gave them a permit should be fired immediately. And besides the fact that their building a freaking MOSQUE so close to a location where the Muslim faith has caused so much pain and hardship, I also have to wonder what beautiful, historical, American building will be torn down to build their filthy &#8220;House of Allah&#8221;. Our people are not the only things Western being replaced in the Western world, our buildings are constantly being replaced as well.</p>

		<p>Well of course, they want a symbol of their greatest victory. What better place then where that victory occurred. And the PC knuckleheads like Bloomberg who run NYC will allow it to happen. And if you notice the muslims don&rsquo;t care one bit about being &#8220;sensitive&#8221; to anyones feelings concerning this situation.</p>

		<p>Our country (or any country for that matter), with such liberal policies, will not survive long in the modern world.  To allow the existance and expansion of an anti-Western, anti-U.S. ideology within our own borders is a precursor to our own destruction. </p>

		<p>I believe that Muhammadism is an alien religion and that it&rsquo;s incompatible with Western history and tradition. This sort of thing should have been curtailed years ago before it got so bad. Multiculturalism is a societal cancer. And it&rsquo;s killing us. </p>

		<p>Just because they symbolically claim dominance doesn&rsquo;t make that dominance a fact.  But the fact that they are open about it will make alot of people aware and resist.</p>

<p><br>
A &#8220;community&#8221; event? Whose community? Not the traditional community in that part of NYC, that&rsquo;s for sure. As even those readers unfamiliar with Manhattan geography are likely to know, this is the Wall Street area we&rsquo;re talking about here. The financial district. The buildings are either offices (containing mostly whites) or expensive high-rise apartments (also containing mostly whites). So what exactly are all these un-wealthy Muslim immigrants who drive cabs and own shawarma carts even DOING there?</p>
<p>Why, building some in-your-face symbols of Allah&rsquo;s conquest of the Infidels, of course. This is Muslim muscle-flexing at its most ostentatious. A vulgar display of power. </p>

<p>People with a sense of decorum would have more decency than to build a mosque by the sight of the 9/11 attacks.  </p>

		<p>This is surely adding insult to injury.<br>
Make no mistake that those 3000+ people who died, did so in the name of militant Allah. <br>
Now his temple resides on top of their final resting place.</p>
<p>Reading the crazy stories that Amren posts, often makes me wonder &ldquo;where have all the good people gone&rdquo;? <br>
Or at least wonder &ldquo;how did the subservient, the weak and the traitors get so much power in this world that our fathers built&rdquo;? </p>
<p>The Wikipedia page on &rdquo;Causes of self-destructive behaviour&rdquo; says&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Self-destructive behaviour is often a form <br>
of<i> self-punishment in response to a personal failure, <b>which may be</b> real or <b>perceived</b></i>. It may or may not be <i>connected with feelings of self-hatred</i></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As might be expected, it is <i>more common in those afflicted with clinical depression.</i><br>
Alternatively, in some cases it could be explained by a <i>person having learned dysfunctional patterns earlier in life</i>, or it may simply be the result of<i> lack of applied wisdom or misplaced priorities</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-destructive_behaviour" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-destructive_behaviour</a></p>
<p>So the West must be mentally ill or at least is being partially run by the mentally ill.</p>

		<p>Muslims just love to twist a knife in the wounds of their enemies. The fact that they can do so completely unhampered will further embolden them to actively proceed with their conquest of the infidels` lands by mass-migrating to the Western World and once there, have their ever-pregnant, veil-clad females churn out whole battalions of future holy warriors.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have 50 million Muslims in Europe. There are signs that Allah will grant Islam victory in Europe &mdash; without swords, without guns, without conquest &mdash; will turn it into a Muslim continent within a few decades.&#8221; (Muammar al-Gaddafi)</p>
<p>&#8220;The mosques are our barracks, the domes are our helmets, the minarets are our swords, and the faithful are our army&#8221; (Erdogan, Turkish Prime minister, NATO Ally)</p>
<p>Symbolism plays an important role in Islam and the fact that the Twin Towers were razed by Muslims and a 13-story mosque will be built in the immediate vicinity sends out a strong message to the Islamic community in the US - &#8220;the inception of the American Caliphate draws nigh&#8221;<br>
Muslims are currently content with poking thorns into the American heart, just don`t wait for them to impale it on a spike.</p>
