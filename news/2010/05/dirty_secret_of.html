			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>C.W. Nevius, San Francisco Chronicle, May 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>San Francisco&rsquo;s hidden truth is out. That&rsquo;s what community organizer Carol Mo calls the realization that Asian residents are being targeted for robberies, burglaries and intimidation by young black men.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is San Francisco&rsquo;s dirty little secret,&#8221; said Mo, a former Safety Network Community organizer in the Sunset District. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not news to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} [The] San Francisco Police Department {snip} seems intent on downplaying the role of race and its impact in the community.</p>
<p>The recent incidents of black violence against Asians is the perfect opportunity to open a dialogue about racism. Instead, they are attempting to close the door.</p>
<p>City officials, including the Police Department, say these assaults are part of a larger crime picture where gangs of kids take advantage of a vulnerable group of small stature. But Mo participated in a 2008 survey by the Police Department in which about 300 strong-arm robberies were analyzed. &#8220;In 85 percent of the physical assault crimes, the victims were Asian and the perpetrators were African American,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} There&rsquo;s a deep divide between the two communities. Edward Chang, who lectures on civil unrest and race relations at UC Riverside, has studied the contentious history of Korean-African American relations in Los Angeles when Korean store owners moved into black neighborhoods.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was this sense of being invaded by someone else,&#8221; Chang said. &#8220;There was a sense of needing to protect and defend their turf.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} Lee Mun Wah, a Berkeley-based documentary filmmaker and diversity trainer for large corporations, said there is resentment over how Asians are seen as &#8220;the favored minority.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are pitted against each other,&#8221; Wah said. &#8220;African Americans sometimes say, &#8216;We did all the work in civil rights, and they get all the benefits.&rsquo; &#8220;</p>

		<p>I have dated an Asian man, for quite a while and he is a Christian gentleman.</p>
<p>He believes that affirmative action is not, and never has been necessary for Asians. If an Asian person is discriminated against, they see it more as opportunity and less as &#8220;hate.&#8221;</p>
<p>He believes that the &#8220;people of mind&#8221; (the Europeans and the Asians) will eventually form an alliance against the &#8220;people of matter&#8221; (the Africans and other darker races).</p>
<p>He is a martial arts master, so let them try him!</p>

<p></p>
<p>Yes&hellip;.because that would lead to the conclusion that racism is something ONLY blacks and some hispanics engage in.  And that the only appropriate response would be to separate them from the rest of the population.</p>
<p>Almost all crime could be eliminated by forced seggregation.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The recent incidents of black violence against Asians is the perfect opportunity to open a dialogue about racism. Instead, they are attempting to close the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Actually, what it is &ldquo;the perfect opportunity&rdquo; for, is discussing how multiculturalism has failed and how to get rid of it. &ldquo;Racism&rdquo; might play a role here; however, it is not the &ldquo;racism&rdquo; of whites that can be held up as being responsible. Twist it, turn it, and put it in a centrifuge full of Technicolor platitudes, but it still won&rsquo;t be the white washout you want, Comrades.</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with &ldquo;whitey&rdquo; or his &ldquo;racism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is a hard fact of life, that blacks do basely and violently resent any group with achievements greater than their own, simply because they have been told that they are really their &ldquo;cosmic achievements&rdquo; and these were stolen from them over 200, or even 500 years. In short, a false sense of not &ldquo;equality&rdquo; with other humans, but &ldquo;superiority&rdquo; over them, via a fantasized Marxist voodoo called &ldquo;civil rights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In short, they hate East Asians for the same reason they hate White Europeans, they wish they were them. Since they cannot be them, they seek to destroy them through the childishly manipulative &ldquo;guilt&rdquo; terrorisms, that enforced multiculturalism allows them to exploit. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>The Civil Rights angle to this story is a fraud. Black thugs prey on people who a) are least likely to fight back and b) most likely to carry a wad of cash. Hm, who does that sound like? One Chinese neighbor told us she always hid $10K in her house for emergencies   &mdash;   ransom in case of a kidnapping? I didn&rsquo;t ask. But if I&rsquo;m a house breaker, of course the first thing I&rsquo;d look for are shoes on the front porch.</p>
<p>Koreans and Chinese are a the cash &amp; carry minority. Blacks mug em&rsquo; on the street. Illegal Hispanics work for em&rsquo; under the table.</p>

		<p>Case in point in April In Oakland.</p>
<p>Two young black men charged with murder in Oakland in a 59-year-old Asian&#8221;s beating death.  Police say a father and son were the victims of a vicious attack in Oakland on Friday, a police spokeswoman said. <br>
Officers were summoned to the 1800 block of Telegraph Avenue about 3 p.m. and found 59-year-old Tiansheng Yu, of San Francisco, unresponsive, police Officer Holly Joshi said. <br>
Joshi said the father and son were shopping in the area when two young men assaulted them in what appears to be a random attack. </p>
<p>There are also two examples of blacks brutalizing, raping and murdering numerous white people in the Wichita and Knoxville.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just Asian victims but the killers are usually black!</p>

<i>&#8220;We are pitted against each other,&rdquo; Wah said. &ldquo;African Americans sometimes say, &lsquo;We did all the work in civil rights, and they get all the benefits.&rsquo;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes blacks made was stressing diversity and multiculturalism. The so-called &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; movement was supposed to elevate the descendents of slaves. However, blacks thought they would take down the white man faster by forming coalitions so they used the terms diversity and multiculturalism to widen their net. </p>
<p>It backfired. Now, all the jobs, money, and perks that should have gone to blacks are now being dished out to anyone who says they&rsquo;re bringing diverstiy. </p>
<p>Blacks have ensured that they will remain on the bottom of the pecking order.</p>

		<p>Wow, I read the original article and a lot of the comments and I must say it is strangely satisfying to see Asians complaining that the white power structure is too soft on blacks and too PC to call a spade a spade.</p>
<p>The Asian commentors were saying things that whites only say privately, among them was that the people (Asians and Blacks) don&rsquo;t mix because it&rsquo;s natural for people to prefer others of their own kind.  Hmmph.  This is a topic that greatly interests me: minorities claiming priviledges from the &#8216;white power structure&rsquo; and then realizing it is too PC to protect them from other minorities.</p>

		<p>Odd, how the issue of black-on-<i>White</i> violence isn&rsquo;t mentioned at all.  I wonder why.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&ldquo;African Americans sometimes say, &lsquo;We did all the work in civil rights, and they get all the benefits.&rsquo;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>They can <i>say</i> it all they like.  The <i>truth</i> is, White liberals did all the work in &#8220;civil rights,&#8221; providing leadership, money, sympathetic media coverage and a veneer of anguished moral respectability.  Meanwhile, Orientals were quietly working hard and improving themselves, without a shred of self-pity or resentful entitlement fantasies.  Orientals didn&rsquo;t <i>need</i> &#8220;civil rights.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Another thing is that here we are after some five or six decades of civil rights legislation and programs, yet apparently we still have racial conflict, and racial conflict which is escalating. All this ought to make Americans consider how liberalism has proven to be a failure, but the issue does not get raised. </p>
<p><i>Lee Mun Wah, a Berkeley-based documentary filmmaker and diversity trainer for large corporations, said there is resentment over how Asians are seen as &ldquo;the favored minority.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Perhaps this fellow ought to be giving diversity training to the people who are assaulting Asians. He can go into the &#8216;hood and give gang bangers his power point show, informing them that there are no differences between the races, and black attacks on Asians constitute hate crimes. I am sure that being oppressed minorities, they would cheerfully accept such a show.</p>
<p><i>White liberals did all the work in &ldquo;civil rights,&rdquo; providing leadership, money, sympathetic media coverage and a veneer of anguished moral respectability.</i></p>
<p>Good point. And let us not forget the federal government backing them up with troops and marshals. </p>
<p>Of course, one can argue that blacks were mere catspaws, and the agenda of white liberals was to use civil rights as a front for expanding the power of the federal government, and creating entrenched bureaucracies which vex the American people with endless dictates and propaganda.</p>

		<p>To poster #15.  In principle, I might agree, but the sad reality is that blacks are pushing ever harder into white areas after they&rsquo;ve been pushed out by latinos.  The only group that will have anything to do with blacks is - whites!  </p>
<p>Only white owned businesses will give blacks jobs.  Asians do not give blacks jobs.  Latinos do not give blacks jobs.  Neither group socializes with blacks or treats them with respect.  I wonder why neither group has ever been brought to the woodshed about this by white/jewish uber liberals!</p>

		<p>It is not that Asians take over black ghetto hoods, or even some race hatred by blacks on Asians that seem to get along without government aid. It is the fact that San Francisco`s gun grabbing gay politicians make them sitting ducks.I know that San Francisco is supposed to be tolerance and love town USA; however in reality except for the Castro, Fisherman`s Wharf and Nob Hill it has all the charm of Camden or Compton. If you are a victim of black thugs it is your own fault. Expecting folks with IQs under 80 to even think abstract thoughts about racism or vicitmization is nonsense. They work on raw impulse.  Koreans in LA know the score.  They refer to African Americans as black devils. They go nowhere alone and unarmed.They are willing to kill to keep what they own. Soon you will see the Triads taking horrible vengeance if tourism in China Town starts going south.Once you leave Frisco and it`s gun grabbing cops, Asians get along with blacks a little better. In Oakland blacks have learned that Mac Ten is not served with egg roll and that the 380s on the street came in from a factory near Shang Hai.</p>

<p>Where in HEll are we getting this idea that Jews aren&rsquo;t white? Although it is possible for non-Whites to convert to Judaism, it&rsquo;s an exception. Ashkenazim are just as White as the rest of us and the Sephardim although more olive complected are still White. <br>
The word &#8220;Jew&#8221; refers to an ethnicity  as  well as to a religion. Yes it&rsquo;s true that many of them are agonizingly liberal and were in the forefront of the Civil Rights movement but many of them are suffering &#8220;buyers regret&#8221; now that they&rsquo;ve realized the non-existent return on their investment. Anti-semitism is rampant in Black America and it&rsquo;s a testimony to the adage that no good deed goes unpunished.<br>
I know many Jews who are unter liberals.  They&rsquo;re just as pissed off about what&rsquo;s happening in this country as the rest of us.</p>

<p>OF COURSE blacks would view Asians as &#8220;Lucky&#8221; when it comes to civil rights.  Blacks did all the &#8220;Work&#8221; and Asians get all the benefits.  Typical black reasoning.  And ironic; sort of a role reversal of the entitlement coin from a policy standpoint.</p>
<p>Blacks have no redeeming qualities.  And the more power that Hispanics and Asians garner politically in this country, the angrier and angrier blacks will get in their self-inflicted frustration.</p>

		<p>So the blacks resent Asians for opening businesses and stores in their hood?  WHO THE HELL ELSE WOULD DARE DO SO?????  Everybody else has FLED the hood, fled the constant robberies, fled the gangs, fled the violence, fled the rampant shoplifting that goes on in black neighborhoods.  The Asians are providing them a SERVICE that nobody else is willing to do - local groceries, markets, laundry, and all other kinds of small businesses.  And what is the black response to once again having these things locally?  To KILL and ROB those who brought such services back among them.  Typical Black Behavior and typical Black reasoning.  But they wonder why their neighborhoods are devoid of real grocery stores, quick markets, small businesses?  They (the blacks) really ARE retards.</p>

		<p>I live in San Francisco and I&rsquo;ve noticed that most of the burglaries in my majority-Chinese neighborhood target Chinese homes. They are known for keeping large amounts of cash in their homes, and it&rsquo;s not just a distrust of banks. </p>
<p>The Chinese contractors here in SF ask to be paid in cash. Why? They don&rsquo;t plan on paying taxes on their income. They have no problem consuming the services paid for by taxes: schools, roads, police, firefighters, etc. </p>
<p>The Chinese culture is not community-minded; it&rsquo;s all for themselves or their families, nothing to make the neighborhood or town a decent place to live. Hence, all the weeds and trash in their front yards; that&rsquo;s for the public, who cares about them!</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have negative feelings about the Chinese until I had been living among them for awhile and seeing their culture up close. They really are different and don&rsquo;t share a lot of our values. They dominate the neighborhoods surrounding Golden Gate Park, but almost everyone using the park is white. They lack an appreciation of Nature and natural beauty. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Will we now witness &lsquo;Asian flight&rsquo; from big cities?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rather the opposite. Blacks are being displaced by asians in several big cities.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Neither group socializes with blacks or treats them with respect.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is not exactly true about Latinos. Caribbean Latinos, for one, socialize plenty with blacks and have high rates of intermarriage with them. Even Mexicans and other mestizos socialize with blacks to some degree. Certainly many of them are hardcore imitators of black &#8220;culture&#8221;  &mdash;  far more so than whites.<br>

		<p>&#8220;We did all the work in civil rights, and they get all the benefits.&#8221;</p>
<p>Really?  While black loudmouths were demanding tax-funded government handouts, Asians were working for a living.  While blacks were using drugs and having huge litters of children out of wedlock, Asians remained sober, got married and raised families.  While blacks embraced a culture of criminality, Asians remained generally law-abiding.  The quote above suggests that blacks now want to take credit for the stable, middle-class livestyle most Asians have attained, when in reality their prosperity is the result of Asians&rsquo; own behavior.  This is further proof - though absolutely none is necessary - that blacks simply don&rsquo;t &#8220;get it&#8221; and never will.</p>

		<p>Most of those commenting on this blog are ignorant or choose to ignore the real problem. Asians discriminate against Blacks. They bring their businesses into the community, but refuse to hire Blacks. The practice unfair and unethical business practices when operating beauty supply stores, and wonder why they are not respected.  They see problems in the community, but never participate in finding solutions, unless they see an Asian being victimized.  Community means everyone, not just those that look like you.  </p>
<p>When Asians start acting like they care about the community, not just Asians, then things will improve. Stop taking, taking, and taking.  Thank God for Malcolm X, Dr. King, Fanne Lou Hammer, Medger Evers, etc.  If not for these brave people, Asian would not have the opportunities they have in America.<br>

		<p> Haven&rsquo;t older, smaller whites been targeted by young black men as well? Is this a &#8220;dirty little secret&#8221;?  Have only East Asians been attacked in San Francisco? How about Indian Hindus? If the hated white racist oppressors were to vanish overnight, Asians would still have a problem with black crime.</p>

		<p>I am not the first to notice this, but it bears repeating: blacks see success and achievement as a zero-sum game, regardless of where they are (America, Europe, Africa, etc.).  There is NO comprehension about how wealth or ideas or culture or civilizations are created, developed or maintained.  If someone else has these things, it&rsquo;s because they STOLE them. Pathetic.  They will never be convinced that their lack is due to their own failings, laziness and incompetence.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Blacks are instinctive predators.<br>
When they see weakness (Orientals generally have a slender physique and are no match for blacks in a straight-forward physical attack), blacks rise to the bait, see the opportunity and attack.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Lee Mun Wah, a Berkeley-based documentary filmmaker and diversity trainer for large corporations, said there is resentment over how Asians are seen as &ldquo;the favored minority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps this fellow ought to be giving diversity training to the people who are assaulting Asians. He can go into the &lsquo;hood and give gang bangers his power point show, informing them that there are no differences between the races, and black attacks on Asians constitute hate crimes. I am sure that being oppressed minorities, they would cheerfully accept such a show.</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Lee Mun Wah is part of the problem. Anyone who has ever been forced to attend a &#8220;Color of Fear&#8221; diversity class, put on by a couple of his Kentucky Fried Seminar employees, knows what I mean.</p>
<p>He places himself on higher moral grounds by claiming (in the film, Color of Fear) that his father, who owned a restaurant, was killed by a black. Of course, he has moved beyond that and preaches that understanding and accepting each other is important. After all, if he can do it, why can you?</p>
<p>He sees whites as the problem, so him being quoted here is ironic. Notice how he doesn&rsquo;t condemn the black violence? In a passive voice, he quotes the &#8220;one is being played off against the other&#8221; line, as if there&rsquo;s a third party playing off the one against the other. Guess who that third party might be?</p>
<p>Look at his facebook. You&rsquo;ll see prominently displayed the names of Barack and Michelle Obama as friends.</p>
<p>If most Asians believe as he apparently does, they are in as bad shape as whites.</p>

		<p>Asians are a complete foil to blacks.  As a general rule, Orientals (but not Pacific Islanders) are hardworking, patient, calm, and intelligent. </p>
<p>Blacks who engage in anti-Asian acts are only making further fools of themselves.  Their base behavior will only be more evident when directed at those who display opposite traits. </p>

		<p>The &#8220;unfair&#8221; and &#8220;unethical&#8221; business practices remarked on have a simple explanation: These small, family-run businesses are rarely in a position to hire employees outside the family, whether they are located in black neighborhoods or not.  A Korean liquor store near me is typical of this; the mother and one son (the other two sons are in the US armed forces) run the store during the day, and the father runs it during the evenings.  To an ignorant outsider like 32-Anonymous, it looks like this business hires only Koreans, but the real story is that only family members work there.  A family that sinks all of its savings starting up a small business does so to earn a living, and not to &#8220;contribute to the community&#8221; or (insert other leftspeak twaddle here).</p>
