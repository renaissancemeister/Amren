			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sudeep Reddy, Wall Street Journal, May 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The recession is showing that even a college degree isn&rsquo;t enough to close the stubborn employment gap between white and black Americans.</p>
<p>In April, the nationwide jobless rate for white college graduates, ages 25 and older, stood at 4%, according to the Labor Department. The rate for college graduates in the same age bracket who identify themselves as black or African-American was 7.4%.</p>
<p>And that gap  &mdash;  3.4 percentage points  &mdash;  has widened since the recession started in December 2007, when the comparable figure was 0.9 percentage point.</p>
<p>To be sure, the deep recession has shown more clearly than ever the value of education for all races and age groups. Joblessness for Americans without high-school diplomas was roughly triple the rate for those with college degrees and topped 15% in many months. That difference holds among African-Americans; those without high-school diplomas have seen unemployment top 20% during the downturn.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The problem goes beyond simply having a job: A wage gap between black and white college graduates, after diminishing to almost zero by the late 1970s, picked up in the 1980s and remains today.</p>
<p>Drawing broad conclusions is difficult, but one possible explanation is that racial discrimination remains a force in the job market, even if more subtle than before. Economists and other experts who have studied the divide also point to a long list of other potential causes.</p>
<p>Black college graduates on average are younger, with less experience, than white graduates. {snip}</p>
<p>Also, on average, white Americans tend to have a higher share of college majors built around science and technology  &mdash;  fields more resistant to layoffs. {snip}</p>

<p>Uh, sure.  We can&rsquo;t find any &#8220;discrimination,&#8221; so that must mean it&rsquo;s gone underground and become even more invisible and undetectable.</p>
<p>You can bet your last copy of the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> that Phantom Discrimination is the only &#8220;explanation&#8221; that&rsquo;ll be permitted.<br>

<p>Ah Comrade Reddy, did we not just answer our own question here?</p>
<p>What marketable skills are of value, now that the economic downturn has forced companies and even governmental departments, to streamline their &ldquo;business&rdquo; practices. Can a BA in &ldquo;Afrocentric studies&rdquo; affordably compete with a BS in engineering? How about a PhD in &ldquo;Ebonic-Egyptomology sciences&rdquo; going against a PhD in Chemistry?</p>
<p>In other words, a fat and stupid society on the take, can afford such nonsense as &ldquo;viable&rdquo; and &ldquo;treasured;&rdquo; a lean and mean society, on the make or break, must cast away delusions for lucidity and survival.</p>
<p>God help us all and end of story!</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s actually a 3.4 percentage point difference, not 3.4%. The real percentage difference between blacks and whites here is 85% (3.4/4.0).</p>

		<p>In my recent years of experience reading resumes, I find that most &#8220;college graduates&#8221; read and write at around the 7th grade lever, lower for blacks, and grammar in all cases is truly abysmal. Without a calculator, few can do any but the very lowest form of math, addition, and then subtraction totally blows their curve! Sad indeed.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Unemployment rate for black college graduates 3.4% higher than for whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gee, I wonder if that could be because blacks can barely read the uncontested degrees given to them, while whites have to work for theirs and must know the subject matter thoroughly before they&rsquo;re certified.</p>
<p>I just talked to a black pharmacist who couldn&rsquo;t understand what a brand name was for a generic prescription.  He couldn&rsquo;t grasp that generics have brand names just like the originals and kept thinking the brand name and the generic name were the same. </p>
<p>Need I relate other incompetence by these pitifully unqualified people in other fields?  I could write ten thousand words citing examples.<br>

		<p>3.4% is not a very high percentage.  Let&rsquo;s face it, whites can generally present themselves in an interview better than blacks, because they&rsquo;re usually more comfortable in the business environment, which is still largely run by whites.  Also, you can&rsquo;t fight with what you don&rsquo;t have - i.e. the high intelligence the job providers are looking for.  Whites have an advantage there in most cases, but certainly not in all.  Really, I am surprised that blacks are doing as well as they are in this category.</p>

<p>What the hell does that mean? Are they younger because they have excelled beyond the White students and graduated early? Or are most black graduates products of a two-year liberal arts education?  </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;That difference holds among African-Americans; those without high-school diplomas have seen unemployment top 20% during the downturn&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>It couldn&rsquo;t be because of unfettered immigration, from uneducated, Third World hispanics willing to work for slave wages, could it?  </p>
<p>It couldn&rsquo;t be because any given American employer would rather hire an illegal hispanic than an American black with a chip on his shoulder, with deep grievances against Whites, and who, if hired, will be impossible to get rid of for fear of a racial discrimination case that could bankrupt the employer&rsquo;s business?</p>
<p>No, of course not!  It MUST be due to &#8220;racial discrimination&hellip; a force in the job market, even if more subtle than before.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Racial Discrimination!&#8221; is what black politicians scream as they continue to support open borders and unlimited Third World hispanic colonization  &mdash;  colonization that is ethnically cleansing black areas of blacks and shutting them out of jobs.</p>
<p>And, finally:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Also, on average, White Americans tend to have a higher share of college majors built around science and technology &mdash; fields more resistant to layoffs&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Science and technology degrees require IQs far above 85  &mdash;   by at least three standard deviations.  That fact alone eliminates the vast majority of blacks.</p>
<p>In the working world, there&rsquo;s infinitely less trouble with White employees than blacks because Whites are easier to lay off or fire if necessary and there&rsquo;s far less chance of being sued into bankruptcy for racial discrimination. </p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had plenty of employers on this board who&rsquo;ve stated that they&rsquo;d NEVER hire a non-White with an ethnic-grievance degree  &mdash;  black studies, chicano studies, social justice studies.  I&rsquo;ve encountered plenty of these types in the schools and they are deeply hostile to Whites, annoying and marxist to the core. </p>
<p>An employer would be looking at a racial discrimination lawsuit within a month.</p>

Here some interesting points, corrected for the truth, so to speak:</p>
<p>Original:<br>
&#8220;Also, on average, white Americans tend to have a higher share of college majors built around science and technology &mdash;  fields more resistant to layoffs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrected:<br>
&#8220;White Americans have higher IQs so they are able to major in needed fields built around science and technology rather than major in useless fields prone to layoffs like black studies.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Original:<br>
&#8220;There&rsquo;s no single story or no single reason,&#8221; said William Rodgers, a Rutgers University professor and former Labor Department chief economist. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a combination of labor supply, labor demand and institutional norms that unfortunately still today disadvantages many African-Americans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrected:<br>
&#8220;We&rsquo;re making up excuses as fast as we can,&#8221; said William Rodgers, a Rutgers University professor and former apologist. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a combination of fancy phrases like labor supply, labor demand and institutional norms that can provide vague cover for the outright incompetence of blacks as well as the frustration felt by companies of having to hire through affirmative action, especially in a recession. And let&rsquo;s not forget the disadvantages of African-Americans. What are they? Well, basically low intelligence and being lousy workers prone to litigation but I can&rsquo;t say that so make up whatever you want.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Aren&rsquo;t they always claiming that the unemployment rate of black male youth is around 50% white that of whites is around 10%. That&rsquo;s quite a bit of difference. As we know, any difference must be do to discrimination. A difference of only 3.4%, among college grads, must mean employers are 36% more likely to discriminate in Favor of african american college grads.</p>
