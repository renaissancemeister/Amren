<h1><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-study-results-2010-4">Why Is Twitter More Popular With Black People Than White People?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nick Saint, Business Insider, April 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>New data confirms that Twitter&rsquo;s population is disproportionately black.</p>
<p>According to Edison Research&rsquo;s annual report on Twitter, black people represent 25% of Twitter users, roughly twice their share of the population in general.</p>
<p>Why is this? A few ideas:</p>
<p>* Black people (and Hispanics) are much more likely to access the Internet from mobile devices. Twitter is well-suited to mobile use, and its users are more engaged with the mobile Internet than the general population by a wide margin.</p>
<p>* More black than white celebrities are active Twitter users; Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal, Oprah, 50 Cent, and P Diddy are all among the most followed accounts on Twitter. That&rsquo;s great publicity for Twitter, and could be helping Twitter become more mainstream among black people.</p>
<p>* The median age for black Americans (according to the 2000 census) is 30 years old, a full seven years younger than for white Americans. Black people therefore make up a relatively higher percentage of the population within the most relevant age groups  &mdash;  Twitter is most popular amongst 25-34 year-olds.</p>
<p>Those are the best explanations we can come up with. {snip}<br>

		<p>why is twitter more popular among blacks? for the same reason shows like maury povich and all the &#8220;court TV&#8221; shows are populated by black folk, and why blacks post so many YouTube videos, blacks love to see/hear themselves talk. It is a good example of the &#8216;grandiose sense of self&#8221; trait prevalent among blacks, part of their sociopath personality </p>

		<p>The thing most odd and ironic to me is that the most advanced communications technology in human history is used disproportionately by people completely ignorant of  &mdash;  and probably incapable of understanding  &mdash;  anything about how that technology works.</p>

		<p>Doesnt Twitter have a length limit on their messages? Something like 14 words or less? Thats about the limit of their attention span. Anything more and their eyes get glassy and they start to get mad.</p>

		<p>Its of course maturity and since black have typically a lower standard for almost erverything in life, such like  for being just a vicious jungle of a form of communication like Twitter is perfect for them.</p>

		<p><i>Black people (and Hispanics) are much more likely to access the Internet from mobile devices.</i></p>
<p>But this fact in itself raises a whole host of <i>other</i> questions. Why are blacks less likely to access the Internet from computers than from cell phones? The reasons, as usual, come down to genetic differences.</p>
<p>Blacks are more extroverted, on average, than whites, who are in turn more extroverted than Asians. (Witness the black propensity to chatter among themselves even at the movies.) So naturally, cell phones and social networking sites appeal to blacks.</p>
<p>On the other hand, blacks have a lower average IQ and a narrower range of interests than whites, so computers in general are of less interest to them than to whites. When blacks do use computers, their primary use is, once again, for social networking. How many black computer hackers or programmers do you know of?</p>
<p>At the same time, the proliferation of cell phones among blacks exposes the lie that  blacks are denied access to technology due to &#8220;poverty.&#8221; A monthly cell phone charge and high texting fees really add up!</p>
<p>The bottom line is, blacks are absent from the high-tech professions because of their own limitations and lack of interest, not due to being excluded by dastardly whites, contrary to the lie that is constantly promoted by liberals.</p>

		<p>They love playing with their cell phones.  Virtually every time you see them they&rsquo;re on the cell phone, especially the Hispanic females.  They&rsquo;re like children with toys.  </p>

		<p>This raises the question of why so many blacks are always on the phone. Even on the city bus they are constantly talking and texting each other about the most mind numbing drivel. </p>
<p>One would think that people without a car might find better uses than to waste $600 a year on a cell phone plan ($6000 in 10 years or $24,000 for a family of 4). Any surprise how they&rsquo;re always broke? Even the worst dump in Detroit has a satellite dish!</p>

		<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s an age thing(though I&rsquo;m only in my early forties), but to the best of my knowledge I don&rsquo;t know a single white person who even bothers with that Twitter nonsense. I thought it was all just some goofy celeb/pop culture foolishness that appealed only to teenagers and bored celeb-adoring housewives. Apparently blacks love it too! Simple thoughts for simple people? </p>

		<p>Here is theory number one:<br>
&#8220;Blacks are more criminal because they are poor and have nothing to eat for their family&#8221;.</p>
<p>Here is theory number two:<br>
&#8220;Blacks are more likely to have mobile phones which are able to connect the Internet (what means they cost a lot of money) so twitter is more popular to them&#8221;.</p>
<p>Where is the mistake?<br>
Jared Taylor once said: &#8220;It&rsquo;s really a ridiculous idea that people in western countries has to shoot somebody to feed the family. They do it for other motives.&#8221; He is right, indeed.</p>

<p>I use it.  Though mostly to retweet my blog posts.</p>
<p>Twitter is what you make of it.  If you want to read and post mindless drivel, you&rsquo;ll be reading and read by those who are interested in mindless drivel.  Same goes for hard info.</p>
<p>Actually, the political right has made better use of Twitter than the left, in its first few years of popularity.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s the more fundamental question we should be asking:</p>
<p>Is it a good idea to have all these young black running around with mobile devices that are Twitter-capable?  Remember, the last two extremist hate mobs, one in Philadelphia and the other in Kansas City, were so organized.</p>

<p>I agree. Too bad there isn&rsquo;t a mass mobile phone jamming device which could be activated when the usual mob suspects start to gather in the mall. Something that would allow for emergency services to communicate with each other but deactivate the text and voice communication between the &#8220;youffs&#8221; within a 5 mile radius of the potential hot spot.  </p>
