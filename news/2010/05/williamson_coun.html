<h1>Williamson County to Stop Footing Health Care Bills of ID-Less Indigent People</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Claire Osborn, Statesman, May 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Williamson County commissioners have decided to stop paying health care costs for indigent adults and children who don&rsquo;t have valid Social Security cards.</p>
<p>County Judge Dan A. Gattis said last week that he wanted to ensure that there was enough money for the residents of Williamson County who qualified for indigent care to remain covered. In the first five months of the current fiscal year, 265 people who didn&rsquo;t have Social Security cards received county-paid health care out of a total of 1,153 indigent patients, said Bride Roberts, the coordinator for Williamson County&rsquo;s indigent health care system.</p>
<p>The decision  &mdash;  which came in a unanimous vote on April 27  &mdash;  was not based on race, Gattis said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are running out of money,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The county is required by the state to pay up to 8 percent of its general tax revenue annually for indigent health care, which is $7.1 million this fiscal year, Roberts said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The county&rsquo;s indigent health care expenses have risen from $1 million in fiscal year 2000 to $5.4 million in fiscal year 2009, according to county records. The expense is projected to reach $9.4 million in the current fiscal year, Roberts said, which would equal 10.5 percent of the general tax revenue budget.</p>
<p>Roberts said there were several reasons for the increased expense, including a large number of &#8220;very sick&#8221; people and new hospitals in the area identifying more people who may qualify for the program.</p>
<p>Williamson County residents without legal Social Security cards can still get care at four clinics in Georgetown, 10 clinics in Round Rock and one in Granger, all operated by Lone Star Circle of Care, a nonprofit community health organization, said Rebekah Haynes, the group&rsquo;s communications director.</p>
<p>Roberts said patients without valid Social Security cards accounted for 12 percent of the $3.7 million spent under the program in the first five months of the fiscal year. During fiscal year 2009, 1,505 people were covered, and 331 of those didn&rsquo;t have valid Social Security cards, she said.</p>
<p>The county estimated that it can save $1 million a year by denying coverage to people without legal Social Security cards, Roberts said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Virtually all counties do include undocumented residents in their county indigent health care programs,&#8221; said Dunkelberg [Anne Dunkelberg, the associate director of the Center for Public Policy Priorities in Austin], who called the county&rsquo;s decision &#8220;a bad idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Making sure you are providing good access to prenatal care is extremely important because all babies are U.S. citizens,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The county&rsquo;s indigent health care program covers up to $30,000 per year in costs for doctors, hospitals, clinics, lab work, prescriptions and diagnostic testing for people with incomes equal to 21 percent or less of the federal poverty level, which works out to a monthly income of $190 or less for a single person, Roberts said.</p>

		<p>Since hospitals are not allowed to refuse service to the illegal invaders the hospitals must either pass the costs onto people who do pay or more likely just go out of business.</p>

		<p>I suspect this will be the dominant attitude all over the US.  It&rsquo;s not about race.  Yet every action taken is about race.</p>
<p>Just like in Arizona.  The law forbids &#8220;racial profiling&#8221;, meanwhile, the law is just a facade for a behavior already in widespread use&hellip;.mexicans routinely stopped because of their race.</p>
<p>This is how to get around white guilt about race&hellip;.denial.  Whites want the successful address of our community problems that comes with racism but don&rsquo;t want to be racist.  Solution, deny it&rsquo;s about race&hellip;.no matter how overtly racist it is.</p>
<p>In the end, there will be vigilantes actively hunting down non-whites, shooting them if they step foot in our communities (like what happened during Katrina) and still, it will &#8220;not be about race&#8221;.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>

<p>Whites in official positions of authority acting as though they are sane and as though human rights are not open ended entitlements to every cent possessed by White Taxpayers? </p>

Something is wrong here. Watch the other hand. Or just watch for the blue helmets of the U.N. march on the town and arrest the council for a hate crime against human dignity.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Bout time somebody stopped paying our tax dollars for those who are here illegally!!!  My state, CA, has been bankrupted by the fiscal demands of the illegals; they have destroyed our education, healthcare, and welfare systems by simply overwhelming them in terms of numbers.  We cannot AFFORD illegals.  We want them gone.</p>

<p>If one looks at the Williamson County demographics and income levels, the picture emerges of a county (by Southwest standards) with a fairly low percentage of illegal alien population. (17% Hispanic-Latino population and one would expect a high percentage of this segment to be solid citizens with long established colonial era regional roots)  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not seeing a picture of a County under illegal alien invader siege when viewed in its historical and regional context. I&rsquo;m seeing a county of elitist suburbanites with gobierno yobs in Austin who are screaming NIMBY. Chicago, New York, LA, DC/MD?N.VA and podunk towns in NC and SC have situations with illegal aliens than far surpass those of WILCO.</p>

<p>How about enforcing our employment and require proper IDs for any welfare? Without any way to make money, the illegal, ooops undocumented, will go home. </p>

<p>Actually, no the 14th meant the children of freed slaves were citizens, time to make this clear in the law, so these Mexicans can take their MEXICAN kids home.</p>

		<p>Good going, Dan Gattis! I was beginning to think Williamson Country was a pro-illegal stronghold.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Dunkleberg thinks this is a &#8220;bad idea?&#8221; Does that mean she approves of illegal immigration? Anchor babies? Crime committed by illegals? The drain on our natural resources? Our social services? Neighborhood deterioration? Sure glad you&rsquo;re in Austin, Mrs. D. Now THERE&rsquo;S a pro-illegal city, a real sanctuary for illegals. So, just go right ahead and take care of them and happy third world to you.</p>

<p>And therein lies the problem. Isn&rsquo;t it stupid that a child of illegal immigranst is considered a citizen? Personally, I think that we should deport not just all illegal immigrants, but also anyone who became a citizen simply becaus ethey were born here.</p>
<p>Also, back on topic, there&rsquo;s nothing more stupid than forcing the taxpayers to pay for the healthcare of illegal immigrants. What has our once-great nation come to?</p>

		<p>Miz Annie Dunkleberg is obviously not familiar with the Mexican Constitution (Article 30) which states that any child born outside of MEXICO with at least one Mex parent is a citizen of Mexico. Every anchor baby born in the USA, where one or both parents are Mex, is by the Mexican Constitution a citizen of Mexico.</p>
<p>That the US gives them an additional present, for using our FREE healthcare services, of US citizenship is simply insane and guarantees we will be overrun with them every month of every year.<br>

<p>I live in Travis county(which houses sanctuary city Austin) and its&rsquo; growing illegal populace along with the crime, accidents etc. they bring. However, Williamson county is just a few miles, about 10, from where I live. Williamson is not elitist, it has all different levels of income, some elite and some very ordinary or working class. Williamson county has grown hugely because of &#8220;white flight&#8221; from Austin and its&rsquo; problems.  However, now the illegals are following and going to  Williamson county. I don&rsquo;t beleive  for one second Williamson county today is only 1% Latino either, maybe 20 years ago, but today, I see a lot of them when I go to Williamson county. So it doesn&rsquo;t surprise me one bit that they are showing up at the welfare offices and applying for medicaid.</p>

		<p>I worked in health care for over 30 years, most of that in one hospital.  Believe me, the only color health-care institutions care about is GREEN.  As competition became keener between hospitals, the concept of customer service became more important than that of actual health care, because a pleased customer would hopefully be a returning customer.  Patients have gone from being spoken of as patients to clients to customers.  Health care is now just another business.  Who cares if the customers are white, black, or brown?  But, someone must pay the bills, or the business will close down.</p>

		<p>This sheds more light on the recent health scare fiasco. Due to the fact that everyone in this country actually has health care and cannot be denied such. They don&rsquo;t have health insurance, however indigents fall under the old axium you can&rsquo;t get blood from a turnip, and thus don&rsquo;t need health insurance. The whole of Obama care is all about a government takeover of a huge portion of the economy benefitting no one and punishing the majority, period. </p>

		<p>Many many hospitals are laboring under the same issue, the indigent care is driving them deep into the red.  But they will not complain publicly as the budget gap is largely filled by the State.  Thus the State has fiscal life and death determination over the hospital.  Lose political favor and you are gone within a year.  <br>
Subrogation of the laws of finance lead to political solutions, which in turn lead to favors and corruption.  Interested parties become dependents and the structure is very hard to reverse unless it goes catastrophic.  Which it ultimately does with much collateral damage, burdening people who had nothing to do with the issue.  Sounds like the real estate debacle?</p>
