<h1><a href="https://chronicle.com/article/Leader-of-Office-for-Civil/65074/">Stepping Up the Pace at the Office for Civil Rights</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Libby Sander and Peter Schmidt, Chronicle of Higher Education, April 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Education Department&rsquo;s Office for Civil Rights has been revamping its operations to enforce laws against discrimination more consistently and is in the process of reviewing its approach to complaints of anti-Semitism and its guidance to colleges on race-conscious admission policies and gender equity in athletics, the office&rsquo;s chief, Russlynn H. Ali, told The Chronicle on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In a wide-ranging interview, Ms. Ali, who took office as assistant secretary for civil rights last May, also said her office has been ramping up its efforts to advise educational institutions, and suggested that it expects to be handling a larger volume of discrimination complaints and approaching some controversies differently than it had under the Bush administration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among the open cases that Ms. Ali inherited upon taking office are investigations of bias against Asian-American students by Princeton University, allegations that the College of William and Mary and the University of Virginia gave too much weight to applicants&rsquo; race, and challenges to the legality of programs for minority students at Pepperdine University, the University of Missouri, the University of Wisconsin system, and several campuses of the City University of New York.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the Obama administration&rsquo;s intent to be much more supportive of race-conscious admissions than the Bush administration became clear last month, when top lawyers from the Education and Justice Departments joined in submitting a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of the University of Texas at Austin in a lawsuit pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The brief reinforces the university&rsquo;s defense of its race-conscious admission policies.</p>
<p>Whereas the Bush administration had sided against the University of Michigan in a Supreme Court case challenging that institution&rsquo;s consideration of applicants&rsquo; race, the brief the Obama administration lawyers filed last month strongly endorsed Texas&rsquo;s argument that only race-conscious admissions policies would provide it with sufficient levels of diversity to reap the educational benefits it sought.</p>
<p>&#8220;In view of the importance of diversity in educational institutions,&#8221; the brief said, &#8220;the United States, through the Departments of Education and Justice, supports the efforts of school systems and postsecondary educational institutions that wish to develop admission polices that endeavor to achieve the educational benefits of diversity&#8221; in accordance with the Supreme Court ruling upholding Michigan&rsquo;s consideration of race. Guidance &#8216;Soon&rsquo; on Title IX</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a speech given in Selma, Ala., last month, Secretary Duncan said the Office for Civil Rights &#8220;has not been as vigilant as it should have been&#8221; over the past decade in confronting discrimination involving race, gender, and physical disability. He announced plans to open &#8220;compliance review&#8221; investigations at more than 30 school districts nationwide and at six colleges, which the Education Department has yet to name.</p>

		<p>Arne Duncan has expressed the view that the achievement gap in the schools between the races is a civil rights issue because the gap results from discrimination.</p>
<p>Arne Duncan said the following, attributing the school achievement gap to a legacy of racism rather than the Bell Curve distribution of IQ</p>
<blockquote>In his campaign speech on race in Philadelphia, Barack Obama also reminded Americans that many of the disparities that exist today in the black community have deep roots in inequalities in earlier generations that stemmed from the brutal legacy of slavery and Jim Crow. &#8220;Segregated schools,&#8221; he said, &#8220;were, and are, inferior schools. We still haven&rsquo;t fixed them 50 years after Brown v. Board of Education  &mdash;  and the inferior education they provided, then and now, helps explain the pervasive achievement gap between today&rsquo;s black and white students.&#8221; </blockquote>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not sure the Obama administration understands the nature of what they are doing here.  For generations now, abuse of our supreme court, federal courts and federal government have enabled civil rights hucksters to force a way of living on the people in the US over our objections.  Perhaps force isn&rsquo;t the right word here.  It&rsquo;s more like trick.  The majority was tricked into thinking that what they wanted was not in line with the principles of our own country so they gave up on this out of respect for our constitution and the rule of law.  There was some force involved but not much.</p>
<p>Now that agenda is limited in small ways by those same federal institutions and the Obama administration responds by obviously and openly moving to get around them.  He holds them in contempt and questions their legitimacy.</p>
<p>What if he succeeds?  He will gain something in the short term but in the long term he completely undermines the very basis upon which multi-culturalism stands.  Because if individual institutions no longer respect the system so that they can enforce diversity then other insitutions can do the same to enforce the opposite.  And the two cannot compete.</p>
<p>Diversity is not a strength.  And without a strong central authority people respect, holding it up, it can&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Obama is no friend of whites but like medicine that tastes bad, he is good for us.</p>

<p>There are no educational benefits to diversity.  Not any benefit to America anyway, unless you think that excluding smart, motivated white kids from colleges that their ancestors built is favorable, which most of these &#8220;equality minded&#8221; civil rights goons do.  To think that white people have allowed these blatantly anti-white policies to exist even when we are a large majority in this country is unbelievable and demoralizing.  </p>

<p>Very well then. We will catch up with the progress of the times. We also will defend our race-conscious admissions policies for who can be admitted into our homes. Whites only.</p>

<p>Translation:  We&rsquo;re always looking for more ways to take more money from white people via taxes and lawsuits and even more ways to encroach on the personal freedoms of heterosexual, white, non-Jewish Americans.</p>

		<p>This just means that we&rsquo;ll have more and more unqualified people working in higher positions than they qualify for - and causing untold wreckage for untold numbers of innocent people because of their ineptness.  I don&rsquo;t go to black doctors or dentists, nor would I hire a black contractor to build so much as a broom closet, because they basically are affirmative action products and would never have gotten into the university on the basis of merit.  I want to go back to ABILITY as being the guideline to academic admissions; it&rsquo;d be easy to do that, because anyone who needs remedial English or math should automatically be kicked out of the university level, or perhaps kicked down to community college level.  Nobody who can&rsquo;t cut it should be allowed into any university program. </p>

<p>I would never trust an Arab to handle cases of anti-Semitism. He&rsquo;ll probably just protect the perpetrators, because he&rsquo;s probably secretely anti-Semitic himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; confronting discrimination involving race, gender, and physical disability.&#8221;</p>
<p>You mean you can&rsquo;t discriminate aginst physically disabled people anymore? So does that mean the Dodgers will have to allow parapalegics on their team? Will Harvard be foced to admit students with IQ&rsquo;s of less than 80? We have definately gone to far.</p>

<p>Evertime I read one of these reports, I can&rsquo;t help but think of this prophetic short story by Vonnegut. :</p>
<p>HARRISON BERGERON</p>

		<p>For a good cautionary tale that reads fast and becomes more and more relevant every day, read &#8220;Harrison Bergeron&#8221; By Kurt Vonnegut Jr. It is a Sci Fi short about life in a world where everyone is forced to handicap themselves so there can at last be &#8220;equal outcome&#8221; -it should be required reading alongside 1984.</p>
<p>I read it years ago and it was funny. I read it now and it is scary. Tommorow I will read it and it will have become sad.</p>

<p>Only if you consider deploying the United States Army against its own citizens not much in the way of force. Integration was not a peaceful affair.</p>
