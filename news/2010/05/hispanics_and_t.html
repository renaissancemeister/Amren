<h1><a href="http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1593/hispanic-black-white-ged-high-school-dropout-rate">Hispanics and the GED</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard Fry, Pew Hispanic Center, May 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Just one-in-ten Hispanic high school dropouts has a General Educational Development (GED) credential, widely regarded as the best &#8220;second chance&#8221; pathway to college, vocational training and military service for adults who have not graduated from high school. By contrast, two-in-ten black high school dropouts and three-in-ten white high school dropouts have a GED, according to a Pew Hispanic Center analysis of newly available educational attainment data from the U.S. Census Bureau&rsquo;s 2008 American Community Survey.</p>
<p>The relatively low level of GED credentialing among Hispanic high school dropouts is especially notable because Hispanics have a much higher high school dropout rate than do blacks or whites. Some 41% of Hispanics ages 20 and older in the United States do not have a regular high school diploma, versus 23% of comparably aged blacks and 14% of whites.</p>
<p>Among Hispanics, there are significant differences between the foreign born and the native born in high school diploma attainment rates and GED credentialing rates. Some 52% of foreign-born Latino adults are high school dropouts, compared with 25% of the native born. And among Hispanic dropouts, some 21% of the native born have a GED, compared with just 5% of the foreign born.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>* However, Hispanic full-time, full-year workers with a GED had about the same mean annual earnings ($33,504) as Hispanic full-time, full-year workers with a high school diploma ($32,972).</p>

		<p>Hispanic (Mexican) parents in the barrios think NOTHING of taking their kids out of school for 6 or more weeks to go down to Mexico - because la abuelita is sick or died, or Tia Rosa is sick or died or got married   &mdash;   any old excuse is good enough.  Very often they move all their belongings out of their house, store them, and when they get back get another house.  Very infrequently, they ask the child&rsquo;s teacher to give their kid 6 weeks worth of work to do while gone to Mexico - but they usually do it on a Friday afternoon when they&rsquo;re leaving late Friday night, and the teacher has no time to prepare the lessons.  Our principal finally told the Hispanic parents that they had to give the teacher 2 weeks&rsquo; notice before demanding lessons for their soon to be absent child.  Basically it&rsquo;s true - Mexicans do not value education.  It isn&rsquo;t hard to understand; in Mexico compulsory education stops after grade 6, so they consider anyone in junior high an &#8220;educated&#8221; person.  This situation is of course denied by the PC crowd at the education depts. at all universities.  But they are lying through their teeth - and when their newby teachers get out into the real world, they find out the hard way.</p>

		<p>Where I work, the grade 9-10 Latina girls are getting pregnant one after another.  They soon drop out.  Most of the South American kids are sort of okay and a few are genuinely smart.  Mexican and Dominican students are the ones most likely to take school as a joke, though a minority from each group are good students.</p>

		<p>Mexicans know that they can always get an unskilled job in construction, auto body repair, or food services that pays well and doesn&rsquo;t require a high school education, nor very much brains, nor fluency in the English language.  So why should they work so hard to get a high school diploma?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Education not a high priority for Hispanics.&#8221; </p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to go to school, then when they see whites in good positions earning money more because they&rsquo;be been here longer, plus they&rsquo;ve sacrificed and worked for what they have, mestizos whine and complain about racism, alleging they&rsquo;re victims for not having as much.</p>
<p>This entire empire is just a total failure for the rank and file whites who have had these non-white cry babies foisted on them by power hungry politician and money grubbing corporate crooks.</p>
<p>Anything but a homogeneous culture is doomed to fail, just as we are seeing this one do right now.  Soon war will occur and break up will be upon us.</p>
<p>Some experts I&rsquo;ve read look on the split as an opportunity for a renaissance, even though we will wind up with less land.  </p>

<p>Well, maybe four weeks in most cases. The village of Cicero, IL., mostly shuts down for a month around Christmas time. Entire blocks of residents go to the old country to celebrate. Really! The streets are strangely empty of cars during that time. Everyone gone to the moon!</p>
<p>That is one aspect of current immigration that is different from how it was 100 years ago. Immigrants such as the Mex travel back and forth at will, the old country is a days drive away in most cases, or a short airplane hop. And they do have the bucks too.</p>

		<p>Hate to sound like a dissenter here, but I have to say that the dropouts probably aren&rsquo;t missing out too much on average.  One third of college grads in this country are functionally illiterate.  About half the degrees are worthless designed only to make money for lenders to students.  People are being forced to PAY five figure sums to get a chance at employment above minimum wage level jobs.  That&rsquo;s the racket.</p>
<p>American universities are such a joke and a disgrace that many of their degrees are worthless.  The government run student loan industry makes sure there are plenty of pieces of fiat paper to hand out to suckers willing to repay loans for them in exchange for nothing of real value.  I&rsquo;m glad so few minorities go to college.  It keeps them from becoming radicalized psuedo-intellectuals working for Karl Marx.</p>

		<p>Our hostile and alien ruling elites prefer a population of uneducated nitwits - easier to control, easier to fool, and it relieves from the elites any pressure to obey the law, follow the Constitutional restraints on their power and their behavior.</p>
<p>This is something that finally dawned on me, about 15 or 20 years ago - and it was a shocking revelation.   Our elites envy what they see these third world, banana republic, tin-horn dictators getting away with!  Murdering their political opponents.  Stealing the people blind.  No shackles or restraints of any kind on the sort of criminality that they can engage in!  A culture of total, absolute corruption - this appeals to our current crop of blue-suited criminals who we have stupidly allowed to rise to the top in America.  </p>
<p>Traditionally, Whites are too prone towards expecting law abiding, orderly, moral societies - and far less tolerant of politicians who break the law.</p>
<p>But, I guess we can subtract from that pool of whites, those who cast two votes each for Clinton and for little Bush, since there were a pair of white politicians who broke every law in the book, and who had nothing but contempt for the Constitution and Bill of Rights.  But, I&rsquo;m referring to the traditional conservative, white Americans - paleoconservatives, as they are now called.  </p>
<p>Hence, race replacement of whites has been the official policy of our hostile, hate filled ruling class since 1965&rsquo;s immigration law changes ushered in the White Genocide Program.   To stop it, the ruling class who is currently in power has to be removed and dealt with as the criminals that they most certainly are. </p>
<p>Arizona is showing us the path, fellow AR readers.  </p>

		<p>On racial differences in IQ / thinking &amp; speech patterns :  How many of you have experienced this: On the telephone, it is often easy to get a basically accurate idea of the other person&rsquo;s approximate IQ by simply talking with them (and especially listening to them). </p>
<p>I have noticed on several occasions when I speak with customer service that some CS people are clearly smarter (and better problem-solvers) than others. This can often be the difference between a FedEx package getting delivered on time or one day late (as just happened to me). </p>
<p>Some US industries are worse than others when it comes to doing something as ridiculous and as detrimental to their own company&rsquo;s image as hiring foreign-born operators who speak heavily-accented English, in a job that absurdly involves a lot of verbal information swap. </p>
<p>The Hispanic male operator I just had on the line to validate a phone card was both a poor English speaker, and obviously not too bright (were I fluent in Spanish I could have confirmed this by speaking with him, but I&rsquo;m not, so I&rsquo;ll just have to be prejudiced and take a guess). </p>
<p>Dealing with people who are thick  is often an  infuriating experience: my Mehican operator had to repeat each number three or four times (&#8220;Six&#8221; becomes &#8220;seeeeh&#8221;; &#8220;Eight&#8221; becomes &#8220;ayyyyh&#8221;), causing the torture to be prolonged by quadruple the time a competent English speaker could have conducted the call in. </p>
<p>One thing that sticks out when talking with these Mexican customer service people, is the very evident slowness of the minds of a lot of them. In my last conversation, not only did the repeating and the noting of 9-digit numbers take four times as long as it should have, also it made me notice that my interlocutor&rsquo;s capacity to even hear me - let alone comprehend me - was grotesquely limited. </p>
<p>For example, through the laborious exchange of numbers and other information (&#8220;Could you please repeat that, I did not understand&#8221;), it became clear that this person was impervious to helpful interruption. </p>
<p>In other words: when you&rsquo;re talking with a bright person, in an effective, intelligent conversation that is a flow of information, the other person will stop talking when you need to interject, instantly. </p>
<p>My Mexican operator would continue talking for seconds - hole strings of numbers at a time - even after I would try to stop him because he was spewing the wrong information. </p>
<p>I realized afterwards that this man&rsquo;s mind was traveling at 62mph, while mine (and anyone normal) was zipping by at 105mph. And this is not because I drank a lot of coffee (the NYT might disagree), nor because there was a delay in the satellite connection down to Mehico. </p>
<p>I do not want to speak ill of Mexicans or anyone, but the fact that certain US companies hire telephone operators who speak English like an impaired Speedy Gonzalez is unfortunate. </p>
<p>The NWO is a sad place to be. </p>

		<p>Please keep in mind this article and the statistics included herein. Remember them whenever you hear or read of someone talking about &#8220;white privilege&#8221; - the theory that white people are more successful than Hispanics and blacks simply because whites live a privileged existence.</p>
<p>In reality, we whites are more successful, among other reasons, because we work harder, both in school and in the business world.</p>

<p>Let your voice be heard. </p>
<p> I do.</p>
<p>Whenever I&rsquo;ve had the unpleasant experience of having to listen to broken, incomprehensible English spoken to me from 5,000 miles away as I&rsquo;m trying to get CS or technical support  &mdash;  and I, as a customer, spending my hard-earned money (fiat or otherwise) am NOT SATISFIED, I COMPLAIN TO THE COMPANY (as everyone should!).</p>
<p>It is (usually) easy to find a link to the company&rsquo;s headquarters on its website and from there you can lodge e-mail complaints.  Don&rsquo;t mention race  &mdash;  but do tell them that you couldn&rsquo;t understand a word CS or technical services said and therefore will sever your business with that company.  </p>
<p>I always bring up the name of the business&rsquo;s competition and state that from now on, I will be conducting business with the rival.</p>
<p>If enough of us do this, companies WILL take notice, especially during these supposed recessionary times.</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;you can always do your bit by engaging in guerrilla economics&hellip;use the companies&rsquo; own feedback forms to tell them why you were not happy with their customer service or technical support (but avoid any racial angle and concentrate on language barriers and operators&rsquo; unsatisfactory levels of cognitive ability).<br>

We can&hellip;exert pressure to cause them to move in our direction as they chase our money&hellip;.they know that without customers&rsquo; wallets, they are nothing.

		<p>Hispanics I&rsquo;ve had the displeasure of dealing with in person are as a group the most willfully ignorant bunch I have ever met. While there are some who do appreciate and strive for getting an education, most look at education and learning as a joke or wasted effort. They are often incredibly ignorant and dangerous to work around as well, paying no heed to their safety or others near them. One stuck a screwdriver into an energized switch gear cabinet that has 1,200 amps of 240-volt electrical current flowing through it. He was very lucky that all that did was melt his screwdriver instead of shorting the equipment out, killing him in the process. Another shorted out a 480-volt panel with a steel tape measure and by some miracle escaped unharmed. The worst of the worst I have ever seen in all respects has been Mexicans, Guatemalans and Hondurans. But willful ignorance is a trait that is common among Hispanics in general, especially the dirt poor ones our enemy elites are Hell bent on flooding into our dying country.</p>

		<p>Bon, From Nola, and anyone else so interested:</p>
<p>The angle I took when a certain communications company and a certain bank couldn&rsquo;t adhere to my request thanks to outsourced Asian call centers is this:  I wrote a registered letter to their respective CEOs, noting that since my unfulfilled request involved their company wrongly getting money and me wrongly losing that same amount of money, (which they did in both cases), that I sent a CC of that registered letter as another registered letter to the St. Louis office of the FBI. (Which I did.)</p>
<p>My complaints were quickly addressed.</p>
<p>As for the subject matter at hand, I once saw a documentary on a defunct cable sports channel called CNNSI.  It was about baseball summer camps in the Dominican Republic.  It admitted that while, in theory, Dominicans are required to go to school through the age of 14, in enforced reality, most are allowed to exit at around age 11 or 12, especially if they demonstrate baseball talent.  Which is probably wise anyway, that&rsquo;s a little past the age where American blacks level off in brain development, and since most DRers are mostly black or mulatto with a bit of Indian mixed in, the government is merely turning them loose into semi-adulthood at the right time.</p>

		<p>I suspect the different educational attainment rates for Hispanics is due to cultural factors and not necessarily an inherent intellectual deficit. I have cousins in my extended family who have Spanish and Native American blood, and to be perfectly honest, they&rsquo;ve got me beat when it comes to visiospatial skills and mathematics.  They work as engineers. I&rsquo;ve read that Eskimos are stronger in visiospatial skills than some whites, who are stronger in verbal reasoning   &mdash;   might this difference extend to other Indian groups, as well? (Including those dubbed &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; but who carry South American Indian genes?)  </p>
<p>I had a Hispanic friend in high school who was an amazing artist.  There are some profoundly talented Hispanic people. Let&rsquo;s not overlook this. </p>

<p>I can sympathize.  Hispanics that I&rsquo;ve worked with, for the most part, simply do not pay attention to anything they are doing, and they are indeed heedless of their personal safety to an extreme.  I worked in a grocery store, and all full time employees had very good health benefits, and it was so common to see the hispanics basically work themselves until they were injured, then get surgery and sick leave.  It wasn&rsquo;t that they were &#8220;working themselves to death,&#8221; it was that they paid no heed to basic safety measures, i.e. lifting with your legs, not your back, taking care of your knees when lifting, etc.  One mexican guy I worked with shot his knees out completely  &mdash;  he surgery four times, then finally gave up.  He was addicted to vicodin  &mdash;  his doc here quit prescribing it for him, so he scheduled his vacations around his need to pick up more pain medication in mexico and bring it back with him.  He damn near caused multiple accidents daily running the forklift while high on his meds, but since he never actually managed to cause one, management couldn&rsquo;t force him to take a drug test.  BTW  &mdash;  he was legal.  He took advantage of the Reagan amnesty and became a citizen.  I will say, though, that a good portion of the hispanics I worked with there voted  &mdash;  or at least claimed to vote  &mdash;  republican, out of loyalty to Reagan for the amnesty, at least during presidential elections.  They all voted for Bush because he spoke bastard spanish, and they figured he&rsquo;d grant another amnesty for all their friends and relatives.</p>

<p>One thing is that most of the Hispanics who come here from Mexico  are coming from the lowest and least educated class in their OWN country. Mexico does have a middle and upper class but these are not the ones coming over here. You don&rsquo;t see Mexican doctors or teachers sneaking across the border. As such, the USA ends up with THEIR poor, THEIR uneducated, THEIR underclass and THEIR problems. This is what Mexico wants, instead of providing jobs or fixing things for their underclass, they dump them off on us so they can work and send their money back to Mexico. Our traitors in Big Business and Washington want them for the slave labor and votes they provide.</p>

		<p>I have to agree with Jonathan: we&rsquo;re steadily decreasing in intelligence to the point where it feels as though the coming generations will need instructional videos on how to open a book, let alone read literature of merit. We need to leave behind those who cannot help themselves, and take everyone who can and put them to use in society instead of allowing handouts to go crack addicted single moms giving blow jobs outside McDonalds for spare change while the hard working, honest people are left bereft of any aid.</p>
