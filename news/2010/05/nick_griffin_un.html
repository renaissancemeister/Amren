			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matthew Taylor, Guardian (London), May 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The British National party leader, Nick Griffin, was coming under increasing pressure tonight after the party appeared to be on course for its third electoral setback in 24 hours.</p>
<p>Early indications from the council elections in Barking and Dagenham suggested the far right party had performed poorly, falling far short of the votes it requires to take control of the east London authority  &mdash;  one of three key BNP targets ahead of this week&rsquo;s elections.</p>
<p>The council setback follows Griffin&rsquo;s resounding defeat in the parliamentary seat of Barking where he was beaten into third place, getting 18,000 fewer votes than Labour&rsquo;s victorious candidate Margaret Hodge.</p>
<p>In the BNP&rsquo;s other key target seat of Stoke Central, the party&rsquo;s deputy leader Simon Darby came fourth behind Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives, with 2,502 votes.</p>
<p>Early results in other council elections suggested the BNP had also performed poorly on a local level. In Leeds the BNP&rsquo;s only councillor Chris Beverly lost his seat; in Stoke, where the party had claimed to be on the verge of taking control of the council, it lost two councillors, leaving it with five out 60.</p>
<p>The party&rsquo;s poor performance led to calls on far-right websites today for a change of leadership.</p>
<p>Anti-racist campaigners from Hope not Hate, which had mobilised 1,000 people in the fight against the BNP, said that if the predictions about the party&rsquo;s performance in the local elections proved accurate Griffin&rsquo;s position would become increasingly precarious. &#8220;We have had over 1,000 volunteers helping with the anti-BNP campaign in Barking and Dagenham since the beginning of April,&#8221; said Nick Lowles, editor of anti-fascist magazine Searchlight. &#8220;This has proved that the BNP&rsquo;s message of hate can be beaten by good, community-based campaigning, and has left Nick Griffin very exposed.&#8221;</p>
<p>This morning after the parliamentary result was announced at Goresbrook leisure centre, Griffin said his position was safe, telling reporters the BNP was resilient. &#8220;I will be the leader of the British National party as long as that is what the members want me to be,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The party&rsquo;s campaign had been beset by problems before today&rsquo;s results, with several senior figures publicly criticising Griffin in the runup to the poll. This week the BNP&rsquo;s website was closed and replaced with a posting from Simon Bennett, the party&rsquo;s website manager, accusing Griffin and James Dowson, the BNP election fundraiser, of being &#8220;pathetic, desperate and incompetent&#8221;.</p>
<p>Last month the party&rsquo;s publicity director, Mark Collett, who was considered a Griffin loyalist, was arrested on suspicion of threatening to kill the party leader, and in Stoke, the senior BNP councillor Alby Walker decided to stand as an independent because of a &#8220;vein of Holocaust-denying&#8221; within the party. &#8220;They&rsquo;ve still got senior members of the BNP who will be candidates in the general election that have Nazi, Nazi-esque sympathies,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>On the eve of the election this week the BNP&rsquo;s campaign descended into violence when one of its councillors and the party&rsquo;s London organiser, Bob Bailey, was caught on camera fighting in the street with a group of teenagers.</p>
<p>Footage appeared to show one of the teenagers spitting at a group of BNP activists before Bailey and others appeared to launch a flurry of punches at him and then, as he was on the ground, tried to kick him. The BNP refused to comment on the incident.</p>
<p>Today Hodge, who increased her majority in Barking, said that the fight against the BNP had been the most important of her political career.</p>
<p>&#8220;This really is a great moment in our history. On behalf of all the people in Britain, we in Barking have not just beaten but we have smashed the extreme right,&#8221; she told her supporters. &#8220;The lesson from Barking to the BNP is clear: Get out and stay out, you&rsquo;re not wanted here and your vile politics have no place in British democracy. Pack your bags and go!&#8221;<br>

						<p>
							<i>Laura Roberts, London Telegraph, May 7, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>The British National Party&rsquo;s attempt to join mainstream politics was thwarted by the electorate after the right-wing party failed to win any seats.</p>
<p>Nick Griffin, leader of the BNP and the most prominent candidate, lost to Margaret Hodge, the former Labour minister, in Barking.</p>
<p>The BNP put forward an unprecedented number of candidates playing on the prominence of immigration as a key electoral issue. The party may have hoped to win increased votes following Gordon Brown&rsquo;s gaffe after he called Gillian Duffy a &#8220;bigoted woman&#8221; when she questioned him on immigration.</p>
<p>Mr Griffin&rsquo;s party fielded more than 300 candidates in the election from seats stretching from Barking to Salisbury to Rotherham.</p>
<p>But all across the country BNP candidates trailed in the votes. Esther Rantzen may have lost in Luton South with only 1,872 votes but she beat the BNP candidate Tony Blakey who came in fifth place with 1,299 votes.</p>
<p>The BNP won no seats in Westminster but won more than half a million votes countrywide.</p>
<p>In east London, Mrs Hodge said: &#8220;This is really a great moment in our history, a never-to-be forgotten moment for both the good and decent people of Barking and Dagenham,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our election here in this constituency was very different from elsewhere in Britain and our voters faced a stark choice.</p>
<p>&#8220;And they have overwhelmingly chosen to support a democratic politics, built on tolerance, on fairness and on decency. Not a fascist politics built on division, prejudice and hatred.</p>
<p>&#8220;The lesson from Barking to the BNP is clear: Get out and stay out, you&rsquo;re not wanted here and your vile politics have no place in British democracy. Pack your bags and go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Griffin, who won 6,620 votes coming third, acknowledged that results had fallen short of expectations.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;I would say this to the people of Britain: It is going to be too late for Barking, but it is not too late for Britain. Get rid of our masters before they get rid of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>He blamed the high turnout of 61.8 per cent for counting against him.<br>

		<p>The only real good news is that in England, the BNP&rsquo;s percentage share of the vote went up from 0.8% to 2.1%, and in Wales, it went from practically nothing to 1.6% of the vote.  It&rsquo;s just that the winner take all system makes it really hard to win seats.  </p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a dog in the race, why go to the track?  The reason the BNP did much better in the E/P elections a year ago is because the system the European Parliament uses for elections rewards smaller parties, thereby giving BNP sympathists a dog in the race.  One of the lucky things that might fall out of the design of a Cameron/Clegg coalition is that Clegg wants electoral reform, to help smaller parties like his own, and Cameron looks like he&rsquo;ll concede to the LibDems on that issue.</p>
<p>Minority party administrations in parliamentary democracies don&rsquo;t last that long, according to the BBC.  With this bad economy, I get the feeling that there will be another election before the end of next year.  If immigration gets worse (any administration with the LibDems will see to that), anti-white crime gets worse, and throw on top of that a reformed electoral process, and the BNP could do far better next time.</p>

		<p>The mass media use of demonization of BNP, and other nationalist<br>
parties in which name calling such as racist, hater, a nazi.<br>
Is a effective tool of the left. They will never enter an<br>
intelligent debate, and a conversation on race, and the effects<br>
of multiculturalism on society.<br>
The use of television in spreading falsehoods, and <br>
misinformation, and degrading the opposition because they<br>
dare challenge political correctness. Images of TV are very<br>
powerful. The viewers believes that this is real life,<br>
and accepts the political correctness doctrine. The viewer<br>
repeats what he has heard on TV as accepted truth. And<br>
follows him in what decisions he makes in marking his ballot.<br>
This is why people whom avoid the mass media are far more<br>
intelligent and have a realistic view of their surroundings.<br>
With regrets they are a minority.</p>

		<p>An another item I want to add to my above comments.</p>
<p>The political correct if engaged in a hostile debate, always have people of the mind of the political correct booing, and hissing.  When you do not have an intelligent audience to hear bought sides, is evidence of a society in decline.  When seen on TV this has a traumatic effect on viewers, and in most case, influences their political decisions, and thinking.</p>
<p>The left will never have an intelligent debate on race, and other issues is because they would be on the losing side. </p>

		<p>The other chap said it already in so many words. If you control the mass media, you control what *most* people think. The majority do not think for themselves. When the same ideas are repeated in the press, on the tele, 24/7, most people can&rsquo;t hear anything else. And on those television appearances where someone from the far right is allowed to speak, everything is choreographed to make him look not only inarticulate, but insane.  Audiences watching the program see that the studio audience disapprove, and the other speakers disapprove, and they think, &#8220;yes, I also must disapprove of this man and his ideas, clearly everyone else thinks he is insane&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;s not much room for optimism here. Without control of mass media, we cannot hope to make any gains in electoral politics.</p>

		<p>There is no sense of survival among the British people.  This election proves it.</p>
<p>The charade of a &#8220;United Kingdom&#8221; will last as long as Queen Elizabeth II lives.  When she dies the fun begins.  Charles will, of course, become King and head of State upon her death, and he will remain King during the period of public mourning.  Then the politicians will begin the debate over &#8220;republicanism&#8221;.  It will start out over the relevancy of the monarchy, of course  And how the monarchy is undemocratic.  But the debate will devolve into how can a white man represent a multi-cultural nation?  And since it appears William will marry white there is no &#8220;hope for change&#8221; there.</p>
<p>The Scottish independence parties will see this as their chance to pull out of the UK and will welcome the chaos.  The republicans will see the transition from Elizabeth to Charles as a chance to overthrow the Windsors.  Both sides will make a deal with the devil and side with the non-whites in pressing for a new form of government and a more &ldquo;representative&rdquo; head of state.</p>
<p>Royalists will be branded as racists.  Tradition will be branded as racist.  The multi-cultis will win and the Windsors exiled as a symbol of white oppression of people of color.  The subjugation of the indigenous white Britons will then be complete.</p>
<p>Similar to what the Republican party has done in this country to make sure their big business contributors get the cheap labor they crave.  And, of course, to avoid being branded &ldquo;racist&rdquo;, which happens regardless of how much they pander.  They have just about put themselves out of business.</p>
<p>Democracy with universal suffrage is not a pretty thing.  That is why our founders were against it.  They were right.<br>

		<p>I normally try to be very optimistic on this website, and I give others a hard time who seem to pull us down by making pessimistic comments on here.  I usually look at things this way&hellip;&hellip;.yes, we are moving forward slowly, but at least we are moving forward.  I started posting on this website 6 years ago, and I have seen nothing but progress the whole time.  Yes, it is small and slow, but it is still progress.</p>
<p>I hate to inform everyone, but after watching the election results last night and then reading this article here, I think I have for the first time, started to lose some hope in our people. I can&rsquo;t believe the people of the United Kingdom are this naive with political correctness.  I was expecting the BNP to make a very strong showing this time, and to at least gain 1 seat.  I was almost certain it would happen.  Now I don&rsquo;t know what to say.</p>
<p>The countries of the Anglosphere have turned into total jokes.  Expect the Olympics opening ceremony in London in 2012 to be nothing but a celebration for diversity.  If you don&rsquo;t believe me, watch the following video, which is a prelude.  When you are done watching that, compare it to the next video I have listed which shows the prelude that the Chinese put on in Athens to show the world what they would do four years later in 2008.  The white race (at least the English speaking chunk of it) has turned into a joke.  Meanwhile the East Asians beam with pride.</p>

		<p>I have been to two to three BNP friendly websites.</p>
<p>They are aware of the current political dynamic.  They recognize that Clegg is pushing for PR.  If PR existed with this election, BNP would now have 60 seats/MPs in Parliment based on this election&rsquo;s result.</p>
<p>If you search a little, you will find a massive amount of vote fraud has taken place in the UK.</p>

<p>Did the BNP do as well as we&rsquo;d hoped? Perhaps not   &mdash;   but given the first-past-the-post system, they did about as well as could be reasonably expected. But the main thing is: they&rsquo;re in the game now. They can&rsquo;t be ignored. </p>
<p>Is yesterday&rsquo;s performance at the polls any reason to question the leadership of Nick Griffin? Of course not! If not for Griffin, the party would never have got more than some tiny fraction of 1% of the vote. It&rsquo;s Griffin who&rsquo;s got the BNP this far, and it would be terrible ingratitude   &mdash;   not to mention insanity   &mdash;   to consider replacing him. </p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s stop all this silly talk questioning Griffin&rsquo;s leadership (which may be nothing more than a divide-and-conquer strategy by The Guardian anyway) and look to the serious business of readying the BNP for the NEXT election   &mdash;   which is entirely possible within the next 6 - 12 months. </p>

		<p>I can only repeat what I have said at other times. </p>
<p>The West is white, and there is no reason to assume that our civilization will survive if we are demographically subsumed by non-whites (and many to conclude otherwise). For our civilization, and ultimately our race itself, to survive, for reasons I have set forth here at other times, whites must maintain sovereign majorities in at least some territories. Put more clearly, we must have our own countries, which would preferably be all-white, though I think our culture and civ could endure if we were only preponderant, but also &#8216;racialized&rsquo;, majorities. I suspect most AR readers would agree with me (though certain complicating issues would have to be disposed of; eg, how did the Jews survive so long, and why can&rsquo;t whites - and we, in our present form, cannot/will not  - emulate them?).   </p>
<p>What is so dispiriting about elections like that of the US in 2000, France in 2002, and Britain this week, is that here were  golden opportunities for the Silent Majority of allegedly anti-immigrant, pro-white, pro-nation patriots to register their disapproval with their respective dispossessionist regimes - and the silence is always deafening. In the US we had, for once, a genuine anti-immigrationist in Pat Buchanan; in Britain, which has been alarmingly overrun just in the past dozen years of Labour, you had the BNP (or even UKIP or just the wet Tories); most disturbingly of all, in France, Le Pen was actually in the final run-off - and yet the vast bulk of oppressed whites, having spent a generation watching their beloved and ancient French nation overrun by culturally hostile, physically dangerous, often criminal, and racially alien Muslims, could not bring themselves to vote for him.</p>
<p>Whites were once the greatest race, but today most of our people everywhere are deluded and weak. This is not merely a local or nation-specific problem. With the needless capitulation of the Boer Republic, there is not a single race-conscious majority, or even large minority, anywhere is the Western world. The only exceptions might be whites of the American Deep South, a true &#8220;nation within nation&#8221;; the racially pure, and often color-conscious, white minority elites sprinkled throughout Latin America, who have more in common with each other than with their own national, mestizo populations, and who, gathered together, would thus constitute a real ethnonation; or maybe the Ulster Protestants - maybe), and though I know little about Eastern Europe, I expect them to travel our path of race-denial as they become increasingly &#8216;Westernized&rsquo; through economic integration within the EU. Lastly, Russia may yet survive, but even counting it as a white nation (something neither Hitler nor Madison Grant would have done, at least for the bulk of the population), it will eventually crumble apart ethnically, with the small, genuine white portion looking towards Europe - and then also following the path to race-denial, economic growth + immigrant worker-importation, and multicultural suicide.</p>
<p>Seriously, what hope is there for our racial (and thus civilizational) perpetuity? </p>
<p>The only hope is foreign demographic/electoral conquest of a sovereign nation. WNs are a small minority everywhere, but add us up across the planet, and even demographically, we could be, if concentrated within a single jurisdiction, a powerful force - very powerful if we consider that WNs are usually, contrary to media stereotypes, more intelligent than the general populations surrounding them. My very rough estimate is that there may be as many as 50 million white &#8216;racists&rsquo; (as defined by the liberal media) on the planet. Most of these are not, unfortunately, ideologically committed WNs, just persons like many I know personally (I also know other WNs like me) who aren&rsquo;t ashamed of being white, generally dislike non-whites, vote pro-white, again as the media would define that, and prefer living with whites. </p>
<p>As conditions worsen for whites everywhere, we all should start thinking long-term about where we could flee to. What country is most promising to settle in? Emigration is tremendously difficult, but not nearly so much anymore as it was when, for example, our ancestors came to North America. And we do have a rough precedent: Israel. If the Jews could reclaim a piece of ancient territory for themselves, so they could have their own ethnostate, why can&rsquo;t we?</p>

		<p>Because of a shared language, the Americans tend to pay too much attention to Britain and forget that it is only one of many European nations.</p>
<p>And the BNP is only one of many ethnocentric parties in Europe.</p>
<p>Here in Italy, the Northern League, which is anti-foreigner almost as much as the BNP, has two regional governors and is a policy-influencing member of the government coalition.</p>

		<p>All I can say for this disappointment is that the Brits still control their own destiny, no matter how foolishly. Across our civilization, the West, whites deny themselves their own interests, for some reason. It&rsquo;s curious and unique how selfless whites act, to the point of oblivion. What more can you give away than your homeland, your way of life, your very future? Why are we such lemmings, dodos, sheep? WHY? </p>
<p>With no worse enemy than ourselves, perhaps most whites in some white nation will yet change their minds, while they still have that luxury. This may inspire other whites. Let&rsquo;s keep standing up for this   &mdash;   our basic human rights   &mdash;   for ourselves and all people everywhere. </p>
<p>Well, glad to hear the BNP&rsquo;s share of the vote actually rose.</p>

		<p>While agreeing with the previous comments, I offer a supplementary explanation: Leadership.  Charismatic, dynamic leadership.  That&rsquo;s what the BNP lacks, and it shows in its performance.  They should have done better than they have. Nick Griffin appears to be a decent, brave, patriotic man, and a highly effective adminstrator.  He has done essential work in party organization and building from the grass-roots.  But he doesn&rsquo;t have the chops to lead the BNP to major electoral success.  He&rsquo;s not particularly quick on his feet (witness his infamous TV interview last year) and isn&rsquo;t an inspiring speaker.

Istvan, I don&rsquo;t think the royalty is anywhere near as important as you suggest to the majority of the population. The monarch has only theoretical political power and very few people under 60 years old care whose head gets put on a banknote.<br>

		<p>The BNP&rsquo;s lack of success is hardly surprising given the incompetence and bickering of the leadership. The media portral of the BNP leadership isn&rsquo;t entirely inaccurate.</p>
<p>However, two optimistic notes. The BNP share actually increased since last Westminster election, no matter how the media present their failure to win seats. Secondly, there are significant elements within the Conservative Party that do recognise what a mistake mass immigration has been and will quietly do their best at damage control. Whereas the Labour government was overwhelmingly in favour of mass immigration, the new Conservative government will be far more sceptical. Unlike Labour, it owes relatively little to ethnic minorities. That&rsquo;s clearly an improvement.</p>
<p>Also, the British people for the most part haven&rsquo;t felt much austerity yet. Labour has successfully delayed the financial pain until they&rsquo;re safely out of power. Brutal spending cuts are needed to avoid a Greek style guilt (ie. government bond) strike. A few years of mass unemployment and economic misery will harden attitudes, especially if social welfare cut backs result in further race riots.</p>

		<p>The people who once nearly ran the world are moving full speed towards inevitable extinction. This is what happens when you live by liberal, naive and childish morals. The west is full of morality but lacks wisdom while the illiterate masses of the third world lack universal morality and intelligence but make it up my selfishness, healthy instincts, natural racist tendencies, common sense and wisdom. In this immoral universe we live in, the inevitable winners are obvious. 200 years from now millions of poor Africans will be squatting near their huts (the descendants of today&rsquo;s Africans) in Africa while the only trace of an England will be the monuments they have left behind in Britain (if the mullahs allow) and the empire.</p>

		<p>No. This was sheer electoral fraud on a massive scale. The abuse of postal votes in &#8220;enriched&#8221; constituencies combined with easily tampered-with ballot boxes and the tactical closure of polling stations to white voters in vulnerable Labour seats has led to a massive misrepresentation of the BNP&rsquo;s share of the popular vote.</p>
<p>New Labour are the most unpopular political party in Britain&rsquo;s history, and Margaret Hodge - who has a personal fortune of £50 million - is a sleazy, corrupt figure mired in scandals, including the blind eye she turned to endemic homosexual paedophile abuse in council-run children&rsquo;s homes in Islington under her leadership.</p>

		<p>When I used to live and work in Buenos Aires, Argentina a number of years ago, I met several British teachers living abroad, and spent my first few years in the early 1980&rsquo;s socializing with them. I was especially fascinated by the &#8220;gift of gab&#8221; of the British, especially the well educated ones.</p>
<p>But I quickly realized that when it came to the question of race, all were even much more brainwashed than their U.S. counterparts. I think this largely has to do with the historical realities of race relations in the United States, which obviously goes back much further than in Great Britain. When so many blacks began entering the United Kingdom after World War II, thanks to lax immigration policies, it was easy to get the people to buy into the &#8220;all men are created equal&#8221; philosophy and see blacks as simply &#8220;exotic human beings&#8221; and nothing more.</p>
<p>On the other hand, even the rabid liberals or brainwashed conservatives in the U.S. &#8220;talk the talk but don&rsquo;t walk the walk.&#8221; Very few are living in mixed neighborhoods, especially in the big cities, and the &#8220;tipping point&#8221; for when an integratged neighborhood starts having &#8220;white flight&#8221; is probably no more than 20-30 %. I think the fact that there is at least a collective white memory of centuries of racial segregation for southerners, and de facto segregation for northerners, helps to maintain a semblance of European-American unity in the U.S., despite all the outward and mostly hypocritical conformity to the prescribed, political correctness regarding racial relations between blacks and whites. This is something that the whites in Great Britain don&rsquo;t have to fall back on, and thus makes it likely that only a total economic collapse of the world economy is likely to change the thinking for whites who live in our mother country.</p>

<p>Now&hellip;you&rsquo;re in the position that you would like to vote in the UK election.  For a long time, BNP has been considered a quite a serious alternative, and voting BNP is the plan A.</p>
<p>Before coming to this decision, there has been plenty of visits to the BNP website; updated and informed.</p>
<p>Now, with only some days left to the election, the one top leader is arrested on suspicions of planning to murder another one. Now, thats quite a dent in the confidence of the party. The the web-site is obviously undergoing some kind of strain, and is no longer being updated. Suddenly, the day before the election and on election day, first one find the most ridiculous message on the website, for just after that, when the heat of the election is on, there is no web-site, just a plain letter from Nick Griffin.</p>
<p>No..what happened to the party.  Is it dead? Has it exploded or imploded? <br>
Conclusion: When throwing my vote into the ballot box, I also consider the degree of seriousness of the parties.  With this behaviour from the BNP, the confidence in the partys ability to administer and lead, just went down the drain. My vote: To Cameron </p>

		<p>Nick Griffen and the BNP are alive and well.  They did not win in Barking, no MP seats but they increased their votes in the GE by almost 300 % to well over 500,000.  They ran 338 MP candidates.  They have a good strong organization.  They can effectively raise money.  In their campaign this year they encountered fewer &#8220;screamers&#8221; jumping from behind corners or out of trash bins.  They were well received by most constituents. </p>
<p>They still have the No. 1 political web site in Britain.  They still have 2 MEP&rsquo;s elected.  Yes they lost some council seats. Margaret Hodge imported some 1000 left wing goons in Barking and that hurt the BNP.  </p>

		<p>  &#8220;I hate to inform everyone, but after watching the election results last night, then reading this article, I think I have for the first time, started to lose some hope in our people. I can&rsquo;t believe the people of the United Kingdom are this naive with political correctness.  <br>
The countries of the Anglosphere have turned into total jokes. Expect the Olympics opening ceremony in London in 2012 to be nothing but a celebration for diversity.  Meanwhile the East Asians beam with pride.&#8221;<br>

__   __   __   __   __   </p>
<p>Yes,  Courtney is right (I also hate to say it).  The Anglosphere countries are indeed pathetic jokes, now just pale reflexions of what they once were.   But ALL of the white countries are following like robots in their steps.  The British people especially, are totally, totally brainwashed with their dishonest, shameless, alien-controlled media;  and their servile, corrupt  politicians.</p>
<p>Btw, I am amazed to see Courtney complimenting Asians. But we must admit that there are some things that Asians seem to do better.  Looking out for themselves and  their own seems to be one of them.  Something we need to learn before it&rsquo;s too late!   Without a doubt she is also right that the Olympics in London with be nothing but a  lavish celebration of Diversity&hellip;the madness of our time. I wonder what the more-sensible Chinese must think of this grotesque spectacle of national and racial  suicide? A folly they have no intention of repeating.  But they at least control their own academia, politics, and media.</p>

<p>I watched CSPAN&rsquo;s simulcast of the BBC&rsquo;s coverage from its beginning until I finally could stay awake no longer on Thursday.  They did mention the BNP a few times:</p>
<p>* They showed Nick Griffin going in to watch the count in Barking.  The main anchor used the words &#8220;racist&#8221; and &#8220;ilk&#8221; numerous times while showing that.</p>
<p>* They interviewed Margaret &#8220;The Wicked Witch of East London&#8221; Hodge.  If &#8220;fascist&#8221; wasn&rsquo;t in the dictionary, she would have nothing to say.  She acted like she was up against Satan himself, all the while not mentioning Nick G or the BNP by name.  Ironically, she may have inadvertently given the BNP a lot of credibility in Barking a few years ago, by saying that she empathizes with the BNP&rsquo;s concerns.  I think her superiors within the Labour Party ordered her to go on the warpath against the BNP, or at least pretend to.</p>
<p>* With the final results from a few of the districts, they did mention how better or worse the BNP did from five years ago, in districts where the BNP did do well five years ago.</p>
<p>21 Paul Jones:</p>
<p>I noticed the &#8220;gift to gab&#8221; myself.  I counted seven different times when the main desk would turn it over to some reporter at a ballot counting room, or on that BBC-funded boat full of celebutards on the Thames (that costs the taxpayers a pretty penny, BTW), and the main anchor wanted to shift to something else, but the reporter kept on taking, and even when they shifted the screen image back to the main desk, I could hear the reporter or interviewee keep talking, as if he or she (both sexes were bad at this) was oblivious to the fact that the camera was no longer on him or her.  </p>
<p>As an aside, it&rsquo;s amazing that they have the first election in five years, yet no party is really happy.  The Tories picked up the most seats that they have an any election since 1931, yet they&rsquo;re not happy because it wasn&rsquo;t a majority.  Of course, they got so trounced in 1997, that even the 30-some seat pickup in 2005 and the 97 seat pickup this week wasn&rsquo;t enough to get them to the top of the mountain.  Labour isn&rsquo;t happy, because Tony Blair&rsquo;s &#8220;magic&#8221; has just been whiddled away.  The LDs aren&rsquo;t happy, because they lost ground in spite of Clegg&rsquo;s charisma.  The BNP isn&rsquo;t happy, because they got no seats and lost a lot of the municipal offices they had, in spite of their vote share in England almost quadrupling.  </p>
<p>American radio talk show host Mark Levin had the best line about David Cameron on his show last night:  &#8220;The reason [he] can so easily try to work out a deal with the Liberal Democrats is because he&rsquo;s damned near a Liberal Democrat.&#8221;  Translate Cameron to this side of the ocean, and he would be like an Olympia Snowe type.</p>

<p>Well, I am glad American Renaissance is starting to allow personal attacks pass for mature dialogue.  </p>
<p>In any case, my overall opinion of Asians has not changed in any way.  I have always thought they were much more healthier with their views on staying homogenous.  I just rightfully think that when it comes to other issues (like innovation) people on this website go a little overboard when complimenting Asians and I will continue to discuss that issue even if it irritates posters like you.    </p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t agree with some of the other stuff you mention in your post.  When I am speaking of our weaknesses as a people, I am not suddenly coming to the conclusion that there is suddenly a long list of weaknesses that our people have that makes us a bunch of losers compared to Asians.  I still firmly believe that there are many things we are superior in when compared to Asians, but racial pride isn&rsquo;t one of them. </p>
<p>I also don&rsquo;t agree that this &#8220;disease&#8221; that is spreading in the Anglosphere is really infecting whites in other places.  In many other places I am starting to see the reverse happening&hellip;even in France.  The only exception would be Scandinavia. </p>

		<p>I think these articles are misleading. The election was actually good news for the BNP, and for Britain, despite the loss of seats for the BNP.</p>
<p>First of all, the BNP increased their share of the popular vote in the general election from 0.7% to 1.9% (a record high), making them the fifth biggest party.</p>
<p>Moreover, the U.K. Independence Party,which is also anti-immigration, increased from 2.2% to 3.1% (also a record high), making them the fourth biggest party. </p>
<p>And since the Conservatives also want more restrictive immigration laws (though not as much as the UKIP, not to mention the BNP), their success increase the chance of more restrictive immigration laws.</p>
<p>And secondly, while the Liberal Democrats are awful on immigration (if anything, they are even worse than Labour), they want to change the electoral system to proportional representation. If they manage to push that through directly, or push through a referendum about it, in negotiations with the Conservatives, then the future for both the BNP and the UKIP looks a lot brighter. </p>

		<p>The BNP lost all twelve seats in Barking and Dagenham - how is that possible? Did all the whites who voted for them last time, leave? Of course not. Did all the whites who voted for them last time, suddenly change their minds, in spite of even MORE non-white immigrants coming into their borough? Of course not.<br>
The only explanation is massive postal vote fraud - on a grand scale.<br>
We are all being dragged down to third world status. The U.K. is becoming an immigrant worshipping hellhole, I can vouch for that. The worst thing is that most of the people I talk to act as if I am in the wrong for merely wanting to survive. They are too blind and bloody minded to even begin to look at the facts - that we will soon be an ethnic minority in our own country, and therefore have NO say whatsoever over our future.</p>
<p>The several comments above about the media&rsquo;s overwhelming influence are spot on: most people are simply braindead idiots who would literally rather die than question what the T.V. tells them. Soon enough they will be woken up by cold, hard reality. If only we whites who want our own homeland could leave NOW, and set up a country somewhere, and leave all the remaining idiots to their inevitable fate, there would be justice. As it is, we, the ones who can actually face reality, are being dragged to our deaths by the idiots all around us.</p>

		<p>The BNP is better off as a marginalized opposition party for the time being. Britain is heading for a cataclysmic financial meltdown similar to what&rsquo;s going on in Greece right now   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s inevitable   &mdash;   and whoever&rsquo;s in control when it happens is going to take the fall. Better that it happens with traditional British parties running things. That way they&rsquo;ll be totally discredited and the BNP might actually have a chance to pick up the pieces after it&rsquo;s all over, assuming there&rsquo;s anything left to pick up, that is. One way or another, the crash is inevitable and things are going to get very grim in the next few years.</p>
<p>Nationalists of all types, in my opinion, have got to get used to the idea that it&rsquo;s just too late to reverse the situation we find ourselves in. Even if the BNP got into power, there&rsquo;s nothing they could do to stop what&rsquo;s happening. The current crisis has been building up for decades and it&rsquo;s probably going to take several more generations for it to play out completely. Western civilization is heading into a new dark age and it could take a thousand years to emerge again.</p>

		<p>     &mdash;  #6  &mdash;   &#8220;I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;s not much room for optimism here. Without control of mass media, we cannot hope to make any gains in electoral politics.&#8221;<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
The problem is not that that we have to get &#8220;control of mass media&#8221;.  Rather, we have to get them OUT FROM UNDER hostile control.  Britain doesn&rsquo;t need a controlled media; it needs an uncontrolled media.  The  problem is that the mass media in Britain are already very controlled. Highly controlled! But by self-interested parties.  What Britain so desperately needs is a FREE media, which they do not have.</p>
<p>The extent of the hostile control over their mass media is glaringly revealed in the shameless partiality that the media have shown in their slanted, biased coverage of the BNP.  If Britain truly had a free, <b><i>un</i></b>-controlled and objective media that reports the news without bias, then none of their shameless tricks and slanted coverage would be happening.</p>

		<p>I think the results of the BNP speak for themselves.  A straightforward approach will not work&hellip;.no more than it would work for card carrying communists and supporters of Mao, Che and Stalin.</p>
<p>These people, despite extreme and widespread lack of respectability, wield considerable power because they are willing to infiltrate, mislead and take over institutions and then government, from the inside.</p>
<p>White Nationalists must copy their methods, do what they did, in order to gain power and then IMPOSE a white oriented agenda after enough power is gained.</p>
<p>That is simply the way it is done.  The way that works.  What does not work is rational arguments, pleas to one&rsquo;s own best self-interest, intellectual honesty, fairness and chivalry.</p>
<p>The vast majority of people are sheep.  They will believe what they are told to believe.  Support what they are told to support.  The trick is to position oneself to be able to tell them these things&hellip;..for example, by taking over popular media, or infiltrating school systems.  Running for local elections (and lying about our racial agenda).</p>

		<p>22) I agree completely.  No less than three PR nightmares right before the election?  Disgusting.</p>
<p>Though to be perfectly honest, the &#8220;street fight&#8221; incident made me have fits of hysterical laughter.  I doubt that Pakistani teenager will be spitting in the face of a BNP candidate(especially when said candidate is an ex-royal marine) ever again.</p>

		<p>Rigged elections anyone??<br>
The same thing happened in Detroit a number of years ago when ballots that were destined for (the few) predominantly white precincts were &#8220;misplaced&#8221;.  This resulted in true voter disenfranchisement, NOT the typical whining of the &#8220;majority&#8221; (black population) of the city of Detroit.  Of course, not much (if anything) became of it.</p>

		<p>I have additional remarks to make that not only co-sign on, but extrapolate what some posters have been saying.</p>
<p>There have been comments about Nick Griffith, being a bumbling, uncharismatic candidate.  In retrospect, I believe his prior victory in obtaining two seats in the EU elections was his undoing in the British elections.  Flush with success, he mistakenly believed he could take the BNP mainstream in Great Britain, so he became conciliatory waaay too early in the game.  He  should have ramped UP the rhetoric instead of toning it down right away.  Moreover, he really screwed the pooch when he rolled over and played dead when the courts said he must allow non-indigenous people into the party, which defeated its own purpose.  He should have had a fit and fought that tooth and nail, because accepting that ruling defeated his own purpose. </p>
<p>He should have never stopped portraying the Lib-Lab-Cons as the TRUE Axis of Evil for indigenous White Britons by flooding the country with hostile alien races that hated them and their whole way of life.  He should have been expecting fraud and been very vocal about it.  When the Big Hiccup came about with the ballot shortage and the lack of staffing and booths at the polling places, Griffith could have been in a key position to demand new elections to take place on a Saturday.</p>
<p>Would he have become Prime Minister?   With his record, NO.  Griffith&rsquo;s problem is that he wants to be king too much to recognize that a better position to be in is the kingmaker.  British Nationalism NEEDS a bad cop on the job and Griffith would have been the perfect candidate for the job if he had had the sense to realize it and gotten even more extreme and right wing in his rhetoric.  He should even go so far as proposing violent, bloody revolution to retake the country.  Hold capital treason trials where treacherous Lib-Lab-Con politicians can be hung in the public square.  Kinda like Malcolm X, if you will.  </p>
<p>The UKIP would have been the perfect &#8220;good cop&#8221; alternative with a few tweaks here and there.  Made SOME conciliatory statements bordering on the politically correct, about being willing to work with minorities who are willing to assimilate to the British way of doing and become law-abiding citizens who are Britons by choice.  But make it clear that their first priority are the indigenous Britons.  Kinda like MLK, if you will.</p>
<p>Last, British Nationalist who can fly in under the radar need to infiltrate the Lib-Lab-Cons and effect incremental change with the idea that they can hold power by co-opting British Nationalist ideas.</p>
