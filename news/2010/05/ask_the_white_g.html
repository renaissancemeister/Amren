<h1>Ask the White Guy: Is the Term &#8216;Illegal Immigrant&rsquo; Offensive?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Luke Visconti, Diversity Inc., May 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Comment:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tended to notice more people using undocumented, without papers, noncitizens, etc. Is it rude, racist to say illegal? I&rsquo;m also curious to know what exactly, or who exactly these illegal immigrants&rsquo; rights people are fighting for. {snip} But truly the most ironic thing about this whole issue is with all of this talk about &#8220;rights&#8221; there has been very little in regards to responsibility.</p>
<p>Ask the White Guy Response:</p>
<p>Regarding rights, please refer to the Declaration of Independence. It states that rights come from the creator; governments are formed by people to administer the protection of these rights. Further, the rights are &#8220;unalienable&#8221; and do not belong exclusively to people with certain documents or within a boundary. These rights are for all people. So, therefore, describing a human being as &#8220;illegal&#8221; should be offensive to any loyal American. It&rsquo;s more offensive than spitting on someone.</p>
<p>Further, there are an estimated 10 to 16 million undocumented people in this country. Do you think they&rsquo;re here by mistake? They&rsquo;re here because they were needed  &mdash;  and they were allowed to work here without restriction. Do you blame the undocumented, or do you blame the people responsible for the administration of our borders?</p>
<p>In 2006, Newt Gingrich wrote an article for National Review that contained this sentence: &#8220;In 2004, there were zero (0) federal enforcement fines imposed on American employers who were breaking the law by hiring people illegally.&#8221; What Newt doesn&rsquo;t catch is that this is evidence of a conspiracy. People who are here without documents don&rsquo;t have Social Security numbers  &mdash;  they use fake cards or other people&rsquo;s numbers. That means that the federal government collected billions of dollars in Social Security taxes without a corresponding expectation to pay benefits. {snip} So I agree with you about not hearing enough about &#8220;responsibility,&#8221; but it&rsquo;s not the kind of responsibility you&rsquo;re thinking of.</p>
<p>Follow-up Comment:</p>
<p>{snip} You stated that &#8220;these people are here because they were needed,&#8221; etc. and &#8220;What Newt didn&rsquo;t catch is that this is evidence of a conspiracy.&#8221; OK, so be it, maybe it was. Uh, let&rsquo;s try to fix that, maybe by enforcing our own immigration laws? But really, do you think that ALL of the &#8216;Undocumented Workers&#8221; paid into Social Security? What it comes down to is that the U.S. has laws, protocol if you will, for people who want to have the same benefits as a U.S. citizen. These people are breaking our own law, and AZ is trying to enforce it. {snip} If a person deserves to get stopped for a traffic violation, and that person doesn&rsquo;t have a driver&rsquo;s license or insurance, or if there is any reasonable suspicion, the officer can inquire about that person&rsquo;s legal status. The officers are being trained, they have consequences if they get out of line. {snip} Racial profiling?? Get a grip people. According to the &rsquo;09 Census, 30 percent of AZ&rsquo;s population is Hispanic. These Hispanics are U.S. Citizens or documented, &#8220;going through our system.&#8221; Do you realize the police force it would take to stop somebody and question them if they were &#8220;racial profiling.&#8221; They don&rsquo;t have the time or the resources. {snip}</p>
<p>Ask the White Guy Response:</p>
<p>{snip} The situation speaks for itself; the fences are not for Americans trying desperately to work in Mexico. I completely agree with you about people emigrating here legally. The problem is the current system is dysfunctional  &mdash;  and we have human beings here who need to be treated like human beings (because that&rsquo;s what our founding documents demand of us). I am not comfortable with police arbitrating constitutional rights.</p>
<p>On your other point: Let&rsquo;s say half of the undocumented people working in this country pay into Social Security  &mdash;  they ALL pay sales tax. It amounts to billions of dollars collected .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. quite a racket. {snip}</p>
<p>This law absolutely promotes racial profiling. They&rsquo;re not concerned about Polish undocumented workers in Arizona. This is all about Mexicans. {snip}</p>

I prefer the term &#8216;criminal alien&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And if there were 12-20 million criminal alien Polish in my country demanding I speak Polish and create special programs for them because, although they came here voluntarily and of their own will, they claim I&rsquo;m oppressing them, then I would support a law to have these Poles removed.<br>

<p>&#8220;Ask the White Guy: Is the Term &lsquo;Illegal Immigrant&rsquo; Offensive?&#8221;</p>
<p>YES! They&rsquo;re illegal ALIENS - calling them immigrants suggests that they did something more than hop a fence; while better than the ludicrous &#8220;undocumented immigrant,&#8221; which makes it sound as though the DHS simply failed to offer them papers when they showed up at the office, I refuse to compromise.</p>
<p>As I read somewhere else and paraphrased, &#8220;you don&rsquo;t call shoplifting `illegal purchase,` because it&rsquo;s not a purchase at all&hellip;&#8221;</p>

		<p>We allowed them to enter for employment hah. It is amazing the lengths they will go to make excuses for us to continue to be flooded. On the radio, immediately after hearing news about 10% unemployment in the U.S. John Gibson had the guts to agree with his hispanic guest that we need laws that allow immigrants to flood this country because of economics. That proves that it is racial. They say we just need laws that are economically viable, but when we have 10% unemployment, they still say we need more workers. As always God help us. </p>

		<p>Duh, that&rsquo;s because there probably aren&rsquo;t any Polish illegals in Arizona.</p>
<p>The Declaration of Independence is a nice document.  But it is not germane to the operation of the American Federal government.  And, when Thomas Jefferson was working through draft after draft of the DoI, I highly doubt he was thinking about Mestizos.</p>

		<p>I haven&rsquo;t bothered to try and count them but it is my understanding that there are almost seven billion people on this planet. </p>
<p>I think we can all agree that humans have certain rights that are protected by laws. I don&rsquo;t think that any country can afford to open up the gates and allow all seven billion people that now live on this planet to invade. If we can&rsquo;t allow all the people on the planet to invade there must be a way to determine just who and how many people are allowed to enter any country. These are called immigration laws and any person breaking these laws is committing an illegal act. </p>
<p>By my logic I&rsquo;m sure the word &#8220;illegal&#8221; applies but I&rsquo;m not sure immigrant does. Since there are 10-15 million of them I think that invasion would be more appropriate than immigration. So I agree that illegal immigrant is not correct. Illegal invader should be used. </p>
<p>Sure there are some Americans that welcome this invasion but there were some Frenchmen that welcomed the Germans in world war two. There will be many that go over to the side of the Martians if they ever land. Every group has it&rsquo;s traitors . </p>

<p>So what?  Anti White Affirmative Action policies &#8220;racially profile&#8221; me for my Whiteness and prevent me from being given first consideration based on my experience and merits. I am &#8220;racially profiled&#8221; into a second class citizenship in my own White Republic.  If you are a member of the White American Tribe, you are discriminated against through Affirmative Action &#8220;racial profiling.&#8221;   </p>
<p>The White Founders of this White Republic did not give the blacks, browns, red, yellows, or White Women, the vote, and they barred them from the franchise for a specific reason: they knew what would happen to us if the minorities ever get power.  It happened.   Our degradation and dispassion prove the rightness our White Founders.</p>
<p>Something went wrong along the way, and we are paying the price.</p>
<p>For how much longer will we?</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Regarding rights, please refer to the Declaration of Independence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If I am not mistaken, the Declaration of Independence is not a legal document; it is instead, a formal statement to the British Empire and its king defining exactly why the subjects in the Thirteen Colonies, had decided to seek their independence and form a country of their own. In short, it could be seen as declaring all representatives and enforcers of British rule in these colonies, as now being either illegal occupiers or unwelcome invaders. Thus, not the best argument in trying to hold that, &ldquo;describing a human being as &lsquo;illegal&rsquo; should be offensive to any loyal American.</p>
<p>In other words, it sounds more like the twisted justifications of a Benedict Arnold, rather than the patriotic zeal of a George Washington!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!</p>

<p>Yeah, and we also have a little thing called &#8220;citizenship&#8221;, which is not conferred on everybody or anybody in the world. It&rsquo;s an exclusive club of people in any particular country who either were blessed (or cursed) by it by birth or given it, hopefully by some merit on their part. It has its burdens as well as its benefits. It isn&rsquo;t free, and it isn&rsquo;t universal. Sorry.</p>
<p>What do these people think, that we can give US citizen rights (with few or no responsibilities, of course) to everyone in the world? The thinking is bizzare. What do they want, a one-world goverment, with everyone on earth being US citizens?  Maybe so&hellip;</p>

By the way, &#8220;undocumented&#8221; is a synonym for &#8220;illegal&#8221;, Mr. White Guy.  Try pleading &#8220;no document&#8221; the next time you are asked to show your driver&rsquo;s license.</p>

<p>The response to this is simple: the Declaration of Independence speaks about the rights of &#8220;life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.&#8221; It doesn&rsquo;t say anything about the right of non-citizens to live anywhere they choose. Mexicans are free to pursue happiness in Mexico.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because most of the illegals aren&rsquo;t white polish people.  I&rsquo;ve been around Polish immigrants here in the US.  Unlike the Mestizos, they aren&rsquo;t invading our country, they are learning to speak English, they are hardworking, they are nice, and the women are pretty as hell.  Oh, and they don&rsquo;t anchor babies and tell me I&rsquo;m a Gringo and that I should violently be expelled from the Southwest either.</p>
<p>Seriously, what is this &#8216;white guy&rsquo;?  An ignorant 18-year-old studying Marxism and mulitculturalism?  There&rsquo;s no way an intelligent man of any race living in the border states, seeing what the illegals do, and having to foot the bill for any of that would be as much of a bleeding heart as this &#8220;white guy&#8221; is.</p>

<p>Within fifteen years of the composition of the Declaration [1790], the same founding generation of Americans who propagated the Declaration composed the nation&rsquo;s first federal immigration law, which limited immigration to the United States to &#8220;free white persons.&#8221;<br>
Immigration is therefore not a &#8220;right&#8221; of any non-citizen, nor is there a &#8220;right&#8221; to immigrate in violation of the law. </p>
<p>Of course John P.M. is correct; the Declaration is not a legal document and has no real legal authority whatsoever, the claims of Lincoln  and other jacobins notwithstanding.</p>

<p>In this context, ironically, it was Benedict Arnold who was the patriot and the signees of the DoI that were the terorists. The U.S. was NOT founded on freedom, nor IN freedom, it was founded in insurrection, violence, bloodshed and civil disobedience to the lawful king and crown&hellip;lots of people seem to forget that the DoI was a statement that was bound to bring the British down on the colonies&hellip;.Do we for a a minute, think that, Arizona for example would be allowed to seceed from the U.S. without the full weight of the U.S. military and law enforcement being brought to  bear? Violence WOULD ensue. There is, and never will be, any such thing as a peaceful secession or revolution and violence is inevitable.</p>

<p>You can also be a LEGAL alien&hellip;that&rsquo;s exactly what I was when I traveled LEGALLY to Europe.  I had no intention of applying for citizenship.  I was only on vacation. </p>

     legal alien<br>
     illegal ALIEN</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t usually agree with these spineless leftists, but I do find the term &#8216;illegal immigrant&rsquo; offensive.</p>
<p>The term implies that these illegals merely intend to <i>immigrate</i> to this country and by implication integrate into our society. In reality, few   &mdash;   if any   &mdash;   intend to integrate and illegally crossing the border makes a farce of legal immigration. For this reason, I prefer the more neutral term &#8216;illegal alien.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>Silly goose! Tourists and international students pay sales tax too, but that does not enable them to claim any right to remain in this country&hellip;..nor is it a racket. Any retail purchase subject to sales tax is collected. It does not imply anything.</p>
<p>The same goes for property taxes. If you live in France and you own a home in Malibu, you will pay property taxes on that house. It is not a racket&hellip;.even if you have no kids in public schools, even if you never call for police protection, even if you never use the local library. Property taxes are due and payable on property subject to local property taxes.</p>
<p>Right now, I am in Germany and I pay the value added tax (VAT) anytime I buy something. It is twice as high as any sales tax in the USA, but paying that tax just means that I shopped in Germany. It does not make me a German citizen. It does not give me to right to remain in Germany. I cannot vote in German elections. And I definitely would not use that as an excuse to march through the streets of any Germany city, waving an American flag. </p>

		<p>The term &#8216;Illegal Immigrant&rsquo; is obviously flawed, the correct term is invader.  Let&rsquo;s call them invaders from now on. In reality all non-White immigrants either legal or illegal are invaders and are invading on land which should rightfully belong to the children of White people. </p>

		<p>sbuffalonative; you have a very good idea.  They are CRIMINAL ALIENS. An immigrant tends to infer some legality, but being in the USA or anywhere under such circumstances means they are automatically a criminal.  All should refer to such people as such when talking or writing letters to the Press, etc</p>

		<p>Increasingly we experience the forced politicialization of the language from a universally understood descriptive to a watered-down construct meant to lessen the offense and discern what side the speaker is on.  <br>
For example, imagine I am carrying a concealed weapon, without the necessary permits.  Should that be called carrying an illegal concealed weapon or an undocumented weapon?  Should one be criminally prosecuted and the other a misdemeanor? <br>
Illegal alien is a succint descriptor. Undocumented person sounds like they merely forgot to bring their papers. Sorry officer, but I left my driver&rsquo;s license in my other pants doesn&rsquo;t work for traffic violations, why does it work for illegal aliens?  </p>

		<p>A trespassing home invader is not an illegal member of the household.  </p>
<p>The term &ldquo;illegal immigrant&rsquo; is a misnomer, because an immigrant is someone who immigrates lawfully.  </p>
<p>One who enters the country illegally is a foreign invader, infiltrator and fifth column domestic enemy. </p>
<p>The term &#8220;illegal immigrant&#8221; is indeed offensive, as is every communist conceived politically correct term that recently found its way into our language much to our dismay and outrage&hellip;</p>

		<p>The incessant illegals&rsquo; whining, &#8220;No human is illegal&#8221; can be answered by asking, &#8220;Then why are &#8216;undocumented&rsquo; people in Mexico considered illegal, and therefore criminals and arrested. I love the way they pick and choose which laws they desire to abide by.</p>

		<p>As a White Man, I emphatically do not find the term, &#8220;illegal immigrant&#8221; in the least offensive. It is simply two words providing a 100% accurate verbal description of probably 25 to 30 MILLION people in our country!</p>
<p>If you are an illegal immigrant, you deserve to be arrested, deprived of the right to claim Constitutional protection and be deported IMMEDIATELY without due process or trial! You are an illegal immigrant and thus do not deserve any of our legal rights and protection afforded us by the Constitution!</p>

<p>Luke Visconti (this article&rsquo;s author) is a middle aged American male apparently of Italian extraction. He was the co-founder of the race-husstling enterprise which put published this idiotic article. He is the one who directs all editorial operations of Diversity inc&rsquo;s website and magazine. He is nothing more than a foolish and suicidal white liberal; it is because of whites like him this country and the entire western world is now in a state of decline. <br>

		<p>&#8220;These rights are for all people.&#8221;</p>
<p>But in America, they only apply to Americna citizens, as I understand.</p>
<p>&#8220;This law absolutely promotes racial profiling. They&rsquo;re not concerned about Polish undocumented workers in Arizona. This is all about Mexicans. {snip}&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh yeah, because there&rsquo;s SOOO many illegal Polish immigrants in Arizona&hellip; wake up idiot. I&rsquo;m guessing &gt;95% of illegal immigrants in Arizona are Mexicans.</p>
