<h1>Sugar Land Church Leader: &#8216;Am I Too White to Be Your Pastor?&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Courtney Zubowski, KHOU-TV (Houston), May 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the question Pastor Patrick Kelley of River Pointe Community Church in Fort Bend County is asking in a bold new ad campaign.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kelley said he wants to diversify what he calls the most segregated hour of the week: Sunday morning church services. He said, right now, 65 percent of the members of his church, located in the 5000 block of Ransom Road, are white.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So far he said the feedback has been good, but no one has answered &#8216;yes&rsquo; to his question.</p>
<p>&#8220;My real hope was people would tell me you are too white to be my pastor and here&rsquo;s why,&#8221; said the pastor.</p>
<p>Kelley said he would take that information and incorporate it into his church to attract people of different racial backgrounds. He&rsquo;s going back out on Friday with his sign in hand.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, River Pointe High School Pastor Terrace Clayton, who is African-American, says he will be carrying a sign of his own, but he&rsquo;ll be posing a different question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I the wrong color to be your pastor?&#8221; said Clayton. &#8220;I think it&rsquo;s a sign that makes you think, and it&rsquo;s a question that makes you go, &#8216;Well, would I go to a white church or would I go to an all black church.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>

		<p>Church is largely a celebration of community for most attendees, and as such, the pastor and fellow attendees can indeed be considered &#8220;the wrong color&#8221;.</p>

<p>That means 35% are are a different race, which makes it far more integrated than most churches, so what is he complaining about?</p>
<p>More white guilt to wallow in, I guess.</p>

		<p> No abasement is too humiliating, no kowtowing too low, for the self-hating White liberal. So the pastor&rsquo;s church is 65 percent White? So what?! That&rsquo;s about our percentage of the general population in the diluted, watered-down state we&rsquo;ve arrived at in 2010, with a plunging White birth rate and surging numbers of illegal, non-White or mixed-race immigrants.</p>
<p> If churches tend to be segregated according to race, it&rsquo;s because most of the people in them of WHATEVER race, prefer it that way. The church hierarchies should be worrying a lot more about the state of our souls, and a lot less about the color of our skins.</p>

		<p>Its true. I go to church every week, but drift from church to church. And I can definately say that, even here in one of America&rsquo;s most diverse cities, most churches are extremely segregated (by natural choice, of course). The only one&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve been to, ever, that were&rsquo;t, would be the two Catholic churches in the Killeen, TX area (one of them is an Asian church which also has alot of white members; the other is extremely diverse with different-colored people everywhere you look), and an evangelical church (which I couldn&rsquo;t stand, by the way) in Lawton, OK. In the First Baptist of Killeen, a massive church with filled pews, there can&rsquo;t be more than maybe 30 or so non-whites. And in the Methodist Church, there&rsquo;s about seventy people every week per service, and no more than five minorities. The Presbyterian has about thirty people, and only one blakc family that comes only occasionally. So yeah, churches tend to be a place where people segregate themselves. Another place where segregation naturally occures? A chain of restaurants called Jason&rsquo;s Deli. I once walked in there and, out of over a hundred people, there only one Hispanic and no other minorities. Not counting the employees, of course.</p>

		<p>Perhaps he&rsquo;d feel differently if his wife decided to &#8216;diversify&rsquo; her bedroom arrangements. Actually, isn&rsquo;t a lot of that going on already in Texas? Must not be enough for Patrick Kelley, proving some folks are too dumb to learn in the first place. </p>

		<p>This is exactly why White Christians of today are so dumbed down and believe that &#8220;do not commit racism&#8221; is in the Ten Commandments! With pastors like this no wonder the Church is dying. EVERYTHING they preach is for the NONwhites and helping the NONwhites throughout the whole world. Another take Whitey&rsquo;s money (tithes) and give it to those who will destroy Whitey. I would never set foot in any of these churches of today, much less donate a dime so they can do their dirty work against us.</p>

		<p>The very idea of &#8220;too white&#8221; is offensive.   There is no such thing!   The use of such rhetoric even among the very people it is meant to attack just shows how many steps we&rsquo;ve taken toward the chopping block.  <br>

		<p>WR the elder thinks Obama is too black to be our president, and Bill Clinton was too.  Can there be a better example of a self-hating nihilistic white liberal than Slick Willie, who cannot restrain his enthusiasm for the time to come when America becomes a minority-majority liberal utopia?</p>

		<p>Anonymous writer #4 mentions extremely diverse churches in Killeen, Texas and Lawton, Oklahoma. The fact that both of those towns are next to large Army posts (Ft. Hood and Ft. Sill respectively) likely has a lot to do with the overabundance on minorities.</p>

		<p>Christianity, at least as it&rsquo;s practiced within the mainstream, and with it&rsquo;s emphasis on inclusiveness is a major impediment to rational white centered thinking.</p>
<p>So, Christianity suffers from the same politically correct insanity as the rest of &#8220;respectable&#8221; society.</p>
<p>Mainstream Christian churches have been poisoned as have, the schools, big business, TV, movies, music, nonprofits, etc., etc. They are one of the many targets of our enemies.  They do perpetuate and spread the sickness, as do these other infected institutions, but they are not the cause.</p>

<p>Actually, the same can be said for some White Pentecostal churches. I grew up in south Alabama and you had people literally rolling in the aisles in church, screaming, shouting etc&hellip;</p>
<p>Even more interesting wss I went to a non-denominational church in Colorado Springs in late 2008. I was visitng a relative. It was a church of predominately young professionals, mostly late 20s/early 30s. I only saw one Black person. She looked late 20ish/early 30ish. She was attractive and well dressed like everyone in the congreagation.</p>
<p>Clean cut looking men and attractive women in designer suits, and dresses were yelling, screaming, etc&hellip; I was surprised. Although I will admit that the service had a more secular feeling to it. Contempary christian music was played. The band was young.</p>
<p>These sort of worship services transcend racial lines.</p>
