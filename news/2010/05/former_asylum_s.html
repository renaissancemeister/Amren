Then Slams Immigrants Who Refuse to Integrate Into British Society</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Tozer, Daily Mail (London), May 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>HE arrived in Britain as a penniless asylum seeker with only a small bag of possessions to his name.</p>
<p>But more than 30 years after fleeing Communist-run Hungary, Gabor Bartos has been given the honour of being named mayor of his adopted home village.</p>
<p>And yesterday the 59-year-old said his story was a lesson to more recent immigrants on how to integrate themselves into British society.</p>
<p>&#8216;It&rsquo;s only right that outsiders should respect the cultures of the countries they want to live in,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&#8216;When I came to England, I had to learn to speak English and had to drive on the other side of the road from the rest of Europe, and I had to adopt traditions and I&rsquo;m proud of that because that is what made me a British citizen.</p>
<p>&#8216;That gave me a loyalty to this country. I just wish all other asylum seekers would follow the same trait. Some of the people coming to this great country won&rsquo;t integrate, and it really makes me angry.</p>
<p>&#8216;It&rsquo;s very sad that the old saying &#8220;When in Rome do as the Romans&#8221; is much maligned and ignored these days.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Bartos grew up in Erd, south of Budapest, the son of a flower seller, but his burgeoning interest in Western pop culture after first hearing The Beatles saw him rebel against the repressive Communist regime.</p>
<p>Branded a dissident, he joined football fans travelling to London to watch Hungary play England in 1978, and after giving their secret police minders the slip he defected, claiming political asylum at the Home Office.</p>
<p>That was granted six years later, and despite the fall of Communism in 1989 Mr Bartos has made his life here, marrying a British woman, working as a piano tuner and being elected a local Conservative councillor.</p>
<p>Last week he was chosen as Mayor of his village, Poynton in Cheshire, which is now twinned with the town of his birth.</p>
<p>Yesterday he told of his gratitude for how his adopted country had given him shelter from persecution.</p>
<p>&#8216;We wanted to play music and we couldn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&#8216;We couldn&rsquo;t do the things that other teenagers were naturally doing on the other side of the Iron Curtain.</p>
<p>&#8216;We just wanted to have our long hair  &mdash;  I was beaten up many times by the police for having long hair, we were seen to be an enemy of the system.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He told no-one of his plan to defect, packing only a small bag to avoid raising suspicion.</p>
<p>He was later sentenced to jail in his absence and was unable to visit relatives until the regime collapsed.</p>
<p>&#8216;I didn&rsquo;t tell anybody what I was planning  &mdash;  I couldn&rsquo;t even tell my mum. It was a hard decision at the time,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&#8216;I was frightened of the secret service, that they might follow me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Learning English and building a career tuning pianos for the BBC and a Manchester theatre he was determined to make the most of his new opportunity, however, earning enough to buy a small flat.</p>
<p>&#8216;When I got British citizenship in 1984 I felt like the proudest man in the world, really  &mdash;  because at last a great country like the UK was giving me the opportunity to be a citizen.</p>
<p>&#8216;Although when I went to the Home Office, the lady joked that now I was British, I had to support England at football. I told her I would!&rsquo;</p>
<p>When it was eventually safe to return to Hungary he paid an emotional visit to relatives, discovering that an old schoolfriend was now mayor of Erd, and they arranged for it to be twinned with Poynton.</p>
<p>But the father-of-two  &mdash;  whose wife Jennifer works as a financial director  &mdash;  was now settled in England, and yesterday he spoke of his pride at being chosen as mayor.</p>
<p>&#8216;I&rsquo;m absolutely humbled to get this position. I came to this country as an outsider and this job is the very least I can do after the UK made me a citizen.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>Bartos&rsquo; attitude toward his adoptive nation would have made perfect sense (and be considered rather unremarkable)  to the millions of European immigrants who arrived here in the late 19th and early 20th Century. Though a few did return to their original homes, the great majority stayed and became committed American citizens in the first generation and almost certainly by the second.  To be sure, many of them continued to revere and respect some of the customs of the old country, but were no less loyal Aemrican citizens for that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rather disquieting that this Hungarian immigrant to the UK is considered noteworthy in his loyalty to his adoptive land.</p>

		<p>  The Mexicans could take a few cues from this gentleman.  But I guess their attitudes can be expected when something is given instead of earned.  I&rsquo;m Scot/Irish by heritage, but myself and my kin are Americans.  My Ancestors were proud to become American Citizens.  You didn&rsquo;t see them screaming to keep the Gaelic language.  They learned American English, Swore allegiance to our Country, and felt blessed they were freed from British rule and the meager existence they had as either tenant farmers or soldiers for the Crown.</p>
<p> I don&rsquo;t care how loud an Immigrant screams about our way of life.  They are blessed to be free from whence they came from and should act accordingly.  If they don&rsquo;t like the policies of the U.S. they can feel free to avoid the door hitting them as they leave!   </p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s the difference between European immigrants and non-European immigrants.  European immigrants have always been keen to integrate, and non-European immigrants have proven to been overwhelmingly stubborn in accepting integration.  One of the many reasons as to why we can&rsquo;t allow the present immigrant makeup to continue.</p>

		<p>Sounds like this gentleman has the right idea&hellip; that immigrants need to get off the insanity of clinging to their old lifestyle and assimilate into their new environment in every sense of the word. But that wouldn&rsquo;t make sense I guess. I mean it would spell the end of much of that crime and violence plaguing England&hellip; brought there by its Black immigrants.</p>

		<p>It undoubtedly helps that Magyars are white, European, and Christian who have a substantial distaste for marxism.</p>

		<p>Fellow Amrenners, before you get all excited about Hungarian immigrants being in love with their adopted countries, may I remind you of George Soros, the Hungarian immigrant, and billionaire; who emigrated to the USA, but despises us, and is leading the international gun control movement. He wants to put in place in the USA, the kind of regime he fled in Hungary. He donated millions of dollars to Obama&rsquo;s campaign through various front organizations.</p>

		<p>This man is absolutely right, and I commend him for learning British customs, culture and to speak English. My father has done the same thing, and immigrants who do what both have done leave a nation a better place than when they found it. Unlike Hispanics and Muslims, they didn&rsquo;t come as invaders seeking to push out the people already there, they wanted to join them. </p>

		<p>So, if you enter the country with the right attitude, those nasty, racist, white, xenophobic Brits will accept you and even vote for you.</p>
<p>Walk around with a bag over your head, whine, throw insults around, live on welfare and blow up their buses, and they won&rsquo;t.</p>
