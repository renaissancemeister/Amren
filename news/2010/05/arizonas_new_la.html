<h1>Arizona&rsquo;s New Law: Who&rsquo;s Calling Whom &#8220;Racist&#8221;?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jared Taylor, <font color="red">Special to AR News,</font> May 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The current whooping about Arizona&rsquo;s new immigration law is the clearest possible proof that virtually every Hispanic organization and elected official believes the United States has no right to enforce immigration law if that means keeping out Hispanics. Enforcing the law would outrage their deep sense of racial loyalty, so the law must be ignored, subverted, and denounced, but certainly not enforced. Racial solidarity comes before the law; the law doesn&rsquo;t even come close.</p>
<p>The irony is that although it is Hispanics who have worked themselves into a frenzy of race loyalty, it is they who accuse their opponents of &#8220;racism.&#8221; The Arizona law ignores race, of course; it only criminalizes actions. But welcome to what is now considered normal: Anyone who thinks the United States has a say in whom it may admit into its territory is called a racist by people who are obsessed with race.</p>
<p>As many people have pointed out, the new law does not &#8220;regulate immigration;&#8221; it merely adds state penalties for what are already federal crimes. It means the state of Arizona can actually do something about the estimated 500,000 illegal aliens the feds have let sneak into their state. This is called &#8220;concurrent enforcement&#8221; and happens all the time: There are both state and federal crimes against drug dealing, human trafficking, kidnapping, and a host of other things.</p>
<p>Hispanics refuse to see it that way. The possibility that even just one state out of 50 might throw up an obstacle to their demographic takeover has them howling about  &#8220;racism&#8221; and &#8220;racial profiling.&#8221; The National Council of La Raza says the Arizona law reflects &#8220;the rhetoric of hate groups, nativists, and vigilantes,&#8221; and &#8220;encourages  &mdash;  in no uncertain terms  &mdash;  racial profiling.&#8221; MALDEF (the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund) says the law &#8220;launches Arizona into a spiral of pervasive fear,&#8221; and &#8220;is an open invitation to racial discrimination.&#8221; Dolores Huerta, that ancient farm-worker agitator, says, &#8220;What we are witnessing today is the blatant targeting of an entire American population, Latinos.&#8221; The Educational Fund of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials says Arizona&rsquo;s new law will have &#8220;disastrous consequences for Arizona,&#8221; and will &#8220;subject Arizona&rsquo;s Latinos and newcomers to discrimination.&#8221; The president of LULAC (League of United Latin American Citizens), Rosa Rosales, says it is a &#8220;racist law.&#8221; The Congressional Hispanic Caucus official says it will &#8220;open the door to discrimination and racial profiling.&#8221;</p>
<p>MEChA, which is the group that wants to kick whites out of the Southwest and establish the &#8220;bronze continent&#8221; of Aztlan, was a little more creative. It said the law &#8220;is indistinguishable from the Jim Crow laws of the 19th and early 20th century&#8221; and &#8220;will legalize state violence and harassment in communities of color.&#8221; Someone with a sense of humor smeared refried beans in the shape of swastikas on the Arizona state capitol&rsquo;s windows. And Emilio Almodovar of Phoenix, who is said to be 13 years old and an American citizen, shows how love for America takes root early in the hearts of the young. &#8220;We can&rsquo;t walk to school any more,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We can&rsquo;t be in the streets anymore without the pigs thinking we&rsquo;re illegal immigrants.&#8221; Note the word &#8220;pigs,&#8221; not &#8220;police.&#8221;</p>
<p>All of this, of course, is an open admission of what everyone knows: that the overwhelming majority of those 500,000 illegals  &mdash;  95 percent? 98 percent?  &mdash;  are Hispanic. If the Arizona police start enforcing the law, the people being turned over to the feds will not be black or white.</p>
<p>All this bellyaching is therefore the most transparent, shameless race-based special pleading. Hispanics want to ignore the law because most of the law-breakers are Hispanic, and they want the country to become as Hispanic as possible. They have some nerve calling the Arizona legislature racist. If most illegals were Poles or Germans, Hispanics would be happy with the law, but because most border hoppers are fellow members of <i>la raza,</i> it&rsquo;s the law that is &#8220;racist,&#8221; not them.</p>
<p>What we have here is the old, old story of non-whites calling any rule they can&rsquo;t follow &#8220;racist.&#8221; Are more blacks than whites barred from voting when felons are disfranchised? The rules are racist. Do blacks and Hispanics fail the promotion exam for police sergeant? The exam is racist. Do blacks and Hispanics violate the University of Virginia honor code more often than whites? The honor code is racist. Do they get expelled from school more often? Teachers are racist. Do they have low IQs? The tests are racist. Are Hispanics most likely to be deported if the law is enforced? The law is racist.</p>
<p>This is how a country that was part of Western Civilization becomes detached from its moorings. When enough people show up for whom the old standards are alien  &mdash;  for whom the country itself is alien  &mdash;  all that can be swept aside. Hispanics are just 15 percent of the population. Imagine how they will behave if they get their way and become 25 or 40 percent or more.</p>
<p>Their pals south of the border are howling just as loudly. &#8220;Police in Arizona already treat migrants worse than animals,&#8221; says Francisco Loureiro, who runs a flophouse for border hoppers in Nogales, Mexico. &#8220;Now it will be open season under the cover of a law.&#8221; The mayor of Mexico City, Marcelo Ebrard, said he would join efforts to overturn Arizona&rsquo;s law, stating that it is &#8220;apartheid against Mexicans.&#8221; Guatemala&rsquo;s Foreign Relations Department said the law &#8220;threatens basic notions of justice.&#8221;</p>
<p>That about sums it up. If Americans try to control their borders  &mdash;  in ways that are far milder than those practiced by Mexico and Guatemala  &mdash;  this is &#8220;apartheid&#8221; and a &#8220;threat to justice.&#8221; Why not just be honest and say that Americans  &mdash;  at least whites Americans  &mdash;  have no say over who lives in their country, and that any Mexican or Guatemalan has the right to come any time and enjoy the rights of citizens?</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t American Hispanics be honest and say the same thing, too? Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa of Los Angeles, who has never repudiated anything from his MEChA days, says he wants the city to boycott Arizona. He was joined in this by two city council members, Jose Huizar and Ed Reyes. Even one of Arizona&rsquo;s own congressmen, Democrat Raul Grijalva supports a boycott  &mdash;  <em>of his own state.</em> Anything that keeps Hispanics from flooding the state is &#8220;racist&#8221; and must be stopped at all costs.</p>
<p>The white politicians of Arizona are, of course, whimpering and apologizing and promising there will be no &#8220;racial profiling.&#8221; I&rsquo;d like know why not. The illegal problem is a Hispanic problem and everyone knows it. Many news stories about the law quoted illegals who were worried about being deported. How did the reporters find these people? They used racial profiling, of course, but the police are supposed think old white ladies are just as likely to be border hoppers as young Mexicans?</p>
<p>Welcome to 21st century America, where it is &#8220;racism&#8221; to control the border but not for Hispanics to help other Hispanics break the law, where it is &#8220;racism&#8221; for Americans to care about who might be here illegally, but not for Mexicans to want to fill the country up with people exactly like themselves. Hispanics are doing themselves no favors with their naked chauvinism. Even if our &#8220;leaders&#8221; don&rsquo;t understand what is going on, ordinary voters do, and come election time, they will be in a mood to teach some lessons.</p>

		<p>Dolores Huerta&rsquo;s complaints are ironic.  For she prides herself on working very closely with Cesar Chavez, and Chavez was vehemently against illegal immigration, mainly because it was being used to bust unionization efforts of farm workers.  AMAF, Chavez, Walter Mondale and a black civil rights leader (I think it was Ralph Abernathy) jointly participated in a rally against illegal immigration very near the Mexican border in about 1969.</p>

		<p> Jared Taylor hits the nail right on the head, as usual. As he says, there is a huge amount of Hispanic hypocrisy involved in all these overheated blasts of &#8220;outrage&#8221; over the Arizona law. Mexicans are taught in their schools that the U.S. &#8220;stole&#8221; the Southwest from Mexico, and that it should be so flooded with (illegal) Mexican immigrants that it can be &#8220;taken back.&#8221; A &#8220;reconquista,&#8221; I believe they call it.</p>
<p> And pathetic indeed are the Whites, many of them starry-eyed &#8220;idealistic&#8221; college students, who have marched and chanted against the new Arizona law. They are typical of White ultra liberals, who preach &#8220;justice&#8221; and &#8220;equality&#8221; but who in actuality hate their own race and want to see it obliterated.</p>
<p> For those who would care to go to my website, www.oldcorporal.com, you can read a couple of recent columns I&rsquo;ve written about the Arizona immigrant law and the Left&rsquo;s reaction to it. </p>

		<p>I absolutely agree.  If us border states started putting up ads to BOYCOTT MEXICO, the loss of those turista dolares would set up a panic south of the border, and they&rsquo;d be a lot more likely to shut up about our enforcement of laws that were already on the books at the federal level in the U.S.  So, hey, Americanos, forget the vacacion in Guadalajara, Cabo, Acapulco, etc. etc.  This year try going to a U.S. National Park like Yosemite or Grand Tetons.  Keep our money in our own country where we need it now more than ever!!!</p>

		<p>In Russia the government requires all persons to carry identification and checks persons in major cities frequently to identify illegal aliens.  Unlike the AZ law, there is no burden of proof requirement like &#8220;reasonable suspicion.&#8221;  If you look foreign (non-white) you will be stopped frequently and asked for your papers.  </p>
<p>Surprisingly, being stopped doesn&rsquo;t seem to bother the non-white citizens of Russia.  But in my opinion white Russians have a greater sense of racial pride and wouldn&rsquo;t be insulted by shouts of racism over a completely logical response to the problem of illegal aliens.</p>

		<p>25% of the hispanic population is illegally residing in the US.  </p>
<p>By analogy, if 25% of ALL AMERICANS were committing a crime such as using fraudulent currency, then it would be reasonable to stop all persons and look in their wallets.</p>
<p>A just law may still be racist. If one race is disproportionately committing a crime, then we should balance the interest of the innocents of that race against the need to protect the population as a whole.  Stopping persons of one race to inquire their citizenship status is a very minor intrusion on liberty compared to the hardship placed on the country by a large illegal population.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;The irony is that although it is Hispanics who have worked themselves into a frenzy of race loyalty, it is they who accuse their opponents of &ldquo;racism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why that isn&rsquo;t EVER pointed out by anyone on these talk shows is really demoralizing.  They&rsquo;re just afraid to tell the truth for fear of being labelled racists for pointing out racism by non-whites.</p>
<p>Too, the draconian Mexican immigration laws are never mentioned either.</p>
<p>Another point to be made is that these people are constantly denigrating this country and its laws, but they never dared to make even a weak peep to improve the political situation in their own country.  This should be highlighted as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it many, many times, but it bears repeating:  The only thing that might put a stop to these people sneaking into the country is to have economic conditions so severe, they could never find employment if they did violate our borders.</p>
<p>We need to fail miserably financially, order to keep the rabble out.  And, it looks like that just may well happen.</p>
<p>It would be a joke if they beat their brains out getting legal only to have no prospects of employment.</p>

		<p>As is expected, another acutely incisive and boldly decisive piece of writing by Mr. Taylor!</p>
<p>The key sentence here being:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we have here is the old, old story of non-whites calling any rule they can&rsquo;t follow &lsquo;racist.&rsquo;&rdquo; </p>
<p>If nonwhites begin to shout &ldquo;racism,&rdquo; about anything that regiments them into acceptable behaviors by Western standards, they should be told without hesitation, your threats and slurs require that the laws become even more specifically strict toward your kind. If you don&rsquo;t like them, get out of the United States of America. Their bellicose coercions and incoherent hootings for &ldquo;justice&rdquo; or &ldquo;no peace,&rdquo; should be met with intransient promises of collective retaliations without compunction!</p>
<p>Moreover, for whites and nonwhites alike, it should be understood without question, that &ldquo;celebrating diversity,&rdquo; is an unforgivably treasonous act of demanding a genocide of the white race!</p>
<p>Indeed, if only the Republicans and a few others in power or celebrity could realize this, we would be home and dry after the coming elections in 2010 and 2012.</p>
<p>As they probably won&rsquo;t, I must say: God help us all!!!</p>

		<p>Jared Taylor: &#8220;The truth is that Mexico is exporting &hellip; its poverty in the form of illegal immigrants to the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>Professor George W. Grayson, senior associate, Center for Strategic and International Studies, elaborated on this point on Lou Dobbs Tonight (May 3, 2007): </p>
<p>&#8220;Lou, Mexico&rsquo;s elites live like maharajas. But they spend extremely little on education and health care and transportation to upgrade the quality of their citizens. They pay about  &mdash;  as a percent of gross domestic product  &mdash;  the same percentage that Haiti pays, 10.4 percent. So as a result, even though it&rsquo;s an immensely wealthy country  &mdash;  gold, silver, beaches, oil &hellip; they prefer to neglect their problems at home, turn a blind eye to them, and let U.S. taxpayers pick up the tab.&#8221;</p>
<p>COMMENT: The U.S. is the maharajas&rsquo; &#8220;safety value.&#8221; Among Mexico&rsquo;s parsimonious elites is Carlos Slim, estimated to be the world&rsquo;s richest man:</p>

		<p>I am gald to see Mr. Taylor and AR attacking these current events head-on. The time is ripe to get white Americans thinking about these issues in racial terms(just as Hispanics, etc. do), and not just grousing about being a &#8220;nation of laws&#8221; &#8220;respecting borders&#8221; and similar tepid language and ideas. </p>
<p>While the Tea Party movement and the like remain in utter denial of their whiteness and the meaning and importance thereof, it never hurts to plant the seeds and reinforce the realities of the situation in the hopes that some will catch on eventually. <br>

		<p>I do not understand what is wrong with being a &#8220;racist.&#8221; It simply means awareness of the proven and demonstrable superiority of whites. This superiority is obvious and evident to anyone who looks at facts in every area of human endeavor. Of course objective facts and data proving white superiority are always quickly supressed because it is not politically correct. Name calling is the usual way to respond when one is obviously wrong and losing an argument. If someone calls me a racist I simply say Hell yes and proud of it. </p>

		<p>Everybody wonders why it is that the media, talk shows, etc NEVER mention these obvious facts, even when the research and work is done for them.  Everybody pleads and ponders HOW we can convince them to return from full hard left to at least a modicum of objectivity and common sense.  The simple fact is - we can&rsquo;t.  We won&rsquo;t be able to.  It will never happen UNTIL we recognize WHO owns the media, who dictates the full left slant of the media, WHO has always been in the forefront of organizations deconstructing White Conservative Bible believing America.  Even in THIS forum one dares not mention them by name, or your post is never put up.  Not ever.  Not if you mention the name of the group of those responsible for the earnest deconstruction and destruction of civilized America.  Here&rsquo;s a hint though.  It&rsquo;s the same group who established the communist party.  It&rsquo;s what Lenin and Trotsky were. It&rsquo;s what Morris Dees is. It&rsquo;s what many college professors and administrators are.  And it&rsquo;s who owns all the MSM and entertainment media and most of the porn industry.  Do your research, since AmRen along with the MSM is too afraid to speak the name of the group who pulls all the strings.</p>

		<p>What is happening now in the US and other White-founded countries (actually ALL of them, excluding Eastern Europe for the time being) is completely unprecedented in world history: a powerful, wealthy, technologically and (up to only yesterday) culturally superior civilization well on its way to commiting rapid suicide. This is happening via a lethal combination of   &mdash;  - abject ethno-cultural self-hatred and -flagellation and soviet-style indoctrination of the populace aganist their own country, perpetrated by virtually the entire elite structure; anti-reason, anti-science witch-hunts affecting and infecting all policies, and even our economic dealings with the inanimate world; precipitous drop in reproduction within the founding European ethnic populations; and a hostile, yet unarmed takeover of entire countries and continents by hordes of foreigners from poor, third-world countries. And the invading population is often very uniform (in its major component) in any given continent or country: e.g. Mestizos in the USA or Arab Muslims in Western Europe, etc. As Samuel Huntington once pointed out, no such transformation has ever occurred peacefully. So in our case: either American society, culture and civic traditions will continue to go down abjectly without a fight worthy of the name   &mdash;  - which I would find astonishing even after all the evodence that it is, in fact, transpiring   &mdash;  - or there will come an awakening, a massive reaction. The more it is delayed, the less pretty and more messy it will be. One wonders how much of the territory now belonging to US will it be possible to eventually salvage.</p>

		<p>What is ironic here is that those who would throw around the word &#8220;racist&#8221; are actually the ones who disrespect race to the point that they would strip spanish speaking peoples of their racial identity.</p>
<p>People who speak spanish (barely) have a language in common.  However, that does not mean they are a &#8220;race&#8221;.  Unlike black people and white people, so called &#8220;hispanics&#8221; are an amalgamated society of several distinct racial blends.  These societies tend to be HIGHLY seggregated based on the dominant race of that blend and these people identify themselves by that dominant race.  They are not &#8220;hispanic&#8221; and indeed, tend to despise those of a different racial mixture that might be lumped together using this term based on nothing more than a shared language (many of which speak it so differently that they have trouble understanding each other).  There is absolutely no racial solidarity between say, puerto ricans and black brazillians.  If asked, the former would say they are white (for the most part because there are &#8220;black&#8221; puerto ricans&hellip;..a minority not welcome to mix with the others) while the latter would say they are black (and would complain of racial discrimnination against them by &#8220;white&#8221; brazillians).</p>
<p>There is no such thing as a hispanic.  And the groups they would lump under &#8220;hispanic&#8221; are in no way against the US enforcing immigration law.  The only ones against it are those involved in the mexican drug trade, almost all of whom are mexicans.</p>
<p>The correct term to be used here is mexican drug dealer.  Not hispanic.  Or even more specific mestizo.  These people have an american indian racial identity that is not shared with &#8220;white&#8221; mexicans.  Other mexican racial types might support their position politically&hellip;.but only because the see the US as a handy way to rid themselves of these people.</p>

It has become the modern equivalent of &#8220;heretic&#8221;, the accusation of which once brought terror into people&rsquo;s hearts. Now, the most terrible thing you can be called  in the modern Inquisition is &#8220;racist&#8221;,  and people can be intimidated into doing anything to avoid that awful smear word.</p>

		<p>I agree with John PM that &#8220;celebrating diversity&#8221; should be considered a treasonous act.</p>
<p>At one time, it seemed quite harmless. But now, given the dire situation that our country is in, being overrun by aliens who have designs on our sovereignty, it is no longer harmless or innocent. It is subversive!</p>

		<p>Using this logic, the laws against murder are also &#8220;racist&#8221;, sine these viciously unfair laws have a disproportionate impact on the nonwhites who just can&rsquo;t seem to control themselves when it comes to rape, armed robbery and murder.</p>
<p>A fun experiment would be to put a &#8220;false-flag&#8221; website online, calling for the repeal of the laws prohibiting murder.  Mumia Jamal could be the poster-boy.  It would be very interesting to see if any of the usual liberal bed-wetting suspects would be willing to march and demonstrate for the repeal of the laws against murder.</p>

		<p>I second the comments by 17-WesternMan: Of note, the drop in the White birth rate combined with allowing massive non-White immigration with no thought of assimilation shows a deep loss of cultural ideology.  Also, as our population decreases, we are more willing to sell what we have to whoever will buy it, even if we have to import the buyers.  Otherwise, it seems White people will not fight as long as we can move away from those coming in.  For example, how many volunteers could we find to fight for the return of Los Angeles?  I have no desire to die for such a cause&hellip; I can just move somewhere else. If we had a higher birth rate, we could solve some of our perceived labor issues, but numbers of people isn&rsquo;t the only issue. In any case, the fight will not come until we are pressed to a breaking point, and otherwise, we&rsquo;ll continue to move into ever smaller areas with ever smaller numbers until we are inconsequential.  There may be an awakening, but more likely it will come from Mexicans taking back the Southwest or from African-Americans demanding their own ethno-centric area in the Southeast. At that point, White people, thus assuaged of their White guilt, -might- gain some sense of identity and start thinking about surviving into the future.</p>

		<p>I highly commend the posts of Bill R and Western Man, #16 &amp; 17. They both have to be taken together to understand the &#8220;problem&#8221; that confronts us. Wonderful posts!</p>
<p>This race-replacement phenomemon which we see taking place beneath our eyes is indeed (as he says)&hellip;<b> &#8220;completely unprecedented in world history: a powerful, wealthy, technologically and culturally superior civilization well on its way to commiting suicide.&#8221; </b></p>
<p>So true! I can&rsquo;t agree more.  I would only quibble with the word &#8220;suicide&#8221;. I would consider what&rsquo;s happening something closer to murder.  What do you call brainwashing a person with self-hate, convincing him he&rsquo;s worthless, and inducing that person to kill himself?  Abetting a suicide?  No, it&rsquo;s worse than that.</p>

<p>Plus they&rsquo;re young, probably don&rsquo;t work if they have time to protest, which means they aren&rsquo;t paying taxes, which means they don&rsquo;t have to pay for illegals, and they don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t know the harsh realities of the real world. Let them graduate, have to earn their own money, pay their own bills, pay taxes, and see their hard-earned money going to support people who are lazy, hate them, and hate the US.  That will wake them up real quickly!<br>

		<p>The word racist didn&rsquo;t exist until 1933, ergo the left implies that the concept of racism didn&rsquo;t exist until 1933.  </p>
<p>I doubt if anyone before 1933 believed that the races were all equal.  </p>
<p>I believe that all other races are inferior to whites based upon their historical lack of accomplishments compared to the accomplishments of whites.  </p>
<p>And according to Webster&rsquo;s this makes me a racist because I bear witness to the truth.  </p>
<p>The truth has set me free and the pride I feel for my race is beyond measure.  </p>
<p>If racism is a lie then why haven&rsquo;t the minorities validated this lie with documented proof to the contrary?  </p>

He is a brave man for telling the whole truth.<br>
Others know the facts but afraid to speak them because they may lose a few $$$$ or be called one smearword. The last time I confronted a talk show host with real facts all he could do was call me the anti name. I told him anti was not always bad. When I swim in the ocean I am anti-shark too.</p>
