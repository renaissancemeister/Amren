<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Arizona&rsquo;s new law targeting illegal immigration is not &#8220;good government,&#8221; a top Department of Homeland Security official said in Chicago on Wednesday.</p>
<p>John Morton, who heads U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said his agency will not necessarily process illegal immigrants referred to them by Arizona officials. The best way to reduce illegal immigration is through a comprehensive federal approach, not a patchwork of state laws, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think the Arizona law, or laws like it, are the solution,&#8221; Morton said during a visit to the Chicago Tribune editorial board.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A former federal prosecutor, Morton said his agency intends to expand the Secure Communities initiative, which gives local sheriff&rsquo;s departments and police access to a Homeland Security database that includes fingerprints. The initiative recently grew to include most of Chicago&rsquo;s suburbs.</p>
<p>Morton also said the agency intends to increase scrutiny of employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants.</p>

		<p>These department heads are beholden to Obama and therefore have to adhere to the party line. Laws mean nothing if they&rsquo;re not enforced and here you have a person in a law enforcement capacity actually refusing to cooperate in the implementation of the law. Instead he obscures the subject by rambling on about a &#8220;comprehensive federal approach&#8221; which offers no details. States can certainly join the fray as the feds haven&rsquo;t been any help. He seems to want more federal snooping, using databases, more Homeland Security type intrusions, perhaps a national i.d. card, etc. In my experience most  illegals work for cash in restaurants, bars, as nannies, in construction, labor, maintenance, you name it, and are off the books. The employers know, or suspect it. States are better placed to locate the illegals. Morton should welcome the help.  </p>

		<p>Anything thst makes a difference is not going to be considered &#8220;good government&#8221; by people like John Morton. The agenda to turn white America into a minority and &#8220;diversify&#8221; us into oblivion is an absolutely top priority agenda. Unemployment could be 25% and the Republicans wouls still be gushing about how much they love illegal immigration and the Democrats pushing for more amnesties. You would still have various hostile ethnic lobbies and organizations saying we don&rsquo;t have enough &#8220;diversity&#8221;, and trying to bring in more non-whites and push for more affirmative action policis and ethnic entitlement programs. </p>

		<p>So now we have government officials that refuse to enforce laws that will protect the citizens against illegal invaders.  It&rsquo;s time to overthrow the traitors and re-elect officials that will swear allegiance to the US Constitution and protect it&rsquo;s citizens.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to wonder what will happen if a foreign army invades our borders.  Will the government and military stand up for the citizens of America? </p>

		<p>&#8220;Comprehensive?&#8221; There&rsquo;s that word again. I fail to see how amnesty is going to reduce illegal alien entry, although I suspect that no matter what the government says, there really is no intention of reducing it, with or without an amnesty passing.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a simple solution for Arizona&hellip;forget ICE. Build a three sided tent-city style &#8216;prison&rsquo; right on the border and let the illegals choose for themselves whether to go home or wear the orange jumpsuit until ICE chooses to do their job. That way AZ won&rsquo;t be accused of being in the deportation business.</p>

		<p>The truth is our federal government doesn&rsquo;t enforce the law because it CAN&rsquo;T enforce the law.  It has become so corrupt and beholden to competing special interest groups that it cannot perform even simple tasks, let alone a complicated nationwide program like rounding up illegals.  Look at the recent BP oil spill.  There is a simple, effective way to clean up such spills that the US was supposed to have in place and ready to go in case it ever happened.  Yet none of the equipment is in place (and nobody can explain why), the correct professionals seem not to know what to do (even though there are specific unambiguous ways to deal with a problem like this).  They can&rsquo;t even get the right men on the job because of political correctness.  The federal government is literally paralyzed over a simple task.  Just imagine if Katrina was happening right now instead of during the Bush administration.  Heck, a couple of Katrina like disasters HAVE happened during Obama&rsquo;s term.  And the only reason millions aren&rsquo;t dead is the ingenuity and diligence of whites (because there certainly wasn&rsquo;t any response from the federal government).  Few people know about it either since the media simply acts like these things never happened.  Same thing with Haiti.  Big news.  Not so big news is the fact that the US basically did nothing&hellip;.except collect alot of money and immediately put it into the pockets of the same people who stole billions from us in the past while doing nothing in Haiti.</p>
<p>My point is the states are doing things now not because they disagree with the federal government so much as the federal government CAN&rsquo;T do anything (including stop any action the states take that they might disagree with).</p>
<p>For all intents and purposes, the US is no longer a single nation under a federal government.  That federal government exists in name but no longer can function.  This is what Obama, Pelosi, Reid etc. don&rsquo;t want people to figure out.  Why should people pay taxes under the circumstances.  If they choose to stop paying attention to federal laws, what could anyone do about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even about seccession anymore.  The responsibility of getting even the littlest thing done now falls to the states and they have carte blanche to do what they want.</p>
<p>Soon they will figure this out and the US will&hellip;.change.</p>

<p><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the Arizona law, or laws like it, are the solution,&rdquo; Morton said during a visit to the Chicago Tribune editorial board.</i></p>
<p><br>
So this John Morton, who heads U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, paid a special visit to the Chicago Tribune editorial board? Normally, pols and other govt reps give their speeches or make their announcements either from their offices or at press conferences. This one apparently was either invited into the offices of a major newspaper; or invited himself into their offices. Either way, the separation of media and state isn&rsquo;t too separate here, is it? A liberal ICE head just happens to show up at the offices of a liberal daily guaranteed to agree with his open-borders message. How cozy. </p>
<p>And the reporter&rsquo;s name? Oscar Avila.</p>
<p>I rest my case. </p>

		<p>Sonya has it right. The solution to the problem is to go after those who employ illegals. Create state laws that impose a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years hard time on employers. The problem would dissolve overnight. This has no chance of happening without radical changes in government at the state level. Starting at the state and local level and targeting employers may be a good start.</p>

		<p>Arizona should then simply charter buses and ship the illegal aliens to a sanctuary city, say San Francisco.  Let them ask ICE for help.  Surely San Fran can handle 400,000 illegals a year.</p>

		<p>This guy, as a former FEDERAL prosecutor, doesn&rsquo;t like states passing laws that he feels trespass on his federal arena.  They do in fact trespass - but when the Feds get off their rear ends and start preventing innocent Arizonans from getting killed by illegals, maybe the state of AZ won&rsquo;t HAVE to enact such legislation!!</p>

<p>So it looks like Arizona and other states will be taking care of that part of the Federal responsibility on as well.  What may be going on is the political collapse of the Federal government through lack of effective direction from the top. From Eric Holder to - insert any Obama appointee here - the Federal government becomes less and less relevant to middle America.  We must be prepared to run things ourselves.  </p>
<p>Good for you Arizona!  We are with you in spirit.  I propose that Arizona supporters find a way to send funds to the state for support of its immigration policies, or to somehow make up for the financial losses that various bans some cities and states are enacting.</p>
<p>Any ideas, anyone?</p>

		<p>&#8220;The best way to reduce illegal immigration is through a comprehensive federal approach, not a patchwork of state laws, he said.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neither this pitiful soul nor any of the other oddballs in the community organizer&rsquo;s pro-black administration wants to curb illegal immigration, so all of them are going to criticize anything that has to do with protecting the borders and reducing the flow of non-whites.</p>
<p>The dangerous thing about their loudmouth assertions, however, is that they&rsquo;re doing no less than fomenting armed insurrection.  For an administration, especially a president, to encourage rebellion is unheard of in most any first world nation, but this character is a mentally challenged black who is enamoured of himself and probably doesn&rsquo;t understand the repercussions of much of what he says and does.  </p>
<p>This is only one example of why black administrations always bring a country to ruin&hellip;&hellip; and to chaos before it gets there.  And it is a further example of why Marxist appointees always seem to bring themselves to destruction after a short period of blatant outrages that they regard as &#8220;good ideas&#8221; in their own perverted thinking.</p>
<p>The country is on the way out.  It is degenerating badly economically, socially, and through a loss of competence.  Added to all that is the very real possibility of civil war, which is a direct result of the antagonistic language used by these people.</p>
<p>It is bizarre that the verbal fighting going on is not so much between contentious factions within the society, but by the ruling administration and the vast majority of the population, whom he demonizes as terrorists for opposing his agenda.</p>
<p>And, ironically, this president is grinning idiotically through it all, smug and self assured in his self-perceived greatness, seemingly unaware of the dangerous repercussion of his rhetoric and his actions.  </p>
<p>Is it possible he&rsquo;s too dimwitted to understand the seriousness of the situation or does he really want to collapse the country because he has some childish notion that he can rebuild it more completely along a true Marxist dictatorship once it finally disintegrates, unaware that history reveals his side as usually always the loser even against a populace that isn&rsquo;t armed to the teeth as this one is?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had a rotten feeling about that for awhile now.  I don&rsquo;t want to get conspiratorial, but just a gleaning of the facts regarding the federal government&rsquo;s non-response to the illegal invasion along with the massive bailout of bankers(while the real economy is left to die) really makes me wonder if we have a big surprise coming.</p>

<p>Typical politicaleze or rather politicalsleaze the translation of which is as follows:</p>
<p>&#8220;WE know you chumps want real border control first and foremost but you suckers ain&rsquo;t gonna get it &#8216;till  we sellouts get amnesty for the illegals, which is what we really want to ensure future voters on our side. We call it something nice sounding like &#8216;comprehensive reform&rsquo; to which your precious border control will be held hostage.  Of course, once you pesky voters allow us this &#8216;comprehensive immigration reform&rsquo;, i.e., amnesty, we won&rsquo;t care about your borders, which borders will be swamped anyway by future amnesty want-to-bees. So suck it up suckers or we&rsquo;ll keep denouncing you as lousy racists!&#8221;</p>

		<p>Michelle Obama was shown on a major network on the national news talking to a hispanic girl in a school about illegal immigration. The little girl told her her mother didn&rsquo;t have papers. Mrs. Obama said, &#8220;We&rsquo;ll have to do something about that.&#8221; <br>
Even if she was just patronizing the little girl, her comments gave an indictation about what she thinks about illegal immigration. Since the Obama&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t care about the problems with illegal immigration, it&rsquo;s not surprising this guy Morton would say something along these lines. </p>

		<p>If this current crop of communists were in power at the time Pearl Harbor was attacked they would have been on Japan&rsquo;s payroll.  </p>
<p>They would have called the attack an unfortunate misstep on the part of Japan.  </p>
<p>The president would have bowed so low to the emperor of Japan that his nose would have touched the floor.  </p>
<p>Anyone who spoke out against the Japanese would have been called a racist.  </p>
<p>Congress would have encouraged millions of Japanese to immigrate to the US illegally.  </p>
<p>The children of the Japanese illegals would have had Japanese speaking public school teachers.  </p>
<p>And the first word out of the mouths of the Japanese anchor babies would have been, &ldquo;banzi&rdquo;&hellip;  </p>
