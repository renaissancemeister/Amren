			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Editorial, Washington Times, May 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The widely distributed videotape of a lighter-complected suspect near the [Times Square] attack scene  &mdash;  almost universally reported as a &#8220;white man&#8221;  &mdash;  raised expectations in some quarters that this could be the work of right-wing extremists, maybe even  &mdash;  oh dare it be hoped?  &mdash;  a Tea Party Republican.</p>
<p>The right-wing bomber story line quickly established itself in the meme stream. New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, prompted by CBS News reader Katie Couric, speculated that the culprit was &#8220;homegrown, maybe a mentally deranged person or someone with a political agenda that doesn&rsquo;t like the health care bill or something.&#8221; MSNBC&rsquo;s Chris Matthews and NBC News &#8220;terrorist analyst&#8221; Roger W. Cressey dwelt long on the idea of the bomber being someone with a &#8220;right-wing&#8221; agenda. Geraldo Rivera seemed fixated on the idea that the bomber was a &#8220;white man.&#8221; Similar unsubstantiated musings and outright accusations were rife in the liberal blogosphere.</p>
<p>But then a suspect was apprehended on a Dubai-bound airplane, and his name was Faisal Shahzad. Talk about an inconvenient truth. It would be nice if this were just another opportunity to mock the haplessness of those liberals who are so captive to their agenda that they subordinate reality to their warped worldview. Delusions like this, however, place the country in danger.</p>
<p>{snip} Muslim extremists should be considered the default culprits in every random act of terrorism unless compelling evidence exists to the contrary. {snip}.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Blaming the white American man is an ingrained habit, driven by political correctness and unapologetic biases. This is the same knee-jerk response that occurred over the October 2002 D.C. snipers. The prevailing view at the time was that the perpetrator was some kind of white, male, veteran, right-wing, religious nut. Commentators, self-appointed terrorism experts and security officials discussed the profile as though it were incontestable. When the shooters turned out to be two black males under the spell of radical Islam who virtually worshipped Osama bin Laden, the narrative collapsed. {snip}</p>
<p>Those who style themselves as the intellectual class are so captive to hatred for a particular kind of American citizen that they immediately and without evidence ascribe acts of violence to them. These liberals should reflect on the fact that they&rsquo;ve become the most bigoted people in America.</p>

<p>Notice that the airline Shahzad tried to escape on is UAE state-owned.  That&rsquo;s that wonderful country that wanted to take over our ports several years ago, that most neo-cons on talk radio had no problem with, though both Laura Ingraham and the host born Michael Alan Weiner were both opposed.  Chuck Schumer had the good sense to come out against it, but that was mainly because of pressure exerted by the Longshoreman&rsquo;s Union, which itself stumbled onto the right position.</p>

		<p>The reason we are losing is because we have no funded organization with credibility who will demand an apology from the politicians and MSM for perpetuating a hurtful stereotype that angry Whites are dangerous and violent.</p>
<p>If White people were as they are demeaned to be, we would be active instead of passive.</p>

<p>They won&rsquo;t.  Admitting when they&rsquo;ve been wrong   &mdash;   let alone that they&rsquo;ve been wrong for ideological reasons   &mdash;   isn&rsquo;t a liberal characteristic.  They&rsquo;ll simply lay low for a day or two, then hit the reset button and begin their search for White scapegoats all over again.</p>
<p>Interesting, though, that the <i>Times</i> makes public note of this.  The tide is turning, however slowly.</p>

		<p>Yeah, I was pretty ticked when the newspersons kept saying it was a white man.  I didn&rsquo;t believe it.  And sho&rsquo;nuff, L &amp; B (that&rsquo;s ministerial talk for &#8220;Lo and Behold,&#8221;) we have - gasp - a Pakistani &#8220;naturalized&#8221; citizen.  As soon as I heard that, I &#8220;made a joyful noise unto the Lord&#8221; and to whomever else was within earshot.  OF COURSE it was a Muslim!!!  When are the people of this nation going to realize that Islam is by far the very greatest threat to our country and to the entire world???  How many more of our citizens have to die before we &#8220;get it&#8221; and start deporting Muslims en masse?  None of them can be trusted.  And the more we try to &#8220;PC&#8221; it, the more deaths we&rsquo;ll have.  </p>

		<p>We have a government and leftist media that are doing all they can to demonize the white man at every chance. I read an article on Sunday from the AP that said it was a white, middle-aged man and then Bloomberg jumped onto the rhetoric trying to imply that it was teaparty member that did this because he didn&rsquo;t like Obamacare. The worst thing about all this is that while the liberal left is trying to make an enemy of white men, the real threat (Muslims) is being ignored or actually praised as &#8220;peaceloving&#8221;. So we have an insane government and an anti-white, Democrat lapdog media machine that are putting us all in more danger every day because of political correctness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Intellectual class,&#8221; of course is how they like to view themselves.  But if, like me, you&rsquo;re hard pressed to see how anybody with half-a-brain himself thinks Katy Couric, Charles Gibson, Dan Rather, etc. are intellectuals, I think you&rsquo;ve got it right on.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take much sense to read a teleprompter and even less to give an opinion.  And to go along with a prevailing party line that is dictated by someone else in control is the sign of an absolute fool.</p>
<p>Hopefully, society will be purged of these arrogant fools when their networks hit the skids for lack of revenue.</p>

<p>Indeed they do!</p>
<p>This really is acutely analogous to the &ldquo;Duke Rape&rdquo; case, but with an international twist. It was not enough that the bomber be &ldquo;white&rdquo; here, but a &ldquo;homegrown white&rdquo; as well. They really are looking for another Timothy McV, and will stop at nothing to find one, or even encourage one, to indulge in his/her homicidal insanity straight into their Red limelight of gleeful Marxist reproach and genocidal bombast.   </p>
<p>The recently aired &ldquo;documentary&rdquo; hosted by Rachel Maddow on MSNBC about Timothy McV, comes unquestionably close to making this a hard and undisputable fact. They are looking to set the Reichstag fire, via any white freak they can find stupid enough to be &ldquo;inspired&rdquo; by their childishly cruel and selfish Red dogmas. They enjoy nonwhite terrorism directed against the West, hence no documentaries about  9/11 and Muslims, and will even fabricate it as being &ldquo;homegrown&rdquo; and &ldquo;white,&rdquo; for as long as they can, if they think they can aid their treasonously multicultural cause. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all; excluding all Reds, of course!</p>

		<p>I have to say that I was greatly relieved to learn that it was not a White man.  As we all know, any crime committed by a White is merely the tip of the iceberg, a proxy for a thousand other undiscovered offenses.  If the MSM had gotten their wish, this failed bomb would have justified overlooking a whole year&rsquo;s worth of Black attacks on Whites.  Any speck in our eye outweighs a 2X4 in theirs.  </p>

		<p>Watching CNN shortly after the video clip became public it seemed as though ever other comment was &#8220;White suspect&#8221;, or &#8220;White person of interest&#8221;.  That a person of Pakistani or Middle Eastern descent may be Caucasian is one thing, but in America, &#8220;White&#8221; is more a term for those of Northern European descent.  That the MSM uses &#8220;White&#8221; to describe such suspects is disingenuous on their part. They know the terrorists are overwhelmingly Middle Eastern Muslim/Islamic, yet publicly push the demonization of the &#8220;White&#8221; man.  </p>

		<p>So now that the homegrown white man theory has been dispelled and the media is left with no convenient target, their new description and frame of reference has become &#8220;an American citizen&#8221;, &#8220;one of our own&#8221;, and &#8220;family man.&#8221; That&rsquo;s the closest they can get to &#8216;white American&rsquo;, and the farthest from &#8216;immigrant&rsquo; or &#8216;minority.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>I remember quite clearly, two days ago, sitting there at my office computer, watching the video over and over again.  This was in the morning when each and every news station was insisting he was white.  I looked at the video very closely and I knew from the beginning this guy was Muslim.  </p>
<p>First of all, the only thing the video shows, is that the man is NOT black. But it looked to me like he could be anything else other than black.  How the media, through their own &#8220;process of elimination&#8221; came to a 100% definate conclusion that the guy was white, really baffles me.  </p>
<p>For one, he doesn&rsquo;t even look like the typical &#8220;right wing fanatic&#8221; that the media loves to pick on.  It is obvious that the man in the video isn&rsquo;t a wasp; he doesn&rsquo;t have blonde, reddish, or light brown hair, nor does he have pinkish skin.  It is obvious that his hair is very black, and very dark for the average white person in America.  Unless they were hoping the suspect just might be a Sicilian American, I really don&rsquo;t understand where they were coming from at all.  </p>
<p>Well, of course I understand &hellip;I understand fully well what their agenda was.  Hopefully this will backfire.</p>

		<p>This is just Standard Operating Procedure for the American media. Every time there is some major story in the news and the perpetrator turns out to be one of their beloved, protected &#8220;minorities&#8221; you can literally see and hear the disappointment and exasperation of the commentators! Their whole demeanor changes, their voices quiet, their expressions are pained and they suddenly employ an entirely more objective or even sympathetic tone regarding the accused. Just the opposite of the immediate rush to judgement, the vitriol and venom reserved for whites accused of virtually any type of crime. </p>

		<p>The media.  The MSM and the entertainment media.  Their blatant wish to demonize the root founding racial group at every drop of the hat.  It ALL makes sense when you finally realize WHO owns those organizations, and accept the realization that group hates the white, christian, flyover American even MORE than any other group, including the muslims (who have sworn to eradicate that very group).  Sorry to be so obtuse, but even AmRen is obviously reluctant to mention &#8220;that group&#8221; by name.  Which is WHY they (the not to be named group) will continue to win against us until we are no more.</p>

		<p>I happened to come across a picture of the Paki Ambassador to the UK the other day.  He is a native born Pakistani and he is whiter than I am.  If I can find the link, I will post it.</p>
<p>That said, the expectation by the US Ministry of Propaganda   &mdash;   aka MSM   &mdash;   that whites can only be European or of Euro origin is racist and bigoted on its face.  Not to mention ignorant.</p>
<p>I heard about the remarks of Contessa Brewer.  Gee, I almost never worry about the problems of other people.  I just don&rsquo;t have the time, money or inclinition (sp) to do so.  I have enough with myself and mine to worry about.</p>
<p>And now, let me make my racist comment.  I knew it wasn&rsquo;t a white man.  How?  Because the bomb didn&rsquo;t go off.  If a white man had done so, it would have been reverse engineered six weeks to Saturday.  It would have been test exploded in the desert to make sure the design was all systems go.  It would not have failed.  I hope this diversatoid enjoys spending the rest of his life in Super Max in Colorado.  That is presuming that Obama doesn&rsquo;t pardon this guy, the Fort Hood shooter, and all the other muslim nutjobs just before he leaves office.</p>

		<p>I heard many people remarking about this being a white guy&hellip;.Obama, Bloomberg, various media pundits etc.</p>
<p>One group I did not hear utter this was average liberals.  Instead, what I&rsquo;ve heard out of them is how disturbed they were that the media and law enforcement were so busy trying to pretend it was &#8220;some balding middle age white guy&#8221; that they almost let this muslim terrorist get away.  They are worried that there are other muslims trying to kill us but that our government under Obama has no interest in stopping them out of political correctness.</p>

		<p>The media was in a rush to identify the bomber as &#8216;white&rsquo;; they must have been sorely disappointed to find out he was a Pakistani native, Feisal Shazad. Of course, he is a swarthily pale admixture-but hardly a WASP. How disappointing!</p>
<p>It looks very much like the terrorists have won when Muslims are being appointed to appease the population base from which they come. Perhaps this bombing plan will be treated &rsquo;sensitively&rsquo; as was the mass Islamic murderer psychiatrist at Fort Hood., Nidal Hussein, for whom there is so much concern that he is treated fairly. </p>
<p>It is also alarming that the US media were at great pains to stress that the driver of the car was &lsquo;white&rsquo;, whereas it carefully avoids stating race where blacks, Asians or hispanics are involved. At the same time, it needs to be remembered that in the US Middle Easterners are classified as white. What&rsquo;s more, though a Pakistan terrorist group took credit for the attempted car bombing, the media cautions the public not to &lsquo;jump to conclusions&rsquo; regarding the perpetrators.</p>
<p>There are obvious parallels with the ways minorities in Britain most likely to spawn terrorists are treated. It is alarming that the ability to speak Hindu, Punjabi and Urdu and being president of the British Indian Association should qualify an Indian to be an Inspector rather than an Englishman in the heart of England. It would be bad enough if this discriminatory promotion occurred in Londonistan, but to happen in Yorkshire, where the weakness and effeminacy, and fascination with the dismantling of values and traditions, factors that are linked with the southern metropolis, is a devastating blow to free England. Yorkshire has been the centre where resistance to destructive change has been championed. But now, its leaders have sunk to social vandalism. The obvious collusion in the pretext for demoting Peter Richmond to constable is such an egregious injustice that it may be Chief Superintendent Allan Doherty&rsquo;s own undoing. Thankfully the police association is supporting Peter Richmond, and luckily even &ldquo;This is London&rdquo; seems to support him: there is certainly no obvious disapproval of his willingness to make a stand. </p>
<p>The same collusion to promote untruthfulness is likely to recur in New York, as it would be in Australia if some murderous atrocity the media were unable to suppress became widely known.</p>

		<p>I noticed a trend among mainstream-media headlines the moment it was discovered that the suspect hailed from Pakistan: Nearly every article began with the phrase &#8220;A US citizen&hellip;&#8221; or &#8220;A naturalized US citizen.&#8221; And nearly every article failed to note that he was naturalized in 2009.</p>

		<p>Do not ask liberals to reflect on their biases! They are fully aware of the game they play. Instead we ought play their game back to them. Our hands are cleaner than theirs.

Now, the media   &mdash;   and our politicians!   &mdash;   have turned everything around and are jumping in to make excuses for them and trying to cover for them.

		<p>This society has become more and more like a great big mad hatter&rsquo;s tea party.  Some people who are intelligent, educated, and steeped in political discourse have somehow convinced themselves that the motives of Muslim terrorists are a mystery. And, just as serious, few seem to understand that the terrorists&rsquo; intentions are not always to simply set off a bomb.  They may be indulging in dry runs, tests of the community&rsquo;s responses (both physical and political), or in the attempted desensitizing of the public to their actions.  They obviously stage antics wherein they can claim discrimination and then threaten suits or make officials seem to be crying wolf.  And they&rsquo;re certainly winning when they get NYC mayors, the NYT, and high-profile commentators to argue that Islamic terrorism is not really behind Muslim terrorists!</p>

		<p>  The dimwit media can&rsquo;t hide their disapppointment that the Times Sq. bomber wasn&rsquo;t a right-wing white man. Their list of enemies and demons is quite limited  to white, conservatives like me, Michigan militia, Tea Partiers, Rush, etc. <br>
I&rsquo;m referring to WHITE people. The mind of the Crazy White Liberal is an unique creation not found in any other species. Just read a story of a crazy, white liberal woman, who after being repeatredly raped by a black man, while she begged him <br>
to stop, wrote a piece blaming white men for the parthological behavior of blacks.<br>
I&rsquo;m always looking for an explanation to this mystery<br>

<p>Yes, this shift has been turning whacky for years now, and in the last couple of years it has accelerated greatly.  It&rsquo;s as if the election of the pro-black, anti-white community organizer caused the leftist dregs to shift into hysterical mode wherein they&rsquo;ve reached a fever pitch, unaware that much of what they say not only reveals a shameful bias for all people non-white and an abject hatred for any white who does not subscribe to their brand of insane politics.</p>
<p>They were created as part of a corruption process instigated by behind the scenes influences that are adept at influencing the thinking of weak-minded people.</p>
<p>And, speaking of weak-minded people, does anybody believe that a Garofalo or Susand Surandan, or Baldwin really studied the political situation and made analysis and evaluations on their own objective considerations?  Like the news media, they were &#8220;directed&#8221; on what to believe and espouse.</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re so easily duped, keep in mind that they could have just as easily been Maoists, Stalinists, Nazis or Pol Pot supporters, but the leftist freaks of political correctness got to them first.</p>

<p>The main reason they want citizenship is so they can move around the country far more easily with far less law enforcement scrutiny.  In this same spirit, the 9/11 hijackers adopted American folkways and customs, even though it was against the tenets of Islam, because Islam also has another tenet called Taqquiya, which basically states that you can lie and cheat and violate all the other tenets of Islam if it&rsquo;s done in the spirit of advancing Islam, i.e. committing terrorist acts against the infidel.</p>

<p>Of course, Bloomberg is not thinking of the welfare of &#8216;people like himself&rsquo;.  He is only thinking of himself.  Somehow it benefits him, or his ego, to maintain his insane stance.  The welfare of even his own family members is apparently irrelevant to him.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s even more absurd for non-whites and self-hating whites to keep saying white (men) are dangerous, considering whites have caved into just about every demand from women and non-whites for awhile.  Blacks wants integration, equal rights, jobs they can&rsquo;t do, to go to our schools, sleep with our women, and now a black president who hates whites I might add.  Nothing whites will do will please self-hating whites and blacks, hispanics, and other non-white &#8216;victims&rsquo; out there.</p>

____</p>
<p>But not surprising.  According to the mentality of the media and people like Bloomberg, we ARE the ones who need to be watched.  They don&rsquo;t trust us an inch. That&rsquo;s why they want to contruct their multi-culti Tower of Babel in place of white American civilization. They&rsquo;ll feel more comfortable there, with us  eliminated or reduced to an impotent minority.<br>
Not surprising at all!</p>

<p>Have no fear for Billionaire Bloomberg.  He has homes in many places, including an estate on the nice, secure - and very remote   &mdash;   mid-Atlantic island of Bermuda.  He won&rsquo;t have to worry. Let us worry about ourselves.</p>
