<h1><a href="https://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/National_News_2/article_6957.shtml">An America for Whites Only?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Charlene Muhammad, Final Call (Chicago), May 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The fall out over passage of an anti-immigration law in Arizona continued across the United States this week with people wondering is America being reduced to a nation &#8220;for Whites only?&#8221; </p>
<p>Anti-racism activist and author Tim Wise says a sense of &#8220;White racial anxiety,&#8221; has in his view, &#8220;taken over large segments of White America.&#8221; </p>
<p>According to Mr. Wise, the sense of entitlement that Whites have always enjoyed is being challenged by demographic data showing the growth of Black and Brown populations projected to become equal with the White population by 2050, as well as a change in the political landscape, demonstrated by the first Black president of the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;This idea that White folks give voice to every now and then that they&rsquo;re losing their country, sometimes they mean with Black folks and the Black president and sometimes they&rsquo;re referring to Latinos and Brown folks. It seems that though, when White folks say that they&rsquo;re referring to some nostalgic sentiments of the past that they want to resurrect,&#8221; said Mr. Wise.</p>
<p>&#8220;They can&rsquo;t fathom a country wherein they are not the norm, the prototype of what an American is. The way they&rsquo;ve grown up for years is when they hear the word American, they see their (own) face and people of color have never been able to have that reaction, that when they talk about American, they&rsquo;re talking about me, but White folks have, so when all of a sudden you&rsquo;ve got to share that title, that symbol with Black and Brown people that have different names and faith traditions than yours, that shakes them up because they have that sense of entitlement.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>&#8220;This law is a very racist law and it&rsquo;s persecuting people of color and very much affecting people of dark complexion. If you do not look Anglo you could be questioned and asked for your documents, but in our cases, even though we are of Afro descent, we have accents but they could ask for documentation from all of us,&#8221; and many people are now afraid to even go out of their homes in Arizona, said Eunice Escobar, a board member of the Chicago Religious Leadership Network on Latin America and member of the Association of Afro Columbians in Displacement. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The legalization of the 12 million people and their families is the most effective solution to the Arizona bill,&#8221; Mr. Rodriguez told The Final Call. He charged that the right wing plan is to create conditions for the undocumented that are so miserable and uncomfortable, people will self deport and to some degree, that occurred in the 1930s and 1950s with Operation Wetback, the United States&rsquo; repatriation project that targeted primarily Mexicans. </p>
<p>Under Operation Wetback, the U.S. Border Patrol found more than one million undocumented immigrants when they raided Mexican American barrios in Southeastern states in 1954. They sought identification from &#8220;Mexican-looking&#8221; citizens they stopped on the streets and ultimately, many immigrants were deported and many others fled the U.S. </p>
<p>Now history is repeating itself and without swift, strategic action, opponents of the bill argued, its negative profiling implications could permeate America&rsquo;s entire infrastructure, including the Prison Industrial Complex, and its health care and education systems, for starters. </p>
<p>{snip}<br>
<strong><br>
Not just Arizona</strong></p>
<p>Already, other states are signaling that they could follow Arizona&rsquo;s suit.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were eight the last time I heard, who are thinking about copy cat legislation,&#8221; said Mr. Wise. &#8220;One of the things that makes that likely is that the folks who were behind this in Arizona are members of a loosely affiliated set of groups that have a history of White supremacy, White nationalism, like FAIR (Federation for American Immigration Reform), (Sen.) Russell Pearce (R-AZ), the main sponsor in Arizona. Those folks have a connection to a larger network of national groups and individuals. No doubt, Arizona was just a test case,&#8221; he added. </p>

		<p>The browning of this country can be traced back to the 1965 Immigration Act.  Before that piece of hateful legislation was passed the US was about 90 percent white, just as it has been since it&rsquo;s inception.  Whites are being replaced.  In just a couple generations whites have gone from 90 percent to maybe 55 or so percent now.  That doesn&rsquo;t just happen by accident.  There have been no mass pandemics that target only whites, aside from black crime of course.  No great wars that thinned white population.  I also believe that the mainstreaming of radical feminist ideology also contributed to the population shift.  White women were pushed into chasing careers and putting off or even forgoing having children for the absurd notion that having a high powered career is more important than having a family.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;so when all of a sudden you&rsquo;ve got to share that title&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but when people from other countries think of an America, they don&rsquo;t have black or Mexicans in mind.  I can move to China, marry a Chinese girl and learn the language, but no one will ever say that I am Chinese.  And I would never look at a white guy who did those things and think that he is Chinese.</p>
<p>The trouble with mass immigration today is that Mexicans, Chinese, etc. are coming in such huge numbers that they are not assimilating anymore into what we used to call &#8216;regular&rsquo; American culture.  </p>
<p>A person can be a non-white, and if they imbibe the American ethos, if you will, then most whites could accept that person on some level or another as an American.  (That&rsquo;s how the Irish, Italians or Hungarians, etc did it.  Oh, wait, the Italians still have a WAYS to go.  Damn Guido culture!)</p>
<p>The thing is, the Mexicans are keeping their Mexican culture and identity.  Even third generation Mexican kids have accents and are more Mexican that America.  Chinese and Koreans do learn English out here, but they huddle in Iron Rice Bowl-like enclaves and squeeze everyone else out.</p>
<p>That is why the lessons of multicultural failure all over the world are such a danger for us.  Name me even one multicultural society that is functioning, full of equality and justice and stable.  There are countries with more than one ethnic group in them, but they are all restive based on cultural, racial, linguistic and other factors of diversity.  Even Belgium may break up soon, over what?  Language differences!  America, you had your time.</p>

		<p>Whites in a white-majority country wish to keep it 100% white?  Gee, what an &#8216;entitlement&rsquo; mentality we have.  I guess blacks don&rsquo;t have an &#8216;entitlement mentality&rsquo; to want to preserve their own neighborhoods and institutions they&rsquo;ve stolen   &mdash;   er, I mean, &#8216;created&rsquo;, right?</p>

		<p> The very name of the author of this piece of drivel   &mdash;   Charlene Muhammad   &mdash;   is a dead giveaweay that it will be nothing but bad news for White people. It&rsquo;s trendy among many blacks to take Muslim-sounding surnames   &mdash;   I suspect even if they aren&rsquo;t actually Muslims.</p>
<p> White &#8220;anxiety&#8221;, this Tim Wise person says? Gee, I wonder why that could be? Maybe it&rsquo;s because the census of 1960 showed the U.S. to be 89 percent White, or European-American, and now the census of 2010 is likely to show a drop in our majority to around 65 percent   &mdash;   IF we&rsquo;re lucky, that is. The censuses of 1790 through 1960 consistently showed European-descended Americans to be in 80-odd percent majorities. Then, the mischief-making Congress elected in the Lyndon Landslide of 1964 fiddled with the immigration laws to assure that henceforth, only darker-skinned people could come in in really large numbers. We&rsquo;re now seeing the result.</p>
<p> And that doesn&rsquo;t even count the millions of Mexican illegals who stream across the Rio Grande, hampered little by puny federal border-security efforts.</p>
<p> We built this country, and now we&rsquo;re unhappy that hordes of the darker races are threatening to take it over   &mdash;   maybe even carve off the Southwest so it can again become a part of Mexico. Is that so hard to understand, or sympathize with? Apparently so, to these radical open-borders advocates.</p>
<p> Funny, isn&rsquo;t it, how in a little over 200 years of independence we&rsquo;ve managed to surrender our birthright, while China, after more than 3,000 years as an independent entity, still remains almost 92 percent Han Chinese. Maybe they had the right idea with the Great Wall. Maybe we should build an American version.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that America is just for whites, that&rsquo;s simply outrageous. I do, however, believe that sicne this alwasy has been an overwhelmingly white, nation, it must remauin at least 70-80% white. And we must always retain this sense that we are the truest, and yes, the most entitled, Americans out there.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s right about that, if I wanted to live in Mexico I would move there and not wait for it to come to me. To me America will always be a white country even if it is owned by others. </p>

<p>I suspect these &#8216;anti-racism&rsquo; attacks are picking up steam in order to distract the white populace as to the fact that they are being displaced. &#8216;If you don&rsquo;t like being displaced, you just might be a racist&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another article that highlights how these &#8216;anti-racism&rsquo; attacks are spreading:</p>

		<p>The Western World was never 100% white but always allowed people of color into their midst.  The Western civilization was and continue to be built by white brain power and discipline.  When the white genes are no longer the majority, the advanced civilization crashes.  It is as simple as that.  This has happened to every advanced white society from the Aryans of the Indus Valley in India, Egypt, Greece, Rome and now Europe and the United States.  For the present, how will all this play out is anyone&rsquo;s guess.  Blacks and Browns cannot maintain the advanced civilizations of Europe and this country.  What will it take for whites to wake up and save their own standard of living and present scientific advances?  Hopefully, it will not be what the whites are doing in South Africa, letting themselves be murdered by blacks and living in poverty under blacks.  Perhaps, this is what happened to the advanced civilizations of the past.  Let&rsquo;s just hope that the white genes do not become completely submerged as in present day India, Greece, and Egypt for humanity as a whole will suffer greatly.  There are the genes of the yellow man but it is not on par with white genes.  It is the white genes that have accelerated the technological advances that all of humanity is presently enjoying.  Presently, it appears that the average decent whites have lost their sense of self and purpose.  They have allowed others to direct them on how they should view themselves and to feel immoral to be living in a complete white society.  Because of this moral impasse, the average white citizen have allowed their government and  judicial systems to become increasing corrupt.  This has led to ignoring the concerns and needs of the average citizen which in turn leads to suspicious and hostility toward its elected &#8220;leaders&#8221; which then strains the continuation of an advanced society.   </p>

		<p>If you look at a map of the western hemisphere you will see that the bulk of the landmass belongs to hispanics.  Why should we hand over the US and Canada?  Let them clean up their own mess.  As for blacks, well the black majority countries in the Caribbean are a disaster worse than any hispanic country.  I am sick to my stomach knowing that my descendents will be a persecuted minority in a nation that will end of little better than present day Cuba.  As much as I hate the thought I say a divorce is needed.  Give black Americans their own country.  Give Puerto Rico independence.  And let European Americans have the balance.  The hispanics and asians can go to whatever country they or their forebears came from.  If the new black America wants to keep Africans among their ranks that would be their choice.  If they choice to toss out Africans that too would be their choice.</p>
<p>This is has nothing to do with &#8220;white privilege&#8221;.  This has to do with living in and passing down a civilized, English speaking, Christian, low crime/high literacy nation.  Anyone with half a brain can not deny what happens when blacks and hispanics take over.  You get bedlam.  And quite frankly I do not want to be ruled by the pet minority, Asians.  Just because Asians are more literate and civilized than blacks and browns doesn&rsquo;t mean I want to be under their thumb.  Let them stay in their nations.</p>
<p>I think most white people, if honest, have little interest in world domination.  Most of us want our troops brought home.  Most of us believe in live and let live.  Let the Chinese, the Congolese and the Brazilians have the type of society they want and let us have the type of society we want.  Is that so criminal?  We can buy Arab oil and sell Arabs grain without telling Arabs how to live.  We can trade with the world without letting the world move in.  We can trade with the world with out butting into everyone else&rsquo;s business.</p>
<p>If given a choice between the road we are currently on or bequeathing our children a less extravagant lifestyle but a safer, more civilized one I would hope we Euro Americans would go for more civilized.  We can survive quite nicely without a Mexican mowing our lawn.  We can survive quite nicely without a new model cell phone every six months.<br>

<p>Seriously, the big error in this article is saying that the &#8220;black and brown population is growing.&#8221;  In reality, it&rsquo;s only the &#8220;brown&#8221; part of that is growing; Domestic American blacks are procreating at a rate not much higher than replacement level.</p>

		<p>Okay&hellip; African-Americans consider themselves more African than American, Brown folks consider themselves more Mexican or Hispanic than American, and White people view themselves as Americans.  So I would have to agree, that when the breakup comes, there will be &#8220;an America for Whites only&#8221;. Continued mass immigration will only make the breakup come sooner and with greater violence. </p>

<p>The correct formulation is that America is being reduced FROM a nation &#8220;for whites only&#8221; (i.e. of, by, and for white people, with limited others welcome if they behave and play along).</p>

		<p>The reason Whites lack ethnic cohesion is because they dont share a culture or an ethnicity bc Anglo-Scotch founders that came before 1830 were dilluted by Irish and later E. &amp; S. European immigrants. Rural American Whites are the vanguard bc they are less dilluted than Urban Whites, they have more ethnic cohesion for collective behavior, so Race Realists should focus on promoting regional seperatism among the Rural Vanguard, not giving up on Urbanites but forging a sense of brotherhood in both.</p>

<p>The insanely paradoxical concept of &ldquo;white privilege&rdquo; as posited by Comrade Wise and his fellow travelers, is based on a Marxist delusion that traditional American society can be enjoyed by both whites and nonwhites, simply if they move here and outnumber us, and then somehow mysteriously &ldquo;enrich&rdquo; us. It forgets, that nonwhites flock to this land of &ldquo;white privilege,&rdquo; without any care of how they are hurting themselves and the &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; countries they are fleeing, by not advancing them or themselves through their ability to &ldquo;enrich,&rdquo; both anything and everything. </p>
<p>I will freely admit, that I am advantaged as a white man by living in a country that is majority white and culturally Western. That is hard to deny, since this society reflects my history and norms. That turning it into a UN style quagmire of Third World grasping corruption and Marxist liberationist whimsy, will eventually &ldquo;enrich&rdquo; me, somehow escapes me. Moreover, since Western Civilization and particularly the capitalistic United States of America&rsquo;s version of it, are so &ldquo;chauvinistic&rdquo; and &ldquo;oppressive&rdquo; why is there this desperate need for nonwhites to suffer through this horror by &ldquo;immigrating&rdquo; here, simply to build up my &ldquo;unearned white privileges&rdquo; and further &ldquo;enriching&rdquo; me?</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s obvious from his words that Mr. Wise, isn&rsquo;t.  The fact of the matter is, the people who created the foundation of this country AND engineered it into becoming the greatest nation on earth   &mdash;   were white.  Yes, yes, we know all about the workers of different races who labored here.  But they were not on the national planning commissions, it wasn&rsquo;t their money that built the infrastructure, set up the government, and created the system of capitalism that made this country the envy of all others.  As for the snivellers who whine that THEIR people never had a chance, well, it&rsquo;s time they GOT that every person is responsible for creating her/his OWN chances in life, and taking advantage of them.  That&rsquo;s how you build a great nation.  What we&rsquo;re doing now, &#8220;levelling the playing field,&#8221; is turning our once-great nation into one of mediocrity and a lower class economy.  Where I live, we have a 12-Step meeting that&rsquo;s entitled &#8220;the No-Whiners Meeting.&#8221;  And we mean exactly that.  A lot of the liberal types stay away - but we&rsquo;re growing by leaps and bounds.  Seems that people who are serious about living well don&rsquo;t put up with whiners and snivellers - on the local AND national levels.</p>

All the founding fathers were white. The original immigration law of 1790 restricted immigration to free white person. In other words slavery was on the way out.

<p>If any of these scenarios (plus a hundred other) ever happened it would not be America.  A country is defined by the people that make it, and the people that reside in it.  By this anti-white specialist Zimbabwe is still Rhodesia, Italy still Rome, Poland/Germany still Prussia, and Russia is still the USSR.</p>
<p>I wish that every white person would move out of America for one year.  After seeing what would happen to this country, they would never probably want to come back.

<p>Is, perhaps, the reason that the multicultists are in a state of hysteria over the Arizona law is that it just might work? </p>
<p>The real agenda of the proponents of illegal immigration is percolating through to the surface: to use the masses of illegal immigrants as a sort of globalized proletariat to overthrow by sheer numbers what they refer to as the &#8220;white power structure.&#8221; It&rsquo;s a reversion to the original Marxist belief that the proletariat would grow in numbers to the point where they would simply displace the capitalist class. What&rsquo;s interesting is that the 19th century concept of a workers&rsquo; revolution has been tossed out and replaced with a sort of a demographic war. But this has the added advantage that because White people are not allowed to be &#8220;racist,&#8221; they have no political capacity to resist. Of course, non-Whites are more than free to conduct any form of racial struggle. And in this, the multicultists provide the propaganda cheering section. </p>
<p>One suspects that comrade Wise and the multicultists see themselves as the vanguard of this revolution, setting themselves up as commissars in the new order of things. </p>

<p>What an ignorant opening!  REDUCED???!!  Perhaps she and others thinking like her ought to be reminded that up until the 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act, sponsored by that white hypocrite of the ages, Ted Kennedy, America was 90% white, blacks were far more humble, and America was a far safer place to live.  </p>
<p>Furthermore, America was 90% white in 1940 and that is the ONLY reason why the U.S. won WW2, and was able to supply all the allies with material for their victories.  The sort of cultural cohesion that existed then is long gone.</p>
<p>REDUCED??  America has been being REDUCED since 1965 using every underhanded method, argument or perversion of logic possible.  And it ought to be recognized as a crime and corrected.</p>

As bad as the present looks, if illegal aliens were deported or self-deported, if the PC-misinterpretation of the the 14th Amendment granting citizenship to their offspring were reversed, if immigration and welfare were generally ended, and freedom of speech and association returned &hellip; then a good deal of pre-destroyed America would revive.

 &#8220;The fall out over passage of an anti-immigration law in Arizona continued across the United States this week with people wondering is America being reduced to a nation &ldquo;for Whites only?&rdquo;   &mdash;  - Charlene Muhammad</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&#8220;America&#8221; (more precisely, the USA) is not a &#8220;nation&#8221;; it is a country!  A nation is a group of people united by culture, interests, and blood.   A country is a place, a political unit, sovereign and more than a state.  One could even call the USA an &#8220;empire&#8221;, which it has in fact become, over time   &mdash;   a collection of many disparate peoples, often totally unconnected except by politics.  But that empire (and even country) is increasingly strained and  on the verge of cracking.  </p>
<p>At the outset, two centuries ago, we were a nation, but that time is long past. We can now barely hold together as a country.  And we&rsquo;re getting more disparate and fractious all along.  As the demands (and numbers) of the Militant Minorities increase, it may be best to have a place of our own, a quiet place just for us.</p>

		<p>It never ceases to amaze me, when these virulently anti-white leftists and anti-white Cultural Marxists try to gloss over the all-important and all-encompassing topic of race and racial realities.  In fact, the vomit-inducing levels of sheer and sickening hypocrisy that oozes out of creeps like Tim Wise and Marty Potock are really an incredible thing to witness.    </p>
<p>Here are a few verifiable facts:   The diabolically evil and nefarious ethnic forces who worked like a team of subversive termites from 1924 to 1965, to specifically and with malice aforethought, to rewrite our European oriented immigration policy, did so because they understand that racial solidarity and racial numerical advantage `equated to increased political power, cultural influence and eventual dominance - for their ethnic group(s).  Since 1965, ethnic lobbies for non-whites have all agitated to increase their RACE based percentage of the USA&rsquo;s population, in a clear effort to increase their political and cultural influence over this nation.   Such increases always,<br>
and I do mean ALWAYS - come at expense of the European majority and Tim Wise and Marty Potock and the other leftists and Cultural Marxists fully understand that fact, and even applaud it.   Plus, these creeps have the absolute and mind-boggling GALL to expect Whites to cheer these assaults on their dominance and influence in the nation of their ancestors?  </p>
<p>Well, guess what?  This clearly proves that while leftists like Tim Wise are busy spewing lies out of one side of their mouths - like their baloney about how &#8216;race is meaningless&rsquo; and that &#8216;race is only a social construct&rsquo;, out of the other side of their mouths - and, judging by their nation-destroying, anti-white, anti-Western civilization deeds - we see a completely opposite reality.   These creeps are clearly race conscious - and promote racial agendas for all races except for people of European descent.     If race really didn&rsquo;t matter, then why are these diabolically evil leftists so consumed with dispossessing the White majority in America  and replacing them with non-whites?  If race didn&rsquo;t really matter - then it wouldn&rsquo;t matter if Whites remained as the overwhelming dominant ethnic group in America - and in every other European dominant nation, would it?   Are there not countless majority non-white nations, where each of these non-European people have their ethnic group running the show and calling the shots?</p>
<p>Ah, but here is the worm inside the liberal apple.    The truth is - Tim Wise and Marty Potock and rest of these Cultural Marxism infected escapees from various maximum security mental institutions reveal by their words and actions that they hate the white race and they seek our complete subjugation to hostile, alien people, people who are unlike ourselves in every critical and measurable way - and eventually, once they have subjugated whites to rule by non-whites, they seek our total extermination.    We are talking about Genocide, as defined by the 1947/1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, as outlined in Article 2, paragraph (c),  Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.</p>
<p>Tim Wise and Marty Potock believe that whites who resist their own genocide are &#8216;racists&rsquo; and &#8216;xenophobic&rsquo;?    Our so-called &#8216;hostile ruling elites&rsquo; share this insane idea, as well?    Isn&rsquo;t it about time we purged every single solitary ruling elite who has that sick and twisted form of mental illness out of power and then keep them out of power for the rest of their miserable lives?</p>
<p>Genocide is illegal, and considered a crime under International Law.   Complicity in genocide is also a crime.    It&rsquo;s time we enforced that law, folks.    <br>

		<p>Post #15, Highduke hit the nail on the head.</p>
<p>Whites must first identify with themselves ethnically.</p>
<p> Race does provide for a degree of bonding, but alone it&rsquo;s simply not enough. Europeans have always identified themselves not by race, but by their historical lineage and national origin. Ethnic identity creates solidarity: I got your back, you got mine. </p>
<p>As  Highduke pointed out, east and west coast European decendents are so ethnically watered down they have no identity, nor solidarity left. Maybe this is part of the reason so many whites remain in a state of bliss when it comes to race. I mean, if they hardly know who they are, where they came from and could care less,do we really expect them to take a proactive role in protecting our European derived interests?</p>
<p>When possible, one should seriously consider marrying into their own ethnicity, thereby preserving their bloodlines and identity.</p>

		<p>The fact that white Americans are of mixed European heritage doesn&rsquo;t seem to me our fatal weakness because &#8220;pure&#8221; Europeans suffer the same white mental illness of inviting their own dispossession. Having mixed with each other, white Americans are in effect a new white ethnicity, and a large one at that, of some 200 million, with roughly the same language and culture – even more if we count white, English-speaking Canadians. Before we utterly lost our way in the 1960s, we were effective at forging a great white civilization in North America. Our potential remains.  </p>
<p>Whites seem genetically and culturally prone to a weaker tribal sense than others. This may start from the fact that whites don&rsquo;t look the same, nearly as much as other races. Then, too, since the ancient Greeks, Western civilization has stressed individuality. Before diversity, this was our glory, leading to creative feats benefitting all mankind. Now, our atomized ways are our downfall. </p>
<p>The West lives by rules, and the East by relationships. From the Greek philosophers, the Bible, the Enlightenment, the American Revolution to the present, whites have sought principles that apply at least theoretically to everyone, from slave to king. This led to notions of equality, ultimately even for incompatible aliens. </p>
<p>In contrast, East Asians (Chinese, Koreans, Japanese, Vietnamese, etc.) have followed Confucius, who stressed relationships. Someone close to you, ultimately including your ethnic group, is more entitled than someone unlike you. A stranger can never be equal. By such thinking, the worst shame is to harm a relationship. This led to great order and conformity. In the past, this may have kept Asians from their potential, but today ethnic loyalty keeps their societies intact compared to ours.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the solution? I don&rsquo;t know exactly, but it seems the more whites lose, the more we simply MUST turn to each other. Who will care about our fate if not ourselves? Whatever European mix you are, whatever your politics, whether you feel bound to fellow whites or not, non-whites and white traitors still target you by your skin color. To paraphrase Trotsky, you may not be interested in the issue of race, but the issue of race is interested in you. You cannot escape the racial tension tearing the West apart.</p>
<p>No matter what liberals deserve for unleashing diversity on Western Civilization, even they, in the end, will try to flee. Imagine life for feminists, gay activists and other liberal whites under Islamic, black or hispanic rule! Minority rights are a white Western concept. That&rsquo;s why all liberal propaganda is really aimed at whites. No one else buys it. Non-whites in the West put their ethnicity first, shamelessly. Someday, white liberals will have to admit race comes first. Their very lives will depend on it.</p>
<p>In a way, it&rsquo;s best to face a radical anti-white like Obama now, while some shred of pre-destroyed America limps on. The question is, is it really too late, or will whites seize back their heritage, while they can? No people ever gave away so much without a fight. Personally, I still feel our survival, somehow, must be.<br>

<p>People form the Third World, over the centuries, have created civilisations, and societies, that reflect who they are. And if such people become the majority in the US, or France, or Germany, then those countries will too become Third World countries.</p>
<p>Think of it: the prosperity and technological advancement of the West didn&rsquo;t magically appear, one day. We Whites worked to make it become a reality!</p>
<p>I was raised to be proud of my people&rsquo;s accomplishment&rsquo;s, and I consider myself pretty much immune to all that White guilt propaganda.</p>
