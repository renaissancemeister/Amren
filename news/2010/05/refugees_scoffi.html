			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Copenhagen Post, May 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A considerable increase in repatriation pay for foreigners returning to their native countries has not yet resulted in more doing so</p>
<p>So far this year 70 foreigners have packed their bags and returned to their homelands as per the government&rsquo;s repatriation programme  &mdash;  far fewer than the parties behind the programme expected.</p>
<p>The latest figures from the Danish Refugee Council show a marked decline over the past few years in the number of refugees  &mdash;  along with those in the country per family reunification guidelines  &mdash;  who have returned to their native lands. This is despite the considerable increase in the monetary bonuses offered to them by the state for doing so.</p>
<p>In November of last year, the Liberal-Conservative government and the Danish People&rsquo;s Party (DF) passed a proposal to raise the amount accompanying repatriation from just over 28,000 kroner per person to up to 117,581 ($19,500) kroner during the period of 2010 to 2013.</p>
<p>It was DF that pushed for the change, arguing that it would inevitably save Danish society millions of kroner.</p>
<p>But if the trend from the first four and half months remains consistent for the rest of the year, only about 200 foreigners will return home in 2010. That figure would be less than in previous years, with the exception of 2007.</p>
<p>&#8216;If it ends up that fewer than 200 foreigners return home, then it hasn&rsquo;t been a success,&rsquo; said DF&rsquo;s immigration spokesman Peter Skaarup.</p>
<p>He said he now plans to ask integration minister Birthe Rønn Hornbech why the numbers are so low and discuss what they should do about the situation.</p>
<p>Liberal integration spokesman Karsten Lauritzen said he believed the numbers would pick up by the year&rsquo;s end  &mdash;  a belief echoed by the Danish Refugee Council.</p>
<p>The Social Democrats and Socialist People&rsquo;s Party also voted for the monetary increase for repatriation. But the former&rsquo;s integration spokesman, Henrik Dam Kristensen, said that the number of returnees was not important to the party.</p>
<p>&#8216;Our motive for supporting the proposal was to give those who feel out of place in Denmark a better opportunity to travel home,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>Figures from the Danish Refugee Council are unclear as to whether offering foreigners more money results in more returning home.</p>
<p>The government also increased the monetary and educational incentives for repatriated foreigners in late 2007, where a total of 111 people had been repatriated by the end of that year. In 2008 the figure increased to 206 people.</p>
<p>However, the figure again fell in 2009, as only 138 foreigners chose to accept the money and return to their native countries.</p>
<p>The highest figure since the programme was initiated in 2003 was in 2004, when 267 foreigners were repatriated.<br>

		<p>Why do so many not understand the situation? Third-world immigrants are not coming to the West to assimilate (nor can they).  They are coming to colonize. They have little or nothing to return to in their place of origin, so for many, a monetary bribe in any amount will not cause them to leave. That bribes are being offered in order to get people to leave only shows the total failure of having such a liberal immigration policy in the first place. </p>

		<p>having money in the third world dumps these people come from just means they&rsquo;ll get robbed. They&rsquo;d rather be poor and sponge off of state services in a white country than be very briefly rich in the hellholes their kind have created for themselves. </p>

		<p>That is bad news indeed. Essentially this means that, even if nationalist parties are successful all over Europe, there&rsquo;s little they can really do. What other methods could they use to humanely encourage people to return? Maybe they could just keep increasing the payments and see if a drastic increase would have any affect. Judging by this data, however, I fear it would not.</p>
<p>One thing they could do, though this would border on the in-humane, would be to give ethnic Danes employment preferences, at least in the civil service. If immigrants found it hard to get jobs in Denmark, then they might have more of an incentive to accept a large sum of money and go home.</p>
<p>Any other ideas, anyone?</p>

		<p>While I applaud any program that works,   at the same time it seems pathetic that we have to PAY them a bribe to get them to leave! It&rsquo;s like paying a burglar to leave your home.  Isn&rsquo;t something terribly wrong with this?</p>

<p>Ideas?  I agree with #5. <br>
Denmark is very wealthy.  Life in Denmark has been too easy, too comfortable, too soft. It is a magnet for every Third Worlder.  An economic collapse would solve the problem. Only when the well goes dry and there are no more free benefits or free money to be had, will anything happen. When there&rsquo;s no money and Danes themselves are scrambling for a living, then and ONLY then will they do what is necessary to reclaim their country.</p>

		<p>#11-your comparision only works for illegals</p>
<p>#2, 3, and 7 are correct. The only way the bribe will work is if all welfare is taken away; for non citizens, even if legal, that would be completely justified (this is also the only way Shockley&rsquo;s idea of paying low IQ people for sterilization would ever work). </p>

		<p>Even if welfare is taken away, as some suggest, I&rsquo;m not convinced it would do excessively much. Families would simply knuckle down and strive toward whatever target (5 years, 10 years) they need to get to in order to become naturalized, then the welfare tap is turned on for them and their kids and the counter is started for whoever they bring over via family reunion. It&rsquo;s a small price to pay, really. If it means they&rsquo;d need to move into shared accommodation with other migrants, and/or work (or work more), they probably would, I mean for the most part they&rsquo;re not going to draw the line there. If you take Australia for instance - people are willing to take on menial jobs for years, move into cramped living conditions, and put up with it for as long as they have to, as long as they know that citizenship awaits them at the end. That is the carrot on the stick you need to get rid of, or one of them at least.</p>

		<p>Of course the bounty offered is but a tiny fraction of the lifetime entitlements the immigrants are entitled to by the Danish state.Not only are generous welfare benefits factored in, but one must consider the free education, housing, healthcare etc that is offered - and the fact that these entitlements are passed on to any children or other relatives the immigrant can foist on the Danes.Also one must consider that invariably the homelands of the immigrants are impoverished, unsafe, unhealthy, crime-ridden and corrupt places with no social security whatsoever, so it&rsquo;s not much of a bargain on offer from the Danes.<br>
 The moral is not to bring in third world immigrants in the first place.</p>

		<p>The only possible way for this to work would be to cut off ALL welfare benefits and then offer the money. That might work, possibly however I wouldn&rsquo;t hold my breath.</p>

		<p>Another idea?</p>
<p>Cut welfare, withold citizenship and the offer the money afterwards are all good options. </p>
<p>For those who still stay, introduce a immigration moratorium. </p>
<p>Such is the most humane way to finish this business. The problem lies in convincing our people to see reality. It will mean stressing practicality to those who are squeemish with the concept of race. To avoid the confusing between equal opportunity and equal outcome, there needs to be a revival of patriotism in our people. Using the US as an example, our country became a national power because a man could reach his potential regardless of his birth. </p>
<p>No guilt naturally leads to patriotism. <br>
Patriotism leads to practicality (race realism)<br>
Practicality leads to rational decisions.</p>
<p>As always, we are our greatest enemy.</p>

In China, immigration offenders are kept in jail until their family in their home country raises the funds to pay for a one way ticket for their deportation.<br>
Now that is a true definition of a stick. Offering money for them to go back home?? The West will collapse because of too much softness or is it carrots. Like Banner (comment5) said, they are there to colonize. Why should they leave when their job is not yet done? A job that will take several generations and decades. Learn from China. Like the saying goes &#8216;a fool and his money are soon parted&rsquo;.</p>
