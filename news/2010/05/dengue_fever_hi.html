			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Gever, ABC News, May 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than two dozen cases of locally-acquired dengue fever have hit the resort town of Key West, Fla., in the past nine months, officials from the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.</p>
<p>Although not the first cases of home-grown dengue in the U.S., or even in Florida, the outbreak highlights the need for physician vigilance regarding this and other formerly exotic tropical diseases, the CDC said in the May 21 issue of Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dengue fever is a viral infection transmitted by mosquito bites. It can be debilitating, but is not usually fatal in otherwise healthy people.</p>
<p>It is endemic in the Western Hemisphere from Mexico southward. Most cases seen by U.S. physicians have involved travelers to such regions.</p>
<p>Over the past 30 years, a few cases of locally-acquired dengue have been confirmed along the Texas-Mexico border, according to the report, authored by CDC researchers, public health officials in Florida, and physicians who treated the first cases in the new Key West outbreak.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dengue is much more of a problem elsewhere in the hemisphere, with an estimated 4.6 million cases from 2000 to 2007 in Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central and South America, according to MMWR&rsquo;s editors.</p>
<p>But the Key West outbreak demonstrates the potential for significant penetration into the continental U.S., they suggested.</p>
<p>They noted that international travelers can pick up the virus in endemic areas, and are often still viremic when they return. In areas with mosquito species capable of transmitting the virus  &mdash;  such as Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, both present in the southern and southeastern U.S.  &mdash;  dengue can then spread locally.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>But  &#8220;international travelers&#8221; would not ordinarily be arriving in Key West! (Other than on private yachts.)  International flights would arrive in Miami, and  other large boats and cruise ships would too.  Not Key West.</p>
<p>The question, then, is just who these carriers  might be?  Illegal Cubans or Haitians arriving in small boats? <br>
Is this something that can&rsquo;t be told?<br>
Since Cuba is known for its effective health care (if nothing else), that seems to leave Haitians under the cloud of suspicion.</p>

		<p>Ah yes, international travelers, could this possibly be just a code word for mestizo invaders? Just another one of the benefits of open borders and diversity.</p>

<p>History of Port of Key West</p>
<p>In 1969 the Port of Key West received its first regularly scheduled cruise ship; it was the SUNWARD.She called on Key West once a month.The Sunward moored at either the Navy&rsquo;s Mole or Pier B facility. Records indicate that between 1969 and 1984 the Port of Key West received 266 port calls.In 1999 fiscal year 415 cruise ships called on the Port of Key West allowing 597,009 passengers to experience Key West&rsquo;s charm, many making return trips to complete their Key West experience.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until 1984 that the City Commission, at the recommendation of City staff, made improvements to the City-owned Mallory Dock, making it a full cruise ship docking facility. </p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Sorry, not in any numbers. Passengers on a cruise ship are not &#8220;international travelers&#8221;.  They are arrivals, they are just passing through. Furthermore, those cruises to Key West out of other Florida ports are carrying almost all American passengers anyway.</p>
<p>There are no international flights in or out of Key West. No  scheduled airlines from Latin America land in Key West. No international passengers arrive and clear customs there.   I checked with the KW airport site, and it states that all international travel is routed through Miami.   Passengers coming from Latin America fly OVER it, en route to Miami, they don&rsquo;t land there.   As far as I&rsquo;m aware, neither are there are any ships bringing international passengers to Key West.  It is not a port of debarcation for international travel.  Even for cruises it is a very minor port of call. The &#8220;Sunward&#8221; which you mentioned ceased operation in 1972 and was a tiny 8,000 tons, a midget compared to todays behemoths, such as  &#8220;Oasis of the Seas&#8221; at 225,000 tons &hellip;.  which  cannot dock at Key West. All of those cruises operate out of Florida or other US ports.</p>
<p>Thus, I stand by my statement that, unless you have a private plane or yacht, the only so-called &#8220;international travelers&rsquo;&#8221; likely to be arriving in Key West are illegal entrants washing up in  rafts or small boats.  That means Haitians or Cubans. Those are about the ONLY &#8220;international travelers&#8221;  who would be  arriving  in Key West.</p>
<p>In fact, &#8220;international travelers&#8221; arive  nowadays by air in places like Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Minneapolis&hellip; and practically everywhere.  So why aren&rsquo;t those cities experiencing this problem?  Perhaps it&rsquo;s because they aren&rsquo;t receiving  <b><i>&#8220;boat people&#8221;! </i></b>  That&rsquo;s my  whole point.</p>

<p><br>
Meant to say, cruise passengers are NOT &#8220;arrivals&#8221; in the United States. They are passing through, in transit.  And almost all are Americans.</p>
