<h1>Migrant Crossings Rise in Arizona</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Olga R. Rodriguez, Google News, May 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The migrants walk for days through miles of mesquite scrub, running low on food and sometimes water, paying armed drug thug &#8220;guides&#8221; and dodging U.S. law enforcement officers along the way. And still they keep coming.</p>
<p>The latest figures show that Arizona, which is about to put into effect the nation&rsquo;s toughest immigration law, also is the only border state where illegal crossings are on the rise.</p>
<p>While tightened security and daunting fences in Texas and California have made Arizona a busy crossing corridor for years, migrant smugglers now are finding new ways through the state&rsquo;s treacherous deserts.</p>
<p>Carmen Gonzalez, 27, recalled seven days and six nights of walking with her husband in the desert and being accosted by Mexican thugs with AK-47s, who demanded $100 bribes. They were later arrested at a safe house in Arizona.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>New U.S. Border Patrol statistics show arrests on the Arizona border were up 6 percent  &mdash;  by about 10,000  &mdash;  from October to April, even as apprehension of illegals dropped 9 percent overall. The agency uses arrests to gauge the flow of migrants; there are no precise figures on the number of illegal crossings.</p>
<p>Statistics from the Mexican side also show a rise in illegal crossings through Arizona.</p>
<p>Grupo Beta, a Mexican government-sponsored group that aids migrants, helped 5,279 people from January to April in the area across the border from Douglas, Ariz., compared to 3,767 in the same period last year, said agent Carlos Oasaya.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the same area where Arizona rancher Robert Krentz was fatally shot in March as he surveyed his property in an all-terrain vehicle. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Supporters of the Arizona law said Tuesday that the growth in arrests at the border didn&rsquo;t spur its passing.</p>
<p>Instead, it was a series of factors, including the discovery of a growing numbers of immigrant safe houses and a rise in crime by illegal immigrants who have injured and killed police officers, said state Rep. John Kavanagh.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, increased enforcement and corrugated metal and chain-link fences dramatically cut illegal border crossings in California and Texas.</p>
<p>Overall, illegal immigration through those two states, New Mexico and Arizona has declined from nearly 1.2 million in 2005 to 541,000 last year, according to the Border Patrol. In Arizona, illegal crossings fell from 578,000 in 2005 to nearly 250,000 last year  &mdash;  before the recent rise.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact is that as long as there remains an economic disparity between the U.S. and Mexico and other Latin American countries, enforcement and sanctions and any other measure won&rsquo;t stop the flow of migrants,&#8221; said Charles Pope, interim director of the Trans-Border Institute at the University of San Diego.</p>

		<p>The article states why   &mdash;   The physical border between the countries is more fortified in CA, NM and TX than it is in AZ.  Illegals might continue to use the AZ-MX border to cross, but thanks to SB 1070, they won&rsquo;t stay.</p>

		<p>Nonsense!  There has ALWAYS been a large economic disparity between Mexico/Central America and the United States.  This is nothing new.  But there has NOT always been the overwhelming flood of illegal immigrants into the U.S. coming to take advantage of our welfare, education, and healthcare systems.  AZ has decided it&rsquo;s gonna stop in their state - so people are coming across now while they still can.  After the law takes effect, illegal immigration will be cut way down.  I still say we need armed military folk all along the border to discourage illegal immigration.  Any Mexicans in the U.S., legal or illegal, who don&rsquo;t like it, can go home to Mexico where they really would rather be anyway.</p>

		<p>It sounds like Arizona needs to build a fence like TX, CA, and NM did. The new law will return a handful of illegals, but only a fence can truly keep them out.</p>

		<p>It is very suspicious that this country is number one in military might and yet it cannot even stop illegal aliens from walking into this country?  So who is paying off the White House, Congress, and the Courts?  Strings are being pulled behind the scenes to destroy white civilization.  So far, it is working.</p>

<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a joke if the blacks and Mexicans began an armed conflict in California due to illegals taking black jobs?</p>
<p>The job market is getting tighter and tighter especially on low tier employment.</p>
<p>Wait and see.  The situation will erupt all on its own.</p>

<p>To which I would point out that the U.S. military appears to be about 60%  black and 30% mexican now, so! do you seriously expect the ineffectual blacks to do anything? And dare I say that the  mexicans (spanish speakers as a first language) are likely related to those sneaking into the U.S. NO people, the military would only exacerbate the problem..White snipers with shoot to kill orders would/will be the only effective deterent.</p>

<p>Those &#8220;safe houses&#8221; aren&rsquo;t so SAFE! Quite often the illegals are held hostage, kidnapped, and held for ransom. So that folks in the &#8220;old country&#8221; can ante up some big bucks or their loved ones will end up in the desert with a 38 Super in their head. Kidnapping as a crime has almost totally disappeared in the U.S., except now for the illegal and those that first bring them across the border and then hold them hostage for ransom. And that is just one aspect of the whole!</p>

<p>This is ridiculous. If the USA would simply seal it&rsquo;s border and enforce it&rsquo;s immigration and hiring laws, illegal immigration would stop.</p>

		<p>El Cerotito, I too have long though that our southern border needs to be lined with our military. The &#8220;electronic&#8221; fence only serves to give illegal a camera to wave at as they sneak in. &#8220;Ola, Mamacita, I made it.&#8221; As far as their coming in after the Arizona law, I disagree. As soon as he can, Obama is going to give amnesty and the outrageous &#8220;path to citizenship&#8221; to every criminal illegal here (which they all are), and no one will every stop to do it correcty again. If this amnesty passes it will be the eighth one and the eighth lie - &#8220;oh, this is the last one.&#8221; We will soon have to press 2 for English.</p>

<p>Dan, the American government is fully behind this invasion.</p>
<p>The mexican government is only doing what the American government allows (and even encourages) it to do  &mdash;  push its least educated, least skilled, least healthy poor onto the American welfare system.  Criminal feral males are especially encouraged to colonize elsewhere to stave off fomentation of another revolution.</p>
<p>Sounds like a good deal.</p>
<p>This is part of a plan to eliminate White Americans and wrest their country from them and impose an authoritarian government (some say this has already been done and it appears to me as well that this is the case).</p>
<p>If the president were working in the interests of the American people, the mexican president would be laughed at, reminded at a press conference about his own country&rsquo;s immigration policies and sent packing.  The border would be sealed by the end of the day and illegal colonists and their government told that any foreign colonists will shot on sight.  Employers caught hiring illegals would face automatic 10-year prison terms and fines of a million dollars.</p>
<p>The hostile, alien US government is not working in the interests of White Americans  and in fact is working toward our demise. </p>
<p>Make no mistake that this is their plan.  </p>
<p>Bon</p>
