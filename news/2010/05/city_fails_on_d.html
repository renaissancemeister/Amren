<h1>City Fails on Dual Language in Schools</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mary B. Pasciak, Buffalo News, May 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Buffalo public schools provide inconsistent, inadequate and inequitable services to students who speak English as their second language, according to a scathing report recently released to the administration and Board of Education.</p>
<p>The city&rsquo;s rapidly growing student population of recent immigrants and refugees  &mdash;  now numbering more than 3,000  &mdash;  has historically been &#8220;largely invisible&#8221; in Buffalo schools, the report contends.</p>
<p>&#8220;The school system didn&rsquo;t seem to notice they were here, didn&rsquo;t think to modify an otherwise successful program to ensure that these newcomers could succeed, and didn&rsquo;t create an effective system to reach out to those communities,&#8221; states the Council of Great City Schools report, which was commissioned by the board.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 158-page report praises the school system&rsquo;s multilingual education department and its director, Tamara O. Alsace, but harshly criticizes the vast majority of principals and teachers who work most directly with students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Students who speak English as a second language represent 9 percent of enrollment, and for nearly half of them, Spanish is the native language.</p>
<p>Hundreds of other immigrant and refugee students speak Somali, Arabic, Burmese and Karen, a language spoken in Thailand, Tibet and Myanmar, which had been known as Burma. More than 60 other languages are each spoken by a handful of other students.</p>
<p>While the school system as a whole has made significant strides in academic achievement in the last few years, progress has been slower for students whose native language is not English, the report says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The report also found that:</p>
<p>o Students and their families have difficulty getting basic information about schools in the system and services available to them because the system&rsquo;s Web site and most of its written material is in English only.</p>
<p>o A disproportionate number of non-native English-speaking students are placed in special education, compared with national rates. Among those who are placed in special ed, an unusually high percentage are classified as learning-disabled or speech-impaired, &#8220;raising questions about the diagnostic and identification process.&#8221;</p>
<p>o Admission to the city&rsquo;s magnet programs and top high schools is out of reach for most, in part because entrance exams are given only in English.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Oladele [Folasade Oladele, deputy superintendent] and Alsace noted that it has been a year since the Council of Great City Schools visited Buffalo. The city&rsquo;s schools have made strides in a number of areas during that time, they said.</p>
<p>For instance, the school system now contracts with a national company that provides translation services for more than 100 languages to help parents with phone calls to their children&rsquo;s schools, Alsace said. Frequently used documents such as field trip permission forms are being translated into the five most common languages. The system has hired more aides who speak students&rsquo; native languages.</p>
<p>And more is in the works. Principals will be educated about the particular needs of these students, Oladele said. The system&rsquo;s entire Web site soon will be revamped and will become more accessible.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The focus of the study is dear to Hernandez [Ralph R. Hernandez, the School Board president,], who was born in Puerto Rico and raised in New York City. There, his family spoke only Spanish at home, but the children learned English at school. He believes that the school system is ready to address its problems, using the report as a blueprint.</p>

		<p>My German and Italian ancestors didn&rsquo;t have the privilege of education in their native language. They had two options: learn how to speak fluent English or face a life of ignorance and poverty. They chose the former. The fact is that, while the European immigrants of the past made every effort to become good Americans, immigrants from crummy Third World nations typically don&rsquo;t. Why should they be allowed to have school instructions in their native language? If they want to speak their native language, they can go BACK to the country where they came from and where that language is spoken.</p>

		<p>The article is basically saying only Spanish is provided for as a second language in public schools.  That they Thai, Mhong, Tibetan, Somali, etc are not provided for.<br>
TOUGH.  I have a solution and it&rsquo;s in two parts: remove entirely the provision for Spanish speaking students, and require that anybody coming into this country SPEAK ENGLISH fluently enough that they don&rsquo;t need interpreters to do routine business, attend schools, or work.  </p>
<p>Next, pass a law that states that if you are not a citizen, and aren&rsquo;t paying taxes, you MUST pay for all services out of pocket or receive NONE of them.  To include hospital and medical care, public schooling, &#8220;free&#8221; garbage pickup, whatever.   </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s high time we reign in the Supreme Commisariat - meaning the Supreme Court - with massive civil disobedience when their &#8220;rulings&#8221; are based on personal opinion rather than constitutional law.  The 1992 ruling that public schools cannot deny services to illegal immigrants is ridiculous.  It has bankrupted city and state after city and state.  Kick them OUT.  And DEFY the commies sitting on the supreme court.  What are they going to do?  They don&rsquo;t have enough federal marshalls to escort all the illegal mexican criminals back to the border.  They sure can&rsquo;t send them to 50 States fed up with both illegal immigrants and Supreme Court rulings illegally pronounced and not based ON EXISTING LAW.  Americans are SICK of the marxist agenda and illegal immigrants.  If our government and courts continue to spit on the Constitution, existing laws, and people&rsquo;s will, then the American people will soon grow SICK of the federal government and courts, rejecting them, and ignoring them.  I&rsquo;d hate to see such a state develop in my country, but when politicians and courts care MORE about foreign terrorists determined to destroy us, and illegal immigrants carrying signs demanding things while other signs threaten to kill MORE of our citizens and officers of the law&hellip;&hellip; than they do about American citizens and the Constitution who they are supposed to protect and take counsel from&hellip;it&rsquo;s time to abolish that government and those courts.</p>

		<p>I wonder why all these people who want to control us have such foreign sounding names? Could it be they are actually foreign interlopers? Here&rsquo;s an idea lets have them use english as their primary, or even better yet their only language. When in Rome they should do as the Romans do or get their whiney&rsquo;s out, and don&rsquo;t let the door smack their backsides on the way out. It is often said that it takes all kinds, when in actuality it really doesn&rsquo;t, but we just have them. Repatriating the conglomerate of ethnicities that exist in this country would be like working a giant jig saw puzzle, even if you only tried to send the illegal ones back. Noah would have had to have at least quadrupled the cubits to get two of each on board the ark.</p>

<p>I disagree right from the start with the entire position of this report.  They are approaching  the problem from the wrong perspective, in my opinion.</p>
<p>I maintain that if you are a guest in someone else&rsquo;s home (or country) it is up to YOU to &#8220;reach out&#8221; to them, and to accomodate yourself to your hosts, their language, and their customs   &mdash;   NOT the other way around.</p>
<p>Of course, &#8220;Director Tamara Alsace&#8221; would see this differently. The world must be kept open to all comers, and refugees (especially)  &mdash;   the most sacred of beings, should be treated royally.</p>

		<p>I know how all these people can avoid the language problem. Go home! They speak your language there. We are a cohesive nation, speaking one language and loyal to one flag and one country. This is an insanity that will take years to fix if we ever elect someone who wants this nation to be as it was founded.</p>

		<p>   They are in the United States, they need to learn english only. We are not a multi-language country. You wish to learn your native language, then go home. Go back to your native country, speak your native tongue. It is that damn simple.</p>

		<p>My Polish and Belarussian great-grandparents learned English when they came here 100 years ago.  What makes these people so special, that they have to have everything in THEIR language?</p>

		<p>There was some issue with the massive German influx in the early 1800s, but they all eventually learned English because the German influx was not so sustained that it was constantly reinforced.  There also was very little help for immigrants until the time of the Progressive Era (around 1900) when some cities set up special night schools to teach English to immigrants.</p>
<p>There certainly was never any large scale catering to foreign languages like you&rsquo;ve seen in the last 20-odd years.  Part of the problem is that the Mexican invasion is so LARGE in such a short period of time that there is no pause for immigrants to assimilate.</p>
<p>The fault is with rich people, of course, who want immigrants who work for peanuts on their farms and in their factories.  The fault also lies with the middle class who constantly want the lowest prices on everything (this drives outsourcing and the bringing in of lower wage workers).  The middle class is just too darned lazy to cut their own lawns, as well!</p>
<p>The fault also lies with the poor, who are too darned stupid to recognize what&rsquo;s happening. They also try to live beyond their means and think hard labor like fruit picking is beneath them.  Oh, politicians are also at fault because the Dems have the multicultural fantasy and the Repubs want the rich to get richer with low wage workers.</p>
<p>Basically then, everyone is responsible for this mess!  Did I mention the social justice/ racial marxists yet?  They don&rsquo;t realize that without strong capitalist countries, there is no more mass food production, no more medical advancements, no more disaster relief at a moment&rsquo;s notice and no more Ipods and internet (or reliable electricty, etc.)  Marxism has only brought misery wherever it took root.</p>
