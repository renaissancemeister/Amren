<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a first-ever comprehensive study of America&rsquo;s large metropolitan areas, we have found that the United States is undergoing the most significant socio-demographic change since the huge wave of immigrants in the early 20th century</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cities and large metropolitan areas are leading this transformation and may, in many ways, determine the path forward. America&rsquo;s 100 largest metropolitan areas already account for two-thirds of our population and generate 75 percent of our gross domestic product.</p>
<p>But we are growing rapidly. Our population exceeded 300 million in 2006, and we are on track to hit 350 million in the next 15 years.</p>
<p>What will America and its cities look like in 2025? Who will these 50 million new Americans be? Based on our new analysis, America will probably be older, more diverse, more urban  &mdash;  and less equal.</p>
<p>Racial and ethnic minorities accounted for 83 percent of our population growth this last decade. We are well on the way to becoming a majority-minority society.</p>
<p>America in 2025 may also be significantly older. The number of seniors and boomers already exceeded 100 million this past decade.</p>
<p>{snip} Yet, if we continue as today, we could be living in a far less competitive and equitable society.</p>
<p>Today, whites and Asians are more than twice as likely to hold a bachelor&rsquo;s degree as blacks and Latinos, and young people are lagging. Low-wage workers saw real hourly earnings decline by 8 percent this decade; high-wage workers saw wages rise by 3 percent.</p>
<p>Should these trends continue, America in 2025 may have cities that can&rsquo;t support their aging citizens; transportation infrastructure ill-equipped to meet the needs of young or old, and a gap between rich and poor that could grow with our population.</p>
<p>We could be living in a less prosperous society. Indeed, our national prosperity in 2025 might depend on whether we master this demographic change and leverage its possibilities in two fundamental ways.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Consider that in our greater metropolitan areas, 70 percent of older Americans now live in suburbs, which were not designed for aging populations. For the first time, the majority of the nation&rsquo;s poor now also live in suburbs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yet, overall, the United States is a demographically blessed nation. Our competitors in Europe and Asia are either growing slowly, as in Japan and China; or actually declining, as in Germany and Russia.</p>
<p>In a fiercely competitive world, demographic transformation may be America&rsquo;s ace in the hole.</p>

		<p>The more we demographically become a third world country, the more socially and economically we will become a third world country.</p>
<p>The Bell Curve distribution for cognitive traits makes third world populations non competitive.  In Africa, in some countries the average IQ is near or below the level of retardation.  No way do you get a  productive society out of that, and the propensity towards crime and violence is high.</p>
<p>Crime and corruption will take over, and the educational standards necessary for a high tech society based on science, engineering, and medicine will falter.</p>
<p>Instead of blaming lesser cognitive abilities of society for the drop in productivity and achievement, the forces of political correctness will blame democratic capitalism, and demand honestly achieved wealth be redistributed as a way to raise living standards for a no longer productive or capable society.</p>

		<p>First, Katz and Rodin tell us the bad news.  But then they try to convince us that it&rsquo;s not so bad at all, with this chirpy closing line:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;In a fiercely competitive world, demographic transformation may be America&rsquo;s ace in the hole.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s it going to be?  The third-world Soviet America they describe in the dire remainder of the article, or the &#8220;demographically blessed&#8221; wonderland they try to leave in our memory by the end?</p>
<p>Typical liberal schizophrenia.  &#8220;Everything&rsquo;s falling apart, but it&rsquo;s all okay, because Diversity Is Our Strength.&#8221;</p>

		<p> Note the tone of the piece: Races and cultures are interchangeable; it doesn&rsquo;t matter what color America is, as long as it&rsquo;s economically healthy and &#8220;equitable,&#8221; which presumably means, &#8220;We&rsquo;re all poor together.&#8221;</p>
<p> Katz and Rodin obviously have disregarded the fact that Europeans very largely created and built this country. That their numbers are shrinking steadily toward minority status doesn&rsquo;t simply mean that the faces behind the counters, in the factories and behind the office computers will be darker than they were before. This is a profound, dismaying (to White Nationalists) sea change which we see beginning to sweep over America. It will be a different, and I think a lesser America, than the one we grew up in and loved.</p>
<p> Let&rsquo;s face it: When liberals like Katz and Rodin use phrases like &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform,&#8221; that&rsquo;s simply Leftspeak for, &#8220;Eradicate the White race more quickly and efficiently.&#8221;</p>

<p>Can we really take these two fools seriously, when they cannot even get their facts straight? The one country in the world that is on the verge of a dramatic demographic downslide, is Japan. It has the oldest population in the world and one child is the family norm, if any at all; by the 2025 to 2050 period Japan&rsquo;s population will have begun to move toward under 100 million from it&rsquo;s current 125 million. Of course, this will be a somewhat manageable problem, since the &ldquo;blessings&rdquo; of diversity and all the &ldquo;strengths&rdquo; that come with it, will be about as common as deep fried sushi. </p>
<p>On the other hand, when the Comrades Katz and  Rodin observer that:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a fiercely competitive world, demographic transformation may be America&rsquo;s ace in the hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They are wantonly ignoring the positives that a country like Japan might enjoy, even if its population growth is reversed. Or put another way, all &ldquo;growth&rdquo; is not good. For example if I grow my bank account by $300 dollars that is normally good; however, if I do so by putting on 300 lbs to gain each of those dollars in a bet, that would be rather abominable. The increased coasts in: health, clothing, food, etc. that would be incurred, would far outweigh any quick monetary &ldquo;gains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Enough said, other than, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Not a very good article for the info - there was a much better representation on NPR, Market Place or some such, spelling out that due to the rising minority population and their lower college graduation rates, that we&rsquo;ll have fewer college graduates. /This/ article is supremely mealy-mouthed about it. </p>

		<p>The country, as it is now, is finished.  The idealogical and racial divide will continue to expand.  The use of racial identity politics by the Democrats for the last 40 years has convinced most blacks and latinos that they aren&rsquo;t Americans at all but their own seperate nation within the US.  The US will break up during this century, I am positive of this.  The US won&rsquo;t be alone in the upheaval to come as Europe will explode into a shooting war between native Europeans and the Muslim invaders, much like the wars in Yugoslavia but on a continental scale.   </p>

		<p>Unfortunately the politicians will refused to see these outcomes<br>
because of the fear of being branded a racist, a nazi, and a<br>
right wing nut by the mass media. With regrets most American<br>
watch, and believes everything that comes from the blue tube.<br>
We are so conditioned not to admit what our eyes, and senses<br>
really tells us. The cities with its growing unemployment<br>
because of people whom for generations have live off government<br>
handouts, unemployable because lacking of skills, and cannot<br>
get non skilled jobs because they have been taken by the<br>
immigrants whom work for lower wages, with harsh conditions.<br>
All this did not need to happened, because it was deliberately<br>
planned by the ruling elite whom controls the large financial<br>
and credit institutions. They buy off the politicians, and<br>
if the politicians do not go along, they make sure they are<br>
defeated in the next election.<br>
The Elite want three classes, the very wealthy, a small<br>
middle class that will comprises the police, and the <br>
military, and the very poor whom will fight for every<br>
crumb just to stay alive.</p>

<p>What does this mean? How does replacing our population with non-whites, and having a majority of the population as elderly result in any sort of benefit?</p>
<p>&gt;For the first time, the majority of the nation&rsquo;s poor now also live in suburbs.</p>
<p>Yes, thanks to subsidized housing and the fact that inner cities have turned into disaster zones.</p>

		<p>A &#8220;cognitive&#8221; portrait of OUR ever more needy population resulting from an immigration-driven demographic transformation: </p>
<p>America&rsquo;s under-5-year-old population is now 47 percent minority, with Latinos the fastest-growing segment. By age 2 or 3, Latinos are already six months behind whites on cognitive tasks, such as assembling puzzles. The achievement gap is four years by the 12th grade. </p>
<p>Institutional failure of the entire educational system is assured short of a dramatic rethink of both our allegiance to single-payer (government-run) schooling and to low-skilled immigration. </p>

<p>Correct me if I&rsquo;m worng, please, but doesn&rsquo;t this mean that some day our nation will be  a mere 17% white?</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet, overall, the United States is a demographically blessed nation. Our competitors in Europe and Asia are either growing slowly, as in Japan and China; or actually declining, as in Germany and Russia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though they are right about negative population growth being a very bad thing, they are totally wrong about our massive population growth being better than the slow growth they see Chhina and Japan as having. I must note, however, that Japan is not &#8220;growing slowly&#8221;, rather their population is declining just loike that of Russia and Germany.</p>

		<p>Without all the post 1965 immigration we would have reached a population equilibrium.  The white percentage may have fallen a bit and the black and Puerto Rican percentage would have increased a bit but overall we would have remained an overwhelmingly white nation.  Without all the newcomers we could have had a real chance at integrating the black population into the mainstream.  If we had kept our manufacturing base alive that alone would have allowed us to have a productive, rather than affirmative action/government worker, black middle class.  When I was a kid the migrant workers who picked crops were Puerto Ricans who came up the coastal states, not Mexicans like today.  The professional classes would have remained largely white, but with a steady state population gradually the most talented blacks and Puerto Ricans would have become more accomplished based on their real abilities.  There have always been black doctors. teachers, lawyers, nurses, engineers, etc.. well before affirmative action.  But rather than work out our existing minority problems we decided to add 100 million poor third worlders.  The only hope for the white race is if a large country, like Russia or the Ukraine decide to take in white immigrants to perk up their populations.   The US has so many third worlders in every state that prospects for us are dim here at home.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve never understood why overpopulation is considered a good thing. It creates shortages of resources such as water, space,food,money,jobs, not to mention rental property, used vehicles andmany other things most people never think about. It also drives down wages and raises the price of all goods and services, as well as taxing infrastructures of all stripe.</p>
<p>Until the late 60s we had a managable, largely racially homogenous population. This was easily the peak of our standard of living and as our population has grown our standard of living has progressively diminished.</p>

		<p>Even with all this dismal report and the certainty that America is finished as we know it, there is salvation after all for the white race and other lovers of liberty, independence and freedom.  With the popularity of the states adopting 10th amendment resolutions, secessionist organisations in over 30 states, tea party movements and just plain ole disgust and fed-upness with the establishment elite, therein lies our salvation.  Devolution of the central government, and secession of the states along cultural and ethnic boundaries, to form like Confederations of states along these boundaries.  No national debt, for there will be no United States to expect payment from.  Each Confederation of States begins from scratch, and you can bet that the ones that will not be giving out government handouts, will be the ones from which massive black migration will begin to other countries who will adopt some of the same insanity that has us at this impasse.  The League of the South and their Southern National Congress envision this for the 14 southern states, and their Grey Book is a blueprint for that new nation they are working for.  Once the 3rd National Flag of the Confederacy is the one flying above the new national capital, black migration will begin for elsewheres, and be a blessing for white southern folk and any other white folk that want to come on down and join a true utopian society, amen.</p>

		<p>Well, whose fault is this? White people have stopped reproducing, not just in America but everywhere.  If a people has lost its will to live, nothing can save it. Perhaps liberalism is a cultural cancer that has infected the West; perhaps it is just that the culture has run its course.  More and more whites embrace the idea of cultural decline as a good thing. One thing for sure, is that American ideals will not survive the passing of the American people, and the constitution&rsquo;s days are numbered.</p>

		<p>This is nothing less than an upbeat description of a total restructuring of society.</p>
<p>The question here is, what becomes of poor and lower class whites?  Privileged Asian professional class immigrants of Indian, Chinese, or Muslim origin want nothing to do with lower-class whites.  </p>
<p>If this demographic shift comes to pass, whites will be under pressure to divide themselves along socio-economic lines, abandoning their disadvantaged blue collar white brethren to live outside the walls of the gated communities with the brown underclass.</p>
<p>Stubborn white solidarity, which insists that &#8216;all (white) men are created equal before god&rsquo; cannot be reconciled with this &#8216;new economic order&rsquo;.   </p>
<p>This is why the financial elites hate white nationalists. We&rsquo;re standing in the way of the new order.</p>

<p>That is pretty much a description of Latin America today. We don&rsquo;t even have to speculate and wonder what it will be like. A visit to Brazil, Lima, Caracas, or Mexico City will show what life is like under those conditions. The tiny but very rich elite live like maharajas; the very small middle class just manage to get by and hang on to their precarious status; and the masses scrounge while living in poverty amidst chaos, squalor and crime.</p>

		<p>One thing about the future, it seldom turns out as predicted.  There will come a point where the productive will be small enough in numbers that we can no longer support the third world invaders with the endless social programs they receive today.  It just won&rsquo;t be possible, and with the things Obama has done to destroy this country it won&rsquo;t be much longer before that happens even if the numbers stay where they are today.  When having babies costs them money rather than makes them money, we will see their fertility rates drop dramatically.  Also, as the country becomes less properous we will have far fewer third worlders coming in.  I don&rsquo;t think things are necessarily as bleak as they appear.  Things will get better, but they will definitely get worse first. I truly believe we are close to a complete economic collapse of the country.  As bad as it will be, it may be the only thing that can save us. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Yet, overall, the United States is a demographically blessed nation. Our competitors in Europe and Asia are either growing slowly, as in Japan and China; or actually declining, as in Germany and Russia.&#8221;</p>
<p>For many years leftists have been telling us how the &#8220;population explosion&#8221; is the greatest danger to our environment and to our planet.  Apparently, a rapidly growing population is a &#8220;blessing&#8221; as long as it is &#8220;people of color&#8221; who are reproducing.</p>

		<p>A country IS what it&rsquo;s people ARE.  IF America continues importing poor immigrants that rely on socialized government services for living, America will ultimately become a third world country.  If America thinks it can continue to import low IQ immigrants, and maintain a standard of living, culture, education and productivity that it had shortly after world war II, it&rsquo;s mistaken.  There has been a tremendous downward trend for the American white middle class families over the last 45 years (it began with the the Kennedy/Johnson administrations), and it&rsquo;s not getting any better.</p>

		<p>I have to say I disagree with the conclusions of this article.</p>
<p>The first thing to understand is there is plenty of room in the United States.  We are not forced by lack of resources to inhabit the same niche as non-whites.  We do so by choice.  The last several decades have been spent shielding whites from the realization that it is a BAD choice and brainwashing people into thinking there is no choice.  Both of these manipulations are breaking down now because we are no longer able to compensate for the fact that they are not in line with reality.</p>
<p>And that reality is that non-whites are supporting their numbers off the labor of whites.  Further, if whites did not support them, they are disinclined to support themselves.  The amount of labor involved is so large that whites are not able to raise families and reproduce ourselves.  It is an unsustainable situation that is now collapsing.  As it collapses, the solution will be forced upon us.  Violence will force whites to live separately.  A break down of our insitutions will limit our governments ability to have a say in this.  Unemployment will drastically change people&rsquo;s attitudes towards welfare (especially foriegn aid) and taxes.</p>
<p>In short, tolerance of non-whites and the attitude of giving to non-whites will become immensely unpopular.  As that giving dries up, so will their reproduction as they will absolutly not take up that slack for their own upkeep.  As is repeatedly seen in africa, they will choose death by starvation rather than pick up a farming implement.</p>
<p>The US is lucky.  We have the room to live separate once the inclination becomes widespread.  Europe does not.  As the pressure builds in the EU and eastern europe, I suspect much more drastic measures will result.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s their business, not ours.</p>

		<p>@&ldquo;Racial and ethnic minorities accounted for 83 percent of our population growth this last decade. We are well on the way to becoming a majority-minority society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;Correct me if I&rsquo;m worng, [sic] please, but doesn&rsquo;t this mean that some day [sic] our nation will be a mere 17% white?&#8221;</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not how math works. All it means is that nonwhites accounted for 83 percent of the growth over the last decade. Using different algorithms, one might be able to estimate ethnic percentages into the future, especially if the same trend remains identical over the next decade. But the numbers and variables are a bit more complicated than merely subtracting 83 from 100.</p>

<p>If our &#8220;leaders&#8221; have a plan, I think that is pretty much it. Try to demographically change our nation into a nation of third world peasent types, mostly latino but various asian minorities as well, the vast bulk of whom theoretically, who will work uncomplainingly for 6 or 7 bucks an hour to make American products and services more profitable due to lower labor costs. </p>
<p>These new workers will also be loyal serfs supporting the new american regeime as they are dependent on the government for free healthcare, housing etc.</p>
<p>In otherwords America is trying to basically just become China.</p>

		<p>&#8220;If this demographic shift comes to pass, whites will be under pressure to divide themselves along socio-economic lines, abandoning their disadvantaged blue collar white brethren to live outside the walls of the gated communities with the brown underclass.&#8221;</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t make any sense on so many levels.  If they can afford to live in these gated communities why would they be kicked out to make room for swarthy aliens?  I knew a person who worked for the phone company who made three times what one of those professional &#8220;suits&#8221; made in his high rise cubicle.  If this demographic transformation does happen it&rsquo;s likely White communities will become increasingly segregated and the brown people will live in their own neighborhoods. </p>

		<p>The key to stopping this transformation is deporting the 30 million or more illegal aliens that are counted in our population numbers along with the millions of nonwhite green card holders, foreign students and asylum seekers. We could return our demographics to 1980s levels and reduce population pressures on our nation. If we don&rsquo;t act soon we will be overwhelmed by the sheer numbers.  </p>

<p>Race is more important than anything for most liberals. Perhaps, this is why it&rsquo;s sometimes said liberals appear to have no real principles at all. What they are really afraid of, however, is the black fist, not so much as the condemnation of other &#8216;liberals&rsquo;. They act as if they seem to believe bullying conservatives will spare the hand down on them. </p>

		<p>32 Anon: Not all problems in this country or any other are caused by immigration.  Japan and China have problems too.  But the fact that not all problems are caused by non-White immigration is not an argument that no problems are caused by it.  Does the fact that not everyone dies of cancer mean that nobody dies of cancer?<br>

<p>All economies have ups and downs. You cannot escape the business cycle. The countries you mention are still functioning societies but have far too many people living off the state. And Greece does have a third world immigration problem along with all the usual burdens those type of immigrants bring.</p>
<p>However, in the U.S. we are talking about a re peopling - not just a change in economic systems or tax rates. In general, the newcomers are not as smart or hard working as the old Americans (whites). </p>
<p>Moreover, even the smart ones (like Indians)do not have a civic minded devotion to America or even their own town. Indians network to help other Indians get jobs or government contracts - not to help the USA.</p>
<p>Whites are not guilt free when it comes to sponging off the government. But we are the ones paying most of the taxes and the only ones (at least in large numbers) trying to stop the statism that will lead to a future situation like the one in Greece.</p>
