<h1>New Study: Super Bowl Ads Created by White Men</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sam Ali, Diversity, Inc., May 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A new study released yesterday, looking at 2010 Super Bowl commercials that aired during the game between the New Orleans Saints and the Indianapolis Colts, found that not a single ad featured &#8220;a person of color&#8221; as the lead creative director. In fact, 100 percent of the creative directors responsible for the advertising spots that aired during the game were white. Furthermore, 94 percent of those white creative directors were men.</p>
<p>&#8220;The NFL is diversified, the Super Bowl is diversified, and the audience viewing the Super Bowl is diversified,&#8221; said Dr. Richard Lapchick, the director of The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport at the University of Central Florida, who authored the study. &#8220;However, the commercials that air during the game and the creative minds behind these commercials are not diversified.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lapchick conducted the study at the request of Madison Avenue Project, an initiative led by the NAACP and employment attorney Cyrus Mehri whose Washington, D.C.-based firm, Mehri &amp; Skalet, has been investigating claims of race discrimination in the world of advertising. In 2009, Madison Avenue Project uncovered a decades-long pattern of racial discrimination in New York&rsquo;s City&rsquo;s major advertising agencies.</p>
<p>Lapchick said the content of the spots that aired during the game was also quite revealing. &#8220;This year&rsquo;s crop of advertisements managed to depict some women in an antagonistic manner featuring a number of ads portraying men attempting to appease their overbearing girlfriends,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There was also an astonishing lack of minorities featured as main characters in the advertisements.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of the 67 ads that aired, only four featured a Black, Latino, Asian or American Indian person in the lead role, and all were men, the study found.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to nielsen.com, an estimated 48.5 million women watched Super Bowl XLIV, which is more than 45 percent of the total viewership. In addition, 11.2 million Blacks tuned into Super Bowl XLIV, and 48 percent of them were Black women. Meanwhile, 8.3 million Latino viewers (44 percent of them women) saw the game.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lapchick began analyzing the role of race and gender in sports back in the late 1980s and had been releasing an annual Racial and Gender Report Card for the past 20 years. Lapchick said the NFL &#8220;has worked very hard to break down racial and gender barriers.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to Lapchick, six of the last eight Super Bowl teams have had Black, Latino or Asian head coaches or general managers and &#8220;positional segregation, such as that for the quarterback, appears to have ended, as evident by the many minority starting quarterbacks in the league.&#8221; Lapchick said that 67 percent of the players in the NFL were Black and 31 percent were white. In the 2010 Super Bowl, approximately 63 percent of the players were Black, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The record of Madison Avenue agencies stands in stark contrast to that of the NFL,&#8221; according to the study. The lack of Black, Latino, Asian or American Indian employees who work in executive or creative positions for advertising agencies has been an unresolved issue in the advertising industry since it was first brought to light in 1963 by the NAACP and the Urban League of Greater New York.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last year, Mehri, along with the NAACP, released a widely publicized report called the &#8220;Madison Avenue Project,&#8221; accusing ad agencies of &#8220;pervasive racial discrimination.&#8221; The report found that racial discrimination is 38 percent worse in the advertising market than in the overall U.S. labor market. In addition, the report said the &#8220;discrimination divide&#8221; in this industry is more than twice as bad now as it was 30 years ago. The report also found that Black college graduates working in advertising earned just 80 cents for every dollar earned by an equally qualified white employee.<br>

		<p>A S/B ad costs two megabucks or more for 30 seconds.  When you spend that kind of money on an ad, it better be effective.  That sounds like the archetype of an account you don&rsquo;t give to an A/A black firm.</p>

Considering the limited creativity found in rap videos, one wonders what innovative, provocative, and inclusive ideas blacks could bring to advertising.</p>
<p>If blacks could produce profitable ads, they should be opening their own firms.</p>
<p>Once again we&rsquo;re supposed to believe they&rsquo;re great at something they don&rsquo;t even do.<br>

<p>That&rsquo;s the crux of the problem.  Everyone expects that businesses owned by whites must &#8216;open up&rsquo; to minorities.  Why can&rsquo;t they open up their own such places of work?</p>
<p>If America is almost 50% non-white now, then the non-whites are going to have to start to be entrepreneurs and such on their own.  There is a dwindling number of businesses out there that are all white, and they are not all white because of some insidious plan.  It just so happened that until 30 years ago, America was 90% white.</p>
<p>That was the time when many of the large and successful businesses out there were created.  They are still white only because the social network that brings workers in was in the white world.  No one said, &#8220;How can I discriminate against minorities today?&#8221;</p>
<p>What civil rights people really need to be looking at is how neither Asians nor Latinos give jobs to blacks.  How about that!  Since Latinos will be the majority in 25 years, shouldn&rsquo;t the Al Sharpton and white liberal lib crowd get a jump on this problem?</p>
<p>Ah, how funny it will be when future do-gooders try to &#8216;desegregate&rsquo; all-Asian gated-communities by putting voodoo housing projects in their midst.  The Asians will go nuts and put forth all the arguments we used to say for wanting to maintain our safe environment.  Thing is, Asians have more courage than we do, with their Triads and other Mafia gangs, and they will fight back.</p>

		<p>This sounds like a preemptive action to a shakedown. I wonder if some black law firm is going to get the NFL to mandate a certain percentage of minority creative directors if they want to advertise.  </p>
<p>If you want to reach a predominantly black audience, hire a black advertising firm. I guess this would work well for Spinner Rims, Malt Liquor, Menthol Cigarettes, and a few other things. But when your ad costs several million dollars for a minute on TV, you want the best horses in the stable. I don&rsquo;t agree with Spike Lee on much of anything, but with the few films of his that I have seen, there is a fair amount of craftsmanship. The Navy hired him a few years ago to put together some ads and I personally didn&rsquo;t think much of them. Let him stick to film making; commercials aren&rsquo;t his strong suit.</p>
<p>&#8220;The report also found that Black college graduates working in advertising earned just 80 cents for every dollar earned by an equally qualified white employee.&#8221;</p>
<p>If this were true, why don&rsquo;t all of the ad firms fire all of the white guys and knock 20% off of their labor costs. This sounds like the argument that women only earn X% of what men earn. </p>
<p>The assistant editor of Vogue Magazine is a gay black man. Anna Wintour would pitch him tomorrow if this man didn&rsquo;t earn his keep. If Leroy Quantavious Johnson can come up with the next ad that everybody will be recognize for the next 20 years, I highly doubt Madison Avenue could care less what color he happens to be.   </p>

		<p>Somehow, a name like &#8220;Lapchick&#8221; is really hard for me to connect with anything serious.  However, be that as it may, I normally love the Super Bowl commercials, but the ones this year weren&rsquo;t nearly as good as they usually are.  Maybe an influx of new blood would bring an improvement!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve rarely read such racist drivel in my live, but that is to be expected from the blatantly anti-White, Hate rag, &#8216;Diversity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Lapchick said that 67 percent of the players in the NFL were Black and 31 percent were white. In the 2010 Super Bowl, approximately 63 percent of the players were Black, he said&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Lapchick is a hypocritical racist.</p>
<p>He demands &#8216;diversity&rsquo; in advertising (meaning fewer Whites and more non-Whites) but then believes 67% black player in the NFL is OK and black stations that cater strictly to blacks such as BET is also OK.  How many Whites are working at BET?  &mdash;  a station that I, and other Whites, am forced to pay for against our wishes as we cannot pick and choose the cable line-up. </p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have it both ways  &mdash;  one set of standards for non-Whites, one for Whites, but that is exactly what is happening as WE Whites and only Whites are neutralized via Hate Speech laws, Hate Crimes Laws (meaning non-Whites lives are more valuable than White lives), AA enforcement, other anti-White mandates, called Nazis when we object to discrimination against us or White Supremacists and Homegrown Terrorists  when we try to organize ourselves. </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Thing is, Asians have more courage than we do, with their Triads and other Mafia gangs, and they will fight back&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Asians don&rsquo;t have the government&rsquo;s boot on their necks as Whites do and are free to form advocacy groups, speak openly to defend and promote their racial interests, celebrate their culture, traditions and language while we Whites are prohibited from doing the exact same thing.  </p>
<p>We Whites are expected to kow-tow to other cultures to &#8216;celebrate diversity&rsquo; while We and our own unique White American culture are being systematically dismantled and destroyed by the alien elites in the government. </p>
<p>When have we EVER read articles about black-on-White crime like this:</p>
<p>San Francisco Chronicle, May 2, 2010</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Asian residents are being targeted for robberies, burglaries and intimidation by young black men&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet the most vile, vicious, torturous black-on-White mass murders and sadistic rapes are yawned at by the media and considered Not Worth Reporting.  </p>
<p>Whites are not allowed to fight back.  Even the Tea Party has been put in a weak, groveling position by the hypocritical government and media and made to proclaim repeatedly &#8216;We Are Not A Racist Organization!&rsquo; as clearly racist organizations such as LaRaza are not only given a pass by the media but given funding and friendly, prominent coverage.</p>
<p>The government and media consider &#8216;White Terrorists&rsquo; to be the greatest threat to National Security.  The media consider White lives worthless.</p>
<p>We are being set up as a target for non-White violence and to take the full blame when Greek-style riots erupt here, as they will, and for the same reasons.</p>

		<p>Sports is increasingly becoming a black venue.  It&rsquo;s rare to find an all white or nearly all white team anymore.  The trend will continue until all or most baseball, football and basketball teams are black or black/hispanic.  When that happens Whites will lose all interest, stop watching, and therefore stop funding ads.  By then, though, things will be so bad in the rest of the country either we Whites will be mere drones, kept as a ready supply of victims and scape-goats, or have finally gotten a clue and established our OWN nation free of the destabilizing minorities. Or&hellip;&hellip;the race war will be in full swing and we will be fighting for our survival just as the White situation in SA.</p>

<p>Ha! The NFL is technically diverse (cause they have alot of black players), but it certainly doesn&rsquo;t represent the ethnic makeup of America. In fact, accoridng to this very same article, 67% of NFL players are black. And since 31% are white, this leaves just 2% to all other racial groups. So how&rsquo;s that for &#8220;diversity&#8221;?</p>
<p>Personally I think that an NFL team should resemble the ethnic makeup of the urban area it represents (for better or for worse). Also, they really should have to recruit mostly local players.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re forgetting that a country controlled by Asians and Hispanics isn&rsquo;t going to go all bleeding-heart over the black community.  The guilt of slavery doesn&rsquo;t extend to those groups and can&rsquo;t be used to bludgeon them into compliance.  They&rsquo;re far more likely to expunge all section 8-type housing from the areas in which they live.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, in the new America, we&rsquo;re the black community&rsquo;s best friend.  They&rsquo;re far better off in an America dominated by white hegemony.</p>

<p>Of course, that is THE problem: neither blacks nor &#8220;latinos&#8221; (or &#8220;hispanics&#8221; or whatever the hell umbrella they are lumped under) are creative productive people, by and large.  They are, at best, client classes: jobs - or handouts - are provided to them by the white man.  They do not create wealth, never have.  It is this way everywhere in the world, including Africa and South and Central America. </p>

		<p>Lapchick has been busy at this corrosive project for years. Just as the &#8220;Caste Football&#8221; website is the sports equivalent of American Rennaissance, Lapchick&rsquo;s &#8220;Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sports&#8221; is the sports equivalent of the Southern Poverty Law Center. The only difference is that while Caste Football is struggling as a private entity to raise operating funds just like Amren and every other truly conservative advocacy group, Lapchick&rsquo;s &#8220;Institute&#8221; is lavishly funded at least partially with tax dollars as part of a public university. If the &#8220;Institute&#8221; was really true to its name, it would be working to racially integrate American whites into the NBA and the NFL as players. This is where the real &#8220;lack of diversity&#8221; in American sports is painfully obvious to anyone with eyes to see. Instead, it is now using the Super Bowl as a bridge and wedge to &#8220;diversify&#8221; the advertising industry. What&rsquo;s next-the Hot Dog industry? Forward, Comrade Lapchick! Lack of whites in sports is now seen as &#8216;normal&#8221;, while lack of blacks in sports like golf and tennis is seen as &#8220;racist&#8221;. This is just one more sign that we&rsquo;re approaching endgame.</p>

		<p>It would be a good if more non-whites appeared in ads. A big problem for whites is the false perception that we are still a large majority of the population. We get this idea from ads. I really notice this at the mall where 1/3 to 1/2 of the people in the mall are non-white but almost all of the ads in the stores are of white people. Having the race of the ads equal the race of the customers might just trigger a tipping point in white perceptions that society is changing very fast.</p>
<p>Most advertising is for stuff that people don&rsquo;t need. It&rsquo;s easy to absorb ad messages when the characters are neutral like whites. Put more non-whites in the ads and it would be easier to feel a distance from the ad messages. There are more important things in life for whites to focus on than what ads tell us to.</p>

		<p>Have you ever noticed in any charity event where people are giving or feeding, or in some way helping the helpless, you never see blacks or hispanics catering to white needy people.</p>
<p>Just a thought.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, name a clinic or charity named for a black or hispanic.  You can study and get back to me on this.  Do &#8220;they&#8221; actually give and sacrifice for needy white folks?</p>

		<p>I often play a little game while watching TV. It is called &#8220;Man from Mars&#8221;. I imagine I am a Martian watching TV. From this I glean that white people are doofuses; blacks are the wise people. All black couples are married (I pay attention to the fact that black couples ads carefully put wedding rings on the players). <br>
This all comes from Lyndon Johnson intoning that &#8220;We must not only have equality of opportunity; we must have equality of results&#8221;. <br>
I once saw a documentary about the building of the Airbus airplane. There was some kind of engineering problem and at the meeting about this, all the participants were middle age white guys. But, in an ad for, say Boeing, we will see a meeting with blacks attending. As I say, a man from Mars would get the idea.. well you get the idea!</p>

		<p>This makes no sense - as usual. What kind of a nut digs into the racial make-up of advertising executives? Next, who cares? The most talented people are hired to create these ads - if a black was super-talented they hire the black. This is another case of blacks wanting handouts based on race and not skill. Why is it that - if everyone is equal - everyone is not equal?</p>

		<p>15  &mdash;  That&rsquo;s a great point.  I remember an old short story by possibly Arthur C. Clarke in which aliens landed on earth after some cataclysmic event.  The only surviving document of existence was a film reel.  When they finally got it to play, they had what they figured was a mirror of earth society.  I think it turned out to be a Looney Tunes cartoon.  Anyhow, with our luck they&rsquo;d find a rap video instead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Uhh, yes, but we are now Broadview home security. How may I help you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, based on what I&rsquo;ve seen, your system looks like its quite effective.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we&rsquo;re the leader in the home security industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I have a concern.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What would that be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see, based on your TV commercials your system looks like it works really well when the crooks are always white guys, because when the alarm sounds, that&rsquo;s all it takes to get them to run away, and well, I live in a neighborhood where it&rsquo;s mostly black guys who break and enter and take people&rsquo;s stuff. So, I&rsquo;m wondering if it works with them or not?&#8221;</p>

		<p> I have the answer-call up Donnie Deutsch-the egomaniacal ad guy who treated us all to his fulminations and insights on his self-funded, short-lived MSNBC show, &#8220;The Big Idea&#8221; several years ago. Deutsch, an insane liberal, bragged that he hired only women, blacks and jews in his agency because only they worked hard enough to suit him. If he really did hire disproportionately high numbers of blacks, he should win the Lapchick sweepstakes by default.</p>

Those home security commercials have become so blatantly absurd that even Saturday Night Live did a fake commerical mocking them.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t mock the race of the burglars but they ridiculed the fact that these ads only play on the fears of single women with kids who live in large suburban houses.</p>

 &#8220;I often play a little game while watching TV.   I imagine I am a Martian watching TV. From this I glean that white people are doofuses; blacks are the wise people. All black couples are married (I pay attention to the fact that black couples ads carefully put wedding rings on the players).&#8221;<br>

<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting to watch old movies, say pre-WW2, to observe not just the clothing styles, furniture, kitchens, cars, etc., but also the social attitudes, the ways of speaking and interacting with each other. These things just went into the movie automatically, without any conscious effort, because that&rsquo;s how people thought, talked, and behaved back then. It was just simply normal   &mdash;   which is what makes it so interesting. In this way, these movies (and ads) became  (without realizing it) a valuable historical documentation of their times.</p>
<p>But, in this age of conscious manipulation, social engineering and distortion, presenting the world as someone would like it rather than as it is, any social historians in a future century would be seriously misled if they saw every white person back in 2010 with a black best friend, every white housewife has a black neighbor, all family picnics are integrated,  every 5-yr. old&rsquo;s birthday party has one child of every possible race, color,  and ethnicity, and inter-racial gatherings are invariably happy and lovey-dovey.   </p>
<p>If everything was so lovely back in 2010, they would wonder what could possibly have caused the terrible riots and breakup of 2015.<br>

		<p>And yet 100% of touchdowns created by black players. Proving that at least for a select few, it is possible thrive even where there is the most honky &#8216;oppression&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>#22, I know what you mean, with today&rsquo;s commercials showing family backyard bar-be-ques and there will be a black couple and maybe another minority couple along with the white family.  Or a 5 y.o. white birthday party, there will be at least one black, one latino, one asian, and several others that I cannot even recognize.  All these are in family-oriented commercials, that shows us all in loving, multiracial harmony, YUCK!</p>
