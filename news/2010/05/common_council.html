<h1>Common Council Starts Budget Hearings Today</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Leitner, WNED-AM (Buffalo), May 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But, if there is [any wiggle room in Mayor Brown&rsquo;s recommended $460.5 million dollar budget] to be found, Buffalo&rsquo;s Common Council will find it starting today, day one of Council budget hearings.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Administration&rsquo;s has decided not to fill 43 police department vacancies in the new fiscal year because of Justice Departmentt concerns that there are too few minorities eligible for appointment.</p>
<p>That choice &#8220;puts the police department under a lot of strain,&#8221; said Councilmember David Rivera, who is retired from the Buffalo Police Department.</p>
<p>&#8220;(The public) is clamoring for more police protection.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Arrest records, drug use, illiteracy, etc.</p>
<p>Trying to get on a police force now is difficult. First a written test, then physical exam, then strength and agility test, then drug test, then background check, the psychological evaluation, then waiting list, etc.</p>
<p>NO wonder so few &#8220;minority&#8221; applicants get accepted. Few whites can make the grade.</p>

<p>They might as well leave them vacant for good, because by next year they&rsquo;ll be laying off positions in addition to the 43 not filled.</p>

		<p>In other words they&rsquo;d rather have people die than compromise on their diversity goals.  This is not the first time we&rsquo;ve seen such twisted priorities and this is why we call it &#8220;die-versity&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Buffalo has been under a consent decree since the early 1970&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>A couple years ago, they opened up the search for officers to a national level hoping they could increase the pool of eligible blacks. When THAT failed to produce enough blacks, they throw out that test ticking off lots of potential officers from around the country who made their way to Buffalo to take the test. </p>
<p>Blacks on the &#8216;east side&rsquo; are killing each other in disproportionately high rates but our black leaders insist that the city only hire blacks. Buffalos black leaders would rather see blacks killing blacks than hire white officers.</p>

<p>Equally outrageous, our illustrious black mayor demoted two Chiefs of police, one from my south Buffalo district out of political revenge. South District Police Chief Brian S. Strobele was born and reared in south Buffalo and still lives here. He was totally committed to this community. He attended our neighborhood meetings and followed through on every one of our concerns. At our last meeting, a women told of a corner store run by minorities that the owners were dealing drugs. The next day, Chief Stroebele was there with drug sniffing dogs and arrested the son&rsquo;s owner for possession of pot.  </p>
<p>Chief Stroebele is likely to be relocated to another district.</p>

		<p>#5 - It is typical for online newspapers to disable commentary when the story is relevant to issues of race, because they&rsquo;d rather the truth NOT be told. </p>

		<p>Why not send some white officers to East Cleveland or Detriot, where they don&rsquo;t have enough? It&rsquo;s not that far away. It wasn&rsquo;t a problem Busing students across town, and they were just kids. Why not indeed? Unless they really don&rsquo;t believe in diversity, or if they do, it&rsquo;s certainly a one way street. </p>

		<p>#5, Is the dimwitted anti-white Judge Curtain still making law from the bench or is he thankfully retired? I still remember him trying to get criminal blacks into the Buffalo PD in the 80&rsquo;s.</p>
