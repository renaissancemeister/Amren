<h1>Interracial Marriage Still Rising, But Not As Fast</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hope Yen, Yahoo! News, May 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Melting pot or racial divide? The growth of interracial marriages is slowing among U.S.-born Hispanics and Asians. Still, blacks are substantially more likely than before to marry whites.</p>
<p>The number of interracial marriages in the U.S. has risen 20 percent since 2000 to about 4.5 million, according to the latest census figures. While still growing, that number is a marked drop-off from the 65 percent increase between 1990 and 2000.</p>
<p>About 8 percent of U.S. marriages are mixed-race, up from 7 percent in 2000.</p>
<p>The latest trend belies notions of the U.S. as a post-racial, assimilated society. Demographers cite a steady flow of recent immigration that has given Hispanics and Asians more ethnically similar partners to choose from while creating some social distance from whites due to cultural and language differences.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Broken down by race, about 40 percent of U.S.-born Asians now marry whites  &mdash;  a figure unchanged since 1980. Their likelihood of marrying foreign-born Asians, meanwhile, multiplied 3 times for men and 5 times for women, to roughly 20 percent.</p>
<p>Among U.S.-born Hispanics, marriages with whites increased modestly from roughly 30 percent to 38 percent over the past three decades. But when it came to marriages with foreign-born Hispanics, the share doubled  &mdash;  to 12.5 percent for men, and 17.1 percent for women.</p>
<p>In contrast, blacks are now three times as likely to marry whites than in 1980. About 14.4 percent of black men and 6.5 percent of black women are currently in such mixed marriages, due to higher educational attainment, a more racially integrated military and a rising black middle class that provides more interaction with other races.</p>
<p>The numbers reflect in part an internal struggle that Asians and Hispanics say they feel navigating two cultural worlds  &mdash;  the U.S. and their parents&rsquo; homeland.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still, many multiracial people  &mdash;  particularly those who are part black  &mdash;  shun a &#8220;multi&#8221; label in favor of identifying as a single race.</p>
<p>By some estimates, two-thirds of those who checked the single box of &#8220;black&#8221; on the census form are actually mixed, including President Barack Obama, who identified himself as black in the 2010 census even though his mother was white.</p>
<p>Census figures also show:</p>
<p>_Hawaii had the highest share of mixed marriages, about 32 percent. It was followed by Alaska, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Nevada, which ranged from 15 percent to 19 percent. The bottom five states were Pennsylvania, Maine, Kentucky, Mississippi and West Virginia, each ranging from 3 percent to 4 percent.</p>
<p>_Mississippi had the fastest growth in mixed marriages from 2000-08, a sign of closer ties between blacks and whites, though it still ranked second to last in overall share of mixed marriages.</p>
<p>_Mixed marriages jumped from 2.25 million to 3.7 million, or 65 percent, from 1990-2000, as such unions became more broadly accepted in Southern states.</p>
<p>_Among U.S.-born whites, about 0.3 percent married blacks in 1980; that figure rose to about 1 percent in 2008. About 0.3 percent of whites married Asians in 1980 and about 1 percent in 2008. About 2 percent of whites married Hispanics in 1980, rising to about 3.6 percent in 2008.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The figures come from previous censuses as well as the 2008 American Community Survey, which surveys 3 million households. The figures for &#8220;white&#8221; refer to those whites who are not of Hispanic ethnicity. For purposes of defining interracial marriages, Hispanic is counted as a race.<br>

		<p>Ah yes, another piece of anti-white screed from the effervescently genocidal Comrade Hope Yen!</p>
<p>&ldquo;In contrast, blacks are now three times as likely to marry whites than in 1980. About 14.4 percent of black men and 6.5 percent of black women are currently in such mixed marriages, due to higher educational attainment, a more racially integrated military and a rising black middle class that provides more interaction with other races.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That there has been any increase in marriage between blacks and whites, more likely reflects the gullible acceptance of mewling white idiots, who swallow the multicultural swill as if it were manna infused with juju. Indeed, trained like Pavlov&rsquo;s dogs, they salivate at the idea of &ldquo;transcending race&rdquo; and then destroy themselves and their offspring both culturally and genetically. I work with a lot of blacks (about 25% of my coworkers) and have lived around them too; they shop at the stores and eat at the restaurants I frequent quite freely as well, but this still doesn&rsquo;t make me want to marry one, or even date one. In fact, the increased contact has opened my Orphan Annies so wide, I have become a regular race realist Popeye: please, pass me the spinach of truth Olive, ark, ark, ark, arr!</p>
<p>As for the lack of Asian and Hispanic miscegenation with whites that Comrade Hopeless Yen waxes hysterically about here, oh what a pity!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

		<p>Actually just last weekend here in Boston, I saw this good looking, in shape White man with a admittedly attractive Black woman with a killer body. Given the fact that most Black women tend to be somewhat or very overweight, this was surprising.</p>
<p>They looked to be in their early to mid 30s. I am 63 years old. They had two children (little girls) with them. You could tell the girls were sisters. They were having lunch in a popular, expensive resturant here in the city. By the way they were dressed,and how their daughters were dressed, you could tell that they were an upper income family.</p>
<p>I was having lunch with my older brother who is retired.  The sight of this made me take notice for a few moments. I do see more interracial couples. I still see more Black men/White women, and more White male/Asian female couples,but the number of Black female/White male couples is increasing.</p>

I&rsquo;ve been searching the web to find information on the rates of divorce for interracial marriages.</p>
<p>Everyone seems to agree that there&rsquo;s very little information kept on these statistics.</p>
<p>The best I could come up with was this:</p>
<p><i>Historically, the research regarding interracial divorce rates has been mixed, and has only dealt with all types of interracial marriage (white-black, white-Asian, black-Hispanic, etc, etc). This is problematic because, theoretically, you&rsquo;d expect different sorts of pairings to have different divorce statistics, just as different sorts of same-race couples (white-white, Asian-Asian, etc) have different rates of divorce. <b>What little data there is suggests that interracial marriages are more likely to end in divorce (13% more likely, according to one study) compared to same-race marriages.</b> However, the interracial factor did not seem to have as much of an effect as things like age when married and education level.</i></p>

		<p>Mixed &#8220;marriages&#8221; account for only a small percentage of mixed couples. The vast majority of black-white mixes produce offspring that are illegitimate. Low-class white women are rapidly mimicking their black counterparts by having numerous mulatto children all with different fathers&hellip; who are nowhere to be found. Meanwhile, white couples adopt nonwhite children even when they are capable of having them naturally. Very soon, race conscious whites will become outlaws.</p>

		<p>Just read some of the comments from the article to see how deep the multicult rot has gone.  </p>
<p>Several common themes;</p>
<p>-I don&rsquo;t care if they&rsquo;re not white, as long as they speak english, assimilate, and come here legally.</p>
<p>-Who cares about skin color if two people are in love?</p>
<p>-Race is a social construct.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Among U.S.-born whites, about 0.3 percent married blacks in 1980; that figure rose to about 1 percent in 2008.

<p>Gee, going by what I hear a lot of male posters rant about on here in regards to how &#8220;most white women marry outside their race&#8221;, I would think the percentage mentioned above would be more like 30%.  Of course I knew better, as this article confirms.</p>
<p>Having said that, I notice that near a lot of military bases around the country you see more white men with black women than the other way around.  You see this trend in some cities up North as well.  Why is this?  Down South where I am from this is very rare.</p>

		<p>Yes, it does appear this concern for interracial marriages is rooted in a desire for voluntary genocide of whites. Notice how every group is examined for intermarriage with whites only? Why no advocacy of Black-Asian marriages, or Hispanic-Black or Hispanic-Asian? Why is the black male-white female pairing pervasive in pop culture and media but you never see an Asian male-black female coupling? </p>
<p>My neighbor across from my mother is a white woman married to a black man with three black sons (the don&rsquo;t appear mixed but she gave birth to all of them). She always used to wear her hair her natural color of light brown and had somewhat fair skin. About a month ago, I noticed she has now dyed her hair dark brown and has been tanning. Perhaps the psychological toll of having offspring that look nothing like her is starting manifest itself.</p>

		<p>I left the military two years ago. During my 25 year career in the armed services, I noticed the gradaul and eventually rapid number of interracial couples over the past 10 years, including White male/Black female White male/Hispanic Female couples.  </p>
<p>What was more surprising to me were the type of White men who were marrying these women. These were blue blooded, mostly christian young White men who had grown up in predominately, if not, all White towns in the midwest, rural south and rocky mountain states. </p>
<p>To be honest, I probably would not have been as surprised if these were White Jewish, Italian and other White ethnic or urban White boys from the northeast or from west coast cities like Seattle, New York, Boston etc&hellip;</p>
<p>It was a perplexing and disturbing, but this was a trend that did take place.</p>

		<p>That more white women are having sexual relations with black men in 2010 than in 1980 is a given.  Same with more marriages between blacks and whites.  Yet the percentages of blacks marrying whites is skewed due to the fact that few blacks get married to other blacks these days.</p>

		<p>I wonder if the number of mixed race blended families is rising?  Last week I was out walking at a local conservation area when a white man/black woman couple passed me.  They had two girls: the older was a blond white girl and the younger obviously a mulatto with orange hair.  I wanted to say to the man: &#8220;you fool!&#8221;</p>

		<p>From my experience, most of the black male-white female relationships have been complete disasters.  Divorce (if they even get married), cheating by the black male spouse, drug use, physical abuse, disturbed children, financial ruin, etc.  </p>
<p>The three biggest losers in the black male-white relationship normally aren&rsquo;t even part of the initial relationship.  That is the community as a whole, the white grandparents, and the children. The community as whole because the white female usually goes on welfare because she can&rsquo;t get child support from the black father.  Also, the children from single parent homes are more likely to cause crime and other societal problems than those children from stable two parent households.  The white grandparents because they end raising the mixed race children and are financially hurt in spending their financial resources raising these children when these resources should be going towards their retirement.  Remember you can&rsquo;t count on Social Security. And the mixed race children themselves because not only are they robbed of a stable two parent household, but they are robbed of an ethnic identity.  This can be very troubling to a child, just ask Barack Obama about this.  </p>

<p>   I&rsquo;m not sure that this is true, but if it was true there is a very simple explanation. Most black men merely co-habit or act as &#8220;baby daddy&rsquo;s&#8221; to white women. Most of their children are born out of wedlock like most black children. It&rsquo;s possible that the married ones tend on average to be more educated and committed to their relationships.</p>

		<p>Fact: Whites marry outside of their race less than any other racial group in the US.</p>
<p>Regardless, our percentage of the population is shrinking like never before.  Something has to be done, but it can&rsquo;t be unless the majority of the population wakes up OR(and perhaps this would be an easier alternative) all race concious whites make an effort to concentrate their numbers in a very, very small area of America and then begin to reproduce like the Amish and keep their children &#8216;within the church&rsquo;, so to speak just as much.</p>

<p>Actually, the opposite is true.  Black-female White-male couples have a lower divorce rate than white couples while Black-male White-female couples have a higher divorce rate than white couples.</p>
<p>According to the study I&rsquo;m quoting from non-white females married to white males have a lower divorce rate than white couples (or a similar divorce rate to white couples) while non-white males married to white females have a higher divorce rate than white couples.</p>

<p>&gt; May I add to your list?</p>
<p>Black men get more jobs due to AA than white men, just as more white women get more jobs, especially government jobs, than white men.  This is an intentional set up to create more mixed marriages.</p>
<p>As another poster on a subject last week wrote, and as I have written before; the major impact of Obama&rsquo;s health care reform is that it will force medical schools to increase black recruitment.  I am taking some classes at our local community college and I notice that many in the Protected Groups have the attitude that they are entitled to passing grades regardless of how badly they perform or even show up for class because they have Protected Group status.  Not only will this produce more minority and especially black doctors, but they will be less competent.</p>
<p>They deconstruction of America is becoming epic, and it is not limited to just America.  Future historians (if there are any) will write about the fall of the Modern West just as voluminously as the fall of Rome.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Melting pot or racial divide? &#8220;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to answer that question straight out.</p>
<p>When that term was coined, it pertained to different European nations and cutlures, not the entire world&rsquo;s.  AND - yes, we are a nation of immigrants, no one denies that.  What is a legitamate question is proportions and common sense limits where such great potential cultural clashes exist, like Sharia law as part of a culture, or some Hindu practices, for example, and the refusal of those cultures to change while insisting that Americans change for them.  </p>
<p>It is simple math and common sense that after a certain percentage, the host population is overwhelmed and fundamentally changed.  I cannot decide how much of this open border immigration support is based on a conceit that America is so great that it can absorb large populations in short periods of time and still remain American, and/or that this is really a sinister leftest plot combined with capitalistic greed and political expediency.  But I do think that there is plenty of blame to go around.</p>
<p>I have been boycotting Mexican restaurants for some years now.  I will not patronize any business that I see is hiring lots of immigrants.  Even white ones tend to hate Americans.  I have listened to them talk about it.  We cannot survive with so many in our country who have not desire to be Americans, but are solely here for benefits because our government is waging war on us.</p>
<p>This is why the situation in Arizona is so important.  We need leaders who are on our side.</p>

		<p>Some comments from the mulatto again. Interracial marriages were not as common where I used to live, yet every other mulatto I&rsquo;ve met, including my cousins (bizarrely, both of my white aunts also married black men), came from dysfunctional families, with the exception of one aunt who remarried to a white man. My father was apparently a gross exception, but that doesn&rsquo;t change the obvious cultural identity crisis that all mulattoes WILL experience.</p>
<p>That said, it still confounds me to this day, living in NYC and seeing it much more often, why white women do this, and it makes me cringe every time (especially if there are children involved, although this fortunately seems to be rare). Being in contact with a large black population for the first time in my life quickly made me realize how different they are culturally. Why do so many white people want to give up their own culture so much? Is it some kind of trend because they think they&rsquo;re too dull and want to be more &#8220;exotic&#8221; or is it brainwashing-induced white guilt?</p>
<p>When I was a child, I used to be jealous of the immigrant children for having an &#8220;exotic foreign culture&#8221; while I didn&rsquo;t get anything because I was just American. The diversity propaganda directed towards children obviously had something to do with that. Only recently have I realized that Americans DO have a culture, one that is rapidly disappearing as immigrants outnumber the actual Americans. Now, if only I could get people to believe I&rsquo;m an actual American instead of constantly being assumed to be foreign and asked &#8220;where I&rsquo;m from&#8221;. And the melting pot has achieved what kind of benefits exactly?!</p>

		<p>In countries with mixed populations, Whites and lighter skins get the attention and the advantages.  Thus has it always been.  And one day this Western fad of mixing will end.  When it does, there will be much weeping and many regrets.  The miscegenating Whites will look at their non-White spouses and mixed children and suddenly wonder what they have done to themselves, all in the name of fashion.  Their guilt and shame will run very deep and know no end.</p>

		<p>Anne,  yours is an intelligent and very well written post. I can sympathize with your cultural dilemma.  But take comfort from the fact that I, a white male also living in New York City, have often been asked &#8220;where I&rsquo;m from&#8221; (assuming that I&rsquo;m some kind of foreigner; I&rsquo;ve been asked how&rsquo;s the weather back in Toronto! Or when I&rsquo;m going back to England.)  The concept here is that everyone is from somewhere else.  And if you&rsquo;re white, you can&rsquo;t possibly be a New Yorker. I&rsquo;ve been asked what was my name before I changed it! [I was born with it.]  It&rsquo;s just very hard for many people to grasp that you&rsquo;re an American, and that you&rsquo;ve ALWAYS been here. They find that amazing, almost incredible. It&rsquo;s outside their scope of  understanding. They don&rsquo;t have very much experience with Americans. Frankly, we&rsquo;ve become an oddity. The only &#8220;Americans&#8221; they&rsquo;ve seen are in the movies. They don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re real.</p>

<p>Some years ago, I read a statistic that White male-Black female marriages ended in divorce at the White-White rate, and White-female Black male marriages ended in divorce at 1/2 the White-White rate. </p>
<p>  &mdash;  - To #7   &mdash;   The other half probably ends in murder.</p>

		<p>29 Ted - If by that you mean you don&rsquo;t believe a mulatto would post here, sorry I can&rsquo;t offer any proof, but I don&rsquo;t have any incentive to troll AmRen. I identify with white culture because it&rsquo;s what I was raised with, but I consider mulatto a distinct race and I won&rsquo;t call myself anything else. I had the same &#8220;racial awakening&#8221; I&rsquo;ve seen many posters here mention: I was colorblind until I left my sheltered majority white and asian city. I have a white friend still living there who gets offended whenever I make comments about the horrible behaviors I observe of blacks. But I don&rsquo;t approve of my mulatto cousin dating white guys, either. I obviously can&rsquo;t speak for all mulattoes but I wanted to share an inside perspective of miscegenation.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think the perpetrators will feel or know any remorse, but their descendents will.  Sad to say.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>It was once the custom in the British Empire to identify &#8220;White&#8221;, &#8220;Black&#8221;, and &#8220;Coloured&#8221;   &mdash;   as they did  in the West Indies.  I don&rsquo;t know why it never caught on in North America. That system still prevails in South Africa today, but (alas) I think it&rsquo;s faded elsewhere in favor of the more rigid American system of forcing everyone into arbitrary definitions of either black or white.</p>
<p>There really should be a third category. The British system was better   &mdash;   more realistic and more humane.</p>
