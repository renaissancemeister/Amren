			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jana Winter, Fox News, May 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An elementary school principal in Michigan is under investigation for authorizing a field trip last week for 30 black students to meet with an African-American rocket scientist. Students who are not black were excluded from the outing  &mdash;  a possible violation of a state law that bans racial favoritism in public schools. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The principal, Mike Madison, who is black, said the trip was part of an effort to close the achievement gap between black and white students. But some parents whose children were not included say it clearly was illegal.</p>
<p>The controversy began last week when the 30 students, members of an African-American academic support group, were taken to hear the rocket scientist, Alec Gallimore, speak at the University of Michigan, where he is an aerospace engineering professor and propulsion lab director.</p>
<p>The goal of the trip, Madison said, was to close test score gaps and inspire the students to consider careers in the sciences.</p>
<p>But parents of students who were excluded protested, and the children who went on the trip were booed by their classmates when they returned to school.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But district spokeswoman Liz Margolis said that bridging the gap in test scores between white and black students was a serious issue that legitimized the trip. Plus, she said, the field trip was paid for by a private donation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>I think the law in question is the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative (MCRI), passed in 2006 with the help of both the Michigan CofCC, and passed with 56% on a vote in a day and in a state where the only Republican to support MCRI, A.G. Mike Cox, was the only Republican to win statewide.  Incidentally, Cox is probably the next Governor.</p>

		<p>This principal should be fired- period. If there is going to be a field trip than ALL of the kids should be included. The only way that this could have been made fair would be if all of the lower achieving kids would have been taken- not just blacks. I am glad that parents are finally standing up, this sort of thing happened to me when I was a freshman in high school- in about 1987. There was supposed to be some sort of special class to help kids get ready for college boards but when I went to sign up I was told that it was for blacks only. Not only was I excluded I was told in a very rude manner by the black administrator who left me in tears. My parents comforted me but did not do anything about the situation. If you ask me this did more to hurt racial relations than any help with &#8220;closing the achievement gap&#8221;</p>

		<p>How does meeting with a &#8220;black rocket scientist&#8221; help to close the achievement gap?  These people are so dumb&hellip; only they could survive in academia.</p>
<p><br>
I guess the trip is supposed to &#8220;inspire&#8221; the children to do better and thus close the gap.  But doesn&rsquo;t that logic blame the cause of the gap on the children?  We all know it cant be the children&hellip; institutional racism, poverty&hellip; bad parenting&hellip; everything but &#8220;the children&rsquo;s&#8221; fault!!!</p>
<p>I hope these parents sue away.  </p>

		<p>And another thing, one could argue that they are widening the gap by causing the black children to miss valuable class time while evil whitey is in class soaking up knowledge.</p>
<p>It was probably the most peaceful day the school ever had..  On second thought, maybe they shouldnt sue.  Keep the segregated trips up!!!!</p>

		<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter what is tried.  Blacks are stupid on overage and will remain stupid compared to whites.  Excluding whites from these &#8220;programs&#8221; designed to raise black achievement and interest will not raise black IQ or scholastic achievement one single point.  It WILL, however serve a useful purpose.  These kinds of things ARE raising White awareness and resistance and anger.</p>

		<p>If this principal was white he would already have issued a sniveling weeping apology begging all blacks everywhere in all walks of life, even in solitary confinement, to please please forgive him it was so wrong of him and look these are real tears and that he is not a racist even in his wildest nightmares, all of this as he is handed his walking papers and told to never darken er.. not to ever try for employment in the educational field ever again.  </p>

		<p>He is NOT a black rocket scientist. He is a black professor. As an engineer I&rsquo;m outraged. Those who can do. those who cant teach.</p>

		<p>I was interested in what kind of &#8220;Rocket Scientist&#8221; Alec Gallimore is. Here&rsquo;s a description of his duties on his college website:</p>
<p>&#8220;Dean Gallimore serves as the primary liaison between the Graduate School and the many academic units in engineering and the physical sciences. He works closely with these graduate programs on issues such as strategic planning, student recruitment, program visibility, resource allocation, student fellowships and awards, cross-disciplinary partnerships, and climate and culture as they affect graduate students&#8221;.</p>
<p><br>
Sounds very much like what an education major would be doing, not a research scientist.</p>

		<p>Cliff Yablonski your research puts the man&rsquo;s standing in perspective.  It would seem to me as an interested outsider that again the African Americans are desperate to prove that they could have reached the Moon or get to Mars without any help from other genetic races.  As someone who lived in Africa for 24 years and now in mid seventies, I am not afraid to publishing my name as the truth must be about.  The propaganda onslaught against the Europeans (white AFRICANS) in Africa proves that courage is needed to stop the continual falsifying of the facts so keep up the good work.  The failures need to prove themselves on their own efforts not by using propaganda.  It is fast becoming a badge of honour to be called a racist.</p>

		<p>If there is even ONE black rocket scientist who isn&rsquo;t an AA gimme who is just a token black face, I&rsquo;d be amazed.</p>
<p>My math class&hellip;and many others I knew and heard about&hellip;. had a couple begin the semester then mysteriously disappear in about two weeks or less.  That can be verified by thousands of students.</p>
<p>And then to expect people to believe that there are blacks who go even higher into physics, aeronautical engineering, the science of propulsion, etc. is akin to claiming there really is a Santa Claus and a tooth fairy.</p>
<p>This is the age of liars like no other time in this pitiful country&rsquo;s history.</p>

		<p>What I find most outrageous is the principal&rsquo;s bullying of White students. The balance of power between the &#8220;top dawg&#8221; and an elementart student means this was pure intimidation. I suggest Googling for the Ann Arbor school board members, and emailing them why this kind of behavior should not be accepted. </p>

<p>As to all you Amrenners out there who wonder how there can be such a thing as a black rocket scientist, I have an answer.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you know that virtually all black college students are &#8220;taking up space&#8221;?</p>
<p>ESPECIALLY the AA ones, who would otherwise be unqualified for college!</p>
