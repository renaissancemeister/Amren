<h1>Rape Suspect Deported 4 Times</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KTVB-TV (Boise), May 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The man accused of raping a woman behind an Edmonds grocery store has been deported at least four times in the past 15 years, reports KIRO Radio.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to court documents, the woman told police that Madrigal [Jose Madrigal] had followed her and offered her $35 for sex, but she said no. She said Madrigal then forced her into the bushes on the north side of the store and raped her.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Snohomish County prosecutors have charged Madrigal in district court with second degree rape. He is also is being held for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.</p>

<p>Yes, but ICE will refuse to pick him up, because they don&rsquo;t want to upset the community organizer who will denounce them as racists.</p>

		<p>If the media were so inclined, they could make any one of many, many such cases the face of illegal immigration, thereby igniting public outrage and spurring politicians to secure our borders. That&rsquo;s exactly how the left operates, with great success, on issue after issue. </p>
<p>Railway Killer Angel Maturino Res√©ndiz (https://tinyurl.com/3yybyz5) was a good candidate for the role. </p>

		<p>Lefty feminists supporting illegal immigration is like P.E.T.A. serving veal at their meetings.  I get the impression that leftists only object to rape if it is white men doing the raping.</p>

		<p>For those that didn&rsquo;t read the full article, Edmonds is just north of Seattle Washington not in the state of Idaho even though the story was picked up by a Boise TV station.  </p>
<p>Of course Boise, ID has it&rsquo;s own problems with immigrants.</p>

		<p>I went to the original article for quotes from the ACLU and SPLC. Their expertise is often sought out by reporters. Surely they would have something to say about this outrageous crime. How do they propose to keep criminal illegal aliens out of the country? But there were no comments. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;Snohomish County prosecutors have charged Madrigal in district court with second degree rape</p>
<p>It is hard to believe there are varying degrees of rape, what constitutes 1st degree rape? Can the victim testify it was a 1st or 2nd degree rape? I understand varying degrees of murder since so many things can lead to a death BUT!! rape is an intentional, forced sexual intercourse with an unwilling victim! No room for quibbling here, except apparently, when the criminal is non white.</p>

		<p>There are certain types of criminals who will NEVER change or be rehabilitated in any way.  Men who commit sex crimes are among that lot.  I say, instead of simply deporting this man, why not &#8220;geld&#8221; him first?  That way, even if he did slither back into the U.S., he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to commit his crimes of choice.  In fact the incentive to return might even be eradicated if this was done!!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m assuming to &#8220;geld&#8221; menas to castrate/neuter him? If so then I whole-heartedly agree. Why haden&rsquo;t I ever thought of that before? If you&rsquo;re a man, and you rape someone, you really do deserve to have your genitals cut off. End of story. Not only is it an appropriate &#8220;eye-for-an-eye&#8221; sorta thing, but it&rsquo;ll also prevent furture offences being carried out by the same person. And I&rsquo;m no crime expert but aren&rsquo;t a large percentage of rapes repeat offences?</p>
