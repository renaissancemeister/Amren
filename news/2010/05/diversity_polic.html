<h1>Diversity Policy Tossed; Tough Decisions Loom</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>T. Keung-Hui, and Thomas Goldsmith, News &amp; Observer (Raleigh), May 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With the school board&rsquo;s vote Tuesday night to end its diversity policy, Wake County began a politically bruising slog to divide the county into community school zones.</p>
<p>The number of zones is undetermined. The cost of the new system is uncertain. And as the board&rsquo;s majority fleshes out a plan to assign the district&rsquo;s 140,000 students to schools as close as possible to their homes, it must fend off charges of resegregation by opponents who vow to keep fighting them.</p>
<p>The deeply divided board eliminated diversity as a goal in the assignment policy with a 5-4 vote, making family proximity to schools the priority. The fight about the diversity policy, which depends on the economic status of families, drew national attention as the majority reversed decades of policy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Chairman Ron Margiotta and members John Tedesco, Debra Goldman, Chris Malone and Deborah Prickett voted down last-ditch efforts by the board minority to include students&rsquo; economic status as an assignment factor, and ignored student protesters&rsquo; loud chants when the final vote came.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey hey! Ho ho! Resegregation&rsquo;s got to go!&#8221; about 20 protesters shouted.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Changes will likely not take effect on a large scale until 2012-13. But members of the majority say the result will be greater family stability and choice, including better performance by low-income students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Numerous factors, including the state constitution and federal law, prevent Wake schools from resegregating, Tedesco said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Diversity backers vow fight</b></p>
<p>Along the way, supporters of the now-eliminated diversity policy vowed they will keep fighting the new board.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For one thing, diversity supporters will begin to focus on next year&rsquo;s school board elections, said Amy Lee, who has spoken in favor of the diversity policy at board meetings. Five of the nine seats will be on the ballot in 2011, including Margiotta&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Also, opposition to the current board will likely increase when members start drawing lines on a map to create the new system of zones that are to replace the old assignment policy, Lee said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>More legal action possible</b></p>
<p>The board will also have to deal with the possibility of more legal action, like the lawsuit against two prior diversity votes that was dismissed by a judge on Friday. The Rev. William Barber, head of the state NAACP, is soliciting donations for legal fees and seeking out parents who&rsquo;d be interested in being plaintiffs in a potential lawsuit against the school system.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Old policy led to lots of busing</b></p>
<p>Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, school board policy was to promote diversity by balancing the percentages of minority students at schools. A decade ago, the board switched to promoting diversity by balancing the percentages of low-income students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But last fall newly elected school board members attacked the diversity policy, citing poor test scores and graduation rates among low-income and minority students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As the meeting ended, Margiotta, the board chairman, said he&rsquo;s been surprised at the level of emotion the entire debate has caused, given the long history of Wake families&rsquo; wanting more stability in student assignments.</p>

		<p>The diversicrats are desperate to put a stop to this before Wake County&rsquo;s Whites wake up and discover how much better things are without the Diversity gun being held to their heads.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;members of the majority say the result will be greater family stability and choice&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Likely true.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;including better performance by low-income students.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I doubt that anyone seriously believes this, even the marxists.  &#8220;Low-income&#8221; = black and mestizo.  Their performance will continue to be miserable, but at least they&rsquo;ll drag fewer White students down with them, and it&rsquo;ll be that much harder to pin the blame on Whitey.</p>

		<p>What idiots.  These diversicrats will never be able to force most upperclass whites to &#8220;diversify&#8221; their kids and if they keep trying the upperclass whites will leave the area, and then they&rsquo;ll end up with no tax base and completely destitute ghettos.  Then they&rsquo;ll have neither diverse schools or functioning local governments and welfare checks.</p>

		<p>The diversity folks can choose to live in a racially diverse neighborhood if this race mixing is so important to them however they have no business forcing integration down the throats of anybody for forced integration is equally as wrong as forced segregation.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s not to understand?  It&rsquo;s the typical &#8220;you can&rsquo;t win with nor please&#8221; blacks no matter WHAT you do.  They want more stability and schools closer to home.  They already had them.  Then came bussing under the mistaken belief (and their refusal to take poor performance on themselves) that blacks would raise their test scores by osmosis sitting next to white kids.  Never happened.  Dumb down the class then maybe that will help.  Nope.  Throw out tests and test scores entirely.  Didn&rsquo;t help.  The time in our recent history when blacks DID BETTER was actually when they had their own schools.  So&hellip;..the school board gives them what they want, their kids closer to home in local schools, and they are still complaining.</p>

Busing is what largely destroyed black communities. Black neighborhood schools would be a step in re-establishing control.</p>
<p>If they believe in diversity, let them establish a diversity magnet school and let those attend who believe diversity is important.</p>

		<p>Ok, you can only have it one way: either total segregation or total DIEversity. Either complete integration with no set asides, preferences or quotas in hiring or admisstions to institutes of higher learning and no busing OR absolute segregation. PICK one. The latter works for me. </p>

		<p>A reflection on a half-century forced integration (appeared in Education Week in 2004):</p>
<p>The tragic history of school desegregation since the Brown v. Board of Education decision owes much to the lack of imagination of desegregation&rsquo;s anointed champions. Would-be tyrants all, these oft-cited academics and civil rights leaders could conceive of no role for freedom. They know only the logic of coercion: Force flattened Jim Crow, dismantling our own apartheid system, therefore force can integrate society &mdash; beginning with schools.</p>
<p>In the zealot&rsquo;s mind, the failure of school desegregation was not due to their own urgent impulse to coerce. They were unjustly denied sufficient scope for this impulse. The villains were fleeing whites who would not submit to their designs, and a 1974 U.S. Supreme Court that could not find a constitutional basis for ordering busing between urban and suburban districts. This latter fantasy is a sublime denial of the political realities of the time, quite apart from constitutional limitations.</p>
<p>So what happened? Detroit is typical. Eighty-four percent white in 1954, the Detroit public schools are 3.7 percent white today.</p>
<p>Here is a thought experiment: It&rsquo;s the early 1960s. Academics, civil rights leaders, and the courts value freedom. They urge the use of force in freedom&rsquo;s defense, but they distrust coercion absent that necessity. Reluctant state legislators &mdash; partly out of fear that if they did not act, the courts would take drastic action &mdash; give parents the freedom to apply an equal per-pupil allotment to any school they wish: neighborhood, in-district, out-of- district, private, parochial, or for-profit. No nonpublic or out-of-district school could be forced to accept any student. (Of course many schools, such as Roman Catholic schools, were even then gladly accepting minority students). <br>
What would be the racial mix in Detroit schools and in the schools of other large cities today if this scenario had played out? What would be the level of education? Indeed, what could it be tomorrow?</p>
<p>Our grandmasters of social engineering failed to desegregate urban schools. They did not get the giant urban-suburban chessboard they needed to put every child- pawn in just the right configuration. But the human impulse to coerce in the service of utopian aims is as ardent as ever. Social chess masters are devising new projects. These too will fail, wreaking havoc. For their designers still cannot imagine a role for freedom in the critical K-12 years.<br>

		<p>There&rsquo;s going to be a LOT of loud crybaby wailing from the mentally disturbed who want &#8220;diversity,&#8221; but really dont know why, because with shortfalls in revenue occurring in every organization&hellip;public and private&hellip;.the money just won&rsquo;t be there to continue the nonsense.</p>
<p>For those of us who love to see it occur, we&rsquo;re going to go through some very interesting times.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all collapsing on its own, without any of the tea partiers lifting even a little pinkie in opposition, contrary to leftist accusations that they&rsquo;re terrorists.</p>
<p>Diversity, multiculturalism/multiracialism works a bit, but only if times are booming and social pressure and corrupt demagogues can keep their clumsy feet on everybody&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>The ideology is doomed to fail.  All we have to do is wait and watch. </p>

		<p>Frankly, blacks are just pawns in this matter, being shoved this way and that whether they like it or not.  Despite all their loud ranting, they go where they are told and do what they are told. And they are told that Diversity is good for them; it will cure their ills.  Blacks did not invent the concept of &#8220;Diversity&#8221;, and the demand for it is not coming from them.  The same is true with whites as well.  Nowhere in this article or the posts above is there any mention of the powerful special-interest groups who have been promoting &#8220;Diversity&#8221; and forcing it on the rest of us, to serve their own purposes (whether ideological or economic), but which have nothing to do with the interests of either  blacks OR whites. <br>

		<p>1) Not at all!  You see, if they get put in seperate schools from whitey they will claim that they aren&rsquo;t getting the same quality of education despite whether or not it&rsquo;s true.  Much like how the country Zimbabwe continues to blame its problems on whites, despite having killed all of them.</p>
<p>Whereas if they&rsquo;re in the same school and they still do just as bad, more minority only programs and lots more cash are needed to make up for &#8216;evil white racism&rsquo; that is responsible for their ever low test scores.</p>

		<p>I live in Raleigh. This article leaves out some important background information. For one thing, the population in Wake County is growing faster than infrastructure can keep up. That&rsquo;s led to students facing reassignment to a new school every other year, some of them with 90 minute bus rides to get to school, as the school system frantically tries to juggle them around so that all the schools will have the same mix of &#8220;socio-economic status.&#8221;</p>
<p>Parents are fed up with it. Every year there&rsquo;s a massive reassignment, and every year the parents of the affected students complain. Enough parents are fed up that we have elected a new majority to the school board who have promised to end the madness.</p>
<p>The NAACP can cry about &#8220;resegregation&#8221; all they want. That&rsquo;s not what this is about! It&rsquo;s about knowing what school my kids are going to go to next year, and the year after that. It&rsquo;s about not having to wake my kids up at 4:30 AM so they can be ready to catch a bus for a 90-minute ride to school. <br>

		<p>Chicago&rsquo;s schools are an interesting case in the study of liberals and their various cult ideologies.  In 1989 when Daley was first elected he was facing massive white flight out of the city, but he stemmed the brain drain by building a huge amount of magnet schools where order is kept.  But the libs at the Trib kept at the desegregation thing, every year they would put out a three page hate piece on whites and school seg.  But finally within the last few years this stopped when they realized that the  whites had pretty much disappeared from the non-magnet schools and if they kept up the hatred of whites they would be immolating their own children and the children of their cocktail party friend&rsquo;s children. As for this case in NC these lib sadists are immolating children just not their own.</p>

Here in Buffalo, the school budget currently stands at $800,000+. Buffalo spends more money per student than kids in the outlying suburbs.</p>
<p>The failure rate for blacks has risen to 53%.</p>
<p>Busing and money have increased black failure rates but no one of influence will acknowledge this.</p>

		<p>Has anyone looked at that picture in the article?  All White people carrying signs that say protect diversity.  The more I see this sort of thing the more I wonder if it&rsquo;s genuine.  Could it possibly be these are two-faced liberals who don&rsquo;t want their kids to go to black schools either but they have to be careful not to offend their black brethren thus we have this little sideshow to pull the wool over their eyes?  </p>
