			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Gardner, Daily Mail (London), May 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Small towns are raising the stakes in America&rsquo;s immigration wars by passing laws demanding that all local council business is conducted in English.</p>
<p>Jackson, population 1,700, has no shops, no school, no church and is predominantly white with a handful of Spanish-speaking farm-workers.</p>
<p>But the rural town in Upstate New York   &mdash;   about 2,500 miles from the nearest Mexican border   &mdash;   was determined to protect its English-speaking heritage.</p>
<p>&#8216;For too long, the federal government has shirked its duty by not passing English as the official language of the United States,&rsquo; said Council member Roger Meyer, who proposed the legislation.</p>
<p>&#8216;So seeing as this law couldn&rsquo;t be passed from the top down, I felt I&rsquo;d start a grass-roots movement to try and get it passed from the bottom up,&rsquo; he added.</p>
<p>The law designates English as Jackson&rsquo;s official written and spoken language &#8216;to be used in all official meetings and business conducted by the elected officials and their appointees.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Already, one neighbouring town, Argyle, has passed a similar resolution and a third, Easton, is debating the measure at a meeting next month.</p>
<p>It is a world away from the heated debate being waged over Arizona&rsquo;s controversial decision to grant police new laws to quiz people they suspect of being in the country illegally.</p>
<p>But supporters claim it underlines the undercurrent of support for bolder action to curb immigration and preserve the language and culture that many fear are under threat in parts of the US.</p>
<p>Despite a wave of condemnation levelled at Arizona  &mdash;  with Los Angeles yesterday banning all official business with the state  &mdash;  a new opinion poll found that 59% of Americans supported the crackdown.</p>
<p>Even in Jackson, where nobody really believes there is a serious threat of a sudden flood of immigrants, town officials felt it necessary to make a stand.</p>
<p>&#8216;People come here because it&rsquo;s better than the place they were in,&rsquo; Mr Meyer told the New York Times. &#8216;If that&rsquo;s the case, you should be adapting yourself to our ways. We shouldn&rsquo;t be adapting to your ways.&rsquo;</p>
<p>However, the law has put the town at odds with the New York Civil Liberties Union, which is demanding the law is rescinded.</p>
<p>&#8216;The English language is not under attack in Jackson or anywhere else in the state or country,&rsquo; said union director Melanie Trimble.</p>
<p>The civil rights group said the law was a threat to free speech and discriminated against anyone with limited English skills.</p>
<p>Alan Brown, the town supervisor and the only council member to vote against the measure, insisted: &#8216;The law would play to some people&rsquo;s prejudices and I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>&#8216;This law didn&rsquo;t pop up because someone has interest in and sympathy for the fact that we&rsquo;ve always done our meetings in English.</p>
<p>&#8216;What is a human&rsquo;s greatest fear? It&rsquo;s fear of whatever, of death, of terrorism, fear of what we don&rsquo;t understand. We&rsquo;re all afraid of the unknown. My opinion is that this is just adding to all of that,&rsquo; he added.</p>

		<p>Mr. Brown need not look to the unknown for fear, since we all know what to fear, and it is certainly not the unknown which is an irrational fear, rather the obvious and rational ones which are directly confronting us all.</p>

<p>Fine. So now is the time to do this, rather than wait until it is under attack.</p>

<p>Assuming that Mizz Trimble is a lawyer, I only want to know how it is that this nation can produce people, who with seven years of university edjukashun, can make a statement like the preceeding and still keep a straight face.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that the cultural left claims there&rsquo;s no problem with non-English in the little town, but nonetheless wants to make a big stink about the declaration of English as official.  I&rsquo;ve never before seen the level of self hatred that the left applies to everything denoting Western values!  <br>
Jackson has no doubt seen what has happened to towns when invasions of Somalis, Hmongs, etc. have completely changed their living space.  </p>

<p>A tale of two quotations   &mdash;   the first from an immigration opponent; the second from an immigration enthusiast. Let&rsquo;s compare them for logical rigor and factuality; to see who&rsquo;s talking sense and who&rsquo;s not: </p>
<p><br>
&lsquo;People come here because it&rsquo;s better than the place they were in,&rsquo; Mr Meyer told the New York Times. &lsquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, you should be adapting yourself to our ways. We shouldn&rsquo;t be adapting to your ways.&rsquo;</p>
<p><br>
The above is not only correct, but irrefutable. Now let&rsquo;s hear the other side of the argument: </p>
<p><br>
&lsquo;What is a human&rsquo;s greatest fear? It&rsquo;s fear of whatever, of death, of terrorism, fear of what we don&rsquo;t understand. We&rsquo;re all afraid of the unknown. My opinion is that this is just adding to all of that,&rsquo; he added.</p>
<p><br>
Vaporous, sophomoric pseudo-profundities. Not to mention quite seriously &#8220;off-topic&#8221;. Nothing but bizarre, irrelevant meanderings about Life and Death and The Unknown when the subject is supposed to be the propriety or impropriety of English-only laws in his small NYS town. Rooted in feeling, not in thinking. And, by the speaker&rsquo;s own admission, &#8220;opinion&#8221; rather than fact. </p>
<p>And it is this nebulous feel-good drivel to which the newspaper gives &#8220;the last word&#8221; in the article. <br>

		<p>It must be a tiny town indeed.  I live in NY State and have never heard of it. I couldn&rsquo;t even find it in the Rand McNally atlas. Nor on Expedia maps. No such place!  I was about to conclude that it didn&rsquo;t exist and the Daily Mail had invented the whole story (which British tabloids arwill do on a slow day), when I finally found it on Google.  Yes, it exists.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mere speck of a town on the border of Vermont, in just about the last region of America that&rsquo;s going to get invaded. I don&rsquo;t know what industries or economic attractions they have there. Probably none. But surely they&rsquo;ve seen what&rsquo;s going on elsewhere, and they want to forestall that in advance.  Good for them!   &mdash;   although in their case it&rsquo;s largely symbolic.</p>
