			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Karen Lee Ziner, Providence Journal, May 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>State Rep. Peter G. Palumbo, saying that he&rsquo;s &#8220;fed up,&#8221; and &#8220;we&rsquo;re all under attack&#8221; by illegal immigrants, has filed a bill mirroring a controversial Arizona law that is considered the toughest immigration legislation in the country.</p>
<p>Palumbo&rsquo;s bill, like the Arizona law, gives local police more authority to question and arrest illegal immigrants. It makes failure to carry immigration documents a state crime, and requires police to question people &#8220;where reasonable suspicion exists&#8221; that the person is unlawfully in the United States. The bill, H 8142, also targets people who hire illegal immigrants, or who knowingly transport them.</p>
<p>Much of Palumbo&rsquo;s bill is taken verbatim from the Arizona bill, SB 1070, signed into law by Gov. Jan Brewer last month, over the objection of President Obama. {snip}</p>
<p>Palumbo, a Cranston Democrat, had stated he had no plans to file such legislation this year. But he changed his mind last week as opposition to the Arizona law  &mdash;  including a spreading economic boycott and legal challenges  &mdash;  continued to mount.</p>
<p>&#8220;What pushed me over the edge was, when I heard the mayor of San Francisco and mayor of L.A. chastising the governor [Brewer] for her efforts, I just snapped. When they said they&rsquo;re going to economically boycott one of their sovereign states  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s what did it,&#8221; Palumbo said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Steven Brown, executive director of the Rhode Island affiliate of the ACLU, called Palumbo&rsquo;s bill &#8220;nothing less than a deliberate recipe for increased racial profiling in the state. It purports to give police this magical bloodhound quality of being able to sniff out any individual who is in the country illegally. How a police officer otherwise is able to adopt this reasonable suspicion that somebody is here illegally is beyond me.&#8221;</p>

<p>OK wants a bill tougher than AZ&rsquo;s:  <a href="https://tinyurl.com/2g8wsuk" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2g8wsuk</a></p>
<p>Before AZ passed 1070, Missouri&rsquo;s was the toughest.  At least three Republicans in the State House and Senate are already busy with pen crafting the wording to get us at least on par with AZ, if not tougher.</p>

		<p>&#8220;How a police officer otherwise is able to adopt this reasonable suspicion that somebody is here illegally is beyond me.&rdquo; (Steven Brown)</p>
<p>Many things are &#8220;beyond&#8221; Mr. Brown.  There is much talk about his lack of understanding on many issues others feel are quite easy to understand, so when he admits something is &#8220;beyond&#8221; him he&rsquo;s letting us know he reconizes his limitations.<br>

		<p>The courts have ruled all over the nation that it is ok for the police to set up check points and stop every single vehicle to check for for various infractions.  The most common check points are used to catch people who have been drinking.  Here in NJ they have been used to make sure inspections and registrations are up to date.  If it is ok to ask everyone at a check point for his papers for a possible motor vehicle infraction why is it so bad to ask drivers for their documents to prove they are legal?  It is ok to make me prove I am legal to drive but not ok to see if I am in the US legally?</p>

		<p>The best way to show that you&rsquo;re standing firmly behind Arizona&rsquo;s new law is to try to get your own state to pass similar legislation.  The fact that Rhode Island can now be added to the list of states wanting their own versions of Arizona&rsquo;s 1087 is evidence that the tide could be starting to turn. As a New Englander myself, I assumed that our region of the US would be to whimpy and PC to really start to take this problem seriously. Maybe I&rsquo;m wrong, we shall see&hellip;<br>

		<p>Police have been stopping people for reasonable suspicion for centuries, whenever they believe &#8220;crime is afoot&#8221;.  People making U-turns at roadblocks, whites slowly driving through ghettos, shifty-eyed youths casing stores, etc. allow cops to question them.  <br>
As more and more states refuse to knuckle to the federal government, what can Washington do?  Send federal troops?  Cut off aid?  Declare nationwide martial law?  The more the leftist power structure reacts to this, the more the right will rise up.<br>
It infuriates me that a foreign leader can hypocritically criticize the laws of this land and be applauded by anyone in Congress!  This action must surely be unprecedented!<br>
We, the people of the United States of America, are not going to take this anymore!!</p>

<p>Here is a suggestion: if they can&rsquo;t speak English, can&rsquo;t produce a driver&rsquo;s license, run away, try to bribe, etc. then there may a good chance they are in the country illegally.  </p>

		<p>As a Rhode Islander, I&rsquo;ve stopped shaking my head every time Brown opens his mouth as I was too dizzy. Brown needs to get out into the real world and get a job where he has to actually work. His remarks, besides showing total ignorance of the laws in question, indicate contempt for working, taxpaying citizens. They also are bigoted in the sense that his ideology is based upon believing that all Hispanics think and behave in lock-step. This is typical of Liberals. Compassion cloaks contempt for those they purport to defend.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t hold your breath waiting for him and his fellow travelers to condemn the Mexican government for their despicable treatment of their own citizens as well as a far tougher set of laws dealing with immigrants in Mexico.</p>

		<p>I would like to remind the illegals AND their supporters that the AZ law is simply a mirror of the federal laws that are already on the books, and which the Feds have chickenheartedly refused to enforce.  All the states are doing is saying, &#8220;Yes, Feds, we agree with your laws, and since you haven&rsquo;t enforced them, we&rsquo;re going to make your laws the laws of our state as well, and we&rsquo;ll enforce them.&#8221;  That&rsquo;s it in a nutshell.  People who don&rsquo;t like it should be boycotting the Feds, not AZ or any other state.  And cities that presume to boycott a state are acting out of sheer egotism, not beneficently.</p>

<p>This statement just shows how dumb political correctness makes us. As a commenter said above, when the person has no ID, speaks no English, etc., then they are likely illegal and should be checked. As most illegal immigrants are Spanish speaking, listening for a Spanish accent would be the greatest indication of being here illegally, especially if said &#8220;immigrant&#8221; is hanging out waiting for a day-labor job.</p>

<p>That is exactly what each and every one of us needs to do, condemn Mexico for its lousy treatment of their own citizens, which is one reason they come here.  The other, and more nefarious, reason is to conquer the entire United States.</p>

		<p>Just seen the FOX News explanation of the new Arizona laws, the US Federal law on the same subject, and the similar Mexican ones.  Sorry folks but you have a big battle fighting the left wing liberals who want to give away your country.  The AZ law is a less strict copy of the federal law and the Mexican one is an &#8220;affront to human rights&#8221;.  But we all knew that didn&rsquo;t we?  The World needs a `powerful movement to fight these fools who are bent on giving away the rights of the Western masses who have worked damn hard for generations and have sacrificed a lot.</p>
<p>I opine that the AZ law is a wake-up call to Pres. Obama to ensure that the federal law is made to work now.  But, not being an American but someone with great respect for our friends across the Atlantic (I lived and worked there in the 1960s for two years -legally) with all due respect he is proving to be a Socialist and we in Britain have just kicked out such people who have led the British country to the abyss of economic and social destruction.  I suggest that you flood your newspapers and TV stations with letters of support for what needs to be done.</p>

		<p>Actually, the age-old American legal constraint known as probable cause is virtually dead anyway, as Istvan has already noted. Police now routinely stop motorists at DUI checkpoints to check for DUI or any visible contraband in the car.  We are X-rayed, patted down, and practically strip-searched in airports, have our briefcases rummaged through in New York subways, and have our e-mails and phone calls monitored by various agencies of the federal government.</p>
<p>Of course, the government can do all these things to the citizenry at large, and nobody complains.  But if they propose to do it to any generally recognizable minority group (especially reliably Democrat voters), there are howls of outrage.  Of course, were these illegals and suspected illegals prone to become Republicans, the Democrats would make the border area a free-fire zone and put a bounty on the scalp of every illegal crosser shot. </p>

		<p>  &#8220;We are all under attack&#8221; &#8220;by illegal immigrants&#8221;. This is the best wording and description i have heard. Its like a war on 3 fronts combined with the other 2 wars. Combine this with what no. 12 wrote and that says a lot. The saying always is that it comes from the top. Whose watch is this happening on. Sadly our federal govt. and that is why the states are having to take action. Its probably too little too late though. Where is there one good state left?</p>
