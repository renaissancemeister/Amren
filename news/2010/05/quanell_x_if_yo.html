<h1>Quanell X: If You Shoot One More Black Man in Bellaire, Your City Will Go Up in Flames</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nakia Cooper, KHOU-TV (Houston), May 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sgt. Jeffrey Cotton was on trial for aggravated assault by a public servant for shooting Robbie Tolan in front of his Bellaire home on New Year&rsquo;s Eve 2008. Cotton was attempting to arrest Tolan for driving what he believed to be a stolen car. The car belonged to Tolan, but another officer mistakenly typed in the wrong license plate number.</p>
<p>Tolan testified he was on one knee arguing with Cotton for pushing his mother when he was shot. Cotton told jurors the shooting was justified because he believed Tolan was reaching into his waistband for a weapon as he jumped off the ground.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, jurors acquitted Cotton after listening to a week of testimony.</p>
<p>Local activist Quanell X organized a protest Wednesday outside the Bellaire Police Department.</p>
<p>&#8220;This cop is a criminal, this cop should be in jail,&#8221; Quanell X said. &#8220;If you shoot one more black man in Bellaire in cold blood, then your damn city will go up in flames.&#8221;</p>
<p>One longtime Bellaire resident showed up at the protest.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many {snip} likened the Bellaire Police Department to terrorists that should be eyed cautiously.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Call Obama,&#8221; someone yelled out in response.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sister, Obama can&rsquo;t do nothing about this, the people in this city are going to have to do something about this,&#8221; he [one of the protesters] replied.</p>

		<p>While I don&rsquo;t like to see riots happen, one in the last week or so in October in Bellaire just might not be such a bad thing for the country as a whole.</p>
<p>It used to be that Bellaire was sort of a white oasis surrounded by black/Hispanic Houston city proper.  Is that still true?</p>

		<p>I remember when there were riots in Cincinnati, OH over a police shooting. There had been a number previously. And a number of police killed too. One columnist wrote that a Cincinnati policeman was around 30 times more likely to be killed by a black offender, than a black man in Cincinnati was to be killed by a white police officer. </p>

		<p>Hey, folks, we&rsquo;ve played host to the granddaddies of all race riots - the Watts riot of 1965 and the one in 1986 or so when the cops who beat up Rodney King were acquitted.  We know all about riots here.  The thing is, the rioters usually soil their own nests; they break in and burn the businesses in their own neighborhoods (I never did figure out the logic of that one).  So hey, Houston, let &#8216;em rumble - it&rsquo;ll be in their own territory and then they&rsquo;ll be squalling for money and help to get them out of the mess that they themselves created.  (so what else is new?)</p>

		<p>#1: Yes - that is to say, it is an expensive place to live, with home prices ranging from just under 1 to 2.5 mil. However it&rsquo;s too close to the inner city for my tastes. Not that I&rsquo;m so very far in Katy, but at least I&rsquo;m not inside 610. </p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t personally visited anyone in Bellaire for years, but it strikes me as odd that anyone would choose to pay that much money to live in the shadow of the 59/610 intersection. Had a friend whose parents bought a place there. From the second story and with a good arm, you could have thrown a rock and hit 610. Boggled the mind.  </p>

		<p>When the Blacks rioted in Newark in 1967 they were even shooting at the firemen who, of course, are unarmed. I know this for a fact because my uncle was a Newark fireman at the time. He had no use for Blacks after that experience. </p>
<p>I also seem to recall that Blacks were targeting police officers in NYC in 70&rsquo;s or 80&rsquo;s. </p>
<p>My father was a career military man and I didn&rsquo;t even know he had kept his Army Colt .45 until the Newark riots. He went into the closet of my parent&rsquo;s bedroom and took the gun down from a shelf and started cleaning it at the kitchen table. </p>
<p>I think the only reason the country didn&rsquo;t totally go down in flames then is because the Whites caved in to the Blacks&rsquo; demands and tried to appease them. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s going to happen this time around.   </p>

<p>It will?  How will that happen, old boy?  Do you think you&rsquo;ll need someone to go along with you or can you do it by yourself?</p>
<p>I mean that is a VERY big city, and you&rsquo;re getting on in years.  A bit too fat, too, the last time I saw you on T.V. leading a failed protest in the Houston neighborhood where Joe Horn shot the two black burglars as they came out of his neighbor&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Do you wish you had burned that neighborhood down too, because when you began speaking the bikers revved up their cycles and drowned you out.  Eventually you left.</p>
<p>Blacks like this oddball are all talk and no action.  I seriously doubt he would even lift a finger if another shooting took place right away.</p>
<p>Hate mongers like him should be deported to Haiti or Africa.</p>

		<p>Haven&rsquo;t we already heard from this &#8220;Quanell X&#8221; character recently on this website?  Seems he&rsquo;s making quite a name for himself by causing trouble in Houston.</p>
<p>Anonymous (post#2): I lived in Cincinnati during those riots in 2001.  Similar to this recent story, black agitators had been disruptively and abusively &#8220;warning&#8221; city council for some time that blacks might riot over &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; by Cincy police.  </p>
<p>They got their opportunity to make good on their threats when a Cincy cop shot a black youff who was trying to pull his baggy pants up while fleeing from the officer.  The cop thought the youff was reaching for a weapon and shot him, thereby providing inducement for the notorious &#8220;unrest&#8221; that followed.</p>
<p>I thought the black instigators should have been arrested for having attempted to incite violence for a year before this situation had had a chance to develop.  And once the rioting commenced, the National Guard should immediately have been called in to contain the frenzy.  But, alas, a majority of city council was Democrat and/or black and seemed pretty smug with the civil disobedience of the local Af-Am community and the concilliatory measures council was able to approve to the delight of their aggrieved black constituents.  Thus &#8220;justice&#8221; was served in this case.</p>
<p>Oh, and I almost forgot; At the urging of local Democratic leadership, the white mayor bowed out of the next mayoral race so that a black man could assume the position.  Numerous such suggestions and appointments were made in order to reward black mobocracy.    </p>
<p>I agree with sbuffalonative (post #3): Segregation would preclude such problems.  </p>

		<p>Here in Indianapolis, there was a triple homicide a few days ago over a Sony Play station and some other electronics. Of the four suspects, one appears to be a mulatto (the local fishwrap, aka, the Indianapolis Star, actually included mugshots). This was at an apartment complex that some friends of mine lived in a long time ago and is near some fairly pricey real estate on the NE side of Indianapolis. I&rsquo;m curious, if something like this happened in the Bellaire section of Houston, would Quanell X be ready to burn down the city? </p>

		<p>Houston blacks will never riot over anything, because they know that if they threaten whites they will not live to see another day.  </p>
<p>They can not count on other minorities coming to their aid, because the other minorities don&rsquo;t like blacks.  </p>
<p>And they can not count on white communists (liberals) defending them either, because white communists won&rsquo;t risk their lives over anything&hellip;  </p>

		<p>I know nothing of the particulars in this case, but it&rsquo;s become increasingly obvious of late that cops in this country increasingly enjoy a peculiar immunity from prosecution or even censure for wildly promiscuous shooting incidents against often unarmed and unthreatening suspects.</p>
<p>It would appear this stems from the widely held belief that cops are under continual stress from the grave dangers they face, that &#8220;they lay their lives on the line for us every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>In actual fact being a cop ranks nowhere near the top among all professions or trades in terms of danger to one&rsquo;s person.  Roofers, fishermen, garbage collectors, construction workers, coal miners, oilfield workers, inner city delivery drivers, and countless other occupations involved more bodily risk than being a cop.</p>
<p>If memory serves, the last year for which figures are available showed some forty cops killed in the line of duty, out of something in excess of over a million sworn officers in this country.  Sounds like pretty good odds to me.  This number includes only those killed in some sort of altercation, not those who &#8220;died while on duty,&#8221; which could be anything from a routine traffic accident, falling down stairs, having a heart attack, choking on a donut, or dying from a steroid-induced seizure. </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question that being a cop, particularly an inner city cop, involves exposure, perhaps even psychologically dangerous exposure, to some of the most squalid and perverse elements of human nature.  They have to see and deal with things that most of us are never exposed to in our happy and uneventful middle-class lives, and for that we owe them our gratitude.  But grave physical danger is rarely one of them</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s how you earn the title &#8220;Community Activist&#8221; from Houston&rsquo;s liberal media:</p>
<p>Quannel X is a convicted drug dealer and leader of the New Black Panthers. He was forced out of the Nation of Islam for publicly inciting violence with his televised, and highly publicized, exhortation to Houston-area blacks:</p>
<p>&#8220;If you feel that you just got to mug somebody because of your hurt and your pain, go to River Oaks and mug you some good white folks. If you&rsquo;re angry that our brother is put to death, don&rsquo;t burn down your own community, give these white folks hell from the womb to the tomb.&#8221;</p>
<p>Quanell X was quoted in the New York Daily News as saying,</p>
<p>&#8220;I say to Jewish America: Get ready &hellip; knuckle up, put your boots on, because we&rsquo;re ready and the war is going down. &hellip; The real deal is this: Black youth do not want a relationship with the Jewish community or the mainstream white community or the foot shuffling, head-bowing, knee bobbing black community. &hellip; All you Jews can go straight to hell.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Another example of the gestures made to reward black mobocracy since Cincinnati&rsquo;s 2001 riots: This weekend the Cincinnati Reds will have the honor of hosting Major League Baseball&rsquo;s &#8220;Civil Rights Game.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be big doin&rsquo;s at the National Underground Railroad Museum and Freedom Center where awards will be given to beacons of &#8220;light,&#8221; &#8220;hope,&#8221; and &#8220;change&#8221; (those last two sound kinda familiar, don&rsquo;t they?).  And besides &#8220;celebrating diversity&#8221; in general, there&rsquo;ll be a special tribute to the infamous sit-in at the lunch counter of the Greensboro, NC Woolworth store; a seminal event in the civil rights movement.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, this same &#8220;freedom center&#8221; is featuring an exhibit about the history of lynching and how that is still relevent today.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I don&rsquo;t patronize the &#8220;freedom center,&#8221; professional sports, or any community events in my old hometown.  I was entirely purged of any civic spirit when the city capitulated to the un-democratic demands of its uncivilized black mobs.</p>
<p>BTW, one of my best friends was murdered by one of these black citizens and robbed of $60 with which the killer intended to buy his little black son a Cincinnati Bengals coat for Christmas (how very touching).  White outrage from this incident, and the resultant pressure on Cincy police to prevent future occurrences downtown may help to explain the charges of racial profiling brought against them for the next year or two leading up to the riots.  But if racial profiling could save just one life&hellip;           </p>

<p>The main reason it won&rsquo;t happen this time is Whites have woken up to having been scammed by the &#8220;there is no such thing as race,&#8221; and &#8220;any disparity between blacks and Whites is environmental and due to White discrimination,&#8221; etc.</p>
<p>Now that 40 years has gone by and we have 40 years of evidence to prove that after 40 years and all we have done for them, given to them, sacrificed of ourselves for them, the blacks are still incompetent and violent.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have the evidence in 1960, but we do now in 2010. </p>
<p>All the gains that blacks have made were done at the expense of Whites.  Black professionals benefitted from White enforced Affirmative Action racial profiling against other Whites.</p>
<p>Now blacks enjoy the Diversity Race Privilege.  Affirmative Action has put so many of them in positions of power, that they can shake down their employers and demand &#8220;institutional self- audits for lingering racism and bias.&#8221;  Of course, the blacks themselves conduct the audits and come out with reports demanding that &#8220;we immediately hire more people of color and do more for social justice.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the big bang of race relations hits after a combination of financial collapse and black on White violence, the Whites will reconnect to their inner Anglo-Saxon and fight back.  </p>
<p>This country is changing, and nothing will ever again be the same. </p>
<p>The costs of Integration have been too high, the results too dismal, and the gratitude too thin.  Whites hoped for the best and go the worst.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t be fooled again!</p>
<p>Everything is beginning to fall apart, and the Arizona story won&rsquo;t go away. It will get bigger, and bigger until brown on White violence puts Obama into a position of choosing between the two.  When he chooses Immigration Reform, Citizenship, and the Vote while leaving the border wide open, the whole thing goes crazy.</p>
<p>We are headed toward horiffic violence, burning cities, and failed states.  </p>
<p>Prepare.</p>

		<p>Well I beleive someone made a terroristic threat right there on the streets of Bellaire. Why was he not arrested. Or was he upset that it wasn&rsquo;t a black kid on the other side that he could help turn into police to get his $5000.00 reward money.(crime stoppers) NOBODY in Houston listens to this fool. You see he had all of 5 or 6 people with him. Someday the news media will learn this fool needs NO AIRTIME to fuel his hate. He don&rsquo;t like it here he can leave, on a one-way ticket.</p>
