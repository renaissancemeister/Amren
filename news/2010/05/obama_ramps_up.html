<h1><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9FQ270G0.htm">Obama Ramps Up Criticism of Ariz. Immigration Law</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Julie Pace, Business Week, May 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Barack Obama stepped up his criticism of Arizona&rsquo;s controversial immigration law Wednesday, calling it &#8220;misdirected&#8221; and warning that it has the potential to be applied in a discriminatory fashion.</p>
<p>Speaking at a joint news conference with Mexico&rsquo;s President Felipe Calderon, Obama called for overhauling the nation&rsquo;s immigration laws and said that can&rsquo;t be done unless Republicans support it.</p>
<p>The controversy over the Arizona law, which would make it a state crime to be in the country illegally, hung over Calderon&rsquo;s visit. Both leaders oppose the law, with Obama directing the Justice Department to review it for possible civil rights violations, and Calderon&rsquo;s government issuing a travel warning for Arizona, out of concern that Mexicans face an adverse political environment there.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Almost twice as many people support the Arizona law as those who oppose it, according to an Associated Press-GfK poll this month. It found that 42 percent favored it, 24 percent opposed it and another 29 percent said they were neutral.</p>
<p>Obama has asked the Justice Department to review the law for possible civil rights violations. He said Wednesday that he expects a final review soon, after which his administration will decide how to approach the law.</p>

		<p>The criticism from the Obamaites has shifted slightly.  At first, they said that SB 1070 *demanded* racial profiling.  Now they&rsquo;re saying that it *might* lead to RPing.  What happened is that someone in the WH must have heard the qualified opinion of someone that has actually read SB 1070.  So they&rsquo;re now shifting their rhetoric, using other words for a favorite phrase of leftist Federal judges, disparate impact.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s the way they feel, then why have any laws against violent crime at all?  Domestic blacks (African-Americans) are somewhere between 13 and 17 percent of the population, but commit somewhere between 55 and 60 percent of the murders in the country, year in and year out.  Couldn&rsquo;t they benefit from comprehensive homicide reform?</p>

		<p> So President Calderon wants a border that &#8220;unites us, not divides us,&#8221; huh? Gee   &mdash;   and all this time I thought that borders were SUPPOSED to divide one country from another! Great big silly me!</p>
<p> The drivel spouted during his visit by both Calderon and Obama shows that both are in la-la land when it comes to the immigration issue. They&rsquo;re so &#8220;eat up&#8221; with political correctness and faux egalitarianism that they don&rsquo;t have a clue about what is wrong here, and how to fix it. Or, rather, they don&rsquo;t WANT to have a clue! That would involve facing some very unpleasant (to them) facts. Such as how Mexico profits greatly from illegal immigrants&rsquo; sending cold cash back into Mexico; and the fact that how Mexico treats its own illegal immigrants (mostly from Central America) makes a hypocritical mockery of all Calderon&rsquo;s words.</p>

		<p>An interesting question I&rsquo;m asking myself as I read this article is, does anyone care what Obama has to say about anything anymore?  Sure.  It&rsquo;s outrageous the things he is saying from the office of the President.  However, it&rsquo;s obvious to even the most diehard Obama supporters that nobody has even the slightest shred of respect for him anymore.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t have the power to actually do anything about it (ie force anyone) and he doesn&rsquo;t have any influence with anyone to get them to cooperate just because he asks.</p>
<p>Arizona&rsquo;s response is to basically laugh in his face.</p>

		<p>On this subject of the Obama&rsquo;s and the immigration debate, every night on our southern hemisphere nightly televised newscast (which I try to watch), we get at least one story from your neck of the woods.</p>
<p>And I have to say that I think that Michelle Obama, so called &#8216;impromptu&rsquo; media back and forth with the illegal grammar school kiddies. <br>
http://tinyurl.com/2d437oj<br>
Was one of the most manipulative and obviously staged political &#8216;set ups&rsquo;, I&rsquo;ve seen in a long time.<br>
Me thinks the next part of the story will be Father Christmas Obama making all the bad go away for Mr and Mrs Alien.<br>
 <br>
I know that this is an obvious and simple prediction to make on a website of such astute observers; but I just can&rsquo;t over how blatant, how Hollywood and widely publicized (globally) this is being &#8216;set up&rsquo;.<br>
Insultingly simple.</p>

		<p>It appears that Obama wants to enforce our immigration laws in a discriminatory fashion as well.  The difference is that he does not want to do anything because the people breaking the law are people of color and potential Democrats just like him.  </p>

		<p>Too late. There&rsquo;ll be other states joining Arizona now. It&rsquo;s not just going to stop with anti illegal alien laws either. Once the states get a taste of their sovereign power, they&rsquo;ll defy the federal govt. in other areas as well.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Discrimination&rsquo; is not a bad word.   A person with a &#8216;discriminating eye&rsquo; is by definition canny and wise.</p>
<p>It is a liberal Marxist trait to want an everything to be equal, to &#8220;end all discrimination&#8221;.  Socialists want men to be less discriminating, so that they cease to use their own faculties of judgement, instead letting the state do their thinking for them. </p>
<p>Obama shouldn&rsquo;t be getting worried about whether laws might be applied &#8220;in a discriminatory fashion&#8221;, just that they be applied. He&rsquo;s again showing a distrust of frontline law enforcement.</p>

		<p>The fact that a president of Mexico can stand before the U.S. Congress and critize our laws and a state law in particular, and then be applauded by many in our congress is an outrage. Of course that is to be expected by weak so-called leaders. The only real leader we have in this country is Obama, and sadly, Obama&rsquo;s leadership has only one aim: the destruction of traditional America. </p>

		<p>The greatest threat to racial war in this country is the pro-black community organizer.  </p>
<p>He wants a health care bill, because it benefits blacks.  It allows for unqualified blacks to go to medical school under a mandate, plus there are many other provisions that involve strictly social engineering and have nothing to do with health care.</p>
<p>He wants open borders with as many non-whites as possible flooding the country, which he naively believes will cause the white power structure to weaken to the point where blacks will be &#8220;assigned&#8221; to jobs on a quota basis, which he won&rsquo;t call a quota, too arrogant to understand that placing huge numbers of unqualified blacks in positions of influence eventually will weaken society to South African levels.  </p>
<p>Like most black leaders he believes all blacks have to do is take up a seat in areas where he succeeds in forcing whites out, and &#8220;injustices&#8221; in this evil society will be leveled considerably.  Things will run as smoothly as ever.  He childishly thinks the biggest obstacle to &#8220;inequality&#8221; is black inability to obtain positions held by whites, not that they just don&rsquo;t qualify for them and would cause them to degenerate down to impractical levels that would be on a par to less than third world levels.  To him and other blacks, just getting blacks in a white seat is the biggest task.  They foolishly believe being able to do the job required can be done by anybody.</p>
<p>The failures caused by unqualified blacks&hellip;if he achieves his goals&hellip;. will be eventually discussed by &#8220;study&#8221; groups trying to unravel the &#8220;mystery&#8221; as to why things are functioning on an unacceptable level, just as they ponder today the enigma as to why poor whites outperform wealthy blacks at all levels, and the &#8220;achievement gap&#8221; can&rsquo;t be closed.</p>
<p>During the process of all this and more, Dear Leader now openly instigates racial turmoil between whites and non-whites, without making too much of a pretense at having only the good of the country as his reason for doing so.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s getting more brazen and open about his racist agenda, and it&rsquo;s probably due to his natural black arrogance clicking in from time to time.  Soon, all the accolades and ego boosting associated with the office of the presidency will have an accumulative effect on his ego and he will reveal more and more about himself and his corrupt agenda.</p>
<p>In the near term, all this arrogance and thin, childish psychology he employs is just apt to set the Frito Banditos against whitey in a big way and he could spark a rebellion by them.  They&rsquo;re dimwitted to begin with.  All anybody has to do to get 500 of them in a phone booth is to tell them they own it or it is their right to be there and the process will begin.  Telling them whitey wants to pick their kids up off the street and jail them just might cause an armed rebellion.<br>

		<p>There is a very compelling reason to enforce illegal immigration.<br>
Now, because most illegals come from, or thru, Mexico there might be a possibility of Hispanics being profiled - oh how dreadful!</p>
<p>Unfortunately there is no regard for the multitude of Whites that, though better qualified, are passed over for school admittance, jobs, etc. in the name of &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; now that&rsquo;s PROFILING and it&rsquo;s not a two minute ordeal to show some papers but rather one that can affect them for years, maybe a life time. This is just fine with everyone from the White House on down. Why? Because some have decided that there is a compelling national reason. <br>

<p>Nothing will happen either to the child or the mother.  The media say that &#8220;Federal law&#8221; states that illegal alien children get to go to public school (in reality, a Supreme Court decision is the genesis of that insanity), while nothing will happen to the mother because Maryland is pretty much a sanctuary state, run almost lock stock and barrel by a La Raza offshoot named CASA de Maryland.</p>

		<p>Thinking about this &ldquo;my mommy doesn&rsquo;t have papers&rdquo; (set up) further strategically. </p>
<p>The sure fire way for a mediocre sitting President to become a Great President is to be War time President. And as Obama can&rsquo;t <i>appear</i> to be a war mongering outside of the States (although we all know little has really &lsquo;changed&rsquo; in that regard), the next best thing (and left wing favourite) is to wage an internal war on its own citizens and what better war has Obama been bred for than the &ldquo;War on Racism&rdquo; and the Arizona stance does give him and the Dems that opportunity.</p>
<p>QD once said that if Obama made all of the illegal&rsquo;s, legal that would nullify the &lsquo;Medicare for illegal&rsquo;s&rsquo; problem and I&rsquo;m assuming an illegal alien amnesty would do the same for the Arizona laws. </p>
<p>With such a move Obama would get to play <i>the hero of the people</i> again and you might as well convert border stations into democrat voter registration stations, as the Dems would reap the credit giving them an 20-30 million more voters instantly and no doubt loyalty from the Hispanic voting bloc for multiple generations. </p>
<p>And then all the Dems would have to do is to gently urge these &lsquo;new Americans&rsquo; to relocate to the staunchly red states to make elections a redundant process.</p>
<p>To match all of these new voter numbers, the GOP would be left with the choices of trying to somehow steal the credit for this amnesty (1.which would never fly with their &lsquo;negative White image&rsquo; and the fact that they&rsquo;re not in power),    trying to steal the Black vote (2. see reason 1. and it&rsquo;d look like they&rsquo;re trying to play &lsquo;catch up&rsquo; and it&rsquo;s a little too &lsquo;Johnny come lately&rsquo;, along with various other etc., est.&rsquo;s) or finally they&rsquo;d be left with the option of simply fighting any proposed amnesty and giving the states full support in curbing illegal immigration in the name of securing traditional American jobs(black and White) for traditional Americans(wouldn&rsquo;t hold your breath on that one).<br>
Just speculation from a novice.</p>

Some contemporary, south of the border, Emiliano Zapata insults our entire form of state rule and laws and basis of government and the great leaders in Washington bow and agree.

		<p>C&rsquo;mon, B.O., get off it!  ANY law can be applied in a discriminatory fashion, not just this AZ law, which mirrors the Federal statutes had our esteemed Prez deigned to READ the AZ legislation.  The fact is, B.O. has sat on the fence about illegal immigration to placate the majority of Americans, and now his Mexican constituents are demanding action.  I say send old Felipe home with orders to clean up his own country and quit dumping his human garbage onto our sovereign land!!!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve come to a simple conclusion about this issue, which is not unique for it has been mentioned all over the internet. After hearing many arguments from countless sources, after my letter of support to Gov. Brewer, after my signing her petition, and after the most recent comments here and now, I have am fully convinced once and for all that it&rsquo;s about VOTES. DEMOCRATIC VOTES. There&rsquo;s nothing else to say except that the liberals  &mdash;  no, call what they are, communists, won&rsquo;t be happy until they give the governor a nervous breakdown and drive this law into the ground. THEY WANT THAT HISPANIC VOTE. PERIOD. I&rsquo;m gonna keep writing letters, making comments here and elsewhere, and vote in November!</p>

		<p>One largely unnoticed example of Washington&rsquo;s pandering to Mexico is in the form of our newer currency.  </p>
<p>Our larger denomination greenbacks were subtly changed into pink and greenbacks.  </p>
<p>Mexicans are obsessed with gaudy pastel pinks and greens which Americans consider eyesores.  </p>
<p>You see it in the colors they paint their houses and businesses in a blatant act of cultural imperialism.<br>
   <br>
Do not lose sight of the fact that the current White House and congress are the worst enemies this nation has ever faced.<br>
  <br>
The Mexicans are proxies that Washington is using in their attempt to displace and destroy us. </p>

		<p>If you agree with ARIZONA, BOYCOTT THE BOYCOTTERS! Don&rsquo;t PAY for another Hollywood trash movie ticket. Don&rsquo;t RENT videos. Above all, don&rsquo;t TRAVEL to California. Instead, write the chambers of commerce for L.A., S.F., other vacation cities&hellip; Tell them you&rsquo;re BOYCOTTING L.A. and will spend your vacation dollars elsewhere! Even if you had&rsquo;t planned to visit LaLa Land in the first first place, writing a letter or sending an e-mal to the CofC will help Arizona&rsquo;s cause.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Loonies do have a right to their opinion. But when they want to BOYCOTT Arizona for a perfectly reasonable get-tough policy on illegal immigration&hellip; then giving California a dose of its own medicine makes good sense!</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s become crystal clear that  the various states must act on their own, the federal government not only won&rsquo;t help but is an impediment. The staged event by the president&rsquo;s wife is nauseating, using children as political props. What do second graders know about &#8220;papers&#8221; beside them being things to draw on? The Mexican president comes here and critiques us on our own soil and Obama goes along with him. This is an insult. Obama is president of the USA, not the UN, Mexico,  or any other place and should be upholding us, not tearing us down. He&rsquo;s just there because the rigged system gave us him or McAmnesty to choose from, a wretched non-choice for most people. Things may have to be done locally, state by state, until the balance gets tipped in our favor. McAmnesty, Graham, Obama, et al, begone. </p>

		<p>Why of course the laws will be applied in a discriminatory fashion. They already are, they are discriminating against legal citizens. I just saw where Az. is threatening to shut off L.A.&rsquo;s water supply, what a great idea. However don&rsquo;t rely too much on the sovereign power of the states. As I&rsquo;ve often said we settled that issue back in the Lincoln administration. Nor should we assume the great one can&rsquo;t use the swipe of his kingly pen, and do as he likes, just who do you think will stop him?</p>

		<p>Of course the law will be applied in a &#8220;discriminatory&#8221; fashion.  All laws discriminate - against the people who break them.<br>

		<p>If this doesn&rsquo;t take the cake! The nerve of this foreign leader of this low level country coming here and issuing a travel warning for Arizona for his fellow Mexicans. Doesn&rsquo;t this guy know the meaning of the word illegal? And Obama accepting him with open arms and siding with this guy, who&rsquo;s no doubt corrupt.</p>
<p>I can just about imagine how Mexico would treat white American citizens, who would come into their country illegally, and try to get a job, not that anyone would want to unless they are out of their minds. But I can imagine that once the Mexican authorities found you were illegal, they wouldn&rsquo;t heisitate to throw you in jail, and try to keep you there as long as possible, until they got as much money out of you as they could before they let you go. </p>
<p>This looks to be outright treason from Obama. He needs to go, Impeach him!</p>

		<p><i>Speaking at a joint news conference with Mexico&rsquo;s President Felipe Calderon, Obama called for overhauling the nation&rsquo;s immigration laws and said that can&rsquo;t be done unless Republicans support it.</i></p>
<p>By &#8220;overhauling the nation&rsquo;s immigration laws&#8221; Obama means amnesty for illegal aliens   &mdash;   making them citizens.  I surely do hope that no Republican other than the worthless Lindsey Grahamnesty supports that.  (John McCain wants to support amnesty, but he&rsquo;s in a difficult primary challenge with J. D. Hayworth, so for now he&rsquo;s pretending to be against illegal immigration.  He even had an ad where he says, &#8220;Build the dang fence!&#8221;, while neglecting to point out that he had voted against funding it.)</p>
<p><i>&#8220;We can do so if we create a safer border, a border that will unite us instead of dividing us, uniting our people,&#8221; Calderon said.</i></p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to unite our people.  We need to keep them separate.  That&rsquo;s what borders are for.<br>

		<p>Obama stated about the Arizona law &#8220;that it has the potential to be applied in a discriminatory fashion&#8221;,.Why not? dis·crim·i·na·tion   /dɪˌskrɪməˈneɪʃən/  Show Spelled[dih-skrim-uh-ney-shuhn]  Show IPA <br>
–noun<br>
1.an act or instance of discriminating. <br>
2.treatment or consideration of, or making a distinction in favor of or against, a person or thing based on the group, class, or category to which that person or thing belongs rather than on individual merit: racial and religious intolerance and discrimination. <br>
