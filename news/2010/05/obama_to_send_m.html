<h1>Obama to Send More Troops to Southwest Border</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CNN, May 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Obama will deploy up to 1,200 more National Guard troops to the U.S. border with Mexico, an administration official said Tuesday.</p>
<p>In addition, Obama will request $500 million to supplement current spending for enhanced border protection and law enforcement activities, the official said.</p>
<p>The National Guard troops will help with drug enforcement efforts and intelligence efforts until Customs and Border Protection can recruit and train additional officers and agents to serve on the border, the official said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A previous troop deployment to the border region, called Operation Jump Start, ended in 2008. The operation sent more than 6,000 troops to California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas to repair secondary border fence, construct nearly 1,000 metal barriers and fly Border Patrol agents by helicopter to intercept illegal immigrants.<br>

		<p>During Calderon&rsquo;s recent visit to Washington, one of the hot topics for discussion was contraband  &mdash;  mainly guns  &mdash;  being taken from the US into Mexico.  Calderon said it was a major problem, and Obama agreed to help.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know this for a fact, but I&rsquo;d bet that these 1,200 troops are going to be searching vehicles headed into Mexico rather than be used to protect America and Americans.</p>
<p>Any time anything not bad is said about the elite class, it is usually too good to be true.</p>

<p>Will the national guard troops be authorized to make ARRESTS?</p>
<p>Will the national guard troops be authorized to carry loaded weapons?</p>
<p>1,200 national guard troops? This shows they are not serious about solving this problem! </p>
<p>How about 120,000?</p>

<p>Gee&hellip;is he going to let them bring their rifles? And issue ammunition? Because the only mission the National Guard should be performing at the border is shooting armed drug smugglers and armed human traffickers. And 1,200 troops (one per mile of border) isn&rsquo;t nearly enough. He should tack a couple of zeros (pardon the expression) onto that number. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;President Obama will deploy up to 1,200 more National Guard troops to the U.S. border with Mexico, an administration official said Tuesday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What we need at a minimum, is at least 125,000 fully equipped and ready for full combat operations US Army and US Air Force personnel, under the authority of a locally autonomous border security command, that acts first and reports to the Pentagon and White House only when that border security is breached. The methods that they use to halt &ldquo;migrations&rdquo; and other &ldquo;undocumented&rdquo; criminal actions by the invaders operating through Mexico, should only be questioned if they fail to get results. Otherwise, it should be carte blanche and no questions asked, when dealing with these invaders.</p>
<p>Of course, pigs might learn to fly too?</p>

		<p>From a Justice Dept. investigation of the AZ law to Guard troops on the border?  Someone&rsquo;s been reading the tea leaves!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve looked at the comments section of a few articles today and many people see right through this bait-and-switch.  I agree totally it&rsquo;s just a bone to throw to the dog while they ramp up to the big amnesty push.</p>
<p>When is someone going to tell Obama to stop digging?  The pit he&rsquo;s in is so deep he&rsquo;s gonna need a rocket to get out of it.</p>

		<p>About 400 members of the Illinois National Guard are being shipped to Egypt for peacekeeping duties.So why are guardsmen from all across the US being sent overseas to one miserable place after another when they have a much bigger and more important mission here, on our own territory? A piddling 1200 is not enough, it&rsquo;s just another cynical public relations stunt. Send 20 times that, at least they&rsquo;ll be guarding the country here, they&rsquo;ll be in closer touch with their families and will be doing something we can all support    </p>

		<p>This is like the last deployment to the border? This number of 1,200 will be phased in over a period of eighteen months or so? And being &#8220;on the border&#8221; could very well be defined as doing maintenance on a Border Patrol vehicle at a depot a thousand or more miles FROM the border. It is all words.</p>

<p>How many times have we seen all this? Troops are mobilized, sent to the border, their role limited to things like painting crosswalks or swatting horseflies, and then they are quietly withdrawn. On the positive sided, with Obama and many members of congress siding with the president of Mexico against the citizens of Arizona, and giving Calderon a DC reception that can be likened to grateful excited puppies that will shake their little tails with such gusto that they loose bladder control, it makes the invasion battle lines much more clear. In a way, it is good that elites are casting all caution and patriotism to the wind, allowing themselves to be so easily smoked out as being clearly in favor of the invaders and their conquering leader. (Arriving in DC on the back of a high-stepping white stallion must have been thought a bit too obvious by our future El Presidente.) <br>

		<p>Sounds like Obama is sending troops to interfere with AZ.  Also possible that it&rsquo;s the first wave (sent as &#8216;helpers&rsquo;) in the force that will take over the state.  AZ has been passing immigration reform at LIGHTNING speed:   allowing officers to question immigration status, banning ethnic-studies and any &#8216;racial solidarity&rsquo; teaching, and now to ban &#8216;accented teachers&rsquo; from ESOL classes.   The feds are playing a cool-hand to this, but almost appear to be staging a lock-down.  Having the national guard &#8216;nearby&rsquo; may prove both helpful and a hindrance. McCain wants many more than that!  If they are actually there &#8216;to help&rsquo;, it will be to hold open the door for the Criminal Trespassers to make sure the &#8216;rassissssss&rsquo; AZ gov&rsquo;t doesn&rsquo;t get in their way.</p>

<p>Washington wants to merge the US with Mexico and Canada, so they have no intension of ever keeping the illegals out with a fence.</p>
<p>The illegals know this and feel empowered by the congress to invade our country and do whatever they damn well please here.</p>

		<p>Are these Guard units to be drawn from the New Mexico Guard or from that of some other state?  And will they be armed and carrying live ammunition?  And what will be the rules of engagement.</p>
<p>My guess is that the answers to the two last questions are no and none.</p>

		<p>President Obama is playing politics. He is using this National Guard deployment as part of a publicity blitz to promote his illegal immigrant amnesty bill. Obama promises to permanently strengthen our border checkpoints/workplace enforcement after &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221; (shamnasty) is passed. Of course, after the foxes are given the keys to the hen house, why even bother?</p>

		<p>Any National Guard troops deployed by this President to our southern border WILL NOT have the authority to arrest and they won&rsquo;t have any bullets in their guns, if they are allowed to even carry a gun.</p>
<p>With all due respect to our National Guard, they will be as useless as the National Guard Troops that were deployed to Baltimore City in 1968, when I was kid, so they could stand around while the blacks burned, looted and stole.  My father told one of the guardsman that if they would shoot a few of them, they&rsquo;d stop the looting and stealing.  He told my Dad they weren&rsquo;t allowed to have bullets in their guns.</p>

		<p>Forgive my ignorance, but why is it now such a big deal to put troops along the Mexican border? I&rsquo;m sure that from 1848-1945 there were US troops routinely patrolling the border. Remember Pershing&rsquo;s expedition? Contemporary MSM commentators act as if deploying troops would be akin to annexing Alsace-Lorraine. <br>
