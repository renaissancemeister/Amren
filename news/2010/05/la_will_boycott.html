			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sean Gregory, Time, May. 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>After the Los Angeles city council passed legislation banning the city from doing any further business with the state of Arizona because of its new law targeting illegal immigration, some Angelenos are hoping that the L.A. Lakers will get behind the cause. In a bit of serendipitous timing, the Lakers are about to face an Arizona team, the Phoenix Suns, in the NBA Western Conference Finals, which start on Monday. Obviously, it would be absurd to expect the Lakers to boycott their series with the Suns. But as representatives of an area with the largest Hispanic population in the country, could the Lakers take some kind of stance, symbolic or otherwise, against a law the National Basketball Player&rsquo;s Association has called &#8220;disturbing&#8221;? {snip}</p>
<p>Several members of the Suns, including star point guard Steve Nash (a Canadian), general manager Steve Kerr and owner Robert Sarver, have spoken out against the immigration measure, setting an impressive standard for modern-day political expression in sports. For their May 5 playoff game against the San Antonio Spurs, the Suns wore jerseys with the script &#8220;Los Suns.&#8221; The move was both a nod to Cinco de Mayo and a gesture against the measure. Los Suns won the game, 110-102.<br>
 <br>
Your ball, L.A. The Lakers have three foreigners on their team, including star forward-center Pau Gasol, a Spaniard. The NBA has nearly 60 basketball immigrants. &#8220;Kobe Bryant and the Lakers are like America&rsquo;s team,&#8221; says Detroit Pistons forward Charlie Villanueva, who calls the Arizona law, labeled as racial profiling by it passionate opponents, &#8220;ludicrous.&#8221; Villanueva, the son of Dominican immigrants, speaks fluent Spanish. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} TIME asked the Lakers if the team had any plans to take a position on the controversial law, and the response seemed pretty clear: you&rsquo;d have a better chance of seeing John McCain jumping center for the team. &#8220;We&rsquo;re in the business of playing basketball,&#8221; says Lakers spokesman John Black, &#8220;and we&rsquo;re not in the business of getting into a political debate one way or another.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>At this stage of the NBA playoffs, focusing on hoops is not unreasonable. &#8220;I won&rsquo;t hold it against them,&#8221; says Reyes [Los Angeles city council member Ed Reyes] of the Lakers&rsquo; reticence. &#8220;I know how hard they work in the community.&#8221; Still, for immigration-rights advocates, the team&rsquo;s silence stings. &#8220;It&rsquo;s unfortunate,&#8221; says Lisa Navarette, a vice president at the National Council of La Raza. &#8220;We&rsquo;re not asking them to go lobby the governor of Arizona. We&rsquo;re just saying that you can make a gesture of support for the people who root for you. The Latino community gives the Lakers a tremendous amount of support. It would be nice for them to reciprocate when the community really needs it.&#8221;</p>

		<p>San Diego was getting ready to boycott Arizona, but Arizonans decided to boycott first:</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/2v687wz" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2v687wz</a></p>
<p>This is happening at the worst possible time for San Diego, because Memorial Day&rsquo;s long weekend is coming up.  Arizonans from Phoenix and Tucson who have the means to do so get out of town every summer weekend they can to escape the heat.  San Diego is (or used to be) a popular getaway.  Two weekends before Memorial Day and all those Arizonans who had reservations are canceling like crazy.</p>

		<p>I believe these infantile boycotts seriously violate the interstate commerce provision of the constitution.  The feddle gummint may be forced to intercede on behalf of Arizona, which isn&rsquo;t breaking any constitutional principle or even current federal statute.</p>
<p>Of course, given the ongoing Cheech and Chong movie that is this bizarre administration, I wouldn&rsquo;t look for any federal assurances on constitutional issues.</p>

		<p>I think we should just replace all the NBA players with cheap immigrant players and then ask them how they feel about it. </p>
<p>Or better yet with all the immigrant fans we can just do away with basketball and replace it with soccer. </p>
<p>And tell all those football and baseball players they are next on the chopping block. </p>
<p>Remember folks that all these sports are nothing but kids games that pay millions and one game is as good as another. </p>

<p>So do the black, white, and Asian communities, and they mostly support the Arizona law. So is this entitled Hispanic chica actually suggesting that the Lakers should betray the majority of their fans, to support their whiney Hispanic fans? Quite rascist in my opinion&hellip;</p>

		<p>There are no lakes in Los Angeles (the Lakers were originally the Minneapolis Lakers   &mdash;   lots of lakes in Minnesota).  So, the misnamed team aside, water&rsquo;s surely a big issue in dry, dry Los Angeles.</p>
<p>So, where does Los Angeles get its water?  Well, gee, a lot of it comes from the Colorado River by way of a huge aqueduct!  That&rsquo;s water that has to flow through Arizona first (you know, through the Grand Canyon and all).  </p>
<p>If Los Angeles were serious about a boycott of Arizona, then they shouldn&rsquo;t accept any water that comes through the state that they now hate.  Right?  I mean, for consistency&rsquo;s sake, you&rsquo;d think that they&rsquo;d go all the way if they were serious about a boycott.  Ahh, but that&rsquo;d mean a lot less water for a city that can&rsquo;t manage its resources anyway!  Think the denizens of LA would appreciate further reductions in the water they could have?</p>
<p>Back to the basketball:  Who cares what a basketball team or its owners think?  I don&rsquo;t watch the NBA anyway, because it has no more appeal than watching the Ugandan national team playing the Kenyan national team in soccer!  Which is to say, none.</p>

		<p>I personally do not put a lot of stock in what celebrities think. I think the Arizona law is a cry for help from a state besieged by illegals with no help at all from the federal government. There are no problems with current immigration law, it just needs to be enforced and these illegals sent packing.</p>

		<p>The boycotts do not violate the commerce clause.  The commerce clause allows only the federal government to regulate interstate commerce, but these cities are not regulating it; they are simply refusing to participate in it.  What would be illegal is if these cities not only decided that the city governments would not patronize goods and services that originate in Arizona, but that local businesses and individuals also had to join the boycott.  That would be an illegal violation of the commerce clause, because a city or state government simply has no legal authority to tell you or me where we can or can not mail-order products, travel on vacation or purchase investment products like municipal bonds.<br>

		<p>6:  The LA boycott explicitly exempts electric power from AZ nuclear plants.  So the answer to your question is an emphatic no.  LA loves Hispanic Power, but it loves electric power now.</p>
