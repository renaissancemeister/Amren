<h1><a href="http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/kiyama/">40 Black Men Take the &#8220;Kiyama&#8221; Pledge</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Allan Appel, New Haven Independent, May 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Know that the world is not run by people who wear their pants at their knees. Know when to say please and thank you. Don&rsquo;t let black women raise your children alone.  Refuse to be consumed by the myths of black inferiority or white superiority. Oh  &mdash;  and don&rsquo;t litter.</p>
<p>Forty black men gathered Saturday to pledge to follow that creed.</p>
<p>The event took place at the student center auditorium of Southern Connecticut State University.</p>
<p>It was the the first public taking of the Kiyama Pledge, created by local activist and criminal defense attorney Michael Jefferson.</p>
<p>{snip} &#8220;Kiyama&#8221; means &#8220;resurrection&#8221; in Swahili.</p>
<p>The grassroots movement Jefferson hopes to start is non-sectarian and non-religious, although highly spiritual. &#8220;It&rsquo;s set up to be universal,&#8221; Jefferson explained.</p>
<p>Jefferson took the pledge himself in front of his family in 2007. He said Saturday&rsquo;s ceremony  &mdash;  which had the feel of half black history seminar, half secular revival  &mdash;  was not prompted by any particular event.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kiyama is anchored in a comprehensive website created by the tech-savvy Jefferson {snip}.</p>
<p>The site includes a Kiyama curriculum on black history and issues, compiled solely by Jefferson from his reading, replete with links to publications and sites.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s fully researched,&#8221; said Jefferson.</p>
<p>It has info on everything from the Dred Scott decision to the fact that Rome at the time of the movie Gladiator had a senate that was one third black. Jefferson also said there were three early African popes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Kiyama is simple,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s about being better. Look at how Richard Pryor stopped using the N word.&#8221; He suggested that if rappers would pull their pants up, so would the huge audience of boys who follow them.</p>
<p>By Jefferson&rsquo;s design, the pledge in public is always administered by a woman. That&rsquo;s because, according to Jefferson, black women have sustained the black community over the generations; black men have to pick up their game as responsible parents and leaders to complement them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>What has all this to do with littering? &#8220;We need to confront some of our own self destructive tendencies,&#8221; Jefferson said. &#8220;You can&rsquo;t blame white men for littering if you litter.&#8221;<br/>

		<p>Evidently, telling the truth is not part of the Kiyama pledge.</p>
<p>As an aside, the ancient Romans, at least the learned ones, had no contact with western African blacks, and didn&rsquo;t know there were any such people.  Their only experience with blacks were mainly with mixed race East African-Nubian/Egyptian mulattoes in Egypt, and tangentially, they knew about pure Eastern Africans south of Roman Egypt along the Nile.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t the case that just anyone could become part of the Roman Senate, either in the Republican or Imperial period.  Either it was a matter of privilege/wealth, inherited privilege/wealth, or the decree of the Emperor.  How could the Roman Senate be one-third black if the American Senate is about to have no blacks as of January 3?</p>

		<p>I have no problem with this.  In fact, I applaud them for not only recognizing that the problems come from within their own community, but actually trying to do something about it.  </p>
<p>The problem is that it will work for some for a while.  But, in the end, you really can&rsquo;t change genes by taking a pledge.  And then you have to start all over with the next generation of Africans.  </p>

Yet another initiative.</p>
<p>Will THIS ONE be the magic bullet?</p>
<p>Have any in the past been the magic bullet?</p>
<p>Motivation comes from within. If you have to sign a pledge to simply do what&rsquo;s right, I don&rsquo;t see heartfelt motivation.</p>
<p>Good luck with this one but I&rsquo;ve seen too many of these programs come and go.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the Million Man March Pledge that was supposed to transform black America:</p>

		<p>Like small children taking oaths/pledges this will amount to nothing.  They take an oath when they join the military but when push comes to shove they break it and join in the mayhem created by their &#8220;brothers&#8221;.  Saw it happen time &amp; time again in the military and also in the community.  Pledges/oaths mean nothing (ZERO) to them.  Compare their oaths to the defenders of the Pacific ocean area during WW II and the difference is really startling.  Just more bull to placate the liberals in our society. How sick it is.</p>

		<p>Of course.  The Roman Senate was one-third black.  I guess they found the secret treasure trove of lost Roman roll-call documents or something, buried under the coliseum in a bronze urn.  Otherwise, I can&rsquo;t think offhand what sources they rely upon for that data.</p>
<p>At any rate, it&rsquo;s funny and sad at the same time, watching these people try to co-opt a collective prestige and importance for themselves.  Sort of like an abstract entitlement or reparation payment for lost self-esteem.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Refuse to be consumed by the myths of black inferiority or white superiority.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, without a doubt, that statement is an unequivocal myth.</p>
<p>Myths are stories that can&rsquo;t be supported with fact, as we all obviously know.   Obviously the facts and millions of examples unequivocally reveal blacks to be less intelligent and capable than whites, but further proof abounds that blacks are less capable than any other race on earth as well.</p>
<p>If 1/3 of the Roman Senate was ever black, it&rsquo;s been a well kept secret for centuries.</p>
<p>These pitiful fools have no accomplishments of their own, so they constantly attempt to co-opt another race&rsquo;s history with myths that are so silly everything they stand for is in doubt.</p>
<p>Unlike some other posters on here, I give these liars credit for nothing, because they don&rsquo;t want to build a history for themselves, attempting to really achieve some kind of accomplishments, they would rather begin their high sounding organization&rsquo;s tenents based in absolute lies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just wondering why they&rsquo;re not claiming to have built the pyramids.</p>
<p>Too, I&rsquo;m also wondering if they are ever successful in getting people to believe their lies of accomplishment, how do they square the fact that they&rsquo;ve been such proven dismal failures for thousands of years?  Why are they failing now all over the world?  Why is there an achievement gap between blacks and everybody else?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably black arrogance that prompts them to fabricate some kind of ridiculous moment of grandeur in history.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t they start an organization based on the truth and work toward laudible goals?  They&rsquo;re the most pitiful race of people on this earth.</p>

		<p>What a miasma of black poppycock, saying that one-third of the Roman Senate was black. When was that, exactly? This is the first I ever heard of it. I read the &#8220;Claudius&#8221; trilogy by Robert Graves, and the only blacks in it were slaves from Ethiopia. As far as three popes being from Africa, those three popes were from NORTH Africa. I believe they all came from what is now Tunisia.</p>
<p>This is just another organization looking to make a name for itself, by so-called self-improvement for black men. Just like the Million Man March - see how that turned out.</p>
<p>This too, shall pass. </p>

		<p>To be a Roman Senator you had to be wealthy, right? Very wealthy, I believe. So, if 1/3 of the Roman Senate were comprised of very wealthy blacks wouldn&rsquo;t we have plenty of paintings, statues, writings, legal documents, etc. attesting to this? Do we? Anyone? Anyone? Bueller?</p>

		<p>To see through the charade of this Kiyama stunt (&#8220;stop scaring the White People,&#8221; etc), we must adore Hinton Rowan Helper.</p>
<p>We Amreners have imbued ourselves with Carlton Putnam, Sam Francis, Jared Taylor, Pat Buchanan, etc. </p>
<p>But very few of us have read Hinton Rowan Helper.  He&rsquo;s misunderstood by Southerners because he was an Southern abolitionist. But he was a Colonizer, which is the kind of abolitionist we should have embraced and elevated into prominence and power. </p>
<p>Read EVERYTHING written by Helper regarding the blacks!  Teach these lessons to your White Children so that you may have White Grandchildren and not horrid mongrelization.</p>

<p>Notice the reporter - Allan Appell - writes of &#8220;the fact&#8221; that Rome had a 1/3 black senate? Could have at least questioned this fantasy or used &#8220;the claim&#8221; rather than &#8220;the fact&#8221;? </p>
<p>Whatever happened to all these black Senators and why were they not mentioned in history? Why were there no blacks in Italy until very recent black African immigration?</p>
<p>Blacks are always trying to claim other people&rsquo;s history (Egypt, Spain, Italy, the Middle East &hellip;etc) as their own. But come to think of it, if the history of my ancestors was as pathetic as the real history of black Africans, then maybe I would try to steal the history of others as well.</p>

		<p>Hey everyone, I was alive during the time of the movie Gladiator myself.  In fact, I have a historical copy, it&rsquo;s tape, which is ancient.</p>
<p>If so many blacks were in Rome, even as slaves, it would be reflected in the many records that survived the period.  As for the Senate, must I explain it?  This is like saying that one third of our presidents have been black.  Hitler was a closet blackman.</p>

<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just the wording, but it sounds as if Jefferson is saying that blacks should cease to engage in that behavior so that they can then blame whites for engaging in it. </p>
<p>Come to think of it, that probably WOULD motivate a whole lot of blacks. </p>

		<p>The below list called &ldquo;Ignorance is&rdquo; was taken from kiyamamovement.com<br/>
Most of the listings have nothing to do with ignorance but have everything to do with selfish, rude, immature and arrogant behavior. <br/>
Also &ldquo;Kiyama&rdquo; is a Japanese name. I found no mention of any Swahili &ldquo;kiyama&rdquo; in a Google search. Sounds like another black fantasy similar to &ldquo;Kwanza&rdquo;. So it goes with the Blacks – Endless programs (schemes) followed by endless failures.<br/>
 <br/>
It&rsquo;s really humorous to me that the below list very accurately describes the average black person that I personally encounter on a daily basis. </p>
<p>IGNORANCE IS&hellip;   <br/>
•	Littering.   <br/>
•	Spitting in public.   <br/>
•	Blasting your music while driving.   <br/>
•	Not acting your age but your foot size.  <br/>
•	Displaying disruptive behavior in public.  <br/>
•	Talking loud in public in order to be seen.  <br/>
•	Not taking advantage of a free education.   <br/>
•	Seeing the faults of others and not in you.   <br/>
•	Allowing your underwear to be seen in public.  <br/>
•	Not knowing when to turn off your cell phone.  <br/>
•	Ridiculing our &ldquo;Blackness&rdquo; and African features.   <br/>
•	Not wearing a condom when you know you should.   <br/>
•	Not knowing when to say thank you or excuse me.   <br/>
•	Holding up traffic to have a lengthy conversation.   </p>
<p>•	Making a scene when attempting to resolve a conflict.  <br/>
•	Having an attitude when providing a service that you     get paid to do.   <br/>
•	Damaging private or public property because you feel like it. </p>

		<p>Sometimes black people just make me want to laugh. This, however, is more disgusting than funny. Regarding the &#8220;1/3 of the Roman Senate was black&#8221; statement, I would ask Mr. Jefferson the following:</p>
<p>a.) When (what time period), specifically, was one-third of the Roman Senate black?</p>
<p>b.) How exactly did you come to the conclusion that just around one-third of the Roman Senate was black?</p>
<p>c.) When, exactly, did the Romans grant citizenship to blacks? Or, if they didn&rsquo;t, when did the Roman Senate allow non-citizens to become Senators? Also, since only people who were in or around the city of Rome at election could actually vote (due to travel times), who exactly was voting for these black people?</p>
<p>d.) How did Rome get so many black people, when its only territory in Africa was in inhabited by white Berbers and brownish Egyptians?</p>
<p>e.) If blacks were so prominent in ancient Rome, then why isn&rsquo;t there a single known Roman statue with black facial features? Were Rome&rsquo;s black senators so degenerate that not a single one was ever prominent enough to dedicate a statue to?</p>
<p>And regarding the &#8220;three African popes,&#8221; this is just the old African unity stuffagain. They look at Africa as a geographic entity, which is correct, but they sometimes make the mistake of considering ALL Africans (except European white ones) to be in the same category as black. Even the far more sophisticated Arabs are place din the &#8220;African&#8221; category by these nutcases. That&rsquo;s like me saying I&rsquo;m an Indian just because I live in Texas. Yes, I&rsquo;m sure three popes were born in Africa. But they would have been Egyptian, Berber, Phoenecian/Carthaginian, or even Latins living in Roman cities in Africa. But they could NOT have been black Africans, as Roman territory never included any black areas (unless it included Nubia at one time, but even that was an insignificant place). And even though Ethiopia was black, Ethiopian Christians have always been pretty disconnected with Rome. Grow up and stop claiming other peoples&rsquo; achievements as your own.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Kiyama&rsquo; means &#8216;resurrection&rsquo; in Swahili.&#8221;</p>
<p>A thousand times this has been discussed. Why do American blacks always seem to adopt Swahili names for &#8220;things&#8221; when Swahili is an east African language not at all related to any of the west African tongues as spoken by the ancestors of the American black?</p>
<p>Swahili is a made up language used primarily by the slave traders that identified themselves with the Indian, Persian, and Arab masters.</p>

		<p>These ideas are as delusional and humorous as they are sad. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve come to the inconvenient conclusion that the black race is incapable of learned civility; not to mention the fact that whites have, in vain, attempted to raise the black race up to something resembling modern society. </p>
<p>What difference does it make whether a black or a white says these things? An uncivilized and unmotivated people will remain thus until Mother Nature has her say. Do they honestly believe that a black saying these things will make any substantial improvement whatsoever?</p>
<p>May the wicked lay where they may; and, may the righteous sustain what is true and just. A simple ideological proposal certainly doesn&rsquo;t guarantee any forthwith cooperation from any said race or people.</p>

		<p>The attitude that Mr. Jefferson takes to history is the typical one: that history is propaganda and entertainment. In fact, it is mainly intelligent white men who believe that history should be an accurate description of the past. I doubt if Mr. Jefferson knows how many or if any Blacks were Roman senators. He knows that it advances his agenda to spew it out, so he spews away.</p>

		<p>The article certainly evoked a chuckle or two. How, might one well ask, can our Blacks PROVE the Roman Senate was one-third Black? This is as goofy as claiming the Egyptian ruler, King Tut was a Nubian Black. Too goofy to be even remotely believable by intelligent people of any race.</p>
<p>I can only surmise these typically outrageous claims are fueled by a massive feeling of racial inferiority. What else could drive people to much such ridiculous claims that can absolutely never be substantiated by historical research?</p>
<p>Are the average Blacks really that child-like mentally? That they can&rsquo;t understand how foolish they look making these claims? What next? Proof Pythagoras, that ancient Greek mathematical genius was Black? That Archimedes and Aristotle were freed Black slaves? That Kepler, Galileo, Watt, Newton, the Curies   &mdash;   were all Caribbean Blacks or African Blacks who migrated to Europe to give Europeans the fruits of their intelligence?</p>

		<p>So the Romans were the first society to have affirmative action policies.  Sure that could have happened and now we know why the Roman Senate was made up of 1/3 Black Senators.  I remember reading about one of them, Senator Edwardius Kennediarus, a very Liberal politician if my memory serves me correctly.  He would have gone far if it hadn&rsquo;t been for an unfortunate accident.  He was taking one of the white Vestal Virgins homes after a night of merry making and apparently having consumed too much of the &#8216;fruit of the vine&rsquo; made a wrong turn and his chariot ended up in the Tiber and poor Maryiola ended up dead.  He was also a friend of the downtrodden and open borders, saiing that the Barbarians were hard workers and only wnated jobs that Roman citizens wouldn&rsquo;t do.  Yep, I&rsquo;m wondering now if Christopher Columbus was really an Italian.  </p>

		<p>Gee, ain&rsquo;t we great.  We&rsquo;re going to act like a normal White person already does.  What a huge step for our race.  </p>

&#8220;Refuse to be consumed by the myths of black inferiority or white superiority.&#8221;</p>
<p><br/>
Although I have some admiration for any black who attempts to take responsibility for his/her life   &mdash;   as this Kiyama Pledge would have them do   &mdash;   the trouble is that in matters of mean intelligence, creativity, and morality, blacks ARE inferior to whites. That&rsquo;s a pretty big stumbling block right there militating against this Pledge initiative ever becoming a workable, successful &#8220;uplift&#8221; program. </p>
<p>Plus of course there&rsquo;s the problem that no black org, no matter how &#8220;reasonable,&#8221; seems able to resist making preposterous and easily-disproven claims for historical African greatness   &mdash;   such as this nonsense about the Roman Senate etc that previous commenters here have already demolished. </p>
<p>IOW, &#8220;Garbage in, garbage out.&#8221; <br/>

		<p>&#8220;It has info on everything&hellip; the fact that Rome at the time of the movie Gladiator had a senate that was one third black&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>That deserves to be called an enormous lie for people with bubble gum brains. However, if this initiative teaches young Black men to behave more like good, mature and responsible citizens, tghen I guess it can&rsquo;t be entirely bad (even if that Jefferson character needs to brush up on his history).</p>
