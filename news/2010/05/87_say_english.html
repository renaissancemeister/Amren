			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rasmussen Reports, May 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Americans continue to overwhelmingly believe that English should be the official language of the United States and reject by sizable margins the idea that such a move is racist or a violation of free speech.</p>
<p>A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that 87% of Adults favor making English the nation&rsquo;s official language. This is the highest level of support yet but in line with what voters have been saying for several years. Just nine percent (9%) disagree.</p>
<p>Eighty-three percent (83%) say a company doing business in this country should be allowed to require its employees to speak English. Eleven percent (11%) say companies should not be permitted to require their employees to speak English on the job. These views are unchanged from a year ago.</p>
<p>Only 10% of Americans say requiring people to speak English is a form of racism or bigotry. Eighty-four percent (84%) disagree and say that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>Twelve percent (12%) believe that declaring English the official language would limit free speech in this country, but 78% feel otherwise and see no limits being placed on free speech.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Support for English as the official language is high across all demographic groups.</p>
<p>However, Republicans consistently support it more strongly than Democrats and adults not affiliated with either party.</p>
<p>Ninety-five percent (95%) of those who work in the private sector think companies should be allowed to require their employees to speak English on the job, a view shared by just 69% of government employees.</p>
<p>Over 80% of whites, blacks and those of other racial and ethnic backgrounds agree that requiring people to speak English is not a form of racism or bigotry. {snip}</p>
<p>Eighty percent (80%) of voters believe that those who move to America should adopt American culture. {snip}</p>

		<p>Eighty percent (80%) of voters believe that those who move to America should adopt American culture.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Or what?  Such a statement begs the question, what should be done with those that refuse (the overwhelming majority).</p>
<p>The implication here is that the vast majority of people don&rsquo;t want ANY immigration other than the very small percentage that assimilate.</p>
<p>This is a VERY wide gap in the perception the media portrays of a multi-cultural nation that wants &#8220;diversity&#8221;.  It shows that immigration is being pushed against the express wishes of those that live here.</p>

<p>I think caution should be taken on this one. The question must be asked, &#8220;who&rsquo;s culture?&#8221; or &#8220;what culture?&#8221; Are we talking about conservative, freedom-loving, Christian (of whatever kind) culture, or something of the like, or are we willing to go along with the seedier side of American life, with its porn, booze, drugs, gangs, violence, etc? We really don&rsquo;t have a single &#8220;culture&#8221; or &#8220;way of life&#8221; here with so many ethnic groups, and so many political and religious differences even among European whites, the core group of this country.</p>

		<p>I think it&rsquo;s obvious why English should be the official language of the U.S.A. - it&rsquo;s the language the founders of this nation spoke, AND if we&rsquo;re going to have effective communication today in every walk of life, we HAVE to share a common language.  To allow different languages equality with English is divisive, and the first word in our national title is &#8220;United.&#8221;</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a difference between making something an official language versus saying other languages have to be outlawed. Why can&rsquo;t neo cons, hispanics, and liberals exercise any honesty anymore?  They&rsquo;re always whining about conservatives &#8216;framing the argument&rsquo;</p>

		<p>I disagree with this.  The more mestizos cling to their culture and language, the easier it will be to convince the majority of whites that they aren&rsquo;t just like us.</p>
<p>A good analogy would be a bunch of mestizos holding up signs saying things along the lines of &#8220;Honkeys go back to Europe!&#8221; </p>
<p>Things like this and that only bring more people to our cause than statistical analysis of IQ tests and honest discussions on the long term viability and repercussions of having a perpetual and growing underclass of mestizos in America ever would.</p>

		<p>English must be formally recognized as America&rsquo;s official language. Allow bilingualism to creep in, and guess what will happen? All the states will have to post bilingual (Spanish) signs, although in Hispanic-majority areas, they&rsquo;ll fight tooth and nail to maintain Spanish supremacy. Separatist parties will rise up, and the federal government will have to placate states with large Hispanic populations with bribes and financial largesse. Politicians will have to be bilingual, which means that Hispanics will dominate Washington. Business investment will decline. Fracture lines will start to split the country apart. And so on.</p>
<p>Think I&rsquo;m alarmist? Well, all of those things have happened in Canada, with its recognition of two (not one) official languages. And the French speakers in Canada are whites, not Hispanics. And France is an ocean, not a hop, skip, and a jump away. Bilingualism has the potential to be much nastier in the United States than it has proven to be in Canada.<br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t care what language you speak at home  &mdash;  if you come here, you better know English, instead of demanding that everything be in your language too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love for there to be an option when you call a business.  Press 2 for Spanish  &mdash;  and when you press it, it tells you call back when you&rsquo;ve learned English, then hangs up.</p>

		<p>Before leftists squeal &#8216;racism&rsquo;, nearly 100% of the nations on earth have offical languages.  The US and the UK do not and look how far that has gotten us.  Furthermore, it is currently legal to discriminate against English only speakers as it has happened to me.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ll see English declared the official language of the US sometime in the next decade or two; don&rsquo;t doubt it.  The only problem is, it will happen the same day they declare Spanish an official language as well.  The second they have the chance to consecrate Castellano as an official language of government, it will happen; granting English the same status is the price they will have to pay.</p>

		<p>Why shouldn&rsquo;t English be the official language of America? Spanish is the official language of Mexico. Nobody calls that &#8220;racism&#8221;. If English shouldn&rsquo;t be the official language what should be? Over 90% of the countries in the world have an official language. Why shouldn&rsquo;t America? As a Canadian I fear that Americans just don&rsquo;t appreciate the dangers in language issues.</p>

		<p>I could care less if it is official.  All I care about is that ALL government documents be in American English (with the exception of landing cards for foreign tourists).  As for English being the founding language German, French and Dutch were all spoken in the US until even mid 20th century.  </p>

		<p>Any American who thinks that bilingualism is a great idea need look no further than Canada.  In order to get votes out of the French province of Quebec, our Liberal government declared us a bilingual country in the 1960&rsquo;s.  English and French are our official languages.   This means that every product sold in Canada must be labelled in English and French.  The same goes for every federal sign on every federal building.  Every government office must have civil servants who are fluent in French and every federal document must be in both languages.   All government business including debates in Parliament are in both languages and anyone wanting to run for the office of Prime Minister must speak French.   How much does all this cost taxpayers?   Think of a number and double it!</p>

		<p>Washington state isn&rsquo;t one of the border states, but it does have a very large large Hispanic population, some of the eastern counties approaching or already past the 50% mark. Living in one of those counties, I see many stores with Spanish language signs right alongside the English ones. I always wonder why. Most of the mestizos chittering away in their language are illiterate in any language, and they don&rsquo;t speak real Spanish, anyway. They speak &#8220;Spanglish&#8221;, a slang mixture of Spanish and English, about as comprehensible to a true Spanish-speaker as Ebonics is to a true English speaker. </p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t it odd how the folks who can so often be heard speaking of our form of government as a democracy rather than as a republic suddenly don&rsquo;t care a whit for the voice of the people? That 87% means nothing to them when they&rsquo;re members of the 13%. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Eighty percent (80%) of voters believe that those who move to America should adopt American culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>And yet we have an OFFICIAL policy of mjulti-culturalism in our government. Seriously, its on the books somewhere that the government will support &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221;. I&rsquo;s not sure exactly what the law or statement or whatever is, but I read in a Geography textbook some years back that this our official policy.</p>
<p>And as other have said, if 87% of Americans want English as the official language, then why isn&rsquo;t it? I believe in representative government and all but when the people so overwhelmingly support a measure, it MUST be adopted. Or at the very least put up for referendum (by which it woiuld certainyl pass, according to the poll).</p>

		<p>I doubt if there is a single American community today, large or small, that isn&rsquo;t infested with Hispanic (mostly Mexican) illegals.  </p>
<p>This alien invasion, infiltration and colonization is well-planned, well-coordinated and well-financed by our domestic communists.  </p>
<p>This travesty has happened almost overnight.  </p>
<p>Americans are being forced by traitors in our government to provide jobs, housing, free medical and welfare services to these enemy invaders.  </p>
<p>We are even being forced to provide public school classes in Spanish for the children of the invaders.  </p>
<p>This has forced our property taxes to increase as new schools are built and old schools expanded to keep up with the unending flood of illegals.  </p>
