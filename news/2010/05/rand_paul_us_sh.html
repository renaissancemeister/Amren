			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Elyse Siegel, Huffington Post, May 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Kentucky Republican Senate candidate Rand Paul recently shared with a Russian television station his belief that the United States should end its policy of guaranteeing citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>&#8220;We shouldn&rsquo;t provide an easy route to citizenship,&#8221; Paul explained. &#8220;We&rsquo;re the only country that I know that allows people to come in illegally, have a baby, and then that baby becomes a citizen. And I think that should stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the interview Paul also suggested what steps he thinks lawmakers should take to address illegal immigration  &mdash;  one of his ideas being constructing an &#8220;underground electrical fence&#8221; along the boarder. The Senate hopeful even mentions the solution on his campaign website in defining his stance on the issue:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Also on his campaign website, Paul supports his position on illegal immigration by citing the protections outlined in the 10th amendment of the U.S. Constitution  &mdash;  a frequent point of reference for the self-described &#8220;constitutional conservative.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Paul doesn&rsquo;t mention however, the 14th amendment of the Constitution, which guarantees U.S. citizenship to all persons born in the country.</p>
<p>On Friday morning, Paul campaign chairman David Adams clarified that the Kentucky candidate stands behind his remarks &#8220;because illegal immigration is a real problem in this country.&#8221;<br>

		<p>This would put the United States in league with most countries in the world, including the two with which the forty-eight coterminous states have a border.  In Canada&rsquo;s case, it used to have B/C, but a Canadian politician of Chinese ancestry drug the country&rsquo;s liberals and liberal conservatives kicking and screaming into ending it.  </p>
<p>Funny, all these libs stand up and cheer when SCOTUS partially bases its decision to prohibit the death penalty or (most recently) life w/o parole sentences for non-murder offenses for juveniles based on &ldquo;world consensus,&rdquo; but world consensus doesn&rsquo;t matter to them now.</p>
<p>All that is needed to end B/C here is a proper reading of the construction of the 14th Amendment.  The purpose for the clause that seems to call for B/C was to grant citizenship to those who were no longer slaves due to the previous amendment, those being almost entirely black slaves in the states that had allowed slavery until that time.  I can ill imagine the framers of the 14th were thinking about masses of people streaming in from Mexico and Latin America.</p>

		<p>Rand Paul is about to learn a hard lesson in politics.  Just because the Tea Party wants to elect conservatives, does&rsquo;t mean they want to elect Realist Conservatives.  </p>
<p>Tea Partiers are still White, which means they care more about not being racist than they do about keeping their freedoms.</p>
<p>You can have America or Diversity, but you can&rsquo;t have both.</p>

		<p>A nation is comprised of ONE race of people. Any variation thereof is null and void. It is no longer a nation.</p>
<p> This is why America and Europe, Canada and Australia is headed for a complete break-up. We wouldn&rsquo;t have to even worry about anchor babies, amnesty, nonwhite immigration racism, welfare, crime or any of the other myriad of problems this nation faces if it had of stayed with the immigration policies of years past and had not made those citizens who should never have become citizens.</p>

		<p> from the article- &#8220;the 14th amendment of the Constitution guarantees U.S. citizenship to all persons born in the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Absolute hogwash!!!  The 14th amendment contains the phrase &#8220;subject to the jurisdiction therof.&#8221; Illegals are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States govenment, they instead are subjects of foreign powers. The most bullet-proof and chrystal clear case that can be used against the notion that being born on US soil is sufficient to becoming a citizen is the policy that once applied to the American Indians. Those born on reservations were not regarded as fully subject to the jurisdiction of the US govenment but instead their own tribal govenment and thus were not automatically granted American citizenship. It wasn&rsquo;t until congress in the 1920s passed a law changing this that all Indians beacame citizens; which was more than a HALF CENTURY after the 14th amendment was ratified. <br>

<p>Honestly, I think Rand Paul is giving the right message, at the right time!</p>
<p>Moreover, I bet he gets that US Senate seat with about 55% to 60% of the vote!</p>
<p>Multiculturalism is a current &ldquo;fashionable&rdquo; function of any white society that has two common and incompatible features. </p>
<p>These would be:</p>
<p>1.) It is 75% white or greater;</p>
<p>2.) And it is experiencing a &ldquo;boom economy&rdquo; that has &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; controlled and not &ldquo;enriching&rdquo; it at a 25% or under level, and does not wish to change that dynamic of socioeconomics in reality.</p>
<p>Any other variables in the equation, such as dividing the length of a recession by the exponential numbers of &#8220;enriching&#8221; anchor babies added, cannot and will never produce a calculation with positive results!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

		<p>Rescuing the 14th Amendment from its woeful PC misinterpretation granting illegal alien anchor babies citizenship is like Arizona&rsquo;s new law to enforce federal immigration laws &hellip; or California&rsquo;s proposition to deny services to illegal aliens that voters passed and a judge quickly set aside &hellip; or the endless struggle against affirmative action anti-white racism. Most Americans want it. It makes perfect sense. But &hellip; our rulers said, &#8220;No, children! You may not interfere with our radical transformation of this country. Now, have a beer and a microwave dinner, and get back to your TV dramas. We&rsquo;ll decide your fate!&#8221; </p>

<p>The 14th amendment doesn&rsquo;t &#8220;guarantee U.S. citizenship to all persons born in the country.&#8221; It guarantees U.S. citizenship to former slaves freed after the civil war. The only reason it&rsquo;s being used for &#8220;anchor babies&#8221; is because it&rsquo;s deliberately abused by dishonest bureaucrats.</p>

		<p>The Supreme Court is certainly able to narrowly construe the 14th Amendment to refer only to children of ex-slaves, as #1 states.  In the U.S., lawmakers are always supposed to look to the INTENT of constitutional passages, statutes, and court-created laws.  </p>

<p>Are you sure that&rsquo;s right?  I am not finding confirmation of this on Canadian govt. websites.  They still talk about citizenship by birth to anyone except the children of diplomats. <br>

		<p>It only figures logically, I would think, that  an act proceeding from another act which was illegal would itself also be illegal. Thus, no legality can come out of an action that was originally illegal. In this case, the parents&rsquo; presence in the country was/is illegal (indeed, criminal). Hence, it follows that  the child&rsquo;s citizenship [stemming from that illegal presence] is also illegal. </p>
<p>The law also assumes (however naively, but it was written long ago) that anyone in the country is here legally&hellip; as they would be, if the federal government were doing its job.</p>
<p>There is the legal concept of &#8220;dirty hands&#8221;, I believe.</p>
<p>Thus, if I were to buy from you, innocently and in a perfectly correct way, goods that you had stolen, those tainted goods would not legitimately be mine, no matter how correct my own behavior had been. </p>
<p>Why should this not apply to citizenship as well?  </p>

		<p>A family is an extension of the individual, a tribe is an extension of the family and a nation is an extension of the tribe. </p>
<p>People recognize people genetically similar to themselves as members of their own tribe ( extended family ) this is what gels a nation together and not some abstract notion from officialdom. </p>
<p>The millions of European migrants with a mirid of different cultures and languages were only able to assimilate with each other because they were already members of the same tribe to begin with. all they needed to do was create a new common culture, American Culture. </p>
<p>Merely being born in another tribes lands does not necessarily make one a member of that tribe. <br>

		<p>Al Queda operative Anwar al Awlaki the man who planned<br>
the Detroit airliner bombing, and the Times Square bombing<br>
was an anchor baby. Born of Yemenese students here in the <br>
USA he was granted automatic US Citizenship. He used this<br>
automatic citizenship to attend Colorado State and get<br>
degree in civil engineering he then used that knowledge to <br>
kill Americans . From 1990 -2000 he led a mosque in San Diego<br>
where met, and conspired with Nawaf al Hazmi and Khalid al Mihdhar in 2000 ..giving them money and plans..to carry out<br>
9-11 attacks killing 3000 US citizens. He is believed to have<br>
been the key plotter in 9-11 and he WAS A US CITIZEN. This is what Multiculturalism and open borders has brought us&hellip;and there<br>
will be many many more deaths here in the USA from these people.<br>

<p>What your saying is true.  There will be more attacks against us.  The key is to understand which ones are legitimate threats and which are false flag operations committed by our own government to scare the population into submission or to achieve some political goal.</p>

		<p>Mr. Paul Is correct in his knowledge of the tenth ammendment. However he is beating on a dead horse, which was killed by the most radical federalist president to date, excepting our current ruler. That being a mr. A. Lincoln. The uncivil war was fought over the tenth ammendment, not slavery, using the same arguement used in the revolutionary war, which was fighting a centralized government which ruled over everthing, and everyone. Thus the confederation was formed by the south, and destroyed by the federalists from north of the Mason Dixon line. A little history on the 14th ammendment, it was mainly conceived by one of the most evil men to ever have a high position in this country, this being A mr. Seward who was secretary of state under Lincoln. He being a war criminal as bad as Hitler himself. Declaring under the approval of the again said, A. Lincoln, that if the union commanders gave the order the yankees could kill the sick, the elderly, the young, and torture, rape, pillage, or whatever, to cause the south to be sickened for their loved ones and end the war, IT WORKED! Yet no charges were ever brought, since the perps were the conquerers and might makes right. The current U S was formed on these principals. So, as Paul Harvey would have said: &#8220;Now you know the rest of the story.&#8221; Is it any wonder we are having the problems we currently have?</p>

		<p>I think an excellent way of getting rid of the &#8220;anchor&#8221; babies is asking at least one of the parents to provide proof of American citizenship when they apply for a social security number.  Granted, it is allot more trouble, but we all have to take part in doing our part.</p>
<p>You cannot get anywhere in this country without this number. That would stop the &#8220;families&#8221; that are illegal from getting an anchor baby.  Then to get &#8220;welfare&#8221;, or other social services, admitted to school,  the child must have the SS number.  </p>
<p>By only requiring one, this protects children that are born outside of marriage with only &#8220;one&#8221; parent known, so any mother that is an American Citizen can get a SS number for her child.   If she isn&rsquo;t, but the &#8220;boyfriend&#8221; was&hellip; Tuff.  Unless he provides proof of his citizenship&hellip; and visa versa.. </p>
