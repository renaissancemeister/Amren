<h1>Police: Women Between Ages 14-30 Involved in Massive North Side Fight</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WPXI-TV (Pittsburgh), May 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A North Side brawl involving several dozen people resulted in six teenage girls and women being injured and five people arrested, Pittsburgh police said.</p>
<p>Police said the fight broke out shortly after 4 p.m. Wednesday on the corner of Jacksonia and Monterrey streets.</p>
<p>Paramedics said four people were taken to hospitals for minor stab or slashing wounds, while a fifth was treated for a cut on the hand and a sixth said she would go to the hospital on her own for treatment of a head injury. Police said none of the injuries were life threatening.</p>
<p>At least a dozen police cars responded to the fight, which left the ground littered with hair weaves and wigs, hairbands and bracelets.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;My sisters were doing a little bit of shopping. They ended up seeing my sisters all the way down the Commons (apartment complex),&#8221; Cetesha Brookins said. &#8220;Somehow, they got word they were up here, followed them all the way up here with about 40 girls and jumped them.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police said the fight involved women between the ages of 14 and 30. A knife and mace was recovered at the scene.</p>

		<p>As long as we are wealthy enough to provide cradle-to-grave free care for Africans, the riots will be kept to a minimum.  However, as productive whites become a shrinking minority, there simply will not be enough productive taxpayers to support the governmental give-aways.  Already, only 50% of USA adults actually pay taxes, and the &#8220;working poor&#8221; actually receive money (Earned Income Tax Credit) at tax time.  </p>
<p>Massive immigration of low-IQ people who dislike European Americans and everything the USA used to stand for will speed this process.  And add the economic inefficiencies of massive overpopulation (longer, more expensive commutes, more trash, waste water, &amp; pollution, crowded, stressful cities, ethnic and racial conflict), there can only be one result: economic and social collapse of the USA.  Then we will witness what Africans are really capable of.  The Watts and Katrina riots were nothing.  Imagine what will happen to the 7 million people in greater LA, when they can no longer get food, water, electricity, natural gas, AC, TV internet porn, and potato chips.  Also, remember that the police will not help you.  During Katrina, 1/4 of the police left to protect their own families, and 1/4 of the police backed their cruisers up to WalMart and begin loading up big screen TVs. When the collapse comes, you and your family will be on your own.</p>

		<p>When we hear of something like this it is almost always Blacks or Hispanics involved.  The name &#8220;Cetesha&#8221; gives it away.  This type of altercation was literally unheard of in the past.  Women and young girls fighting like men in the street.  This, unfortunately, is what Blacks bring - violence.  Both the men and the women.</p>

		<p>Regarding the name Cetesha  &mdash;  I was talking to a black teenager this week who was unfamiliar with the name *Sam*  &mdash;  did not know if it was short for a name (Samuel or Samantha). Never heard of it. I have also had conversations about the name Robert (when I was talking about the novel *Treasure Island*). Students didn&rsquo;t know the name *Robert*, and were not sure if it was a boy&rsquo;s name or a girl&rsquo;s name&hellip;Bet they can figure out Ceteshia though.</p>

		<p>Remember that as the percentage of the white population drops, the black population percentage is holding steady. There are more of these people relative to us every year.  </p>

		<p>I once watched two black female welfare recipients fight over a black, toothless, male welfare recipient.  Yes, they were fighting over whose man he was.  Both had children by him.  </p>
<p>If I was one of the woman I&rsquo;d fight over who was stuck with him not over who he belonged to!  But blacks are in general, very petty and immature and fight over the littlest things, just like 4 year olds.</p>

 Yeah, with the massive Hispanic  immigration, the fact that the black population, percentage-wise, remains steady means that they are breeding like crazy, unlike the White percentage, which is shrinking.</p>

What if whites figure out that giving welfare or not really doesn&rsquo;t effect the tendency of these people to riot.</p>
<p>Likely we will get an opportunity to witness what will happen if welfare is cut off en masse as the stae of california can no longer afford a welfare system at all.</p>
<p>If california simply stops giving out welfare and nothing changes (except for a rather large number of mestizos flowing back over the border into mexico), then what effect will that have politically?</p>

		<p>Istvan, your comment made me think of the time I was doing some contract work for a children&rsquo;s hospital in Memphis, TN.  As a Respiratory Therapist, I was responsible for treating asthmatic patients in the E.R.  Most of the patients were black of course (Memphis, Tn should have given that away) but the thing I marveled at was some of the mothers.  Extremely obese, nappy short dirty hair, visible facial hair, very unattractive, toothless, obvious body odor, filthy clothing, worn-out flip-flops on their equally disgusting feet, and I was absolutely flabbergasted as to WHO impregnated this disgusting animal?  Blacks are like the animal kingdom, whereas do you see that a male dog would care about how a female dog looks?  No, when she is in heat, the male will mount her and penetrate her for all it&rsquo;s worth.  Same as a black male with an ugly, smelly, disgusting black female like the mothers in that E.R.  I used to look at these black females and think how I would much rather masturabate with a handful of cockle burrs than to even deign to think of intimacy with such a stinking animal.</p>

		<p> The black race is a race of extreme violence. Of all races on earth, this race has not been able to achieve an enlightened culture. As races across the world built beautiful buildings,books,mathmatics, and sciences, blacks were still living in grass huts eating eachother.</p>

		<p>I go into a store and see 40 year old males dressed like a foolish 12 year old.<br/>
I sit in a room where they are and their need to make noise, any noise is overpowering.<br/>
I hear them speak and it&rsquo;s like a language from the Moon.<br/>
They make little if any attempt to fit in with the majority of society and they cry like babies when Mr Whitey don&rsquo;t pay their way. Is anyone else sick of these creatures?</p>
