<h1>DOJ Lawyers Draft Challenge to AZ Law</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Levine, Fox News, May 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A team of Justice Department attorneys reviewing the new immigration law in Arizona has recommended that the U.S. government challenge the state law in federal court, but the recommendation faces an uncertain future and tough scrutiny from others in the Justice Department, sources with knowledge of the process tell Fox News.</p>
<p>Staff attorneys within the Justice Department recently sent higher-ups the recommendation. At the same time, the Justice Department&rsquo;s Civil Division, which oversees the majority of immigration enforcement issues for the department, has drafted a &#8220;civil complaint&#8221; that would be filed in federal court in Arizona, sources said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One source said the Arizona law has sparked a &#8220;huge battle&#8221; with national implications, and the Justice Department is therefore conducting a &#8220;slow analysis of all of the options.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Justice Department higher-ups decide to move forward with the civil complaint, concrete action likely would not take place for some time, according to the source, who predicted it will be &#8220;a while before anything would be filed.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If the Justice Department&rsquo;s Civil Division decides against filing the complaint, others within the Justice Department could step in. In fact, the attorney general&rsquo;s office, the deputy attorney general&rsquo;s office and the Civil Rights Division are all reviewing options.</p>
<p>Holder told lawmakers that the Civil Rights Division will be monitoring the application of the Arizona law, set to go into effect in late July, and could take subsequent action.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Holder said the Justice Department will also be looking at other issues, including &#8220;the history that is involved in all of this&#8221; and memos or opinions from other offices within the Justice Department.</p>
<p>Holder himself has raised concerns that the Arizona law could push a &#8220;wedge&#8221; between police officers and the communities they serve, something he&rsquo;s expected to discuss during a meeting with police chiefs, including three from Arizona, at the Justice Department on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Others have raised concerns that a 2002 memo from the Office of Legal Counsel could complicate federal challenges to the Arizona law, especially preemption-related challenges. The 2002 memo said state and local police can arrest illegall immigrants for violating federal law.</p>

		<p>Prediction:  You will read articles like this, once a week or more, that suggest that Justice is &#8220;considering&#8221; or &#8220;drafting&#8221; complaints or lawsuits, against SB 1070, until November 2.  Then it will stop.</p>

		<p>I was waiting for this. The question I have is how are they going to go after a law that was drafted based almost entirely on a federal law? What premise will they use? Are they going to come to the conclusion that the Federal law is unconstitutional, or will some judge have the common sense to throw their case out? It&rsquo;s political posturing of the worst sort, and goes against what a majority of the American people want. </p>

		<p>How can this law put a wedge between the police and the community served?  The police serve the American taxpaying public.  The illegal aliens are criminals.  Who cares if criminals are unhappy law enforcement. Gang bangers and rapists aren&rsquo;t fond of the police either, so what! We have become an insane country.  We worry too much about what criminals think and feel.  Quite frankly I feel foreign invaders should have no civil rights in the US.  And their opinion of the police should never be a consideration.  The only opinions that should matter are the those of the people who actually pay the police.</p>
<p>My main concern with the Arizona law is &#8220;disparate impact&#8221;.  Since the overwhelming majority of illegals are hispanic and the vast majority of them are Mexican I am afraid the Feds will use that as proof of the discriminatory and therefore racist nature of the law.<br/>

<p>As is expected, a bazaar of the bizarre is offered by Comrade General Secretary BO and his NKVD Commissar, Leventri Holder!</p>
<p>They worry and whine that a &ldquo;wedge&rdquo; might be driven between local policemen and citizens of the USA, when they are all but declaring war on the states and the white population that lives in them. They are (and El Presidente Bush was no better on this score) more concerned about the &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; of alien invaders and their illegal machinations, then they are of the &ldquo;inalienable rights&rdquo; of citizens and states, as are demanded by the US Constitution!</p>
<p>This is arrogantly ignorant multicultural treason and nothing more!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

		<p>One.  Just one.  </p>
<p>Just one terrorist event that can be traced to entry at the southern border and this community organizer and this Democratic Congress are finished.</p>
<p>How many times have we heard that we had no terrorist attacks, because of the measures taken by Bush.  What measures?  Forcing grandma and grandpa to take off their shoes at the airports?  Requiring people that have been licensed for years to have to dig up enough I.D. to pass a high security clearance before their license are renewed, yet Mexicans can get licensed on Matricular Mickey Mouse cards they can buy on the street for $25?</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t had a terrorist attack, because real jihadists haven&rsquo;t made any legitimate attempts, or they&rsquo;re just a whole lot dumber than the Washington Hillbillies give them credit for.</p>
<p>Any competent terrorist(s) in the world can waltz across the Mex/US border anytime he/they want, and conduct any number of devestating terror attacks that would crash this economy and cause the country to collapse earlier than its scheduled demise estimated to be around 2012 to 2015.</p>
<p>For some reason it hasn&rsquo;t occurred yet, but for these fools in Washington to be openly running their mouths about Arizona trying to protect its section of the country is about as imbecillic or out of touch with reality as Jed Clampett and his family of hillbillies who think camping out in Central Park is a good idea.   </p>

<p>This is a clear demonstration that Holder is incompetent and not too bright.  Even if the law does what he fears, that is none of his business.  This is a policy decision, addressed by the Arizona legislature.  The adverse impacts of thie &#8220;wedge,&#8221; if it does exist, are to be weighed against the benefits of controlling illegal immigration.  If Holder thinks this is unwise policy, and if he wants to do something about it, he can resign, move to Arizona, run for the legislature.  If he wins he will have a legitimate say in policy matters.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>This is  but one example of the people in the Obama administration not understanding the basics, the rule of law.  </p>

		<p><i>Holder himself has raised concerns that the Arizona law could push a &ldquo;wedge&rdquo; between police officers and the communities they serve, something he&rsquo;s expected to discuss during a meeting with police chiefs, including three from Arizona, at the Justice Department on Wednesday morning.</i></p>
<p>Remember this simple equation:  Big City Police Chief = Big City Mayor + Badge.</p>
<p>This plays into an unrelated issue currently hot in St. Louis and Missouri in general.  And that is the issue of state vs local control of the St. Louis and Kansas City P.D.s.  </p>
<p>After the outbreak of the War Between the States, and either just before or just after the elected state government of Missouri voted to secede, it voted to place the Police Departments of St. Louis and Kansas City under state control, in that the Governor would appoint all but one members of their respective Boards of Police Commissioners; the elected Mayor would be the other member.  The reason for this move is that KC and STL (especially STL; KC was not a big deal at this time) were heavily pro-union, and the state wanted control over the St. Louis City Police Department to neutralize its pro-Union bias.  </p>
<p>It was within (I think) a year of the WBTS starting that Union troops overthrew the elected state government and forced it into exile in Texas, and installed a placeholder state government.  It did not undo the police control measure, probably out of pure accident.  And the new state government, enacted with the new Missouri constitution after the WBTS, didn&rsquo;t undo it, either, again, probably because of forgetfulness.</p>
<p>The rule remains to this day.  And it has worked out to the benefit of the cause of good law enforcement in STL and KC.  For while not all Missouri Governors are conservative, even the most liberal of liberal Missouri Govs aren&rsquo;t as wacko as STL and KC&rsquo;s big name black politicos.  That STL and KC always has all but one of its police commissioners serving at the pleasure of the Governor has meant that it&rsquo;s far easier to be a white cop in STL and KC than it is in most other big heavily black cities.  Neither STL nor KC has a civilian review board.  I don&rsquo;t know about KC, but STL&rsquo;s cops have a very good pension system, which the local officers&rsquo; association can manage themselves because the Commissioners let them to do it.</p>
<p>And, of course, black activists and quasi-black white politicians in both cities want local control restored.  The two main reasons are:  (1) So that the cabal of white-hating police-hating cracker jack box theology degree black &#8220;preachers&#8221; and the welfare-dependent &#8220;community activists&#8221; that populate the two cities can immediately get in a civilian review board, which would effectively mean the end of white cops arresting black criminal suspects, and of course, you could forget about any high speed pursuit and (2) The City government, both its blacks and white liberals, want to raid the police officer pension fund to waste on one city pork barrel project or another.</p>
<p>Officially, the St. Louis City Police Officers Association opposes the restore of local control for reason 2.  Unofficially, they also do for reason 1, but they can&rsquo;t say that publicly.</p>
<p>The aforementioned conference between AG Holder and the police chiefs happened yesterday.  The Chiefs of Phoenix and Tucson were there, and many other big cities, but St. Louis&rsquo;s Chief was not there.  I think state control is the main reason; the current Governor, while a Democrat, is not an open borders type.  The previous Governor, a Republican, signed strict immigration bills the legislature sent him.  All four police commissioners that the Governor can appoint for the St. Louis BOPC were appointed by those two Governors.  </p>
<p>Imagine if Arizona Governor Jan Brewer appointed all but one of the commissioners of both Phoenix and Tucson&rsquo;s PD.  Would their Chiefs be mouthing off about a state law she signed?  Instead of reverting to local control in Missouri, that train should be moving in the opposite direction   &mdash;   this kind of state control should be enacted in and for every big city with a big minority population.</p>
<p>As an aside, Holder and the Chiefs tried to rehash the debunked notion that we can&rsquo;t enforce immigration laws because it&rsquo;ll scare innocent bystander/witnesses (&#8220;who just happen to be undocumented&#8221;) from testifying against the big time gang bangers.  First off, there is a lot of fear, but the reason isn&rsquo;t fear of deportation, it&rsquo;s fear of gang retribution.  Most of this takes place in sanctuary cities anyway.  Second, the easiest crimes to solve are crimes that never happen in the first place.  Those Chiefs should want immigration enforcement, to keep their cities as white as possible and therefore as crime free as possible, notwithstanding a certain domestic racial minority we all know and love so much.</p>

		<p> I have read the Constitution and come to the conclusion that it has been ignored and purposely misinterpreted by the North, the Union power of the Civil War, solely in order to destroy the South. The problem with Southerners of today is, the Constitution you have been taught to understand is a creation of the enemies of the Constitution. We, our forefathers, wrote the Constitution just as surely as did any Northerner that ever lived. Our opinions count and must be weighed. Our racism is irrelevent to any discussion of the Constitution, just as is our &#8220;hate&#8221;. Do not let being called racist deter you in the least from your arguments, for we have a right to be and should be proud of being, White People . Our race is far older and far more important than any country or government or religion or idea.</p>
<p><br/>
                   New Ideas of Liberty</p>
<p>        </p>
<p><br/>
    Article. V.</p>
<p>       The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall   propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the Legislatures   of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments,   which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this   Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several   States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode   of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress; Provided that no Amendment which   may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any   Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article;</p>
<p>   AND   that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage<br/>
   in the Senate.</p>
<p>    The 17th Amendment  deprived some States of their sufferage in the Senate.<br/>
     We would do well  to repeal the 17th Amendment! According<br/>
   to the 10th  Amendment,  the States are distinct from the People. <br/>
    This Article is talking about the State Governments, NOT the people of a State.</p>
<p>       Florida, Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina and Virginia did not ratify that   amendment and were deprived of their equal suffrage in the  Senate, thereby profoundly effecting the integrity of every Amendment to the Constitution!</p>
<p>   Also, the unseating of the Senators of Southern  States for their refusal to ratify Amendment 14 constituted &#8220;exactly&#8221; that prohibition, &#8220;AND that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffragein the Senate.&#8221;</p>
<p><br/>
   The argument  that the Senate shall be the sole judge of the qualifications of its members, used to justify their expulsion, flies directly in the face of Article V. The same can be said when attempting to balance the assertion that attainders of treason are legal with other lines that declare that no attainders of any sort are legal. Please notice that whan the Constitution proclaims with great bombast that it is Supreme over State Laws and Constitutions,  it has no jurisdiction over State  laws and Constitutions. </p>
<p>   I also would like to show you a few other things in the Constitution that I am sure<br/>
you will find to be very interesting.</p>
<p>   Article 1. Section 9.3} No bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall<br/>
  be passed.</p>
<p>      The 14th Amendment fails these basic tests of Constitutionality. That<br/>
           amendment is a bill of attainder<br/>
   and it was passed ex post facto. Article 1. Section 9.3 is probably the reason that the Antebellum South so confidently seceded.  Seceded or not, the North was and still is bound by that limitation of power. The North had no power over slavery in 1861, and it still had no legal power over slavery in 1865. The history of the 14th  amendment has been well documented, and it  truly is a testimony to the failure of Constitutional government. <br/>
   </p>
<p>      Article 3. Section 3.2} The Congress shall have power to declare the<br/>
   punishment of treason, but no attainder of treason shall work<br/>
   corruption of blood, or forfeiture except during the life of the person<br/>
   attained.</p>
<p>       Article 1.Section 9.3} declared<br/>
   that Congress may not pass Bills of Attainder or ex post facto laws. Now<br/>
   we see an exception or a mistake. The Constitution contradicts itself here.  <br/>
   Attainders of treason are permitted with some very serious restrictions<br/>
   on them to protect the descendants of the traitors. That is us, by the<br/>
   way.  The entire problem is the 14th Amendment.</p>
<p><br/>
      The value of the slaves and Southern war bonds  concern us here. That value is the forfeiture that is Constitutionally bound to be returned to the Southern people,  as   we shall not suffer Corruption of Blood or lose our property EXCEPT<br/>
   during the lifetimes of the Confederate Politicians and Soldiers. They<br/>
   are now all dead. Also, the theory known as the Incorporation Doctrine<br/>
   is defunct. The application od the 14th Amendment to the States and the people is illegal. The traitors are dead!</p>
<p> <br/>
      The application of the Incorporation Doctrine is Corruption<br/>
   of Blood and is Unconstitutional. We, the Southerners living now, are<br/>
   not and have never been Traitors to the United States. We are thereby<br/>
   under the jurisdiction of the original Constitution . Corruption<br/>
   of Blood is being allowed to function as the Supreme Law of the Land<br/>
   rather than the Constitution of the United States. This cannot continue.</p>

<p>    I propose that any one  of the Southern States expelled from Congress to force their ratification of the 14th Amendment, simply    repeal      their states ratification of the 14th Amendment. That alone would tie EVERYTHING up in the Federal courts for the next 20 years.  Liberty would  blossom again.</p>
<p><br/>
   Further, the 2nd Amendment should be interpreted as the free state being refernced are each of the states that are in the Union. I refer to Michigan or Tennessee or Vermont. That state is not the aggregate United States. Each state is to be &#8220;Free&#8221; from Federal intervention in its internal government. <br/>
   </p>
<p>   I would like to propose what we shall call, The Doctrine of the Perpetual Negative. When the Constitution says that  no power shall be   exercised by the general government, that negative cannot be repealed or overridden in any way Legislative, Executive or Judicial under this Constitution except through the next Constitutional Convention.The reason is that when the Constitution says, for example, that there may be NO  direct taxes, the the proposal to override it, to repeal it, violates the prohibition. The proposal, though it later be an Amendment, is itself at all times Unconstitutional, thus illegal, and null and void! Negatives may not be repealed. I submit that  the 10th Amendment supports this view as well and would love to see it debated.</p>

I wish you were right. But I don&rsquo;t know.  I&rsquo;m not so sure.</p>
<p>I thought after 9/11 we would  finally have learned something; we would clamp down; we would wise up.  But we haven&rsquo;t.  </p>
<p>We went on abetting illegals, tolerating those who hate us,  and coddling the &#8220;religon of peace&#8221;.  We continue importing more of the same.  If anything, we&rsquo;re even worse than before. Nothing has changed!    What will it take?</p>
<p>Our sell-out  politicians are obviously determined to go on with the same program   &mdash;   REGARDLESS OF WHAT!!!</p>

<p>I am going to go postal next time I hear this ridiculous worn-out canard.</p>
<p>This &#8216;logic&rsquo; is also used to justify Special Order (Specious Order) 40 in Los Angeles and stupid Sanctuary City policies  &mdash;  that the &#8216;immigrant&rsquo; community won&rsquo;t come forward to report crimes unless &#8216;protected&rsquo; by Order 40 or sanctuary policies.</p>
<p>There is not a scintilla of evidence that Special Order 40 impels immigrants to report crimes in their neighborhoods.  They don&rsquo;t  &mdash;  but not because they&rsquo;re afraid of the police; they&rsquo;re afraid of retaliation by violent gang members, many of whom are illegal colonists, allowed to roam freely to terrorize entire communities.</p>
<p>New LAPD Chief Beck?</p>
<p>The LA Times online reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Charlie Beck, said he will maintain Special Order 40, which prevents LAPD officers from inquiring about people&rsquo;s immigration status.</p>
<p>&#8216;Special Order 40 is part of the core values of LAPD and that will continue as is!&rsquo; noted Beck, who has also designated Michoacan, Mexico-born captain Rigo Romero to be his Special Agent for the Latino Community&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/7qvtj</p>
<p>Illegal colonists, including violent gang members, have more rights and protection from American police and the DOJ than American citizens, especially White American Citizens.  This is the same DOJ that refuses to charge black panthers who intimidated White voters outside of polling stations.</p>
<p>Tell Everyone You Know.</p>
<p>Those who don&rsquo;t believe me when I mention White voter intimidation by black panthers in Philly  receive an immediate print out of this article:  <br/>
http://tinyurl.com/2uk53ry  from my computer, which I then proceed to read  out loud (in my slowest, clearest, loudest teacher&rsquo;s voice).  Most are shocked, and that&rsquo;s why we must keep spreading the word about any non-White-on-White violence, intimidation or affront.</p>
<p>I am amazed at how few (of those who consider themselves well-informed) have ever heard of this case as &#8216;it wasn&rsquo;t in the papers.&rsquo;  Yeah, no kidding, because it concerned WHITE intimidation.  You can be sure if the races were reversed it would have been international, front page news for months on end. </p>

		<p>Excuse this ignorant Limey but I thought that Pres. Barack Hussein Obama used to teach law theory at some university in the USA.  Surely he has the sense to see that such an action cannot succeed if natural justice is applied and he can quickly recommend that it be dropped as it will have occurred while he was at the big desk in the Oval Office?  <br/>
There are saints, there are sinners and then there are lawyers.  How about a similar civil case against Washington for not ensuring that the federal laws are carried out in this matter as a counter claim.  It would be great if the Washington clsim was thrown out and the claim against the federal felony won.</p>

		<p>When it comes to cops dealing with criminals, they&rsquo;re certainly ready, willing, and able to ignore a bag of weed in order to get info about a murder.  It&rsquo;s no different regarding a criminal who&rsquo;s an illegal.  How many young ghetto men have outstanding warrants, guns, and/or drugs when stopped by police?  These people, as well as illegal Mexicans, are already avoiding the cops, and the Arizona law won&rsquo;t change things.</p>

		<p>Yes herr Holder, all laws push wedges between police and criminals, its a no brainer. What is wrong with a department of justice hierarchy that presses for criminal rights as opposed to the rights of law abiding citizens? If you think we will get rid of the marxist regime we are experiencing at the present, I say think again. I was on the phone just this morning with my seemingly very intelligent attorney, and after discussing the business at hand, I casually asked what he thought of the job our president was doing. I hope you are sitting down, as he said, and I quote, &#8220;I just don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve given him a chance. To think, I have this person handling my affairs? I also asked a dem city councilman his same opinion, and he said:&#8221;It remains to be seen.&#8221; I could certainly recommend a red tipped white cane for that gentleman. During the recent primary It was evident dems were flourishing in my area since 90% of posters were for dem candidates. I have said this before and will say again. I believe there will be no significant gains by republicans in nov., in fact they may actually lose some seats.</p>

		<p>The Holder DOJ is now worried about &#8220;wedges&#8221;? The Obama retinue is certainly adept at lying and spin, I&rsquo;ll give them that. The biggest wedge, as I see it, is between the government and that part of the population that is the productive part, the part that pays the most in taxes and subsidizes the other segments. The DOJ uses people&rsquo;s tax money to finance the attack upon them; we&rsquo;re paying for our own shafting. The reason most people see government as deceitful, manipulative, wasteful, unrepresentative, etc, is because that&rsquo;s what it in fact has become. Obama or McAmnesty, what a pick we had   </p>

		<p>Let the lawyers challenge THIS problem, instead of worrying about Arizona:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aolnews.com/crime/article/mexican-pirates-prey-on-boaters-on-texas-falcon-lake/19495275" rel="nofollow">http://www.aolnews.com/crime/article/mexican-pirates-prey-on-boaters-on-texas-falcon-lake/19495275</a></p>
<p>The endless crime by Mexicans against Americans is anything BUT a myth and a lie. Time for Americans to wake up and DEMAND action from the government, or literally take responsibility for their safety in their own hands. Which is why many of us do carry handguns on our person.</p>

		<p>The feds should assume a state law is constitutional.  They should have better things to do, such as jailing thugs who intimidate voters at polls.  Besides, some left wing outfit such as the ACLU or the SPLC will file suit anyway.  </p>
<p>A problem anyone will have in suing is proving someone is injured by the law.</p>

		<p>&#8220;How can this law put a wedge between the police and the community served? The police serve the American taxpaying public. The illegal aliens are criminals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Istvan, a lot of the police in Arizona are apparently Mexicanos, including the police chief who just recently refused to uphold this law.</p>
<p>The question might be - How in the living hell did foreign people get accepted into our police forces and military? Not to mention the DHS, FBI, CIA, ICE, etc. Talk about ulterior motives and a security risk.</p>

		<p>Feds stay out of state affairs!  Since you refuse to stop illegals from entering our nation, then the states will stop this insanity.  SECESSION NOW!  </p>
