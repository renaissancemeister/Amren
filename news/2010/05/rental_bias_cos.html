<h1>Rental Bias Costs Landlord $1,000</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Deidre Williams, Buffalo News, May 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A South Buffalo landlord will have to pay a $1,000 settlement as a result of an advertisement on craigslist that described an apartment for rent in a &#8220;nice Irish neighborhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because federal and state fair-housing laws prohibit the use of preferential or discriminatory language, Housing Opportunities Made Equal [HOME] began an investigation and dispatched testers to play the role of prospective renters.</p>
<p>According to the federal complaint, property owner Abdul Aljamali asked an African- American tester whether she had children, which is in violation of the state&rsquo;s Human Rights Law.</p>
<p>The white tester also was asked about children and additionally was told that &#8220;there are no coloreds here .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I hope your husband isn&rsquo;t black.&#8221;</p>
<p>HOME filed a discrimination complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which refereed the case to the state Division of Human Rights for investigation and adjudication.</p>

		<p>Poor Abdul.  The hapless man clearly had no idea that simply asking a seemingly reasonable question could land him in serious trouble.  To ask if one had children could have all manner of innocent connotations, from the simply conversational to a desire to point out that the town had excellent schools, or candidly, that it was a rough neighborhood for little kids.  </p>
<p>But of course, to the feds such a question could only have illegal racist implications, though Abdul, whatever his personal attitudes, is probably still wondering how he could get himself into trouble for simply asking if a prospective tenant had kids.</p>
<p>Maybe he&rsquo;ll come to his senses and go back where he came from.</p>

		<p>Historically, south Buffalo has been an Irish, Catholic enclave.</p>
<p>Of course, this can&rsquo;t be allowed to continue so HOME has focused efforts to set up sting operations to ensure there&rsquo;s no housing &#8216;racism&rsquo; going on.</p>
<p>On has to wonder how and where Mr. Abdul Aljamali fits into this Irish, Catholic community and what he has against American-Africans.</p>
<p>HOME must have been thrown through a loop when this &#8216;racist&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t turn out to be Irish or presumably Catholic. </p>
<p>HOME, destroying neighborhoods one home at a time.</p>

		<p>I have a form on which the prospective renter must list all children, and all people that will be living at my house.</p>
<p>I find it hard to believe that this is a violation of some state law.</p>
<p>Abdul  &mdash;  don&rsquo;t say &#8220;Irish&#8221;. Say &#8220;quiet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blacks are anything but quiet.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t pay that fine. Drag it out. Treat that fine like blacks treat parking and speeding tickets.  </p>

		<p>Why is it illegal to ask if a prospective tenement has children.  If I am renting a 2 bedroom apartment I should be able to say sorry  but we can not accommodate your 5 children.  Aren&rsquo;t there occupancy laws?  What is so bad about that?  Who the heck wants to rent an efficiency to a family of 6? </p>
<p>In NJ a public housing resident can not have more than 2 children of the same sex in a single bedroom.  If you have a boy and later on a girl they will move you to a 3 bedroom.  I know of a project, now torn down, that if necessary would join two apartments together to make enough bedrooms for a &#8220;single mom&#8221; and her brood.  Yet a man who his renting his own property would have to let an entire tribe move in?  I have a strange feeling, however, that if his apartment exceeded the occupancy laws he would still be fined.  Darned if you do and darned if you darned if you don&rsquo;t.<br>

		<p>If this guy refuses to pay,and any law enforcement arrests him for failing to pay, then that department and the officer deserves to be charged with racketeering or theft or kidnapping.  Just because a judge does not understand the constitution it is no excuse for a police officer to enforce non-laws.  </p>
<p>Furthermore, if the cop is just as mistaken as the judge over a constitutional matter like this, the cops should not receive immunity when they break the law.</p>

		<p>It sounds like double entrapment. </p>
<p>The Arab man was trying to attract whites by using words which would make them think they were renting among their own kind, and the &#8216;testers&rsquo; were trying to get him to implicate himself as a racist.</p>
<p>&#8216;Human Rights laws&rsquo; produce these ridiculous situations where nobody is telling the truth.  </p>

		<p>This, along with most Western countries that are decaying because of political correctness must be so utterly confusing to foreigners like Mr. Almajali who come from countries where people speak plainly.  For the life of me can someone explain how asking if a potential tenant has children is a violation of &#8220;human rights&#8221;.  A country this absurd cannot survive.</p>

		<p>My husband works at an apartment complex and had to attend a workshop that went over all this nonsense. Turns out that it is now prohibited to use the words &#8220;ma&rsquo;m&#8221; or &#8220;sir.&#8221; It seems that the lunatics running the asylum have decided that this would be age discrimination. </p>
<p>I told my husband that if he ever gets a complaint for saying &#8220;Yes, ma&rsquo;m,&#8221; or &#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; he should sue on the grounds that&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s being discriminated against for being Southern.  </p>

		<p>The poor man probably came to America thinking how great all those new freedoms would be.  Only to find out that, in America, you&rsquo;re not even allowed to care about who your neighbors are.  He buys a nice home in a nice Irish neighborhood (I didn&rsquo;t even know there were Irish neighborhoods these days, but I guess so), and, in respect of the native white inhabitants, makes it very clear that he won&rsquo;t allow any &#8220;coloreds&#8221; rent his property.  And then, out of nowhere, he gets fined $1,000.  I know people do things a little differently bakc where he came from, but really, he should of known you just can&rsquo;t get away with common sense any more in the West.</p>

		<p>It has gotten more and more looney. If he had put in his ad that the property was near a catholic church or a mosque, he would have also been charged with discrimination because he wanted catholics or muslims as tenants but that is not the case, but he was just stating where the property was, nothing more or nothing less.</p>

		<p>Well if I had a business I wouldn&rsquo;t run it in the USA. <br>
I am not allowed to ask whether they have kids, where they are from, what they do, if they are ill&hellip;<br>
How can I run a company in such conditions? Easy, I just go to China: No race problems, no problems to ask the staff anything.</p>

		<p>And people wonder why we are loosing our middle class! How the F- can one even know when they&rsquo;re breaking a law anymore. Can&rsquo;t ask if they have children?!? Only those that all ready have money can afford the legal team required to stay on the right side of the law. Even something as simple as moving goods by commercial transportation needs 17 different pieces of government mandated paper work. We have a corrupted system that favors the wealthy corporation with it&rsquo;s in place legal team. <br>

		<p>These types of housing laws under the guise of &#8220;fair housing&#8221; are really nothing but Government sanctioned crimes against landlords and private property owners.  Most (if not all) &#8220;civil rights&#8221; organizations are really just Socialist&rsquo;s and modern day Marxist&rsquo;s sponsored by the political left wing party of the US Government.  </p>
<p>Landlords and private property owners should be able to do as they please with their own property.  After all, they did pay for it and own it.  When HOME starts paying the property taxes, building maintenance, insurance and mortgage costs, then they can start telling the landlords and property owners whom to rent to.</p>

		<p>   Our federal government has long been out of control. Regardless of whom controls the white house and/or congress. We, the people, can affect the needed changes. I just don&rsquo;t think it can be accomplished at the ballot box, I truly hope I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s kind of funny, since the owner himself would seem to be an Arab, judging by his name.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s clear that freedom of speech is now very seriously threatened. We now live in what is becoming an Orwellian, 1984-esque world.</p>

		<p>I rent my basement and I well remember the &#8220;testers&#8221; calling when we placed an ad in the newspaper. One asked if I minded if he were gay and occasionally dressed in drag and another faked a pathetically bad Asian accent. What we finally ended up doing was placing a free internet ad where the testers did not bother to check about. We nearly had to go to court to get one loser out of our basement who know how to play the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; game. He was a 400 pound Hispanic man who said that we threatened to bodily throw him out when he outweighed both my husband and I! From another family member who has rented for years I have learned how to weed out a potential problem by taking his or her information and telling them that you will get back to them and of course never calling them back. You also drop in a strategic like about another potential renter just having left saying something about going to get deposit money. </p>

<p>Highly amusing, but I can honestly sympathize with the guy, considering that when I was living in Texas I could not sleep due to Mexicans constantly playing loud music late at night.</p>

		<p>   If we are truly free then the property owner should certainly have the right to decide who to rent to . This right ended with the various civil rights bills of the mid-sixties . George Wallace hit the nail on the head in one of his speeches for those old enough to remember ; &#8221; What this bill says is that if your grandmother owns a boarding house and doesn&rsquo;t want to rent to someone for whatever reason, then she can go to jail over it .&#8221; A statement that seemed ridiculously absurd in the sixties when it was said and yet here we are nearly fifty years later and granny could well go to jail for exercising the most fundamental right of a property owner . Who would have ever dreamed we would be able to look back on the sixties ( I was so glad when that decade was over) and think, ah  &mdash;  those were  the good old days . A sobering testimony of just how bad things are getting .</p>
