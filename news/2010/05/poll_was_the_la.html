<h1>Poll: Was the L.A. City Council Right to Pass a Boycott of Arizona?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Thornton, Los Angeles Times, May 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The Los Angeles City Council, protesting Arizona&rsquo;s tough crackdown on illegal immigration, voted Wednesday to ban most city travel to Arizona and future contracts with companies in that state.</p>
<p>&#8220;Council members argued that a new Arizona law, which will make it a state crime to lack immigration papers and requires police to determine whether people they stop are in the country illegally, would lead to racial profiling and discrimination. The law takes effect July 23.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I can think of one contract the city won&rsquo;t be able cancel, let alone modify because of the boycott: service by Arizona-based airlines US Airways and Mesa Air at LAX. Federal regulations prohibit public airports from unjustly discriminating against different carriers {snip}.</p>
<p>The Times&rsquo; editorial board may weigh in on the boycott in the next few days; for now, share your thoughts by taking our poll, posting a comment or doing both.<br>

		<p>This is not a question of opinion.</p>
<p>This behavior is specifically forbidden by our constitution.  Asking if this is right or not is like asking an opinion about any other crime.  It does not matter.</p>
<p>What matters is how that crime is punished.  LA should not be criticized or argued with.</p>
<p>It should be punished.</p>

		<p>It strikes me as rather egomaniacal for L.A. to publicize its boycott of AZ; a CITY boycotting a STATE?  I think it&rsquo;s because L.A. has this egomaniac of a mayor, His Highny Villaraigoso, who tries to get every ounce of publicity he can for himself, via the city doings or by his own actions.  And, of course, we have many Hispanic sympathizers with the illegals here in L.A.  Additionally, the LA Times is one of the most liberal-biased newspapers in the country, so of course THEY&rsquo;d be for the boycott.  The fact is, it hurts L.A. more than it hurts AZ; businesses here need to buy certain products from AZ, and now they can&rsquo;t, which means they won&rsquo;t have the goods to sell.  Neither the Council nor the mayor care at all about local businesses, however.  I don&rsquo;t find it surprising that L.A. would instigate a boycott; I do find it self-serving and self-centered. </p>

		<p>As of the moment of this posting, the voting is so lopsided against the City of LA that one can only conclude that illegal immigrants and their shills in the LA readership area simply don&rsquo;t read the LA Times.</p>

		<p>BIENVENIDES A LOS ANGELES CALIFORNIA!!<br>
This is what I am doing.. printing up signs describing <br>
Los Angeles as it describes its self a Sanctuary City..where all illegals are<br>
protected. Those fleeing Arizona, Idaho, Maryland, Oklahoma..can find a home in LA. It also includes the names and phone numbers<br>
of the California Department of Social Services  and Mayor Villaraigosa&rsquo;s office. I am printing up thousands and leaving them in Hispanic laundramats, stores, churches. In this way millions will descend on LA&hellip;and LA will get EXACTLY WHAT IT DESERVES AND ASKED FOR..more crime, more welfare, more collapsed hospitals, more failed schools. After if you believe in MultiCulutralism and universal tolerance as ideals..then you should pay for your ideals..right?</p>

		<p>I just participated in the poll, and here are the results:</p>
<p>There were a total of 35,521 votes. <br>
To the question &#8220;Was the L.A. city council right to pass a boycott of Arizona?&#8221;, <br>
3% said &#8220;Yes. Arizona needs to feel the consequences of eneacting a bad law.&#8221;, <br>
1% said &#8220;Yes, though the boycott should be more of a symbolic gesture than an official measure.&#8221;, <br>
5% said &#8220;No, but only because doing so is probably illegal and not in L.A.&rsquo;s interests.&#8221;, and <br>
91% said what any sane person would say: &#8220;No. The city should mind its own business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Very encouraging results indeed. In fact, one wonders why the boycott was even passed in Los Angeles if so many are against it.</p>

		<p>Arizona is home to the largest atomic power plant in the U.S.. California has not built a new power plant in at least 30 years. I wonder if they would back off if Arizona would be able to cease sending electricity to California. What a bunch of self important jerks the people in charge of that state are! </p>

		<p>(I posted the following comment on the LA Times poll.)</p>
<p>I hope very much that ALL of the Hispanics working in the restaurant and hospitality industry in Arizona end up out of work because of this boycott. And I hope this has a ripple effect that forces many more Hispanics out of work in Arizona. And I hope they all leave the state of Arizona, hopefully to move to LA, where they will find no jobs to apply for.</p>
<p>Then I hope the state of Arizona starts their own boycott of LA, starting with the electric power and water and natural gas that is sent to southern California, or moved in the direction of California. I hope the state of Arizona boycotts the entire state of California and I hope ALL other states join the boycott against LA in particular and California in general. There is nothing in California that cannot be bought elsewhere.</p>
<p>Then we can do Boston, too!</p>

		<p>This is political theater of the worst sort.  Pandering to a population of which some vote and the Mayor is hopeful the rest will granted voting rights in the future.  Abrogating contractual obligations outside of bankruptcy and force majeur is well-adjudicated law.  No you can&rsquo;t.  Or if you do there will be damages due.  Of course the main stream media fails to mention that issue.</p>
<p>Further California, be very careful how you treat other states as you will be dependent on them to support you with votes for federal funding necessary to fill your multi-billion dollar budget gap.  You know the one that is used to feed and care for those illegals.</p>

		<p>Arizona could retaliate not by just refusing to send power to Commiefornia.  It could refuse to send WATER to commiefornia by blocking the Colorado River, thereby telling commiefornia and LA to &#8220;dry up and blow away&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Someone else reported the results of the poll so I won&rsquo;t bother.</p>
<p><br>
Instead, I&rsquo;d like to comment about them.  LA is a bastion of both liberalism AND immigration.  Yet, over 90% oppose what the city leaders have done.</p>
<p>I think that is illustrative of something important going on in the US, not just with immigration.  Because of the results of what the Obama administration and the Pelosi Congress have been doing, there has been a STRONG break between what the elite liberal leadership wants and what the rank and file of liberalism want.</p>
<p>The tea party is a good example of what I am getting at here.  You have MANY white liberals jumping ship from the dems, giving up a heck of alot of their beliefs and joining with white conservatives to push the GOP to the right and get it elected.</p>
<p>This is a fascinating reversal of what happened a couple of years ago to get Obama elected and reflected in some interesting election results.  Bastions of liberalism kicking out liberal elites, their populations moving to the right.  </p>
<p>What is going on in Arizona is equally interesting.  The people there have been moved very far to the right&hellip;..on the edge of becoming militant (and secretly, I suspect they have moved far beyond into militancy).</p>
<p>Our country has changed politically&hellip;.from being just right of center to being far right&hellip;.with a touch of racial consciousness.  That racial consciousness could easily grow as far right solutions fix problems brought about by race based leftism.<br>

		<p>A round of reciprocal boycotts is going to hurt California more than Arizona.  California is in by far the worse fiscal shape of the two states; they&rsquo;re far more in need of the sales tax money.</p>
<p>The contract cancellations have another angle, besides the obligatory lawsuits; Arizona companies that won contracts with cities like L.A. did so because they submitted the low bids.  By cancelling contracts with the low-bidders, Los Angeles will spend more to get the same projects completed, right at a time when their budget is already blown.<br>

		<p>You think CA and AZ are bad?..try working in Chicago!!!</p>
<p>There are (Per OBAMA&rsquo;s comment on TV and Media) 1/3 of Chicago&rsquo;s population of 10 million HISPANIC, up to 50 percent un-documented illegal aliens.</p>
<p>They have a grip on all manufacturing, construction, and other jobs that most Americans would normally have. My neighbor said this past year that her son who is in college and works landscaping the past 5 years can NOT have his job this year as the entire crew is Hispanic and will not tolerate him!</p>
<p>Also, many of the high paying (50,00 to 80,000) management jobs can NOT be given to white males in manufacturing as they DO NOT SPEAK SPANISH!! Remember, someone has to be in management to supervise these people!!</p>
<p>Not an AMERICAN..but a MEXICAN.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a link to the la times&rsquo; poll:</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/2bkoelk</p>
<p>Mayor villar (the mayor&rsquo;s real name) has to be the dumbest, lowest g-loaded politician in the state. </p>
<p>Here is what villar offered his mayoral counterpart in Phoenix viz. last night&rsquo;s basketball game between &#8216;Los Suns&rsquo; and &#8216;Los Lakers&rsquo; (there were about 75 &#8216;protestors&rsquo; outside of the Staples Center so the pro-illegal la times sent TWO reporters to cover this major event).</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Should the Suns prevail, we will humbly accept ownership of &#8216;American&rsquo;s Toughest Sheriff,&rsquo; Joe Arpaio, Sheriff of Maricopa County. Perhaps a stint in Los Angeles would teach him that you cannot deduce immigration status simply by looking at a person.</p>
<p>We will deliver to you both Steve Poizner and Meg Whitman, Republican candidates for Governor of California, currently battling for supremacy on the issue of illegal immigration. Perhaps some time in Arizona would show them both that being governor isn&rsquo;t always all it&rsquo;s cracked up to be&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>On mayor villar, LA&rsquo;s finest chronicler reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Idiot #1 is this guy. The mayor of Los Angeles. He goes by the name &#8216;Antonio Villaraigosa.&rsquo; His last name is actually &#8216;Villar&rsquo;, but he combined his last name and his ex-wife&rsquo;s last name to come up with something he thought was more radical&hellip; He&rsquo;s failed the state bar exam four times. Four! Other people have already asked if a white politician would have been able to run for office after exhibiting this type of academic aptitude.</p>
<p>This clown was admitted into UCLA with terrible test scores and sub-par grades because of Affirmative Action and behind the scenes political maneuvering -</p>
<p>Many of us know the mayor was raised on White taxpayer money, and it was White taxpayer money that put him through school&hellip;&#8221;</p>
