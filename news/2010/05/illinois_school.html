			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News, May 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Parents in Illinois are outraged over a move by a local high school to scrap its girls basketball team&rsquo;s trip to Arizona over the Grand Canyon State&rsquo;s new immigration law.</p>
<p>The Highland Park High School varsity basketball team has been selling cookies for months to raise money for a tournament in Arizona..</p>
<p>Now, after winning their first conference title in 26 years, the girls are being denied the opportunity to play in the tournament over safety concerns and because the trip &#8220;would not be aligned&#8221; with the school&rsquo;s &#8220;beliefs and values,&#8221; Assistant Superintendent Suzan Hebson told the Chicago Tribune.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We would want to ensure that all of our students had the opportunity to be included and be safe and be able to enjoy the experience,&#8221; Hebson told the Tribune about the tournament. &#8220;We wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be able to guarantee that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Parents said there was no vote or consultation regarding the decision, which they called confusing, especially since they say no players on the team are illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Evans said if for some reason a player was worried about her safety, she could always opt to stay home from the December tournament without forcing the entire team to do the same.</p>
<p>&#8220;This tournament was voluntary, so students could decide not to go if they thought they were at some sort of risk of some sort of harm to themselves, but to penalize all the other girls because of some potential risk? I don&rsquo;t understand it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Evans said {snip} &#8220;The school has sent children to China, they&rsquo;ve sent children to South America, they&rsquo;ve sent children to the Czech Republic, but somehow Arizona is more unsafe for them than those places,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The beliefs and values of China are apparently aligned, since they approved that trip,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>One player, who said she is against the Arizona law, told Fox News she didn&rsquo;t see how the tournament was related.</p>

		<p>This just goes to show y&rsquo;all the lengths to which public education administrators will go today to maintain their oh-so-PC viewpoints and actions.  The fact that it&rsquo;s stupid is irrelevant.  They&rsquo;d probably take the girls to Pakistan before they&rsquo;d go to AZ - what a bunch of administrative hypocrites!!  Isn&rsquo;t it about time we started getting rid of this blight on our educational systems?  They&rsquo;re all the same, you know; public education is mired in PC, and until these idiots are voted out, it&rsquo;s going to stay that way.  This is a HUGE reason so many kids are homeschooled today!</p>

		<p>The unprecedented show of opposition to Arizona&rsquo;s laws by diverse groups has been 40 years in the making, going right back to the 1960&rsquo;s civil rights movement, through cultural Marxism creeping into the national consciousness, to media-manufactured Obama mania. </p>
<p>Whatever momentum it has will bring it face to face with Americans equally supportive of Arizona&rsquo;s law, who&rsquo;ve long been silent to the societal changes imposed on them.  I feel this won&rsquo;t end with one side conceding to the other. </p>

		<p>One thing I&rsquo;d like to bring up about children. Here in NJ recently, teachers have used children as pawns in their fight with towns over pay reductions. Now with this cancellation of this trip, we&rsquo;ve got more politicizing of children. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen this type of thing before. People have no idea what they&rsquo;re doing by using children as pawns and politicizing them. They are opening up a real pandoras box when they do such things. If children ever get it in their heads that they have real power, there&rsquo;s absolutely no talking to them. They&rsquo;re like demons from hell. I&rsquo;ve seen this before.</p>

		<p>An interesting example of something I&rsquo;ve been saying for awhile now.  The US is splitting in two.  Soon there will be two types of areas in the US, those that aggressively exert traditional white values and don&rsquo;t tolerate reditribution of wealth from whites to non-whites via welfare, nor immigration, and those areas that force fascist adherence to multi-culturalism.  The vast majority of the US will be the former while small parts will be the latter.  I&rsquo;m thinking it will be 75%-25% in the beginning.  But as the diffusion of consequences for the latter becomes impossible, much of that 25% will convert.  Maybe all of it, eventually.</p>
<p>Multicultural marxism is a fantasy indulged in ONLY when others are forced to absorb the consequences.  Well, those others are no longer willing.  First there will be separation and conflict (as you are seeing here).  But later&hellip;.conversion.  Eventually, people in illinois are going to start to wonder why they have to put up with ALL the fruits of &#8220;diversity&#8221; while arizona absorbs none.</p>

		<p>All these foolish people aren&rsquo;t going to harm Arzona revenue very much at all.</p>
<p>And, if this issue stays in the news, as I hope it does, these white couch sitters are seeing in bold, living color a side of these non-whites they never would have had this issue not occurred.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a half dozen blacks on T.V. this week arguing against the law, and they don&rsquo;t realize it I&rsquo;m sure, because they&rsquo;re too dense, but they&rsquo;re showing the entire world their desire is not to help Mexicans, but to help bring down the white power structure any way they can.  It&rsquo;s more than obvious, and they&rsquo;re arguments have the effect of hardening the viewer&rsquo;opposition against them.  They would have fared better if they just shut up and not advertise their hate.  That too is easy to see.</p>
<p>As WN&rsquo;s we have had a better couple of weeks here than we&rsquo;ve had in a long time.</p>
<p>The icing on the cake would be for some mestizo group to commit violence of some sort on a grand scale, then let whitey listen to them braying afterwards, making it obvious their real gripe is a hatred of all whites&hellip;.even the foolish liberals on their side.</p>

		<p>The school administrators are probably part of the Bill Ayers school of education. Schools are ideal places to try to indoctrinate the upcoming generation. Now and then a little force is used, as in this case, to push their cause and in the process revealing the truly undemocratic nature of their mindset.   </p>

		<p>I saw two young white girls, members of this team, on the news&hellip;they were utterly heart-broken. That parents will put up with these politically correct shenanigans again goes to show the obscene extent of American cowardice! How can we hope to successfully battle the forces of anti-white Hate, when people won&rsquo;t stand up to this tyrannical nonsense?   </p>

<p>Total foolishness. Smug elitists without any concern or thought to the members of the team or the parents.</p>
<p>I noted in the original article that the reporter didn&rsquo;t spend much time interviewing the students and how they felt. The one girl said she was against the law but didn&rsquo;t see how the team and the law were related.</p>

		<p>the school&rsquo;s &ldquo;beliefs and values,&rdquo; -</p>
<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t the school&rsquo;s beliefs, since it is a public school, be aligned with those of the community it serves?  The school&rsquo;s core beliefs include supporting law breakers but do the majority of parents support lawbreakers?  Someone should ask Suzan Hebson who pays the bills for a public school?</p>
<p>As for going to China, well China does have a system where politcal decent is squashed and that is something Suzan Hebson supports.  On the other hand Chinas tosses illegal immigrants OUT ON THEIR BUMS.  And yes, China does get illegals, mostly from the liberals favorite country, North Korea.</p>

<p>Tom Iron is correct. My wife is an El. Ed. teacher, and she is nearing retirement age. She has HAD IT with the rudeness, the condescension and the ENCOURAGEMENT from her non-White, non-Christian [Somali] parents, whose ideology [Islam] considers my lovely Scandinavian blond wife to be a &#8216;non-person&rsquo; (because she&rsquo;s female - where are the Feminists on THIS ONE, ladies?) as well as a &#8216;heretic&rsquo; (Because she&rsquo;s Christian). How can one teach rude, selfish children, who don&rsquo;t even regard her as a PERSON?!</p>
<p>IF we do not see that Public Education is not only a tool for &#8216;dumbing children down&rsquo; (cf. Charlotte Iserbyt&rsquo;s wonderful site, www.deliberatedumbingdown.com/ ) as well as a  fifty-year goal of the Gramscian &#8216;takeover of the institutions&rsquo;, which started with college in the 1960&rsquo;s and now goes all the way to Kingergarten, and DEFUND ALL OF THIS BRAINWASHING, we have no chance of taking back our country from her ideological (and frankly, racial) enemies who are complicit in this fifth column attack.<br>

		<p>So let me get this straight.  When Arizona was letting criminal aliens cross the border and wander freely, it was safe.  Now that they will be enforcing the law and cracking down on the criminal aliens, it is unsafe.</p>
<p>In Obama&rsquo;s America, this makes perfect sense.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve never been tempted to vacation in Arizona, deserts not being too appealing to me. I don&rsquo;t like the heat and the Grand Canyon is just a big hole in the ground as far as I&rsquo;m concerned. However this bill has changed my mind, and my husband and I will be spending our vacation (and our tourist dollars) in Arizona this year. I&rsquo;m sure we will find plenty to like about the  state, and we will have glowing reports about the lovely places we visit. Thank you Arizona, for opening up new travel horizons and passing laws to make it a safe and wonderful place to visit for white people. </p>

<p>I think a lot of people suffer from media and popular cultural characterizations of Arizona.  All they think about is 100 degrees, cactuses and no water.  In reality, there are a lot cool, high, verdant and moist parts of the state.  In spite of all the goofy green liberals that live there, I absolutely love Flagstaff, love it every time I&rsquo;ve been, and plan on vacationing there again this summer, in support of SB 1070.  I actually compare Flagstaff to Asheville, North Carolina in a lot of ways:  Both along Interstate 40, both white liberal havens in relatively conservative states, both higher in altitude than most of the state, both cooler climes than their states&rsquo; reputations, and both maintaining flora atypical of their states.</p>

		<p>The Highland Park High School administrators are totally to blame here. The students on the basketball team raised the money to pay for the trip. There is not a penny from the school district involved here. The school administrators chose to make a public demonstration of being politically correct imbeciles in the expectation that they would be cheered by the leftist elites. Their scheme backfired completely. </p>
<p>By the way, the new Arizona law will be applied until weeks after the high school basketball tournament ends. For liberals, empty rhetoric always takes precedence over reality.  </p>

		<p>There is a theory that one or more of the players on the team are here illegally.  Even if it&rsquo;s true, then the young lady or ladies in question have nothing to worry about.  First off, the law doesn&rsquo;t take effect until late July.  Second, they don&rsquo;t get asked about their immigration status unless a cop accosts them for another reason.</p>
<p>There was a similar item in the news last week   &mdash;   A 22-year old Haitian-American naturalized citizen ex-HS basketball star took Eddie Money&rsquo;s song, &#8220;I wanna go back, and do it all over&hellip;&#8221; a little too seriously.  So he pretended to be a 15-year old illegal alien from Haiti and was able not only to enroll at Permian High School in Odessa, Texas, the school of Friday Night Lights fame, but also become a basketball star again (like, Duh, a 20-22 year old playing along side 14-18 year olds isn&rsquo;t going to be a standout?), taking his team to the finals of the state tourney. </p>
<p>The main question is this:  Why did the school take him in if he said he was an illegal alien?  Because he had sex with at least one teenage girl while pretending to be a teenager himself, when it reality he was 21, he&rsquo;s facing stat rape charges, along with all the ID misrepresentation raps.</p>
