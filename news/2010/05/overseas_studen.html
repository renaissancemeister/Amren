			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Australian (Melbourne), May 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>OVERSEAS student applications plunged 40 per cent last month following &#8220;abrupt and rapid&#8221; changes to Australia&rsquo;s visa regime, the country&rsquo;s peak education agent warned yesterday.</p>
<p>The crackdown on student visas, coupled with uncertainty caused by the continuing delay to the priority skills list, could cost Australia at least $600 million in lost export revenue, IDP chief Tony Pollock told The Australian.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last month, there was a significant decline in applications from India, Vietnam and China. It&rsquo;s a concern,&#8221; Mr Pollock said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there&rsquo;s a 10 per cent decline over a full year  &mdash;  with each student adding around $30k to the economy  &mdash;  that would be a $600m shortfall, conservatively,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>China and India are Australia&rsquo;s top two source countries for the $17 billion overseas student industry, which employs 125,000 people across the economy, and funds 25 per cent of university teaching.</p>
<p>Melbourne University migration visa expert Lesleyanne Hawthorne said this week the government&rsquo;s policy changes were having the desired effect.</p>
<p>&#8220;The 13 per cent enrolment growth for universities over the past year is correcting the recent mass migration-driven shift to the vocational sector,&#8221; Professor Hawthorne said.</p>
<p>Mr Pollock said universities could not &#8220;take too much comfort&#8221; from the official March enrolment figures for the industry referred to by Professor Hawthorne, given the pipeline effect.</p>
<p>Universities faced &#8220;a pretty tough couple of years&#8221; as the crackdown hit student visas that packaged preparatory courses with a university entry option once qualified.</p>
<p>The financial and educational bona fides of students on dual packages were traditionally assessed on the lower risk profile applying to higher education.</p>
<p>The Immigration Department, however, said packaging was being exploited to reduce the stringency of checks, and it has imposed the stricter assessments applying to lower-level courses.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s tougher to get a student visa, which means people are questioning whether they will ever get a (permanent) visa for Australia, and whether they should look elsewhere to get an education,&#8221; Mr Pollock said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Announcing suspensions of visa categories  &mdash;  even though they aren&rsquo;t student visa classes  &mdash;  and delaying the Skilled Occupation List doesn&rsquo;t help confidence,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Immigration Minister Chris Evans has said changes to the skilled migration program would remove incentives for overseas students to apply for a course to win residency.</p>
<p>Mr Pollock welcomed efforts to clean up the industry, but called on the government to keep the skilled migration pathway open for international students.</p>
<p>&#8220;Offering students the prospect of permanent residency  &mdash;  but only if they are sponsored by an employer  &mdash;  is a very uncertain outcome for those craving certainty,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Similarly, Universities Australia has told the government that preserving a &#8220;quality link between education and migration&#8221; was essential to avoid handing global markets to Europe, North America and Asia.<br>

		<p>&#8220;The crackdown on student visas could cost Australia at least $600 million in lost export revenue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes they could make $600 million, but at what cost in infrastructure, pollution, crime, and the Asian-ification of white Australia?  </p>
<p>This type of thinking maintains that anything that can have a price on it should be offered on the market, so as not to lose out on a business opportunity.  </p>
<p>This is where the old jibe that someone &#8220;would sell their own mother for a dollar&#8221; comes from.</p>

		<p>I believe what you are seeing here is a change in the global elites agenda with regard to immigration.  They are starting to figure out that it is having the exact opposite effect of what they intended.  What they wanted was to get the world to accept marxism on a large scale and use it to gain more power.  But like the original focus on the &#8220;proletariat&#8221;, this new focus on non-whites has been a dramatic failure.  Rather than become a new base of power, non-whites, in all countries are becoming a combination of collapse of these people&rsquo;s very institutions of power and challenging them for power.</p>
<p>Good example of this is mexico.  The original idea was a North American Union with many of the freedoms the US enjoyed curtailed in favor of more power for the elites.  But their open borders policies have, instead, caused the collapse of their power structure in mexico, brought every state to the brink of finanacial collapse and given rise to paramilitary forces in mexico that have about a 50/50 chance of taking over mexico and wiping out the elites there.  Hardly a positive outcome.</p>
<p>All over the world, sentiment against non-white immigrants and socialism is becoming intense.  And I think you will see more and more moves to kick them out.  Not because our elites care about us but because they are finding out the hard way that their fates are linked to ours.</p>

<p>By this guy&rsquo;s direct admission, the reason they&rsquo;re not as interested anymore is because the permanent residency carrot is no longer as obviously being dangled in front of the noses of these third-worlders. This has gone on for far too long anyway. It&rsquo;s become a joke. Even our once well-respected universities have simply become visa factories and taken on so many students they have diminished the value of the degrees, lowered entry standards, created far more competition for local whites and in general sucked the soul of the educational aspect of it and have just totally profitised themselves.</p>
<p>Thing is these institutions have become addicted to all this revenue. Take that away and I&rsquo;m sure a lot would close down. The more established ones should manage, though, they somehow did in the past.</p>

		<p>As an Aussie uni student in Sydney i can&rsquo;t say this saddens me much. Full fee paying internationals are the favoured students for unis here, so i see alot of decent aussie kids miss out on uni places, especially for the high end degrees like medicine/physio/actuarial studies&hellip;. originally being from the country (the only place you can find intact white aussie communities anymore) i also see alot of kids unable to go to uni because of the high cost of moving out of home to the cities. Unless you are really wealthy or really poor the system isn&rsquo;t in your favour, once again the middle class gets neglected   </p>

		<p>What is happening is that Indians (dots, not feathers) get fake letters of credit from Indian banks (crooked) and use them to show that they are self-supporting. They apply to a trade school in Australia. Once in Australia, they work (illegally) typically for corrupt Indians who came earlier. Since they earn little money, they work lousy hours and live in immigrant ghettoes where they are beaten, robbed and raped by other nasty immigrants. Meanwhile, they whine that the &#8220;Australians&#8221; are not protecting them and turn the assaults into international incidents between Australia and India. Racist political groups in India ( that regularly beat and kill Indian Christians) demand action by the government and Australia grovels. The Indian &#8220;students&#8221; who avoid assault by their fellow immigrants ultimately find enough work that they can drop out of school and go underground as illegal workers.</p>
<p>Australians are tired of being blamed for the violence committed by one batch of brown immigrants against another batch of brown illegal immigrantS and being blamed as racists by foreign brown racists. They realized the whole problem is &#8220;brown&#8221; and they are cracking down on the fraud. Surely Indians already know how to cook and don&rsquo;t need to go to school to learn it in Australia, don&rsquo;t they?  </p>

		<p>     Put a few &#8216;educators&rsquo; in the slammer for 5 years. They have run a visa/immigration scam for years; now they should pay. Oops I forgot. Australia is done. Fifteen years too late. Their tiny white population is already overwhelmed. They will be the first to fall. Bet on it.</p>

<p>The reason for coming to Australia for education should have nothing to do with gaining permanent residency. It should be about gaining knowledge and skills and taking it back to their countries in exchange of money. But the fact is most third worlders come to first world countries for education because they find it an easy way to gain residency. <br>
        Those who go back take the skills and techniques invented by White people in ways which hurt the interests of White people. Nearly all computer programming languages were developed by Whites. Idiotic Western universities taught them to Indian students and now these students are using that knowledge to undercut Western programmers and steal jobs from westerners. We should keep our technological advantage for ourselves and our children and not give them away to our racial enemies.<br>

		<p>You know, since we in the West produce so little these days in terms of products, one of the only ways we can get some of that trade imbalance money back is by taking foreign students.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mind this, as it is our last way to make money.  I would just want to make sure that visa rules are followed, and that graduates have to return home.</p>
<p>One a side note, both the Left and the Right are working in tandem to destroy American education with their McCharter schools staffed by college kids who basically are doing peace corp work in American cities.</p>
<p>Our education system was so strong for so long because a person could study for years and become a teacher with the reasonable expectation that they would have some job security.  This enabled them to teach in the classic, Western way without interference from politics or bad admins who want to be corrupt.  </p>
<p>Take tenure away and who will go into teaching, after investing in their education for years?  Teaching is not like cooking or fixing cars.  The teacher has to develop not only content knowledge, but delivery knowledge as well, and wear a lot of other hats as well from surrogate parent to guidance counselor.  </p>
<p>Tying your job to test scores?  If you get a batch of bad kids, and they have low test scores because they have low IQ, and then you&rsquo;re blamed - that is baloney!  </p>
<p>It is a running joke around here on the east coast, and a sad reality, that whichever teacher has kids taking their regents test in the afternoon session - well the kids are tired by then and two-thirds walk out with incomplete or completely guessed tests!  Betcha didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>

		<p>Unlike the Australian student who is saddened, I find this post very reassuring. I am thrilled the numbers of these so-called students has nearly halved. This will mean that many brothels and coffee shops will go without staff, but a small price to pay, and one I am happy to pay, to see thousands fewer of these people crowding our neighbourhoods and roads. </p>
<p>But there are still thousands of them about. I can&rsquo;t really see much of a reduction, where I live in the middle of one of these &#8216;student&rsquo; enclaves.</p>
<p>Like the student, I have been saddened to the point of nervous collapse by the hordes of mindless Asian students whose only interest in study is whether it will get them permanent residence in Australia. </p>
<p>But at last the government is finding that these drones do not add to the economy, apart from the useless girth of once creditable universities; nor do they contribute to electoral success. These self-interested &#8216;students&rsquo; do not support any Marxist agenda-they just want to get rich, and form their own little, exclusive ghettoes.<br>

		<p>The influx of Indians into Australia has been massive.  Not only do they take places in our education institutions but also housing and a lot of casual work positions.  On top of that they bring whole families in many instances.  Another problem is the huge amount of black Africans who bring with them the usual problems of gangs, crime and violence, often brutal violence.  What a mixture!  Not to mention the Middle Eastern Muslims.  Why on earth would you want them in a civilised country?  I say bring back the White Australia policy.  And deport the rest.</p>

		<p>I live in Rural N.S.W and have seen an enormous influx of Black Africans into the little town in which I live as of late. Are there any other Australian posters who know why this is happening? Is the government specifically sending them to rural areas to keep them out of the cities?</p>
