<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>I am an indigent prisoner and cannot afford a subscription to <cite>American Renaissance,</cite> but I did see the July issue. I laughed out loud reading Christopher Jackson&rsquo;s article, <a href="/ar/2009/07/index.html#cover" target="white-teacher" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b> &#8220;A White Teacher Speaks Out.&#8221;</b></a> His portrayal of black students was spot-on, and compelled me to write this account of my own experiences with blacks in prison. Of course, there is no real humor in Mr. Jackson&rsquo;s portrayal; the truth is tragic. The impact of blacks on the larger society and especially on the white children caught in the surroundings Mr. Jackson describes is nothing less than devastating.</p>

</table><p>What made me laugh was Mr. Jackson&rsquo;s portrayal of the way black students speak. The guards here say such things as &#8220;Who you be?&#8221; and &#8220;Where it be at?&#8221; It&rsquo;s deeply insensitive of us, no doubt, but white prisoners entertain each other by mimicking the unique forms of black speech. Mr. Jackson&rsquo;s description of his students applies to a great many black adults as well.</p>
<p>As an inmate in a Texas prison, I am surrounded by blacks and people of other races and must deal with them every day. I have become intimately aware of their traits and mannerisms. I&rsquo;m sure my experiences are paralleled in many other prisons, and are a precursor of what the country as a whole can expect if we continue down the road on which we are traveling.</p>
<p>Like the students Mr. Jackson describes, black prisoners are loud, brash, aggressive, and violate rules almost by nature. Very few show the slightest remorse for the crimes for which they were imprisoned. Instead, they blame &#8220;da man&#8221; or the system run by &#8220;da man.&#8221; Mr. Jackson&rsquo;s students talk endlessly of &#8220;racism.&#8221; So do adult blacks  &mdash;  at least prisoners do. They scheme and fantasize endlessly about ways to beat &#8220;da man&#8221; or &#8220;break the oppression.&#8221; When they are not talking about sex, drugs, crime, or rap music they are whining about how the white man has made their lives miserable. This is how they justify making our lives miserable.</p>
<p>I am housed in an area of the prison known as &#8220;administrative segregation,&#8221; most commonly referred to as &#8220;seg.&#8221; Why am I here? I was &#8220;confirmed&#8221; as a member of a white &#8220;racist&#8221; prison gang.</p>
<p>Any white man in a Texas prison who joins one of the many gangs is &#8220;confirmed&#8221; as a member of a Security Threat Group (STG) and goes to seg. In many cases, a man ends up here for nothing more than having pro-white literature or showing any kind of racial pride or awareness.</p>

</table><p>Once a man is listed as a member of an STG, he goes into a nationwide database and is even listed on government &#8220;terrorist&#8221; watch lists. He stays in that database for years after he is released. When police officers check our names, even during a routine traffic stop, they are cautioned to &#8220;treat the situation as if it were a felony takedown,&#8221; and to consider us &#8220;armed and dangerous.&#8221; This classification has nothing to do with our criminal records  &mdash;  most whites are in prison for non-violent crimes  &mdash;  and even less with any allegedly &#8220;terrorist&#8221; activities. We become STG members simply because we have shown white solidarity.</p>
<p>The STG database is supposed to be available only to law enforcement agencies, and other officially approved groups. It is my impression that organizations like the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League may have access to it because they are supposed to be fighting &#8220;racism.&#8221; As you can see, the STG designation causes big problems for prisoners.</p>

</table><p>Why, then, do we join prison gangs? Prison administrators will tell you it is because we are &#8220;racists,&#8221; &#8220;hate-mongers,&#8221; and  &mdash;  always the most potent  &mdash;  &#8220;Nazis.&#8221; They will tell you we want to participate in organized crime and overthrow the government, and that we believe in crazy conspiracy theories. To be fair, there are a few gang members who fit this mold. However, whites start and join prison gangs for none of these reasons. White gangs have very little real structure and engage in very few organized activities inside prison, much less beyond prison walls. I know. For several years, I was a high-ranking member in one of the largest white prison gangs in Texas.</p>
<p>The number-one reason whites join prison gangs has nothing to do with criminal intent, ideology, or even racial views. They join for survival.</p>
<p>In prison, whites are a minority, especially in high-security and violent areas. As a result, other groups  &mdash;  especially blacks  &mdash;  prey on them. I am not talking about the normal advantage-seeking that characterizes most groups when they are in the majority. I am talking about a palpable, usually violent hatred of whites commonly shown by blacks and other non-whites as soon as they get an edge on whites. Whites have to make common cause with each other for protection.</p>
<p>Whites in jail  &mdash;  and even more so in prison  &mdash;  are set upon as soon as they walk through the door. Most whites, especially younger ones, are completely unprepared. Most have no experience of violence beyond a few school-yard fights. They have an ingrained sense of fair play. They have had only the most superficial interaction with people of other races. They have also been brainwashed to think we are all the same and &#8220;racially equal.&#8221; They are in for a painful education.</p>
<p>In prison, whites learn very quickly that they need a racial consciousness in order to survive. That is just as forbidden here as it is on the outside, so we are the ones who are punished because of racial conflict.</p>

</table><p>If he is very lucky, a new convict quickly gets the help of an older, more experienced white man who can prepare him for what is to come. This older man is usually a member of a gang, though the authorities have not yet confirmed him as one. That is why he is still in the general population. Usually, though, youngsters are simply thrown to the wolves. They are subjected to intimidation, coercion, threats of rape and beatings, and eventually, <em>inevitably,</em> they are attacked. It&rsquo;s not a matter of <em>if</em> whites will face attacks, but of when, how often, and how we deal with them.</p>
<p>As much as it pains me to write this, not all of our young men have a warrior instinct. Many break weak in the face of terrifying odds and end up &#8220;riding.&#8221; This means they have &#8220;a man&#8221;  &mdash;  usually black  &mdash;  to whom they &#8220;pay protection&#8221; in the form of commissary money and/or sexual submission. You can imagine the ridicule and degradation.</p>
<p>Not all whites break weak. Many stand up for themselves, which means they must fight against odds that are always stacked against them. There is essentially no chance for diplomacy or compromise, since many blacks and others see prison as their chance to get back at the white man.</p>
<p>Attacks often come in the form of a &#8220;back door.&#8221; A group of non-whites will surround a white and take turns attacking him. Every minute or so a fresh one takes over the fight, never giving the white a chance to rest. Eventually he is so worn out and beaten that he can hardly raise his fists, much less defend himself. Another form of assault is the &#8220;clique action,&#8221; in which the whole group attacks the white man all at once.</p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="left">
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><img src="/news/2010/05/28/05-l-493h.jpg" alt="prisoner" valign="bottom"></td>

</table><p>These are the most common forms of attack. It is very seldom an honorable, one-on-one attack because their sole intention is either to hurt the white man or make him break weak so they can show dominance over him. Another reason blacks avoid a fair fight with a white is that they cannot stand the stigma of being beaten by a white. They are supposed to think all whites are weak so to lose to one is deeply humiliating. Whites who stand up for themselves therefore face severe beatings against very bad odds. They may suffer permanent damage and even death.</p>
<p>Some men are more vulnerable than others. They may be effeminate or have no ability to fight. Some men are better at talking their way out of trouble than others. Gang members, of course, are usually left alone because of the threat of retaliation by other members.</p>
<p>Some men, out of desperation, arm themselves with a &#8220;shank&#8221; or home-made knife. This is effective because, for whatever reason, blacks, especially, are afraid of being stabbed or cut. This is a risky strategy, though, because it is a serious infraction to be caught with a weapon, and often results in criminal charges. Can you imagine the frenzy of righteous indignation whenever a white, &#8220;racist,&#8221; &#8220;hate-group&#8221; member stabs a minority? Needless to say, it does not matter that he was usually left with no choice if he was not to part with his last shred of dignity.</p>
<p>I would say 80 percent of blacks and Hispanics are already members of street or prison gangs when they get here. Thus they already have a group to which they can turn for protection. Almost no whites are members of anything when they arrive, but a large majority end up joining. They see that the only whites who have some security either carry a shank or are members of gangs that will fight for each other  &mdash;  in short whites whom the other races <em>fear.</em> It&rsquo;s only natural for these young whites to try to make their lives easier.</p>
<p>I cannot think of a single white gang here in Texas prisons that started on the outside. That is simply not the way the vast majority of our people live. And even now, after many years of existence, essentially none of these gangs has any true organization beyond these walls. This is not the case with the non-white gangs. The Crips, Bloods, Gangster Disciples, Mexican Mafia, Texas Syndicate, Raza United, and Azteca  &mdash;  just to name a few  &mdash;  are vast criminal empires. Most started <em>outside</em> prison as criminal gangs and simply maintain their structure on both sides of the wall.</p>
<p>White gangs are lumped in with criminal gangs of this kind, but even worse, they are the only ones labeled as &#8220;racist&#8221; or &#8220;supremacist.&#8221; So the irony is that although most of the blacks and Hispanics come here as full members of racially exclusive street/prison gangs who hate whites, we are the ones who are called &#8220;haters.&#8221;</p>
<p>The administration understands this, of course, but claims it has no control over how they classify us. At the same time, most of the lower-level guards are non-whites who share the same enmity towards us as the other prisoners.</p>
<p>The courts have ruled that no matter how much sense it would make to separate prisoners by race, that is impossible because it would be discrimination against minorities. It does not matter that whites are the ones who suffer most from integration, society must protect the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; of those who prey on us. The irony is that most of the young whites who suddenly find themselves in this hell never had a &#8220;racist&#8221; or &#8220;hateful&#8221; thought until they came to prison and learned the truth.</p>
<p>Whites therefore join prison gangs because they want to survive. They need comrades in a hostile world. They are knowingly put in a position in which, in order to survive with any dignity or self-respect, they must take steps that will leave them labeled as &#8220;haters&#8221; and even &#8220;terrorists.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are other consequences. No one in seg can take part in rehabilitation  &mdash;  no education, job training, or drug abuse programs for us. Since all candidates for parole are expected to have gone through programs of this kind, the consequence is that as a &#8220;confirmed&#8221; gang member in seg, I have <em>no</em> chance of parole. At the same time, all the experts will tell you that training of this kind helps inmates return to society, but there is none of that for us.</p>
<p>I should point out that Hispanic gang members, like whites, are automatically classified as members of STGs. For reason not clear to me, members of black gangs are not automatically classified as members of STGs, and therefore are not automatically put in seg. Because they remain in the general population, blacks are usually required to take <i>rehab</i> classes, and this helps their reintegration into society  &mdash;  at least for those who want to go straight. Their chances of parole are also much better simply because they are not in seg and are not listed as part of an STG.</p>
<p>This &#8220;hate group&#8221; and &#8220;racist&#8221; label makes it hard for us to find work after release, and it also has an effect on our access to various government programs. And this is all because we chose to stand and fight against the hatred of those who blame the white race for every failure of their own race.</p>
<p>I assume that non-whites go into the STG database too, but less frequently than whites. Gang Intelligence (GI) officers have told me that because we are the &#8220;racists&#8221; and &#8220;haters&#8221; we are the troublemakers and have to be tracked even after we are released. It suits the staff to go along with the myth that racial trouble all comes from white &#8220;haters.&#8221;</p>
<p>The policy is really the same here as it is in the rest of society. It is perfectly normal for blacks, especially, to hate whites, so no one pays special attention to it. In prison, whites learn very quickly that they need a racial consciousness in order to survive. That is just as forbidden here as it is on the outside, so we are the ones who suffer most from racial conflict. Whites who never thought in terms of race are forced to do so once they get here  &mdash;  and are then punished for something that was forced on them by blacks and Hispanics who had a strong racial consciousness long before they were even arrested. Don&rsquo;t even get me started on how unfair this is and what we must go through on account of this malicious double standard.</p>
<p>Many people believe that since we are criminals, we have put ourselves in this situation and deserve whatever we get. I agree that we are responsible for our own actions and their consequences. I can&rsquo;t tell you how sick I am of people who prey on society and then start screaming about &#8220;rights&#8221; once they get here. Blacks are notorious for this. But it is wrong to force integration on prisoners and then punish whites for doing  &mdash;  belatedly and less effectively  &mdash;  what the others have been doing all along.</p>
<p><b>Black behavior</b></p>
<p>Whether he realized it or not, when Mr. Jackson was describing black students, he was describing black adults, too. Most whites never see blacks except at work. They never see blacks in groups or in their own neighborhoods. At work, blacks seem polite and normal. However, once the requirements of the job are lifted they are likely to behave differently. What Mr. Jackson described in his students is what you could call the natural state of blacks and it follows many of them into adulthood.</p>

</table><p>You will perhaps have noticed that even black politicians and teachers find it hard to speak standard English, to use grammar correctly, or to structure their sentences properly. Many use multi-syllabic words completely out of context in an attempt to sound more educated.</p>
<p>But black behavior can go much deeper than language, and when the rules of white society are lifted, different patterns emerge. Mr. Jackson wrote about the overt sexuality of black boys, of how boldly they approach white girls. In prison their sexuality is almost out of control. I am no prude, and believe that what two heterosexuals do voluntarily is their business. However, there are commonly accepted sexual proprieties that many blacks ignore.</p>
<p>It is always easy to tell when a female guard, nurse, clerk, etc. is walking the hall because of the tremendous noise that follows her. Blacks will stand in the doors of their cells or line the windows three or four deep, screaming and yelling sexual suggestions and abuse. All women get this treatment: old, young, attractive, homely. Even grandmotherly types who are doing something that benefits inmates, like passing out mail, get the same treatment. Blacks honestly seem to believe that all women, especially white women, are sluts. &#8220;Dem hos be want dat nigga dick!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sexual aggressiveness doesn&rsquo;t end with yelling. Blacks expose themselves and masturbate at the sight of these women, whether it is in the infirmary, in the day room, in the chow hall, in church, in their cells with their cellies, on the sidewalk, or in a group. They ejaculate through the bars, on the floor, against the walls. They seem to have no idea how repulsive they are. Whites  &mdash;  at least the ones who stand up for themselves  &mdash;  will not put up with this kind of public perversity, and it has been the cause of plenty of riots.</p>
<p>A few women seem to enjoy the attention. Some encourage the men by talking dirty or helping them masturbate. Some even have intercourse with prisoners. They may do this in exchange for stamps, which they used to be able to turn in at the post office for money, or even just for a candy bar or a soda. These are extreme cases, and they are usually black women. Most blacks at least seem to take the screaming in stride, and even pride themselves on being &#8220;down.&#8221;</p>
<p>When there are no women to leer at, blacks spend <em>hours</em> talking about which women are &#8220;good&#8221; for which purposes, how to lure female guards into areas where they can be seen, what strokes are best for masturbation, which are the best lubricants, etc. Blacks who masturbate in public call each other &#8220;gun slingers&#8221; and &#8220;jack artists.&#8221;</p>

</div><p>Blacks will sometimes masturbate in the shower area while they stare at a man&rsquo;s buttocks. I assume they are fantasizing about having sex with the man. This kind of thing has led to many fights.</p>
<p>Technically there are rules against masturbating in public and theoretically it can bring criminal action. However, this happens only if a guard wants to go to the trouble of pressing charges and a prosecutor agrees to take the case. Most of the time, the DA would think it was a waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money.</p>
<p>When guards see men masturbating they will usually stop it, at least while they are in the area, but take no disciplinary action. It is so common among blacks that the guards just don&rsquo;t have the time or energy to do all the paperwork it would take to enforce the rules. Most of the female guards simply learn to tolerate it or overlook it. I&rsquo;ve seen plenty of white women work here for just a few days, before they break down and quit. The vast majority of guards are black, especially the women.</p>

</table><p>Finally, since you are wondering, I will tell you what I am in here for: drugs. This is my third time in prison. My first jailing I can more or less excuse as the act of a crazy 17-year-old high on drugs: In 1984 I robbed a dope house. The second time was in 1995 when I did a deal on the spur of the moment, trying to help out a friend. This time I really have no excuse. A few years ago I started using again and got strung out on methamphetamines. I never thought I could get strung out, since I have always considered myself a strong-minded person, but it happened. I had a successful construction business, a good life, and the best woman a man could hope for  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s finished now  &mdash;  and I threw it all away for dope.</p>
<p>My charges are a little complicated, but they all have to do with drugs. I&rsquo;m serving eight concurrent five-year sentences, which is like doing one five-year sentence. I have done about a year and a half, and although I am theoretically up for parole every year, as I explained, I have essentially no chance for parole and no change of getting out of seg.</p>
<p>However, the point of this article is not to write about me. It is to write about what some of us who are already racial minorities have to live with. Our enemies assert that it is nothing but circumstances that make people bad. Nonsense.</p>
<p>There are millions of white men and women in America who have no idea what we are facing. They can afford their delusions because they can still live their lives more or less apart from people of other races. I can imagine America in 50 years when we are a minority and have lost all power. God help us then!</p>
<p><i>When we offered to pay Mr. Lacy our usual fee for this article, he pointed out that because he was fined for his offense, 10 percent of any money entering his criminal account is applied to the fine. Because he was sentenced in 2008 to eight concurrent five-year sentences, 10 percent is taken out for each sentence, leaving only 20 percent for Mr. Lacy. Instead, he asked for books and a subscription to AR. Readers may write to Mr. Lacy, care of AR.</i></p>

		<p>The experiences that a number of our fellow White men face in prison is horrific and must be addressed. It is a disgrace.</p>
<p>That being said, I remember sometime back when a former Black prisoner posted some comments on this website describing his experience in a predominately White midewesterm prison. He went to prison in his late teens I believe, and was incarecerated for a year and a half for stealing over several thousands dollars from two of the places that he worked at. </p>
<p>He discussed being raped, gang raped, occasionally beaten and sodomized by White prisoners. He apparently came down with a disease that has critically affected his health. I recall him mentioning the fact that he was a small guy, less than 140 lbs and under 5&rsquo;5. Undoubtedly he was a prime target for bigger men.</p>
<p>His experience was heartbreaking and chilling. In fact, I remember a number of posters (particuarly female posters) and some former prisoners themselves offering him their sympathy. I myself, felt for this young man.</p>
<p>This was the case of a Black man being targted by White men. I can only imagine what it must be like for White men who are the target of Black men.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sad, sad situation.</p>

		<p>Thanks to the writer for laying the situation out in graphic detail so people can gain some insight into what is going on just out of their sight. The US has a huge prison and jail population which the average person prefers not to think about, a parallel world almost. Although the article gives more information than most people might want it&rsquo;s certainly educational. One can observe how prison culture has percolated upwards into the general culture of society, as reflected by grungy clothing styles, tattoos, slang, music, etc, of blacks and wannabe whites.   </p>

		<p>1 Stop the Madness:</p>
<p>I keep reading this reference from time to time.  IIRC, it wasn&rsquo;t the former prisoner himself, but his aunt who posted here.  And a question I asked but for which I never got an answer is this:  Which state?  </p>
<p>In order to have a state penitentiary that is majority white, the state&rsquo;s population probably needs to be less than 7% black, in my humble guesstimation.  To have a state pen where black inmates are so few that white inmates can have their way with less physically imposing blacks such that there is no fear of retribution from other blacks, this means that the prison has to be just a few percent black itself, meaning the state it&rsquo;s in almost has to have no blacks.  </p>
<p>For example, Missouri is 10% black in population, but about 57% black in its state prisons.  But even that ratio is skewed, because the criminal justice system in the state isn&rsquo;t a level playing field in all places   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s far easier to get sent to prison if you&rsquo;re white and in a rural area, because of the hanging judges and juries that the Ozarks and rural Kraut Belt areas of the state are (in)famous for.  Meanwhile, in St. Louis and Kansas City, you have to do something really bad before you get sent to prison, e.g. 20% of first time armed robbers in the City of St. Louis get no prison time.  So if the playing field were level in all parts of the state, then the percent of blacks in state pens would be even higher.</p>
<p>So, I ask, which states in the Midwest are infinitesimally black in terms of population?  All I can think of are ND, SD and NE   &mdash;   Every other Midwestern state has enough blacks for its state prisons to have a significant percentage of blacks, if not an outright majority.</p>
<p>3 Thomas:</p>
<p>Madoff has already been assaulted a few times, even though he&rsquo;s in a Federal prison (Buitner, NC) that was deemed to be the least risky for him.  I know someone who did two years in Buitner (himself Jewish), and he told me that&rsquo;s where they have Jonathan Pollard.  As for who is assaulting Madoff, it&rsquo;s probably not the extremists on our side of the aisle, because Buitner only has minimum and medium security facilities, and the BFP would put the hard core white right wingers in Maximum.  So the answer is probably just a run of the mill hothead who beat up on him just for the sake of beating up on someone (in)famous.</p>

		<p>That being said, I remember sometime back when a former Black prisoner posted some comments on this website describing his experience in a predominately White midewesterm prison. He went to prison in his late teens I believe, and was incarecerated for a year and a half for stealing over several thousands dollars from two of the places that he worked at. </p>
<p>Poster, this is about a White prisoner and we all KNOW for a fact that it is WHITE inmates that are 99% of the time targeted by Blacks and Hispanics. If this was true what the black inmate said (how long ago was that suppose to have happened?) that would very rarely happen to blacks in prisons. Whites, for the most part, do not want a black &#8220;honey&#8221; in prison or anywhere else for that matter. For every lone black that would happen to, there are thousands of cases where it happens to Whites and we all know it.</p>

		<p>As a white what I guess can be termed &#8220;an average guy&#8221; I have never broken a law other than speeding. Yet increasingly I live with some fears. I know that if I get into trouble whether or not I am right or justified in what I did I would probably be in real trouble with the law. Why? Because in our country today what most accept as common sense is meaninless. I would be at the whim of a judge with a possible &#8220;agenda,&#8221; or tried by a jury that could have members with an &#8220;agenda.&#8221; Even being white could work against me. Political correctness could work against me. And I know prison would be absolute Hell. So sadly, I live each day being careful to avoid any conflict that would bring me into contact with the law. Because I know that being what ordinarilly accepted as right is meaningless in today&rsquo;s world. Sad isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

		<p>Whenever you hear of a friend or a classmate from school going to prison, I&rsquo;m sure there is a thought in the back of your mind that goes &#8220;There but for the grace of God go I&#8221;. Especially if you engaged in some deviant but undiscovered behavior in your teens. </p>
<p>I have a few suggestions, but it would take an incredible amount of political will to make these happen. First, segregate prisons by race. This may not be necessary in SD, ND, and a few other places, but in most states, yes it would. In some states where there are probably a dozen or so Asians in the slammer, they can probably be put in with whites without a lot of trouble. My mother told me that Georgia had segregated prisons, except for the worst of the worst, until the 50&rsquo;s or 60&rsquo;s. If you could make some of these nitwit judges be prison guards for a month and see what really happens, they may not be as gung-ho to come up with these idiotic rulings about throwing all prisoners into the same area, etc. </p>
<p>Second, mandate males only at a male prison and females at a female prison. This would take a change in employment law that 95% of the public would find reasonable. I&rsquo;m sure you will find a series of overzealous judges who will declare this illegal until it goes to the Supreme Court or an order comes down from Congress. </p>
<p>Third, if you wanted to break the prison structure of a lot of these gangs, why don&rsquo;t we contract with Russia, Turkey or some other country that doesn&rsquo;t have the greatest reputation for fair treatment of prisoners. We go to Siberia, build the prisons, pay the guards, etc, and send large numbers of black and Hispanic gang members to one of these isolated places. We&rsquo;ll even allow the Russians to send their bad apples out to the boondocks. I would imagine that this would be a shock to Tyrone or Jorge when he realizes that (A) the guard will not back down under threats of &#8220;violation of civil rights&#8221; and (B) that a bunch of Russian Gang members will not take any slack from these idiots. They may never develop any remorse for their crimes, but they will be in for a world of hurt when they are not under the care, custody, and control of a bunch of bleeding heart liberals. </p>

<p>Absolutely.  That whole teary-eyed story told by poster #1 sounds very bogus, and I do not believe it for an instant. I have been reading Amren for half a dozen years and I cannot recall any such story here.  Even if so, that wouldn&rsquo;t make it true.  Thanks to QD for his usual very analytical, precise boiling down of the facts about Midwestern prisons, which further reduces the probability of that teary tale closer to absolute zero.</p>
<p>As far as Thomas&rsquo; post, it found his concern to be bizarre. Why is he so worried about Madoff, of all peope? And just because his mother had friends who were &#8220;hurt&#8221;, does that make it alright to attack Madoff, but not others?   Really weird.</p>

		<p>#4 is right about the number of blacks in general populations vs. the number in prisons.  Add to that the high mobility of the population.  I live near a small, 3% black WV city where most of the shootings are done by young black men, many from out of town and as far away as Detroit.  <br>
I think the tales about race-related prison rapes and beatings have become so apocryphal that one never knows the veracity of any of them.  Black men are often pathological liars, and many will relate every cliche about racism to them personally.  How many claim to have been profiled by cops while driving or seen some white woman clutch her purse or lock her car on their approach?  Or, less likely, how many claim a grandfather or great uncle suffered discrimination in a restaurant or on a train while German prisoners of war received top service?  </p>

		<p>What the man is saying is 100% true.</p>
<p>I have been in prison 3 times as well. Ive been out for years and dont plan on going back.</p>
<p>I can recall everything this man is talking about.</p>
<p>I was 18 years old. I got busted for theft by receiving. A friend of mine gave me a television, furniture and a few other goodies. I knew it was stolen but needed it more than I wanted it. Im poor.</p>
<p>The other two times were firearms possession. No crimes against innocent citizens.</p>
<p>Anyways, when I hit the &#8216;big time&rsquo; and walked in the cell I was pegged. A black came up to me and told me that a White *boy* doesnt hold his own stuff, that I must &#8216;get in the bag&rsquo; so my things would be protected.</p>
<p>I laughed and told him &#8216;What the hell do I look like letting another man hold my things for me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The intimidation got worse (one said he was going to treat me like a woman) and I ended up shanking the roach 6 times in his chest as he lay on his bunk. I tried to kill him to send a message to the other blacks. They took him to the hospital floor and 66&hellip;count&hellip;66 of them jumped me. They almost killed me. Stomping on my head, picking me off the floor in the cell to slam my head against the concrete walls, kicking my face, jumping up and down on my body. I went to the hospital floor with a screwed up hip, knee and my face was a bludgeoned piece of meat with brogan (prison boots) marks everywhere. My hip and knee aggravates me to this day when the rain comes in. </p>
<p>At visitation&hellip;.I was barely able to walk. My wife (I got married at 17..and still am married to this woman) literally walked right past me because she couldnt recognize me. I had to grunt out of the side of my mouth to show her it was me. I was pretty ugly to look at.</p>
<p>I have never felt hatred like that in my life. </p>
<p>Until that day. The door was opened and it will NEVER be closed. I hold everyone of them responsible because they all think and feel the way of the black inmate.</p>
<p>After my stay at the hospital floor of the prison (one week) the administration put me in the block (seg) for 3 months because I was considered a &#8216;threat&rsquo; to the other inmates. What this man is saying is absolutely, 100% correct.<br>
Never mind that blacks use Whites as a play toy when they enter the dungeon. Never mind that blacks attack innocent Whites (and blacks too). Never mind that blacks holler at the top of their lungs that they hate Whitey&hellip;.The administration gets their panties in a bunch when a True White Man Stands for His Own.</p>
<p>Its White Masculinity the government is trying to kill. Its White Masculinity that offends the lessers. I know this and I let people know it too. Therefore the government stomps down any White Consciousness, Awareness and Pride&hellip;all the characteristics and attributes of Masculinity.</p>
<p>I have seen, within the last 20 years, blacks on the outside mimicking the behavior of the ones on the inside. Ive told people that want to classify me as a (RACIST!!!) that the same people in prison GET OUT and elevate their hatred of Whites&hellip;.and they get the younger ones to &#8216;feel&rsquo; the same way towards Whites.</p>
<p>From the experiences I have had in my life regarding blacks I have been molded into a Bigot. And I make no bones about it.</p>
<p>The dark heart I have towards them is justified and I wont let anybody from the sidelines play that liberal mindset with me. The dark heart I have towards them leaves me with no desire to see them anywhere around me.</p>
<p>I was a hothead&hellip;.but now, Im Serious, but I cant say exactly how I feel, or what I want to do to rid this Nation of this &#8216;people&rsquo;, if you want to call them that, because it wouldnt get posted.</p>
<p>But Im sure 99% of the People here feel the same as I do.</p>

		<p>Fascinating essay.  I can only hope that whites in general can move past the casual, whiny outrage of how whites are treated unfairly in all situations where they must mingle with non-whites and just recognize the fact that non-whites are fixing to commit genocide against whites at the earliest available opportunity.  That is the simple truth of it.   Best deal with it and come to as close to a common survival strategy as possible.</p>
<p>The first step is to recognize that many whites are deep in denial about how much non-whites hate whites and wish them all dead.   Use any event in which whites are attacked and brutalized by non-whites as a teaching moment to the young and the clueless who have often times been subject to much liberal brainwashing in school.   They need to get a clue for their own survival.  </p>
<p>The second step is to recognize that some whites are committed, self-loathing traitors.  They are fully committed to facilitating non-whites in committing genocide against whites.   Usually, they are communist, or what we call &#8220;democrats&#8221; these days.   These people can be identified by playing along with them to make them believe you are one of them until you can get them to spew an anti-white tirade.  I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve heard white men rail against white men.  These kinds of people are crazy.   Look for the ways to identify the, Obama stickers, left wing drivel leaping off their tongues and keyboard.   These people must be persona non grata from your life if you want to survive.   Just know them well enough to get info but not enough for them to know anything meaningful about you.</p>
<p>The third step is getting armed and proficient with those arms.</p>
<p>The fourth step is finding friends and acquaintances with similar beliefs.  This is the tough part because there is so many brainwashed young people and old school white communists out there.  It could literally take years to find people you can count on to back you up should the need arise.  </p>
<p>The fifth step is to be ready for a leader.  When the right time comes, there will be leaders springing up to protect whites from genocide, once it gets recognized as the primary agenda of the Left.   They are certainly awaiting there opportunity to kill off whites, and many of them make no secret about it. </p>

		<p>So glad I&rsquo;m not American. Both the US and Canada are immigrant countries, but there is a noticeable difference. Once you go north into Canada, the atmosphere changes; a certain tension disappears and it&rsquo;s not just because of the culturally mild Canadian temperament, but also likely due to the difference in demographics. America is predominantly White, Black and Hispanic; while Canada is mostly White and Asian. Animosity doesn&rsquo;t exist up here to nearly the same degree as it does in America.</p>
<p>Minorities tend to be racially aware by virtue of being a minority - they will notice that most people don&rsquo;t look like them because it&rsquo;s human nature to do so. Since Whites are the majority culture in America, there will be less racial awareness, but this will ultimately increase as the demographic changes. It&rsquo;s not a question of -if- it will happen, but -when-.</p>

		<p>I can concur with Mr Lacy&rsquo;s assessment of black people.  </p>
<p>I have lived among them nearly my whole life.  Indeed they are nearly totally bereft of self control or restraint, sense of social deportment, altruism, magnanimity, charity, self reliance or ambition.</p>
<p>They are indeed loud, belligerent, aggressive, and, as a whole, quite stupid.  I say this having gone through the Philadelphia public school system from kindergarten until high school.  As a matter of fact I went to Overbrook High school, whose student body at the time was over 70 percent black.  It&rsquo;s two most famous graduates are Wilt Chamberlain and Will Smith.</p>
<p>I lived with worked with blacks on a continuous basis for years and have had them as next door neighbors.  So it&rsquo;s no surprise Mr Lacy and I and countless others have come to the same inescapable conclusions about them.  They are as differnt from White people as, well, black and white. </p>

<p>I will admit that I didn&rsquo;t come up with the idea of outsourcing prisoners to Russia. About 20 years ago, I read an article called &#8220;Simple Solutions to Complex Problems&#8221;. Some of the ideas dealt with things like tying congressional pay and bonuses to the deficit. This was back in the days of relatively low deficits under Bush 41 &amp; Bill Clinton. Forcing bleeding heart liberal judges to live in Cabrini-Green or Pruitt-Igoe style housing projects with no weapons or locks on the doors. Outsourcing prisoners to Turkey; things of this nature. </p>
<p>Do you have white prisoners who would need to be on the wrong end of the foreman of a Russian Chain gang, absolutely. But when you have first time white offenders, what percentage of them are involved in seriously violent crimes as compared to blacks? I&rsquo;m going to agree with # 4 Question Diversity and his statement about skewed sentencing. Do some states have their own variation of &#8220;discipline quotas&#8221;? After the mess of integration, busing, and seeing the school district drop to less than 30% white, we had stuff like this. Little Mary would go see the principal for dropping a pencil on the floor while Tyrone would have to punch a teacher in the face. I wonder if this idea has blossomed into an unwritten rule in the judicial systems. </p>
<p>Some time ago, I saw a TV show on cable called the B***h Wars, also called suka (the Russian term). While most whites here in the US would be mortified at the thought of going to prison, for a lot of blacks, prison is an extension of their living rooms. As Chris Rock once said &#8220;If you live in an old project, a new jail ain&rsquo;t that bad&#8221;. However, one can scarcely imagine the horror of going to jail in a foreign country, especially a place like Russia. Go look up Russian Prisons on Google and see what you can find. They certainly do not have every judicially mandated convenience under the sun. </p>

<p> You&rsquo;re delusional! As another said above &#8220;Do you honestly believe that those two would ever speak out against black on White rapes of any kind? Hardly.&#8221; If this nephew would&rsquo;ve raped a White boy, trust me, his &#8220;auntie&#8221; would&rsquo;ve cheered him on -&#8220;git dat White boy Darcell&#8221;. No, what is &#8220;quite frank&#8221; is that Whites haven&rsquo;t been &#8220;callous and insensitive&#8221; enough, that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re in this pickle to begin with. Back in the day when Whites were REALLY &#8220;callous and insensitive&#8221; towards blacks, black on White crime was extremely rare. You can imagine what the Whites would&rsquo;ve done to them back then if they dared to flash mob on the White side of town. Needless to say, very few of them would&rsquo;ve made it back to the hood alive. But now that we&rsquo;re &#8220;sensitive&#8221;, it&rsquo;s open season on Whites. Being &#8220;sensitive&#8221; to blacks is seen as a weakness to them.   </p>

About broaching the subject to folks you know, one way of doing this is to bring up the issue of illegal immigration since it has been in the news so much lately with the boycott of Arizona. Everyone knows that Arizona is doing the right thing.</p>
<p>When people see the images of those illegals running across our border, people get it.  They really feel violated.  By bringing this up in conversation, you can then segway into the &#8220;reconquista&#8221; movement.  You can inform them of how Arizona is ending the Mexican studies in school because it is teaching kids to hate Americans and white people. Then people will understand that there really is a coordinated effort to destroy us.  There really are communists out there who have been planning the destruction of this country for years by dividing and conquering us.  Even Nikita Khruschev said that they would destroy us from within.  And why wouldn&rsquo;t they do it with so many eager &#8220;Quisling&#8221; communists in this country who use every opportunity to stab us in the back.</p>

<p>I would aruge that the best solution is to segregate non-violent prisoners from violent prisoners regardless of race.  Those Black and White prisoners who are non-violent could be housed together while those Whites and Blacks who are are violent would be forced to deal with one another. The non-violent prisoners would not have to be constantly concerned about being raped.</p>
<p>In fact, it would probably reduce the number of rapes in prison period in that violent prisoners would probably be more reluctant to attempt to rape a prisoner who is more likely to be as violent prone as they are.</p>

		<p>Well, I have two beefs. </p>
<p>First, there must be a case somewhere, sometime of a white raping a black. But there are far more lies about it than real instances   &mdash;   Tawana Brawley, the Duke Lacrosse Hoax, slavery fables, etc. The FBI&rsquo;s annual statistic for gang rape of black women by white men is &hellip; zero! That is, the number is so small it&rsquo;s statistically zero. Maybe a non-hoax went unreported sometime, somewhere. Liberals would be thrilled to find one.</p>
<p>The number of individual rapes of blacks by whites is also near zero. And this is given the fact that there are several times as many whites as blacks, and the FBI counts hispanic perpetrators as white. There just aren&rsquo;t enough white perpetrators for the government&rsquo;s taste, so they pad the numbers! It follows that the number of blacks in prison raped by whites is also infinitesimal. Contrary to the endless lies, whites are not interested, and whites are usually the victims. The demographic that suffers the most rape in the USA is straight white men. Few notice or care, because most of the victimized are prisoners, and also because they are white men.</p>
<p>The FBI&rsquo;s stats used to show the disparities in criminality year after year. See &#8220;The Color of Crime.&#8221; But I don&rsquo;t know about reporting since the anti-white racist hack Attorney General Holder took over. Blacks commit most violent crimes. THAT&rsquo;s what makes the U.S.A. a violent country. </p>
<p>Second subject: Canada. Yes, our great ally still has a far lower proportion of blacks than the U.S. with the benefits that brings. But violent crime is exploding in Canada now, too, following dramatic increases in numbers of violent minorities, like blacks, muslims and hispanics. Toronto has developed no-go areas, like any North American city. Those smart, law-abiding Asians are simply going to dispossess you, as is happening in Vancouver. </p>
<p>The tragedy of Canada is that she had far less diversity than the U.S., and then threw away this real advantage. For some reason, Canada failed to learn from our fatal errors, and suffers the PC diversity mental illness even worse than Americans. We&rsquo;re in a race to the bottom, now. </p>
<p>Search this site&rsquo;s archives, and you&rsquo;ll find countless stories of how diversity has become a clear catastrophe for the Great White North, just like everywhere else. To keep a lid on it, Canada has abolished freedom at a faster pace than the U.S.A. With all due respect, Canadians seem to obsess over petty differences with Americans, while multiculturalism drowns both nations. If you wanted people, you could have had plenty of white Americans. </p>
<p>Not to sound arrogant: if the USA really needed more people in the 1960&rsquo;s, we could have invited more Canucks and Euros. If we weren&rsquo;t immoral and insane, we&rsquo;d take in white South Africans now. All whites, everywhere, need each other, more and more.</p>
<p>To oppose multiculturalism, I feel, is to speak up for both the real America and the real Canada.<br>

<p>So glad I&rsquo;m not American. Both the US and Canada are immigrant countries, but there is a noticeable difference. Once you go north into Canada, the atmosphere changes; a certain tension disappears and it&rsquo;s not just because of the culturally mild Canadian temperament, but also likely due to the difference in demographics. America is predominantly White, Black and Hispanic; while Canada is mostly White and Asian. Animosity doesn&rsquo;t exist up here to nearly the same degree as it does in America.</p>
<p>Minorities tend to be racially aware by virtue of being a minority - they will notice that most people don&rsquo;t look like them because it&rsquo;s human nature to do so. Since Whites are the majority culture in America, there will be less racial awareness, but this will ultimately increase as the demographic changes. It&rsquo;s not a question of -if- it will happen, but -when-.</p>

<p>Sorry, I do not buy what you are saying. Amren has had many articles about the &#8220;immigrants&#8221; in Canada and you have plenty of muslims and black Africans. From the sources I have, there are many White Canadians who would totally disagree with you. As for the Asians, I have read many times about the problems, gangs, and crimes they commit in Canada. Is that okay with you?</p>
<p>As for America still being a White culture, I don&rsquo;t know where you are getting that from. </p>
<p>Also yes, we were an immigrant country, but not until 1965 has it become a NONwhite immigrant country. More like an invading alien force. Before 1965 we were mostly a European immmigrant country, and so was Canada. Notice that this has happened to ALL formerly White nations and about the same time? A coincidence? </p>

<p>Do not agree with this at all. This may have been true in the past by virtue of the fact that Canada was all White but is not true today at all. Immigration in Canada, like most Western countries today, is massive and is rapidly changing Canada and causing all kinds of problems and serious tensions that are no different than the USA or Europe. Many Canadians, like Americans and others throughout the West are totally fed up.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Sending Black prisoners to a Russian prison would be hilarious. If you attack, spit on or even just disobey an order from a guard at a prison in Russia, you will be badly beaten with batons and possibly killed.&#8221; </p>
<p><br>
OR China too. Years ago they had this public broadcast TV series about China. One aspect of the programming dealt with law and order in China. And showed the inside of a prison in China. China as does the U.S. does have a very long history of criminal gang history, so these were not inmates on political charges.</p>
<p>Everyday the inmates are line up in the courtyard and stand at attention for eight hours, staring straight ahead. And that is all!! Guards walk around nonchalantly with the prisoners just staring straight ahead, at attention. For EIGHT HOURS PER DAY.</p>
<p>And no one gets out of line or wants a cig or anything like that. Just stare straight ahead and stand at attention.</p>

		<p>  &#8220;Back in the day when Whites were REALLY  &ldquo;callous and insensitive&rdquo;  towards blacks, black-on-white crime was extremely rare. You can imagine what Whites would&rsquo;ve done to them if they dared to flash mob on the White side of town. Needless to say, very few would&rsquo;ve made it back to the hood alive.   But now that we&rsquo;re &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s open season on Whites.   BEING   &#8220;SENSITIVE&#8221;  TO BLACKS IS SEEN BY THEM AS A WEAKNESS.&#8221;    &mdash;    Tom S.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>Amen to that!  That can&rsquo;t possibly be said enough.  All  manners, kindness, civility,  generosity, sensitivity are wasted on them.  They only perceive these as signs of  &#8220;weakness&#8221;.</p>

&hellip;Recovering Repub.<br>
 </p>
<p>I can remember when Toronto was known as a civilized city, envied by Americans for its cleanliness, civility, safety, and graciousness.  I remember hearing,  up until about 20 years ago, the mid-80s, the remark that:   <i>&#8220;The only difference between Toronto and Detroit is a million blacks.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Well, that difference has been narrowing. It&rsquo;s not so large anymore, although  Toronto is not Detroit just yet. <br>
But they&rsquo;re working on it!</p>
<p>The trendy Lefties used to make fun of Toronto as too staid, too clean, too prim, too Protestant, too &#8220;nice&#8221;.  &#8220;Toronto the Good&#8221; they called it. Nothing exciting ever happened there. (Well, few murders did either.)</p>
<p>Now, they have it all!   Crime, &#8220;minorities&rsquo;, and murders galore.<br>
The old Anglo culture has been put to rout and replaced with mosques, temples, and possibly the largest Chinatown in North America.  How do they like it now?</p>

<p>You make an excellent suggestion. We should be more concerned about segregating prisoners by their behavior. Place non-violent Blacks, Whites and Hispanics together and group aggressive Whites, Blacks and Hispanics together and it would almost certainly reduce the rate of violence among those violent prisoners who are more apt to use force to get what they want. </p>

<p>I just read the piece you were talking about. The author was Michael Walker and the article is in the August 2008 of American Renaissnce. The article is entitled &#8220;What Can I Do?&#8221; The piece is indeed a first-rate one and will no doubt go down as one of the signature American Renaissance articles. </p>
<p>Mr. Walker makes some excellent points about the importance of removing people that he refers to as &#8220;cranks&#8221; and and marginalizing historians from the movement. He also made some excellent observations about the dearth of female participation in groups like American Renaissance and that this is an issue that must be resolved in order for the movement to have any long term success.</p>
<p>His comments on &#8220;cranks&#8221; and misanthropes was the focus and this is point I found most well written and convincing. Sad to say, I do agree that there are far too many people in our movement, including a number of our posters who engage in a callous, &#8220;everyone else who disagrees with me be damned, any non-White with an opinion, I do not care what they think&#8221; attitude when making comments on the board. Far too many of you engage in a &#8220;Harumph, Harumph, all Blacks, all Hispanics, too many White women are &hellip;.. damn, damn, damn&hellip; Harumph Harumph.&#8221; Any non-White who is the victim of White mistreatment is dismissed as an abberation or is supposedly being untruthful or the experience is discounted because &#8220;Whites have experienced such behavior tenfold.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
Walker specifically uses these examples when discussing a british journalist of color who is interviewing a BNP spokesperson. He talks about an example of how smug and dismissive the BNP interviewee was in repsonse to (according to Mr.Walker) &#8220;a reasonable and justifiably concerned&#8221; question about racial immigration by the journalist. Walker goes on to say that the arrogance of BNP member even offended him and undoudtedly turned off many viewers, even those sympathetic to the cause of curtailing non-White immigration.  </p>
<p>We have seen this attitude more than a few times on this board and actually on this current post. It seems that the more resonable voices get attacked by those whose views are more filled with misdirected passion. Comments like &#8220;back in the day when Whites were REALLY callous and insensitive toward Blacks  etc&hellip;&#8221; &#8220;All Blacks are &hellip; all Hispanics are &hellip; too many White women are&hellip; are rash, uncalled for and most certainly prevent reasonable minded Whites, especially those who are probably on the fence in regards to White preservation from joining the movement.</p>
<p>A number of you who have posted on this topic have mercilessly and unnecessarily attacked those who have made it clear of their concern for the circumstances facing our fellow Whites in prison, yet make the case that there are some non-Whites who have been the victims of prison violence as well and thus deserve sympathy for their plight as well. </p>
<p>I cannot understand why any rational person would not believe that there are cases where Whites have and do attack non-Whites whether they be Asians, Hispanics, Blacks, Arabs etc&hellip; While attacks on Whites from Blacks and Hispanics and in some cases (Arabs) are much more commonplace, any reasonable person should be astute to the fact that there are Whites (albeit probably small in number)who are criminally inclined and do commit crimes. It is as almost some of you cannot bring yourselves to admit this fact. </p>
<p>Quite frankly, this is the sort of mindset that separates you from racial realism which is the primary message of American Renaissance. Rather, you are more closely alligned with racial bigots and White supremacists. You do neither yourselves nor the cause of the race realist movement any good.      </p>
<p>I hope more people read Mr.Walker&rsquo;s magnificent piece. It acutally might help weed out (to use his term) &#8220;cranks&#8221; and &#8220;misfits&#8221; in the movement who are currently a potential liability. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;They scheme and fantasize endlessly about ways to beat &lsquo;da man&rsquo; or &lsquo;break the oppression.&rsquo; When they are not talking about sex, drugs, crime, or rap music they are whining about how the white man has made their lives miserable. This is how they justify making our lives miserable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, there is a truth about prisons, and one need not be a black inmate to hold such views; the black staff in such institutions, normally make a point of reflecting the same, or worse exacerbating it, with their arrogantly embraced ignorance!</p>
<p>Here are some hard facts my friends:</p>
<p>1.) I have worked in the criminal &ldquo;justice&rdquo; system for over 12 years now, mostly as a psychologist in jails or prisons;</p>
<p>2.) The criminals that exist within the system, are not to be pitied regardless of race, it is more a function of looking at their crimes and making a judgment based on that which is worse, such as unrepentant child rape versus child support delinquency;</p>
<p>3.) The lone black boy &ldquo;raped&rdquo; in a mostly white prison, is probably a lie or a fantasy that feckless Marxists or sub-stupid blacks have constructed to auger their &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; feelings, for all the young white &ldquo;boys&rdquo; raped in prison daily because forced &ldquo;quantitative integration&rdquo; supersedes qualitative rationality;</p>
<p>4.) If you have questions, feel free to ask them: just don&rsquo;t give me grief if you don&rsquo;t like the answers I give.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all; and of course, welcome to our prison planet!</p>

<p>Every so often, when there&rsquo;s a thread such as this, certain (otherwise unknown) posters pop up from out of nowhere to distract the discussion away from the topic by insisting on bringing up rare and unprovable cases in someplace like North Dakota.</p>
<p>Very well! I agree that rape or abuse of ANY person of ANY race is wrong and deplorable. Now, poster #31, are you satisfied? I apologize for that black boy who was abused. I condemn his abusers. They were absolutely WRONG!   All right?</p>
<p>So now, can we get back to discussing the vast majority of black-on-white rapes which are the rule, and not the few rare exceptions? <br>

		<p>I think a new system should be created, with separate prisons for Whites and non-Whites.</p>
<p>And once given the death penalty, non-Whites, instead of waiting for years for execution, and putting a costly burden on White society, should be excuted no later than a few days after sentencing.</p>
<p>I believe that is how it should be done.</p>

<p>I did in fact read the article after seeing the comments and the debate on this post. It is indeed a great, thougthful read. I thank &#8220;anonymous 1:07&#8221; and &#8220;fan of Michael Walker&#8221;for alerting <br>
to the piece. </p>
<p>Both of you (and a few other posters)confirm the point that Mr.Walker makes in his article. Anonymous at 9:45, at least you acknowledge that you read the piece and disagree with it. You unwittingly and unconvincingly dismiss his article as &#8220;hogwash&#8221;, but at least you read it. You mention the fact that you are female. I am sure that Mr.Walker has no use for female cranks either. They are likely to be just as problematic to the movement.<br>
 <br>
Anonymous at 8:40, you have decided not to even look at the piece. Or maybe you have and it hits &#8220;too close to home&#8221; for you. Therefore, you are in denial. It is no use even trying to have any rational discussion with you, thus you are myopic and irrational. </p>
<p>You posters and several others epitomize the callous, hateful, mean spirited rhetoric that (as few other posters have mentioned) do the movement more harm than good. Indeed, the movemnt might well be better off witout the likes of some of you. </p>
<p>Secondly, if Mr.Walker was such an apologist, why would Mr.Jared Taylor, a sincere, loyal committed White race realist invite him to speak at a conference and publish his articles in the newsletter?  </p>

Poster 31 says this.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot understand why any rational person would not believe that there are cases where Whites have and do attack non-Whites whether they be Asians, Hispanics, Blacks, Arabs etc&hellip; While attacks on Whites from Blacks and Hispanics and in some cases (Arabs) are much more commonplace, any reasonable person should be astute to the fact that there are Whites (albeit probably small in number)who are criminally inclined and do commit crimes. It is as almost some of you cannot bring yourselves to admit this fact.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, this is the sort of mindset that separates you from racial realism which is the primary message of American Renaissance. Rather, you are more closely alligned with racial bigots and White supremacists. You do neither yourselves nor the cause of the race realist movement any good.</p>
<p>I hope more people read Mr.Walker&rsquo;s magnificent piece. It acutally might help weed out (to use his term) &ldquo;cranks&rdquo; and &ldquo;misfits&rdquo; in the movement who are currently a potential liability. </p>

<p>Just a couple notes to both posts.  While typos happen to everyone inkludinq me, those of us who think we are the custodians or Western English language cutlure ought to know how to use that language and its definitions.  </p>
<p>Poster 31 uses &#8220;astute&#8221; out of the range of its application.  If you&rsquo;re going to pretend to sophistication, at least construct your sentences with more care.</p>
<p>#40; Look up and study the meaning of &#8220;apologist.&#8221;  Someone saying they are sorry for something is not what it means.  It means giving a rationalized, but not necessaryily true explaination for events, usually in regards to historic interpretation.</p>
<p>But #40, I am with you.  Amreners and whites must be very aware of the dangers of any movement or individual in that movement that advocates self-purging.  Let us recall how both Hitler and Stalin went about murderng their own perceived ememies or disidents inside their own movements or organizations.  Historians like Gibbons have reported on how early Christians killed more Christians than the Romans or any other party due to rifts and policy disagreements.  It may be human nature, but if whites are as intelligent as they keep implying that they(we) are, we ought to be able to learn from history.<br>

		<p>Why would someone   &mdash;   the very first poster!   &mdash;    rush in to bring up one isolated and very rare case (if it&rsquo;s even factual) and try to equate that extreme exception  with all the thousands of cases that are the norm?  No one here ever said that it was OK to abuse anyone, black or white, and no one condones it.  We are not &#8220;insensitive&#8221;.  But it&rsquo;s obvious that this was an attempt to distract us from the main point of this article which is about the massive amount of BLACK misbehavior and social disfunction,  and not the rare exception of criminal whites allegedly raping a helpless black man somewhere in North Dakota. (To be frank,  I can&rsquo;t even imagine it!)</p>

		<p>Given all of the hoopla over the article, I decided to read Michael Walker&rsquo;s piece. </p>
<p>Anonymous 9:54am:</p>
<p>Apparently we read two different articles. Nowhere does he apologize for the Blak journalists. He stated that he could understand why the journalist may have had certain concerns and that is why he probably asked the question that he did. </p>
<p>I agree with those who say that Michael Walker&rsquo;s is one of the most well-written, though provoking pieces I have read from AR and I have read some very fine ones.</p>
<p>Actually, parts of the piece remind me of Voltaire who so famously stated that &#8220;those who do not understand their opponents arguments do not totally understand their own.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
I also agree that those of you who are so linear in your mindset are more of a liability to the movement and may want to consider joining the more extremist groups like Bill White&rsquo;s, Stormfront etc&hellip; American Renaissance can do without you.<br>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Who are YOU to say that?  Shouldn&rsquo;t that decision  be up to Amren?</p>
<p>There are often disagreements here, and we see many points of view, though none is &#8220;official&#8221;.  We have seen calls for purges here before, from time to time:   for those who are not Christian, those who are not religious, those who are gay, those who are not sufficiently &#8220;conservative&#8221; [by whose standards?], those who are not sufficiently &#8220;white&#8221; or Nordic [again, by whose standards?], and so on.  Such calls for purging and intolerance of other views should have have no place here.  Amren is an open forum for all ideas.  People who are calling for expulsion and demanding only a one-way point of view   &mdash;   for those with the proper purity of views   &mdash;    are really the dangerous and unwelcome ones. </p>
<p>Poster #48 has the nerve to quote Voltaire, who would have <br>
defended [&#8220;to the death&#8221;] their right to express their opinions, even if he disagreed with them, rather than calling for anyone&rsquo;s expulsion!   As whiteplight indicated above, this misplaced pretense at sophistication makes the holder&rsquo;s argument all the more absurd.</p>
<p>Another of our multi-nomial posters, &#8220;Mark&#8221;,  then surfaced to condemn all those who disagree as:<br>
 <br>
<b>&#8220;Myopic, irrational, callous,  hateful,  mean-spirited, and  female cranks.&#8221; </b></p>
<p>He states that,  <i> &#8220;It is no use even trying to have any rational discussion with you&#8221;&hellip;.</i> when he has made no attempt at rational discussion, and has done nothing but fling insults, only ending in advocating the expulsion of those who disagree. </p>
<p>Well, in closing, I must concede that the trolls who have moved in since post #1, have succeeded in taking over and completely sidetracking the discussion from its original topic   &mdash;    which  <b><i>was  </i></b>black male violence and criminality  (not white male violence and criminality).<br>

		<p>From Walker&rsquo;s article.</p>
<p>I recall a British political leader of a white nationalist party being interviewed by a black journalist who made the entirely reasonable point that many colored immigrants were fearful of the suffering that would be caused by any scheme of enforced repatriation. The politician could not hide his condescension for the journalist or his disdain for the question. He insisted that people would simply have to follow the law as it then would be. There was even the suggestion of a smirk on the man&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>This left an unpleasant impression on me, even though I was broadly sympathetic to the scheme. One can imagine what kind of impression it must have made on the great majority of people watching the interview. We must, of course, advance our own interests, but it is wrong to be callous about the interests of others. <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>This is what some of the posters say was not apologetic. I say it is apologetic. Notice how Walker defends the Black journalist and says the White BNP member was &#8220;callous&#8221; and had a &#8220;smirk&#8221; on his face? Apologizing for the White nationalist. Sounds like Obama apologizing for America all over the world. Ever notice all the &#8220;smirks&#8221; on black faces when talking about Whites?</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>Walker goes on and says, being interviewed by a black journalist who made the entirely reasonable point that many colored immigrants were fearful of the suffering that would be caused by any scheme of enforced repatriation.<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>Notice the black guy was &#8220;reasonable&#8221; and then Walker defended the colored IMMIGRANTS just may be fearful of suffering that would be caused by any &#8220;scheme&#8221; of enforced repatriation.</p>
<p>Really? So we cannot believe that repatriation is the only solution or else we are misfits and cranks? Why is Walker so concerned about how that black journalist and colored immigrants &#8220;feel&#8221;? How have these colored immigrants make us FEEL and how have they helped us in anyway to form a civilized and civil nation? Walker reminds me of controlled opposition so that White nationalists will become weaker and softer(get rid of all those misfits) thereby, empowering our enemies even further.</p>

________________________</p>
<p>This New Age touchy-feely concern with sensitivity and how people (particularly your opponents) &#8220;FEEL&#8221; has been one of the curses of the modern world for the past half century. It has rendered us helpless, effeminate, and impotent.</p>
<p>Being &#8220;insensitive&#8221; has become one of the worst sins that anyone can commit in this modern age.   This obsession with &#8220;sensitivity&#8221; and  with not &#8220;offending&#8221; anyone has hobbled us in all efforts at our self-defense.  Meanwhile   &mdash;   are our invaders, attackers, replacements worried about  being  &#8220;sensitive&#8221; or concerned about us?  No!</p>
<p>Britain, France, the USA, Canada   &mdash;   and ALL of the white nations around the world   &mdash;   are presently in danger of losing their countries. Indeed, we ARE losing them while we quibble here on Amren.  This is a critical moment in history  (though our politiccians and newspapers never even mention it). It calls for firm and resolute action. Yet while this is taking place, right under our noses, some teary-eyed individuals are concerned about showing more sensitivity! Too much sensitivity has gotten us where we are.</p>
<p>Let me ask this: During WW2, was anyone urging that we show more sensitivity towards the Axis?  No, and that&rsquo;s why we won the war. We weren&rsquo;t sensitive! We didn&rsquo;t pretend to be.  We bombed their cities and laid their countries waste, but we won the war.   Our whole problem today, frankly, is that we have become too damn sensitive, and we need to get over it!  This is a time for resoluteness, not for maudlin sympathy.</p>
<p>Sweden is a country presently in control of the hand-wringing crowd who are obsessed with being sensitive  (sensitive to others, that is, not to their own).   We can see what is happening there!  Within a mere generation it is becoming non-Sweden and Swedes are being replaced with a multi-racial mishmash of Third Worlders. The Swedish government&rsquo;s only insensitivity is to their own beleaguered people; it will not tolerate any resistance and would clamp down harshly on any who disagree   &mdash;   just as advocates of sensitivity here would do the same on Amren and demand their &#8220;expulsion&#8221;.  I rest my case.</p>

<p>It seems that too many of you are willing to dismiss anyone who disagrees with you as a &#8220;troll.&#8221; From what I have read every poster, including those who have agreed with Michael Walker have made it clear that many White men are going through PURE HELL  in prison. One or two posters said that while they indeed are angered and outraged by the mistreatment of our fellow Whites, that they had read some accounts where non-white prisoners were mistreated by White prisoners. Some said there were two cases where someone&rsquo;s aunt posted about her nephew&rsquo;s experience, another recited case studies that a poster provided on this website about Black prisoners who were the victims of White violence such information and the other mentioned a poster by a former Black prisoner himself who described his plight in a predominately White midwestern prison.</p>
<p>If these stories appeared on this website, then the posters are only reciting what they saw here. Several other posters longtime posters have confirmed that these posts did exist. Thus, why all the shouting and finger pointing? The posters in question are being truthful.   </p>
<p>This is the sort of knee jerk, paranoid reaction &#8220;only my viewpoint is correct&#8221; that causes more harm, hostility and dissension in our movement. </p>

<p>Sorry, &#8220;Ted&#8221;,  you have it the wrong way around. I am not the one calling for &#8220;expulsion&#8221; of those with differing points of view.   Go back and check.

<p>Erick Ericson of the blog Redstate was on C-Span recently discussing how it was not uncommon for people from organizations such as ACORN, The One Peoples Project, Redroom, Alter Net, Daily Kos etc&hellip; to ambush and attempt to manipulate websites that they consdier right of center or (in their minds)racist. He hs several examples of how they do this in packs. One person will post. Several hours later, another person will post. They take turns doing this over a several day period. Moreover, they keep reiterating the same message over and over. It&rsquo;s like chinese water torture. A gnat you cannot get rid of. </p>
<p>This seems to be the case here. It looks as if several posters from various left wing websites have arranged to disrupt our conversation and create discord among our group.</p>
<p>The best thing to do is not repsond. This is what they want you to do. It helps them promote their retrograde agenda of paranoid, bigoted, non-feelings bigots that they wish to showcase to the larger society. It seems that some of you have fell into their trap. </p>
<p>The best thing to do is ignore them.  </p>

		<p>Human Rights Watch report on prison rape:</p>
<p>&#8220;Past studies have documented the prevalence of black on white sexual aggression in prison.These findings are further confirmed by Human Rights Watch&rsquo;s own research. Overall, our correspondence and interviews with white, black, and Hispanic inmates convince us that white inmates are disproportionately targeted for abuse.(214) Although many whites reported being raped by white inmates, black on white abuse appears to be more common&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8216;only a black can turn out [rape] a black, and only a chicano can turn out a chicano.&rsquo;(215) Breaking this rule by sexually abusing someone of another race or ethnicity, with the exception of a white inmate, could lead to racial or ethnic unrest, as other members of the victim&rsquo;s group would retaliate against the perpetrator&rsquo;s group.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Fan of Michael Walker, your post is superb; you&rsquo;ve put into words what I&rsquo;ve felt for a long time but been unable to express. And all of it validated, immediately, with people making laughable, merely cathartic calls for no-nonsense, absolutely foolish action, calling you a troll, writing you off as probably black, and believing that all who agree with you are the same poster!</p>

		<p>The first poster on this thread, unless he is genuinely still so entangled in white guilt that his brain simply won&rsquo;t continue to function unless he cries out, &#8220;whites do it too!&#8221;, must be very pleased at the wreckage that&rsquo;s been made of what should have been a good thread.</p>
<p>Why be so baited by a jerky comment? This was a great article, and so much excellent discussion could have ensued.</p>
<p>The author&rsquo;s statement that white prison gangs are unlike minority prison gangs in not extending into criminal activities outside the prisons may be true in Texas, but I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s true for the Aryan Brotherhood in California, if I&rsquo;m recalling correctly the details of the Diane Whipple death-by-dog-mauling case (and if those details were reported accurately), as reported in the book &#8220;Red Zone,&#8221; by Aphrodite Jones.</p>

		<p>Given that this post is about to expire, I have decided to make a comment as opposed to last week when emotions were running high. </p>
<p>I must admit that was shocked by all the accusations and behvior of a number of posters. I actually had the time to read Michael Walker&rsquo;s article. I would have to err on the side of those who say that the piece is an excellent one. As far as I am concerned, Mr. Walker makes it clear that he is genuinely conerned about the future of White people.  The same can be said for all posters. I think we all are committed to the preservation of our culture.</p>
<p>Therefore, I was very disheartened by the all of the hostile accusations that various posters were making agianst one another. To cut to the chase, I do not belive that a &#8220;bunch of left wing bloggers&#8221; a Black troll,&#8221; &#8220;one sinister poster posted repeatedly comments on the topic etc&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>In fact, I would go as far as to say, that no individual who represeting any of these groups probably are even aware of who Michael Walker is. Moreover, they probably are unaware of American Renaissance. Thus the way that the post denigrated into a wreckage of finger pointing and paranoia was most unfortunate.</p>
<p>The final thing that I will say is that those of us who are committed to the cause of race realism had better find a way to work with one another better than we do and to convince other race conscious Whites that our message is one that needs to be listened to, otherwise, there are many more radical extremeist groups and individuals such as Nationalist Socialist Party, Erich Gliebe and other more extreme groups who will be happy to exploit the fears of our people and fill the void while further weakening the cause of White race realism.    </p>
<p>On this note, I hope that some of you who let your emotions get the best of you over the past few weeks will take heed.</p>
