<h1>Skin Color Affects Ability to Empathize With Pain</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Denise Mann, Health.com, May 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Humans are hardwired to feel another person&rsquo;s pain. But they may feel less innate empathy if the other person&rsquo;s skin color doesn&rsquo;t match their own, a new study suggests.</p>
<p>When people say &#8220;I feel your pain,&#8221; they usually just mean that they understand what you&rsquo;re going through. But neuroscientists have discovered that we literally feel each other&rsquo;s pain (sort of).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Researchers in Italy are reporting that subtle racial bias can interfere with this process  &mdash;  a finding with important implications for health care as well as social harmony.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the study, which appears in the journal Current Biology, people of Italian and African descent watched short film clips that showed needles pricking black- and white-skinned hands. As they watched, researchers measured the participants&rsquo; empathy (i.e., their nervous-system activity) by monitoring sensors attached to the same spot on their hands. They also tracked the participants&rsquo; heart rates and sweat-gland activity, a common measure of emotional response.</p>
<p>&#8220;White observers reacted more to the pain of white than black models, and black observers reacted more to the pain of black than white models,&#8221; says the lead researcher, Alessio Avenanti, Ph.D., an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Bologna.</p>
<p>The researchers also showed clips of a needle pricking a hand painted bright purple. Both the Italian and African participants were more likely to empathize with this intentionally strange-looking hand than with the hand of another race, which implies that the earlier lack of empathy was due to skin color, not just difference. {snip}</p>
<p>The researchers gauged prejudice by testing the participants on how readily they associated good and bad concepts with Italians and Africans. The people who showed a strong preference for their own group in this test also tended to show the least empathy when the hand belonging to the other group was needled, the researchers found.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Even so, the study findings suggest that racial differences and prejudice could play a role in some doctor-patient interactions, especially in the treatment of pain or chronic pain.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we are understanding that if you see someone as being more like you, you can empathize with their pain better,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Race, age, gender, and class probably play a role in how we assess and treat patients with pain.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Yep, just another article that highlights what we all already know. The real question is whether it is right or wrong. Liberals believe it is wrong, we believe it is right. What to do, what to do?</p>
<p>My suggestion would be to tolerate those that are different from you and allow them to seperate themselves and live in peace, that would be called Apartheid. Some cannot accept this and therefore force their wonderful multiculturalism down our throats until utter chaos ensues. Thank you Liberals and our wondrous leaders, thank you.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note exactly how liberal minded people react to studies like this. They don&rsquo;t believe in letting nature take its course but rather like to interfere with stuff they have little to no understanding of. Most would comment and say that these people lack empathy for people unlike themselves and need to &#8220;taught&#8221;, which really means brainwashed, so that they can be more enlightened. In short, they believe that they are some what like God and know what is best for us and will force it upon you against your will.</p>
<p>I really wish that liberals could take a good hard look at their beliefs and see the destruction they cause. Hopefully before it is too late, else World War 3 will be our next destination.</p>

		<p> Notice how the writer tries to imply   &mdash;   somehow   &mdash;   that it&rsquo;s blacks who are going to be &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; by this, and not Whites? The writer does this despite the fact that the study showed that the &#8220;bias,&#8221; if you want to call it that, cuts both ways.</p>
<p> I don&rsquo;t understand why some people would be surprised by the results of this study. It&rsquo;s something that any person with common sense could have told them, just from their own experience. We tend to side with our own, to sympathize more with our own. That is, except for self-hating White liberals. I suspect author Denise Mann is a card-carrying member of that group.</p>

		<p>Remember this article when you awaken from emergency surgery to see a Black face behind the mask on the doctor who has just operated on you. Also remember that the &#8220;doctor&#8221; probably got into med school via affirmative action.</p>

		<p>Yawn. </p>
<p>Really, why is this news? So people actually empathize and identify with their own kind more than outsiders? What a shocker! </p>
<p>The fact that such articles like this even exist indicates how low the west has sunk. Notions of racial solidarity and pride shouldn&rsquo;t even have to be scrutinized or &#8220;revealed&#8221; through &#8220;studies.&#8221; </p>
<p>It should simply be a given. </p>

		<p>Whether they empathize better with their own race having pain inflicted is not the question. The question is whether or not they empathize better with those of their own race who have inflicted pain on a race other than their own. Plus no doubt if white liberals, blacks, or mestizo&rsquo;s were given the second test the results would be overwhelmingly affirmative. You can bet the ranch on that. Even though we all know whites would be found to be the most unsympathetic in all cases. </p>

		<p>This is very interesting (though not really surprising as I suspected this already).  It means that it is now scientifically proven that diversity can damage individual&rsquo;s lives.  Just imagine, a white doctor feels some sort of supressed, hidden bias that leads to him caring more for white patients than for patients of other races.  It would be tragic for a black patient to be harmed somehow by the doctor&rsquo;s bias, but it is bound to happenm, and happen often, if the results of the study are true. I&rsquo;m not much for segregation (except in places like South Africa, where its basically a necesity), but from this study it sounds like segregation would definately have its benefits.</p>
