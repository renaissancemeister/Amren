<h1>Liberian Parents of 9-Year-Old Rape Victim Released</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Kiefer, Arizona Republic (Phoenix), May. 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Liberian couple charged with seven counts of felony child abuse were ordered released from jail Monday because the court cannot find interpreters who speak their languages.</p>
<p>They are the parents of a 9-year-old girl who was gang-raped last summer by four boys who are refugees from the war-torn African nation. The victim&rsquo;s parents were arrested last November after an investigation turned up allegations of child abuse, including beatings, dating to 2007.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The parents were held on $30,000 bond, but Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Susan Brnovich released them to a third-party adult and set release conditions forbidding them from having contact with their daughter or other children. Brnovich also ordered that they surrender their passports.</p>
<p>The parents speak two dialects of a language called Grebo.</p>
<p>Defense attorney Gerald Gavin, who represents the father, said prosecutors have made a settlement offer, but without adequate interpreters, he said, &#8220;I can&rsquo;t explain it to my client.&#8221; It also would be difficult to try the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have nothing firm set because of this problem,&#8221; Gavin said. &#8220;We can&rsquo;t even interview the witnesses properly.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The couple&rsquo;s daughter, then 8, was lured to a storage closet at a west Phoenix apartment complex, then sexually assaulted by four boys ranging in age from 8 to 14.</p>
<p>The oldest pleaded guilty in juvenile court to kidnapping, sexual assault, sexual conduct with a minor and attempted sexual conduct with a minor. He will be sentenced later this month.</p>
<p>The youngest was found incompetent to stand trial and charges were dropped. The second youngest also has been deemed incompetent, and has a hearing next month to determine if charges should be dropped.</p>
<p>The fourth is still undergoing restoration, a process designed to prepare him for trial.</p>

		<p>We do not know how long these parents have been here, but apparently at least 3 yeras.  And they can&rsquo;t speak enough English to stand trial!  Kick them out now.</p>

		<p>Am I missing something here? If these parents can&rsquo;t understand English and nobody can find &#8220;adequate interpreters,&#8221; then how could they understand the terms of their release? And making them surrender their passports is the dumbest part of this whole deal. If they don&rsquo;t have their passports, they can&rsquo;t leave the country and that&rsquo;s exactly what they should do. In fact, if they&rsquo;re so alien to our culture that the courts have to let them go because they can&rsquo;t find an interpreter, THEN WHAT ARE THEY DOING HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE?</p>

		<p>Since this is in Arizona maybe they can deport the rapists and the girl&rsquo;s parents back to Liberia.</p>
<p>As for the girl, she can stay in the US after Sandra Bullock adopts her.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s disgusting. I have never heard of an EIGHT-year-old boy raping someone, in fact eight-year-olds aren&rsquo;t even sexually-developed, are they? Maybe he was egged on by the 14-year-old.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought English was the official language of Liberia, since its founding in 1822.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is, but only 5% of the population is Americo-Liberian (Protestant, English-speaking blacks whose ancestors moved to Liberia back in the 1800&rsquo;s, and and decsended from slaves). The overwhelming majority, therefor, are primitive tribal peoples such as Kru and Mande. If Liberia had been more sucessful in attracting American immigrants, it might ahve been more successful, especially if they had allowed some whites to immigrate as well. But unfortunately Liberia sucked at attracting immigrants, and now their country sucks, too. The Americo-Liberians don&rsquo;t even hold political power any more.</p>
