<h1>Zille Flays Zuma</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brendan Boyle, Times (Cape Town), May 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Helen Zille accused President Jacob Zuma of creating a climate for violence against her opposition DA [Democratic Alliance] by invoking the wrath of the ancestors against defectors from his ruling ANC.</p>
<p>She said Zuma had contributed to a context in which young ANC members disrupted a DA meeting on Monday in Gugulethu, where the parties go head-to-head in a by-election today, and earlier smashed corrugated iron enclosures erected by the DA-controlled city around outdoor toilets in nearby Makhaza.</p>
<p>&#8220;This kind of intimidation happens in a context and that kind of context was created by President Zuma this week when he said that if people did not vote for the ANC, the ancestors would know and would haunt them and make them sick,&#8221; Zille said.</p>
<p>She said his remarks to the ANC&rsquo;s national executive committee last week had also contributed to the climate in which violence could thrive. Saying no one was &#8220;above the ANC&#8221;, Zuma said: &#8220;We must stop allowing the opposition space to spread negativity about our country.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a separate development, the ANC Youth League in the Western Cape threatened to vandalise the centre of Cape Town in a protest against what they said was skewed service delivery by the DA.</p>
<p>Sapa quoted the league&rsquo;s Dullah Omar regional secretary, Loyiso Nkohle, as saying: &#8220;We are going to destroy everything and make the city ungovernable. We are calling on all youth to do this [vandalise the city], especially those living in informal settlements.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zille said the youth league&rsquo;s behaviour was a direct result of Zuma&rsquo;s leadership.</p>
<p>Quoting a report in Beeld newspaper, she said Zuma had told an audience that their ancestors would know who they voted for.</p>
<p>Kenneth Meshoe, leader of the African Christian Democratic Party, also condemned Zuma&rsquo;s use of traditional beliefs to bolster his party. &#8220;It is totally unacceptable that the president could use intimidating tactics to try to regain the support that the ANC is losing as a result of many unfulfilled promises,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Zuma&rsquo;s spokesman, Zizi Kodwa, told The Times that he had used a metaphor in an address to an ANC crowd in Mpumalanga at the weekend and had not implied that people would get physically sick.</p>
<p>He said Zuma&rsquo;s comments did not violate the spirit of the constitutional assurance of a secret ballot and promised the ANC leader would make time to discuss Zille&rsquo;s concerns with her.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was saying that if you don&rsquo;t do what the ancestors  &mdash;  the ANC ancestors  &mdash;  instruct, then they will turn their backs on you and things will not go well, politically speaking,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Kodwa said Zuma had made the comments in the context of a speech about the history and role of the ANC and its former leaders, who are now dead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody in history who has ever broken away from the ANC has ever survived outside the ANC,&#8221; Kodwa said, explaining later that he was referring to political survival.</p>
<p>Zuma has previously been criticised for claiming a divine right for the ANC to rule &#8220;until Jesus comes&#8221;.</p>
<p>He referred to the furore that followed in a recent address to Parliament, saying it was a reality that his party would rule indefinitely. He has also come under fire for ill-judged comments about HIV/Aids and the rights of women and gay men.</p>
<p>Zille said the DA would never resort to violence or illegal activities in the face of ANC intimidation, but DA MP Masizole Mnqasela, who was present at the disrupted meeting on Monday, warned that it was becoming harder to control angry DA members faced with attack.</p>
<p>Zille said ANC members tried to disrupt the Gugulethu meeting while she spoke. Police fired rubber bullets after they were called in to restore order.</p>
<p>DA campaigner Lungiswa Gaza James, who lives in Gugulethu, alleged that a local ANC councillor had participated in the attack and that ousted ANC provincial secretary Mcebisi Skwatcha had watched from a car parked nearby.</p>
<p>Zille praised police for stepping in to protect her supporters, but said there had been further violence against DA members after she left for another meeting.</p>
<p>Earlier, people claiming to be members of ANCYL tore down corrugated iron enclosures built by the city council around toilets left unenclosed in terms of an agreement with the Makhaza community.</p>
<p>Witnesses said youth league ringleaders told residents begging to be allowed to keep the structures that &#8220;the majority&#8221; had decided that only concrete structures would do.</p>
<p>The toilets were built in the open after most residents agreed to enclose the facilities themselves in return for having one toilet per household, rather than the one fully enclosed toilet for every five houses that had been budgeted for.</p>
<p>Zille said the ANC did not want the DA to be seen to be delivering to deprived areas neglected during years of ANC rule.</p>
<p>She said the attacks confirmed a pattern of intimidation linked specially to by-elections in which the ANC faced defeat.</p>
<p>Zille listed nine incidents since August in which DA members had been attacked, stoned, shot at or had their DA posters burned. They included:</p>
<p>* Two DA members were attacked with pick axes and had their houses burned in Daveyton on the East Rand in October;</p>
<p>* Party activist Derrick Love was shot in the neck while hanging posters in Atlantis, outside Cape Town, in December; and</p>
<p>* Also in December, tyres and DA banners were burned and party member Solly Msimanga was injured when ANC members tried to disrupt a meeting in Soshanguve, near Pretoria.</p>
<p>She said it was the sort of intolerance which, if left unchecked by ANC leaders, could drive South Africa towards the political anarchy that has ruined Zimbabwe.<br>

<p>I just had to ask, are these &#8216;ancestors&rsquo; the same blighted geniuses who fell into the belief that if they killed all their cattle and burned their own crops, the &#8216;ancestors&rsquo; would magically oblige them with even fatter cattle and bigger crops -to the effect that the Xhosa tribe (of which N. Mandela claims ancestry) obligingly starved themselves to death?</p>
<p>Just look up the Xhosa tribe on the internet, starved themselves en masse in the mid-late nineteenth century, with these same &#8216;ancestral boogy-men&rsquo; claims. </p>

		<p>Would somebody PLEASE tell me WHY every time blacks are displeased about something their FIRST thought is to DESTROY the place they live???  Destroy the city.  Yeah.  Fine idea.  Even the lowest most vicious animals (I&rsquo;m speaking of the four legged kind) don&rsquo;t destroy their own nests or warrens or dens when angry.  But the two legged animals known as the African?  Whether it be in Africa, America, Europe or any continent but Asia, that&rsquo;s their first response to a &#8220;grievance&#8221;.  They don&rsquo;t do it in Asia because Asians just won&rsquo;t tolerate that.  Too orderly.  Too smart.  Allowed to take pride in their own race.  Won&rsquo;t abide another race acting out like that.  Guess the Asians really ARE the smartest race.  They will probably be running the world after stupid Whites allow themselves to be wiped out by the DUMBEST race on the face of the planet out of stupid &#8220;compassion&#8221; and political correctness.</p>

<p>And this, folks, is truly better than Apartheid. <br>
Liberalism should be considered a mental disorder.</p>
<p>In Zuma really the president now? I thought he was just leader of the ANC&rsquo;s youth group or something to that effect? Has there been an &#8220;election&#8221; in South Africa lately?</p>

		<p>As someone whom escaped South Africa in 1999, the descent that once wonderful country, yes even for the black masses many of whom migrated form the countries to the north to take part in the &#8220;white mans prosperity, even under Apartheid, I can assure all that the country is going to the dogs.  Look at this web site as it is typical of most of the cities now in SA.  I used to live in Durban in the 1970s and visit there for holidays in succeeding decades until we escaped 5 years after the new terrorist government came to power.  Now the photos show what it is like under the African National Congress and black administration.  Forget about the white man responsible for sanitation as he is just a figurehead to be blamed.  Taxes for the cleaning have been milked off and anyway, who would leave the rubbish as in the photos but barbaric people.  Even the cruise ships have stopped calling in due to a lot of passengers getting mugged while shopping.</p>
<p>Look at web-site:  <a href="https://deathofdurban.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">https://deathofdurban.blogspot.com/</a>  There is a similar one for Johannesburg, etc.</p>

		<p>Hauntings? Political solicitation of crime? Yikes, let&rsquo;s not have anything to do with this backward, heckhole of a &#8220;nation&#8221;, that is apparently run by 8 year old mental deficients. </p>
<p>Oh, their black Africans? </p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;d hate to be called a racist so&hellip;</p>
<p>In light of this fact, let us all come together and &#8220;celebrate&#8221; the accomplishments and forward thinking of those in charge of South Africa since 1994. Let us also stand by and applaud the noble Africans for their systematic rape and slaughter of the evil Europeans who lived there for 500 years making ZA an undeniably first world country.</p>

		<p>South Africa used to be a very rich, and scientifically advanced country. In fact, the country that pioneered things such as surgical heart transplant.</p>
<p>But all good things must end, as the saying goes; control of the government was given to Blacks, and South Africa has become a Third World country, with a Stone Age culture&hellip;</p>
<p>This should be something to reflect on, for the American citizens who chose to elect a part Kenyan mulatto (who identifies himself a simply Black, though), as president of the United States.</p>

		<p>Funny hearing complaints from one of the anti-Apartheid activists that destroyed South Africa.</p>

<p>Something tells me the entire reason to create the opposition party was precisely to CONTROL people who would otherwise fight back against the Communist government.</p>

<p>Thought I would just correct you there mate. </p>
<p>Jacob Zuma is the president of South Africa, he was elected by the stupid masses with a 65 % majority vote in the April 2009 elections. The leader of the youth league is the amazing Julius Malema. Julius Malema at least has passed grade 6, our president has not. Yes folks, be glad Obama at least passed his schooling years and went on to get a degree even though it was Affirmative Action based. Our president has not even got to high school. How did he become South African president? I know, I know it just really gets on my nerves.</p>

		<p><em>Zille said the youth league&rsquo;s behaviour was a direct result of Zuma&rsquo;s leadership.</em></p>
<p>And Zuma&rsquo;s leadership is a direct result of Zille&rsquo;s behaviour. This is what she agitated for, for years.</p>
<p>Zuma has had a total of four years&rsquo; schooling. This more than qualifies him to represent his political constituency.</p>
<p>&#8220;Making the city ungovernable&#8221; is the same strategy that worked so well for the ANC in taking over the country.  Now that the ANC finds itself unable to take over the last local government by winning elections, it is resorting to its default strategy. Which, to tell the truth, also guides its administration.</p>
<p>A few years ago, a mob, frustrated by late-running trains, burned down the station in Pretoria.  This is the Bantu&rsquo;s knee-jerk reaction to any frustration. Burn the station down to make the trains run on time. Despite Zuma&rsquo;s &#8220;clarifications&#8221;, you can bet that the voters got the message: Zuma has got a witch-doctor to put a spell on the election, and if they don&rsquo;t vote ANC, they will die.  They believe in this stuff so fervently that some of them probably would die. Not many would take the risk.</p>
