<h1><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8660940.stm">Neanderthal Genes &#8216;Survive in Us&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Rincon, BBC News, May 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Many people alive today possess some Neanderthal ancestry, according to a landmark scientific study.</p>
<p>The finding has surprised many experts, as previous genetic evidence suggested the Neanderthals made little or no contribution to our inheritance.</p>
<p>The result comes from analysis of the Neanderthal genome  &mdash;  the &#8220;instruction manual&#8221; describing how these ancient humans were put together.</p>
<p>Between 1% and 4% of the Eurasian human genome seems to come from Neanderthals.</p>
<p>But the study confirms living humans overwhelmingly trace their ancestry to a small population of Africans who later spread out across the world.</p>
<p>The most widely-accepted theory of modern human origins  &mdash;  known as Out of Africa  &mdash;  holds that the ancestors of living humans (Homo sapiens) originated in Africa some 200,000 years ago.</p>
<p>A relatively small group of people then left the continent to populate the rest of the world between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago.</p>
<p>While the Neanderthal genetic contribution  &mdash;  found in people from Europe, Asia and Oceania  &mdash;  appears to be small, this figure is higher than previous genetic analyses have suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are not totally extinct. In some of us they live on, a little bit,&#8221; said Professor Svante Paabo, from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.</p>
<p>Professor Chris Stringer, research leader in human origins at London&rsquo;s Natural History Museum, is one of the architects of the Out of Africa theory. He told BBC News: &#8220;In some ways [the study] confirms what we already knew, in that the Neanderthals look like a separate line.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, of course, the really surprising thing for many of us is the implication that there has been some interbreeding between Neanderthals and modern humans in the past.&#8221;</p>
<p>John Hawks, assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the US, told BBC News: &#8220;They&rsquo;re us. We&rsquo;re them.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seemed like it was likely to be possible, but I am surprised by the amount. I really was not expecting it to be as high as 4%,&#8221; he said of the genetic contribution from Neanderthals.</p>
<p>The sequencing of the Neanderthal genome is a landmark scientific achievement, the product of a four-year-long effort led from Germany&rsquo;s Max Planck Institute but involving many other universities around the world.</p>
<p>The project makes use of efficient &#8220;high-throughput&#8221; technology which allows many genetic sequences to be processed at the same time.</p>
<p>The draft Neanderthal sequence contains DNA extracted from the bones of three different Neanderthals found at Vindija Cave in Croatia.</p>
<p>Retrieving good quality genetic material from remains tens of thousands of years old presented many hurdles which had to be overcome.</p>
<p>The samples almost always contained only a small amount of Neanderthal DNA amid vast quantities of DNA from bacteria and fungi that colonised the remains after death.</p>
<p>The Neanderthal DNA itself had broken down into very short segments and had changed chemically. Luckily, the chemical changes were of a regular nature, allowing the researchers to write software that corrected for them.</p>
<p>Writing in Science journal, the researchers describe how they compared this draft sequence with the genomes of modern people from around the globe.</p>
<p>&#8220;The comparison of these two genetic sequences enables us to find out where our genome differs from that of our closest relative,&#8221; said Professor Paabo.</p>
<p>The results show that the genomes of non-Africans (from Europe, China and New Guinea) are closer to the Neanderthal sequence than are those from Africa.</p>
<p>The most likely explanation, say the researchers, is that there was limited mating, or &#8220;gene flow&#8221;, between Neanderthals and the ancestors of present-day Eurasians.</p>
<p>This must have taken place just as people were leaving Africa, while they were still part of one pioneering population. This mixing could have taken place either in North Africa, the Levant or the Arabian Peninsula, say the researchers.</p>
<p>The Out of Africa theory contends that modern humans replaced local &#8220;archaic&#8221; populations like the Neanderthals.</p>
<p>But there are several variations on this idea. The most conservative model proposes that this replacement took place with no interbreeding between modern humans and Neanderthals.</p>
<p><b>Unique features</b></p>
<p>Another version allows for a degree of assimilation, or absorption, of other human types into the Homo sapiens gene pool.</p>
<p>The latest research strongly supports the Out of Africa theory, but it falsifies the most conservative version of events.</p>
<p>The team also identified more than 70 gene changes that were unique to modern humans. These genes are implicated in physiology, the development of the brain, skin and bone.</p>
<p>The researchers also looked for signs of &#8220;selective sweeps&#8221;  &mdash;  strong natural selection acting to boost traits in modern humans. They found 212 regions where positive selection may have been taking place.</p>
<p>The scientists are interested in discovering genes that distinguish modern humans from Neanderthals because they may have given our evolutionary line certain advantages over the course of evolution.</p>
<p>The most obvious differences were in physique: the muscular, stocky frames of Neanderthals contrast sharply with those of our ancestors. But it is likely there were also more subtle differences, in behaviour, for example.</p>
<p>Dr Hawks commented that the amount of Neanderthal DNA in our genomes seemed high: &#8220;What it means is that any traits [Neanderthals] had that might have been useful in later populations should still be here.</p>
<p>&#8220;So when we see that their anatomies are gone, this isn&rsquo;t just chance. Those things that made the Neanderthals apparent to us as a population  &mdash;  those things didn&rsquo;t work. They&rsquo;re gone because they didn&rsquo;t work in the context of our population.&#8221;</p>
<p>Researchers had previously thought Europe was the region where Neanderthals and modern humans were most likely to have exchanged genes. The two human types overlapped here for some 10,000 years.</p>
<p>The authors of the paper in Science do not rule out some interbreeding in Europe, but say it was not possible to detect this with present scientific methods.</p>

		<p>So if there&rsquo;s a supposed .1% genetic difference between the races, and pure Africans lack Neanderthal DNA, but everyone else has 1-4% Neanderthal DNA, there&rsquo;s something wrong with one of these assertions.  Also, if the only Neanderthal genes expressed today are the useful ones, and pure Africans lack Neanderthal DNA, what are the observable differences between pure Africans and the rest of the human species?  There&rsquo;s certainly NO place like Africa.  Maybe the Neanderthals gave us something precious.</p>

		<p>The genetic difference between humans and chimps is two percent, I believe.</p>
<p>It sounds as if Neanderthals were their own race or races. They evolved in a different environment from the rest of humanity, had their own physical and behavioral characteristics, yet could interbreed with other humans, so they were not their own species.</p>
<p>The percentage of genes that came from Neanderthals could have been much higher in earlier times, but if Neanderthals were less intelligent or had other bad genes, then those genes may have been weeded out over time through natural selection to become the low one to four percent they are now.</p>

		<p>This is huge news! While four percent may not seem like a big deal, that&rsquo;s the equivalent of your great-great grandfather being a Neanderthal. The fact that these genes have survived in us for all these thousands of years means that these genes have a selective advantage. Recognize also that this study only sampled only five populations and when further studies are done on more human populations the percentages may increase for certain ethnic groups. Also since this study only compared Neanderthal DNA to modern human DNA it only accounts for similarity between those two groups. Another study just revealed this week that there is evidence of another cross species mating in Oceania, most likely with homo erectus. This would account for  Papuan and Aborigine differences from Eurasians.</p>
<p>That study is here:<br>

<p>You may have something there, Resist. Europe, when Neanderthal Man lived there, would have been like the Arctic is now - only by inherent wilyness, toughness and cooperation could anyone have survived there - totally unlike ancient (and modern) Africa, warm and fertile, where dominance is mostly a matter of outbreeding the competition. </p>

		<p>As I recall from High School biology the Neanderthal had a larger brain than Homo Sapiens (Humans). Perhaps some DNA for intelligence or self-control was passed to early Europeans and Asians which allowed them think long-term to survive the harsh winter environment.</p>

		<p>Several people have mentioned that the numbers don&rsquo;t add up. That if someone is 1 to 4% neanderthal that it&rsquo;s an even greater difference than the one between humans and chimpanzees. But the math does add up. Think about it this way - humans and chimpanzees share 98% of their DNA. Let&rsquo;s suppose a human and chimpanzee had a child. We&rsquo;ll call this child Leroy. Now, Leroy would get half his DNA from each parent making him 50% chimpanzee. But the difference between Leroy and either the human or chimpanzee parent would only be half the difference of that between the chimpanzee and human - approximately 1%. So 50% chimpanzee DNA equates to only a 1% genetic difference for Leroy. Neanderthals were 99% similar to other humans. So non-africans having 4% Neanderthal DNA equates to a difference of approximately 0.04% which I actually find disappointing. I was hoping it would be greater.</p>
<p>Also, some people have suggested that the ability to interbreed is what determines whether two animals are of the same species. This is false. There are many animals of different species which can successfully interbreed. What determines whether two animals are of the same species is the &#8220;genetic distance&#8221;. Or, in the case of humans, political correctness. Most people would be surprised to learn that there are actually several animals considered separate species whose genetic distance is actually LESS than that between human races. No doubt someone is doubting this and probably thinking about the infertility of mules. But mule infertility is the result of a chromosome incompatability affecting their reproductive system, not genetic distance. In fact, some mules are fertile and they are called &#8220;mollys&#8221;. Though most pregancies result in miscarriage there have been documented offspring.</p>

These idiots are so starved for attention, they will have us imagine anything to succeed. Is there really any intelligent life left on earth? Hey does this prove there really is a difference in the races? They had better watch out for the hate speech police on this one.

<p>And it was maddening to read the smug assertions that our ancestors had not interbred with the Neanderthals.  It was so obvious that this was wrong, to anyone who&rsquo;s had a good look at the more indigenous Europeans, such as Polish and Austrian &#8216;peasants&rsquo;.</p>
<p>GenX ANZAC, you made an extremely good point.  A one-point difference in DNA is all that stands between Humans and murderous, face-eating Chimpanzees.  By the logic you hinted at, we are as different from Africans as Humans are from Chimpanzees (doubly-so, if 2% is the average).</p>

		<p>Yes, Mike Katz has a point, as the average 175 lb Neanderthal was apparently over 3 times stronger than a modern, fit, 215 lb male, along with having much denser bones throughout their structure than any group of modern humans. Some scientists have posited that Neanderthals were probably very fast, especially for what would be considered an untrained runner. Wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad idea to clone these fellas, train them, then send them in to clean out the ruined areas of the United States that have become filled with peoples who behave in much more primitive fashion than Neanderthals ever did. </p>

		<p>Agree with #5, Peter K: this is big news. Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending speculate about introgression of Neandertal genes in their recent book (http://tinyurl.com/287lrzt). They attribute the Upper Paleolithic revolution to intelligence-enhancing genes drawn from Neandertals, and note that the revolution did not occur in the population that migrated along the Indian Ocean to Australasia, but only in the population that migrated into Europe, Central Asia, and East Asia.</p>

		<p>The  Neanderthals  survived  in Eurasia  for  some  400,000  years,  yet  they  were  no  match  for the  incoming  Africans  &mdash;  in  terms  of  knowing  how  to  adapt  to  the  new  conditions.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s  important  though  is  that  the  Neanderthal  tool  kit  was not  anything  to  shout  about: just basic rudimentary  tools  less  advanced  than  what  the  migrant  Africans  brought  in. </p>
<p>If  the  Neanderthals  &mdash;  despite  their  larger  crania  than modern  homo  sapiens  &mdash;  acquired  cognitive  skills in  the  cold  region  of  Eurasia  and  Europe  proper  then  the  incoming  Africans  &mdash;  supposedly from  a  less  challenging environment would  not  have  survived. </p>
<p>Yet  we  have  the  opposite: The  Africans  survived and  after  a  few  surface  adaptions in  Europe,  Asia and  Australasia continue  to  exist  in  these  areas. Homo Erectus  and  the  Neanderthals although  surviving  for  a  relatively  long  time  all  fell  by  the wayside.</p>
<p>So  it  is  just  that  Homo  Sapiens  from  Africa had  all  the  right  stuff. </p>

		<p>   Leave a man and woman alone long enough for the hormones to start flowing and propriety goes right out the back door, sad but true . Really disappointed to hear once again I may be &#8221; out of Africa .&#8221; I would rather be a Neanderthal . I thought they had just decided that man may have evolved in more than one region of the earth . It appears more and more that science is indeed not a very exact science . I am just a working class layman, but I know what I see . I am not judging, I am not being malicious or presuming myself and my kind to be superior, just different . My wife shops, I sit in the car and watch people . And while there are many different types within one ethnicity and what I would call overlap between different ethnicities . Neanderthal was powerfully built, heavy boned and the brain cavity was really to the rear of the skull where as modern man has the propensity for it to be centered right above the brow . Neanderthal had more cranial capacity but modern man is by far, smarter . A real mystery . While I see Neanderthal traits in all, I see them most in Africans . And believe me, where I live, we&rsquo;ve got plenty of Africans . Again, a real mystery .  </p>

		<p>After reading books like <i>Before the Dawn</i>, and <i>The 10,000-Year Explosion</i>, I&rsquo;m wondering if black Africans should be placed on a different evolutionary branch than whites and Asians.  Whites and Asians descended from the first modern humans  &mdash;  the &#8220;out-of-Africa&#8221; group  &mdash;  at least 50,00 years ago.  And some of those first modern humans remained in Africa, becoming the African San or Kalihari Bushmen of today, to whom they were genetically similar. (In other words, evolution slowed down in Africa at that point).  </p>
<p>However, black Africans, such as Bantus, apparently did not descend from those San-like people and so did not descend from the first &#8220;modern&#8221; humans.  Instead, it seems that blacks and the first moderns share a common ancestor.  Therefore, blacks could be a different branch of humanity than whites/Asians/San and, potentially, <i>an earlier form of human being</i>.</p>
<p>Can anyone clarify this?  I really don&rsquo;t think genetic anthropologists have delved into the question of when blacks evolved, since that would be &#8220;troubling.&#8221;  I don&rsquo;t think blacks are <i>homo erectus</i>; they are an offshoot from <i>homo erectus</i> or a later, nearly-modern transitional stage  &mdash;  but in a different direction than modern humans.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just using the data from the above books and drawing a different, non-PC conclusion.  Since I haven&rsquo;t heard this before, I&rsquo;m calling it the Hastings Hypothesis!</p>

		<p>The dogmatic &#8216;Out of Africa&rsquo; theory that has held sway over past 20 years holds that ALL human populations outside of Africa are descended from one, single small band of colonists who left Africa around 200,000 years ago.Apparently, according to this theory the emigrants did not hybridize with extant hominids in Eurasia (of which,we know, due to fossil evidence were legion), whom the theory postulates died-out with no trace.<br>
 This dogmatic theory was pushed bombastically by the anthropolgical establishment, brow-beating (no pun intended), the previous widely held, multi-regional hypothesis, out of contention.<br>
 It is the &#8216;generally accepted&rsquo; orthodoxy.<br>
A few brave researchers, such as Ronald Fonda, have disputed the OAA theory for years on purely genetic and scientific grounds and it now appears their dissent is vindicated.<br>
  The implications for &#8216;race relations&rsquo; are enormous.</p>

		<p>Just as I have long suspected!  For one thing, two human populations don&rsquo;t coexist for ten years, yet alone ten thousand years, without at least having sex.  If there were any genetic compatibility whatsoever, interbreeding would occur.  If I&rsquo;m correct, Neanderthals are scientifically recognized as Homo Sapiens Neanderthalensis, while moderns are Homo Sapiens Sapiens.  <br>
They say that blood calls to blood, and I personally have always felt the call of the Neanderthals.  In fact, there is a very widespread and keen interest in our (yah!) ancient ancestors.  <br>
Now the Africans can claim superiority because they haven&rsquo;t been found to be &#8220;tainted&#8221; with these genes.  Of course, the vast majority of American blacks are part European, so too bad!</p>

		<p>The evidence really doesn&rsquo;t point to a Neanderthal/Eurasian mix. The two groups could have shared a genome without intermixing, and this theory has already been put forth. If Neanderthals and Modern Europeans mixed, then examples of Neanderthal atavism would have appeared among modern populations. Perhaps scientists should gather gene samples from individuals who appear to have Neanderthalic traits. But then, that would be genetic profiling.</p>

<p>Occam, your logic here would hold if there were evidence that in Europe, H. Neanderthals and H. Sapiens did NOT interbreed. The pure Neanderthal types were not able to adapt to a warmer climate, but this new evidence indicates that something of them lives on in those of European and Asian ancestry - and maybe that accounts for other differences so noted upon on this website. Those of European and Asian ancestry are not the same as Homo Sapiens from Africa for a different reason - our ancestors got up and left, entering regions of the world that required strengths and strategies not needed in the tropics.</p>

<p>Actually, the shovel shaped incisors are a trait of Asian homo erectus, not Neanderthal, which didn&rsquo;t have a range into eastern Asia. Peking man has the concave incisors, which the vast majority of Asians also have. This leads to the obvious conclusion that there must have been further admixture between east Asians and homo erectus as the chances of both groups developing this trait separately are minuscule. </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a whole lot more to the story of human evolution that we don&rsquo;t know yet and as more genetic data begins to unfold, the out of Africa theory will fall to pieces.

		<p>Daniel #4: <i>It sounds as if Neanderthals were their own race or races. They evolved in a different environment from the rest of humanity, had their own physical and behavioral characteristics, yet could interbreed with other humans, so they were not their own species.</i></p>
<p>Actually the high school text book definition of species is not always used in practice by biologists.  For example, members of the genus <i>Canis</i> can generally interbreed and produce fertile offspring.  In nature wolves and coyotes will often share the same territory but hardly ever interbreed, because wolves prefer to mate with wolves and coyotes prefer to mate with coyotes.  So they are considered to be distinct species.  But it is possible for a wolf to interbreed with a coyote and produce fertile offspring.  I think Neanderthals will continue to be regarded as a separate species regardless of whether there has been some interbreeding with Homo sapiens.</p>

		<p><i>Yes, Mike Katz has a point, as the average 175 lb Neanderthal was apparently over 3 times stronger than a modern, fit, 215 lb male, along with having much denser bones throughout their structure than any group of modern humans. Some scientists have posited that Neanderthals were probably very fast, especially for what would be considered an untrained runner. Wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad idea to clone these fellas, train them, then send them in to clean out the ruined areas of the United States that have become filled with peoples who behave in much more primitive fashion than Neanderthals ever did. </i><br>
Actually more strength does not necessarily mean faster. In the Olympics, Africans dominate running, although Europeans don&rsquo;t do badly. Weightlifting, however, tends to be dominated by Eastern Europeans (if one discounts roided-up Chinese); Europeans in general appear to be the strongest race when it comes to brute force, consistent with our having a small fraction of Neanderthal blood.</p>

Perhaps the bigger brain case, being advantageous, got passed to Europeans and Asians, but Homo sapiens had a better brain case <i>shape</i> for reasoning and analysis than Neanderthal. Inheriting both the Homo sapiens&rsquo; better brain case shape and the larger Neanderthal brain case size might explain why Europeans and Asians have the highest average IQs.</p>

How it got to be that way doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that it did get to be that way.</p>
<p>Personally, I like the news. It jives with common sense - if the two hominid subspecies were interfertile they would have mated (and apparently they did); the Neanderthals, having lived separately for half a million years, undoubtedly developed at least some allelic variations more adaptive than those their &#8220;cousins&#8221; had, and our ancestors put them to good use. If they were bad, or weren&rsquo;t of any use, they would&rsquo;ve been driven from the gene pool long, long ago.</p>

And so much now for the Rushton/Lynn hypothesis that the survival challenges of Eurasia forced evolutionary changes of a cognitive nature on the regional populations that lived there. Just not true now.</i></p>
<p>How is the Rushton/Lynn hypothesis disproven?  First, we must recognize at least 3 major climates under which humans evolved:</p>
<p>1.  The tropical and semi-tropical climate of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>2.  The temperate climate of most of current Eurasia, with harsh winters but spring, summer, and early fall suitable for agriculture.</p>
<p>3.  Extreme arctic conditions, unsuitable for agriculture but which can be inhabited by hunter gatherers with sufficient knowledge and experience.  The Aleuts are among those people who live in such a regime.</p>
<p>What evidence we have is that Neanderthals were a cold adapted species (or subspecies) of human and had no agriculture.  Like the Aleuts, they were adapted for a type 3 climate and were primarily hunters.  When the climate was cold enough, Neanderthals had the edge over Homo sapiens.  From Wikipedia:</p>
<p><i>At some Levantine sites, Neanderthal remains in fact date after the same sites were vacated by Homo sapiens. Mammal fossils of the same time period show that cold-adapted animals were present alongside these Neanderthals in this region of the Eastern Mediterranean. This implies Neanderthals were better adapted biologically to cold weather than H. sap. and at times displaced H. sap. in parts of the Middle East when the climate got cold enough</i></p>
<p>When the climate moderated much of Eurasia moved to a type 2 climate and agriculture became feasible, but it was still necessary to prepare for harsh winters.  So the evolutionary forces that Rushton and Lynn describe were at work on Eurasian Homo sapiens, independent of whatever amount of genetic admixture there may have been with Neanderthals.  Given that most of what we call civilization was achieved by Eurasian Homo sapiens (whether white or Asian) those Neanderthal genes don&rsquo;t seem to have done us any harm, and may have done some good.<br>

		<p>The fact that Neanderthals were replaced by Africans does not necessarily mean the Africans were superior. After all, today&rsquo;s Europeans are being replaced by Africans AT THIS VERY MOMENT.</p>

&ldquo;Europe&hellip; would have been like the Arctic is now. Only by toughness and cooperation could anyone have survived - totally unlike ancient (and modern) Africa, warm and fertile, where dominance is mostly a matter of outbreeding the competition.&rdquo;  &mdash;  Cugel</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>&#8220;Good point! &ldquo;Quality&rdquo; (as we understand it) is irrelevant to Mother Nature. She is indifferent. As we see happening right now, beneath our eyes, whoever breeds the fastest wins the game and ultimately prevails.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt;Actually, Europe was warmer before the last ice age, some 10,000 years ago.  The archeology I have read says that the groups that had to retreat south before the advancing ice seemed to have moved up as it warmed.  It is likely that African homo sapiens followed them up.  The point is that the European Neanderthal period was before the last ice age.  That would mean that the ability to adapt would have little to do with the why of how the N&rsquo;s disappeared (new N word?).  It is more likely that it was population ratios that did it, just as it seems to be doing it today.</p>
<p>However, there is another big IF here.  Homo Sapiens in Africa must not be supposed as equivalent to &#8220;modern&#8221; blacks.  Just as European whiteness developed to suit conditions over tens of thousands of years, an increase in melanin production via genetic modification over the same time period in more sunny regions would have also developed.  This is why projecting today&rsquo;s racial definitions too far into the past is somewhat misleading and faulty.<br>

		<p>   I don&rsquo;t believe this &#8220;Neanderthal genes&#8221; business one bit.  DNA is so degraded after an organism dies that it becomes rather doubtful to believe the scientists could &#8220;write programs&#8221; correcting for the degradation.  Who is to say that the alleged &#8220;1-4%&#8221; dna similarity&#8221; couldn&rsquo;t just have arisen spontaneously as natural mutations?  I remember reading some time back about some neaderthals probably had red hair. In that case the genes were different for the effect in the two species. I think there is an agenda-driven reason for these &#8220;results.&#8221;  Diversity, and race-mixing politics skewing the results. Today&rsquo;s scientists are often just as gutless as the white &#8220;diversitoids&#8221; marching off into the racial sunset.</p>

Is there anywhere any record of a debate / discussion/ among<br>
scientists inclined to varied positions about human evolution?  As far as I can sense, &#8220;bone&#8221; scientists and &#8220;gene&#8221; scientists have never gotten together under the same room anywhere??  </p>

		<p>The &#8220;OOA&#8221; theory is a fairly tale concocted by those who wish to drive whites into the dirt. </p>
<p>The size of the cranium doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean a more developed brain. A smaller brain with more neurological efficiency and/or more convolutions (allowing for more matter in a smaller space) can be &#8216;smarter&rsquo;. Keep in mind for all the talk about brain size, the largest brains in terms of raw size on average are those of Hawaiians, Samoans and some other Polynesians. </p>
<p>Amongst Caucasians and Asians, there is a .3 to .4 correlation, but that leaves a lot of room for bright people with &#8216;small&rsquo; heads or brains. </p>
<p>Africans have never really demonstrated much as a group when it comes to higher cognitive development. </p>

That makes sense only if you believe literally in the bible, and I don&rsquo;t. <br>
I am a Darwinist and  on the far right. As far as you can get.  I am unconcerned about the bible.<br>

<p>That is your right.  </p>
<p>However, neither any religion on earth, nor any ancient peoples, nor any psychic in history supports Darwin&rsquo;s &ldquo;theory&rdquo;.  </p>

<p>Where did I say I&rsquo;m an &#8220;atheist&#8221;?<br>
I said I don&rsquo;t literally believe the Bible.<br>
And where did Darwin say anything about descent from &#8220;black Africans&#8221;?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible how someone can take a simple statement and interpolate all sorts of extra things that aren&rsquo;t there!<br>
You are confirming once again my statement about hogwash.</p>

&lsquo;the Neanderthal tool kit was not anything to shout about: just basic rudimentary tools less advanced than what the migrant Africans brought in&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Are you serious?</i></p>
<p><i>To this day the Africans still don&rsquo;t own a tool that the white man hasn&rsquo;t given them.</i></p>
<p>Yes, Africans had tools before they encountered the white man. They used spears for throwing and hunting, for example. How do you think they ate?</p>
<p>They also carved ceremonial masks and other religious totems, which required some kind of tools.</p>
<p>True, they never conceived a wheel, imagined a sailing vessel, domesticated animals, built a multi-story dwelling, etc., but let&rsquo;s not overstate our case here.</p>

<p>There was no such thing as &#8220;the migrant Africans&#8221;.  </p>
<p>This supposition implies that African blacks migrated to the four corners of the globe and their IQs miraculously doubled and then they magically transformed themselves into whites, Orientals, Asians, etc.  </p>
<p>This just goes to prove that liberal adults still believe in fairytales&hellip;    </p>
