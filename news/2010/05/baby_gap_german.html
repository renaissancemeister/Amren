			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tristana Moore, Time, May 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Germany is shrinking  &mdash;  fast. New figures released on May 17 show the birth rate in Europe&rsquo;s biggest economy has plummeted to a historic low, dropping to a level not seen since 1946. As demographers warn of the consequences of not making enough babies to replace and support an aging population, the latest figures have triggered a bout of national soul-searching and cast a harsh light on Chancellor Angela Merkel&rsquo;s family policies.</p>
<p>According to a preliminary analysis by the Federal Statistics Office, 651,000 children were born in Germany in 2009  &mdash;  30,000 fewer than in 2008, a dip of 3.6%. In 1990, German mothers were having on average 1.5 children each; today that average is down to 1.38 children per mother. With a shortfall of 190,000 between the number of people who died and the number of children who were born, Germany&rsquo;s birth rate is well below the level required to keep the population stable.</p>
<p>&#8220;The German birth rate has remained remarkably flat over the past few years while it has increased in other low-fertility countries, like Italy and the Czech Republic,&#8221; Joshua Goldstein, executive director of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, tells TIME. &#8220;Women are continuing to postpone motherhood to an older age and this process of postponement is temporarily lowering the birth rate.&#8221; According to Goldstein&rsquo;s research, Germany has the longest history of low fertility in Europe.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The Federal Statistics Office says Germany&rsquo;s population of 82 million could drop by up to 17 million over the next 50 years. Demographers fear a shrinking workforce will stymie growth and struggle to foot the bill for a rapidly aging population. &#8220;Germany&rsquo;s working-age population is likely to decrease 30% over the next few decades,&#8221; says Kröhnert of the Berlin Institute for Population Development. &#8220;Rural areas will see a massive population decline and some villages will simply disappear  &mdash;  Germany will become a weak economic power in the future.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Germany, Japan, and all of the other countries that are shrinking in population can survive ONLY if they make an extreme effort to exclude alien outsiders, and make some adjustments in their economy, and their work and labor practices.All of the hand wringers and chicken littles that complain about lower population are those who will lose some of their wealth because of it.</p>

<p>Who is that guy kidding?  Birth rates among native Whites are rapidly dropping all over Europe.  Birth rates have increased in Italy and the Czech Republic?  Who&rsquo;s having the babies?  I&rsquo;ll bet it&rsquo;s not the natives!</p>
<p>France has been trumpeting the &#8220;success&#8221; of its pro-natal policies.  Only trouble is, the French mysteriously have yet to break it down by ethnicity to show us who exactly is having those kids.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/17/AR2006101701652.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/17/AR2006101701652.html</a></p>
<p>My guess it&rsquo;s because the leftists there don&rsquo;t want the French to know they&rsquo;re being edged out of their own nest by the 600-lb. cuckoo bird in the room (i.e. Middle Eastern and African immigrants).</p>

		<p>Unlike non-whites, whites (in general) have children when they feel the time is right.  If you see Turkish flags flying from apartment building windows and a growing non-German population, a confiscatory tax rate, high under and unemployment, when you feel there is no future you may not be inclined to have children.</p>
<p>Stop the de-Germanization of Germany.  Stop non-German immigration and encourage non-Europeans to leave.  Improve employment prospects for German men so that fewer German woman have to work outside of the home.  Help German families buy homes by forgiving a percentage of their mortgage for each child born.  Raise the retirement age.  easy, probably not but it is better than extinction!<br>

		<p>Actually, this could be a great long-term benefit.  True, the German Baby Boomers will be in for an ascetic old age.  But thereafter, there will be fewer old people to support, and a smaller population in Germany.  The relative spaciousness will be a precious commodity, and other nations will be envious.  Germany should concentrate on stopping immigration, letting the population get smaller, then reaping the social rewards over the next 50 years.  But they&rsquo;ll need a strong military to keep others out who won&rsquo;t want to begrudge the Germans their country.</p>

		<p>This demographic disaster, which is plaguing all western nations, is probably even worse for the survival of western ethnicities than mass immigration and miscegenation. Its strange though, everywhere I look white women are having babies as usual, and yet statistically the figures show that we aren&rsquo;t having nearly enough children to maintain our current population levels.</p>

<p>Nonsense.  The real danger before that happens is the threat of overpopulation and a depletion of resources.</p>
<p>Here it is one more time, the leftist, radicals contribution to trying to psyche the gullibles into becoming hysterical over the threat of zero population.</p>

		<p>I was expecting the usual template when I read this article that Germany needs to import millions of black Africans and Middle Easterners to boost the economy and enrich the stale whitebread German culture.  After all, they&rsquo;ve done wonders in their own countries, haven&rsquo;t they?  I was pleasantly surprised that immigration wasn&rsquo;t even mentioned in the article only measures taken by the German government to increase birthrates.  </p>

		<p>Out of curiousity, how many &#8220;Germans&#8221; are actually real Germans?  Over four million turks, four hundred thousand blacks&hellip; and that&rsquo;s just counting the ones with citizenship(in the case of blacks).  One third of all &#8220;german&#8221; children had one parent born abroad, and 16 milion people are of non-ethnic german descent according to wikipedia.  But we know how out of date it usually is.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more concerned about the 1 in 3 children figure myself.</p>

<p>Those stats were an over-all figure for the number of children born in Germany, but I would have to ask:  How many of them were GERMAN children born to GERMAN parents?  Aha! There is the catch!  As in France, most of the fertility is doubtless found among immigrant groups and not among indigenous &#8220;Germans&#8221;. Has Mr. Goldstein taken that essential factor into consideration?<br>

		<p> A check of the website www.mnsu/emuseum, which gives a day-to-day count of the populations of all the world&rsquo;s nations and of births and deaths to that date, shows that Germany, in roughly the past 11 months, has had 604,912 births, and currently as of today has a population of 82,128,614.</p>
<p> On the other hand, Argentina, which now has a higher percentage of residents of unmixed European descent than Germany (87 to 89 percent for Argentina, 81 percent for Germany) now has a population of 41,361,378, or only slightly more than half of Germany&rsquo;s, but as of today has had, in the past 11 months, 592,485 births   &mdash;   just 12,000 less than Germany, with about half the population. The Argentines are replacing themselves, and then some; the Germans are fading away. The talk about &#8220;women who want to juggle motherhood and jobs&#8221; having to cut down on births doesn&rsquo;t wash; how come the same thing doesn&rsquo;t apply in Argentina, which is basically a middle-class society too, although with a lower per-capita income than Germany&rsquo;s?</p>
<p> My guess is that there is another factor here that&rsquo;s not being mentioned: The Germans, with the enthusiastic cooperation of the world, have brain-washed themselves so thoroughly about the &#8220;evil Nazi era&#8221; that many Germans subconsciously feel that they don&rsquo;t deserve to have a future. Perhaps they feel that, &#8220;Germany must perish to atone for the &#8216;most evil man in history,&rsquo; Adolf Hitler.&#8221; </p>

		<p>If one reads between the lines, the purpose of this propaganda piece is to make the argument for increased levels of third-world immigration to Germany.  Open up your country to the African and/or Muslim hordes or your economy will suffer.

		<p>Wayne Eagle:  I believe it was under Carlos Menem that Argentina began letting in large numbers of Bolivian Indians.  Aregentina&rsquo;s white birthrate is probably not so great as you might think.  I work with Argetine expatriots who lament the &#8220;browning&#8221; of Argentina.</p>

		<p>something like 80 to 90 percent of births in dallas is to hispanics not whites. The problem in america is far far more grim only we dont keep accurate race statistics to realize it. So Germany gets de-congested and has better traffic and each family has a house to give to their one child. sounds like paradise. </p>

		<p>I am sure low birth rates are not the real problem of the west!<br>
We don&rsquo;t have to make a birth-racing with other countries. People will make children if the conditions are good.<br>
And with more immigration the conditions are getting bad for the origin people.Stop immigration and the problem will disappear after a few years.</p>

		<p>Germany lost virtually every single ethnocentric German male in WW2, only the cowards were left. How else do explain The willingness of the masses to let Turks in? German-led armies killed 80 000 000 of my fellow Slavs in the last 1000 years, whereas the Turks killed and enslaved half the number of Orthodox Christians in 500 years. Why are Turks not made to feel as justifiably ashamed of their Ottoman past as Germans are of the nazi past?</p>

<p>Managing population attrition is a challenge, but replacing Germans with 3rd worlders GUARANTEES the disappearance of German society.</p>

		<p>A significant population shrinkage in Germany would be just fine with me. This is one of the most densely populated places in the world anyways, approx. 80 million people crammed into a confined space that is barely larger than the state of New Mexico. But politicians never fail to remind us that our high living standards will go down the drain if we refuse to advocate the admission of &#8220;skilled Third World immigrants&#8221; (mostly Muslims)into our country. The higher fertility rate among those new &#8220;model citizens&#8221; is allegedly something the native population can only benefit from, because their offspring will one day subsidize the pensions and annuities of our senior citizens. This just hasn`t worked out in practice though, quite the contrary. The new-arrivals are so far only contributing to a steeply increasing welfare dependency rate (with politicians conjuring up the most blatantly illogical theories about the cause of this while skirting around the obvious) and boosting crime rates. For whatever unfathomable reason the vast bulk of the citizenry is apparently gullible enough to buy into those hypotheses, so the self-inflicted national and cultural destruction continues unchallenged.<br>
Germany is a lost cause and we probably derserve to perish as a nation. The older generation fell for Hitler and the swastika flag, the younger generation is completely enthralled by the hammer and sickle symbol of Cultural Marxism.<br>
In its recent history, this country has teeter-tottered between a megalomaniac world supremacy ideology and a defeatist collective suicide culture. The prospect that everything will turn back to normal is rather slim.<br>
I`m just wondering why the other Western nations are in exactly the same predicament. Germans got that &#8220;past&#8221; which serves as a good pretext for persistent self-hatred, but what have e.g. Scandinavians done to necessitate national self-flagellation as an atonement?</p>

		<p>To everybody who suggests that this would be a good thing for Germany so long as the Germans are not replaced by foreigners: I agree with this sentiment to an extent because of crowding, environmental matters, etc., but keep in mind that there is no sign that the population decline will not continue indefinitely. That is to say, if in x number of years the German population will decline by 20%, then in 2x it will decline another 20%, and so on. Eventually a group of people must raise its birthrates or that group will be extinguished as a people. </p>
<p>Why would you think that Germany would lose, let&rsquo;s say, 20 million people and then have a stable population? No, it will probably lose 20 million, then 15 million more, then 10 million more, etc. Will Germany really be better off when it&rsquo;s population is the size of Sweden&rsquo;s or less? What will be the impetus for this generation&rsquo;s small group of children to have more children than their parents did? </p>
<p>Think of all the brilliant Germans in the past, the Beethoven&rsquo;s, the Wagner&rsquo;s, the Heisenberg&rsquo;s, etc., and think of how many great people might have been born but never were nor will be. When one of the most advanced civilizations dies, then the whole world suffers and human progress slows. This is true of Germany; this is true of the West as a whole.</p>

		<p>Europe recovered from sudden population loss in the pandemics and plagues of the Middle Ages, and the horrific losses of life of the wars of the industrial age. In every case, the quality of life of survivors improved in the aftermath.</p>
<p>Money is the reason behind the alarmism with regards to a shrinking population.  If the population shrinks, so does the wealth of the elite monied classes (the people of leisure), who depend on growth to maintain their asset values.</p>
<p>These arlarmist stories are almost always followed by calls for more immigrants.</p>

<p>&#8220;I often find myself wondering just how different the world would have been if the US had stayed out of the war.&#8221;</p>
<p>No less than British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, when seeing what Stalin&rsquo;s armies were doing to Eastern Europe AFTER the end of the war, uttered these now largely forgotten (and embarrassing) words:  &#8220;We killed the wrong pig!&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amconmag.com/article/2003/feb/24/00007/" rel="nofollow">http://www.amconmag.com/article/2003/feb/24/00007/</a></p>
<p>Better than asking how different things would have been had the U.S. stayed out of WW2 (remember people: Germany, Italy and Japan declared war on us) would be to ask: &#8220;How different things would have been had the U.S. stayed out of World War ONE!&#8221;</p>
<p>1) The Allied powers eventually would have been forced to sue Germany for a negotiated peace.  No punitive Treaty of Versailles.</p>
<p>2) There would have been no totalitarian regimes anywhere, with the possible exception of Russia, which would have been isolated.  Had Stalin then invaded Finland in 1939, in all probability it would have been the Soviet Union being destroyed.</p>
<p>3) Hitler would never have come to power, so there never would have been an invasion of Poland, so there never would have been a World War Two.</p>
<p>4) Under those circumstances Japan would in all probability not been stupid enough to attack Pearl Harbor, since they would have had no major allies.  Any Japanese aggression in East Asia could have been more easily dealt with by China and the U.S., which may have prevented a Communist takeover of China.</p>
<p>5) Finally, because there would have been no Nazi regime, there would be no &#8220;collective White guilt&#8221; over Nazi atrocities which means in all probability the twin palls of multiculturalism and &#8220;civil rights legislation&#8221; would be non-existent today, or at least drastically lessened.</p>

		<p>&#8220;keep in mind that there is no sign that the population decline will not continue indefinitely. That is to say, if in x number of years the German population will decline by 20%, then in 2x it will decline another 20%, and so on&#8221;.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good point. A good way to check would be to remove all non-whites from Germany, then see if population growth can return to stability. When diagnosing a problem you have to look at what changed caused the problem to begin. It&rsquo;s just a theory, but would be one way to check.  </p>

		<p>Some commenters pointed out that the plummeting birth rate of whites is due to an increasing number of non-white immigrant population in Europe among other things. This conclusion is plausible, but it can&rsquo;t be supported by data, since the birth rates in ethnically more homogeneous Eastern European countries aren&rsquo;t much different from Germany&rsquo;s. An even more contrasting (non-white) example is Japan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that for most whites and East Asians (especially those with an academic background), the opportunity costs of having kids or a family are too high in an age where career and self-realization are the paramount of the society. I&rsquo;m talking about the opportunity costs inflicted on the individuals, not the society as a whole (for which the opportunity cost of NOT having kids is higher).<br>

<p>Not to disagree with Eric&rsquo;s comment, but I personally think the root of it goes even further back   &mdash;  -   to 1914.  That&rsquo;s when Europe went mad and all hell broke loose, nothing ever having been the same again. WW2 was just a continuation of the downhill trend, a dramatic escalation of the decay  and illness that had already begun in 1914.</p>
<p>Also, several posters above have referred to Germany as over-crowded and in need of thinning.  That really is not the case!   </p>
<p>There is plenty of  open space in the German countryside, and even plenty of forest land.   The Germans are also given to outdoor sports: hiking, skiing and such.  They enjoy the out-of-doors.  And one gets  no sense of crowding in German towns and cities  (unlike Latin cities, which tend to be congested).   The Germans like having plenty of space around them!   Therefore, rooms are large, high-ceilinged, and spacious; houses and buildings are large and  often have plenty of  green, leafy space between them with abundant light and air   &mdash;   especially all the modern developments  (which means most, since so much of Germany had been destroyed).   German cities are full of parks and open spaces. In parts of Berlin, which have lakes, beaches and forests, you would think you were in the country.  Berlin has the most park area of any city in Europe (if not the world).  So, one does not get the feeling of crowding in Germany, even the biggest of cities.  Nor is there any lack of resources. Food is cheaper than in France   &mdash;   which has more space and less population. Meal portions are abundant and generous. And Germany exports food.  In fact, the Netherlands is  a much more densely populated country, and even the  Dutch do not suffer from congestion due to wise planning and development.   I do not agree that Germany needs to lose population!<br>

		<p>&#8220;Europe recovered from sudden population loss in the pandemics and plagues of the Middle Ages, and the horrific losses of life of the wars of the industrial age. In every case, the quality of life of survivors improved in the aftermath.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anon. #26: You are forgetting something here. The drastic population decreases in the past were involuntary. The current population problems in Europe are almost entirely voluntary. That is a different issue. If the birth rate is an average of 5 children per woman then of course the population will rebound after a catastrophe, plague, or war. When the rate is 1.3 children per woman and the cause of this rate is due to people&rsquo;s personal preferences, then why should we believe that the population will ever recover? I mean, it certainly might, if circumstances and values significantly change, but it is very likely that the trend will continue and perhaps even get worse.</p>
<p>Needless to say, bringing in millions of welfare cases who hate you is not the solution. But, having almost no children isn&rsquo;t going to work either if a group of people is going to survive. You&rsquo;re actually telling us that a Germany with tens of millions of fewer people and the majority of its remaining people elderly with very few young German workers is somehow going to be a better, &#8220;improved&#8221; place? I can&rsquo;t see how that could possibly be the case.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t buy this. Germany is one of the absolutely richest nations on earth. If Germans can&rsquo;t afford children then nobody on earth can afford them. Look around the world, higher poverty = higher birth rates. It makes no sense, but that&rsquo;s the way it is.</p>
<p>People&rsquo;s culture and religious values often play a bigger role in family size than economics (although, of course, some people with a car, a house, a computer, a cell phone, a widescreen HD TV, cable or a satellite dish, a Blu Ray player, an mp3 player, numerous household appliances, jewelry, and a large wardrobe claim they can&rsquo;t afford to have a child&hellip;). </p>
<p>#29 Anon.: &#8220;A good way to check would be to remove all non-whites from Germany, then see if population growth can return to stability. When diagnosing a problem you have to look at what changed caused the problem to begin.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think this would help. If there is more space for larger houses and apartments, less threat of crime, better schools, more jobs available, etc., then some people will indeed have more children. But this can&rsquo;t be the whole solution either. </p>
<p>After all, let&rsquo;s look at the situation in the U.S. The birthrate among whites is lower in New England than it is among whites in the South. Now, the South is more &#8220;diverse&#8221; and it is poorer than New England, so white homogeneity and economic prosperity can&rsquo;t be the answer or these regional birthrates would be reversed. The South is, however, more 1) traditionally conservative, 2) religious, and 3) family oriented (think of all those Southerners absolutely fanatical about genealogical research or all of those large &#8220;family get-togethers&#8221; that are so common in the South). These things are more important to the birth rate in long run. </p>
<p>I have no doubt, though, if southern cities were much safer and less crowded (i.e., less diverse) and most southern public schools weren&rsquo;t little hellholes, then these folks would have even more children, probably even over the replacement rate. Utah I think bears this out. Utah has many of the traits of the South: conservative, religious, and family oriented (the biggest genealogical collection in the U.S. is in Salt Lake City). But, unlike the South, it is not very diverse. Utah is the only state in the U.S. where the white birthrate is above replacement rate.</p>

<p>Not necessarily!  And, another major factor:  the Middle Ages were another time when people couldn&rsquo;t just get on a plane or train, or hop in a car, and be in another country tomorrow.</p>
<p>All that has changed.</p>
<p>The fact is that as the population of a wealthy country declines and leaves vacant spaces to be filled, that will create a demographic vacuum which will draw in other populations to fill them, WHETHER THEY ARE INVITED OR NOT. You don&rsquo;t even have to bring them as &#8220;guest workers&#8221;&hellip; they will find ways to come in on their own, without any invitation from you. It may be a hostile military invasion, or a gradual, peaceful  one   &mdash;    but they will come!</p>
