			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jerome Taylor, London Independent, May 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When I look back on it now what surprises me is how disarmingly polite my attackers were.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; asked one of the two, seemingly inquisitive, Asian teenagers who approached me on a quiet cul-de-sac in Bow, east London, shortly after 1pm yesterday.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s been a photographer around here, do you know her?&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t, but I explained I was a journalist for The Independent looking to speak to a man at an address in the area, who was standing as a candidate in the local elections, about allegations of postal vote fraud. &#8220;Can we see your note pad,&#8221; the boy asked.</p>
<p>I declined and then the first punch came  &mdash;  landing straight on my nose, sending blood and tears streaming down my face. Then another. Then another.</p>
<p>I tried to protect myself but a fresh crop of attackers  &mdash;  I guess between four and six  &mdash;  joined in. As they knocked me to the ground one of them brought a traffic cone repeatedly down on the back of my head.</p>
<p>As their fists and feet slammed into me, all I could think about was some advice a friend had given me. She&rsquo;s a paramedic and has dealt with countless victims of assault. &#8220;Whatever you do don&rsquo;t get knocked to the ground,&#8221; she once said. &#8220;Blows on the floor are much more dangerous.&#8221; It seemed faintly absurd now. &#8220;That&rsquo;s easy for you to say,&#8221; I thought. &#8220;How on earth are you meant to stay up?&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long it lasted  &mdash;  it was probably only a minute  &mdash;  but it was a long minute. I don&rsquo;t remember them saying anything as they did it. The first noise I was aware of was the beeping of a car horn and a woman screaming.</p>
<p>The noise brought a man out of a nearby block of flats. With little regard for his own safety he waded in and defended me until my attackers ran away.</p>
<p>I shudder to think what would have happened if he hadn&rsquo;t been brave enough to take action and I cannot thank him enough for what he did. He gave me a bottle of water to wash the blood away and showed me a mobile phone that one of the attackers had dropped which he later handed to the police. He also maintained that he saw at least two of the attackers run into the candidate&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>What brought me to Bow yesterday were allegations of widespread postal voting fraud. Both the local Conservative and Respect parties in Tower Hamlets have been looking through the new electoral rolls for properties that have an alarmingly high number of adults registered to one address. The area has a large Bengali population and this type of fraud is unfortunately all too common. In some instances there have been as many as 20 Bengali names supposedly living in two or three-bedroom flats. When journalists have previously called, all too often there are far fewer living there. In some instances, no Bengalis at all.</p>
<p>In such a heavily populated borough, a few fraudulent postal votes might not sound like it matters but when you look at how slim the majorities are here you know every vote counts. In Bethnal Green and Bow, Respect has a tiny 1,300-vote lead. In neighbouring Poplar and Limehouse, where George Galloway is taking on Labour&rsquo;s Jim Fitzpatrick and Tory newcomer Tim Archer, the lead is around 4,000. But boundary changes have brought thousands of affluent Tory-leaning voters into the constituency, making it an equally tight race.</p>
<p>So far Scotland Yard is looking into 28 allegations of bogus voter registration in London, although the Conservative and Respect parties both say they have highlighted many more. Concerns have been amplified by a flood of new voter registrations in the past few weeks in the run-up to the nationwide deadline on 20 April. Election officials in Tower Hamlets have removed 141 suspect ballots from the register but overall 5,166 new names were received before the deadline with little time to check their veracity.</p>
<p>Bengalis do tend to have large families and this is the third most deprived borough in the country. Overcrowding is a serious issue. But other Bengalis I know in the area had told me that it was very unusual to have any more than five adults in one house. The households are large, they said, because they have lots of children  &mdash;  not lots of adults.</p>
<p>Thinking back on my experience perhaps I was naïve to venture into the area on my own, although I do live in east London, know the estates well and have rarely felt threatened. My Bengali neighbours, meanwhile, are particularly kind and well-liked because they tend to keep a tighter leash on their kids.</p>
<p>The paramedics who treated me told me that they rarely went into the area without a police escort. &#8220;These kids are trapped in an endless cycle of poverty,&#8221; one of them said. &#8220;There&rsquo;s a lot of drugs and gang-related violence but it is rare for a stranger like you to be attacked.&#8221;</p>
<p>The slight difference, of course, is that I&rsquo;m not a stranger in the normal sense. Whoever these kids were it was evident that they were no strangers to the occasional journalist and photographer sniffing around.</p>
<p>Last night, I managed to speak to the man I wanted to interview about the alleged fraud, and whose house I was outside when I was attacked. He said: &#8220;I am not going to talk to you about this. Why have you been knocking on my door. You don&rsquo;t disturb me. If you knock on my door again I will take you to court.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Police probe voter fraud</b>s</p>
<p>*Police forces across the country are investigating over 50 complaints of voting abuses, including 10 complaints passed to the police in Tower Hamlets where The Independent journalist Jerome Taylor was attacked.</p>
<p>Tower Hamlets Council confirmed it had asked the police to investigate 10 cases of voter fraud in its area, but it revealed that 3,123 late applications have been received for postal votes and it has had too little time to properly check whether they are all genuine before the register closed.</p>
<p>That could open the poll in the two constituencies in Tower Hamlets  &mdash;  Bethnal Green and Bow and Poplar and Limehouse  &mdash;  to massive postal voter fraud. Respect is in a bitter fight to retain the highly marginal Bethnal Green seat  &mdash;  vacated by Respect MP George Galloway, who is standing in neighbouring Poplar and Limehouse  &mdash;  and, in an unprecedented development in British politics, all the candidates of the main parties are Bangladeshi Muslims.</p>
<p>The council said it would support calls to change the rules after Thursday&rsquo;s elections, to provide more time for checks to be carried out on late postal vote applications. &#8220;That could mean closing applications for postal votes at least four days before the normal voter registration process closes.&#8221;</p>

								<h2><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/election/article-1271522/General-Election-2010-Postal-voting-farce-shames-democracy.html">Postal Passport to Ballot Frauds: A Farce That Shames Our Democracy</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Leo McKinstry, Daily Mail (London), May 4, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>The integrity of our voting system used to be taken for granted. Whatever their allegiance, voters could have absolute faith in the outcome of a General Election.</p>
<p>But, like so many other British traditions, the credibility of our democracy has been badly weakened during the last 13 years of Labour rule.</p>
<p>Thanks to the introduction of mass postal voting on demand, the stench of malpractice now hangs over the process, whether it be through serial abuses on the electoral roll or widespread fraud in the casting of postal votes.</p>
<p>With the result of the General Election so uncertain and the gap between the three main parties so narrow, the potential for corruption is deeply worrying.</p>
<p>This Thursday postal voting will play a far bigger role than in any previous contest, with more than seven million people having registered for a postal ballot.</p>
<p>In the last month alone, there were 150,000 applications and, in some areas, the number of registrations for postal votes has increased by 200 per cent compared with the 2005 election.</p>
<p>Yet, unlike voting at a polling station, the postal process is easily open to manipulation by political parties and criminals because no proper checks are made on the electors&rsquo; identities.</p>
<p>The same problem applies to the electoral roll, where names are added or removed without effective investigation, a flaw compounded by the phenomenal demographic upheaval caused by mass immigration.</p>
<p>With an annual inflow running at over 500,000 and emigration by Britons reaching almost 400,000 a year, electoral registers have increasingly turned into little more than works of fiction.</p>
<p>The Government and its agencies have been celebrating the recent surge in registrations and postal vote applications as evidence of a new enthusiasm for politics amongst the electorate, due partly to the TV debates.</p>
<p>The reality is that it has undermined the whole democratic process.</p>
<p>A study by the Council of Europe in 2008 stated that &#8216;the voting system in Great Britain is open to electoral fraud&rsquo;, since it was &#8216;childishly simple&rsquo; to register bogus voters, while &#8216;postal voting provides the anonymity to carry out fraud without detection&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Particularly disturbing is the position in the crucial marginal seats that will decide the outcome of election.</p>
<p>Here, in a desperate drive to boost support, all the major parties have been making intensive efforts to increase registration and postal voting.</p>
<p>In Edinburgh South, a vital three-way marginal, postal votes are up by 60 per cent, while in the London borough of Islington, scene of a bitter fight between Labour and the Liberal Democrats, the numbers on the electoral roll have increased by nearly 20,000 to 135,800 since 2005.</p>
<p>Five police investigations are under way in the Yorkshire conurbations of Bradford and Calderdale, where two arrests have been made.</p>
<p>In London, police are examining 28 allegations of major abuses across 12 boroughs. In one typical case, a resident of Bethnal Green was surprised to learn that eight complete strangers were also registered at the small flat she shares with her partner.</p>
<p>Responding to mounting concern about corruption, John Turner, chief executive of the Association of Electoral Administrators, admitted &#8216;fraudulent activity&rsquo; was easy to perpetrate.</p>
<p>&#8216;It&rsquo;s not a properly verified system and it should be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This growing threat to democracy has happened entirely because of decisions taken by Labour.</p>
<p>Despite strong opposition, it pressed ahead in 2004 with the introduction of postal voting on demand without any safeguards or tightening of the register.</p>
<p>Before then, voters had to provide a valid reason why they needed to vote by post, such as work commitments, disability or holiday.</p>
<p>The theoretical justification was to boost turnout at a time of growing public apathy. But in reality, Labour saw that an insecure-system could work to the party&rsquo;s advantage in urban areas where the population is more fluid.</p>
<p>This is particularly true among inner-city wards dominated by Asian clan leaders who effectively control the local franchise and even set up &#8216;voting factories&rsquo; to process ballot papers.</p>
<p>Almost all the worst instances of fraud since 2000 have arisen in places with large concentrations of Asian voters, such as Blackburn, Oldham and Tower Hamlets.</p>
<p>In the Birmingham local elections of 2004, six Muslim men stole thousands of ballot papers and marked them for Labour candidates. The Election Commissioner, Richard Mawrey QC, said at their trial that the contest &#8216;would have disgraced a banana republic&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Yet the problem remains as bad as ever. A BBC report last week found that Asian activists are targeting British Pakistanis who have relocated in their thousands to the Pakistan district of Maipur.</p>
<p>The activists are going door to door asking any who are still eligible for a British vote to sign over their entitlement to a proxy or postal vote.</p>
<p>As a result, it is claimed that many have signed forms for this week&rsquo;s elections, without knowing who they are voting for.</p>
<p>This is a farce that shames democracy. But Labour, desperate to cling on to power, does not care about rebuilding trust. Partisan gain is all that matters.</p>
<p>Labour&rsquo;s willingness to exploit a dodgy system was graphically illustrated in its two unexpected recent by-election triumphs in Scotland.</p>
<p>At Glenrothes in 2008, the neighbouring seat to Gordon Brown&rsquo;s at Kirkcaldy, there was a fourfold increase in postal ballots and Labour&rsquo;s opponents demanded to see the marked official register which showed whether individuals had voted or not.</p>
<p>Unbelievably, the Sheriff &#8216;s Clerk&rsquo;s Office in Kirkcaldy had to explain, after five months, that the register had &#8216;gone missing&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And Labour&rsquo;s win in Glasgow North East last November followed a dramatic increase in postal votes, with almost 2,000 applications submitted less than three days before the registration deadline.</p>
<p>The Electoral Commission complained that Labour &#8216;did not comply&rsquo; with the code of conduct on the submission of postal-vote applications.</p>
<p>Labour would no doubt just dismiss this as scaremongering. But the truth is that the Government&rsquo;s own cynicism towards the voting process could make this the most tainted, distorted result in General Election history.</p>
<p>One disquieting straw in the wind could be seen last Friday, when Kerry McCarthy, Labour candidate for Bristol East, revealed an early sample of postal votes on her Twitter page.</p>
<p>She has been accused of breaching electoral law, since candidates are not meant to release such information.</p>
<p>But even more alarming is the apparent extent of her lead, despite Labour&rsquo;s fall to third place in most opinion polls. If Labour is still in power on Friday, the entire voting system will be in the dock.<br>

		<p>AmRen: just a quick message to point out that you guys should refrain from referring to Pakistanis as &#8216;Pakis&rsquo;. Although I imagine you guys simply mistook it as an acceptable shortened way of saying Pakistani, over here in Britain &#8216;Paki&rsquo; is a crude racial slur. I&rsquo;m at pains to point this out because whilst you may be innocent of intending any slurs against said people, it&rsquo;s the kind of mistake that the Far-Left in Britain might pick up on to falsely portray AmRen as a mean-spirited and crude organisation. It&rsquo;s worth bearing in mind given that (I imagine) AmRen has its biggest readership outside the US in Britain. (Or is it Canada?)</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, such is the stranglehold and the damnation of the mass media, voters all too often don&rsquo;t turn to the BNP until they believe it is a matter of life or death, or even till it&rsquo;s past that point. Fortunately for the BNP, it looks like it&rsquo;s going to come to that for all of us.  </p>

		<p>Well, at least they were &#8220;polite&#8221; and they tend to &#8220;keep a tighter leash on their kids&#8221; and they beat him only because they are &#8220;trapped in an endless cycle of poverty&#8221;.

		<p>We were &#8220;trapped in an endless cycle of poverty&#8221;, too, but why should that lead to mindless, ferocious violence?  We wouldn&rsquo;t have dreamt of it.  BTW, we got out of poverty by moving to a better area, living in cheap rooming houses, and working hard. No free handouts in those days.<br>
They have simply got to get rid of the free handouts in UK. </p>

		<p>We&rsquo;ll continue to use &#8216;Paki&rsquo; as it is not a slur here in the States.  It is an abbreviation of Pakistan and as such refers to a specific geographical location and peoples of that location and from that location/ethinicity/culture.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand how it can be a &#8216;slur&rsquo;.  The Powers That Be want to control your language to the point that you have no words to use to express your ideas or complaints.  Thanks for the &#8216;tip&rsquo;, V, but we can take care of ourselves.</p>
<p>This is not directed to you, V.</p>
<p>We got rid of British Law some time ago.  Some weasels here keep trying to bring it back.  We are not under British Law, we don&rsquo;t answer to British Courts and we don&rsquo;t curtsy to the Queen.  If some Left Wingers in the UK want a &#8216;do over&rsquo; of the American Revolution, go ahead and send them over.</p>
<p>To paraphrase a USMC poster, &#8220;Not only are we (Americans) good looking, we can kick your ass, too&#8221;.</p>
<p>If I find the link to the poster, I will post same below.</p>

I live in Australia and I didn&rsquo;t know that &#8216;paki&rsquo; was a slur (elsewhere) until a few years ago. We used to call the Pakistani cricket team &#8216;pakis&rsquo; and the media referred to them as &#8216;pakis&rsquo; as well - on the telly. When I was a young cricket fan, we called them &#8216;the Pakis&rsquo; and they were not bothered at all; they were pretty easy-going chaps (when we met them) that had a great laugh about it. <br>
Afterall, it&rsquo;s just an abbreviation of Pakistan, as &#8216;Brit&rsquo; is an abbreviation of Britain. </p>

		<p>ALL of these mass postal voting frauds are perpetrated by Pakistanis - and ALL of the fruit of the frauds goes to the Labour Party.<br>
 Pakistan is the most corrupt nation on Earth.In Pakistan voting fraud is considered to be a mere trifling occurrence compared to the systematic, massive pervasive corruption that seeps into every tiny detail of Pakistani life.<br>
 It is just a taste of things to come in Britain.</p>

		<p>V, the &#8216;Pakistanis&rsquo; attack someone violently and unprovoked and you&rsquo;re telling US to tone down our language? A &#8216;Pakistani&rsquo; was recently arrested for trying to kill Americans (can I use that one?) in Times Square and WE have to not give offense? A &#8216;Pakistani&rsquo; architect once threatened to beat up my father at a job site (which I prevented, the coward, going after an old man) and I&rsquo;M supposed to be polite? </p>
<p>No. The far-left demonizes us no matter what we do. And I understand that in Britain, with its punishable speech codes, you have to be more careful. But we have been pushed too far and no one is in a mood to tip-toe anymore. The only reason I used the &#8216;proper&rsquo; term for them here is out of respect for AmRen itself, who will be far wiser than I in their editorial choices.</p>
<p>But consider this: Before the Times Square bomber was arrested it was all over the news that it was a &#8220;white man&#8221;. Egregiously, the mayor of New York said it openly. When it was revealed he was a &#8216;Pakistani&rsquo; his first reaction was to scold us not to engage in anti-muslim bigotry. No offense but it sounds much like your comment, even though I believe you mean well and the mayor doesn&rsquo;t. </p>
<p>Keeping quiet for too long is what got us in this mess in the first place. No more.</p>

		<p>Actually, there is some cognitive dissonance here.</p>
<p>Bengalis from Bangladesh, not Pakistanis, are the tribe in question in East London.</p>
<p>George Galloway, the newly-defeated Respect M.P., blames the local Labour Party for letting this happen or, as he says himself, tacitly countenancing and encouraging it.</p>
<p>This business about misuse of the postal vote has been going on for at least five years.</p>
<p>It may or may not be resolved satisfactorily if the Tories are determined to address a glaring scandal.</p>

		<p>Respect, the political party of which George Galloway was the sole M.P., may not be AmRen readers&rsquo; cup of tea &hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip; however, it seems possible that the remnants of Respect will initiate legal proceedings against Labour.</p>
<p>If so, all sorts of dirty secrets will float to the surface.</p>
<p>Wait and see.</p>

		<p>Yup it&rsquo;s that bad. I once saw a post from a Japanese fellow saying how hurt he is everytime he saw the word &#8216;Jap&rsquo; &hellip; . It&rsquo;s a bloody shortened form of the word, and I think some people need to get a thicker skin instead of crying at everything that may be taken wrong.</p>

		<p>By a miracle, the US Supreme Court upheld the Indiana Voter ID law. But to listen to those who opposed it (like the Indiana chapter of the ACLU), you have thought that we were going to return to the days of Jim Crow. If you need some sort of ID to get a drivers license, cash a check, or do 100 other things, what is wrong with an ID to vote. I haven&rsquo;t seen this in central Indiana, but I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if this were to occur in Lake County (Gary, and a number of cities that contain people who escaped from Gary). In St. Louis, every couple of years, a judge will order that polling places remain open past the state mandated closing time. Lo and behold, a massive number of &#8220;voters&#8221; will be bussed in at the last minute. </p>
<p>Granted, I am not familiar with the requirements to vote in Great Britain, but this would seem like an easy thing to fix. However,  it requires political will and that runs smack into the face of political correctness. If the good liberal journalist thinks that a group of people from an utterly dysfunctional and corrupt society are going to have their act together, he needed the beat down. </p>
