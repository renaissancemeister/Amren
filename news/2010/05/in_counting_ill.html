<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>How many people in the U.S. can be considered illegal immigrants?</p>
<p>A range of estimates, including one by the U.S. government, put the number at between 10.8 million and 11.9 million. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Of the many studies that have attempted to calculate the size of the illegal-immigrant population, the most widely cited are from three sources: the Department of Homeland Security; the Center for Immigration Studies {snip}; and the nonpartisan Pew Hispanic Center. The government and CIS both put the number at 10.8 million in 2009, while Pew counted 11.9 million in 2008.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Researchers at CIS and Pew and in the federal government use a decades-old technique that looks at the number of foreign-born people in the U.S., as counted by annual census surveys. Then they subtract the number of foreign-born people in the U.S. legally, based on immigration records and projections of deaths and outmigration. The remainder is believed to be the number of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>These studies presume that about 10% of illegal immigrants aren&rsquo;t counted by census takers. But that figure largely is based on a 2001 University of California-funded survey of 829 people born in Mexico and living in Los Angeles, in which individuals were asked, among other things, whether they responded to census interviewers a year earlier. Representatives of nearly two in five households refused to answer that survey, and those who didn&rsquo;t might have been more likely to skip the census count as well.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} In 2005, Robert Justich, then a portfolio manager for Bear Stearns, co-wrote a report putting the population at as high as 20 million, citing increases in remittances to Mexico and in housing permits in communities with enclaves of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip} &#8220;The assumption that illegal people will fill out a census form is the most ridiculous concept I have ever heard of,&#8221; says Mr. Justich, who now owns a music and film production firm in Hoboken, N.J.</p>
<p>Other researchers criticize the Bear Stearns analysis for failing to note that the surge in remittances might simply reflect better record-keeping. Nor would a rise in remittances necessarily mean a surge in illegal immigration. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Though the Census Bureau&rsquo;s studies are the basis for most of these counts, the agency itself doesn&rsquo;t seek to identify individuals&rsquo; immigration status. Robert M. Groves, director of the Census Bureau, cites two major reasons. First, asking people about their citizenship might drive down the overall response rates to the census.</p>
<p>Second, the Census Bureau doesn&rsquo;t have the funds to conduct a massive effort to count illegal immigrants.</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;ve been using the tired old 12 million for 20 years. Now it&rsquo;s down to 11 million. Yeah, right. I&rsquo;d say there were 12 million, in California alone. Of course nobody knows but my guess would be at least 25 million if not more.</p>

		<p>I think there are many more everyone thinks there are, but we won&rsquo;t know until King Odooba rams amnesty through sideways.</p>
<p>I travel all around the United States for work.  I have stopped being surprised by where I find them;  Any street off the strip in Las Vegas, NV, outside Lynchburg, TN, in St. Louis, MO.  These have all turned in the past decade and they turned fast.  Other evidence includes all those states posted on Amren in the past where they dominate the 10 Most Wanted.</p>
<p>I think this hasn&rsquo;t been confronted because many people wrongly think this is a regional and manageable situation that can be reversed before it becomes a problem.  Of course, it is already a problem.  I can only hope the bell rings soon and we kick them out.  Otherwise, in 40 years they&rsquo;ll be kicking us out.</p>

		<p>And uf we are ready to  believe the ILLEGAL ALIEN count is only 10.8-11.9 million then we are ready to believe the black population of the U.S. is 10-12% instead of the real 40+%. From riding around the country on a motorcycle, I absolutly believe the ILLEGAL ALIEN population is 40 million and the blacks at 40+%, ESPECIALLY and even higher in the major cities!</p>

		<p> The shadow society has a graph? Who knew? A reputable group I would say. You can bet this graph is certainly a flawed document, since there is no way anyone can possibly know how many illegals there are in any of these states, but you can bet the ranch there are many times more than anyone says. A more interesting stat would be the number of legal mestizos there are here. I&rsquo;m wagering there could easily be thirty million illegals and at least that many legals. Plus what are the chances the pew hispanic center could be nonpartisan? Not a chance in hell.</p>

		<p>I know that here, the census takers pretty much have to be young Hispanic guys, so that they can trudge thru the neighborhoods, speak the language, and pretty much PRY the individuals out of their homes.  They can&rsquo;t get into all of them so there is a very real disparity between how many people there actually are and how many they are able to count.</p>

		<p>There are at least 30 million illegal foreign-born hispanics in the US today, I&rsquo;d say 80% of them males 40 yrs old or younger. </p>
<p>Here in New Orleans, it was acutely manifest right after Hurricane Katrina: a simple, common-sense count revealed that one in six or seven &#8220;residents&#8221; was an illegal male, foreign-born Hispanic,  95% Mexican. </p>
<p>At the time (winter 05), the population of New Orleans had been reduced from a little under half a million to about 350,000 - of this number (350k), an obvious one in five to seven, i.e. 50 to 70,000, were illegal Mexicans. </p>
<p>If you had come here to New Orleans after the storm, you would have seen that about 80% of ALL roofs had serious wind damage, and because of massive Federal cashola,  every single damaged roof in New Orleans after the storm was attended to, regardless of the homeowner&rsquo;s ability to pay. First, the Feds put up the &#8220;blue roofs&#8221; : these were temporary tarps put up over damaged roofs by crews that were invariably run by a single white male from somewhere up north, with a crew of six to eight illegal mexicans doing the dirty work up top. </p>
<p>The federal government ordered crews to repair any damaged roofs the crews saw, whether or not the owners were at home. </p>
<p>Later, after the Federal money really started to flow in, these same &#8220;blue roofs&#8221; were replaced by properly installed full-on roof repairs. In the 6-12 months after Katrina, the sound of pneumatic nail guns popping nails into shingles on roofs here was a ubiquitous sound. </p>
<p>Any time you heard a nail gun popping in shingles, if you looked up, you would see a crew of illegal Mexicans - a crew of six to eight - up there on the rooftops nailing down the new shingles. </p>
<p>I have seen hundreds - if not thousands - of roof crews in post Katrina New Orleans, and 99.5% of the time, these crews have been 100% foreign-born illegal mexican aliens. </p>
<p>From these observations, one must deduce that the current illegal hispanic population in the US is not &#8220;11 million&#8221; (this is what they were saying five years ago!), it is closer to 30 million, possibly a bit more. </p>
<p>Look around carefully, and make your own estimates. </p>
<p>We need to repeal the 14th amendment now.  </p>

		<p>I believe I know exactly how many illegals are here,far too many is the answer. However, as long as the &#8220;Controllers&#8221; feel they can reap the benefits out of this situation it will be &#8220;business as usual&#8221;.The big losers in this &#8220;game&#8221; are the working people better known as &#8220;wage slaves&#8221;. These folks cannot compete against the hordes of invaders that will work for far less than the average man / woman can work and still survive.</p>

What is the argument here? every single alien &#8220;BROKE THE LAW!&#8221; Our Government, past &amp; present, Republican &amp; Democrat, have allowed the invasion of 20 to 30 million criminals and is the largest invasion of any Nation, at any time, by any means &amp; in direct violation of Article IV, Section IV of our Constitution.</p>
<p>This refusal to abide by our Constitution should be classified as Treason of the most foul kind, as grounds for impeachment &amp; trials for Treason!</p>
<p>Not only have they allowed the invasion, they force American tax payers to pay Billions of dollars to provide Welfare, Prison, Educate the invaders children,free medical care, at the same time the invading horde break numerous laws, massive document fraud, &amp; are destroying our schools, hospitals, communities, culture and standard of living while Robbing, Raping, Killing &amp; Assaulting American Citizens WAKE UP PEOPLE! They walked,rode,swam and drove over here, they can do the same going home! taking thier anchor babies with them!</p>

		<p>If you want to know how many illegals there are in the US, simply check the welfare rolls.  The amount of welfare being spent minus the black population will give you a good idea about how many mexicans are in that state.  Divide by half and you have the number of illegals.</p>
<p>The solution to both the legal and illegal immigrant problem is to disband welfare.  All of those people will vanish from the US if they can no longer divert welfare money into the drug trade.  The drug tade is the one and only reason immigrants come to the US to begin with.  They are here to steal welfare but more to the point to divert large amounts of welfare into the drug trade.  Disbanding welfare would literally dismantle their entire motivation for being in the United States.  These people despise us and don&rsquo;t want to be here.  It&rsquo;s the lure of the drug trade that brings them here.  This is obvious to anyone who cares to investigate the incredible drug violence in mexico (and now the US).  The pattern of it is along our border.  Why is that?  If the drug issue was unrelated, the problem would endemic to all of mexico.  Instead, it focuses on our border.  The reason is the drug trade is about shipping drugs to the US and selling them in this country.  Where is the money coming from to buy those drugs?  Almost all of it is diverted from welfare.  Any legitimate &#8220;war on drugs&#8221; would choke off the major source of funding for the drug trade.  One of the primary reasons there is no legitimate war on drugs is that the issue is primarily about race.  It&rsquo;s about non-whites buying drugs with welfare money.</p>
<p>Before welfare was widespread, there was little in the way of non-white immigration and almost no drug problem.  These problems wax and wane with an areas willingness to tolerate socialism.  In an important practical way, the race issue IS about socialism.  The solution is to divest ourselves of socialism.  Socialism is what allows non-whites to colonize white areas and enables their pathologies.  Both these things become very difficult without socialism.</p>

<p>This is correct. The numbers prior to the amnesty in 1986 were said to be about 1 million illegals. But then after the amnesty was announced, about 3 million illegals applied.</p>

Take the official before the last amnesty and multiply by what was found out to be the truth. But multipy by 3 because immigration has been manytimes stronger this time around.</p>

		<p>The reason the liberals are so butt-sprung about the Arizona law is that their American liberal educations neglected to teach them (among other things) reading comprehension. What is is about probable cause that they do not understand? A law-enforcement officer has to have a reason for stopping a carload of Mexicans before he can inquire about their immigration status. Most likely they will be committing several violations providing that probable cause before even attracting notice  &mdash;  law enforcement being what it is.</p>
