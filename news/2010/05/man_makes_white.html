</em><br>
I am not sure if the &#8220;White Privilege Boot Camp&#8221; is real or not, but I am also not sure if I mind the idea. This is not to say that it should be as harsh as the boot camp the brother puts the white woman through in the below video, but the truth is that many of us in America are ignorant about racial history, primarily because our country wants to forget it. We don&rsquo;t mention many of the horrors and evils of slavery, because we would rather presume that a holocaust can only occur in another country.</p>
<p>I watched the video below with as much shock as the woman who was being lectured by the brother with the microphone. The brother is loud, and he dominates the woman, leading most of us to feel some degree of empathy toward her. She even cries toward the end, so the tendency is to argue that perhaps he was too harsh. Yes, he was too harsh, and I would not have approached the issue in the same way. But &hellip; &hellip;  ..</p>
<p>When it comes to how we process our racial history in America, there is the question of truth vs. lies. Was the woman crying because she was confronted with the truth about white privilege? Are most white Americans even aware of the benefits of being white? If that is or is not the case, then who should be held accountable for the clear and lasting damage of slavery? While some expect us to presume that history remains disconnected from the present, the truth is that they are inextricably linked. You can&rsquo;t have the present without the past, since actions of the past create the world that lies all around us.</p>

<p>Anyone who thinks there isn&rsquo;t going to be an incredibly violent clash between blacks and other races in this country when the economy finally tanks and these government pets aren&rsquo;t getting their freebies anymore, is either stupid or thinks that you&rsquo;re stupid.</p>

		<p>Heck, I&rsquo;m happy to, but for very different reasons.  Blacks just keep coming up with more and more ways to show their true nature!  Right on, brother!  Intimidate that woman!  What a man you are!  What a way to show how employable, civilized, and humane you are!</p>
<p>I love the &#8220;holocaust&#8221; bit.  Yeah, funny, millions of Jews were murdered less than a century ago, yet they&rsquo;ve managed to still do OK.  But hey, slavery stooped 150 years ago for blacks in this country, and they&rsquo;re still literally screaming at modern day whites.</p>
<p>There is a reason they are the most disliked of all the races.  I sometimes think the one thing every other group could agree on is dislike of blacks.</p>

		<p>Ummm&hellip;I wouldn&rsquo;t do it this way, but it would be a good idea to send a lot of white women through a sort of &#8220;boot camp&#8221; on racial reality.  Of course, roughly 35,000 white women a year already go through another kind of &#8220;boot camp,&#8221; when it comes to learning about black males, don&rsquo;t they?</p>

		<p>The clip and comments are very enlightening. I personally view such uncontrolled behavior as a good thing for White Nationalists. I&rsquo;m sure that many of the posters here could easily &#8216;disinfect&rsquo; any guilt that the White woman feels. I found some of the White posters stirring up the blacks on the comments section pretty funny. The blacks will spew out an flood of easily demolished cliches&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Any White person reading the comments will see the deep hatred and envy blacks have for Whites. It&rsquo;s long since time to seperate!</p>

		<p>Lets be clear: even if Africans &amp; New World Mongoloids are somehow inferior to the Anglo-American British in some way, it was no reason to enslave &amp; holocaust them BUT even less reason to feel bad about after restitution has been paid and apologies given. History has seen many victims turn into agressors and vice-versa. PAT BUCHANAN observed that History was being downgraded in American schools since the 60s. </p>

		<p>This clip has been around for a while.  However, it&rsquo;s refreshing to see someone reveal their true feelings.  I&rsquo;m thinking his sentiment is fairly common, if rarely spoken.  Blacks and whites need to pause and think about what it&rsquo;s like to walk in the other guy&rsquo;s shoes. For example, I&rsquo;ll never deny that there are some definite challenges to being black.  However, black people need to understand that the seas don&rsquo;t part for you merely because you&rsquo;re white.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m under the impression that &#8220;white privilege&#8221; is predicated on the idea that whites derive an advantage at the expense of blacks. This is an obvious fiction.  Being white while living among blacks confers upon you no advantage versus being white while living exclusively among whites, in fact, quite the opposite.  This is easy to prove with quality of life statistics.  Being black while living exclusively among blacks is of no advantage relative to being black and living among whites, and again, it can be proved by quality of life statistics (and immigration patterns).  There is no white privilege other than the privilege of living among whites.  Excepting the angst that goes along with being an ethnic minority, black people who live among whites have a significantly better quality of life than those who live exclusively among their own.  Those who complain either lack the intelligence to make the connection or aren&rsquo;t honest enough to admit it.</p>

		<p>The only thing sicker than that disgusting display are the people who attempt to justify it. Practice what you preach is a concept absolutely foreign to black people. No wonder most whites do not want to be around blacks, they make it so easy.</p>

This woman was ambushed. She has no sense of, no understanding of the issues and therefore no defense. Like most whites, she likely believes she&rsquo;s a good person who treats everyone, including blacks, fairly and respectfully (and it&rsquo;s likely she does).</p>
<p>It will be helpful to dissect this black mans argument for latter discussion and confrontations.</p>
<p>All I will say for now is that as much as blacks claim to hate us, they do everything in their power to be around us. At any moment, they can end their alleged torment and separate themselves and yet they cling to us and follow us wherever we go.</p>
<p>I have one basic rule for dealing with blacks. I know how violent and dangerous black men and women can be so I do everything in my power not to be around them. As much as I try, they are drawn to me and other whites. I am happy to leave them alone and let them live in peace.</p>
<p>Their actions are a testament to what they really believe about whites. As much as they claim to hate us, they know they can&rsquo;t live without us. That&rsquo;s what their anger is: jealousy.</p>
<p>BTW, he mentioned the Jews being given a homeland. American black slaves were given a homeland, Monrovia. And if that&rsquo;s not good enough, they have an entire continent waiting.</p>

		<p>Well, talk about a black having a projective tirade:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;you should fall on your knees and beg repentance for your evil, cruel, corrupt, selfish life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The problem here, is that this white woman really has no sense of racial pride and is likely a semi-Marxist herself. She cannot defend herself and is reduced to tears, simply because about 75% of what the Maoist black thug is spewing at her, she already believes as being true, just not about herself. So I find it rather hard to have any sympathy for her at all; moreover, she simply should have told this obviously hate filled ghetto goon, where to go and how to get there, and then walked away. After all, no one is holding a gun to her head and forcing her to listen to this abusive nonsense.</p>
<p>Could you imagine anyone of us here on the AR news board, really listening to these wretchedly deranged gruntings and hootings of the Mau Mau with the microphone, and not doing just that?</p>
<p>Blacks only get away with this sort of vulgar invective, because most whites allow them to!</p>

		<p><b>When it comes to how we process our racial history in America, there is the question of truth vs. lies. </b></p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.  A big lie was that the Civil Rights bill wouldnt be used to discriminate against whites, especially white males.  Another lie was that the Civil Rights bill was needed for most blacks.  Another lie was that the 1965 Immigration Reform Act by Ted Kennedy wouldn&rsquo;t change the racial stock of the country.  Lies!</p>
<p><b>Was the woman crying because she was confronted with the truth about white privilege? Are most white Americans even aware of the benefits of being white? </b></p>
<p>She was crying because she was an impressionable young woman who was stupid and naive enough to listen to their stuff.  I&rsquo;d love to see them try it to a white man old enough to be their dad.  He&rsquo;d not even so much as acknowledged their presence as he walked by. Blacks use the white privilege as a cop out because most aren&rsquo;t smart enough or determined enough to better their sorry lot in life.  All their problems are self-created.  </p>
<p><b><br>
If that is or is not the case, then who should be held accountable for the clear and lasting damage of slavery?</b></p>
<p>The blacks who sold you to slavery and the five percent of whites that owned blacks who went bankrupt after the Civil War.  But they&rsquo;re dead anyways, so what&rsquo;s the point?  You could also go after the blacks who owned slaves, but they&rsquo;re dead, too.  The only ones would be Muslims, but then again, they don&rsquo;t have the compassion and money to give you as whites would.</p>
<p><b> While some expect us to presume that history remains disconnected from the present, the truth is that they are inextricably linked. You can&rsquo;t have the present without the past, since actions of the past create the world that lies all around us.</b></p>
<p>So whites are ignorant of their history, and yet we&rsquo;re holding you back?  Where&rsquo;s the white privilege if I, as a white man, don&rsquo;t have the freedom to hire, fire and do business with only whites?  Where&rsquo;s the white privilege if I as a white man have to have my tax dollars funneled into anti-white agendas and institutions?  Where&rsquo;s the privilege if whites are the only racial group that aren&rsquo;t permitted to preserve their race, countries, and cultures?</p>

		<p>I just read Joel Hummel&rsquo;s Emancipating Slaves, Enslaving Free Men.  The resemblance of the Radical Republicans to today&rsquo;s Democrats was striking:  high-spending, high-taxing big-government &#8220;progressives&#8221; imposing a social revolution  &mdash;  i.e., racial egalitarianism  &mdash;  on their fellow Americans by force.  So that is one piece of history we might keep in mind.</p>
<p>Another is that slavery forced whites to maintain a police state, constantly on the lookout for runaways and malcontents.  Only a minority of families owned slaves, so the whole population was enslaved for the benefit of that minority.  We are experiencing that again, as the people becomes enslaved to &#8220;defend&#8221; the social order against the inevitable friction caused by integration of incompatible peoples.  </p>
<p>The Confederacy was an unmitigated disaster, a whole country organized around keeping  down the blacks.  It became illegal even to discuss abolition.  Confederate war socialism verged on totalitarianism, and ruined the wealth of Southerners.  </p>
<p>Much history to remember.  Probably the most important lesson from slavery is that it was impardonably short-sighted to import vast numbers of blacks to a continent where whites intended to live.  Of course, there are always those interested only in short-term gain, and in general people cannot stray far from the main currents of their era.</p>

<p>Who is to be held accountable for slavery you ask? Well how about for a change we blame the BLACK chieftains and slavers who captured their own people to be shipped off to the Americas for huge profits. Slavery was horrible but I don&rsquo;t get what this nut means when he says that white people try to forget about slavery. Because sometimes I feel that all white liberals talk about is slavery this and slavery that.</p>

<p>Reality escapes these privileged blacks who live in the lap of luxury, the wealthies minority in history; they aught to be deported to their homeland and see what a real boot camp is all about; how about Uganda, or Somolia for starters, I&rsquo;ll chip in for the extra baggage.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll refrain from making the obvious comments, since Im sure there will be plenty. </p>
<p>But I will point out a trait that I find to be very common amongst blacks. The man with the bullhorn, like many blacks, seems to be of the opinion that whomever speaks the loudest, wins the argument. In this case, his voice had to be amplified 10 times louder than the White girl in the video. No doubt he thinks he showed Whitey who won that &#8220;debate&#8221; by screaming into that bullhorn. </p>
<p>Also his &#8220;facts&#8221; are in dispute to say the least. </p>

		<p>What you are seeing is nothing more than a metamorphized Christianity.</p>
<p>Instead of, &#8220;Look what your sins did to the Annointed One!&#8221;</p>
<p>It is now, &#8220;Look what your sins have done to the People of Color!&#8221;</p>
<p>The propaganda changes, according to the times.</p>
<p>But what the accusers want, from both examples, is the same: Guilt, self-hate, self-reproach  &mdash;  all of which make the victim docile, pliable and easy to herd.</p>
<p>And when a means to repent, AND BE CLEANSED, is presented  &mdash;  the victims fall all over each other to be the most sincere repenter.</p>
<p>It is no secret that Christianity first found followers among women. It is no less true that the Cult of White Guilt also finds ready victims among them.</p>
<p>It is also interesting that the manipulators are (or were, before it was discredited) trying an alternative approach: </p>
<p>Look what your sins (meaning &#8220;your technological progress, which has left other peoples far behind&#8221;) have done to the environment! THE EARTH! Global warming!</p>
<p>I suppose other approaches will also be tried to make the virtues of excellence into vices. </p>
<p>But the goal is always the same: Level down everyone. Especially Whites. They have excelled TOO MUCH AND TOO OFTEN.</p>

		<p>This is just another example of blacks trying to make contemporary whites &#8220;pay&#8221; for the sins of their fathers.  It does not interest me to see this video of a black man berating a white woman.  If she agreed to this voluntarily, then she is a fool.  What matters is, this is TODAY, and we do not spend today attempting to deal with the actions of our forebears in the past.  Blacks need to quit trying to rewrite history, quit trying to get somebody to pay them for being black, and get with this business of living TODAY.</p>

		<p>It will never end. Every nation and race has a boogeyman and This kind of blame will be with us as long as the earth turns. I am of Scottish descent and was told stories about the Highland Clearances by the British, though I must add that my grandmother made sure that we kids knew that was long ago and was just the way matters were; the modern British do not answer to us for their ancestors because she made sure that we just understood that they owe us nothing. It&rsquo;s better to just get on with it. <br>
  I wouldn&rsquo;t wish the modern Black regard for blaming others for their troubles on anyone; Blacks live in a kind of hell of their own fantasies, and that is very sad.</p>

		<p>The video underlines just how wrong blacks are about &#8220;our&#8221; history.  We build your cities and fight your wars&hellip;</p>
<p>They went from working the fields to building the cities?  Right, in your dreams buddy.</p>
<p>If he would remember correctly, the armed forces originally prohibited blacks from serving.  Blacks fought that policy and won!  Dude, if you want to be part of the military, don&rsquo;t go and cry that you fight our wars for us because you don&rsquo;t.  In fact, when the armed forces were all white, we always won!</p>
<p>The woman is better off taking the crybaby approach.  Blacks are good at coldcocking and they are not gender-biased in any way.  If she would have challenged his fantasies, in all likelihood she would have ended up in a coma.</p>

		<p>Why was she crying?  Why didn&rsquo;t she walk away?  I would have just walked away.  Why listen to such drivel?</p>
<p>But there is white privilege.  I will admit that.  I am privileged because I studied in school.  Because I kept my nose clean.  Because I go to work every day.  Just like most white people.  Because most white people go to school, do not commit crime and do work we have certain privileges.  One of those privileges is that I can walk into a Korean grocery and not be followed around.  Because the Korean grocer does not fear me like he does the black who is more likely to rob and murder him.  Another privilege is walking down the street and having woman NOT clutching their purses because I am not likely to grab their purses.  I also give privilege.  When I see a couple of Asian-Indian teens walking towards me I do not cross the street like I might if a couple of black teens were walking towards me.  Privilege is earned for the most part.<br>

		<p>I was infumated with rage after watching this video &mdash; but I re-watched the beginning and realized that something productive came out of this insane situation: the naive, liberal woman learned a crucial lesson in the realities of race.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&rsquo;t matter what my nationality is; it doesn&rsquo;t matter what color all of us are. And I love all of you,&#8221; she said. Typical tripe from an egalitarian.</p>
<p>Now that she&rsquo;s had a cold lesson in the realties of race, she should hopefully come to the realization that many blacks loathe, hate and despise her simply because she&rsquo;s white. Perhaps she will no longer subscribe to the delusions of egalitarianism.</p>
<p>Personally, if I was a black person living in America, I would thank God every day that my ancestors were shipped to the New World on slave-ships. Black people living in America enjoy a much higher standard of living than Nigerians, Liberians and practically all other black African nations. But pointing this fact out to black people will only be met with hostility and contempt, because at the very base black people are only capable of crying about non-existant &#8220;racism&#8221; to explain their failures and frustrations instead of thinking intelligently.</p>

We are projected to become the minority in all white nations that we built with our blood, sweat, and tears in the very near future. Although we are very slightly the majority here in the USA we are assaulted, raped, robbed, and murdered by minorities all out of proportion to their numbers. Does anyone think that when we become the minority in this country that we will be any different than the whites in South Africa that are being ethnically cleansed from their homeland?

		<p>We have blacks in Canada talking the same way. The problem is most blacks came to Canada after 1960. They were invited into Canada and came voluntarily. The number of blacks in Canada before 1960 was miniscule and socially insignificant. Our blacks have the same problems as American blacks; school failure, broken families, welfare, crime, and the feeling of alienation. Yet our blacks talk the same as this clown on the video even though Canadian race history is entirely different.</p>

		<p>It really seems to me that most Blacks are engaging in a widespread campaign to induce White guilt and culpability.  I hope I&rsquo;m not giving them too much credit, but it feels like they will be eternally fixated on making us feel as if we owe them something, even after most of us (might) wake up.  I feel strongly that this is a cover-up; a blatant sham to disguise the intellectual and competitive disadvantage that Blacks possess.  And I agree, it will take more of this sort of bantu banter to snap enough of the White masses out of their collective slumber.</p>

		<p>Despite all the accommodations that American society has made for them, black attitudes won&rsquo;t change until they feel there is parity in everything with Whites. However, the gap will not close, and parity will likely never happen because blacks don&rsquo;t make enough of an effort to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps. So, yes, it will never end. This is why billions in Aid to Africa hasn&rsquo;t improved anything; it&rsquo;s why there is rampant crime and poverty among American blacks. The fact that there still isn&rsquo;t a single high functioning majority-black country anywhere in the World is especially telling. </p>
<p>Does a certain degree of White Privilege exist? Yes. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s debatable. However, things are relatively fair for the most part and there is opportunity enough for anyone with the ambition to go after it. Blacks are developing a &#8220;victim complex&#8221; that will soon become a central and permanent part of their identity (if it hasn&rsquo;t already). Citing historical discrimination is perfect for them since it ensures that there will always be an excuse to use to mask their shortcomings.</p>

		<p>I believe that the idea of White Privilege is false and simply a sort of psuedo perspective of an inferior who first worships, then envies, and then hates - whites.  The current hub-bub about the white bias of all children is partial proof of this idea.  White Privielge exists in the minds of non-whites (blacks) who cannot adjust to living as a minority or majority anywhere.  Other than that, it is natural for a majority nativist population to dominate their own domestic, national scene.  What has been going on lately here is that &#8220;America&#8221; is on a kind of bad trip, attempting to assert the untrue, produce a reality that has no substance, stand the world on its end - and say that it is justice and what America is about.  We have had to invert and pervert every piece of common sense and natural instinct in order to do it.  </p>
<p>But the strain is beginning to show.  The drive to the &#8220;Obama Nation&#8221; or whatever you want to call it, with its racial absurdities and psuedo-utopian projections, that even the proclaimers seem to not completely understand.  I think that more and more whites are beginning to see the racial nature of leftist politics as well as the racial hypocrisy of the right.  It can&rsquo;t go on very much longer - the strain of the forced fascade is becoming too obvious.</p>

		<p>This woman seems to lack Feminist training. Doesn&rsquo;t she realize that White women did not enslaved Blacks? In fact, they were covictims of evil White men. Moreover, from mid-nineteenth century onward, women worked to advance Black welfare.</p>
<p>They helped to promote the Civil war: The Quackers were run by women and they did much to start that conflict. Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote the influencial &#8220;Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin&#8221;; she was referred to as &#8220;the Little Lady Who Started the War&#8221;. Women worked indirectly in Protestant churches through the ministers, who knew that attacking slavery was a sure to gain female support, and this, according to author Phillip Wyle, was necessary to keep their pulpits.</p>
<p>In the 20th century, women gained voting power, and have used it to to elect politicians who advanced the African as well as the Female agenda. While I cannot document it, I believe that women in the U.S. Communist party, used their infuence to benefit Blacks even when it was not in the Party&rsquo;s interest.</p>
<p>Perhaps the women is being disingenuous, if not, she needs to attend a Feminist Boot camp.</p>

		<p>Blacks are not our friends. They are nothing but an insatiable thorn in our side. They demand access to our neighborhoods, universities, work places, media, schools, etc. </p>
<p>You know what? I admire the black guy in the video, if for no other reason than he is a black nationalist.</p>
<p> You may hate him for being harsh on the pathetic young woman, but to me, that&rsquo;s more of a reflection on the woman herself than the angry black guy. Had that black guy encountered me, he would have had something else coming, and there wouldn&rsquo;t have been any crying to inspire sympathy.</p>
<p>However, the fact remains that he is a black nationalist, and blacks with his sentiments have historically been allied with white activists. In the video, he mentioned the desire for blacks to have their own nation, and I don&rsquo;t blame him! </p>
<p>The way I see it, complete racial separation is a win-win situation. Blacks get to live among themselves, enjoy autonomy and self-respect, and avoid the wicked influences of whites. In exchange, we get to avoid the burdensome presence of blacks. Sure, we may have to give up some territory and pay some reparations, but in the long run it will be worth it. Though I am 100% opposed to reparations in almost every circumstance, if contributing some money towards a reparations fund would help create a separate black nation, count me in!</p>
<p>So yes, the black militant may be a jerk, but at least he&rsquo;s not one of those whiny black leftists who constantly demands access to white peoples&rsquo; realm. He believes in black self-sufficiency and nationhood, which I respect. </p>
<p>Regarding this woman, she is simply pathetic. I could have used various great retorts, though I would probably have to brace myself for a fight. I don&rsquo;t tolerate edgy black behavior, and neither should any white. Only by asserting our racial consciousness and unapologetically fighting on behalf of whites will &#8220;privilege walks/privilege boot camps&#8221; end. </p>
<p>Blacks never pick on a white person with a backbone, and when they do, they pay the price (ie. Epic Beard Man). Basically, whenever whites encounter such militant blacks, they need to assert themselves and put on their meanest faces. </p>
<p>However, if there is any hope, perhaps this pathetic woman learned a valuable lesson. Maybe now, naive white liberals like her will realize that we were right all along. </p>

		<p>Anonymous 14,</p>
<p>Always the issue  of  parceling  out blame  for  the  Atlantic slave  trade. If  you  read  the  logs  of the  slavers you  will  note  the  following: </p>
<p>1) the demand for the  slaves came from  the European  side. So  they  sailed all  the  way  down  to the  West  African coast to entice the locals  to  provide cheap  labor  for  the  plantations  in the  Americas. The  Africans  did  not  travel to  Europe advertising  their  wares&hellip;</p>
<p>2)The bulk  of the  captives  were  war  prisoners, with the  wars  being  fueled by  the slavers themselves  &mdash;  with  weaponry  such  as  musket and  cannon.  Alcohol and  cheap  items were  also  some  of the  bargaining chips. See  THEO  CONAUT&rsquo;S &#8220;A Slaver&rsquo;s Log&#8221;.</p>
<p>3) Many  of the  captives were simply  kidnapped by  roving gangs  in  the  pay  of the  slavers. Testimony  is  provided  by  the voices of the  kidnapped themselves. Read the  biographies of Gustavus  Vassa, Ajai Crowder, Mahama Baquakua, Sulayman Jobe, etc.</p>
<p>4)Here&rsquo;s my  view of the  Atlantic  trade  summed  up  in  this  short  parable. A  poor woman under  conditions of  penury and <br>
ignorance once handed over 2  of her  children to 2  strangers  for  a  pittance. The first  stranger  raised  the  child very  well that  child  enjoyed a successful  life  &mdash;  to the  extent  of realizing his/her  talents. On hearing  of the  success  of her  child  the  mother seeks  out  the  purchaser  of the  child hoping  to  gain  some  recognition. But the stranger calmly  told  the  mother. &#8220;Sorry, but you have  zero  responsibility in  the  success  of  your  child.  You washed  your hands of this  child, so  there  is  nothing in this  you  can claim.</p>
<p>The  second  stranger  did  just  the  opposite  with  the second  child. The  child  was  abused, beaten  and  made  to  live  a  life  of  living  hell.  When  the  mother  heard of  the bad  treatment  meted  out  to  her  child  she  sought out  the  second  stranger  and  asked: &#8220;why  do  you  mistreat  my  child like  that.  The  second  stranger calmly  said: &#8220;Sorry, you washed  your  hands  of this  child and  whatever  became of  that  child  was  my  responsibility, not  yours.  I would  tell  you  the same  thing  if  that  child  became  the wealthiest  person  in the  world, and  you  came  demanding  to  share in  his/her  wealth. You  have no  responsibility  in  this  matter  &mdash;  except that  in  your  ignorance and  material  lack  you handed  over  your  child  to me. But  know that  I was  fully  responsible afterwards for the fate and life  of that  child&#8221;.<br>

		<p>The simple fact is that black Africans, as a group, have no legitimate place in a modern advanced society.  There are, of course, many individual exceptions to this patently obvious observation, but as a broad generalization they are an enormous net drain on any society in which they&rsquo;re found in significant numbers.  I, and I imagine most AmRen readers, wish it were not so.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll have to be dealt with someday, if not by us, then by our ultimate conquerors, who most likely will be the Chinese, and who have no sentimental illusions about the nature of black Africans. </p>

<p>SUCH AS?</p>
<p>To get down to specifics, exactly WHAT abuses do they suffer every day?  What terrible wrongs are they subjected to that we must correct?  And WHAT reparations, exactly, do they have in mind? (Ten thousand $ per family?  Per person?  A hundred thousand?  A million??? A new house and car for everyone?  A mansion?  A lifetime annual pension?  A perpetual annuity for each black family forever? Five votes for every black?   An automatic PhD for every black, together with an executive position that is exempt from firing?  Just WHAT do they want? What compensation do they have in mind?) </p>
<p>Imprecise thinking like this is typical of blacks. It&rsquo;s like arguing with a wino.  We never see these &#8220;wrongs&#8221; or these  demands enumerated, despite blacks&rsquo; constant calls for a &#8220;dialogue on race&#8221;. (That meaning a groveling apology from us and a capitulation to all their demands.)  We can&rsquo;t possibly discuss something without knowing what it is.  Unfortunately, they&rsquo;re unable to define it. They don&rsquo;t seem to know what it is either. They just like to gripe and feel sorry for themselves. And the more they gripe, the more worked up they get, without knowing what they really want. Therefore, they are impossible to satisfy. And any attempts to appease them are doomed to be futile (as we have already seen from  half a century of the same appeasement).</p>
<p>Since they&rsquo;re so unclear about both their grievances and their demands, let me predict that even if they got reparations, that gesture would prove to be unsatisfactory. It would never be enough! They would still be grumbling that they had been cheated, that it was another white man&rsquo;s trick.  You simply can&rsquo;t deal with people who are so imprecise that they don&rsquo;t even know what they want or what they&rsquo;re complaining about. </p>
<p>But as long as they see you having more than they have, or living better than they do, they will remain convinced that injustice is afoot, and that you got it through &#8220;white privilege&#8221; by cheating them. They will ONLY be satisfied, at long last, when you are shining their shoes, wearing rags, and begging at their door for handouts.  (But don&rsquo;t expect any charity then.)</p>

<p>That won&rsquo;t work, because as you noted above, they are not happy to leave you alone and let YOU live in peace. It has to be a two-way street. But it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>They may hate you and resent you, but they cannot live without you.  At least not on the standard of living that they are accustomed to, without reverting back to an African scale of existence.  (The flea may not love the dog, but it cannot live without the dog.)</p>

<p>Imformative post OCCAM, however; Arabs were slaving in sub-Saharan blacks long before the European slave epic.  History makes clear that Arabs were buying slaves from tribes that sold their war capitives or rejected members.  In fact, Islam was created by a slave merchant named Mohammed who used a religious fired political movement (all religions have this in common) for the enhancement of slave trade; blacks north and whites south.</p>
<p>Further, it is a fact that NO white man ventured into the interior of Africa until the famous British explorations by Livingston, Burton, and Speke in the 1850s.  So even if some European manipulation went on, it was on the coasts.  The old traditions of Africans capturing and selling Africans goes back to ancient times.</p>

		<p>I didn&rsquo;t need to see the video  &mdash;  I&rsquo;ve heard these same accusations spewed at Whites and lies about black accomplishments in mandated teacher professional developments for almost three decades now (in 2011, I&rsquo;ll have in 30 years).</p>
<p>From the above article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;but the truth is that many of us in America are ignorant about racial history, primarily because our country wants to forget it&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The type of &#8216;racial history&rsquo; the media, academia and government shove in our faces every day is anti-White. If we Whites disagree or complain we are axiomatically called Nazis.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; We don&rsquo;t mention many of the horrors and evils of slavery, because we would rather presume that a holocaust can only occur in another country&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Are you kidding?</p>
<p>The &#8216;evils of slavery&rsquo; are screamed at us Whites daily via the media, academia and government.</p>
<p>Holocaust is mentioned only if it&rsquo;s against non-Whites; when it&rsquo;s practiced against Whites, it&rsquo;s ignored by the alien US government, passed over as &#8216;not worth reporting &rsquo; by the US media and, and ignored in academia (as in left out of textbooks such as the horror and democide that went on in &#8216;Uncle Joe&rsquo;s&rsquo; Soviet Union).</p>
<p>There IS  current holocaust going on of Whites  &mdash;  in Zim and SA.  Why do the US media not report the numerous black-on-White slashings, burnings, dismemberments, torture-murder of Whites  &mdash;  in Zim, SA, OR the US?</p>
<p>Why do the media not warn American Whites about vicious criminal blacks that hunt and prey on them?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;When it comes to how we process our racial history in America, there is the question of truth vs. lies&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>NO Kidding  &mdash;  but it&rsquo;s not what you think.    Daily, the media mock, debase and impugn Whites, call us (sigh) Nazis and Klansmen.  TV and movies portray us as stupid, clueless, criminal-prone racists in need of  &#8216;straightening out&rsquo;, killing or &#8216;wisdom&rsquo; from non-Whites, especially blacks.</p>
<p>The reality is exactly the opposite as blacks are disproportionally uneducated, criminal prone, violent and/or incarcerated compared to Whites.</p>
<p>Nor is academia a friend to Whites.  High school textbooks (and I mean all of them) are black-or non-White centric, vastly blowing out of proportion black accomplishment, literature and achievement while portraying Whites as genocidal colonists whose &#8216;nation was built on the backs of non-Whites&rsquo;, whose &#8216;wealth was stolen from people of color&rsquo;, and whose knowledge  &#8216;originated in Africa and was stolen by the Greeks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The alien government has its boot on our White necks, allowing (and perhaps encouraging) blacks to terrorize us.</p>
<p>What blacks do not understand is that they are expendable pawns, powerless, useful idiots playing the small role they&rsquo;ve been assigned by the alien government in the larger War being against Whites and American White Culture.</p>
<p>As john #48 writes:</p>
<p>&#8221;..They&rsquo;ll have to be dealt with someday, if not by us, then by our ultimate conquerors, who most likely will be the Chinese, and who have no sentimental illusions about the nature of black Africans&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Already the tide is turning as blacks deal with changing demographics in California and racist, ethno-centric hispanics (and increasingly Asians) ethnically cleanse them from their &#8216;historic&rsquo; neighborhoods and jobs.  </p>
<p>Black politicians?  Bought off, selling out their own people as they toe the government&rsquo;s open-border policy.</p>
<p>Blacks will find out soon enough that old Whitey wasn&rsquo;t so bad after all.</p>

		<p>Simply put, there is neither rhyme nor reason when dealing with blacks.  To willingly enter a situaton with them where your life didn&rsquo;t depend on it would be an act of self-torture.  We all know that from past experience (at least those of us who didn&rsquo;t have our heads buried in the sand).  Even something as insignificant as a glance in their direction would incite a riot.  Observe their behavior and learn from it.  One thing which you&rsquo;ll never ever see blacks do is apologize for being too racist, or trip over themselves trying to appear intolerant to others.</p>

		<p>A few things spring to mind after reading a couple of pages of those comments:</p>
<p>1) Gosh, why would whites feel antipathy against blacks?  Blacks so obviously <i>love</i> us, after all.  (a lesson I&rsquo;ve drawn from past experience is that a great many non-whites are rhetorically more useful to us than to our liberal adversaries; it&rsquo;s so easy to get these people spewing hate against whites that they might as well be on our payroll)</p>
<p>2) The irony of blacks&rsquo; Great Misfortune is entirely lost on them.  They&rsquo;re not alone, most white people fail to see it too.  That their Great Misfortune is the best thing to ever happen to a large black population, ever, just slips right on by.  Tell them there&rsquo;s a reason 99% of the blacks in Africa would gladly trade places with a black in America, <i>any</i> black in America (you might get some argument if the black American is serving a long prison term), and you&rsquo;ll get everything but an honest response.</p>
<p>3) At some level blacks certainly know whites are the best thing for blacks in the history of the universe, which is why black separatism is a non-starter.  Blacks belie their tales of woe by following the supposed villains everywhere they go.</p>
<p>Want to know what someone who genuinely feels oppressed wants?  Just as race-realists, white nationalists, and ethnopatriots; we just want everyone to leave us alone.</p>

<p>Yes, blacks are just gullible pawns playing the role they&rsquo;ve been assigned&hellip;.  to serve the interests of those who manipulate them.   That role, until now, has been to attack, badger, wear down, and weaken Whitey.  That &#8220;role&#8221; is their only part in the play.  They are mere gadflies, needing to be swatted (which whitey is too &#8220;nice&#8221; to do). In the broader scope of history, they are minor players.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re also troublesome, volatile, and dangerous; and they are already being replaced in California (where their job is largely done and Whitey is already a minority).    CA  is said to be the barometer of the nation, and how CA goes today, the rest of the nation will follow tomorrow.  That doesn&rsquo;t look good for blacks.   With Whitey dethroned,  they will have served their purpose.  The New Masters will have no further need for them.</p>

		<p>With respect to OCCAM&rsquo;s post on &#8220;parceling out blame for slavers&#8221;, the issue is really irrelevant. No one can definitively state HOW the first slaves were bought, much less by whom.</p>
<p>Slaves were a commodity. There was a seller (the African coastal tribes), a buyer (White European slavers). The two sides coming ttp an agreement on the matter.</p>
<p>Given there is more than enough blame on BOTH paries, why careabout what happened centuries earlier? That slavery is still occurring in partes of modern-day Africa is also an inarguable reality. Like the reality modern day Africa has only its own collective self to blame for the perpetual state of misery so many &#8220;modern&#8221; Africans live in.</p>

		<p>I have lived in black-ruled Africa because I was raised by grandparents who were diplomats.  Black people in the U.S. should be on their knees thanking God every day for the blessing of living in the U.S., where white people do take care of them.  I have seen for myself what happens to black people in countries ruled by black people, and it is horrible. </p>
<p>I have had black people beg me to help them get to the U.S., where my father is from, or to Europe, where my mother&rsquo;s family is from.  I do mean beg me.  These were the parents of children that I had played with so I saw them as authority figures because they were adults while I was a child.  Yet they would really lay the guilt upon me, even while I was younger than some of their children, as if I had the power to save their lives.  That is how desperate they were to get away from their homelands ruled by their own kind and into those where they could get Whitey to pay for their welfare, housing etc. instead of being slaughtered and persecuted.  Yet I notice that once black immigrants get into &#8220;white countries,&#8221; they make ridiculous demands that get even more ridiculous within one generation at the most.</p>
<p>I would like to see American black people with their own homeland separate from white people and probably other non-white people who generally have more sense than most black people.  I sure would not be volunteering for any ambassador positions to that black nation though.  I would also want to live as far from the border as possible.   </p>

  &#8220;The way I see it, complete racial separation is a win-win situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>WRONG! Blacks would turn their separate territory into a total failure within a few years, and come back to White Americans, begging, DEMANDING more financial and other help!<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right. Within a few years, the black country would become a basket case, and would be a nest of all sorts of crime, smuggling, and subversion aimed at the white state. They would probably snuggle up to some powerful foreign country and allow the building of military bases aimed at the white state, in return for aid.  To forestall this, the white state would end up having to &#8220;adopt&#8221; them as a satellite and sustain them with massive and perpetual subsidies. You just can&rsquo;t get around it.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s also time for Blacks to get over the nonsense of blaming the enslavement of earlier generations for their own failings and shortcomings. EVERY human nation or racial group has either held slaves or has been enslaved at one time or another over the last 50,000 years. You can only use that time-worn excuse of slavery for so long. After a while THINKING people get tired of hearing it; see it for the worthless excuse it really is.</p>

But that only applies to people who know something of history. It doesn&rsquo;t work with people who are absymally ignorant and think they are the centerpiece of history and the world revolves around them.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I have had black people beg me to help them get to the U.S. &hellip;. I do mean beg me. These were &hellip;were adults while I was a child. Yet they would really lay the guilt upon me, as if I had the power to save their lives. That is how desperate they were to get away from their homelands ruled by their own kind&#8221; &hellip;.  Ginny<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>I can relate to that, Ginny.    I&rsquo;ve had the same experience.  They have pleaded and implored;  and when I tell them that there is nothing  I can do, that there are laws and immigration formalities to be complied with, they do not believe me. Talk about laying on  guilt!  They insist that it would be SO EASY for me, and that if I  REALLY wanted to,  I could help them.    </p>
<p>They have a pathetically childlish view of the world that is hard to deal with.  They see the world as a small community; and Americans are all a tribe who know one another.   They seem to think that all I have to do is pick up the phone, dial the White House, and instruct the president that I want so-and-so admitted to the USA immediately.   Bingo, it&rsquo;s done!  They will have a life of luxury from then on.</p>
<p>Their conditions and problems may be pathetic, but you cannot reason with children like this.   There is very little you can do for them.   Albert Schweitzer was right.</p>
