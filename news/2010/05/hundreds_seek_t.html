<h1>Hundreds Seek to Fill Vacant Positions at Pro&rsquo;s Ranch Market</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dan Neligh, azfamily (Phoenix), April 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Job hunters turned out in the hundreds to fill recently-vacant positions at Pro&rsquo;s Ranch Market stores, where a federal audit led to the firing of some 300 workers.</p>
<p>Roxanne Nieves, one of the many that came out in search of a job, said she came to apply after she heard about the layoffs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We heard they are firing a lot of illegal people, so we&rsquo;re here to apply,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About 300 of the 1,500 total employees at the six Phoenix supermarkets were let go this week after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement audit found them to be working illegally.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We need an easy program for employers to use to hire people  &mdash;  safe, easy, quick  &mdash;  so we don&rsquo;t have to deal with ICE audits,&#8221; she [Attorney Julie Pace] said.</p>
<p>Pro&rsquo;s Ranch Market is among some 1,600 U.S. businesses, including 84 in Arizona, that have undergone ICE audits since July 2009.</p>
<p>ICE says the goal is to reduce demand for illegal employment and protect job opportunities for the nation&rsquo;s lawful workforce.<br>

		<p>This shows that the argument  that illegals take jobs that Americans won&rsquo;t do is a lie.</p>

		<p>They may have left Arizona but I know where they went. I went to the bank this morning and it was a visit to the twilight zone. </p>
<p>The bank I use was bought out some time ago and now the employees are all Spanish speakers. These are probably not illegals but it tells you something that a bank would need so many Spanish speaking employees. </p>
<p>I remember when the employees of that bank all had a Southern accent and I guess they still do but it&rsquo;s a lot farther South. </p>

<p>No way, the ICE audits must continue there and be expanded to all 50 states, territories and the moon.</p>

		<p>What a novel idea, prevent foreigner&rsquo;s from having first dibs at US jobs.</p>
<p>If a US citizen travels to Canada to work, he can be detained, and even arrested if that job is not first offered to the general Canadian workforce. This happened to a coworker of mine.</p>

		<p>So much for the &#8220;jobs Americans won&rsquo;t do&#8221;. Let&rsquo;s keep clearing out illegals and see how many more jobs pop up that Americans &#8220;won&rsquo;t do&#8221;. </p>

		<p>Hate to say it, but &#8220;TOL-JA!!&#8221;  Americans WILL take the jobs held by illegals.  Americans want to work and deserve to work.  We need to boot the illegals out for good.  </p>

		<p>The ICE doesn&rsquo;t have billions of employees Ms. Pace.  In fact, they are way understaffed thanks to Obama, the Dems, and the RINOS.  Therefore, if you received ICE scrutiny and audit, it was because you were well known for employing illegals, and stiffing legal Americans.  I&rsquo;d have gone further.  I&rsquo;d have prosecuted you client to the max.</p>
<p>Did anybody else notice that the ONE interviewed had a hispanic last name?  Nieves.  Get rid of 1500 illegals, and who&rsquo;s first in line to replace them?  Somebody named Nieves.  What?  There was nobody WHITE in line?  The story IS about whites applying for the jobs that were denied them, and are now available due to ICE finally doing their job over the last year.</p>
<p>Post script.  Watch how diligent and busy (NOT) ICE is AFTER the mid term election.</p>

		<p>Watch Obama come down hard on the ICE employees who did the audit.  How <i>dare</i> they cause unemployment for illegal aliens?  Obama needs those illegal aliens to stick around for their amnesty so there will be somebody to vote for him in 2012.<br>

		<p>I am white and I went to Ranch Market to buy a birthday cake for a co worker.  I stood in line while they waited on all of the hispanic customers behind me!  At first, I thought that I had done something wrong, but after 15 minutes, I realized why they would not acknowledge me. I will never go to Ranch market again.  Of course, if the situation was reversed, we would have national headlines! Many markets in Phoenix now are all hispanic.Where can I move to get away from this?  I feel like a stranger in my own country. Many of my relatives fought and died for this country and now it is not a place for us anymore.</p>
