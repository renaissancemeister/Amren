<h1>Program Aims to Keep Young Somali-Canadians out of Gangs</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Canadian Broadcasting Centre, May 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Alberta government is spending $202,000 to keep Somali-Canadian youth in Edmonton away from gangs and drugs, Justice Minister Alison Redford announced Tuesday.</p>
<p>The money goes towards after-school programs and academic support in school.</p>
<p>Another $1.3 million will be spent on integrating immigrants and refugees into the community and $400,000 more towards a mentoring initiative to keep immigrant youth from drug trafficking and gang activity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whenever we talk about safe communities, we&rsquo;re talking about a whole spectrum of issues that need to be dealt with,&#8221; Redford said Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ll tell you in the past what we haven&rsquo;t focused on sufficiently is the piece we are talking about today, which is mentoring, support for kids, support for parents &hellip; to make sure that people are feeling connected to the communities they live in and the wider community at large.&#8221;</p>
<p>The projects are funded through the Safe Communities Innovation Fund.</p>
<p>More than 23 young Somali-Canadian men have been slain in Alberta in the last five years.</p>
<p>While a few of the victims were not involved in crime, more faced charges or convictions for drugs and weapons. Police believe many were involved in gangs. Many grew up in Ontario but moved to Alberta in recent years.</p>
<p>Task force still needed</p>
<p>Mahamad Accord, president of Edmonton&rsquo;s Alberta Somali Community Centre, said while the money will benefit the community, a task force is still needed.</p>
<p>Community members have signed a petition calling on the Alberta government to form a task force to find ways to solve the cases and prevent more deaths.</p>
<p>So far, the Alberta government has rejected the idea, believing it would cost too much and take too long to show results.</p>
<p>Accord told CBC News that Tuesday&rsquo;s announcement doesn&rsquo;t deal with crime prevention  &mdash;  something the Somali-Canadian community desperately needs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not diminishing the work my community has built here but what we are looking for is diversion,&#8221; Accord said.</p>
<p>&#8220;So if they really want to do something for the community they have to look at the bigger picture, which is who is killing the 30 youth and why.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Other Canadian cities are forced to do the same.</p>
<p>The municipality of Ottawa is attempting to &#8220;keep the adversary close&#8221; by supporting a Somali basketball league, and having its mainly white police force interact with the Somali youth as much as possible.</p>
<p>Next on the agenda is attempting to recruit &#8216;clean&rsquo; Somali youth into the police service, so that they may keep an eye on their clan brothers. </p>
<p>So far it hasn&rsquo;t made a dent in Somali participation in gangs.  Some start doing serious crimes as young as fifteen.</p>

		<p>I believe that is the most northern  city with over one million people in North America. This should be a HUGE lesson for non-race realist reading this. Just a few African minorities force the city to spend money and resources to deal with the problems caused by blacks. Was the extra crime and money used to try to prevent it needed? </p>

<p>OH, the mostly &#8220;white&#8221; police force already does interact with the Somali youth as &#8220;much as possible&#8221;!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet they do! Why is it that the groups from &#8220;outside&#8221; always have to have intervention groups, task forces, programs, boxing programs, teams, sports, designed and created just for &#8220;them&#8221;? We must find a way to channel all that energy, OH YES!!</p>
<p>Alberta! 23 of &#8220;them&#8221; slain in the last 5 years. Most folks would not even imagine that there are 23 Somali in all of Alberta to begin with. And these desert dwellers from near the equator, isn&rsquo;t Alberta the last place on earth you think to find a Somali?</p>

		<p>This is happening everywhere these Somalis live. They are like parasites sucking the blood out of the local community. They usually also represent the hightest group in the crime statstics disproportionately to their numbers. They can&rsquo;t help it - it&rsquo;s in their genes. Look at the rest of Africa and how successful that is!</p>

		<p>I know a proof positive way to keep Somalis out of Ottawa gangs, but I am sure the Canadian Goverment will do a remarkably effectve jobwith their plan.<br>
Of course some white Canadians are going to pay a very dear price for the Goverments&rsquo; plan.<br>
I wonder if any of the future Murder,Arson,Burglary,Assault,Robbery,Kidnapping,Rape (MaBarker)crime victims are for diversity. (sorry I cannot remeber &#8220;e&#8221;).</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to hear so much bad news from Canada. Not long ago, Toronto and Vancouver were on the Forbes list of the 20 best places to live in the world. Today, there&rsquo;s not only this story, but also the one about the 8-year-old white girl who was being sexually abused by black bullies at school. Canada&rsquo;s inner cities will soon be like so many in the US.  </p>

		<p>We&rsquo;ve got Somalis where I live.  They seem to be everywhere, all of a sudden.  It&rsquo;s now common to see groups of women in burkas at the local park.  They go swimming in the public pools with all of their clothes on because bathing suits are immodest.  The pools now have single-sex swim times (posted in Arabic) for the benefit of all of our new Muslim residents.  The only positive I can see is that native-born kids of whatever ethnicity have found a new bond in their shared dislike of the Somalis, who of course are aggressive toward them and who travel in packs. </p>

<p>Earth to Canadian government: that&rsquo;s what Somalis do. They slay other Somalis. They also slay an awful lot of non-Somalis. Black Africans commit ALL types of crime   &mdash;   especially violent crime   &mdash;   at rates many times greater than those well-behaved white folks that Alberta police are used to. A high body-count is simply <i>a universal constant</i> for Africans: wherever you happen to put them, the number of bloody corpses in the local morgue will go up. You could set your watch by it. </p>
<p>Alberta needs either to learn to love these higher levels of violence and social mayhem; or <i>stop bringing in Africans</i>. Those are your only choices. Sorry, hosers, but there&rsquo;s just no third option on this one. </p>

<p><i>First</i>, lets just refer to them as <b>Somalis</b> living in Canada.</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>, these Somalis have migrated westward from Toronto where they and their families first landed as refugees from Africa. </p>
<p><i>Thirdly</i>, Somalis do not leave their comfortable welfare-laden accommodations in Toronto and trek westwards to work in the hardworking oil industry. It&rsquo;s the lucrative <b>drug trade</b> and easy money that draws Somalis to the Fort McMurray area and nothing more. These black Africans have been nurtured on welfare since their first day of arrival in Canada and know nothing of hard physical work and self-sustaining values.</p>
<p>Canadian lefties are always happy to throw our tax dollars at various social programs that continue to enable a class of people to further take from their host country. </p>
<p>My early ancestors from 140 years ago, who helped in carving out the western provinces to what they are today, knew nothing of any free social welfare programs. They either worked or they died.<br>
