<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/africa/10132613.stm">Fifa Admit World Cup Sales in Africa &#8216;Poor&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, May 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A senior Fifa official has said he was &#8220;disappointed&#8221; by the number of World Cup tickets sold to fans in African countries.</p>
<p>Jerome Valcke said only 40,000 tickets have been sold in countries in the continent outside of South Africa.</p>
<p>The football body has faced criticism for not making tickets accessible to Africans, as most tickets were being sold via the internet.</p>
<p>It is the first time the World Cup is being held on African soil.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Priced out&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Mr Valcke  &mdash;  who has previously billed the event as a &#8220;real African World Cup&#8221;  &mdash;  said that African sales were &#8220;poor&#8221; and that Fifa would have to re-think its strategy towards Brazil, hosts of the 2014 Cup.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s really not a lot of tickets when you think that we have so many African countries playing in the World Cup,&#8221; he said at a press event in South Africa.</p>
<p>&#8220;The system that we put in place was not perfect for South Africa and for Africa&#8221;.</p>
<p>He said that there were also difficulties in air travel from one African country to South Africa.</p>
<p>South African Tourism Minister Martinus van Schalkwyk said on Tuesday that the figures were 76% less than those forecasted for the event.</p>
<p>He said that only 11,300 people in Africa made ticket purchases, out of a total of 230,000 foreign fans.</p>
<p>In March, Mr Valcke denied that Africans were being priced out of tournaments.</p>
<p>While tickets in South Africa were offered at a lower price, fans in other African countries had to pay the standard amount  &mdash;  with the cheapest costing $80 (£54).</p>
<p>Critics also said that many Africans would face difficulties accessing the internet, or might not have a credit card to make purchases online.</p>
<p>Over 2.5 million tickets have been sold out of 3 million available for the World Cup, which begins in three weeks.</p>
<p>More than a million have been bought by South Africans.<br>

		<p>Regardless, I&rsquo;m confident the Africans will make their presence a clear and present reality to soccer fans &#8220;lucky&#8221; enough to be able to afford World Cup tickets.</p>
<p>But will the media report it?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m confused. Weak African sales are a harbinger of difficulty when the World Cup moves to South America because&hellip;..? If they can&rsquo;t sell out the World Cup in South America, FIFA would be in more trouble than a strategy overhaul could ever remedy. </p>
<p>My guess is that the biggest barrier to Africans outside of South Africa will not be cost, but rather visa availability. South Africa is already overrun by the draining of Zimbabwe. I&rsquo;m sure that South African immigration officials will be on the lookout for families of &#8220;soccer fans&#8221; buying one-way tickets to J-burg, and that visas may be a much scarcer commodity than World Cup tickets. <br>

<p>The Media will report is like this:</p>
<p>&#8220;There is still hate at <b>both sides</b>. The black people are still poor in the former Colony, their situation hasn&rsquo;t changed since the brutal regime of white apartheid has ended&hellip; &#8220;</p>

It&rsquo;s that racist digital divide.</p>
<p>Weren&rsquo;t there two programs to get African computers? One was buy one computer and a second for an African. The other involved selling inexpensive, hand-power-generated laptops.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t heard much about either one.<br>

<p>I think you&rsquo;re referring to the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) initiative.  I can give you some late breaking covered-up news about that:  One of the first things that many of the black boys in African who got OLPC computers did with them is to surf porn websites.  (Thereby making One Lapdance Per Child a more appropriate acronym).  The OLPC impresarios installed anti-porn filters on future devices.</p>

<p>Any white spectators who show up are just plain stupid.  If the teams shows up to play, they&rsquo;ve got to be totally insane.</p>
<p>If whites and the teams refuse to attend, to entertain the blacks who might attend the event they could instead have a fireworks display.</p>

		<p>This is an interesting article and the references made to Brazil especially so in that Brazil will be hosting the next Summer Olympics in 2016 after it hosts the FIFA World Cup Soccer Tournament in 2014. Our arrogant HUIC-(Head Usurper In Charge) botched gangland Chicago&rsquo;s chances to host the 2016 Summer Olympics with his tacky bling bling trip to Copenhagen to claim his Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
<p>Given the precarious state of the world economy, it would be reckless to predict the paid attendance results of most any major international public event scheduled for summer of 2016. However, I feel confident in saying that if there is a world economy left come summer 2016, Brazil will have no problem booking rooms and inbound flights. The Brazilian government has lots of experience and stomach in cleaning its streets of urchins and thugs when its economic interests deem it convenient to do the same.</p>

		<p>These claims about Africans being both poor and lacking computers are lies.  Why every day I receive numerous emails from Nigerians and other Africans offering to share their vast wealth with me, if only I send them my bank account numbers or a couple of hundred Dollars for &#8220;transfer fees.&#8221;  Truly a kind and generous race, and obviously extremely computer-savvy and literally drowning in so much money that they must work hard to give it away.  </p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m sure they are not coming to South Africa because of the legacy of racism.</p>

		<p>As someone who escaped South Africa in 1999 (dual nationality-British and South African), there are several reasons why the Soccer WC will not bet on the host country&rsquo;s full satisfaction despite the propaganda after it isn&rsquo;t over, one being the extreme risk of being murdered for your cell-phone or wallet/wrist watch by the Very violent criminals there (never happened under Apartheid and black South Africans form the most victims) who as ever are very disappointed at the promises being broken, as usual, of the ex-terrorist Marxist-trained government that took over after Apartheid was overcome, the facts being that a citizen/visitor there is 10 times more likely to be unlawfully killed than in the USA.  </p>
<p>Another problem is that despite the South African currency being worth much less now, the prices for everything have been inflated so that it is as expensive if not more so than as traveling to a 5-Star resort elsewhere in the World, and the games are not only situated in stadiums that are hundreds or thousands of miles apart but accommodation is so scarce that people are offering rooms in their homes (for a fee of course).  The transport facilities are scarce and often dangerous due to the vehicles being very old and decrepit.  </p>
<p>The SA government, being &#8220;very worthy of respect for the peoples&rsquo; needs&#8221; has diverted cash from much needed hospitals and schools to build the new stadiums and refurbish existing ones and much profit is expected.  The power stations suffer major power cuts lasting hours (they call it load shedding) and while generators have been installed at the stadiums, the cuts will still occur outside including in the hotels and private houses as they do now and have done for over three years. </p>
<p>Even the advice in the various foreign government web-sites gives veiled serious warnings about visiting South Africa where foreigners have even been know to be set on fire (Zimbabweans).</p>
<p>Ordinary South Africans will be sold or given tickets so the TV cameras will record a big spectator turn out to show history that all is well and prosperous under the Marxist government, which as before in the fight against Apartheid, is expert at false propaganda.</p>
<p>If you are going, make sure you have bullet-proof insurance even for body recovery back home.</p>

		<p>The most expensive pay per view, internet, or cell phone package is a pittance compared to the costs incurred by potential fans who end up in the hospital after a mugging or a car jacking. It&rsquo;s not the same as being there, but I personally value my health over &#8220;the experience&#8221;. I would imagine that the Asians, Europeans, and South Americans do too. When are they going to report the sales of electronic alternatives to actually having to go to South Africa. </p>
<p>It should be telling that one of the vehicles that we now use in Iraq to ward off IED&rsquo;s is the MRAP. This was first designed in South Africa in the 1970&rsquo;s. While it does not happen here in the US, they will car jack and set IED&rsquo;s under police vehicles in SA. </p>

<p>Yep, no prizes for predicting they will blame the poor world cup on the legacy of Apartheid. It is impossible for the ANC to accept responsibility for its poor handling of the crime situation in South Africa and hence will always need a scapegoat. </p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, there will be a last minute flood of white people buying tickets.  All tickets will be sold!  Some tickets will be donated to poor blacks as a form of social justice.</p>
<p>The rest will be bought by adventurous young white (and clueless) liberals who want to experience the vibrancy of diversity.  They are like the armies of young white idealists who go hiking in the mountains of Iraq/Iran or who spend their summers in awful third world nations to uplift the poor and suffering natives.</p>

		<p>Actually the legacy of apartheid will be responsible, or rather the death of it. Afro engineering will be in it&rsquo;s finest hour. Of all places to hold an olympics, Africa, or Brazil, are certainly amoung the worst imaginable. A great dilema to ponder, who will our African/AmeriKan losers compete for? This could very well be the most devisive olympics ever. The opportunities for racial awareness are nearly endless. An event long soap opera at it&rsquo;s most sickening, aka a marxist hate whitey awareness media extravanganza.</p>

<p>Or by moon-eyed Christian churches, the kind who send their members to African sewers to hand out Bibles and oatmeal to the heathen.  I have no doubt that the yard sales, cookie tables outside Wal-Mart and streetside can-shakers will be going full steam this summer to make certain no downtrodden African victim of Racism will be forced to miss out on his Cultural Heritage.</p>
<p>Whatever happened to the Church Militant?  When did Christianity become a religion of self-righteous suicide?<br>

		<p>A rugby semi-final of the Super 14 competition held in Soweto this weekend showed that most people who bother to attend the SWC will arrive at half time or later and get home to their accomodation Five to seven hours after the match due to traffic infrastructure failure.  And this weekend there were no power failures!</p>
<p>You can ignore the truth only for so long.  South Africa is not geared or ready to host such an event.  It will be chaotic to say the least.</p>
<p>Metro traffic officials still have no traffic strategy in place to deal with the 350 or more busses entering and leaving Sandton on a daily basis to the various venues.  They were supposed to provide FIFA with a written plan six months ago.  The Metro official concerned does not believe there are 350 busses in South Africa.</p>
