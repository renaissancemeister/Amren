<h1><a href="https://apnews.myway.com/article/20100518/D9FP4JRG0.html">Ex-Obama Pastor: &#8216;Obama Threw Me Under the Bus&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Larry Neumeister, MyWay News, May 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Barack Obama&rsquo;s controversial former pastor, said in a letter obtained by The Associated Press that he is &#8220;toxic&#8221; to the Obama administration and that the president &#8220;threw me under the bus.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his strongest language to date about the administration&rsquo;s 2-year-old rift with the Chicago pastor, Wright told a group raising money for African relief that his pleas to release frozen funds for use in earthquake-ravaged Haiti would likely be ignored.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one in the Obama administration will respond to me, listen to me, talk to me or read anything that I write to them. I am &#8216;toxic&rsquo; in terms of the Obama administration,&#8221; Wright wrote the president of Africa 6000 International earlier this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am &#8216;radioactive,&rsquo; Sir. When Obama threw me under the bus, he threw me under the bus literally!&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Any advice that I offer is going to be taken as something to be avoided. Please understand that!&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Then-Sen. Obama cut ties with Wright when his more incendiary remarks became an Internet sensation in the spring of 2008. At a National Press Club appearance in April 2008, he claimed the U.S. government could plant AIDS in the black community, praised Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and suggested Obama was putting his pastor at arm&rsquo;s length for political purposes while privately agreeing with him.</p>

Literally, Reverend? LITERALLY? If that&rsquo;s so, Rev, then you would be either hospitalized or deceased&hellip; and Obama would be charged with Manslaughter or Attempted Murder or something. <br>
 <br>
But then, what would you expect from a bunch of people who have trouble pronouncing the word &#8220;ask&#8221;   &mdash;   only THREE LETTERS and they can&rsquo;t get them in the right order! Linguistic precision has never been important to the African mind. </p>

		<p>After the damage done to the Obama campaign by Wright&rsquo;s comments I can understand why the president cut ties with him. Not that he has cut ties to all of his other radical and leftist one world types like Bill Ayers and he probably just cut ties with Wright to try to pander to White liberal voters who could possibly be put off by Wright&rsquo;s blatant racism. Not that most White guilt soaked liberals would be bothered by the rantings of this lunitics but the ones who are closer to sane might have been put off enough to not vote at all. </p>

		<p>Why should he be surprised?  Politics were the only reason Obama joined his church.  He needed to establish &#8220;street cred&#8221; to prime the pump for what he knew would be a political career on the South Side of Chicago.  And politics were the only reason Obama quit the church, in order to eliminate an obstruction from being President.</p>

		<p>How is it that blacks do not know the meaning of the word &#8220;literally?&#8221;  If B.O. had LITERALLY thrown Jeremiah Wright under a bus, he&rsquo;d be LITERALLY road-kill at this time.  I&rsquo;m not saying Wright didn&rsquo;t deserve it, but my guess is that B.O. had better things to do than hang out with a 3rd rate preacher who was a heavy albatross around B.O.&rsquo;s neck.  So now Wright has joined the legions of whiners and snivellers who didn&rsquo;t get enough of their something for nothing.  Hey, he got a 10 million dollar house - is the electric bill too high for him?  To hear him talk, you&rsquo;d think he&rsquo;d have the place blazing in the light of his &#8220;wisdom&#8221; by now&hellip;.</p>

<p>What hyperbole! But no, Obama did not throw you under the bus LITERALLY. If he did, you would be in no condition to complain about it.</p>
<p>Obviously the highly educated and erudite Rev. Wright does not know what the word LITERALLY means.</p>

		<p>The point here isn&rsquo;t that Wright isn&rsquo;t gramatically correct.  The point is he IS correct about Obama.  Obama DOES agree with Wright on most or all things, else he would not have sat in that church for 20 years.  Obama DID throw Wright under the bus (figuratively) for expedient political reasons.  The shame of it is, far too many stupid whites ignored the obvious and voted for the race hustling, white hating, American hating Marxist Mulatto.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Hey, he got a 10 million dollar house&#8221;</p>
<p>I cannot remember all the facts. Is it a $10 million house of 5,000 square feet or is it a $5 million house of 10,000 square feet? All in retirement, probably tax free as it is a manse, a church property? And too in an all-white gated community next to a golf course. Pretty good for a &#8220;rev&#8221;, wouldn&rsquo;t you say so??</p>

		<p>Ahhh&hellip;.imagine the comedy had Obama been just a tiny bit less politically savy (or arrogant) and decided to keep Wright onboard.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s some good political theatre we&rsquo;ve missed out on.</p>

		<p>Obama had to distance himself from Rev. Wright and his &#8220;God damn America&#8221; and whites &#8220;created the AIDS virus&#8221; comments in order to make himself more electable. I have no doubt Obama&rsquo;s radical anti white anti American views have not changed. He is just positioning himself publicly in order to appear less radical. </p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t join a church for twenty years, befriend the pastor, and then realize you had no idea what the church was about. This is a black radical church that admits to preaching Liberation theology. Every single sermon was an anti white anti American diatribe. </p>

		<p>Wright was a classic Lenin-esque &#8220;useful idiot&#8221;.  The problem with being a useful idiot is that one eventually becomes a useless idiot.  Wright seems to have achieved this status and - since there is at least a little justice remaining in the world - he has been left in no doubt as to the nature of his new position.</p>
<p>Of course Obama&rsquo;s views have not changed one iota since dumping Wright.  He could not have stomached Wright&rsquo;s constant anti-white, anti-America diatribes for as long as he did, let alone brought his two young daughters to hear this vitriol, unless he  completely agreed.</p>

		<p>Wright is lying in an attempt to make the gullible believe Obama has renounced the anti-white hate rhetoric he consumed with relish in Wright&rsquo;s &#8220;church&#8221; on a weekly basis for over twenty years&hellip;</p>
