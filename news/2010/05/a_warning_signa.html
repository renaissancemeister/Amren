<h1><a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/7008236.html">A Warning Signaled for Latinos and Texas</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>R.G. Ratcliffe, Houston Chronicle, May 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>If the American Dream is upward economic mobility and arrival in the middle class, the grim statistics show only a small percentage of Texas&rsquo; Hispanics are on the road to success.</p>
<p>As the state&rsquo;s Latino population continues to expand over the next two decades, if current trends stay the same, Texas is in danger of developing what one academic describes as a &#8220;permanent underclass.&#8221; Widespread poverty could pull down the standard of living for all Texans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Data from a variety of state and federal sources show the Hispanic population in Texas is economically stagnating and may be falling behind Latinos in other parts of the United States:</p>
<p>* Texas Hispanics not only make less money than Anglos, they make less money than Hispanics living in other states. The wage gap is broadest for Hispanics living on the border with Mexico, according to a report of Southwest Economy published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.</p>
<p>* Hispanics make up a third of the manual laborers in Texas. But U.S. Census statistics show that even in construction trades Hispanics account for less than a fifth of skilled labor, such as an electrician.</p>
<p>* In February, 34 percent of all Texans receiving unemployment payments from the Texas Workforce Commission were Hispanic. The payments are not available for undocumented workers.</p>
<p>* Texas native-born Hispanics have a higher high school dropout rate and a lower level of college attainment than those living in other states, Southwest Economy reported. The attrition rate among Hispanic high school students was 42 percent last year.</p>
<p>* Hispanic girls accounted for 62 percent of all births to teen mothers in 2006, the most recent year reported by the National Center for Health Statistics.</p>
<p>* One of the few bright spots in Texas is in housing. The government mortgage lending company Freddie Mac reports that 58 percent of the Hispanic households in Texas own their homes. Nationally, only half the Hispanic households own their home. But almost three-quarters of the Anglo families in Texas and nationally are homeowners.</p>
<p><b>Wage gap constant</b></p>
<p>Pia Orrenius, an economist with the Federal Reserve and co-author of the Southwest Economy study, {snip} said the wage gap in Texas has remained rather constant.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Orrenius&rsquo; report said Texas Latinos had median hourly earnings of $11.54 in 2007-2009, about 64 percent of the earnings of non-Hispanic whites. But in other parts of the U.S., Latinos earned $12.42, or about 71 percent of the non-Hispanic whites.</p>
<p>She said that is due in part to factors such as a higher minimum wage in California than Texas. She said it also is due to the fact that Mexican immigrants generally have less education and most immigration in Texas is from Mexico.</p>
<p>Orrenius said when statistical analysis is done to equalize education between Hispanics and Anglos, the wage gap dramatically decreases.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not like its racism, where people are paying Latinos a lot less than whites,&#8221; Orrenius said. &#8220;They&rsquo;re paid less because they have less education.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Signs of growth</b></p>
<p>Van de Putte said studies have found the Latino high school dropout problem is driven by boys who quit to go to work to support their families and girls who become teen mothers for the second time. She said there is a need for alternative school programs to help those students obtain high school diplomas.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Murdock [Steve Murdock, a former state demographer and former head of the U.S. Census] said the real numbers of Texas Mexican-Americans older than age 25 who have not completed high school will have grown by more than 400,000 in the past decade. If nothing changes, the percentage of the Texas workforce lacking a diploma will grow from 18 percent in 2000 to 30 percent by 2040, he said.</p>

		<p>They can only become a &#8220;permanent&#8221; underclass if Texas agrees to keep them on welfare &#8220;permanently&#8221;.  Watching what is going on in california, I&rsquo;d say the chances are pretty high that welfare is about to become a thing of the past in the US.</p>
<p>That will change many things.  But the biggest thing it will change is it will cause 90%+ of those from south of the border to leave, more or less immediately.</p>
<p>Wait and see what happens in california.  I suspect, welfare there will end, and many places in cali will become ghost towns, overnight.  Welfare in neighboring states will almost instantly be overloaded and probably collapse.  Anti-immigrant sentiment will explode&hellip;.especially among blacks.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Poorly educated Hispanics may become a &ldquo;permanent underclass&rdquo; in Texas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, and every other state in the union too, but keep this in mind:  No matter how long they are permanently an underclass blacks will ALWAYS be even lower, and, in fact, it is this ongoing underclass right now that they&rsquo;re trying to claim is due to something other than their own lack of intellect and ability.</p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s new?</p>

		<p>Excerpting a relevant published letter on the burgeoning &#8220;permanent underclass&#8221;:</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s under-5-year-old population is now 47 percent minority, with Latinos the fastest-growing segment. By age 2 or 3, Latinos are six months behind whites on cognitive tasks, such as assembling puzzles. The achievement gap is four years by the 12th grade. </p>
<p>Institutional failure of the entire educational system is assured short of a dramatic rethink of both our allegiance to single-payer (government-run) schooling and to current immigration policy, which results of high levels of low-skilled immigration. </p>
<p>SOURCES:</p>
<p>See &ldquo;Studies Find Latino Toddlers Lag White Children in Cognitive Skills&rdquo;<br>
Carla Rivera, Los Angeles Times, October 20, 2009<br>

<p>KEY EXCEPT: Latino toddlers (2 or 3 years olds) &ldquo;trail their white counterparts by up to six months in understanding words, speaking in more complex sentences and performing such simple tasks as assembling puzzles.&rdquo; <br>

<p>NO! widespread invasion by ILLEGAL ALIEN CRIMINAL PARASITES will endanger the Texas citizens&rsquo; standard of life by being subject to increasing tax burdens (someone has to support said criminal ILLEGAL ALIENS) myriads of crimes of which, rapes and robberies will be foremost, and of course the threat to White school age children (especially females) in school.</p>

		<p>Ending welfare for healthy adults must end.  The current system of an unmarried woman giving birth to an illegitimate child being considered poor must end.  Her choice. She needs to get a job.  She needs to get her baby daddy a job, She needs her family to help her.  The state needs to stop assisting healthy people who choose to have children out-of-wedlock while not employed.  TANF and AFDC must go!</p>

		<p>The reason that any group of people lags behind others economically is the fact that the laggard group has failed to get adequate education for its members.  Usually that means kids drop out of high school to either have babies or deal drugs, or both.  Personally, I think all girls should have the implant at age 13 thru 18 - that&rsquo;d at least get &#8216;em through high school minus any pregnancies.  Then they could get vocational training or college, and go out in the world equipped to make a living.  It would definitely help if families started valuing and pushing education on their kids.  Without education, NO ONE can cut it in this world.</p>

		<p>    That doesn&rsquo;t seem to have been the case in the black belt . In the nearly 60 years since Brown vs Board and some 40 years since the full implementation of it, the blacks have largely turned the tables on whites . Just like in Britain, it seems to be more and more that it is whites who tend to fall by the wayside . Wind up less educated, little prospect for a good job . Young white males tend to become lackeys for black gangsters while females wind up marrying or co-habiting with them . Sound dire ? It is, the demise of a people and culture . Seemingly, much to the joy of our own government &hellip;!? </p>

		<p>With an &#8220;underclass&#8221; of Latinos being responsible for a MAJORITY of local crime! Don&rsquo;t laugh. An awareness receiving daily reinforcement by job experience from my career.</p>
<p>Hispanics (invariably either illegal Mexican immigrants or their older anchor babies) commit crimes locally at a something like 10 or 12 to one ratio, compared to their White counterparts. Watching our prison vans and prison buses unloading at our County Criminal Courthouse is a revelation and a dramatic endorsement to my comment.</p>

		<p>As a member of the white anglo minority in Texas(half-anglo, half-german if we&rsquo;re being precise), I can definitely confirm the article in question.  Every mestizo in my age range(I&rsquo;m in my very early twenties) I know has a kid, thank goodness it&rsquo;s just one though.  This probably isn&rsquo;t the norm, as I the ones I associate with have at least graduated high school, albeit barely.</p>
<p>Their presence is entirely the fault of whites, however, even the so called &#8216;racists.&rsquo;  My step-father will talk ill of mestizos all the time, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop him from picking up a few to do yard work for cheap every now and then.</p>
<p>Getting rid of welfare and ending birthright citizenship followed by the confiscating of assets and massive deportation is the only way to solve the problem.  Border control is a good thing, but pointless when they&rsquo;re already here.</p>

		<p>The reason the Hispanics all want in is because they lack the ability to create the same quality of society that whites can create so there really is no reason at all to expect them to perform any better here than they did in their homeland. <br>
The most treasonous thing ever done to our country was to allow this mass migration of uneducated low IQ immigrants from the third world to take place. This is going to negatively effect the quality of life for all of us - permanently. </p>

		<p>Yawn.  Poorly-educated people of any race tend to constitute an underclass, everywhere in the world.  I won&rsquo;t hold my breath waiting for the Houston Chronicle to tell us something we don&rsquo;t already know.</p>
<p>As posters above have mentioned, dropping out of high school to have a baby is as near an absolute guarantee of a lifetime of poverty as exists in the United States.</p>

<p>Food for thought - In this same time period, with a college degree, I was earning $9.50 an hour with zero prospects for something better.</p>
<p>Maybe these people aren&rsquo;t taking only the jobs we &#8216;lazy anglos&rsquo; don&rsquo;t wanna do.</p>
<p>It would be nice if Tejas would enact a bill like SB 1070 so Americans can get a job and maybe have a career again.</p>
