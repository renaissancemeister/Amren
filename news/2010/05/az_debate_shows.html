<h1>AZ Debate Shows Low Profile of Latino Leadership</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jesse Washington, Buffalo News, May 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Quick: Name a leader of the national Hispanic community.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not easy for some Hispanics, let alone other Americans. Even as the Arizona immigration debate has highlighted concerns of the nation&rsquo;s more than 40 million Latino citizens, it has revealed a lack of name-brand recognition for those dedicated to serving America&rsquo;s largest minority group.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;When you&rsquo;re in Colombia, you&rsquo;re a Colombian. When you&rsquo;re in Puerto Rico, you&rsquo;re a Puerto Rican. When you&rsquo;re in the U.S., you&rsquo;re a Latino or Hispanic,&#8221; said Eric Cortes, a Philadelphia resident and member of a local leadership institute that trains people to work in the Latino community.</p>
<p>Cortes could not recall the names of any leaders of national Latino organizations, but he knew many locally based activists.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There are, in fact, many Latino leaders with national impact. Yet in the Arizona debate they have been overshadowed by the Rev. Al Sharpton, who led a march in Phoenix on Wednesday, debated pro-immigration sheriff Joe Arpaio on television and made numerous other appearances and statements.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hispanic organizations have helped millions of citizens  &mdash;  desegregating schools and other public places, helping create the Head Start program, pushing for the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. Yet people like Murguia [Janet Murguia of La Raza], Saenz [Thomas Saenz of MALDEF] and Brent Wilkes, LULAC&rsquo;s national executive director, remain unknown to many.</p>
<p>Wilkes sees several reasons. &#8220;The African-American civil rights movement, because of slavery, was more dramatic. While there are parallels to some issues, Latinos didn&rsquo;t face perhaps the same level of discrimination.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, Wilkes said, &#8220;The culture is different. Latinos are less likely to rally around the one individual. Latinos who get involved prefer to create their own thing, and not necessarily fall in line behind one person.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most civil rights leaders came out of the black church, which has a tradition of public performance and showmanship that continues to draw media attention. {snip}</p>
<p>Today, the issue of equality in America is largely seen in a black-and-white framework, while Latino issues are not covered as much. Aside from immigration, it has been years since a Hispanic issue penetrated the national discourse, like Cesar Chavez&rsquo;s farm union work starting in the 1960s or California&rsquo;s Proposition 187 effort in 1994 to prevent non-citizens from receiving social services.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This dynamic could be changing as the looming immigration reform battle gives Latino leaders a new platform and a galvanizing issue to unite people of all backgrounds.</p>

		<p>Well, this is something &#8220;Latinos&#8221; can be happy about. Although, as usual, they&rsquo;re probably out protesting that we haven&rsquo;t allowed them membership in the DAR. That&rsquo;s about the only thing left they haven&rsquo;t demanded to have!</p>

		<p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re in Colombia, you&rsquo;re a Colombian. When you&rsquo;re in Puerto Rico, you&rsquo;re a Puerto Rican. When you&rsquo;re in the U.S., you&rsquo;re a Latino or Hispanic,&rdquo; </p>
<p>This is so true.  My own students are all &#8216;latinos&rsquo;, but they are from different countries and it is hard for the white liberal women to keep them under one fabricated group identity.  There are &#8216;white&rsquo; latinos, &#8216;black&rsquo; ones, full-blooded Indian ones and lots of mixed ones in a whole rainbow of combinations. </p>
<p>They are not a racial group like whites and blacks.  (Even Asians complain that they&rsquo;re all lumped together - Cambodians, Japanese, Pakistanis, etc).</p>
<p>I asked one of my students if people in his country thought of themselves as latinos or hispanics.  He looked at me incredulously and said not at all.  People identify by their country, and South Americans think Dominicans and Mexicans are from another planet, and viceversa.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only white (usually female) liberals who try to group them all together under one umbrella, and it is not a natural grouping.</p>

		<p>Aside from the Miami Cubans, who are ethnic Spaniards, Latinos are an uninvited, failure prone ethnic group. They deserve nothing from the United States. We have our own failure-prone indigenous people living out of the public trough without having to take care of dead beat Mexicans.</p>

		<p>The only thing the various Hispanic peoples have in common is their language.  I know from my teaching experience that Central and South Americans look down on Mexicans, thinking them to be lazy and unwilling to do anything to better themselves.  There&rsquo;s no way a single leader could unite these various nationalities - too much distrust and fighting between these groups for that.  They have different histories, values, and cultural norms as well.  So I don&rsquo;t see any MLK for these folks.</p>

		<p>The answer to this is simple: they don&rsquo;t need a leadership, they have an intact culture and ethos with a simple strategy; reproduce, conquer, and hold. Leaders and politicians are simple figureheads who serve a very narrow purpose, extorting the powers, but if your group is growing naturally and steadily political reality is; you are winning, all the empty suits in the world don&rsquo;t matter in the face of one chola with 5 kids.</p>
<p>Von Clausewitz in his work &#8220;On War&#8221; stated that &#8220;War is a continuation of politics by other means.&#8221; That is nice and fine for similar civilized combatants who have goals other than total conquest. Now consider the Romans, a people dedicated to conquest and imperium, to whom violence was the pre-emminent means to their ends, to them &#8220;Politics is war by another means.&#8221; </p>
<p>With Mexicans and the reconquista they are continuing their war by another means.</p>

<p>And they are correct.  The deliberately ambiguous PC word &#8220;Asians&#8221; is <i>not</i> a racial descriptor at all, which is why the PC hierarchy demands that we use it.  The correct term is <i>Oriental</i>, and we all used it before the media convinced us it was somehow &#8220;offensive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pakistanis, Indians, Polynesians and Japanese, to name just a few, have <i>nothing</i> racially in common.  &#8220;Asia&#8221; is a continent, <i>not</i> a race.  As racial realists, we should never fall into the trap of using &#8220;asians&#8221; instead of &#8220;Orientals.&#8221;  Don&rsquo;t let the enemy define our terms.</p>

<p><br>
How about Barack Obama? </p>
<p>In other words, with a brown-skinned pro-Amesty socialist in the White House, hispanics don&rsquo;t even NEED a national leader. This President loves hispanics   &mdash;   regardless whether legal or illegal   &mdash;   and hispanics love him back. When your Ethnic Grievance Lobby has the President himself in your corner, that&rsquo;s better than a thousand Al Sharptons. </p>

		<p>This could turn out to be our saving grace.  Although the Mexican component of the Hispanic community is the largest, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s big enough to prevent sizable minorities within the minority from upsetting the apple cart.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll turn out like the Democrats.  They&rsquo;re effective when they&rsquo;re the opposition but when they come to power it all goes out the window when they realize they&rsquo;re just a coalition of grievance groups with different ideas on how things should be done.  </p>
<p>When it comes time to take the lead they break down and fight amongst themselves, because the only thing they have in common is hatred of traditional Western civilization.</p>
<p>Same thing will happen with the Hispanics.  When they are forced to really work together they&rsquo;ll be reminded rather quickly how much they actually hate each other.</p>

		<p>The media is actually helping the radical Mexican nationalist groups like La Raza by keeping these groups somewhat off the radar of mainstream white America. </p>
<p>If they let radical Chicano professors and agitators rant about the reconquista on the prime time news programs the popular backlash against Mexican immigration would be even more fervent than it is today.</p>

<p>Yes, and as white folks we shouldn&rsquo;t want Hispanic groups to develop their own leadership.  They have enough &#8216;leaders&rsquo; from within the white community already, people like McCain, Ted Kennedy, the liberal media, most white Democrats and some Repubs, etc., not to mention the current President and his minions.</p>

		<p>They may hate each other now but when the Free White Money dries up, they&rsquo;ll unite immediately and rally against what they perceive to be their greatest enemy  &mdash;  The Great White Bigot who they think stole their land owes them everything.</p>
<p>This was certainly true during the recent shamnesty marches across the Southwest  &mdash;  every aggrieved contingent of hispanics from gays to anarchists to catholic priests (looking for new parishioners to fill the coffers left empty by the pedophile-priest payoffs, 460 million in LA) marched together under one flag  &mdash;  a Red Flag! Most of which were adored with the face of their hero, che. </p>
<p>Remember:  hispanics are taught in American schools, that the US was stolen from the hispanic peoples by genocidal Whites, it belongs to them (including all the White built infrastructure, White wealth and White technology, which they also stupidly believe was stolen from them).</p>
<p>Hispanics know that the US government has its boot on the necks of White Americans and know that we Whites are easily silenced and brought into submission by our own government  &mdash;  as the Americans boys were recently when told they couldn&rsquo;t wear American-flag t-shirts because the sight of an American flag in America might incite a riot, certainly not foreign flags and holidays, which are freely celebrated and honored in American schools </p>
<p>Every day the media print story after story after story of &#8216;discriminated-against hispanics&rsquo; who are only &#8216;here to work&rsquo; and want their &#8216;chance at the American Dream.&rsquo;  If they don&rsquo;t succeed (which they don&rsquo;t) this is blamed completely on White Bigotry and Oppression.</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/243ccno" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/243ccno</a></p>
<p>When the entitlement money dries up, as it is in California, who do you think those marchers will target for violence?</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t be the schools or the media.</p>
<p>And, some of us continually state, this is ALL a part of the real, larger goal  &mdash;  the ongoing War on Whites, engineered by the alien government, the controlled media, and academia.  Hispanics, without the intelligence or foresight to understand their role as the new slave class, are the black-replacement battering ram being used by the alien elite to destroy Whites and Western Civilization.</p>

		<p>These disgusting free loaders shouldn&rsquo;t even be allowed to celebrate any event that is not a part of this country.  By doing what they do they are announcing to the whole world that their loyalty lies with Mexico, not the US.  That&rsquo;s so blatantly obvious only a fool, or a liberal, or a politician, would fail to understand that.  They take their cinco de mayo junk off or get out.  It&rsquo;s a simple proposition even people as dumb as they are could understand.</p>
<p>To leave a country for another, because of a lack of opportunity, mass corruption, overbearing police tactics and out-of-control abuse, then insist on honoring that same country is the action of imbeciles.  By celebrating one of Mexico&rsquo;s so-called holidays, they&rsquo;re showing everybody how stupid they are.</p>
<p>Accept this country or get out.</p>
<p>Or, better yet, get out anyway.  You&rsquo;re not going to be able find work anywhere in about 6 months to a year.  The economy AND the dollar will be in a death spiral, right along with rampant inflation.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a shame if inflation forced them to pay $10 for a loaf of bread and they can&rsquo;t find work, plus the blacks step up their fighting with them?  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s close to what is going to occur. Mark my words.</p>

<p>In that vein, the once-standard racial words have become virtually taboo.  Nowadays we speak of &#8220;Africans&#8221; as if that were a race, when it too refers to nothing but a continent which contains a variety of races. Likewise, the media speak of &#8220;Eastern Europeans&#8221; when they really mean Gypsies, and so forth&hellip; They tiptoe around racial descriptions like poison.</p>

		<p>  &#8220;this is ALL a part of the real, larger goal &mdash; the ongoing War on Whites, engineered by the alien government, the controlled media, and academia. Hispanics, without the intelligence or foresight to understand their role as the new slave class, are the black-replacement battering ram being used by the alien elite to destroy Whites and Western Civilization.&#8221;<br>

<p>I am glad that someone sees the larger picture!  This is by no means just about Hispanics. It has much winder implications.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really rather pathetic   &mdash;   almost laughable   &mdash;   that these militant Hispanic groups think they are achieving something and making progress, when in reality they are slated to be  (as Bon says above)  &#8220;the new slave class.&#8221;    A few of them will be promoted to leadership positions, but the rest will not. They&rsquo;re just dogs squabbling over a bone.</p>
<p>The &#8220;elites&#8221; who run the media, academia, and government have NO INTENTION  of giving up their control over those  key institutions, although they may be willing to concede or share a few highly visible positions as an appeasement to keep the Hispanics happy and under control.</p>

<p><i>Quick: Name a leader of the national Hispanic community.</i></p>
<p>How about Barack Obama? </p>
<p>In other words, with a brown-skinned pro-Amesty socialist in the White House, hispanics don&rsquo;t even NEED a national leader. This President loves hispanics  &mdash;  regardless whether legal or illegal  &mdash;  and hispanics love him back.<br>
 __   __   __   __   __   </p>
<p>Well, how about Dubya Bush?  </p>
<p>Same thing.  Either way.  With a white-skinned, neo-con, capitalist millionaire in the White House, Hispanics didn&rsquo;t need a leader. He LOVED Hispanics!</p>
<p>The only difference is that, with Bush, they didn&rsquo;t love him back.<br>

		<p>To poster #16.  This is so true.  The various groups of latinos do not like each other and do not have a common history.  Just this morning, I heard a group of Dominicans and Ecuadorians insulting the ways and values of puerto ricans, calling them lazy drug addicts who get food stamps.  I&rsquo;ve heard mexicans talking down on all other latinos, and south americans often express a GREAT AMOUNT of disdain for Dominicans.</p>
