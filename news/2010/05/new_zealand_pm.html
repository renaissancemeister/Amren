			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Breitbart, May 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Key [New Zealand Prime Minister John Key] has been at loggerheads with a Maori tribe, the Tuhoe, over negotiations to settle their grievances over land confiscations by European settlers in the 19th century.</p>
<p>During a speech to a tourism conference Thursday, Key joked about having dinner with the neighbouring Ngati Porou tribe, or iwi.</p>
<p>&#8220;The good news is that I was having dinner with Ngati Porou as opposed to their neighbouring iwi which is Tuhoe, in which case I would have been dinner, which wouldn&rsquo;t have been quite so attractive,&#8221; Key said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An MP for the Maori Party, which supports Key&rsquo;s government and has two leaders serving as government ministers, said the joke was unfortunate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well the first thing to say is, it&rsquo;s probably correct, and the second thing is (it&rsquo;s) probably not wise in the current climate,&#8221; said Te Ururoa Flavell.</p>
<p>Cannibalism remains a sensitive subject in New Zealand, where Maori warriors sometimes ate their defeated enemies until the practice died out in the mid-19th century, according to historians.<br>

		<p>Well-that comment,though a true piece of history, certainly caused an uproar here in NZ from those who refuse to acknowledge cannibalism.  However it has been a bit of a joke for years-&#8220;My ancestors ate your ancestors&#8221; sort of thing.I was reminded of a popular song here in 1965.&rsquo;Puha and Pakeha&rsquo;</p>
<p>(explaining-Umu is an earth oven with hot stones on the base.Pakeha is a name for white people.)<br>
You take a little umu and you get it very hot-<br>
You catch a little pakeha and put him in a pot-<br>
Cook him all up in you old home brew-<br>
And what have you got-Kiwi stew.<br>

		<p>This really is a non-issue all around for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1) All human societies at one time in their histories practiced cannibalism.  While some Whites may think themselves superior in this regard, it&rsquo;s worth noting the practice didn&rsquo;t stop among Europeans as far back in time as they like to think.</p>
<p>https://latemiddleages.suite101.com/article.cfm/cannibalism_in_pre_modern_europe</p>
<p>Zoologists have known for many years certain species have inclinations towards cannibalistic behavior (under the right circumstances).  Ours is obviously one of them.</p>
<p>2) Let&rsquo;s be honest here, people.  The joke was in poor taste.  There was simply no reason for it.  We don&rsquo;t need to defend the actions of a boor to prove Whites are cognitively and morally superior to peoples like the Maori.  Decades of IQ test scores and crime statistics do that quite nicely.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10579309&amp;ref=rss" rel="nofollow">https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid;=10579309&ref;=rss</a></p>

<p>3) In all fairness to the Maori, their reaction was quite muted.  Can you imagine how blacks here in the United States would have reacted had a White politician made a similar comment about them?</p>

		<p>Known as &#8220;The custom of the sea&#8221;, whites used to cannibalize their shipmates when a ship ran out of food so that some of the men could make it back home. (This was against the law and rarely talked about though). I believe the practice didn&rsquo;t really die out until the era of iron ships and radio.</p>

<p>Europeans practiced cannibalism because there was a drastic need to. It was not usual and not common. Extreme circumstances required extreme measures.</p>
<p>Among the Maori it was normal and common and usual and A PART OF THE CULTURE, HABITUAL!! They did it because they liked it!!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m from Australia and I can say that the Maori probably aren&rsquo;t that bad; at least in the sense that they possessed an interesting culture that was in many respects well developed despite its extreme isolation. They were exquisite warriors and sailors; perhaps even the Vikings were no match for the Maori. Their average IQ is something like 90, which is respectable by world standards, but they are still extremely violent and dangerous. Like the Aboriginals, alcohol has not helped them at all.</p>

		<p>When one says &#8220;He&rsquo;ll have him for dinner!&#8221; it means that someone will be in trouble with someone else. This is an old English saying so it may not have been a cannibalism joke but was interpreted as one.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s disturbing archaeological evidence the Neanderthals disappeared partly due to the fact they wound up on the dinner menu of our Cro-Magnid ancestors.</p>

<p>If you had read the link I posted (which you apparently didn&rsquo;t) or knew anything at all about the history of European cannibalism, you&rsquo;d know that medicinal cannibalism was WIDELY practiced in many parts of Europe (including England) right up until the 18th century.</p>
<p>The body parts consumed for their alleged healing properties often came from executed criminals.  Apparently the Catholic and Protestant churches didn&rsquo;t have a problem with this gruesome practice, and evidence shows it occurred in all parts of Europe.</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/2fo3zph</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s even one horrific documented case of an angry Dutch mob using cannibalism as a form of impeachment!  </p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/2cyhzqs" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2cyhzqs</a></p>
<p>The conclusion is inescapable: Europeans engaged in cannibalistic behavior up until fairly recent times.  Even to this day, in extremes many will not hesitate to resort to it.</p>

		<p>To say that the Maori outclass Vikings is theoretical, but I have to argue that The Vikings had an upper hand they used armor and didn&rsquo;t use gourds for helmets.</p>
<p>You can argue Vikings excursion to the new world. The Vikings in the end did not flourish in America, but there resources including men was literally an ocean away. If it came down to a war of clan vs. clan everything else irrelevant - Hands down, the Vikings would have taken it. They were not elected into the Byzantine elite guard by fault. </p>

To 8  &mdash;  Anonymous:</p>
<p>You take great liberties with your citations which only go to show how limited cannibalism was in European and only done under extreme conditions.</p>
<p>In your first article about modern humans eating Neanderthals, it clearly states this is one mans controversial theory.</p>
<p>An alternative explanation for the disappearance of the Neanderthals appears in an article on AmRen:</p>
<p>Neanderthal Genes &lsquo;Survive in Us&rsquo;</p>
<p><a href="/news/2010/05/neanderthal_gen.html" rel="nofollow">/news/2010/05/neanderthal_gen.php</a></p>
<p>In the article you post,</p>
<p>Cannibalism: Just What the Doctor Ordered</p>
<p>you claim cannibalism lasted openly from 11th to 18th century when the article makes no such claim and is only speaking to the various incarnations of the Inquisition.</p>
<p>The article does make it clear that under extreme conditions of starvation, cannibalism may have occurred. Nowhere does it make it out to be a wide spread practice.</p>
<p>In the article, </p>
<p>Did a mob of angry Dutch kill and eat their prime minister?</p>
<p>the article is clear that this was an isolated incident and that it was executed by the lowest of the low. Far from being cannibalism (the deliberate consumption of human flesh) this sounds like a case in which some people who had access to the body cut off pieces and sold it to what was very likely unsuspecting customers.</p>
<p>In the last article,</p>
<p>Ukraine marks great famine anniversary</p>
<p>it clearly states, what others have said here, that under extreme conditions, there were incidents of cannibalism in Europe.</p>
<p>You take great liberties in how you interpret what you read.</p>

<p>This allegation of ancient white cannibal cultures is typical communist revisionist history.  </p>

<p>If that is true, then why do we always read of widespread hunger on that continent. Wouldn&rsquo;t they have solved their hunger problem by eating each other?<br>

		<p>In the movie &#8220;District 9&#8221; there is a scene which depicts blacks EXACTLY as they are anywhere in the world. The scene involved the arm of the main WHITE character changing into alien tissue (NOT undocumented tissue:) and the blacks were about to cut the guy&rsquo;s arm off to eat it and thereby get his &#8220;power&#8221;&hellip;Pretty much sums up blacks. A book titled &#8220;Farnhams Freehold&#8221; I read years ago was written around the premise of blacks running the world and cultivating Whites as cattle and food!! entirely plausible and possible!!</p>

		<p>It seems to be common for people of low IQ to take something small and run with it like the anyomous cannibal person. I&rsquo;ve run into them before, most notably on youtube with a very ignorant Canadian of Jamaican heritage who assumed all Whites were cannibals on less info than was linked.</p>
<p>But then tellingly, she went on to argue with me that Egypt was black and whites stole their history. I ended up silencing her with a link to a site that was unfortunately brought down a year ago, which detailed that the notion of an ancient Black Egypt was a fantasy. However a few days later she came back to say that everything on there was a fabrication. At that point after three days of arguing I just stopped responding to her because I came to the conclusion that she was mentally unbalanced. </p>
<p>But for all I know that woman is the same person posting this white cannibalism thing.</p>
