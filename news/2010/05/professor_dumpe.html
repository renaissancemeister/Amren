<h1><a href="https://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_OIL_SPILL_PROFESSOR?SITE=FLTAM&amp;SECTION=US">Professor Dumped From Oil Spill Team Over Writings</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jim Salter, Tampa Bay Online, May 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A St. Louis scientist who was among a select group picked by the Obama administration to pursue a solution to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has been removed from the group because of writings on his website, the U.S. Energy Department confirmed Wednesday.</p>
<p>Washington University physics professor Jonathan Katz was one of five top scientists chosen by the Department of Energy and attended meetings in Houston last week.</p>
<p>Though considered a leading scientist, Katz&rsquo;s website postings often touch on social issues. Some of those writings have stirred anger in the past and include postings defending homophobia and questioning the value of racial diversity efforts.</p>
<p>Energy Secretary Steven Chu was not aware of Katz&rsquo;s writings before selecting him for the panel, spokeswoman Stephanie Mueller said. It was not immediately clear how the department became aware of the writings.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In another posting, Katz questioned the value of diversity efforts.</p>
<p>&#8220;The diversity movement is racist at its core,&#8221; he writes. &#8220;When dealing with people we should be concerned with intellect, talent, character and accomplishment. People aren&rsquo;t dogs or cattle; race matters only to racists.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m wondering why the leftists thinks that these totally unrelated opines of Dr. Katz means that he&rsquo;s not qualified to help clean up an oil spill in an ocean.  </p>
<p>The Energy Dept was tipped off by St. Louis&rsquo;s lefty tabloid, the Riverfront Times.  Its offices are very near Wash.U., and it is my understanding that the RFT and Wash.U. are so closely linked that you sometimes can&rsquo;t tell where one ends and the other begins.  It&rsquo;s obvious that one of Dr. Katz&rsquo;s enemies (and in what we St. Louisans affectionately call the Little Red School House, he has many) texted an RFT reporter.</p>

		<p>So, simply for having a differing opinion and posting his thoughts about his views on his OWN website, he gets fired from a position that has absolutely nothing to do with what he writes about? Talk about an unfair dismissal. </p>
<p>&#8220;The diversity movement is racist at its core,&#8221; he writes. &#8220;When dealing with people we should be concerned with intellect, talent, character and accomplishment. People aren&rsquo;t dogs or cattle; race matters only to racists.&#8221; </p>
<p>Wow, no true liberal could have said it any better. Race only matters to racists, and since blacks always whine about race they must be racist. Me thinks they lost a very down to earth, logical, well meaning scientist. Their loss. </p>

<p>  For this statement Dr. Katz was dismissed from his scientific position with the government? Is this an example of &#8220;hate speech&#8221;? Does our government want competent scientists or politically correct zombies?   </p>

		<p>Madness! Prof. Katz might have been the one to find the best or quickest solution, but now precious wildlife might die all because diversity is more important than ability. I wonder what environmentalists make of this?</p>

		<p>Those other scientists should all refuse to attend the panel until Dr. Katz is reinstated. At least, that is what they would do if they have any moral fibre.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not holding my breath.  The Great God of Diversity is a dangerous deity to mess with.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s Obama all the way.  Politically correct opinions matter far more to Obama than competence.  Look at his choice of judges, for example.  By the way, the new health care bill mandates affirmative action for doctors, so you have an excellent and rational reason to avoid black doctors at all costs.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Dr. Chu has spoken with dozens of scientists and engineers as part of his work to help find solutions to stop the oil spill,&#8221; a statement from the Energy Department said. &#8220;Some of Professor Katz S controversial writings have become a distraction from the critical work of addressing the oil spill. Professor Katz will no longer be involved in the Department&rsquo;s efforts&#8221;.</p>
<p>The &#8216;distraction&rsquo; is created by those who wanted to fire Katz, no one else. It&rsquo;s a bit disingenuous to blame an outside source. Senator Joseph McCarthy, who I personally admire, couldn&rsquo;t get out and out communists fired, yet the professor is removed from his post for merely saying something that is anti-racist. That&rsquo;s a no-no. Imagine if he had said something anti-racist in defense of whites?</p>

<p>Leave this device of unfair abuse in place&hellip;.so that when we are able, we will do the same damn thing to those &#8220;politically correct&#8221; liberals.

		<p>He does not beleive in global warming eighter.<br>
(so it seems that gay rights are more important than global warming):</p>
<p>Who is stoking the alarm about global warming? There is Al Gore, an over-the-hill politician who wants to remain in the public eye. His house uses 20 times as much electricity as the average American house and he flies private jets. Obviously, he does not believe what he preaches; it must be an act. Conservation is for the little people. I&rsquo;ll think about reducing my emissions after he reduces his by 95%. Then there is Jim Hansen, would-be dictator who wants to throw in jail anyone who disagrees with him or burns coal. He may wish himself another Mussolini (or worse), but people just laugh at him. And finally John Holdren, who in his younger days was prophesying disaster from the ice age then just beginning (so he said). Fictitious crises are a demogogue&rsquo;s route to power. </p>
<p>Some of the more apocalyptic fears about global warming resemble a secular doomsday cult. Rather than God dooming mankind for its traditional sins (robbery, lust, murder, disbelief, etc.), Nature is said to doom mankind for the secular sin of carbon emission. Some (Greenpeace, and even more radical groups) think any human effect on nature to be sinful, and regard &#8220;Mother Earth&#8221; as a deity that is violated by any use of its resources for the sustenance, comfort or betterment of Mankind. Needless to say, this is opposite to the Biblical grant of the natural world to Man for his benefit. </p>
<p>Predictions of climate doom are no more rational than traditional religous predictions of a Day of Judgement or Armageddon. Divine revelation is not open to rational argument, and its truth can only be judged by further revelation.</p>

		<p>Katz isn&rsquo;t much of a scientist if he doesn&rsquo;t believe in race, though he could definitely be described as a classical liberal.</p>
<p>There is a proven genetic difference between the races, and even if it hadn&rsquo;t been - anyone can look around them and see it.  There&rsquo;s a reason why asian and white countries are the only first world nations.  As the famous saying goes, &#8220;Who are you going to believe, me or your lying eyes?&#8221;</p>
