<h1>Man Takes Life Sentence for Eve Carson Slaying</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Times News (Burlington, North Carolina), May 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A man accused in the shooting death of a University of North Carolina student body president pleaded guilty Monday to murder and other state charges, avoiding a trial and the possibility of a death sentence.</p>
<p>Demario Atwater of Durham pleaded guilty at a hearing in Hillsborough to first-degree murder, armed robbery, kidnapping and other charges in the death of Eve Carson. In a plea agreement with prosecutors, Atwater agreed to life in prison without parole on the murder charge.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Atwater had already pleaded guilty in April to several federal charges, including carjacking resulting in death and kidnapping. He is to be sentenced in federal court Sept. 23. His agreement with prosecutors is for a life sentence.</p>
<p>Carson was found shot to death in a Chapel Hill neighborhood in March 2008, nearly a mile from campus. Carson&rsquo;s parents and brother attended the hearing and issued a statement through Raleigh attorney Wade Smith.</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;d suspect that he will become a Civil Rights Martyr because he fought against the injustice of White Privilege and won, but the Racist White Legal System incarcerated him in violation of his human rights and his rightful chance to vote and procreate.</p>
<p>But they won&rsquo;t hold him up as a hero, but as a bad example. &#8220;If you are gonna do right, don&rsquo;t kill the White girl, just rape her and force her to be &#8216;yo baby momma so you can help eliminate persistant racism through misgegnating and making more truly amerikan mulatto mix race obamabaies.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Blacks who miss their opportunity to impregnate White girls will not be help up to esteem and glory as will those who &#8220;do the right thing&#8221; and force White girls  into mix raced motherhood.</p>

		<p>Now let me think, wasn&rsquo;t she the one that ran as class president, or something like that, on the platform of RECRUTING MORE NON-WHITES INTO HER SCHOOL?!  Hmmm.  </p>

		<p>This was discussed in a local paper. I asked why the prosecution would plea bargain and someone said both Eve and her parents were against the death penalty.</p>
<p>That did not make sense as how many parents of murder victims WANT the death penalty yet don&rsquo;t get it?</p>

		<p>Eventually the death penalty will be taken off the table for any black on white murder.  State prosecutors are relieved when they are able to arrange a plea deal that will spare murdering blacks from what they richly deserve. I won&rsquo;t waste the keystrokes decrying the unfairness of it all but we on this site know that the only people that get the death penalty for anything nowadays are poor white men.  The state can feel good about sending a poor white to the death chamber and not have to defend the absurd arguments of black racists and black worshipping leftists.</p>

		<p>.Atwater and his juvie crime partner Lawrence Lovette are just two more misunderstood black males who rob and murder because they have been discriminated against. Who can blame them? (sacrasm)</p>
<p> They would rather rob and kill, than even find a way to get into college as this young woman had. They discarded her body on the street like garbage. That is a real shame. Just my thoughts, you be the judge&hellip;&hellip; </p>

		<p>Increasing the population of blacks will lead to an increase in violent crime.</p>
<p>Eve Carson supported the very policies that got her killed.</p>
<p>She was ill advised to do so.</p>

<p>Typical White Girl. Doesn&rsquo;t know a thing about Diversity, and then when she meets the real thing&hellip; </p>
<p>She was in favor of diversity, and she gets murdered by two black men, and it is her fault?  </p>
<p>While there might be just a little bit truth to your statement, I find it moderately ridiculous&hellip;. you are almost indicating that the murderers did not do anything wrong, and it is totally her fault that she was murdered.   </p>
<p>Regardless of the context, murder or any type of sexual crime is never, ever the victim&rsquo;s fault.  It might influence how harsh the punishment will be on the perpetrator, but sexual crime, or murder, is never ever the victim&rsquo;s fault. </p>
<p>I lay all the blame on the criminals.  </p>
<p>I searched a fair bit around the internet and saw that she had a white boyfriend. </p>
