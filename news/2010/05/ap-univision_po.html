<h1>AP-Univision Poll: Immigration Splits Americans</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alan Fram, Yahoo! News, May 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Illegal immigrants are a boon, not a burden to the country, a resounding majority of Hispanics say, according to an Associated Press-Univision Poll that underscores sharp contrasts between the views of Hispanics and others. Most non-Hispanics say illegal immigrants are a drain on society.</p>
<p>In addition, most Hispanics condemn Arizona&rsquo;s strict new law targeting undocumented immigrants, while only 20 percent of non-Hispanics oppose it.</p>
<p>The survey also found some remarkably similar views between Hispanics and non-Hispanics on the complex, emotional issue of immigration, which has gained prominence this election year. About two-thirds of both groups consider illegal immigration a serious problem, only a quarter of each think the Arizona law will ease the state&rsquo;s troubles and the largest portion of both populations think current limits on legal immigration should be left alone.</p>
<p>Even so, much of the poll  &mdash;  which questioned 901 Hispanic adults and was compared to a separate survey of the general population  &mdash;  reads as if soundings were taken of two distinct worlds, an impression fortified by follow-up interviews.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the poll, 74 percent of Hispanics said the country&rsquo;s estimated 12 million illegal immigrants mostly contribute to society. Just 35 percent of non-Hispanics agreed, with 60 percent saying illegal immigrants are largely a drain.</p>
<p>Some 67 percent of Hispanics said they oppose the Arizona statute. Just 20 percent of non-Hispanics oppose it, with 45 percent favoring it and 30 percent neutral. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Underlining the divergent reactions to the Arizona law, seven in 10 Hispanics hope their states don&rsquo;t enact similar statutes, more than double the non-Hispanics who feel that way.</p>
<p>Nearly nine in 10 Hispanics said a way should be found to help illegal immigrants already in this country become citizens, an idea that wins support from just over half of non-Hispanics. Some 62 percent of non-Hispanics  &mdash;  compared with just 24 percent of Hispanics  &mdash;  think being in the U.S. illegally should be considered a serious crime.</p>
<p>By 73 percent to 46 percent, more Hispanics than others said police crackdowns on illegal immigrants are likely to target Hispanics unfairly. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While both groups agree that illegal immigration is a serious problem, 83 percent of non-Hispanics think the federal government should be doing more about it, while 52 percent of Hispanics voice that view.</p>
<p>Hispanics trust Democrats more than Republicans to handle immigration, while it&rsquo;s the other way around for non-Hispanics. Still, only 45 percent of Hispanics approve of how President Barack Obama is dealing with the issue  &mdash;  one of the few national issues where they rate his performance relatively poorly.</p>
<p>In other findings:</p>
<p>o Almost nine in 10 Hispanics say illegal immigrants take jobs Americans don&rsquo;t want, compared with six in 10 non-Hispanics.</p>
<p>o More than a quarter of Hispanics say they would not have had documentation proving their status had they been stopped by police the day they answered the poll, about double the rate for non-Hispanics.</p>
<p>o Most Hispanics say only the federal government should enforce immigration laws, while a majority of non-Hispanics want local police involved.</p>

		<p>Well, this is no surprise.  Hispanics always stick together - you never want to get one in a fight, because the first thing they do is pull a knife and the second thing that happens is all their friends come over to back their person up.  So OF COURSE the Hispanics are going to support their illegal brethren.  We gotta find a way to get our laws enforced whether Hispanics like it or not.</p>

		<p>&#8220;74 percent of Hispanics think illegal immigrants are good for America.&#8221;</p>
<p>But ONLY if they are mestizos.</p>
<p>If illegal immigrants were Eastern Europeans, Mestizos would demand that the border be closed off immediately.</p>
<p>Everything with Hispanics and blacks is about race.  They want to see their tribal kin dominating everything in the US.  And what a shame it is, because there are no Hispanic or black run countries that aren&rsquo;t failures, because the populace is of such low caliber they can&rsquo;t succeed on a first world basis.</p>
<p>But, make no mistake.  Their arrogance will not allow them to understand that their countries fail which is why they&rsquo;re here in the first place. Blacks would have left years ago and inundated Africa if blacks there had the ability to succeed.</p>
<p>White leaders are too cowardly to declare that every expressed non-white desire is just an example of racism.  They want to live ONLY among their own kind.</p>

<p>In other news, a &#8220;resounding majority&#8221; of those polled were illegal aliens.  Who cares what they think?  This &#8220;information&#8221; is useless.</p>

		<p>L.A. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said yesterday that illegal aliens help a state&rsquo;s and city&rsquo;s economy.  Strangely, he does not seem to want to welcome what will surely be an exodus of those economy-helping illegal aliens out of Arizona and into Los Angeles, even though, according to him, it would hurt Arizona and help Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Mayor, I ask of thee:  If illegals help a city and state, just where did L.A. and CA go wrong?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Immigration Splits Americans&#8221; - I would take issue with the title of the article.  It is accurate only in that they are defining &#8220;Americans&#8221; as anyone currently within the U.S. borders.  If you take out the Illegals and those anti-White, anti-Black, pro-Mexican, American-in-name-only citizens, I would then agree that the remaining population is comprised of true Americans.  With only true Americans as the polling population, we would not then have the case of seeing two different polls seemingly coming from &#8220;two distinct worlds&#8221;.  There would be differences, but not on the scale shown in this article. As it is, yes, they are polling two distinct worlds.  They are entho-centric worlds in conflict over race, language and culture, where the victor will control the Southwestern U.S.  The Arizona immigration law has just pushed the conflict into the main stream news.</p>

		<p>The usual propaganda from the civic nationalist Right is that &#8220;legal&#8221; Hispanics assimilate and oppose illegal immigration. This poll seems to contradict that claim, and I&rsquo;d also be curious to know if these invisible pro-American Hispanic immigrants are of European or Amerindian extraction. </p>

		<p>The results of this survey are misinterpreted.  Hispanics do not think illegal immigration is good for America.  They think it is good for themselves.  What is the slogan of La Raza?  &#8220;For the race, everything, for others, nothing&#8221;.  </p>
<p>The mestizo wants to replace the White man, not live along side him.  And White marxists are happy to oblige, as long as they think they&rsquo;ll be able to rule over the brown rabble.  Maybe Amreners should take up a collection and send White marxists to South African summer camp so they can get a glimpse of their real future.  I think the only people more oblivious to what life would be like under mestizo rule are blacks.  </p>
<p>Americans are White.  The fact that too many Whites no longer realize this is why things are the way they are in America.</p>

		<p>You got THAT right, QD #4!!  Villaraigoso is nothing but a small philandering egotist with visions of grandeur; it&rsquo;s no secret that he&rsquo;s trying to get into position to run for governor one of these days, and from there to be the first Hispanic President.  God forbid   &mdash;   this man is pro-Hispanic in everything including illegal aliens, and blacks and whites alike have no use for him.  My hope is that he go to a Hispanic country to live, never to be seen or heard in CA again&hellip;.</p>

		<p>A univision poll found this.  For those unaware Univision is the heavyweight in Latin American news. More or less a latin CBS. Galavision is thier smaller sister. By the way,, univision is owned by Carlos Slim,, the guy rich as Gates and Buffet, and he may own Gala also, not sure. I speak spanish and watch the news all the time in spanish. The liberal tilt at least toward illegal immigration is alive and well on these channels. They are very pro Raza and pro unstopped illegal immigration, which can easily influence the minds of the simple poor indian types watching. Completley upset at the Arizona law, they are pro marches and demostrations ect. From a Univision poll, probably all polled are spanish speaking,, what other results could they get???  Kingfish </p>

		<p>I think that an area which has long been neglected-deliberately or not-is the <i>race</i> of the early Spanish settlers in what is now the United States. As opposed to the nationality, which was Spanish or Mexican.</p>
<p>If you look at contemporary paintings from the early 1800&rsquo;s,men involved in the Texas War of Independence were almost uniformly white. Jose Antonio Navarro,comes to mind,as do a few others. Yes,they grew up speaking Spanish,they were Catholic,and all that other good stuff. But they were <i>white</i>. I strongly suspect that the situation in New Mexico, Arizona, and California was similar-when the Yanquis arrived,the civilization already extant was very possibly under the charge of white men who happened to speak Spanish. Not the mestizos and Indios that we&rsquo;re used to seeing today.</p>
<p>And based on my very limited knowledge of Mexican history, these white men in charge weren&rsquo;t even faintly interested in turning over their power,the infrastructure they built,and their daughters to the darker skinned underclass.</p>

<p>Well, there is a real vote of confidence in the &ldquo;authority&rdquo; of the federal government!</p>
<p>Laughably, this should be a tip-off to our federal overlords, as to just what a threat these invaders are to their continued existence. When you are neither feared or respected by any group, you are vulnerable. Here it would appear that both the taxpayers and the &ldquo;undocumented&rdquo; diversity dispensers, see them as not being able or willing to enforce anything in regard to either border or internal security. </p>
<p>Way to go Uncle Sucker!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m reminded of the 1965 debate of the immigration law change that led to the current situation. Here are some quotes:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/355rdjw" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/355rdjw</a></p>
<p>Notice these are not extremist people but leaders of the Democratic party including the Kennedys. Clearly the national discourse has changed because these statements would not be tolerated today. It would be a good idea to review why the democrat leaders said what they did. They had concerns about bad immigration and were reassuring the American public that proper controls would be enforced. What has happened since then?</p>

		<p>#12 as usual Mr. Fallon is very insightful. And even as early as 99 all that was said would not happen in the 60&rsquo;s had already happened. And now 11 years later it is tenfold at the least. Now, what with our current leadership, the ship of state &#8220;THE HMS Obama,&#8221; has sunken to depths beyond raising and must be scuttled and a new ship of state put in it&rsquo;s place, by what ever means nessessary. Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead, don&rsquo;t fire till you see the whites of their eyes! Give me liberty or give me death. I only regret I have but one life to give for my country. How many modern day college educated idiots have a clue as to where these sayings came from? None I bet! Yet they would all believe their freedom was handed to them on a golden platter without their lifting a finger, and sadly that is true, but the platter is covered in the blood of the patriots who bled and died so they who earned nothing could mock them, they are truly slime one and all!!</p>

<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m so sick of hearing this nonsense. How do people know this, who did these jobs before these Mexicans came? Americans, that&rsquo;s who. It&rsquo;s not that Americans don&rsquo;t want these jobs, it&rsquo;s just the employers want slave labor and Americans can&rsquo;t afford to work for slave wages.<br>

		<p>Well I am glad the likes of Sean Hannity keep insisting that the majority of hispanics are against illegal immigration.  I am really starting to get sick and tired of &#8220;right-winged&#8221; talk radio.  Sometimes I think that liberals are more honest about racial differences than these clowns.  At least liberals admit, under the surface, that minorities don&rsquo;t perform as well as whites by constantly declaring them &#8220;victim&#8221; status, in the sense that they supposedly need our help with everything.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, these American Flag waving, Lee Greenwood worshipping, &#8220;we are all Americans&#8221; chanting, right wing talk radio champions, always seem to insist that &#8220;there is no difference between the different races in America&#8221;.  They constantly cheerlead Bush&rsquo;s &#8220;No Child Left Behind&#8221; program as &#8220;evidence&#8221; for minorities doing as well as whites in schools.  </p>
<p>Instead of basing what they say on actual statistics, I notice that they like to make guesses and speculations like &#8220;I can assure you that most mainstream hispanics are good Americans and they are against illegal immigration&#8221;.</p>
<p>Either that, or they make generalizations based on exceptions to the rule. A handful of blacks show up at a Tea Party rally, and then they insist that &#8220;see&hellip;&hellip;blacks care about this country just as much as whites&#8221;. </p>
<p>I remember when the community of blacks in California voted largely against homosexual marriage, and how for days Micheal S. ( I can&rsquo;t say his last name on here because the filters won&rsquo;t let it through), went on and on harping about how &#8220;blacks, unlike whites, actually think before they vote&#8221;.  Is he really that clueless? I almost threw something at the radio!</p>
<p>I am finally noticing Limbaugh and M.S. getting a little more to the point and less PC in how they talk.  As for Hannity, I don&rsquo;t know.  I gave up on his show a long time ago.  I hope his show continues to lose listerners, just as the Republicans will continue to lose voters until they stop living in their fantasy world that Republican government can exist in the midst of diversity.</p>
<p>Let the Liberals use diversity to justify their stance.  For them it makes sense.  For Republicans it will never make sense.  They need to wake up and start realizing that their values will never make it anywhere until they start basing their platform on the interests of white Americans and only white Americans.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago in my town mostly whites cut lawns.  It was a field comprised mostly of white owned small business.  Now it&rsquo;s 95% Mexican.  There were no Mexicans here 20 years ago.</p>
<p>One of these small business owners was a special school kid from my neighborhood.  Low IQ but he could work hard.  He had a business cutting lawns that made him $35k a year. These are some of the people that are losing their ability to be free and live off the dole and prosper.</p>

		<p>Of course, Latinos believe illegal immigration poses good for this country. What else would one expect?</p>
<p>THINKING people see beyond the liberal hype and see illegals for the parasites they really are&hellip; hanging onto our welfare infrastructure for dear life. Being supported largely by our tax dollars which make up the difference between the illegal immigrants&rsquo; EARNING POWER versus what they need to actually live on. With crimes of opportunity going a long way to help &#8220;improve&#8221; the lifestyle of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Any law enforcement official can support and substantiate my above claim about how prevalent crime is among illegal immigrants.</p>

		<p>ive always thought this to be the case, i dont know why everyone always says &#8220;yknow, the majority of hispanics are actually AGAINST illegal immigration, because it is an insult to those who came over legally.&#8221;.. yea right. so why is it that every hispanic legal or not that i have met has been completely for illegal immigration everytime ive spoken to them. the whole idea of &#8220;most hispanics are against illegal immigration&#8221; just sounds like another tired old lie. people always look out for their kind its just the natural order of things. &hellip; except with whites. weve had our sense of unity guilted out of us long ago. </p>

		<p>Roy Beck and his organization keeps pushing the bold-faced lie that hispanics are ardent immigration restrictionists. For numbersusa.com, NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS have no legitimate racial interests. Only hispanics,blacks and asians have legitmate racial interests worth protecting. This is why numbersusa.com bases immigration reform on how immigration supposedly harms post-1965 hispanics,blacks and asians.</p>
<p>White Americans should not send a single penny to numbersusa.com.</p>
