<p>The integration of American schools is almost always presented as a glorious march to justice, with hallowed beginnings in the 1954 Supreme Court decision of <cite>Brown v. Board of Education.</cite> <cite>Race and Education,</cite> by University of Delaware history professor Raymond Wolters, is a refreshingly clear-eyed account at what is better described as a mix of deceit and judicial arrogance, seasoned with naive idealism. Prof. Wolters explains the tortured reasoning of the most important school-integration decisions, and describes the staggering consequences they had on the lives of real Americans. His conclusion? &#8220;[D]esegregation was problematical from the start, and integration has been a failure.&#8221; This is an exhaustively researched, deeply thoughtful analysis of a historical process that is often described only in clich√©s.</p></p>
<p>An immense amount has been written about the <cite>Brown</cite> decision, and its unsavory background has gradually come to light. It is clear that Earl Warren and several other justices wanted to end segregation in schools and were determined to do it with or without legal justification. They naturally preferred to appear to be Constitutional scholars rather than legislators so they put out a request for a study of the 14th Amendment&rsquo;s equal protection clause that could justify a finding that segregated schools were unconstitutional.</p>

</div><p>Liberal historians worked hard but could find no evidence that the framers of the Amendment ever thought it would require desegregation. In fact, the Congress that passed the Amendment established segregated schools in the District of Columbia, clearly expressing its view that equal protection did not require mixed-race schools. Historians twisted their research as best they could to make it look otherwise. Constitutional scholar Alfred H. Kelly later admitted he had &#8220;manipulated history&#8221; and &#8220;doctored all the evidence&#8221; so as to give the Justices grounds for a reasonable-sounding decision.</p>
<p>It was not enough. Even with doctored evidence there was no Constitutional basis for the Justices&rsquo; ambitions, so they skipped the Constitution entirely and based their ruling on social science (see <a href="/ar/2004/07/index.html#cover" target="BrownvBoard" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>&#8220;Brown v. Board: the <em>Real</em> Story,&#8221;</b></a> AR, July 2004). This &#8220;science&#8221; was mainly black sociologist Kenneth Clark&rsquo;s notorious doll studies.</p>
<p>Clark claimed that when black students in segregated schools were shown two dolls  &mdash;  one black, the other white  &mdash;  and asked which one they liked better, a substantial number chose the white doll. He claimed this meant segregation instilled feelings of inferiority. What he failed to say  &mdash;  but what was known to the lawyers arguing the case for segregation  &mdash;  was that his own research contradicted that claim. He had run the same experiment with children in integrated schools in Massachusetts and had found that <em>even more</em> of them preferred the white doll. If his research showed anything about feelings of inferiority, it was that integration made them worse. His evidence before the Supreme Court was deceitful.</p>
<p>Wesley Critz George reduced the NAACP lawyer to tears when he testified about brain differences between blacks and whites.</p>

</table><p>The main lawyer arguing the case for segregation, John&nbsp;W. Davis, knew this. However, he believed the Supreme Court of the United States of America would never stoop so low as to base a ruling on whether a practice made people feel bad rather than on whether it was Constitutional. He did not even bother to reply to the doll study, noting, &#8220;I can only say that if that sort of &#8216;fluff&rsquo; can move any court, &#8216;God save the state.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fluff&#8221; prevailed. The justices struck down segregation because they found that it &#8220;generates a feeling of inferiority as to their [blacks&rsquo;] status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone.&#8221; Even the <cite>New York Times</cite> recognized the decision as a con job. Its sub-headline in the article announcing <cite>Brown</cite> read: &#8220;A Sociological Decision: Court Founded Its Segregation Ruling On Hearts and Minds Rather Than Laws.&#8221;</p>
<p>The decision caught the segregationists completely by surprise. Like Davis, they thought the court cared about the law, not &#8220;hearts and minds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prof. Wolters notes the importance, however, of what the <cite>Brown</cite> court did <em>not</em> do. It required only that schools stop separating the races, and did not require that they force them together. And, indeed, the initial consequences of <cite>Brown</cite> were anti-climactic: a few ambitious black students transferred to formerly all-white schools, whereas no whites transferred to all-black schools. That was desegregation, or the end of official racial separation. Hardly anyone promoted integration, or forcible mixing, even though it would come with surprising speed.</p>
<p>Prof. Wolters finds it significant that shortly after <cite>Brown,</cite> the Supreme Court handed down a series of brief decisions forbidding segregation of public swimming pools, tennis courts, golf courses, etc. It did not give any reason for these rulings, noting only that they were rendered &#8220;in light of <cite>Brown.</cite>&#8221; These rulings meant no one was to be excluded from such facilities because of race, but cities were not obliged to cart people around town to make sure swimming pools were &#8220;integrated&#8221; rather than merely &#8220;desegregated.&#8221;</p>

</div><p>Prof. Wolters points out that during the late 1950s and early 1960s Americans had a traditional view of the role of schools. They took it for granted that children varied in ability and that it was logical to group them on that basis. They also took it for granted that the job of the schools was to teach academic subjects, not to instill self-esteem or promote &#8220;diversity.&#8221; When the Soviets beat us into space by orbiting <cite>Sputnik</cite> in 1957, it only encouraged the traditional view that school should be rigorous and science-oriented.</p>
<p>It was common even to complain that schools were not challenging the very best students; hardly anyone complained that they were neglecting the &#8220;downtrodden.&#8221; It was a time when James Conant, president of Harvard, scoffed at what he called &#8220;the dogma one often hears: that all the youth, irrespective of academic ability and interest, should complete grade twelve.&#8221; Only a few fanatics thought it was the job of the schools to mix the races.</p>
<p>It was in the 1960s that fashions changed. Americans put men on the moon (thereby proving we had caught up with the Soviets), blacks rioted, and people began to think schools should compensate for &#8220;disadvantage.&#8221; Schools were to become laboratories for liberalism as much as they were places of learning.</p>
<p>Absent from most histories is any but the most superficial and hostile treatment of the resistance to desegregation. <cite>Race and Education</cite> not only covers many neglected incidents in detail, it even notes that segregationist predictions were often correct.</p>
<p>On the legal front, the high-water mark of resistance was the now largely forgotten 1963 case of <cite>Stell v. Savannah.</cite> Dismayed that the <cite>Brown</cite> Court had based a decision on social science rather than law  &mdash;  and miserable social science at that  &mdash;  the segregationists decided to counter with social science of their own. They found a sympathetic South Carolina trial judge, Frank Scarlett, and sued to keep public schools separate. Prof. Wolters tells the story well.</p>

</table><p>The NAACP, which had lobbied the Supreme Court to admit sociological studies now took the opposite stance, insisting that science was irrelevant and that the legal precedent of <cite>Brown</cite> was all that mattered. Judge Scarlett, however, let an all-star lineup of race-realist scholars testify about everything from Kenneth Clark&rsquo;s slanted doll studies to racial differences in IQ to reasons why whites and blacks were better off in separate schools. They predicted what actually happened: that blacks would not do better academically just because they went to white schools, that they would self-segregate just as they did in the North, and that there would be serious discipline problems. Full-scale integration, they predicted, would &#8220;ruin the white schools.&#8221; Professor Wolters writes that Wesley Critz George, emeritus professor of anatomy at the University of North Carolina medical school, reduced the NAACP lawyer Constance Motley to tears when he testified about mental differences between blacks and whites.</p>
<p>The NAACP did not even try to refute this evidence; it called no witnesses. Judge Scarlett duly ruled in favor of maintaining segregated schools but his decision was overturned. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals wrote that the lower court&rsquo;s job was to enforce desegregation as ordered by the Supreme Court, and that &#8220;no inferior court may refrain from acting as required .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. even if such a court should conclude that the Supreme Court erred.&#8221; Legally, it was the end of the road for segregated public education.</p>
<p>The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed just one year after the <cite>Stell</cite> case. Its provisions about employment and public accommodation are well known, but its provisions about schools are often overlooked. Prof. Wolters points out that the law ordered the attorney general to enforce desegregation of schools, but did not require integration: &#8220;&#8216;desegregation,&rsquo;&#8221; according to the law, &#8220;shall not mean the assignment of students to public schools in order to overcome racial imbalance.&#8221; This was in accordance with the general understanding of <cite>Brown.</cite></p>
<p>One of the most astonishing acts of judicial activism during this period was the 1967 case of <cite>Hobson v. Hanson,</cite> in which the famously liberal judge J. Skelly Wright found ability tracking itself to be unconstitutional. In a breath-taking ruling that fortunately did not affect any jurisdiction beyond the District of Columbia, he ruled that tests and grading themselves were culturally biased and &#8220;wholly inappropriate for making predictions about the academic potential of disadvantaged Negro children.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prof. Wolters points out that the end of ability grouping drove even the remaining middle-class blacks out of the DC system and concludes that Judge Wright single-handedly &#8220;destroyed an educational system that had been working reasonably well.&#8221; Wright was later honored with an endowed chair in his name at Yale Law School.</p>
<p>The decline in DC schools that followed was only made worse by a string of superintendants like Barbara Sizemore who threw out standardized tests and decided that students themselves should decide what they would study. Teachers would offer only &#8220;guidance.&#8221; By then, the tests were suspect in some circles because no district in the country could figure out how to get blacks to do as well on them as whites. Thus was born the enduring belief among liberals that this proved the tests were defective.</p>
<p><b>On to integration</b></p>
<p>During the 1960s, many education and civil rights bureaucrats decided that mere desegregation was not good enough because it did not produce wide-spread mixing. Despite the clear language of the Civil Rights Act and the accepted understanding of <cite>Brown,</cite> they worked diligently  &mdash;  but quietly  &mdash;  to push blacks and whites into the same schools. &#8220;Although the civil rights bureaucrats had a fundamental disagreement with the law they purported to enforce,&#8221; writes Prof. Wolters, &#8220;they were careful to avoid a candid discussion of their ideas.&#8221;</p>

</table><p>With the 1968 case of <cite>Green v. New Kent County,</cite> the Supreme Court handed the zealots exactly what they wanted. Prof. Wolters dryly points out the absurdities of the case that officially plunged the country into aggressive integration. New Kent County, Virginia, had two small school systems, one that served about 740 blacks and another that served about 560 whites. When the desegregation order came down, New Kent County stopped separating students by race and let them choose their schools. By 1967, 115 black children had gone to the white school and no whites had gone to the black school. There was no sign that any of the desegregated black children had been mistreated in any way.</p>
<p>The NAACP&rsquo;s head lawyer, Jack Greenburg, told the court that although there <em>appeared</em> to be freedom of choice in New Kent County, it was as illusion. He insisted that most blacks avoided the white school only because they sensed whites did not want them there. Greenburg did not even consider the possibility that blacks could be proud of their school or prefer to study with other blacks.</p>
<p>Earl Warren seems to have been ever the sucker for bogus social theorizing. In his decision he wrote that the school system and its appearance of choice were &#8220;booby trapped&#8221; by &#8220;social and cultural influences that have existed for centuries there.&#8221; As an antidote to those benighted centuries, the school had to assign students by race and make sure they mixed. Warren, goaded on by Greenburg, clearly had the instincts of a Stalin. What people did when they had a choice was not a real choice unless he approved of their choice. Astonishingly, when it made this fateful ruling, the unanimous Court claimed merely to be enforcing the rules laid out in <cite>Brown</cite> 14 year earlier. As Prof. Wolters puts it, the justices &#8220;made a momentous wrong turn.&#8221;</p>
<p>Initially, the Supreme Court had limited its orders to school systems that practiced legal segregation. The <cite>Green</cite> decision laid the foundation for later decisions that spread forcible integration to the entire country, even to those areas where there had always been school choice but where neighborhood segregation led to generally segregated schools. Prof. Wolters deftly summarizes these decisions, as well as those of the 1990s and early 2000s that finally brought the Court back close to the original desegregationist thinking of <cite>Brown. </cite></p>
<p>One of the most famous names associated with 1960s school integration is James&nbsp;S. Coleman, a professor of education at Johns Hopkins, and author of the famous 1966 paper known as &#8220;The Coleman Report.&#8221; He surprised liberals by finding that money alone did not seem to improve school performance. What mattered were parent involvement and a school atmosphere that reflected what were essentially white, middle-class values. He then reassured the liberals by explaining that if blacks were exposed to values of this kind they would pick up good habits and improve their grades while white children would be unaffected. Schools would take the place of the black family in shaping students&rsquo; minds. Coleman was so influential that he became known as &#8220;the scholar who inspired busing.&#8221;</p>

</table><p><p>Nine years later, in 1975, a sadder but wiser Coleman released a second report. He confessed that integration was &#8220;much more complicated than any of us ever realized,&#8221; and was honest enough to report what really happened. First, when blacks showed up, whites cleared out. On balance, he found that a five percent increase in the number of black students lead to a 10 percent drop in white enrollment  &mdash;  Coleman called this &#8220;an insoluble dilemma.&#8221; He also reported that black school performance did not improve after the move to white schools and that when teachers lowered standards for blacks many whites slacked off, too. Coleman wanted the races to mix but came to realize that aggressive integration of the kind he had promoted often served to drive the races apart. Needless to say, the second &#8220;Coleman report&#8221; had little influence, and some of Coleman&rsquo;s erstwhile friends turned on him.</p>
<p>Many people, especially Southerners, knew what integration would bring long before Coleman figured it out, and Prof. Wolters describes Prince Edward County, Virginia&rsquo;s remarkable campaign for segregation (see <a href="/ar/1993/07/index.html#article1" target="burden" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>&#8220;Integration .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Disintegration,&#8221;</b></a> AR, July 1993). Rather than integrate, from 1959 to 1964, the county closed all public schools, slashed property taxes, and urged blacks and whites alike to build private schools. Robert T. Redd, who became the headmaster of a private school, explained, &#8220;We felt we understood black people as well as anybody because of our long interaction with them. We knew desegregation couldn&rsquo;t work because of the inherent temperamental and intellectual differences.&#8221; Whites offered to set up private schools for blacks, but national leaders like Roy Wilkins and Martin Luther King urged them to refuse. Black children without schools were too potent a symbol of white wickedness to be passed up.</p>
<p>In 1964, the Supreme Court ruled that the county had a legal duty to operate public, integrated schools, and ordered the county to levy taxes for that purposes. Even a few liberals worried that this was a usurpation of legislative, tax-raising power by the judiciary, but as was the case with <cite>Brown,</cite> principles could be sacrificed in the name of integration. This was a crucial decision because other districts would surely have followed Prince Edward&rsquo;s example if the Court had not acted.</p>
<p>Many integrationists were convinced that once black and white children got to know each other they would fall into each others&rsquo; arms. Prof. Wolters reports that most studies found that the races seldom mixed and that children of neither race thought better of the other after integration. However, one psychologist, Walter G. Stephan, concluded that after integration black students&rsquo; views of whites improved while white students soured on blacks. What Prof. Stephan probably found was that students discovered that media portrayals are wrong: Whites are not inveterate &#8220;racists,&#8221; and blacks are not simply white people who happen to have black skin.</p>

</table><p>Today, how are we to view the tortured history of court-imposed school integration? Despite the failure of integration to achieve any of its goals, Prof. Wolters finds that it is now almost obligatory to criticize <cite>Brown</cite> because it required only desegregation and not integration. Furthermore, the decision is now hailed <em>because</em> it ignored the Constitution. As historian David Garrow wrote in 1997, the decision freed the Court from &#8220;the Constitution&rsquo;s historical limitations.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is another way of saying we really do not have a Constitution. If judges can free it from its &#8220;historical limitations&#8221; they can make it say anything they like. After all, for 150 years, the Constitution permitted assignment of students by race, but it must have amended itself because it suddenly stopped permitting it in 1954. Just 14 years later, the <cite>Green</cite> Court discovered that the Constitution had amended itself again to <em>require</em> assignment by race, so long as the purpose was to mix the races. During the 1990s, the Constitution amended itself several more times, gradually working its way back to towards its 1954 condition. We are clearly not a nation of laws but a nation of judges, who rule us according to their fancy.</p>
<p>In <cite>Race and Education</cite> Prof. Wolters writes that we can expect a companion volume on the changing fashions of educational reform that have swept American schools. He appears to suspect that many doubtful theories arose because traditional approaches managed neither to raise blacks to white levels of achievement nor make children oblivious to race. If he dissects fads in education as remorselessly as he dissects fads in integration, we can look forward to a formidable work of scholarship.</p>

		<p>Some say busing was about giving big city black kids a new attitude. That is, it&rsquo;s harder to despise the evil white kid hidden away across town, planning his evil white deeds, when you&rsquo;re stealing his lunch money every day. But considering the times, with the &#8216;racial charged&rsquo; atmosphere of the civil rights movement, it was probably just about getting white girls together with black boys.   </p>

		<p>Prince Edward County&rsquo;s commendable resistance to federally mandated public school integration is still reviled by diversity zealots in spite of a tacit consensus on the &#8220;inconvenient truths&#8221; about racial differences.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Prince Edward County, Virginia is directly adjacent to Appomattox County where, in 1865, Confederate General R.E. Lee tendered the surrender of his army to the invading hosts from the North.  </p>
<p>Nearly a century later, Dixie suffered another indignity at the hands of the federal government.  No wonder they were waving all those Rebel flags!</p>

		<p>Desegregation was fine I think, but forced integration - way too far. Also, I don&rsquo;t see why private schools can&rsquo;t be segregated these days. I would still choose to go to an integrated public school but if some parents want to send their children to all-white or all-black, or all-Muslim etc. schools then why shouldn&rsquo;t they? It is a free nation after all, right? Or do liberals only consider freedom to be the freedom to agree with liberals.</p>

		<p>I just happened to be born in an era when I got to see the unmitigated disaster that was forced busing/integration. I&rsquo;ve always wondered how well George Wallace would have done in the 1968 Presidential election if people in places like Boston, Denver, &amp; Louisville could have seen what was in store with activist judges. He may not have won, but he would have been able to force Nixon or McCarthy to put a stop to a lot of this nonsense. That election was almost thrown into the house of representatives for a decision. Nixon used the &#8220;Southern strategy&#8221; then turned right around and stabbed the South in the back. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not which city take the cake for the most over the top form of judicial activism. My vote would be for Judge Clark and Kansas City. The new superintendent has made the choice to close half the schools and force all of the principals to re-interview for their jobs. At one time KC had about 70,000 students in the public schools, now it is now around 18,000 and falling every year. There are several papers about KC schools out there. This probably could have been predicted back when the KC school districts suddenly won the ghetto lottery. If Millikin v. Bradley didn&rsquo;t exist, would it have been out of the realm of Judge Clark to order busing from Overland Park, Olathe, &amp; Lenexa into KC, MO? I&rsquo;m sure he searched for years to try to find some reason to force the white kids in the KC suburbs into a county wide district. Finding no valid reason, he lets the suburban districts off the hook, but still crippled them through taxation. <br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m convinced, that once you&rsquo;ve swatted all of this Utopian sounding, liberal, leftist, egalitarian baloney aside -  what the real objective of these Cultural Marxism promoting leftists was, from the beginning, was to find a way to place sexually aggressive, predatory young black males in closer proximity to our shy, tender, vulnerable white daughters, so as to facilitate miscegenation between the two races.   </p>
<p>White Genocide, by any and all means that can be hatched out of the evil, diseased, pathologically destructive brains of the Frankfurt School graduates, People.    It&rsquo;s as simple as that.</p>
<p>Preventing white babies from being born, to speed along the eventual extinction of European people.    That&rsquo;s it in a nutshell.</p>
<p>And, the saddest aspect to this particular scheme - is that, with the proper parenting, with the proper guidance and proper counseling between white parents and their white children on the all important topic of race and genetics - 99 percent of this scheme&rsquo;s progress could realistically be eliminated.   But, thanks to White parental cowardice on this subject, thanks to White parents assuming that their immature kids can form the right attitudes on their own and without any parental guidance, we see more and more teenage white girls pushing shopping carts or strollers around town with mulatto offspring in them.</p>
<p>Have that talk, white parents.   Help save our race, ok?<br>
This is an all-hands effort, you know.<br>

		<p>Desegregation of schools was a noble experiment, but now it&rsquo;s been shown to be ineffective in raising the intellect of the majority of blacks.  Most blacks themselves realize that, by and large, they cannot compete academically with whites, and many favor separate schools with a different curriculum.  </p>
<p>Integration is fine if people have a choice, and the minority of highly intelligent black students certainly gain by it.  Most of these, however, if domiciled in an urban environment, will attend private schools right alongside non-black students.  <br>
I have a very liberal friend who used to substitute teach in the public schools of a large city that&rsquo;s about half black.  He told me that 95% of the students were black, and he suspected that somehow the system was clandestinely segregating most of the whites.  I told him that was impossible and that the vast majority of whites was undoubtedly in private schools.  He couldn&rsquo;t understand how that many people could afford it and, of course, didn&rsquo;t believe me when I said that people would somehow scrape together the funds.  </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never attended a predominantly black school, but I know some who&rsquo;ve survived such an ordeal.  In fact, my sister-in-law actually tried to teach in one a few years back.</p>
<p>If you would CHOOSE to attend an integrated school, then your opinion and mine are CLEARLY very different.  For one thing, I would be ashamed of having to recognize Kwanzaa during the Christmas holidays.  And I don&rsquo;t think I could make it through Black History Month.</p>

		<p>This is a good article, but it&rsquo;s missing one important aspect.  It doesn&rsquo;t go into to detail about what happened when blacks starting showing up in white schools: the the bullying, extortion, theft, robberies, assaults, sexual harassment, rapes and even murders of whites by racist black thugs.  There was a reason that after &#8220;integration&#8221; whites withdrew from big city public schools.  It was a matter of survival.  </p>

<p>Thank you, Luke. It has to be said that the sinister Frankfurt School has had enormous influence in this country.  It has truly transformed America as we knew it, over the course of the past half century. It has wielded more power than any army, and is one of the most successful political organizations in history   &mdash;   a Marxist conspiracy if you will. It has accomplished all of this, subverting and changing America against the public&rsquo;s will, without firing a shot.  Yet, oddly, most Americans have never even heard of it!</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t you just love how black racists and white liberals point out that &#8216;white flight&rsquo; is based out of ignorant and unsubtantiative racism?  If you tell a liberal about your negative experiences with blacks as a race, they will blame it on racism, historical past injustices, etc.  A liberal will admit their idea is wrong.  The only time they will admit their program has failed, is if they can pin the blame on someone else.</p>

<p>I would add Boas and Freud to the list as well, otherwise Luke has it dead on  &mdash;  would that everyone else could understand this as well.</p>
<p>It would preclude so much White angst.</p>
<p>Busing was one of several carefully coordinated, meticulously planned attacks on White Americans  &mdash;  to send destruction, terror and disorder directly into White communities via judicial activism which mandated &#8216;desegregation&rsquo; of WHITE communities.  This vile attack was aimed specifically at White families, especially their children, breaking up once orderly, safe communities and causing Whites to flee their neighborhoods in droves to avoid the tentacles of forced busing.</p>
<p>You can be sure those activist judges, evil politicians and ethno-centric lawyers such as Jack Greenberg did not allow their precious children to be bused into black schools or allow blacks to attend their own children&rsquo;s schools. </p>
<p>I taught in a predominantly black school for nine years and well know the hell-holes these schools are.  Black children have far more psychopathic behaviors than White children as Professor Lynn points out in &#8220;Race and Psychopathic Personality&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Studies have found that the prevalence of conduct disorders [in children and adolescents up to age 15] is about twice as high among blacks as among whites.</p>
<p>The principal criteria set out by the American Psychiatric Association (1994) for a diagnosis of conduct disorder are persistent stealing, lying, truancy, running away from home, fighting, arson, burglary, vandalism, sexual precocity and cruelty&hellip;. A number of studies have shown that conduct disorder in children is a frequent precursor of psychopathic behavior&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The lying educational-industrial complex blames these pathologies prevalent in black children on &#8216;racism&rsquo; and &#8216;White oppression&rsquo;, as I&rsquo;ve had to listen to repeatedly for over two decades in mandated teacher professional development.</p>
<p>I constantly had to deal with these aberrant black behaviors, asked by a hostile administration what I had done or said to set off a black child&rsquo;s psychopathic  behavior.  The administration, in turn, was under tremendous pressure from the district to stop suspending, expelling or excluding black children because there is such a huge &#8216;disparate impact&rsquo; between black and White (always White) suspensions and expulsions.  </p>
<p>As the educational dictate is &#8216;We Are All The Same!&rsquo; the explanation for the different rates of suspension and failure MUST be found in some external trigger  &mdash;  leading to more and more ridiculous explanations as blacks in black cities run by black mayors, districts run by black superintendents, schools staffed with black principals and teachers, an entirely black-centric curricula, and black-dominate culture scream that their failures are due to &#8216;White oppression&rsquo;!  </p>
<p>White teachers cannot win:  We are harshly criticized and blamed for over-suspending and failing black children and then criticized again when we seek to flee these schools at the first possible opportunity.  It took me nine years to finally escape.  I figure the district needed me, as a White, to not only provide an education to black children (well aware that most black teachers are woefully inadequate in subject matter) but to fulfill required racial staffing quotas as well.</p>
<p>One White colleague who decided not to flee, to stay on &#8216;to make a difference&rsquo; in the black community finally had a complete, total and utter breakdown around year 20.  She ended up hospitalized, medicated, sedated, deeply depressed and completely broken.  At age 50 she had to move back in with her parents and as far as I know (two years later) is still trying to recover from two decades of trauma and abuse and the realization that she DIDN&rsquo;T, HADN&rsquo;T and indeed couldn&rsquo;t make a difference  &mdash;  all the energy she had expended, the insults she had withstood, the marriage she gave up, were all for naught.  </p>
<p>Life in a black school for Whites?</p>
<p>Pure Hell.</p>

<p>LOL!</p>
<p>Part of the problem is the schools explain away all aberrant black/hispanic behaviors as due to &#8216;White Oppression&rsquo; therefore giving the kids Carte Blanche to do as they will  &mdash;  steal, rob, threaten, yell, come and go as they wish and call White teachers every vile, racist name imaginable.  All of it is excused!  </p>
<p>They&rsquo;re allowed to come in late, run around the school without going to class, run in and out of classrooms screaming loud &#8216;shout-outs&rsquo; to their fellow thugs and wear their pants down around their knees.</p>
<p>You, as a White teacher, are in turn blamed and called &#8216;racist&rsquo; when you deign to discipline these &#8216;children&rsquo; by sending them to the office or tell them to pull up their pants.  You are also blamed for the abysmally low test scores.  You, as a White teacher, cannot and will not win and the ONLY course of action is to leave black-majority schools ASAP (that is, it you aren&rsquo;t driven out first).</p>
<p>That, combined with a black-centric curricula blowing up black achievements and accomplishments far far far beyond their merits, self-esteem lessons that give false bravado to black thugs who have achieved exactly nothing and a White-hating culture that believes Whites (even when there isn&rsquo;t one for miles around) are the cause of (choose any/all of the following)  &mdash;  high black crime rates, black school failure, high rates of black incarceration, black poverty, black anger and rage, and you have a potent, toxic mix of &#8216;I Can Do Anything I Want and Get Away With IT!!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I can imagine blacks are insufferable in the workplace.  The poorly educated, White-hating ones in the schools are bad enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Ah, but one could choose the republican answer that these are just individual failures. Some blacks are disruptive, some whites are disruptive&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>LOL!  Now you&rsquo;re getting it!  This is exactly what is spewed in educational theory.  Anecdotes and slogans replace reasonable explanations  &mdash;  as in blacks exhibit more psychopathic behaviors, black brains are smaller, the frontal lobes of blacks are underdeveloped, black IQ averages one standard deviation below that of Whites.</p>
<p>But these things must not cannot be mentioned! Hence the reaching further and further into the ridiculous and absurd  to explain away deviant behavior and intractable educational failures.</p>

		<p>We should be attacking the &#8216;diversity mongers&rsquo; by throwing the insanity of their position right back in their faces. What they are advocating is very simple, and obviously insane:<br>
They are advocating FORCING hundreds of millions of white people to live our entire lives with people who we DO NOT WANT TO LIVE WITH. The liberals then complain about how we DO NOT WANT TO LIVE WITH people who they have FORCED onto us. (They call this &#8216;being racist&rsquo;). They then say that MORE of the same is going to somehow make things &#8216;better&rsquo;. Who for?</p>
<p>We know that most white people want to live in all white countries, otherwise all white countries would never have existed in the first place. And most importantly, we wouldn&rsquo;t have hundreds of areas in every white country, with a larger number of non-whites than the average in the population - which proves that most of the whites moved OUT, and most whites do not move IN to those areas.</p>

		<p>Wolters is the ONLY fully honest scholar writing about school integration.  I say this as a veteran - as both student and teacher - of the integration wars.  I strongly recommend his 2nd book about integration, RACE AND EDUCATION, 1954 - 2007.  In it he does address what happened to white students (physically and academically) in integrated schools, especially on pages 191 -217.  I reviewed this book at www.amazon.com.  I won&rsquo;t post Dr. Wolters&rsquo; email at the University of Delaware, but I suggest AR readers might like to look it up to thank him and encourage him in his truth telling.  BTW, he is now working on a book about the attempts to close the black - white achievement gap (aka, &#8220;school reform&#8221;) which we are constantly being told is about to be closed, yet never is.</p>

<p>Both and All of the Above.</p>
<p>On hormonal differences &#8216;raging hormones&rsquo;:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Studies have repeatedly found that black men have more of the male hormone testosterone in their blood than whites do&hellip; High crime rates among blacks are consistent with low intelligence and high testosterone&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/2f7uegk" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2f7uegk</a></p>
<p>On black brains (All of the following is taken from Ruston&rsquo;s Race_Evolution_Behavior):</p>
<p> Broca found that White brains had more surface folding than Black brains. (The more folded the surface of the brain, the more brain cells it can contain.) White brains also had larger frontal lobes which are used in self control and planning. </p>
<p>In 1906, Robert Bean reported on 150 brains of autopsied Blacks and Whites in the American Journal of Anatomy.  He found the brains of Blacks were less folded than <br>
those of Whites and had fewer fibers leading to the frontal lobes.</p>
<p>In 1980, Kenneth Ho&rsquo;s team confirmed the Black-White differences. Their autopsy study was published in the Archives of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. Original brain weight data for 1,261 American adults showed that Whites averaged 100 grams more brain weight than did Blacks&hellip; differences in body size do not explain away these race differences in brain size. </p>
<p><br>
LOL.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re proving my point! (that being the absurdity, insanity and surreality of the idea that blacks can perform as well as Whites, fit into and succeed in a White-created First World technological culture).</p>
<p>It would be laughable if it weren&rsquo;t for the USG dedicating TRILLIONS of dollars on this fool&rsquo;s notion, That Which Cannot and Will Not Ever Be Achieved:  black parity with Whites. </p>
<p>As far as blacks having a license to fail.  Yes.  </p>
<p>This has been my experience in over two decades in the schools and having to sit through numerous, twice monthly &#8216;professional developments.&rsquo;  Black failure is blamed on everything except the shortcomings of inherent black abilities vs. inherent White/Asian abilities, i.e., the higher native intelligence of Whites and Asians vs. blacks and hispanics.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ll never, not ever hear intelligence/personality/hormonal differences mentioned anywhere, ever in mainstream discussion  &mdash;  by the msm, government, or the idiots who run K-12 academia  &mdash;  although I am convinced they know these differences exist.</p>
<p>How could they not with 100 years worth of hard empirical evidence, not explained away by White Oppression and Racism.</p>
<p>Look at where these hypocrites live, those who claim &#8216;Diversity is Our Strength&rsquo;, and examine where they send their precious children  &mdash;  not to any school with blacks and hispanics whom they so champion and claim are equal in intelligence/behavior to Whites and Asians.</p>

		<p>I quit high school in the twelfth grade to study and take my GED, because the high school I found myself in at the time was almost as bad as walking in downtown Detroit.  It was like walking through a gauntlet going from class to class, and you better not have to go to the bathroom.  I felt my skin crawl when I had to walk past a leering black guy, who invariably told me what he would like to do to me. It used to be a nice beautiful all-white school.  When they bused them in, did they have to turn us into minorities?</p>
<p>And now, years later, you see the result of it all.  And it isn&rsquo;t merely a skin color issue, although it totally does not appeal to me.  The cultures are so vastly different.  I couldn&rsquo;t imagine my tying myself forever to a group of people who live their daily lives that way.  Look anywhere, the tv, internet, real life out there, and you can see the truth of just what that culture has done to our cities, our schools, and our daughters.<br>
  <br>
And, Luke #7, we have had that &#8220;talk&#8221; and I believe we have a zero percent chance of it happening to us.  Unfortunately, my sister did not have that same luck, her daughter poor deluded girl, was persuaded to &#8220;mix&#8221; the races, and now has three little examples.</p>

<p>It is indeed difficult to find someone in academia who speaks out on educational insanity.</p>
<p>I imagine Raymond Wolters has been under attack by the left for his realist views.</p>
<p>I wanted you to know that I purchased Race and Education through the Amazon link  &mdash;  apparently there is no paperback version and the used version of the hardback is $35.00, also no Kindle version as of yet  &mdash;  I bit the bullet and bought it to add to my arsenal.</p>
<p>Two other good books that cut through the educational lies:</p>
<p>Real Education by Charles Murray</p>

		<p>&#8220;How could they not (know) with 100 years worth of hard empirical evidence, not explained away by White Oppression and Racism. Look at where these hypocrites live, those who claim &lsquo;Diversity is Our Strength&rsquo;, and examine where they send their precious children&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not necessarily a contradiction. Blacks and Hispanics act out because of racist oppression. Asians don&rsquo;t, because - there&rsquo;s no history of white men degrading and oppressing their women (sic). Liberal whites don&rsquo;t want their children exposed to black and hispanics, any more than you or I do, in some cases, because of the results of this oppression. I&rsquo;m not a liberal, but it&rsquo;s not necessarily a contradiction. It&rsquo;s merely a contradiction with the official notion that only whites can hate. </p>
