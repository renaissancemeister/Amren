			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chris Doucette, Toronto Sun, May 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Eight-year-old Lyric Elliott says life at her Scarborough school has been an absolute nightmare for the last 18 months thanks to bullies who refuse to leave her alone and an education system that has done too little to protect her.</p>
<p>Now, after 163 visits to the office at William Tredway Junior Public School  &mdash;  and repeated pleas to school staff to keep her daughter safe  &mdash;  the young girl&rsquo;s mother has decided &#8220;enough is enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;I pulled her out of school last week,&#8221; Jacqueline Elliott told the Toronto Sun Wednesday. &#8220;I just couldn&rsquo;t take it any more.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said the final straw came last Thursday when five boys pushed Lyric to the ground, then poked and prodded her with sticks.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was bruised and scratched from head to toe,&#8221; Jacqueline said of her daughter&rsquo;s injuries.</p>
<p>Lyric said she loved going to school before she, her baby sister and mom fled an abusive situation in Calgary and moved to the Markham Rd. and Lawrence Ave. E. area in 2008.</p>
<p>But now she&rsquo;s simply terrified because of the constant harassment she claims she faces.</p>
<p>&#8220;It happens just about every day,&#8221; the soft-spoken youngster said of the abuse she has allegedly endured. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a bad dream that I can&rsquo;t wake up from.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lyric now has nightmares quite regularly because of the bullying. All she wants is to go to school and feel safe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just stop bullying me and leave me alone,&#8221; Lyric said, reaching out to her alleged abusers. &#8220;They think it&rsquo;s funny when they see me cry or get hurt.&#8221;</p>
<p>The little girl said she believes her fellow students single her out &#8220;because I&rsquo;m white.&#8221; Her mother said she couldn&rsquo;t help wonder if race was a factor when Lyric came home from the predominantly black school asking to take a bath.</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked her why and she told me it was because the kids were calling her a &#8216;dirty white girl,&rsquo;&#8221; added Jacqueline, who added that several members of her family are African-Canadian.</p>
<p>In one of the worst incidents, Lyric&rsquo;s mother claims three first-grade boys threw Lyric on the ground and took turns &#8220;dry humping her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only one of the boys was suspended,&#8221; Jacqueline said. &#8220;I was told the other two hadn&rsquo;t been in any trouble before.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the recent passing of Bill 157 by the province, which is suppose to combat bullying by requiring school staff to file a report on all such incidents, the frustrated mom insisted she has had difficulty getting action.</p>
<p>Jacqueline said there are about five kids, girls and boys, who are terrorizing her daughter. She said she complained to the principal more than 40 times about one girl before her parents were finally notified.</p>
<p>And Jacqueline added she was told by school staff there is no point in suspending the bullies because they would just consider it &#8220;a holiday.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tired of fighting with Lyric every morning and &#8220;dragging&#8221; her to school only to have her call home part way through the day claiming to be sick, Jacqueline is now refusing to bring her daughter back to William Tredway even though she could face legal ramifications for withdrawing her child from school.</p>
<p>The mom said she has spoken to the school principal countless times; she has called Toronto Police but they can&rsquo;t lay charges because the alleged bullies are under 12 years old; education ministry officials told her she must contact her school&rsquo;s superintendent; and the superintendent, Kerry-Lynn Stadnyk, has told her the principal is dealing with it.</p>
<p>Jacqueline said she has made more than 100 calls to Stadnyk, but she has only actually spoken to her a handful of times.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve asked many times to meet with her and she won&rsquo;t,&#8221; Jacqueline contended.</p>
<p>However, after a Sun reporter called the Toronto District School Board Wednesday, Jacqueline said she suddenly received a call from Stadnyk offering to meet with her next week.</p>
<p>She said they spoke for 45 minutes on the phone.</p>
<p>A TDSB spoeksman said Stadnyk was unavailable for comment until Thursday.<br/>

		<p>This is only the beginning of our troubles.  In the first place many Whites are so de-racinated and so conditioned with &#8220;diversity&#8221; that they send their child to a predominantly Black school.  No intelligent White parent should do such a thing.  A de-racinated parent usually results in a child or children that have no racial consciousness either.  The result is a refusal or an inability for self-defense,either verbal or physical.  As Whites continue to have children below the replacement level and Blacks and 3rd Worlders flood into this country as they are doing now, the situation for Whites will become worse and worse until we are - as Jared Taylor puts it - a hated and hunted minority.  We must start to act now.<br/>

<p>First grade?  Hey, I wouldn&rsquo;t have even understood what &#8220;humping&#8221; could mean until my second year of college!  (Is this knowledge typical of black boys that young?  How do they learn this?)</p>
<p>(What does worry me is how the 8-year-old girl was able to express what happened to her in words interpretable as &#8220;dry humping&#8221;.  Tricky to do without knowing, um, the concept&hellip;)</p>

		<p>And yet if a white student had only used strong words it might become an incident reported in the international news. Which is why non-whites carry on as they do and at the same time make it their number one goal to cry about &#8216;racism&rsquo;?</p>

		<p>Why do stories like this even make the news?  </p>
<p>Described is typical Diversity, and we should never draw attention to its stereotypical aspects.  </p>
<p>Any story about interaction between Whites and the Diversity Race Privileges should promote Inclusive Tolerance, Multicultural Inclusion, and Diversity is Our Strength.  If she was mistreated, it was because she didn&rsquo;t have the proper ethical perspective that would have shown her that social justice requires Whites to have passionate empathy for cultural differences.</p>
<p>Stories about White girls being harassed and tortured by the Diversity should be censored.<br/>

		<p>Many Canadians I know have all but written off Toronto as a lost cause.  </p>
<p>In the space of 35 years, this once wonderful city has been turned into a sprawling ghetto, where the majority aren&rsquo;t white, where ethnic enclaves rarely interact in any significant way, and the socialist city council is running the finances into the ground.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nick-named &#8216;the international full-service hotel&rsquo;. </p>

		<p>The parents of this child were obviously raised themselves in the PC &#8220;all races are equal&#8221; drivel that has been uppermost in public schools over the past 30+ years.  Where I&rsquo;m from, no parent in his/her right mind would send their little girl or boy to a predominantly black school!!!  That&rsquo;s what homeschooling is all about.  You don&rsquo;t want your kids beaten up or brainwashed, so you educate them yourselves.  It can be done.  Even if both parents work, there&rsquo;s always grandparents or college kids who are eager to earn a day&rsquo;s pay here and there for teaching little kids.  I know this because it&rsquo;s being done in my own family.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;dry-humping&#8221; incident does not surprise me in the least. Black children learn all about sex from a very young age. I taught kindergarten at an all black school. I often had to separate certain children because they would touch each other in an inappropriate manner. The the most shocking thing I heard of was that one year there was a problem with the first grade girls engaging in oral sex in the girls&rsquo; bathroom. When I was that age, I knew nothing about sex. No white child should have to be subjected to the sexual pathologies of Africans. </p>

		<p>One name for it is &#8220;Dry Humping&#8221; and another is &#8220;sexual harassment&#8221;, an even better term could be &#8220;practice rape&#8221;. </p>
<p>The Canadians didn&rsquo;t have slavery so what type of guilt would make them put up with this?</p>

		<p>Sickening.  I had to read multiple paragraphs before being informed about the racial nature of this horrible scenario.</p>
<p>If this were white on black bullying with taunts of &#8220;dirty black girl&#8221;, it would be headline news for days with all the news commentators shrieking about &#8220;hate&#8221; and &#8220;white racism&#8221;.</p>
<p>Also, the headline would have explicityly  stated the racial nature of the bullying.</p>

		<p>&#8220;In one of the worst incidents, Lyric&rsquo;s mother claims three first-grade boys threw Lyric on the ground and took turns &ldquo;dry humping her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first I thought I must be hallucinating when I read that. First grade boys? How old are they, 5 or 6 years old? Then I remembered something.</p>
<p>Many years ago when I lived in NYC I took a walk over to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It was a nice summer evening and when I left I decided to sit dowm on the steps and enjoy the weather and the nice summer breeze. A young Black boy approached and started talking to me. I&rsquo;m guessing he was 11, maybe 12 years old. Mind you, I was in my late twenties/early thirties at the time. I was trying to be polite, but it finally dawned on me that he was trying to hit on me!</p>
<p>So, yes, I can believe that first grade Blacks were trying to dry hump that young White child. </p>

		<p>One less white in the school means it will become more difficult for the remaining white children. </p>
<p>I came across a similar case where a white mother pulled her daughter out of a high school because of racial bullying. Luckily the girl could be sent to live with family out in farming country and go to an all white school. I got the mother to read a couple of issues of the AmRen newsletter but she didn&rsquo;t like it. She said it is racist.</p>

		<p>I have a number of relatives in the Toronto-Mississauga area.  As long ago as as 2003, I went with some of them to a large mall near Toronto.  Easily two-thirds of the people there were non-white.  This shocked me at the time - and I commented upon it - because I did not realize how Canada had changed.  I did not think such a situation existed outside of certain areas of the U.S.  Unfortunately, my relatives, and most of their fellow Canadian friends (all white)subscribe to the early sixties fantasy that we are all alike, except for the color of our skin, and they act accordingly.  (By the way, I occasionally see women in full burkhas in Canada near the U.S. border, but never in the U.S.)</p>

		<p>After reading this story, I&rsquo;m not sure which emotion is strongest. Pity for this little girl, or anger at the mother. 18 months of this? I wouldn&rsquo;t have stood ONE DAY of it. There is no way I could stand by and watch my child endure such abuse for so long. This poor little girl will carry these emotional scars for the rest of her life. Shame on the mother for not getting her out sooner. It should have been clear after the.. oh&hellip;3rd call that nothing was going to be done about her situation.</p>

<p>Proves that some White women have no tolerance for confronting Race Reality when described by White Awarians.</p>
<p>Also proves that she pulled her child out of that school too soon. A couple of more incidents, and she would have become one of us.</p>

		<p>Daniel (#8) hit the nail on the head when he opined that when three first-grade African boys throw a female on the ground and begin &#8220;dry-humping&#8221; her it&rsquo;s actually practice for when they get a little older and can graduate to actual gang rapes.    </p>

<p>the superintendent, Kerry-Lynn Stadnyk, has told her the principal is dealing with it.  Jacqueline said she has made more than 100 calls to Stadnyk, but she has only actually spoken to her a handful of times.<br/>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve asked many times to meet with her and she won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Jacqueline contended.<br/>
______________________</p>
<p>This Suerintendent Stadnyk is doubtless terrified of touching this issue, knowing it is a racial hot potato. She&rsquo;s avoiding it like poison.  Where black-white issues are  concerned, nobody wants to know anything.  She&rsquo;s protecting her own job and career by following the policy of  &#8220;Hear no evil, see no evil.&#8221;<br/>
In cases like this, you&rsquo;re on your own.</p>

		<p>Of course, had these students been a few years older, the stick poking and dry humping would have been gang rape instead.  <br/>
There&rsquo;s hardly a day that goes by that I don&rsquo;t hear about some white girl or woman who has been raped and/or murdered by placing herself in the clutches of some ghetto or barrio lowlife.  The ivy-tower liberals who preach &#8220;tolerance&#8221; send their own children to exclusive private schools and drive into high-security office buildings in order to make a living.  But they expect common folk to live in crime-ridden jungles for the sake of diversity.</p>

		<p>Regarding 6 year old black boys dry humping. Many years ago a psychology professor in college talked about a black woman who asked why her 5 year old son was dry humping magazines. The professor (I am surprised now that he relayed this story) asked about the household and it turned out the woman&rsquo;s black boyfriend often joked and and pointed at the boy scrotch saying &#8220;You know what thing thing is for? You know how to use that thing?&#8221; etc&hellip; The woman found the crude sexual jokes and taunts directed at her 5 year old fine but couldn&rsquo;t understand the boys behavior!</p>

		<p>	The white population is under assault; whites are often singled out as easy targets… being attacked assaulted robbed even raped in disproportionate numbers; other races tend to look at whites as easy targets because under the guise of protecting racial minorities, laws, programs, and practices discriminate against whites.</p>

		<p>There is just one black kid in my son&rsquo;s classroom, a girl.  Her father is a pastor.  The stuff this girl brings in the class is off the wall.  (She was left back, unfortunately, and is supposed to be in a higher grade.)  My kid comes home asking, &#8220;Who is Usher?  Who is Rihanna?&#8221;  He is also boasting that he knows how to talk &#8216;ghetto&rsquo; now.  I shut him down when he tries to practice it.</p>
<p>Last year (before she was in my son&rsquo;s classroom), this girl was caught pleasuring herself, multiple times on different occasions, in class (grade 4).  Parents called.  Nothing happened.  She has the full ghetto &#8216;tude.  She talks about rap stars, hip hop, and generally is a corrosive influence on the entire class.  (I have liberal access to this school and its inner workings.)</p>
<p>Due to this and other facts, I&rsquo;m sending my kid to a different private school next year.  (Yes, this private school has given the girl a full scholarship - no monthly fees.)  My wife and I briefly discussed public school as an option, but when we looked up the demographics of the local school (40% black/latino and the rest Asian - Korean and Chinese) we realized our kid would be an outcast.</p>
<p>Yesterday I drove by that school and saw a crowd of black girls in the playground doing hoochie momma dances.  I turned my head and said my kid is never going there, even if I have to eat rice and beans everyday to afford the best private school.</p>

		<p>While this is of course reprehensible, do I understand this girl is probably a mulato? Mayhaps the term dirty white girl? You marry them you become them. Obviously even young blacks think these white women who marry, or breed with blacks or are the get of such are dirty white trash.

		<p>This has been going on for a long time, folks.  My wife, when she was in high school in the LA region, had to keep her books at the principal&rsquo;s office because a black boy kept breaking into her locker.  He wouldn&rsquo;t take anything, but he would stand by and leer at her as she discovered the breech one more time.  I think the message was clear and predicted more and worse to come.  So her parents finally pulled her out of that school and enrolled her in a private Lutheran high school nearby, even though they were Catholics.  A year later, the public high school saw a large black gang invasion where everyone white was hunted down and beaten up.  The storm fences designed to keep the bad kids out, kept the innocent kids in.  Isn&rsquo;t that a kind of metaphor for what we have going on in this country today?</p>
<p>In another situation, a girl friend I had some years previous to this had been raised in the LA region.  She would be 61 today.  When she was in the first grade, Mexican boys would follow her home and tear her clothing from her along the way.  She would arrive home with her clothing in tatters.  Her parents moved the family up to to a small town Northern California.</p>
<p>But these experiences did not make these females grow up race conscious.  Most third person stories I know of, and I know many, the white females who were harassed in school by non-whites often grow up to date and marry from the same non-white groups.  I can only guess that the real damage of early harassment like this is that the children become convinced of their negative identity and seek someone in that group who will treat them just a little decently as a way to establish their own personal validity.  And that often backfires too.</p>

What has happened here is these girls have learned that the men of their own race are weak and will not protect them.  Because their fathers refused to.</p>

		<p>Growing up in the Washington suburbs in the 1980s, I was frequently accosted by black and Mexican boys. When this happens in schools, the victims are usually blamed. </p>

<p>******************************</p>
<p> Good question.   From the outset, I had the same question in mind.  Naturally, the press (particularly in Canada) is going to be cagey about this and not tell you anything racial.    [Race is irrelevant!   Race has nothing to do with it!]    </p>
<p>Nonetheless, there are tell tale signs.  The mother volunteered that&hellip; &#8220;some members of her family are African-Canadian&#8221;.  And the article tells us that she &hellip; &#8220;fled an abusive situation in Calgary&#8221; and  then moved to a colored area of Toronto, sending her daughter to a largely black school.  Nor does there seem to be any father in this family picture, another symptom.    I have to wonder.</p>

		<p>What in the world was this mother thinking?  It breaks my heart to think of this little girl suffering - how is she supposed to get over the betrayal of her own kin refusing to protect her?  163 visits to the school?!  I would have made ONE, the one pulling my baby out of there.  Of course, I&rsquo;d cut off my own arm before I&rsquo;d send her to a majority-black school.  </p>
<p>I endured forced busing in the 70s, and it certainly made ME race-conscious.  It wasn&rsquo;t even about violence, either - they were just so obviously a different people, a child could see it.    Especially a child who&rsquo;d grown up without the &#8216;benefit&rsquo; of their presence until then.  They seemed like a bunch of poorly-trained children to me.  I didn&rsquo;t dislike them then, I had very few preconceived ideas about them - I just found them incomprehensible.  I couldn&rsquo;t understand what any of us were supposed to be getting out of it.  It certainly wasn&rsquo;t fair to *them* to dump them in with us - they were illiterate.  They literally didn&rsquo;t speak the same language we did.    </p>
<p>I currently live in a very liberal area, and none, not one, of my liberal friends would dream of sending their precious children to a black school.  One of my friends, who voted for Obama, sold her house for less than its value and bought a new one in a better district in a very short space of time, so motivated was she to keep her son from spending one day in the black-majority school in their neighborhood.</p>

		<p>The sad thing is, this could be describing ANY city in the USA, ever since I can remember, and I am in my late 40&rsquo;s. My mom even said when she was young they knew enough to avoid blacks because they meant trouble. The lucky thing about her age was, they were kept mostly apart.  <br/>

&#8220;the woman&rsquo;s black boyfriend often joked and and [made] crude sexual jokes and taunts directed at her 5 year old son.<br/>
  <br/>
The woman found [these] fine but couldn&rsquo;t understand the boys behavior!&#8221;<br/>
   &mdash;   Sonia<br/>
___________________________</p>
<p>Blacks have a very casual attitude toward these things&hellip; it&rsquo;s an entirely different cultural outlook  than we have.  Sometimes it can be a shock to realize this.</p>
<p>I was a manager of a large office in a very large organization.  The staff was overwhelmingly black and mostly female.   Every year we had high school students come as summer interns, allegedly to acquire  work habits, although they never really  did anything but hang around and kill time.   It gave them an excuse to earn some money,  and also keep out of mischief.  These students were always &#8220;minority&#8221;, never white.   [Yes, it&rsquo;s bizarre to say that  100% were the &#8220;minority&#8221;!  - but that&rsquo;s one of the leftist euphemisms we are required to use] </p>
<p>One of these kids, a scrawny little shrimp who looked no more than 10 years old, rather than a high school teenager,  considered himself  a real Lothario and God&rsquo;s gift to women.  He specialized in hanging around the women &hellip;.cracking lewd jokes, using obscenities,  sexual language, and making indecent suggestions.  Everything he said had a sexual undertone. </p>
<p>The black women never objected and apparently thought  his behavior was very &#8220;cute&#8221;.  He was a  &#8220;cute&#8221; little fella. They were protective and motherly towards him. When I finally reprimanded him and asked him if he had no work to do,  some of them became indignant  and we almost had a racial &#8220;incident&#8221; . One of them actually walked out.   How dare I give their cute little pet any work!   [Isn&rsquo;t that  what he was being paid for?]  </p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t realized it until that point, but they were ALL on his side!   I had thought that he was sexually harassing them  (strictly forbidden under the rules, which would get a white man fired), but it turned out they enjoyed it!    They behaved like I was the culprit  in the matter.   I was even called in by my  own superior and questioned about it.  Nothing more came of it, but it was, for me, an education.  The lesson from that was &hellip; leave blacks alone.  Don&rsquo;t interfere.  Let them do their own thing. They  don&rsquo;t have the same moral standards that we do.  We can&rsquo;t expect the same behavior from them.</p>

<p>I too have that suspicion. Parts of the story hint at it, and the mother certainly doesn&rsquo;t have any sense   &mdash;  - to live there, send her daughter to that school, and to put up with that behavior for such a long time!   Any other mother with a brain would have done something about it long ago. And where is her father?</p>
<p>Even if the girl is not &#8220;mixed-race&#8221;, I wonder what her other [apparently fatherless] siblings are?  As usual with the press,  there&rsquo;s a lot that isn&rsquo;t being told in this story.   </p>

<p>The blue link &#8220;original article&#8221; will lead you to the girl&rsquo;s photo   &mdash;   she&rsquo;s White.</p>
<p>Following this original story with avid interest, I had left several comments (commentary now disabled) that were too forthcoming (lower IQ for blacks, etc), so they were subsequently expunged. </p>
<p>This story had garnered so much interest amongst readers, that by the last time I checked, there had been over 350 comments.  </p>
