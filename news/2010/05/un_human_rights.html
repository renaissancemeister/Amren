<h1>U.N. Human Rights Experts Criticize Arizona Law</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Elaine Engeler, Cybercast News Service (CNS), May 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Arizona&rsquo;s new law on illegal immigration could violate international standards that are binding in the United States, six U.N. human rights experts said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The basic human rights regulations, signed by the U.S. and many other nations, regard issues such as discrimination and the terms under which a person can be detained, the experts said.</p>
<p>&#8220;A disturbing pattern of legislative activity hostile to ethnic minorities and immigrants has been established with the adoption of an immigration law that may allow for police action targeting individuals on the basis of their perceived ethnic origin,&#8221; the experts said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In their statement, the six U.N. experts said: {snip} &#8220;Relevant international standards require that detention be used only as an exceptional measure, justified, narrowly tailored and proportional in each individual case, and that it be subject to judicial review,&#8221; the experts said.</p>
<p>The law could result in potential discrimination against Mexicans, indigenous peoples and other minorities in Arizona, the U.N. officials said.</p>
<p>They also said they are concerned about the enactment of a law prohibiting Arizona school programs featuring the histories and cultures of ethnic minorities because everyone has the right to learn about his own cultural and linguistic heritage.</p>
<p>The six U.N. human rights experts, who are unpaid, are</p>
<p>  &mdash;  {snip} Jorge Bustamante of Mexico;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance Githu Muigai of Kenya;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  {snip} James Anaya of the United States;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  {snip} Farida Shaheed of Pakistan;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  {snip} Vernor Munos Villalobos of Costa Rica; and</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Independent Expert on minority issues Gay McDougall of the United States.<br>

<p>Just exactly how does one get to be a &#8220;human rights expert?&#8221;  Is it enough simply to be black or brown, or is a thorough grounding in the theory and practice of marxism also required?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;They also said they are concerned about the enactment of a law prohibiting Arizona school programs featuring the histories and cultures of ethnic minorities because everyone has the right to learn about his own cultural and linguistic heritage.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that if all those mestizo students had stayed in May-hee-co they would have gotten all the information they ever needed about their own &#8220;cultural and linguistic heritage.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&ldquo;A disturbing pattern of legislative activity hostile to ethnic minorities and immigrants has been established with the adoption of an immigration law that may allow for police action targeting individuals on the basis of their perceived ethnic origin,&rdquo; the experts said.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I wonder what these &#8220;experts&#8221; think about the way Mexico treats illegal immigrants within its own borders.<br>

		<p>Without an education, these people wouldn&rsquo;t be where they are.</p>
<p>Two of the panel, the Kenyan and the Pakistani, owe their education to Britain, which established the first Western curiculum in those countries. </p>
<p>The Costa Rican and the Mexican owe their achievements to being inside the U.S. sphere, and the Americans owe theirs to the founding fathers.</p>
<p>Instead of respectful gratitude to Western civilization, we get contempt for our laws.<br>

		<p>A quick search on google reveals that the 4 non Americans on the un&rsquo;s &#8220;human rights EXPERTS list&#8221; are:</p>
<p>1 pakastani female women&rsquo;s rights advocate</p>
<p>1 mexican male who is a &#8220;mexican migration expert&#8221;.</p>
<p>1 costa rican latino male who is an expert on the &#8220;right to an education&#8221;.</p>
<p>1 black male kenyan who is an &#8220;expert on contemporary forms of racism&#8221;.</p>
<p>The 2 Americans on the board are:</p>
<p>1 male who appears to be a full blooded indian who is a &#8220;Professor of Human Rights Law Indigenous Peoples&#8221;. Nowhere did I find a description of his ethnicity. He appears to be of American indian or hispanic descent.</p>
<p>1 black female who for a dozen years was Executive Director of Global Rights, Partners for Justice. In August 2005, she was named the first United Nations Independent Expert on Minority Issues.</p>
<p>Apparently these 6 non Whites are trying to tell White America what laws are NOT acceptable to them. I am not familiar with this group. Do they wield any REAL power???</p>

		<p>We have a Pakistani and a Kenyan coming out against SB 1070?  There&rsquo;s another good reason to support it.</p>
<p>I have thought all along that two of the clandestine forces financing the opposition to SB 1070 are Hispanic drug gangs and Muslim terrorist cabals.  That a Pakistani and Kenyan, from counties that are known havens for AQ, are opposed to SB 1070, might prove my theory.  Or it might be the usual leftist bloviation.</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t it strange that this same corrupt organization refuses to condemn Mexico for it&rsquo;s extensive, ongoing civil rights abuse of its citizens, yet sees fit to criticize the US for anything and everything every chance it gets?</p>
<p>Mexicans are required to ask permission from the local crooked politician and police to even scrounge through the county dump.</p>
<p>They are encouraged to leave the country in search of work, because the petrol dollars and the other revenue derived from the resources of the richest country in Central and South America, are all passed back and forth among a clique of corrupt politicians whose pockets are also filled with drug pesos, which includes nearly ALL the police and military federales.</p>
<p>If Central Americans happen to slip by Mexican military guards at their southern border, they are robbed, raped, beaten, and subject to stiff prison sentences.  They cannot participate in elections; they cannot own property, and if they steal bread or other food they will be kicked and beaten into submission by the local constable.  Many of them are killed outright.</p>
<p>These are but a few outrages committed by a narco police state that is on the verge of being taken over by the very drug gangs that are paying them right now.</p>
<p>Yet, again, has the UN uttered even one single word of condemnation? They have not.  Nor have they condemned Cuba, Venezuela and orther dictatorial regimes for imprisoning innocent people or ones who have different political views.</p>
<p>The UN is a radical leftist organization that exists as an organ of propaganda for Marxist dregs who want to see a one world Marxist government, with them at the top forcing everyone to do as they say.  The scary thing of it all is that these people are so lacking in intellect and ability they could no more run an international organization than they could a candy store.</p>
<p>When the global economies are at their fevered pitch as socialism breaks down completely and erupts into uncontrolled violence, about 2012, the UN should be dismantled and the personnel put on trial to determine their extent of culpability.  As in Nurenburg, the greatest offenders need to be hanged while the others are placed in the coldest, darkest prison available for the rest of their lives without access to communication with anybody by word or by writing.</p>
<p>One of the greatest problems for humankind today is the UN.  Only when they are out of the way can we deal with their fellow criminal organizations in the US. </p>

		<p>Well, in fact, it doesn&rsquo;t violate their precious laws, nor does it violate OUR Federal law, which laws are the only ones WE should concern ourselves with.  Moreover, I&rsquo;d love to see the laws in Costa Rica, Mexico, Kenya etc regarding illegal entrants, and whether they are &#8220;detained&#8221; or not.  And in what kind of conditions in their third world jails. Screw them.  Let them whine, but let them STAY OUT OF OUR BUSINESS, and oh, by the way, stay our of our country!</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Arizona&rsquo;s new law on illegal immigration could violate international standards that are binding in the United States, six U.N. human rights experts said Tuesday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The U.N. is an utterly worthless organization, that has know business discussing the issue of &ldquo;human rights&rdquo; at all. It is ultimately interested in no such thing, as its only functions seem to be supporting Communist dictatorships and advocating for white racial genocide. </p>
<p>In fact, their own definition of genocide (which they hold to be a punishable crime) directly contradicts their stance on nonwhite &ldquo;migrations&rdquo; into white countries. It is as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, as such: <br>
(a) Killing members of the group; <br>
(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; <br>
(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; <br>
(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; <br>
(e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.&rdquo; </p>
<p>See this link:  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.hrweb.org/legal/genocide.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.hrweb.org/legal/genocide.html</a></p>
<p>If anyone can rationally argue with a straight face, that each one of these points is not violated by the U.N. in their advocacy for nonwhite &ldquo;migrations&rdquo; into the West, I would like meet them. The fact of the matter is, no one can, because every point is clearly being promoted in the quest for the racial displacement and eventual extermination of whites through: first, invasion; second, territorial &ldquo;integration;&rdquo; third, &ldquo;wealth redistribution&rdquo; becoming an excuse for all manner of criminal, or even terrorist, outrages;  and fourth, openly encouraged miscegenation.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Re White Human Rights:</p>
<p>Human Right #1,039: Right not to have a television commercial louder than its accompanying television program &hellip; Human Right #114,202: Right not to have a missing pimento in your stuffed green olive &hellip; Human Right #232,941: Right not to be invaded and overrun, if you are white &hellip;</p>
<p>Apparently our right not to be invaded and overrun is not quite basic enough for the U.N., and thus did not make it onto its list of &#8220;basic human rights.&#8221; A pity. Judging by the qualifications of the above &#8220;U.N. experts on human rights,&#8221; they appear to be overpaid by half.<br>

		<p>This is rather odd, to say the least.  Leftists are criticizing the new Arizona law, which is almost vertatim the federal law governing illegal immigration enforcement, as &#8220;racist&#8221; and outrageous.</p>
<p>It appears the the feds have the legal and moral authority to enforce whichever laws they choose to enforce.</p>
<p>Interesting interpretation of federal authority.  I would suggest that the populace thus has the authority to selectively set aside the laws defining murder and that we further have the moral authority to deal with the congress accordingly.</p>

		<p>If the U.N. thinks that the Arizona law is a violation of &#8220;human rights&#8221;, then perhaps they should look at Mexico&rsquo;s treatment of their illegal immigrants first. <br>
Michelle Malkin published a great article recently citing the following facts: Being in mexico illegally is a FELONY punishable by two years imprisonment. A second violation leads to a TEN year sentence. Immigrants, legal or not, are not allowed to participate in ANY political activities in Mexico. By law, Mexico will not accept immigrants that &#8220;upset the demographic balance of the Mexican population&#8221; (could you be more racist?). All immigrants to Mexico must prove that they can provide their own medical care, have a job and a minimum amount of money so as not to be a burden to the State. Could you imagine if the U.S. passed a similar law? The leftists, Hispanics and other traitors would go ballistic!<br>
I live in Arizona and I have never been prouder of my state. Now it is time for the rest of the states to start following in our footsteps. I urge all of you to start marching in defense of Arizona and for passage of similar laws in your state (getting the U.S. out of the U.N. would also be a good idea). Don&rsquo;t just write messages on AmRen! We need your help!<br>

<p>Those &#8220;human rights experts&#8221; ought to take a good look at their own countries first and determine whether these provisions are being complied with THERE.</p>
<p>P.S. Isn&rsquo;t it bizarre how countries which have the fewest &#8220;human rights&#8221; are able to produce &#8220;human rights experts&#8221; who are able to go out and scold others  (while not noticing their own conditions at home)?</p>

		<p> &#8220;Yeah, and we also have a little thing called &ldquo;citizenship&rdquo;, which is not conferred on everybody o in the world. &hellip;It has its burdens as well as its benefits. It isn&rsquo;t free, and it isn&rsquo;t universal. <br>
  What do these people think, that we can give US citizen rights  to everyone in the world?  The thinking is bizzare. What do they want   &mdash;   a one-world goverment, with everyone on earth being US citizens? &#8220;<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>The answer is &#8220;Yes!&#8221;  There is a movement in the world, not just here, to abolish the very fact and concept of citizenship.   In leftish circles, that is coming to be considered passé.  Of course, it also aids to break down the  white, western democracies that they hate so much and want to destroy.  I have seen posters promoting this  same idea  in Europe.   (I doubt that anyone is promoting it in China.)  They - the One Worlders - would have just one big world with no borders, in which everybody could come and  go wherever they please. What&rsquo;s yours is mine, and vice versa.</p>
<p>This  happens to be a very attractive concept to those  nationalities who have nothing.  They would love to come and live with you.   If  you have a nice, orderly, prosperous country they would love the opportunity to come and share it with you.   How could you be so selfish and mean as to refuse to share your good fortune with them?   Where is your Christian spirit?   Aren&rsquo;t we supposed to be our brothers&rsquo; keepers? </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s suppose  I am dirt poor, living in a hut, and you are wealthy, living in a mansion,  I would be delighted to share your home and bank account!   After all, aren&rsquo;t we all God&rsquo;s children?  Shouldn&rsquo;t we be willing to  be nice and share what we have with one another?   </p>
<p>Is there something wrong with that doctrine?   Well, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with it, <i> from THEIR point of view! </i></p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll play on your sympathy for all they can get. And if that doesn&rsquo;t work, they&rsquo;ll  play on your  guilt.</p>
<p>Actually, these UN  officials  are no different than an Arab begger with a bowl. He&rsquo;ll pitch to your sympathy first;  and if you still don&rsquo;t give, he&rsquo;ll curse you out and  try to shame you or embarass you.</p>

		<p>WHAT ABOUT ARIZONIANS&rsquo; RIGHTS! Where is the concern for those people who may not want to be inundated by an endless flow of illegal immigrants in the first place. Legitimate Arizona citizens who do not appreciate the huge amount of crimes perpetrated by some of those illegal immigrants. What about THEIR human rights. l. . the right to enjoy their lives without the crimes and social problems illegals refuse to leave behind when crossing the border.</p>

		<p>Well blow me!  So the human rights brigade are now once again advocating the the US laws as set up in agreeemnet with the US Constitution and as applying in most Western countries are to be broken.  How about copying the new (since 1994) South African Government&rsquo;s example where Zimbabwean blacks who have moved to South Africa as they are starving in that once food-rich country, Rhodesia/Zimbabwe when it was run by a government of European stock before the terrorist Mugabe grabbed power with British help, only to find that they are not wanted by the ordinary South Africans (black) people and are hacked to death with machetes or set on fire to force them out. &#8220;They are stealing our jobs!&#8221;<br>
 Never happened under Apartheid except when enacted by the Marxist terrorists that have since grabbed power, again with the West&rsquo;s help to force the blacks to support the terrorists&rsquo; cause.<br>
It is a crazy World that only, in my opinion, a big war can solve where millions are killed again.  So sad.  The World is overpopulated especially the Third World that will not work.</p>

<p>It is true that everyone has such a right - but they do not have the right to do so at the expense of taxpayers.  One of the problems with government education is that everybody has different ideas what should be taught and there is no &#8220;one size fits all&#8221;.  There are thousands of tribes, ethnicities and languages in the world.  Would the above &#8220;experts&#8221; demand that U.S. schools have special programs for each of those thousands of groups?  Sounds like it.</p>

		<p>I wonder what these &ldquo;experts&rdquo; think about the way Mexico treats illegal immigrants within its own borders</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just Mexico, ALL countries EXCEPT the U.S. U.K. Oz and France treat illegals as the criminals they are but in America and U.K. they get free STUFF</p>

		<p>The UN is one of the worst anti-people organizations in the world when it gets right down to the brass tacks, rife with know-it-all types who are from failed countries, yet they somehow believe only they are smart enough to sit high above humanity and dictate what we all should do.</p>
<p>But the world nowadays is filled with radical types who are delusional, believing themselves to be privileged beings.</p>
<p>Couple the above haughty fools with the same kind in the banking industry who are also anti-working people bigots who are secure in their beliefs that only they deserve bailouts and huge incomes, because they are so much a cut above whom they consider as nothing more than rabble in the streets.  This is the one world government types who despise nationalism, patriotism and prefer to throw all the racial rabble into one big heap, while they&rsquo;re above it all in their estates and gated communities.  They&rsquo;ll tolerate the socialists so long as they group people together in order to make a larger consumer base.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m wondering where they will all wind up.  They somehow are blind to history. If it tells us anything it is that self annointed fools wind up dancing at the end of a rope or being persons of interest of one firing squad or another.</p>
<p>And, it&rsquo;s all coming apart.  While Greece is in the streets fighting to save socialism, the contagion has spread to Ireland where, unlike the US, they&rsquo;re taking to the streets to protests bailing out banks.  <a href="https://tinyurl.com/2bf4lk7" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2bf4lk7</a></p>
<p>There are riots beginning now in Romania as well.  Spains just reduced benefits by 5%.  Look for other cuts and probably what will turn out to be the worst rioting of all.  The UK&rsquo;s GDP to debt is every bit as great as Greece, but, like the US, they can print useless money for a while, so, like the stimulus here, &#8220;monetizing&#8221; will forestall their upheaval for a bit longer&hellip;.but not much.</p>
<p>And, finally, the US will have another collapse&hellip;.probably this year&hellip;.only this time the repercussions will be far, far greater.</p>
<p>So, I would tell the high and mighty at the UN they&rsquo;ve been paying too much attention to the fine print and are unaware of the important things around them.  Why wory about pushing propaganda on false charges about somebody&rsquo;s rights in the US when they&rsquo;re soon going to be out of a job at the UN?  Or, maybe they can switch over and serve on the committee dedicated to bare survival, but I doubt it.  The money just wont be there.</p>
<p>For years various conservative groups the UN regards as enemies have been trying to get the useless UN disbanded.  But it looks like their favorite leftists are the ones who will see them crash and burn, because of their perverted leftist tactics that so desired a new world order of Marxist robots.</p>
<p>As some have said, &#8220;We won&rsquo;t have to do anything but wait and watch and the leftist and their policies will destroy themselves without anyone else even lifting a finger.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>Who cares WHO or WHAT GROUP criticizes Arizona? The reality is 12 OTHER STATES are contemplating similar legislation! The tide is turning with a vengeance. American citizens are totally outraged over illegal immigration and demand it be stopped!</p>
<p>Check the story on today&rsquo;s MSNBC: &#8220;U.S. SPLIT OVER IMMIGRATION LAW&hellip;&#8221; Then read the posts&hellip; access it at the end of the story screen. Better yet, sign up (it&rsquo;s free) to Newsvine and add your own comments. Time to tell the liberals in favor of illegal immigration&hellip; to &#8220;stuff it.&#8221; We all need to make our anger heard. With comments on news blog sites, on Newsvine, and most importantly&hellip; via the Ballot Box on November 2nd.</p>
<p>Time for voters to KICK OUT any politician pandering to La Raza, speaking out against immigration enforcement. Refusing to heed the will of the American citizenry. Let the political hacks then turn to La Raza for their next political career. Preferably one i Mexico!</p>

		<p>The UN harshly criticizes the US and demands that we continue to take in uneducated, diseased, low IQd refugees from the worst places of the world yet turns its back on genocide committed against Whites in Zim and SA.</p>
<p>RefugeeResettlementWatch.com reports:</p>
<p>UN setting the stage for increased Somali resettlement to the West</p>
<p>3 May 2010 – Thousands of Somalis fleeing the violence in their homeland are expected to cross into neighbouring countries this year where they will add to already overcrowded and under-resourced conditions in camps, the deputy United Nations chief for refugees said today.</p>
<p>The US State Department has admitted over 80,000 Somali refugees to the US&hellip; in 2008 family reunification was suspended because of widespread immigration fraud  revealed through DNA testing.  That specific program has not yet been reopened (that we know of), but will be soon. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, thousands of Somali Muslims continue to be resettled by the State Department as I write this. We recently learned that we will be taking 6000 Somalis this year from one camp in Uganda and as many as 11,000-13,000 total from around the world&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/23cjep5" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/23cjep5</a></p>
<p>And from John PM (all the best to you for the info):  </p>
<p>&ldquo;In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, as such: <br>
(a) Killing members of the group; <br>
(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; <br>
(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part..&#8221;</p>
<p>Is this not what is happening to Whites in SA?  I bought a subscription to Praag ($10) through the link on AmRen&rsquo;s home page  &mdash;  for which I received a personal reply and letter from Dan Roodt himself.</p>
<p>Praag reports on rampant black-on-White murders  &mdash;  which include tortures, hackings, slashings, dismemberments, violent gang rapes on men, women and little children.</p>
<p>I strongly suggest everyone, if possible, donate the 10 bucks to Praag and Spread the Word to anyone you know,  anyone who will listen  &mdash;  the stories I read in there are harrowing  &mdash;  and the writes say these murders are daily occurrences.</p>
<p>Yet according to the UN and the media, genocide of Whites by blacks is not worth reporting and is not worth looking into  &mdash;  far more important is opposing and speaking out against those who wish to protect the sovereignty of the United States.</p>
<p>Is there any doubt as to what the NWO has in mind for Whites?</p>

		<p>MSNBC: &ldquo;U.S. SPLIT OVER IMMIGRATION LAW</p>
<p><br>
I&rsquo;d like to point out that is a lie.  The US is not &#8220;split&#8221; over immigration.  There is broad, bipartisan consensus, among all racial groups (but one) that want the immigrants gone.</p>
<p>That one is, of course, mestizos.  And the only thing the are interested in is protecting the drug trade.</p>
<p>Videos of recent protest events reveals the truth.  Not one face that isn&rsquo;t a mestizo.</p>
<p>The groups trying to manipulate Americans to accept &#8220;diversity&#8221; have failed.  Soon, people will start to be quite vocal that the media isn&rsquo;t portraying the truth about this.</p>
<p>Notice the next step the media is taking with that movie &#8220;Machete&#8221;?  They can&rsquo;t trick people any longer into wanting these people here so they are now trying to intimidate us to not do anything about it.  </p>

<p>This is excellent news for white Southerners. If everyone has the right to learn about their cultural heritage, as the UN experts have declared, then white Southern children have the right to be taught about their ancestors in public schools. They should learn about their ancestors who fought in the War for Southern Independence. They should learn about their cultural heroes such as Robert E. Lee, Nathan B. Forrest, Stonewall Jackson, and Jefferson Davis.</p>
<p>Those who defend Southern monuments and the confederate flag, should take their case to the United Nations, and get the UN on record defending their cultural rights. White British Southerners constitute a cultural minority in America, that traces its roots to Colonial America. Having been in America for 400 years, they have the right to be called an indigenous people. They should put their case before the UN. This is an idea that is so crazy, it might just work.</p>

<p>As in a Shakespearian tragedy, the good are destroyed with the evil  &mdash;  which is the height of tragedy.</p>
<p>The lefties and their unworkable, anti-human nature politics  WILL implode as they finally did in the old Soviet Union  &mdash;  but not without great violence and massive bloodshed of innocent men, women and children.</p>
<p>Professor Rummel reports in Death by Government:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Probably 61,911,000 people, 54,769,000 of them citizens, were murdered by the Communist Party  &mdash;  the government  &mdash;  of the Soviet Union. </p>
<p>Old and young, healthy and sick, men and women, and even infants and infirm, were killed in cold-blood. They were not combatants in civil war or rebellions, they were not criminals. Indeed, nearly all were guilty of &hellip; nothing.</p>
<p>But the key to it all can be disclosed here: Marxism.</p>
<p> This was not just a seizure of power and change of leadership, but a revolutionary transformation in the very nature and world-view of governance. It was the creation &hellip; an utterly cold-blooded, social engineering view of the state&rsquo;s power over its people&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/22pvhbo" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/22pvhbo</a></p>
<p>The riots we&rsquo;re seeing in Greece, Ireland and other countries is just the beginning and the unrest will soon be world-wide, there is no other course of action.</p>
