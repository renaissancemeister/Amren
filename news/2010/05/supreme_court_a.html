<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/37318753/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/">Supreme Court Allows Black Firefighter Lawsuit</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jesse J. Holland, MSNBC, May 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Supreme Court ruled Monday that a group of African Americans did not wait too long to sue Chicago over a hiring test they challenged as discriminatory, freeing them to collect a lower court judgment.</p>
<p>It is the second time in as many years that the high court has tackled discrimination in testing within the firefighting ranks. In a landmark case last year, the Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision said New Haven, Conn., violated white firefighters&rsquo; civil rights, throwing out an exam in which no African-Americans scored high enough to be promoted to lieutenant or captain.</p>
<p>In Monday&rsquo;s opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the court that the applicants&rsquo; lawsuit over a city of Chicago test used to weed out potential firefighter trainee applicants was not too late.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, the Supreme Court affirmed that job-seekers should not be denied justice based on a technicality,&#8221; said John Payton, president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., who argued the case. {snip}</p>
<p><b>Second cutoff score</b></p>
<p>Anyone who scored 64 or below was deemed not qualified. But the city set a second cutoff score of 89 points.</p>
<p>Officials told applicants who scored below 89 but above 64 that although they passed the test, they likely would not be hired because of the large number of people who scored 89 or above. The majority of those in the top-scoring group were white; only 11 percent were black.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Judge agrees with black applicants</b></p>
<p>A U.S. District judge agreed with the black applicants. After an eight-day trial, the federal judge ordered the city to hire 132 randomly selected African American applicants who scored above 64. The court also ordered the city to count up the backpay and divide it among the rest of the applicants.</p>
<p>The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago overturned that decision.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>City officials and business groups argue that the court&rsquo;s decision allowing the black firefighter lawsuit and judgment will cause a host of legal problems for them, including opening them to lawsuits claiming unintended discrimination &#8220;for practices they have used regularly for years.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The case is Lewis v. Chicago, 08-974.<br>

		<p>Steve Sailer made a good point today about cases like these   &mdash;   He thinks that arguments about Rand Paul&rsquo;s opposition to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 are a red herring, because that&rsquo;s arguing a 1960s paradigm in a 2010s world.  Instead, it is the use of &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; which we should be focused on, because it&rsquo;s affecting our people, right here and right now, not people of 40-50 years ago.</p>

		<p>One would think that the smarter the firefighter the better equipted they are to save lives and property. But hey, in this &#8220;kumbia&#8221; country even the dumb under achievers need good jobs too, with the help of lawyers. What ever happend to &#8220;The best man&#8221; for the job?</p>

		<p>No big deal, just the latest evidence of minority inability to measure up to whatever the standard is. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that they passed the test. Others passed with higher grades. That&rsquo;s life.</p>

		<p>This is typical of how the left skews the news,saying Justice Scalia wrote for the court saying it was not too late to bring suit. This implies he was ruling in favor of the law suit, which he was not. He merely said they could bring suit. Not that he was ruling on the outcome of the suit. Knowing his record I would bet a dollar to a doughnut if the high court rues on whether they could deny them admission due to poor scores he would rule for the city.</p>

		<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, this is NOT evidence that the court is anti-white or anything like that.  They weren&rsquo;t supposed to determine if the lawsuit is stupid, but only if it&rsquo;s too late for there to be a lawsuit in the first palace.</p>

		<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t need no stinkin qualifications, they are entitled.</p>
<p>There was a case in California where a black law grad failed the Bar exam several times.  He sued alleging that the Bar exam was biased and discriminatory against blacks. He lost, but that was several years ago.  He would probably win today.</p>

		<p>I think the bigger problem is all these cities that seem to employ practically zero whites. Diversity is a one way street. Speaking as a &#8216;race realist&rsquo;, I suspect they might be better off hiring black firemen, rather than old Chinese women or even white men.  </p>

		<p>This particular test was given in 1995. Most of those folks have moved on from that time or ARE TOO OLD TO DO THE JOB NOW! There is money involved here too. A settlement is reached? About $6,000 per applicant or test taker.</p>

		<p>The fire don&rsquo;t care what skin color you are.  It will be defeated, and lives and property saved, only by those persons who possess the physical and mental skills to get the job done.</p>
<p>I expect that the rate of properties lost that could have been saved, and the percentage of lives lost that likewise could have been saved, will go up in Chicago as a result. By all means, let us not hire people on the basis of their knowledge and skills!  Welcome to the new, bizarro America!</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s surprising that under Mayor Richard M. Daley that the Chicago Fire Department still uses any kind of test to determine if a person is qualified for any City job.  He said at one time tht &#8220;I&rsquo;m 100% behind Affirmative Action.&#8221;  You hardly see a white face in any City job with the exception of the Fire and Police departments.  Don&rsquo;t hold your breath waiting for the white population to voice a complaint against the &#8216;status quo&rsquo; because if it doesn&rsquo;t concern them, they don&rsquo;t care.  It is really a joke.  As to counting on any white Aldermen to raise objections to the City&rsquo;s racial set-asides, forget it.  A <br>
Black or Hispanic could be missing an arm or a leg and they&rsquo;d still pass a physical exam for fireman in this land of Oz.</p>

Exactly!
Who says we have to look only to Chicago?
It is the oldest trick of lefties: They always chose the borders of the area so that they can blame whitey. Hello Liberals, WAKE UP! White people make only 8% of the world. Why are you always against the white minority?
