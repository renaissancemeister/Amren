	<p>A SPECIAL taskforce will track down hundreds of women nationwide who may be infected with HIV after sleeping with acrobat Godfrey Zaburoni.</p>
<p>Some of the 18 concerned people who rang a Queensland Health hotline after the call was put out to find women who had unprotected sex with the HIV-positive Zimbabwean man, were men who had relationships with women he had slept with.</p>
<p>Others were the women themselves, and health authorities and police expect that number to rise, saying Mr Zaburoni could have infected hundreds.</p>
<p>A Queensland Health spokeswoman said many some concerned people may have opted to go straight to their own doctor for testing.</p>
<p>Those who did call the 13HEALTH number after the national appeal was launched yesterday were referred to the Queensland Health Aids unit.</p>
<p>Authorities yesterday renewed their appeal for Mr Zaburoni&rsquo;s sexual partners to come forward as he fronted court on two charges of grievous bodily harm and malicious acts intended to cause grievous bodily harm, after a woman who tested positive to HIV made a complaint against him.</p>
<p>Police allege Mr Zaburoni, 32, had given them the names of 12 other women he said he had sex with.</p>
<p>At least five are from NSW, including the former Australia&rsquo;s Got Talent contestant&rsquo;s girlfriend, who is said to be in shock.</p>
<p>But Regional Crime Co-ordinator Detective Superintendent Dave Hutchinson admits the number of sexual partners Mr Zaburoni had since moving to Australia in 1997 could be higher.</p>
<p>When asked if the number could be in the hundreds Det Supt Hutchinson said: &#8220;True.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are aware of a number of women we believe had unprotected sex with him but there could well be many others,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the women that have been identified certainly were very short-term relationships.</p>
<p>&#8220;So there could be any number of women out there like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Det Supt Hutchinson said more charges could follow as Mr Zaburoni&rsquo;s sexual partners came forward.</p>
<p>He said Mr Zaburoni could face life in prison if convicted.</p>
<p>Mr Zaburoni&rsquo;s sexual partners are urged to contact the Queensland Health hotline 13HEALTH (1343 2584) and Crime Stoppers 1800 333 000.</p>

		<p>The Australian government (politicians) are to blame if any of these women become infected with AIDS.  Common sense and science (facts, data, &amp; logic) clearly tell us that one should never, never, never have sex with Africans, or with anyone who has previously had sex with Africans, because of the extremely high rate of STD&rsquo;s.  Yet, this information is hidden from the general public, because it is considered &#8220;racist.&#8221;  Withholding critical health information for the purpose of a political-social utopian fantasy is criminal and evil. Importing via immigration disease-infected Africans into your homeland is likewise pure evil.<br>

		<p>I know they don&rsquo;t want to embarrass the victims by publishing their names and pictures, but what about other potential victims who slept with these women? Shouldn&rsquo;t the health authorities feel a responsibility to inform all possible infected people?</p>
<p>This is a case where following AmRen can save your life. These stories often appear here from all around the world. When mainstream media carry these stories it&rsquo;s mostly reported as a local event. The Toronto newspapers didn&rsquo;t carry this story. People won&rsquo;t appreciate the larger picture and won&rsquo;t understand the risks involved in having sex with blacks. </p>

		<p>If any of his &#8220;partners&#8221; were White, then they got exactly what they deserved and get a &#8220;aww too bad&#8221; from me.  One said with complete apathy as to their plight.  As for this African AIDS factory, castration followed by deportation should be the judgement.<br>
As for the White race traitors who put themselves at risk in the zeal to fornicate with a black, they should be denied treatment and be given a Saturday night special with on bullet and a wink and a nod.  With the injunction that if not self administered, help in doing so would be happily supplied.</p>

		<p>What do you want to bet the majority of the women who slept with him were white? They were likely white women seduced by the power and charm so kindly bestowed upon him by our sick, twisted media simply because he is African. I am absolutely disgusted when I see stories like this but I must say that I feel very little sympathy for the women that willfully engaged in unprotected sex with this African. I do, however, feel very sorry for any of their sex partners who probably didn&rsquo;t even know their partners had relations with him. </p>

		<p>I hope that all those involved will be saved by modern medicine and asome heartfelt prayers. I also hope that they have learned a valuable lesson: do not have unprotected sex with anybody, let alone with an African.</p>

		<p>The article does not state the African fellow has AIDS. The article does not state how many of his female sex contacts have become HIV positive. The article does not state how many of his female sex contacts have Aids. This would be a perfect test of the dubious theory that HIV causes AIDS.</p>

		<p>Incidents like this have happened too many times for people not to realize the risks. Who doesn&rsquo;t know that promiscuity leads to disease? Not just AIDs but other STDs as well. The acrobat is definitely guilty. But the &#8220;victims&#8221; share the blame because they engaged in behaviors they knew were dangerous and immoral. Particularly given what we know concerning race and AIDs rates.</p>

		<p>I remember a time when U.S. health departments would attempt to ascertain sexual contacts of those with STD&rsquo;s and then contact the endangered.  All that changed when the gay lobby halted it all for fear people would find out someone had AIDS and brand him as homosexual.  They have fought so hard to destigmatize HIV that ads now proclaim that contraceptives don&rsquo;t prevent &#8220;HIV or STD&rsquo;s&#8221;, as though the former isn&rsquo;t an STD when caught through sex!  <br>
Not allowing the public the knowledge that blacks  &mdash;  Africans in particular  &mdash;  have higher rates of all STD&rsquo;s is certainly a disservice, to say the least.  How many silly young white women end up diseased, raped, robbed, beaten, and murdered because they hear only liberal claptrap regarding low-class black men?</p>

		<p>That this grusome-looking spectacle was able to bed several hundred white women is testement to the degeneration of certain people within our race.</p>
<p>They got what they asked for, and rather than feel pitiy for them, they should be condemned for helping to spread a fatal disease that is common mostly among blacks all over the world, and the high rate of infection among blacks is common knowledge to people everywhere.</p>
<p>Too, I wonder how many of them had mulattoes by this primitive, and if the disease was passed to them?</p>

		<p>When I was in Oz about 8 years back I saw no blacks other than Aborigines, and they&rsquo;re not really what you could consider black-they&rsquo;re more of a breed of their own. There were virtually no blacks there, but thanks to their government&rsquo;s insane changes to the immigration policy, they now have a passle of Africans and other third world blacks. Not an insurmountable amount, as the country is still overwhelmingly White, but enough to cause plenty of trouble and most of them are still on the dole after living there for several years.</p>
<p>Blacks were a relatively new experience for them and they&rsquo;re learning the hard way. I have some friends there that used to feel sorry for blacks and would comment on how we treated them. Now they&rsquo;re telling me I was right and they wish their government had never let any in to begin with.</p>
