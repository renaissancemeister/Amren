<h1>Study: White and Black Children Biased Toward Lighter Skin</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CNN, May 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nearly 60 years after American schools were desegregated by the landmark Brown v. Board of Education ruling, and more than a year after the election of the country&rsquo;s first black president, white children have an overwhelming white bias, and black children also have a bias toward white, according to a new study commissioned by CNN.</p>
<p>Renowned child psychologist and University of Chicago professor Margaret Beale Spencer, a leading researcher in the field of child development, led the study. She designed the pilot study and led a team of three psychologists: two testers to execute the study and a statistician to help analyze the results.</p>
<p>Her team tested 133 children from schools that met very specific economic and demographic requirements. In total, eight schools participated: four in the greater New York City area and four in Georgia.</p>
<p>In each school, Spencer tested children from two age groups: 4 to 5 and 9 to 10.</p>
<p>Since this is a pilot study and not a fully funded scientific study, the sample size and race selection were limited. {snip}</p>
<p>Spencer&rsquo;s test aimed to re-create the landmark Doll Test from the 1940s. Those tests, conducted by psychologists Kenneth and Mamie Clark, were designed to measure how segregation affected African-American children.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the new study, Spencer&rsquo;s researchers asked the younger children a series of questions and had them answer by pointing to one of five cartoon pictures that varied in skin color from light to dark. The older children were asked the same questions using the same cartoon pictures, and were then asked a series of questions about a color bar chart that showed light to dark skin tones.</p>
<p>The tests showed that white children, as a whole, responded with a high rate of what researchers call &#8220;white bias,&#8221; identifying the color of their own skin with positive attributes and darker skin with negative attributes. Spencer said even black children, as a whole, have some bias toward whiteness, but far less than white children.</p>
<p>&#8220;All kids on the one hand are exposed to the stereotypes&#8221; she said. &#8220;What&rsquo;s really significant here is that white children are learning or maintaining those stereotypes much more strongly than the African-American children. Therefore, the white youngsters are even more stereotypic in their responses concerning attitudes, beliefs and attitudes and preferences than the African-American children.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Spencer was also surprised that children&rsquo;s ideas about race, for the most part, don&rsquo;t evolve as they get older. The study showed that children&rsquo;s ideas about race change little from age 5 to age 10.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Spencer said the study points to major trends but is not the definitive word on children and race. It does lead her to conclude that even in 2010, &#8220;we are still living in a society where dark things are devalued and white things are valued.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Trust me, it doesn&rsquo;t take a Ph.D. to figure out that white kids are going to value people who look like them, because that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re most familiar with.  Black kids as young as 5 years old call kids darker than themselves the &#8220;n&#8221; word on the school playground - I know this because it happened to a kid in my class when I was teaching in a predominantly black school.  Black children are taught from infancy that lighter is better.  White kids often have no interaction with black kids when they are younger than 5, so they simply respond most favorably to what looks like Mom or Dad or sibling.</p>

		<p>If the bias mirrors reality then the bias exhibits sound reasoning and is nothing to be concerned about. I would only be concerned if the white students failed to see blacks as being less intelligent for that would contradict the all too obvious behavioral differences.<br>
This study proves that the racial equality dogma does not override what is obvious to the youngsters. Look how black students will tease the smarter blacks who try to do well in school as &#8220;acting white&#8221; which is proof that even they, all on their own equate smartness to whiteness. If one is going to argue whites are unjustly biased towards blacks then you must also accept that blacks are also just as biased towards blacks.</p>

		<p>This is hogwash and everyone who pushes knows and has known that for years. The preference for fairness that children exhibit comes from neonotony. It is likes preference for like.  Children themselves are fairer when they are younger than they are when they are oldrer and mothers are usually fairer than fathers (they evolved to be as they would appear more attractive as more likely  potential mothers in potential fathers eyes). Other neotenies are things like full lips small nose bridges and big behinds - will black people bann all those characteristics and shun them in their prospective partners. It just adds child abuse by its pushers to their existing crimes of genocide. </p>

		<p>These kinds of studies have been going on for years, and nothing is new about these latest observations.  Regardless of race, children find dark skin and features less attractive and more threatening that light features. This preference is nearly universal throughout the world.  Look at Mexico.  Mexicans would prefer to look like Caucasians, especially Nordic types. It&rsquo;s sad in a way.</p>
<p>I have brown hair and eyes, but I prefer women with fair skin, blonde/red hair and blue/green eyes.  And so many people, regardless of race, also have this preference.  Why?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more than cultural, I suspect, because it&rsquo;s so universal and deeply ingrained in so many cultures.  Perhaps there is something in our evolutionary development, something in the evolved brain, perhaps in the genes themselves, that selects for this preference.  And, like any behavior that persists so universally, there has to be some kind of positive selection that is ultimately related to our very survival.</p>

<p>Yes, but don&rsquo;t forget about the majority of people who like vanilla ice cream and a minority who like chocolate.  And if that injustice isn&rsquo;t enough for you, how can we reduce the number of people who like Angel Food Cake and the increase the number who like Devil&rsquo;s Food Cake, because of the unacceptable disparity?</p>
<p>There are still so many important things in this world that require attention in order to create true fairness and justice it sometimes seems overwhelming to many of us.</p>
<p>Too, don&rsquo;t forget!  Never mention a black hole in space, because it is racist.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d also add the Hindu story of the god Shiva and godess Parvati, who gets rebuked for her dark skin color, then underwent penance to get lighter skin from Brahma, the supreme deiety. If the gods of the oldest extant religion even prefered lighter skin and if the supreme god of the universe could even relate to that, then love of lighter skin and disdain of dark skin is not just skin-deep. I got a feeling that a genetic connection exists for it.</p>

		<p>Excuse me lady, but the same thing goes on in India, China, Korea, the Arab world and even in Latin America, and most of those preferences predate contact with white civilizations.  Even ancient Egyptian paintings often show the queens as lily white, even as the men are darker in hue.  Ancient Japanese paintings idealize a white complexion.  Upper crust Arabs and Indians take dark skin as a sign of field workers.</p>
<p>Putting that aside, I wonder if this researcher had considered the question that greater exposure to blacks reinforces negative views of them among white kids.  </p>
<p>Before I moved to a big urban area, I had no experience with black people and had no prejudices based on skin color at all.  Since moving here, I have found that 2-3% of the black people I&rsquo;ve met are good, and the rest drop precipitously in quality to the point that if I see any group of black men greater than one, I wonder if I&rsquo;m going to get jumped.</p>

		<p>Doesn&rsquo;t take a Ph.D. to see the many problems with this &#8220;pilot study.&#8221;  Even a marginal researcher knows to control for confounding variables.  Think the kids (black and white) aren&rsquo;t influenced by the images of &#8220;black culture&#8221; they are exposed to on a daily basis via media and affirmative action?  Think Rap, Hip Hop, Gansta, street punks, and mug shots don&rsquo;t induce a negative take on blacks?  Maybe those children already know the really important fact; Black means danger to anyone small or weak.  Like the &#8220;global warming science&#8221;, this is just about the agenda.  But, I bet Margaret will get a ton of research money from NIMH for the real deal. </p>

		<p>Lightness has been preferable throughout the ages, in every known culture.  Note that the word &#8220;fair&#8221; means both pale and pretty.  Also note that the dark people of the world are more crime prone.  <br>
Tune into the TV reality police detective programs, and you&rsquo;ll see that about 85% of the suspects are dark-skinned black men.  And you can bet that the shows&rsquo; producers are not trying to be racist!</p>

		<p>I would agree with the with the other posters that this goes beyond just the blacks. All races seem to want to appear more white. As I have mentioned before I live in Medellin Colombia 3 months a year. About 10-20% of colombians are white as I am, and this 20% runs and owns everything.Many natural blondes with blue/green eyes. I wish I could show you pics of my novia (girlfreind). But of the other 80% a huge percentage of the darker skin natural black haired girls dye thier hair blond or dirty blond or have blond hi lites to look like gringas (white women). Some of them, most of which have natural beauty anyway do look better,, those that just have a little indian in them. But it really looks funny to see a darker indian girl with light blonde hair, and its a lot of them. Why do they do it,,, because the men flock to the blondes. If they stay black haired they get fewer boyfreinds. Just made this point to show that they all, male and female, seem to prefer the white look. KF </p>

<p>I can think of at least one prominent American for whom lighter skin does NOT have positive connotations: President Obama, who recently self-identified not as &#8220;Biracial&#8221; on his Census form, but simply as &#8220;BLACK.&#8221; </p>
<p>Which, it just occurred to me, is not only insulting to the white, non-abandoning side of Obama&rsquo;s parentage, but also happens to be an outright LIE. When asked a direct question on a federal document, the current POTUS actually LIED. </p>

		<p>Whether modern racially mixed citizens or politicians identify strongly with their darker side is besides the point. In our current dark age a great deal of social and economic benefit can be derived from being from a protected racial group. </p>
<p>But on the other side of the looking glass, away from the anti-White Bizarrostan that the USA and Western Europe have become light skin is still preferred over dark. </p>
<p>When I traveled in Southeast Asia in 2007 I noticed a number of salons that offered skin-lightening creams and in some cases some procedure to lighten armpits, hair, etc. On the TV in my hotel rooms I would channel surf and notice that the news anchors were always the fairest of the fair that could be obtained in that society. The same goes for actresses and actors on film and tv dramas. <br>
In the Philippines the celebrities all look mixed race. At least at some distant point mixed in with Conquistadors I suppose. </p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t worry black America, the gov&rsquo;t and main stream media are doing there best to change this outcome. At one time the perfect beauty was considerec pale, blonde hair, and blue eyes. Now the preferred is called an &#8220;exotic beauty&#8221;. Meaning black or brown hair, brown eyes, and bronze skin. Our white children pay big bucks to tan or darken themselves, dye their hair black, put in hair extensions. They glamorize black life, like rappers and black actors, and lead them to relate wealth with being african-american and little to none moral values. If I see one more young white male wearing their jean shorts around their hips and trying to become the local thug or drug dealer, I&rsquo;m gonna flee this black and hispanic dominated society and head to the whitest place I can find. If something don&rsquo;t change soon and awaken white america, I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ll be the next south africa. It may already be too late.</p>

		<p>Leave it to the Communist News Network (CNN) to conduct such an idiotic survey. Perhaps they could try to find out why so many  black men have a bias towards lighter skinned women when it comes to choosing a spouse. After all, it can&rsquo;t be their faults, it must be our evil, racist culture which associates lighter skin with &#8216;positive attributes&rsquo; amd darker skin with negative ones. </p>

		<p>I wonder about the strength of the preference for blue-eyed blonds. Here in San Francisco, it seems like a large percentage of the young white men are dating Chinese women, rather than the attractive blond women who also live here. </p>
<p>This is another big reason why we can&rsquo;t allow immigration from Asia, regardless of their intelligence and low crime rates. Too many white men can&rsquo;t seem to resist petite, squeaky-voiced women who pretend to look up to them. Once they&rsquo;re married, the women turn into shrews and expect their white men to provide plenty of spending money. The men don&rsquo;t seem to see it coming, or don&rsquo;t care. Don&rsquo;t they care about having white descendants?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very painful to see this happening; I can&rsquo;t leave the house without seeing it.</p>

		<p>I am a short man.  Any short man can tell you that being short is a significant social disability.  In social interactions men defer to tall men they can &#8220;look up to&#8221; as leaders, but of far greater significance is the overwhelming preference of women for tall men.  Where I differ from the liberals is that I realize that this is wired into the reptilian brain stem.  There is nothing to do about it but play the cards you&rsquo;ve been dealt, as best you can.</p>
<p>Nobody is proposing that the government create laws and vast bureaucratic organizations to address this discrimination against short men, and it would be ridiculous if they did.  But if people have a preference for fair skin this is seen as a justification for more anti-white laws and judicial directives.</p>
<p>As for Spencer&rsquo;s &#8220;landmark Doll Test&#8221;, that was a sham.  Spencer told the court that blacks in segregated schools had a preference for the white dolls.  What he knew but didn&rsquo;t tell the court was that blacks in integrated schools had a stronger preference for white dolls.  I would guess that blacks in majority white schools saw with their own lying eyes that the white kids were better behaved and did better academically, and internalized that fact.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;we are still living in a society where dark things are devalued and white things are valued.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t devalue things because they&rsquo;re dark, but I do devalue bad behavior.  Eighty percent of Black children in America don&rsquo;t have present fathers.  Are we suppose to say that not having a present father is of equal value to having a present father?  </p>
<p>Thirty-three percent of Black men in America are in and out of prison and twelve percent are currently imprisoned.  </p>
<p>Twenty-five percent of Black men in South Africa have admitted to committing rape, and that&rsquo;s only the admitted number, so that means it&rsquo;s [i]at least[/i] twenty-five percent.  </p>
<p>This is a worldwide trend, it crosses national boundaries.  People in India, China, and Iraq have the exact same views of Blacks.  Even the Dominicans who are on average half-Black, view themselves as a separate race from the Haitians, they limit immigration from Haiti because they KNOW that it&rsquo;s not a question of education.  They KNOW that you cannot educate a Haitian into a Dominican.    </p>
<p>The whole idea of race being dark Vs light is a false construct.  If we were all identical with the only difference being melanin in our skin, these statistics wouldn&rsquo;t exist, let alone exist in every place where Black people live.  People don&rsquo;t RAPE because their billfolds are empty, it&rsquo;s ludicrous.  If people raped because their pockets were empty then there would have been an explosion of rape in America during the Great Depression, there WASN&rsquo;T.  There wasn&rsquo;t even an increase in crime.  West Virginia is VERY poor and VERY White and has one of the lowest levels of crime in the nation.  </p>
<p>The modern Liberal view on race assumes any negative stereotypes attached to Blacks is because of their skin color.  While at the same time the modern Liberal assumes that any negative stereotype attached to Whites is fully justified (whether it&rsquo;s true or completely false).  And if [i]there are[/i] negative traits exhibited by Black people in greater numbers, it&rsquo;s because of aforementioned White racism.  So basically if you say Blacks behave badly you&rsquo;re racist, but if you prove Blacks behave badly, then the reason they behave badly is because you&rsquo;re racist.  It&rsquo;s like an endless cycle of illogical thought.  If we&rsquo;re all equal then we&rsquo;re all equally responsible for our own behavior.  Either people are responsible for their own behavior, or they are not.  We can&rsquo;t &#8220;all be equal&#8221; yet when it comes to behavior Blacks behave a certain way because Whites MAKE them behave that way.  </p>
<p>We&rsquo;re led to believe that calling Whites as a race SLAVERS is completely justified even though only 2% of Americans (4.1% of Confederates) owned slaves and many Whites are descended entirely or partly from immigrants who came to the country after slavery ended.  For example, three of my grandparents ancestors were not even in the country during slavery.  Two were Dutch immigrants who came to America in the 1950s and the third was from Russia circa 1900.  Exactly ONE of my grandparents ancestors were even in the country during slavery and he was from a longtime military family, certainly NOT wealthy slaveowners but hard working people (like almost all Whites throughout American history).  So calling Whites &#8220;slaveowners&#8221; when 2% of Americans owned slaves and most of us are not even descended from those 2% is completely justified, even when 500,000 men DIED To free those slaves.  But to call Blacks jailbirds when 33% are CURRENTLY in and out of jail is completely UNJUSTIFIED, or so we&rsquo;re led to believe.  </p>

<p>The subject of mixing with Asians is avoided due to heavily divided opinion. The hypocrisy here has never been fully addressed (i.e., how miscegenation with Asians seems to be tolerated despite a continued antagonism to their presence, and the fact that they&rsquo;re not White).</p>
<p>A possible explanation for your case could simply be that San Francisco has lots of good-looking Asian people. Being blond &amp; blue-eyed doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean the person is attractive.</p>

		<p>To 20 and 24:  While I would prefer whites to marry and have kids with other whites, if I had to pick a non-white woman to marry it would be an Asian.  Their values are more like whites and I find the Asian women more attractive than latinas and blacks.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The overwhemling preference of women for tall men&#8221;-WR the Elder<br>
 I was watching Millionaire Matchmaker the other day. And the self proclaimed expert said that it is easier to find a mate for a 6&rsquo;2&#8221; man $100,000 in debt that it is to find one for a 5&rsquo;2&#8221; man with a net worth of forty million dollars. I told my spouse to quit harping on taking out the trash during the commercial as I was now a far more valuable commodity than when the show began&hellip;</p>

<p>Based on what I have observed, I would not say that the Chinese in SF are especially good-looking; there is a range of looks, from good to bad, with most just average-looking (as with white people). </p>
<p>The Chinese women I see with white men aren&rsquo;t exceptionally attractive; some are pretty, but most are rather ordinary-looking. Their children often look sort of Mexican, but not as dark (which makes sense, since the mestizos are a mixture of Asian (via the Bering Straits) and white.</p>

 &#8220;I wonder about the strength of the preference for blue-eyed blonds. Too many white men can&rsquo;t seem to resist petite, squeaky-voiced women who pretend to look up to them.  Here in San Francisco, it seems like a large percentage of the young white men are dating Chinese women, rather than the attractive blond women who also live here.&#8221; <br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Same in Sweden, which has plenty of blondes.  Yet you see handsome blond men with tiny Oriental  women.  I mean wives (and kids), not girlfriends.  I&rsquo;ve seen that all over Germany, Sweden, Switzerland.  It seems to be the fad!  Strangely, this fascination with Oriental women  (never the reverse)  seems to be limited mainly  to the Nordic countries&hellip;. and the US plus Canada.  (It&rsquo;s rampant in Vancouver.)  I don&rsquo;t see it  happening in France though, where they go for black women instead (unlike elsewhere). </p>
<p>But in NO cases do I see white men dating Moslem women.   That isn&rsquo;t done.  But Moslem men (whatever shade or color) do go after white women. Many of those women convert to Islam. For Moslems, it&rsquo;s a one-way street. They can marry out; but you can&rsquo;t marry in.</p>
<p>(For Moslems), this is a very clever survival strategy. Despite all of  whites&rsquo; foolish boasting about their IQ&rsquo;s,   Moslems  are getting their spawn into your gene pool, but you&rsquo;re not getting yours into theirs.   Who&rsquo;s intelligent here?</p>

I have heard blacks say (and feminists too) that &#8220;The English language is the enemy.&#8221;   Hence, the English language must  be  revised.  The dictionary has to be re-written to purge it of racism and sexism.   Such insanity!</p>
<p>It was a dark day in history<br>
He had dark motives<br>
Black Friday <br>
The Black Plague<br>
black market <br>
black sheep<br>
in a black mood<br>
the black arts, the dark arts<br>
Oh, c&rsquo;mon, lighten up!<br>
&#8220;pearly whites&#8221; are beautiful teeth<br>
blackened teeth are rotted teeth<br>
Devil&rsquo;s  food cake is black<br>
Angel&rsquo;s food cake is white<br>
Black is symbolic  of mourning and sorrow.<br>
The Dark Ages gave way to the En<b>light</b>enment<br>
A &#8220;fair maiden&#8221; is a lovely maiden (never a <br>
dark maiden).<br>
My Fair Lady&hellip; (not  My Dusky Lady)<br>
and so forth&hellip;..<br>
One could go on with  countless examples&hellip;..</p>
<p>But these  race-obsessed fanatics and social engineers reveal the vast depth of  their ignorance. It is not the English language which is at fault.  Nor is it even our culture that is  uniquely guilty of being &#8220;racist&#8221;.  The very same thing holds true in other languages - perhaps all languages.  Some others are much more explicit and less apologetic.  [In French, ones private torment or pet hate is one&rsquo;s Bête Noir&hellip; one&rsquo;s &#8220;black beast&#8221;, not a white beast.  In German, black  also implies bootleg, blackmarket, illegal, contaminated, soiled.]  As pointed out by many other posters, this view of color   &mdash;   light vs. dark   &mdash;   seems to be a universal  trait,  found in many cultures worldwide.</p>
<p>So what are we going to do about it?  As WR pointed out, there are other forms of discrimination which seem to be &#8220;wired in&#8221;.  That against short men;  that against fat people. Even that against ugly people.  How about pimply people?  Are we eventually going to have a Ministry of Enforced Equality that rules against beautiful people and favors ugly people in order to iron out the innate inequalities that Mother Nature imposes on us?  (Shame on her!) &hellip; Even now we are  imposing disabilities and penalties on those who are more intelligent while favoring the sub-intelligent. </p>
<p>&#8220;Equality&#8221; has become the obsession of our age. Our national madness.   It has spread and infected all the white countries.   When Jefferson wrote those prophetic words, &#8220;All men are born equal&#8221;, he meant only&hellip; &#8220;before the law&#8221;. He should have clarified that.   Little did he realize  at the time that he was opening Pandora&rsquo;s Box  and letting out all the  spooks and goblins   &mdash;  - and that they would be tormenting us more than two centuries later.</p>
