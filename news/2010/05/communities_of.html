			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Janie Har, The Oregonian, May 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new report by a coalition of minority groups labels Multnomah County a &#8220;uniquely toxic place&#8221; for people of color, where minorities consistently lag behind whites on nearly every indicator, from poverty rates to jobs.</p>
<p>Conditions in the county are worse than in other parts of the country and continuing to slide, said Ann Curry-Stevens, the lead researcher and an assistant professor of the graduate school of social work at Portland State University.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The document, nearly two years in the making, was commissioned by the Communities of Color Coalition, formed in 2001. Minorities make up more than 26 percent of the population in Portland and the county, according to Census Bureau&rsquo;s 2008 American Community Survey, although the coalition thinks that&rsquo;s an undercount. About 45 percent of students at Portland Public Schools are minorities.</p>
<p>The 152-page report is the first of seven research documents to come. The others will drill into characteristics of specific communities, including immigrant African and Slavic people.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among the findings:</p>
<p>* About 7 percent of whites drop out of high school, compared with 30 percent of minorities.</p>
<p>* Some 62 percent of whites own homes, while only 45 percent of minorities do. A larger percentage of minorities spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing.</p>
<p>* One in three children of color live in poverty, compared with 12.5 percent for whites. The child-poverty rate for Native Americans is 46 percent, for African Americans 41 percent and for African immigrants 56 percent.</p>
<p>* People of color earn about half that of white individuals: $16,636 a year compared with $33,095. Individual income for Latinos is about one-third that of whites.</p>
<p>* Minorities in Multnomah County fare worse on measures such as child poverty, rent burden, incomes and education than minorities in King County, Wash., (home to Seattle) which has a slightly higher number of minorities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Coalition members pleaded with city commissioners to take up the issue, starting with an accurate count and setting aside money for culturally specific solutions. That could be difficult since Mayor Sam Adams is scheduled to release today a proposed one-year budget heavy with cuts.</p>
<p>Commissioners promised to follow up and work with members to come up with a concrete plan in the next two months.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The city of Portland contributed $50,000 and Multnomah County kicked in $100,000 in fiscal year 2009 to help pay for the research. The Communities of Color Coalition  &mdash;  which includes the Native American Youth Family Center, Urban League, Asian Family Center and Latino Network  &mdash;  and Portland State University and the Northwest Health Foundation provided money, too.</p>

		<p>The problem is the whites there have not decided fully yet to just fork their money over to the minorities like they do in other places.</p>
<p><br>
the way minority invasions work is like this:</p>
<p>1.  A few minorities show up for tech jobs or something.<br>
2.  Young white women get the hots for the minority men.<br>
3.  Word gets out in the ghettoes about the good life and the women.  More come.<br>
4.  As the minorities increase, many newcomers either turn to crime or bring their criminal ways with them, because they don&rsquo;t have the skills or the contacts to get real jobs.  Part of the problem is that there are not so many jobs just sitting there for all the minorities who flood in in such huge numbers.<br>
5.  More intelligent whites begin to move out of the neighborhoods that are turning &#8216;dark&rsquo; and then white flight kicks in at some point, leaving a section of the city blighted.<br>
6.  The minorities play the race and helpless card and get every government handout under the sun.  They increase in numbers.  Violence rises.  <br>
7.  Liberals claim whitey is oppressing the newcomers, when the truth is that before the newcomers came, there was only just enough jobs for whatever the local population was.</p>
<p>The cycle continues, because minorities flood the country everywhere.  End of story.</p>

		<p>My question is, &#8220;who created the toxic conditions?&#8221;  The minorities themselves, of course.  Abetted by white paternalism, which must end.</p>
<p>The best thing a majority white state could do would be to reject all federal welfare block grants.  Figure out how much it would cost to take care of the truly handicapped as well as the people over 60 who can not find work and minors without parents.  Everybody else is on their own.  The minorities would eventually move on.  Or, if they stayed, commit crimes, for which they could be jailed and taken off the streets.</p>
<p>We have to get over the idea that a healthy woman, who chooses to have a child by a man she is not married to, who refuses to support her, is &#8220;poor&#8221;.  She isn&rsquo;t poor, stupid perhaps, but not poor.  No healthy person should be given welfare, Medicaid, food stamps, section 8, etc.  For too long we have subsidized bad behavior.  Pay for something and you get more of it.  Failure to work, failure to get married, failure to breed with a decent man should not be grounds to collect welfare.  </p>
<p>Latrina decides to have a baby without benefit of marriage.  Latrina doesn&rsquo;t work.  Baby-daddy doesn&rsquo;t work.  Too bad.  Get a job.  If you can not support a child the child goes to an orphanage.  I mean state-run orphanage, not foster care.  Foster care is another scam.  Latrina hands her kid off to a cousin who becomes a foster parent.  Foster parents get paid by the state for each child they take in.  And no welfare for grandmothers, either.  If Latrina&rsquo;s mother wants to raise her grandbaby then she can, but without the help of the state.  Grandmothers can collect TANF and all the benefits that accrue with TANF by taking on a grandchild.  Nope, if you are healthy you work.  Period.  And don&rsquo;t give me that garbage about &ldquo;the children&rdquo;.  Children without parents would be taken care of, in an orphanage, and would not be used as an income stream for the most useless members of our society.</p>
<p>By eliminating all handouts to healthy people, regardless of their status as parents, we would reduce our tax burden.  Taking care of only the truly handicapped and elderly would probably be much cheaper than taking federal block grants and providing state matching funds.  As the leaching minorities moved on not only would welfare costs decrease, but so would other costs.  The welfare office staff would be radically decreased.  As time went on the amount of crime would slowly decrease as minorities moved on to states still providing welfare benefits.  Police and prison costs would decrease.  Neighborhoods would become nicer.  Cities would become livable again..  The Afro-Americans, Somalis, Cambodians, Mexicans, etc. would leave places like Wisconsin, Minnesota and the Dakotas and relocate to California and New York, states that are lost anyway.</p>
<p>All these studies asking why minorities are messed up are bogus.  We know the reason.  Illegitimacy, failure to go to school, failure to work, failure to obey the law, failure to take any responsibility for your actions, those are the reasons.  Period.  End of discussion.  If we, as a society, stick our heads in the sand and refuse to see the truth the problems will never go away.  If we continue to pay for bad behavior we will just get more bad behavior.  That is how it works.  Look at Europe.  Same thing.</p>
<p>By eliminating subsidies for bad behavior, as well as making the penalties for being and, especially, hiring illegal aliens onerous, people will self-segregate.  The productive will move in and the unproductive will move out.<br>

		<p>How toxic is the Portland area compared to say, Detroit, Cleveland, or Gary? Drive 80/94 in NW Indiana and you can see ads for foreclosed houses in Gary for $5000. In Detroit, you can get better deals than that. All of these cities have black leadership so the problem can&rsquo;t be racism. Granted, these areas can best be described as train wrecks. </p>
<p>I doubt the murder rate in Portland is anywhere near as high as the above mentioned cities. This may be one of those times that the screwy building and land use laws in Oregon may be beneficial.  </p>

		<p>I believe you hit on the answer in the very first statistic.  7% of whites drop out of high school, while 30% of minorities do.  There ya go.  In this country you will not be able to get ahead without an education, and the discipline and perseverance that education demands.  People who don&rsquo;t have brains, discipline and perseverance are not going to make it in this world, period.  And obviously it&rsquo;s the minorities who clearly lack those qualities.</p>

		<p>If the gap between Whites and Blacks is greater in Portland than in other cities, it is likely because Portland has become a fashionable place for educated White liberals to live.  The Whites in Portland are on average a bit smarter than the Whites in, say, Cincinnati, so the gap between them and Blacks is wider.  <br>
     Unfortunately, smarter doesn&rsquo;t always mean wiser.  The Port-o-Whites will blame racism for black ineptitude.</p>

		<p>I am not only a Portlander but I am also a PSU student. Portland is a blue island in a red sea, and because of the large population the state always swings democratic. Given the climate, it will not take long until some misguided action is taken on this. I should hope I am wrong.</p>

<p>There is nothing &#8220;unique&#8221; about Portland.  Minorities &#8220;lag behind&#8221; because their average IQ is significantly lower than the average Whites IQ.  </p>
<p>The article fails to mention that a large number of minorities in a city always creates toxic living conditions for Whites.      </p>

		<p>I live in Seattle and I can say definitively if you&rsquo;re a minority, and you can&rsquo;t make it here in Martin Luther King County or in Communist Portland, you can&rsquo;t make it anywhere.  The white people here will walk up one side of you and down the other if you make any &#8220;racist&#8221; statement, even in private.</p>
<p>And in even this environment they can&rsquo;t make it work.</p>

		<p>The challenge is emes, not genes. Some of the most successful people in the technology business went to no-name schools. What is now missing from the Black community are the values of industry, thrift, sobriety, and piety that it once had, but discarded in the 1960s.  After three generations, most of knowledge of this has disappeared among them. Worse, these virtues are dismissed as &#8216;white&rsquo; and are ostentatiously despised among the colorati. A spiritual revival is required to save them. The Catholic Church did it for the Irish in the US during the later 18th century.  Who will do this for the descendants of the slaves?</p>

<p>150,000 for rubbish work supporting their agenda</p>
<p>Conclusion: About 7 percent of whites drop out of high school, compared with 30 percent of minorities.</p>
<p>This is a toxic environment? Hey everyone got a shot at high school the minorities chose not to take it. They got what they deserved.</p>
<p>Now if I&rsquo;m Italian, which is 9% of the population, and they are mexican which is 46% of the population, why do we call them minorities? </p>

		<p>In the community I live in, &#8220;minorities&#8221; are the overachievers with a high school drop out rate less than 1 percent compared to whites who have a drop out rate around 3 percent. &#8220;Minorities&#8221; also commit less crimes than whites. Guess how that is?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, 99 percent of our &#8220;minorities&#8221; are Asian.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m going to believe that only 30 percent of Blacks and Hispanics drop out of high school.  All social statistics are suspect in this country, the books are cooked to keep the Blacks and Hispanics from looking as bad as they are.</p>

		<p> The Oregonian is a worthless rag.  There are more spelling errors and misplaceced commas in that bird cage liner than a Haitian blog post.  Portland is white and ashamed.  The Rev. Al came up here awhile back to draw attention to the &#8216;injustice&rsquo; of a gun wielding soul brother getting plugged by the cops, and how does our esteemed mayor react to this big city wind bag?  By standing up on his little hind legs and and apologizing to the Rev.  Now that&rsquo;s LEADERSHIP.  <br>
  Here&rsquo;s a perfect example of Portland white liberals: <br>
Tonight I was in a crowded check-out line at a grocery store.  In front of me were 2 white birkenstock liberals with a whole cart full of groceries.  Behind them was me, with only 2 items.  Behind me was an african-american individual with a 40oz of malt liquor.  <br>
The good whites craned their skinny pale necks and told 40oz guy to go ahead in front of them, since they had a cart full of groceries and he had only one item.  <br>
  They gave no consideration to the guy who&rsquo;s getting cut in front of(me).<br>
  I&rsquo;m 6 foot 3 and 300 pounds of angry truck driver who has had situations occur due to african-american individuals cutting in front of me in line.  <br>
  I just let it go, and thought that there was probably a metaphor of something in what I just witnessed. </p>

________________________________________________</p>
<p>Agreed, very well put. Booker T. Washington made a speech in 1896 exactly talking about this. The name of the speech was &#8220;The American Standard.&#8221; He gave it in NYC before the Harvard Alumni Association. It was the best civil rights speech ever made because it emphasized the responsibility needed for the blacks to acheive citizenship. Actually, he was saying that for the blacks to become Americans, they had to pass through the same door as all other groups who were coming to these shores. That they were no longer slaves, but now new immigrants. That speech was a humdinger and puts the mealy mouthed garbage spouted by mlk to shame. Of course, he&rsquo;d be vilified for saying such things if he was alive today.</p>

<p>Wait until next year about January and they&rsquo;ll really have something to whine about. </p>
<p>There will be ZERO jobs, practically.  The only question now is are they going to go home or are they gong to steal and sell dope, because that&rsquo;s the only thing that&rsquo;s going to be available to them.</p>
<p>Going home for these parasites isn&rsquo;t an option.  If they don&rsquo;t drain our social net dry they&rsquo;ll live off taxpayer money in the jails and prisons.</p>

<p>We should write into newspapers like this to offer our congratulations to the over achieving whites of the Northwest and offer our hearty encouragement to blacks to catch up!<br>
