<h1><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/may/14/justice-official-black-panther-polling-case-lacks-/">Official: Black Panther Case Lacks Proof</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jerry Seper, Washington Times, May 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Assistant Attorney General Thomas E. Perez told the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights on Friday there was &#8220;insufficient evidence&#8221; to bring a civil complaint against members of the New Black Panther Party who disrupted a Philadelphia polling place in the 2008 general elections. </p>
<p>Mr. Perez, the only Justice Department official to testify publicly before the commission about the case, said that without sufficient proof that party members or the organization&rsquo;s leader, Malik Zulu Shabazz, directed or controlled unlawful activities at the poll or made speeches to incite or produce lawless action, the complaint &#8220;would have likely failed&#8221; in court. </p>
<p>&#8220;Based on the totality of the evidence and the relevant legal precedent, the acting assistant attorney general made a judgment about how to proceed, choosing to seek an injunction against the only defendant who brought a weapon to the Philadelphia polling place on Election Day and to voluntarily dismiss the other three defendants,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>Mr. Perez said a decision to proceed with claims against one of the New Black Panthers, Minister King Samir Shabazz, and to dismiss the claims against the three others was &#8220;based on the merits and reflects the kind of good faith, case-based assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of claims that the department makes every day. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The commission began an investigation into the New Black Panther Party case after the civil complaint was dismissed, trying to determine if political interference led to the dismissal. Several commission members also have been angry over what they have called the Justice Department&rsquo;s refusal to turn over documents or to make witnesses available to be interviewed. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A written statement by the party conceded that one member  &mdash;  Minister King Samir Shabazz  &mdash;  should not have brought a nightstick to a Philadelphia polling place, but described it as &#8220;an honest error.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;What these Republican witch hunters repeatedly fail to mention is that the individual member involved in the nightstick incident was, in fact, legally penalized,&#8221; said the statement from Minister Hashim Nzinga, chief of staff to party leader Mr. Zulu Shabazz. </p>
<p>Mr. Samir Shabazz, head of the Philadelphia chapter, and Jerry Jackson, a Philadelphia party member, were videotaped outside a polling place wearing black military-style uniforms, which included combat boots and black berets. Mr. Samir Shabazz also brandished a nightstick. </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>None of the defendants answered the charges or made any court appearances, and the Justice Department won the case by default. But the department ultimately chose to drop the allegations against Mr. Jackson, Mr. Zulu Shabazz and the party as a whole. The department did obtain an injunction against Mr. Samir Shabazz prohibiting him from brandishing a weapon outside a polling place until 2012. </p>
<p>Mr. Perez said that while none of the New Black Panther Party members responded to the complaint, that did not absolve the Justice Department of its &#8220;legal and ethical obligations to ensure that any relief sought was consistent with the law and supported by the evidence. </p>

<p>The king should be informed that they don&rsquo;t have democracy in Africa. Maybe he already knows that, and is just doing his part to bring a little bit more of Africa to America.   <br>

		<p>What other evidence do they need?! For pity&rsquo;s sake the duo were caught on video tape threatening and intimidating voters. It goes without saying that if the pair were White and dressed in hoods and white robes they would have been arrested and dragged away (and rightfully so) </p>

<p>What a coincidence. He cant brandish a weapon at a polling place untill Obammy is up for re-election. What&rsquo;s next, no more rapes for rapists untill the next time they have the opportunity?</p>

		<p>Here in Afghanistan I am watching a program called &#8220;Wildest Police&#8221; chases, robberies, crimes and such and when the criminal is White, a picture of him along with his life&rsquo;s details is shown. As you would guess, when the criminal is black, no mention of race is made and when the actual arrest is shown the criminals face is blurred out, but his hands and mode of dress clearly show him to be black and usually it is a violent crime as opposed to the stOOpid crimes done by the whites.</p>

		<p>SKIP #7, I hope you get an opportunity to watch Crime 360 and First 48.  Fully 95% of the criminals are black, and about another 9% Hispanic  &mdash;  and nobody tries to hide the fact.  There&rsquo;s personal info about non-white victims, such as &#8220;He just graduated high school and was the father of three children&#8221; or &#8220;He was an aspiring rap artist&#8221; or &#8220;Kwame [who had a long rap sheet] dreamed of being an FBI agent&#8221;!  I would bet that the liberals are feverishly at work every moment trying to get these shows off the air!  </p>

<p><br>
&#8220;Legally punished&#8221; by whom? Does he mean the member was punished by the NBPP themselves, in an internal matter? </p>
<p>Because he certainly wasn&rsquo;t punished by the DOJ. And from the looks of it, neither he nor any other intimidating NBP militant ever will be. </p>
<p>And this lack of official punishment is no more an &#8220;honest error&#8221; than the Panther who we&rsquo;re expected to believe, honestly erred when he &#8220;forgot&#8221; that he shouldn&rsquo;t have brought his nightstick to the polling station. </p>

<p>Never to be seen again.</p>
<p>Remember when blacks in Florida after the 2000 election &#8216;claimed&rsquo; the highway patrol set up road blocks to prevent them from reaching the polls?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.Even before the last vote had been cast, activists descended upon Florida, claiming a widespread conspiracy to disenfranchise black voters.  Allegations that state troopers put up roadblocks and checkpoints to prevent blacks from voting were rampant. Dogs and hoses were allegedly used to drive black voters from the polls&hellip;. all at the direction of Governor Bush and his sidekick, Secretary of State Katherine Harris.</p>
<p>The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights investigated these allegations over a six-month period beginning in January 2001&hellip; media descriptions of the report did little to dispel the widespread belief among the black electorate that blacks had been systematically targeted for harassment, intimidation, and disenfranchisement.</p>
<p>Despite claims of rampant police intimidation and harassment, the only evidence of law-enforcement &#8216;misconduct&rsquo; consisted of just two witnesses who described their perceptions of the actions of the Florida highway patrol. One of these witnesses testified that he thought it was &#8216;unusual&rsquo; to see an empty patrol car parked outside a polling place&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/24qq5jm" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/24qq5jm</a></p>
<p>Yet VIDEOTAPED evidence showing black thugs at a polling venue swinging nightsticks at White voters is insufficient proof for legal action.</p>
<p>This is an effort to set a precedent to &#8216;allow&rsquo; voter intimidation of Whites in the 2012 election.  </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The department did obtain an injunction against Mr. Samir Shabazz prohibiting him from brandishing a weapon outside a polling place until 2012&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Meaning in 2012 he has government permission to brandish his weapon at Whites outside a polling place.</p>
<p>All the stops will be pulled out to make sure obmam is re-elected  &mdash;  the economy and country aren&rsquo;t quite destroyed yet, not enough Hate Speech legislation has been passed to completely abolish the First Amendment and squelch White complaints, the illegals haven&rsquo;t been amnestied yet, the Supreme Court needs one more lefty to reach the critical 5-4 majority and then there&rsquo;s that pesky Second Amendment that needs to be dealt with.</p>
<p>After that, they&rsquo;ll be in power forever.</p>
<p>Swinging nightsticks at Whites will not only be allowed but sanctioned  &mdash;  that and a lot worse will all approved by the Justice Department.</p>
