<h1>New UK Cabinet Criticized for Lack of Diversity</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sylvia Hui, Google News, May 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Prime Minister David Cameron&rsquo;s three-day-old administration was criticized by activists, the press and even his new coalition partners Friday for picking an almost entirely white, male and upper-class Cabinet despite pledging that his Conservative party would no longer be an old boys club.</p>
<p>Cameron and his deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg of the Liberal Democrats, both grew up in wealthy families and attended elite schools. The 23-member Cabinet they selected after forging a coalition government this week includes Britain&rsquo;s first female Muslim to sit at Cabinet, but only three other women. Only two run government departments, the mark of influence and power.</p>
<p>Twenty-two Cabinet members are white, and at least 16 went to top universities Oxford or Cambridge.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The participation of the left-leaning Lib Dems also raised expectations of more diversity, now dashed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cabinet jobs for well-heeled school chums,&#8221; the Daily Mirror tabloid scoffed. &#8220;A huge step backward,&#8221; wrote gender rights activists in a letter to The Times. &#8220;Awash with buddies, backslapping and in-jokes,&#8221; said a columnist for The Guardian newspaper.</p>
<p>Radio shows were inundated by complaints about the lack of women and minorities in the upper echelons of power.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you look at the negotiating teams, they were male and pale,&#8221; Liberal Democrat lawmaker Lynne Featherstone told the BBC, referring to senior leaders from both parties who cobbled together the power-sharing deal. &#8220;We must do better.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The numbers (of women in government) have certainly gone down, and so has the significance of the posts they hold,&#8221; said Margaret Beckett, who served as foreign secretary under Blair. &#8220;(Cameron&rsquo;s) rhetoric has been that we need to bring more women into the administration, but his decisions have not matched that.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sayeeda Warsi, the first Muslim woman to sit at Cabinet, has not been given a defined policy area.</p>
<p>Theresa May, the most senior female figure in the Conservative Party and the new Home Secretary, will also serve as minister for equalities.</p>
<p>Her appointment was questioned by some gay rights activists. Although praised as a Conservative modernizer, May voted against equalizing the age of sexual consent for gays and heterosexuals in 1998, and in 2002 she voted against letting gay couples adopt children. May did, however, vote in favor of civil partnerships.</p>
<p>Analysts say Cameron&rsquo;s efforts to increase diversity in the party&rsquo;s upper ranks by recruiting women candidates  &mdash;  mockingly dubbed &#8220;Cameron&rsquo;s cuties&#8221; by the press  &mdash;  didn&rsquo;t work because the new recruits don&rsquo;t yet have enough experience.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not a hard riddle for me to solve:  Most UK minorities vote Labour, most elected minorities are in the Labour Party.  The Tories are almost entirely white, better educated than normal, and somewhat conservative, and the Liberal Democrats are full of doctrinaire white liberals who pride themselves on education.  So a coalition administration of Tory+LD would have an almost all white cabinet that matriculated through Britain&rsquo;s most famous schools.</p>

		<p>Most advocates for the liberal brand of diversity argue for more non-whites in governmental positions of power, under the assertion that the administration must &#8220;reflect / represent the country&#8221;. My answer to that is that the non-whites in the U.K. do NOT reflect or represent the country they occupy. In order to assess the history and genuineness of the country and to live and experience in a respectably British environment, now one will face the rigid and formidable bulwark of modern-day multiculturalism that appears to be the same everywhere across the world: violent, depraved, consumerist, and complacent. But hey, we get great&hellip;er, exotic new restaurants with exciting cuisines so it&rsquo;s all worth it  &mdash;  the sacrifices our grandparents made, pride in country, our rights, our dignity, and our self-respect are all worthless and should NEVER have precedence over things like white guilt, hatred of ancestors, affirmative action, and punishment for wearing shirts with the country&rsquo;s flag on them.</p>
<p>What a terrifyingly bizarre world we live in.</p>

<p>Not that it matters anyway. The &#8220;white&#8221; men in the new government will probably be overwhelmingly in favor of minorities, anyway.</p>

		<p>Question Diversity - exactly.</p>
<p>The Conservatives did in fact try to force a black candidate on to the people of Chippenham - a normally Conservative, rural town in the South West. However, people in the South West are a stubborn lot and the Conservatives were voted out.</p>
<p>The black candidate is a London based ex-BBC buffoon who sells sausages as &#8220;The Black Farmer&#8221;. He recently changed his name from Wilfred Jones to Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones. Says it all.</p>

<p>I watched CSPAN simulcast of the BBC on election night.  The Tories actually ran two blacks up the flagpole in two different district, and both lost.  Which made me happy.</p>
<p>After Obama won, David Cameron told the British media that he was going to lead the way to find &#8220;our Obama.&#8221;  Maybe he found two Obamas, but the little hitch in his plans is that neither Obama won.</p>

<p>Once the demographics of mass legal and illegal immigration into the West works its will, the troubling problem of too many whites will be magically resolved. (Positive side: no need for uncomfortable cattle cars.)<br/>

		<p>They consider Theresa May the most conservative woman, and she is for civil unions, say what? Matters not the skin color of the members they are obviously all red on the inside. A prudent government would appoint the most qualified persons not the most colorful. Though I fail to see why we seem so concerned with the mother country, when our own is in such total shambles, and King Hussein is appointing his clones to every position imaginable. Plus attempting to pluralize the supremes with supposedly lesbian judges, influenced by his domineering diseased, fellow travler, and critical thinker mother. The last of which perhaps the only bench on which she ever sat was a park bench trying to feed the pidgeons.</p>

<p><br/>
Might I remind this &#8220;lawmaker&#8221; (terrifying thought!) that if &#8220;male and pale&#8221; is making up the government it&rsquo;s because the UK is (for the time being) still a democracy and &#8220;male and pale&#8221; was <i>what voters voted for</i>. The only way to get more non-male and/or non-pale persons into the government is to subvert the electoral process, ignore the will of the voters, and just APPOINT unelected minorities into elected positions. </p>
<p>Is THAT what you&rsquo;re proposing, Ms. Featherbrain? Doing away with British democracy and the parliamentary system in favor of government by PC bean-counting that installs a certain number of women and minorities without consulting the public? Because that certainly SOUNDS like what you&rsquo;re proposing. <br/>

		<p>I hear there&rsquo;s a lack of diversity in the Governments in China, Japan, Vietnam, and both Koreas too.  There aren&rsquo;t too many non-Asians in those Governments or in those countries for that matter.  </p>
<p>Apparently having a country or a Government that is entirely Asian or entirely Black is fantastic, but having a country or a Government that is entirely European is inherently evil.</p>
<p>White countries and only White countries MUST be diverse.  More racial equality.</p>

<p>America wasn&rsquo;t &#8220;founded on the principles of diversity either&#8221;.</p>
<p>Until the &#8220;Hero of Chappaquidick&rsquo;s&#8221; 1965 immigration and nationality act, the U.S.A. was almost entirely of white European stock (and better for it in the opinion of many).</p>
