<h1>Immigration Bill Would Bring Arizona-Style Law to Pa.</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeff Frantz, Daily Record, May 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A state representative proposed legislation Tuesday  &mdash;  backed by several local lawmakers  &mdash;  that was inspired by a controversial law passed last week in Arizona to combat illegal immigration.</p>
<p>If passed, the bill by Rep. Daryl Metcalfe, R-Butler, would charge local law enforcement with checking immigration status, investigating businesses suspected of knowingly employing illegal immigrants and requiring businesses to verify a potential employee&rsquo;s legal status.</p>
<p>The proposal came a day after state Sen. Daylin Leach, D-Montgomery, introduced a bill in direct opposition to Arizona&rsquo;s law.</p>
<p>Rep. Scott Perry, R-Carroll Township, supports Metcalfe&rsquo;s effort and said he will likely join as bill co-sponsor.</p>
<p>The federal government has failed to enforce the nation&rsquo;s immigration laws, Perry said, which is now forcing states to act because illegal immigration fosters crime, lowers wages and puts an added burden on taxpayers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>José Colon, president of the board for the Centro Hispano José Hernández, said much of York&rsquo;s Hispanic community agrees too many illegal immigrants abuse the system. He said he supports people stopped for violating the law having to prove who they are, saying it only makes sense in an age of terror.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Colon was also bothered by the rhetoric Metcalfe used introducing his proposal, when he spoke of murders and rapists. The vast majority of people here illegally came to work, Colon said, and it makes it harder to have the serious, necessary discussion of the issue with such inflamed rhetoric. And, he added, such talk could create friction between the Hispanic community and others.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>About the bill</b></p>
<p>If passed, House Bill 2479, would:</p>
<p># Require an employer to verify a prospective employee&rsquo;s immigration status. Lying about immigration status would be a second-degree misdemeanor.</p>
<p># Require a law enforcement officer to verify a person&rsquo;s immigration status if the officer reasonably suspects that a person legally stopped, detained or arrested is in the country illegally. An officer could not inquire about people&rsquo;s immigration status if they were not first stopped for another offense.</p>
<p># Require county district attorneys to investigate companies suspected of employing illegal immigrants. Companies caught knowingly doing so could lose access to state grants and their licenses to operate.</p>
<p># Create a third-degree felony for intentionally smuggling illegal aliens into Pennsylvania. Police would be able to impound smugglers&rsquo; vehicles.</p>

		<p>Pennsylvania is just one of many states that are coming up seriously short on funds to meet its budget requirements.</p>
<p>Again as in most states, much hand wringing is going on, because they don&rsquo;t want to be in a position where too many cuts are going to have to be made.</p>
<p>More traffic citations are being written.  Fees for various licenses, etc., are being increased.  But all of it together won&rsquo;t be enough.  The revenue still keeps falling, and the budget shortfall is on course to be drastically worse next year. </p>
<p>It has many politicians near hysteria and they&rsquo;ve even taken to threatening people who they believe owe taxes.  Here&rsquo;s a short video they have out:</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re calling it the, &#8220;We know who you are video.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Maryland is following suit and we will be introducing the new law May 21. The State Delegate sponsoring this is Pat McDonough.<br>
You can listen to Pat on WCBM 680 AM on May 8th from 8pm to 10 pm.<br>
His website is www.patmcdonough.org. Intelligent, civil, courteous supporters are most welcome. </p>

		<p>As a resident of the Philadelphia area, I can&rsquo;t say that crime by Hispanics, legal or illegal, seems to be an inordinate problem, at least when compared with black criminality.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, illegal immigration, if not controlled immediately and forcefully, will be the end of the uniquely American culture, and eventually, the American nation.</p>

<p>Of course, Pennsylvania knows who you are, except if you get in a car wreck.  On the Drudge Report two days ago, on separate sides of the page, there was that story about the pretend big brother tax agency, and on the other side was a story that the State Police in PA misidentified a fatal victim of a car wreck, and misidentified him as a young man from Long Island.  I&rsquo;m surprised Drudge didn&rsquo;t pick up on that and group those two stories together.</p>

		<p>Here you have a classic example of a liberal dominated state adopting the same tactics as arizona&hellip;.out of self defense.</p>
<p>They know where arizona&rsquo;s mexican drug dealing population will goto soon, unless they act.</p>
<p>In short order, only a handful of states in the US will be forced to carry the burden of all the mexicans in the US&hellip;..a short time later, those holdouts will collapse.</p>

		<p>Excellent!  Congratulations to those states that are following Arizona&rsquo;s lead.</p>
<p>But, on the other hand, doesn&rsquo;t this say something shameful about our useless, worthless federal government, that the states should have undertake to do what really ought to be Washington&rsquo;s job?</p>

		<p>I think it is good that Pennsylvania is addressing their illegal immigrant problem before it reaches a critical point like in the Southwestern states. It is better to deal with the problem now and provide the tools to law enforcement before the problem grows out of hand in the Keystone state. It is out of control here in California, Illegals cost the taxpayer 10 billion dollars a year in welfare, schools, and healthcare. And John, to give you an idea of illegal immigrant criminality. Illegal immigrants make up 1/3 of the Federal Prison population, that is a lot of money. And the damage they cause to communities they live in from their crime cannot be quantified in dollars and cents. </p>

		<p>I hope every state in the Union will follow suit until they have nowhere else to run except back across the border where their home countries will finally have to do the job of taking care of their own citizens and not tying to dump them on us. If Washington thinks we need foreign workers, why not give these jobs to the new citizens they bring in by the thosands each month? We have people here for guest-worker programs, refugees from political and religous intolerance, new LEGAL citizens and any number of people who needs jobs as well as millions of unemployed Americans. Can they tell us why we need to open our borders to the illegal alien terrorists who continue to pour across? We all know their motives are much deeper than jobs, don&rsquo;t we?</p>
