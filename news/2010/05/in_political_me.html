			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Krissah Thompson, Washington Post, May 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Truth is, there is very little agreement about the meaning of the &#8220;race card&#8221;  &mdash;  a phrase that once described an attempt to unnecessarily insert the issue of race into a debate and that now sometimes seems to describe a whole lot more.</p>
<p>One group that finds itself engaged in the back-and-forth attacks is the &#8220;tea party&#8221; movement. Democrats level charges of racism against the movement; tea party supporters, in turn, accuse Democrats of playing the race card.</p>
<p>A new Washington Post/ABC News Poll illuminates some of the differences in world view that underlie those charges.</p>
<p>Tea party supporters are less apt to see racism as a problem today, with 43 percent saying it&rsquo;s only a small problem or not one at all, more than double the percentage among all others (18 percent) and more than three times the level among opponents of the movement (12 percent).</p>
<p>According to the poll, some 61 percent of tea party opponents say racism has a lot to do with the movement; that&rsquo;s a view held by just 7 percent of tea party supporters. In fact, for supporters, racial bias is the least frequently cited cause, with economic anxiety and a general distrust of government the most often mentioned.</p>
<p>For opponents, who are largely Democratic and a more diverse group, tops on the list of perceived motivations is opposition to the policy positions of Obama and the Democrats, followed by racial bias. {snip}</p>
<p>Republican strategist, pollster and tea party supporter Leslie Sanchez said labeling an entire group, such as the tea party, as racist is &#8220;extreme.&#8221; Racial prejudice against Obama &#8220;isn&rsquo;t the genesis of this movement and to label it as that based on a few fringe elements is a false argument,&#8221; she said. That, Sanchez said, is playing the race card.</p>
<p>Democratic pollster and strategist Cornell Belcher said racial prejudice persists but has lessened in terms of its effect on minority candidates. Still, he said, talking about race without being accused of playing the race card is difficult.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Democratic pollster and strategist Cornell Belcher said racial prejudice persists but has lessened in terms of its effect on minority candidates. Still, he said, talking about race without being accused of playing the race card is difficult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How laughable, Comrade Belcher doth protest too much, methinks?</p>
<p>In fact, the whole worthless and wretched bunch of these politicos, on either side,  does so in my book!</p>
<p>It has ceased to be a question of &ldquo;the race card&rdquo; or other false accusations of &ldquo;racism,&rdquo; these days. It has become more of what might be called, the race conundrum. The state religion holds that &ldquo;race should not matter&rdquo; or &ldquo;diversity is our strength,&rdquo; and any objections to this or counterarguments, are subjected to &ldquo;shut up&rdquo; platitudes, in one form or another. The accusations and recriminations seem irrational to outright bizarre, simply because they obstinately defy reality and fecklessly defend a fantasy. </p>
<p>In other words, the dogs are all chasing their own tails and wondering why the things keep wagging them, in the end.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>I am just waiting for someone to call the bluff, and come out and say:  &#8220;There is no Race Card, and &#8216;Racist&rsquo; means absolutely nothing in politics.&#8221;  This is inevitable.  </p>

		<p>I had to check twice to make sure this was an article in The Washington Post and not the odious Diversity, Inc.</p>
<p>But then what&rsquo;s the difference between the two publications? </p>
<p>Of course, the washington post uses the Tea Party to make its point, not LaRaza or NAACP: </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;According to the poll, some 61 percent of tea party opponents say racism has a lot to do with the movement&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This is one more example of the media&rsquo;s War on Whites; an open, ongoing, relentless attack on Whites attempting to organize and advocate for themselves, which the hostile media, government and academia will not allow.</p>
<p>Therefore, the media demonize the Tea Party, accuse it of &#8216;racism&rsquo; and call it a &#8216;racist organization.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The hyper-hypocritical media would NEVER ask Whites if they thought racism had anything to do with LaRaza.</p>

		<p>The cultural left, led by limo liberals, sees everything in terms of race.  Although most of them are white, they somehow pose every issue in terms of whites vs. non-whites, with the latter always being right.  These libs, who purport to be for the common man, are actually concerned only with minority and gay rights and the destruction of religion.</p>

		<p>The Tea Party people are accused of being racists primarily because most of the members are white. Does that mean that ACORN people are racist because most of the members are black, and constantly accuse anyone that does not agree with their actions of being racists? The Tea Party members are proven to be better educated than the general population, yet the media characterize them as stupid. The Tea Party people are angry about the government spending spinning out of control, and it is proven that the members are more affluent than the general population. They should be concerned, it&rsquo;s mostly their money. 50% of the population pays no federal taxes. The 50% that pay nothing get a larger share of the government spending than the 50% that pay taxes. I think that&rsquo;s unfair, but the people that don&rsquo;t pay anything call it &#8220;progressive&#8221;. I am a white man. I have an above average intelligence ( IQ 138, recently tested ) an above average income ( well over the average for my state of residence, and the nation ) and pay alot of federal, state, and local taxes. I get no welfare, food stamps, have no kids in Head Start, I don&rsquo;t get a tax refund ( again this year after thousands in deductions ( I had to send in more by April 15 ) or any other goverment handouts. I don&rsquo;t consider myself a racist, I&rsquo;m a REALIST.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Race Card&#8221; is fired by all sides? </p>
<p>An absurd exaggeration. Conservatives rarely get to use the race card. Liberals do it all the time. In fact it seems that is all they ever do.</p>
