<h1><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/science/biology_evolution/article7120735.ece">Six Months Old and He Can Tell Good From Evil</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Maurice Chittenden, Times of London, May 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mothers and fathers might think they have few higher duties than teaching a sense of right and wrong to their children. But research suggests that their offspring may already be a step ahead of them.</p>
<p>Scientists have discovered that babies can start to make moral judgments by the age of six months and may be born with the ability to tell good from bad hard-wired into their brains.</p>
<p>Infants can even act as judge and jury in the nursery. Researchers who asked one-year-old babies to take away treats from a &#8220;naughty&#8221; puppet found they were sometimes also leaning over and smacking the figure on the head.</p>
<p>The research is being pioneered by a team of psychologists at the infant cognition centre at Yale University in Connecticut. Their findings go against the received wisdom that humans begin life with a moral &#8220;blank slate&#8221; and are shaped by their parents and social environment.</p>
<p>In their research, the scientists used the ability to tell helpful from unhelpful behaviour as an indication of moral judgment. In one experiment, they tested infants less than a year old playing with cuddly animals and puppets. Babies are unable to press buttons or pull levers to show their preferences so the scientists measured the amount of time a child was gazing at one object. Typically they stare longer at things that please them.</p>
<p>In one test, groups of babies aged between six months and a year watched an animated film of simple geometric shapes. A red ball with eyes tries to climb a hill. At different times, a yellow square gets behind it to help push it up the hill and a green triangle forces it back down again.</p>
<p>The babies watched it between six and 14 times, depending on their powers of concentration. They were then asked to &#8220;choose&#8221; between the &#8220;good guy&#8221; square, and the &#8220;bad guy&#8221; triangle. In 80% of cases the infants chose the helpful character against the unhelpful one.</p>
<p>In a second study, a toy dog tries to open a box. One teddy bear helps him but another sits on it to stop him getting inside. After watching it at least six times, the babies were asked to choose which bear they liked. Most opted for the friendly bear.</p>
<p>Paul Bloom, professor of psychology who heads the study team, said the research flew in the face of psychologists such as Sigmund Freud who believed humans began life as &#8220;amoral animals&#8221; and William James who described a baby&rsquo;s mental life as &#8220;one great, blooming, buzzing confusion&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a growing body of scientific evidence that supports the idea that perhaps some sense of good and evil is bred in the bone,&#8221; Bloom said.</p>
<p>To establish whether babies were really responding to niceness and naughtiness the scientists devised another test in which a toy cat plays with a ball while a cuddly rabbit puppet stands on either side. When the cat loses the ball, the rabbit on the right side returns it to him but if the ball rolls the other way the rabbit on the left side picks it up and runs away with it. This time, one-year-old babies were asked to take a treat away from one puppet. Most took it from the pile of the naughty rabbit, who also ended up with a smack on the head for his bad behaviour.</p>
<p>Kiley Hamlin, author of the team&rsquo;s Infant Morality report, said: &#8220;We spend a lot of time worrying about teaching the difference between good guys and bad guys in the world but this might be something that infants come to the world with.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, Nadja Reissland, a behavioural psychologist at Durham University, cautioned that adult assumptions may have coloured how a child&rsquo;s actions were interpreted by the researchers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything hinges on who decides what is moral,&#8221; said Reissland. &#8220;By saying pushing the ball up the hill is helpful, the researchers are making a moral judgment. The babies might just prefer to see things go up rather than down.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the other test, perhaps the bear closes the box to prevent the dog from getting in there because there is something dangerous inside. It is like a mother keeping children out of an area where there is something harmful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reissland added that children started being socialised into knowing good from bad as soon as they were born.</p>
<p>Peter Willatts, a senior lecturer in psychology at Dundee University, said: &#8220;You cannot get inside the mind of the baby. You cannot ask them. You have to go on what most attracts their attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;We now know that in the first six months babies learn things much quicker than we thought possible. What they are born with and what they learn is difficult to divide.&#8221;<br>

		<p>This research seems like absolute nonsense. I simply do not believe that a six month old baby would understand what pushing a load up a hill would entail, nor what impeding a person doing this would mean. Babies do not even begin to understand that objects are permenant and do not disappear when you cannot see them until they are about 9 months old, yet I&rsquo;m supposed to believe they can empathise with someone moving a load?!!!</p>

		<p>Knew it!  My Racist White Baby is really a perfect judge of Right and Wrong. I am cultivating her instincts.  Whenever she stares at the blacks (I&rsquo;ve quit saying &#8220;black people&#8221;), I stare at them too, and make faces of disgust and fear.  She probably doesn&rsquo;t needs such overt lessons, but the forces of Diversity Privilege are so arrayed against her for the rest of her life that I don&rsquo;t think these things can be overdone.</p>
<p>As Newsweek magazine said, my baby is a racist.  I&rsquo;m doing my part to make sure she&rsquo;s always a racist and never a non racist.</p>
<p>I want White Grandchildren, because our family is a Whites Only family!</p>

		<p>See especially the works of William McDougall as a precursor<br>
of sociobiology and a prescient insight into the errors of<br>
Blank Slate behaviorism.  News items like this are more a rediscovery of &#8220;banned&#8221;  scholarship than any scientific breakthrough.       </p>

		<p>In truth the enlightened educators don&rsquo;t believe in the blank slate ideology. In every way they show they believe people of color Are born a blank slate, noble and vibrant creatures with a special connection to the earth and moral judgment, it is only whites deemed born in original sin, all guilty until they prove their good works, which is mostly done by condemning the morality of other whites. </p>

Why shouldn&rsquo;t morality be a human instinct?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all experienced &#8216;bad seeds&rsquo; on our lives (and recognized them as such) from when we were children to being adults. Even as children, we knew which kids were good or bad. I have no doubt some of it is learned but I also have no doubt that some of it is instinctual.</p>
<p>Morality, empathy, compassion make us human. Our problem is that there are those who have turned our strengths into our weaknesses.</p>

		<p>This Nature vs Nurture debate is sorely lacking.</p>
<p>It is like trying to understand a sphere, when only studying the principles of a circle. </p>
<p>This debate should be 3 dimensional, not a simplistic 2.<br>
The missing item of course is one&rsquo;s soul.</p>
<p>It should be Nature, Nurture and Soul (Karma, free will, whatever you want to call it)</p>
<p>Look at it that way and it all makes sense.</p>
<p>You can have someone with &#8216;perfect&rsquo; genetics, a great environment and they still turn out to be a bad apple. Why, their soul. What makes them, them, made them the bad apple.</p>
<p>And the vice versa is true as well, as well as every other combination.</p>
<p>Well, anyways, Nature vs Nurture irritates me. <br>

		<p>Nadja Reissland&rsquo;s argument is pretty hollow. I doubt the subjectivity of morality has anything to do with it, as the baby wouldn&rsquo;t think that far into it. They see two &#8216;people&rsquo; helping each other while another tries to stop them, the babies like the co-operative pair rather than the unhelpful one. Pretty simple.  </p>

		<p>McDougall was a little agnostic about an inherent &#8220;moral sense&#8221;.<br>
Overall, his appreciation of &#8220;hard wiring&#8221; in human nature <br>
was well ahead of the times and was a due caution toward gung-ho American behaviorism.  Later, the survival advantages<br>
of in-group selection for altruism and morality were understood<br>
more clearly. He sure grasped that humans had evolved by virtue<br>
of mechanisms serving a vital, if necessarily somewhat flexible,  &#8220;us/them&#8221; dichotomy.  </p>

		<p>My own impression is that the &#8220;moral sense&#8221; was a prescient<br>
topic of David Hartley and other philsophers and informed the <br>
work of Wordsworth, for example, as a poetic-philosophical notion of the unfolding of mental development within a Nature-embedded childhood    In THE YOUNG DELINQUENT,<br>
Sir Cyril Burt, had at least one lengthy footnote about &#8220;the moral sense&#8221;.  And in-group altruism and in-group morality are certainly basic to the cultures that have been evolutionary winners, as is the clear sense of &#8220;us/them&#8221;.       </p>
