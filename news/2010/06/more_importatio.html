<h1><a href="http://www.cis.org/edwards/importing-poverty">More Importation of Poverty</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James R. Edwards Jr., Center for Immigration Studies, May 31, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Robert Samuelson, in his weekly column in the Washington Post, highlights a key factor in why U.S. poverty rates seem not to improve. Jesus warned that the poor will always be there. But after concerted efforts and giant leaps over more than half a century, surely America is doing better than the statistics show.</p>
<p>Samuelson&rsquo;s column, titled &#8220;Why Obama&rsquo;s poverty rate measure misleads,&#8221; primarily addresses a questionable poverty calculation the administration has proposed. However, he cites &#8220;the apparent lack of progress&#8221; in reducing poverty as &#8220;misleading,&#8221; with one reason being that &#8220;it ignores immigration.&#8221; He writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;First, it ignores immigration, which has increased reported poverty. Many immigrants are poor and low-skilled. From 1989 to 2007, about three-quarters of the increase in the poverty population occurred among Hispanics  &mdash;  mostly immigrants, their children and grandchildren. The poverty rate for blacks fell during this period, though it was still much too high (24.5 percent in 2007). Poverty &#8220;experts&#8221; don&rsquo;t dwell on immigration, because it implies that more restrictive policies might reduce U.S. poverty.&#8221;</p>
<p>The United States had for most of our history a strong policy of rejecting immigrants unable or unwilling to be self-reliant. Those who gained admittance but later went on the public dole faced deportation. In other words, the storied &#8220;poor, huddled masses&#8221; and &#8220;wretched refuse&#8221; largely didn&rsquo;t get admitted into the United States, and those immigrants who did had to be self-sufficient. This common-sense, tough-love approach is known as &#8220;public charge doctrine.&#8221; But it became a victim of political correctness, judicial activism, and welfare statism.</p>
<p>The Clinton administration fought reforms that would have more fully restored public charge doctrine. In 1996, the GOP Congress would have required visa sponsors to earn at least 200 percent of the official poverty level. The status quo at the time was 100 percent of poverty income to be an immigrant sponsor  &mdash;  woefully inadequate. The Clintonites strong-armed lawmakers into accepting minimum sponsorship income of 125 percent of the federal poverty level.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today. The newly enacted health law makes those earning 133 percent of the federal poverty level eligible for the welfare program Medicaid. That means immigrant sponsors can be poor enough to be on Medicaid (and other welfare programs Samuelson names, including the Earned Income Tax Credit, which is an outright redistribution-of-wealth program), yet &#8220;wealthy&#8221; enough to sponsor others for visas.</p>
<p>There is something extremely wrong with this picture. It shows how the combination of chain migration, lax visa sponsorship and public charge laws, and a welfare state guarantee the continued importation of the world&rsquo;s poorest. This puts America on a permanent treadmill of importing poverty while decrying how our antipoverty efforts haven&rsquo;t raised the economic boats of the underclass.<br>

		<p>&#8220;The poor will always be with us&#8221;(J.C.). Especially if we continue to import them second only to oil.The proponents of the continued importation of poor, low intellegence masses do so simply because they themselves are comfortable with their considerable wealth,and having more cheap labor that they can profit from at the expense of those of average means. </p>

		<p>poverty can sometimes be alleviated or avoided by choosing to pursue education and a good moral compass&hellip;&hellip;..  it has to do with not stuffing yourself everyday with cokes and junkfood&hellip;&hellip;..   it has to do with being awake to what succeeds and what fails&hellip;&hellip;.that won&rsquo;t get rid of all poverty but it would cut a swath into it.  Why the US would import poor hispanics and africans is beyond me&hellip;&hellip;.  The ones who make those decisions are not among us that have to deal with the influx of loser societies.</p>

		<p>As far as I know, welfare, food stamps, etc. do not count as income in figuring who is or is not living in &#8220;poverty&#8221;, so our poverty statistics are very much inflated.</p>
<p>As noted by a columnist, probably Thomas Sowell, we seem to be the only country where the &#8220;poor&#8221; have automobiles, color TV sets with cable TV service, cell phones, microwave ovens, etc., etc., etc.</p>
<p>It is strange how we are told that we need to import poor, uneducated workers, i.e. import poverty as the article says, to continue to be a rich nation. It is only in the short-term that it makes any sense at all: cheap votes and cheap labor, with all the social costs picked up not by the businesses who hire them, but the productive, intelligent people. Even then it doesn&rsquo;t make much sense, as cheap laborers displace taxpaying citizens, and those citizens then work for less or go on the dole, plus all the added crime and deterioration of once decent neighborhoods.</p>
<p>But in the long run, it is even worse. We are selling our birthright for a mess of pottage.</p>

		<p>The seditionists import poverty stricken non-whites, who are the dregs of the societies from which they fled, then complain of non-white gaps in wealth and intelligence, making whites out as the evildoers.</p>
<p>The longer this country lasts the worse it gets.  It has now developed into a full-fledged empire.</p>

		<p>Even if all people were interchangeable widgets with equal abilities and proclivities bringing uneducated people into a deindustrializing country is foolish.  I can bale all day but if I never fix the leak in the boat the boat will eventually sink.  We don&rsquo;t have a need for millions of manual laborers any more.  That is just economic fact!<br>

		<p>By importing Mexico&rsquo;s poverty, we help maintain a parasitic class of multi-millionaires and billionaires in that country. <br>
These derive much of their wealth from quasi-monopolies in vital services.</p>
<p>Professor George W. Grayson, senior associate, Center for Strategic and International Studies, elaborated on Lou Dobbs Tonight (May 3, 2007): </p>
<p>&#8220;Lou, Mexico&rsquo;s elites live like maharajas. But they spend extremely little on education and health care and transportation to upgrade the quality of their citizens. They pay about  &mdash;  as a percent of gross domestic product  &mdash;  the same percentage that Haiti pays, 10.4 percent. So as a result, even though it&rsquo;s an immensely wealthy country  &mdash;  gold, silver, beaches, oil &hellip; they prefer to neglect their problems at home, turn a blind eye to them, and let U.S. taxpayers pick up the tab.&#8221;* </p>
<p>The U.S., you see, is the maharajas&rsquo; safety value. </p>
<p>The richest of the Mexican parasites is Carlos Slim, who is also the richest man in the world. See:</p>

		<p>What a joke!  Sponsor an immigrant??? They do NOT! I worked where we had to deal with this stuff and all one has to do is show they do not have enough money to support these &#8220;relatives&#8221; they brought over, after the fact!  Then BINGO!  The taxpayers are holding the bag. No problemo.  </p>

<p>Fritz, I&rsquo;m in my sixties so I&rsquo;m going back some years, but I seem to recall that it was the sponsor would be responsible for the person he was sponsoring. This was in the days before the welfare state, so basically the sponsor would have to house, feed, clothe, etc., the person he was sponsoring until that person got on his feet. I believe the sponsor committed to a period of 5 years. If the person he was sponsoring turned out to be a deadbeat I guess the sponsor just quit supporting him and he went back to the old country.   <br>

		<p>It is only in the short-term that it makes any sense at all: cheap votes and cheap labor</p>
<p><br>
Even that is a lie.  I would challenge people to come up with a single legitimate instance where some company is getting rich off of &#8220;cheap labor&#8221;.</p>
<p>The people who run these companies are communists, who infiltrated companies (they never build) in order to steal their wealth and then destroy what they provide for the United States.</p>
<p>Making money (for the company) is the last thing from their minds.  These companies are NOT profitable.  Just ask their shareholders who have lost the majority of their investment money over the last several years.</p>
<p>My point is, these people do not stiff the American worker with mexicans willing to do the same jobs for slave wages and then collect the difference as profits.  Instead, they infiltrate a company.  Over many years, replacing the high ups with communists (card carrying communists&hellip;.members of specific communist organizations).  They steal the companies wealth.  Then, they do everything they can to destroy that company&rsquo;s ability to provide good paying jobs for white people.  That&rsquo;s usually the end stage, right before the company is about to be forced out of business.  Often, by that point, it&rsquo;s not lining anyone&rsquo;s pockets anymore.</p>
<p>Greed is not the motivator behind importing mestizos.  Destroying the country is.  It&rsquo;s not about money.</p>

		<p>We are importing poverty and making more poverty for those that not even immigrants. </p>
<p>The immigrant and especially the illegal alien drive down the wage scale for the immigrant, the illegal AND FOR THE LEGAL TOO. Native born as well, skilled and unskilled. </p>
<p>In my profession, it used to be a minimum of a two year degree just to get started and that without any experience. </p>
<p>The American employer across the board now is so enthralled with what they teach in the MBA schools about the &#8220;interchangeable employee&#8221; or whatever they call it that NOW a degree and experience means much less. Who needs degree and experience when the belief that with a little bit of luck, Jose can follow a written work instruction if he is even at best slightly marginal in the language and has the gumption to try!! So the wage scale is depressed because the the glut of prospective employees is so large.</p>

		<p>All white-majority nations have awakened to the welfare/crime threat of third-world immigrants.  They&rsquo;re just beginning to toughen up by restrictions and deportations, and, presumably, this trend will continue.  <br>
I have a liberal family member who continues to insist that these interlopers are needed to fill labor and tax gaps, even though it must be overly obvious to anyone that people on welfare, often dealing dope, do not do this!  </p>

<p>    I&rsquo;m not sure that there was much of a public dole until the Roosevelt Administration. Before the New Deal, most charity was provided by private agencies or religious groups. The late Chicago Economist Milton Friedman said that no welfare state could long survive open borders. We appear to be reaching that point today.</p>

		<p>Pardon my immature sense of humor but I&rsquo;m reminded of the very first(?) &#8216;Futurama&rsquo; episode where not having a job was the only death penalty offense.</p>
<p>That said, the reality is that, as the world shifts more and more towards globalism, to raise up everyone to a common &#8216;median&rsquo; standard while maintaining a system of distributionist/centrist economics (add more production/delivery steps so that every rich person can profit from owning the stocks on the companies involved, screw thermodynamics which says that costs as a label value for energy will skyrocket&hellip;) will require the death of our extant middle class.</p>
<p>Why?  Because a typical white family has 1-2 60,000 or higher earners and invests in a few luxury goods and a house.  Which they then spend 20+ years paying off as a single debt ceiling on credit that they rarely use except for essentials like braces for Cindy and a trip to the ER for Junior&rsquo;s broken arm.</p>
<p>Whereas, a Mexican family (and yes, I lived next door to one so I know whereof I speak) may have 8-10 people living in the same single family house.  All of them work at 10,000 dollar a year jobs.  And the very fact that, while aggregately they can afford the &#8216;middle class lifestyle&rsquo;, individually, they are junk-consumerists living on sub poverty level incomes, ensures that they spend 90% of their money on rapid turnover items like food, and low material value consumeables&hellip;</p>
<p>All of which can be sourced cheap from nearly anywhere.</p>
<p>Those are the kinds of people China was born to make throwaway commercial goods for.  High rate.  Low quality.  Maximum profit by volume.  And so the rich make room at the top for themselves to make more wealth, by sharing it out, overseas.  And never mind the rest of us.</p>
<p>As they open a flood tap of immigration which essentially &#8216;resets&rsquo; the -definition- of middle income groups, like hot booting a computer into safe mode after a BSOD.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think that this is casual.  Don&rsquo;t think that this is about cheap nannies and gardners and the construction industry.  Don&rsquo;t think that it is about having an exotic restaurant 10 minutes away from your gated community.  Not for the wealthy.  When &#8216;everyone knows&rsquo;, throughout the middle class, that something has failed the sanity check, you can bet your standard of living that a rich person thought of it first and decided, cold bloodedly, deliberately, that it was better us than him.</p>
<p>What is ironic about all this is that, for all their nominal &#8216;stand on your own, secure your own future&rsquo; self image; whites have a tradition of group conformism to a standard of mediation and change that essentially says that if we don&rsquo;t pull together, nobody rocks the boat by oaring alone.</p>
<p>And while such is nominally a good idea, if one particular social class element is simply resolved to -do nothing- until it is too late (IMO, we&rsquo;re already there) then _nothing will happen at all_.</p>
<p>Because we will not break ranks with our poisonous corrupt, rich, leadership.</p>
<p>To call a Constitutional Convention and demand change in the form and format of new governance.  Indeed, with the number of &#8216;hidden&rsquo; EOs and NVLs going through White House and the Congress, I&rsquo;m not entirely sure we -can-, legally, call for such a change without being deemed seditionists or, dare I say it, terrorists.</p>
<p>And that too is about enforcing intimidation until &#8216;change&rsquo; is a fait d&rsquo;accompli condition of fact.</p>
<p>The time for the tea party was about mid 1996.  Now, the revolution is upon us and it is being won by the simple fact that we are inspired to do nothing while hoping for acknowledgment of the obvious from above.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to help someone who cannot help themselves  &mdash;  and even then, that is what charities are for, it is not the government&rsquo;s job to hand out money.  It&rsquo;s quite another to mooch.</p>

		<p>Importing endless streams of third world, unskilled or low skilled, non-whites and then getting these folks signed up for social entitlements and letting them ride on the backs of tax paying, mostly white middle class Americans - is a key component of the 50 plus year program of genocide of European people.  </p>
<p>Let me explain why.   Whites, by an large, are very disciplined when it comes to having children - and tend to restrict the size of their families, in order to not put too great of a strain on their family income or preferred lifestyle.  They procreate responsibility, in other words.   Non-whites, particularly Blacks and Mestizos - do not seem to share these concerns, and reproduce at financially irresponsible levels, and commonly have far more kids than they can afford on the income of someone who&rsquo;s low skilled, poorly educated, or outright lazy.  So, along comes a liberal do-gooder who&rsquo;s usually a self-hating white, but often can also be a resentful member of various powerful ethnic groups who carry a grudge against the White race - and they create these high tax situations that steal money from white middle class taxpayers and then use that money to fund social entitlement programs that benefit these fast-breeding minorities, at the white tax payer&rsquo;s expense.</p>
<p>White families react to this by restricting the number of kids that they have, and in many cases, they decide to have none at all.   Presto!  White birth rate declines, White genocide promoters applaud, and the nation of our 100 percent White Founding Fathers sides farther and farther into the third world.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m of the same vintage, and that&rsquo;s exactly as I remember it too. You&rsquo;re correct.  We DID have welfare then, but it was not so all-encompassing, and they were not entitled to get it. They needed a financially sound sponsor, and they were the sponsor&rsquo;s burden.  I knew at that time a Mexican friend who had come here under such a sponsorship.  But he was a rarity (hard to imagine now!) and there was no such thing as mass migration  (before about 1965-1970;  the 70&rsquo;s were when it became noticeable).</p>

 - Sardonicus</p>
<p><br>
There was always the County  Poorhouse. It was considered a great disgrace   &mdash;   the very last resort, short of suicide. </p>
<p>I know this, because my grandfather&rsquo;s father, a coalminer, an elderly man then in his 60s, went blind (and probably had other health problems) leaving him unable to work or support his family. He was sent to the poorhouse. That was 1888. Going to the poorhouse, back then,  was considered a disgrace, a humiliation to the entire family. Something unmentionable. His wife and children received no support;  and my grandfather, at the age of 8, and his brother,  had to go to work in the mines to support their mother and sister. There had been several other children: one a pale blonde little sister who died of sunstroke while gathering huckleberries on the mountain, another of snakebite, and several others who were all wiped out within several days or weeks by an epidemic of cholera or dyphtheria  [there was no free medical help for the poor], leaving my grandfather and his brother as survivors.  Such was life in the 1880s.</p>

		<p>Making money (for the company) is the last thing from their minds. These companies are NOT profitable. Just ask their shareholders who have lost the majority of their investment money over the last several years.</p>
<p>My point is, these people do not stiff the American worker with mexicans willing to do the same jobs for slave wages and then collect the difference as profits. I</p>
<p>Greed is not the motivator behind importing mestizos. Destroying the country is. It&rsquo;s not about money.    &mdash;  -  #11, Anon.</p>

<p>No.  You are over-simplifying the matter, and you are wrong.  It is about BOTH. </p>
<p>Such companies don&rsquo;t make money?  They go broke?  Oh really?  Don&rsquo;t be disingenuous!</p>
<p>I refer you to the  recent case of  the Rubashkin kosher meatpacking plant raid in Postville, Iowa.  It was  [quote]  &#8220;the largest single raid on  a workplace in U.S. history until that date, and resulted in nearly 400 arrests for the use of stolen social security numbers, and similar offenses.&#8221;   [Wikipedia]   There were 389 arrests, &#8220;including  290 Guatemalans, 93 Mexicans; plus 4 Ukranians and 2 Israelis&#8221;.</p>
<p>Do you really think these operators were not making money?<br>

		<p>Speaking of entitlements..<br>
Remember the movie &#8220;Cinderella Liberty&#8221;? Marsha Mason was on Aid to dependent children or some such and the case worker made a home visit to scour her apartment for any signs of an able bodied man living there who should be supporting her and the child.<br>

<p>They sure were making money  &mdash;  from the meth they were making at an &#8216;in-house&rsquo; lab and a weapons market operating right on the premises!</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Federal authorities charged that a methamphetamine laboratory was operating at the nation&rsquo;s largest kosher slaughterhouse and that employees carried weapons to work&hellip;.Among the allegations in an affidavit released by ICE was that some AgriProcessors workers bought and sold weapons at work.</p>
