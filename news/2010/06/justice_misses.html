			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Lillis, The Hill, June 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The long-running saga  &mdash;  which dates to 2003, when Congress passed a law requiring new rules  &mdash;  has angered some lawmakers and prisoner-rights advocates, who contend that each day the guidelines are delayed, preventable assaults are taking place.</p>
<p>&#8220;The longer you delay, the more people will be raped in prison,&#8221; Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.) said Tuesday in a telephone interview. &#8220;It&rsquo;s unconscionable that [DoJ] officials are blocking it now.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Holder [Attorney General Eric Holder] defended the agency Tuesday in a letter to Wolf and Rep. Robert &#8220;Bobby&#8221; Scott (D-Va.), another strong supporter of the new guidelines, saying DoJ is moving as quickly as it can.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is essential,&#8221; Holder wrote, &#8220;that the department take the time necessary to craft regulations that will endure.&#8221;</p>
<p>At issue is a seven-year-old law requiring the DoJ to forge new rules designed to prevent assaults in correctional facilities, including juvenile detention centers.</p>
<p>Signed into law by President George W. Bush, the legislation created a commission that spent more than four years studying prison assaults before issuing its recommendations last June. Among the proposed standards, commissioners suggested that prisons take further steps to isolate vulnerable inmates from more violent offenders and separate genders during inspections and searches.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although the law required DoJ to finalize the standards by Wednesday, the process has been delayed indefinitely while the agency has sought additional public comment and cost estimates.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One stipulation of the law is that the reforms must not &#8220;impose substantial additional costs&#8221; on prisons. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Prison officials claim that it will be too expensive to implement [the standards]  &mdash;  too expensive to prevent staff from raping detainees,&#8221; Lovisa Stannow, executive director of Justice Detention International, a prisoner-rights group, wrote in the Huffington Post earlier this year.</p>
<p>Stannow argues that the cost analyses being considered ignore the cost benefits that would result if the prison rapes were reduced. Medical costs could be cut, she says, as well as the legal expenses resulting from prisoner lawsuits.</p>
<p>&#8220;These factors are not included in the Department of Justice cost study,&#8221; Stannow wrote, &#8220;but Attorney General Holder must take them into account.&#8221;</p>
<p>A series of recent studies adds legitimacy to the advocates&rsquo; concerns. The DoJ, estimates that more than 60,000 prisoners suffer sexual assaults at the hands of guards or other prisoners each year. Another study, released in January, found that 12 percent of juveniles in detention facilities are assaulted.</p>

		<p>Aside from all the obvious reasons, they really ought to be moving more quickly on this issue:  I think this issue is a sitting duck for the Federal judiciary, and the Constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.  Based on the almost certainty that someone sent to state prison will be raped, I can imagine that the Courts will set standards on who can get sent to prison and for what crimes.</p>
<p>On top of that, state budgets are getting tighter and tighter, and they simply won&rsquo;t be able to afford to imprison the number of people they do today.</p>

		<p>The majority of prison rapes are inter-racial and cross-generational.  The simple solution is to segregate prisoners by not only sex, but by race, ethnicity, religion, age and sexual orientation.  Why spend millions of dollars and many years researching something obvious?  You don&rsquo;t even need new prisons.  Large population states can assign individual prisons by race and age, just as they do by sex.  Smaller states, or smaller population groups such as seniors and Jews, can be segregated by prison wing or cell block.  Is this so difficult?  And quite frankly I would place cameras in showers to avoid rape there.  You lose your freedom in prison and most of your privacy so what would be the big deal?  I&rsquo;d rather be watched showering than raped.</p>
<p>In a civilized society imprisonment is punishment by loss of freedoms and rights, not torture by fellow inmates.  Why is the right to associate with differing races such an inalienable right?  Prisoners have a right to be treated humanely, nothing more, and that includes privacy in the shower.</p>
<p>What a foolish and demented society we have become.</p>

		<p>There is no excuse for a rape happening in a jail. The jailers can stop any rape if they really want to. In San Francisco,a young white dummy guy was raped by a black predatory thug. He was there because he had 11 ounces of weed on him.The rapist, (black) got a lengthy prision sentence.  </p>

		<p> Here again let&rsquo;s use Occam&rsquo;s Razor to cut through all the code words and the tap-dancing around the real problem that this story contains: Most prison rapes feature blacks as the perpetrators, Whites as the victims. If prisons would strictly segregate prisoners by race   &mdash;   blacks over here, Whites over there, Hispanics somewhere else   &mdash;   the problem of prison rape would be reduced by a huge percentage.</p>
<p> But of course that won&rsquo;t happen, because that would require facing a very ugly fact of American life: That blacks, in prison and out, often use violence and physical intimidation on Whites, and others, to get their way. This isn&rsquo;t to suggest that Whites, or Hispanics, or Asians, or American Indians, NEVER do the same thing. But blacks have made it almost into a way of life. They are, by far, the worst offenders.</p>
<p> So all that &#8220;studying&#8221; the commission did for four years, was as useless as most such &#8220;studies.&#8221; Our society knows what the effective remedy would be. But we&rsquo;re too paralyzed by liberal brainwashing and White guilt to put it into place.</p>

		<p>If they cannot afford to provide basic security for the multitude of prisoners locked up in jails and prisons, perhaps they should consider locking up less people.  This could be accomplished by ending the war on some drugs.  Incarceration should ONLY be for people who have violated the rights of others.</p>

<p></p>
<p>That is the point.  We are NOT a civilized society.  Supposedly, the history of prisons in America is one where it becomes more and more humane&hellip;.more and more focussed on rehabilitation rather than punishment.  This is a lie.  Every single aspect of it is a lie.  The truth is that society has stopped, stopping criminals and used lip service to these ideals in order to hide what is happening from a largely clueless and apathetic public.</p>
<p>Rape, robbery, murder and torture are commonplace outside of the prison.  What makes you think it is any different inside?  Or that the excuses and lies used to enable this is any different inside?</p>
<p>Whites live under de facto oppression and extreme racism.  Rape in prison is part of the plan.  Whites could wake up and realize this.  Could fight back by insisting on the things you talk about, serve on jurys and nullify them, if necessary.  But choose not to.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t mistake the power of technology for civilization.  The US is far worse than Germany under Hitler or Russia under Stalin.  Far worse than China under Mao.</p>
<p>But hey, things could be worse.  We could live in North Korea&hellip;.or Britain.</p>

		<p>This article tries to make it sound as if rapes by guards are more numerous than those by prisoners.  Of course, the article may be taking that tone to attempt to somehow deflect from all the black-on-white, prisoner-on-prisoner rapes that occur.  And it&rsquo;s also likely taking the position that all encounters between guards and prisoners or straights and sissified gays are rapes instead of consensual sex.  <br>
Most of what I know about jails and prisons comes from documentaries and TV reality shows, but it appears that some prisons  &mdash;  especially in the West  &mdash;  actually do segregate prisoners by ethnicity.  Or they allow them to self-segregate in ways no less rigid.  Even the tent jails in Maricopa Co. have self-imposed areas for whites, blacks, Chicanos, Mexicans, and Native Americans.  <br>
I also believe the spector of prison rape has grown to mythical proportions.  The saying is that either that everyone will be raped, or everyone is either a rapist or victim.  I recall that when Mike Tyson went to prison, a co-worker stated that now he would know what it&rsquo;s like to be raped.  Oh, really&hellip;.<br>
From what I&rsquo;ve seen, most American prisons have protected areas for prisoners who fear maltreatment by others.  And, as for Holder&rsquo;s lack of action, that&rsquo;s typical of Obama&rsquo;s administration.</p>

		<p>In a sane world we probably would not even have prisons.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, prisons are about the least effective way to correct behavior known. Throw all of the criminal-prone people together, and expect them to learn from each other and reform? One of the many ideas we have that are based on flawed assumptions of human nature. What will actually happen is that the prisoners will &#8220;toughen up&#8221; to protect themselves from the unreformable. </p>
<p>We should probably return to the old school punishments of fines, public humiliation, whippings, banishments (if another country is willing to have them), penal colonies and death for the truly horrible ones.</p>

		<p>There is an assumption by many in our society that those that are raped and abused in prison are deserving of such torture, so both our government and people look the other way. Some even mock the act of prison rape as if it&rsquo;s amusing when done to a male. This type of sick thinking reflects the failings of our society. When so many lack sympathy for the very persons that we imprison, many for non-violent crimes, then we have become a culture of despicable tyrants.</p>

		<p>One of the saddest aspects of prison rape is the extent to which it has become accepted and trivialized.  Fellow whites who are correctly horrified at the idea of women being raped somehow find male rape funny.  It almost has the tacit approval of a significant portion of the population.</p>

		<p>Jewamongyou has it spot-on.  The US not only incarcerates a higher percentage of its population than any country in the world, but a higher absolute number, more even than China, a police state with four times our population.  President Eisenhower warned us about the rise of a &#8220;military-industrial complex&#8221;, but the recent bloated growth of a &#8220;law-enforcement-prison complex&#8221; has raised no similar alarm bells.  Complete legalization of marijuana would be an excellent start at reducing this problem.</p>

		<p>The suggestions about separating inmates by sex,race,and age would be a great idea. Another one would be using corporal punishment for lesser offenses instead of prison. It would save taxpayer&rsquo;s money and the embarrassment of being whipped may scare some straight.</p>

		<p>Two things would go an ENORMOUS way to create penal reform. End the ludicrous &#8220;war on drugs&#8221; (as crazy as the prohibition-era &#8220;war on alcohol&#8221; in the 1920&rsquo;s was) and strict racial segregation of all prisons. The latter action would end all INTER-RACIAL violence and greatly reduce black-on-white rapes. My cousin is a prison guard. The things he has told me over the years have chilled my soul.</p>

<p>Also, the White guy has to live with the possibility that he contracted HIV. Here in Texas,  they threw a married White man into jail for hunting squirrels illegally. His cellmates were a bunch of non-White thugs who were hardened criminals. They raped him and he later found he was HIV+. Now he&rsquo;s suing the county he was in. Don&rsquo;t blame him but it destroyed his life.</p>
