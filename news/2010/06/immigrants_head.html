<h1>Immigrants Head to NM Ahead of AZ Law</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ian Schwartz, KRQE-TV (Albuquerque), June 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hispanic advocacy groups in Albuquerque said Arizona&rsquo;s controversial immigration law is driving immigrants from there to New Mexico a full month before the law takes effect.</p>
<p>&#8220;There have been about 40 to 50 families that we know of that have moved to Albuquerque,&#8221; Ralph Arellanes, the New Mexico Director of The League of United Latin American Citizens, said.</p>
<p>He said immigrant families are heading east weeks before the law takes effect.</p>
<p>&#8220;Families are coming here from Arizona, specifically because of this law,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Arellanes said fears of deportation have caused the exodus.</p>
<p>Officials with the Mexican Consulate in Albuquerque said as many as 70 immigrants have contacted them about their plans to head to New Mexico from Arizona.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The influx is going to be bring in, not just an influx of students, families,&#8221; she [Centro De La Raza Director Veronica Mendez-Cruz, who runs the Hispanic advocacy department at the University of New Mexico] said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Delgado [Hugo Delgado, a barber] said the new law could also bring trouble too.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess there are some gang members moving over here too,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So I am assuming a lot of the violence happening over there is going to kind of escalate over here.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An estimated 400,000 to 500,000 illegal immigrants live in Arizona, about 10 times as many as New Mexico.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..New Mexico needs to send Arizona a Fruit basket to thank them for all the new immigrants. Are they going to sue Arizona for  all the money they would have to spend taking care of the illegals who fled Arizona.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Arellanes said fears of deportation have caused the exodus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So what?</p>
<p>What is wrong with that?</p>
<p>It would be even better still, if New Mexico enacted a similar law and saw the invaders going back to Mexico proper!</p>
<p>I personally think that is what Comrade Arellanes and other such worthless &ldquo;Hispanic advocacy&rdquo; presidium deputies really fear. That they are going to have to go back to the &ldquo;paradise&rdquo; they built themselves, and not be allowed any form of &ldquo;sanctuary&rdquo; here. Perhaps, even better still again, it might be realized in the real American population&rsquo;s mind that just like taxes, &ldquo;amnesties&rdquo; can be retroactively reviewed and redistributed.</p>
<p>Enough said, other than, may God let it be so!!!</p>

That&rsquo;s why we can&rsquo;t do this thing piecmeal. </p>
<p>At minimum, all border states must pass similar legislation.</p>
<p>I was hoping Arizona would serve as a flagship example to other states, but instead has become the homely red-headed stepchild.</p>
<p>Arizona alone is useless. Just like that uncompleted fence the government decided to stop on the fifty yard line.</p>

<p>First of all, I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s even one Mexican who is leaving Arizona, because of the new law.  It&rsquo;s all political theater, and their entire actions so far are about what a group of children would do.  But, then again, the vast majority of Mexicans are barely literate even in their own language, with many illiterate, so their childish words and actions are to be expected.</p>
<p>And, as far as the gangs are concerned, ordinary mainstream Mexicans form gangs from their regular population wherever they go.  Into the heartland, where they have migrated, working as chicken pluckers and manure shovelers, gangs have formed, so if Mexicans are going to New Mexico they don&rsquo;t really need to bring along their gang members they will form their own gangs when they get there.  With a larger population, New Mexico is going to need more dope to sell and who could better smuggle it and sell it than gangs of illegal Mexican aliens?</p>
<p>If there is any state that deserves more Mexicans it is New Mexico.  Bill Richardson, the Mexican governor there, does for Mexicans in New Mexico what Obama does for blacks everywhere.  They&rsquo;re both anti-white racists and want to see their people dominate.</p>

		<p>This is, unfortunately, the way that liberalism will be destroyed in this country&hellip;..by forcing liberals to absorb ALL of the consequences of their policies.</p>
<p>In this example, the federal government, currently controlled by the most radical of the radical left, wants to flood this country with mexican criminals.  Their supposed goal is that these people will become a permanent democrat voting base.  What people fail to notice, even conservatives, even white nationalists, is that Obama, Pelosi, Reid etc. are doing a fine job of fracturing the tenuous alliance of identity groups that make up the democratic party&rsquo;s voter base and completely destroying their ability to win elections.  Why is that?  It&rsquo;s because their real reasoning behind a de facto open border is they think these people will sow enough chaos that the rule of law breaks down and they can then convince the (heavily armed) US population to accept no holds bar communism.  Yes&hellip;.they are morons.  One has only to look at the total failure of everything they have put a mind to, in order to see that they are delusional and far weaker than they think they are.  God forbid they get their way and the rule of law in the US dissolves.  The results won&rsquo;t be what they intend.</p>
<p>Far more likely is what we see developing.  Most states choose to protect themselves from the consequences of liberalism.  In this case, it&rsquo;s enforcing immigration law and driving mexican drug dealers from their state.  The other side of that coin, however, is that, before they flee back to mexico, they will try other states that tolerate them.  This has the effect of multiplying many times, the problem they are in those states&hellip;.bankrupting their social services and really lowering the standard of living of the US citizens who live there.  Those who pay taxes, simply move&hellip;..to Arizona, further compounding New Mexico&rsquo;s woes.</p>
<p>In the end, New Mexico will do what Arizona is doing, not because they want to, but because they are forced to.  Eventually, people will be so cheesed off that they toss the democrats out of power.  They may never recover from the double whammy of voter anger over what they lost to the democrats policies and the alienation of identity groups.</p>

		<p>As the illicit immigrants are removed from one state, they move and increase their concentration in others. This creates a backlash and laws similar to Arizona&rsquo;s are passed.  The cycle continues.</p>

		<p>New Mexico, with about 45% Hispanic population, probably has the largest such ethnic group per capita in the nation.  Of course, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that law-abiding Mexican-Americans want more welfare, crime, overcrowded schools, or defunct hospitals.  Some of these may have been against the AZ law simply because they feared what is happening.<br>
Every affected state should pass a similar law and force the courts to deal with it.  I saw a Cops TV show situtated in El Paso that showed illegals crossing the Rio Grande in full view of border patrol.  Then one would run as a decoy while others rushed across a busy highway and disappeared into the grounds of an apartment complex.  It looked as out of control as herding cats!  Then it showed Mexican prostitutes being arrested in a sting.  Because the jails were full  &mdash;  according to one cop  &mdash;  one of the arrestees was caught again an hour later!  I had no idea it was this bad!! </p>

		<p>To poster #13, I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; ya&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s like this all over, even in the heartland.  What I don&rsquo;t understand is how there can be so many Mexicans in Mexico that they can put their people, huge numbers of them, in every small town in the entire U.S. of A.  Are there like billions of mexicans?</p>

		<p>As I always point out to the idiots who say it would be too expensive to deport over ten million illegals, you don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>They deport themselves once they realize there&rsquo;s even a slim chance of them being deported.  As &#8220;Operation Wetback&#8221; of the 1950s and now the AZ law have proved.</p>
<p>If we confiscated their assets to pay for their tickets home I doubt we&rsquo;d even have to deport more than 10% before the rest hightailed it out of the state.</p>

		<p>Depending on what the definition of &#8216;family&rsquo; is 40-50 families is the equivalent of 160-350 people.</p>
<p>From the NM side of things, the state government needs to -immediately- start looking at the availability of housing and welfare as well as it&rsquo;s concentration viz a viz other ethnic demographics so that they can start planning upgraded criminal surveillance and possibly changes in zoning.</p>
<p>If the trickle becomes a flood, those living near the effected areas in &#8216;suitable&rsquo; housing (apartments or townhomes or cheap tract homes) will want to look at moving elsewhere _now_.</p>
<p>Overall, I would be very surprised if NM has the kinds of immediate housing to take in the displaced ethnic population from an entire state (we basically went to war in Kosovo to stop this defacto cleansing because we didn&rsquo;t want to start a migrant wave of refugees sprawling their way across poor Southern Europe).</p>
<p>And so you are now looking at -Federal- intervention to stablize (think camps or forced redistribution to other SW/Mountain states) and/or stop the flow at a border crossing.  Which &#8216;state of emergency&rsquo; may or may not give them another hook to tear down SB1070 with.</p>
<p>Finally, if Richardson wants to gain immediate tax benefits and/or welfare credits, he may well be &#8216;convinced&rsquo; to -amnesty- these people himself (good for the goose&hellip;) just to liberate some funds from the Feds to provide immediate support before his state goes bankrupt.</p>
<p>Be careful what you wish for people.  It&rsquo;s not that the long term goals aren&rsquo;t worth it.  But the road to getting there may well be chock full of potholes.</p>

		<p>I agree with  Tejas Tim - this exodus, invasion of the Mestizo illegal invaders needs to flood in to to Texas.</p>
<p>Super rich, traitorous elites, White elites from Texas have been seriously messing up the rest of the nation and not experiencing the pain in Texas.</p>
<p>LBJ, Speaker of the House Jim Wright - George Dubya Bush - these folks all were raised, bred for power leadership in Texas.</p>
<p>LBJ - the worst US President ever opened the 1965 NW immigration flood gates and enabled the Black race riots, Black Welfare underclass that destroyed Detroit, Cleveland, Newark, large parts of Chicago. But for Texans, it was mostly $ for the Space program in Houston, low wage Mestizo labor, such nice, hard working Mexicans, happy to be working on LBS ranch, or the Bush ranch.</p>
<p>I would like to see about 200,000 of the most diseased, violent illegals from Arizona move to&hellip;.</p>
<p>CRAWFORD TEXAS - home of George Dubya Bush!</p>

		<p>   In several newspapers here in southern Ohio, a poll was conducted about Arizona&rsquo;s immigration law. Ohioans over-whelmingly supported the Arizona law and want one modelled after it. Fat chance, though. We have a very liberal governor. He, also, cares little about the will of the people.</p>

		<p>New Mexico is like the Rhode Island or Minnesota of the Southwest. The &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; there tend to be of colonial Spanish stock, but they are hard-left wing and have been consistently on the side of the illegal Mexicans. One reason being, of course, because New Mexico is relatively poor, it did not attract many illegal Mexicans.</p>
<p>If this changes, and Mexicans keep coming in, it might force these hard-left Democrat Spanish to shift to the right, much as the influx of refugees into Minnesota did with the whites there.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, his Republican opponent, John Kasich, is also for open borders when you boil it right down.  He&rsquo;s also a free trader, which goes over about as well as a lady of the night emitting flatulence in a house of worship.  So you&rsquo;re guaranteed to have an open borders Governor for the next four years.  </p>

		<p>I grew up in New Mexico and I can tell you that the 45% hispanic stat is a bit of a misnomer.  As someone said earlier, most hispanics in New Mexico are the descendants of Spanish Colonials.  In fact, a large number are the descendants of Conversos (Jews) who kept their identities hidden.  I can completely relate to the Hispanics in New Mexico.  We&rsquo;re talking about an ethnic group who has been in the state since 1700.  Their last names are unique and not at all like most &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; names you can think of.  They are just not at all like the Mexican and Central American immigrants.  Mainly, they are generally not mestizos. They are of almost pure Spanish heritage.  </p>
<p>I lived in LA for five years and I can tell you that the Hispanics there are COMPLETELY different from those in New Mexico.  They will not get along and this will not end well.  </p>

		<p>I hope so many illegal aliens flee Arizona for New Mexico that the increase in crime and public costs it causes forces that state to pass an Arizona type law.  Then, when the illegals flee for Nevada that state too will be forced to &#8220;go Arizona&#8221;.  It would be wonderful if the trend snowballed in this way.<br>
