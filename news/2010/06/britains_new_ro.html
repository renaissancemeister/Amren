<h1>Britain&rsquo;s New Romance Language Is English</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Quinn, Google News, June 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Love may have its own language  &mdash;  but that&rsquo;s not good enough for the British government.</p>
<p>It wants English, too.</p>
<p>Starting this fall, the spouse of a citizen who is coming from outside the European Union and wants to live in Britain will have to prove he or she has a basic command of English.</p>
<p>The move, announced Wednesday by the new Conservative government of Prime Minister David Cameron, comes as countries across Europe tighten their rules on immigration amid rising unemployment rates and concerns about the ability of newcomers to integrate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Britain, the government is casting the new policy as an effort to promote integration  &mdash;  not to keep out foreigners.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe being able to speak English should be a prerequisite for anyone who wants to settle here,&#8221; Home Secretary Theresa May said in a statement. &#8220;The new English requirement for spouses will help promote integration, remove cultural barriers and protect public services.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The new measures have been criticized by civil libertarians, lawyers, and activists. Some say the changes discriminate against people from countries with few English speaking traditions, such as in Africa and Asia. Others call them an intrusion into citizens&rsquo; private lives.</p>
<p>Some also argue that English is best learned in a country where it&rsquo;s spoken everyday, rather than forcing people into classrooms abroad, which could be of varying standards and potentially costly. Spouses will have to show evidence to British authorities that they&rsquo;ve passed an English test with a government-approved provider.</p>
<p><b>Language requirements vary across Europe.</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But some Britons argue that it&rsquo;s only natural for newcomers to learn the language of their host nation.</p>
<p>Dennis Weeks, a 38-year-old civil servant from east London, said he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to participate in another country&rsquo;s culture if he didn&rsquo;t speak the language, so it seems fair that immigrants to Britain learn some English.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Currently, spouses are granted visas which allow them to come to Britain for about two years, after which they can apply for permanent residency  &mdash;  which requires a citizenship and language test.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forcing husbands and wives to take language tests before they even arrive in the U.K. will rip families apart,&#8221; said Hina Majid, the policy director of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, a London-based advocacy group.</p>
<p>&#8220;These new rules are likely to hit people from South Asia and Africa where English is not the main language. It may also hit women harder and discriminate most against the poorest.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The measures were first tabled by Britain&rsquo;s Labour government in 2002. Last year, about 38,000 spousal visas were approved, and another 21,000 people were granted permanent residency.</p>

		<p>Britain is no different from the rest of Western Civilization.  She is slowly dying, one immigrant at a time. The whole idea of having a need to &#8220;promote integration&#8221; actually shows the failure of the multicultural and diversity policies of government.  </p>

<p>In fact, English is not just Britain&rsquo;s language but the WORLD&rsquo;S international language, and the one which is understood by MORE people in Asia and Africa than any other foreign tongue. Indeed, it is the official language or second language of much of Africa.</p>
<p>So, imposing a requirement to understand English means making it the easiest requirement that any such requirment could be. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Spouses coming from outside the EU will have to prove they speak English.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Euro and the EU are predicted to collapse as a unified group within five years by Russia and sometime within a five year period by various other experts.</p>
<p>So, with no longer an existing confederation as the EU, the rules and regulations will be worthless.</p>

Even if some are caught, we can be sure that many others will get away with their loot to some sheltered offshore haven.  And there will be, as always, immense profits made from the collapse of the EU and its economy. If they sense the impending collapse, they&rsquo;re probably short-selling frantically right now.</p>

    I follow your point, but an enormous proportion of Bangladeshis and Pakistanis living in England can hardly utter a word of English, despite spending years if not decades in England.<br>
 Most of them have never performed paid employment in their lives, despite benefitting from all the accoutrements an advanced nation such as England can offer, they basically shut themselves off in their own self-imposed little Urdu speaking ghettoes, import non-English speaking spouses from their homeland (to boost their own ethnic genetic interest)and generally form a &#8216;nation within a nation&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>The new Conservative government is very serious about cracking down on and ending immigration from outside the EU. They learnt their lesson from the election where the only seats in the south and midlands of England that returned labour MPs were ethnic minority areas.<br>
The BNP can and will influence as well as lead the debate but, it is the main centre right party that will only ever be the party with the power to put the policies in place we need.<br>
A real step in the right direction and should be seen in conjunction with the starting of deportations back to Iraq and Afgahnistan etc. The tide has turned.</p>

		<p>The Western nations wanted immigrants to fill a dwindling supply of workers and tax-payers, yet what they&rsquo;re getting is a large number of welfare recipients and criminals.  If someone coming to Britain can&rsquo;t speak English, then he&rsquo;s a problem just waiting to happen.  </p>

		<p>I applaud Britain for standing up for its own language.  The country is not trying to preclude people from retaining their former language,  they are only asked to learn the mothertongue of the country willing to take them in. I am a native English speaker, but if I moved to a country in which English was not the predominant language, then I would try to learn the language around me.  It would be a matter of respect, of humbling myself and not expecting everyone around to accomodate me. </p>
<p>Moreover, the country isn&rsquo;t even asking for English fluency.  The article specifies that Britain is requiring only a &#8220;basic command&#8221; of English.  This is not an unreasonable request. </p>

<p>Look at the liberal entitlement mentality. They act as if discrimination is wrong, as if Britons shouldn&rsquo;t have a say in who comes into their country. Discrimination is simply making a choice. It&rsquo;s tiresome that so many try to paint it as a dirty word. Yes, the law does discriminate. So what? I say it doesn&rsquo;t discriminate enough.</p>

		<p>I agree with Mr. Digby.</p>
<p>Despite having an advantage with English due to historical reasons, it seem like &#8220;representatives&#8221; of the Banglaeshi, Pakistani, and Indian communities are more interested in the creating an even larger &#8220;city within a city&#8221; and not bothering much about becoming part of the English culture.</p>

<p>  &#8220;Can I travel back in time to correct the problem?&#8221;</p>
<p>In my opinion the &#8216;problem&rsquo; started in 1914 with the advent of world war one, which was known as the great war until 1939. All of the white and western world&rsquo;s current problems begin from this self-destructive and incredibly stupid war.</p>

<p> The answer is to just say no.   Britain is a country of 70 million or so people crammed into an area about the size of Oregon.  They don&rsquo;t need immigrants at all.   Immigration is a policy of racial genocide against whites by the treasonous  left.  All other aspects, - economics, language, clothing, etc.- are basically irrelevant.   In the end things like this and the burqua ban are just ways to sell colonialism to the natives,  pretense that chicken manure laws will be able to control the tidal wave that mass immigration and becoming a (hated) minority in your own homeland entails.   </p>
