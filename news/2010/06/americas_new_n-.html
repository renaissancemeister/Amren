<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Releasing tomorrow, &#8220;Negrophilia: From Slave Block to Pedestal  &mdash;  America&rsquo;s Racial Obsession&#8221; is published by WND Books. No stranger to brash actions, Rush, who&rsquo;s black, sparked a national furor when he came forth to expose the anti-American ravings of President Obama&rsquo;s longtime minister and then &#8220;spiritual adviser,&#8221; the Rev. Jeremiah Wright.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whites succumb to Negrophilia when, believing that people of color are somehow more benevolent and less corruptible than themselves, they develop an undue affinity for them,&#8221; says Rush.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blacks suffer worse. They&rsquo;re denied accountability for their own actions,&#8221; he continues. &#8220;They&rsquo;re shackled with accepting the nobility  &mdash;  no matter how lacking  &mdash;  of all black &#8216;leaders.&rsquo; They&rsquo;re ripe for the &#8216;rescue&rsquo; of predatory, opportunistic members of the black community  &mdash;  in concert with white politicians scheming for personal enrichment.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;What Rush has here,&#8221; Farah [says Joseph Farah, founder and CEO of WND Books] continued, &#8220;is nothing less than the definitive book on racial politics in America.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While acknowledging the power that the mere mention of race has to paralyze honest conversation, Rush still persists in making several bold proclamations, and puts forth thoroughly researched and footnoted insights that upend many &#8220;perceived racial realities.&#8221;</p>
<p>From the definition of poverty to the early days of the Civil Rights movement to its infusion throughout the culture, Rush puts forth:</p>
<p>* That black Americans did not heroically wrest equality from an unwilling white majority.</p>
<p>* That many of black Americans remain poor and ignorant because that&rsquo;s the way many politicians and activists want them to remain.</p>
<p>* That few are saying anything even remotely resembling the truth when it comes to the politics of race in America.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>* Why, if &#8220;whitey&#8221; had really wanted to &#8220;get&#8221; black Americans, they&rsquo;d be &#8220;got.&#8221;</p>
<p>* That prior to 1970, blacks were among the most socially conservative groups in America.</p>
<p>* That the global financial crisis was brought on in large part due to well-organized activists, ostensibly acting on the behalf of black Americans.</p>
<p>* How the worldview promoted in America is just as racist as that held by many whites prior to the Civil Rights Movement.</p>
<p>* That in America, there are freedom fighters and there are those who would enslave all of us, regardless of race  &mdash;  and it&rsquo;s time to choose a side.<br>

		<p>MSM will put an end to this nonsense.  No Whites will be allowed to believe that they don&rsquo;t &#8220;need to do more to atone for the sins of segregation&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Look for Newsweek and MSNBC to do hit pieces on this mulatto author. </p>

		<p>It sounds like an interesting book, but we have to realize that Blacks usually - the ones who CAN write books - have an agenda FOR Blacks.  Take that statement above stating, </p>
<p>&#8220;How the worldview promoted in America is just as racist as that held by many whites prior to the Civil Rights Movement.&#8221;</p>
<p>The world view I think that he&rsquo;s talking about might be the bringing of &#8220;Democracy&#8221; to the Middle East.  I&rsquo;m just guessing, but if that&rsquo;s the case, I think many people are aware that it is a scam.  There are elites with an agenda there and I can agree with that.  One statement above that&rsquo;s certainly true is,</p>
<p>&#8220;That black Americans did not heroically wrest equality from an unwilling white majority.&#8221;</p>
<p>No Blacks did not.  They had a lot of help from people who, by helping Blacks, actually were covertly advancing their own cause.  It has become very obvious in the intervening years exactly &#8220;who&#8221; they are.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think whites really believe blacks are more benevolent and less corruptible than themselves.  Not even liberals believe that.  If they did they would want to work and live with blacks.  They would also want to hire blacks en masse. But most whites go to great lengths to avoid black neighborhoods and black school districts.  And they hire blacks often as a result of AA pressure.</p>
<p>Whites are conditioned to praise blacks; that is true.  But actions speak louder than words, and whites cringe when they see the demographics changing their neighborhood.  Whites quietly relocate to a new neighborhood before it is too late.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Whites succumb to Negrophilia when, believing that people of color are somehow more benevolent and less corruptible than themselves, they develop an undue affinity for them,&rsquo; says Rush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is the most insightful point (might we call it the thesis statement) of this article.</p>
<p>Mr. Rush might make an excellent point above, but he will never fully grasp why he is doing so. The genetics of racial questions are far more important, than the sociopolitical aspects of the same; the genetics are the core, where the others are only reflections of what is intrinsically produced and not externally malleable considerations. </p>
<p>Look, the big &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; modality in psychology for the last 25 years or better, has been the Cognitive-Behavioral model. This translates into how your thoughts influence your actions; not a bad &ldquo;only&rdquo; method, for those devoid of true mental pathologies. However, it is not the best method for those with clear genetic or biochemical abnormalities in their neurology and related psychological functioning either. In the latter case, it is only supportive therapeutic counseling, secondary to and based upon critical psychiatric interventions and recommendations.</p>
<p><br>
In the greater racial terms of this debate, whites are overly intellectualized and empathic and seem to be genetically predisposed toward this; nonwhites are under: dynamic, intellectualized, empathic, and creative to varied degrees. This does not mean we are incapable of building societies that foster and protect us, only that our worse inclinations (&ldquo;utopian&rdquo; constructs) seem to hold unrealistic cognitive/behavioral methods and outcomes.</p>
<p>For example: &ldquo;The White Man&rsquo;s Burden&rdquo; is unrealistic only so far as it promotes sentimental &ldquo;equality&rdquo; thoughts and actions, over the more rationally conceptualized and managed Apartheid model.</p>
<p>In short, we can&rsquo;t make them white; however, we can dominate and force them to act better and in ways, that nonwhites on their own inherently just can&rsquo;t ever be expected to accomplish!</p>
<p>Enough said!!!</p>

		<p>Certainly an interesting piece, to say the least. I would disagree, however, that most whites suffer from &#8220;Negrophilia.&#8221; They in fact suffer from raciphobia, the fear that any disapproval of black behavior, however obliquely expressed, will get them labeled as racists, for which they could be sued, even prosecuted, or at best excluded from &#8220;polite&#8221; company.</p>
<p>I doubt that a majority of whites, upon reaching adulthood (and assuming they&rsquo;re not esconced in academia) have any real illusions about black propensity for criminal, destructive, and anti-social behavior. However, they certainly have good reason to be reticent about giving voice to their well-considered and founded opinions and observations.</p>

		<p>Many young whites are black supremacists.  They believe blacks are far superior to whites in every way.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t believe this because of their own observations and thoughts.  They believe it because they&rsquo;ve been trained to believe it by the schools and media.  They&rsquo;ve been trained as if they were dogs.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these young whites are too gutless to think for themselves.  They&rsquo;d rather take the easy way and do and think what they&rsquo;re told by the white hating bigots who trained them.  </p>
<p>They&rsquo;re contemptible.  </p>

		<p> Something I&rsquo;ve noticed in talk radio is that Rush is willing to attack racial sacred cows more much more than he used to. The reason for this is he is losing audience share to Michael Savage and the internet is picking up his people. This is a good thing in that if Rush can say these things and hold his sponers (Most Important) and his listeners he might just break the back of P.C.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad there&rsquo;s at least one black man who understands this.  The notion that blacks freed themselves and took equality from whites unwilling to give it is nothing short of laughable and absurd.</p>
<p>One way to look at it is this - They are only equal as long as whites allow it, because if we wanted we could take away their equal standing in a heartbeat.  It might not be pretty or nice to hear, but that doesn&rsquo;t make it any less true.</p>

		<p>Even in college and professional sports, the system favors Black athletes. It&rsquo;s almost like the goal of a certain elite, is to portray Blacks, physically, as supermen&hellip;</p>
<p>I suppose the idea, is to meake Black males attractive to White women.</p>

<p>I came to many of these (Benjamin Rush&rsquo;s) conclusions, mostly on my own, over the years, and I&rsquo;ve been preaching ever since to anyone who&rsquo;d listen and even some who wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
