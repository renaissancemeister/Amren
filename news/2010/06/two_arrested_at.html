	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A kindergarten graduation ceremony in California got messy on Wednesday after a brawl broke out among 20 adults. Two women were arrested, and the school was placed into lockdown.</p>
<p>Several mothers went onto a field near Puesta del Sol elementary school to discuss something when the fight broke out, Karen Hunt, spokeswoman for the San Bernardino County sheriff said. Several men then got involved and the situation escalated.</p>
<p>According to the Victorville Daily Press, witnesses called the police department&rsquo;s tip line, which led to Thursday&rsquo;s arrests of Marina Vargas, 29 of Hesperia and Queiona Burt, 31, of Victorville.</p>
<p>More arrests could follow, Maureen Mills, assistant superintendent for education services, told the Daily Press.</p>

That&rsquo;s not a Hispanic name.  Although the other is.  Could this be another Black-Latino conflict that the newspaper is not telling us about?</p>

<p>It sure does appear that way. You can rely on the press to play-down that aspect of the fight. </p>
<p>These children sure don&rsquo;t have much in the way of role models, especially when their parents are slugging it out on a field while they watch. </p>
<p>The immaturity of these so-called adults is disgusting.</p>

<p>On the contrary, this is an effective way to look out for ones own self interest. Ones genetic interest, it might be said. These are coping techniques that work well at school and play, and to a lessor extent, at work in the office. Criticizing this behavior would show a painful degree of &#8216;insensitivity&rsquo;, and could even get a white employee fired. &#8216;Cool&rsquo; whites and female ones are not always far behind when it comes to this type of behavior and attitude. Does it depend on conservative white men being the only ones in society who can really do wrong - everyone else earning a free pass? Stay tuned and find out when white men become &#8216;victims&rsquo; too. Of course, suggesting white men might be victims is the number one evil &#8216;Nazi&rsquo; thing one can do in our modern society. Try it and see. <br>

<p>&gt; Whites have been engaging in this sort of behavior at Little League games for decades.  Sorry, but it is true.  There wasn&rsquo;t much of it in the &rsquo;60s when I was playing Little League, but it arrived in the &rsquo;70s in every sport.  I remember thinking that it sprang from the L.A. region as the first bad sports I recall were from there.  But it could have been a &#8220;big city&#8221; thing too.</p>

<p>&gt; This reminds me of something I saw occur right here in little Vancouver, just last Thursday at a nearby major crossstreet.  A big black &#8220;kid&#8221; was walking, followed by a smaller, and younger looking red-headed white boy.  They both had BMX looking bikes, which they were walking.  The black &#8220;kid&#8221; was talking on his cell phone as he walked and the white kid trailed.  Suddenly, he threw his bike down, and just kept walking on without looking back.  The little white boy watched him walk away, and then picked up his bike and made shift to walk both bikes, following like a servant.  As I watched this, I noticed that several other motorists at the stop signal were watching too.  Shapes of things to come - unless we teach that little boy some pride and how to fight for himself.</p>

		<p>My God! Am I reading the demographics in the article correctly?!?!?</p>
<p>Is it true that California&rsquo;s public elementary schools average only 28% White students   &mdash;   less than 1 in 3? Hispanic children outnumber White children by nearly 2 to 1?</p>
<p>I knew the Hispanic takeover was bad, but this is far worse than what we have been led to believe!</p>
<p>Has a nation ever just surrendered completely like this since the Roman Empire fell?</p>

		<p>I moved to Victorville in the 70&rsquo;s when it was a sleepy desert community with an irresistable charm. I witnessed it turn into a majority-minority town with commensurate crime rate before leaving it in 2000.<br>
I saw the same thing happen to my home town of Inglewood California in the 60&rsquo;s before leaving for Victorville.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m too old to move again, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter anymore since the entire country is about to tip over into a majority hispanic/black population. Whites are now just over 60% of the population and the America I grew up in is no more. <br>

<p><br>
Answer:  None that I&rsquo;m aware of. This is unprecedented.</p>
<p>The fact that this is occurring is proof that this is not a healthy society that is behaving normally.  Any normal society or organism would struggle to save itself by coughing up the poison. The fact that Uncle Sam just lies there, passively,  without struggle, is proof that he has been drugged.  Drugged with years of propaganda, indoctrination, guilt, and self-hate.</p>

<p>Yes, and weakened further still with 45 years of massive third-world immigration - both legal and illegal - coupled with government inaction.</p>
