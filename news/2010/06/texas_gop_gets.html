<h1><a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/7050170.html">Texas GOP Gets Tougher on Immigration</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gary Scharrer, San Antonio Express-News, June 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Texas Republicans adopted another get-tough policy on immigration and bilingual education Saturday that some say will make it hard for the party to attract Hispanic voters at a time when the Texas population is turning increasingly Latino.</p>
<p>The platform encourages state lawmakers to create a Class A misdemeanor criminal offense &#8220;for an illegal alien to intentionally or knowingly be within the State of Texas,&#8221; and to &#8220;oppose amnesty in any form leading to citizenship for illegal immigrants.&#8221;</p>
<p>Texas Republicans also want to limit citizenship by birth to those born to a U.S. citizen &#8220;with no exceptions.&#8221; The platform calls for the end of day-labor work centers and emphasizes border security, encouraging &#8220;all means .&nbsp;.&nbsp; (to) immediately prevent illegal aliens.&#8221;</p>
<p>The party&rsquo;s education platform calls for the end of federally sponsored pre-kindergarten, and opposes any mandatory pre-kindergarten or kindergarten.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bilingual education should end after the third year, according to the platform, and non-U.S. citizens should not be eligible for state or federal college financial assistance.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hispanics will make up 78 percent of Texas&rsquo; population growth over the next 30 years, compared with only 4 percent for whites, according to demographic projections.</p>
<p>Minority children already make up 66 percent of the state&rsquo;s 4.8 million public school enrollment  &mdash;  and Hispanics could surpass whites in the state&rsquo;s overall population by 2015, estimates show.</p>
<p>Not one of the state&rsquo;s 181 legislators is a Hispanic Republican.</p>
<p>&#8220;The figures are irrefutable. I am extremely concerned,&#8221; longtime Republican advertising executive and political consultant Lionel Sosa said of his party&rsquo;s future.</p>
<p><b>Need to reach out</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s imperative for Republicans to reach out to Hispanic voters, said GOP campaign consultant and pollster Whit Ayres, president of the American Association of political consultants.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Republicans don&rsquo;t do better among Hispanic voters, we are not going to be talking about how we get Florida back in a presidential election,&#8221; said Ayres, of Alexandria, Va. &#8220;We&rsquo;re going to be talking about how we keep from losing Texas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Houston GOP delegate Stuart Mayper said he&rsquo;s concerned about the party&rsquo;s relationship with Latino voters.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must reach out to these people. If we don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s a big mistake,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Work visas suggested</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The immigration problem can be solved by issuing enough work visas to fill jobs that U.S. citizens don&rsquo;t want, said Sosa, who has worked for seven GOP presidential campaigns, starting with Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s in 1980.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Disconnect&rsquo; with Latinos</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>MALC leader Martinez Fischer believes the GOP&rsquo;s &#8220;disconnect&#8221; with Latinos is beyond problematic.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a plague. Republicans have been afflicted with this illness since the 1860s,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The only difference is their target. Back then it was the Irish and Catholics, today it&rsquo;s Latinos who are largely Catholic  &mdash;  I see a pattern here.&#8221;<br>

		<p>The thing that worries me about all this is the reasons why the states are so hot to enforce immigration all of a sudden.</p>
<p>Mexico has become increasingly unstable.  We all know this. But has it become so unstable that a war with mexico is imminent?  State lawmakers who knew such a thing was soon to come (while most people only suspect or knew nothing) would explain ALOT.</p>

		<p>Both parties pander to the illegal alien and Hispanic population.  There is one problem with that and that is not all Hispanics are illegal aliens, support illegals or hate America.  I would say a good 40 per cent of the Hispanic population considers itself loyal American citizens.  People who want a strong, independent America for their children and grand children.  If the Republicans would just settle on a pro-America platform that was consistent rather than just supporting the anti-flavor of the day they could build a base that was as loyal as the Democrats.  Being Socialist-lite (like Juan McCain) doesn&rsquo;t work.  And they have to mean it, not just mouth something during a campaign and then change spots once they are sworn in.</p>
<p>The Republicans will never get more than 4 per sent of the black vote.  They will never get more than 25 per cent of the Jewish vote.  They will never get the illiterate vote or the socialist vote.  Stop trying to make those folks happy and go for the people you can get but don&rsquo;t try to get.</p>
<p>The white male vote is not a given for the Republicans.  White men want economic security (not government jobs) and fair play (not selling out all our industry to the 3rd world).  They want a legal system that plays fair.  You do not have to be anti-black to want fair play.</p>
<p>White woman, it is assumed, want the nanny state like the blacks do.  I do not think that is fair.  I think white woman want pretty much what is fair and what is fair to their husbands and sons.  I think most white woman don&rsquo;t want the government involved in every aspect of their lives.</p>
<p>Quite frankly I think most middle class Hispanics want the same things whites do.  </p>
<p>Republicans need to stop pandering and groveling.  They need to grow a backbone.  It is possible, look at the Governor of New Jersey.  When you consider how far left the Republicans in NJ are (the Democrats are off the charts) he is amazing.  A whole party of Christies might be able to turn the US around, though the window of opportunity is closing.<br>

		<p>I think it&rsquo;s important that states pass anti-illegal laws, regardless of whether they&rsquo;re felonies or misdemeanors.  It gives local officials power to deal with the situation without having to involve the feds, who may or may not act on the problem.  It also sends a clear message that illegals are not wanted and will encourage them to seek greener pastures.  Other states will be pressured onto the bandwagon, and hopefully the Mexicans will go back to Mexico.  <br>
Will 78% of Texas&rsquo;s population growth be Hispanic if illegal Mexicans are run out of the state?  Right now, the majority is white, and it can control the vote.  The left has been busy demonizing AZ, but will soon have to throw some bile at other states that are proposing anti-illegal measures.  Before long, the list is going to be so long that the bleeding hearts are going to look like a hapless minority.  They&rsquo;ll hopefully just slink into the shadows at that!</p>

<p>People (or should I say gutless Neo-Con Republican quislings) like Comrade Ayres, simply make me sick to my stomach. For close to 50 years now, they could have stopped this mach of the &ldquo;undocumented,&rdquo; but they didn&rsquo;t; in fact, in their arrogant and shortsighted stupidity, they willfully encouraged it. They were always &ldquo;forbearing&rdquo; and even &ldquo;embracing&rdquo; with regards to this &ldquo;new potential conservative white ethnic&rdquo; voting bloc, that they missed the fact that they are mostly not white ethnics and far from conservative. To compound their obvious sociopolitical ineptitude or even worse, their diabolical socioeconomic intent, they have even gone so far as to openly destroy anyone in the party who dare breech this &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; dogma of theirs. </p>
<p>Bertolt Brecht once satirically observed: &ldquo;If the government doesn&rsquo;t trust the people, why doesn&rsquo;t it dissolve them and elect a new people?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Ironically, that is exactly what the Communist Party USA (oops, I mean the Democrats) have openly tried to do from 1964 and onwards; since roughly 1984, the Republicans have openly helped themselves to an assisted political annihilation by the same methods and sophistry. They were just and remain to this day, utterly and hysterically blind to that fact or Titanically indifferent to it. In 1992 and 1996, they more than proved it when orchestrating Mr. Buchannan&rsquo;s primary defeats and abjectly compounded their folly in 2008 by having the &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; Comrade McNbrains  as their nominee.</p>
<p>Enough said, other than, God help us all!</p>

		<p>The question isn&rsquo;t whether the GOP is going to lose the hispanic vote in large measure. Of course it is. It always has and it always will.</p>
<p>The question is how long it will take for Democratic white voters to realize that their party no longer represents their interests.</p>
<p>In the border states the future for whites is bleak. The Democratic party has become the party of multiculturalism, big government racial patronage systems and huge public employee unions composed largely of non-whites.</p>
<p>Whites understand intuitively that they&rsquo;re not welcome, but they have yet to be able to articulate why. At some point the GOP needs to go from being implicitly white to explicitly, overtly so. Or else fade into oblivion.</p>

		<p>Getting tougher on immigration now seems somewhat laughable. If ethnic Mexicans/Lations will be the majority within five years, and the voting majority within the next twenty-five, it matters very little what the Republicans or the Democrats do regarding Latinos.  Latinos will either use their majority within one of the two parties to express their will upon the State, or more likely, once reaching the point of epiphany, will start their own third party based upon &#8220;LaRaza&#8221;.  In ANY CASE, the future of Texas and the entire SouthWest will revert to being more under the influence of Mexico than of the United States.</p>
<p>- &ldquo;oppose amnesty in any form leading to citizenship for illegal immigrants.&rdquo;: Whether citizen or not, they are still in the United States.  Whether legal or illegal, if the benefits are similar (welfare, education, etc. or even if they maintain any kind of employment), what difference does it make?</p>
<p>- &#8216;want to limit citizenship by birth to those born to a U.S. citizen &ldquo;with no exceptions.&rdquo;&rsquo;: This would have worked better had it been implemented in 1865, or even 1965.  To try it now, again, what difference does it make?  Just what will such a measure change for Texas?</p>
<p>- &#8220;Bilingual education should end after the third year, according to the platform, and non-U.S. citizens should not be eligible for state or federal college financial assistance.&#8221;: This will only be in place until Latinos are the voting majority, after which it will then be repealed&hellip;</p>
<p>- &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be talking about how we keep from losing Texas.&rdquo;: Sounds like it&rsquo;s already to late.</p>
<p>  The issue now should be a discussion on where to have the new Southern border, and to cease further immigration.  Short of that, the border moves ever further North, or becomes irrelevant.</p>

		<p>Every time politicians dare to toughen enforcement of our immigration laws the press warns darkly that they will &#8220;lose the Hispanic vote&#8221;.  Why should we want a bloc of voters who will only vote for politicians who turn a blind eye to illegal behavior?  And does it ever occur to the press that if politicians don&rsquo;t get serious about enforcing immigration law they will lose the white vote (and much of the black vote)?<br>

<p>I guess Republicans in Texas finally figured out how fruitless it was to pander to Mexicans who would never join the Party when the Democrats have so much more to offer in terms of welfare, food stamps, housing, free health care, etc.  They were pandering while the Mexicans were patiently waiting for their numbers to dwarf theirs so they could take political control of the state.  </p>

		<p>It was pure foolishness to let the gene pool shift so much.  Is it possible to turn the tide?  How do you get rid of all these Third World people?  There is no strong move toward changing the tide.  It looks like just pure talk.  If it was serious these people would be leaving en mass and stop trying to get in.  These hispanic voters will vote their own kind in which means taking over this country without firing a shot.  Perhaps, the whites will have to start another country but a critical mass will be necessary.  The whites in South America, Africa, etc. are not the policy makers.  They are barely surviving in a Third World country.</p>

		<p>The Democratic party has become the party of multiculturalism</p>
<p><br>
This is not exactly true.  Although the democratic party has, for years and years, pushed identity politics, diversity is NOT a strength, it&rsquo;s a horrible weakness.</p>
<p>Obama is the ultimate example of this.  They managed to push him through, but not because he is black, because he is white.  White liberals would NEVER have voted for a real black man&hellip;.someone like Jesse Jackson or Rev Sharpton.  Although given lots of lip service, these guys never made it passed a couple percentage points in all the elections they ran in.</p>
<p>For a long time, blacks have actually voted for whites, so as to push the democrat agenda.  They put aside race in order to get goodies.  Well, those days are over, as the recent upset in the SC senate race shows.  Blacks will vote for blacks and blacks ONLY.  The other identity groups will do the same.</p>
<p>The democratic party is NOT the party of multiculturalism.  Not anymore.  Diversity has officially failed.  Obama is a spectacular failure, not only manifesting the very worst fears whites have of voting for a black, but also teaching blacks that elections are about race and race ONLY.  The democratic party is officially balkanized.</p>
<p>They are finished.  The republicans may not attract hispanic voters but under these circumstances why should hispanics vote democrat?  Blacks won&rsquo;t vote for a non-black, hispanics won&rsquo;t vote for a non-hispanic, etc. is the new bottom line.</p>
<p>Whites are still the largest voting block in this nation.  With the fracturing of the democratic party&rsquo;s voting base along racial lines, that leaves whites, by default.</p>
<p>The non-whites have done our work for us.  The question is, what now.  How to hammer away at this weakness until we drive non-whites from our lands.</p>
<p>Arizona is a good indication of the way things are turning.  Not the law, specifically&hellip;.the attitudes behind the law.</p>

		<p>McCain wasted his entire political career pandering to hispanics.</p>
<p>But when it came time to cash in on his pandering in the 2008 election, his support evaporated.</p>
<p>Hispanics put their race first, and voted for the darker candidate. When you look at Obama&rsquo;s record on immigration vs. McCains, it is clear who has pandered to hispanics more.</p>
<p>And ironically, McCain as a president would have pushed amnesty through with the Democrats in congress - unlike Obama who burned all his political capital on healthcare.</p>
<p>So both in terms of effectiveness and history, hispanics didn&rsquo;t vote for Obama because of policies, but rather clearly because of race.</p>

		<p>The only way to keep the hispanic population from electing a policy amenable to their own racial bias is to push them out.  The Feds won&rsquo;t do that and they won&rsquo;t let the Texans chock-a-block do so, even if they secede first.</p>
<p>Since &#8216;redefining the southern border&rsquo; is the same as secession as a slap in the face to the centrist federalism that has ruined this nation since the Civil War (i.e.  It could encourage other States to try as a function of throwing off the yoke of federalist manipulation and debt), that outcome will not be allowed either.</p>
<p>Given the Texans can only protect their racial as much as citizenship privileges by making it an &#8216;all or none&rsquo; approach to evicting illegals and settled mexicans (who will back their mestizo buddies) in sufficient numbers to sustain a dominant white majority, the &#8216;human rights abuse&rsquo; outcry will bring in federalized forces such as will make Little Rock look like a traffic stop.</p>
<p>In all likelihood, the ever loosening grip of Posse Commitatus and the essentially dead 4th Amendment will result in U.S. troops being brought in to &#8216;stabilize the region&rsquo; while setting up a joint government office or commission of some sort, similar to what has been done in Kosovo, making Texas a &#8216;neither nor&rsquo; open territory again.</p>
<p>What this would do would be to defacto open up the middle of the nation (staunchly white and Republican) to a defacto NAFTA/freetradezone system by default.</p>
<p>Knowing that we would never accept being Mexico&rsquo;s little brother with trade goods trucked in from her ports and a Mexican consulate in Kansas City or wherever, this deliberate &#8216;to the breaking point&rsquo; attempt at supranationalism is the way forwards to OWG.</p>
<p>That said, the easiest thing to do to prove this an inappropriate and unworthy endeavor may be to let it simply happen.  You will either end up with /another/ mestizo slum as White Flight exodus robs the state of sophisticated business (and as the Mexicans come a&rsquo;runnin&rsquo; after white&rsquo;s new homes from -their- state, you shoot them in the face).</p>
<p>Or you finally have a stable mestizo nation which is free from Mexico&rsquo;s avarice and corruption and encourage -them- to fight the good fight at -their- southern border.</p>
<p>Either way, a misdemeanor is laughable and siezing the day over States Rights as essentially the deterministic desire to sustain white cultural dominance (of the rich) in Texas itself is going to be unsustainable in the face of today&rsquo;s &#8216;racist = anything in indigene interests&rsquo; attitudes.</p>
<p>If it truly gets serious (and Latino&rsquo;s flex their thusfar lackadaisacal political muscles with the assistance of La Raza and the Democrats if not Mother Mexico), what you probably need to look at is the South African model of people fleeing Johannesburg for the coastal cities as the final bastions of white safety.  Preparing for that influx, presumably welcome, will be it&rsquo;s own problem.</p>
<p>At which point the question becomes &#8216;what exactly will the Texans do?&rsquo;  Since North Texas is essentially desert, DFTW and Houston are stuck in the middle and all the ports and whatnot that serve our economy are in the South and East (already overrun by poor Mexicanos), you will have to hang onto all of the state for any of it to be worthwhile.  And yet I don&rsquo;t think there is enough nationalist interest to make that happen.</p>
<p>Which means that there may be several years of creap effect with Mexican interests slowly subsuming the state before a major policy or electoral decision pushes things to a boil.  And again, if it &#8216;comes along slowly enough&rsquo;, by the time the Texans get their act in gear, it will only be in time to flee.</p>
<p>Arizona&rsquo;s &#8216;migration&rsquo; problems may only just be beginning.</p>

And yet we do everything possible to proclaim them &#8216;equal&rsquo; which allows them to infiltrate nonetheless.  That is the real conundrum here.  And only whites can find the truth of an answer to their own hypocrisy.  Before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>

		<p>The GOP can not attract many Hispanic voters anyway, for the simple reason that the GOP&rsquo;s party platform - for much of our recent history, anyway - has not been geared toward buying votes from dysfunctional, nonwhite bloc voters by promising them tax-funded goodies.  The Democrats have made a specialty out of doing this ever since they abandoned blue-collar whites in the 1960s.  As such, the Democrats have always had an edge - and always will - when it comes to attracting the votes of dysfunctional ethnic/racial minorities.  They&rsquo;re getting the votes because they are using our money to purchase them.  In this light, GOP members are clearly delusional if they think cracking down on illegal aliens is going to cost them votes.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m happy that Texas is finally taking action but I&rsquo;m angry that they waited so long and the damage done may not even be reversible at this point.  I was looking at the NUMBERSUSA website about our lost future.  Without post 1965 immigration including illegals our population would have peaked at 255 million in 2020 and then gently declined by about 20 million over the course of another 50 years.  There wouldn&rsquo;t have been any unemployment, the labor markets would have been very competitive, high wages, no White flight, no urban sprawl, falling real estate prices, cheap land; the possibilities are endless.  This immigration debacle was done for greed, pure and simple.  Not as many cars being sold, houses, fewer consumers, less profits.  Replacing the declining population would straighten out their bottom line but then they thought why not just cram as many people as we can get in the door and we can triple and quadruple our profits.  Their actions scream for justice. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Not one of the state&rsquo;s 181 legislators is a Hispanic Republican.<br>
&ldquo;The figures are irrefutable. I am extremely concerned,&rdquo; longtime Republican advertising executive and political consultant Lionel Sosa said of his party&rsquo;s future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why?  The only mestizos that will EVER vote for Republicans are the ones who see that more mestizos means less white cash for them, and these aren&rsquo;t people the Republicans will have to pander to in order to gain their votes.  </p>
<p>The only vote the Republicans have to work for in Texas is mine - the white male vote.  Which they currently get by default because there is no alternative.  If A3P fields a candidate here, they can kiss it goodbye unless they shape up, and fast.</p>

<p>Diversity has officially failed? I wish you were right.</p>
<p>You should tell that to the folks over at Imagine2050, or to the National Council of La Raza, or to the NAACP. I think to a soul, they would say that diversity and multiculturalism is on the ascendancy, not the decline. And they would be right.</p>
<p>Where you&rsquo;re mistaken is in thinking that black and hispanics and other racial minority groups won&rsquo;t vote in common cause. Of course they will, despite their primary allegiance to their own racial identity.</p>
<p>Why you ask? Because they have a common enemy: whites.</p>
<p>This is what I mean by the Democratic Party being the party of multiculturalism. Just as the term &#8220;anti-racism&#8221; is code for anti-white, &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; is also a code word for anti-white. Blacks, hispanics, asians, jews, arabs, etc. are quite content for the time being to unite in common cause against the dominance of the still existent white majority. And sadly, there are far too many white Dem voters who have joined in this anti-white coalition and who are complicit in dismantling America&rsquo;s historic white majority and its culture. They will realize their folly at the point they cease being the majority.</p>
<p>When whites are no longer the majority is when the balkanization among the different races that you talk about will occur. At that point the two-party system might be thrown into question, and it seems very possible that we might see parties emerge that explicitly represent specific racial groups. </p>
<p>But until that time, the Democratic Party will continue to be the party of multiculturalism and diversity, and the GOP will continue being the party of whites who understand on some level that multiculturalism and diversity is not in their own interests, and is in fact actively hostile towards white people. </p>
<p>Or at least we should HOPE that this is the future of the GOP&hellip;</p>

		<p>I think we&rsquo;re fighting a rear-guard action on the demographic front.  However, Anglo voters still have a significant edge in voters.  The Hispanic vote, I&rsquo;ve read, is 20%.  Big, but not yet decisive.  The fact that bothers me more is that illegal immigration passion hasn&rsquo;t been matched by voting prowess.  Politicians listen to the strong borders proponents because it makes sense and we&rsquo;re vociferous.  But some illegal immigrant politicians who should win still lose and vice verse.</p>
