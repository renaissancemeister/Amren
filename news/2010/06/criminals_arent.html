<h1>Criminals Aren&rsquo;t Only Ones Ignoring City Handgun Ban</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Duaa Eldeib, Chicago Tribune, June 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule this month on the constitutionality of Chicago&rsquo;s gun ban, and many believe the justices will strike it down. But, while those on both sides of the gun-rights debate eagerly await the verdict, the decision is essentially irrelevant for many who live in Chicago.</p>
<p>By one expert&rsquo;s estimate, there is a handgun in as many as 100,000 city households, despite the [28-year-old handgun] ban. And gang members or those with misdeeds in mind aren&rsquo;t the only ones who have them. In some neighborhoods, otherwise-law-abiding citizens feel forced to violate the gun ban, they say, to protect themselves and their families.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But based on a study that Ludwig and other experts conducted in 2007 on Chicago&rsquo;s underground gun market, he roughly estimated that as many as 100,000 Chicago households could have handguns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Judging from the available data, there are apparently a lot of people in Chicago who feel strongly enough they need a gun for protection that they&rsquo;re willing to ignore the ban,&#8221; Ludwig said.</p>
<p>The report&rsquo;s authors estimated about 1,400 black-market gun sales occurred each year in the Grand Boulevard-Washington Park neighborhood, &#8220;or about one sale per year for every 30 people living in this very high-crime neighborhood.&#8221; In interviews with more than 100 non-gang members ages 18 to 21 who owned guns, the report found the price was $250 to $400, a serious mark-up above legal prices.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In contemplating what will happen if the court strikes down the ban, Mayor Richard Daley repeatedly has painted a frightening portrait of what might follow, while adding that the city has contemplated the adoption of alternative gun-control measures.</p>
<p>&#8220;The city is committed to upholding the handgun ban,&#8221; said police spokesman Roderick Drew. &#8220;We haven&rsquo;t wavered in that. Every gun taken off the street is one less gun that can fall into the hands of a criminal or a child.&#8221;</p>
<p>The city&rsquo;s problem is highlighted in those cases where residents use their illegal handguns apparently in self-defense. In the most recent case, on Thursday, a 27-year-old South Austin resident had a valid firearm owner&rsquo;s identification card but also a misdemeanor conviction for unlawful use of a weapon. He had pleaded guilty in 2002 to a misdemeanor weapons charge for possessing a 12-gauge shotgun.</p>
<p>In the other case, a 80-year-old Korean War veteran had been asleep at dawn with his 83-year-old wife and 12-year-old great-grandson when he was awakened by a burglar, who shot through the window in an effort to enter. Gun-rights advocates across the country embraced the elderly man as a hero.</p>
<p>&#8220;If any case dramatically illustrates the flaws in this kind of legislation, this case does,&#8221; said Robert J. Cottrol, law professor at George Washington University and a gun-rights expert. &#8220;The choice the Chicago resident has is obey the law and remain defenseless or decide to defend home and family by breaking the law and getting a gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, he said, residents fear that if they don&rsquo;t keep a gun, they&rsquo;ll wind up at the mercy of those who do.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Every year for the last six, Chicago police have set aside a day for people to turn in guns, no questions asked. The number of weapons turned in hints at the greater total on the streets.</p>
<p>At one of the events last month, police collected more than 4,000 guns, other weapons and replicas in exchange for gift cards worth up to $100. Of those guns, 3,335 were handguns. Chicago police said they take in more guns through the program than New York and Los Angeles combined.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Humboldt Park, around the block from where the 80-year-old homeowner shot an intruder, there seemed to be a consensus about two things: Many people have guns, even if they won&rsquo;t talk about it; and many believe they need guns to safeguard their homes, families and possessions.</p>

		<p>The reason Mayor Daley should not be so enthusiastic is that the McDonald case in front of SCOTUS right now really has nothing to do with the 2nd Amendment; it is fundamentally a 14th Amendment case, which is why it will probably be a 9-0 decision for McDonald.  All the case is is figuring on whether the 2nd (whose meaning was clarified with Heller) applies to the states.</p>
<p>Truthfully, McDonald didn&rsquo;t need to happen, because Antonin Scalia, in his majority opinion in the Heller case, didn&rsquo;t strike down DC&rsquo;s handgun ban using the &#8220;Federal jurisdiction&#8221; rationale, he used the 2nd amendment exclusively.  Daley was just waiting out the election.</p>
<p>Now, once Chicago&rsquo;s is struck down, they&rsquo;ll do what DC is doing, and that is making it legally possible to own a handgun, but restrictive in practice.  The Supreme Court should have put DC and should put Chicago under a consent decree, so that every item of their gun laws can get judicial clearance.</p>

		<p>Here in Minnesota the liberals tried to paint nightmarish scenarios of what would happen if concealed carry became law. They predicted a Wild West bloodbath with permit holders aggressively gunning down people over minor fender benders. The law has been in effect now for about three years and there has been NOT ONE case of a permit holder using his weapon in an aggressive manner. All gun crime is still being perpetrated by the same people it was before the new law - blacks. Gun control laws are a perfect example of the liberals getting it wrong so keep it in mind when a liberal asks you for specific examples of their failed policies (being soft on violent criminals in the 60&rsquo;s is another great one).</p>
<p>As an aside, I wonder if Chicago realizes their handgun ban has a disparate impact against whites so it should be overturned on that fact alone, given that disparate impact is one of their favorite lines of legal reasoning.</p>

		<p>In the Police State mentality that pervades most of our government at all levels, the world of the &#8220;lesser people&#8221; is divided into Criminals and Victims.  If you arm yourself to avoid becoming a Victim, then you are a Criminal.  Keeps thing simple.</p>
<p>The additional benefit is that there is more crime, less personal safety, and people are easily led to believe that more Police State will make things better.</p>

		<p>According to &#8220;official estimates&#8221; there are some 100,000 households in Chicago that have guns.</p>
<p>I think the actual figure is much higher. People are not going to admit they have guns in the house.</p>
<p>If, as expected, SCOTUS overturns Chicago&rsquo;s handgun ban, people are going to go out and buy firearms legally, and in droves. Daley and his cops will lose their stranglehold of power.  </p>

		<p>Naturally, innocent whites are gonna arm themselves, regardless of any gun ban in the city where they live.  They watch the news, they are used to seeing a news clip with the words, &#8220;the suspect was a black male, in his early 20&rsquo;s.&#8221;  Only truly liberal idiots would think that a handgun ban would stop black criminals from getting their hands on them, to harangue unarmed whites.</p>

		<p>Whenever I hear Mayor Daley disparage gun owners&rsquo; rights I wonder why he doesn&rsquo;t get rid of his Chicago police bodyguard detail.  I think it probably numbers at least thirty.  He grew up at 35th and Lowe Avenue in the city where the Derring Police Station was right across the street from his house.  There was always police officers stationed outside in the front and the back of the house because his father was mayor then, Richard J. Daley.  So he grows up always accustomed to police protection.  The rest of the citizens aren&rsquo;t that privleged though, so we&rsquo;ve been more or less on our own.  Now he is teed off that perhaps the ban on owning a handgun in Chicago will be lifted by the Supreme Court and at least it will be legal to own a pistol once again.</p>

		<p>What a joke! 100,000 people say they have unregulated firearms in Chicago. I`ve lived there and everybody I know was armed to the teeth. The standing joke was before calling 9-11 throw your gun in lake Michigan. The only people busted for having a piece are idiots who tell the cops they have one. When investigating a crime at somebody`s house if it isn`t domestic violence,the cops become myopic and over look the shot gun next to the bed. Half the town is vacant during deer season. They all gun up and head for upper Pennisula Michigan or the entire State of Wisconsin.<br/>
     Carrying a piece around is kind of iffy since Chicago is by far the drunkeness capital of the Universe. All you have to do is stay out of the black and Hispanic free fire zones and you can go around unheeled. Here is another great Chicago adage.&#8221; Why does a Chicagoan spray WD-40 in his glove compartment? He is watering his 38.&#8221; You can have guns and liberty, you can have guns and tryanny but you can not have liberty without guns.<br/>

		<p>How obvious does it have to get that gun laws don&rsquo;t work against the lawless?  Ghetto thugs often have arsenals, sometimes with automatic assault rifles included.  And, even if they had no guns, they can still invade homes with brute strength and threaten people with knives, ball bats, or their fists.  The weak and frail sometimes need guns to protect themselves, and just the thought that a potential victim may have a gun is of some deterent value.  </p>

		<p>Though I didn&rsquo;t come up with these, here are just a few sayings and facts concerning the 2nd ammendment. When guns are outlawed only outlaws will have guns. If you are armed you are a citizen, if not you are a subject. Fear the government that fears your gun. Guns don&rsquo;t kill people, people kill people. The right of the people to keep and bear arms SHALL NOT be infringed. In every single society where gun confiscation has taken place there has been mass genocide. The second ammendment is the glue that lets us keep the rest of them.  In the movie Schindler&rsquo;s list, to be authentic there was disgusting full frontal male nudity, however heaven forbid that they would show the one thing that saved more Jews than any thing, which was the fact he supplied handguns to them. Six million jews, and two million Christians were tortured and exterminated in the gas chambers. You know what they say, history repeats itself.</p>

		<p>In the summer of 2007 I suffered a massive stroke to the right side of my body, severely affecting my ability to do anything useful with my right hand/arm. I was in the hospital for 5 weeks. Three days after I got out, I took my .22 and 9mm and had my husband take me to the gun range. At first I couldn&rsquo;t even raise my arm holding either pistol, but with much practice and perseverance, I am now a straight shot again. I still can&rsquo;t drive myself to the grocery store, but by God, I am safe in my own home alone! I am not foolhardy, but due to my medical problems, I am vulnerable. I cannot run or fight off a mugger, but I can still keep myself in relative safety. Every woman should arm herself, learn to use those arms and refuse to bow to the tyranny of thugs, gang bangers, thieves and the politicians who enable them to prey upon the weaker members of our society.</p>

		<p>It is not the residents of Chicago who are breaking the law by owning a handgun, it is the City of Chicago that is acting illegally by enacting such a law.  The Second Ammendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that the People have a right to keep and bear arms, which shall not be infringed.  A law banning the posession of handguns is an infringement.  It is further stated in the Constitution, that ( I paraphrase), this Constitution, and all laws passed in congruence with it, are the Supreme Law of the Land, anything in any State Constitution, or law notwithstanding.  To put it simply, the City of Chicago (or any other city or state) has no right to pass such legilation; it is null and void from the minute of its enactment.  This is the real point of the whole question; it avoids silly talk and distraction about crime rates.  In our constitutional system, all power and rights reside with the People; any power (government has no rights) the government has, is delegated to it, and may be revoked at any time.  But, our liberal enemies have stood this on it&rsquo;s head; according to them, all rights and powers belong to the government, and we, the serfs, only get what little they see fit to bestow upon us.</p>

		<p>I would say that any law that runs contrary to the Constitution is illegal.  The Bill of Rights (that&rsquo;s the first ten amendments) enumerates our rights, it does not grant them.</p>
<p>Any handgun bans are illegal because they run contrary to the Second Amendment.</p>
<p>I believe that whether or not guns are banned is only one factor in a city&rsquo;s crime rate.  Another huge factor is, shall we say, demographics.</p>

		<p>As white people continue to exit Chicago the city is taking on the character of the people who remain; blacks and latinos and we all know what that entails. Chicago is now a complete urban jungle and may well become the next Detroit.</p>
<p>Concerning handgun prices, a visit to a large sporting good chain store revealed an interesting bit of information.  The clerk informed me they don&rsquo;t carry guns under $300.00 because they don&rsquo;t want gang bangers coming in to buy the cheap guns.  He said a competing store carried cheap guns but stopped since they were dealing with minority punks all day.   </p>
