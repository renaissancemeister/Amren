			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Clive Coleman, BBC News, June 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Calling someone a &#8220;coconut&#8221; might sound harmless but it has landed one woman with a criminal conviction. So what qualifies as a speech crime?</p>
<p>Councillor Shirley Brown has been at the heart of Bristol&rsquo;s multi-cultural community for 15 years, but in February 2009 she found herself at the centre of an unintended controversy.</p>
<p>While taking part in a debate in the city council she called a female Asian councillor, Jay Jethwa, a &#8220;coconut&#8221;. The word is used to describe someone who is brown on the outside, but &#8220;white&#8221; on the inside. In other words, someone who is said to have disregarded their cultural roots.</p>
<p>Brown used the word in a debate about the funding of black and ethnic groups in the city, and was upset that Ms Jethwa was advocating cuts. The whole incident was filmed and can be viewed on YouTube (see internet links, right).</p>
<p>Speaking before the trial, Brown explained why she used the word. &#8220;I must admit, I was angry because I thought it was an absolute insult, because she is of Asian background. I was thinking how could you cut funding that is going to impact so many people. So the first thing that came to mind, instead of saying &#8216;you idiot&rsquo;, I said &#8216;you coconut&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although she apologised a few days after the comment, and on several occasions, the matter went to a local and then a national standards hearing.</p>
<p>Brown was reprimanded, briefly suspended from the council and then reinstated. But months later the case escalated when she was charged under the Public Order Act with using &#8220;threatening, abusive or insulting words, with intent to cause a person harassment, alarm or distress&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a serious charge which comes with the threat of a criminal record.</p>
<p>But why, given Brown&rsquo;s numerous apologies, was it necessary to turn this into a criminal prosecution?</p>
<p>In a statement released before Brown&rsquo;s trial, the Crown Prosecution Service defended its approach as being &#8220;in the public interest .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. because it alleged an offence where the suspect demonstrated hostility towards the victim based on discrimination against the victim&rsquo;s ethnic origin&#8221;.</p>
<p>On Monday Brown was convicted, given a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay costs.</p>
<p>The judgement is an important development in what might be called &#8220;speech crime&#8221;.</p>
<p>But what can and can&rsquo;t people say?</p>
<p><b>Thatcher gibe</b></p>
<p>The case re-opens the debate on political correctness and freedom of speech which last flared up so publicly when TV presenter Carol Thatcher used the word &#8220;golliwog&#8221; in the green room of the BBC One programme The One Show.</p>
<p>Ms Thatcher was dismissed from the show, but not prosecuted for the use of the word.</p>
<p>So while &#8220;coconut&#8221; can be a speech crime, is &#8220;golliwog&#8221; more acceptable in the eyes of the law?</p>
<p>Although there are clear differences between the two incidents, Brown&rsquo;s case seems to establish that anyone directing the word &#8220;coconut&#8221; at a black or Asian person is liable to be prosecuted, in spite of any subsequent apology.</p>
<p>Had the impulsive councillor said something along the lines of &#8220;you have disregarded your cultural roots&#8221;, she would almost certainly not have been prosecuted. It was the use of the word &#8220;coconut&#8221; to convey that sense which resulted in her facing trial.</p>
<p>And coconut is not the only word used to signify that a person has disregarded their cultural roots.</p>
<p>Others include &#8220;Oreo&#8221;, the biscuit which is black on the outside and white on the middle, and &#8220;banana&#8221; which has been used in the Chinese community to signify &#8220;yellow on the outside, white on the inside&#8221;.</p>
<p><b>Heart of identity</b></p>
<p>Such words are now hugely charged and it would be difficult for the Crown Prosecution Service to fail to prosecute in cases where they are used against an individual from the racial or cultural group concerned.</p>
<p>The words and the level of &#8220;threat, abuse or insult&#8221; which they convey is very subjective. Some people regard the word &#8220;coconut&#8221; as highly derogatory. It can be seen as going to the very heart of a person&rsquo;s cultural identity and amount to an accusation of betrayal.</p>
<p>Bristol&rsquo;s multi-cultural community were clearly hurt and concerned by the comment from an elected councillor.</p>
<p>To one prominent member of that community, at least, coconut has only one legitimate meaning.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not acceptable, unless you&rsquo;re talking about a fruit on a palm tree,&#8221; says Amarjit Singh, who manages an Asian day centre in a suburb of the city. &#8220;Otherwise it is a racist comment. They should know better, they&rsquo;re the policy makers. They&rsquo;re the ones that promote community cohesion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others take the view that the word is only mildly abusive, whilst some do not find it threatening or abusive at all. The way in which it is said, the context and reaction of the person at whom it is directed will all be important factors in considering a prosecution.</p>
<p>But in the age of speech crime, a prosecution for the use of the word can now never be discounted</p>

<p>It is really ridiculous how the so called liberals deliberate the people. Liberal means free. Today we must be scared to read the wrong thing, to say the wrong thing, to thing the wrong thing. &#8220;Liberals&#8221; made the world a none-free place like nobody had ever seen before.</p>

		<p>Yet, nowhere is there a discussion of racism itself. Isn&rsquo;t the very basis of the conflict, racism? Funding groups by race, and for no other reason than their race, if not for the express purpose of highlighting the importance of race, then certainly with this as a major byproduct. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be the most heinous racism, almost certainly to end up in court, with the proceedings of major interest to word news operations, if whites were even to Think of, or Propose doing, this? Yet, not even the hint of a discussion in this regards is included in the article. I suppose, that would be racism, too. </p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see, she didn&rsquo;t threaten her and harassment is when one repeatedly bothers  someone ie.follows them etc., that didn&rsquo;t happen here. As far as insulting someone or causing them distress, well you could charge anybody for saying anything that makes you angry or upset. The White race has gone crazy.</p>

		<p>When I was in the UK, I  read British newspapers and editorial comments on occasion and at times would see the nastiest comments about Americans that if you replaced the word American with Black or Muslim, would get the person arrested for &#8220;hate speech.&#8221; Of course we all know the hypocrisy of  hate speech it only applies to not criticizing or saying anything about certain protected groups and Americans or Whites aren&rsquo;t part of that group. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve got some complaints to add. I feel offended when people talk about systemic racism. This is supposed to be a type of racism which can result even though individuals do not have any deliberate racist intent. It can also interfere with white people following traditional white ethnic culture. Not enough attention has been given to distinguishing between the two.</p>
<p>We need to stop referring to dirty blonde hair. I still see a lot of this. And the crime of being a peeping Tom needs to be made more inclusive. Tom is a white name, and male to boot. How about peeping Ali, or peeping LaNeesha?</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t it nice that they qoute someone from an &#8220;Asian Day Center&#8221;- a place that by it&rsquo;s very name is racially exclusive and therefore racist. And that person who works in an explicitly racist institution is upset because a native of a country he has immigrated to of his own free will used a word with a negative connotation. </p>

<p>It would be hard to imagine an article about the funding of white racial pressure groups, and the article be about &#8216;racism&rsquo; - (as in a disagreement between the different factions). Those Norwhich skinheads aren&rsquo;t like other skinheads! And this taken seriously. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that ethnic minority communities have come out with derogatory names for minorities who respect and abide by the cultures of the white countries where they&rsquo;re living. Why do these groups live in countries where they think that the native culture is some terrible thing?</p>

		<p>Hate speech laws, now prevalent in much of Western Europe, Canada, and the UK, are perhaps the most perverse and bizarre attack on free speech in recent history. And, of course, these laws apply only to the majority - Muslims throughout these nations are free to vilify Chistians, Jews, indeed, anybody from the mainstream.  </p>

		<p>Free speech is simply dead in Great Britain.  And in Canada, too.  Multiculturalism has killed it.  It is hanging on by a thread here in the United States.  All we need are a few more &#8220;living Constitution&#8221; supreme court justices like Elena Kagan to rule that the First Amendment doesn&rsquo;t mean what it says.<br>

<p>What about the feelings of Bristol&rsquo;s White community? Surely the term &#8216;coconut&rsquo; is actually derogatory to White people. If I called a tight-fisted gentile a &#8216;Jew&rsquo;, or a straight man a &#8216;fag&rsquo; I&rsquo;d be labeled an anti-Semite or a &#8216;homophobe&rsquo;. Shouldn&rsquo;t this person be apologizing to the White community instead?</p>
