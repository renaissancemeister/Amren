<h1>Ill. Police Revoke 1st Muslim Chaplain&rsquo;s Post</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sophia Tareen, Google News, June 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Illinois State Police has revoked the appointment of the agency&rsquo;s first Muslim chaplain, citing only information revealed during a background check. A national Muslim advocacy group Wednesday blamed the move on Islamophobia.</p>
<p>Kifah Mustapha, a Chicago-area imam, was appointed the agency&rsquo;s first Muslim chaplain in December. Community groups had praised Mustapha&rsquo;s appointment as a nod to the growing diversity among the agency&rsquo;s nearly 2,000 officers.</p>
<p>But within days, the appointment came under criticism from the Investigative Project on Terrorism, a Washington-based think tank.</p>
<p>The group alleged that Mustapha was linked to the Palestine Committee of the fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood, a popular movement in the Muslim world that advocates the formation of Islamic governments in the Middle East. It also alleged he raised money for the Holy Land Foundation, a now-defunct Islamic charity whose founders were sentenced last year for funneling money to the Palestinian militant group Hamas. The group cited internal documents and a list of unindicted co-conspirators.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ahmed Rehab, CAIR&rsquo;s executive director in Chicago, called it discrimination against Muslims, especially since Mustapha hasn&rsquo;t been formally accused of wrongdoing.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ISP is kowtowing to the run-of-the-mill fear-mongering that Islamophobes have devoted their careers in order to avoid a public relations controversy,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Emerson [Steve Emerson, executive director of the Investigative Project on Terrorism] dismissed charges of Islamophobia as &#8220;empty diversions and without merit&#8221; in an e-mail.</p>

		<p>What gets me is that the ISP couldn&rsquo;t turn up this information about him with his hands in the jihad jar before they hired him.  Some might say better late than never, but better never than late in this case   &mdash;   He probably had a lot of access to ISP operations that he can wire back to the Middle East, in case any of the purveyors of Muslim funny business want to have a little operation at the formerly Sears Tower.</p>

		<p>We all know that institutions are becoming fully Islamofied, so it&rsquo;s surprising to see a push back.  Look for something big to happen next.   They Muslims can&rsquo;t let this stand and they must show their power as a message to others who may want to push back in the future.  </p>
<p>This story won&rsquo;t go away with the dismissal.  </p>

<p>What a surprise.  The real significance of this article is that yet another politically-correct antiWhite buzzword has been coined to use against us.  First it was Racism, then it was Homophobia, and now we have &#8220;Islamophobia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Funny how there aren&rsquo;t any media shorthand terms for hatred of straight White Gentiles.<br>

		<p>As Dutch politician Geert Wilders pointed out, muslims are permitted by the Koran to lie to infidels when they are in foreign lands. In other words, if a muslim is asked how he feels about non-believers (or any issues) he is provided with the license to lie. Muslims will not reveal their true nature wholly until they are sure that they have the numbers to accomplish their stated goal, which is to dominate the world. Europe is already falling. I&rsquo;m surprised that anyone resisted this imam; I&rsquo;ll be more surprised if the charges of racism don&rsquo;t force them to buckle.</p>

		<p>The problem with truly devout Moslems is that Islam tells them to either convert all non-Moslems by coersion, kill them, or force them into dhimmitude.  The world is to be turned into a caliphate, and this can be accomplished by any means necessary.  Until this can be widely understood, the West will not be able to deal properly with Moslems. </p>
