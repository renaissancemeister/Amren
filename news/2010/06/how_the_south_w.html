<p>On August 30, 1813, Creek Indians attacked Fort Mims, a makeshift enclosure about 40 miles north of Mobile, Alabama. They came in through an open gate and killed every man, woman, and child they could. They picked up small children by the heels and smashed their brains out against the stockade fence. They scalped the women, and cut unborn children out of pregnant mothers. Some 20 to 40 escaped but more than 250 people were butchered. Thus began the Creek War, and Andrew Jackson&rsquo;s first major military command. It was the start of a long career of dealing with Indians, which included much fighting, some friendship, and culminated in the removal West of the Mississippi of tens of thousands of people who stood in the path of American expansion.</p>
<p>Robert Remini, a noted historian and Jackson expert, has written a lively and fair-minded account of the sixth President&rsquo;s Indian policies. He makes the standard apologies for &#8220;racism,&#8221; but fully understands the need to evaluate Jackson according to the standards of the times, and generally seems to have achieved his own stated goal: &#8220;simply to explain what happened and why.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jackson&rsquo;s own life story is a good example of what happened and why. He was born in South Carolina in 1767 at a time of constant conflict with Indians. Like virtually every white who lived on the frontier, Jackson had ample reason to fear and hate Indians. A family member, probably an older brother, was killed by Indians, and as a boy during the Revolutionary War he had first-hand experience of the havoc wrought when an enemy  &mdash;  in this case Britain  &mdash;  stirred up Indians against settlers.</p>

</table><p>At age 21, when he first traveled to Nashville, the trip was a very dangerous one through hostile Indian territory. His band was saved from massacre only because Jackson recognized that what sounded like owls hooting were Indians signaling an attack. He traveled a great deal on business, and seems to have spent most of his young adult years either hunting or being hunted by Indians.</p>
<p>All these experiences convinced him that Indians could not co-exist with whites, and that European powers would constantly be recruiting them to fight against the young republic. Indeed, both Spain and England regularly armed Indians and encouraged them to resist American expansion. All the Indians living along the Gulf of Mexico were susceptible to foreign manipulation, and at least by 1809 Jackson was convinced the only solution was to send them elsewhere. As Prof. Remini emphasizes, Jackson was certainly aware of the value of the land that could be taken from Indians, but his main concern was always to remove what he considered a threat to American security.</p>
<p>The vast territory acquired in 1803 by means of the Louisiana Purchase seemed the perfect place to send these troublesome people and, indeed, Thomas Jefferson himself had been among the first to propose this, writing that if the Indians could not be civilized, &#8220;we shall be obliged to drive them, with the beasts of the forests, into the Stony [Rocky] Mountains.&#8221; Prof. Remini points out that Jackson nevertheless respected Indians who were faithful to their ancestral customs, and did not want to see their heritage disappear under the white onslaught. Removal would protect their customs, make their land available to whites, and secure the frontiers of the United States.</p>
<p>In Jackson&rsquo;s view, one of the great obstacles to achieving this was the government&rsquo;s inconsistent approach to the legal status of Indians. Were Indians members of sovereign nations or were they subject to the laws of state and federal government? George Washington had begun the policy of treating them as sovereign nations with whom treaties were negotiated and sent to the Senate for ratification. However, as the nation grew stronger, it became powerful enough to treat Indian tribes more or less as it pleased, and increasing contact between whites and Indians raised many awkward questions: Was an Indian who killed a white subject to Indian law? state law? federal law? How were contract or trading disputes to be resolved?</p>
<p>At the same time, the United States had neither the means nor the will to abide by its own treaties. These often established areas to be used exclusively by Indians, but the expanding white population kept pushing into them. This often led to violent retaliation not only against the squatters but also against whites just outside of Indian territory. Jackson had no patience for white treaty violators, whom he rightly accused of stirring up unnecessary conflict, and he spent much of his time as a military commander chasing white trash off of Indian land. Indians could count on his evenhanded enforcement of treaty obligations, and chiefs often appealed directly to him to protect their boundaries. However, as Prof. Remini points out, not even the entire American army could police the vast lands held by Indians, and Jackson&rsquo;s frustration with this impossible task only strengthened his resolve to remove the Indians.</p>
<p>Indians sometimes dug up buried American casualties to scalp them, mutilate them, and steal their clothes.</p>

</table><p>The United States, with General Jackson often acting as its agent, carried out contradictory policies. It would swing from outright war with hostile Indians to alliances with friendly tribes. It would sign treaties with peaceable or defeated Indians but renegotiate them as whites increased in number and demanded more land. Jackson was equally determined and ruthless, whether he was negotiating treaties with Indians or killing them.</p>
<p>As a soldier, he had no formal military training but was a natural leader and tactician. He had a commanding presence, an aura of authority, and hard blue eyes that could terrify people. Indians gave him the name Sharp Knife, and some claimed his furious look could kill a man.</p>
<p>Although Jackson never permitted violence against women or children, he gave warriors no quarter. On one occasion, when he was at war with Florida Indians allied with the British, he had a naval commander lure two enemy chiefs on board by flying the British flag. Jackson promptly hanged the chiefs. After the battle of Horseshoe Bend, the decisive engagement of the Creek War, he wanted an accurate count of enemy dead, and had his men clip off the ends of dead warriors&rsquo; noses to make sure there was no double counting. (The total came to 557.) Indians, on the other hand, sometimes dug up buried American casualties to scalp them, mutilate them, and steal their clothes.</p>
<p>Prof. Remini underlines the ambiguity in Jackson&rsquo;s attitude towards Indians. He had no illusions about the compatibility between whites and Indians and wanted them gone. Yet he credited them with great courage, and even set free one captured chief because he so admired the fearless dignity with which he stood before his captors. Nor was he indifferent to what the Indians suffered. During the Creek War he wrote to his wife, &#8220;It is anough to make Humanity shuddar to see the distressed situation of the Indians,&#8221; but this in no way tempered the fierceness with which he pursued his foe.</p>
<p>One of the most famous of Jackson&rsquo;s Indian encounters was his rescue of a 10-month old Indian boy, who was found after a battle in the arms of his dead mother. Jackson raised the boy as his own son, gave him the name Lyncoya, and grieved deeply when the boy died at age 16.</p>
<p>The story of Jackson and Pushmataha is also touching. Pushmataha was a Choctaw who had fought at Jackson&rsquo;s side during the Creek War and at the Battle of New Orleans. This did not stop Jackson from pushing a harsh relocation treaty on the Choctaw in 1820, but the two men were in close professional contact until Pushmataha&rsquo;s death in 1824. Jackson was at the death bed and leaned over to ask, &#8220;What is the last request of the chief?&#8221; Pushmataha whispered, &#8220;Bury me with the big guns firing over my grave.&#8221; Jackson honored that request, laying the chief to rest in Washington, with an artillery salute, two military bands, several companies of soldiers and marines, and all the honors of a brigadier general.</p>

</table><p>But Jackson never let sentiment interfere with duty, whether he was making war or making peace. In his view, the main purpose of treaties was to persuade Indians to give up their land, and he resorted to threats, bribes, charm, and guile to get what he wanted. He liked to make a powerful impression by arriving at the treaty ground with a large military escort. He also brought plenty of liquor with which to loosen up the chiefs, not a few of whom were blind drunk when they signed away their ancestral lands.</p>
<p>These negotiations were an almost farcical blend of feigned friendship, coercion and legal punctilio. Jackson loved to address the assembled Indians as &#8220;friends and brothers.&#8221; Here is a typical opening: &#8220;Friends and brothers! We have been chosen by your father the President of the United States to meet you in council, and brighten the chain of friendship by shaking hands and greeting you as his children.&#8221; Their &#8220;father&#8221; the President, he might go on to say, &#8220;wants to make all his red children happy.&#8221; (The Indians took readily to this paternalist language, and tribes affiliated with the British sent letters to &#8220;our good father, King George.&#8221;)</p>
<p>After this ritual declaration of love, Jackson would stun his &#8220;red brethren&#8221; by demanding that they give up their land and move West of the Mississippi. He would paint idyllic scenes of rivers teeming with fish and forests filled with game, in areas Indian scouting parties had already discovered were rocky scrub land. The government, he would add, was offering to pay generously for their current holdings, would transport them for free, and give them provisions with which to start their new life in the West. If they didn&rsquo;t accept this offer, their &#8220;father&#8221; would be angry, and would do nothing to stop the whites from pouring into their land and despoiling it.</p>
<p>It was invariably an awful deal for the Indians, who by now knew there was no hope of driving the white man back into the sea, and who just wanted to be left alone. The chiefs would reject the offer, and then would come the threats, liquor, and bribes. Jackson hated the process  &mdash;  especially bribing chiefs to, in effect, betray their own people  &mdash;  but he almost always got the treaty he wanted. The appearance of legality would continue with ratification by the Senate.</p>
<p>The payments to the Indians for their land were not huge but they were not derisory either, running into the millions of dollars. By means of these treaties Jackson acquired millions of acres of land for use by whites. The state of Mississippi was so grateful for the land Jackson got for it by means of the Treaty of Doak&rsquo;s Stand in 1820 that it named the state capital in his honor.</p>

</table><p>There was a falseness about the whole process that was not lost on Jackson. Although he took his negotiating responsibilities very seriously and insisted that the government stick to its terms, he thought treaty-making was a mistake. He thought Indians were savages, but did not see why they should not be under American law like everyone else. He thought the United States should drop the pretense of international negotiation, and simply legislate its relations with Indian tribes.</p>
<p>And that is precisely the approach he took as President. Until he took office, Indians had been dealt with through executive agreement, sometimes with the assent of the Senate. Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe all favored removal, and tried to achieve it, but Jackson was the first to regularize the process, by means of the Indian Removal Act of 1830. The act did not pass easily. It won by narrow margins, against the opposition of New Englanders who had settled their Indian problems long ago, and who could afford to strike a &#8220;humanitarian&#8221; pose.</p>
<p>Among Americans today, it is the removal of the Cherokee that is best known  &mdash;  primarily because it went so badly. Part of the problem was the stubbornness of the principal chief, a half-breed by the name of John Ross. In the face of a two-year deadline to prepare to move, he told his people to sit tight, do nothing, and wait for a miracle. The Cherokee made no preparations, the miracle failed to occur, and the government then went about its work very badly. Militia showed up at the homes of Indians and herded them into camps. Looters followed, burning whatever they could not steal. The Indians were packed like animals into box cars for part of the trip, and then made to walk the last 800 miles into Oklahoma. It was this last leg that became known as the &#8220;trail of tears.&#8221; From the beginning, government-supplied provisions were inadequate, and of the 18,000 or so Cherokee who set out, perhaps as many as 8,000 died.</p>
<p>Prof. Remini points out that the Cherokee made their forced march in 1838, a year after Jackson left the White House, and that Jackson would never have countenanced such mistreatment. He always worried about the fate of the poorest Indians, and insisted that all government payments be prompt and in full. The Cherokee tragedy seems to have been an unfortunate combination of bad preparation, heedlessness, and government corruption.</p>
<p>Although they are the best known because of their suffering, the Cherokee were just one of several tribes that were sent West. In all, about 81,000 Indians made the trip, of whom 46,000 were deported during Jackson&rsquo;s presidency. The removal of Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, etc. was not joyous, but the Cherokee appear to have suffered the worst.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as Prof. Remini points out, &#8220;Removal was meant to prevent annihilation, not cause it.&#8221; Jackson was convinced to his dying day that removal had saved the Indians  &mdash;  and Prof. Remini concedes that he was right. The collision of Western man with stone-age savages had only four possible outcomes. One was extermination of the Indians, and Prof. Remini makes it clear no one seriously considered this. The second was integration, which neither whites nor Indians wanted. Prof. Remini says whites rejected integration out of &#8220;racism&#8221; while the Indians, presumably not &#8220;racist,&#8221; wanted to preserve their customs. The third option was to leave the Indians where they were to enjoy their traditional homelands, but the press of whites made this impossible. Prof. Remini leaves no doubt that there was no force in America powerful enough to keep white settlers from overrunning the hunting grounds. Contact with whites tended only to corrupt the Indians, turning them away from their traditions and into drunks and beggars. The only real option was removal.</p>

</div><p>And, indeed, as Prof. Remini points out, the tribes whom whites encountered before the Louisiana Purchase made removal a possibility  &mdash;  the Mohegan, Delaware, Narragansett, Yamasee, etc.  &mdash;  did not survive as nations. They were overrun or absorbed. It is the Cherokee and others, whose removal we are supposed to look upon as the blackest mark on our past, who survived into the present. Prof. Remini concludes:<blockquote>&#8220;Andrew Jackson genuinely believed that what he had accomplished rescued these people from inevitable annihilation. And although that statement sounds monstrous, and although no one in the modern world wishes to accept or believe it, that is exactly what he did.&#8221;
</blockquote></p>
<p>What would have been the result had the balance of power been different? Unlike whites, Indians had no scruples about killing women and children, and practiced torture and extermination when it suited them. The great Shawnee chief Tecumseh was no doubt expressing his sincerest desires at an 1811 war council meant to stir up as many tribes as possible: &#8220;Let the white race perish!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; Burn their dwellings, destroy their stock, slay their wives and children, that the very breed may perish.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indians were probably fortunate to have had whites as their most powerful enemy rather than the likes of Tecumseh.</p>

		<p>Well, as read from the books by Alan Eckert (&#8220;A Sorrow in Our Heart&#8221; and &#8220;The Frontiersman&#8221; series) Tecumseh would not countenance at all the torture of captured warriors (either Indian or White), nor would he approve of the slaughter of women and children.</p>
<p>It should be noted that, although Tecumseh put an end to the most grotesque torture methods of the Indians for a while, they readily returned to it.</p>
<p>For me, had I seen the results of their ghastly tortures on one of my own racial kinsmen  &mdash;  I would have killed them with joy.</p>
<p>Tecumseh himself is reported to have said, &#8220;No wonder that the Whites think we are demons from hell.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The reviewer, Thomas Jackson, is defending the indefensible. If the horrible crimes committed against the Indians had been committed against whites, Mr. Jackson would not attempt to put a positive spin on that awful chapter of American history. The fact that so many white people are ashamed and disgusted at the crimes committed by their ancestors, is proof that some whites have a sense of morality and decency.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m really not sure what to think about all this, since I have Cherokee ancestry.</p>
<p>On one side I hear &#8220;Amerinds are evil&#8221; and on the other I hear about the &#8220;noble red man.&#8221;  Depends on who I ask.  Either way, I shun their religion.</p>
<p>My mother likes to attend pow-wows and the like.  My husband once asked her, since she&rsquo;s no more than, oh, about 1/16 Amerind, why does she concentrate on that small part?  Because the rest of her ancestry is Anglo-Saxon-Celtic.</p>
<p>Her brother married a Chippewa/French Canadian woman.  She lived on a reservation near Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan.  My uncle has friends all over that reservation.</p>
<p>I guess there&rsquo;s history a lot of us aren&rsquo;t going to want to hear.</p>
<p>I do wonder, though, if I&rsquo;m expected to apologize for my ancestry.  Should I be ashamed of it?</p>

		<p>Sure thing @ 2,</p>
<p>Except most of the &#8220;horrific crimes&#8221; are fictional creations of the liberal media, or in response to massacres commited by indians.</p>

		<p>The fact that a great warrior like Andrew Jackson is now dismissed as a cruel bigot (even Ann Coulter calls him a &#8220;racist a  &mdash;  hole&#8221;) shows how far whites have declined.</p>
<p>Of course modern p.c. historians never mention the infamous Fort Mims Massacre where Indians slaughtered 250 whites (including women, children and the elderly) but spared the small number of blacks present- so they could keep them as slaves!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not going to take sides one way or another, but only want to say that John Ross, Principal Chief of the Cherokees, was not 1/2 Indian, but probably about 1/8 Indian or less (I&rsquo;ve read accounts of him being as little as 1/32 Indian).  It was Sequoya, inventor of the written Cherokee alphabet, who was 1/2 Indian.  The Cherokees, like many southeastern tribes, had many members who were more white or black than Indian.  Also, the Mohegan, Delaware, and Narragansett do exist today.  It can be argued however, that this existence is in name only, since many of these tribes were recently resurrected in the past 25-30 years, and there is very little, if any, Indian blood or culture remaining in them.  Interestingly, some entire tribes and bands today claim tribal membership and Indian heritage based on being descended from a single individual.  I believe the Yamasee are extinct, but there is a movement today to resurrect this tribe too.  </p>
<p>Anyway, the point is that if the writer wanted to emphasize how contact with whites was disastrous for Indians, there are better choices that could have been made, such as the Beothuk, Natchez, Michigamea, or the Arawak.  Although no one is perfect, when books on historical topic contain easily disputed factual errors, even minor ones, this brings into question everything else in the work.  If the author didn&rsquo;t research his topic well, why should I read it?  </p>
<p>That being said, I think there should be historical accounts for the justification for the Indian removal act and similar Indian/White conflict issues without a politically correct bias.  However, I don&rsquo;t think this is one of them.</p>

<p>Ahem, there have been many times in history when whites have not hesitated in killing women and children. The most obvious recent example - the atomic immolation of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, at a stage in the war when the Japanese were of absolutely no threat to the US mainland. </p>
<p>The Indians, perhaps, had more justification for their atrocities than the US white government had for many of theirs - such as the atomic bombings, fire bombings of German cities, and atrocities during the Philippine–American War.</p>
<p>And Mr Jackson should perhaps look into the genocide of the Namibian Hereros, as well as Belgian atrocities in the Congo. Both, obviously, crimes carried out by whites against non-white men, women, and children.</p>
<p>And intra-white brutalities were at least as bad. The Croatian Ustasha committed unspeakable brutalities against Serbs, Jews, Slovenes, Roma, and others. </p>
<p>The crimes of Ukrainian nationalists against Poles during WWII are little known: </p>
<p><i>&#8220;Villages were torched. Roman Catholic priests were axed or crucified. Churches were burned with all their parishioners. Isolated farms were attacked by gangs carrying pitchforks and kitchen knives. Throats were cut. Pregnant women were bayoneted. Children were cut in two. Men were ambushed in the field and led away. The perpetrators could not determine the province&rsquo;s future. But at least they could determine that it would be a future without Poles.&#8221;</i></p>

<p>It is perhaps reasonable to suggest that whites are no worse than non-whites. But better? Based on the historical record, I hardly think so.</p>

		<p> I am 1/32 Cherokee from my father&rsquo;s side. I am basically an Anglo-Celtic-Germanic hybrid with a dash of French and Dutch with a dash of Cherokee.  I feel bad for what happened to so many Amerinds but I do see the point that given the realities of those days, the Indians most probably WOULD have been annihilated had not they been relocated.  It just goes to show what happens when a more technologically advanced civilization comes in contact with a more &#8220;primitive&#8221; one.  I think Hawking may be correct; humanity should NOT be trying to contact extraterrestrial civilzations. Given our radio and tv transmissions it may be too late.

		<p>The kind of violence that Indians and whites committed against each other here was just as barbaric as the violence that Slavic peoples visited upon each other, the Germans, Muslims and Mongols, not that these invaders treated Slavs kindly either. They murdered them by the millions, and Slavs fought back with equal ferocity just to keep their homelands, women and culture from being taken from them. The American Indians were no different understandably were not going to just roll over and die for our ancestors expansion into their lands, but the fact is whites and Indians fought to the death, and the Indians lost. I admire their courage and determination in the face of overwhelming numbers of troops and firepower, because my Slavic ancestors were in the same predicament time and time again. If we treated them the way the Mongols treated the population of Kiev Ukraine, there would not be any Indians at all alive today, because we&rsquo;d have killed them all to the last child. By allowing them to live albeit in reservations, we showed them more mercy than they would have shown us had the tables been turned, even though they did frequently adopt whites as members of many tribes. It seems some of us were sexually or romantically attractive to them, Indians do respect courage and fearlessness even in their enemies. Among the non-whites here in the U.S., the North American Indians are the only ones I have sincere admiration for as a group, especially the advanced tribes such as the Hopi and Algonquin tribes.</p>

<p>&#8220;The reviewer, Thomas Jackson, is defending the indefensible. If the horrible crimes committed against the Indians had been committed against whites, Mr. Jackson would not attempt to put a positive spin on that awful chapter of American history. The fact that so many white people are ashamed and disgusted at the crimes committed by their ancestors, is proof that some whites have a sense of morality and decency.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nonsense.  The only reason whites feel &#8220;guilty&#8221; is because of the mush-headed &rsquo;60s when hippies wanted to be Indians because they envied the idea that they could live a free and easy life in a teepee somewhere (while someone else did the work).    Hollywood made a series of ridiculous movies beginning with the entertaining but totally fictitious &#8220;Little Big Man,&#8221; followed by endless miniseries and other interpretations that heaped on with the general anti-white tirades that have been allowed and indulged in since then.  Our schools became political playgrounds and revised history taught (and teaches) shame to whites when before they were taught to be proud of the American epic.  The good that America has done in the world due to the success of the White epic of settlement far overshadows the necessaries and relatively small causalities of adjustment in a world that was bound to be modernized.  Now the world is reverting to barbarity.  As whites fade from influence in the world, brutality is returning.</p>
<p>People have been forcibly moved before and after all over the world in far crueler manner, with far more suffering.  Haranguing White Americans with this bit of history is pathetic and mostly speaks to the lack of achievement of Amerinds since Wounded Knee.  Amerinds have received so many special privileges and government money, most lately monopolies on gambling casinos, and they still continue to whine and complain.</p>
<p>I recommend to you and all readers who haven&rsquo;t found it already, the book &#8220;A Fate Worse than Death.&#8221;  The narratives in this well researched book makes clear why Amerinds had to be pacified. They were psychotic sadists and killers who knew no limits and accepted no authority.  </p>
<p>They only now use the worn out complaints of &#8220;White man speaks with forked tongue,&#8221; claptrap.  Then there is the fantasy of &#8220;Dances with Wolves.&#8221;  Just as ridiculous as the complaints of White Man&rsquo;s Diseases, while infecting Whites with syphilis and gonorrhea, Amerinds continue to be dependent on white society, hypocritically utilizing white man&rsquo;s technology (starting with the horse and gun) while pretending entitlement (when it suits) to pretend that they are living in the megalithic age - as they were when Europeans first arrived.<br>

<p>I really protest Thomas Jackson&rsquo;s use of the phrase &#8220;white trash.&#8221;  History shows that these settlers were people who had little choice but to forge into the wilderness.  Some of them were survivors of earlier Indian raids and felt no need to respect Indians.  But to apply this tiresome and by now hackneyed appelation to any white is tantamount to race baiting.  Thomas Jackson is promoting the notion that there are some whites that may be and even ought to be sacrificed to non-whites in order to save another class of whites.  This is cheap and cowardly and no service to the white race, any of us.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m really not sure what to think about all this, since I have Cherokee ancestry.</p>
<p>On one side I hear &ldquo;Amerinds are evil&rdquo; and on the other I hear about the &ldquo;noble red man.&rdquo; Depends on who I ask. Either way, I shun their religion.</p>
<p>My mother likes to attend pow-wows and the like. My husband once asked her, since she&rsquo;s no more than, oh, about 1/16 Amerind, why does she concentrate on that small part? Because the rest of her ancestry is Anglo-Saxon-Celtic.</p>
<p>Her brother married a Chippewa/French Canadian woman. She lived on a reservation near Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. My uncle has friends all over that reservation.</p>
<p>I guess there&rsquo;s history a lot of us aren&rsquo;t going to want to hear.</p>
<p>I do wonder, though, if I&rsquo;m expected to apologize for my ancestry. Should I be ashamed of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Alexandria, many answers to your questions can be found right in your own words.  How much of your ancestry is Cherokee?  Do you know for sure?  I have heard more whites claim to have Cherokee ancestry, as if it is something to be proud of.  Whether it is or not is not my point.  The point is that whatever part of your ancestry is Cherokee is likely so small that it hardly matters, especially where genetics are concerned.  Genealogical DNA studies are beginning to show that hardly any whites who think they have Cherokee in their ancestry do.  So why does this claim persist?  Difficult to know, but guilt, an attraction to the &#8220;exotic,&#8221; etc.  Yet, many people, and even you, a regular Amren poster focuses so much on that aspect of their ancestry.  Your mother at pow-wows&hellip; illustrates a loss knowledge concerning her own ancestry and folk ways.  My long, long study and analysis of this has led me to understand that it was Christianity that robbed whites of their real culture.  So you mother runs off to find things she can&rsquo;t find at church with Amerinds.</p>
<p>As far as &#8220;The Noble Savage&#8221; thing goes, this is a kind of myth that James F. Cooper created with his 18th century romance adventures like &#8220;The Last of the Mohicans.&#8221;  It was further expanded in Europe, especially Germany where copycat authors wrote fictions that further expanded the myth, attaching European style chivalric manners to Indians, which made them charming to European readers.  Imagine the resultant German immigrants settling in territories like Nebraska only to find them to be sadistic murderers who would make a friendly visit one day only to return the next to kill everyone in the family but the women and girls, who would be made slaves and sex toys.  Babies by the way, were a nuisance, and the Indians had many expedient ways of executing them, always in the full presence of their mothers.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hate Amerinds.  I think it is a good thing when we can join together and enjoy a hard won, peace between whites and Amerinds after such a long time of adjustment.  But when I hear renewed complaints by Amerinds, citing the same old, ever increasing, highly mythologized noble suffering at the hands of ugly, greedy, whites, and then witness the delusion at work in whites, it is just too much.</p>
<p>But apologies?  No, none ever.  The past cannot be remade and as I have tried to illustrate a little, has been badly falsified anyway.  As for being ashamed, you might as well be ashamed for living.  I know you aren&rsquo;t stupid, but Amerinds and non-whites who are constantly assault whites and the history that they actually ought to be proud of, are counting on you and all of us to bow our heads and give in to every demand they can dream up.<br>

<p>The Cherokees ended up on great real estate and prospered.  Shut up already.

<p>And note that John Ross was a self-styled Christian evangelist who made the Cherokees believe that God would step in for them.  Just like John Brown and other fire-brand preachers, Christianity in the American epic often has been the cause of huge misfortunes and disasters.</p>

		<p>There is evidence that the Caucasians arrival to the Americas may predate the arrival of the &ldquo;Native Americans.&rdquo; So what happened to these people? The most likely conclusion is that the &ldquo;Native Americans&rdquo; pretty much wiped these people off the face of the earth. I am of the opinion that in the past, due to our nature, we settled in uninhabited areas all over the world. For some reason we were left vulnerable to annihilation by the people of color who came into contact with us. Humans have been killing each other for a long time. In general, we white people have been more involved with killing each other than killing the other races. If it is true that Caucasian people were once spread out across the globe, then we are the ones who over time have been displaced. But this is just what humans do to each other.   </p>

		<p>Alexandra(#4), none of us should apologize or be ashamed of our ancestry.  I believe we can celebrate the good of our heritage while acknowledging the bad.  I, like many Americans, have both English and Irish ancestors, yet I don&rsquo;t dwell on the conflicts between the two groups.  <br>
Where I grew up, in southern WV, many people were part Cherokee, though all that I knew identified as white or black (&#8220;colored&#8221; at that time).  My county was named for a Native American who had adopted the name Logan, and the area was famous for a massacre perpetrated on a local Shawnee tribe by whites.  An outdoor drama, named Aracoma after the chief&rsquo;s daughter, is held every summer.  The massacre reportedly took place because of horse stealing.  Everyone seemed to understand that neither the Europeans nor the Native Americans were all bad or all good.</p>

<p>Perhaps you&rsquo;re too quick to use the words &#8216;disgusted&rsquo; and &#8216;ashamed&rsquo;, etc?</p>
<p>In my class we were taught that Indians learned &#8216;scalping&rsquo; from whites. From the French to be exact. So white children are taught to be ashamed of the crimes committed by Indians - the only way indians can be seen as committing crimes (it was nothing to be brought up, scalping, until enough time and courage had passed, that scalping could be blamed on whites). Even when Native Americans commit real crimes, as in robbery or murder, etc, that, too, is to be blamed on whites. Also, in my &#8216;Diversity in Learners&rsquo; class, we discussed Slavery, and the dispossession of the Indians. Both subjects were very important. Not once did we discuss the fact Indians owned black slaves. That must not have been so important.</p>
<p>Since you&rsquo;re so concerned, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re rushing to get the true facts out&hellip;</p>
<p>I think what you are alluding to in whites is their modern sense of indecency. That is whites that agree with you, are simply afraid of you. But call it what you want (be sure and lead off with &#8216;horrible&rsquo;, &#8216;ashamed&rsquo;, and &#8216;disgusted&rsquo;, tho) and fire a few people for good measure. Why not even have the nation talking about the evil of &#8216;hate crimes&rsquo; - as if these crimes are being done by whites - as if that is the problem. Blame whites for the things overwhelmingly done by non-whites?</p>
<p>Why stop there? How about &#8216;organized religion is the source of all evil in the world&rsquo;?</p>
<p>How about? &#8216;Western man didn&rsquo;t Eradicate Smallpox from the globe&rsquo; - why, that idea could be bad for someones esteem, &#8216;insensitive&rsquo;&hellip;  Why not, &#8216;White men eradicated non-whites with Small Pox&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Loaning money to the third world is exploiting them. Not loaning money to the third world is exploiting them.</p>
<p>The USA, a nation that did more to end Colonialism than any other nation in Earth&rsquo;s History, is an &#8216;imperialist and colonial power&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong (in fact, be sure and make your correction public) Your official version of events is that white men are the cause of all evil in history, and it&rsquo;s continuation in the present. Do I have it correct that this is your version of &#8216;tolerance&rsquo;? Again, be sure and correct this if it&rsquo;s wrong. Show your moral decency.</p>
<p>Am I incorrect when I notice, school children all over the world are learning about the evils of &#8216;colonialism&rsquo; even as white, and only white nations, are being colonized?</p>

		<p>Interesting responses.  Whiteplight makes good points and I look forward to reading his recommendation, &#8220;A Fate Worse than Death&rdquo;.  It&rsquo;s difficult to find any information today about Indians that isn&rsquo;t full of PC, romanticized, and mushy notions about them.  I too grew up in the Southern WV area next door to olewhitelady in Mingo county and knew many people there claiming Cherokee or Shawnee heritage, including my family, but I never saw any actual evidence of this.  I&rsquo;m in Alabama now and run into blond, blue-eyed Cherokees on a regular basis. While living in the mid-west, it was white Miamis, Eel Rivers, Shawnees, and Weas.  Having lived next door to Indian reservations in Wash, Calif, Ariz, NY, Mich, and Wisc, and actually meeting some tribal members, I think most of these wannabe individuals and &#8220;tribes&#8221; claiming Indian heritage on minuscule blood quantums, affiliations, and questionable evidence are a joke.  </p>

<p>In the review above I&rsquo;m not seeing any &#8220;defending the indefensible.&#8221; I see an attempt at a balanced, thorough accounting of history.</p>
<p>What exactly do we gain by focusing only on atrocities and injustices committed by whites and forgetting those committed by indians? Shouldn&rsquo;t we want our understanding of history to be as accurate as possible, even if it doesn&rsquo;t paint an exaggerated picture that confirms a politically-correct, anti-white political agenda?</p>
<p>We can judge white european settlers of that time by the standards of today - there&rsquo;s nothing to stop anyone from doing so, of course - but again we do no service to history by forgetting that standards were different then. At the same time as whites were pushing up against the borders of indians, displacing them forever, all over the world other groups were doing the same thing. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what people did back then.</p>
<p>Is that to excuse anyone? No, but again, that&rsquo;s not the point - the point is to understand why people did what they did. <br>

As someone else said, one can&rsquo;t have expected the Amerinds to just roll over and give up. As a white person, I have no problem acknowledging this. What I do have a problem with is that whites today are the only ones who held accountable for something they didn&rsquo;t do. Non-whites everywhere on the planet in past history were every bit as bad or worse than white, did the same things and worse, yet non-whites today they are not held accountable or made to feel guilty.</p>

My great-great-grandmother had really dark hair from what I can tell in that picture, looks to be from around 1890.  I think it may have been one of her parents who was the Cherokee.  That&rsquo;s also where I have the genealogical &#8220;brick wall&#8221;  &mdash;  in her line.</p>

		<p>As I mentioned in my post #1, I get my info mainly from the excellent books by Allan Eckert.</p>
<p>It is my impression that Indian torture is a game that all the tribes played. An intense, serious game, but a game. If the warrior cried out during torture, the capturing tribe had won a spiritual victory. If he remained stoic during torture, the capturing tribe had a fear of the captive&rsquo;s tribe  &mdash;  tough dudes, don&rsquo;t even wince at torture; we had best avoid them. The captive warrior wins a victory, pouring himself out to the utmost.</p>
<p>Would that Whites would stand up for members of their own White tribe, even unto death!!!!</p>
<p>It is the Whites&rsquo; error that they attributed this game solely to the workings of Satan, rather than to biological differences. Would that they had learned from these events the reality of biological differences, especially as touching on ethics. Then we would, I think, have dealt with the blacks and hispanics in a more realistic way.</p>
<p>********************************</p>
<p>Alexandra  &mdash;  your ancestor sure looks Indian. I, also, got mocked in elementary school as &#8220;that Japanese kid&#8221; after I got a crew-cut. I took a DNA test, much later in life, which told me the answer. Many Europeans have a percentage of Asian DNA from the various Asian invasions. However, I think that the Asian invaders of Europe were basically the same people as the AmerInds. </p>

		<p>Indians weer sent west into what is now Oklahoma, and was designated as Indian Territory,and nation  .During Civil War, the black slaves the Indians brought with them were sent to fight for Confederacy.  Confederacy lost, and Union punished them by some land confiscation etc, and losing their slaves.  Many blacks went west, and were called Buffalo soldiers.  Border areas of Colorado/Nebraska seems to be a area with much history of black and Indian ex slaves.  Recently, the  Cherokee tribe voted against any claims by the Black Indians.  Eastern Cherokee did the same,as far as I know.. One thing   &mdash;   If you ever see the Black Indian ancestry in the black women today you will often see one beautiful Gal.  Indians are very astute in spotting Indian ancestry in other people.  Another thing - The lands in SE had been cleared for a long time by Indian tribes,and this process of land clearing took ages to accomplish.  When the demand for agricultural products in England etc. occurred there was another reason to relocate the Tribes.  There was a class of warrior called &#8220;Dog Soldier,&#8221; and when the whites,or other Indians came up against these was a fight to the death and no retreat - similar to the Japanese in WW-2,and the fierceness was just as bad.  After all, Indians are Asians&hellip;or most are-do not know about the pyramid,and mound builders, but Navajo etc are..Shoshone in Wyoming have stories of their immigration over ice etc. The Indian question goes on&hellip;<br>
  I will get this book.-Does not sound as author speaks with forked tongue.</p>

		<p>The &#8216;Cherokee ancestor&rsquo; myth is one of the most widespread myths in genealogy, as most genealogists will tell you. I believe there was also a New York Times story a few years ago about DNA testing being done of individuals claiming Indian (usually &#8216;Cherokee&rsquo;) ancestry, and these individuals in most cases were found to have no Indian ancestry. Apparently this disappointed some of them, as they had been quite invested in the idea of their &#8216;Indian blood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As to Alexandra&rsquo;s great-great grandmother&rsquo;s picture, to me, she looks quite White in appearance. She definitely appears blue-eyed or gray-eyed, and if she were as much as half-Indian or other nonwhite, she could not have blue or gray eyes, because that is a recessive trait which requires blue-eyed genes from both sides to be present.</p>
<p>Many people who claim &#8216;Indian blood&rsquo; uses &#8221;high cheekbones&#8221; as the reason for their belief in their Indian ancestry, but many European people also have prominent cheekbones; it is not proof of &#8216;Indian&rsquo; ancestry. No offense to Alexandra of course but I see a European look in her great-great grandma&rsquo;s picture.</p>

		<p>Part of the reason Andrew Jackson hated North American aborigines, stems from the fact he hated the British with a virulence. He also knew that several aborigine tribes allied themselves with the British, during our Revolutionary War. That made those aborigines our enemies. <br>
Of course, during the War of 1812, some aborigine tribes again allied themselves with our enemies, the British. So, in my view Jackson was justified in doing what he did.</p>

		<p>I  guess  2  important  questions  that  should  be  raised from the  responses above  is this: does history  have  a  moral  dimension?  If not  so  in  all  cases, the  question  then  is: should  history  have  a  moral dimension. </p>
<p>The  reason for  the  questions  is  this:  if  individual  human  behavior within society  does  have  a  moral  dimension  &mdash;  issues of  murder, rape, theft, lying[in courts  of law perjury  is  seen as a  serious  matter],  then  should  this  principle  be  applied  to  groups  as  a  whole?</p>
<p>History  seems  to  have  a  clear  moral  dimension  in only  one  clear  case  so  far:  German  expansionism  and  ethnic  conflicts  &mdash;  against  Jews, Gypsies, etc.  &mdash;  during  the Nazi era  is  seen  purely  in  moral  terms.  This  is  not  the  case  with  other  forms  of  European expansionism  in  the   world.</p>
<p>Some  posters  argue  that  it  is  only  those  of  European  extraction  who  are  ever  urged  to  consider  the  moral  aspects  of  European  expansionism  in  the world.  That  seems  fair,  given  that  while those  of  European  phenotype constitute  at most  20%  of the  world&rsquo;s  population, this  group  now  occupies  some 65% of the  world&rsquo;s  land area  &mdash;  mainly  on  the basis  of  warfare  waged  against  other  groups  far  away  from  the  European  homeland. </p>

		<p>I find it laughable that John Liu is defending the Japanese, since the Japanese warred with China since the early 1930&rsquo;s, before the war in Europe began.<br>
John Liu have you forgotten the Rape of Nanking, where the Japanese slaughtered, raped, pillaged, massacred and looted on a scale that shocked even the Nazis? Then there&rsquo;s the Bataan Death march, and the deliberate infecting of American, British and Australian POW&rsquo;s by Japanese doctors in southeast Asia, under the guise of &#8220;medical research&#8221;.<br>
John Liu doesn&rsquo;t mention this, but the day after &#8220;Fat Man&#8221; and &#8220;Little Boy&#8221; dropped in on Emperor Hirohito&rsquo;s tea party, the USSR was all set to invade the Japanese mainland.<br>
So here&rsquo;s the paradox: The bombs dropped on Japan, actually PREVENTED perhaps millions more Japanese deaths at the tender mercies of Joseph Stalin.</p>

		<p>&#8220;modern p.c. historians never mention the infamous Fort Mims Massacre where Indians slaughtered 250 whites (including women, children and the elderly) but spared the small number of blacks present - so they could keep them as slaves!&#8221;<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>The Fort Mims massacre is a fascinating and horrible story about the birth pains of this country.  I read it several years ago.<br>
And there were numerous other such stories.  It wasn&rsquo;t unique. <br>
 <br>
As I recall, though, the black slaves  who were taken were all killed soon thereafter. They did not live for long, since the Indians used them as human shields in their next battles.<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p> <i>&#8220;The Creeks apparently spared most of the slaves to serve them, but this reprieve was to be short lived. During the Battle of Horseshoe Bend&hellip; the Indians used these slaves as a human shield&hellip; While the slaves had been spared during the massacre, the Indians showed no mercy to the whites&hellip; the Creeks slaughtered the settlers, including brutalizing the women, some of whom were pregnant, and children. Some of the wounded  were thrown into fires. Many of the victims at Fort Mims were scalped before they were killed.<br>
  <br>
Exact casualty figures will never be known, but most authorities agree about 250 to 400 settlers and militiamen died at Fort Mims. A settler who returned to the grisly scene four days after the battle to search for his family reportedly saw about &ldquo;250 dead bodies and the women in a situation too shocking to behold or relate&rdquo;. Many accounts state the death toll exceeded 500, but this apparently does not take into account the approximately 100 to 175 slaves who were captured by the Creeks; however, among the bodies were the remains of about 20 slaves. Additionally, a few white women and children may also have been taken captive.&#8221;</i></p>

<p>Actually, I don&rsquo;t think Stalin was going to invade the Japanese homeland, the Russians declared war on Japan on Aug 9th and did so just so they could get, what they knew Washington would give, their share of everything&hellip;one of the things I believe was a Northernmost Japanese Island, the name of which I have forgotten. Until the bomb was dropped, the Russians, according to what I read, steadfastly refused to become involved in the war with Japan and in fact, treated our own airmen forced down on Soviet territory as POWs!!</p>

<p>Nope, what was cowardly and immoral was that Japan sneakily attacked and bombed Pearl Harbor. As to the atomic bomb,  it was either or us or them. Kill thousands of Japanese civilians or have thousands of our soldiers killed. Of course we should care about our soldiers and put their lives before enemy civilians. It would have been barbaric otherwise. The Japanese killed women and children in places where they occupied. Just look at the Phillipines. They attempted to create a bomb to kill American civilians in the USA. One went off and killed an American woman. If the Japanese could have gotten the nuclear bomb, they would have wiped American women and children of the map. As far as 65 years ago, why don&rsquo;t you look at China&rsquo;s human rights record TODAY???? Pretty dismal don&rsquo;t you think?<br>

<p>Actually, there was a difference, a big one. Ghenghis Khan simply invaded and attacked other peoples who were living their lives and minding their own business for power and financial gain. The Americans were attacked by Japan first and were in a fight to the death. If Japan had won, we would have lost our country to them and been taken over by them, so a nuclear bomb was necessary to win and prevent deaths of our soldiers and keep our country. Non-Whites including you Chinese have committed many atrocities in the past 65 years if you want to point fingers, point at yourself. Really, non-Whites always try some guilt trip with Whites when you were just as bad and today much worse. </p>

		<p>Interesting theories about the Atomic Bombings.  We were and are accountable for our actions based on being signatories to Hague and Geneva conventions which forbid attacks on principally civilian targets and attacks on targets with civilian collateralship without fair warning.<br>
What I have read (Internet, sorry, I don&rsquo;t have the LINKS) places the initial invasion calculus at around 25,000 KIA, same as Normandy.<br>
But probably the greater question to be asked is why, when you are facing an island culture whose sea trade you have all but completely cut off, there was no push to extend the blockading efforts and perhaps poison or floodout the rice harvest and transport so that starvation rather than outright incineration (which began the previous spring with firebombings of all the major cities and actually killed more Japanese) might be weaponized as a measure that could be enforced by inches rather than by miles.<br>
IMO, there is a legitimate objection to the use of WMD for it&rsquo;s own sake, one that continues to this day as a justification for it&rsquo;s use on our own vulnerable pop centers: that they who do not exercise all due restraint need expect none themselves.<br>
We had invested a huge amount of money in the atomic programs (3 bilion then, 20 billion today) and there were several &#8216;exposed&rsquo; personalities who most likely would have been investigated if not excoriated for allowing such expenditures without noteable result.<br>
But even here, the use of the Kwajalein atoll as a test demonstration site would have likely convinced the world that we were -better men- because we had the gift.  And chose not to use it.  Not that we wouldn&rsquo;t if pressed.</p>

<p>WW2 was a &#8220;Total War.&#8221;  Entire populations supported the effort, and it was nation against nation.  Many war philosophers had remarked even before the war on the definitions of total war, since it had begun in WW1.  Also, Japn was working on its own A-Bomb.  In a discussion with former Japanese military in the 1980s, they remarked that there is no doubt they would have used it if they had been able to in time.  They had sent baloon bombs to the West Coast and a couple went off in Oregon, killing - civilians.</p>
<p>Just imagine if the U.S. had not had The Bomb and exhausted itself trying to invade Japan.  The Japanese in China would likely have established a permanent presence by the time things settled in Japan and Japan would have been able to rule a good part of China permanently, probably by treaty.  Do I need to list the numbers of women and children the Japanese slaughtered wholesale in China, and Imperial Japan&rsquo;s tendancy to utilize slavery?</p>
