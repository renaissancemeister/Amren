<h1>US Census: Haiti Population Booming After Quake</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Google News, June 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Haiti&rsquo;s population will continue to grow quickly despite the tremendous loss of life in the January earthquake, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates released Monday.</p>
<p>The bureau estimates Haiti&rsquo;s current population at 9.6 million, based on an estimated quake death toll of 230,000.</p>
<p>It projects the impoverished country will recover and surpass its pre-quake population level by 2012. By 2050, the bureau says, Haiti will have 13.4 million people.</p>
<p>The Dominican Republic, with a nearly identical population, is expected to keep up the same pace. By contrast the populations of now-similarly sized European countries like Sweden and Belarus are expected to decline over the same period.</p>

<p>I assume the reason for adding this is that Sweden and Belarus should take in Haiti&rsquo;s excess population?</p>

		<p>I predict Haiti will grow faster than estimated, at least in the first few years.  Whites are running over there and depositing food aid because of &#8220;humanitarian&#8221; concerns.  Haitians, in general, are probably better fed with better nutrition than they have been in awhile because of it, and good sustenance and nutrition usually means fast procreation.</p>

		<p>Portrait of black irresponsibility and indifference.  These people live in the poorest country in this hemisphere and can&rsquo;t sustain themselves yet are having babies left and right.  Early European explorers noted how Africans would go through periods of stravation and death even though food was abundant around them.  Black Africans are as irresponsible and indifferent as ever.</p>

		<p>The Chinese in the future will have to do the unthinkable because the whites will not touch the issue  &mdash;  population control in the third world.  Eventually, the Chinese will too be charged with racism, etc., etc.  But hey, this planet can only support so many people.</p>

		<p>Of course, Thomas Malthus prefigured all of this way back in the 18th century with his &#8216;Essay on the Principles of Population&rsquo;.<br>
  Basically Malthus&rsquo;s thesis was that population growth, if left unchecked, will reach the point where mass starvation and other attendent miseries such as war and violence provides a &#8216;natural chech&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Anyone see that the population time bomb is a weapon of mass destruction?  Compare earthquakes in areas of stable population, such as Los Angles, to the earthquake in Haiti were 250,000 people died.  The same applies to floods, tital waves, wars, droughts, fires and hurricanes.<br>

		<p>A sane U.S. Haiti policy: no food and no medical aid. Keep the Coast Guard circling this island of Hell to ensure none of these AIDS ridden morons sneak into  the US to infect us and drain us of our tax dollars. Maybe if the population of Haiti shrunk by natural selection to a million, it would be a rational state that could be self-sufficient. But nearly ten million AIDS and disease ridden retards? No way.  </p>

<p>Chinese people are already doing it. In their companies in Africa they only insure one child per worker. I see a report about China &#8220;invading&#8221; Africa. The black guy was very angry about Chinese people &#8220;not respecting their culture, because it is normal habit in Africa to have 8 kids&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Haiti is a sad case.  With roughly the same land area as Maryland (28K vs. 25K square kilometers) she has about twice the population at 9.5 vs. 5.2 million.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with the state is the way it is manhandled, roughly once per decade, by &#8216;restabilization efforts&rsquo; which in fact amount to CIA sponsored coups.  You might almost call the island the last training ground for CIA change of government operations.</p>
<p>This has done everything from drown the nation&rsquo;s internal agro self sufficiency with massive exports of U.S. rice, corn and sugar.  To sustainment of a dual government the shadow element of which is dedicated to sustaining the 5 billion dollar a year drug transfer system from the lower Caribbean and the massive money laundering that goes with it (the Feds and the banks own the drug business people).</p>
<p>It is true that the people are primitive and barbarous, largely because they cannot break free of the process of death squad reprisals and community suppresion which has lead to a stream of &#8216;grassroots&rsquo; rebellions alternating between more corrupt local rule and IMF/WB &#8216;prime minister&rsquo; as alternating dictatorships.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a pretty picture and the USG is hardly innocent in it&rsquo;s origins or continued propagation.</p>
<p>That said, if you want to bring stability to the island the best way -is- with food.  Along with massive gated community style island housing projects that principally seek to separate the male and female populations and age groups so that the few good people cannot be preyed upon.  Women will take birth control if they are not dependent on male gratuity for support.</p>
<p>If you stop all aid, you will only succeed in bringing outside interests to the table because the drug trade is simply -that big- that the larger banking conglomerates cannot ignore it&rsquo;s easy money laundering potential.</p>
<p>Though it&rsquo;s fairly long-</p>

		<p>  &#8220;Saint-Domingue became known as the &#8220;Jewel of the Antilles&#8221;  &mdash;  one of the richest colonies in the 18th-century French empire. By the 1780s, Saint-Domingue produced about 40 percent of all the sugar and 60 percent of all the coffee consumed in Europe.&#8221; Wikipedia. Such was the French colony of Saint-Dominque/modern Haiti before the hated whites were expelled or exterminated. Today, Haiti&rsquo;s main export seems to be refugees. Oh poor Haiti, so far from God and so close to Florida!<br>

		<p>Is anybody surprised?  The one thing Haitians can certainly do is breed.  Black African countries have been wracked by wars, disease, and famine, yet their populations grown every year as well.  Don&rsquo;t underestimate the power of an r-reproductive strategy.</p>
