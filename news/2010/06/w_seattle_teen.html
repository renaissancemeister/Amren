<h1>W. Seattle Teen Beaten Bloody in Possible Hate Crime</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Shomari Stone and Joel Moreno, Seattle Times, May 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 16-year-old boy from West Seattle says he was held hostage and beaten for hours, all because of the color of his skin.</p>
<p>Shane McClellan says two men kicked and whipped him at gunpoint  &mdash;  and told him they singled him out because he is white.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The incident happened as Shane McClellan was walking home from a birthday party at a friend&rsquo;s house Tuesday around 2 a.m.</p>
<p>Shane says two men called to him from the top of a staircase near the intersection of 14th Avenue SW and SW Holden Street. The men asked for a light, and when Shane walked over to oblige, they knocked him to the ground and started kicking him.</p>
<p>The two men knocked the frightened teen around on the staircase, making racially charged remarks.</p>
<p>&#8220;They started bringing up the past  &mdash;  like slavery  &mdash;  being like, white people did this,&#8221; Shane said in an exclusive interview with KOMO News reporter Shomari Stone.</p>
<p>The attackers stripped off McClellan&rsquo;s belt and started whipping his back.</p>
<p>&#8220;They said, &#8216;This is for what your people did to our people.&rsquo; They were like whipping me with my belt, my studded belt,&#8221; Shane recounts.</p>
<p>One of the men held a gun against the back of his head and burned his neck with cigarettes.</p>
<p>At one point they shoved McClellan&rsquo;s face into a hole with the gun against his head. They also urinated on him and poured beer over him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What he told me, when they were beating him with the belt, they were saying, &#8216;I don&rsquo;t like white people,&rsquo;&#8221; says Shane&rsquo;s father, Tim McClellan.</p>
<p>Shane recalls, &#8220;They&rsquo;re like, &#8216;Aw, white boy, what are you doing? You can&rsquo;t hang out this late. What are you doing around here?&rsquo; They&rsquo;re like, &#8216;White boy has no belonging  &mdash;  being out here at 2 a.m.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They targeted me for being white, and they made it very clear that&rsquo;s why they were assaulting me,&#8221; Shane says.</p>
<p>The boy told police that one of his attackers appeared to be black and the other Asian or Pacific Islander.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The two assailants held the victim on the ground for some time, and Shane eventually passed out.</p>
<p>When he regained consciousness, the attackers were gone. They had taken his money, a coat and an MP3 player.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Seattle police have referred the case to their Bias Crimes Unit for review as a possible hate crime.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Asked for a light&#8221;  When oh when will people learn that asking for a light or a cigarette  is really a friendly introduction to a robbery. It slows the victim down and brings him to a halt within reach, tests his compliance to a request or demand and gives the perpetrator an excuse to close with the victim  to iniate the assault. <br>
 I learned this by watching JD movies in black and white. This trick is sooo old I remember seeing  actor Vic Morrow as a teenager pulling it in a GE Playhouse special&hellip;</p>

<p>These stories come and go every week.   When will we see one bad enough that we can stop the Affirmative Diversity Action Race Privilege for non whites?</p>
<p>When can we see this black on White hate crime wave finally catch up with White liberals who care more about blacks than they do for the survival of their race?  </p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t care about White Survival, then why should we care whether or not a black on White hate crime puts an end to their survival?</p>

		<p>&ldquo;They said, &lsquo;This is for what your people did to our people.&rsquo; They were like whipping me with my belt, my studded belt,&rdquo; Shane recounts.</p>
<p>Indeed?</p>
<p>This is the sort of article, that I normally no longer post on. The reason being, most know my views on the topic, how I would (at least theoretically) remedy them, and so on; however, not this time!</p>
<p>16-year-old Shane, was abducted and nearly murdered for one reason only, he is white. His attackers, described as &ldquo;men&rdquo; and not &ldquo;youths&rdquo; are probably in their 20s or 30s, when they engaged in this orgy of torture and hate. Yet, through all of these facts, the &ldquo;dynamic duo&rdquo; of diversity, Comrades Shomari Stone and Joel Moreno of the Seattle Times, have the unmitigated and hateful gall to state that this is a &ldquo;possible hate crime?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Look at the boys face, Comrades: and then next tell us, all about your childish &ldquo;impressions&rdquo; and &ldquo;utopian&rdquo; fantasies.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!!</p>

<p>So true!  Asians are no better when it comes to anti-White attitudes. </p>
<p>I went to a Chinese restaurant to get pan fried noodles to take out with shrimp. Pay before you get your food. The people who run it were terrible! the stupid Chinese woman who took the order was rapidly sing-songing in a mean voice two feet away from me with two other stupid Chinese women. This went on for 10 minutes before I interrupted and asked her about my order. She hastily went into the kitchen and came back with it. A real patron friendly atmosphere. NOT!</p>
<p> I went to the car and looked at it and went back in and threw it in the trash and gave them a scathing look and walked out.</p>
<p> The shrimp was sooo greasy and looked to be 2 or 3 days old. The &#8220;pan fried noodles were covered in Chow mein which I specifically asked not to be put in the order, just PLAIN pan fried noodles is what I ordered. While sitting there I noticed the place looked dirty and unkept and the windows were smudged and dirty looking so I knew right then I would not dare EAT what I ordered! The kitchen through the dirty windows also looked dirty!   </p>
<p>I am going to call the city and have inspectors go out and check this place out, but I doubt they do. It has been there for 25 years and so they sure are not doing their job! </p>

		<p>What is his name the Attorney General said that the hate crime laws do not apply when a white is the victim. What is his name said so and therefore it must be so. If what is his name said so we must listen and obey. What is his name is such an expert. So what is his name must be right. This was not a hate crime - - just ask what is his name.</p>

		<p>Many years ago when I lived in NYC I was called to jury duty. The courthouse is right next to Chinatown. I had been to Chinatown many times in the evening as a tourist going out to dinner with friends. </p>
<p>This time, however, I was on my own looking for a place to eat lunch. I finally settled on one place and when I went in there weren&rsquo;t a lot of diners, but I was the only White person in the place. If looks could kill, I would have been dead. I couldn&rsquo;t get out of there fast enough. It ruined my lunch (which I had been looking forward to) and I will never forget the hostility I felt from the Chinese in that place.  <br>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be so quick to paint Asians with such a broad brush, bad service and violent crimes are like comparing apples and oranges. As it is, bad service is much more tolerable than violent crime, and I can guarantee you that you will never see widescale violent crimes being committed by Asians. As for the Asian guy involved in this beating&hellip;as I&rsquo;ve said before here at Amren, Asians are rather toolish. Especially Asian Americans, it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me at all if this Asian fellow was under the illusion (delusion) that he is black, or that he could legitimately pull off the gangster lifestyle. Lets not fool ourselves, Asians will never be able to be gangsters in the order of blacks or Hispanics, we simply lack the aggressiveness to do so. Any other Asian who thinks otherwise knows deep down that what I&rsquo;m saying is 100% true. </p>

The story said &#8220;Asian <b>or Pacific Islander&#8221;.</b>   Samoans (and Hawaiians) can be very tough, mean, and unlike Chinese/Japanese. That would be my guess. At at rate it was 2AM, dark, and they were all drunk, so detailed observations  would be hazy at best.  </p>

I agree with most of what you say however, I would wager that the &#8220;Asian&#8221; who participated in the beating was either a Pacific Islander e.g Samoan or if Asian, a Hmong, Laotian or Cambodian,  many of whose attitudes are not that much different from that of Blacks. In my teaching experience I&rsquo;ve rarely seen Chinese or Vietnamese hanging out with Blacks. </p>
<p>As for Chinese restaurants you&rsquo;re correct. There are too many that don&rsquo;t meet cleanliness standards. We love Chinese food but mostly cook our own. Some of my Chinese students have told me that there are restaurants in which they would never set foot.</p>
<p>Off the subject but have you ever gone into an Italian restaurant kitchen? It&rsquo;s really hard to find an &#8220;Italian&#8221;.<br>
My wife and I were in a local restaurant and I ordered Linguine with garlic and oil- Agl&rsquo;oglio. It came out as boiled linguine with olive oil and sprinkled with garlic powder. When I questioned the waitress about it she brought out the &#8220;cook&#8221; who didn&rsquo;t speak a word of English so I had to explain to him in Spanish how to prepare the dish. I suppose that there&rsquo;s a shortage of illegal Italians here.<br>

		<p>As far as Asians such as Chinese and Japanese go, they should lobby to bring back the old designation of &#8220;Oriental&#8221;.  At least that way, they wouldn&rsquo;t be dumped in with Pakistanis, Melanesians, and other groups of lower IQ and higher crime.  <br>
As for whites who fool with low-class blacks, does a single good thing every come of this?  Would these same whites truck with base, ill-bred people of their own ethnicity?  Somehow, the liberals have convinced young folks that all non-whites are cool, really okay people.  The result is usually heartbreat, illegitimacy, bodily injury, and death.</p>

<p>This will be the exception that proves the rule that all hate is white. In fact, just as an experiment, argue that whites are victims of &#8216;hate crimes&rsquo;, or that &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo; is wrongful discrimination against whites, and you&rsquo;ll likely be considered some kind racist or white supremacist. I wonder if the violence of these incidents and the real threat of them, and just as importantly the media&rsquo;s response to them, is the very reason whites are so silent.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;W. Seattle Teen Beaten Bloody in Possible Hate Crime&#8221;</p>
<p>No, if the races were reversed it wouldn&rsquo;t be called a &#8216;possible hate crime&rsquo;. The mayor would be calling in civil rights leaders and having a press conference. Calling it a &#8216;possible hate crime&rsquo; could be considered a thought crime of it&rsquo;s own and possibly lead to riots. Conversely, if this daily incident was condemned as a hate crime, that could have led to riots too. And even more of these possible hate crimes and racial &#8216;tensions&rsquo;.<br>

		<p><i>&#8220;As far as Asians such as Chinese and Japanese go, they should lobby to bring back the old designation of &ldquo;Oriental&rdquo;. At least that way, they wouldn&rsquo;t be dumped in with Pakistanis, Melanesians, and other groups of lower IQ and higher crime.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been saying on this forum for a long time.  &#8220;Asian&#8221; is nothing but PCspeak, and has very little actual meaning, which is probably why marxists so desperately want to standardize it.  Asia is a <i>continent</i>, not a <i>race</i>.  An Oriental is an Oriental; a Polynesian is a Polynesian; a Pakistani is a Pakistani, and so on down the line.  </p>
<p>We, of all people, should be using racially-accurate descriptors, not falling into meaningless linguistic PC traps like &#8220;Asian.&#8221;<br>

		<p>I personally have never had a problem with Orientals, and all my Chinese restaurant experiences have been positive.  There&rsquo;s a local Chinese take-out within walking distance of my home, and you can tell it&rsquo;s kept decent.  </p>
<p>Not saying there aren&rsquo;t bad Asians, like the Vietnamese gangs out west (read about that in Lois Duncan&rsquo;s book &#8220;Who Killed My Daughter&#8221;?).  But I believe that Asians in general are well-mannered and polite (especially Orientals), and most blacks are thugs.  That&rsquo;s going by my personal experience.</p>

		<p>To Bud (#14)  Didn&rsquo;t you see the photo?  Maybe the kid beat himself up??</p>
<p>Actually Bud may be right in a way.  Maybe this was not a hate crime.  After all, the guys doing the beating were not white.  Maybe it was just their way of having a little harmless fun.  After all, this kid was responsible for slavery.</p>
<p>Bud, don&rsquo;t worry about figuring this out.</p>

<p>West Seattle proper is a well-to-do white neighborhood, always has been.  My grandparents moved there in the 50s and raised 4 kids.  My dad says there wasn&rsquo;t a house on their block that wasn&rsquo;t the same way, white upper-middle-class families.</p>
<p>He still lives there, the families are largely gone because it&rsquo;s faux pas for the moneyed white liberals who live there to procreate and raise more children with &#8220;white privilege,&#8221; but it&rsquo;s still a solidly white neighborhood.</p>
<p>Problem is, a number of the surrounding unsavory neighborhoods without views, quick access to Puget Sound, and therefore far lower property values, get lumped in as part of &#8220;West Seattle,&#8221; like Delridge, Highland Park (where the attack took place), and White Center (which needs to be renamed Brown Center).  All we&rsquo;re seeing is the latest in a long line of the naive being shown the light.</p>
<p>Seattle is the first city in the country to set up a K-12 international school curriculum, where students are taught to be &#8220;citizens of the world&#8221; and are taught a curriculum that&rsquo;s not &#8220;America-centric.&#8221;  </p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all propped up by the taxes of the white liberal miscegenators who come here from all over the country to work for Boeing and Microsoft, who thank those who built these institutions for them by tearing them down and handing them over to the undeserving out of white guilt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s truly cultural suicide. </p>

		<p>#19 &#8220;I bet the Asian guy that was with was a Samoan or maybe a Laotian. I have a hard time picturing a Chinese guy hanging out with a Black thug.&#8221;</p>
<p>Probably right. The Vietnamese and Chinese are pretty insular when it comes to outsiders. Koreans hate blacks (see L.A. Riots) as do most Japanese.<br>

		<p>West Seattle is predominately caucasian, but there is a lot of diversity in the neighborhood (many Asians, many blacks, some Hispanics).  Minorities are probably the majority in the under age 25 demographic, but there&rsquo;s a fair sized young white population in that area.  A young caucasian male isn&rsquo;t especially out of place in West Seattle.  Unlike a lot of the other major urban areas, Seattle is still overwhelmingly white (close to 70%) and the largest minority are East Asians.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;ve been through the area, I didn&rsquo;t see too much palpable tension.  A lot of the lower income white kids seem to like to hang out with the local blacks and imitate their dressing style, but maybe upscale white hipster youth have less in common and arouse more anger.  I would guess that if you are a young white and hipsterish (as many Seattle area whites tend to be), you mark yourself out as weak and effeminate (possibly gay too).  If you dress like Eminem, I think you&rsquo;d get be more likely to make it in that type of neighborhood.  </p>
<p>The &#8220;Asian or Pacific Islander&#8221; assailant is very likely a Pacific Islander of Samoan or maybe Tongan background.  Lots of Samoans in the White Center neighborhood, near West Seattle and they get arrested at a high rate.  Also, unlike East Asians, Pacific Islanders are physically huge and intimidating to the point where a lot of people are frightened to mess with them.  Pacific Islanders and blacks seem to have a lot in common and hang out together, with the blacks respecting the size and strength of their Samoan buddies.  Pacific Islander also resent Americans for taking over their islands.  I really doubt the assailant was Chinese or even southeast Asian, as those groups don&rsquo;t really mix closely with blacks or commit much random street assault.  Even an Asian gangster probably would rather spend a night out with his own ethnic group, from my experience.  </p>

		<p>On the plus side, after this boy got attacked by those non-white thugs, he and his family may be awakened to the ugly reality of multiculturalism.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know why they said &#8220;possible hate crime&#8221;. We know they&rsquo;re not going to look in on this and a lot of whites are not naive enough to think the attackers will be prosecuted.</p>

<p>Alexandra have you ever checked out the kitchens? Read my comment above. Post # 14. I know they do add alot of MSG (makes food taste better)and even when one orders food without MSG, I am positive they do not get it. I am also positive that they do not make big batches of food without MSG and food with it. They also serve leftovers from the day before or 3 or 4 days before. They cannot tell me that shrimp they gave me was cooked that morning! </p>

<p>To my palette, MSG has a rather strong and distinct taste, while to most people, it makes the food tastier but has no real taste of its own.  I have found that some Asian restaurants that say they don&rsquo;t use MSG not only use it, but heavily.</p>
