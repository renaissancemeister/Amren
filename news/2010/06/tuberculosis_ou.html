<h1>Tuberculosis Outbreaks at Palm Beach County Schools Spur Anti-Immigrant Tirades</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stacey Singer, Palm Beach Post, June 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Anti-immigrant tirades on the Internet have health officials cringing as they work to contain tuberculosis outbreaks at two Palm Beach County schools.</p>
<p>Fair or not, in a year when the public schools absorbed more than 650 Haitian earthquake victims, much of the vitriol about the disease has been directed toward those unfortunate students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Parents and children at both Seminole Ridge High School in Loxahatchee and Orchard View Elementary in Delray Beach want to know who the ill students are, to assess their children&rsquo;s risk of becoming ill, too. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Word&rsquo;s gone around that it&rsquo;s some girl who&rsquo;s not from here,&#8221; said Joey Tooley, 16, repeating the name of a Haitian teenager he doesn&rsquo;t know well. {snip}</p>
<p>Angel Portieles has spent days trying to recall whether anyone in his classes coughed a great deal and missed the last week.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think she might have been in my Spanish class,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The anonymous Web comments have been more heated, ranging from worried to hate-filled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haitian refugees and illegals are carrying all kinds of diseases that we haven&rsquo;t had here in decades,&#8221; one said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is what you get when you open the borders to indigents,&#8221; said another.</p>
<p>&#8220;How many Haitians did we let into our country?&#8221; asked a third. &#8220;I&rsquo;m sure none were screened at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not true, said the health department&rsquo;s O&rsquo;Connor.</p>
<p>First, there is no connection between the TB investigation and his agency&rsquo;s response to the influx of earthquake refugees in January, he said.</p>
<p>Second, the Haitian quake refugees who entered the public schools had to meet the same vaccination requirements as all other students, under orders from Palm Beach County Health Department Director Dr. Alina Alonso, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was Dr. Alonso [Palm Beach County Health Department Director Dr. Alina Alonso] who said, &#8216;We want them tested, we want them seen, and we want them to have their shots before they start school,&rsquo;&#8221; O&rsquo;Connor said. &#8220;All the refugees, before they entered school, were completely evaluated. All their shots were brought up to date.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The health department is keenly aware that unusual tropical diseases and other germs can migrate to Florida with travelers, whether it&rsquo;s malaria, Dengue fever or tuberculosis, he said.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Natives think Haiitians brought it. &#8220;</p>
<p>When the stores in South Florida run out of food as soon as the collapse is well underway next year, the word is up in my area we&rsquo;re going to have to be on the watch for them&hellip;.and others&hellip;because they&rsquo;ll be heading north looking for food.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to be surprised that the people they encounter are going to be quite different than the whites they&rsquo;re familiar with in the Miami urban area.</p>

No, what is &#8220;hateful&#8221; is opening your borders to deadly diseases that can afflict the population. This is hateful to Americans. Tirades?

<p>What in the heck does THAT mean? Did they TEST them or just vaccinate them? Sounds like they vaccinated them which would be of NO help if they were already infected.</p>

<p>Shots and various vaccinations have no effect whatsoever on active TB, it takes long term use of some serious antibiotics to get the virus killed.</p>

<p>Of course, not. The TB just happened to show up a few months after the Haitians flooded the schools. Any connection is a mere coincidence. Why you have it on their word that &#8220;school officials&#8221; rigorously screened the sainted Haitians before letting them into school. What more proof do you need?</p>
<p>By the way, I&rsquo;m sure most of those complaining about the Haitians are blacks or Hispanic. Whitey only knows how to shut up and smile nowadays.</p>

		<p>Haiti has the highest per capita tuberculosis burden in the Latin America and Caribbean region. The World Health Organization (WHO)External Web Site Icon estimated 306 TB cases per 100,000 persons in Haiti in 2007, as compared with 4.4 per 100,000 in the United States the same year. Multidrug-resistant TB and TB/HIV co-infection are also public health concerns in Haiti.<br>
There is an ongoing concern that Haitians carry TB, which may defy initial detection as it is asymptomatic.  Similarly, and more troubling, are Haitian relief workers that may bring back drug resistant TB.  Many Haitian relief personnel are health workers in the US, risking the spread of drug resistant TB in medical facilities.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d like to point out that TB is primarily spread as a sexually transmitted disease by people with AIDS.  It&rsquo;s not necessary to have AIDS in order to get or transmit the TB, but people with AIDS vastly increases TB&rsquo;s ability to inhabit this biological niche.  It passes along the same vectors&hellip;.needle using drug addicts, prostitutes and those who engage in homosexual sex (most of whom will not admit to being gay).</p>
<p>The reason I bring it up is the haitians are not just bringing the disease with them.  Yes&hellip;.a handful of people catch the disease just being exposed to them.  But the majority of the TB is spread by the above being brought into a community.  These behaviors are literally why TB is making a comeback, after being all but eradicated.</p>

<p>Skip, what you are not being told is that there is  a strain of TB,  EXD TB, common in Africa and I&rsquo;m sure more contagious will also raise it&rsquo;s head in USA.  This strain does not respond to any known drugs.  Google TB in South Africa and prpare to be scared.</p>

<p>Yes, notice also the message at the bottom of the original article: &#8220;User comments are not being accepted on this article.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>The anonymous Web comments have been more heated, ranging from worried to hate-filled.</i></p>
<p>Of course blacks in general and Haitians specifically never say anything that&rsquo;s &#8220;hateful.&#8221; </p>
<p>All I can say is &#8220;Thank God for the Internet.&#8221; It may be our only salvation.</p>

		<p>As far as I know, there is no vaccine for TB  &mdash;  only a test to confirm it and, of course, antibiotics to combat the infection.  New strains, however, are becoming harder to treat.  <br>
Many Haitians are sick with multiple diseases.  Children are so often infected with parasites that charity groups de-worm them wholesale.  Without white intervention, Haiti would be headed toward the fate of the island in Killer Shrews!</p>

		<p>Most Los Angeles bus drivers now wear latex gloves and crank up the air conditioning on high because they fear getting TB from their third world passengers.  The freezing air conditioning keeps TB bacteria from growing, hopefully kills the bacteria and the gloves prevent skin to skin contact.</p>

Comment no 4 from Skip &#8220;Google TB in South Africa and prpare to be scared&#8221;</p>
<p>I already am. The VA hospital in Charlston, S.C. have told me that they are seeing all sorts of previously rid of diseases coming back into the U.S. from the Muddled East and Africa, the TB strains are the least of them. We also must remember that the government, OUR GOVERNMENT now allows black Africans swith full blown AIDS into the U.S. &#8220;for humanitarian reasons&#8221;</p>
