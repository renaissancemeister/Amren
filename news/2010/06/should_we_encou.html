<h1><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/06/should-we-encourage-all-black-schools/58924/">Should We Encourage All-Black Schools?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Megan McArdle, Atlantic, June 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Stuart Buck thinks so, an idea that John McWhorter endorses. According to them, the phenomenon of socially punishing students who &#8220;act white&#8221;  &mdash;  i.e. focus on grades  &mdash;  is something that happens mostly in mixed-race schools, where black students are trying to maintain a distinct identity. When all the kids are black, getting good grades is just .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. getting good grades.<blockquote>Buck does not mean that the notoriously lousy all-black inner-city schools should be our model for success. But in the increasing numbers of all-black charter schools, as well as public ones turned around by dynamic principals, students calling one another &#8220;white&#8221; for liking schools is as unheard of as it was in the black schools of yesteryear. Our visceral recoil today at any conception of an all-black school as reminiscent of shabby one-room schoolhouses in the segregated Deep South must be discontinued.<br>

<p>An &#8220;all white school&#8221; can never be seriously discussed.  It makes no difference whether it is good for white kids.  In fact, merely discussing whether something is good for white kids is anathema to most people.</p>

		<p>Steve Sailer just dealt with the &#8220;acting white&#8221; bromide as an excuse to explain away racial difference in intelligence:</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/23par8y</p>
<p>Basically, it boils down to this:  There is an even bigger &#8220;anti-educational bias&#8221; (i.e. learning is considered &#8220;acting white&#8221;) among Chicano Hispanics than blacks, yet they tend to score higher than blacks.</p>

<p>The standard cheap shot against those already dead (or some other whites - or against &#8216;whiteness&rsquo; itself - it&rsquo;s just Easier when the someone is already dead). Many, if not most districts, had to over-fund black schools as a matter of defending segregation. The same thing goes on today. Most large cities spend way more per pupil than do schools in the outlying areas, yet entire debates take place in the media (and school teachers learn at university) as if the opposite reality is true, and that it&rsquo;s a &#8216;shameful&rsquo; practice. </p>

		<p>The biggest drawback to all black schools is how huge the academic gap between them and other schools will become. Then black parents will demand that the black kids go to integrated schools because the black kids are getting &#8220;an inferior education&#8221;.The circle will have been completed.</p>

		<p>But it is, after all,  a white thing. Getting advanced degrees and pursuing higher learning is &#8220;acting white&#8221;, that&rsquo;s what our strong suit has been all these years. It&rsquo;s not by being good at breakdancing that whites have distinguished themselves. So they really aren&rsquo;t far off the mark when they say things like this. If various groups don&rsquo;t care for education then so be it, they&rsquo;re making their choice. Educational resources are finite and should be used for those who might benefit, not wasted on dragging horses to water. I for one wouldn&rsquo;t get down on my hands and knees and beg anyone to consent to go ahead and go through school; they&rsquo;re not going to share their future paychecks with me anyhow.    </p>

		<p>First of all, blacks don&rsquo;t tell another black he&rsquo;s &#8220;acting white&#8221; by trying to learn, because they think they REALLY ARE &#8220;acting white.&#8221;  Blacks tell other blacks that, because they don&rsquo;t have the intelligence to learn basic school subjects, so pretending they don&rsquo;t want to do it because it&rsquo;s &#8220;acting white,&#8221; covers up their real excuse which is that they&rsquo;re too stupid to do the work.</p>
<p>Secondly, most adult blacks themselves will be against all black schools, because they know full well their little ones won&rsquo;t learn in an all black environment either, because they can&rsquo;t learn.   But the biggest reason is that blacks won&rsquo;t have whitey to blame when the whole debacle ends up in abysmal failure.</p>
<p>Too, some white just might screw up his flagging courage a bit and point out that the students at all blacks schools in all black countries are just as far below white students as the the blacks are here in the US. </p>
<p>The only way the brilliant leftist educators are going to close the achievement gap is to lower the school standard to the black level, which is what they&rsquo;ve done to some extent already.</p>

<p>Whatever, you give to blacks, it will eventually end up be shabby.  Give them a prosperous country and they will run it into the ground.  No other racial groups will pander to the blacks, only the whites.  The attitude of other racial groups, whether blacks can cut it or not on their own, it&rsquo;s not their business.  And that&rsquo;s the way it was meant to be.  Competition builds character and wits, it does not develop by living off hand outs and affirmative action.  Similarly in the case of Hispanics, instead of allowing them to sneak into this country, they need to learn how to deal with their own corrupted government.  This country is already giving a message to the Hispanics that you do not need to obey the laws in this country.    <br>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a question, segregation was obviously preferable 60 years ago, and it&rsquo;s still obviously preferable today.</p>
<p>The arguments against do not come from rationality or science or any sort of constitutional disagreement, they come from an utter hatred of white society, of everything successful and strong in the world.</p>

		<p>Absolutely, we should encourage all-black schools as well as giving any non-black the option of not having to attend any school that has a black plurality because it will be dangerous for non-blacks such a place.   Why sacrifice a whole generation when we can just let the minority ne&rsquo;er do wells destroy just each other. </p>

		<p>Below are excerpts from a review of The Price They Paid: Desegregation in an African American Community  (Vivian Gunn Morris and Curtis L. Morris, New York: Teachers College Press, 2002). The Price They Paid is a study of a black high school in Tuscumbia, Alabama, closed because of desegregation:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; desegregation policies disrupted a symbiotic relationship that once existed between the black community and black schools and educators &hellip; black people in Tuscumbia &hellip; felt the sting of racism &hellip; Yet &hellip; the African American community worked collectively to ensure that the school met the needs of black children and functioned in the overall interest of the black community. As elsewhere throughout the segregated South &hellip; the black people of Tuscumbia donated land to build the school, and offered their time and other resources. Moreover, while white policymakers and district leaders imposed a curriculum that reflected an industrial model [vocational education] &hellip; the school leaders at Trenholm High School resisted this imposition, and embraced the classical or liberal educational model. </p>
<p>&#8220;Unlike many scholarly accounts of segregated black schooling, which focus on the disparities in resources between black and white schools, this account of a black school community focuses on black agency in the midst of legalized racial apartheid &hellip; Like many black schools of its day, Trenholm played an integral role in the black community. Black educators created opportunities for black children to display their talents, leadership, and speaking abilities, and also imparted a sense of responsibility to the children &hellip;&#8221; </p>

		<p>commentsOf course we should endorse schools for the blacks only, and that only taxes from black &#8220;communities&#8221; pay for them.</p>
<p>When blacks are in school with blacks, they aren&rsquo;t in school with your beautiful White Daughter, aren&rsquo;t participating in extracurricular activities with your White Daughter, and probably won&rsquo;t have easy access to making your White Daughter the baby mama of the next generation of yellow mulatto babies. </p>

		<p>Yes, we should encourage racially segregated schools. Those of us who accept the science of biological differences in racial-types must necessarily believe that racially seperate schools are the ONLY reasonable situation. It is unfair to Blacks and Hispanics to expect them perform to White standards and it is most assuredly unfair to Whites to be held back by underperforming and chronically misbehaving non-Whites. To any WN or racially aware human being, this MUST be the solution.    </p>

<p>This is true even now, in times when officially segregated schoo&rsquo;s do not exist. An amount more of money is spent on an all-black grammar schoo&rsquo; in Chicago than is spent on an all-white schoo&rsquo; in next door Du Page county.</p>
<p>Over-funding does not mean, of course, over-results.</p>
<p>I not so long ago had a visit to my old grammar schoo&rsquo;. NOW an Afro-centric schoo&rsquo; that draws students from all over the south side of Chi. The students do OK, but they are a select group. </p>

		<p>I am entirely for all-black schools &hellip; and all-brown schools. Then we can get back to the good old days of all-White schools. However, we Americans (minorities included) all know that Whites are so successful and so attractive that the non-Whites will gravitate to and IMPOSE  themselves upon the superior Whites and their institutions. IMPOSITION: that is what bugs me most about the past six decades of American history. If Whites have built something nice and pleasing, you know damned well who is going to be IMPOSING themselves upon the White creation. All I want is FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION and FREEDOM FROM THE IMPOSITION OF NON-WHITES on White establishments and affairs.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Notwithstanding the very labored efforts made for their intellectual improvement, taken as a body they have made no advancement. Averse to physical labor, they are equally averse to intellectual effort. The young [black] acquires readily the first rudiments of education, where memory and imitation are chiefly brought into action, but for any higher effort of reason and judgment he is, as a general rule, utterly incapable.&#8221;</p>

		<p>One may argue the benefits of having all black schools, but I do not believe that this is the cure for sentiments that associate good grades with acting white. I went to elementary school in Harlem when it was hard to find any white students at all and this criticism was levied at me.</p>
<p>I do think that there are benefits to all black schools for the *right* students. It could lower distractions to academic achievement. I believe the same is true of single sex schools. There too there are benefits for the right students.</p>
<p>Reading the start of this post further, the answer is self evident. Its not so much the all-blackness, but the skill of the people operating the school which evidently exceeds the skill of the faculty and management of traditional inner-city schools.<br>

		<p>The more things change, the more they stay the same. Blacks and their liberal elite handlers are now tacitly admitting that segregated schools were best after all, after spending untold trillions on integrating schools by busing and other means, and costing whites all of their wealth paying for private schools, or moving numerous times in search of the ever elusive good public(translation &#8220;free&#8221;) school for their children. Don&rsquo;t hold your breathe waiting for an apology, much less a payback, from the minorities, the liberals, and the elites that brought all of this misery upon us-they&rsquo;re glad they did it to us!</p>

		<p>Slightly off the center of topic, but unlike many of the readers here, I DID attend a small, &#8220;one-room school&#8221; (although in actuality there were 2 classrooms, plus two restrooms in the building.) There were 19 students in grades 1-8 in attendance, and I was one of the two 6th graders. The teachers were a husband-and-wife team, the husband teaching grades 1-4 in one room, the wife teaching grades 5-8 in the other. It was the best school year I ever had, both academically and socially. Admittedly all the students and both teachers were lily white, and thought nothing of it. God knows it was unusual enough in 1968, and probably against the law now. This was in a small town in central Washington State, not the deep south.<br>
The point I am eventually getting to is that a &#8220;small, one-room schoolhouse&#8221; isn&rsquo;t all bad and real learning can take place if the right atmosphere prevails. Whether this is possible with  African-American students or not is rather doubtful.  </p>

		<p>There must be a lot of all-black or nearly all-black schools already, given the de facto segregation that exists in housing.  Add to that the fact that many, many white people in cities send their kids to private schools to at least avoid the ghetto crowd.  Probably, many non-whites who can afford it do the same.  And schools in poor neighborhoods usually have a lesser tax base, thus worse schools.  <br>
I don&rsquo;t know, but I would bet that the old black schools in the South dumbed down the curricula.  That&rsquo;s probably what is needed now, but no one has to admit that&rsquo;s what will be done.  Thus, face will be saved, and blacks can teach that the ancient Egyptians were all black and could fly, if they please.  There would still be no de jure segregation, and blacks would be free to attend integrated schools if they wish.  Those with low IQ&rsquo;s and/or lack of motivation would probably prefer ghetto-grade institutions.  Only whites who live in mostly black areas or those with silly liberal ideas would end up in these schools.</p>

		<p>The majority of the charter schools in Texas are all black, set up for students who couldn&rsquo;t even handle the public schools.  Other than an afrocentric curriculum (i.e. falsifying history) and a big emphasis on self esteem, they also prominently feature financial irregularities, with their black administrators making fraudulent use of lots of state funding (i.e. taxes paid by whites).  Perhaps it would be better if all schools were racially distinct both by student body and funding; the local schools in my suburb are heavily Asian and it&rsquo;s impossible to graduate in the top 10% (required for automatic admission to the better Texas state schools) without a GPA above 4.0.  Many local whites avoid the AP and honors classes and various extracurricular activities like orchestra because they are majority Asian, and therefore equated with being an obsessively-studious geek.  </p>

		<p>My mother went to a 6 room schoolhouse from first through sixth grade and the fourth grade teacher was also the principal. There was an equivalent size black school about 3 blocks away. One time, the principal of the white school had me mother deliver a package to the principal of the black school. What stuck out in her mind was that at the black school, the principal kept a baseball bat on her desk. Thia was not for fear of the K; they were not going to torch an elementary school in the 1930&rsquo;s. This was to keep the malcontents in line (or at least quiet). </p>
<p>If it were legal to filter out by IQ, segregate the schools again and let the talented 10th have their own schools where they can &#8220;act white&#8221;. </p>

		<p>  My only concern is this&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p> Arizona rightly disbanded ethnic study programs in their schools because they were sick and tired of it being used as an anti-white, anti-American, leftist breeding ground.  These &#8220;ethnic studies&#8221; programs caused far more problems then they solved.</p>
<p> What&rsquo;s going to happen if we give minorities their own schools and have the proverbial fox watching the chicken coop?  I can see it now, the New Blank Panthers along with Kahleed Mohammad and the Nation of Islam lecturing the students on how the White Devil must be destroyed.</p>
<p> Some food for thought&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>

		<p>I went to an all-white school growing up.  I must say I believe it benefitted me greatly.  If I had gone to a part-black school, I might have been accused of &#8216;acting black&rsquo; because I didn&rsquo;t get the best grades for a long time.</p>
<p>The problem for those who want all black schools is that other liberals, particularly whites, would oppose the blacks on this with great ferocity.  White liberals are just as bad for blacks as they are for whites.</p>

Coleman Report<br>
Coleman is widely cited in the field of sociology of education. In the 1960s, he and several other scholars were commissioned to write a report on educational equality in the U.S. It was one of the largest studies in history, with more than 150,000 students in the sample. The result was a massive report of over 700 pages. That 1966 report  &mdash;  titled &#8220;Equality of Educational Opportunity&#8221; (or often simply called the &#8220;Coleman Report&#8221;)  &mdash;  fueled debate about &#8220;school effects&#8221; that has continued since.[1][2] The report was commonly presented as evidence, or an argument, that school funding has little effect on student achievement. A more precise reading of the Coleman Report is that student background and socioeconomic status are much more important in determining educational outcomes than are measured differences in school resources (i.e. per pupil spending).[2] Another controversial finding of the Coleman Report was that, on average, black schools were funded on a nearly equal basis by the 1960s. This was probably because many Southern states vastly raised their spending on black schools in the 1950s, in the hopes of avoiding compliance with the Brown v. Board of Education decision.[citation needed]</p>
<p>This research also suggested that socially disadvantaged black students profited from schooling in racially-mixed classrooms. This was a catalyst for the implementation of desegregation busing systems, ferrying black students to integrated schools. Following up on this, in 1975 Coleman published the results of further research, this time into the effects of school busing systems intended to bring lower-class black students into higher-class mixed race schools. His conclusion was that white parents moved their children out of such schools in large numbers; this is known as &#8220;white flight&#8221;. His 1966 article had explained that black students would only benefit from integrated schooling if there was a majority of white students in the classroom; the mass busing system had failed.</p>
<p>Coleman&rsquo;s findings regarding &#8220;white flight&#8221; were not well received in some quarters, particularly among some members of the American Sociological Association. In response, efforts sprang up during the mid 70s to revoke his ASA membership.[3][4] Coleman remained a member and ironically twenty years later became the ASA&rsquo;s president.<br>

Last spring, in Fairburn, Georgia, officials in two schools piloted a startling attendance program. If struggling 8th and 11th graders showed up for study hall, they could earn $8 an hour, and if their grades and test scores rose significantly, they would receive a bonus. An Associated Press story termed the policy a &ldquo;bribe,&rdquo; and a Georgia State University professor on National Public Radio declared it &ldquo;morally bankrupt.&rdquo; But Ben Chavis, then principal of American Indian Public Charter School in East Oakland, California, had started paying students for attendance years ago with steady results, doubling math scores in the school over time. &ldquo;Poor people love money,&rdquo; he explains, so why not let it motivate the kids? He even met with drug dealers off campus and offered them $5 for every truant they brought back. The cash came from creative budgeting, for instance, no computers for the kids. (&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t read,&rdquo; he declares, &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t need a computer!&rdquo;)<br>

It may well be, for certain kinds of students, of all racial backgrounds, an emphasis on the real rather than the theoretical may be a better way forwards.</p>
<p>Has anyone got some data on the European trade school approach?  My biggest wonder is whether or not we could guarantee placement for kids entering the workforce early.  What that would mean in terms of gargantuan labor control entities (union or government) on total potential for individual advancement.  And particularly what it would do for borderline students who, whether for IQ or personality driven reasons would see the early road to real earnings driven social power as being more attractive than the eventual bonus of a higher education driven approach to what still might be severely capped and/or taxed wages.</p>

		<p> The problem as I see it is this: It is always about them, what they want, what they need, what is best for them as a race. White people are never allowed to think that way publicly.<br>
 I am tired of not being allowed to think of the wants, needs and what is best for our race.</p>

		<p>In order to survive and flourish, each race needs its own centres of education, community, health care, places of employment and so on, but most essentially of all, each needs his own exclusive territory to preserve his heritage, language, belief system, culture and traditions.  Not that long ago, these ideals and practices was accepted as normal, natural and wholesome.</p>
<p>White Marxist Liberals justify their existence precisely because they&rsquo;re in the business of patronising AND undermining the mental potential and related capabilities of non-White ethnicities, particularly the Black.  </p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve had their day in the circus ring and are now well past their sell-by dates.</p>

		<p>I believe segregating the schools physically might be too much of a financial burden.  As someone mentioned, we would have to overpay black schools.<br>
As a graduated senior (Graduated last month), I can tell you that tell you that our schools are very much segregated.  They get more segregated as you go up in grade levels.  In high school the majority of blacks that I saw in school was during lunch.  The majority of them were in regulars classes.  There were only a few in the honors classes (the ones I took).  However, the white to black ratio in honors classes was much higher than in regular classes.  When it came to the Advanced Placement classes, the amount of blacks became little to none.  In the advanced classes the black people even spoke, dressed, and acted much like white people.  The only time I ever really had to have a noticable black group in my classes was when I took an elective or P.E. (as it was required).  However, I did not mind this too much.  Because the classes I take with black people are so easy to me, that I could pass almost without attending; it was not as if they held me back academically.  As a youth, I feel that my generation has adapted to having blacks in our classrooms.  Rather than seeing them as &#8220;wild animals in our homes&#8221; as dogs once were, we have come to see them as &#8220;stupid pets which do the darndest things to make us laugh&#8221;.</p>
<p>If you want to segregate schools, we need to simply create school tiers which only accept students of a certain caliber of academic achievement.  This will not only segregate the schools by race, but also ween the whites that act black, &#8220;Uh, oh, oreos&#8221; as I call them, from the advanced schools as well.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t object to blacks having all black schools.  It might even do them some good, as all the available evidence shows that white students do not have some sort of magic pixie dust that makes black students in the same classroom do better.  The problem is that it is deemed to be a crime of high order to have any all white schools.  As Lorin has already said, whites are never allowed to argue for a policy on the basis that it benefits whites, whereas people of every other race do argue for policies on the basis that it benefits their race, and are encouraged to do so.</p>
<p>Anonymous #32: <i>If you want to segregate schools, we need to simply create school tiers which only accept students of a certain caliber of academic achievement.

<p>You must realize that the left is well aware that honors and advanced placement courses tend to be overwhelmingly white and Asian, with very few blacks and Hispanics.  That is why they often oppose such courses.  If the &#8220;racial justice&#8221; crowd can&rsquo;t raise the blacks up they are generally content to at least drag the whites down.<br>
