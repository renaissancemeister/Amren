			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Adam Klawonn, Reader Supported News, June 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Anchor babies isn&rsquo;t a very endearing term, but in Arizona those are the words being used to tag children born in the U.S. to illegal immigrants. While not new, the term is increasingly part of the local vernacular because the primary authors of the nation&rsquo;s toughest and most controversial immigration law are targeting these tots  &mdash;  the legal weights that anchor many undocumented aliens in the U.S.  &mdash;  for their next move.</p>
<p>Buoyed by recent public opinion polls suggesting they&rsquo;re on the right track with illegal immigration, Arizona Republicans will likely introduce legislation this fall that would deny birth certificates to children born in Arizona  &mdash;  and thus American citizens according to the U.S. Constitution  &mdash;  to parents who are not legal U.S. citizens. {snip}</p>
<p>But the likely new bill is for the kids. While SB1070 essentially requires of-age migrants to have the proper citizenship paperwork, the potential &#8220;anchor baby&#8221; bill blocks the next generation from ever being able to obtain it. The idea is to make the citizenship process so difficult that illegal immigrants pull up the anchor and leave.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Today, Pearce says, the 14th Amendment has been &#8220;hijacked&#8221; by illegal immigrants. &#8220;They use it as a wedge,&#8221; he says. &#8220;This is an orchestrated effort by them to come here and have children to gain access to the great welfare state we&rsquo;ve created.&#8221; Pearce says he is aware of the constitutional issues involved with the bill and vows to introduce it nevertheless. &#8220;We will write it right.&#8221; He and other Republicans in the red state Arizona point to popular sympathy: 58% of Americans polled by Rasmussen think illegal immigrants whose children are born in the U.S. should not receive citizenship; support for that stance is 76% among Republicans.</p>
<p>Those who oppose the bill say it would lead to more discrimination and divide the community. Among them is Phoenix resident Susan Vie, who is leading a citizen group that&rsquo;s behind an opposing ballot initiative. She moved to the U.S. 30 years ago from Argentina, became a naturalized citizen and now works as a client-relations representative for a vaccine company. {snip} Vie&rsquo;s citizen initiative would prohibit SB1070 from taking effect and place a three-year moratorium on all related laws  &mdash;  including the anchor-baby bill  &mdash;  to buy more time for federal immigration reform. Her group is racing to collect 153,365 signatures by July 1 to qualify for the Nov. 2 general election.</p>

		<p>The 14th Amendment was also forced upon the entire nation at GUNPOINT and the government did not follow the proper Constitutional procedures in order to ratify said amendment.</p>
<p>Just look at the Naturalization Act of 1795 to see what the Founders thought re: immigration.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about time we question the legality of every single amendment after the original ten. These bastards have gone too far!</p>

		<p>Ms. Vie, when it comes to illegal aliens, discrimination and division is what we want!  If hand-wringing liberals and anti-Anglo Hispanics want to get on the wrong side of patriotic Americans, let them.  <br>
The federal government is getting itself into a precarious position when it takes on rebellious states, as the nation found out 150 years ago.  And now, unlike then, it probably lacks the will and the drive to mount anymore than a paper offensive.  Is Obama going to send federal troops to a state that refuses to march lockstep?  He doesn&rsquo;t even understand the loyalty many Americans feel to their own states and the resentment people can feel when their homelands are disparaged!</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Today, Pearce says, the 14th Amendment has been &lsquo;hijacked&rsquo; by illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>That is the key point here and it should never, ever, be forgotten!</p>
<p>Moreover, as #1 Anonymous observes: &ldquo;The 14th Amendment was also forced upon the entire nation at GUNPOINT and the government did not follow the proper Constitutional procedures in order to ratify said amendment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>People in this country are either so ignorant or disenchanted with the political system&rsquo;s abuses and arrogance, that they cannot rationally countermand its excesses anymore. We should not only be working legally and politically to prevent all &ldquo;citizenship&rdquo; to anchor babies at present, but also to revoke the illegal &ldquo;amnesties&rdquo; granted to all alien invaders in the past. Those were just as questionable, since they aided and abetted criminal activities against our national sovereignty and security.</p>
<p>Or in other words, they were acts of institutional treason!!!</p>
<p>Enough said!!!!</p>

		<p>The 14th has NOTHING to do with making citizens out of anyone who sets foot on our soil, especially illegals and their anchor babies.</p>
<p>  It was AFTER the Civil War and was the Dred/Scott decision to give freed slaves citizenship. I also have a problem with that, we are paying for it now, aren&rsquo;t we? </p>
<p> Lincoln was in the process of sending them to Liberia when he was shot. He KNEW that blacks and Whites should never live in the same nation, let alone the same neighborhoods as they do now.</p>

		<p>10% OF ALL US BIRTHS ARE TO ILLEGAL ALIEN MOTHERS:</p>
<p>Excerpt from 2005 Center for Immigration Studies report, &#8220;Births to Immigrants at All-Time High,&#8221; Center for Immigration Studies, July, 2005:<br>
<a href="https://www.cis.org/articles/2005/back805.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.cis.org/articles/2005/back805.html</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;A new analysis of birth records by the Center for Immigration Studies shows that in 2002 almost one in four births in the United States was to an immigrant mother (legal or illegal), the highest level in American history. In addition, nearly ten percent of all births in the country were to illegal-alien mothers.&rdquo;<br>

<p>Citizenship in most countries is based on blood. I know of very few or none(not an expert) that is based on birthplace. We should join the rest of the world. In order to be born a citizen, one of your parents should be a citizen at the time of a child&rsquo;s birth. </p>

		<p>John Eastman, Dean, Chapman University School of Law on the fallacy of &ldquo;automatic birthight citizenship&rdquo;  &mdash;  as applied to children of tourists and children of illegal aliens: 5 minute video:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Birthright Citizenship &amp; Allegiance to America: Chapman University School of Law Dean Dr. John Eastman explains why the 14th Amendment does not give the children of illegal immigrants  &mdash;  or legal tourists for that matter  &mdash;  automatic citizenship at birth.

<p>I see she Vie, originally from Argentina, is sticking by her Hispanic brethern. She came over here promising to uphold the laws of the US when she gained citizenship and is now advocating breaking them. She should be stipped of her citizenship and sent back to Argentina, which I&rsquo;ll bet doesn&rsquo;t allow children of illegals to gain citizenship. Let her change Argentina&rsquo;s laws.<br>

		<p>There is so much cow manure in such a short excerpt. The author must have exceptional talent in this kind of stuffing.</p>
<p>&#8220;controversial immigration law&#8221; - So, just because lawbreakers and their advocates don&rsquo;t like it, it&rsquo;s &#8220;controversial&#8221;? If so then EVERY criminal law is &#8220;controversial&#8221;. The fact is that most of &#8220;Liberal&#8221; dogmas are controversial, and the Prez. 0. is controversial, yet no &#8220;mainstream&#8221; journalist will use this adjective in that context.</p>
<p>&#8220;children born in Arizona &mdash; and thus American citizens according to the U.S. Constitution&#8221; - No, the Constitution doesn&rsquo;t grant illegal aliens&rsquo; children U.S. Citizenship. 14th Amendment does not, either, as it requires a newborn to be &#8220;subject to jurisdiction&#8221; of the U.S. in order to be eligible for birthright citizenship. And Mexican government made it clear and several times that Mexican illegals and their U.S.-born children are subject to Mexican jurisdiction; this is why they asserted right to act on their behalf and in their defense.</p>
<p>&#8220;the potential &#8216;anchor baby&rsquo; bill blocks the next generation from ever being able to obtain&#8221; &#8220;the proper citizenship paperwork&#8221; - It&rsquo;s like complaining that requirement of a proof of purchase in order to register a vehicle with DMV blocks a thief from ever being able to obtain a pink slip for stolen car.</p>
<p>&#8220;it [the bill] would lead to more discrimination and divide the community&#8221; - This is the worst smelling piece. Firstly, it reverses the blame from one ethnic group (mestizos) of one nationality (Mexican) for their invasion and colonization of the U.S. onto the invaded as if it made a difference for us whether those who are stilling the fruits of our and our ancestors&rsquo; work are of the same color as we are or not. (Hence, the absurd &#8220;discrimination&#8221; charge.) Secondly, it attempts to imply that attempts to resist invasion and hostile takeover &#8220;divide&#8221; us from the invaders, as if we have ever united with them. It&rsquo;s worth remembering here that these is the &#8220;Latino&#8221; typical rhetoric that is inflammatory, divisive, and hateful towards &#8220;Gringos&#8221;: they call us &#8220;racists&#8221;, &#8220;oppressors&#8221;, and occupiers of their &#8220;historic&#8221; land that they promise to &#8220;liberate.&#8221; And they get away with revising U.S. history that gives them &#8220;right&#8221; to their irredentist territorial claims by their quasi-separatist organizations, like La Raza (The [mestizo] Race). </p>
<p>&#8220;buy more time for federal immigration reform&#8221; - There is nothing in the immigration law that needs to be reformed, except - perhaps - its enforcement. This is the deportation system and NOT the immigration law that is broken. The lawbreakers and their protectors would like to gibe the feds the monopoly of anything even remotely related to immigration because they know well that the federal government is dysfunctional and cannot enforce the border and immigration law.</p>
<p>Remember, every single Mexican &#8220;migrant&#8221; that settles on America&rsquo;s shores is one more dedicated supported of the above absurdities. The only way for us to avoid trouble is to keep them on the South side of the border.</p>

		<p>The 14th Amendment states that &#8220;All persons, born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, the part that is being overlooked is &#8220;and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.&#8221; The children of illegal immigrants, like their parents, are subject to the juristiction of their home country.</p>

		<p>As per Anonymous #1 at 5:46 PM on June 14: </p>
<p>We need to make a closer examination of the political chicanery that saddled us with the 14th Amendment in the first place.  None of the ex-Confederate Southern states favored it, and along with the fact that Ohio, New Jersey, and Oregon had rescinded their ratifications of it, it lacked the 3/4ths majority needed to pass.  But Radical Secretary of State, Wm. Seward, ignored the rescissions and declared it law anyway, in 1868.  When challenged in 1919, the Supreme Court upheld his devious machinations, and this very dubious Amendment has been the foundation for all &#8220;civil rights&#8221; legislation since, including Brown v Board ad infinitum.</p>
<p>If this &#8220;Ace of Spades&#8221; were to be pulled from the deck, the whole &#8220;civil rights&#8221; house of cards would collapse on itself.  </p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t be done?</p>
<p>Look what happened to Prohibition!</p>
<p>Power to the people! Let&rsquo;s repeal the 14th Amendment! </p>

		<p>What the article doesn&rsquo;t mention are the ramifications of allowing the anchor baby fiasco to continue.  When people are given deportation orders but they have already had their children here, white Americans are accused of breaking up families via immigration raids and deportation orders.  I&rsquo;ve read articles in which illegals will claim sanctuary in churches&hellip;the absurdity of it all. </p>

		<p>Instead of taking polls about who agrees/disagrees with this idea, the public needs to get educated.  I am pasting a link from a comment on the TX article from the 14th.  People, be informed and not just opinionated!  We as legal citizens of this amazing country are, in fact, SUPPORTED by the Constitution in opposing citizenship for anchor babies.  The 14th Amendment does NOT guarantee U.S. citizenship to a person just because they&rsquo;re born here.<br>

10% OF ALL US BIRTHS ARE TO ILLEGAL ALIEN MOTHERS</p>
<p> Odds are this is even more pronounced now that it was in 2005 when the aforementioned study was made. Birthright citizenship is arguably the biggest US policy flaw in regards to illegal immigration. Now Close to H-A-L-F of all births are to non-white mothers. Just do the math- by eleminating birthright citizenship births to minority mothers will not longer be close to this very alarming tipping point. Why aren&rsquo;t there more states considering what is now being planned in AZ?! Whether or not the US becomes a part of the Third-world may very well depend on it. </p>

		<p>I am not sure I understand the extent to which any attempt to revoke citizenship would apply to both the children and those looking to exploit their new found citizenship as parents and relatives.</p>
<p>Are we saying that children born before the act would be grandfathered in but their parents would not be?</p>
<p>Or are we saying that all illegal emmigres would be chucked out and will Mexico take them?</p>
<p>Finally, assuming that there are Constitutional and certainly Federal exceptions against the wholesale deportation of nominally U.S. citizens (remember: enforcing the law which the Feds will not.  Nothing more, nothing challengeable), what exactly are we looking at in terms of wellfare costs to integrate these childrens within Hispanic families (on incentive, I presume) or raising orphanages to house them until adulthood?</p>
<p>The death of nominally good ideas is always in the details.  And I don&rsquo;t see a reasonable, planned, execution here so much as a kneejerk reaction to Federal inertia.</p>
<p>At some level, we may well have to deal with Hispanic nationals who support their brethren on racial/ethnic grounds.  And it would help to have some means to explain what was going to occur, why and under what circumstances of ameliorative recompense.</p>

		<p>Yes we *do* need immigration reform; that is to return to the immigration laws we had between 1952-1964 where immigration quotas were set based on the compatibility of other countries cultures and values with ours.</p>
<p>Alas it looks like it will require a Constitutional amendment do properly deal with the &#8220;anchor baby&#8221; problem as I see no chance of  the Supreme Court ever allowing Congress or the states  to enact legislation to bar the offspring of illegal aliens and tourists from American birthright citizenship.<br>
