<h1>Cops: Man Killed Wife</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sherry Long, Times Leader (Wilkes-Barre), June 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A grandfather with a history of domestic violence spent Father&rsquo;s Day in jail Sunday after police charged him with killing his wife with a spear in their city home late Saturday night during an argument over holiday plans.</p>
<p>An immigrant from Africa, Harun Ngolo, 65, was charged with homicide, simple assault and two counts of aggravated assault by Wilkes-Barre police and the Luzerne County District Attorney&rsquo;s Office. He allegedly killed his wife, 62-year-old Maria Jeringa Ngolo, stabbed his adult son, Moses Ngolo and cut his 3-year-old grandson, Noah Cobin, shortly after 11 p.m. Saturday at their Simpson Street home in South Wilkes-Barre.</p>
<p>Maria Ngolo had at least one protection-from-abuse order against her husband in the past. Moses Ngolo, believed to be 28, told police he wanted to move out of his parents&rsquo; home, yet stayed at his mother&rsquo;s request because she feared her husband&rsquo;s past history of domestic violence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>District Judge Daniel O&rsquo;Donnell ordered Harun Ngolo held without bail in the county prison during the 15-minute arraignment Sunday in the judge&rsquo;s Sugarloaf Township office. Harun Ngolo is scheduled for a preliminary hearing at 10 a.m. Thursday in Central Court.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of the nature of the charge, it is not bailable,&#8221; O&rsquo;Donnell told the 5-foot-tall man, a native of Zaire, now known as the Republic of Congo, in Central Africa.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Officers were dispatched to the home for a fight between a father and son at 11:38 p.m. Saturday. Once they arrived they found Moses Ngolo with stab wounds to his chest and stomach on the first floor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police said a bloody Harun Ngolo was found standing over his wife, who was also covered in blood after being stabbed many times.</p>
<p>The Ngolos&rsquo; 3-year-old grandson was on the bed bloodied with cuts to his legs. The alleged murder weapon, a long wooden pole with a knife attached, was found at the base of the bed on the floor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Court documents show Harun Ngolo had a history of family violence.</p>
<p>An arrest affidavit dated Dec. 22, 2007, stated Harun Ngolo was arrested after chasing Maria and Moses Ngolo around the home with a weapon similar to the one he allegedly used Saturday. During the 2007 incident, Harun Ngolo fastened a steak knife to the end of a 3-foot metal poll and chased the family through their Simpson Street home.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In late February 2007, Harun Ngolo was arrested on charges he assaulted his wife and Moses with a hammer and garden tool. The disposition of that case could not be determined Sunday.</p>
<p>He also pleaded guilty in June 2004 to a summary count of harassment in Wilkes-Barre. No further information regarding that incident or possible victims was available.</p>
<p>The Ngolos came to the United States in 1993 as political refugees, according to a Times Leader feature story done on them 17 years ago.</p>

		<p>By coincidence I had a man from the Congo drop a resume off today at my business.</p>
<p>There was nothing in his C.V. that was exceptional, in fact his computer skills were on par with a school age child, and his work experience was below entry level.</p>
<p>There was absolutely no reason for this man to be here. He is living proof that immigration serves no other purpose but to add more consumer mouths to feed.</p>

		<p>Oh the joys of multiculturalism! In virtually every tribal society in Africa, the father reigns supreme, and his word is law. The white citizens of Wilkes-Barre, PA are simply treating it as another Bantu domestic quarrel, the kind you&rsquo;d expect to find in Harlem or Compton or Newark, NJ. Did they expect that this pygmy family from old Zaire would come here, and get jobs as stockbrokers, or assimilate themselves into the high society of Wilkes-Barre?</p>
<p>This is reminiscent of an episode on &#8220;NYPD Blue&#8221;, where a Nigerian man was arrested and charged with murdering his wife. He calmly tells the arresting detectives, that he killed his wife, because she disobeyed him. When he was told he was in America now, and that his wife had rights,he said it didn&rsquo;t matter; his wife disobeyed him.</p>
<p>You can take the Bantu out of the jungle, but you can&rsquo;t take the jungle out of the Bantu. A statement like that has been derided as &#8220;racist&#8221;, when, in fact, it is a statement of TRUTH.</p>
<p>The bitter irony of all this is, they came here as &#8220;political refugees, and here the clan leader kills and injures his own family members. He did the Zaire regime&rsquo;s job, for it!</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, don&rsquo;t pygmies have low IQs, somewhere in the 55-70 range?</p>

<p><br>
Somehow, by my lights, &#8220;Harun Ngolo&#8221; and &#8220;Simpson Street&#8221; just don&rsquo;t seem to go together. </p>
<p>Why Harun Ngolo was chasing his family with a steak knife to the end of a 3-foot metal pole NOT in his native Republic of Congo, but in <i>Pennsylvania</i>, is the unmentionable problem at the root of this latest violent-immigrant saga. The question the reporter should be asking here   &mdash;   but of course will NEVER ask   &mdash;   is: what are these under-evolved African tribesmen even DOING in America when they plainly aren&rsquo;t a good fit for the modern world?</p>

<p>&#8220;Harun Ngolo fastened a steak knife to the end of a 3-foot metal poll&hellip;&#8221; [sic]<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Not to be picky, but  since you raise the subject, I have to wonder about that reporter. What short of journalist  would not know the difference between a &#8220;pole&#8221; and a &#8220;poll&#8221;?    </p>
<p>A misspelling may seem  a minor thing, just a drop in the bucket, but in addition to the horrible nature of this crime, this reportage is just one more indication of the caliber of the professionals that we are getting today, and another reason why America is sliding downhill.  Is this an affirmative action journalist, as I suspect?  </p>
<p>And another thing, I would take that name, Harun, to be Moslem.  One more drop in the bucket. </p>
<p>And what is meant by &#8220;their city home&#8221;? Does that refer to public housing, or their home in the city? (Do they have another?)  I&rsquo;d be inclined to think they&rsquo;re in public housing.</p>
<p>My mother&rsquo;s parents lived near  there.  Formerly, that area was all white.  Totally!  To read of something like this now, is simply incredible.  Were these African Congolese &#8220;refugees&#8221; assigned and sent  there by some resettlement agency?   Was it because   (like Maine and Minnesota) the area was &#8220;too white&#8221;?  I doubt they could have found their way to Wilkes-Barre on their own. And there is nothing there that would attract Africans.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The Ngolos came to the United States in 1993 as political refugees, according to a Times Leader feature story done on them 17 years ago.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to read that story now. I&rsquo;ll bet it was written in glowing terms about how these wonderful people were going to make fine new Americans and would be an asset to the community. You know - enrichment, diversity, all that standard stuff.</p>

		<p>Yes, but the picture of the French cannibal showed an individual who was clearly insane.  Perhaps we are holding the French to a higher standard, but if we are being unfair in this, why are France and the Congo so completely dissimilar?<br>

There will always be crazies. The significant difference is that the crazy Frenchman was in his own country, so they had to put up with one of their own. It was not a result of &#8220;diversity&#8221;.   Whereas, the Congolese was HERE, where he did not have to be, so we have to put up all the expense and trouble of dealing with him.  The cost of &#8220;diversity&#8221;.<br>

		<p> I live in this area and being a professional have had the opportunity to meet the publisher along with many staff and I can tell you unequivocally that Correct spelling is the least of the problems here. A casual look at the daily news reveals constant black and hispanic crime, head in the sand journalism, rampant pc to emulate the NYT masters, and generally sheer lunacy in the newsroom. Despite receiving this rag daily, I only occasionally parse it is always a disappointment. The editorial writers on Sunday are never controversial; we had the great Ann Coulter for a while but the remaining idiots in town raised their cumulative voices and the paper caved and cancelled her column. We do, however, get to read Leonard is the Pitts Jr regularly and realize that he is from African stock! And descended from slaves! And this is the white man&rsquo;s fault! And blahblahblah!!!</p>

		<p>   THIS IS WHY WE SHOULD ALL SUPPORT &#8220;SPEAR CONTROL&#8221;!  Just think, if there were no spears, there would not have been a killing and two woundings.  When are we going to all wake up and see that sensible spear control laws are needed so that people like Mr. Ngolo aren&rsquo;t victimized by the rampant spread of homemade spears in our community?  The Second Amendment does not guarantee his right to have a spear, it only guarantees that the National Guard can have spears.  </p>
<p>   We need Sarah Brady to wheel in her vegetable and tell us all why Spear Control is needed!</p>

		<p>   SOPRANO FAN, don&rsquo;t worry brother, you&rsquo;re preach&rsquo;in to the choir.  You would be hard-pressed to find a bigger supporter of the second amendment than me, and it didn&rsquo;t take the SCOTUS to make me believe it is an individual right.  The &#8220;Bill Of Rights&#8221; is not a bill concerned with government rights, they are in the Articles.  The Bill of Rights, including the second one, were written for the individuals.</p>
<p>   When it all goes to hell in a handbasket, come stand shoulder to shoulder with me and we will freely exercise that Second Amendment right to defend ourselves and our property.</p>
<p>   My previous post was a tongue-in-cheek effort to point out the idiotic arguments of the leftist-lib big government goons.</p>

		<p>I am very disappointed in the responses to this story&hellip;  There is a family that has lost their MOTHER.  A SON has been stabbed.  A CHILD has been stabbed.  SEVEN children have been left without a mother.  She was taken in a very violent matter.  Is everyone so heartless to realize what happened.  Same thing that always happens the abused person hopes the abusive person will change.  It is really that simple.  No matter where you are from the hope is still the same.  In case everyone did not know we all have the same insides, just different colors on the outside.  We all think the same, in the same fashion.  For the comment of &#8220;public housing&#8221; no it was not.  In fact, there is a mortage on the house that the Mother that was killed has been paying for herself.  The comment about &#8220;cosumer mouths to feed&#8221; shame, shame.  Actually they are all feeding themselves and are probably younger than you.  So, you should be nice they will be providing your social security income to you one day.  If nasty comments need to be made it needs to be about the one who is deserving.  And, should be appropriate for anyone to view.  The family of this man is exceptional, kind, polite, and educated.  His behavior should not overshadow their existence.  Would this story have been less shocking if a gun were used.  It should not be, both equal the same ending.  Except, think of the distress this woman, son, and grandson were in.  Think before you type, people.  You can hurt someone with words as jagged as a knife being attached to a pole.  Isn&rsquo;t that what you are making fun of?</p>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
Very true and very sad.  So what is your point?  Who is at fault here?  What are we supposed to be saying?  You make it sound like it&rsquo;s our fault instead of the culprit&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Not to sound callous, Theresa, but generally people who get involved with crazy people are not too sound themselves. Healthy people would stay away and would not get involved with a lunatic in the first place. If they sensed danger   &mdash;   particularly MORTAL DANGER   &mdash;   they would make EVERY EFFORT to get away from that person.  Even if she could not get away from him, why would they have small grandchildren present, exposed to this dangerous lunatic?  They knew what he was like, because he had done this type of thing before. And yet you are blaming US for being insensitive???</p>
