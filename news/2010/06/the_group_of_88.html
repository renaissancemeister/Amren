<h1><a href="http://chronicle.com/blogPost/The-Group-of-88-Is-Doing-Just/24314/">The Group of 88 Is Doing Just Fine</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Bauerlein, Chronicle of Higher Education, May 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One of the biggest academic stories of recent years was the Duke lacrosse scandal, and one of its central exhibits was the rush to judgment by Duke faculty members who signed the notorious &#8220;Group of 88&#8221; statement two weeks after the allegations surfaced {snip}. Long before Nifong was disbarred, K.C. Johnson raised serous criticism about the Group of 88&rsquo;s response, citing particularly the signers&rsquo; disrespect toward due process and their overheated, bullying, and illiberal reading of identity politics into the affair from the start.</p>
<p>If anybody was wondering about how the neglect of basic rights might have damaged the reputations of the signers, however, Johnson has a recent update on the careers of several of them. It appears at Minding the Campus under the title &#8220;Whatever Happened to the Group of 88?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>So, what else is new?  All liberals lie or at least ignore self-evident truths.  Their whole belief system is founded on falsehood, disinformation, slander, fabrication, and utter denial of thoroughly clear truths.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in their DNA. inherent lack of maturity, and unshakable belief in their moral superiority.  They&rsquo;re people who&rsquo;ve never grown up.  How many people have any of you out there ever met who became more liberal with age?  Almost all people living in the real world (which is to say a world with consequences) become more conservative, which is to say realistic, as they they grow older.  A liberal will call this selling out, when it should more properly be called growing up.</p>
<p>Liberals are permanent adolescents who require permanent adult supervision.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s one of life&rsquo;s little ironies:  Among the more anti-Jewish white nationalists &#8220;88&#8221; is a code word for &#8220;Heil Hitler&#8221; (&#8220;H&#8221; being the 8th letter of the alphabet.)  The title &#8220;Group of 88&#8221; fits, for today the real storm troopers and Gestapo agents are all on the left, quick to accuse Whitey of every evil and quick to deny basic rights of free speech and free association to anyone who does not adhere to the reigning dogma.</p>

		<p>Found a great website that tracks nonsense like the Duke 88.  Let&rsquo;s add this to our daily reading lists and help them with our comments.  Obviously, if we post WN sentiment and wisdom, we won&rsquo;t be approved. Be subtle an crafty. Ask questions that open minds.</p>
<p>Universities must be reshaped to accommodate the blacks?  Didn&rsquo;t that fail with society in general? What good did Brown v. Board do? What good did the Civil Rights Act (Hate Whitey Act) do?</p>
<p>Keep a close eye the people that this blog thankfully exposes.</p>

<p>John, great post but I have to disagree about when one gets older they are more conservative. Especially in this day and age. Look at all the older people who voted for Obama. Look at all the oldies in Congress. On the SCOTUS. Look at the AARP, they are as liberal as it gets. Ever read their publications and what they support?  And that doesn&rsquo;t even begin to name them all. I have seen and heard older Whites who are as liberal today than when they were young. I think they are suffering from dementia. BTW, I am an oldie also&hellip; That goes for these NEO-CONS also. They aren&rsquo;t much better since the neoconservatives took over the Republican Party. Ask Pat.B about that.</p>

		<p>Is anyone seriously looking for a trace of character in these pampered teachers?  C&rsquo;mon, folks.  Character is a conservative virtue, and it is soundly rejected by the left. Like honesty, it&rsquo;s an encumbrance to the latter. Apologize?  That will happen when Bill Clinton joins the priesthood.</p>
<p>All the education, status, and I.Q. in the world didn&rsquo;t help these adult-children profs. The 88 are a great example of huge egos with an adolescent level of impulse control. Then again, this is what public education at the highest levels cultivates: Peter Pans. They never have to grow up. </p>
<p>They would, however, make great members of a lynch mob.   </p>

		<p>I think Crystal Gail Mangum and whoever else falsely accused the Duke students should serve the sentence those students would have gotten.</p>
<p>(How much do you want to bet Mangum got mad because they specified WHITE girls&hellip;?)</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s also recall talking head Terry Moran who kicked the accused when they were down and who now co-hosts Nightline.</p>
<p>But why be surprised? if anything, racial hoaxes have HELPED the careers of Sharpton, Jesse, etc.</p>

		<p>Yes&hellip;.but what has happened to the reputation of liberalism, in general, partly due to their behavior.</p>
<p>One day, Duke University itself will fall to the collective scandel.</p>
<p>These people have only succeeded in difusing the consequences not avoiding them.</p>

		<p> I remember the late Erich Segal had the dreadful line in his 1970 cult Novel Love Story: &#8220;love is never having to say you&rsquo;re sorry.&#8221; Well, a liberal/leftist academic novel could have the line &#8220;academia is never admitting that you&rsquo;ve made a mistake.&#8221; This is certainly the case with the Duke 88 group, who far from suffering from their prejudicial, unreasoned and untruthful attacks on the Duke Lacrosse players has been rewarded with higher pay, more prestige, better positions, etc.</p>
