<h1>Finance Bill&rsquo;s Devilish Details</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Editorial, Investor&rsquo;s Business Daily, June 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yes, the bill [the &#8220;Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2010&#8221;] gives Treasury the power to liquidate banks that pose a threat to financial stability. But it essentially exempts minority-owned banks and those approved by Acorn-style urban organizers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The orderly liquidation plan shall take into account actions to avoid or mitigate potential adverse effects on low-income, minority or underserved communities affected by the failure of the covered financial company,&#8221; it says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sen. Richard Shelby and other GOP conferees moved to strike the language, arguing that making an exception for minority neighborhoods defeats the whole purpose of reform, which is to protect all consumers against systemic risk.</p>
<p>But Sen. Chris Dodd, who&rsquo;s running the conference committee with his fellow Democrat, Rep. Barney Frank, shot them down by suggesting that they wanted to deny minorities access to credit.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Studies show that CRA home loans have much higher failure rates. {snip}</p>
<p>Another section of the bill requires the proposed Financial Stability Oversight Council (headed by the Treasury secretary) to consider a zombie institution&rsquo;s &#8220;importance as a source of credit for low-income, minority or underserved communities&#8221; before winding it down. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The bill mandates placement of a diversity czar in each federal financial agency  &mdash;  including the Fed and its 12 regional banks.</p>
<p>Establishing a so-called Office of Minority and Women Inclusion within each agency is the idea of Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters, a Congressional Black Caucus leader and conferee.</p>
<p>According to her amendment to the bill, &#8220;Each agency shall take affirmative steps to seek diversity in the workplace of the agency, at all levels of the agency,&#8221; including:</p>
<p>* Recruiting at &#8220;historically black colleges and Hispanic-serving institutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>* Recruiting in urban communities.</p>
<p>* Placing ads in African-American and Spanish newspapers.</p>
<p>* &#8220;Partnering with organizations that are focused on developing opportunities for minorities.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Each agency, in turn, is required to report to Congress detailed information describing the actions it took to diversify its staff and contract with minority-owned firms. Which means they&rsquo;ll do what their diversity officers advise. No official  &mdash;  particularly no regional Fed bank president  &mdash;  wants to be dragged before Barney Frank&rsquo;s panel and accused of racism.</p>
<p>Still, as insurance, the bill also calls for an audit of Fed &#8220;governance&#8221; to examine, among other things, &#8220;the extent to which the current system of appointing Federal Reserve bank directors effectively represents the public without discrimination on the basis of race, creed, color, sex or national origin.&#8221;</p>
<p>More, the bill sets up a data-collection system to monitor small-business loans for discrimination. Lenders will now be required to report if small-business applicants are minority-owned.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The bureau [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau] will wield a big stick in the form of an Office of Fair Lending and Equal Opportunity, whose role will be enforcing &#8220;nondiscriminatory access to credit.&#8221; It will have the power to subpoena witnesses and documents, as well as issue temporary orders requiring banks to cease and desist any practice.</p>
<p>They will add to and work with HUD&rsquo;s and Justice&rsquo;s own diversity cops. The bureau adds a massive new layer of bureaucracy to the four federal agencies already enforcing fair-lending compliance under the onerous CRA. Banks will now be under enormous political pressure to bend underwriting rules for protected classes with iffy credit.</p>
<p>The bureau, which is the White House&rsquo;s baby, will invite &#8220;experts in fair lending (and) civil rights,&#8221; as well as &#8220;representatives of communities that have been significantly impacted by higher-priced mortgage loans&#8221; to sit on a Consumer Advisory Board and consult on policy.</p>
<p>A research unit, meanwhile, will solicit data and &#8220;experiences&#8221; from urban housing activists about consumers in &#8220;underserved communities&#8221; who may have had access to &#8220;affordable credit&#8221; denied.</p>
<p>Over at HUD, a well-funded Office of Housing Counseling will collaborate with &#8220;community-based organizations&#8221; of Acorn&rsquo;s ilk to help minorities and &#8220;persons who face language barriers&#8221; secure credit and &#8220;preserve homeownership.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&hellip;&ldquo;underserved communities&rdquo; who may have had access to &ldquo;affordable credit&rdquo; denied.  This is code for providing credit to those on the margin at below market rates to be subsidized by the banks and their customers.  Access to credit is everywhere, banks, credit unions, payday lenders.  This issue is what is the risk to the lender and what do they have to charge to compensate for that risk.  Maxine Waters is a blatant racist who has nary a thought about economics.  Her performances in Congress, as seen on uTube, see her as foolish, ill informed, and perhaps a moron.  Sadly more poor people with access to credit will get hurt by the policy of lending to those who can&rsquo;t afford it, but with the twist that we taxpayers get to pay for it.  We have seen this movie before in only the last few years.  What does it take to show leadership and understanding of the fundamentals.  Ms. Waters has done immense harm.</p>

		<p>The dispossession is in full swing!</p>
<p>Notice all the radical, racial marxist politics that have been going on.</p>
<p>Obamacare was nothing more than taking from whites to give health care to blacks and latinos.</p>
<p>The stimulus money went mostly to urban (black and latino) areas.  Now that it&rsquo;s gone, they&rsquo;re going to raise taxes on whites to keep the money going.</p>
<p>Attorney General Eric Holder openly declares that whites are not covered under hate crimes legislation because we&rsquo;re not a &#8216;protected&rsquo; class.</p>
<p>The housing crisis was caused by bad loans to minorities who couldn&rsquo;t afford them, so now Barney and friends want white banks to fail while protecting black banks (I didn&rsquo;t even know there were any!)</p>
<p>Where do you think this is all headed?  Open your eyes and see ten, twenty, thirty years down the road with more and more of this.</p>
<p>You can by land in the country - they will bring in refugees from God knows where and plop them in your small town.</p>
<p>You can stockpile food - the hordes will break in.</p>
<p>You can buy gold and silver, the minute they find out you have it, they will raise your taxes for social justice intitiatives.</p>
<p>You can build a whiteopia any where you want, the Feds will bring suit after suit in court to &#8216;integrate&rsquo; you and bring in low income housing and diversity.</p>
<p>You can appeal to God and fairness, they will say you and all people like you are guilty of all the oppression that ever occured in the last 1,000 years.</p>
<p>You can pass away in sorrow and dream of your kids doing better than you - but they&rsquo;ve got your kids to adopt their culture and to hate themselves for who they are, so they will voluntarily seek someone &#8216;different&rsquo; to breed themselves out of existence.</p>
<p>Our only hope was space colonization, but Obama just killed NASA!</p>

		<p>Maxine Waters wants quotas to force banks to hire blacks and hispanics because were those groups to rely on talent alone the only jobs they could land at said banks would be as janitors. </p>

<p><br>
Is it really?  Ask yourself this&hellip;.how as any society reacted to such things in the entire history of humanity?</p>
<p>Our country was founded in reaction to such things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not dispossession.  Not with a country as well armed and educated as ours.  It&rsquo;s a prelude to a reaction.  And by my measure the reaction has picked up considerable steam.  Our country will probably be broken in two by it&hellip;.but it will be a prelude to full awakening of our race.  And remember how our race took over the entire world with fewer numbers and far less technology, in only a couple of generations.</p>
<p>Ten, twenty, thirty years from now won&rsquo;t be what you think it is.</p>

<p>- Not to be a killjoy. The only problem is that the powers that are attacking whites now have control of the switch for the internet, control over all communication devices and the most modern technology in warfare, ie. drones. Why do you think they have been GPS&rsquo;ing everything including everyone&rsquo;s home. Imagine what the King of England would have done with such technology when our founding fathers were just about to sign the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia, PA (39° 56′ 56″ N, 75° 9′ 0″ W)<br>

		<p>Confidence in the dollar is probably at an all-time low, and America has yet to emerge from a recession exacerbated by a financial collapse caused by easy credit.  What&rsquo;s the solution?  Why, restore easy credit to the very people who likely defaulted on their loans in the first place.  This is madness.</p>

		<p>To poster #4, I wish I could be optimistic, but the telling reality is in your statement: &#8220;with a country as well armed and educated as ours.&#8221;</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that 50% of said country is no longer well educated or of our racial makeup, and though many of them are armed, it is not to defend the constitution.  They will turn their arms on us, as they have been (read crime statistics) doing for many years now.  Even our diversity-conscious military is reaching a tipping point where the &#8216;original founding people&rsquo; are now becoming a minority.</p>
<p>Our kind are now minorities in nearly all major urban centers, and many suburbs and rural areas are falling also.  When we physically occupy only 20-30% of the land, what then?  Especialy since many of our own kind live in an avatar fantasy world of cheerful diversity and social justice, not recognizing the writing on the wall.</p>

<p>You forget that all of that fancy technology was built by Whites, and those who now wield it do not truly understand it, courtesy of the wrecking of the schools.  In short, &#8220;the most modern technology in warfare, ie. drones&#8221; isn&rsquo;t built by the military  &mdash;  those things are built by private contractors (who meet the DIEversity requirements by handing out sinecures and sticking Uncle Sam with the bill).  The people who actually design and build those things are White, and will likely be (due to location) among the first groups wiped out in an out-and-out race war.</p>
<p>Since both the hostile non-Whites and the most highly educated tend to concentrate in large cities, the outbreak of racial hostilities will claim many ivory-tower-cloistered lives  &mdash;  and with them much of our (any &#8220;our&#8221;) ability to wield even the advanced technology we have now.  Picture a future where electricity either has been forgotten entirely or is thought of as some kind of dark magic.  That is the type of world we are facing.</p>
<p>In short, &#8220;they&#8221; won&rsquo;t have all those nice toys for long after the long drop to the new Dark Age begins.  And yes, large scale ethnic strife in America will almost certainly lead to a new Dark Age.  Yes, that&rsquo;s bad.  No, I fear there may not be anything we can do about it anymore.  Yes, that is depressing.  No, I will not go on and on and on about it.</p>

		<p>Sounds like more sub-prime (aka bad) loans and redistribution  of the wealth that Obamasky has been spouting for the last couple of years.  My offer them credit if they know they can&rsquo;t pay it back?  Another BO scam with MY taxes.</p>
