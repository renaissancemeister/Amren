			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Justin Berton, San Francisco Chronicle, June 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There were half a million fewer whites in California in 2008 than in 2000, a period when the state&rsquo;s overall population grew by 4 million to 38.1 million, according to a study released Thursday by the state Department of Finance.</p>
<p>By 2008, whites made up 40 percent of Californians, down from 47 percent at the turn of the century. In 2000, Hispanics comprised 32 percent of the population; that number grew to 37 percent in 2008.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the first decade to see a year-over-year consistent population decrease due to natural causes,&#8221; said Mary Heim, chief of the Finance Department&rsquo;s demographic research unit.</p>
<p>The study also confirmed projections that a steadily growing Hispanic population will surpass whites as the state&rsquo;s largest racial demographic in 2016. Hispanics are expected to become a majority of all Californians in 2042, Heim said.</p>
<p>Most Bay Area counties reflected the state&rsquo;s shifting numbers  &mdash;  Alameda County, for example, dropped from 41 percent white to 36 percent  &mdash;  while showing spikes in Hispanic, Asian and multirace categories.</p>
<p>Yet, San Francisco&rsquo;s racial mix remained consistent. Forty-four percent of the city was white in 2008, 30 percent was Asian and 14 percent was Hispanic, just as it was in 2000. Only the city&rsquo;s African American population showed a slight decline, from 7 percent to 6 percent.</p>
<p><b>Below replacement level</b></p>
<p>The median age among California&rsquo;s whites is 44, while the median age for the Hispanic population is 28, according to the study.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Reverse of a trend</b></p>
<p>Johnson said migration into California was a national trend until the 1990s, when the number of out-of-state transplants began to decline.</p>
<p>Lower-paid California workers headed to cities like Phoenix, Las Vegas and Seattle, where they could make similar wages but pay less for housing.</p>
<p>&#8220;California is no longer attracting large numbers of people from other states,&#8221; Johnson said. &#8220;And a lot of those who did come to California from other states were white, reflecting the ethnic composition of the country as a whole.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The decline among whites and increase in other groups in California is a long-standing trend, Johnson said.</p>

		<p>Too bad for the rest of the states, but maybe a little bit good.</p>
<p>As Cali goes brown, the blacks will flee, but they will flee to us, which is a horrid fate.</p>
<p>But between now and then, we can watch Cali&rsquo;s &#8220;transformation&#8221; and take is as a warning, then prepare for the coming black wave.</p>
<p>God, wasn&rsquo;t America supposed to be better than this?</p>
<p><br>
Eisenhower, Warren, Johnson, and Kennedy are all to blame. How can we make sure their bloodlines suffer along with ours, and their posterity be as degraded as ours?<br>

		<p>Removing the illegal aliens and not renewing H1Bs and other work visas would go along way towards restoring the White demographics in the state.  Whites are still 65 percent of the voters in California.  </p>
<p>San Francisco, that great bastion of liberalism, is obviously practicing some kind of racial discrimination to keep the White population from sliding and the minority (especially the latino)population from rising.  I know those homosexuals and radical feminists aren&rsquo;t having children and I read the city has the largest dearth of children than any other large metro area in the country. </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s troubling about California is there appears to be few overwhelmingly White enclaves outside of the cities anymore.  Santa Monica, La Jolla and even Orange County are changing.  It seems as though not even alot of money can buy homogenity in California.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;By 2008, whites made up 40 percent of Californians, down from 47 percent at the turn of the century. In 2000, Hispanics comprised 32 percent of the population; that number grew to 37 percent in 2008.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yet for some strange reason, one that I just cannot grasp, we hear that California is going bankrupt?</p>
<p>&ldquo;California you may have heard is an apocalyptic mess of raging wildfires, soaring unemployment, mass foreclosures, and political paralysis. It&rsquo;s dysfunctional. It&rsquo;s ungovernable. It&rsquo;s bond rating is barely junk. It&rsquo;s so broke, it had to hand out IOUs while its leaders debated how many prisoners to release and parks to close.&rdquo;  (Why California Is still America&rsquo;s Future, Michael Grunwald, Time, November 2, 2009 pg. 28.)</p>
<p>How can this be?</p>
<p>Ironically, as is indicated by the title of Comrade Grunewald&rsquo;s &ldquo;article,&rdquo; all of the above is supposed to be a passing trend, and California will lead the USA into a happy and enriched future of diversity and technology. Funny, that now that whites are just &ldquo;one more minority&rdquo; there and Hispanics are shortly to be a majority, the place isn&rsquo;t the land of milk and honey, or even moonshine and hominy.</p>
<p>To me this doesn&rsquo;t sound as if California is the harbinger of America&rsquo;s future into an ultramodern and intergalactic renaissance, but instead into a myopic Third World dystopia.</p>
<p>But what do I know?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>I left California after living all my 60 years of life in 2007.<br>
I lived in a city, and a state that was  first world<br>
as late as 1970. Today, the 21st Century, the city I left is<br>
now plagued with crime, drugs, and gangs. It is no longer safe<br>
to walk the streets day, and night.<br>
With the coming majority Hispanic population, California,<br>
and every other place they take over, will become just like<br>
Mexico.</p>

		<p>As more whites move out and as Hispanics continue to overpopulate the place you&rsquo;ll see the fiscal problems of California continue to get worse.  When you move Mexico to California you wind up with Mexico.  Inevitably the federal government will bail out California, forcing the rest of us to pay for California&rsquo;s mistakes.</p>

		<p>When I lived in California it was a completely different world than it is today. Thank God I left in 1979 and decided not to stay though it nearly broke my heart at the time. I return often to see friends and family and realize that the state I had loved so much has become overwhelmed with taxes, debt, illegal aliens and anti everything I had ever believed in. There is only one reason for all these terrible happenings and that is the total dereliction of duty by the state and federal governments which I have come to utterly despise with equal fervor. Most white people who could favorably leave California for more fertile grounds have already done so and the exodus continues unabated. It breaks my heart to see what has happened to such a beautiful and alluring state. The land that nourished my youthful dreams has turned all of them into nightmare scenarios of white dispossession. </p>

		<p>I recall a prominent Hispanic racialist saying &#8220;California is going to be a Hispanic state. Anyone who doesn&rsquo;t like that should leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few weeks after he said it, Pres. Clinton awarded him the Medal of Freedom. This was in the late 1990s. I forget his name but it might have been Mario Obledo.</p>
<p>California - like South Africa - is lost forever and can only serve as a warning of what not to do if you want to live in a civilized society.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Hispanics to be California&rsquo;s largest racial group by 2016.&#8221;</p>
<p>The San Fracisco Chronicle couldn&rsquo;t tell us three years ago that we would suffer a financial collapse, yet they want us to believe they know what the demographs will be in 6 years?  In fact they refused to even call the situation a recession even after the economy dropped precipitously until at least a year afterward.</p>
<p>Since I came closer than they to forecasting what really occurred, let me give my very brief opinion on the situation in California in 2016:</p>
<p>The year is 2016.  It&rsquo;s been four years now since the worst of the depression hit.  It had been building since 2007.  The economy crashed in 08/09, in the US, and the economies dropped like dominoes all around the world.  </p>
<p>With the US situation deterioating consistently until mid 2010, when a slow but obvious further deterioration took place, it was apparent to most that the US was headed for an economic cliff.</p>
<p>But Europe was effected more so than the US, first in Latvia and then in other &#8220;Eastern Bloc&#8221; countries, like the Ukraine, Estonia, etc.  Then Greece had to be bailed out as part of a one trillion dollar donation from the EU, but not enough austere measures were taken and the money served only as a delaying tactic, just as the US stimulus money did in the US.</p>
<p>Spain fell next, then Portugal, then Ireland.  All the while the UK&rsquo;s debt to GDP ratio was worse even than any of the other countries. It stayed afloat for a bit longer by &#8220;monetizing&#8221; their debt, as the US did, and, like the US, another bubble was created this time called the &#8220;stimulus bubble.&#8221;  It too burst, and the UK and the US both went into full-fledged depression right along with the other countries. </p>
<p>Canada, Mexico, South America, China and India were terribly damaged although to a slightly lesser degree, except for Mexico which is now a narco-republic, controlled by the five drug cartels who have split into territories, with each cartel a separate state.  </p>
<p>But having millions more people, China and India had millions more incidents of chaos and violence and their societies, it is reported, will never recover to the strength before the final crash. Starvation and fighting are continuing right this minute.</p>
<p>And, oh, yes.  Hispanics ARE California&rsquo;s largest racial group this year (2016), but nobody is bragging because starvation and fighting in the streets began there also in 2012 between blacks and mestizos and hasn&rsquo;t stopped yet. </p>
<p>As soon as the remaining population dies from starvation, disease, or conflict, it really looks as if whites will be moving back in and starting over by 2018 or so, because they consisted of far greater numbers than any other group and they were far better prepared.  In fact, they just might not wait any longer and take control of the territory right away, deporting the remaining illegals there under the exact same law that was enacted in Arizona.</p>
<p>And the building that housed the San Francisco Chronicle now has a fruit and vegetable stand in its main lobby, run by an illegal alien with bandoliers of ammo cris crossing his chest and a box of hand grenades nearby.  He doesn&rsquo;t have any papers, so he&rsquo;s trying to earn what money he can hoping to leave for Mexico before the gringos return.</p>

		<p>Growing up in California, it was touted, first, the world&rsquo;s 5th largest economy, and then, subsequently, after the global economic decline, the world&rsquo;s 8th largest economy. Economic recovery or no, with the increase in the population of &#8220;Latinos&#8221;, there will only be a further slide in economic prowess.</p>
<p>But the tradeoff is that our crime numbers will inevitably increase.  Si se puede!</p>

		<p>When people take the time to write an article like this, I get the feeling that they really do care about the decline of the white population, and are genuinely concerned about it. Maybe they&rsquo;re just too scared to admit it? Maybe they&rsquo;re in denial. All I know is why make such a big deal about this if you don&rsquo;t care? Its only a matter of time before people &#8220;come out of the closet,&#8221; if you will. Our time will come again.</p>

		<p>Rest assured, fellow AR readers and fellow racially sane white men and women - liberals and the Cultural Marxist&rsquo;s who brought this demographic and racial death poison to California will NEVER shake the cobwebs out of their heads and admit they screwed up.   White liberals, on the one hand, NEVER admit that any of their miserably failed social and Utopian &#8216;engineering experiments&rsquo; has failed and made life unlivable for their fellow whites.  Hardcore Cultural Marxists, on the other hand, see what has happened to the late, great state of California and are sexually aroused by it - because it is a perfect measuring stick to use to prove that their grand scheme to destroy White, Western Civilization - which has probably used California as it&rsquo;s first test case - has succeeded beyond their wildest, anti-White, nation-wrecking dreams.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, not even the handful of elites who&rsquo;re a little on our side - Tom Tancredo, for example - ever breathe a word about the poison known as &#8216;Cultural Marxism&rsquo; or identify it and try to explain that it is The #1 Enemy and must be destroyed and overturned at all  costs.   Nope, Tancredo told Alan Colmes in February 2010 that if America became 35-40% &#8216;Hispanic&rsquo;, that would be A-OK with him, as long as they &#8216;assimilated&rsquo; (to what he neglected to specify), because he didn&rsquo;t &#8216;think in terms of race&rsquo;.    </p>
<p>Newsflash:  Western Civilization was the brain child of White people of Anglo-Saxon-Celtic EUROPEAN descent.   It is basically white culture gone to seed, Tommy boy.   It will NOT be sustained by a majority non-white America, so how about growing a pair and stop running away from the Race Issue?   Western Civilization is WORTH SAVING and WORTH FIGHTING FOR, Mr. Tancredo.   And, it is also worth taking a few arrows from the enemy who seeks it&rsquo;s destruction and putting them on the defensive for a change, and forcing these nation wrecking anti-white bigots to DEFEND their position.   </p>
<p>I say they can&rsquo;t, because their hate-filled agenda is based on a wish to genocide White European people.  I doubt that will sell, if the white couch potatoes ever wake up to what is really going on.  <br>

		<p>Whites in Atlanta are learning that they should trend toward falling below replacement levels.</p>
<p>Nice outing to the park turns into a dangerous and threatening frenzy, thanks to Atlanta&rsquo;s ever-present and majority Diversity Curse.  Atlanta paper calls it a &#8220;fracas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gunshots were fired. That&rsquo;s nothing more than a fracas.</p>
<p></p>

<p>&#8220;She was not seriously injured. Bythwood and her attackers are black, according to the police report.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;Her father, Charles Bythwood, said the recent high school graduate is &#8216;having a hard time dealing with this. It&rsquo;s been pretty traumatic for her.&rsquo; &#8220;</p>
<p><br>
Well, she did go to Piedmont Park. What did she expect.  And having a hard timing dealing with the Diveristy Curse shows that she isn&rsquo;t, or wasn&rsquo;t, a Race Realist. </p>
<p><br>
Josh Hice is the only hero- says it just like it is:</p>
<p>&#8220;It split my lip, then they start climbing all over my Jeep, and I turn around and my buddy is getting punched in the face and has blood pouring out of his nose,&#8221; said Hice, who thinks he and his friend were targeted by the black teens because they are white. &#8220;We were definitely victims of a hate crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s from Newman, so he couldn&rsquo;t possibly see a few &#8220;youths&#8221; just acting out without thinking it was a race riot.  Bigots from Newman always think that way.  If he spent more time in multicultural Atlanta, he would come to appreciate how much stronger and safer our vibrant Diversity makes Atlanta for all its citizens.</p>

		<p>1) It could also read the wealth makers are being overtaken by the wealth takers.  The fiscal issues plaguing California are in secular decline.  Yes it has been made worse by the recession.  But the outgoing macro economic tide is exposing the muck.<br>
2) They better figure out an affirmative action program for wealth producers as the state is rapidly getting to a tipping point where the deterioration accelerates non-linearly.  This could be the first state that shows the same tipping-point effect that Detroit, Newark, Camden and other welfare cities have suffered under.</p>

I was amazed to see a documentary on Mormon history a couple years ago when it featured a present day wedding between a gloriously pure looking white Mormon female and a black who looked as if he had just arrived from Africa.  If you go to Salt Lake City today it becomes obvious that it is the new hunting ground for non-white males out to capture a naive white girl, whose head is full of do-good religious motives.  <br>

<p>&#8220;What are they going to eat when whites are not producing food and handing it to them?</p>
<p>Rocks? Sand? California, outside the areas the white man has developed, is hard desert land.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; I can&rsquo;t believe all the really ignorant statements being made on this blog concerning California and the history of its conversion to a Hispanic majority.  First, California is at least 1/3 mountainous and with snow.  Second, the runoff from that snow produces a great deal of America&rsquo;s produce in one of the richest agricultural regions of the world.  Third, the way California was led to it present sad state of affairs was mismanagement by Republicans and exploitation of law by Democrats to pack the polls with new voters from places like Mexico that can be relied upon for Dem votes.  That is going on all over the country.</p>
<p>Hispanic lobbies, La Raza in particular made public promises as far back as the 1970s, that they would take over California, calling it a &#8220;Reconquesta,&#8221; ironically after the retaking of Spain from Muslims in 1492.  It was our federal democractic constitution as well as California&rsquo;s own constitution that was used against its citizens in affecting today&rsquo;s realities.  Of course it will collapse, just like Mexico is collapsing.  How can anyone imagine that parasites will become the hosts?  They will die when they have sucked the remaining blood out of us.  The same goes for China.</p>
<p>I would hope for a bit more of an intellectual grasp of the warning that California&rsquo;s demise provides for us.  Instead, so many Conservative Whites are merely engaging in bashing the state that has provided so much to the rest in the past.</p>
<p>We live in a Machiavellian world. Whites better wise up.<br>

		<p>Ranger, I only have one small quibble with your otherwise fine post:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;starvation and fighting in the streets began there also in 2012 between blacks and mestizos and hasn&rsquo;t stopped yet&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>When the black and mestizo welfare gravy train is cut off there will be violence, and lots of it  &mdash;  directed at Whites, whom they are being primed by the media and government schools to despise and attack. Whites are perceived by low IQd Third World parasites as the &#8216;haves&rsquo;   &mdash;  those who have kept them in poverty, locked away in ghettos, and are the source of all their misery.</p>
<p>Our biggest danger will come from roving black and hispanic gangs looking for women, booze, weapons and drugs. </p>
<p>Blacks and mestizos, primed by the PSM (propaganda-stream media) believe the world will be a better, more peaceful, less violent, more cooperative place once Whites are extinguished.  Little do they know what&rsquo;s in store for them once we are gone  &mdash;  I believe it will be akin to what happened after the Roman Empire fell:  900 years of savagery, butchery, starvation, murder and mayhem known as the Dark Ages.  </p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t have the slightest clue as to what has happened or how it happened, nor will they ever realize their cog-like role in the larger scheme.</p>
<p>Oh, surely they&rsquo;ll battle each other as well for food, alcohol and drugs; but The Prime Directive of the elites in power remains White genocide carried out by non-Whites.</p>
<p>Luke has it dead-on when he writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Meanwhile, not even the handful of elites who&rsquo;re a little on our side&hellip;ever breathe a word about the poison known as &lsquo;Cultural Marxism&rsquo; or identify it and try to explain that it is The #1 Enemy and must be destroyed and overturned at all costs&hellip;their hate-filled agenda is based on a wish to genocide White European people&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>Yes, exactly.  I only wish more understood this point instead of (as ghw writes)  &#8220;rail[ing] constantly against mexicans and blacks. They are attacking the leaves of the weed and ignoring the roots. They must be made aware that this is a wider, far more complex war that&rsquo;s being conducted against us, sub rosa, and that blacks and Mexicans don&rsquo;t even realize how they are being used to batter down white society&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Make no mistake about this.</p>
<p>Bon</p>

		<p>California cannot sustain 38 million people in the long term. Water infrastructure and the electrical grid were designed in the 1950&rsquo;s for no more than 25 million people and with CA&rsquo;s economic productivity taking a dive as whites leave   &mdash;   to be replaced by inferior human capital heavily dependent on government services   &mdash;   the utility infrastructure will never be upgraded. Indeed, the next round of major earthquakes will leave it critically compromised. Eventually water shortages and brownouts (pardon the pun) will drive out-migration of all races. CA is a desert, and absent an economically able, civic minded, and technically competent population, the tumbleweeds will bat last.</p>

		<p>Inevitably the federal government will bail out California</p>
<p><br>
I wouldn&rsquo;t be so sure of that.  Obama/Pelosi/Reid are the most radical leftists to ever be in power in the US, and they have refused to do it.  This time November, every single liberal up for election will come to understand that there is no longer a career for them in US politics&hellip;.anywhere, including the traditional bastions of liberalism.  The US has moved from a just right of center country to a far right country.  The next two elections will reveal the extent of this.</p>
<p>Many people love to make comments to the effect that whites/white liberals will never admit what their beliefs amount to.  I challenge that.  And offer this November&rsquo;s elections as proof that is, at best, bitterness by white nationalists over shoddy treatment in the past, and, at worst, propaganda spread by communist agents at the behest of a hostile foriegn power.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d name the country, but my post wouldn&rsquo;t be allowed on Amren then.  Suffice it to say, it used to be the Soviet Union that waged war this way&hellip;..but those people moved to another country when the cold war ended and russia became the much smaller country it is today.  It&rsquo;s important to understand that these are the same exact, specific people, that have been using the exact same, specific, racial tactics, to cause us harm&hellip;..but they&rsquo;ve moved to a different country.</p>

		<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;By 2008, whites made up 40 percent of Californians, down from 47 percent at the turn of the century&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe a thing this marxist rag prints.</p>
<p>The White population of California is lower than 40%</p>
<p>Or course, the definition of White keeps changing  &mdash;  while other ethnic groups, such as Asians, are demanding that THEY be separated into various Asian factions.</p>
<p>For example, I recently gave the required California state tests.  On the answer sheet, students are mandated to &#8216;bubble in&rsquo; their demographic information in one or as many racial groups as they desire  &mdash;  Decline to State is no longer an option.</p>
<p>Here is the state&rsquo;s exact definition of White:   &#8220;Having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East or North Africa.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Asians?  The following categories are provided:  &#8220;Asian Indian, Cambodian, Chinese, Filipino, Guamanian, Hmong,  Japanese,  Korean,  Laotian,  Native Hawaiian,  Samoan, Tahitian, Vietnamese.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seems the Chinese and Japanese got tired of being lumped in with Samoans, Guamanians and Native Hawaiians.  A few years ago there was one category for Asians and  Pacific Islanders, i.e., &#8220;Asians or Pacific Islander.&#8221; I imagine the inclusion of PI test scores with E. Asians lowered the &#8216;Asian&rsquo; group score quite a bit.</p>
<p>Yet we Anglo-Saxon, Celtic Whites are put together in one category with N. Africans and Middle Easterners.</p>
<p>I believe this is done by the state to cover up how few Celtic Whites are left in California.   And, as we have had a huge influx recently of ethno-centric Armenians, Iranians, Syrians, Egyptians and those from the former Soviet Union, these recent arrivals are used to prop-up White numbers  &mdash;  although there are rumblings from Middle Eastern advocates that they no longer wish to be lumped with us Whites.</p>
<p>They well realize that we are at the bottom of the heap for government favors and handouts and openly discriminated against via AA preferences and quotas, and they want no part of it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;White liberals, on the one hand, NEVER admit that any of their miserably failed social and Utopian &lsquo;engineering experiments&rsquo; has failed and made life unlivable for their fellow whites&#8221;. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because they are afraid to say they care what happens to white. They&rsquo;re probably afraid to care at all. That&rsquo;s because they are afraid of the edicts of the &#8216;cultural marxists&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Reading the majority of responses in the article gives me some hope that Whites are finally realizing they&rsquo;ve been asleep for way too long.  There&rsquo;s more than a few people stressing the need for an endless supply of cheap labor and constant population growth to keep our economy growing.  These people won&rsquo;t be satisfied till every inch of space in this country is paved over or developed.  This type of economic model is unsustainable and needs some serious modifications.  I&rsquo;m a capitalist at heart but if capitalism is leading us down the road to a future Mexican Haitian hybrid nation ruled by a small White elite with the rest of us sacrificed to diversity, I&rsquo;d be in favor of chucking it.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s a case of self preservation for them.  Liberals have been playing minorities against Whites, forming rainbow alliances, voting against the interests of their own people for power and placing them in a position that now makes them a threat.  In these bad economic times with California slashing budgets, if it comes down to cutting welfare for illegals or cutting their own cushy state job, which choice are they going to make?  Mexicans and blacks are not liberals and they only play lip service to liberalism because it&rsquo;s the only game in town for them.  If the Mexicans take over the state government, are they going to care about not using plastic bags, banning offshore drilling, environmentalism, limiting growth or gay rights?  No. They&rsquo;re going to do whatever it takes to consolidate power and make a quick buck for their cash strapped state.</p>

		<p>#33, well of course infinite growth on a finite planet is not sustainable. I have to laugh at each and every population projection from the census. World oil extraction has been plateaued for 5 years now. By 2050 we&rsquo;ll have seen peak oil, peak natural gas, peak uranium, and likely even peak coal. I am still waiting on a viable battery that can be easily manufactured for an electric car, unfortunately technology is not magic.</p>
<p>Why do you think we have an ecological catastrophe in the GOM? Domestic oil production peaked in 1970 and has been declining ever since, we have run out of easily accessible oil in the U.S.</p>
<p>I really wonder what the true value of something such as gold will be in 2050 and whether or not the U.S. even exists as a political entity. Will people still be using fiat currency with pictures of Washington and Lincoln?</p>

<p>Bon, you are absolutely right.  I live in West Los Angeles 3 blocks from the Little Teheran shopping and restaurant area.  The Persians are becoming the majority in the area.  The joke is that they landed in Beverly Hills 30 years ago and are marching west towards the sea. First Beverly Hills, then West Los Angeles and soon Santa Monica and Pacific Palisades</p>
<p>The Persians know full well that they are Whites.  Basically European Whites who migrated from what is now know as Russia to south central Asia 7 thousand years ago.  But they are high IQ, high earning, ambitious people.</p>
<p>The younger generation in particluar are sick and tired of being rejected for college, scholarships and jobs because they have to put down White on applications.  Also 2 generations of Persians have gone through the LAUSD school system and had to sit there and hear about how Whites (themselves) are evil monsters responsible for all the evils in the world. And if they were not lucky to live in Beverly Hills they went to school with horrible thuggish blacks and browns and know what they are like. Hamilton, University, Venice and Santa Monica High are not all that different from Jordan and other all black and brown high schools.</p>
<p>So many of the middle eastern and s central asian Whites would like to get re classified as some sort of non White to escape the horrible discrimination and racism mandated against Whites by our goverment.  </p>
<p>I know a lot of Persians and it is a constant topic of conversation, especially the younger ones who get their degrees and would like to move into the mainstream.  They don&rsquo;t want to run dry cleaners and other sleazy little immigrant businesses. They want good, prestigious clean professional careers.   But they can&rsquo;t get hired because of racism against Whites.</p>
<p>By the way, how can I afford the high cost of living in West Los Angeles, not only the high cost of housing but the high cost of everything else from gas to food to auto repair?</p>
<p>I lied on a job application 23 years ago.  After being turned down for a good job at a university for 2 years in a row I simply applied again and checked Afro American in the race box.</p>
<p>2 days after turning the application in I got a call.  Not come in for an interview but when can you come in for training and orientation and to fill out the tax and other HR forms.</p>
<p>Sauve qui peut is French for save yourself if you can.  That&rsquo;s all Whites can do.  Nothing will help us.</p>
