Immigration Law Makes Census Count Tougher</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Haya El Nasser, USA Today, June 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fear, mistrust, anger. The immigration law approved by the Arizona Legislature last month requires police to determine a person&rsquo;s immigration status if they&rsquo;re stopped, detained or arrested and there is &#8220;reasonable suspicion&#8221; they&rsquo;re here illegally. {snip}</p>
<p>Whatever its future, the law could not have come at a worse time for the 2010 Census.</p>
<p>The once-a-decade government count of every person in the USA began in March with a giant mail-out. Seventy-two percent of U.S. households responded by mail  &mdash;  67% in Arizona and 64% in Santa Cruz County. On May 1  &mdash;  eight days after the immigration law was signed into law  &mdash;  635,000 Census workers nationwide started going door-to-door to every home that did not send back the forms. They will return up to six times until they get answers to the 10 questions on the form.</p>
<p>In Arizona, many civic groups fear the new law will discourage cooperation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve talked to friends and people in the community, and they&rsquo;re saying  &mdash;  whatever they think of the law, wherever they stand on the issue: &#8216;I&rsquo;m not going to open the door to anyone right now,&rsquo;&#8221; says Tucson City Councilor Regina Romero, who represents largely Hispanic neighborhoods.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many don&rsquo;t realize that the law won&rsquo;t take effect until July, when Census workers will be done knocking on doors, Cummings says. &#8220;We&rsquo;re telling people what the process is, that confidentiality still holds, that Census workers are not police officers and are not looking to report anybody.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Outreach to kids</b></p>
<p>A week before the school year ends, local officials are making a last-ditch effort to tout participation in the Census through schoolchildren who can carry the message home to their parents.</p>
<p>As students gather for morning assembly on the Pena Blanca school&rsquo;s outdoor plaza, many sporting colorful hats and hair in honor of Spirit Week, the Pledge of Allegiance and birthday greetings are followed by speeches stressing the importance of cooperating with Census workers.</p>
<p>&#8220;How many of you saw your parents fill it out and mail it?&#8221; shouts Democratic County Supervisor Rudy Molera. &#8220;It&rsquo;s really important that it counts everybody .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. little people like yourselves.&#8221; Figueroa tells them the school will get the balls and jump ropes it so desperately needs thanks to the Census.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When the law was passed, &#8220;I was sitting here going, &#8216;Oh great. What&rsquo;s going to happen?&rsquo;&#8221; says Paul Fimbres, manager of the Tucson [Census] office that oversees many counties along the border.</p>
<p>He has a contingency plan for areas tough to penetrate: &#8220;In case that happens, we blitz,&#8221; Fimbres says. &#8220;We send 15 or 20 people or teams of two or maybe three.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>An economic hit</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Undocumented people in the county are fearful and suspicious,&#8221; says Mary Dahl, director of community development for the county and head of its Census committee. &#8220;The timing of everything seems to be bad for the Census.&#8221;</p>

<p>Undocumented people (i.e., illegal immigrants) shouldn&rsquo;t be counted in the census at all.  Illegal immigrants should not get represented in the House of Representatives.  So I&rsquo;m glad they&rsquo;re fearful.  I&rsquo;d be happier if they were deported.</p>

<p>Please! Spare us! What kind of nonsense is this?</p>
<p>Only our fellow Whites are conditioned enough to obey the government like obedient slaves day after day and yield to their intimidation tactics. Hispanics, Blacks, and Muslims are content to hide in the shadows and ignore the nonsense. They have nothing to lose and nothing to fear. Only Whites fear the rod of the government, unfortunately. When will our people wake up?</p>
<p>May God have mercy on us!<br/>

<p>Any &#8220;Undocumented people&#8221; in any county in this country should ALWAYS be &#8220;fearful and suspicious&#8221;.  Since when is it incumbent on any Federal, State, or local government entity to promote or otherwise make accommodations to people who really shouldn&rsquo;t be enjoying comfort (physical or psychological) here to begin with?  And since when is it incumbent on the Arizona State legislature to &#8220;time&#8221; its actions to make things smoother for The Census Bureau during its decennial door knocking campaign?  Most of them had their bilingual chance with The Census Bureau at their own mailbox anyway.</p>

<p>Gross material misstatement of facts Mr. El Nasser on two counts:</p>
<p>1-Census enumerators will only make 3 personal front door knocking visits at non-respondent dwellings. The other 3 attempts to enumerate have to be by some other means. (try to call residents on phone, interview neighbors, landlord, or other &#8220;knowledgeable&#8221; respondent either by phone or in person) </p>
<p>2-Only a certain select 3 of the 10 questions have to be answered on the EQ form for it to be considered complete.</p>
<p><br/>
Are we to surmise that this is the quality of reporting/editing from MSM H1-B visa holder reporters that we should be content with Mr. El Nasser and USA Today management?<br/>

		<p>Illegals will be counted in the censue. I used to work for the Census Bureau. If someone doesn&rsquo;t answer, a census employee will go to their door. They can&rsquo;t ask if they are illegal. All the census worker needs are 3 thing, number of people in residence, sex and race. If they absoulutely can&rsquo;t get these, then they&rsquo;ll go to the neighbors or landlord to get them. So yes, illegals will get counted as &#8220;Americans&#8221;. At least a lot of them will.</p>

Where in the Constitution are sex and race data required for the census? What is required is a head count.</p>

		<p> It&rsquo;s wrong to count illegals, but they do it anyway - a poke in the eye so to speak.</p>
