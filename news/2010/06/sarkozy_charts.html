			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AFP, June 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>France and Africa opened new venues for cooperation on Tuesday to reshape global diplomacy, boost trade, battle climate change and fight pirates.</p>
<p>At a two-day summit in the Riviera city of Nice, France shifted its focus away from its traditional west African allies and engaged with the continent as a whole, reaching out to economic powerhouses South Africa and Nigeria.</p>
<p>&#8220;This summit is a new step,&#8221; Sarkozy told reporters after meeting with the 38 African leaders for his first Africa-France summit since taking office in 2007.</p>
<p>The French president waded into the heated debate over United Nations reform, backing Africa&rsquo;s call for more seats at the Security Council and also a voice at the Group of 20 club of rich economies.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can we accept a world where 25 percent of the population lives in Africa and yet it does not have a permanent seat at the Security Council?&#8221; Sarkozy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an anomaly, an injustice and a source of imbalance,&#8221; said the president who pledged to push for change to give Africa more of a say, in particular when France takes the helm of the G20 next year.</p>
<p>Describing global governance as a &#8220;critical point&#8221; for Africa, South African President Jacob Zuma said leaders had agreed to discuss at their next African Union summit a French proposal to seek two Security Council seats with 10-year mandates.</p>
<p>That would be an intermediary step on the way to satisfying Africa&rsquo;s long-standing demand for two permanent Security Council seats with veto powers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot have institutions that were established in the 1940s, when there were fewer countries and colonialism,&#8221; said Zuma.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those rules are outdated.&#8221;</p>
<p>While global governance topped Africa&rsquo;s list of demands, France put strong emphasis on economic ties, inviting more than 200 French and African heads of companies to the summit.</p>
<p>The push on the economic front comes as France has taken a back seat to China, Africa&rsquo;s biggest trade partner, which has injected billions over the past decade to tap into raw materials needed to fuel its hungry economy.</p>
<p>French oil giant Total, nuclear behemoth Areva and other firms launched a solar power project for southern Africa to generate badly-needed electricity with state-of-the-art French technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;France has technology and we can put it to good use for Africa, instead of having aid budgets that never fulfil their promise,&#8221; Sarkozy said.</p>
<p>No figures were released on new French investments but Sarkozy made clear that France was back in force on the trade front.</p>
<p>&#8220;France and Africa are overflowing with projects,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Talks also touched on climate change, with Africa and France calling on developing countries to make good on their promises of 30 billion dollars in aid, made at the Copenhagen summit in December.</p>
<p>Part of the funds are earmarked for battling deforestation in the Congo basin, home to the world&rsquo;s second largest rainforest after the Amazon of Brazil.</p>
<p>Africa is &#8220;not the cause nor the victim of climate change,&#8221; said Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, Africa&rsquo;s negotiator on climate change, adding that he had yet to see the funds promised at Copenhagen.</p>
<p>France also pledged to help Africa combat piracy, terrorism and drug trafficking, with Sarkozy stressing that Africa &#8220;cannot cope on its own.&#8221;</p>
<p>East African countries do not have the naval forces needed to eradicate piracy from Somalia&rsquo;s coastal waters, he said while lamenting the &#8220;terrorism that is poisoning the Sahel region.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Sarkozy is the ultimate Neo Conservative&hellip;</p>
<p>Gets elected on a tough program of ending Arab, Black African crime, riots in slum suburbs of French cities.</p>
<p>In office he fakes to the right, goes Left, one day being a patriotic French leader, the next day putting out plans to unit both sides of the Med Sea in some enterprise zone.</p>
<p>Now he is for Africa&hellip;., the Third World&hellip; just not the third world folks in Gaza.</p>
<p>Make this guy some UN aide worker in the worst Black slums in the New South Africa&hellip; love to see the locals to on to him what they did to Amy Biehl.</p>

		<p>South Africa is an economic powerhouse?</p>
<p>I guess hyper-inflation, the death of one&rsquo;s agricultural sector-from seizing White-owned farms, near-complete de-industrialization, and uncontrollable violent crime really are good signs of a Global Power-economic powerhouse!</p>

		<p>Those permanent seats on the Security Council are a reflection of the world as it was in 1945. A world that no longer is. This is true. And the suggestions, among them, to restructure the permanent Security Council seats often suggest that EUROPE as a whole should have only one seat [Britain and France now each have one].</p>
<p>And Africa should have a seat? I suppose South America should then have one too? All of sudden, then everybody will want a permanent seat! I assume the Colonel, what-is-his-name, in Libya, will represent Africa so well. YES, there you are.</p>

		<p>Permanent UN security council seats should be reserved for countries with Global influence. Germany, Japan, India, Brazil deserve seats. Sub-Saharan Africa on the other hand has nothing to offer, no money, no technology, no economy, basically nothing except AIDS, war, crime and destruction. So why do they deserve a Permanent UN security council seat?</p>

		<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a great idea&hellip;&hellip;giving black nations permanent seats on the Security Council.  That will pretty much ensure that debates become like Detroit or Cincinnati City Council free for alls, and ensure the work product will be similar to those well run cities.  Maybe the can start with Somalia and Nigeria - two well run black countries known for never breaking the law, and for providing safe and secure environments within their borders and in their national waters.</p>

		<p>Why are the sick elites of the West obsessed with Africa and black people in general. We should create as much distance as possible between Whites and blacks, not engage with them in any way. Because in any such engagement White people will end up as the losers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can we accept a world where 25 percent of the population lives in Africa and yet it does not have a permanent seat at the Security Council?&rdquo; Sarkozy said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well Mr. Sarkozy, blacks were once an insignificant part of humanity and always have been before now. Thanks to White invented medicine and White imposed hygiene their numbers have swollen. Blacks keep on reproducing while Whites limit their own fertility due to several reasons one of them being that Europeans and Americans are taxed so that food aid can be sent to Africa. So White people have to pay for their benevolence and must keep on paying it seems. How fair is that?</p>
<p>As I had said before whenever Whites and blacks come in contact with each other, Whites will always come out as losers.<br>

<p>By, Golly - Anonymous - you might have inadvertently stumbled onto the real motivation behind Sarkozy&rsquo;s idea!    Historically, and there have been exactly ZERO exceptions to this rule - any civilization created by European people anywhere on Earth which has imported large numbers of Africans and then given those Africans an equal voice, or an artificially created superior or authoritative voice, over the structure and day-to-day operations of that European created nation, and who have also allowed African influence to assume dominance - that European nation has always been destroyed and has collapsed - as a First World nation.   </p>
<p>Sarkozy and his fellow kinsmen are fully aware of this historical truth - and they understand that the way to kill White Western Civilization is to place Blacks into positions of authority and influence over Western nations.   Then, stand back, and let nature take its course.  Sarkozy is a Cultural Marxist, which means he is virulently anti-white and anti-Western.     </p>
<p>Remember what this man said?   I&rsquo;d bet that Sarkozy remembers this quote, and probably has it framed on the wall of his office - as an inspiration.  </p>
<p>&#8220;For whenever a white man seeks to live among them (blacks) as their equals they will either destroy him or devour him. And they will destroy all of his work. Never fraternize with them as equals. Never accept them as your social equals or they will devour you. They will destroy you.&#8221;  ~ Albert Schweitzer, Recipient of the 1952 Nobel Peace Prize. &#8221; </p>

		<p>Go ahead. Give the Africans a seat on the security council.</p>
<p>Then shut it all down. </p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if Africa&rsquo;s on the security council if there is no security council because there is no UN.</p>
<p>Who needs the UN?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but the UN hasn&rsquo;t done diddly-squat for me lately  &mdash;  except drain off some of my tax money.</p>
<p>The UN is run by a bunch of globalists, former Communists, sleazy bankers and characters like Obama.</p>
<p>Get rid of the UN. Tear the building down and salt the ground so nothing will ever grow there again. </p>

Two pulls from the article, just a couple of sentences apart, both using the term &#8220;global governance.&#8221;:</p>
<p>Describing global governance as a &ldquo;critical point&rdquo; for Africa, South African President Jacob Zuma said leaders had agreed to discuss at their next African Union summit a French proposal to seek two Security Council seats with 10-year mandates.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>While global governance topped Africa&rsquo;s list of demands, France put strong emphasis on economic ties, inviting more than 200 French and African heads of companies to the summit.</p>
<p><br>
These are confusing statements   &mdash;   especially regarding exactly what is meant by &#8220;global governance.&#8221; I understand that this is an Associated <i>Foreign</i> Press, translating what was originally said in French, so I&rsquo;m aware that something may have got lost crossing the Atlantic. So further research is needed to fully understand how &#8220;global governance topped Africa&rsquo;s list of demands.&#8221; Does this mean that what Zuma would like most is for South Africa   &mdash;   or perhaps ALL of Africa   &mdash;   to be put under the care of some sort of world body that would come to their rescue and fix all their screw-ups? An arrangement by which the West would be permanently on the hook paying to rescue Africa from their self-inflicted wounds (I mean more than we already are)?</p>
<p>Is that what&rsquo;s being said here? Because if it is, we need to nip that idea in the bud. If Sarkozy really wants that, he&rsquo;s something worse than a neo-con, he&rsquo;s an evil lunatic. </p>
<p>But then, anybody who considers Nigeria an &#8220;economic powerhouse&#8221; is already a lunatic. </p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Well, in African terms   &mdash;   given its huge population (by far the largest in Africa) and its petroleum income   &mdash;    it is. </p>
<p>Somebody above  [#2] also voiced the same scepticism  about South Africa, and the answer is the same:  in African terms it most definitely is a &#8220;power house&#8221;.  It may now be less so than it was; but with its&rsquo; 4 1/2 million whites, it is still THE economic power house of Africa.</p>
<p>As for Sarkozy&rsquo;s mental state, I can&rsquo;t speculate, but he clearly does not have the interests of France (or the people of Europe) at heart. He is a cosmopolitan and follows a different drummer. He is one of those who thrive on Diversity   &mdash;   so long as it does not touch HIS family. But it&rsquo;s a great idea for YOURS!</p>

		<p>ghw, </p>
<p>But, the problem is Sarkozy apparently wants Nigeria and South Africa to have permanent UN Security Council Seats-which belong only to the World&rsquo;s Global Superpowers, not countries with relative strength for their respecitve regions.</p>
<p>A UN Security Council Seat for a plummetting economy in a nation with poor enforcement of laws agaisnt violent crime. And, South Africa confiscates White farms, for new Black owners. </p>
<p>If we give UN Security Council Seats to Nigeria and South Africa, why not South Korea, Taiwan, India, Brazil, Japan, Germany, Russia, Italy, and perhaps Mexico?</p>

		<p>Nigeria isn&rsquo;t an &#8220;economic powerhouse&#8221;; the only thing that has the (massively corrupt) economy there functioning at all is oil exports.  The locals do not manufacture this oil; it&rsquo;s only there as an accident of geology.  Without oil, Nigeria&rsquo;s main economic activity would be 419 scams.</p>
<p>Sarkozy might be evil, as ghw wrote above, but he&rsquo;s certainly a lunatic, and should probably be institutionalized.  Does France have involuntary civil committal laws?</p>
