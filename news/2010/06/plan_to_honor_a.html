<h1>Plan to Honor &#8220;Anglo&#8221; Lawyers at Alamo Refused</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>statesman.com, June 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Remember the Anglo lawyers! The State Bar of Texas had hoped do to so with a plaque on Alamo Plaza, but the city&rsquo;s historic commission has refused to approve the plan, citing concerns about singling out a profession or ethnicity for honor near the famed landmark.</p>
<p>The proposed 27-by-42-inch marker to honor the contributions of early &#8220;Anglo American lawyers&#8221; to Texas&rsquo; independence was approved by the state and county historical commissions, but members of the San Antonio Historic and Design Review Commission on Wednesday voted down the plan.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The text, which likely would be edited by the state historic commission, credits the Anglo lawyers in Texas with understanding the importance of constitutional government and pays tribute to the lawyers who &#8220;led opposition to tyranny in ways other than fighting.&#8221; It also notes that six lawyers, including commander William B. Travis, died in the battle at the Alamo.</p>
<p>Jones said the state bar has honored Hispanic and black lawyers in history but wants to acknowledge the contributions of white lawyers, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;We certainly try to be inclusive,&#8221; Jones said.</p>

		<p>I think this is a &#8220;false flag&#8221; operation. It attacks our interests in two ways. By the way, I`m talking about &#8220;approving&#8221; the plaque, not disavowing it. If approved, it creates two new precedents. The first, is that other groups besides the DRT (Daughters of the Republic of Texas) will have a reason to toot their own horn. Which only weakens the authority of the actual descendents to control what goes on near the Alamo. Think Mosque at 9-11. <br>
  The other is that outside groups that had nothing to do with the battle will now have their opening to &#8220;Celebrate&#8221; their &#8220;Contribution&#8221; to winning Texas Independence. Like Black Mule drivers or Chicano flour grinders. Soon you will be hearing how their efforts are what turned the tide&hellip; Don`t believe it and don`t back the plaque in Alamo Plaza. It`s just a battering ram to break down the traditionalists&hellip;<br>

		<p>Being &#8220;inclusive,&#8221; as that term commonly is used today, DOESN&rsquo;T mean including Whites - just as &#8220;diversity&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t mean including Whites, &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t mean including Whites, etc. The self-loathing of the modern White race shall go down in history as the most nakedly suicidal ideology ever to infect the heads of mankind!      </p>

		<p>Well, we all know that words like &#8220;diversity&#8221; and &#8220;inclusiveness&#8221; are just Orwellian newspeak for discrimination against whites.</p>

<p> - -   Everything we do to memorialize our history and heritage is being attacked by every other group.  If it&rsquo;s like this now, what is going to happen in the future?  Are we going to become a &#8220;hated and hunted&#8221; minority?</p>

		<p>More hypocritical leftists, denying the achievements of whites while at the same time uplifting every &#8220;Gender, race, color, creed, nationality, persuasion, and sexual preference&#8221; in the world - everyone except normal white people, that is.</p>

		<p>It is unlawful to honor those who established the state of Texas because it will offend Mexicans, or Mexican sympathizers.  This is the definition of cowardice, and it is being performed in the same city where a few white men held out for 13 days against a mighty Hispanic army.  The irony and political message is obvious.</p>

		<p>I agree with post #4. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not against honoring Anglo anything, but it should be done in an appropriate way. The focus of the Alamo needs to be on the actual fighting. </p>
<p>The &#8220;led opposition to tyranny in ways other than fighting&#8221; stuff looks like a message to seriously down play the importance of the Alamo. Break the Anglo fighting spirit. Looks like New World Order propaganda to me. Is the message here don&rsquo;t fight the current invasion, just go to court?      </p>

		<p>I also agree with number 4.  I&rsquo;d NOT be in favor of ANY plaque that calls us ANGLOS.<br>
That&rsquo;s what the mestizos call us as a derogatory name.  We are not anglos.  We are WHITE.  We are AMERICANS.  Also as said, if this plaque goes up, then it won&rsquo;t be long before the Gays claim rights to a plaque (as they did at Independence Hall) claiming Travis was gay or some such nonsense, and all sorts of other professions or trades do likewise - camp followers (prostitutes), mule drivers, black butlers, whatever.  One plaque only is needed- honoring those who died and fought in the Alamo.  Period.</p>

		<p>Honoring lawyers at the Alamo? Well, umm, I guess it was an honorable profession at one time, though the plaintiffs bar has since rendered the practice of law perhaps the most despicable and parasitic form of &#8220;employment&#8221; ever devised.</p>
<p>Lawyers are without question the largest single drain on American productivity and prosperity.  Yes, there are &#8220;good&#8221; lawyers, though their main function is to defend against the depredations and outrages committed by the rest.</p>
<p>Shakespeare&rsquo;s remark, &#8220;Kill all the lawyers,&#8221; is all the more appropriate today.  Honoring them at the Alamo is a moral outrage.</p>
