<h1>Lemaricus Davidson Gets 80 More Years in Torture-Slaying Case</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jim Balloch, Knoxville News Sentinel, June 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Davidson [Lemaricus Davidson] is already under two death sentences for the 2007 murders of Christian, a 21-year-old University of Tennessee senior, and her boyfriend, Christopher Newsom, 23. He was back in Knox County Criminal Court to be sentenced on the other charges related to the crimes.</p>
<p>Judge Richard Baumgartner sentenced Davidson to 80 years on a variety of charges, including especially aggravated robbery, especially aggravated kidnapping and especially aggravated rape. {snip}</p>
<p>The judge ordered the 80 years to be served consecutively to the death penalties, and, in a move that he said was probably unprecedented, took the step of ordering that the death sentences be consecutive.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This is one of the most incredibly outrageous, cruel and inhumane cases this court has ever seen,&#8221; Baumgartner remarked. &#8220;How people can engage in this type of conduct is just unexplainable.&#8221;</p>
<p>The judge also said it was clear that Davidson was the ringleader of the group responsible for the crime and has no regard for human life.</p>
<p>&#8220;There really is no sentence great enough to punish you for the conduct you have been convicted of,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Davidson&rsquo;s half brother, Letalvis Cobbins, and Cobbins&rsquo; friend George Thomas are serving life sentences with no chance of parole. Cobbins&rsquo; girlfriend, Vanessa Coleman, convicted of facilitating some of the crimes against victim Christian, is scheduled to be sentenced July 30.</p>

		<p>He will live the life of a celebrity in jail.<br>
He has nothing more to worry about, his food, rent and housing is SET for life. He will continue his violent ways and will make friends in the showers, all on OUR tax dollars. All while the victims families still mourn their loss.<br>
Isnt the justice system grand?</p>

		<p>And as usual the MSM is deathly silent.  When the dragging death of a Black man took place some years ago and the Whites that were convicted of the crime were sentenced I distinctly recall the Nightly News making a big deal out of it.  But of course, there will be silence here.  I also recall the months and years of media attention to the Columbine murders (two &#8220;evil White&#8221; kids) but it&rsquo;s rather strange that an Oriental named Cho murdered 33 people - almost 3 times as many as the Columbine massacre - and most recently a mad Muslim Army &#8220;Psychiatrist&#8221; (should be &#8220;Psycho&#8221;) shot 43 people and we haven&rsquo;t heard a peep from the media since. </p>
<p>The planned destruction of the White Race continues.</p>

<p>&lsquo;There really is no sentence great enough to punish you for the conduct you have been convicted of,&rsquo; he said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this day and age, and I really hate writing this, we have to give Judge Richard Baumgartner kudos and applause. He is seemingly doing what the system allows him to do, and with the most forceful intent toward justice permitted as well. Certainly, I agree with all of the above who feel that these sentences are too greatly circumspect; however, they are far more than I expected, for these Mau Mauing &ldquo;youths&rdquo; who committed these anti-white atrocities. </p>
<p>Sometimes, the glass is really half full; this seems to be one of them.</p>
<p>However, I would be both derelict and wretched, if I did also still not make my<br>
characteristic, and here sadly understated point on this issue: God Help Us All!!!</p>

		<p>Davidson was also sentenced to death. This additional sentence will at least keep him in prison if his death sentence is ever commuted, is my understanding.</p>

		<p>I wonder why TV personality Bill O&rsquo;Reilly never has mentioned the trial and sentences of these thugs who raped and murdered these two beautiful white kids, Channon Christian and Chris Newsom? Mr. O&rsquo;Reilly bills himself as a &#8216;culture warrior&rsquo; but like most of these neoconservative talking heads, i.e., Beck, Hannity, never reported on these ghastly murders.  It is obvious that they are manipulated by someone and are under orders not to veer too far from the script.</p>

		<p>A very elderly, fully alert family member, who watches a lot of TV, tells me that he never heard of the Knoxville Horror or Witchita Massacre and doesn&rsquo;t even recognize the circumstances of the crimes.  Yet when a group of white trash criminals in southern WV were accused of kidnapping, raping, and basically giving the Tawana-Brawley treatment to a young black woman, the MSM never let up  &mdash;  until, that is, it was ascertained that the accuser was the retarded girlfriend of one of the accused.  The local papers continued to cover the story, but the big boys dropped it like a hot potato.  They did the same with the VA Tech massacre, claiming too much attention should not be given to such a heinous crime  &mdash;  that was committed by an Asian, obviously, and, according to at least one tabloid, by a man who patronized gay bars.  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s truly a pity that we don&rsquo;t have a graduated series of execution types, to be applied depending on the level of perversity, cruelty, and evil displayed in the commission of capital crime.  In the case of monsters such as Davidson, the appropriate penalty would be burning at the stake by slow fire. Certainly, if it was good enough for heretics such as Joan of Arc in the Middle Ages it&rsquo;s really too good for the likes of Davidson.</p>

		<p>The truth is, this murderer and all of his co-defendants deserve to  hang together, literally from hemp ropes around their necks. There&rsquo;s no rehabilitating these hateful, racially motivated terrorists who will, if given the chance, murder more innocent whites. The most effective prison for the likes of the Knoxville Horror murderers is a grave. Only two people are known ever to have escaped from a grave, and they weren&rsquo;t murderers.</p>

		<p>Davidson will likely be visited by White lib &#8220;journalists&#8221; as the years wear on.  These traitors will report on his love for poetry, literature, and religion.</p>
<p>What we won&rsquo;t hear is that his poetry will describe in lurid detail what he did to his victims, his literature will tell of his depraved years of maturity, and his faith will be the Black Muslim sewage.</p>
<p>Without doubt, the lib interviewer/writer will be some clueless blonde Caucasian woman who has &#8220;compassion&#8221;.</p>

		<p>The only thing that needs to change, for the US to become completely nationalistic and literally force non-whites into specific areas they are not allowed to leave is this.</p>
<p>Find a way to take control of the news media enough that non-white on white crime is given a reasonable amount of coverage.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.  In a population as well armed as ours, no matter what those in government might have to say on the matter, simple knowledge would cause dramatic, irreversible change that would likely spread to all other white countries.</p>
<p>And understand this&hellip;.it&rsquo;s already starting to happen because of the internet.  One has only to look at the breakdown of newspaper sales and TV news viewership to know that lots and lots of people are getting their news elsewhere.</p>

		<p>I got mad after Tiffany Nicole Long, I got more mad after Wichita, and after Channon and Christopher I am totally off of the reservation so to speak.</p>
<p>People forget that during the time these atrocities were commiteed we were bombarded with the &#8220;Imus incident&#8221; and what was left to cover regarding the Duke Lacrosse case.</p>
<p>Couple all of that with the yearly revisiting of poor old Emit Till&rsquo;s story and it is not difficult to wish for a reckoning.</p>

		<p>Just a comment. Everyone has heard ad infinitum about Joran Van Der Sloot the evil white guy who has killed 2 white women. Nancy Grace, Bill O&rsquo;Rielly, Larry King and more have commented with honesty and disgust about this creep. </p>
<p>Lamarcus&rsquo; crimes were far more vicious as evil than Van Der Sloots he didn&rsquo;t torture his victims in the cruel and in human way that those guys did in Knoxville. </p>
<p>So where is the indignation regarding this guy? Very little has been said compared to Van Der Sloot. Maybe because Van Der Sloot is white he gets more attention. Also it is much more newsworthy for whites to commit these types of crimes. Why because whites commit them in such fewer cases.</p>
