<h1>Dutch Voters Lean Right on Economy</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Toby Sterling, Arab News, June 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Voters appeared likely to shift the Netherlands to the right in national elections on Wednesday dominated by concerns over the rising national debt and discontent over immigration.</p>
<p>The conservative VVD party under leader Mark Rutte holds a solid lead in opinion surveys, running on a deficit-busting, tough-on-immigration platform. The overtly anti-Islam Freedom Party of Geert Wilders, which wants a ban on all immigration from non-Western countries, also appears set to book large gains, perhaps doubling its current strength in parliament.</p>
<p>A softer approach promoted by left-leaning parties, including former Amsterdam Mayor Job Cohen&rsquo;s Labor Party, is unlikely to win a majority, though Labor is running second in polls and has made a late surge.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If the Dutch swing to the right, they would follow voters in Britain, who ousted the long-governing Labor Party last month, in Germany and earlier in France. Nationalist and anti-immigrant parties have been gaining force even in the traditionally open-door countries of Scandinavia.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About 10 parties of the 24 that are fielding candidates are expected to win entry into the 150-seat Second Chamber, the legislative house of parliament. But in the fractured political scene, none is expected to come close to a majority, and a long period of political bargaining is likely to build a 76-seat majority coalition among three or four parties.</p>
<p>One possibility, however, is a minority government of right-wing parties, with outside support from the Freedom Party. No party is anxious to join an alliance with Wilders because of his sharp, often polarizing anti-Islam politics and his leftist economic views. He is facing criminal prosecution for inciting hate. Various opinion polls agree on the preelection trends.</p>

		<p>The latest projections show Wilders&rsquo;s party getting 24 seats, compared to 9 four years ago.  Cohen&rsquo;s party gets 31, and Jan Peter Balkenende&rsquo;s party getting 30.</p>

<p>Is this misinformation, just a mistake, or does the political/economic left and right have a different meaning in the Arab world? Wilders&rsquo;s Party for Freedom is the party second farthest economically right with representation in the Dutch parliament; in fact, the Party for Freedom probably has a stronger capitalist philosophy than the US Republican Party.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;&hellip; perhaps doubling its current strength in parliament.&#8221;</p>
<p>No even better! The Party for Freedom almost tripled their seats in the parliament and DID triple their percentage of the vote!</p>

<p>Liberty and nationalism are once again on the march in Western Civilization!<br>
The USA&rsquo;s turn to chime in is coming too, but Europe is leading the way this time.</p>

		<p>CORRECTION: <br>
When I said, &#8220;The Party for Freedom almost tripled their seats in the parliament and DID triple their percentage of the vote!&#8221; That was inaccurate. I don&rsquo;t know why my mind flinched and I had an arithmetic failure for a moment, but what I should have said was &#8220;The Party for Freedom almost TRIPLED their seats in the parliament because they nearly tripled their percentage of the vote!&#8221;</p>

		<p>NrnAmNationalist, perhaps because most of Europe did not flood their country with incompatible immigrants at the same rate the U.S. did. The U.S. is done, it is overly reliant upon oil, educational projections of the future demographics are terrible, and it&rsquo;s heavily indebted. </p>

_________________</p>
<p>Is this another misrepresentation of fact, or have I been misinformed?<br>
It&rsquo;s been my understanding all along that Wilders is exclusively preoccupied with Islam and did not care about non-Islamic immigration from other sources, and that he had no racial concerns at all. </p>

 It is about time they do. I hope eventually all non-Whites and their White supporters are kicked out of Europe. I also hope that after they are all kicked out, the European people would hopefully not forget the lessons of the last 30-50 dark years of non-White invasion, rape and plunder of Europe all with the collaboration with Marxist European governments and a Marxist media, full of hatred for the native people of Europe and their culture, as well as millions of naive native White useful idiots.</p>

		<p> I could tell that something was happening in Holland by listening to NPR the day after the elections. I expected an orgy of celebration after a decisive victory by Dutch multiculturalist and Amsterdam Mayor Job Cohen. Instead, I heard (how NPR always covers stories they disapprove of)  &mdash;  silence&hellip;dead silence. The Freedom party&rsquo;s wins more than made up for the disappointing showing of the BNP. Of course,the news from Amerika was not so sanguine: half of all births in the United States are now minorities. This seals the doom of our formerly great Republic  &mdash;  look away America Land!</p>

		<p>Fantastic result, after the success of the Conservatives in Britain we are really begining to see the tide turn and the post WWII era of mass immigration is ending for Europe.<br>
Lets not forget that stopping more coming is just the start, repatriation must be the end game. Where the far right leads the centre will follow.</p>
