			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carrie Budoff Brown, Politico, June 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Long pilloried for being soft on illegal immigration, top Democratic officials have concluded there&rsquo;s only one way they can hope to pass a comprehensive immigration bill:</p>
<p>Talk more like Republicans.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re seizing on the work of top Democratic Party operatives who, after a legislative defeat in 2007, launched a multiyear polling project to craft an enforcement-first, law-and-order, limited-compassion pitch that now defines the party&rsquo;s approach to the issue.</p>
<p>The 12 million people who unlawfully reside the country? Call them &#8220;illegal immigrants,&#8221; not &#8220;undocumented workers,&#8221; the pollsters say.</p>
<p>Strip out the empathy, too. Democrats used to offer immigrants &#8220;an earned path to citizenship&#8221; so hardworking people trying to support their families could &#8220;come out of the shadows.&#8221; To voters, that sounded like a gift, the operatives concluded.</p>
<p>Now, Democrats emphasize that it&rsquo;s &#8220;unacceptable&#8221; to allow 12 million people to live in America illegally and that the government must &#8220;require&#8221; them to register and &#8220;get right with the law.&#8221; That means three things: &#8220;Obey our laws, learn our language and pay our taxes&#8221;  &mdash;  or face deportation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>President Barack Obama uses the buzzwords. So does the congressional leadership. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), author of the Democratic immigration plan, scolds advocates who refer to illegal immigrants as &#8220;undocumented workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This time around, the message starts with a pledge to secure the borders and crack down on employers. It then moves to this: &#8220;It is unacceptable to have 12 million people in our country who are outside the system. We must require illegal immigrants to register for legal status, pay their taxes, learn English and pass criminal background checks to remain in the country and work toward citizenship. Those who have a criminal record or refuse to register should be deported.&#8221;</p>

		<p>How about deporting all the illegals?  Let&rsquo;s start with that as the first step.  The other requirements are just window dressing that will never be enforced and are uneforcable.  It all looks good on paper and sounds good.  Like the &#8220;Health Care Reform&#8221;, it is not what it looks like.  What is needed is the migrant workers&rsquo; program that this country had in the 1950&rsquo;s.  It worked for both countries.  But crashed it was the farmers did not want to pay their fair share.  With that program, this country was not stuck with a massive invasion of Third Country peoples.  </p>
<p>The election process needs to be changed so that the average citizen has a chance to run for office.  Only then, will government truly reflect the concerns of the average citizen.  This country is on a sure road toward crashing with the Third World peoples becoming a majority.  Perhaps, it is needed to clean out the corruption in this country and for a different country and system to arise from the ashes.  </p>

		<p>Not quite good enough.  Illegal immigrants should be finger printed, their DNA registered, and then deported.  They should then put put on a list of people who will never be allowed to immigrate legally.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t you love how the official number of illegal immigrants has stayed at 12 million for over a decade now?  As if we haven&rsquo;t had a single new illegal immigrant for 10 years.  I&rsquo;m sure we have well over 20 million illegal immigrants.</p>

<p>The same thing with the oft quoted figure of 10-12% of the U.S. is black, where I contend, it is more like 40+% and growing exponentially. Both of these  figures, ILLEGALS and BLACKS have been used for the last decade at least! We Whites that get around KNOW it is greater than the government wants us to knnow.</p>

		<p>Actualy, I despise the term &#8220;illegal immigrant.&#8221; These are not &#8220;immigrants&#8221; at all, no more than a burglar is a &#8220;unofficial guest!&#8221; These are tresspassers and invaders and should be treated as nothing else. The mere &#8220;legality&#8221; seems so petty an issue - like a simple technicality. No, these are flagrant gate-crashers and should be dealt with accordingly.    </p>

No, it means a lot more, such as:</p>
<p>Stop living off our welfare programs<br>
Stop collecting huge EITC payments for your fictional children back hom.<br>
Stop destroying our schools with your ignorant children.<br>
Stop destroying our hospitals by abuse of Emergency Rooms.<br>
Stop aiding and abetting your criminal kin and cooperate with police.<br>
Stop recruiting huge gangs that are overrunning our cities.<br>
Stop overcrowding our prisons.<br>
Stop driving drunk.<br>
Stop destroying neighborhoods.<br>
Stop driving blacks from their urban ghettos to suburban Section 8 housing.</p>
<p>And DO<br>
Learn how to live like civilized people.</p>
<p>When all that happens you will be welcome.   I&rsquo;m still waiting&hellip;..</p>

		<p>As #2 noted, there are surely more like 20 million illegals now.</p>
<p>I, for one, am not surprised that the Democratic leadership has taken this stance.  There are still more whites than Hispanics in the U.S., and, if the major parties don&rsquo;t address this most important issue, the Tea Party movement will gain sway.  Schumer, in fact, along with Lindsey Graham (who then bailed), proposed an ID card with DNA.  Most illegals wouldn&rsquo;t be willing or able to register, pay proper taxes, learn English, or pass a criminal background check.  Mexican criminals are spreading across the nation.  From what I&rsquo;ve seen, they believe they can laugh with impunity in the face of the law.  They know they won&rsquo;t always be questioned about their status or deported.  If they are, they just cross the border again.  Some shoot whites down in the same manner one would step on a roach and then threaten the cops who arrest them.  Many are third-worlders who don&rsquo;t understand civilized conduct.  </p>
<p>Illegal presence in this country should be subject to a felony conviction.  Just put up the tents and razor wire within view of the border.</p>

		<p>Illegal immigration isn&rsquo;t really about illegal immigration&hellip;.it&rsquo;s about the drug trade and &#8220;blowback&#8221; from what this country did in mexico during the cold war.  Basically, we manipulated things, behind the scenes so that mexican officials would stop exercising totalitarian control over that country, and instead, in exchange for a heck of alot of drug money bribery, allow psychopaths the ability to rape and murder with impunity.  The psychopaths part of the deal is they would rape and murder &#8220;communists&#8221; to near extinction.</p>
<p>The problem with this is two fold.  The first is they destabilized the state of mexico, to the point where that government doesn&rsquo;t really control that country anymore.  Those that do are a bunch of satan/demon worshipping murder freaks who regularly commit human sacrifices and terrorism far worse than anything going on in the middle east.  This is right up on the border of the US.</p>
<p>The second problem is where that drug money comes from&hellip;.which is the American welfare system.  White Americans go hungry so that non-whites can get money for crack, heroin, meth, whatever and the mexicans come here to make huge profits selling them these things.  If the system was changed to keep welfare out of the hands of drug users and drug dealers, 99% of the people in the US from south of the border would leave, almost overnight because the ONLY reason they are here are those drug profits.  Not to have our welfare system support them and most certainly not to seek out a better life for themselves.  They are here to work the drug trade&hellip;..some to also work in gun running and human trafficking.  But the drug trade and how welfare sustains it is the real issue.</p>
<p>The cold war has been over for decades now.  It&rsquo;s time this situation was disempowered.  The way to do that is to reform the welfare system and enforce immigration law&hellip;.also, to militarize our border.  Let&rsquo;s be realistic.  We are dealing with people who take children, cut their hearts out and eat them, while muttering prayers to a goddess of death.  That&rsquo;s what we are dealing with.  That&rsquo;s a bit beyond a law enforcement issue.</p>
<p>A good book (WARNING: not for the feint of heart) about what is REALLY going on in mexico and what the &#8220;immigration&#8221; issue is really all about is The Killing Fields: Harvest of Women by Diana Washington Valdez.  A very important book that makes VERY clear what the consequences are when we allow our politicians to handle political problems through unjust means.</p>
<p>Understand that what&rsquo;s in this book is the ONLY reason both political parties have allowed massive non-white immigration.  It has nothing to do whatsoever with either corporate profits nor with identity politics.  It has everything to do with the fact that the US has a one party, with two heads political system that is insane and out of control.  This is easily cured by a population that is willing to take responsibility for who they vote for and why&hellip;.is willing to watch closely what their elected officials do and hold them accountable.  We have not had that for the last several decades and the consequences have become obvious for even the most dim.  Luckily, this seems to be changing.  Time will tell.</p>

<p>The only part of your missive with which I would slightly disagree is the implication that non-whites are doing meth.  It&rsquo;s largely a lower class white thing.   And it has a non-white racial angle there, too   &mdash;   After a lot of states and the Feds made it hard to buy cold pills in large quantities, to cut down on the trailer park meth lab operations, those are almost non-existent.  But the addicts still exist, and where are they getting their fix?  Right   &mdash;   Mexican gangs.  The meth they bring in is far more potent than anything brewed in a trailer park.</p>

		<p>There is only one way to solve this illegal immigrant problem.  OOPS! I mean &#8220;criminal&#8221; immigrant problem.  In the next election we need to elect Joe Arapaio for President,  Tom Tancredo for Vice President, Jim Gilchrist for Secretary Of The Fence, and Jan Brewer for Secretary Of State. I also recommend we keep Cass Sunstein on and make him Attorney General because he wants to represent &#8220;animals in the courtroom&#8221; and we will have an over abundance of that!            </p>

<p>I believe this has changed drastically in the past few years.</p>
<p>Meth, in all its myriad, deadly forms, is HUGELY popular and widely used in the mexican community in California, mainly because it&rsquo;s cheap.</p>
<p>Around where I work, the drug of choice is &#8216;glass&rsquo;  &mdash;  called &#8216;vidrio&rsquo; in Spanish  &mdash;  which is a very potent, smokable form of meth.</p>
<p>High school students tell me meth is everywhere, readily and widely available, cheap, easy to obtain and simple to take  &mdash;  including being snorted up right in the back of the classroom.</p>
<p>They also tell me it&rsquo;s not just high school-age students who &#8216;enjoy&rsquo; speed  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s young and old of all ages, added to joints, cigarettes and cigars and that speed is pervasive.</p>
<p>And to #10 Anon:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The ONLY reason they are here are those drug profits. Not to have our welfare system support them and most certainly not to seek out a better life for themselves. They are here to work the drug trade&hellip;..some to also work in gun running and human trafficking. But the drug trade and how welfare sustains it is the real issue&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I wish it were true that they aren&rsquo;t here for our welfare system!  The taxes in California are killing me to support these leeches.</p>
<p>The government has told us for the past 20 years that there are &#8216;only&rsquo; 12 million &#8216;undocumented workers&rsquo; in the US.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe it.  I believe there are 12 million in California alone and probably closer to 25-30 million (I&rsquo;ve seen estimates as high as 50 million) or more spread across the entire US  &mdash;  and growing.</p>
<p>All of them cannot possibly be involved in the drug, human trafficking or weapons trade.</p>
<p>The US government could seal off and militarize the border by tomorrow if it so chose; instead, against the wishes of the American people, the USG allows the US border to remain wide open, making the American people vulnerable to mexican gangs, criminals and drunken drivers and forcing American taxpayers to pay for low IQd, welfare-dependent, illegal parasites.</p>
<p>It appears the USG is not only working against the interests of us Euro- Americans, but has declared war on us as well.  And what better way to destroy those whom you hate (us) than by flooding and destroying our homeland with violent, low IQd Third World parasites and then taxing the hell out of us to pay for them, which further weakens us by decimating our wealth and income.</p>
<p>&#8216;Nazi&rsquo;, &#8216;racist&rsquo; and &#8216;bigot&rsquo; is screamed at complaining Whites to shut them up  &mdash;  that is until Hate Speech laws are put in place that will be used to imprison and fine those who object to their own displacement. </p>
<p>Massive non-White colonization is being used by the White-hating elites in the government to displace Native Born White Americans, to make us a minority in the country that we created, to implement an all-powerful, authoritarian, police-state government.  </p>
<p>Whites, when we are a minority, will be the recipient of genocide at the hands of non-Whites who are being primed via the media and government schools to &#8216;seek justice&rsquo; against us White Americans. Non-White &#8216;justice&rsquo; against Whites will be genocide.</p>
<p>As for drugs and the drug war, I&rsquo;m with the late, great Harry Browne, once leader of the Libertarian party, when he said this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Legalize drugs, all of them, and the sooner the better!&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, the obvious thing to do is first and foremost, end the so-called &#8220;War on Drugs.&#8221;  It seems more like a war on law-abiding people anyway.  We have sacrificed a lot of our own liberties to lock up evil drug users.  Then we legalize, regulate and tax drugs just like cigarettes and alcohol.  </p>
<p>The second thing we do is put a moratorium on all immigration, legal or illegal.  We impose draconian penalties against those who hire and house them.  We cut off all benefits to non-citizens and we militarize our border.  Then we cut off all welfare for the able-bodied unless they are permanently sterilized.  NO healthy person should be able to sit on their asses, cranking out babies and getting high.  </p>
<p>For the working poor who have children, we can give out day care vouchers for their children or even build day-nurseries and make them part of the public school system.  </p>

<p>Schumer and Graham still need to go along with any and every one else who has been pro-amnesty.  They will say anything to get re-elected and then go back to monkey business, as usual.  </p>
<p>Then again, maybe they&rsquo;ve studied Mexifornia and other areas of the Southwest where there is a predominantly Hispanic population.  Anytime they have the numbers, they vote out the Whites and Blacks who pandered to them and replace them with Mestizo candidates.  Anyone who thinks they can hold onto power by &#8220;electing a new people&#8221; better figure that the &#8220;new people&#8221; can elect new candidates, anyway.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for all Americans proper to call their bluff and let them know that if they &#8220;elect a new people,&#8221; the old people will work with the new people to throw them out anyway.  I would rather deal with a politician who is a Mestizo than one that is a White race traitor.  Eventually, I can be a swing voter when one Mestizo runs against another, so it&rsquo;s all good for me.  Ha!<br>
