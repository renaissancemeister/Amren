			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sean Alfano, New York Daily News, June 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Artists who painted a mural at an elementary school in Prescott depicting four students, with the most prominent being a Hispanic boy, were asked to lighten the faces amid taunts and tensions.</p>
<p>R.E. Wall, the artist who heads the Prescott Downtown Mural Project, told a local newspaper passersby regularly shouted racially charged comments at his group while they were creating the mural at the Miller Valley Elementary School.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&rsquo;re desecrating our school,&#8221; &#8220;Get the ni  &mdash;    &mdash;   off the wall,&#8221; &#8220;Get the sp  &mdash;   off the wall,&#8221; were common, Wall said. &#8220;The pressure stayed up consistently,&#8221; Wall said. &#8220;We had two months of cars shouting at us.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not a racist individual,&#8221; Blair [Councilman Steve Blair] said on a radio show last month, &#8220;but I will tell you depicting a black guy in the middle of that mural, based upon who&rsquo;s President of the United States today and based upon the history of this community, when I grew up we had four black families  &mdash;  who I have been very good friends with for years  &mdash;  to depict the biggest picture on that building as a black person, I would have to ask the question, &#8216;Why?&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;black guy&#8221; in the mural is based on a student of Mexican descent, a school official said.</p>
<p>According to the most recent census data, Prescott is more than 90% white, with 8.2% claiming Hispanic origin. Blacks, Asians and Native Americans compose less than 3% combined, the data show.</p>
<p>Blair said Wednesday diversity is a word &#8220;I can&rsquo;t stand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The focus doesn&rsquo;t need to be on what&rsquo;s different; the focus doesn&rsquo;t need to be on the minority all the time,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Wall said his artists began touching up the mural earlier this week.</p>
<p>&#8220;They want us to lighten up the forehead and the cheeks [of the boy in the center], and make him look like he is coming into the light,&#8221; he said. The school told Wall they want the children to appear more &#8220;radiant and happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The school&rsquo;s principal, Jeff Lane, told the newspaper he asked the artists to &#8220;remove some shadowing that made the faces darker than they are.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Prescott used to have hardly any Hispanics.  It was (and probably still is) a popular place for people who have jobs in the North Valley (northern suburbs of Phoenix) to live   &mdash;   While the commute is very long, it&rsquo;s somewhat tolerable, and in Prescott, you&rsquo;re a mile high in altitude, and therefore cooler in the summer, usually about 15 degrees cooler than Phoenix.</p>
<p>Prescott also has a Ruger factory, which I understand is operating almost full time.  Therefore, Prescott&rsquo;s economy, unlike the state&rsquo;s or the country&rsquo;s, is probably holding its own.</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;re doing this all over the country.  Remember the photo of the New York City firefighters that raised the American flag at Ground Zero? - They were all White.  Somehow that photo got turned into an advertisement for multiculturalism; they changed it to depict one Black, one White, and if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, one Hispanic firefighter.  The purpose of this is to relieve us of our racial identity and racial consciousness.  </p>
<p>About 6 or 7 years ago Denzel Washington played &#8216;Brutus&rsquo; in a Broadway play - Julius Caesar.  At about the same time a movie came out titled, &#8220;The Honeymooners&#8221;, like the 1950&rsquo;s television show starring Jackie Gleason, Art Carney, and Audrey Meadows with the same name.  </p>
<p>Can you imagine a White man playing Ralph Abernathy in a movie about Martin Luther King?  Every Black group would be up in arms.  They would claim that it is an insult to Blacks.  There is only one reason for these depictions, and that is the ongoing conditioning program to eliminate White people&rsquo;s sense of their own identity and their history, by replacing it with non-Whites.  Imagine 200 years down the road, if they achieve their goal they may have people actually believing that the Romans were Black and attribute all the accomplishments of White Romans to Blacks.  This is where we&rsquo;re headed.</p>

		<p>Look at the photo of the artists. Two white granola hacks have painted a cartoon Tiger Woods in Chairman Mao proportions on the side of a white school. Goofballs of this ilk really do view blacks as deities and this artwork is just a small example of that.</p>
<p>The comments on the NY Post site also reveal that many New Yorkers need a lesson that white majority communities have a fundamental right to have their own children represented in their own culture. </p>

		<p>Are Whites really so stupid to believe that if muslims just stop wearing burkhas, and artists just lighten up a face or two, our racial problems will be solved?  Given that they created the diversity cult and open borders policy, I would guess the answer to that question is &#8220;yes&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Prescott councilman&rsquo;s unease is good.  It shows some vestige of racial consciousness.  Now if only more people will let that grow maybe Whites will have enough guts to defend what is theirs instead of giving it away.</p>

		<p>Lest anybody get too excited about this, Councilman Blair has already been fired from his radio show, and the school has already backed down and grovelled (see <a href="http://www.thepoliticalcesspool.org/jamesedwards/" rel="nofollow">James Edwards</a>).  Nothing new here.</p>

<p>Neither can I. I&rsquo;m sick of having it shoved down my throat and the focus being on minorities ALL the time. While I don&rsquo;t agree with the racial slurs some made, I do agree that a mural should reflect the community and not have to have &#8220;token minorities&#8221; on it.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not a big fan of murals in general, because they tend to be propaganda, and they deteriorate rapidly unless regularly attended to. </p>
<p>This was the idea in Gary, Indiana in past years  &mdash;  to paint gaudy murals in an attempt to cover up some of the blight. Usually, the murals started to look shoddy after a few years. </p>
<p>In our PC era, particularly, trying to get the exact proper balance of races is an impossible balancing act. It is no longer good enough just to paint one race as representing &#8220;all people&#8221;   &mdash;   instead, every race must be meticulously represented in the exact politically correct proportions  &mdash;  or else. For all these reasons, it was a bad idea to paint this mural in the first place. </p>
<p>Leave it to the MSM, however,  to home in on the indelicate comments made by protesters in this case, even as they censor much worse statements made by Hispanic protesters at &#8220;immigrant rights&#8221; marches.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know if the liberal insults being thrown at these people for their comments were in the original article, or if the New York Daily Mail just has some objectivity in their writing, but I must say this is an encouraging article. Any signs of racial feelings are a good thing in our world today. Today it is this, tomarrow it will be more. More people will think that its okay to say things like this, and then they will get bolder, and bolder. Just wait, our day will come.</p>

		<p>It looks as if the white uprising will begin in Arizona.  Sooner or later, those of us who will not die with a whimper, kicked like a dog to the end, will make our stand.  Pushing us into corners and trying to call our indignation and reflex to survive &#8220;racist&#8221; is just not going to wash.  They must begin to realize that whites have rights to life and liberty too.</p>

		<p>Way to go Arizona!!!  #3, Awakened, yes a remake of the Honeymooners was filmed with Cedric the Entertainer as Rajph Cramden and Mike Epps as Norton. Cannot remember the black girls that played Alice Cramden and Trixie Norton.  Watched about 1/2 of it before I got to disgusted to see the end, as I grew up on the real Honeymooners.  During Black History Month at the hospital where I work, one year &#8220;prominent&#8221; black men/women were featured.  I could not believe my eyes when I saw Beethoven listed as being a black man!!!  There were several others now that I cannot remember as it was several years ago now, but all the same, utterly ridiculous.</p>

		<p>I always thought murals were well&hellip;stupid! Most of them seem to be childish renditions of a rainbow world or barring that, depictions of angry individuals in that world. And why are they always part of some kind of &#8220;urban improvement&#8221;? As a middle class man, I walk quicker through an area that has them than one that doesn`t. It`s almost a signal to me, that underneath it will be a group of miscreants lounging at will. They never   brighten up an area. Just make it seem more depressing and hopeless. It`s like a &#8220;Kick Me&#8221; sign for the neighborhood&hellip;<br>
And I hate they way they pollute the public space and intrude on the privacy of the mind. Kind of like a homeless guy living in the park and holding up a sign.</p>

		<p>I live near a small city that has a commercial center with a railroading theme.  A large mural depicts a WHITE porter that, as far as I know, no black civic group has ever protested.  RR porters were always black, and the position was considered a highly regarded one in the pre-Civil-Rights black community.  No doubt the mural planners feared portraying a black in a &#8220;subservient&#8221; position.  I think it&rsquo;s insulting to blacks  &mdash;  like portraying American slaves as whites.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the Daily News and of course not the print edition. The commenters are from all over, not just NY. In fact the NY Post commenters are usually in our favor. Not surprising since it is a more conservative paper. BTW, most white lib multicults come from somewhere else. So let me engage in some daydreaming: The union breaks up into sovereign states and sane NYers (millions of us driven out of the city) swoop back down and take the place over. After we boot the third worlders out we begin a round up of the anti-racist, multicult loving lib whites. Our own we deal with in our own way. But the ones from WI, IL, CO, CA, SC, GA, MI, MO,(and those represent just the ones I met in the city) and all the rest of the states we deport back home ASAP. I guarantee that the Upper East Side and other neighborhoods would become ghost towns, awaiting occupancy by the born-and-breds. I&rsquo;ve already got my eye on some property, maybe Park Slope.</p>

<p> - - So did I.  When I saw the billboard for it I was dumbfounded, and the Play with Denzel Washington occurred at almost the exact same time. It appears that the forces that control the media set these thing up to coincide with one another.  Maybe to test our reactions - or non-reactions.</p>

		<p>Ixnay on the rescottPay.  It is still the best kept secret in Arizona and the place to which I plan on retiring, assuming Reconquista doesn&rsquo;t kick off.  Check out their online paper and you&rsquo;ll see white kids on the school sports teams and birth announcements primarily for white families.  With the Usual Suspects beating to my other intended retirement destinations and ruining them, e.g. Colorado, Idaho, and now Montana and Wyoming, I hope Prescott can stay the way it is.  On my return flight was some liberal-looking goofball that was returning from West Virginia, having just purchased a place in Paw Paw&hellip;Liberals fleeing the mess they made and off to ruin some place new.</p>
<p>That said, I was looking at a mural by the men&rsquo;s room in the Tuscon airport earlier this week; it was kind of a mosaic, and there were no white people in it.  There were Latinos looking like rappers, with sideways baseball hats and gold rings, and blacks, but no white people.</p>
