			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Pat Kossan, Arizona Republic (Phoenix), May. 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Reports are surfacing around the Valley that illegal-immigrant families with school-age children are fleeing Arizona because of a new immigration law.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many Latino-heavy school districts say the recession already has pushed many of their families out of state to look for work. The passage of Senate Bill 1070, which widens enforcement of immigration law, has tipped the balance for some parents who tried to stick it out.</p>
<p>For schools, the impact could be loss of students and, as a result, loss of state funding and parent support. The state could see savings.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Teachers and principals at Alhambra elementary schools in west Phoenix, for example, are saying goodbye to core volunteer parents, who tell them that the new migration law threatens their family stability and that they must leave. The district expects the new law to drive out an extra 200 to 300 students over the summer.</p>
<p>Balsz Elementary District in east Phoenix lost 70 families in the past 30 days, an unprecedented number, officials said.</p>
<p>In contrast, Isaac Elementary District in Phoenix, where 96 percent of its 8,058 students are Latino, lost fewer students than usual after its Christmas break, and its May enrollment grew by 20 students over last year.</p>
<p>At Balsz, a sense of community is fraying. Every morning for the past two years, 20 to 30 parents in orange T-shirts have gathered at designated spots to walk their children to four elementary schools.</p>
<p>The number of those parents, mostly Latino, began to dwindle in January after the migration bill was introduced. By spring, no one was showing up. The district&rsquo;s &#8220;Walking School Bus Club&#8221; ceased to exist.</p>
<p>Those parents were too fearful to walk the streets, parents and school officials say. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>The impact debate</b></p>
<p>Driving out illegal immigrants is the stated purpose of Senate Bill 1070. {snip}</p>
<p>There is no precise count of Arizona schoolchildren who live with families that have one or more undocumented members.</p>
<p>About 170,000 of Arizona&rsquo;s 1 million K-12 students are children of immigrants and include both citizens and non-citizens, according to a 2009 Pew Hispanic Center study.</p>
<p>For every net decline of one student, a school loses an average of $4,404 in state money. The total amount of funding for the 170,000 children of immigrants is about $749 million, or 16 percent, of the state&rsquo;s education budget.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A sizable loss of undocumented families could reduce crowding in some schools and allow others to combine classrooms and reduce teaching staff, said Matthew Ladner, research director for the Goldwater Institute in Phoenix, which has not taken a stance on the law.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>School officials, however, say that if many immigrant families leave, their schools will suffer.</p>
<p>Losing a share of students does not yield commensurate cost savings for schools, they said. For example, losing 10 students at the third-grade level often won&rsquo;t necessarily save a teacher&rsquo;s salary, and the district must still pay for property maintenance.</p>
<p>Already hit by state budget cuts, schools that lose per-student funding may not be able to pay for manageable class sizes, reading specialists and tutoring.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you lose kids, you lose money,&#8221; Balsz Superintendent Jeffrey Smith said. &#8220;It gives you less to work with.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>What schools say</b></p>
<p>Although the last day of school is usually joyful, this year, some schools fear what may happen this summer.</p>
<p>Worry has spread through the sprawling, 14,538-student Alhambra Elementary School District in Phoenix, which has lost about 2.5 percent, or about 363 students, a year since 2008. That&rsquo;s when a new law took effect that made it more difficult for employers to hire undocumented workers and the recession began ripping away jobs in earnest.</p>
<p>Latino students make up 75 percent of Alhambra&rsquo;s enrollment. Before SB 1070 became law, families in which one parent was legal could still survive. But jobs remain tight, and now, any undocumented family member can be deported after getting a traffic ticket.</p>
<p>Volunteers are dwindling, and fewer parents are showing up for parent coaching and teacher meetings, Alhambra Superintendent Jim Rice said. This summer, the district expects to lose twice as many students, Rice added.</p>

		<p>Good news is bad news   &mdash;   at least in the inverted worldview of the Arizona Republic.  We should celebrate the fact that this law is having its intended results.  More states should follow.  As for the &#8220;journalists&#8221; who mourn the consequences, maybe they can find real employment. </p>

		<p>Interesting the way these people can just pull up stakes and leave. What about their jobs? What about future employment? Have they sold their homes? I&rsquo;m betting that most of these people were welfare warriors. That would explain how they can just up and leave.</p>

		<p>Do these people have any notion that they are &#8220;breaking and entering?&#8221; I&rsquo;m always amazed when an article states that the lawbreakers are fearful. Do they think that they will never be caught? As far as their blaming the US for breaking up families, they made a conscious decision to sneak into this country, so if anyone split families, they did it to themselves. They also chose to produce anchor babies and are free to take them home when they leave. If someone would only get it through their heads that anything that happens to them, they only have themselves to blame. </p>

		<p>In Italy I met Americans who were afraid to get a traffic ticket because they were in the country illegally.  Italy, you see, has this strange idea that people who don&rsquo;t have permission shouldn&rsquo;t be in it.  Stranger still, I&rsquo;ve never heard any Italians challenge or protest against this idea.</p>

<p>Actually, schools and everything will improve. The American taxpayer won&rsquo;t have to foot the bill for these students, for their welfare benefits ie. medicaid/food stamps, for their parent&rsquo;s free medical care. These illegals won&rsquo;t be there growing and creating a costly underclass and creating gangs. Plus, American students will get a better education.</p>

		<p>This story is ridiculous.  The schools lose money?  Of course they do!  Where was that money coming from?  From debt the government had to take on to school extra pupils who don&rsquo;t belong there!</p>
<p>The loss of funding to these schools is savings to the Arizona taxpayer.  How obviously can an article be spun?</p>

		<p>-who tell them that the new migration law threatens their family stability and that they must leave.</p>
<p>Yes, and WITHOUT the migration law YOU threaten the stability of my country - - so be off with you, and be sure to take your meal tickets - opps - children with you. We wouldn&rsquo;t want to separate families now. And don&rsquo;t just go to another state, you&rsquo;ll just be as much a burden to them as you are to Arizona, go back to MEXICO. Bye now!</p>
<p> For schools, the impact could be loss of students and, as a result, loss of state funding and parent support.</p>
<p>How is this a loss? After you add in the English classes, free breakfast, lunch and probably supper, medical care etc. that the schools/state won&rsquo;t have to fund anymore. Sounds like a gain to me. Who does the math down there.<br>
As far as the &#8220;parent support&#8221; goes. I&rsquo;m sure that &#8220;support&#8221;  consists of the Mexican parents going to the school to make sure their kids are taught about THEIR &#8220;culture&#8221;, not the evil racit gringos culture.</p>
<p>Those parents were too fearful to walk the streets, parents and school officials say.</p>
<p>As they SHOULD be! Duh! Like it&rsquo;s a SHAME that they have to hide from the law for BREAKING the law. Good God, what&rsquo;s wrong with these people!!</p>
<p>For every net decline of one student, a school loses an average of $4,404 in state money. The total amount of funding for the 170,000 children of immigrants is about $749 million, or 16 percent, of the state&rsquo;s education budget.</p>
<p>No, again, that&rsquo;s $749 million that the state NO LONGER has to spend. That&rsquo;s a SAVINGS not a loss.</p>
<p>Already hit by state budget cuts, schools that lose per-student funding may not be able to pay for manageable class sizes, reading specialists and tutoring.</p>
<p>There would be NO NEED for reading specialists and tutoring if the students were English speaking American kids.</p>
<p>-and fewer parents are showing up for parent coaching and teacher meetings.</p>
<p>Parent coaches - Teaching them how to take care of their meal tickets - opps - children, and informing them of the govn. benefits available to them.<br>
teacher meetings - to inform them that their son Pedro was acting like &#8220;pedro&#8221; in class again.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;&hellip;..the new migration law threatens their family stability and that they must leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nonsense!  </p>
<p>The new law has nothing to do with their leaving since they know full-well there&rsquo;s nothing in it that&rsquo;s a threat to them, illegal or not.  If they ARE leaving, and I&rsquo;m not sure they are since they&rsquo;re known for lying repeatedly about anything and everything, then it will be because they can&rsquo;t find work.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll go to whichever state they think they can freeload on.  When the economic continues to fall and the freebies and jobs come to an end, some of them might go back over the border, but I imagine a lot of them will continue to steal on a full time basis, instead of part-time as they are doing now to supplement their incomes.</p>

		<p>Wait till September when Suzy and Timmy have classrooms of 20 students instead of 45. Wait till the teachers can actually<br>
teach..instead of barely keep order. Wait till the graffitti<br>
and gang fights disappear. Wait till the subject matter <br>
advances several degrees because the collective IQ in the classrooms rises. Things are going to be just fine..everyone <br>
relax.</p>

		<p>Leave it to a liberal article to find one tiny worm in an apple orchard!  Of course schools will lose funding if they have less students, and how disingenuous does it look for educators to desire illegals just to pad their expense accounts!  <br>
When I was a kid, the county truant officer cajoled certain low-class, noncompliant youngsters into school for just one day per term so that the school could count them and thus receive funding for one more student.  The rest of the time, these children were left to fester into criminals and welfare recepients.</p>

		<p>Yes, if you have fewer students&hellip;..especially fewer students with remedial and foreign language needs&hellip;.you will have less per-pupil dollars from the state, and you will not need them&hellip;..not the per-pupil dollars or the illegal alien households.</p>

		<p>We should all be careful about that ideal of &#8216;money saved is money earned&rsquo; nonsense.</p>
<p>Because what you are looking at is a great way for the feds to penalize Arizona in other ways to regain &#8216;compliance&rsquo;.  State money which is not reallocated to renovated and improved education because, say, Arizona is off the dole on Federal highway or other subsidized infrastructure/economic funding is money that will -have to be- &#8216;reprogrammed&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It ain&rsquo;t over yet.</p>
<p>And IMO, that&rsquo;s good enough reason, in and of itself, to switch to private schooling as an immediate rather than as a wait for it to blow up again, alternative.  If you start taking Johnny and Josephine out of Pedro&rsquo;s class NOW, you can start to privatize their learning through the modern day equivalent of single room schoolhouses that introduce truly advanced concepts of teaching from one-period, once a week, curriculum (doubles teacher salaries and attracts real talent), to personal computers and advance core skills with less remedialism.  And dare one hope, maybe even a return of liberal arts and _interesting_ PE (archery, lacrosse, tai chi) classes.</p>
<p>If you leave the education of our children in the hands of either state or federal control, sooner or later, they will make another mistake and we will be right back to overcrowding, over crimed and over-here, &#8216;shared&rsquo; school districts.</p>
<p>Just as is implied via the probable closures mentioned in the article.</p>
<p>All as a function of the symphony of lies, damn lies and statistics that supports treating our children like cattle at a common trough, utterly destroying the value of the dollar we invest into their future.  And bussing them where they do not belong and we cannot protect them, by enrollment economics.</p>
<p>THIS IS THE MOMENT to say: &#8220;My kids are white, I want them to not simply succeed but be dominant in their cultural homeland and I will pay someone more to make sure that that happens&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Reliably, in small numbers, away from the madding crowds of immigrants.</p>
<p>If adequate invest-your-tax-dollar-here legislation can be enacted; you will also accelerate the process of &#8216;alienating the aliens&rsquo; by effectively forcing them into tighter and smaller clusters, by reducing the amount of total tax dollars they can lamprey from until the teat off socialized welfare dries up completely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time we start making some choices on which parts of our lives we will value for the future.  And we could do worse than emulate the rich in shifting towards either/or application of taxes to private or public education.</p>

<p>I believe that should read &#8220;can be deported after getting caught unlawfully in the country.&#8221; But then, it wouldn&rsquo;t have its intended effect of making the law look petty. After reading this article, I can&rsquo;t help but wonder why there aren&rsquo;t more California schools simply flush with cash, considering all the &#8220;undocumented&#8221; students <i>they</i> contain. <br>

		<p>The only bad news is that you can be sure that the vast majority of illegal immigrants leaving Arizona are simply moving into other U.S. states, not going home to their own countries.  It is deemed wicked by the liberals if a schools loses funding because it has fewer students.  But every dollar of funding lost is a dollar of tax money saved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;School officials, however, say that if many immigrant families leave, their schools will suffer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, duh!  If they leave, there will be less students in the schools.  Feds give states money, per student(and not just students, prisoners too.  There are so many more.), so if there are less students, than the states get less money.  The states give cities &amp; towns money per student(etc..), so if there are less students, than the cities &amp; towns get less money.  That is how &#8220;their schools will suffer&#8221;.</p>
