<p>The NBA was again the only men&rsquo;s professional sports league to receive a combined &#8220;A&#8221; for race and gender in the annual report released Wednesday by the University of Central Florida&rsquo;s Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport.</p>
<p>The league had slight decreases for blacks in front-office {snip}.</p>
<p>The study shows 77 percent of the NBA players were black, 18 percent white, 3 percent Latino, 1 percent Asian and 1 percent &#8220;other.&#8221; International players stayed steady at 18 percent.</p>

		<p>How can the NBA have &#8220;adequate&#8221; gender diversity?  I know of not one single woman player, head or assistant coach, or general mangler (sic) in the league.  There have been a few woman refs.  </p>
<p>I know what the NBA also has:  Half-empty or more arenas during the regular season.  TV ratings in the tank, except if you have interesting finals involving major markets or traditional rivals, like what is going on now.  $400 million of red ink in the most recent FY.  Many of the players go bankrupt not long after retiring in spite of making tens or hundreds of millions.  If a team shoots 50% from the field in a given game and 70% FT shooting, that&rsquo;s considered great.  </p>

		<p>We should think about this.. If we pass laws which state that all businesses, to include sports teams, hospitals, etc., as well as political representation, must have a percentage match of the ethnicity of the population, it may bring about some much needed race awareness on the part of White folks.</p>

		<p>This grade of &#8220;A&#8221; is meaningless. It is a thinly disguised PR push from a second rate business school. I mean, I can give something a Grade of A after I start my own fancy-pants, important-sounding institute.</p>
<p>In this case, the grade comes from the University of Central Florida&rsquo;s Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport.</p>
<p>That basically says it all. I went onto the website:</p>
<p>http://web.bus.ucf.edu/sportbusiness/?page=1442</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s liberal nonsense. </p>
<p>I also found this on the site - the MSM probably missed it.</p>
<p>It all SOUNDS VERY FAMILIAR.</p>
<p>Orlando, FL&hellip;March 15, 2010 – The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport (TIDES) at the University of Central Florida released its annual study, &ldquo;Keeping Score When It Counts: Graduation Rates for 2010 NCAA Men&rsquo;s Division I Basketball Tournament Teams&rdquo; which is the most comprehensive analysis to date of the NCAA Men&rsquo;s Basketball Tournament‐bound teams. </p>
<p>The study examines the Graduation Success Rates (GSR) and Academic Progress Rates (APR) for the tournament teams as reported by the NCAA. The study also compares the performance in the classroom for African‐American and white basketball student‐athletes. Dr. Richard Lapchick, the primary author of the study, is director of The Institute and Chair of the DeVos Sport Business Management Graduate Program at UCF.<br>
Lapchick went on to say, &ldquo;Nonetheless, the continuing significant disparity between the academic success of African‐American and white men&rsquo;s basketball student‐athletes is deeply troubling. In fact, the already large gap increased by four percentage points. One of higher education&rsquo;s greatest failures is the persistent gap between African‐American and white students in general. This is also true for white and African‐American basketball student‐athletes in particular. The gaps continue to widen, even though the actual graduation rates of African‐American basketball student‐athletes are increasing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We already have laws like this and they&rsquo;ve been being passed since John Kennedy. Didn&rsquo;t know it was that long myself, but Bill Clinton, in his book &#8216;My Life&rsquo; claims the Kennedy administration began this and it was continued and expanded with Johnson and Nixon. This type of thing is already done. Whites may be aware, but to oppose it is, &#8216;bigotry&rsquo;, &#8216;racism&rsquo; and even &#8216;white supremacy&rsquo;. What is never taken into account, is that things that making things equal is actually a disadvantage to whites. The average age of whites is around 40 years of age, the average age of blacks and Hispanics is closer to 25. Half the non-white population is barely old enough to hold a job, and when they use these blanket income comparisons, they never bother to note that older people of all races earn more money than do younger people. And never, ever, are colored schools, mostly non-white job sites, and even non-white cities now, never are they required to have &#8216;diversity&rsquo;, unless that definition means even more non-whites and a celebration. It&rsquo;s always a one way street. There are fewer women garbage collectors now than there were 40 years ago.    </p>

		<p>&#8220;the University of Central Florida&rsquo;s Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport&#8221;</p>
<p>Blacks consist of 13-15 percent of the population but make up 77 percent of players, yet the institute declares this wild imbalance a &#8216;success&rsquo;. </p>
<p>There is only one way to read this.</p>
<p>In their sports &#8216;Diversity&rsquo; playbook, the criteria for &#8216;success&rsquo; is simply the reduction of white visibility.  Asians and Hispanics are ok to marginalize, as they are aggregated under the collective success of &#8216;non-whites&rsquo;. </p>
<p>The institute should drop the &#8216;ethics&rsquo; from their name.</p>

		<p>The whole concept of an institute demanding more &#8220;diversity&#8221; (read: blacks) in sports seems redundant.  It&rsquo;s like asking for cheese production in Wisconsin, hoping for water to be wet, or demanding to see cars at an auto show.</p>
<p>6 Anonymous:</p>
<p>Keep an eye on the news about early January and mid-March every year.  Like Groundhog Day, you&rsquo;ll read the usual stories those times a year about how the coaches aren&rsquo;t doing a good enough job &#8220;graduating their players&#8221; in big time football schools (in early January, corresponding with the BCS Bowl games) and in NCAA basketball tournament teams (in mid-March).   In the last few years, such stories have also broken down the racial disparity in graduation rates.  And always, the source for the MSM stories about this is this Institute for the Blackness of Sports at the University of Central Florida.  </p>
<p>These stories always bug me, for quite a few reasons.  Why do sports coaches have any responsibility over the academic prowess of his players?  If we blame a sports coach for his players not doing well in his classes, then we could blame the players&rsquo; professors if the players slack off on their jump shots.  The only coaches who are said to have a &#8220;responsibility&#8221; to &#8220;graduate&#8221; their players are D-I football and men&rsquo;s basketball coaches.  I went to a school that was D-III in sports   &mdash;   I was not a aware that, e.g. the women&rsquo;s tennis coach had that sort of fiduciary responsibility.  What it all is is the same kind of liberal patronizing towards blacks, that clues us in to the reality that they don&rsquo;t really believe racial equality after all.  IOW, to good liberal sports journalist, a 20-year old black scholarship athlete in football and basketball is really nothing more than a 12-year old boy in personality and temprament that must be coddled and prodded and cajoled to do the right thing.</p>

		<p>I recall applying for colleges in the early 1990s and reading some college guides. One of their rankings was, of course, for diversity and an all-black college received the highest grade for diversity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I knew diversity, multiculturalism and tolerance meant black good, white bad.</p>
<p>As for the NBA I notice that in international competitions that all-white teams from Europe and South American routinely beat all-black teams from the U.S. In addition, an 85% white Duke University team won the championship in college basketball this year. </p>
<p>But when it comes top picking teams in the NBA they end up 77% black. Affirmative action has spread farther than we think.</p>

		<p>I wonder with this economy why something as frivolous as TIDES hasn&rsquo;t been axed by university budget cuts yet?????  I read the NBA is suffering from poor attendance and low revenues.  Apparently there aren&rsquo;t as many stupid White men fawning over black basketball players as some of you think.  </p>

<p>There are exactly two Asians in the entire league. Also, there are no mestizos. The 3% Hispanic contingent is composed entirely of whites from Spain and Argentina.</p>
<p>But, as noted, an all-black team will be praised for its &#8220;diversity&#8221; in the present climate.<br>

		<p>I Googled this article when I first seen it on Comcast&rsquo;s homepage, as calling this &#8216;diversity&rsquo; when 77% of its players are of one race was funny to me. In total I found 5 websites with small forums discussing it, and most were defending it. The typical argument was that while 77% of the players are black, if you look at the audience in the stands they are mostly white people&hellip;So that equals diversity. That argument comes across as severely stupid to me. I just know that if ANY business, or sport [NHL hello!] has a similar % of players being white&hellip;That they are ragged on for shunning diversity. </p>
<p>Talk about a double standard, I usually avoid racial topics but stuff like this really makes you wonder what is going on with our society. Does white = bad by default, and dark = good ? So more dark people is diverse even if its all one race of them&hellip;That&rsquo;s how it appears to me.</p>

<p>I noticed that myself.  I wonder if keeping the NBA overwhelmingly black is done deliberately and also making sure the races of other players they hire have average talent.  Some kind of self-esteem thing for young blacks to look up to?   </p>

		<p>The &#8220;diversity&#8221; in the NBA was accomplished by hiring based upon ability not upon race. Is the University of Central Florida&rsquo;s Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport in favor of hiring based upon ability or does ability only matter when blacks are at an advantage? Are they anti-white racists or advocates for fairness?</p>

		<p>I do not support the NBA in any shape, form, or fashion.  Don&rsquo;t watch it, don&rsquo;t by any merchandise.  Sickens me to see a young white man wearing an NBA jersey, with the last name of any number of black &#8220;stars&#8221; on the back of the jersey.  Anybody watched a post-game sideline interview with a particular black NBA player?  Mostly unintelligible gibberish with plenty of &#8220;yeahs, uh huhs, you know what I&rsquo;m saying, in yo face&#8221;, and on and on.  And to think, these are heroes to many of our white children!</p>

		<p> I just finished watching the NHL Stanley cup finals. What a breath of fresh air it was to be rooting and cheering for white players. We&rsquo;ve forgotten what it was like to root for all white teams. It&rsquo;s totally different from, say, the NBA or NFL. Not too long ago the NBA and NFL was like the NHL. </p>

		<p>The one good thing that is sponsored by the NBA is the WNBA. The majority of the players of the WNBA are college graduates and are very articulate compared to their male counterparts who barely finished high school and cannot speak properly. A good portion of the top WNBA players are white such as Sue Bird, Lauren Jackson, Penny Taylor and Diana Taurasi.</p>
