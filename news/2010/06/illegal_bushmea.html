<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science_and_environment/10341174.stm">Illegal Bushmeat &#8216;Rife in Europe&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Kinver, BBC News, June 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>About 270 tonnes of illegal bushmeat could be passing through one of Europe&rsquo;s busiest airports each year, the first study of its kind estimates.</p>
<p>A team of researchers says the illicit trade could pose a risk to human or animal health and increase the demand for meat from threatened species.</p>
<p>The figure is based on seizures from searches carried out over 17 days at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris.</p>
<p>The findings appear in the journal Conservation Letters.</p>
<p>A team of researchers from France, Cambodia and the UK said it was the &#8220;first systematic study of the scale and nature of this international trade&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We estimate that about five tonnes of bushmeat per week is smuggled in personal baggage through Paris Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport,&#8221; they wrote.</p>
<p>During the 17-day study, a total of 134 passengers arriving on 29 flights from 14 African nations were searched.</p>
<p>Nine people were found to be carrying bushmeat, which had a combined mass of 188kg.</p>
<p>In total, 11 species were found  &mdash;  including two types of primates, two kinds of crocodiles and three rodent species  &mdash;  four of which were listed as protected species.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Lucrative trade&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Co-author Marcus Rowcliffe from the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) explained why the international team of researchers decided to carry out the research.</p>
<p>&#8220;As no study like this had been carried out before, we really had no idea as to the volume of bushmeat coming into airports,&#8221; he told BBC News.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a surprise when we saw how much was arriving.&#8221;</p>
<p>The products were not only imported for personal consumption, but were part of a lucrative organised trade with high prices indicating luxury status, Dr Rowcliffe added.</p>
<p>&#8220;A 4kg monkey will cost around 100 euros (Â£84), compared with just five euros in Cameroon,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Based on the data gathered from the 29 flights covered by the study, the researchers then calculated the weekly and annual inward flow of bushmeat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Assuming that (the study&rsquo;s) rates are representative of the average weekly rate over the year, this equates to .&nbsp;.&nbsp.; 273 tonnes of bushmeat,&#8221; they calculated.</p>
<p>The team suggested that there were likely to be a number of factors behind the large volume of bushmeat being imported.</p>
<p>&#8220;First, detecting and seizing these products is not a priority,&#8221; they explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Second, penalties for importing illegal meat or fish are low and rarely imposed. Third, the rewards for transporting bushmeat are potentially high.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers acknowledged that the study had a short time scale and limited geographical coverage, and said that a longer and large scale survey was now required to build on the findings.</p>
<p>However, they added that their study did allow them to consider ways to control the trade.</p>
<p>They suggest offering incentives to customs officers, increasing the penalties for illegally importing the products and raising awareness among passengers that bringing such products into the EU was prohibited.</p>
<p>The team concluded: &#8220;The large scale of current imports makes it important to consider all options for reducing the flow of illegal meat and fish, and of bushmeat in particular.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Not to be a broken record but where is the money coming from to provide the profit motive for people to hunt down exotic animals and smuggle their meat into a country that forbids their sale?</p>
<p>The answer its money being stolen from the people who produce such wealth and redirected to those who would never ever, EVER, do any labor towards it production.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what welfare is&hellip;.what it really is.  Taking food out of the mouths of hard working people so that criminals can have money for drugs and bizarre fetishes like bush meat and muti.</p>

		<p>Where, oh where, are the environmentalists when there are real enviromental issues like these? Maybe in the same place feminists are when it comes to female circumcision and honor killings by Islamic people? </p>

<p>Especially when this bush meat sells for far more than would beef, fish, pork, chicken. Your ordinary everyday meat sells on the open market for FAR LESS than the bush meat. But these folks just love a touch of the old country, don&rsquo;t they.</p>

		<p>This is how exotic diseases like ebola and HIV get circulated in a civilized spociety. When it becomes pandemic, it&rsquo;s up to whitey to find a cure.</p>

		<p>Exactly, Jedderman.  The price quoted for monkey meat works out to something like $12 per pound.  I got a pound of ground chicken to use in tacos at Wal Mart yesterday for about a tenth of that.  The whitefish fillets were $2.40 a pound.  Someone spending money they worked to earn would pass on the expensive bush meat, but when it&rsquo;s welfare money the elites have extorted from working taxpayers, priorities change.</p>

		<p>What market is the bush meat sold too? I guess it&rsquo;s mostly African immigrants, since most white people are very concerned about animal welfare, biodiversity etc.</p>

		<p>Most white people are also intelligent to avoid eating things like bats and monkeys, Chelly.  Bats - yes, bats - of all things have been found in shipments of illegal bush meat.  In addition to being an important reservoir of rabies in the Americas and Old World, bats in Africa act as the reservoir for filoviruses like ebola (which kills primates quickly enough that they can&rsquo;t really act as a reservoir; only a vector.)  I can&rsquo;t imagine anyone wanting to eat a bat, but folks who do are exactly the sort of immigrants our criminal elites want.<br>
