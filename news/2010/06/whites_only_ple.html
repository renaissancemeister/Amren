			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Pallavi Polanki, Open (New Delhi), May 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8220;Want to impress a hotshot client? How about a White woman in a business suit? Business accessories that can seal your deal: blonde hair, blue eyes. Welcome to the rent-an-international employee service. Call now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rent-a-business partner/employee job, however, is a lot less lucrative compared to promotional jobs or hostess jobs offered to foreigners at parties and social events.</p>
<p>White people are quite the rage now. We want them in our movies. In our advertisements. In our clubs. At promotional events. Some of us even want them to dance at our weddings. Not to mention, cheer at the Indian Premier League.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s new, right? The Indian obsession with White people, more so with the White woman, is as old as the East India Company. But the centuries-old hangover just got a new twist.</p>
<p>White women are now being hired by some businessmen to be flaunted, as if they were business accessories, at meetings with clients. Foreign interns in the Capital are being offered money by some Indian companies just to show up at business conferences and meetings in order to sell a make-believe &#8216;international image&rsquo; of themselves.</p>
<p>Jacek (last name withheld on request) is a Polish freelance journalist based in Gurgaon. His website, a one-stop guide for expats in Delhi, carried an intriguing piece of news two months ago. An Indian friend of his had asked him to help find a couple of  &#8216;international girls&rsquo; for a weekend party. No breaking news this. It is quite routine for party promoters and sponsors to hire &#8216;international girls&rsquo; to serve drinks and play hostess.</p>
<p>Then the post on his blog (butdifferent.wordpress.com) got really interesting: &rsquo; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. giving away shots of vodka in the sponsor&rsquo;s (often ridiculous) costume maybe actual work, but can we say the same about &#8220;being and looking good&#8221;? How about attending business meetings with some company representative pretending to be an employee (although with no right to speak whatsoever!), which is supposed to &#8220;increase company&rsquo;s prestige&#8221; and maybe &#8220;boost sale results&#8221;. And how about hiring &#8220;international employees just to sit in the office&#8221; and &#8220;create international environment&#8221; for other employees?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Meet Kasia Kowalska (name changed on request), 21, a Polish national who works in a Gurgaon-based public relations company. Kowalska, who already had some experience with doing promotional events on her spare time, was contacted by an events management company in early December, asking her to attend a business conference. It is not uncommon for foreign interns to take up part-time jobs to make extra bucks. </p>
<p>She was paid Rs 2,500 to accompany the managing director of an advertising company to a business conference where she was introduced to people as his &#8216;Polish business partner&rsquo;. The proposition doesn&rsquo;t seem to have surprised Kowalska too much. To her it is just another facet of the Indian mentality that is willing to pay White people just for their company at social dos or clubs. And businessmen, for their part, don&rsquo;t seem to have had any hesitation in communicating their requirement on how to commit fraud. </p>
<p>When she arrived, she was given visiting cards of the companies she was &#8216;representing&rsquo; and briefed about their background. &#8220;They wanted me to dress in black and wear a red scarf. I didn&rsquo;t have clothes to match. So I told them I could wear a business suit and they were okay with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so Kowalska attended a one-day conference on outdoor advertising attended by some 300-odd delegates, whom she says included people from the media and the government of Delhi. She smiled, shook hands and spoke in vague terms about advertising. The scam was sold. The advertising company went on to offer her $800 a month to carry on the con job on a regular basis. Her presence must have sealed some deals for the company that day.</p>
<p>She was told that &#8220;taking a guy in a suit wouldn&rsquo;t be that interesting&#8221;. But in her case, people would approach the party &#8220;just so that they could shake hands with her&#8221;. There is no room for coyness in this business. There is money to be made. Sexism be damned.</p>
<p>The other big reason why a White woman makes a good business statement: &#8220;They believe that if you have a person of white complexion, then the company can afford to hire someone from Europe, which is assumed to be expensive. So the company must be prosperous. And so everyone believes that the company is doing well.&#8221; No kidding. For crash courses on racism and fraud, apply now.</p>
<p>As Open would discover, the process of hiring a &#8216;European woman&rsquo; to take to business meetings is discussed in much the same way as, say, hiring a receptionist for a company. A 21-year-old Russian intern who agreed to pose for Open as a potential candidate was briefed in very clear terms about the job profile and rates of payment.</p>
<p>The events management company told Sveta Petrovox (a pseudonym) that she would be required to accompany clients to business meetings to &#8220;portray that the company is an international brand and that they have employees from different countries&#8221;.</p>
<p>She could make anywhere between Rs 1,200 and Rs 4,000 depending on the company and assignment. And up to Rs 60,000 if the company hired her for an entire month. If she brings her friends along for an assignment, each would be paid an extra Rs 1,500.</p>
<p>When Petrovox enquired about the kind of girls they were looking for, the voice on the other side said, &#8220;Basically, they have to be eye candy. We are looking for girls from the UK side.&#8221; Turns out, it is not enough to be white-skinned and blonde, you also need to have the right accent. East Europeans may not always make the cut.</p>
<p>Here is a little snatch of the conversation that Petrovox had with the managing director of the events management company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I bring my Asian friends?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean Indian?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a Chinese friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not Chinese.&#8221;</p>
<p>Petrovox pressed on, &#8220;I also have African friend. How about her?&#8221; At which point, he seems to have a rare moment of decency. He hesitates to answer. And then distances himself from the logic of the selection: &#8220;I am only the mediator. I will send the photos. They will decide.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before the conversation concluded, Petrovox was asked to mail him her &#8216;profile&rsquo;, which means: &#8220;A brief introduction about yourself, nationality, height, vital statistics and two photographs  &mdash;  close up and full length.&#8221; Lest there be any doubt what the job is for.</p>
<p>The rent-a-business partner/employee job, however, is a lot less lucrative compared to promotional jobs or hostess jobs offered to foreigners at parties and social events, which pay Rs 1,000 an hour. So the party scene continues to be where the money is.</p>
<p>And then, there is the other scandal. Of hiring international interns as purchases to enhance office decor. Subtlety is alien to Indian sensibilities. We don&rsquo;t make apologies for our bigotry. We wear it on our sleeve.</p>
<p>We prefer in-your-faceness. A rude lesson that  Angie Silva, a 23-year-old student from Australia, had to learn during her six-month internship with an American real estate franchise.</p>
<p>Of Portuguese descent, Silva has brown hair and olive complexion. &#8220;My boss actually told me he would pay me to dye my hair blonde as he believed I would sell more franchises this way. Of course, I refused, but I felt quite disgusted that my sales ability was being judged according to the colour of my hair.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her boss and colleagues made it quite clear to her that the intern from the Czech Republic, who had white skin and blonde hair, had been a better investment. &#8220;I remember when I arrived at my job in India, I felt like the other employees, and my boss was a bit disappointed with the look of me, saying that I looked Indian.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is also a feeling among interns that they are used mostly as &#8220;show ponies&#8221; to be paraded in front of clients and at promotional events. Silva and the two other interns would be paraded each time a client came calling. &#8220;We were constantly asked to come to meetings when a potential client was visiting the office, merely to introduce ourselves and say which country we were from. We were even asked to lie about our previous experience in our home countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yash Garg is vice-president of Aiesec, a well-known student-run international placement organisation. He is in charge of corporate placements in Delhi. Garg says companies are looking for &#8220;international branding&#8221; when they place a foreign intern in their company. &#8220;There is a general perception among Indians that white-skinned people are superior. And sometimes that is the reason why a company hires an international intern. But not all companies do that, one in 15 perhaps. And such companies tend to hire the interns for shorter durations.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is mainly public relations and marketing companies that are most likely to be keen on the &#8216;white skin, blonde hair&rsquo; profile, says Garg. And most companies want an intern from &#8216;Europe&rsquo;, he adds, &#8220;Sometimes, companies opt for an international intern because  they want to experience what working with them is like. Those are the times when they are partial to Whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jacek is employed with a consultancy firm. While he got lucky with his internship, he says it is the smaller companies that are happy just to have foreign interns sit around in office without any substantial job responsibilities because the idea is &#8220;to look cool and show that they are doing well enough to have foreigners&#8221;. This, in spite of the fact that Aiesec interns are paid a Rs 15,000 monthly stipend by the company.</p>
<p>Says Jacek, &#8220;One of my friends who joined a small interior design firm was given a choice of ten different visiting cards, each with a different work title  &mdash;  marketing manager, sales manager, etcetera  &mdash;  and asked to choose one. And now she works more or less like a personal assistant to the boss, doing everything from assisting on shopping trips with his family to choosing upholstery for his new BMW. But she didn&rsquo;t come here to be a personal assistant, she wanted marketing.&#8221;</p>
<p>So where does all this leave the much-hyped idea of &#8216;Brand India&rsquo;?. &#8220;Some of us want to come back and do business with India. When I go to a company and I see a room full of computers and employees, I might wonder if it was all rented for one day. I guess, anything is possible. You wear smart clothes, print a business card and take a White hostess, and you are a company. For me, it leaves a bad impression,&#8221; says Kowalska.<br>

		<p>As with the Chinese situation, I don&rsquo;t see THAT much difference in how we use minority representatives who are providing a front for commercial interests, including BP in the ongoing oil spill in TV commercials and even news reports.  And of course, the media over-represents blacks and minorities, but blacks especially in television news, and entertainment.  This is not that much different from the Indians or Chinese, except that they are using whites and are not hiding why they are using them.  Don&rsquo;t anyone tell me that all those pretty news women are not there for sex appeal, and all that suggestive white/black pairing that goes on in the media is not aimed at social engineering, impression making, etc.  All this news tells us is something we already know, Asians appreciate white beauty and intelligence.  In fact, they aspire to it, while we in the West are almost literally politically and socially consuming it to death.</p>

		<p>Could it be that Indians think white women to be the most beautiful because&hellip; well, they are?</p>
<p>There are a number of youtube posts purporting to prove how pretty Indian women are.  Tellingly every single woman they feature has pale skin.<br>

		<p>I think an important element has been ignored with regard to this issue.  We treat this as if what they are doing is for the sake of appearances.  Yet, this has been going on for a very long time, particularly in india.  I mean, it used to be common for indian men to let visiting whites sleep with their wives and daughters in the hopes children would be produced.  That&rsquo;s a bit odd.  Perhaps they wanted white &#8220;genes&#8221; but I think the explanation is a bit simpler but far more disturbing.</p>
<p>I think these people think that there is an inherit quality of whites that magically produces wealth, prestige and prosperity.  Much like the &#8220;cargo cults&#8221; where ignorant blacks went through the ritual of preparing airfields in the crazy belief that planes would magically appear to drop off riches, I think indians (and the chinese described in another article) really think that just having whites around will cause an effect.  It&rsquo;s not just about appearances.</p>
<p>Sure, it makes sense to produce a white face for image purposes in business.  But often, there is nothing else to the business (that and investment capital&hellip;.soon to be lost) as the &#8220;business&#8221; is nothing more than a boiler room setup.  Yet there is real, often big money involved.  And paying whites to be guests at a wedding?  For appearance sake?  That is taking it a bit far.  I think rather that the family is of the opinion that having whites present will magically bring prosperity to them and the family.</p>
<p>The logic behind what these people are doing is stretched pretty thin.  There is more to it than that.</p>

<p>I was interested to see this article is from and India publication. It reads much like an MSM article. Lots of tongue clucking, and at least one use of the R-Word. Have to tell the reader the proper way to think about these things, after all. We have taught them well.</p>

		<p>This should provoke a reaction from white males.</p>
<p>Any male of any race should have a primal, visceral response to seeing one of his females being approached by a male of another race.</p>
<p>Potentially, she could be taken into the alien race to bear their children, representing a gain for that race which acquired her and a loss for his.</p>
<p>If a man loses the instinct to sense threats to is genetic pool, if he no longer has a gut reaction or suppresses his animalistic nature and accepts his women being preyed upon by &#8216;others&rsquo;, then he is no longer man nor beast.</p>
<p>As the world is pushed closer to a borderless marketplace governed by law of the jungle, expect that attractive white women will be even more of a commodity, and white males will be tested to do something in defense of them.  </p>

<p>Not forgetting being compelled to double up as the proverbial &#8216;good time girl&rsquo; if you want the job, no doubt.</p>
<p>Indian business promoters have no qualms about specifying only White Europeans especially native White British, effectively declaring,</p>
<p> <i>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t make apologies for our bigotry. We wear it on our sleeve.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>If this is what &#8216;Whitey&rsquo; has come to represent and to let himself be reduced to then maybe, we all deserve to perish.<br>

		<p>Having extensive experience with Indians and other Asians, I can tell you that every Indian guy wants a light skinned wife.  A few even get white women, and, I must say, the kids come out very nice looking.</p>
<p>Indians also tend to be very respectful of white people and this is refreshing.  Someone in the world actually sees value in what our cultures can offer.  Probably has to do with the Asian IQ being higher than the black and latino IQ, the latter two groups always trying to tear us down.</p>
<p>It has been my conviction for some time that in the world of the future, earth will be divided between blacks and latinos on one side (fighting among themselves) and whites and asians on the other side (working together for the most part with Asians being the dominant partner).  </p>

		<p>I am seeing one too many comments claiming &#8220;this is no different from whites in the US using blacks for everything&#8221;.  </p>
<p>If you are going to say that, then please clarify.  I don&rsquo;t see it as &#8220;exactly&#8221; the same at all.  It is obviously being done for different reasons, and the people in India obviously have more integrity by using whites than those of us here in the US who want to use blacks.  </p>
<p>I am not saying the people in India and China shouldn&rsquo;t be proud of their own race first, but at least they are using their brains by using a race of people who are in fact intelligent and good looking.  Can&rsquo;t say the same for whites in America using blacks all the time.</p>
<p>So, please, if you are going to say such a thing, please specify what you mean.  Otherwise you are insulting white people.  It is almost as if you are implying that Indians and Chinese people are lowering their standards and practicing affirmative action by using whites so often, which isn&rsquo;t really the case.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I have to disagree with you Jay.  First of all I don&rsquo;t think that just because of stories such as this, we should trust Asians.  Their admiration of white people is hypocritical.  They admire us when it suits them.</p>
<p>Indians are among the most arrogant immigrants I have ever been around, and they turn their noses down on whites in their host countries they live in (white countries).</p>
<p>You mention the high &#8220;Asian&#8221; IQ.  When people talk of a high Asian IQ they usually aren&rsquo;t talking about Indians.  India, as a country, has a very low IQ, although the select few who come to America are exceptions to the rule.</p>
<p>As for half Indian and half white children looking appealing&hellip;..I doubt they are as appealing as fully white kids.  But this is neither here nor there.  The mixing of races isn&rsquo;t going to do whites any good.</p>
<p>It seems it is usually the men on here with Asian wives who want to promote this stuff.  An Asian-white alliance is highly unlikely to ever happen (Asians are too concerned with their own affairs), nor is it wise for us to promote this, nor is it necessary.  And why do you assume that in such a scenario, the Asians would be more dominant than the whites?</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s my experience with Indian business owners. When they come to town and purchase convenience store franchises, or fast food franchises they will hire only their own kind. Whites are either fired or not hired.<br>
 Perhaps if you have a good job, you don&rsquo;t care about those of us who must work in such low paying jobs. However, these are the jobs which help us keep money coming in, and food on the table. They mean much to those of us who do not have the skills to obtain better employment, or cannot leave the area due to family obligations.<br>
 A friend who worked in hotel management was fired by the new owners and replaced with the Indian owners family. So, when it suits them to use us, they will. They want white money and business contacts, and customers. They don&rsquo;t care about whites, however. If you need something from them, well, better forget it!! No chance for you!  Maybe if you are wealthier than them and they need you, but if not, it is a different ball game altogether!!<br>
What disturbs me is that when an Indian restaurant opens in the area, young whites and the Politically Correct crowd will flock to it. It is all so multi-cultural, so trendy, at that point. Just wait until those young college age and younger folks, or the politically correct whites and their children need a job!! They will regret all the money spent on way over-priced curries and rice!!</p>

<p>I am a race conscious white and yet I goto Indian and Thai resturants all the time. Simply because their food in general is far sophisticated and tastes a lot much better than European food or the high fat unhealthy American hamburgers and fries. Its called freedom and choices. I have dated high IQ Asian women in college ( Indian and Japanese girls) simply because I found them beautiful, smart, intelligent and caring. Again, its our individual choices. Posters like Courtney need to understand that I can still stand loyal to my racial kind and nation while showing respect and admiration for certain other communities worthy of respect such as the Asians. </p>

<p>Not sure where you came up with this. I have to say every Indian male I have known (born in India) treated white women like whores and would paw at them given a chance. They are as bad as black males; they have NO respect for white women or white culture in general.</p>

<p>Here we go again with the personal attacks and calling out of names.  Amren has really lowered its standards recently with the posts it allows through.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see what a statement about you enjoying your ethnic restaurants has to do with my reservations about people mixing with other races. I never said people shouldn&rsquo;t admire other cultures&hellip;.don&rsquo;t try to make me the bad guy and yourself so innocent here.</p>
<p>If you mix with Asians and produce kids with them you most certainly ARE NOT racially conscious nor are you doing anything to help the white race.  That is obvious and simple to understand.</p>
<p>As for your preference for ethnic restaurants&hellip;I personally don&rsquo;t have problems with those either&hellip;but I do have a problem with them when there are more Asians in this country than there should be.  A little diversity is fine&hellip;but not in the direction we are headed in.  This doesn&rsquo;t mean that there aren&rsquo;t certain aspects of their culture I admire.  There most certainly are.</p>
<p>I will add in closing that I find it humorous how you label their food as &#8220;sophisticated&#8221; compared to ours&rsquo;.  Are the cultures that the food comes from more &#8220;sophisticated&#8221; than white culture?  Maybe you can SOMETIMES say that for Japanese food, but not for the others.  </p>
<p>I just watched a documentary on how entire fields and rivers in India are full of human waste pollution because they don&rsquo;t have efficient sewage.  I don&rsquo;t find it a laughing matter at all, but I wouldn&rsquo;t call India&rsquo;s food &#8220;sophisticated&#8221; just because I like how it tastes. Those parts of the world have an abundance of resources and spices&hellip;while Europe was never blessed with that.  This is why people in those parts of the world (save the Northeast Asian areas) can afford to be lazy while producing little in science compared to whites.</p>

<p>I have never been in India, but (for what it&rsquo;s worth)  I have read that women in India are treated with great respect.  After all, they have had female heads of state, and the US has not.</p>
<p>Perhaps the perception is all in your own attitude.(?)  I wonder. In other words, maybe they consider treating you as attractive to be a compliment   &mdash;    while you consider it merely annoying. </p>

		<p>To Wonderall:</p>
<p>You can eat at whatever restaurant you wish. If Indian or Thai food is to your liking, fine. You seem to miss the point of my post. When you need those same people for employment or housing and so on, you will not get it. Have you had much experience with that? My guess is that you haven&rsquo;t. When and if they need you, sure, they are your best pals. Watch out when they don&rsquo;t! You strike me as being one of those college-educated white-collar folk I refer to in my post. Is your only experience with Asians in casual dating and going to hip restaurants?  </p>
<p>As for food, how much culinary experience do you have there, hmm? My guess is very little of quality. There is much more to European and American fare than hamburgers and french fries!! </p>
<p>As for food, the Chinese I have known used to spend much time degrading American and European food. It was an example of THEIR ethnocentrism, but they felt they were above reproach. In reality, everything they prepared just tasted like soy sauce, ginger, green onions and peanut oil. Didn&rsquo;t matter what it was, that is what it tasted like. Good? Maybe to someone unfamiliar with food, someone with little experience beyond typical home-style American fare. But some of us know better.<br>

Courtney</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be curious to know just what is &#8220;sophisticated&#8221;  food. <br>
At any rate, it&rsquo;s highly improbable that unsophisticated cultures would produce &#8220;sophisticated food&#8221;  [whatever that is].  It&rsquo;s simply illogical.  (And what&rsquo;s wrong with plain food anyway?)</p>
<p>This statement of his just shows how brainwashed he has been with leftist propaganda   &mdash;   and he doesn&rsquo;t even realize it.<br>
(Their food is better than our own! The West is unsophisticated! Whites are barbarians!  Everything Third World is wonderful!)</p>
<p>I once knew a communist (a real one), the husband of a friend,  who described a group of Somalis who had been invited to dinner.  (Somalis, of course, don&rsquo;t use forks or utensils.)   He rhapsodized over how  gracefully and &#8220;exquisitely&#8221; they had eaten with their fingers.  He was ecstatic; you would have thought he had witnessed a work of art.  I could have laughed.  Hey, they were only stuffing their mouths with their hands!  Any one-year old can do that.  But in the eyes of a communist, it was marvellous. These wonderful third worlders could do no wrong. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s precisely WHY they have to disguise it with  all those  heavy spices!  Just think!   There&rsquo;s a reason.<br>

		<p>#23, this simple isn&rsquo;t true.  I read an article written by John McCain&rsquo;s wife on this subject.  She was there at a triage and the women with REAL problems were forced to wait in the back of the line b/c they were chattel.  The men were in the front with hang nails and such.  She was so appalled that she had the head nurse announce that the women would be moved to the front of the line.  When the men heard this they started to riot.  In turn she said &#8220;no service for anyone then.&#8221;  That worked.  This is not treating women well.  Women are third class citizens.  Voting a woman into office is not &#8220;proof&#8221; that they care for women either.  </p>

		<p>Indians will stand in line on a Goan beach to rape an underaged white girl they have strung out on heroin-read about the Scarlett Keeling case.  Indian women on the other hand-whose own morality is sort of reinforced since childhood by paternalistic pressure, will onoly marry a white man of well-regarded status etc.</p>
<p>Indians fdor the most part, have a love-hate obsession with what they call Goras.</p>
<p>Whether it started with the Aryans, who really shoved Dravidian society sideways and southwards, or Greeks, or English or Portuguese is sort of a debatable point.</p>

<p>I see. Thanks for your enlightening comment.  As I said and tried to emphasize, I&rsquo;ve never been there, but I had &#8220;read&#8221; that women are greatly respected in India, contrary to Pakistan and Moslem countries. (Perhaps it is only upper-class Brahmin women?)  Now, I have read the other side.<br>

		<p>&#8220;I mean, it used to be common for Indian men to let visiting whites sleep with their wives and daughters in the hopes children would be produced.&#8221;</p>
<p>Back in the 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s when Americans still went to Mexico City for their junior year abroad it was quite common for the White American boys to be approached by wealthy Mexican women.  With the full consent and encouragement of the husbands, the women wanted White genes to overcome the mixed Indian and White genes of the typical Mexican.</p>
<p>Of course not Americans have gone to Mexico City for junior year abroad for decades because Mexico City had become the third world.</p>

<p>I know several people married to Asians and every one of them claims that they are racial realists.  I say actions speak louder than words.  As was mentioned previously, there is nothing wrong with admiring the good qualities of other cultures, but there is such as thing as crossing the line.  </p>
