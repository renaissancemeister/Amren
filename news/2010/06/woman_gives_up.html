<h1>Woman Gives Up on Death Row Romance</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Liz Lane, Sky News (Middlesex), June 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sandie Blanton, a divorced mother and grandmother from Somerset, is one of more than 100 women in Britain currently married or engaged to such a prisoner.</p>
<p>The relationships between the prisoners and women often begin as pen pals.</p>
<p>She decided to start writing to men awaiting execution after hearing about her father&rsquo;s cousin, who was saved from the gallows in England in 1935.</p>
<p>&#8220;I read up on all his stuff and found out mistakes happen, and I decided that&rsquo;s it, I&rsquo;m going to write.&#8221;</p>
<p>In February 2008, Sandie married Charles &#8216;Chucky&rsquo; Mamou after two years of prison visits.</p>
<p>He is on Death Row in Texas for the abduction, rape and murder of a teenager  &mdash;  a crime for which he insists he is innocent.</p>
<p>Sandie admits that not being able to have a physical relationship was difficult but says: &#8220;It just goes by the heart. There is a very strong bond that you wouldn&rsquo;t normally have out in the free world.</p>
<p>&#8220;You find yourself telling them more things than maybe you would your friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandie describes Chucky as &#8220;the one that shouldn&rsquo;t have happened&#8221; and admits she was having doubts the night before the wedding.</p>
<p>&#8220;But because everybody knew, and his family was travelling up from Louisiana, I just couldn&rsquo;t turn back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandie got married in a white gown with veil and bouquet, but there was something missing  &mdash;  the groom.</p>
<p>The stand-in groom was Sandie&rsquo;s new father-in-law who stood by her side in front of the pastor and put the ring on her finger.</p>
<p>After just six weeks, Sandie discovered Chucky had been writing sexual letters to a married woman in the UK and ended the relationship.</p>
<p>She continued to write to up to 30 prison pen pals and fell in love again.</p>
<p>Reginald Blanton, 28, was found guilty of shooting his friend in the head in 2000, which he denied.</p>
<p>Last October he lost his final appeal and Sandie witnessed Reginald&rsquo;s execution by lethal injection.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be able to do it. But I did it for Reg because I don&rsquo;t believe anyone should die alone, no matter what.&#8221;</p>
<p>She says she feels very angry about his execution.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anger towards his lawyer for not doing enough, anger towards anti-death penalty organisations that were supposed to have helped. The help comes in at the last minute, which is too damn late.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandie says she will never have a prison relationship again.</p>
<p>She says she has cut down on the number of pen pals she writes to, but is still in contact with one of Reginald&rsquo;s friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not going to just turn my back now. It&rsquo;s too far down the road to do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s so sickening to see this.  It&rsquo;s just so sickening.  I never get used to it.  I wish more Whites felt this way.  Every time I see this sort of thing I wonder about our race and our chances for survival.</p>

		<p>I am middle aged White woman (58) dated a married a Black man when I was in my mid to late 20s. The marriage lasted three years. He was both verbally and physically abusive. In 1979 while coming home from work he was hit by a truck and was killed instantly.</p>
<p>I have long since been happily married to a wonderful Whiye man and he has given me two beautiful blue eyed White boys who are 24 and 20.</p>
<p>I was young, rebellious and ignorant about a lot of things at that point in my young life. Fortunatley, I learned <br>
before it was too late.</p>
<p>Sad to say, too many young White women do not until it is too late. </p>

		<p>You know you&rsquo;re a loser when your black death row husband is cheating on you from his 10 x 12 cell after only 6 weeks of &#8220;marriage.&#8221; Anyway, this article is really just a freak show dressed up as news. You have the criminally insane interacting with the conventionally insane. I&rsquo;d hate to see the offspring. The real culprit here is the prison system which should not allow this nonsense to occur. Is it just me or is everyone in the article crazy? </p>

		<p>I do not understand why a woman would want to marry an inmate. Especially a death row inmate since they will never be allowed to live together. More often that not, he will end up being executed, like Sandy&rsquo;s last husband was.</p>

Too many women fall in love with the man they think they can turn him into rather than the man he is. This woman (and others like her) takes it to the extreme.</p>
<p>What they see is a troubled man who just needs love and tender care and she&rsquo;s the one who can make his a better man.</p>
<p>These guys are also safe in that they&rsquo;re untouchable. She can safely fantasize about how wonderful he really is and how if he got out, she could help him turn his life around. That these guys can&rsquo;t get out makes them safe and the reality of who and what they are never interferes with the fantasy.</p>
<p>These women are delusional. Their nurturing instincts are on overdrive.</p>

		<p>I understand this is quite a common phenomenon among European women. Finding that American black man on death row, finding romance and marriage. European white women have some sort of deranged lust for such men and really &#8220;go&#8221; them!</p>
<p>Then if the thug is finally executed, bringing the body to whatever European country it is for proper burial. The loving spouse taking care of the deceased &#8220;hubby&#8221;.</p>
<p>Those women are really troubled, troubled, troubled people. Really need professional help badly. Really.</p>

		<p>Ughhh I see it all the time an in my opinion it comes down to low self esteem but the even bigger reason is laziness plain and simple. These women are too lazy to clean up, look decent, exercise and eat less, therefore they end up looking for relationships with the only dirtbags that will have them, sadly it reflects badly on the majority of white women that manage to follow the correct path in life and make something of themselves.</p>

		<p>To John PM (re post # 10):</p>
<p>It begs the question, are British women really that stupid, or is it something in the Thames River water?</p>
<p>To be fair, it&rsquo;s not just British women that do this sort of thing. Consider:</p>
<p>Remember actress Sue Lyon, she who played Lolita (opposite James Mason in the film of the same name)? Around 1968 or 1969, she married a convict named James Cotton ( I&rsquo;m pretty sure a Bantu). Her career tanked after that, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure she&rsquo;s now retired.</p>
<p>If truth be known, before I got married, I myself toyed with the idea of starting a pen-pal relationship with an incarcerated woman. But that&rsquo;s how it stayed - as an idea.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if a man really wanted to marry an incarcerated woman, he could count as a plus, the lower tax bracket. The state pays for her support, while he pays lower taxes as a result of his marital status. </p>

		<p>I can offer or guess at only one explanation for white women who befriend blacks in prison.  It is the same as rape fantasy where the woman who is doing the fantasizing is in control; He&rsquo;s in prison and that makes them feel safe.</p>

		<p>  I vaguely remember a story many years ago of an attractive white defense attorney, who fell in love with her black murderer/client, she subsequently smuggled a gun into prison, and I believe the black thug was killed during a violent escape attempt. The female lawyer was later prosecuted, but claimed mental impairment. I really can&rsquo;t explain the motivation and behavior of this well educated, polished and attractive woman.</p>

<p>Years ago I read a book on this topic. Often the women were abused in the past, the fact the bars separate them is what appeals to them. Plus the guys are often very charming/manipulative and put their best personality on (it helps the prisoners as the women send them stuff, stand up for them in front of the parole board, etc&hellip;).</p>
