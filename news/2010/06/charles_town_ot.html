<h1>Charles Town, Other Casinos Target Asian-American Market</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Charleston Gazette (West Virginia), June 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As they add card games to their acres of slot machines, casinos in Delaware, Pennsylvania and West Virginia are targeting Asian-American gamblers by focusing as much on buffet tables as on gaming tables.</p>
<p>The newfound attention to details is part of an open play to pull customers from Atlantic City, N.J., and tribal casinos farther north, and it has advocacy groups objecting about the racial implications.</p>
<p>Following the lead of high-end casinos in Las Vegas, operators such as Dover Downs and Delaware Park are hiring directors of Asian-American player development, expanding dining areas and menus, and considering foreign-language advertising in newspapers and on billboards.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a demographic that does not tend to play slot machines,&#8221; explained Andrew Gentile, chief operating officer for Delaware Park, in Wilmington.</p>
<p>But they do like to play baccarat and pai gow, a version of poker based on an ancient Chinese tile game, said Ed Sutor, president and CEO of Dover Downs Inc.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s no secret that if you go to Las Vegas and you go to some of the upscale hotels you will find that those hotels cater to the Asian market,&#8221; said Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., president of the American Gaming Association, a trade group that lobbies on behalf of the gaming industry.</p>
<p>After the MGM Grand opened in Las Vegas in 1993, officials reworked an entrance based on the company&rsquo;s trademark lion after learning some Asian gamblers considered the open mouth of a lion to be bad luck, Sutor noted. He also said some casino elevators don&rsquo;t have buttons for the fourth floor because four is considered an unlucky number in some Asian cultures.</p>
<p>John Finamore, head of regional operations for Penn National Gaming, which is adding table games at its casinos in Charles Town, W.Va., and near Hershey, Pa., said there are roughly half a million Asians in the Baltimore-Washington market who can now gamble closer to home. The company has hired an Asian consultant to help with its marketing plans and is adding a noodle bar and expanded Asian food offerings at Charles Town.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s just in the culture,&#8221; he [Tim Fong, a psychiatry professor and co-director of the gambling studies program at the University of California-Los Angeles] said, adding that the gambling tradition among Asians is tied to themes such as predestination and fate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The fundamental thing is that these businesses are predatory,&#8221; said Ellen Somekawa, executive director of Asian Americans United, a Philadelphia advocacy group that has been fighting plans to build a casino near the city&rsquo;s Chinatown neighborhood. &#8220;We&rsquo;re concerned that it will have a harmful effect on the Asian-American community and all the communities in Philadelphia.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the same time, he [Fong] noted that studies have shown the rate of gambling addiction among Asian-Americans to be higher than in the general population, which he said may be partly attributed to the lack of services targeting problem gamblers within the community.</p>

		<p>I live in a city with a casino, and it is common knowledge that Asians love to patronize the gambling tables.  </p>
<p>It is a reflection of their values that &#8216;Chinatown&rsquo; looks like a run-down decaying mess, but Asians with bling are always at the casino.</p>

		<p>Ellen Somekawa is 100% right; the &#8216;gaming industry&rsquo; - as it calls itself - specifically targets East Asians because East Asians have a cultural weakness for gambling. Vietnamese and Thai wives of Americans are often obsessive gamblers, if only at the level of bingo.</p>
<p>As with recreational drugs and the demon drink, some people can handle gambling on a take-it-or-leave-it basis and for others it spells domestic diaster and financial ruin - which is why some societies forbid gambling with explicit laws.</p>
<p>My father told what he swore was a true story. When the aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne put into Barrow-in-Furness for a refit, officers were to be seen in the National Westminster Bank - where they were cashing their pay checks - betting on raindrops running down the window &hellip; &#8216;my&rsquo; chosen raindrop will outrun &#8216;your&rsquo; chosen raindrop &hellip; gambling for even trivial sums of money being a court-martial offence on Australian warships.</p>

		<p>I see this story hasn&rsquo;t gotten too many replies, probably because of the obvious-Asians love to gamble. Maybe not all, I would hate to stereotype type, but in most any casino there are huge sections dedicated to Asians. Quite frankly from what I know of specialties divvied out by casinos I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised at all at what goes on. If any casino workers would like to share anonymously I&rsquo;d like to hear.<br>
Asians love gambling, are very superstitious-8 is a positive number 4 a negative, etc&hellip;Too a certain extent it makes Asians seem more human, risking it all at a game of chance.<br>

<p>This is feng shui stuff. Straight lines mean death. A statue of a dog at the entrance is a guard against evil spirits, red is good luck, mirrors bounce back death energy, the ends of a roof curve upward [ortherwise the end of the roof resembles an arrow] etc.</p>
<p>Feng shui [&#8220;feng schway&#8221;] is incorporated into all designs of buildings, the orientation, etc. Even the most modern of high-rise building must have a geomancer to determine the proper positioning of the structure to prevent &#8220;bad luck&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Please note that legalized gambling in all the manifestations we see now, is such a growth business. Places like WVA and DE never used to have gambling and now do so. All the states, all the municipalities, all the reservations MUST have some sort of gambling. The government just no longer has the income from business and has not had for some time the revenue to make ends meet. So gambling is the last resort. AND a very bad sign.</p>
