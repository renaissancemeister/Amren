			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Krissah Thompson, Washington Post, June 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A 2004 state Supreme Court ruling pushed Kentucky&rsquo;s remaining segregated clubs to stop the discrimination or risk losing tax deductions. Still, at least one club held out until late last year.</p>
<p>But the idea that the government has no right to interfere with membership practices of private businesses and clubs is still prevalent enough here that it has become a point of controversy in this year&rsquo;s U.S. Senate race in the state. Republican Party nominee Rand Paul caused a stir last month when he said he believed private businesses should not be forced to abide by civil rights laws.</p>
<p>Republican Party leaders wanted nothing to do with his comments, and Paul soon backed down, saying he supports the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and would not want it to be repealed. But some in Kentucky welcomed his remarks. For many years, Kentuckians who belong to the state&rsquo;s most exclusive clubs have made the same argument that got Paul into trouble. Two decades after prominent country clubs in many other states began to accept their first black members, some here remained segregated, said Gerald Smith, director of African American studies at the University of Kentucky.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Idle Hour Country Club in Lexington is one example. The club, founded in 1924, is known for its pristine 18-hole golf course, clay tennis courts and Southern cuisine. Until seven months ago, it had never had a black member.</p>
<p>Phil Scott, chairman of Idle Hour&rsquo;s board, said he agreed with Paul&rsquo;s initial view that there is &#8220;tension&#8221; regarding the rights of private groups and the protections of civil rights law. &#8220;We all have the right under the Constitution to meet with people and be with people we want to be with,&#8221; said Scott, a trial lawyer. &#8220;On the other hand, there are equal protections under the law. The question is: Which is going to prevail?&#8221;</p>
<p>The prevailing view at Idle Hour has always been: If we don&rsquo;t want you, we don&rsquo;t have to take you. &#8220;That&rsquo;s very plain,&#8221; Scott said. &#8220;There is no right of membership. It&rsquo;s a privilege.&#8221; (And one for the privileged. New members pay a $50,000 initiation fee.) The club accepted its first black member  &mdash;  retired NBA player Sam Bowie, who attended the University of Kentucky and is well known in Lexington  &mdash;  in November. &#8220;Sam&rsquo;s just like everybody else,&#8221; Scott said.</p>
<p>The Louisville Country Club accepted its first black members in 2006. John McCall, the club&rsquo;s president and an executive at a local energy company, said he feels strongly that it and others &#8220;should have moved faster.&#8221; (He declined to say how many black members are there now.) Yet he, too, resists the notion that government should have a say in how his club operates. &#8220;You will have a more successful value-based society&#8221; if you can move people to the &#8220;right conclusions about their own lives than if you force it,&#8221; McCall said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The state Supreme Court ruled in 2004 that the commission could force the clubs to open their records, under a state law that prohibits club members from taking tax deductions for dues to clubs that discriminate.</p>
<p>Since then, &#8220;there have been tremendous changes,&#8221; said John Johnson, executive director of the commission. &#8220;The truth is that if people were going to do the right thing, there would have never been a need for these laws to be on the books to begin with.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Katon Dawson, South Carolina&rsquo;s GOP chairman, quit the Forest Lake Club in Columbia in 2008 when it came out that the 80-year-old country club had no black members. {snip} Former Maryland governor Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. (R) got into similar political trouble in 2005 when he held a fundraiser at the Elkridge Club in Baltimore, which had no black members at the time. {snip}</p>
<p>McCall does not deny that for many years whites resisted integrating the clubs. But he said they face a different problem now that they are desegregated: Many prominent blacks decline invitations to join.</p>
<p>As Smith explains it, &#8220;Who wants to be in that environment, given the history?&#8221;</p>
<p>One person who does is William Summers V, 38, a banker in Louisville who was the first African American to accept membership in McCall&rsquo;s club. He said he joined because, like Coleman, he believes blacks should be a part of all segments of the city&rsquo;s social life. His grandfather owned the local R&B; radio station, and his father has been deputy mayor for 21 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;I lived in Louisville all my life, and I had no idea the club existed,&#8221; Summers said. &#8220;There shouldn&rsquo;t be any place in my home town that isn&rsquo;t diverse.&#8221;</p>

						<p>
							<i>Alex Pappas, The Daily Caller, June 2, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Because Liz Carter is white, she&rsquo;s banned from debating Democrat Rep. Hank Johnson and the other black candidates running for his Georgia congressional seat at a candidate forum in Atlanta tonight.</p>
<p>The forum, moderated by Newsmakers Live, is solely for the black Republicans and Democrats running for Johnson&rsquo;s 4th Congressional District seat, Carter took to the Internet to say.</p>
<p>Carter, a Republican, expressed her disappointment on Twitter Wednesday, asking, &#8220;What happened to diversity?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We called them, we asked to participate,&#8221; said Carter&rsquo;s campaign manager, Cheryl Prater. But she said Newsmaker Live&rsquo;s event moderator, Maynard Eaton, told the campaign that because Carter is white, she&rsquo;s only allowed to sit in the audience and not participate.</p>
<p>Newsmakers Live is a black media organization, which according to its website has a &#8220;global urbane perspective&#8221; and publishes a weekly journal and video show that &#8220;embodies a unique &#8216;infotainment&rsquo; concept that specializes in intense interviewing of prominent personalities and political figures.&#8221; Its website includes videos titled, &#8220;Are Black Babies An Endangered Species,&#8221; and &#8220;Moving African-American Businesses to the Next Level.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maynard, the editor-in-chief of Newsmakers Live, did not immediately respond to a request for comment by e-mail. But a flier advertising the event&rsquo;s guests only shows the photos of the three black Democrats and one black Republican running for the seat: Hank Johnson,Vernon Jones and Connie Stokes, all Democrats, and Republican candidate Cory Ruth.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;There shouldn&rsquo;t be any place that isn&rsquo;t diverse&rdquo; &mdash; except for a black candidates&rsquo; forum. </p>
<p>There must be three or four hundred of the non-white groups in the state, and they&rsquo;re not all just social clubs, many are committed to bringing their outlook on life to everyone. </p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t that what the civil rights movement was about? Demonizing white special interest groups while exalting and promoting as many non-white groups as possible. And saying the whole thing is unfair, to people of color.</p>

		<p>All private clubs discriminate in who can belong.  Otherwise, they wouldn&rsquo;t be private.  All sorts of factors besides race are used in selection.  </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t have a &#8220;Private Club&#8221;, but do have a few guys over to play pool and empty beer cans and talk about the decay of the USA, I pick who I want over here, and blacks are not on my &#8220;guest list&#8221;, does that make me a &#8220;racist&#8221;?</p>

		<p>One thing you could always say about LCN: it was an exclusive, non-diverse club.  Never heard any blacks complaining about that!</p>

		<p>Another thread on today&rsquo;s Amren deals with adoption in Sicily.  I.e., whites can&rsquo;t adopt white children.  A poster there states that Mr. Sarkozy of France is of the opinion that whites should marry non-whites.  By force, by law, what?</p>
<p>Mr. William Summers (above) states that &#8220;There shouldn&rsquo;t be any place in my hometown that isn&rsquo;t diverse&#8221;.  Now say I live in Louisville, Kentucky&hellip;Mr. Summers believes that my bedroom should be diverse also. Therefore what? Laws that say I cannot marry a white woman?  In order to do this they will start with the tax code, by eliminating the marriage tax deduction on state and federal taxes for white men married to white women.</p>
<p>Black men married to black men, white men married to black women, black men married to white women,  white men married to white men, women married to women&hellip;they will not be touched.</p>
<p>Someone out there with a stop watch&hellip;start it.  Lets see how long it takes for this idea to use the tax code to bubble to the surface of political conversation in state and national capitals. </p>

		<p>More and more evidence that liberals are against property rights.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t have our own country  &mdash;  liberals claim that everyone has the right to be here.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t decide who we can or can&rsquo;t rent our property to.</p>

		<p>I am all for this sort of thing! Force elite whites to allow blacks into their secluded, ultra exclusive Xanadus that 99 percent of normal whites could never hope to join.  </p>
<p>Force the billionaires to allow &#8220;retired NBA players&#8221; to use their private swimming pools and allow them into their swanky parties to socialize with their wives!</p>
<p>Why should some people get to opt out of diversity and not others? The only problem I can foresee is some disadvantaged minorities might not be able to afford the $50,000 fee to join. I&rsquo;d suggest these clubs be forced to charge white members an additional fee to pay for free admission to those minority groups who wish to join but have no resources! Why have to redress past discrimination after all!<br>

		<p>The fact that Rand Paul even brought it up in the first place is proof that there is alot of support for dismantling the &#8220;Civil Rights&#8221; Act piece by piece.  If I own a restaurant I should have the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason.  White families don&rsquo;t go out to eat in an establishment and expect to see throngs of loud boisterious head bobbing blackbirds ruining their dining experience.  If blacks like my cuisine, that&rsquo;s fine.  Place an order ahead of time and come to the back service entrance to pick up your food through the slot in the door.  If that&rsquo;s not acceptable go to a black establishment.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I lived in Louisville all my life, and I had no idea the club existed&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is an amazing statement to me. Louisville is not that big! Country clubs occupy large pieces of ground. It&rsquo;s a piece of inadvertent proof that even elite blacks and whites lead separate &amp; parallel social lives.</p>
<p>That said, I find it funny that the admission of one or two tokens satisfies the amateur diversicrats in the press (Nothing satisfies the professional diversicrats, of course). Having Sam Bowie as a member does not make your club less exclusive. Rather the opposite I think. </p>
