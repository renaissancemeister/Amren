			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WorldNetDaily, June 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->

<p>A California &#8220;sanctuary city&#8221; has fallen victim to illegal immigration  &mdash;  going bankrupt and firing all of its public employees, Jerome Corsi&rsquo;s Red Alert reports.</p>
<p>The city of Maywood, Calif., hit the budget wall after it decided not only to be a sanctuary city, but to be a completely &#8220;safe haven&#8221; for illegal aliens seeking protection from deportation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Predictably, mainstream media newspapers, including the Financial Times in London, chose to present Maywood as a victim to the recession, rather than to tell the whole story  &mdash;  that Maywood fell victim to illegal immigration,&#8221; Corsi wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;Crushed by the recession and falling tax revenues, the city is disbanding the police force and firing all public sector employees,&#8221; Matthew Garrahan wrote in the Financial Times, never mentioning that illegal immigration was the problem.</p>
<p>Maywood is a small town comprising only about 1.2 square miles on the southern border of Los Angeles. More than 96 percent of its residents are Hispanic. The town&rsquo;s official population is listed at 29,000 but may be nearly 45,000 when illegal aliens living in Maywood are counted.</p>
<p>In January 2006, Maywood&rsquo;s city council passed a resolution declaring that the city would not enforce any federal law such as H.R. 4557 that sought to declare illegal immigrants to be felons.</p>
<p>More aggressive even than sanctuary laws, this new resolution prohibited Mayfield police from being involved in any immigration enforcement actions undertaken by federal, state or county authorities.</p>

		<p>One of the European papers described Maywood as &#8220;working class.&#8221;  In Southern California parlance, that means cheap labor, paid mostly under the table, for hotels, motels, sweatshops, construction and so on.</p>

<p>How can these &#8220;small town&#8221; officials thumb their noses at Washington and get away with it?  Is the State of our Union so frail that it can do nothing in the face of such defiance?</p>
<p>Why weren&rsquo;t these town officials removed from their positions in handcuffs   &mdash;  - prosecuted, and incarcerated?   Or, at the very least, why weren&rsquo;t all federal funds withheld, as well as all forms of federal assistance?   After all, if the town declared it wasn&rsquo;t going to work with the federal government, the federal government didn&rsquo;t have to work with it.  So let them rot!</p>
<p>I simply don&rsquo;t understand the feebleness of the feds on matters like this.   And yet, they can get plenty tough when they want to.   Just look at Waco!</p>

The town&rsquo;s official population is listed at 29,000 but may be nearly 45,000 when illegal aliens living in Maywood are counted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But how can this be?</p>
<p>We have been told for over 50 years now, that all nonwhites (but particularly &ldquo;undocumented&rdquo; Hispanics) will &ldquo;enrich&rdquo; this country beyond its wildest dreams. Even those planned by the likes of our founding &ldquo;racists,&rdquo; such as Washington and Franklin. At 96% Hispanic, we should not only see this city wallowing in a cornucopia of health and unparalleled prosperity, but also mastering the complications of the space-time continuum to be found in quantum physics.</p>
<p>So, what went wrong?</p>
<p>Could it be this:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7vx3br2ekI" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7vx3br2ekI</a></p>
<p>Oh, I wouldn&rsquo;t think so; it is a bit too &ldquo;enriching&rdquo; from the Marxist perspective, but it certainly isn&rsquo;t what you would call &ldquo;bourgeois decadence&rdquo; either!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

		<p>The great thing about our growing depression is that these mestizos are very likely going to starve, since unemployment is continuing to climb at alarming rates throughout the country, especially for peon labor and civil service employment, because the governments are running out of money and revenues are down EVERYWHERE!</p>
<p>His Greatness, Paul Krugman, admitted in his last article that we are &#8220;in the beginning of a depression.&#8221;  This is the same left wing radical who denied we were in a recession until the country was in the first stages of collapse in late 08.  Now, with too much evidence revealing a plummeting economy he has to stop putting a happy face on the economy or lose what little credibility he has left.</p>
<p>There will be LOTS of Mexicans moving everywhere from every state as they play out their final days, leap frogging from state to state, city to city, trying to find work.</p>
<p>My guess is that even more of them will turn to crime, and that MANY, MANY of them will turn to gangs.  The cartels in Mexico have the only product that is going to sell very well during our down time, and the gangs in the US are their distributors.</p>
<p>I believe it was Thomas Chittum, in his book, Civil War II, that wrote civil war will start with the mestizo gangs, probably in Los Angeles, and snowball from there.</p>
<p>Personally, I think it will start with the Mestizo drug gangs throughout the Southwest and spread to the large cities around the country.  At some point, these same gangs will be at war with the US government, which is no small thing, because the drug business could add to the 600,000 existing Mexican gang members, increasing their numbers to a million soldiers overnight, which is a greater number than all the police forces in the country today.</p>
<p>Napolitano said there are cartel-controlled gangs in two hundred American cities.  The community organizer just might have another crisis on his hands right around 2012, about the time for the election.</p>

		<p>This is a warning how the USA will be when the hispanics become the majority.  Hopefully, the whites will wake up and have enough guts to re-take this country back by voting out the re-cycled &#8220;leaders&#8221;.  As shown by AZ they will leave.  </p>

		<p>Since most liberals would never watch documentaries or crime shows or read books or articles about the problems of illegals, they have to find out the hard way.  Of course, they&rsquo;re still able to blame the recession, but numbers don&rsquo;t lie, and towns will still go under with too much expenditure out and not enough in.  Most illegals, I assume, work low-wage jobs, are on welfare linked to anchor babies, or deal drugs.  Property and income taxes are therefore not paid, but schools, hospitals, and other public services must carry the burden.  Part of the mainstream illegal-immigrant economy is even underground, with trades such as unlicensed, untaxed dentistry.  The banks, of course, can&rsquo;t even make money off people who keep their earnings in their pockets.  <br>
Where there are Mexicans, there is Mexico.</p>

		<p>But let me tell you!  Every Asian owned business in New York employs scads of Mexicans to work in the backrooms doing the drudge work.  Mexicans and other illegals find work so easily, don&rsquo;t be fooled into &#8216;they will starve&rsquo; fantasies.  </p>
<p>A lot of white owned businesses also prefer Latino laborers (as opposed to blacks, for example) because they are like a slave-labor class that doesn&rsquo;t complain too much if at all.  You also don&rsquo;t have to pay them like whites.</p>
<p>Our drug using young people are the fuel for the cartels that will one day make open war on our government and people, probably within ten years.</p>
<p>My solution: </p>
<p>#1: Anyone who knowingly hires illegal immigrants will forfeit their business with the proceeds used to fund border security and they must serve five or more years hard labor.</p>
<p>#2: All illegals must be deported upon discovery immediately (no coddling or six months in a detention center).</p>
<p>#3: Close all legal immigration save for those with skills we need (and no chain migration) and for marriage (can&rsquo;t stand in the way of love! but check more on it).</p>
<p>#4:  Review all green card holders and revoke and deport any who did any crimes, are unemployed, are on government assistance or whose kids are drop outs or criminals or gang members.</p>
<p>#5:  All citizens who are caught USING drugs that must be imported must be sent to mandatory drug treatment camps (without release until they&rsquo;re clean).  Any who go back to drugs will be sentenced to years of supervised living and labor.  Drug sellers will get life in prison in penal camps in the Pacific and drug kingpins will meet the firing squad.  </p>
