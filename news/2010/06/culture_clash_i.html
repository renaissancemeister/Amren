			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ching-Ching Ni, Los Angeles Times, June 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For years the China Project at the Center for Process Studies in Claremont was known in Chinese as an institute. So the steady stream of Chinese scholars who came to study there arrived with certain expectations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The institute is so well known in our field I had imagined that it would at least be in a big fancy building,&#8221; said Xiuhua Zhang, a professor of Marxist theory and Western philosophy at Beijing&rsquo;s prestigious China University of Political Science and Law, who spent this year at the center. &#8220;I never expected it to be such a tiny place. So many people crowded together in one small office without even dividers. The bookshelves and the desks blend together. And it&rsquo;s in a basement!&#8221;</p>
<p>Noting such reactions, those organizing the scholars&rsquo; visits have tried to downgrade assumptions. What once they called in Chinese an &#8220;institute,&#8221; they now refer to more humbly as a &#8220;center.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Take Zhang&rsquo;s other surprise upon arrival at the center, which is located on the campus of Claremont School of Theology. She had been told she would be living with an American host family. She thought blond. She thought rich. She expected lots of children and a pool and many gadgets.</p>
<p>Then she met her host, Madhuri Bhattacharya, 69, an Indian immigrant and a widow living alone in a simple house.</p>
<p>There was no pool, and few modern amenities  &mdash;  fewer, in fact, than she was used to back home. &#8220;I even have an HD flat-screen TV at home in Beijing,&#8221; Zhang said, surprised that her American host did not.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, Chinese people can&rsquo;t believe such big ideas can come from this small place,&#8221; Wang [Zhihe Wang, the founder of the China Project] said. {snip}</p>
<p>The &#8220;monk&#8221; of greatest stature at the Process Center is its founding co-director, John Cobb, 85  &mdash;  Chinese scholars usually can&rsquo;t wait to meet him. But, in person, he hardly fits their image of a distinguished thinker. They are shocked to find that he lives not in a big home with servants but in a small one-bedroom apartment in a Christian retirement community, where he takes care of his elderly wife.</p>
<p>Chinese visitors watch in disbelief as he bends down to tie his wife&rsquo;s shoelaces. They are stunned when they visit him at home and he leaves the lights off in the living room to conserve energy.</p>
<p>&#8220;My first impression was he is living the life of a real communist,&#8221; said Yiyu Liu, 27, a graduate student from Beijing Normal University. &#8220;My generation grew up in a material world. All we care about is name brands. To see a Westerner with his stature live like that and care about what I have to say, it was a shock.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most of the Chinese scholars who visit these days say they are used to more material luxury back home.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Food is the source of some of the major moments of cultural confusion, admits Wang.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the U.S. even the best dinners consist of an appetizer, a main course and dessert, but in China that would not be enough,&#8221; he said. &#8220;During a banquet the food has to flow and there has to be at least a dozen dishes or so.&#8221;</p>
<p>There must also be meat.</p>
<p>Once, a Chinese scholar was invited to the home of another process theory professor, who happened to be a vegetarian. The scholar was served what he described as &#8220;barbecue roots&#8221;  &mdash;  roasted vegetables, including carrots and potatoes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our Chinese scholar took a couple of symbolic bites, put the food down and didn&rsquo;t touch it again,&#8221; said Wang. &#8220;It was so embarrassing. The professor is such a prominent figure. He served what he thought was quality food.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Once they [Wang and his wife Fan] invited Chinese students home for pasta, to show them the sort of food Americans eat.</p>
<p>&#8220;They didn&rsquo;t tell me in person, but when they went back to China they told people they had no idea we lived such impoverished lives in America,&#8221; said Fan. {snip}</p>
<p>These days, she says, she thinks Chinese visitors subconsciously feel superior to  &mdash;  not awed by  &mdash;  Americans.</p>
<p>&#8220;They feel like the American economy is in the tank and the Chinese have a higher GDP and fewer debts,&#8221; Fan said. {snip}<br>

		<p>Chinese feel superior to every race and ethnic group in the world.  They call Japan &#8220;Monkey Island&#8221; because they claim that all Japanese culture, technology, writing, everything came from China prior to the 19th century.</p>
<p>Then everything in Japan came from the west.  Should hear what they think about blacks.</p>

		<p>Who wouldn&rsquo;t feel superior to Americans today?  Just look at what Whites have allowed to happen to their White Republic. </p>
<p>We must be the idiot fools of the planet, and all other nations are laughing at us straight in our faces, as we deserve.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with the Chinese on this one. They&rsquo;d never give away China to the afros and mextizos.</p>

		<p>America is in decline and China is in ascendancy.  This is due to a great many reasons, including: Transfer of manufacturing and technology from America to China.  Transfer of American agricultural technology to Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. these nations can now out-compete us.  Importation of millions of low IQ Third Worlders into the USA. The complete turning around of a previous emphasis on quality, ability, and achievement to today&rsquo;s concentration on up-lifting those with little potential or ability to achieve (i.e., during the last 60 years we have spent Billions of Dollars on our lowest-achieving students, and virtually nothing on programs for Gifted Students.  </p>

		<p>America is deep, deep in debt and the Chinese have to loan more and more to America.  </p>
<p>America is becoming a screwed up place to live.  Where I live, it is hard to get a job unless you speak Spanish.  And the job ads are not shy about telling you, if you don&rsquo;t speak Spanish, then don&rsquo;t apply.  My neighbor sold her home and is moving back to Czech Republic.  And does anyone still call California the Golden State or Miami, Paradise.  People are often surprised at what they find when they come from abroad and arrive in an American city.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t expect foreign visitors to be &#8220;awed&#8221; however a lot of these Chinese complaining are just plain naive and silly. First of all, it is stupid to think that all Americans are rich and have servants. </p>
<p>&#8220;&ldquo;In the U.S. even the best dinners consist of an appetizer, a main course and dessert, but in China that would not be enough,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;During a banquet the food has to flow and there has to be at least a dozen dishes or so.&rdquo;There must also be meat &#8220;</p>
<p>Yes, but our meat isn&rsquo;t stir-fryed housecat. Yuck.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ldquo;Our Chinese scholar took a couple of symbolic bites, put the food down and didn&rsquo;t touch it again,&rdquo; said Wang. &ldquo;It was so embarrassing. The professor is such a prominent figure. He served what he thought was quality food.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>What he served was quality food in this culture. How ridiculous to travel to another country and judge their culture and food and such according to what you eat back home. Did I mention we don&rsquo;t eat cat????</p>
<p>&#8220;These days, she says, she thinks Chinese visitors subconsciously feel superior to &mdash; not awed by &mdash; Americans.&#8221;</p>
<p>They can think what they want but they wouldn&rsquo;t have the prosperity and jobs if our country hadn&rsquo;t given it to them. They wouldn&rsquo;t have had the flat screened TV&rsquo;s and gadgets if  WE hadn&rsquo;t invented them. They need not feel superior to anyone with their human rights violations etc. Oh and they eat cat?</p>

		<p>There are many Americans, especially older ones, that do not want to live in a big houses, too much upkeep, lawn mowing etc.. Also, there are certain liberal intellectuals that don&rsquo;t have tv&rsquo;s or gadgets or such because they don&rsquo;t believe in them and believe in a simple life. The vegetarian professor is likely one of them. However, China is a place where people eat all kinds of weird bugs, cats and live octupus. Yes, they eat the octupus while it is still alive, there is a restaraunt like this. There is a restaurant where you can pick out a live cat, have it killed and eaten fresh. Sorry but the Chinese are not in a position to feel superior to anyone. Whites created all the gadgets they enjoy.</p>

		<p>By reading this article I got the impression that the Chinese are more materialistic than Americans! As a Canadian, I find this hard to believe. </p>
<p>Anyways, since China has such a huge population and therefore requires a lot of resources to meet demand, I would not be surprised if they start moving in to 3rd world countries and South America. However, instead of being friendly (as was the case with most, not all, European explorers) I think that they will not take any stuff from their new subjects. Whereas the White world has traitorous intellectuals who lobby on behalf of non-whites, the Chinese will let everyone know who is the BOSS. Any complaints of mistreatment (it will most definitely occur under Chinese rule) will either be ignored or swept under the rug. </p>

		<p>Which is why it may become crucially important that State Laws NOT be overturned&hellip;</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
The President, furthermore, may grant pardon or reprieves, except in cases of impeachment. Originally, the pardon could be rejected by the convict. In Biddle v. Perovich, 274 U.S. 480 (1927), however, the Supreme Court reversed the doctrine, ruling that &#8220;[a] pardon in our days is not a private act of grace from an individual happening to possess power. It is a part of the Constitutional scheme. When granted it is the determination of the ultimate authority that the public welfare will be better served by inflicting less than what the judgment fixed.&#8221;[3]<br>
&gt;</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/338jylt" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/338jylt</a></p>
<p>&gt;<br>
The pardon power of the President ***extends only to offenses cognizable under federal law.*** However, the governors of most of the 50 states have the power to grant pardons or reprieves for offenses under state criminal law. In other states, that power is committed to an appointed agency or board, or to a board and the governor in some hybrid arrangement (in some states the agency is merged with that of the parole board, as in the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board). On at least two occasions, state governors  &mdash;  George Ryan of Illinois and Toney Anaya of New Mexico  &mdash;  have commuted all death sentences in their respective states prior to leaving office.[12]<br>
&gt;</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/yu6rrf" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/yu6rrf</a></p>
<p>From these two conditions, I would say that the limitations of a Presidential Pardon apply both to the nature of the offense and to it&rsquo;s ongoing status.</p>
<p>i.e.  A pardon DOES NOT render the act non-criminal and in no way diminishes or removes a legitimately held condition of guilt.  It doesn&rsquo;t even require a trial to be proven so, as Nixon himself proved.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, if a crime has multiple associated secondary offenses (welfare fraud and other assumptive social transfer payments) then THESE are not pardoned -at all-.</p>
<p>While, if a Federal crime is also a State crime, the Pardon can only extend as far as it would mitigate Federal prosecution.</p>
<p>The last one I&rsquo;m not too sure about but the first pair should stand up.  Provided &#8216;Immigration Reform&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t render State Law moot with some kind of Congressional endrun.</p>
<p>Which might very well mean civil dissolution if they make American&rsquo;s mad enough.</p>

		<p>I get the impression that these visiting Chinese scholars live very privileged lives indeed.  (China apparently believes in rewarding its professors of Marxist studies very well.)  After all, a more typical Chinese is working long hours in a factory for a few dollars a day and lives in a cramped apartment provided by the factory owner.  When I consider how super sized so many Americans are these days I can only imagine how grotesquely obese the Chinese will become if they think <i>we</i> eat inadequate quantities.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it is true that many individuals and (especially) the government have taken on dangerous levels of debt, while the Chinese are saving.  That and the export of most of our manufacturing overseas (replaced by nothing) does not bode well for the long term competitiveness of our country.  It also doesn&rsquo;t help that we keep importing so many people with IQs in the 70s, 80s and low 90s.  IQ has become such a forbidden topic that our politicians refuse to even consider the quality of the people we let in (that would have disparate impact), so pretend that a Haitian boat person makes just as good an American as a German engineer.</p>

<p>If the Chinese are really as superficial as that we may keep up with them yet.</p>
<p><i>There was no pool, and few modern amenities &mdash; fewer, in fact, than she was used to back home. &ldquo;I even have an HD flat-screen TV at home in Beijing,&rdquo; Zhang said, surprised that her American host did not.</i></p>
<p>He&rsquo;d be shocked even more to find that I don&rsquo;t have a TV at all.  Television is a tool to dumb down and control the populace.  My message to everyone reading this post, even those who hate those of use who are pro-white:  You have better things to do in your life than watch TV.</p>

		<p>I grew up in Claremont; the School of Theology, along with the other Claremont Colleges, is well-known for its quality and influence.  Just because some glorified exchange students felt impoverished while here doesn&rsquo;t make it so.  I visited Beijing 3 years ago and it was an extremely dirty city.  Traffic is horrendous and a LOT of people ride bikes.  There are military soldiers everywhere and the people I saw did not seem very affluent, as these students seem to be.  The suburban life I experienced in Claremont was much better than the crowded, dingy experience I had in China.</p>

		<p>With all the talk about an economic boom in China, it is still the case among the Chinese that only one or two adults in a hundred can own an automobile. In America, almost all adults can own an automobile. What does that say? Go fifty miles outside of Peking and they are still using oil lamps. Forget the glitz and see what the average folks are like. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a culture clash China in some ways is far ahead of the US.  When I first went to Shanghai in 2002, I couldn&rsquo;t believe that human beings could build on such a scale.  Note that I had been to Berlin,Paris as well as Los Angeles and New York before so I believe that I thought understood what a large city would look like.</p>
<p>There are so many huge and modern buildings in China that even industrialized areas such as Orange County California seem small and quaint by comparison.  For example in Ningbo if a building has the same footprint as a large manufacturing building in Orange County CA it would probably have three or four storeys versus the single story on an  equivalent building in Orange County.  Even in small to medium Chinese cities (1-4 million people) skyscrapers are far more common than they are here in the United States.</p>
<p>Another thing is that much of the new building in China has occurred within the last 10 years.  So everything is so new in China compared to the United States.  A prime example of this would be Pudong (an island next to Shanghai) which was essentially farm land and now has more skyscrapers than Century and probably all of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The public restrooms in the Shanghai public library are incredible they&rsquo;re so new and clean compared to comparable facilities in even the nicest American cities.   That&rsquo;s not to say China doesn&rsquo;t have it&rsquo;s problems but the areas of China that are developed are extremely well developed and new compared to cities in the US.  </p>
<p>One of the advantages to being a developing nation is that most of the infrastructure will be very new because it probably didn&rsquo;t exist before.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the Chinese scholars are being very arrogant they just come from a country where the developed areas are far more developed than here the US.  I think its hard for them to comprehend  the idea that anyone would house a prestigious university on a campus full of old small buildings.  <br>

		<p>I am not surprised here. The United States of America is becoming more and more third world like and Socialist while the People&rsquo;s Republic of China becomes more and more free market and First World. Economist Marc Faber wrote that except the White bread small towns, the U.S.A is more like a banana republic. For many Asians, the U.S.A is still a land full of large White prosperous families as it used to be some decades ago.  But when they come here they see loads of brown and black people (Madhuri Bhattacharya being an example) living in third world like conditions. No wonder they are shocked. For most Iranians, Chinese, Indians, Bangladeshi etc&hellip; a typical American family is White with loads of blond children. This transformation of the U.S.A had been planned many decades ago and things seem to be on course. The Chinese people worked for their interests and their prosperity while Americans gave it all away due to foolish ideas like multiracialism, multiculturalism, political correctness, admiration of black culture etc&hellip;<br>
For people who doubt China&rsquo;s prosperity, they need to see this</p>

<p>This I think is true. These marxist students are likely the cream of the crop and as such, unlike the millions of average or poor Chinese, and as such are rewarded by the government handsomely and live very well. There are certainly many elite Americans that would come to my humble abode(though I do have a flat screen and gadgets) and be horrified too.</p>

		<p>The Chinese ARE superior to us in many ways.  Firstly, their government doesn&rsquo;t despise and attack the people that made the country great.  The Han do not wring their hands impotently and whine about &#8220;yellow privilege.&#8221;  They care about building comfortable lives for themselves and their families.  Beijing, where I live, is a more modern and advanced city than any in the US.  The Chinese do not burn a large chunk of their GDP socially promoting the slowest and least competent, nor do they waste higher education on vast groups who are not suited to it.  </p>
<p>The comments about the Chinese serving &#8220;housecat&#8221; are ridiculous.  A middle class Chinese family has 5-7 dishes for every lunch and dinner.  Very often the food is bought fresh daily, and the vegetables and meat are of a very high quality.  Far better than the McFastfood our people eat.  </p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t believe the Chinese could have competed with the US of 1956.  But the hobbled, shamed, castrated and doomed US of today, where the National Council of the Race can dictate policy, is no match whatsoever for an intelligent, motivated, proud and ingenious people.</p>

		<p>In college I became friends with a foreign student who was from one of the more Westernized countries of the Middle East ( I won&rsquo;t tell you which one in order to protect my identity since I use my real name on here).  The reason I became such good friends with her was because I lived in her host country for a while since my dad was military. </p>
<p>Her country of origin, when I was over there, was definately backwards compared to Europe and America.</p>
<p>Anyways, when I became friends with this girl in college, there was a school holiday that came up, and I decided to let her come home with me for a week.  My parents live in a well to do neighborhood. I remember after her visit she was in awe.  She was constantly on the phone with her friends, telling them in her native language how nicely a lot of Americans live.</p>
<p>It was just half a year later when I was sitting with her in her cheap apartment on campus at the university we went to. I remember she was standing in her kitchen complaining about how &#8220;American homes don&rsquo;t have kitchens as nice as what are in my host country&#8221;.  I reminded her how just a few months earlier she was going on and on about how nice my parents&rsquo; house was.</p>
<p>I had spent a lot of time around her, and over time, her lower Middle Eastern IQ really started to show.  Here she was getting an engineering degree at an American university, but when I would observe her on a day to day basis, she came across as one of the least intelligent people I had ever met. </p>
<p>When we would go shopping together, she would just push her cart around the store, ramming into people as if she was oblivious that they were even there.  I looked at the looks on peoples&rsquo; faces in the store. They couldn&rsquo;t believe what they were seeing.</p>
<p>Anyways, to sum up my story, I always saw her as less intelligent than most white people I knew (even &#8220;red neck&#8221; whites who weren&rsquo;t &#8220;smart&#8221; enough to get engineering degrees supposedly).  But this last incident where she was complaining about the kitchens in American houses, was really the icing on the cake for me.</p>
<p>My whole point here is that, don&rsquo;t be surprised when upper class people come here from the Middle East, India, and China, acting like the people in the article above act. This whole attitude of &#8220;let me compare my upper class lifestyle in the Third World dump that I come from, to the lifestyle of the average American&#8221;. I thought Chinese people would be a little more intelligent about this sort of thing, but I guess not.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t forget that we&rsquo;re dealing with a very privileged elite, a tiny handful from China who live lifestyles that are far beyond the reach of the average citizen.  Along with their downright snotty attitudes, they bring unrealistic expectations.  If you want to get the real story about how China lives, go directly to China; you&rsquo;ll hardly be impressed.  It goes without saying, money can&rsquo;t buy you class.  The affluent diaspora that settled in southwest Canada aren&rsquo;t exactly blending in well with the native British Canadians.  Let alone the fact that they tend to embrace their own native language instead of English, they seem very fond of erecting huge, square, stone mansions that lack character and personal style, and contrast sharply with the surrounding old-world architecture with their English-style gardens.  No doubt the huge tacky mansions are filled with the latest gadgets guaranteed to numb the senses from the realities of life. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know that Chinese eat live octopus; the only time I&rsquo;ve had it was in Japan.  It was pretty good, but strange - the tentacles moving and the suckers still working while I chewed.  I had cat in Guangzhou, however, as part of the &#8220;Lion &amp; Dragon&#8221; dish.  It was pretty good (the &#8220;dragon&#8221; part is snake, also good).  My take on the Chinese penchant for ostentatious spending is that this behavior is quite typical of people who were recently impoverished.  When I was in China in 1987 - only a generation ago - nearly everyone cooked dinner on a charcoal-burning hibachi, and private ownership of automobiles was unheard-of.  Even motorbikes were extremely rare; everyone got around on identical ugly, black single-speed bicycles, which must have been quite miserable going up hills.</p>
<p>The obsessive spending on &#8220;bling&#8221; by American blacks is another excellent example of the same behavioral phenomenon; black parents - in the words of Bill Cosby - will spend $150 for a pair of athletic shoes for their kid, but won&rsquo;t spend $40 on &#8220;Hooked on Phonics&#8221;.  This is because for image management to be successful, the spending must be conspicuous.</p>

		<p>Of course, these &#8220;Chinese&#8221; do not mention that 1% of their population (of which they obviously are from) lives a lifestyle of total luxury, on the backs of the other 99% who live under conditions of grinding slavery.  I&rsquo;m sure a REAL representative of an AVERAGE Chinese person would marvel at such luxuries.</p>
<p>What these visitors are not saying is that consider the fact that Americans are not viciously exploiting the poor nor treating them as slaves etc., to be signs of weakness.  That is what they really mean.  Since there isn&rsquo;t a staff of a dozen people (from a different class) slaving away at their masters whim, they consider the host to be less then themselves. </p>
<p>What they came expecting to see was a dozen blacks laboring in the front yard with several Hispanic women cleaning the house, willing to wait on them hand and foot.  The only reason they could think of that their host wasn&rsquo;t doing this was that they were too poor to afford it.  It is beyond their understanding that other societies might choose not to exploit the poor.  Actually, many Chinese are learning this as they adopt Christianity (which is well on its way to taking over China).  One of the reasons it is suppressed and controlled.</p>

		<p>Miss Zhang&rsquo;s brag over her flat-screen TV set ignores the fact that there is precious little worth watching on US television.  Even the cable Science Channel has dumbed content down to a level that can best be described as &#8220;mind numbing stuff&#8221;.  The show &#8220;Punkin Chunkin&#8221; for instance in which people use catapults to fling pumpkins, purports to be a &#8220;science&#8221; show.  Watching this drivel on an expensive flat-screen TV set does not improve the content, so why spend the extra money?<br>

		<p>I can assure you all that the average Chinese person doesn&rsquo;t have a superiority complex. There is no &#8220;culture clash&#8221; here per se, it&rsquo;s just that these visitors from China had certain preconceptions about America that they expected to hold true. The USA is far wealthier than China, so the Chinese expected the lives of average Americans to be commensurately better than their own (which turned out not to be the case, at least from their perspective). What is being mistakenly interpreted as an heir of superiority is merely just surprise. </p>

<p>No, they do eat cats. I&rsquo;m not saying they eat cats on a regular basis at home, that isn&rsquo;t true. However,yes they do have restaurants that serve housecat. One restaurant I know of exists where you can pick out a live cat, they have a bunch in cages. It&rsquo;s killed and then you are served stir-fried cat. Much like lobster.</p>

In fact, only Cantonese eat cats, and Canton is only one out of over 30 provinces in China! Most Chinese only eat pork, chicken, beef, fish as most Americans do.

		<p>No, the average Chinese has never eaten cat OR dog, and you implied that it was a staple.  They live quite Western lives, and eat food you&rsquo;d be delighted to enjoy.  I&rsquo;ve seen many nasty meat items in rural areas  &mdash;  none of which makes it on to the normal Chinese table.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, these &ldquo;Chinese&rdquo; do not mention that 1% of their population (of which they obviously are from) lives a lifestyle of total luxury, on the backs of the other 99% who live under conditions of grinding slavery.&#8221;  You have your head in the ground.  The Chinese middle-class will soon be more numerous than all of the US, and is already huge.  Your comment might have been insightful over a decade ago, but is now way behind the times.  The average house in Beijing sells for almost $300k, meaning that millions and millions of people own something well out of the reach of most Americans. Please stop fooling yourself.  </p>
<p>Finally, there was a reference to Pudong, Shanghai being an island: it is not.  The island is Changming.  Pudong is on the east side (&#8220;Dong&#8221; means east) of the HuangPu.  As opposed to PuXi (&#8220;Xi&#8221; means west), or traditional Shanghai.</p>

		<p>True about the cats, Anonymous 35.  I did not have the opportunity to try it until I reached Guangzhou (a.k.a. Canton).  The other dishes I had (in Shanghai, Nanjing, Tienjin, Beijing and Guilin) were overwhelmingly pork and chicken.  The main eaters of dogs, I suspect are Koreans (and the dish is called kogoki, if I remember correctly.)<br>

<p>My point exactly. We can debate back and forth all day long about USA vs.China. Having seen for myself, there is truth from everyone. China does have a lot of poverty and people slaving away but a growing middle class and largely increased westernization. However, the point is why do so many Chinese still come to places like the USA, Canada or the UK. If China is so great, why aren&rsquo;t they ALL packing their bags to go home and why aren&rsquo;t NONE coming? Though some are leaving and/or not coming, there are still plenty that do to these countries. </p>

<p>Oh yes, more of the same&hellip;.these lies about how the Chinese invented  everything in ancient times and how most of our technology of today comes from the Japanese.  Everything that whites did in the middle was some how stolen from all other civilizations in the world.</p>
<p>Seriously, I am tired of this.  All these books on the history of science and technology must be lying to all of us by claiming white men invented at least 75% of the aforementioned things.</p>
<p>In regards to today, what do you mean by &#8220;invented by the Japanese&#8221;?  Did they invent cell phones, laptops, televisions, &hellip;&hellip;what did they invent?  Maybe you should say they improved our inventions.</p>
<p>In regards to where our products are made&hellip;what is your point?  Why is it that ever since we stopped making our own products the overall quality has gone down?</p>
<p>I agree that Asians have many qualities that whites lack, but this garbage about how they are just as inventive as we are is something I am never going to fall for.  I&rsquo;ll see it when I believe it.  Let&rsquo;s stop this self hating nonsense and focus on saving our people&hellip;okay?</p>

<p>Much of what is regarded as Western technology was imported from China such as gunpowder and the compass.  Let&rsquo;s not forget pasta too.   I&rsquo;m not saying one culture is superior to another but what I am saying is that cultures build upon one another.</p>
<p>If we really go back you could say Western society was probably imported from the Euphrates river valley because that&rsquo;s one location where agriculture emerged.</p>
<p>Culture builds upon itself and I think Western culture today is amalgalm of other cultures.  Of course you may ask why didn&rsquo;t China go to the moon first? I would argue that Asia deliberately repressed the development of technology because it&rsquo;s destabilizing.</p>
<p>A great example of this would be Japan.  The Japanese actually got rid of firearms because they were destabilizing.  </p>
<p> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearms_of_Japan" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearms_of_Japan</a></p>
<p>The societies that existed in Asia valued stability over change.  Another thing is the availability of metal.  It&rsquo;s a known fact that iron was simply more plentiful in Europe than in Asia.  </p>
<p>No society is superior to another all societies are simply adapted differently to their environment like creatures.  If an environment changes one adaption may rise to forefront.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s also look at technology.  I think it&rsquo;s been an utter disaster we are on the verge of using up most of our nautral resources within two generations.  Population has exploded to levels that would suggest some sort of crash is imminent.  In some ways technology is wonderful but in other ways its been an utter catastrophe,i.e. the BP oil spill.  Never before have we been &#8220;blessed&#8221; with the ability to destroy and deplete our environment and natural resources so quickly.</p>
<p>The Western model of unending geometric growth/resources consumption in it&rsquo;s current form is greatly flawed and will inevitably have catastrophic consequences for the entire human race.  </p>

		<p>As to what (White in China) says, yes Chinese food is good however there are some in some places that do eat cat or beetles so who are they to talk about our food. Most, about 95% of today&rsquo;s modern inventions came about as a result of White ingenuity. &#8220;Courtney&#8221; was right, Asians simply improved on it. Much Chinese prosperity comes from traitor Whites shipping the jobs over. So should they really feel superior?</p>
