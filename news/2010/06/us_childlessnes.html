			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hope Yen, San Francisco Chronicle, June 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nearly 1 in 5 American women beyond childbearing years never gave birth as fewer couples, particularly higher-educated whites, view having children as necessary to a good marriage.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The figures show that among all women ages 40-44, about 18 percent, or 1.9 million, were childless in 2008. That&rsquo;s up from 10 percent, or nearly 580,000 in 1976.</p>
<p>Broken down by race, roughly 20 percent of white women are childless, compared with 17 percent of blacks and of Hispanics and 16 percent of Asians. Still that gap has been narrowing: Since 1994, childlessness for blacks and Hispanics has grown by 30 percent, about three times the rate for whites.</p>
<p>{snip} After reaching a high of 3.7 children per woman during the baby boom, the U.S. fertility rate dropped to a historic low of 1.7 during the mid-1970s and stands at about 2.</p>
<p>The findings also come amid a historic demographic shift in which blacks, Hispanics, Asians and multiracial people are growing rapidly in the U.S. population and wielding more influence in politics and society. Minority babies now make up nearly half of all U.S. births.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While higher-educated women overall are more likely to be childless, that may be slowly changing. In 2008, about 24 percent of women ages 40-44 with a master&rsquo;s, doctoral or professional degree did not have children, a decline from 31 percent in 1994.</p>
<p>In the meantime, childlessness has risen sharply for women with less than a high school diploma  &mdash;  from 9 percent in 1994 to 15 percent in 2008.</p>
<p>Other findings:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>_More births are from women who never married. Among never-married women ages 40-44, about 56 percent were childless in 2008 compared with 71 percent in 1994.</p>
<p>_U.S. childless rates were somewhat similar, if not higher, compared with other industrialized nations. About 17 percent of U.S. women were childless at age 40, compared to 22 percent in England, and 17 percent in Italy and Ireland. The rates were between 12 percent and 14 percent for Spain, Norway, Denmark, Belgium and Sweden.</p>
<p>{snip} Figures for &#8220;white&#8221; refer to those whites who are not of Hispanic ethnicity.<br>

		<p>While other AmRen posters are bound to disagree, I wonder if the white person&rsquo;s ability to visualize and plan for the future might have some bearing on the declining number of white births. </p>
<p><br>
Planning to bring a white child into existence has to be a lot more disquieting today than it was even 32 or so years ago. </p>
<p><br>
In a country that is quickly becoming non-white, will today&rsquo;s white babies (and later, their own children) become serfs in their own homeland? </p>
<p>I pray not.</p>

		<p>Janelle, I think you are right.  I think part of the reason white people are not having as many babies as other groups is because of the rising number of non-whites.  Non-white people create different societies than white people do.  They certainly are not as pleasant, friendly or free.  As everyone knows the migration patterns have been for white people to move to other white populated areas and for non-whites to move to white populated areas.  White people create highly desirable areas to live.  When white people see an area become less desirable for them to live in they are less likely to bring a child into the world.</p>

		<p>White men are being denied the chance to marry white women and form families with them. High taxes to support non-white and illegal alien children, along with the exploding cost of living are a huge factor behind this. Another are white women themselves being trained to mate with non-whites and reject white men. Thirdly, unemployed and under employed white men are not attractive to women as marriage partners, and many white men are that way through no fault of their own. Anti-white male discrimination, and government policies are the reason for that, along with the intentional destruction of the manufacturing and construction sectors of the economy. Those are where many white men used to be able to support families without the wife working too, and without college degrees. More white women are college educated than white men now, and white women with degrees don&rsquo;t marry white men without them, Sandra Bullock not withstanding. I see a lot of white men either remaining single and childless, or resorting to marrying Asian or Mestizo women even though they would if they could marry a white women if they were available. For many white men, they are not, and many of them are not being prepared to be husbands and fathers either. </p>

		<p>A basic starter house in L.A., San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland&hellip; all way over $500,00.  Salaries are down. these prices were supported by funny business lending which white people don&rsquo;t trust right now. so without housing, without stable jobs, whites stop reproducing. </p>
<p>MEANWHILE&hellip; 90% of the livable areas of sd, sf, la are black or hispanic forcing whites into smaller and smaller pockets that cost more and more. </p>

<p>Absolutely. My wife and I are in our early 40s. We both have IQs in excess of 140.  We both hold master&rsquo;s degrees. We have good jobs and are financially secure. </p>
<p>Many years ago, we realized that the government and large corporations were steadfastly ruining the future existence of Whites and Western Civilization. We wanted to have children, but we decided against it and we stand by our decision. </p>
<p>We did not want to punish our unborn children by leaving them behind in a world that is far worse than it was for us when we were young.</p>
<p>We have numerous friends who made the same decision for the same reason.<br>
  <br>
As for me and my wife, our hearts grieve for our young nieces and nephews and what the future holds for them as miscegenation and amalgamation ultimately destroys all that was once wonderful about our civilization and culture.</p>

		<p>I think that much of the problem is the anti-male divorce laws now which allow the wife to summarily dismiss her husband and keep the children and much of the family wealth with no good reason.  Why should I sign up for a wife and children when unilateral no-fault divorce can destroy my life if she decides she is &#8220;unfulfilled?&#8221;  </p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s too much evil to bring a White baby into this world.</p>
<p>The race-relations and cultural situation must be solved first   &mdash;   at once   &mdash;   no matter what the cost. Then, and only then, would it be morally right to bring a precious White baby into the world.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is that anti-White politicians and educators must, without exception, be removed from all positions of power in White nations. White people must stand up and demand that their rights be fully respected. Whites must reclaim their nations. The monstrous cruelty of the present-day anti-White racial policy must be terminated for the good of all individuals and races. Only then will Whites be inclined to have more children.</p>

having to resurrect the white tribal tough streak.  I hope you folks that chose to refrain from procreating don&rsquo;t just sit on your earnings but use them to help those that want whites to persevere. Get involved.</p>

<p>In the LA area, where I live, safe White areas are becoming scarcer and scarcer.  It takes much more than $500,000 to live in a safe, White area in the LA basin.   I would posit that it takes closer to a million dollars, minimum  &mdash;  and even those areas are being relentlessly attacked by government &#8216;Housing Authorities&rsquo; hell-bent on moving in low-quality, urban hispanics and blacks via Section 8 vouchers.</p>
<p>It is no wonder that in my own neighborhood (nothing fancy but home prices are in the $700,00 range), my neighbors have installed 9-foot walls topped with cameras around their property, sophisticated, motion-activated alarm systems with yard signs stating &#8216;armed response&rsquo;, hair-trigger, vicious guard dogs to ward off strangers and signs with pictures of a .357 warning about the owner&rsquo;s intentions for any criminal he might catch breaking into his home.    </p>
<p>This will increase as Whites are displaced across the US.</p>
<p>Ask S. African Whites.  </p>
<p>And from Anon #5:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Many years ago, we realized that the government and large corporations were steadfastly ruining the future existence of Whites and Western Civilization. We wanted to have children, but we decided against it and we stand by our decision&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Many on this board will call you selfish.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, especially as I live in California on the front line of the War on Whites and Western Civilization and work in government schools where Whites are presented as evil and inhuman, which I believe will eventually lead to White genocide by non-Whites when their numbers are large enough.</p>
<p>I fear for my own White children every single day as I see Whites locked out of high-paying careers, college admissions, crushed under an onerous tax burden, stifled by PC laws that prevent us from speaking out, the fact that we are not covered by Civil Rights or Hate Crimes Laws and disallowed from forming advocacy groups to seek redress or promote White Rights. </p>
<p>And, if obama is voted in for a second term, things will get a lot worse for Whites. </p>
<p>And, for those who wonder what our future holds</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Some 40 percent of ALL births in the U.S. are now paid for by the Medicaid program. Most of these Medicaid-funded births occur to never-married women with low education levels. Once the taxpayer has paid for the childbirth, aid to the mother and child will generally continue through a wide variety of programs for years to come. Most of this aid takes the form of unconditional welfare assistance in which the taxpayer is required to support the recipient but the recipient is required to do little or nothing in exchange for the aid&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/236f3d2</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see, fewer White births, an explosion of welfare births combined with massive non-White, Third World immigration?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not difficult to peer into or extrapolate the future for Native Born White Americans: Displacement followed by elimination of those remaining.</p>
<p>Bon</p>
<p>&#8220;Whites living in societies run by non-Whites are in physical danger.&#8221;</p>

		<p>What all this boils down to is avarice and personal selfishness on the part of Middle Class Whites and, to a somewhat lesser extent, Working Class Whites too.</p>
<p>I notice, Middle Class non-Whites have no misgivings about bearing three or more offspring.</p>
<p>We can use the fact that there is a concerted effort by the political elite and global coroporate establishments to ethnically cleanse White human beings from the planet as a reason for not wishing to bring future progeny into the world. This mindset applied logically means, in actual fact, that we are inadvertently aiding and abetting the criminal elite in their task of global genocide against our people.   </p>
<p>However, the way to overcome the genocidal plan of the global elite and their corporate conspirators, is not to meekly accept their socially engineered criminal act of genocide, but to join organisations and campaign against its combined said perpetrators not just verbally but physically like I have done.  This also necessitates procreating prolifically until it hurts yes, even our finances.  Anything less, is failure to step up to the mark and play one&rsquo;s part in rescuing our race from orchestrated racial annihilation.</p>
<p>I acknowledge and support also, the necessity of using threats to accomplish our goals where it is advantageous and imperative to do so.  In other words, we must rediscover our collective backbone and acquire a revigourated sense of ruthlessness.  The killer instinct, if you like!<br>

		<p>There may be a breathing space interval.  You see, when you chop up and hyperextend the reproductive cycles, the resulting cohort overlap also changes.  This is generally bad for the stability of the indigene population in the face of massive immigration by Mestizos who have, nominally, a 2.82 TFR (compared to 2.4 at home) and are willing to work as wage slaves at any degrading labor available.</p>
<p>But, if Generation 1 has kids 20+ years after nominally optimum reproductive maturity date can push out -their- kids&rsquo; (Gen-2) reproductive window of adulthood farther too.</p>
<p>Then these &#8216;late blooming&rsquo; parent&rsquo;s can keep their kids secure through their own accumulated wealth until they grow up and there is a huge flush of job openings coming available as said parental generation are much closer to retirement.</p>
<p>This could have effects similar to a plague in that you could see a major renaissance in both lower level economic scalings and a general reduction in the overall population age.</p>
<p>The key?  Control immigration, _now_.  Let elderly white folk age out of the demographic pool as social security fades as a tax burden with them.</p>
<p>Shrink the infrastructure down as much as possible.</p>
<p>And prepare the way for the generation after next with a much more streamlined, higher IQ, higher paying, _high tech_ societal buildup, after the bottoming out that is the end of 20th century cultural apathy but NOT the end of 21st century white culture.</p>
<p>My biggest worries are what happens to the social values of kids who grow up without full time fathers (the &#8216;Nordic Style&rsquo; system of anti-marriage reproduction in Sweden, with mothers fully supported by the state, shows major maturity regressions and adolescent difficulties for kids born to single parent households as being &#8216;one of the few known debilitating factors&rsquo;&hellip;).  I don&rsquo;t want to ingrain an aculturated black K-breeder parenting ideal in whites.</p>
<p>And of course, what happens when these late kids hit maturity in the early 2030s and find that Hispanics, Asians and Others have already filled the jobs they SHOULD now have dominance in.  If they were 30 instead of 20.</p>
<p>Again, we MUST stop the Elites from flooding the nation with yet more unwanted immigrants.  These are OUR LANDS.</p>

		<p>In all honesty when I go out in New York and see stunning White women straight out of Leighton paintings in the arms of some muscular mulatto I really want to die, or when I see the White men wearing dreadlocks holding onto their petite Asian princesses. It hurts me, a lot. I&rsquo;m not even sure what there is to save anymore, I&rsquo;ve seem to have lost trust in all my fellow Whites, I pretty much expect white women to have any shade of black boyfriend and white guys to have Indian or Asian girlfriends.</p>

		<p>To Janelle and WhiteIsRight,</p>
<p>your argument that whites refuse to give birth to white babies because of the fear and pessimism that is caused by an increasing number of non-whites sounds plausible at first, but the reality proves that this is by far not the only factor. <br>
For the readers of Amren it might be, but I think that the overwhelming rest of the white society doesn&rsquo;t even realize that they are sitting on a sinking boat. By your logic, all white countries that are still overwhelmingly white in their population should have a higher birth rate - but this is not the case if you look at the actual figures. Eastern European countries provide a prime example for ethnic homogeneity and low birth rates. Look at Japan: This country is not threatened to be taken over by non-Japanese in the distant future, and yet the Japanese have one of the lowest birth rate on earth. I&rsquo;d say that the opportunity costs of having children (the foregone time, comfort and career opportunities), coupled with the anxiety to take responsibility for kids in a hostile environment contributes to the decision against having children, especially for high-IQ people.</p>

		<p>I agree with the posters who pointed out that minorities are having babies left and right.  I live in NYC.  You cannot walk out of your house without seeing a latina woman pushing a baby carriage with 2-3 small ones in tow.</p>
<p>The Asians also all have babies, but you never see more than 2 per mother.  I must tell you that except for one Italian I know who just had a baby (in his late 40s) I cannot remember this time, IN THE LAST TEN YEARS, that I have seen a white mother and baby here in Queens.</p>
<p>In Manhattan there&rsquo;s a couple of white enclaves filled with urban yuppies and other metrosexual types, and you see a lot of gays or young bohemian couples who are shacking up, but there are still few if any white children to be seen.  (Compare with walking around the south bronx or southern queens where non-whites are all over the place!)</p>
<p>In my neighborhood, which is considered a &#8216;good&rsquo; neighborhood with ridiculously expensive houses, there are only TWO white kids in a five block radius.  Only 50% of the houses are owned by whites, and nearly all of them are old people.  The rest are owned by asians of one kind or another, and the odd latino or black here and there, but very rare.  They all have kids and are young.</p>
<p>I keep telling people that you have to see current trends and extrapolate 10, 20, 30 years down the road and realize that in 30 years it&rsquo;s game over.  While it may take a couple decades more for the country to disintegrate, the rule of whites is history.</p>

		<p>The only thing needed to solve the white birth rate problem is separation.  If whites separate, all of the factors suppressing white birthrate will vanish (especially if a white government institutes rewards for those who create large, healthy WHITE families).</p>
<p>The issue very much is welfare.  Every productive white has a dozen or more children he is responsible for via tax money stolen from him and re-directed via welfare.  So much so that he cannot afford to have a large family himself.</p>
<p>We live under de facto slavery.  Whites need to wake up to that and refuse to cooperate.  The only reason our elites ARE elites is because they rest on our backs.  They have gotten soft and more than a little insane.  They think they can maintain what they are in a non-white world.  That is not true and a grim fate awaits them if ever they succeed.</p>
<p>The solution is to make sure they understand that.  That they get that their fate is tied to ours.  Their wealth and power depends on us.  Non-whites have nothing to offer them except a place in a cannibal&rsquo;s stewpot&hellip;..that is LITERAL, not figurative.  Think Nigeria (cannibalism) or Mexico (human sacrifice).</p>
<p>It is often said that whites need to wake up.  But is that really true.  It&rsquo;s the elites that need to wake up.  Few in number but as they go, so do we all.  For better or for worse, our fates are tied together.</p>

		<p>The very frequent miscegenation doesn&rsquo;t help either. People are people, they will always be people, if they see someone that is attractive within their career-field or education range they&rsquo;re probably going to bunk down. Before I was aware this is how I thought, I never thought about race. Your average White doesn&rsquo;t care if that handsome black hunk paralegal is white or not, or if that pretty petite Indian grad student is white or not, people get lonely. I get pretty lonely even just looking for a racially aware female. </p>

<p>How can this ever happen? The federal, state, and local governments are armed to the teeth and they have their loaded guns aimed squarely at the heads of White Americans while they dictate to us:</p>
<p>  &mdash;   You WILL go to school with minorities!<br>
  &mdash;   You WILL hire and/or work with minorities!<br>
  &mdash;   You WILL lease, rent, and/or sell to minorities!<br>
  &mdash;   You WILL live with minorities!<br>
  &mdash;   You WILL procreate with minorities!<br>
  &mdash;   You WILL tolerate violent crimes commited against your families and friends by minorities!<br>
  &mdash;   You WILL move aside and make way for minorities!</p>
<p>The so-called civil rights policies of the past 50+ years have been designed to ruin and end the non-Hispanic White race! How can anyone deny the truth of this?</p>

<p>The arguments here about not having kids all seem&hellip; self-defeating.  You&rsquo;re not having children because of the world they&rsquo;ll grow up in?  What a joke.  If all whites had lots of children and taught all of them about the importance of race like I plan to, the world they grew up in would be a lot better.  </p>
<p>The world is what WE make it.  What reality denying liberals or the other races with much lower IQs do is irrelevant to us, or is anyone here going to try and argue that we &#8220;need&#8221; them?  Or that people whose collective intelligence doesn&rsquo;t reach past the double digits are somehow holding us back.  White separation is already achieveable in the US.  All it would take is a couple of likeminded families moving into the same area.  </p>
<p>Excuses for not having white kids are exactly that - Excuses.</p>

		<p>I am a young woman in my 20s who has just discovered the true nature of feminism. Last year I resolved to place my domestic before my career goals, and I will be finishing my degree soon and looking to switch the focus. All around the Western world a small number of white women are waking up to reality, seeing their mothers and aunts cheated out of fufillment as they tried to compete with men for fame they did not really desire. Just a my professor said &#8220;The desire for children is there, but there is nothing she [her daughter] can do. She has to keep working towards her degree.&#8221;</p>
<p>You have all summed up the greatest obstacle to young men and women like myself: anti-white society. How will we be able to bare our children being cheated out of opportunities on their own soil? </p>
<p>Sure, we can probably secure the future of one or two of our children, but what to do if you want more than one or two? </p>

		<p>The point of the article is that black and Hispanic women are becoming more like whites in regard to numbers of children.  As minority groups become more middle class and/or Americanized, this trend will continue.  As states continue to disallow welfare increases for additional children or to tighten up eligibility, more decipients will be willing to use contraception.  More women are working, which makes it harder to handle several children.  <br>
Whites are still a majority and have the power, through voting, to sweep out the liberals and institute the laws we want.  </p>

Stay White.&#8221; She&rsquo;s not likely to come running to you as her savior but it will make them both know there are racially-aware White males around. Of course this may end up with the muscular mulatto wanting to fight.

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;I plan to have at least four children(hopefully more) by the time I&rsquo;m in my thirties and I just hit twenty last year.</p>
<p>The arguments here about not having kids all seem&hellip; self-defeating. You&rsquo;re not having children because of the world they&rsquo;ll grow up in? </p>
<p>The world is what WE make it&hellip;.Excuses for not having white kids are exactly that - Excuses&hellip;</p>
<p>While I admire your mien and spirit, your concerns about Whites, what you write is naive and short sighted.</p>
<p>But, as you are only 20, you are forgiven and I will go easy on you.</p>
<p>You have not had enough life experience to know what we older Whites have had to put up with in the real world, what we wouldn&rsquo;t want to subject precious White children to.</p>
<p>Let me explain:</p>
<p>You have not had the experience of having to comfort your beautiful, precious White child, while she&rsquo;s having a nuclear meltdown because yet another &#8216;prestigious&rsquo; university turned her down for admission  &mdash;  even though she was the Salutatorian of her high school class, earned scores over the 95th percentile on the SAT I and II, 5s on the APs (except for a 4 on Calculus CD), knowing that non-Whites far below her in ranking received not only early admission to these same universities but accolades, awards and scholarships including full rides.</p>
<p>What do you tell your beautiful White daughter when she keeps sobbing:  &#8220;Mom, what did I do wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t had the experience in the workplace of being passed over for promotions and plumb assignments (or worse) being displaced for a lesser qualified non-White.   </p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t had the miserable experience of watching decade after decade as mediocre non-Whites teachers are honored, fawned over, showered with accolades, honors, handed checks of $10,000, gifted with expensive out of state trips to attend black/hispanic conferences paid for in full by the school district.  In almost 30 years, in several different schools, I have never, not once, witnessed a White teacher honored at the end of the year (or any other time).</p>
<p>Not Once.</p>
<p>Who do I complain to about injustices I witness against Whites, including White children every single day? Which White Advocacy group can I turn to that will redress the wrongs that we Whites must &#8216;suck up.&rsquo;  The EEOC, DOJ will not defend me or my children  &mdash;  yet blacks/Asians/hispanics have an army of well-funded defenders that are only too happy to sue us Whites out of existence for any perceived comment or slight.</p>
<p>That the entire K-12 government school curricula is anti-White is not in dispute, so be prepared to either home school your children or counter the White-hate propaganda they&rsquo;ll be exposed to every single day  &mdash;  as they&rsquo;re forced to kow-tow and honor non-White holidays, traditions, customs and cultures not their own.</p>
<p>The world is NOT &#8216;what we make it&rsquo; and hasn&rsquo;t been for several decades now.  There has been a sea change politically, academically, intellectually and in the media as an anti-White hostile elite has &#8216;marched through the institutions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The world they have created is in their interests, for themselves, a reflection of their DNA, their history and experiences, not ours.  They lobbied (and finally won), in the early 60s, the legal right to flood this country with low-IQd non-Whites and continue to demand, to this day, we accept ever-more massive numbers of low-quality, welfare dependent immigrants/refugees in an era of high unemployment.  This was done explicitly to make us Whites a powerless minority and to strip our wealth from us.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s working, just as planned.</p>
<p>The powerful media, government and academia explicitly present Whites as inhuman evil racists  &mdash;  as genocidal colonists, slave holders, enforcers of JIm Crow and apartheid and Nazis, always Nazis. I believe there will eventually be genocide against &#8216;inhuman&rsquo; Whites (after our wealth is stripped away, of course) as there was in the old Soviet Union and is happening now against Whites in SA.  </p>
<p>Populations under duress do not reproduce themselves and I believe this is the case with American Whites.</p>
<p>We are not making &#8216;excuses&rsquo; as to why we&rsquo;re not having children; US society has become one where (r)-based, fecund, welfare-dependent non-Whites are able to produce child after child that is subsidized by the government via crushing taxes imposed on productive Whites.</p>
<p>To the government, you are an expendable Kulak!  Good only to pay for and as cannon fodder for endless overseas wars and to support a massive, seething non-White underclass.</p>
<p>This is the world your White children will be born into.</p>
<p>Good luck to you and I wish you all the best  &mdash;  and I mean that sincerely!</p>
<p>Bon</p>
<p>&#8220;Whites living in societies run by non-Whites are in physical danger.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;I think that much of the problem is the anti-male divorce laws now which allow the wife to summarily dismiss her husband and keep the children and much of the family wealth with no good reason. Why should I sign up for a wife and children when unilateral no-fault divorce can destroy my life if she decides she is &ldquo;unfulfilled?&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>This is very very true. But the bigger issue is most american women have let their minds get completely vapid and materialistic. I call them class 1 observers. They are bred to shop and will never create an original thing to society. Who wants women like these? I sure dont. </p>
<p>Second, look at TV. Why on earth does Kim and Khloe Kardashian have million dollar paying TV shows? They were nobodies and not even attractive. Answer: They date exclusively BLACK MEN. Why does Kendra have her own show? She married a BLACK MEN. This message is what GOVERNMENT wants to give to white women - that black men are somehow ok or normal. they dont mention the 67,000 black on white rapes every year. or the murders. or the eating their young. Or the collapase of egypt when micegenation destroyed the pure white race there. doesn&rsquo;t take a genius. But out at the beach I walked past a TWO twenty year old black men with FOUR 14 year old white girls. &#8220;She doesnt like me cause I&rsquo;m black&#8221; one of them hissed at me. DAMN RIGHT. AND I DONT LIKE YOU RAPING OUR DAUGHTERS.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re young and naive. The U.S. government can send heavily armed agents over to your house at any time they choose to seize your property, your bank accounts, your children, and haul you away and imprison you for life. They routinely do far worse stuff than that.</p>
<p>Having beloved children gives the government additional leverage with which to brutally control and terrorize you and your family. NO THANKS!</p>
<p>Remember, you are OWNED by the federal government. You are forced to work and give them your money! We all are. There is nowhere to escape from their tyranny. Carefully consider what you are doing to your unborn children.<br>

<p>It&rsquo;s a key to understanding the process of whites&rsquo; displacement or gradual extinction in America. The pattern here is clear: just like invasive plant (say, eucalyptus in CA) sheds litter (leaves, bark) that decimates other plants and sucks out all water from the soil so that other plants cannot survive drought, the assertive minorities (e.g., &#8220;Latinos&#8221;) crowd us out of the country of ours that neither they not their ancestors had build.<br>

		<p>We live in a &#8220;comsummerist&#8221; paradise where self-worth and position in society is determined by what we consume.  This is the end result of 50 years of advertising, marketing, and propaganda.  Having children impairs the ability to consume - as child rearing is itself a conmercialized activity which extracts many thousands of dollars from parents during the first 18 years of a child&rsquo;s life.  We are a soulless society, largely speaking.  Secular people question the benefits of child rearing because they have no connection beyond themselves - and accordingly are not willing to sacrifice for the preservation of their culture and people.  If anyone knows how to reverse this trend, let&rsquo;s hear it.</p>

<p>  Young I may be, naive I am certainly not.  Lets pretend for a second that I buy into the fact that the federal government is against us and the cards are stacked in the opposing team&rsquo;s favor(and I&rsquo;ll admit that in many cases this does seem to be the entirely factual).  So what?  At risk of repeating myself, that is completely and utterly irrelevant to everything white nationalists and separatists claim they&rsquo;re trying to achieve.</p>
<p>  The outright hostility of government supported groups like SPLC and co. might make what we&rsquo;re trying to do(which even we aren&rsquo;t quite sure what that is) a lot harder, but it is by no means impossible.</p>
<p>  If you want to fade quietly into the night, by all means go right ahead.  Don&rsquo;t expect every other racially aware white to follow you, however.  Lots of us would rather stick around and fight it out until the end.  Ironically your passing hand comments of &#8216;suck it up&rsquo; are quite possibly the best advice you can give to any racially aware white.

<p>  Oh, and as an unrelated side note - the prevalence of non-whites and other undesirable conditions is no excuse to not have kids.  The Puritans who first settled America lived in conditions any modern American would accurately describe as hell on Earth, and if I remember correctly they had the highest TFR in all of recorded history.</p>

		<p>The Left has been peddling an &#8216;over-population&rsquo; scare for years but naturally the need for lower birth-rates applies only to whites, not the other races.<br>
Promoting the sterile cult of homosexuality is another means by which the Left seeks to reduce the white nations.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;In all honesty when I go out in New York and see stunning White women straight out of Leighton paintings in the arms of some muscular mulatto I really want to die&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet you say nothing. Why not look the female straight in the eye and say &ldquo;Stay White, baby. Stay White.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Reminds me of a funny story. I was a GI stationed in Germany, walking down town at night with another GI. We came upon a black off duty soldier walking closely with two white German women. We were just walking by but the black guy spoke to us. He goes, &#8220;I only like white women. I don&rsquo;t like white men&#8221;. I thought it was funny or thought myself funny and said, &#8220;I hope not&#8221; with a laughing inflection in my voice. My friend didn&rsquo;t think it was funny and said to me &#8216;leave them alone&rsquo; or &#8216;lets go&rsquo;. That idea was funny too. It was two guys vs one. Well, maybe it was three vs two. Anyway, it was funny twice and we hadn&rsquo;t even had a beer yet. </p>

		<p>Those of you who never had children are one reason Whites are in the demographic conundrum we&rsquo;re in. Yeah, things are hostile out there for Whites, and they&rsquo;re getting worse due largely because of our dwindling population. But our dwindling population is due to tons of White people taking your attitude. The point to having children is not to raise them in a perfect environment where a rosy future is guaranteed. The point to having children is to continue YOUR family line, and to hopefully raise individuals who will try and fight to leave the world in better shape than when they came into it. The European peoples and their descendants have faced formidable enemies, from outside forces, biological forces, and even our own in-fighting, for millenia, yet we have still survived. The notion that because Western governments, academia, and popular culture have been infiltrated by anti-White forces for the past few decades is reason to throw in the towel is ridiculous. That should make you want to fight more. I pray my generation of Whites can take back what you selfish and lazy Boomers and Xers have helped destroy: White America.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t the non-reproducing defeatists here realize demographic trends CHANGE?  Many non-whites are having fewer kids; who saw that coming? Movements to end birthright citizenship and crack down on illegals are gaining momentum.  Those of you who don&rsquo;t know any white couples with babies need to get out more.  As a father of three beautiful white children in the midwest I see plenty of white families with three or more kids at family oriented hotels, our Catholic church, etc.  Those who rationalize that the future will be worse are afraid of something that isn&rsquo;t guaranteed to happen.  Be brave.  Our ancestors were.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t know how right you are.  I&rsquo;ve worked in ublic schools (after years in private schools) for several years now.  Every single young white teacher is so indoctrinated with the white guilt thing it&rsquo;s uncanny.</p>
<p>Every U.S. History class is focused on nothing more than the history of oppression against group X,Y or Z.  I mean - that&rsquo;s it.  No more stories of courage, heroism or sacrifice by the original founders of this land.  It&rsquo;s all just who got pushed around by whitey and how they perservered to become triumphant today.</p>
<p>English classes in high school and junior high now read ONLY books by racial activists or by foreign writers.  (Maus, Maya Angelou books, West Indian authoers, etc)</p>
<p>The funny thing is, whenever bad cultural practices of minority villains are mentioned, there is no wider significance given.  The black male character raped that girl because, well, that&rsquo;s just what happened and we move on.  But it&rsquo;s &#8216;ol whitey who is the ultimate guilty party for keeping the people down with his evil multinationals.</p>

		<p>All one has to do is look at the hipster scene in NYC to see why bringing a white kid into the world now is a questionable opinion. I&rsquo;d much rather let my line die out in peace and spend the rest of eternity in solitude than die knowing what could happen to my descendants. I&rsquo;m sure many of our ancestors would have. Sometimes when I see a particularly pretty blue eyed child I pray for nuclear war so that she doesn&rsquo;t have to know about the legions of white women doing interracial porn. I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; It&rsquo;s complete chaos. Nothing but chaos. Only God can help us now.</p>

		<p>I just turned 30 a few days ago.  I am female, engaged to be married to a White man, and already have a bachelor&rsquo;s and a JD under my belt.  While I also worry about the world I would bring any potential children into, I personally very much want children anyway and prefer to be optimistic.  I&rsquo;d like at least two children, but perhaps 3 or 4, although I realize that biology is somewhat against me due to my age.  </p>
<p>I felt &#8220;ready&#8221; to have children in my late 20&rsquo;s and badly want them right now. What keeps me from having children?  Cost.  I have a decent paying professional job, but we still can&rsquo;t afford a baby, and we can&rsquo;t afford for only one of us to work while the other takes care of the children.  NonWhites don&rsquo;t plan for children like Whites do, and when these unplanned children arrive, the government pays for everything.  No one is paying for my planned, and very much wanted, children, except for us.  That is why the White birthrate is declining.  Whites want children, but plan for them, and raising them responsibly (i.e. the &#8220;White&#8221; way) takes resources that are being given to nonWhites instead.  </p>
<p>I know many White couples were are in their late 20&rsquo;s/early 30&rsquo;s and facing the same dilemma.  I think if the cost of living and childcare were lower, then suddenly there would be a White Baby Boom.  I know I&rsquo;d try my best to be pregnant tomorrow if that were the case-  ;)  Cost is the ONLY thing keeping us from starting our family.  </p>

		<p>Quote  &#8220;Absolutely. My wife and I are in our early 40s. We both have IQs in excess of 140. We both hold master&rsquo;s degrees. We have good jobs and are financially secure. </p>
<p>Many years ago, we realized that the government and large corporations were steadfastly ruining the future existence of Whites and Western Civilization. We wanted to have children, but we decided against it and we stand by our decision. </p>
<p>We did not want to punish our unborn children by leaving them behind in a world that is far worse than it was for us when we were young.</p>
<p>We have numerous friends who made the same decision for the same reason.</p>
<p>As for me and my wife, our hearts grieve for our young nieces and nephews and what the future holds for them as miscegenation and amalgamation ultimately destroys all that was once wonderful about our civilization and culture&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Really, so you lay down instead of fight? I don&rsquo;t think your anscestors did&hellip;You are genetically dead..you may as well kill yourselves now. I came to this realization and have since had my first child and planning another.I love my people, I love my race, I love our civilization. I moved from a &#8216;unicultural&rsquo; (white) area of the country to a multicultural area of the country and am now planning to move BACK!!!! Consolidate and propigate (lol) so to speak. Yes there are currently &#8216;problems&rsquo; but I don&rsquo;t plan for my people to go the way of the dinosaurs. <br>
Our (white) anscestors have endured more&hellip;from disease, starvation, natural disasters, genocidal invading armies, genocidal armies in new territories that we expanded to, religious/culteral wars&hellip;etc And you want to lay down now? Your grandfathers/mothers are ashamed.<br>

		<p>Middle-Class AND Working-Class Whites ought to be prepared to lower their materialistic expections and place the emphasis on procreating as the pursuit of materialism alone could be said to be the main reason they&rsquo;re not procreating in sufficient numbers.</p>
<p>When needs must, White nationalities have always summoned up common sense AND with it their innate gift of ingenuity in both creating and undertaking DIY projects for the purpose of enchancing their living conditions and environment, and in making ends meet where hardship has compelled them to learn to cut their cloth according to their means, in the past.</p>
<p>It looks very much like it&rsquo;s going to take one almighty economic crash to rekindle that spirit once again.<br>

Part of the problem is the brainwashing of Whites, who are more altruistic of any other race; there are many of us who believe that the world is over-populated and that there are finite resources.  </p>
<p>While this may or may not be true, why would the race that offers the most promising solutions to future problems of dwindling resources and infrastructure breakdown cull their population?  </p>

		<p>Okay, so now I have read all comments.  I noticed that the most negative comments are coming from people who live in places like New York and California, and also those who are employed in the educational system.</p>
<p>What does that say to you?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re environment is poisoning you.  Advice: move somewhere that is more homogeneously White.</p>
<p>And please refrain from commenting if you are just going to be doom and gloom.  Why not just cut your wrists now and have done with it?  That&rsquo;s the message that you are giving out.</p>
<p>I applaud the young people on here that want to have children and who have courage, tenacity and hope for the future.  Sure it will be difficult, but look at what the Pilgrims had to deal with, and the Boers in South Africa.  They just didn&rsquo;t lay down and die and sacrifice all on a silver platter to the Indians and Blacks.</p>

		<p>Why plan at all? A white baby boom from young, unmarried whites could be the best thing to happen for White America since the polio vaccine. Have those babies! Have them in rapid bursts, four or five in succession. Then get on public assisstance; it&rsquo;s White tax money  &mdash;  why *shouldn&rsquo;t* it go to help white mothers and their white infants? And don&rsquo;t complain that having millions of new bastards is not an acceptable solution for your delicate Christian sensibilities. Would you feel better knowing that all your tax money is going to an unmarried 15 year old mestizo, or a 13 year old black?</p>
<p>We all know this country is going to be swallowed alive by debt, default, and civil unrest. Having five or more white kids to each white woman is necessary! What happens after that is that eventually, things sort themselves out, a new society is formed, and LIFE MOVES ON. Life always moves on, and I want it to be as white as biologically possible.</p>

		<p>I remember the old days, Mom stayed home and took care of the household, and Dad worked and made enough money to support the household.</p>
<p>Nowdays, I guess the man doesn&rsquo;t make enough money or maybe doesn&rsquo;t work, and the woman wants to work or has to work.  Men don&rsquo;t make much money because women are being paid more so maybe that&rsquo;s why Mom is no longer around to make a house a home.  Whatever, it seems the woman walked out on the family and those baby-boom days are forgotten.  Too busy or confused to have kids.</p>

How easy do you think it was for white parents to have children on the frontier?  Before there was electricity or modern medicine?  Before there was any form of welfare? During the Depression?</p>
<p>If its so hard for whitey to have children today why are ever larger numbers of non-whites also remaining childless?  Seems to me it has to do with attitude.</p>

<p>Bon, the fact of the matter is that neither one of us knows what the future holds, and for you to go on and make these gloomy assumptions that you view as unalterable certainties doesn&rsquo;t help your credibility or, more importantly, our cause.  </p>
<p>With that being said, I think we can agree on a few things.  First of all, the future looks grim for the White race (especially here in the USA).  Chances are that my generation will have it worse than yours.  Does that mean we will certainly have it worse than you did? No.  I think that is the main point.  </p>
<p>I have far more dystopian feelings than you probably think.   I too was prevented opportunities to get into elite colleges due to my race, just as your daughter was.  I can appreciate that your daughters college rejections had a profound effect on your family.  They should have, because they were completely unjust.  Yet, almost all of us (probably even many people your age) have been locked out of college/career opportunities because we are White.  We just don&rsquo;t spend our time repeating the same sad story (twice, thrice, four times) ad nauseum.  </p>
<p>Finally, some of us have had WORSE things happen than those involving college/job acceptances because of our White skin.  </p>
<p>I find it interesting that you didn&rsquo;t even bother to respond to Anonymous 19/41 who was just trying to hammer home his/her point.  Maybe they got parts of the message across better than I did, and maybe they deserve a response.</p>
<p>Bon: &#8220;But us older folks trying to make you aware of what you will face are &lsquo;self-defeating&rsquo; to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Your most ridiculous sentence yet.  Trying to make us aware????? The mere fact that we read this site, agree with it, and comment on the articles should give you a clue that we are FAR more aware than the overwhelming majority of young Americans.  Maybe you should spend your time talking to those who really need to be woken up.<br>

		<p>Adding onto my previous post (#48), it&rsquo;s not so much planning as in &#8220;waiting for the perfect time&#8221; to have a baby, or waiting until we are &#8220;ready.&#8221;  No one is ever really &#8220;ready&#8221; to have a baby.  While I can&rsquo;t speak for everyone in my demographic, for my fiance and I, it&rsquo;s purely a dollars and cents issue.  I live in the Seattle area, where the cheapest daycare around for an infant is $800 a month.  I have to work, because otherwise we are unable to pay my onerous student loan payment.  Rent already is $845/month, and my fiance is currently in school, and therefore working part time, so yeah&hellip;..just not enough money to go around.  Affordable daycare is a really big issue that no one ever seems to talk about.  Of course, if I was nonWhite, it would be paid for, no questions asked.  However, because I decided to better myself and my family&rsquo;s future, I am now being punished in the form of high student loan payments which are unremitting.  I realize I took these loans out myself, and no one forced a gun to my head&hellip;.but aren&rsquo;t I someone, as a White, educated person, that we as a society WANT to reproduce, as opposed to the illiterate illegals/criminals?!  We are essentially breeding ourselves out of a functioning society.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure eventually we will have children; I will be getting some raises within the next few years, and my fiance won&rsquo;t be in school forever.  But I find it truly troublesome that we seem to, as a society, be encouraging the exactly WRONG sort of people to breed.  Our nation will be almost unrecognizable in 50 years because of this-</p>
