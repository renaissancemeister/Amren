<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The prospect of going through chemotherapy for a second time and needing a transplant is daunting to anyone, but it&rsquo;s especially harrowing if {snip} you&rsquo;re of mixed race. Multiracial patients often have an incredibly hard time finding life-saving marrow matches. When Devan, whose father is Caucasian and mother is part Indian, was first diagnosed with leukemia, his family did a search of the international marrow registry that contains over 14 million donors and came up empty. {snip}</p>
<p>Compared to organ transplants, bone marrow donations need to be even more genetically similar to their recipients. Though there are exceptions, the vast majority of successful matches take place between donors and patients of the same ethnic background. Since all the immune system&rsquo;s cells come from bone marrow, a transplant essentially introduces a new immune system to a person. Without genetic similarity between the donor and the patient, the new white blood cells will attack the host body. In an organ transplant, the body can reject the organ, but with marrow, the new immune system can reject the whole body.</p>
<p>To find a marrow match for anyone is hard. Even within one&rsquo;s own family, the chances of finding one are only about 30%. According to the World Donor Marrow Association, while two out of three Caucasians find a match, the chances of a patient from another ethnic background can be as low as one in four. Despite rapid improvements in marrow registries around the world, the global registry is still disproportionately represented by the U.S., U.K. and Germany  &mdash;  all predominantly Caucasian countries. For a multiracial person, the chances are usually even worse. Athena Mari Asklipiadis, the founder of the California-based Mixed Marrow, one of the only outreach groups devoted to recruiting mixed race donors, says &#8220;the numbers are quite staggering.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. {snip}&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to ascertain the exact chances of finding a match for a mixed race person because the different combinations have different success rates, and the U.S.-based National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP), which has about eight million donors in its registry, does not have statistics on the success rates of mixed race patients. But Asklipiadis maintains the rates are lower  &mdash;  much lower. {snip}</p>
<p>In the NMDP database, less than 3% of donors self-identify as mixed race. Though this approximately matches U.S. Census data, more mixed-race donors are needed given the sheer genetic diversity of the group. {snip}</p>

<p>Just wait for liberal politicians to start attacking white blood cells for being &#8220;racist&#8221;!</p>
<p>But, joking aside, this is quite terrible and I will certainly pray that Devan is able to find a donor. After all, its not his fault he&rsquo;s miscegenized.</p>

		<p>The article whines that whites are more likely to receive bone marrow matches than non-whites but doesn&rsquo;t reveal why: non-whites are far too self-centered to bother donating in the first place.</p>
<p>Rather than point this out the article makes it seem like the non-whites are merely innocent victims of circumstance, if not discrimination. </p>

<p>Race is a social construct.  Believe it, or suffer the consequences.</p>

		<p>Ok, so instead of saying the truth which is whites are more GENEROUS and willing to donate bone marrow (which implies that nonwhites are less generous/altruistic which is of course widely documented on Amren); this article implies the usual &#8216;white privilege/discrimination&rsquo; garbage.</p>
<p>But the logic doesn&rsquo;t fly. It costs NOTHING to donate. There are no &#8216;socio-economic&rsquo; barriers to donating bone marrow.</p>

		<p>How in the world can this possibly be? As we have all been taught by being bombarded with tons of pc garbage that there is ABSOLUTELY no difference between the races. However bone marrow transplants are as is said a risky treatment at best, just as are organ transplants. Leukemia is not treatable with a stem cell transplant, in which case the donor is ones self, and has a much greater chance of a longer remission. AS to the mixing of the races compounding the problem? well perhaps yet another negative thing about diversity has come to light, you think?</p>

		<p>I believe the daughter of Rod Carew was in the same boat. </p>
<p>Need a bone marrow transplant but could not find a suitable donor. Father black, mother white, and the daughter just did not match anyone, even remotely.</p>

		<p>The Left will twist this into an advertisement for further race mixing.  But as this and other problems associated with genetic outcomes of race mixing, it will become more difficult to argue this angle.  They will do it none-the-less.</p>

		<p>#1, rjf101, you are so 100% right!  I am waiting to see liberals blame white scientists and white doctors for biologically engineering this, as a sort of genocide on mixed races.  Just like the ridiculous claim several years ago about sickle-cell.  Malcolm X types were crying that it was engineered to be placed into America&rsquo;s drinking water to commit genocide, as whites are immune to it.  I believe Liberals can trace every single problem with blacks and mixed races as originating with white interference to sabotage non-whites.</p>

		<p>To Jeddermann (re Post # 6):</p>
<p>You are correct. I posted on the same topic some time ago, on the unintended consequences of miscegentation. I cited Rod Carew and his white wife having to search in vain for a donor for their mixed-race daughter who died of cancer, a few years ago.</p>
