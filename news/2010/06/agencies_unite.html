			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Curnutte, Cincinnati Enquirer, June 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Some of Cincinnati&rsquo;s 10,000 nonprofit agencies and the United Way are getting serious now about quelling the urban violence that is killing and wounding the city&rsquo;s young black men.</p>
<p>The issue attracted serious attention in March when eight African-American men were gunned down during a 10-day stretch.</p>
<p>Those shootings prompted city leaders and others to renew calls for new programs to reduce the bloodshed. Ironically, those calls came while one of the few groups that help shooting victims  &mdash;  Out of the Crossfire  &mdash;  scrambled to find $60,000 so it could stay in business.</p>
<p>An Enquirer examination of area social-service agencies shows that only within the past year have they started to cooperate and expand programs for young urban blacks, the biggest group being shot to death and doing the shooting on Cincinnati&rsquo;s streets.</p>
<p>Of the city&rsquo;s 86 homicides since the beginning of 2009, 59  &mdash;  or nearly seven out of 10  &mdash;  were African-American men and 41 of them were in their teen or 20s.</p>
<p>Many reasons contributed to the lack of activity and cooperation among agencies in the past:</p>
<p>Some managers say their agencies must combat the attitude that black-on-black violence is not society&rsquo;s problem in general, but isolated in the inner city.</p>
<p>Nonprofits are wary of working with young urban black men in neighborhoods with a lot of poverty and other social problems.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Lack of jobs problem</b></p>
<p>Dr. Victor Garcia, chief trauma surgeon at Cincinnati Children&rsquo;s Hospital and a United Way board member, has assembled a national group of experts and 70 local leaders  &mdash;  including business people  &mdash;  to promote a long-term plan to reduce gun violence. The biggest problem is the lack of jobs, made worse by high unemployment and layoffs.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t underestimate the effect of the recession on the violence, experts say. In early 2007, about 90 percent of ex-offenders found work after completing programs run by the Talbert House. Today, it&rsquo;s about 50 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Christopher Smitherman, president of the Cincinnati NAACP chapter, said unemployment among black men in Cincinnati is at &#8220;Depression-era&#8221; levels.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s right. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that 34.5 percent of black men ages 16-24 are jobless. The rate for black men 20 and older is 17 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. Those numbers translate into little choice for young black men except the drug trade.</p>
<p>Smitherman said the focus of his NAACP presidency is minority hiring on public construction projects, such as Cincinnati Public Schools buildings and the Banks riverfront development. Though many young black men do not have enough skills, many do, Smitherman said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first false stereotype is that African-American men and women don&rsquo;t want to work,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><b>Layers of challenges</b></p>
<p>The multiple social problems that afflict black men and women living in poor neighborhoods can&rsquo;t be ignored, said Neil Tilow, the president of Talbert House, a social service agency whose program include running treatment and ex-offender release programs for Hamilton County.</p>
<p>Behavioral issues  &mdash;  including untreated mental illness and drug and alcohol abuse  &mdash;  are rampant. Then, there is an exaggerated sense of entitlement and victimization. That makes it a challenge from a social service agency perspective because employees are afraid to work with black men who have felony convictions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2009, 292 &#8220;violent gunshot wound&#8221; victims arrived at University&rsquo;s emergency room.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the past two years, nonprofit Cincinnati Works  &mdash;  which received $155,000 from United Way  &mdash;  placed 80 convicted felons in jobs. About two-thirds of them remain employed.</p>
<p>Recommendations for placement come from street advocates who work for the Cincinnati Initiative to Reduce Violence (CIRV), a program that gets $838,000 from the city.</p>
<p>&#8220;The person has to convince us they want to go to work,&#8221; said Cincinnati Works President Dave Phillips, who insists help is available for anyone who really wants a job.</p>
<p>&#8220;First of all, that&rsquo;s been the cry since Day 1  &mdash;  no one cares. That&rsquo;s BS.&#8221; Phillips said. &#8220;We are a society that says, &#8216;Raise your hand if you want to work and are willing to do what it takes, and we will help you.&rsquo; But this population has never done it. They&rsquo;d rather grab a gun, shoot somebody and rob other dope boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cincinnati Works has a retention rate of 80 percent for the 600 to 700 people it places in jobs each year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>More money coming</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>United Way executives said the programs their agency gives money to  &mdash;  preparing children for kindergarten success ($10 million), achievement in school and life for youth ($8.3 million) and financially stabilizing poor families ($8 million)  &mdash;  also help black men and other people in poor, high-crime neighborhoods.</p>
<p>United Way, which dishes out more than $50 million annually of the region&rsquo;s charitable contributions, also funneled $135,000 to three agencies for the first time in 2010 aimed at keeping students in school and helping them stay in college.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Light in darkness</b></p>
<p>One bright light in the urban violence is the CIRV program, started in Cincinnati in 2007 and based on the model first employed in Boston in which street outreach workers  &mdash;  all of them ex-cons  &mdash;  develop relationships with men involved in the drug trade and point them toward opportunities for productive lives.</p>
<p>CIRV members are highly visible and show support for victims&rsquo; families by attending funerals and participating in anti-violence marches.</p>

		<p>I could go on for thousands of words when it comes to this story.  And I know that AR&rsquo;s servers only have so many terabytes of storage space.  So I&rsquo;ll limit myself to answering this hypocritical element:</p>
<p><i>Some managers say their agencies must combat the attitude that black-on-black violence is not society&rsquo;s problem in general, but isolated in the inner city.</i></p>
<p>Yet, when white people complain about black crime, diversity lovers, both black and white, respond by asking:  Why does it matter to you?  It&rsquo;s only an inner city problem.  St. Louis&rsquo;s last Chief of Police tried to use this argument in a roundabout way, when trying to calm white city residents down about black crime:  The Chief (white) said that 75% of all murders in St. Louis City involve a perpetrator and victim that have similar criminal histories.  What he was saying in in implicit way is that since 3/4 of the murders are black thug on black thug, then white non-thugs have nothing to worry about.  (Yeah right).</p>
<p>So I did some figuring.  I took the Chief at his word, and assumed that only 25% of the murders in St. Louis City are worth worrying about.  So I took the murder rate per 100,000, multiplied by 0.25 to determine the rate that the Chief thinks is real.  And even then, it was 2.75 times higher than St. Louis County, to the west (a different entity than St. Louis City), and more than a dozen times higher than St. Charles County (further to the west) and Jefferson County (to the south, has a reputation for white trash and meth labs), both in Missouri.</p>
<p>So even when they try to make excuses, they wind up inserting foot into mouth.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Behavioral issues, drug and alcohol abuse then there is an exaggerated sense of entitlement and victimization&#8221;.</p>
<p>The exaggerated sense of entitlement is why employers don&rsquo;t really like to deal with blacks. Most blacks do want a pay check but many don&rsquo;t want to do what it takes to get one. Such things as show up everyday and put in a full days work day after day for years and years and still not be president of the company. </p>
<p>Blacks tend to have a &#8220;Cargo Cult&#8221; mentality. They see the things that whites have and don&rsquo;t associate these things with hard work but more with shin color. How come whites have so much Cargo and we poor blacks have so little cargo? </p>
<p>My family has been doing hard and dirty work now for hundreds of years that I know of and we are still not rich. It does suck but that&rsquo;s life. </p>

		<p>I live in Cincinnati, in the City in a neighborhood that&rsquo;s not immune to violence. </p>
<p>First, bravo to Dave Phillips <i>(&ldquo;We are a society that says, &lsquo;Raise your hand if you want to work and are willing to do what it takes, and we will help you.&rsquo; But this population has never done it. They&rsquo;d rather grab a gun, shoot somebody and rob other dope boys.&rdquo;)</i> </p>
<p>We could reduce the level of cant surrounding this issue by acknowledging that homie is not a thug because he&rsquo;s unemployed, he&rsquo;s unemployable because he&rsquo;s a thug.</p>
<p>Second, Chris Smitherman and the NAACP are playing a game straight out of <i>Mau-Mauing the Flack Catchers</i> and it has nothing to do with getting the youf a job. Or reducing violence among same. The NAACP was silent when this City went through a rash of almost-daily shootings in April, all concentrated in a few neighborhoods. Take a look at their website press releases for that month and you&rsquo;ll see what I mean. </p>
<p>Third, I do believe that black people have as much right to this country as I do (unlike Mexicans). But wow  &mdash;  this article unintentionally makes the point of how much we pay  &mdash;  to this very day  &mdash;  for importing African slave labor. How much money, energy, and opportunity costs are wasted on black thugs and criminals.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m still waiting to hear someone publicly agonizing about black-on - <i>White</i> violence.  Apparently black brutishness is only to be noticed when it&rsquo;s applied to other blacks.</p>
<p>And it would, after all, be Racist for <i>Whites</i> to complain, wouldn&rsquo;t it?<br>

<p>Typical liberal gibberish. I live in the Cincinnati area and can tell you that the murder rate in Cincinnati is down significantly this year. And the unemployment rate is much worse NOW, than it was a few years ago when the homocide rate was much higher. So much for the trauma surgeon&rsquo;s theory. </p>

<p>I am in complete agreement. I know what I am saying is not going to be popular, but I am in my 20s and a college student and when the issue of race comes up, I play this angle. The only people who have a right to North America are Americans (as in White), blacks and natives. Hispanics, Asians, Muslims, etc are thus excluded. This is not saying I like blacks, on the contrary. But as a young American in a PC world it is important to tell half-truths. </p>
<p>Even a liberal maniac can understand this. Whites founded the country, blacks were brought here against their will, and natives have no where else to go. Thus, you shut out all argument for mass non-white immigration and anchor babies if you play your cards right. </p>
<p>In truth, I support the ruling of Elk vs. Wilkins with regards to natives. While no one can deny them the right of existence on the North American continent, that are not necessarily citizens. They belong to another nation with its own traditions, and indeed, privileges. As for blacks, I honestly bemoan the lack of foresight of our forefathers, or rather their lack of action. They should have been sent back to Africa. But they weren&rsquo;t, so voluntary separation is the best. Take away the busing laws. Without whites promoting integration, blacks will be left to their own devices. Should anyone act violently against white communities, use the just laws against them. Should they conspire against the United States, strip them of citizenship for acts of treason and send them back to Africa. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m reading between the lines here.  7 out of 10 homicide victims were black, according to the article.  That tells me that 3 out of 10 were most likely white. How many of those whites were murdered by blacks?  That&rsquo;s the real story here. </p>

		<p>The jobs issue is not so complicated.  A person or group is not going to open a business in a place known for violence, hence there is a lack of jobs.  </p>
<p>If there are few jobs, does this mean that the people should go crazy and harm each other?  No, it means they should band together and create jobs themselves, even if it&rsquo;s as unglamorous as farming and selling vegetables or other similar labor.  </p>
<p>It may not buy the bling, but it is repectable work and brings stability to society.  My ancestors did this for untold centuries.  Work hard so your children can have a better life.  Oops!  That&rsquo;s a value handed down culturally.  I really don&rsquo;t have an answer for how to solve the problems of a community that has no such values.  </p>
<p>The libs tried mixing the races together under the theory that it would provide good role models, but I&rsquo;m not sure how well that&rsquo;s worked out, because the good role models then realize that their children are around bad role models and they circle the wagons or move.  </p>
<p>This is what the libs never planned for, and there are enough examples of whte kids gone bad (gangsta rap lifestyle) to make parents terrified.  For what it&rsquo;s worth, Cincinatti used to be a nice place a few decades ago. </p>

<p>Yeah, whites complaining about whites murdered or victims of crimes or just intimidated, that&rsquo;s the very definition of &#8216;racism&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Whites complaining about jobs taken from them, affirmative action (discrimination), that&rsquo;s the definition of &#8216;racism&rsquo;.</p>
<p>White complaining about their country being taken from them by immigrants and an out of control non-white birth rate, that whites must pay for, that&rsquo;s more &#8216;racism&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;Then, there is an exaggerated sense of entitlement and victimization&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Is this not the result of the &#8216;self-esteem&rsquo;/Afro-centric K-12 curriculum that is entrenched in urban black schools?</p>
<p>Blacks internalize a sense of lifetime entitlement and victimization from two sources:  The educational-industrial complex and the propaganda media.</p>
<p>This article makes a point of something I have been harping on here for years: </p>
<p>The huge, negative impact K-12 education has on American children  &mdash;  ALL of them.</p>
<p>What does anyone expect when the entire K-12 curricula in urban schools is based on black = blameless, innocent victim, White = evil, source of all black misery  &mdash;   evil interpreted as &#8216;You  Owe Me Whitey!&rsquo; because YOU&rsquo;VE made me this way  &mdash;   poor, unemployed, violent, a failure at school and in life.</p>
<p>Blacks are told repeatedly that their failures and violence are normal, the result of &#8216;being forced&rsquo; to live in an oppressive White civilization that would love nothing better than to go back to the days when blacks were mandated to sit in the back of the bus.</p>
<p>On top of the victimization message blacks receive in the schools, the media show an entirely unrealistic vision of &#8216;the real world&rsquo;  &mdash;   one in which highly intelligent, highly educated blacks lord over foolish, stupid, racist Whites.  The media also blow up and trumpet ANY and ALL White-on-black crime, true or untrue, completely ignore the vast number of black-on-White torture-murders, robberies, rapes and assaults and refuse to report the danger blacks pose to the Whites and the White community.</p>
<p>And, kudos to Mark Curnutte of the  Cincinnati Enquirer for (FINALLY) reporting this:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Cincinnati Works President Dave Phillips, insists help is available for anyone who really wants a job&hellip; &#8216;this population has never done it. They&rsquo;d rather grab a gun, shoot somebody and rob other dope boys&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope there will be more of this type of reporting (but don&rsquo;t hold your breath)&hellip;.</p>

There are certainly plenty of low-skill jobs in Cincinnati, but if someone can&rsquo;t get his trifling self out of bed and be on the job for 8 hours, he&rsquo;ll probably just deal crack or weed instead.</p>

		<p>Wasn&rsquo;t Cinncinati the city that a few years ago had race riots where blacks pulled whites out of their cars and beat them???  And no hate crimes were filed. Where was the outrage then. All these nonprofit agencies kept quiet. Apparently when whites are the victims of black crime there is no need to be alarmed.</p>
