<h1>Student Immigrants Use Civil Rights-Era Strategies</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Russell Contreras, Google News, June 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>They gather on statehouse steps with signs and bullhorns, risking arrest. They attend workshops on civil disobedience and personal storytelling, and they hold sit-ins and walk out of class in protest. They&rsquo;re being warned that they could even lose their lives.</p>
<p>Students fighting laws that target illegal immigrants are taking a page from the civil rights era, adopting tactics and gathering praise and momentum from the demonstrators who marched in the streets and sat at segregated lunch counters as they sought to turn the public tide against racial segregation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their struggle then is ours now,&#8221; said Deivid Ribeiro, 21, an illegal immigrant from Brazil and an aspiring physicist. &#8220;Like it was for them, this is about survival for us. We have no choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Undocumented students, many of whom consider themselves &#8220;culturally American&#8221; because they have lived in the U.S. most of their lives, don&rsquo;t qualify for federal financial aid and can&rsquo;t get in-state tuition rates in some places. They are drawing parallels between themselves and the 1950s segregation of black and Mexican-American students.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&rsquo;s genius,&#8221; said Amilcar Shabazz, chairman of the W.E.B. DuBois Department of Afro-American Studies at the University of Massachusetts. &#8220;If you want to figure out how to get your story out and change the political mood in America, everybody knows the place to start your studies is the civil rights movement.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The movement has gained attention of Congress. Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Richard Lugar, R-Ind., sent a letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano in April, asking her to halt deportations of immigrant students who could earn legal status under DREAM, which stands for the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors act, and which they&rsquo;re sponsoring.</p>
<p>Last month, three illegal immigrant students demanding to meet with Arizona Sen. John McCain about DREAM were arrested and later detained for refusing to leave his Tucson office. High school and college students in Chicago and Denver walked out of class this year to protest Arizona&rsquo;s tough new law requiring immigrants to carry registration papers. In December, immigrant students staged a &#8220;Trail of Dreams&#8221; march from Miami&rsquo;s historic Freedom Tower to Washington, D.C., to raise support for DREAM.</p>
<p>Similar student immigrant groups have sprung up at the University of California at Los Angeles and the University of Houston.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Massachusetts, hundreds of student activists have gone through training by Marshall Ganz, a public policy lecturer at Harvard Kennedy School and a former organizer with the late Cesar Chavez of the United Farm Workers movement. At special camps, students attend workshops on civil disobedience, storytelling and media outreach.</p>
<p>Students who have attended the workshops even continue to use the well-known farm workers&rsquo; rallying clap at the end of organizing meetings.</p>
<p>&#8220;They know that clap,&#8221; Ganz said, &#8220;because I taught them that clap. It&rsquo;s all about the experience.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The only flaw in their plan is that the &#8220;civil disobedience&#8221; tactics from the civil rights era really didn&rsquo;t work.  The reason why their cause won is because of blatantly dishonest and political Federal judges, determined politicians (especially LBJ), curiously timed &#8220;right wing extremist&#8221; violence (read: LBJ/FBI-provoked FBI informants) meant to sway key Congressional votes, and the Walter Durantyish media.  </p>

		<p>We should have hope this time.  Segregationists in the 1960&rsquo;s were fearful, and integration has confirmed all their fears were well founded and rational.  Segregation&rsquo;s hope is vindicated by Integration&rsquo;s reality.</p>
<p>Now that Whites have experienced the predicted horrors of failed social experiments as were forced upon them by ruling elite Whites, they are less likely to believe that immigration reform, amnesty, and the vote will result in anything but disaster. (We must aim the coming disaster at the Whites who enabled it and pushed it upon us. Integrate the White churches and synagogues with Multicultural Diversity!)</p>
<p><br>
Whites understand this time that illegal aliens bring crime and violence.  Benefits for them will result in division and breakup and reforming into White ethnostates.  About time!</p>

		<p>I completely disagree with this article.</p>
<p>Such movements are an extreme detriment to these people gaining power.  It&rsquo;s only that the history of these things has been sanitized that it seems they were effective.</p>
<p>Selma is the epitome of this.  Today&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s remembered as a classic act of good people demonstrating in the face of injustice until people are shamed into changing.</p>
<p>But back then, it was blacks and degenerate whites fornicating in the streets and shocking everyone who witnessed what happened with the truth of what these people were all about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually the Saul Alinsky method of infiltration with big money from hostile foreign powers that is the model for success here.  Once in power, they rewrite history.</p>
<p>The reason I mention this is the enemies of white people are making a huge mistake of believing their own lies.  Civil rights era &#8220;strategies&#8221; work toward our benefit, not theirs&hellip;..because the truth of these people comes out&hellip;.when they riot&hellip;when they attack police, throw feces, threaten to kill whites, etc.</p>
<p>The way to beat them is to model their successful strategy of putting on a respectable face, hiding our agenda and then quietly taking over politically.  There are no hostile foreign powers to underwrite us financially but the enemies money comes from the US.  Cutting off their funding by cutting off military spending and foreign aid (to the tune of a trillion a year now) does much the same thing as we redirect that money back into OUR economy.</p>
<p>The Ron Paul approach is a devastating one two punch&hellip;.cutting off the main source of funding to anti-white racists, then causing an economic boom at the same time.  People are attracted to electing him because he was right about the economic crash.  But what will really put him and his kind in power is being right about fixing the problem.</p>

Nobody brought these people here in chains. Nobody is keeping them here or baring them from leaving.</p>
<p>I hope they become belligerent and I hope they shock middle Americans into seeing them as the interlopers they are.</p>

		<p>Civil rights for blacks did nothing whatsoever to humanize or civilize black Africans.  </p>
<p>In fact just the opposite occurred.  </p>
<p>Blacks began committing a grossly disproportionate percentage of crimes.  </p>
<p>The civil rights movement made blacks believe they are entitled to that which they do not deserve. </p>
<p>Blacks were brought to this country against their will, but none have the courage or desire to return to Africa.  </p>
<p>Hispanics come to America against our will and we will have to use force to drive them out.  </p>
<p>Hispanics want to believe they have a future in this country when in fact they have none&hellip;    <br>

<p>That is how Amerinds felt about us.</p>
<p>We ought to be careful about how we characterize our rights and interlopers wrongs.<br>

		<p>It is the mushy headed, dope soaked mind set of the left that makes such tactics succeed.  What most drugs do is short circuit logical reason by increases free association by simple, basic, and emotional recognition triggers.  Marijauna, because of its widespread use, has had a huge in this way.  It is easy enough to detect how it worked in the last election as huge amounts of college age &#8220;adults&#8221; voted and received their information via computers.  This is how the left has been able to build its motivational momentum over the years.  It is a simple matter to merely wave the MLK, Civil Rights era flag and get the Palovian responses.  To be fair, the Right has its own Pavlovian triggers via entrenched religious beliefs that affect the same short circuiting association triggers as drugs do.  The Left just gets a double whammy because there is a great deal of Christian influence in their short circuited reasoning.  One delusion re-enforces another.</p>
<p>This makes it clear to me at least, that it is time for white realists to kick the habit, and clear their minds of toxic thought if they want to survive.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough I am part Amerind myself.   But no more than 3%.</p>
<p>But the analogy I&rsquo;m drawing is invading a sovereign nation, and invading someone&rsquo;s house.</p>
