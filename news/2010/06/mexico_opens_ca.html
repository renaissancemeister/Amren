<h1>Mexico Opens California Office to Provide ID for Illegals</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sara A. Carter, Washington Examiner, June 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Mexican government is opening a satellite consular office on Catalina Island  &mdash;  a small resort off the California coast with a history of drug smuggling and human trafficking  &mdash;  to provide the island&rsquo;s illegal Mexican immigrants with identification cards, The Washington Examiner has learned.</p>
<p>The Mexican consular office in Los Angeles issued a flier, a copy of which was obtained by The Examiner, listing the Catalina Island Country Club as the location of its satellite office. It invites Mexicans to visit the office to obtain the identification, called matricular cards, by appointment.</p>
<p>Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a Republican whose district includes Catalina Island, said handing out matricular cards will exacerbate an already dangerous situation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The matricular consular identification card, is issued by the Mexican government to Mexican nationals residing outside the country, regardless of immigration status. The purpose is to provide identification for opening bank accounts and obtaining other services. But the cards are usually used to skirt U.S. immigration laws, since Mexicans in the country legally have documents proving that status, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Officers with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said their agency was asked by Mexican officials not to enforce U.S. immigration laws on the island while the cards were being issued.</p>
<p>&#8220;It amazes me every time that the Mexican government has the gall to tell us what to do,&#8221; said an ICE official, who asked not to be named. &#8220;More surprisingly is how many times we stand by and let them. This is just an example of one of hundreds of requests we&rsquo;ve had to deal with.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The island has a sizable Mexican migrant population. Most are undocumented low-income workers.</p>
<p>1:15pm UPDATE:</p>
<p>Mexican government officials have moved their satellite consular office from the Catalina Island Country Club to a Catholic Church  &mdash;  citing protection under the Geneva Convention.<br>

<p>Normally this is called intolerable interference into the sovereign affairs of another country (The U.S.)</p>
<p>There is some significance we cannot understand in having this office on an island off the coast of CA? A satellite office that is seen as being on an island that is within jurisdiction of the U.S. but enforcement of laws and regulations is poorly administered. This island is a way-point to parts beyond CA?</p>

<p>Apparently, it&rsquo;s a beachhead of invasion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not dificult to decifer what is going on here. A repetition of conquest of North America by Spaniards.</p>
<p>Catholic Church supports it. The conquerors use deception, lies, and naivete of the conquered in order to take over a stronger adversary.</p>
<p>The only major difference is that the today&rsquo;s conquerors are of mixed extraction: partly descendents of Spanish conquistadors, and partly descendents of bloody Aztecs who did quite a lot of conquering on their own before the Spaniards arrived to Central America.</p>
<p>Also, I see certain similarities between Obama and Montezuma.</p>
<p>So, nothing really changed here.  <br>

		<p>Surely this brazen act breaks some sort of international law, doesn&rsquo;t it? Why does our government allow this? Have they completely abandoned us?</p>

		<p>Well, today it is a representative of the Mexican government handing out irrefutable identification, made from the presses in the back room, but tomorrow they could be replaced by one of the representatives of the Sinaloa Cartel, and the presses will be humming along making perfect 20 dollar US bills.</p>
<p>And Calderon will appear on T.V. stating that he has new &#8220;representatives&#8221; throughout the country and that all the power of the federales is behind them.</p>
<p>Then he will leave the podium.  If the cameras linger long enough, they will see that a rough looking man with bandoliers of ammo crossing his chest has him lifted up by the back of his collar as Calderon&rsquo;s feet are fighting to touch the floor, while his mouth is moving just as fast.</p>
<p>Another man in a business suit will be facing Calderon, shouting, &#8220;I thought I told you to shut your face?&#8221;</p>
<p>As the camera moves to the news desk, the newsman reads a statement from Calderon&rsquo;s office, stating that the government is in full control of the country and that tourists will be perfectly safe.</p>
<p>And the Mexicans in this country will be running through the streets&hellip;.AGAIN&hellip;.with the Mex flag held high overhead, sensing it just might be time to set up Aztlan.</p>

		<p>A MEXICAN owned office on US soil providing ID&rsquo;s for Illegals?<br>
A MOSQUE being built near the 9/11 memorial?<br>
The MEXICAN President tell Americans what is wrong with our borders and our un-American President just nods his head?<br>
AMERICANS are more concerned with help a 3rd World nation then theri own? Whats next?? Seriously where does the madness end??<br>
Our liberal politicians are giving away America.</p>
<p>These are troubling times my fellow Americans. Call me paranoid but I&rsquo;m stock up on ammo.</p>
