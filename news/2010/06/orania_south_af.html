<h1>Orania, South Africa: Where Apartheid Lives On</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Les Carpenter, Yahoo! Sports, June 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And yes, it is true. In a country 80 percent black, there is a town that has made itself 100 percent white. Determined to preserve the Afrikaner culture 20 years after the fall of apartheid.</p>
<p>On the surface, Orania seems like a normal village. It has a grocery store, a gas station and a small bookstore that sells town T-shirts. A woman at a desk in the bookstore smiles and asks you to sign a guestbook. The primary language is Afrikaans, not English. The town&rsquo;s public relations director, a former physician named John Strydom, comes out and shows a video. On the screen, children ride bicycles and the narrator explains that &#8220;there is a place where children can still have a comfortable childhood&#8221; and &#8220;residents can walk without looking over their shoulder.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it is clear that without even mentioning the words, this is all about black and white.</p>
<p>Driving around Orania, Strydom points out all the sights: the new houses built with bales of straw for insulation and solar panels on the roofs, the radio station, the small but lavish hotel and gleaming spa that overlook the river. He also explains the criteria for buying a house in Orania: one must submit an application, promise to uphold the Afrikaner culture and be approved by an administrative board.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} When Nelson Mandela was released from prison in 1990, it was only a matter of time before Afrikaner rule was over.</p>
<p>This is when a missionary named Carel Boshoff, the son-in-law of Hendrick Frensch Verwoerd, the architect of apartheid, banded with a group of 40 families to buy a mostly abandoned government construction camp and turn it into Orania. From the beginning, the idea was to separate. Orania had its own flag and its own currency (the ora, the first three letters of the town&rsquo;s name) and set out to build something self-sustaining. Now, the 700 or so residents of Orania live as if it is their own country.</p>
<p>In fact, when asked who he considers to be his president, Boshoff&rsquo;s son Carel (IV), who is now the community&rsquo;s leader rambles for a moment, talking about how all people see government in different ways. When pressed on the question he finally says, &#8220;Right here,&#8221; and points to the ground at his feet.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He picks his words carefully but the community&rsquo;s philosophy spills out nonetheless. Since the Afrikaner is white in heritage then the culture that is preserved must be white as well. The people of Orania don&rsquo;t have anything against black people, he says, they just don&rsquo;t share a culture. And if they don&rsquo;t share a culture then they shouldn&rsquo;t be living together.</p>
<p>Mostly Orania taps into white fear. Carel (IV) speaks a lot about how black rule has forced Afrikaners out of work because of Affirmative Action programs designed to get blacks jobs. An experienced white engineer could suddenly become a technical assistant to an inexperienced black employee, he says.</p>
<p>He also talks a lot about violence in other parts of South Africa. People in cities such as Johannesburg live behind giant walls and electric fences. In more rural areas, a panic has risen about what locals call &#8220;farm killings&#8221; in which young blacks have murdered a few Afrikaner farmers. The most notable was the killing of white supremacist Eugene TerreBlanche, a man who has advocated for several white republics in the country and was beaten to death by two of his black workers over a wage dispute.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>South Africa is quickly becoming a failed state, Carel (IV) says. Any thought the World Cup is going to bring unity and help people confront two decades of growing pains is ridiculous, he says. The country&rsquo;s future, with what he calls &#8220;corruption&#8221; in the mostly black African National Congress, is bleak.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And yet that is the misfortune of Orania, this fact it wants to step back from the fight to build South Africa. It is a beautiful town with imaginative people, like Carel (IV)&rsquo;s nephew, also named Carel who is a student in Pretoria, who loves the idea of the World Cup and yet dreams of returning to Orania.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re building something for ourselves here,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>But why? Why not for the country? Why hide a spectacular hotel and a spa on the edge of the river and not share it with the rest of South Africa? All around the country there is growth and building, even among the &#8220;tension&#8221; as Carel (IV) calls it. Just a few days ago in the black Johannesburg township of Soweto, a group of black residents gathered at a restaurant for the monthly meeting of their saving group. Together, they said, they give whatever money they want to put away to one member who deposits it in the bank. Then when enough has been saved to buy a car or a house or pay for school they can pull it out. The group serves as their support.</p>
<p>Imagine putting the saving group together with the Orania ingenuity that erected energy-efficient houses made with straw inside? What a country this could become.</p>

		<p>SA apparently once WAS a nice country when whites ran it.  But now, the article hints, whites like the Oranians have abandoned it, and the nation&rsquo;s plunge is all the fault of such people.  Does that mean that blacks can&rsquo;t manage the running of the country? Hmmmm&hellip;.</p>

<p>This happens to a lesser extent here in the U.S.  I&rsquo;ve seen it at my job.  An unqualified black employee was affirmative actionly hired into a professional job where I work.  He clearly does not have the skills, but we all have to pretend.  The white INTERNS do much of his work, and what they can&rsquo;t handle, the rest of us, many of whom are paid less than the black guy, have to do the rest.  Of course, official credit goes to him, even though everyone knows what&rsquo;s going on, because we can&rsquo;t publicly puncture the charade.</p>
<p>It is undoubtedly worse in South Africa, but many of us over here have had a taste of it (and wouldn&rsquo;t mind being able to create our own non-black havens to escape).</p>

<p>Yes, notice who, as usual, has to supply the ingenuity. Meanwhile, the aborigines can&rsquo;t even scrape together enough money to own individual cars in what had once been a first-world nation. No, the folks in Orania are absolutely right. </p>

<p>This is one amazing piece, but that one sentence alone really takes the cake. This journalist thinks over 3100 deaths within a 30000 to 40000 and shrinking population of white South African farmers equals a few dead Afrikaner farmers. Is he really in such denial? That surely can&rsquo;t be it. In my humble opinion, he had a specific agenda when he wrote this piece and interviewed those people. It wasn&rsquo;t to be objective, it was to write them off as hate filled white racist trash and then blame their fears of black South Africa as nothing more than white prejudice. </p>
<p>In purely simple terms. His biased towards Afrikaners wanting to live by themselves within their own culture is truly shocking. In a sane world, journalists who research and write their articles in the same vain manner that Mr Les Carpenter does, would find themselves without a job after their first print.  </p>
<p>All that aside, I find it rather funny that a small community of some 700 Afrikaners caused Mr Les so much grief. Maybe he should instead divert his attention into trying to garner something positive from Bafana Bafana&rsquo;s (the South African National Soccer team) 3 nil loss to Uruguay. If he can do this without being &#8220;Lala Land Hopeful&#8221; I will be impressed.</p>

Back in 86 I was running a well known city restraunt like it was my own personal night court. Tips, girls&hellip;colored lights.One day  the busboy Rueben informed me that he held a pre-med degree from the  University of Guadalajara and from here on out I should treat him with more respect. I promised to keep it in mind and then informed him politely that he need to fill the back bar with fresh ice, give me a back up rack of  both Collins glasses AND Highballs and then pound on the back kitchen door to alert me when either my girl, my connection or one of  my customers walked in. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m hearing about this Orania a little more and more each month.<br>
I am suspecting this place will be forced to integrate very soon.<br>
When the black South Africans look upon Orania with jealously, they will either demand inclusion, or tear it apart. </p>
<p>The question is whether the Afrikaners are willing to fight, kill, and die to preserve their heritage.</p>

<p>Astronomers say that when they look at a supernova going off in a distant galaxy, the supernova is as bright or sometimes brighter than the galaxy itself.  I think the answer to your question is that this village of 700 whites is more enviable than all the blacks in ZA, and this has to bug him to no end.</p>

		<p>The article is not very sympathetic (duh).<br>
It is hard to say whether these are kooks or the vestiges of the voortrekker spirit (or if there is a difference,for that matter).<br>
Settling on land no one else wanted and building something is &hellip; yes, impressive.<br>
But what is the basis of their economy? If I understand right, it is disgruntled white crime victims - a growing market, but not very sustainable.<br>
What I mean is this will result in a gated retirement community - clearly not what they wanted.</p>
<p>Carel IV. has a point on crime. Joburg was a thriving (though somewhat provincial) metropolis and financial hub with the best university in Africa (which it probably still is, but you know &hellip;).<br>
Now, Interpol rates it worse than Lagos and Kigali (which says something).</p>
<p>- I wish them well &hellip; but not TOO well. I do believe success - with some austerity - is possible. But if they succeed too well, putting the gubmint to shame, how long do you think said gubmint would refrain from the Mugabe Way?<br>
Not long enough to raise your children, that´s for sure.</p>

<p>Well Les, what the Africans call a &#8220;saving group&#8221; white people call &#8220;socialism.&#8221;  And the only time it has a remote chance of working is when it&rsquo;s joined voluntarily.  And even then you can guarantee it&rsquo;s going to break down once the handful of productive people see all the people who can&rsquo;t work because of &#8220;back injuries&#8221; are out bodysurfing before they show up for dinner.  </p>
<p>And it NEVER works when you throw people into the mix that are a different color than everyone else.  This is the only reason the Scandinavians have been able to make it work for so long.  We&rsquo;ll be seeing the breakdown of this sooner than later as they give away their countries just like the rest of white Western civilization has done. </p>

<p>Yes, isn&rsquo;t it funny that a small black community in a white nation is always &#8220;poor because it is isolated from the wealth of the majority,&#8221; but when an all-white community in a black nation is thriving, no explanation is given, except to insist that it is &#8220;racist!&#8221; Either that, or it is somehow gaining its wealth by draining it from the majority! &#8220;Dem whites, dey sure be debbils!&#8221;</p>

		<p>What I don&rsquo;t understand is why every single white person in SA doesn&rsquo;t move to Orania.</p>
<p>I know that if, for some bizarre reason, I found myself living in SA, it wouldn&rsquo;t take me 15 minutes before I would start desperately looking for a neighborhood like Orania, for reasons that should be ultra-obvious&hellip;..ESPECIALLY since that racist government is institutionalizing anti-white discrimination everywhere in the job market.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m surprised the town of Oranian has been allowed to last this long.</p>
<p>While I wish them all the best, I can&rsquo;t imagine that a quiet and safe white community will be allowed to continue to thrive. I can&rsquo;t believe that plans aren&rsquo;t in the works to force them to integrate.</p>
<p>Even if there are no plans (highly unlikely) I suspect as things worsen in the rest of South Africa, blacks will become angry that white people are hording the safety and security for themselves.</p>
<p>Blacks will demand whites share what whites have again deprived them of. They will take it by &#8216;law&rsquo; or by force of numbers.<br>

<p>When push comes to shove, we&rsquo;ll see if the Orania community will fight. Hope they have guns. They may need them.<br>
Isn&rsquo;t it funny how Bantus in South Africa want every town and city to look like Soweto? That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so perplexing to this writer - he can&rsquo;t see why the Afrikaaners don&rsquo;t &#8220;share&#8221; Orania with the Bantus. Is he not aware of what Bantus do to a town when they overrun it in time?</p>
<p>To Peejay (re post # 9):</p>
<p>Funny you mention that. American Bantus in 1908 founded a town in California, and named it Allensworth, after their leader. They were migrants from the South, and didn&rsquo;t want to live under its Jim Crow laws. So they went west to California, where they thought they could pick cotton in peace and quiet.</p>
<p>Their leader died in 1914, and the town collapsed soon after that. The story is in the Amren archives.   </p>

		<p>Orania - Where Apartheid lives on???<br>
No, apartheid was the set of rules which was used for living together. Orania is something different as there is no attempt to order, command or guide the blacks to anything else than staying outside.</p>
<p>I think apartheid is a very bad and also dangerous idea because it is able to provide so much societal and material benefits for the blacks, so they can increase their numbers way out of proportion to the people who set the rules. So in the end, apartheid will always fail.</p>

<p>@14) The town is in the middle of a desert, the builders went to Israel to learn how to make it livable.  That&rsquo;s the only reason why it isn&rsquo;t a desert today.  I simply don&rsquo;t think the town could support even ten thousand Afrikaners moving there at once.  It&rsquo;ll have to be gradual(the population has been rising since the town&rsquo;s foundation).</p>
<p>@15) They&rsquo;re already jealous, much like the author.  In one of the many articles on the town I&rsquo;ve read it quoted the blacks in the &#8216;surrounding poor villages&rsquo; as being jealous of Orania&rsquo;s wealth.  </p>
<p>I sent an e-mail to the author chiding him for calling borderline genocide a &#8220;few farm murders.&#8221;  The article was sickening to read.  Here&rsquo;s a much much less biased article on Orania for anyone who&rsquo;s interested.</p>

<p><i>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re building something for ourselves here,&rdquo; he says.</i></p>
<p>But why? Why not for the country?</p>
<p><br>
As even this boob of a journalist must know, white South Africans DID build a country. And a very impressive country at that. Then, in the 90s, that country the whites built was taken from them by blacks.</p>
<p>Blacks who are currently hard at work destroying that country&hellip; just as they did to the formerly white country right next door to them that was once called Rhodesia. </p>
<p>The Oranians are merely trying to prevent having their hard work stolen from them a second time. </p>
<p>They&rsquo;re also trying to avoid being the latest victims in the genocide/ethnic cleansing of Boer farmers, whose body count now numbers over three thousand.</p>
<p>It must be extremely annoying, to put it mildly, to have built a country out of nothing, have that country taken from you, and then have to re-build it all over again. That&rsquo;s why this time, the Afrikaners are building a country for whites only. There&rsquo;s nothing difficult to understand here, it&rsquo;s merely a classic case of &#8220;Once bitten, twice shy.&#8221; Or, if you prefer, &#8220;Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.&#8221; </p>
<p><br>
BTW, I did a quick Googling for those Orania T-shirts the article mentions   &mdash;   but couldn&rsquo;t find any for sale on the Net. Perhaps someone with better search skills than mine could find such a site and post the relevant URL(s) here on AmRen. I&rsquo;m sure there are more than a few AmRenners who would like to show their support of Orania in this way   &mdash;   and the Oranians obviously need all the help we can give them!<br>

		<p>To Peejay (re post # 9):</p>
<p>Funny you mention that. American blacks in 1908 founded a town in California, and named it Allensworth, after their leader. They were migrants from the South, and didn&rsquo;t want to live under its Jim Crow laws. So they went west to California, where they thought they could pick cotton in peace and quiet.</p>
<p>Their leader died in 1914, and the town collapsed soon after that. The story is in the Amren archives. </p>
<p><b>Actually the town collapsed because the water table fell.<b> </b></b></p>

		<p>I think that the way a savings club works is that each member of the group deposits money with the leader every payday, and a ledger is kept of who donates what.  There is a waiting list of people who want a loan (which is everybody in the group.)  When there is enough money in the pot to finance a car or a house or a sewing machine, the person next in line for a loan gets one for the appropriate amount.  Essentially, this is do-it-yourself microcredit for the working poor, and it is a good thing.  If the savings club was &#8220;socialism&#8221; NOBODY would donate anything, rather EVERYBODY would be demanding that he &#8220;needed&#8221; the whole pot.</p>
<p>What the journalist failed to understand is that the Savings Club represents an infintesimally small portion of black South Africans.  The majority of black South Africans are born broke and die broke.  The journalist thinks it would be great if black and white combined, but not only would the average black in South Africa be a huge negative for Orania, the Oranians don&rsquo;t need the black microcredit system, as they are building a society effectively using their own resources.  The black microcredit savings club would improve their standard of living if they could be accepted in Orania, but the Oranians have nothing to gain, and a whole lot to lose, from letting blacks in. </p>

		<p>As one of the whites (two with my wife) who fled South Africa after five years of the new black rule, having by then enough experience to see that it was going to be another African failure, it is difficult not to feel a little like a traitor but I am now 72 so have little to offer in the obvious way that Saecovered by the whites, the same way the blacks grabbed it with terrorism, that seemingly approved method of warfare by spectators in the West up until 9/11 when the contributions by Irish Americans were suddenly stopped when Americans suddenly found out what it was like to be on the receiving end.  Do not feel angry.  I am very pro-American, but the &#8220;whip rounds&#8221; for the &#8220;old country&#8221; by Irish Americans where the proceeds were used to buy guns and bombs to kill other Irish people of a different way of worshiping God was definitely un-Christian especially when the two of the leading terrorists ended up in the British Govt. with jobs for life.</p>
<p>But Apartheid was not that bad as painted by the propaganda merchants.  It was a way of the whites in South Africa, many of whom had been there for up to 300 years, certainly much longer that many of the blacks who had flooded down from countries to the North to enjoy the prosperity the whites had brought to the continent.  Their attitude to Apartheid was that it was much, much better than the life they had left.</p>
<p>But Oriana is the final bolt-hole of a culture that was forced out of Europe by religious intolerance in the 18-19 Centuries, and now, after nurturing the blacks instead of fighting and destroying them or relegating them to strictly controlled reservations where they could drink themselves to death and extinction&hellip;&hellip;</p>

		<p>All the whites in South Africa don&rsquo;t move to Orania for the same reason whites aren&rsquo;t doing anything in the US and Europe.  Greed, laziness, lack of caring for their own people, being brainwashed by the media to think that things are actually safe.  We can hope that before the US gets as bad as SA that more people will make their own enclaves and start fighting back. History shows us that the American ancestors have quite a bit of courage-look how much of the continent we conquered in just a short amount of time-so we can hope that has been preserved in current generations and that our children will not be living in little reservations like the Native Americans and Whites in South Africa.</p>

<blockquote>Yes, isn&rsquo;t it funny that a small black community in a white nation is always &ldquo;poor because it is isolated from the wealth of the majority,&rdquo; but when an all-white community in a black nation is thriving, no explanation is given, except to insist that it is &ldquo;racist!&rdquo;</blockquote>
<p>What a great comment. Perfectly pointed on the lies of liberals. Every small (and big) black community in white areas are poor. And that shows that every white community (no matter if big or small) is wealthy. </p>

		<p>I wish Orania the very best for the future but I have a terrible feeling that it may face difficult times in the future. SA is going down the tubes and the ANC will put the blame on the shrinking white population. Orania will be forced to allow blacks to live there and usual destruction will occur (Detroit, Paris suburbs, etc.).  </p>

		<p>Orania is very similar to a gated community, or to a cooperative apartment building in NYC.  I wonder if the journalist who wrote the article is deeply offended by American methods of insulating oneself from crime and poverty.</p>

		<p>Unlikely though it may seem, it is just possible that Orania is the acorn from which a mighty oak will grow. This is a small, ideologically committed community on the edge of a vast, largely empty, region into which it can expand almost without limit. Numbers may be small, but others are joining, the desert is beginning to bloom and if they have plenty of babies Orania may turn out - a few generations from now - to be a prosperous and soundly based small country which is the last white reservation on Earth.</p>

		<p>This article was sent to me last week by an infuriated friend in Berkeley CA who knows I follow events in SA viz. White murders and killings.  </p>
<p>I too was angry but not surprised as this has been the only type of news reporting that we&rsquo;ve received in the West about SA and Zim for decades now  &mdash;  Whites = oppressors living on stolen land whose wealth was built upon the backs of blacks.  Blacks = peaceful oppressed natives locked out of the prosperity they created for the Whites.</p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;In more rural areas, a panic has risen about what locals call &#8216;farm killings&rsquo; in which young blacks have murdered a few Afrikaner farmers&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This is typical of the type of reporting we receive in the West post-apartheid by the White-hating media-farm killings not reported or brushed off.</p>
<p>These are not just &#8216;farm killings&rsquo; they are murder-tortures of the most vile nature  &mdash;  and there are A LOT of them.  As Professor MacDonald writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;White people are not merely being murdered, but they are being horribly and gruesomely tortured by people that can only be described as psychopaths&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an excerpt from an article in <a href="https://praag.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">https://praag.co.uk/</a> to which I have a subscription (and AmRen advertises on its home page).  You will NEVER see such reports in the American propaganda media:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Chris Van Zyl of the Transvaal Agricultural Union said in a phone interview that in one recent case, a man&rsquo;s soles were stripped from his feet while alive. An elderly woman&rsquo;s breasts were sliced off; another was gang-raped. Another was raped with a broken bottle.</p>
<p>The police and government have no statistics on farm killings. Van Zyl&rsquo;s group has recorded 1,266 slayings and 2,070 attacks since 2001. Other groups say more than 3,000 farmers have been killed in the last 16 years.</p>
<p>Van Zyl said that 78 farmers were killed in 2008, 55 last year and 19 this year, and that nonfatal attacks had increased dramatically. Most victims were elderly people on isolated farms&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>There is also a video of Dan Roodt on the praag link explaining why SA&rsquo;s Whites are experiencing a genocide.  I urge everyone to listen to it.  I&rsquo;ve read SA writers that believe the blacks have &#8216;behaved themselves&rsquo; for the 2010 World Cup and that after it is over, they plan to unleash a holocaust on the remaining Whites, especially White farmers.  </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The previous ANC minister of police, Charles Nqakula, cynically stated that if &#8220;you want to whinge about crime and violence, you are free to emigrate&#8221;. This was a coded message in which the six million members of the ANC Youth League were given carte blanche to expel all whites from South Africa, just like Robert Mugabe did in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>The current ANC Youth League leader, Julius Malema&hellip;has continued to sing the song &#8216;Shoot the Afrikaners! Shoot! Shoot!&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The lefties and media in the West wring their hands over &#8216;killings in Dafur&rsquo; or &#8216;AIDS orphans in Africa&rsquo; or &#8216;Bantu refugees fleeing violent warfare&rsquo; and tons of aid in the form of billions of White American taxpayer dollars are helicoptered into Africa and 80,000 unassimilable Somali/Bantu refugees are offered re-settlement in the US.</p>
<p>Yet Whites in SA  &mdash;  children, elderly, women, systematically slaughtered, raped and victimized in SA and Zim&hellip;.nothing, silence, no refugee status offered to them by the US.</p>
<p>The War on Whites is world-wide, and our lives are worthless and expendable according to the evil, hateful marxists that control the media and government. </p>

		<p>&#8220;But why? Why not for the country? Why hide a spectacular hotel and a spa on the edge of the river and not share it with the rest of South Africa?&#8221;</p>
<p>This is perhaps the most stupid question ever asked in the history os asking questions. I mean, what deos he even MEAN? Share it?! Serioudly what is he talking about? Is he suggesting that the town leaders travel South Africa teaching mayors of other cities how to run things? Is he asking the people of Orania to let millions of black South Africans move in? I&rsquo;m seriously confused.</p>
<p>And the guy who wrote this is clearly an idiot. Why does he think Orania is well-off? Because it has a pretty name that sounds like a delectable fruit? Absolutely not!!! He should ask himself: what deos this little village have that no other locality in South Africa has? The answer, of course, is a 100% white population! Now you can either have that, or a system of racial hierarchies similar to Apartheid. But you CANNOT have blacks running a damn thing and expect it to be successful. If I were the leaders of Orania, I would say &#8220;Sure, we&rsquo;ll fix the country! Just remove black voting rights, give us a decade or two, and we&rsquo;ll have the whole thing straightened out.&#8221; And that truly WOULD be a great solution to SA&rsquo;s myriad of problems.</p>
<p>Also, why on God&rsquo;s green earth is it acceptable for minorities to be insular and to avoid others, but not for whites? Just one of many liberal paradoxes.</p>
