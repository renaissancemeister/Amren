			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Madhur Singh, Time, June 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Indian marketers have a field day in putting &#8216;blacks&rsquo; where they&rsquo;ve always &#8216;belonged,&rsquo; at least in the average Indian mind-sets,&#8221; wrote S.K.Y. Banji, a Ugandan who has lived in India for more than four years and runs the Reign Times. {snip}</p>
<p>One of the commercials in question, for Coca-Cola&rsquo;s Sprite  &mdash;  which a Coca-Cola spokesperson says was received &#8220;very positively&#8221; by a test audience in India  &mdash;  shows two young Indian men captured by savages in an African jungle. While one of them tries to win over the captors by doing a silly jig, the other simply offers them Sprite. &#8220;There is nothing offensive in this ad,&#8221; says Martha Wariithi, a Kenyan by birth who is the director of knowledge and insights for Coca-Cola&rsquo;s India and South West Asia unit. {snip}</p>
<p>The Indian lemon drink LMN, produced by the Parle Agro corporation, has a blatantly racist subtext in its TV spot that shows two Africans digging in the sand for water. When they spot a tap nearby, they wrench it off and start using it as a shovel. {snip}</p>
<p>Another spot, for BP&rsquo;s Castrol engine oil, shows two young Indian men being magically transported from place to place: a beach, a lion-infested jungle  &mdash;  and a cauldron being carried by smiling African cannibals. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s amazing how two global companies, in an age of YouTube and Twitter, can think they can get away with such blatantly racist advertising,&#8221; says Hari Krishnan, vice president at the Delhi office of ad agency JWT. {snip} Indeed, many Indians do not see the advertisements as racist or offensive. Despite their experience with prejudice abroad even today, most Indians seem prone to accept easy generalizations about other peoples and cultures.</p>
<p>&#8220;These ads could never be aired in the U.S.,&#8221; says Diepiriye Kuku, a Delhi-based Nigerian-American conflict-resolution consultant who blogs on his exposure to prejudice in India, a country he says is decades behind the U.S. in addressing racial issues.</p>
<p>Kuku wrote an article titled &#8220;India Is Racist and Happy About It&#8221; in a leading Indian newsmagazine last year. {snip} &#8220;But,&#8221; he points out, &#8220;Indians don&rsquo;t only stereotype foreigners. They stereotype other Indians too.&#8221; Indeed, racism against northeastern Indians  &mdash;  whose features often have more in common with those of people in countries farther east and who are the subject of various myths about their sexuality  &mdash;  is widely documented. And the fact that skin-lightening creams are one of the fastest-growing product lines in India&rsquo;s cosmetics sector reflects an obsession with fair skin.</p>

		<p>First off, some of the names of the people in this article really lend themselves to stereotyping.  </p>
<p>Second, I think this article is written from the white liberal perspective of walking on racial eggshells as normal.  Why can&rsquo;t these same libs apply their own logic to India, and not be so bigoted about its own racial mores?  IOW, maybe the perspective is wrong   &mdash;   We shouldn&rsquo;t be asking why India doesn&rsquo;t tow the PC line, India should be asking why we&rsquo;re so uptight all the time about race.</p>
<p>Of course, that there is no such thing as a Pradesh Poverty Law Center is telling.</p>

		<p>Given India&rsquo;s long-standing and rigid caste system, none of this should be surprising. To them, Africans are likely even lower than their own &#8220;untouchables.&#8221;</p>

<p><br>
Exactly. Although in many ways India is still an overpopulated mess of a country, on the race issue, a much saner and healthier society than 2010 USA. Unlike white Americans, Indians are not required to deny the evidence of their own eyes and ears about differences between the world&rsquo;s various ethnicities and racial groups. If sub-Saharans strike the average Brahmin as backwards and primitive   &mdash;   as well they should   &mdash;   he is free to say so. </p>
<p>Due to a half-century of PC indoctrination, we Western whites are not. We must either keep such thoughts to ourselves, or (outside of AmRen) express our concerns in the softest, vaguest, most innocuous terms possible. </p>
<p>Also, based on the (very funny) examples of &#8220;racist&#8221; TV commercials cited in the article, India&rsquo;s advertising industry appears superior to ours too. The one about Africans using a faucet to dig for water is hilarious. </p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s something called just telling a joke. Commercials that are funny earn a kind of appreciation from the audience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting&hellip; the commercial that purports to show two Indians in a cauldron being carried by smiling African cannibals&hellip; if we didn&rsquo;t live in bizarro-backward world&hellip; wouldn&rsquo;t this be seen as insensitive to the Indians up for dinner. Weren&rsquo;t Indians in Africa killed by cannibals? An occurrence that more or less still goes on today? Weren&rsquo;t Indians kicked out of African countries? But I suppose I&rsquo;m being bigoted and &#8216;insensitive&rsquo; again, towards Africans.</p>
<p>It seems the world still has a kind of caste-system. Quite different from the one that we must Learn about being evil. </p>

		<p>This has made me remember an amusing ad for washing machines aired on Australian TV back in the 90s.<br>
A bunch of poor Indian women are washing their clothes at the river bank, and drying them by belting them on the rocks nearby.<br>
Washing machines appear and the women are wide-eyed with amazement. Then, they start belting their clothes on the washing machines.<br>
Not a complaint that I could remember.</p>

<p>When my late father was being treated for cancer (his doctor was a young ABC (American-born Chinese)), on one occasion he was admitted to the hospital in severe pain.  He was promptly put into a common room with four other patients (one of whom was black).  When his doctor arrived and saw my father&rsquo;s predicament, he was appalled that my father had not been put into at least a semi-private room. According to my father, this is EXACTLY what the doctor told him:</p>
<p>Doctor: (looking around room) &#8220;Oh no!  I&rsquo;m getting you out of here right now!  Three other patients&hellip;(looking over at black patient, then leaning towards my father) AND THAT?!?&#8221; </p>
<p>My dad told me the severe pain he was in was the only reason he didn&rsquo;t immediately bust out laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;But they can get away with it, and they know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Only to a degree, AND THEY KNOW IT.  Did you know, for example, that many if not most times Southern and Northeast Asians are not included in affirmative action programs in school admissions and hiring?  Why?</p>
<p>Because if they did include them, there&rsquo;d be no room for the mass of low-IQ blacks out there.</p>
<p>The following article was written 15 years ago, but it could have easily been written yesterday.  It&rsquo;s long, so I&rsquo;ll post the pertinent parts.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.city-journal.org/html/5_2_a2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.city-journal.org/html/5_2_a2.html</a></p>
<p>&#8220;One final problem that is leading would-be or actual immigrants to rethink the U.S. is racial tension. Koreans who do business in the inner city have been the target of racial extortion &mdash; thinly veiled threats to &#8220;give back to the community&#8221; or face boycotts and even violence. &#8220;Koreans are the most successful business group in the black community, which is why they target us, &#8221; says Kee Young Lee, a vice president of the &#8220;Korean News.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But nothing has had as profound an impact on Koreans&rsquo; ideas about America as the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Six hundred Korean-American businesses in South Central Los Angeles and 200 in Koreatown were damaged or destroyed; Koreans sustained 45 percent of all riot damage. In New York an armed gang vandalized a Korean dry cleaner in the South Bronx in sympathy with the Los Angeles rioters, and vandals shattered the windows of a Korean grocer in Bedford-Stuyvesant as they taunted him with a racist rap song.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No other group of small-business owners is subject to such pressure to redistribute its resources, and no other has responded with such a variety of initiatives. Yet these efforts provide no more certain a guarantee against racial animosity than did similar efforts in Los Angeles before the riots.&#8221;</p>

<p>I once had a Mexican friend  (but a naturalized US citizen) who detested blacks and made absolutely no secret of it.  He let them know in ways that no American white would dream of. (He told me he didn&rsquo;t consider them human.) In public, it was sometimes embarassing!  He would insult West Indians, telling them bluntly that they had no business being here.  </p>
<p>He also became extremely annoyed at the increasing numbers of Chinese immigrants. He would give them glares on the street and shove them in elevators.  Talk about prejudice! I found this odd, because he was also very sensitive about any anti-Mexican sentiments.  But he didn&rsquo;t see any discrepancy.<br>

<p>Not odd at all, actually.  It&rsquo;s called &#8220;group competition&#8221;. It&rsquo;s a hallmark of primate behavior.  Only Whites are not allowed to engage in it.</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/27e9uwe" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/27e9uwe</a></p>
<p>&#8220;In many primate species, encounters between neighboring social groups are frequently aggressive, but the functions of these interactions remain poorly understood&hellip;Identifying the functions of intergroup aggression will help to clarify the effects of between-group competition for the evolution of primate social behavior, including modern humans.&#8221;</p>
<p>He saw no &#8216;discrepancy&rsquo; because there was none.</p>

		<p>My wife and inlaws are east indian (they are very arian white) and what they think of blacks and latinos is scandalous. At least most of us whites, even conservative ones, are at least willing to give non-whites a place at the table, no matter how small, but many Asians I know - well, let&rsquo;s just say it&rsquo;s good that Asia is not next to the sahara.</p>

		<p>This is one thing that all asians will agree on.There is an enclave of blacks on the east coast of India-from a portugeese slave ship -These people ars definitly on the lowest rung of the Indian cast system. East Timor are mixed malay/african,and they are not accepted by indonesians on an equal basis,but there are other reasons also -such as religion,and Colonial heritage..Japan will not even let decendants of their korean slaves equal rights -even today..</p>
