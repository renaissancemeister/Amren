<h1>Far-Right Breakthrough Shocks Netherlands</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alex Rossi, Sky News (London), June 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Voters in the Netherlands have continued a Europe-wide shift to the political right by endorsing a pro-business party in the country&rsquo;s parliamentary elections  &mdash;  and also giving a surge of suport to the far right.</p>
<p>The center-right VVD party claimed victory and immediately pledged to cut government spending and get tough on immigration.</p>
<p>The party leader and possible Prime Minster in waiting, Mark Rutte, called the win a &#8220;splendid success.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It appears as if for the first time in our history the VVD has become the largest party in the Netherlands,&#8221; Mr Rutte told chanting supporters in the seaside town of Scheveningen.</p>
<p>With most of the votes counted his party currently leads the Labor party by one seat.</p>
<p>It means the next few weeks will be spent horse trading over a number of coalition permutations.</p>
<p>Labor&rsquo;s leader, Job Cohen, said the election was still too close to call.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s very exciting. But the real result is still to come, and it could go either way.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s conceivable that Mr Cohen could become PM if Mr Rutte fails to find enough support for his coalition.</p>
<p>The other winner of the night was the controversial, platinum haired Geert Wilders.</p>
<p>His anti-Islam Freedom Party was given a massive boost by voters and came third in the poll.</p>
<p>He has increased his number of seats from 9 to 24.</p>
<p>A position in the cabinet for him is now a possibility. Wilders said he was willing to accept compromises in order to secure a seat at the top table.</p>
<p>Kees Berghuis, Hague bureau chief for RTL 4Holland, told Sky News: &#8220;(Wilders) has a strong hand in negotiations as he is the third party. He is THE winner of the elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people don&rsquo;t want to negotiate with him but they will have to now  &mdash;  he has grown too big.</p>
<p>&#8220;He had one (non-negotiable) &#8216;break point&rsquo;  &mdash;  he wouldn&rsquo;t raise the retirement age. But he has just dropped it as he desperately wants to be a part of the government.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other parties may try &#8220;to shove us aside, but we must be taken seriously. Nobody in The Hague can bypass the PVV anymore,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The governing Christian Democrats suffered a humiliating defeat, dropping to 21 seats  &mdash;  nearly half its current strength  &mdash;  and Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende told supporters he was leaving politics.</p>
<p>The most likely outcome though appears to be a centrist coalition with VVD and Labor combining with two smaller parties on the left.</p>
<p>In theory Wilders and his Freedom Party could play a role but his polarizing stances have made him morally repugnant to other parties.</p>
<p>He is currently under hate speech prosecution for comparing Islam to Nazism and for calling for a ban on the Quran.</p>
<p>The swing to the right in Holland follows a trend across Europe.</p>
<p>The UK dumped Labour last month  &mdash;  Germany and France are also governed by centre right parties.<br>

		<p>How can the Netherlands be &#8220;shocked&#8221; by this &#8220;far-right breakthrough&#8221; when they&rsquo;re the ones who voted for it?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;In theory Wilders and his Freedom Party could play a role but his <b>polarizing</b> stances have made him <b>morally repugnant</b> to other parties.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Thanks, Alex Rossi, for telling us how to think about Geert Wilders and the Freedom Party.  I was afraid I&rsquo;d have to make up my own mind.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;He is currently under hate speech prosecution for comparing Islam to Nazism and for calling for a ban on the Quran.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Apparently the bar for qualification as &#8220;far right&#8221; is lower than I ever imagined.<br>

		<p>You have to wonder how many more votes Wilders would have gotten if he wasn&rsquo;t smeared so much and his ideas were taken seriously by the main stream media. If Dutch people weren&rsquo;t intimidated by political correctness and threats of hate speech prosecution, how many more would feel comfortable voting for him? </p>

		<p>I find the press to be morally repugnant, not the Freedom Party.  I also find it interesting that every political party against the immigration invasion is called &#8220;far right&#8221;, no matter how socialist their domestic policies are.  I also note that the press almost never labels anybody as &#8220;far left&#8221;.</p>

		<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t be getting too excited about this.  Wilders is not really on our side.  His ideology is similar to a neoconservative type in the USA.  He insists that race doesn&rsquo;t matter and that the only issue is &#8220;Islam.&#8221;  We all know how when a politician in the US, even one who has taken many anti-white positions, makes a politically incorrect statement, the media denounces them as a new Hitler.  They are doing the same thing with Wilders.  He isn&rsquo;t all they are making him out to be.</p>

<p>Exactly. For YEARS [?], Wilders has had to live in a prison. That is the only place the police have confidence they can protect the man? What sort of life is that? And is that what a &#8220;right-winger&#8221; must have to put up with? I guess so!<br>

It is interesting; I think it betrays that race-replacement is by far the most important objective of the left. In general, they give priority to social policy over the economic, but they are especially devoted to their racial politics. </p>

		<p>The journalist, Alex Rossi, shows himself to be desperately clutching at straws when he seeks, by implication, to associate the Clegg-Cameron coalition that has recently replaced New Labour with a general rightward shift in Europe.</p>
<p>The Con-Dems, as they are unaffectionately known, represent no serious shift away from the policies of New Labour, other than to moderate some of their many more economically right-wing policies.</p>

<p>You bring up an interesting point.  I don&rsquo;t understand why the extreme far right dislikes Jews so much that they always give Muslims a pass.  This has never made any sense to me.</p>
<p>Every group deserves to exist in their own lands, which I recognize, but other than that, what is so special about Muslims and why should Western Civilization admire them so much?  </p>
<p>During Europe&rsquo;s Dark Ages they temporarily preserved Greek knowledge and then added to it a little bit, but that is about it, and I think liberal historians give them way too much credit for things that Renaissance Europeans did on their own.  Muslims (particularly arabs) had very little to do with the making of the modern world.</p>
<p>All of this aside, regardless of what they did or didn&rsquo;t do, there is no reason to give them a pass and make excuses for them every time there is a terrorist story in the news or every time they misbehave in a white country.</p>
<p>This is where the extreme far right and the likes of David Duke hurt themselves.  I am glad Amren has more sense.<br>

		<p>I predict the growth of rightist parties bodes well for Israel. Zionism was born from anti-Semitic racialist politics. It transformed the negative into a positive; accepted race and soil, as the Nazis had, and transferred that loyalty to Israel. It is the complete opposite of hand-wringing liberal politics. <br>
The Islamic immigration into Europe needs liberal self-loathing; were Europeans to return to a &#8220;Blut und Boden&#8221; worldview they would find themselves again and find a new ally in Israel. <br>
Liberals, it seems, hate borders and boundaries. As a consequence they cannot see the most elemental differences, such as between their own people and outsiders. <br>
Nature punishes blindness. </p>

<p>Neither have I.  I notice that this is being said quite often lately   &mdash;   on what factual basis I cannot imagine.</p>
<p>I also agree completely with ATBOTL that Wilders is not really on our side, and that that he&rsquo;s not everything that some special interests are making him out to be. <i>[He insists that race doesn&rsquo;t matter and that the only issue is &ldquo;Islam.&rdquo;]</i>  That&rsquo;s not an Amrener!  We here recognize that there are many issues that matter, not just one.  And race is at the top of our list. It&rsquo;s not even on Wilders&rsquo; list.</p>
<p>And I agree with Johnny English, who observes that the article is clutching at straws by impling that the recent British election implies a &#8220;general rightward shift in Europe&#8221;. Such nonsense. Would that it were so!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m disappointed when people criticize Wilders for being too &#8220;neo-con&#8221; or not enough of a race realist, or whatever. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no expert on Dutch politics, but can his success be explained in any other way than by his views on immigration and his appeal to white dutch people&rsquo;s sense of anxiety over the changing demographics of their country? In this sense, he is someone we should be interested in and supportive of.</p>
<p>He may not be a perfect representative of what some look for in a racially conscious white pol, but he is clearly at the forefront of white political consciousness in Europe. His example may help develop and pave the way for someone we like even better in years to come.</p>
<p>Thoughtfully criticize him? Sure, why not? Tear him down or disregard him for not being &#8220;pure&#8221; enough by some standard or another? Utterly wrongheaded. And self-marginalizing too. Wilders actually has power. We here in the states have almost none. We have something to learn from him.</p>

<p>I think those who think that Wilders and the PVV are too &#8220;neo-connish&#8221; are using these words as a circumlocution for their own anti-Semitism.  They presume that a pol or anyone whose only consternation with non-whites are Muslims is someone being manipulated by &#8220;The Jews.&#8221;  I can prove that they&rsquo;re way off base, because the leader of the main center-left party is Job Cohen, Jewish, and he is pro-Muslim and anti-Wilders.  </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not SKIP, and I don&rsquo;t know if he actually enjoyed the Koran, but he was pro-Islam in as much as it served his interests.  Information on that is not hard to find.  I have a book on it, but I have not unpacked my books since my last move yet.  It is fairly easy to find on the internet though, and not Wikipedia.  </p>
<p>Germany had a business relationship growing with Turkey before WW1 because of their need for oil as they grew into the largest European industrial state.  Recall that it was this that made the other nations nervous about the Kaiser&rsquo;s real intentions.  During WW1, Germany was allied with Turkey, again for oil.  As early as the 30s, the Nazis were running interference against Jewish settlements in Palestine by courting various Islamic kings and sheiks, including King Feisel.  The Baath party was the Arab version of the national socialist party and was helped along by the Nazis.  There are photos of Nazis with various Arab leaders.  Also, Nazis campaigned politically in the Balkans so that they would have an ally against the Serbs.  I have seen photos from those meetings as well.  Ex-nazis were present in Palestine after WW2 and worked to assist anti-Jewish and anti-Israeli feeling up to and after the establishment of Israel in 1948.</p>
<p>So Hitler had an interest in Muslims as allies.  He no doubt feared the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine because it would likely have interfered with his oil requirements and likely become a military adversary as well.  Look up the history of the Baath Party, you will find a lot of this in there.</p>
<p>Hitler was a Christian.  I do have a book entitled, The Holy Riech, that details Hitler&rsquo;s own beliefs, his links to the Vatican, etc.  Many claim that Nazis were pagans, etc., but that is only partly true.  It was Himmler who was fascinated with the occult.  It served Nazism to remind people of their pre-Christian glory as warriors led by Wodin, etc.  </p>
<p>That is the one item that I happen to believe is needed for whites today because we need to see ourselves as racial, ethnic warriors rather than contradictory Christians with confused allegiances.  As one poster wrote, it is all about blood and soil.  I would add ancestors to that.</p>

		<p>Yes, Wilders&rsquo; success is due to Dutch anxieties about race and immigration, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean he will actually do anything to to keep the Netherlands predominately white.  The success of the Republicans in American since Nixon was elected hase largely been due to white Americans&rsquo; anxieties about race and immigration, but obviously voting for Republicans has only made these problems worse.</p>
<p>Wilders denounced the BNP and all people who notice racial differences between blacks and whites in a recent interview.  Muslims aren&rsquo;t the only non-white immigrants in the Netherlands.  Obviously, anyone who only criticizes Muslims and not other non-white immigrants has an agenda different from ours.</p>

		<p>To SKIP, and ghw as well as others who want to know if Hitler was in league with Muslims. I have a source for you, which says he was.</p>
<p>In his book, &#8220;The Sword of the Prophet&#8221;, Serge Trifkovic, says the Grand Mufti of Palestine, named Husseini, wrote to Hitler expressing his support for the Holocaust, and urging that more Jews be &#8220;resettled&#8221; into Poland and Austria. Hitler, of course, ruled with an iron fist, which most Muslims actually find admirable. That&rsquo;s why they also allied themselves with the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact nations. On the other hand, most Muslims despise democracy, since it tends to provide for separation of church and state, and gives women rights that they don&rsquo;t have in Islamic nations.</p>
<p>Hitler admired the parts of the Koran which criticizes Jews, since he felt it justified his own feelings in &#8220;Mein Kampf&#8221;. Trifkovic goes on to say that Husseini should have been tried as a war criminal at Nuremburg, because of his collaboration with the Nazis.</p>

<p>Indeed they do.  Or they are very naive, or just uninformed (as a few obviously are). </p>
<p>But other posters here are far too savvy about political details to be so naive as that. They know better. They are being  deliberately disingenuous when they claim not to see any other elements involved in this complex picture.  And, still worse, they are creating a distraction when they bring up, gratuitously and out of nowhere, the issue of &#8220;anti-semitism&#8221;   &mdash;   which amounts to throwing a wrench into the machinery and bringing all discussion to a grinding halt.  A classic strategy  (just like screaming &#8220;racism!&#8221;) to silence unwanted opinions and circumvent debate.</p>
<p>One has to wonder what is their agenda. If they are unconcerned with the RACIAL transformation of Europe, but solely with Muslims, their agenda is not amicable to ours.</p>
<p>That is to say, Muslims are PART of the problem, but they are not THE problem. The underlying problem, the terrible sickness, that is killing Europe,  goes much deeper than that. </p>
<p>And, by the way, a good many of the Muslims in the Netherlands are Europeans and white. Not all, certainly, but I have seen some who are fully as white as I am.  They run the gamut of colors. The point here is that religion is one thing, and race is another.   Amren is a racial site, not a religious one.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Wilders&rsquo;s party now largest in Dutch parliament.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think the comment found under the article&rsquo;s headline on AmRen&rsquo;s homepage is confusing the VVD (People&rsquo;s Party for Freedom and Democracy) for Geert Wilders&rsquo;s party, which is the PVV (Party for Freedom). Wilders&rsquo;s party is third largest now (not first, which is the place of the VVD) in the Dutch parliament with the votes tallied from this general election.</p>

		<p>ghw,</p>
<p>It is a shame that the Muslim/Jewish issue is such a sensitive topic on websites like this.  Both sides get misunderstood.  </p>
<p>I agree with you that the neo-cons go too far in one direction&hellip;defending Jews on every front while acting as if Muslims are the only enemy.</p>
<p>However, I don&rsquo;t see any posters on this website, such as myself, agreeing fully with neocons.  I acknowledge that both Muslims and Jews have caused problems in white societies.  </p>
<p>What posters such as myself get tired of, is how the David Duke followers constantly blame Jews for every single issue and NEVER hold Muslims accountable for anything.  The more I read David Duke&rsquo;s stuff, the less I like, and the more he loses credibility.  He seems to be more concerned with the well-being of arab Muslims than his own people.  He never holds them accountable for anything, and he seems to think arabs inparticular are just as civilized and intelligent as whites.</p>
<p>I am misunderstanding your point about some Muslim immigrants in Europe being white.  Does that mean they should be there?  Why do people in this movement constantly demonize the whitest people in the Middle East (Jews), while at the same time making exceptions for &#8220;white&#8221; Muslims.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, I think both groups have their faults, and I acknowledge that both groups have caused problems in Western societies.  Having said that, I recognize both groups&rsquo; rights to live, however, I don&rsquo;t think either group should be allowed to have large influences in Western Christian nations.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Hitler was a Christian. I do have a book entitled, The Holy Riech, that details Hitler&rsquo;s own beliefs, his links to the Vatican, etc.&#8221; Whiteplight</p>
<p>   Hitler was not a Christian, but a believer in &ldquo;Providence&rdquo;.  He could be considered a sort of vague Deist. He did cut many deals with the German churches, particularly the Vatican. If Germany had won the war, I doubt he would have honored most of those agreements.  He personally admired Stalin, despite the differences in ideology.  The two dictators copied each other to a greater extent than is commonly supposed. </p>
<p>Wilders would never win an election in Holland on a pro-white platform. The Dutch are far too &#8220;respectable&#8221; and liberal to vote for a pro indigenous party. Geert Wilders specifically attacks Islam and Muslim immigration, but I believe he wishes to limit all immigration. This is ultimately what white nationalists want as well. He has made common cause with Neo-Con pundits and politicians, but politics makes for strange bedfellows.<br>

		<p>Amren permitted an insult of Gert Wilders by #4 Question Diversity and I quote &#8220;And Wilders a Nazi&#8221;<br>
#4 Just insulted Gert Wilders by calling him a NAZI. Where is the evidence that he is a NAZI. Just because someone says that he is a Nazi we are to accept that he is a Nazi no way do I accept that. </p>

		<p>Just to add to one of these conversations.<br>
The following documentary on the connections between the Baath and Nazi parties shows footage of the meeting between Mohammad Amin al-Husayni, the (Sunni) Grand Mufti of Jerusalem and Hitler in December 1941. <a href="http://tinyurl.com/nq582v" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/nq582v</a> (Image) </p>

		<p>Question:  How did this article   &mdash;   originally about a Dutch election   &mdash;   degenerate into a bickering session about Nazis, Jews, and Hitler?  How did all of THIS come into the discussion???</p>
<p>And who cares what alliance Muslims made in 1935?  The date today is 2010.</p>

		<p>Some criticism has been leveled at Wilders for paying to much attention to the muslims and not enough to, perhaps, blacks but the two are one and the same in Europe. If any have been there, I think you would agree, especially France and the Netherlands&hellip;.totally ate up with rowdy, rude, obnoxious, dangerous black muslims. They are particularly dangerous to White women of any age.</p>

I have personally seen quite a lot of this sort of thing over here in the more than 6 years I have been involved with the muslim wars. That is EXACTLY what they are too, MUSLIM WARS and only one of us is getting out of the war alive.</p>
