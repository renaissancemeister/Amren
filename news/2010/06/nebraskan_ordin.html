<h1>Nebraskan Ordinance Adds Fuel to US Immigration Debate</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Anna Fifield, Financial Times (London), June 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>US efforts to counter its illegal immigration problem have become more complicated, with the small Nebraska city of Fremont voting to ban undocumented people from taking jobs or renting property.</p>
<p>The ban, approved on Monday night by 57 per cent of voters in an eastern Nebraska city far from the Mexican border, is the latest example of communities taking immigration matters into their own hands.</p>
<p>It will increase concerns in the US administration and among civil liberties advocates about the patchwork of state regulations that is appearing because of federal inaction.</p>
<p>Arizona passed a controversial law in April that allows police officers to request immigration documents from anyone they stop, raising fears of racial profiling.</p>
<p>The US administration is expected to next week file a lawsuit against Arizona over the law, on the basis that immigration is the constitutional responsibility of the federal government.</p>
<p>The Fremont ordinance means that people will have to apply for a licence before they can rent property, and the application process will require immigration documents. It also mandates employers to check whether people are eligible to work using the federal government&rsquo;s &#8220;E-Verify&#8221; database.</p>
<p>Fremont, a meat-packing town with about 25,000 residents, has seen its Hispanic population rise from about 165 people in 1990 to an estimated 2,060.</p>
<p>Some of those who voted for the initiative said it would help ensure jobs went to legal residents who were unemployed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has nothing to do with being racist,&#8221; Clint Walraven, a 51-year-old who has lived in Fremont all his life, told the Associated Press. &#8220;We all have to play by the same rules.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;If you want to stay here, get legal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nebraska has an unemployment rate of 4.9 per cent, about half the national rate.</p>
<p>The American Civil Liberties Union said it would sue to block the ordinance before it takes effect.</p>
<p>&#8220;If this law goes into effect, it will cause discrimination and racial profiling against Latinos and others who appear to be foreign born, including US citizens,&#8221; said Laurel Marsh, executive director of ACLU&rsquo;s Nebraska branch.</p>
<p>Immigration reform advocates said the Fremont ordinance was &#8220;bad news&#8221;.</p>
<p>Barack Obama, when campaigning for the presidency two years ago, pledged to act on immigration reform. But his administration, encumbered with higher priorities such as fixing the economy and reforming healthcare, has put immigration on the back burner.</p>
<p>In spite of increasing calls for it to act on immigration, the prospects for passing a comprehensive reform bill are not auspicious.</p>
<p>Analysts say it would be impossible for Democrats and Republicans alike to tackle the issue before the November midterm elections. Things might not get better next year, if Republicans succeed in taking control of either chamber.<br/>

								<h2>Nebraska Town, Angered by Influx of Workers at Meatpacking Plant, Votes on Immigration Measure</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Timberly Ross, Star Tribune (Minneapolis-St. Paul), June 20, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Angered by a recent influx of Hispanic workers attracted by jobs at local meatpacking plants, voters in the eastern Nebraska city of Fremont will decide Monday whether to ban hiring or renting property to illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A man who helped write the Arizona law is helping to fight for the ordinance in Fremont, which has seen its Hispanic population surge in the past two decades. That increase is largely because they were recruited to work for the Fremont Beef and Hormel plants, and the city maintains an enviably low unemployment rate.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, residents worry that jobs are going to illegal immigrants who they fear could drain community resources.</p>
<p>{snip} Discussions on the issue can get heated, he [a long-time Fremont resident] said, particularly if racism is mentioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has nothing to do with being racist,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We all have to play by the same rules.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If you want to stay here, get legal.&#8221;</p>
<p>When he worked at the Hormel plant in the 1980s, Walraven said, he had one Hispanic co-worker.<br/>

		<p>One of the arguments used against this ordinance is that Fremont, NE&rsquo;s unemployment rate is about half the supposed national average.  The problem is is that if you factor out all the legal and illegal Hispanics working at the chicken plucking plant in town, the unemployment rate for native born white Americans is probably that high, if not higher.</p>
<p>Not to mention that the city&rsquo;s Hispanic population is probably responsible for most of its crime, so there are concerns other than economic here.  Man does not live on bread alone.</p>

		<p>The point of all these towns passing ordinances is simple.  If even one ignores the federal, state supreme, or supreme courts it will signal that the federal government can no longer enforce its will on local and state governments&hellip;..can no longer force districts to share the consequences equally&hellip;.so they won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>This will set off a flurry of competition among states.  Competition for what?  For taxpayers.  For wealth creators.  They will want as crime free, as tax friendly, as high standard of living as possible.  They will want to minimize their criminal and welfare classes.  De facto separation will result.</p>

		<p>Hopefully, there will be so much anti-illegal laws that the ACLU/similar organizations will run of money to file lawsuits against.  Just wishfull thinking.  Those type of organizations are well-funded by corporations/private foundations.  Off course, the seed money from those organizations came from the American consumers.  What a racket.  So, now the Feds will file lawsuits against its own citizens.  Similar kind of behavior that forced segregation.  Now, we all dealing with everything being dumbed down.  It is pathetic.</p>

		<p>Yay Us! Guess who asked for the ban? The police! That&rsquo;s why it passed! The police were arresting 5X the people over ten years ago and they are 90% mexican. (I promise to stop using exclamation points, but it&rsquo;s really hard while jigging.)</p>
<p>On top of the evidence of our lying eyes, we had the worst/lamest threats from the libs. They actually had the gall to tell us that taxes would go up because of legal actions. </p>
<p>Oh, and it ain&rsquo;t chickens, this is pork and beef country.</p>

		<p>Because of greedy white businessmen who will do anything for a buck white people are in a terrible situation today.  The downfall started in earnest with white businessmen wanting &#8220;free&#8221; black labor.  White people could have done everything black people did in the Americas and we would be so much better off.  Instead the seeds of multiculturalism were born by bringing non-white people into white society.  Multiculturalism is about wanting what white people have from land to hair to education.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of other Nebraska towns that should follow suit.</p>
<p>Columbus<br/>
Schuyler<br/>
Grand Island<br/>
Lexington (Mexington)</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve all been dramatically changed since the late 80s/early 90s by the meatpacking industry&rsquo;s thirst for cheap labor.  I guess you could add Omaha to the list.  They&rsquo;ve had a growing illegal population for the last 15 years as well.</p>

		<p>Finally, it is about time that someone is challenging the Mexican invasion and, make no mistake, this is a foreign invasion facilitated by domestic business interests.  Have been wondering why corporate interests along with liberal socialists have been trying to replace the white working class with Mexicans.  They are probably doing that because Mexicans are cheaper, more docile, and less intelligent.  Their average iq is in the high 80&rsquo;s.<br/>
   I strongly recommend folks educate themselves by also taking a look at the vdare site: http://www.vdare.com/rushton/070926_indians.htm:</p>
<p>There are large inequalities in average IQ scores between groups.  Herrnstein and Murray&rsquo;s (1994) The Bell Curve  reported that the average IQ for &#8220;African&#8221; Americans is lower than those for &#8220;Latino&#8221;,  &#8220;White&#8221;, &#8220;East Asian&#8221;, and &#8220;Jewish&#8221; Americans (IQs = 85, 89, 103, 106, and 115, respectively, pp. 273-278).</p>
<p>In the 1970s the IQ debate became worldwide when British psychologist Richard Lynn showed that compared to a White IQ average of 100, East Asians average about 105 and sub-Saharan Africans around 70.</p>
<p>By 2006, Lynn had tabulated 620 IQ studies in 133 different countries. He clustered the countries into the ten genetic groupings identified by L. L. Cavalli-Sforza et al. in their mammoth 1994 History and Geography of Human Genes. The world average IQ had to be calibrated downwards to 90, as shown in the map.<br/>
World Distribution of IQ Scores of Indigenous (pre European migration)<br/>
Peoples (Adapted from Lynn, 2006).</p>
<p>East Asians (Chinese, Japanese and Koreans) obtain the highest mean IQ at 105. Europeans follow with an IQ of 100. Some ways below these are the Inuit or Eskimos (IQ 91), South East Asians (IQ 87), Native American Indians (IQ 87), Pacific Islanders (IQ 85), and South Asians and North Africans (IQ 84). Well below these are the sub-Saharan Africans (IQ 67), the Australian Aborigines (IQ 62), the Bushmen of the Kalahari Desert, and the Pygmies of the Congo rain forests (IQ 54).</p>
<p>Even a few years ago, news of drastically lower mean IQs for any population group &mdash; as low as 70 to 85 in Africa &mdash; would have been considered not only an absurdity, but also an injustice. Yet new empirical work continues to show a world IQ average of 90. It continues to show that mean IQs of 70 are found routinely in sub-Saharan Africa and that mean IQs of 70 to 90 are typical of many other regions of the world. Outside of European and East Asian populations, an average IQ as high as 100 is seldom found. </p>

		<p>Corruption is a systemic part of Hispanic culture and it is legendary in Mexico.  </p>
<p>The rotten apple spoiling the whole barrel analogy best defines the influence of corruption upon a society.  </p>
<p>Because Mexican illegals use stolen identities, undercut traditional wages and work off the books; they have corrupted the American employer.  </p>
<p>Punish the American employers who hire illegals and the corruption problem will be solved…  </p>
