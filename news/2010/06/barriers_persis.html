			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Toronto Star, June 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Visible minorities in Ontario are far more likely to live in poverty, face higher unemployment and receive less pay, says a new report.</p>
<p>And women are worse off because sexism and racial discrimination pack a &#8220;double wallop,&#8221; says the study released Thursday by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives.</p>
<p>&#8220;The findings in this study point to the overwhelming need for governments to step in with policies to help break down racial and gender barriers,&#8221; says Sheila Block, a researcher with the centre.</p>
<p>Based on data collected in 2005, which formed the basis of the 2006 census, the report found working women from visible minorities earned about half as much as men who were not from visible minorities.</p>
<p>Visible minorities had an unemployment rate of 8.7 per cent in 2005, compared with 5.8 per cent for the rest of Ontario workers.</p>
<p>The study also found that visible-minority families are three times more likely to live in poverty.</p>
<p>The report follows projections in March from Statistics Canada which suggested visible minorities could become the majority of the population in Toronto in about 30 years.</p>
<p>The agency says 63 per cent of the population would be from a visible minority by 2031, up from 43 per cent in the 2006 census.</p>
<p>Overall, Statistics Canada says visible minorities would account for one-third of the country&rsquo;s population by that time.<br>

		<p>Of course, the immigration enthusiasts always trot out the &#8216;economic&rsquo; argument to fool the masses when justifying mass, uncontrolled replacement immigration.<br>
 When their bluff is called (as in here), that old stand-by &#8220;It&rsquo;s all Whitey&rsquo;s fault&#8221; is the first thing to fall from their lips.<br>
So predictable.<br>
So tiresome.<br>
So destructive.</p>

		<p>Statistics Canada as been announcing for some time that the population of Canada could be one third non-white by 2030 due to immigration.</p>
<p>Immigration policy is always presented as a fait accompli, something that is practically as unchangeable as the constitution, not even worth discussing because it is not of interest or within the comprehension of the layman voter.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s always our fault.</p>
<p>This reporter must be writing for a raise or to keep his job.  All that&rsquo;s needed is to point out problems of the non whites and blame the Whites.</p>
<p>It is a pat formula that creates and builds entire journalism careers.</p>
<p>Best part, it also keeps feeding the minds of Whites that they are to blame and need to do more to atone for the sins of segregation.</p>
<p>We are flooded and surrounded by that message.  Rationality is shield. White children need to be taught how to ask the disassembling question of insight:</p>
<p>&#8220;If White people all just disappeared, would non white poverty also just disappear?&#8221;</p>

		<p>Oh yes, the old &#8220;equal pay&#8221; thing again.</p>
<p>Women tend to take jobs that are more cushy and entail less risk.  Riskier jobs pay more, and men are risk-takers.</p>
<p>As far as whites getting paid more than blacks&hellip;I&rsquo;d think that a rocket scientist would be paid more than a counter jockey.</p>

		<p>In other words, the Comrades at the Toronto Star are saying we should all be paid the same, all live in the same sort of concrete cubicles stacked on atop the other, all take public transportation, all work for slave wages, all become wards of the State.  You know, kinda like what the Soviet Union was?  How did that work out, by the way?  And were people happier because things were so fair and predictable?  </p>

		<p>This story must have been in the early edition. The story in the later edition called for employment equity (known as affirmative action in the US). We had a socialist government in Ontario enact AA in the early 1990s but a later conservative government got rid of it. I&rsquo;ve always suspected that the issue would eventually come back as the numbers and inequality grew larger.</p>
<p>Anyway, when are they going to divide the category of visible minorities into the full array of groups? There are large differences between Chinese and blacks. There are large differences among whites (WASP, north-western European, southern and eastern European, and Jewish). Give us all the data so that the public can have informed opinions. And please refer to whites as a people instead of the implied non-visible majority. </p>

		<p>Commissars are described as officials in a communist government whose duties include political indoctrination, detection of political deviation, etc. </p>
<p><i>The Toronto Star</i> commissars come very close to that description whenever they trot out these same idiotic stories, <i>ad nauseam</i>, as if discrimination and sexism were somehow responsible for poverty.</p>
<p>Millions of family-sponsored 3rd world immigrants have arrived here from poverty-stricken countries for over a generation now, and many knew nothing BUT poverty in their own homelands. Yet, these liberal mind-sets expect incompatible foreigners to fit seamlessly into our culture/lifestyle and rapidly progress to an economic scale on par with established Canadians whose generations date back to the 1800s.</p>
<p>Some of these ultra-liberal writers should should be questioning their own grandparents to discover what the hardships were like in the 1930s and 1940s during the depression and war years. </p>
<p>They may find that today&rsquo;s &#8220;poverty&#8221;, as described within a nanny-state welfare environment, does not even come close to how <i>real</i> deal was endured by working class generations of the past. </p>

<p>Shocking. I&rsquo;m sure we are all thinking this, but I&rsquo;ll ask it anyway: Where exactly are non-white/non-Asian people NOT economically disadvantaged and poorer than the rest of society? Liberalism has become so stupid these past few decades, that I think its only a matter of time before people just quite on the whole ideology. I mean, how long can people think like the writers of this article do?</p>

		<p>These visible minorities or more like illegal invaders should not have been in Canada in the first place. If Canada is so racist and unfair, should the U.N. not settle these refugees in some third world country where they would never experience discrimination? </p>

		<p>Visible minorities includes: classical welfare cases like Tamils, Somalians and Jamaicans. If not for Asians &amp; north Indians being several times more numerous than the others, the visible minority problem would be at 50%. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve said it before on other posts and the same holds true here.  Let&rsquo;s say you have X number of people in a place and those people have a proportionate number of jobs that gives reasonably full employment for those who want to work, based on the needs of the local area for cooks, police, teachers, factory workers, etc.</p>
<p>If you suddenly swamp the area with outsiders (especially unskilled, illiterates) in a 3-5 year period, there&rsquo;s just not the capacity for jobs built in to increase to give those people employment.  Jobs don&rsquo;t just materialize because someone wants a job.  I wonder why no one has ever told the social justice people to consider that.</p>
<p>Obama is always talking about jobs, as everyone else is, but jobs are created by people with some kind of drive or determination to make them for his own gain.  </p>
<p>Ex. I have X amount of dollars and I want to open a business of some sort to make even more money down the road.  Maybe I pool my money with others or get a loan, but the impetus is my drive to succeed.  I do my research and see if there is a market (foreign or domestic, local or national) for my product or service, and then I plan accordingly.  In short, I am a capitalist who wants to improve my economic condition and I take action.</p>
<p>You can have a town or city with X amount of entrepenuers creating jobs that are filled according to the local population.  In rare cases a huge factory may move to town requiring outsiders to come in to work, but again, that is rare.</p>
<p>If ten thousand unskilled illegal immigrant farmers show up in your town looking for work, and beyond a few restaurant jobs there&rsquo;s nothing, you cannot blame the locals for &#8216;not providing&rsquo; jobs because they are &#8216;racist.&rsquo;  </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just no extra work built into the infrastructure of the community life!  And of course, the illiterate laborers often do not have the vision and/or the knowledge to create businesses on their own, so in the end, liberals take the easy answer and blame whitey for his &#8216;racism.&rsquo;  But again, jobs don&rsquo;t just materialize because an immigrant walks into your town.</p>
<p>I am really sad to see that so many of my conservative bretheren in the media fail to take these logical positions and push them, for the liberals have no answer to logic.</p>
