			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News, June 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two federal agencies have joined the &#8220;boycott Arizona&#8221; trend and nixed conferences there out of concern over the state&rsquo;s immigration law, a Democratic Arizona congresswoman said, calling the development &#8220;very troubling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Any cancellations by the Department of Education and the U.S. Border Patrol may have been more out of a desire to steer clear of controversy than outright protest of the law. But Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who has written to dozens of cities and groups in a campaign to persuade them to end their boycotts, said it was disturbing to learn that the federal government would withdraw from the state over the issue.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Department of Education issued a statement to Fox News confirming that a program administrator, though not the Education Department itself, canceled a 2010 convention &#8220;at the request of one of our trilateral partners.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Giffords, the department&rsquo;s North American Mobility program convention set for October at a Tucson resort was nixed after the Mexican government said it would not send any representatives to the meeting. The department then moved the event to Minnesota.</p>
<p>Further, her office said the Border Patrol &#8220;verbally&#8221; canceled a conference set for May at a resort in Prescott after an official asked that it be moved out of concern over the immigration law debate. The Border Patrol  &mdash;  which has more than 4,000 agents in Arizona, representing nearly a quarter of its force  &mdash;  had booked 40 rooms for the event before canceling, though there was no contract signed for the event, according to Giffords&rsquo; office. </p>
<p>Giffords&rsquo; office said the cancellations were confirmed by the Arizona Hotel and Lodging Association. The congresswoman is among a number of Arizona officials who argue that the boycotts imposed by cities across the country do nothing to change the law and only punish workers and businesses there. The boycotts would hit the hospitality industry, which is made up in large part of Hispanic workers, particularly hard.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Arizona Republican Rep. Trent Franks said the apparent cancellations show the administration is using &#8220;federal agencies as political tools&#8221; to &#8220;harm our state&rsquo;s economy for having the audacity to protect our citizens.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>El Paso Mayor John Cook wrote in a letter to the congresswoman June 10 that his city was not &#8220;condoning&#8221; illegal immigration by passing a resolution that prohibits city officials from attending conferences in Arizona. He said his city&rsquo;s measure, though not a full-fledged boycott, emphasizes the importance of passing a comprehensive immigration overhaul and &#8220;expresses our concerns with the possibility of law enforcement racially profiling people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell also wrote this month that its ban on employee travel to the state  &mdash;  and a reconsideration of city contracts there  &mdash;  was imposed out of concern for racial profiling.<br>

		<p>It should now be plainly obvious that the Border Patrol upper ranks are filled with fifth columnists. Boycotting a state you are supposed to be protecting because they pass a law that mirrors the one you are supposed to be enforcing? Insanity.</p>

		<p>Idareya, upper management in any government agency are exempt employees, meaning they are not protected from firings without cause.  They can be fired summarily.  Obama and his cronies have proven themselves vindictive and more than willing to fire high ranking leaders who merely question Obama&rsquo;s policies.  We need to remove Obama and his cronies before we will see Federal agencies doing their jobs in an unbiased, constitutional way.  HE is the problem.  HE and his chicago thuggery appointed to high positions throughout the government, and into fictitious un-constitutional czar positions without congressional oversight, without congressional approval, and without responsibility to anybody but Messiah Obama.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Was Bush any better?  Do not forget that border patrol agents were put in jail for doing their jobs&hellip;..on VERY flimsy pretext.</p>
<p>The issue is moot, at this point.  Bush is gone and Obama is the today&rsquo;s problem.  But we must be open eyed as to whom we replace him with.  We can&rsquo;t afford to trade Obama for a McCain (or worse).  Or, if that situation comes about, we need to be willing to support states like Arizona, that defy what the feds are doing and instead choose to maintain the rule of law.</p>
<p>Our federal government is on the cusp of possible change.  The one party with two heads has failed and is collapsing, creating a power vacuum.  Who will fill it?  Will anyone fill it at all?  Or will power change from being federal to state/local.</p>
<p>More will be known in November.  And by 2012, the issue will be a lot more clearer (and out in the open).</p>
<p>One thing is sure, the republicans do not deserve the support of Americans.  They have to earn it.  But are they willing.  And if they are not, what should be the consequences.  Obama has lost all of the respect and most of the compliance of the people who live in the US.  Just because he is tossed out and replaced with a republican does not mean anything has changed.  Words are not important (just look at John &#8220;I never supported amnesty&#8221; McCain).  Actions are.</p>

		<p>    Any person, as an individual, is entitled to &#8220;vote with their feet&#8221; whenever and wherever; the Constitution guarantees it (&#8220;freedom to assemble&#8221;). That means, if you choose to stay away from the Grand Canyon, so be it, or if you choose to stay away from Los Angeles, well that&rsquo;s just fine also. However, it is an entirely different thing when a GOVERNMENTAL entity does this, be it city, state, or federal. The entire reason that Article IV of the Constitution exists at all, is to guarantee unfettered free trade among the states, and when the federal government, or a state government, or even a distant city or its officials officially declares a boycott of another state, then it would seem obvious that unconstitutional roadblocks to interstate commerce are being put up.  I say, for the President of the United Atates to stand idly by while the states descend into this trade war, this disunion  &mdash;  -and could civil war be far behind??  &mdash;  and while executives under his authority actively participate in this nonsense, is an impeachable offense. This President needs to learn that the &#8220;Interstate Commerce Clause&#8221; of the Constitution is for the furtherance of&hellip;INTERSTATE COMMERCE, not as a pretext to ram federal mandates down our throats such as mandatory purchase of health insurance. But isn&rsquo;t that just so typical of this federal government now, to do everything EXCEPT what the Constitution says it is supposed to do? Like, securing the borders and promoting interstate commerce?</p>
<p>I wonder why nobody else has picked up on this constitutional issue yet.</p>

		<p>We know that much of the Border Patrol is Hispanic.  Is that why they changed their meeting?  The president should (laugh) fire the head of the Border Patrol as well as the Sec. of Education.  These people are suspossed to support the states, whether they like a particular law or not.</p>
<p>Note to #3. Bush did not put anyone in jail.  That was the Court.</p>

		<p>the failures of the border patrol is obvious to anyone passing a construction site. the irony of them being against the arizona statute is classically orwellian. i think the original intent was for the feds to control the international borders,(which they refuse to do, with their two hour border patrol &#8220;stand-downs&#8221; every afternoon),and leave the interior enforcement to the states. washington exposes their treason more every day.</p>

		<p>Can the Federal government boycott a U.S. state? Then can Arizona boycott the Federal government by, say, withholding tax collections? It seems as logical. Indeed it&rsquo;s a good idea: the only way the multicultural juggernaut will ever be halted is when it&rsquo;s defunded. When the Feds withhold funding to noncompliant states, a gutsy governor like Jan Brewer should just forego the funding and comply with the wishes of her state&rsquo;s citizens. Freedom matters more than money. </p>
<p>I realize our rulers wouldn&rsquo;t let Arizonans get away with withholding taxes, just as they won&rsquo;t let them enforce this law against illegal aliens. But Americans should think and talk more about how to disempower Federal tyranny. My guess is, the PC multicultural empire will unravel when it goes completely broke.<br>

<p>As everyone else has said, since most Arizonans and Americans support this, it is NOT controversial. Secondly, all those who wish to boycott Arizona should be willing to take on all their illegals and pay all their (illegals) medical bills, schooling, jail costs, etc.</p>

		<p> &mdash; and could civil war be far behind</p>
<p><br>
I doubt it.  One side of a possible civil war is far more well armed than the other side.  And that is the side that would likely wish to separate.  Under such circumstances, &#8220;war&#8221; is unlikely.</p>
<p>More likely is a peaceable breakup of the US along &#8220;idealogical&#8221; lines.  I put that in quotes because the real lines will be race.</p>
<p>But it won&rsquo;t be about race&hellip;..that is until, the white nation that results is begged for money and resources by the Obamanation left behind.</p>

		<p>Actually the big O understands the constitution, the problem is his goal is to destroy it. The number one enemy to the US is the democrat party, who have fallen off the left end of the world. While I must admit we have no one party who perfectly represents the constitution, if brain washed voters continue to send leftist dems to Washington to represent us we are screwed, with no vaseline to ease the excruciating anal pain. Even as we speak O&rsquo;dummit has a near 50% apprproval rating, GOD only knows where the polsters find these people, yet it seems they show up at every election to verify their polling data. Even here on right wing Amren many comment how Bush was no different, than the avowed marxist currently roosting in the mad house. </p>

		<p>An excellent example of the vindictiveness displayed by the Oogabooga administration is the firing of General McChrystal for &#8220;insubordination&#8221;.  The border patrol folks are just trying to keep their jobs in a soft economy.</p>
