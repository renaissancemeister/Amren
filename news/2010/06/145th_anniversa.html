<h1>145th Anniversary of Juneteenth: Don&rsquo;t Forget the Horror of Slavery</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chad E. Quinn, Diversity Inc., June 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As we celebrate the 145th anniversary of Juneteenth, also referred to as Freedom Day or Emancipation Day, it&rsquo;s important to reflect upon this historical day in 1865 when Union Major General Gordon Granger and his 2,000 troops arrived in Galveston, Texas, to enforce President Abraham Lincoln&rsquo;s Emancipation Proclamation.</p>
<p>Although the Proclamation had abolished slavery in the United States more than two years before this event, there had been minimal impact on most slaves&rsquo; day-to-day lives, particularly in Texas, which was almost entirely under Confederate control. Many slaves, in fact, were completely unaware of the law. Granger&rsquo;s seizure of the state from Confederate troops brought about the freeing of 250,000 slaves in Texas.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Texas was the first state to make Juneteenth an official state holiday.</p>
<p>This year, Mississippi became the 36th state to recognize Juneteenth, which is a significant increase from the 29 states that recognized the day just two years ago. The Rev. Dr. Ronald V. Myers Sr., founder and chairman of the National Juneteenth Holiday Campaign and the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation (NJOF), stated on the NJOF website, &#8220;Mississippi joins Texas, Florida, Oklahoma, Delaware, Alaska, Idaho, Iowa, California, Wyoming, Illinois, Missouri, Connecticut, Louisiana, New Jersey, New York, Colorado, Arkansas, Oregon, Ohio, Kentucky, Michigan, New Mexico, Virginia, Washington State, Tennessee, Massachusetts, North Carolina, West Virginia, South Carolina, Vermont, Nebraska, Kansas, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Indiana and the District of Columbia in recognizing the end of enslavement in America.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Martin Luther King Jr. Day is still the only federal holiday that celebrates and recognizes Blacks&rsquo; significant contributions to this country&rsquo;s history. Thousands of petitions have been sent to the White House requesting President Barack Obama make Juneteenth a National Day of Observance and to establish a Presidential National Juneteenth Commission.<br/>

<p>All I recognize is indolence, incompetence, and violence;  Whites dispossessed and degraded, communities ruined, a nation destroyed.</p>
<p>Blacks made no contribution to us.  Everything they have was taken from us and given to them.</p>
<p>I bet Chad Quinn lives as far away from these &#8220;contributions&#8221; as possible.<br/>

		<p>Most Americans assume that those who keep bringing these things up (horrors of slavery, Washington owning slaves, etc.) have noble intentions. While some may have, generally it aint&rsquo;s so.</p>
<p>A typical &#8220;Liberal&#8221; propagndist/ideologue will claim that Johnson and his pals had do push all these draconian &#8220;civil rights&#8221; laws down our throats in the mid-1960ties in order to prevent civil unrests bordering with civil war, and to reconcile the nation so that it can function as one, again.</p>
<p>But this is just propaganda.</p>
<p>Since the trend begun shortly after Johnson signed several bills of this kind into the law, they are used for anything BUT to reconciliation and social harmony. Inflammatory rhetoric bordering with inciting to riots and vigorous attempts to unite non-whites against whites in typical school and college texts and curricula have been a commonplace since. Add to this a new imported element, Mexican irredentism fueled by mass &#8220;migration&#8221; from Mexico and by the preachers of social &#8220;justice&#8221; and racial harmony, and you get what we have now: our country is being hostilely taken over by the &#8220;oppressed&#8221; minorities and their patrons (mostly, by the patrons).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to see things for what they are: the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; activists are in the process of polarizing the country rather than uniting it. They (most of them) are NOT well-meaning even though they claim so. They lie to us and to themselves. They are outright dangerous to our nation and should be treated as such.<br/>

		<p>Why would lilly-white Western states like Alaska, Idaho, Iowa, Wyoming and Oregon, which have no significant black population, and no history of slave-holding, be observing Juneteenth?  </p>

		<p>160,000 black men fought for the Union. 60,000 were killed or wounded, about twice the white average. If these ferocious fighters came back from their own personel Valhallas, they would be impressed that only 20% of their great great grand sons were born with the benefit of clergy; that 33% of them will end up in jail; and these same kids do not even honor them because they can`t trace their roots back that far. It would be an awful shock to them that these boys will die 12 years before white boys born on the same day. Today most blacks are worse off then when they were slaves compared to white people. Before Juneteenth black men died six months before white men, now a full decade plus.<br/>

		<p>When will the holiday commemorating the horrors of the Industrial Revolution in the North be established.  Whites working at factories and in coal mines were held much tighter, and under far crueler conditions than Southern blacks in bondage.  The bondage of the white worker to the company, to live in the squalid dorms, to work 16 hour days, including children, to be tossed out like rotten firewood when severely injured - as they often were, and to grow &#8220;one day older and deeper in debt,&#8221; as the old song goes, is a good example of the selective historical remembering in our current epic.</p>
<p>Whites suffered greater, and provided even more sweat, blood, and tears to the building of America by far than black slaves, who were more often treated as pets than tortured beasts of burden.  Since gaining their freedom, blacks have gone downhill.  All an election of a black president signifies is the continued degradation of society and life in general since Reconstruction.  The CW was the end of America, not the beginning.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;horrors&#8221; of slavery here were nothing compared to the genocide that blacks have been inflicting on each other for millenia.  Also, before becoming slaves here, blacks already were slaves back home.  </p>

<p> If this alleged statistic is true, what would be its significance?  Just where did this great contribution occur?  What major civil war battle was decided by the ferocious fighting spirit of ex-slaves?  They sure lost it by the time of Korean War as demonstrated by the performance of their descendants at Pork Chop Hill.  </p>

		<p>Mr.Tiffany,great comment&hellip; God help me but I often ponder how frequently slaves got to heaven under slavery versus how many get there today under freedom. Blacks seem to prosper spiritually under slavery/segregation/oppression and are largely wild animals under freedom. Damdest thing to tell you the truth.</p>

		<p>The numbers of men serving and percentage KIA does not seem to be correct. 180,000 men of African descent served in Union Armies.  This includes mostly the Federal United States Colored Troops (USCT) and various State raised regiments (1st South, 1st AK African Descent, etc).  Of these, about 1/6 were casualties. This was indeed higher than the rate for all Federal troops, but it is not the 1/3 rate stated above in post #4.</p>
<p>I regret to note that the USCT trooper would have felt deeply insulted to be called an &#8216;African&rsquo;. He was fighting to  recognized as a 100% American. All records show the USCT were less drunk and more religious on average than other Federal troops; they were good infantry especially, and their officers came to rate them very highly.  </p>
<p>The USCT fought for the Union so that they themselves would be free. What they would make of their degenerate descendants I can&rsquo;t know and I&rsquo;d rather not consider for shame. The USCT helped save the Union; the mendacious race swindlers and professional blacks are helping to destroy it. <br/>
The sorrow and pity of it.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve read that on projects that were especially dangerous, the Irish were hired. If they were injured, no problem, they were expendable. Slaves, on the other hand, cost money. </p>
<p>By the way, I used to think that the Whites of the North and the South could finally unite in the face of the White genocide facing us. However, after reading Amren posts for some time now, I&rsquo;ve changed my mind. Yes, there will be some from the North who side with the South and vice versa, but overall we&rsquo;ll never come together. It looks like the divisions between the two regions, which were evident long before the War Between the States, are alive and well. God knows where we Whites are going to wind up.   </p>

		<p>To be frank, &#8220;slavery&#8221; was just an American version - and a brief one at that - of what Europeans had known and endured for many, many centuries as &#8220;peasantry&#8221; or &#8220;serfdom&#8221;. Basically the same thing. </p>
<p>Europeans have gotten over &#8220;the residual effects of serfdom&#8221; and do not obsess about it&hellip; why can&rsquo;t blacks?</p>
