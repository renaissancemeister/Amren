			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael E. Ruane, Washington Post, June 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Greeks&rsquo; offer was a gracious one: The giant pieces of sculpture for Washington&rsquo;s new Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial needed to be transported from China. Perhaps Greece, with its large shipping industry and admiration for the civil rights leader, could arrange for vessels to move the monument for free.</p>
<p>Officials planning the $120 million King memorial on the Tidal Basin were delighted. The cost savings would be substantial. {snip}</p>
<p>But now, with the 159 huge stone blocks that make up the sculpture waiting at a Chinese seaport and major work underway on the memorial site in Washington, Greek officials have told officials of the King project that they can&rsquo;t deliver.</p>
<p>&#8220;They apologized and said their country is in dire straits and they will not be able to fulfill their promise,&#8221; said Ed Jackson Jr., the project&rsquo;s executive architect. A spokesman at the Embassy of Greece in Washington confirmed that, saying no Greek shippers could be found to do the job. The &#8220;economic crisis bites everywhere,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He [Jackson] said the sculpture weighs 1,600 metric tons. Geoffrey C. Powell, vice president of operations for C.H. Powell Co., a Baltimore-based international freight forwarding firm, said shipping rates could range from $60 to $150 a ton  &mdash;  or about $96,000 to $240,000 for such a trip.</p>
<p>Jackson expressed concern about when the elements of the sculpture might arrive. They have been ready for shipment since April, and the departure date has slipped several times. The stones are supposed to be shipped to Baltimore, placed in temporary storage and then transported to Washington for assembly.</p>
<p>The centerpiece of the memorial is a three-story-tall relief of King, which will become one of the biggest figurative sculptures in Washington when it is erected.</p>
<p>Named the &#8220;Stone of Hope&#8221;  &mdash;  for a line from King&rsquo;s 1963 &#8220;I Have a Dream&#8221; speech  &mdash;  the 30-foot 8-inch tall sculpture bears the image of King in a business suit with his arms folded.</p>
<p>That and two other huge segments have been carved in China out of individual blocks by Lei Yixin, a master sculptor. One block weighs 55 tons, another 46 tons. The carving is 80 percent complete and is to be finished in Washington.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 11,000-mile journey from the port of Xiamen, China, takes about 30 days, he [Jackson] said. Substantial work has been done on the Washington site, amid the Tidal Basin&rsquo;s famed cherry trees. More than 300 support pilings have been sunk, and the foundation for the memorial&rsquo;s bookstore has been poured.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The memorial, authorized by Congress in 1996, has survived 14 years of fundraising challenges, artistic controversy and bureaucratic upset.</p>
<p>Complaints came when a Chinese sculptor was selected instead of an American. Then the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, a federal panel whose approval is required for monuments and memorials, criticized the sculpture as grim and totalitarian. Then the project was held up by a dispute over architectural security elements. Now this.</p>

		<p>That statue is a prime example of socialist realism. It deserves a home in a communist country. Perhaps North Korea could pay the freight..?</p>

		<p>I can only hope the sculpture never makes it to these shores. The last thing we need to worry about in these trying times is assembling a Chinese made 3 story statue the Marxist Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>

		<p>One would think the Greeks could find enough of the trillion dollar donation our benevolent, and glorious communist party leader recently bestowed upon them to pay for the shipping costs. Personally I hope this abomination never comes to fruition. By the way I wonder if we payed China for this with the money we borrowed from them? We need to take the government&rsquo;s credit card away, and make them get a debit card, but still they would borrow for that too, since they are totally out of control with the purse strings.</p>

		<p>Gee, now we even outsource the carving of giant politically correct statues to China.  I vote that Morris Dees pay the shipping, if we must have the thing at all.<br/>

<p>Greece is 98% Greek. The remaining 2% are primarily Turks. I bet Greece is just about the only country in the world with no black people. So my question is, why on earth would they be so fond of Martin Luther King Jr.? What the hell did he do for them?</p>
<p>&#8220;Complaints came when a Chinese sculptor was selected instead of an American.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just do what the British do and give him an American passport. Then he&rsquo;ll magically turn into an &#8220;American,&#8221; all of a sudden.</p>

<p>MAN!!! WHEN was the last time you were in Greece?? nothing but  blacks EVERYWHERE, all MUSLIMS and ALL PROTESTING the losing of the freebies as Greece collapses, and the same is happening in Spain (and WILL happen here in the U.S.)!! One should also go and see the Eifel Tower before it is turned into a giant minaret just as the Trade Towers area is gonna be a HUGE mosque!</p>

Why are they getting themselves worked up over this? The statue is ultimately going to end up in Washington. Nothing on earth is going to stop it from happening.</p>
<p><i>Jackson expressed concern about when the elements of the sculpture might arrive.</i></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a question of if, it&rsquo;s only a question of when (and how much more it&rsquo;s going to cost us).</p>

<p>Who else but blacks would even think it necessary to ask far-off countries like Greece to give them free help with a statue that celebrates ONLY blacks? Any other group that wants to put up a monument to themselves, would PAY for it themselves. </p>
<p>Greeks owe black Americans NOTHING. And neither, for that matter, does a Chinese sculptor   &mdash;   who, I&rsquo;m willing to wager, took the gig not because of any love for MLK or Af-Am&rsquo;s, but only because it&rsquo;s a high-profile job that will get him internationally recognized. </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my Plan B: The Chinese keep the granite; the Greeks use their shipping fleets for paying customers; and America&rsquo;s blacks use their time on more useful endeavors (like getting JOBS) than putting up statues of drunken philandering communists. </p>
