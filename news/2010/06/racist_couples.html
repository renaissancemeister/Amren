<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>AN Italian couple&rsquo;s adoption bid was denied after they said in their application that they did not want &#8220;dark-skinned&#8221; children, local media reported overnight.</p>
<p>An appeal court in Sicily ruled that the couple were unfit to adopt children of any description, the reports said.</p>
<p>A child protection agency took the couple to court after they submitted an application in Catania, in eastern Sicily, saying they were &#8220;prepared to take in up to two children .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. regardless of sex or religion, but .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not with dark skin&#8221;.</p>
<p>The court ordered a magistrate who reviews adoption requests to ignore such specifications, then took things a step further, ruling that any such &#8220;racist&#8221; couple should not be allowed to adopt at all.<br>

		<p>Just a few months ago on Amren, in an interracial adoption thread, I predicted this.  </p>
<p>Adoption agencies in all traditionally-white nations have hugely disproportionate numbers of non-white children waiting for placement.  Most whites would prefer to adopt whites, and non-whites do not adopt from agencies at the same rate.  It was only a matter of time before agencies start demanding desperate parents adopt non-whites, or place white and non-white kids together as &#8220;two-for-one deals&#8221; to get them off the books.  </p>
<p>Holding abandoned white children hostage, reaching into white families and forcing multiculturalism, is evil.  They seek to destroy our very families from the inside!  It&rsquo;s no less than pure evil.  </p>

		<p>While I disagree with the court ruling, we shouldn&rsquo;t be too worried about adoptions. Have white children of your own, have five or more of them for heavens sake. The world needs more whites. The only people this case will truly affect is white orphans and white couples who are infertile. </p>
<p>Still, it is a very sick perverted politically correct ruling that should never have taken place. Who do these people think they are ruling against a persons right to decide whom they want to adopt? I would have some choice words but I imagine they would not be allowed and therefore I will refrain from doing so.</p>

		<p>What is this? I thought Italy was turning to the right.</p>
<p>From a realistic perspective, this tells me that there is a backlog of dark-skinned kids that nobody wants, and that the State wants to get rid of.</p>
<p>All this ruling is going to do is cut back on ALL adoptions, period.</p>
<p>People will go elsewhere to get their prized White adoptees.</p>

		<p>The subtle message in all race stories that portray Whites as evil is this: &#8220;Making White Babies is a Hate Crime Against Human Dignity.&#8221;</p>
<p>The point of the message isn&rsquo;t less White babies, but more White parents who are insecure in their White Skin and will be intimidated into more voluntary racial dispossession and degradation in their own country.</p>
<p>Whites who are ashamed of being White will be the first to &#8220;passionately embrace the Diversity which makes us a stronger society.&#8221;  But before that, they will be the first to &#8220;hold ourselves accountable to people of color for our unearned White Privileges.&#8221;</p>
<p>Watch for the subtleties.</p>
<p>Glenn Beck is only about 80% of the way to total racial awakening, but he&rsquo;s 100% on perceiving the subtle workings of our enemies. He shows you the hidden story behind the story.  So would you if you made millions and could afford a crack research staff.  If he&rsquo;d quit worshipping MLK so often, he&rsquo;d automatically be at 90%.</p>
<p>James Edwards has always been at 100%.  He tells you straight up that in today&rsquo;s world, &#8220;White&#8221; means &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>His comments on the adoption scandal in Italy are superb:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/5v9yhd" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/5v9yhd</a></p>
<p>See? What have I been telling you for five years on the radio show, and over two years on this blog? All-white groups are &ldquo;racist&rdquo;, and that includes families, and so any desire by white people to adopt white kids is &ldquo;racist&rdquo;, too.</p>
<p>Remember the NYT reporter who called families the last segregated institution in America? </p>
<p>Remember when the talk show host said a gathering of Tim Tebow&rsquo;s family looked like a Nazi party rally?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not kidding, folks.</p>
<p>Now common sense and traditional morality when it comes to adoption is &ldquo;hate&rdquo; and &ldquo;racism&rdquo;, and if you don&rsquo;t want to adopt black, Mexican or Chinese kids, you shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to adopt at all. Not only does this punish you for your horrible &ldquo;racism&rdquo;, but it prevents you from passing on your evil beliefs to any innocent white kids you might&rsquo;ve adopted.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think this isn&rsquo;t coming to America. It is.<br>

		<p>What startles me is that a court in Sicily -of all places -ruled that this couple is &#8220;unfit&#8221; to adopt anyone. That&rsquo;s surprising, given that Sicilians are among the most race-conscious of all Italians - or so I thought.</p>

<p>I agree completely.  I just can&rsquo;t believe such a decision was made in Italy.  I just can&rsquo;t believe it.  We&rsquo;ve been hearing a lot lately about the Italians taking steps to get rid of their illegal aliens and now this nonsense.  Apparently there are forces at work in every White country constantly attempting to destroy us.  This is unbelievable that a couple cannot express a preference for adopting a baby or a child of their own race, just unbelievable.</p>

		<p>Alas, each day, the world becomes increasingly insane. </p>
<p>As a White couple, my wife and I are very thankful that we chose to never have children. Yes, we missed the experience, but our unborn children thank us for not subjecting them to this insane world!</p>
<p>I know that is often a strong point of contention among my fellow Whites, but I stand firmly and proudly behind our decision. </p>
<p>Yes, we realize that some Whites see us as disloyal to our race for not reproducing, but I must strongly disagree. </p>
<p>Our race is doomed! One would have to be a fool not to see that! Somewhere between 30 percent and 50 percent of all Whites are egalitarians who are hellbent on the destruction of our race. They are the ones who voted for Obama. That is a FACT! Plus, the government fully supports the eradication of Whites. That, too, is a FACT! It&rsquo;s only a matter of time until misgeneation, thrid-world immigration, and government policies eradicate the White population.</p>
<p>The Muslims, Hispanics, and Africans are simply outbreeding and replacing us. It&rsquo;s not even a close race! Why would any sane White person sentence their children, born or unborn, to face what is coming?</p>
<p>I truly pity you if you are White and have children.<br>

The Sicillians may have been a close knit group but the socialist agenda which includes social transformation, not just political and economic transformation, indoctrinates everyone into the politically correct form of thinking. Socialist want to change EVERYTHING not just the economy.  Sweden was the first society to be transformed, there was much attention paid to this in the sixties, but now, Britain, France, Italy and the others are becoming Swedenized.  It is really scary to see.  We have to watch out for the propaganda offensives in all their forms.</p>

		<p>Just as in the U.S., a handful of judges made a decision with which the majority of Italians probably disagrees.  Legislators in both countries are responsible for making laws to codify what the majority actually wants<br>
. <br>
In reading this article, I wondered whether the prospective parents were concerned that they might receive a ethnically Sicilian child rather than one of African descent. (In the U.S., people might request a blonde child if both parents are blonde, for ex.) Terms and concepts in Europe are, at times, quite different than those in America.  Yesterday, I saw a piece that claimed that 54% of babies born in Paris are now &#8220;black&#8221;.  On researching further, I found that what the French were referring to is susceptibility to sickle-cell anemia.  The latter situation could refer to anyone with Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, or Indian subcontinental heritage, as well as African.  In France, many of those might be non-black people linked to North Africa.  But, in the U.S., most people think of blacks when referring to this disease.</p>

<p>Yes, there are forces at work in EVERY White nation. Multiculturalism, diversity training, quotas, immigration of NON-whites only, White bashing, PC revision of our history, integration, putting blacks and assorted nonwhites into every facet of White life,( in our churches, in movies, TV, neighborhoods, workforce, schools) has all happened about the same time in every White nation. Coincidence? Hardly. Exactly who are these forces and should we not find out?</p>

		<p>Why is the family barred from adopting altogether simply because they expressed a preference?  Did they want light-skinned children so that the adoptees would resemble themselves and perhaps blend into the family more easily? It is unfair to cry &#8220;racist&#8221; at them just because they expressed a preference for children who look a particular way.  </p>
<p>Adoption in and of itself is a controversial issue   &mdash;   but, so long as it goes on, why can&rsquo;t this couple just be put on a waiting list until a child they will accept is available?  </p>

		<p>To the commenter who says:<br>
&#8220;What is this? I thought Italy was turning to the right.&#8221;<br>
and the others who are likewise confused.</p>
<p>The Sicilian court that made this decision is not affiliated with the right-wing government.</p>
<p>In every country, except for totalitarian countries like China, there are different, interacting forces.</p>
<p>Think about the US - there is president Obama and then there&rsquo;s the Arizona government. There are gays and there are Mormons. There is American Renaissance and there&rsquo;s the Southern Poverty Law Center.</p>
<p>Italy is a battlefield for such forces as well, however all in all, the country is indeed turning right.<br>
Overwhelmingly the Italians cherish their own identity and aren&rsquo;t afraid to tell it like it is on the danger represented by foreign cultures and races.<br>
There is zero possibility that Italy is overwhelmed by non-Europeans, at least until the rest of Europe falls, and then Italy is forced to capitulate due to international pressure.<br>
Or alternatively, until declining birthrates cause the population level to fall so low that the country becomes no man&rsquo;s land.</p>

<p>I will never give in so easily, we owe it to our children to fight and give all that we have to make sure the white race continues on after we perish. I would advise people not to be so pessimistic about our future and rather look to solutions, such as in having more children and looking towards automation instead of third world immigration. Take a page from the Japanese who also have our same problem. There are solutions out there, we need to find them and put pressure on our governments to follow through on what WE want.</p>
<p>White people world wide are waking up. Remember this is a court ruling and most of us know how court judges have been brought. Therefore we should not see this as an Italian reaction but the political elites attempts to shut us down.</p>
<p>What is more interesting to me currently is the Mari Marmara attack and the consequences flowing from it. It is similar to the Sharpville incident and the media seem to be playing the exact same tune that they did all those years ago.</p>

		<p>I suppose that we are not far from a time when we are forced to take children, and non-white children, into our homes by government writ.  Right now, fosterparenting is an option.  In a world where population explosions are continuing unabated in third world countries, the present trends seem to point to this eventual &#8220;humanitarian&#8221; solution.  It may seem like a science fiction, but many things going on today were only science fiction a few decades ago.</p>
<p>As for combating the population explosion of non-whites with more white births, this won&rsquo;t fix the problem.  The fix is actually to force poor, dependent nations to abort and sterilize.  What we need is quality, not quantity.</p>

		<p>Honestly, this doesn&rsquo;t sound to me like the couple wanted only children of European descent.  Any religion, with light skin.  Sounds to me like they would have accepted light-skinned Asian or Middle Eastern kids.  Maybe they wanted to ensure they wouldn&rsquo;t get strapped with any African AIDS babies.</p>

		<p>I am of Italian heritage. Years ago,I was always told by elderly relatives that Sicilians were not really considered Italian, similiar to the way Hawaiians or Puerto Ricans are not really like the rest of the USA.They were looked down upon,and very much disliked. This is what Italian relatives told me many years ago. In fact, I was told if you want to insult an Italian, call him a Sicilian.So, I wonder how much this ruling will really impact the Italian people living elsewhere in Italy.My guess is that it will not affect them. But that is just a guess. Perhaps there is someone out there who lives in Italy who could comment.</p>

		<p>What an evil racist couple! Surely it is not enough that they be barred from adopting, I think we should arrest them so they aren&rsquo;t allowed to spread their hate filled racist opinions to others and contaminate society with hatred! How dare they not want to adopt dark children! Obviously the state needs to force people to adopt and marry dark individuals otherwise racism will not end! </p>
<p>We should just euthanize the evil white children and forget about them, after all so many whites seem to carry evil racism in their genes. Better yet we could sterilize all the adult whites and force them to adopt black children! We must destroy the evil racist hateful and hate filled white race. Then the earth will be a paradise when the whites are gone.</p>

		<p>The reason for this is obvious. White couples need to adopt nonwhite children so they come to &#8220;love&#8221; them as their own and in many cases love them MORE than their own White children!</p>
<p> I have seen this happen time and again.</p>
<p> The White couple showers all kinds of praise and attention on the adopted nonwhite child. They make sure that nonwhite child gets to know his/her own culture and has friends of their own race. Thus they bring in more nonwhite friends than White ones into the home for birthdays, Christmas, July 4th, etc etc&hellip;MIXING is the result and now how can those White parents tell their own White child not to marry or date outside their own race??? </p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t because by now those White parents are totally on the multiracial bandwagon and will defend that nonwhite child over their own White child, even if it means the death of the White race and their own children. That is a FACT! </p>
<p>Just look at those stupid Whites who rushed to adopt those Haitian kids and the WHITE churches who went in and brought them here to be adopted. Talk about race traitors! </p>
<p>BTW, did anyone see any Halle Berry&rsquo;s, Will Smith, Oprah, Cosby, Tyra Banks, Serena Williams, Spike Lee or the hundreds of rich blacks adopt ANY? </p>

<p>Such a draconian, totalitarian step may lie further in the future, who can tell?  I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t write it off, fantastic as it sounds. But far more likely in the near future would be a softer approach in which subtle economic  &#8220;incentives&#8221; and &#8220;inducements&#8221; such as tax rebates, rent reductions, salary bonuses, would accomplish the same trick with more voluntary compliance.  </p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised at all to be seeing this in the relatively near future. In fact, if such persons as Holder and Obama had their way, we&rsquo;d probably be seeing it right now. Get ready!</p>

		<p><i>Alas, each day, the world becomes increasingly insane.</i></p>
<p>As a White couple, my wife and I are very thankful that we chose to never have children. Yes, we missed the experience, but our unborn children thank us for not subjecting them to this insane world!</p>
<p>I know that is often a strong point of contention among my fellow Whites, but I stand firmly and proudly behind our decision.</p>
<p>Yes, we realize that some Whites see us as disloyal to our race for not reproducing, but I must strongly disagree.</p>
<p>Our race is doomed! One would have to be a fool not to see that! Somewhere between 30 percent and 50 percent of all Whites are egalitarians who are hellbent on the destruction of our race. They are the ones who voted for Obama. That is a FACT! Plus, the government fully supports the eradication of Whites. That, too, is a FACT! It&rsquo;s only a matter of time until misgeneation, thrid-world immigration, and government policies eradicate the White population.</p>
<p>The Muslims, Hispanics, and Africans are simply outbreeding and replacing us. It&rsquo;s not even a close race! Why would any sane White person sentence their children, born or unborn, to face what is coming?</p>
<p>I truly pity you if you are White and have children.</p>
<p>Way to give up just when we are making a comeback.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, Whites had a fertility rate only 25-30% of the world average (1.5 versus well over 4). It looked like our goose was cooked.</p>
<p>Now, Whites have a fertility rate 60% of the world average (still 1.6, but compared to the world average of 2.6). It is now East Asians who have the world&rsquo;s worst demographics, not Whites.</p>
<p>Here in North America, Hispanic birthrates are crashing. Puerto Ricans and Cubans are reproducing at a rate below White Americans, and Mexico is equal to the USA overall. The Mexican flood into the USA occurred because of 1970s differential birthrates; the babies born then grew up to crash the gates. (Something similar was at work in Europe, with Poles into Britain; even though Poland has bad demographics now, it didn&rsquo;t in 1980.)</p>
<p>Even Muslim countries like Turkey, Morocco, Tunisia, Iran, and Lebanon have come down to replacement level. The only part of the world where birth rates haven&rsquo;t come down much (yet) is Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>But yes, if you want to give up, go ahead. The descendants of those of us who didn&rsquo;t will thank us later.</p>

		<p> Now, I know why politics are taken so much more seriously in Italy than the United States. I think the level of hostility felt by Italian patriots toward the left is much stronger than other European countries. Rulings like the one made by the Sicilian appeals court make more sympathetic to Italy&rsquo;s so called &#8220;extreme right&#8221;  Of course, most nationalists, including those in the Tea Party, are called &ldquo;extremists&rdquo; by the controlled media.</p>

		<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a guy who&rsquo;s written<a href="https://northwestfront.org/northwest-novels/" rel="nofollow"> four books</a> about a future in which White people rebel against the system. He imagined a Federal Child Protective Service that quickly became commonly known as &#8220;It Takes A Village,&#8221; where White children were kidnapped by the state and adopted out to whoever could pay the &#8220;adoption bond&#8221; (in other words, sold to the highest bidder). Young White girls were, of course, the most expensive. </p>
<p>This guy is getting so many things right, it&rsquo;s scary.</p>

<p>No doubt you&rsquo;re of northern Italian heritage.  Now that you&rsquo;ve done the obligatory denunciation of Sicilians, I hope you feel better.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, I wonder how much this ruling will really impact the Italian people living elsewhere in Italy.My guess is that it will not affect them.&#8221;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re dreaming!  Italy, like most of the rest of Europe, has been addled with leftists longer than the United States.  No doubt that appeal court&rsquo;s ruling was published in Italian law journals and will serve as fodder for every bio-egalitarian magistrate looking to make a name for him/herself.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I am of Italian heritage. Years ago,I was always told by elderly relatives that Sicilians were not really considered Italian, similiar to the way Hawaiians or Puerto Ricans are not really like the rest of the USA.They were looked down upon,and very much disliked. This is what Italian relatives told me many years ago. In fact, I was told if you want to insult an Italian, call him a Sicilian.So, I wonder how much this ruling will really impact the Italian people living elsewhere in Italy.My guess is that it will not affect them. But that is just a guess. Perhaps there is someone out there who lives in Italy who could comment.&#8221;</p>
<p>I am 1/4 Sicilian and with my Sicilian relatives there was a &#8220;muslim&#8221; element toward women - she must be virtuous or the family&rsquo;s name will suffer.  You see that in the movie The Godfather II.  The Moors invaded Sicily and Sicilians are a mix of Moors, Normans, Romans, Greeks, Semites, and Asians.  They are the most mixed genetically of the Europeans but they share about 85% of their genes with other Europeans.  Blacks love to claim Sicilians are related to them and that is nonsense.  The amount of Sub Saharan genes in Italy is negligible.  I did know many 3rd generation Italians who were mixed with other ethnicities and the division between northern and southern Italians was more of a joke.  </p>

<p>  Actually, this goes back to ancient times when the Greeks were the predominant influence in Sicily. In ancient Greece respectable women were veiled and keep out of the public eye. Slaves were allowed to go around in less clothing. The Greek influence is still very strong in Sicily. Look at some of the better looking Sicilian women you can still see the Greek phenotype. Don&rsquo;t believe the African or Muslim nonsense. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m 100% Sicilian (and a second-generation Sicilian-American).  People should not get their science, geography and history from mainstream media sources (tv and movies) for reasons that by now should be all too obvious.</p>
<p>One of the more popular urban legends making the rounds in America (thanks to popular media) is that Sicilian culture is heavily indebted to the Arabs.  While the Arabs unquestionably made a cultural stamp on the place, their influence is overstated.  The Arab conquest of Sicily was a slow and arduous one, and their total time on the island was only about 200 years.  The Sicilians strongly resisted attempts at Islamizing them.  </p>
<p>By the way, many of the &#8220;advancements&#8221; instituted by Arabs on Sicily (and elsewhere) were actually done by subject peoples (like Byzantine Greeks).  Arabs themselves invented very little.</p>
<p>As far as Sicilian attitudes towards women?  That was firmly in place long before the first Arabs washed up on shore.  Remember that for many centuries Sicily (and Southern Italy) were considered part of &#8220;Magna Graecia&#8221; (Gr: Greater Greece).  Greek influence was (and is) strong in many parts of the island.  Did you know, for example, it was the Byzantine Greeks, not the Arabs, who required Sicilian women to wear the veil in public?  Please don&rsquo;t take my word for it; read it for yourself, here.</p>

<p>A Greek dialect, Griko, is still spoken in parts of Puglia and Calabria.</p>
<p>Women under the Romans &#8220;enjoyed&#8221; the same treatment they got under the Greeks.  The ancient Minoans, a pre-Hellenic people who lived in and around Crete, actually were much more egalitarian in their treatment of women than the later Greeks and Romans.  This survived longer in Sicily for the simple fact the place frequently traded hands among the greater powers who used the island as a buffer, and therefore invested little in developing the place.  It&rsquo;s relative geographic isolation didn&rsquo;t help, either.</p>

		<p>To #30: I am of southern Italian heritage. As for the comments I heard growing up regarding Sicilians, that is what the attitude was among the older Italians. They were all of southern Italian heritage,too. <br>
If I understand them correctly, it seems Sicilians were probably culturally different than the rest of the country. </p>
