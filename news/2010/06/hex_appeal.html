<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>By some estimates, about 40 percent of the cases in the Central African court system are witchcraft prosecutions. (Drug offenses in the U.S., by contrast, account for just 12 percent of arrests.) In Mbaiki  &mdash;  where Pygmies, who are known for bewitching each other, make up about a tenth of the population  &mdash;  witchcraft prosecutions exceed 50 percent of the case load, meaning that most alleged criminals there are suspected of doing things that Westerners generally regard as impossible.</p>
<p>I went to the front of the witch line and asked Abdulaye Bobro, the chief judge, what the punishment was for casting spells. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} [He] found the section on PCS, or the &#8220;practice of charlatanism and sorcery,&#8221; and let me read along as he quoted from memory the section that dictates a decade or more in jail and a nominal fine for engaging in witchcraft. In practice the penalties were significantly less, because the town had insufficient funds to maintain a jail. {snip}</p>
<p>The classic study of witchcraft in Africa occurred among the Azande, who inhabit the eastern edge of the Central African Republic. The anthropologist Edward E. Evans-Pritchard found that the Azande attributed a staggering range of misfortunes  &mdash;  infected toes, collapsed granary roofs, even bad weather  &mdash;  to meddling by witches. Nothing happened by chance, only as an effect of spell-casting by a wicked interloper. That sentiment remains widespread among Central Africans, who demand that the law reflect the influence of witchcraft as they understand it. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} [Most] lawyers I consulted there favored keeping the law intact, although they admitted that it fits uneasily in a modern legal system. &#8220;The problem is that in a witchcraft case, there is usually no evidence,&#8221; said Bartolom√© Goroth, a lawyer in Bangui, who recently defended (unsuccessfully) a coven of Pygmies who had been accused of murder-by-witchcraft in Mbaiki. Goroth said the trials generally ended with an admission of guilt by an accused witch in exchange for a modest sentence. I asked how one determined guilt in cases where the alleged witches denied the charges. &#8220;The judge will look at them and see if they act like witches,&#8221; Goroth said, specifying that &#8220;acting like a witch&#8221; entailed behaving &#8220;strangely&#8221; or &#8220;nervously&#8221; in court. His principal advice to clients, he said, was to act normally and refrain from casting any spells in the courtroom.</p>
<p>Goroth argued that the legal system could not ignore a social fact as firmly embedded as witchcraft is in the republic. And every other lawyer I met not only supported its criminalization, but seemed to believe in the reality of shape-shifting and killing with magic spells. More than one pointed to the elbow when referring to witchcraft, indicating the site in the body where sorcery is said to reside.</p>
<p>I visited Mbaiki&rsquo;s sole foreign nongovernmental organization, an Italian group called COOPI that exists to promote human rights and the rule of law. {snip}</p>
<p>They acknowledged that the rights of the accused are violated regularly in witchcraft prosecutions, because the charge carries enormous pressure to confess. But they, too, supported keeping the laws on the books, for pragmatic reasons: if people thought witches could hex with impunity, mobs would simply seize the alleged offenders, bring them to a pit, and bury them alive. {snip}<br>

I am amused by the lack of sophistication by the Atlantic.</p>
<p>While cannibalism, ritual murder, torture and assassination may be ignored or even encouraged by the powers that be in the Central African Republic (it formerly had the grandiose name of Central African Empire), witchcraft can get a bit out of hand in a land of superstitious blacks.</p>
<p>Think of the prosecutions of witchcraft as you would think of the prosecutions of parking tickets in America and you will realize why there are so many, plenty of fines, plenty of revenue, no big deal!</p>

		<p>Is this really unreasonable or ignorant?</p>
<p>Yes, satanism and witchcraft are clear examples of just how bad Africans are.  But the prosecution of these things is not.  These people regularly commit gang rape (to power magic potions used by soldiers), kill people for body parts (muti), steal children and albinos for their body parts.  And who knows what other real sinister deeds.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, they should handle witchcraft with a quick hanging for the offenders&hellip;.because of what those involved do.  Mobs seizing the offenders and burying them alive is not at all unreasonable, considering what those people are doing.</p>
<p>Also, consider this.  To people with limited intelligence and almost non-existent education, the willingness for these people to do such terrible deeds is a strong reason to suspect that they get something out of it&hellip;..to believe it works, for those who don&rsquo;t know any better.  It becomes a vicious cycle.  People do these horrible things because they believe it works&hellip;.then others believe it works because they can&rsquo;t imagine any other reason someone would be willing to do these things (especially considering the risk).  Suddenly, the act of witchcraft itself, not just the bad stuff done to people because of it, seems a reasonable reason to punish those involved.</p>
<p>Of course, the real issue for whites is this is a strong reason to not allow them into our lands.  They will bring this with them.  Don&rsquo;t lose sight of the real issue here and get distracted by scoffing at them and feeling superior.</p>

		<p>There was a time when Whites had a common understanding that African blacks were full on fetish worshipers and voodoo kings.</p>
<p>Read what Hinton Rowan Helper compiled in 1867 as a reaction to the Radical Republican Reconstruction Act that put blacks over Whites in the South. (P.C. translation- &#8220;Africans in Africaland&#8221;)</p>
<p>   Helper was a Lincoln supporter. He became horrified and disgusted at what his beloved Republican party was doing to Whites by agency of the blacks.   So he did us all a favor by compiling the truth about the blacks from explorer accounts of the black&rsquo;s natural ways in their natural African environment.  Witchcraft is in their genes.  MLK was a witch doctor of sorts who put White Christians under a voodoo spell by assuming the form of a Christian preacher and speaking our language.  How else would you explain the insanity of a White president signing into law the doom of his own White people and nation?</p>
<p>This is precious and rarely printed knowledge for our White children.  Download it before the splc, adl, aclu, and naacp and obama erase and ban it from the Internet-</p>

		<p>Life must be rough, being a pygmy. They&rsquo;ve also been victims of cannibalism by non-pygmy Africans as well as being persecuted for alleged witchcraft. Perhaps large groups of them will end up as refugees in Minnesota or Kansas.    </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m always amazed by the goings-on in the Dark Continent. The facc that a modern-day government actually actively prosecutes people for witchcraft might not be such a bad thing, however. After all, if they can do something as silly and outrageous as that, then  how can people in the Western world continue to outright reject ideas (those presented on AmRen, for instance) that were, as recently as the 1940&rsquo;s, entirely mainstream?</p>

		<p>Procedure used in the Salem Witch Trials.</p>
<p>1. The afflicted person makes a complaint to the Magistrate about a suspected witch.  The complaint is sometimes made through a third person.</p>
<p>2.  The Magistrate issues a warrant for the arrest of the accused person.</p>
<p>3.  The accused person is taken into custody and examained by two or more Magistrates.  If, after listening to testimony, the Magistrate believes that the accused person is probably guilty, the accused is sent to jail for possible reexamination and to await trial.</p>
<p>4.  The case is presented to the Grand Jury.  Depositions relating to the guilt or innocence of the accused are entered into evidence.</p>
<p>5.  If the accused is indicted by the Grand Jury, he or she is tried before the Court of Oyer and Terminer.  A jury, instructed by the Court, decides the defendant&rsquo;s guilt.</p>
<p>6.  The convicted defendant receives his or her sentence from the Court.  In each case at Salem, the convicted defendant was sentenced to be hanged on a specified date.</p>
<p>7.  The Sheriff and his deputies carry out the sentence of death on the specified date.</p>

		<p>Orthodox atheist that I am, it is clear to me that Africans need conversion to Christianity. Then, they may have hope escaping their demon haunted world. The true faith of secular humanism is forever indebted to Christianity for introducing the notion of natural order, banishing the god infested world of their pagan competitors. contribution towards creating and defending intellectual</p>
<p>Just as Christians knew that heresy was a threat to society, Africans seem to believe the same for the practice of witchcraft. So, as to the statement, &#8220;if people thought witches could hex with impunity, mobs would simply seize the alleged offenders, bring them to a pit, and bury them alive&#8221;, this  is irony indeed:   the Inquisition was originally created, at the request of the secular arm, to protect individuals from being lynched by mobs on mere suspicion of heresy. <br>

<p>Do you realize many many accused witches are young children that are beaten, killed or at the very least cast out? If lighting strikes a village they often target some weak individual (elderly lady or whomever) and attempt to kill them. There are whole villages in Africa comprised solely of accused witches that had to flee their homes or face death.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe you would condone and even ENCOURAGE witch hunts and the prosecution of witches. If true practitioners are caught with body parts, or caught kidnapping other individuals punish THOSE crimes not the imagined crime of witchcraft.</p>

		<p> There is nothing unusual in this article. Some educated Africans that I&rsquo;ve known over the years will admit in strictest confidence that they believe in witches and witchcraft. A sizable number of African Americans in the South believe in and perform &#8220;Hoodoo&#8221; and &#8220;Voodoo&#8221; rituals. It is called &#8220;Root&#8221; in the Carolinas and is still very much alive and well in both urban and remote rural areas. I have to be fair and admit that some Southern whites also admit a reluctant belief in black magic and steer clear of written curses, &#8220;Goopher&#8221; dust, graveyard chalking, etc. Most of these old Southern superstitions have roots in Africa &mdash; no use in denying it. </p>

<p>Virtually everyone in Africa has already been converted to Christianity(or Islam).  It does little to change their behavior.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised that anyone who reads Amren would be naive enough to think that religion could make Africans civilized.  </p>
