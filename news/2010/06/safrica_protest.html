<h1><a href="https://apnews.myway.com/article/20100617/D9GD595G0.html">SAfrica Protesters March for US AIDS Funding</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Eric Naki, Myway News, June 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Thousands of South African protesters marched on the U.S. consulate Thursday to demand the U.S. increase its AIDS funding for Africa, weeks after U.S. officials said their biggest AIDS fund would not substantially rise.</p>
<p>The protesters, clad in green T-shirts emblazoned with the words &#8220;HIV-Positive,&#8221; marched before the consulate in a wealthy northern suburb of Johannesburg to demand that the U.S. government increase its contribution to the Global Fund on AIDS, TB and Malaria to $2.8 billion by 2013.</p>
<p>Protest organizers said the lack of a significant increase in the President&rsquo;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief  &mdash;  a major funder of AIDS programs around the world  &mdash;  has led clinics to run out of drugs and forced providers to ration treatment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>South Africa, a nation of about 50 million, has an estimated 5.7 million people infected with HIV, more than any other country. It is the largest recipient of PEPFAR funds.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Protesters also called on the European Union, China, Japan and Canada to increase their AIDS funding and for African nations to meet a previous commitment to increase health spending to 15 percent annually.</p>
<p>Mark Heywood, deputy chairman of the South African National Aids Council, lambasted world leaders for cutting back on AIDS funding in the wake of the global economic crisis.</p>
<p>&#8220;The United States must support AIDS treatment and increase AIDS funding to developing countries,&#8221; he said.</p>

		<p>When Thomas Jefferson warned the U.S. not to get into &#8220;entangling alliances&#8221; I wonder if he ever envisioned a situation where the tax money of the average hard working American would be going to the Third World?</p>
<p>And for the religiously inclined folks, in Genesis 3:19 did God not say that &#8220;In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread&#8221;? Does this not imply that those who do not work will not have food to eat?</p>

		<p>I notice not one word about what happened to all the AIDS medications sent to Africa.</p>
<p>Those medicines all disappeared not because they were used and then ran out of them but because the Africans discovered they could smoke them as a hallucinogen.  Quickly, all AIDS medications vanished, leaving none for people with AIDS and went on the black market for use as recreational drugs.</p>
<p>A suspicious person might remark that these protesters here simply want more sent so they can sell them and get high.</p>

		<p>Wait a minute!  I thought that after blacks got to rule the country that it was transformed into a land of freedom, prosperity and social justice for the brotherhood of man!</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t S.A. the wealthiest nation in Africa, with diamonds, and other resources?  Let them buy or manufacture their own dang drugs and leave us alone.  Better yet, teach their people to stop raping girls and cheating on their wives.  Oh snap!  That&rsquo;s a longstanding African cultural phenomenon from way back, even promoted by the polygamist and cheater Jacob Zume, their president!</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t get it. Africans get AIDS and then they demand that the US, the European Union, China, Japan and Canada hand over the cash to pay for treatment. <br>
How much did the government pay to stage that idiotic soccer tournament?</p>

<p>They have to engage in rapes, orgies and unprotected sex with complete strangers. They have no choice in the matter. </p>

		<p>As an escaped ex-South African of British birth (dual nationality), when the Marxist terrorists took over South Africa it was the wealthiest country in Africa but much of the wealth has been squandered.  Why can&rsquo;t the new govt. organise the proviion of the needed drugs themselves after all this is the country that performed the first successful heart transplant.  (Sorry, that was a white man).</p>
<p>But the new govt cannot even organise the provision of electrical power and the citizens there who have suffered massive power cuts in recent years (called line outages) were all asked during the current soccer tournaments to only sue one light and a TV while the games were on to stop any worries about the power having to be cut to the stadiums.  Not many people know that as it has not been reported outside of that country.</p>

		<p> I have learned the hard way that when you start doing favors for  people that eventually it becomes an obligation.<br>
 They feel that they now have the right to demand your money, work and time because you owe all of it to them. Eventually; you have to say no.</p>

		<p>How about some tough love around the world? I&rsquo;m sick of the US trying to fund everyone who demands money and/or citizenship from us. Have these people tried to help themselves at all? They do not stop the practices that bring on this terrible disease, nor do they cooperate in any measures to halt the spread. We have people sneaking into our country even as we pour money into the black holes they come from. These examples are only a few of the demands placed on us. We need to recognize that because of the enormous debts we&rsquo;ve incurred and the millions we&rsquo;ve allowed to invade our nation, we are no longer # 1. We need to take care of ourselves before we spread the wealth around. Stop the invasion, enforce our laws so that those who don&rsquo;t belong here will go home, and stop throwing money into lost causes. We&rsquo;ll be on top again, but not without some tough love!</p>

<p>Actually, it was George Washington, in his farewell address, who warned the new nation against becoming involved in &#8220;foreign entanglements&#8221;.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it was his vice president, John Adams who also reiterated the need for America not to become involved in foreign wars.<br>

		<p>Why don&rsquo;t these Africans march for responsible sexual behavior on their own part?  Don&rsquo;t they know the US is in the throes of a massive recession, and that money, even if forthcoming, does not actually cure HIV (being an RNA virus, HIV is fundamentally incurable)?</p>

		<p>The  thing  about  AIDS  in  Africa  has  turned  out  to  be  one  of the  biggest  hoaxes  in  history.  Africa&rsquo;s  population  is  now  1 billion  plus  with  its  population  the  fastest  growing  in  the   world.  </p>
<p>If  the  bogus  AIDS  huxters  were  correct,  Africa&rsquo;s  population  would  now have  been  20%  of  what  it was  25  years  ago  when  AIDS  hysteria  hit  the  airwaves.  Of course  every  big  Pharma  company  worth  its  salt saw  this  is  a  heaven-sent  way  to  make  big  money. Well,  their  25  years  of  fame  is  now  running  on  fumes  &mdash;  all  still  pushing  bogus  hypotheses  about  AIDS.</p>
<p>What  the  partially  literate and  gullible  public  must  recognize is  that  men  in white  coats  and  clipped  accents  are often very  wrong.</p>
