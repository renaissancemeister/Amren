<h1><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE65211D20100603">Republicans Risk Latino Ire With Hard Line on Migrants</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tim Gaynor, Reuters, June 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When he ran for U.S. president two years ago, Republican John McCain told town hall meetings across the United States that illegal immigrants were &#8220;all God&rsquo;s children.&#8221;</p>
<p>But at a church hall in Tucson last weekend, he spoke up for a tough new Arizona law that seeks to drive those undocumented busboys and landscapers from the desert state where he is battling to hold on to his U.S. Senate seat.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Arizona&rsquo;s migrant crackdown has hurled immigration back to the fore in the run-up to the November congressional elections. And embracing it has become a litmus test for Republican primary candidates facing scrutiny from the party&rsquo;s resurgent right wing.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The hardening stance on immigration is mirrored in California&rsquo;s Republican gubernatorial primary race, where front-runner Meg Whitman has adopted a tough posture on undocumented workers after attacks from rival Steve Poizner.</p>
<p>Whitman, former chief executive of eBay Inc, says she is &#8220;100 percent against amnesty, no exception&#8221; and has been consistent in her position, although a Poizner ad shows her discussing a system for illegal immigrants to go to the end of the line and pay a fine to become legal.</p>
<p>&#8216;LURCH TO THE RIGHT&rsquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Conservative Michelle Malkin, wrote that she needed a Dramamine, a nausea medicine, to cover McCain&rsquo;s re-election bid, saying that his &#8220;desperate lurch to the right&#8221; induced &#8220;more motion sickness than a Disney Land teacup.&#8221;</p>
<p>But despite the carping, the shift may be helping McCain as he heads into the August 24 state primary.</p>
<p>A Rasmussen Reports poll on May 19 showed McCain with a 12-point lead over his rival, up from five points a month earlier. And some voters say they are being won over by his renewed vigor on immigration and border security.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>ALIENATING HISPANICS</p>
<p>The tough message on migrants and the border may be just what Republican voters want to hear in Arizona&rsquo;s primary, and in the June 8 primary in California.</p>
<p>But analysts say the party risks damaging its already strained relationship with Hispanics, a bloc with growing clout in U.S. politics who voted for Obama in 2008 by a two-to-one margin.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The signs that Hispanics are getting switched off by Republican anger over immigration are already clear in Arizona, where McCain courted Latino voters two years ago with talk of shared family values and compassion for the undocumented.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t want to cut and run .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but it is harder to register Hispanics over to the Republican Party,&#8221; said DeeDee Blase, the founder of a group called &#8220;Somos Republicans,&#8221; Spanish for &#8220;We Are Republicans.&#8221;</p>

<p>What the article doesn&rsquo;t mention is that Whitman was falling in the polls and was shaping up to lose against Poizner, until she finally came around and started hammering amnesty and illegal immigration. This is actually something that no GOP nominee since Pete Wilson has dared to do: attack illegal immigration directly.</p>

		<p>This election is primarily about what do you mean by &#8220;republicans&#8221;.</p>
<p>The specific people and the agenda they are behind is changing drastically.</p>
<p>McCain will soon be out of a job.</p>
<p>Those that replace him will gain a permanent lock on power by advancing agendas like a hard stance on mestizos (there is no such thing as &#8220;hispanics&#8221;).</p>

		<p>The Republicans will never even get a simple majority of the Hispanic vote because a very sizeable percentage of this population have IQs below what&rsquo;s needed to even finish high school, let alone college. And it doesn&rsquo;t take somenone with a genius IQ to figure out that people with little education are much more likely to live in poverty and thus be dependant on government programs for sustenance. The Mestizo underclass will never vote for any party that promotes a platform of &#8220;limited government,&#8221; plain and simple. Unless/until the &#8220;stupid party&#8221; finally realizes that Whites are their only reliable constituency, the &#8220;hispandering&#8221; will continue to no avail. </p>

		<p>This is a vile fiction to it&rsquo;s very core. I have heard this same lament for two decades of elction cycles, and not once have I seen evidence in an actual race that it was remotely true. </p>
<p>And were it not for Republican fecklessness on &#8220;immigration&#8221; in the first place, they wouldn&rsquo;t be in this position either way, would they?  </p>

		<p>If they weren&rsquo;t against it before, they aren&rsquo;t against it now.  They are lying to you and still believing you are really, really stupid.  They will betray you after the election as they always have done.  McCain has NO principles whatever.  Don&rsquo;t believe for a second he has had a change of heart.  As for Whitman, don&rsquo;t believe HER either.  She&rsquo;s suddenly not a multi-cult devotee?  Bull.  Under her leadership Ebay disallowed any German fascist related items unless books, disallowed any K-group items, forbid the sale of ivory - ANY ivory - even that was documented as legal import or long in country, forbid anything gun related including low cap mags except holsters, etc, blackballed any and all items depicting blacks in an &#8220;unfavorable&#8221; light, expelled from Ebay anybody who did so even if they were unaware of the rules, expelled anybody who argued with Ebay minions, bought out Paypal and made Paypal the ONLY method of payment (thereby ripping off sellers for TWO fees - well she&rsquo;s one of the Chosen ya know), and donated to all the usual liberal orgs like gays, immigrant activist organizations, fought against prop 8, etc etc etc.  If voters buy their lies and their act, then they are as stupid as McCain/Whitman think they are.</p>

		<p>I hope that the people of Arizona will not fall for John McCain&rsquo;s current ruse of pretending to be a conservative.  In this hilarious Youtube video John McCain says, &#8220;Build the dang fence&#8221;:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0lwusMxiHc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0lwusMxiHc</a></p>
<p>But he voted <i>against</i> funding the fence.  He did cosponsor an illegal alien amnesty with Ted Kennedy.  J.D. Hayworth is far from being a perfect candidate, but he is consistently against illegal immigration.  I hope he wins the primary.</p>
<p>How come we never see articles about how the Democrats&rsquo; support for illegal immigration, along with forced busing and affirmative action, has lost them tens of millions of white votes?  The Reagan Democrats in the 80s didn&rsquo;t vote for Reagan because he wanted to give millionaires tax cuts.  Of course my question was rhetorical.  All the mass media favors the Democrat agenda, which is why we never see them ask that question.</p>
<p>Two thirds of Hispanics consistently vote for the party of hand outs and racial preferences.  The Democrats know this, which is why they want more Mexicans and Guatemalans in this country.  Maybe, just maybe, the Stupid Party is starting to wise up and recognize this fact too.</p>

		<p>Meg Whitman is totally for amnesty&hellip;you know the kind&hellip;pay a fine, (sure, like they will) go to the back of line (while staying in our country) she is all for that &#8220;Immigration Reform&#8221; we all hollered about and stopped under Bush. They had her on a local talk show a week or so ago and I heard it straight from the her mouth. She also would have voted against the Arizona crackdown on illegals and said that law was not good!  Not good for whom, Meg?  I pray she does not become Governor, but what a choice we have with Jerry Brown as the Dem runner! California is sinking faster and faster.</p>

		<p>First of all, anyone would have to be a FOOL to vote McCain back into office. He has had YEARS to address the illegal problem in Arizona and has never had the spine to do it despite the deteriation of the state. Are folks there to believe he gives a rats ass about it now? Only when his job is on the line does he care. Second of all, the quote in this article that says &#8220;Hispanics, a bloc with growing clout in US politics&#8221; should scare the hell out of the likes of McCain. Wait til one comes along and takes YOUR job buddy. Now that would truly be poetic justice.</p>

<p>I know that at the time E-Bay banned certain periphenelia from that regime you mentioned, they still allowed Communist stuff.  Also, when the Whitman regime bought PayPal, P/P mysteriously canceled a lot of accounts for a lot of right wing groups.  </p>
<p>Whitman is also an H-1B fanatic.  Similar to the other big named woman in California Republican politics, Carly H-1Borina who wants Barbara Boxer&rsquo;s job.</p>

		<p>Remember, the key word in the immigration debate is not &#8220;amnesty&#8221; but &#8220;legalization&#8221; earned or otherwise.  The phrase &#8220;going to the end of the line&#8221; is another ruse as the illegal immigrants get to legally stay in the USA which is what they wanted in the first place.  So what if their citizenship is delayed by a couple of years as they still get most of the benefits.</p>
<p>A Republican such as McCain attempting to win latino voters by pandering to them about legalization is futile as a majority of the latinos are going to vote for the Democrats anyway.  So now McCain has &#8220;enforcement&#8221; religion.  Sort of a &#8220;deathbed&#8221; conversion I say.<br/>

		<p>The Republicans better grow a set.  The upcoming election will be a watershed for both parties.  If Republicans win and control Congress, they can proceed to secure the borders, strictly enforce immigration and labor law, and interpret the 14th Amendment to mean birthright citizenship will be granted to only those born here to at least one parent who is &#8220;under the jurisdiction of&#8221; the U.S. Constitution.  2010 will be the perfect opportunity to halt the runaway train this nation is on to fast becoming North Mexico. </p>
<p>With Republicans in power, and conservative nominees to the Supreme Court, laws like Plyler v. D.O.E. requiring American citizens to educate any foreign invader who can walk onto U.S. school property can be overturned.  This would stop the ringing &#8220;come-and-get-it&#8221; dinner bell across the world and finally indicate the free lunch in the U.S. is over.</p>
<p>With no more anchor babies there would be no more welfare, food stamps, or entitlements for illegals and their offspring. Emergency medical care would come at a cost:  hospitals would be required to report immediately to ICE any illegal patient demanding treatment. </p>
<p>The U.S. is for those who have a stake in its success.  When we let the world know our citizenship comes at a price, they will either come here legally, willing to shoulder their load or go home.  The cold shoulder works.  Self-deportation works, and will save this nation.  They broke in, now break out.</p>

		<p>I think the whole Republican party needs to &#8220;lurch to the right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps if they did so in 2008 they wouldn&rsquo;t have alienated all those conservatives who chose to stay home rather than hold their nose and vote for RINO Juan McCain.</p>
<p>They could have saved us from the Obamination.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a true, viable CONSERVATIVE party.  By definition, a &#8220;conservative&#8221; party CANNOT support a revamping of America by importing people from alien lands along with their alien ways, because that would utterly fail to CONSERVE our way of life for posterity.</p>
<p>What we seem to have is a political party with a serious crisis of identity that seems to think it needs to be what the liberals say it should be.</p>
<p>Then again, I suppose it was only a matter of time before the feel-good multicultural Marxism that&rsquo;s taught in virtually every institution of higher learning would someday seep into the Republican establishment.  After all, they did run out and install a token black man as party head once the Democrats put theirs in the White House.  Speaks volumes to me.</p>

		<p>White people still make up 2/3 of the American population.  We have the ability to pass any pro-white, pro-American law we want.  The problem is that most elections bring out 40% of the populace at best.  <br/>
The reason so many people don&rsquo;t cast a ballot is apparently because they think both parties are so much alike that it makes little or no difference who wins.  But with candidates who support Tea Party measures, at least there&rsquo;s a chance for change.  And the major parties will have to shift positions if and when it becomes obvious that most voters want major action against illegal aliens.<br/>
About 1/3 of even Hispanic Americans want anti-illegal measures passed.  A majority of black Americans do.  And, of course, the vast majority of white Americans do.<br/>
I&rsquo;ll say it again and again.  WHITE AMERICANS, VOTE!!!!</p>

		<p>People with their hands out for handouts will never vote for someone who is going to try to make them EARN their way. Stupid republicans need to direct their efforts toward earning the votes of the achievers in society. Roll the dice and see what comes up, if they continue on their current course the dice will always come up snake eyes. A perfect solution to solving our current fiasco would be to pass a law which states, and would have to be enforced to the full letter, whereas if you dont pay income tax you can&rsquo;t vote. Of course that is about as likely as a snowball&rsquo;s chance in hell, or for all the nonbelievers a chance in a blast furnace. </p>

		<p>If Arizona Republicans get suckered by McCain&rsquo;s ruse, we&rsquo;ll have 6 more years of &#8220;tone down the rhetoric&#8221;, &#8220;you&rsquo;re being mean spirited&#8221;, the Swift Boat Vets and Minutemen are &#8220;disingenuous&#8221; and more legislation co-sponsored with liberal Democrats like Feingold, Lieberman and Kennedy. <br/>
Let&rsquo;s hope that enough Arizonans come to their senses by primary time.</p>
<p>The Hispanic vote has never been close to a Republican majority despite the pandering and is only 8% of the total.  Repubs would do better to be conservative and solidify their support from White voters, who are still three-quarters of the total.<br/>
