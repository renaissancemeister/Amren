<h1><a href="https://www.earthtimes.org/articles/news/331980,call-iq-tests-immigrants.html">Berlin Rejects Call for IQ Tests on Immigrants</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>"DPA," Earth Times Online, June 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Berlin swiftly rejected Monday a call by two right-of-centre legislators to introduce intelligence tests for new immigrants, with a spokesman saying it was a &#8220;weird&#8221; idea.</p>
<p>Christoph Steegmans, deputy government spokesman, said the proposal encouraged nasty prejudices.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s also not particularly intelligent in itself,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Attributing stupidity to immigrants as a group is absolutely discriminatory.&#8221; He added that it was &#8220;weird&#8221; to think of testing migrants&rsquo; intelligence before arrival.</p>
<p>Peter Trapp, who is state spokesman on interior policy for his party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), had been quoted in the tabloid Bild on Monday as saying he supported IQ tests for immigrants.</p>
<p>He [Peter Trapp, spokesman for the Christian Democratic Union (CDU)] was backed by a member of the European Parliament, Markus Ferber, for the Bavaria-only Christian Social Union (CSU), who said, &#8220;Canada is a lot more advanced, and requires immigrant children to have a higher IQ than its own.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Germany already has a written test which migrants must pass to obtain long-term residence. They are obliged to answer questions about the German political system and German attitudes to tolerance.</p>
<p>Ethnic issues, with right-wingers complaining that immigrants refuse to assimilate, generally get less attention in Germany than in neighbouring lands like the Netherlands, Switzerland and Austria.</p>

		<p>I may say something to you?<br>
Germany as a country is lost. And I don&rsquo;t say that to make any panic. In all white countries there are at least some people who woke up. But not in Germany. <br>
France is voting right, Italy, Austria, Poland, Swiss, Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark and Hungary fallowed. But Germany is still sleeping.</p>

		<p>IQ test?  Why bother?  Just end immigration, throw all non Whites and muslims out of the country, and encourage the Germans to have more sex.  Problem solved.</p>

		<p>If all races are equally intelligent, why are intelligence tests &#8220;discriminatory&#8221;?  And if it&rsquo;s not about race, ethnicity, or national origin, why NOT discriminate against the stupid when it comes to immigration?  Your own stupid people are your own; you&rsquo;re stuck with them.  But why bring in new stupid people?  There&rsquo;s only one word for such a policy - you guessed it - stupid.</p>

		<p>it merits noting that the Ellis island immigration to America also involved an IQ test of a sort - people were required to show ability to read in their native language. Maybe it wasn&rsquo;t much (then again, back then literacy may have been lower everywhere so it could be a bigger deal) but it did impose some lower bound on intelligence and social class of the arrivals.</p>

		<p>Sounds like something out of WWII where the Nazis are all into Eugenics.  I like it.  If you&rsquo;re going to let immigrants into your country with little skills to offer, you might as well test them to see if they have a chance at assimilating into society.</p>
<p>But oh no!  That would be discriminatory.  We can&rsquo;t have you testing who is an idiot and who isn&rsquo;t.  </p>
<p>Discrimination:  You&rsquo;re generally unfit for a modern society and add nothing, yet you take a great deal.  Can&rsquo;t say or act out upon that conclusion because that would be discriminatory.</p>
<p>Racism:  You said something negative about me or a group that I belong to even though it may in fact be true.  That&rsquo;s racist.</p>

<p><br>
As a Canadian, this is news to me. </p>
<p>What I believe this person is mistakenly referring to, is a &#8220;points system&#8221; used by Immigration Canada to evaluate the TOTAL &#8220;worthiness&#8221; of an immigration applicant   &mdash;   but the &#8220;points&#8221; are for things like the ability to speak English or French; level of education; how much investment money they&rsquo;d bring into the country; etc. I&rsquo;m pretty sure IQ or related intelligence issues play no part of this process   &mdash;   although I wish they did, as such testing would certainly keep out ALL the Somalis (to name but ONE group) who keep pouring into our large cities.  </p>
<p>But if this fiction about Canada helps right-wing German politicians to sell the idea of IQ-testing their immigrants to German voters, then I&rsquo;m willing to play along. </p>

		<p>Enh, don&rsquo;t worry if the majority says it&rsquo;s weird. Just keep the idea coming up, get people talking about it, thinking about it, let people get the acknowledgement that others are thinking the same way, making it less unacceptable, and in a few years it won&rsquo;t be &#8216;weird&rsquo; anymore. </p>
<p>Somewhat similar to how gay marriage has gone in the US, except, where that appeals to fairness, the IQ test idea appeals to the id&rsquo;s xenophobia. Maybe I&rsquo;m judging by myself too much but, I have to think that has some power. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s easy to see at once how low-IQ immigrants would not be an asset to any country. No question about that at all.</p>
<p>But, on second thought, do you really want high-IQ imigrants - people who are smarter than you -  coming in either? In a couple of generations, they&rsquo;ll own and run the place and you will be working for them in a country that had been yours. Is that really what you want?</p>
<p>In other words, Germans,  neither kind of immigrants are good for you. What you really need to do is populate and run your own country for yourselves.  This whole immigration mania is  self-destructive madness.</p>
