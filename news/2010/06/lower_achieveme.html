<h1>Lower Achievements at Mixed Schools</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thijs Papôt, Radio Netherlands Worldwide, June 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For years and years, the Åeperfect schoolÅf was defined by having the right ratio of black to white, native to migrant and rich to poor. However, recent Dutch research has exposed this myth. Children at mixed schools consistently score lower grades than their peers at predominantly white or black schools.</p>
<p>Dutch sociology professor Jaap Dronkers has carried out research into the pros and cons of ethnic diversity in secondary education. He compared student achievement in language, math and physics of 15-year-old children in 15 Western countries. Much to his surprise, studentsÅf grades were inversely proportional to ethnic diversity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I interpret lower student achievement at ethnically diverse schools to mean that a great deal of energy is spent on bridging the various cultural gaps between students. As a result, teachers are unable to focus on teaching. They keep hopping from one culture to the next. It uses up time and energy not spent on teaching.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Comparable</b></p>
<p>No data were available for the Netherlands, but Professor Dronkers believes his findings are also applicable to this country as education in surrounding countries like Denmark, Belgium and Germany is in his opinion comparable to the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The ethnic make-up of Dutch schools is a highly sensitive issue. The existence of separate ÅeblackÅf and ÅewhiteÅf schools is generally regarded as undesirable. However, as long as the segregation leads to a homogenous student body, the effects are not necessarily negative. On the contrary, a ÅeblackÅf school where 80 percent of the children were of Turkish descent outperformed a school of much greater ethnic diversity.</p>
<p><b>Islamic</b></p>
<p>Another noteworthy finding from his research are the generally below-average achievements of students with an Islamic background.</p>
<p>&#8220;This cannot be explained by their socio-economic backgrounds or the characteristics of schools or educational systems. So what is the reason? It is very well possible that they are being discriminated against, but this also holds true for non-Islamic children. People will say: they are the children of migrant workers, but so were the Italians. The remaining factor is religion.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Poor families</b></p>
<p>Not everybody agrees with Professor DronkersÅf conclusions. Dutch writer and educational expert Anja Vink says the professor places too much emphasis on culture and religion. She argues that socio-economical circumstances are widely accepted as determining factors for the educational achievement of children.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are focussing on colour, culture and religion, but what is being left out is that these children are from poor families. This could also apply to poor native children. If you attend a Åewhite trash schoolÅf you would get the same results. You will see this in the provinces of Friesland, Groningen en Limburg.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Highly educated parents</b></p>
<p>Ms Vink, who wrote a book on black schools in the Netherlands, says that the conclusion that Islamic students are falling behind also merits further explanation.</p>
<p>&#8220;This may be true of Moroccan and Turkish children, but children of Afghan, Iranian and Iraqi descent often do better in school than even some native children. The explanation lies in the fact that they are children of highly-educated parents.&#8221;</p>
<p>Professor Dronkers agrees that ethnic diversity can have a positive effect on children of highly educated parents. &#8220;In that case there is an added value.&#8221; The scientist says that migrant children from non-Islamic countries like China, South Korea and India are also a positive exception to the rule.<br>

		<p>The MSM will spin this as a good thing because it shows that the achievement gap can be closed by preventing all White schools.</p>
<p>Send the Whites to school with blacks, and their scores go down toward the black end of the scale, thus helping to close the achievement gap.</p>
<p>Whites must be surrounded by blacks at all times or we will &#8220;develop unhealthy White identities,&#8221; which are exhibited by high test scores.<br>

		<p>I worked in a school that was 70% latino, 30% black, and there was ONE white kid.  He was a hapless son of recent Italian immigrants.  He was a mixture, if you can believe this, of guido culture and gangsta rap/hip hop.</p>
<p>I am not kidding - it was a seamless fit.  He had this dark skinned dominican girl hanging all over him (his girlfriend) and she was ten times smarter than him.  (Like a lot of such girls, they want a nice white guy, but this loser was all that was available.)</p>
<p>Needless to say, diversity did him no favors.  While he had more native intelligence than most of his peers, he had no interest in working to anywhere near his potential.  </p>
<p>The whole urban hip hop/have fun/don&rsquo;t learn or work hard ethos has captured, in my estimation probably about 90% of kids of all races in the big cities, and perhaps 30-40% in the suburbs.</p>
<p>In my experience, diversity only hurts white kids, because the girls are helpless against the sexual advances of blacks and latinos and the boys are so naive and confused that they mostly adopt the ghetto &#8216;tude so they look tough.</p>
<p>In the absence of fathers, a lot of these white kids from broken homes take Tupac, Jay Z and Rihanna as their role models to follow.  Have you ever seen a white person who adopted black culture whole heartedly?  It ain&rsquo;t pretty.  Chinese or Indian kids who do it are quite funny, though.</p>

		<p>In these cases we never get to hear what the teachers think. I&rsquo;d like to hear the opinions of the older ones who have been in many different school environments. I&rsquo;m guessing that many teachers think diversity has been bad for Dutch schools but are afraid to say so.</p>
<p>Why did the Netherlands even get into this situation in the first place? It&rsquo;s a densely populated country and needs no immigrants. By most measures it is a very successful country. The cities and countryside are beautiful. There&rsquo;s lots of innovation there. Why screw around with something that works?</p>

		<p>Permissiveness is particularly destructive to Blacks.  Farrakan&rsquo;s approach to education usefully recognized this.</p>

		<p>My guess would be that the tension between the kids of color and the white Dutch kids is so great that no real learning of a serious nature can go on. Everyone is constantly distracted and having to watch their back all the time.</p>
<p>The distractions from mixing and the fear of being attacked or beaten [primarily white kids fearing attack from Muslims] is so great, serious learning cannot be done.</p>

		<p>Create all white schools.  Push them hard but make sure they include a representative level of median and higher IQs.  Then show, 10-15 years after graduation, what their social achievement levels are at in terms of college and/or trades, getting ready for the workplace.</p>
<p>If the Netherlands is happy now.  They won&rsquo;t be when the attitude of easy living and the lack of education or simple intellligence that goes with it, cause a massive collapse in the professional classes, 20 years down the road.</p>
<p>Of course, all of this would have to be done on the sly through a charter or private system.  And then the data dumped on the public in comparison with scores from other, mixed-ethny, schools.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to shoot for the moon to win.  You just have to keep your nose to that grindstone and make -something- of our life.  And you will beat 90% of the burger slingers and other unskilleds who coasted.</p>
<p>To a halt.</p>

		<p>No matter the outcome of these research projects, we can be confident it will always be White European natives who are earmarked to be the ones who are doubly dispossessed of their ancestral homelands and then disenfranchised of the full realization of both their potential and actual academic/sports abilities so as to make certain that only non-White aliens get to collectively experience the full benefits of that which is called &#8216;equality&rsquo; and, at the same time, receive extra funding and increased concentrated tutorial coaching so as to further ensure they receive the full benefits of unfair race-based advantages across all social spectrums through the vehicle of deliberate politically engineered stealth in the shape of Affirmative Action, Quotas and also preferential healthcare, housing and employment provisions as they progress up the social ladder. </p>
<p>It goes without saying, of course, that the FAR LEFT happy-clappy multicult and diversity situation of Holland and every other White European homeland should never have been allowed to arise in the first place.</p>
<p>No matter how the Far Left multicultists and diversocrats try to cut it, scam it and ram it, multiple races and their associated cultures all occupying the living spaces of territories that belong to non-related separate other nations who, in turn, belong to a totally different race with their own distinct individual heritages, cultures and traditions, is absolutely unnatural and genocidal towards the indigenous nations, to begin with.</p>
<p>Eventually and in the near future, full-scale reversal measures will have to be considered starting with the mass deportation of illegals and financial inducements for the repatriation of so-called legals.<br>
