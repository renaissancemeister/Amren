<h1><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/19/AR2010061903034.html">Democrats Spend Big to Lure Obama&rsquo;s Minority and Young Voters Back to the Polls</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Karen Tumulty, Washington Post, June 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As political gambles go, it&rsquo;s a big and risky one: $50 million to test the proposition that the Democratic Party&rsquo;s outreach to new voters that helped make Barack Obama president can work in an election where his name is not on the ballot.</p>
<p>The standard rule of midterm elections is that only the most reliable voters show up at the polls, so both parties have traditionally focused on the unglamorous and conventional work that turns out their bases. But this year, the Democrats are doubling down on registering and motivating newer voters  &mdash;  especially the 15 million heavily minority and young, who made it to the polls for the first time in the last presidential election.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Much about its &#8220;Vote 2010&#8221; effort has that way-back feel of two years ago: legions of canvassers going door-to-door, a stream of inspirational videos, an e-mail list of more than 13 million, and ads on Web sites including Latina.com, BlackPlanet.com, YELP.com and DailyCandy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There does not seem to be a similar effort within the GOP. A spokesman would not discuss its operations and scoffed at the bet that Democrats are making this year. &#8220;When that announcement was made, it just wasn&rsquo;t taken very credibly,&#8221; says Republican National Committee spokesman Doug Heye. &#8220;Those voters just aren&rsquo;t going to be there this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some veteran Democratic Party operatives are also skeptical that the $50 million investment will pay off  &mdash;  except, perhaps, in keeping the grassroots operation alive for Obama&rsquo;s reelection bid two years from now. Some even suggest that the president&rsquo;s team has put his long-term interests ahead of his party&rsquo;s immediate struggle for survival.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Party officials concede that their efforts to remotivate the new Obama voters are not likely to affect contests where Democrats are running far behind. But they insist it is not unreasonable to believe they can make a difference in races that will be decided by two to four percentage points.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, for instance, Gov. Ed Rendell  &mdash;  himself a former national Democratic Party chairman  &mdash;  notes that Democrats now outnumber Republicans in voter registration by 1.3 million, an advantage nearly three times larger than when he ran for governor in 2002. &#8220;They are motivate-able,&#8221; Rendell said of newer Democratic voters. &#8220;Can you motivate all 100 percent of them? No. Can you motivate 20 percent of them? Yes.&#8221; How much higher it goes than that, Rendell said, &#8220;will decide whether we win or lose.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a young white male who voted for Obama in 2008 because, as a veteran of the War in Iraq, his rhetoric that he would withdraw troops struck a chord with me, and he seemed to be the lesser of two evils, since a Paul presidency was not going to happen. </p>
<p><br>
Now, more than two years into his term, I&rsquo;m thinking of the old &#8220;Who&#8221; song. I won&rsquo;t get fooled again. If Palin or Gindal is the nominee for the republican party, I will be writing in a protest for Ron Paul. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna happen.  College students have gone back to their Facebook and Iphones and blacks don&rsquo;t care about a bunch of white democrats seeking reelection.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m worried 2010 will see a resurgence in neoconservatives in the Congress by dumb voters just looking to punish Democrats.  We&rsquo;ll see a rerun of 2006 with more trade pacts, globalism, bomb, bomb, bomb Iran and of course &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221; in which even John McCain will jump on the bandwagon, after he&rsquo;s cleared for another four years.    </p>

<p>Certainly, they are hoping for some more of this Red magic in 2010:</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that is a video of the current congress and administration in caucus!</p>
<p>I digress however, as it is clear, we are on a path toward chaos as never seen before in history. No we can&rsquo;t be?</p>
<p>Oh, yes we can be!</p>
<p>These arrogant &ldquo;revolutionaries&rdquo; honestly believe that chanting sessions, decorated with Cuban flags that  have Che&rsquo;s image superimposed on them, mean something tangible. Just like cranking a &ldquo;secret&rdquo; money printing press, can magically produce real currency of value; or some &ldquo;multicultural&rdquo; goose expels golden eggs. This is far from sarcasm, it is how they visibly operate. </p>
<p>Just think about it and then draw your own conclusions!</p>

		<p>Right. They all wanted to register to vote and wanted to vote so badly ONLY BECAUSE OBAMA WAS RUNNING. Otherwise, they could care less about voting. It is of no matter to them at any other time. Very sad indeed.</p>
<p>&#8220;only the most reliable voters show up at the polls&#8221;</p>
<p>Right again. NOT only the most reliable voters but the most reliable citizens of our nation. People such as are on this forum.</p>

		<p>Before Obama was president, no black candidate for president was ever a serious choice because people feared what could happen.  Now that Obama is president, all those worst fears have happened, virtually guaranteeing (especially to those that quietly wield power behind the scenes) that no black person will ever again be allowed any real say in American politics.  Too many simply have too much to lose.</p>
<p>Watch as a new soft racism becomes dominant in US culture.  In the past, race was denied from top to bottom in our culture, as decisions were made outside the best interests of whites.  In the new soft racism, the denial will still be there, maybe even stronger, but a whole bunch of excuses, most of them paper thin, will be given for making decisions in the best interests of whites&hellip;.all the while it won&rsquo;t be about race.</p>
<p>Example is what is going on in arizona.  That&rsquo;s totally about race and what arizona is doing is motivated solely by white racial self-interest.  Yet nobody will say this overtly.  More importantly, cries of racism by opponents, fall on deaf ears.</p>
<p>Whites have found a way to maintain race denial while adopting race protecting behaviors&hellip;..an interesting and unexpected development.</p>
<p>Just under the surface is the threat of full blown racial awakening.  Those who use identity politics as a weapon against whites now have the very real fear that if they push things, whites will snap into full racial awakening and organize against them overtly.  What I find particularly interesting is how quickly this all developed, after decades of self-defeating, even self-enslaving behavior from whites.</p>

		<p>#6 makes a good point.  Since the 1960s most whites have been in denial and manipulating race hustlers (black and white) have used that against us.  When someone accuses of racism, just say, &#8220;So?  Your point it?&#8221; </p>
