<h1>City of Seattle to Contractors: No White Males Need Apply?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carl Gipson, Washington Policy Blog, June 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some of the money set aside for the Mercer Corridor Project [in Seattle] comes from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, aka the &#8220;stimulus package&#8221; President Obama signed into law in early 2009. As stipulated by federal requirements, the city must set aside a certain amount of work for disadvantaged business enterprises (DBEs)  &mdash;  these are businesses owned and operated by women or minorities  &mdash;  and certified by the state&rsquo;s Office of Minority and Women&rsquo;s Business Enterprises.</p>
<p>The state DOT says, &#8220;The purpose of the MWBE program is to provide maximum practicable opportunity for firms owned and operated by minorities and women in public works projects and procurement.&#8221;</p>
<p>The city of Seattle recently hosted a pre-bid meeting to let contractors and subcontractors know how to comply with training requirements for minority apprentices. Apparently the current system is complex enough to merit extra explanatory meetings. On the PowerPoint presentation (slide 7) is the bullet point telling interested subcontractors that they &#8220;Must use under represented groups  &mdash;  No white males w/o WSDOT approval and extensive good faith effort documentation.&#8221;  MercerCSDPreBidPresentation 7</p>
<p>So what does this really mean? Could the city of Seattle really be telling contractors and subcontractors bidding for work on this project that no white males need apply?</p>
<p>Fortunately, the answer is no; but the City sure has a funny way of putting things. Turns out that both federal and state laws require outreach for DBEs on public projects. These programs are to ensure that DBEs get a shot at doing lucrative business with government entities. The phrase &#8220;no white males&#8221; is actually hinting at a federal training program requirement. The Federal Highway Administration has apprenticeship programs set aside for minority workers. It is possible for non-minority workers to get into these apprenticeship programs, but they need a special waver. This is what the PowerPoint slide refers to: no white males in these apprenticeships programs unless they&rsquo;ve already received the official exemption.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When you add up the cost of compliance with some of these well-meaning rules, are the benefits outweighed by the costs? What does it say when small businesses in the construction industry (the two worst combinations of business classifications during this recession) feel like they are unable to compete for public works projects based on racial preferences?<br>

<p>Prediction:  The project will run way over budget, way over time, and there will be numerous errors and screw ups during and after the project.</p>

<p>They try to disguise it with names like &#8220;disadvantaged.&#8221;</p>

<p>Govt. policy has gone so far beyond &#8220;equal opportunity&#8221; when it comes to awarding contracts, to the point where they actually exercise the exact kind of discrimination that the law is supposed to remedy.  </p>

<p>There is no doubt that this is exactly what will happen. What SHOULD happen, in addition, is that no White male in the country should come to the rescue when the inevitable happens. Just boycott any and all of these anti White projects. Let these shoddy workmanship projects be a testament to what can be expected when you exclude Whites from ANY project that requires an above average intellect. </p>
<p>This is unfortunately, an unlikely scenario though. Probably what will happen is the minority firms will create one disaster after another and Whites will be brought in to rectify things. Then the liberal pols can bring the media in and point to the great outcome of the minority built projects, which in reality would be engineering disasters if not rescued by Whites. <br>

<p>&ldquo;What does it say when small businesses in the construction industry (the two worst combinations of business classifications during this recession) feel like they are unable to compete for public works projects based on racial preferences?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is racial profiling against the segment of the population, that is least likely to: complicate development, increase workplace violence, or simply attempt a workplace &ldquo;lotto&rdquo; at the employer&rsquo;s expense. In short, a sort of &ldquo;enriching&rdquo; circus of the differently abled or progressively motivated &ldquo;workers,&rdquo; that thrive on riding the horse of &ldquo;excellence&rdquo; and many different colors.</p>
<p>A sort of Pegasus with paper wings, or a seahorse that is allergic to saltwater?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Disadvantaged&#8221;, eh? Let&rsquo;s see. Women get 60% of the college degrees, are the majority of voters, own the majority of the wealth and spend most of the money. Indians and Orthodox Jews are now included, two of the most affluent groups in the US (thanks Reagan). I don&rsquo;t know if the Chinese are still members of the club, though I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised (I think it&rsquo;s a lifetime deal). The Muslims are currently lobbying for inclusion.</p>

		<p>A white guy might get a waiver if he is liberal and has a history of supporting liberal causes.  Or the white guy might get a waiver if he is ten times better qualified and the project is hopelessly mired in chaos.  Then they will hire him to fix it.</p>
<p>Otherwise, white men need not apply. </p>

		<p>4 Mike Harrigan:</p>
<p>Your reasoning brought to mind the exact reason I predicted that.  And that was the folly that was the most recent leg of St. Louis&rsquo;s light rail system.  The public transit system farmed it out to AA contractors, and they literally couldn&rsquo;t do the work.  So the transit system itself took it over, stuffed any news that AA was to blame down the hare hole (the transit system is mostly black in terms of employees), and finished the project, two years late and $200 million over budget.  </p>
<p>This forced the system to raise the fares across the board, both on light rail and buses, and make service cutbacks, until suburban voters passed a sales tax increase.  But it was all for a useless light rail line that almost serves no plausible purpose, which would have been far cheaper to service with more buses.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m surprised they&rsquo;re so upfront about it. When they passed the civil rights laws in the 60&rsquo;s, politicians assured us that it would in no way result in quota systems or other intrusive schemes. Yet that&rsquo;s just what has happened and continues to create these race based scenarios. We were misled then, and are being misled now, seeing as a large part of the public got taken in by the &#8220;hope&#8221; and &#8220;change&#8221; con game. The game now seems to be to divert yet more public resources to non-whites by using the neutral term &#8220;need&#8221;, as in there&rsquo;s a need for help in some sector or other. This simply means the transfer of money from whites to blacks without mentioning race. The concept of civil rights has metastasized into something totally different; it&rsquo;s become a hugely parasitical institution.      </p>

		<p>No big deal here. They&rsquo;ve been doing this for many years now. The White Men still get the contracts. All they do is set up a dummy company &#8220;owned&#8221; by they&rsquo;re wives or some minority. Sometimes, there are minority owned outfits set up just for the purpose of being the dummy front for the White guys. </p>
<p>This set aside stuff never was anything but corruption, so that&rsquo;s what breeds, more corruption.</p>

<p>Just WHAT is so well-meaning about these rules?  I know, I know.  They are &#8216;helping&rsquo; the disadvantaged.  Somehow this sounds so do-gooder and feel-good like &#8220;just looking for a better life&#8221; and &#8220;they do the jobs Americans ( read Whites) won&rsquo;t do&#8221;.</p>
<p>They try to make it sound like they don&rsquo;t grasp what effect this all has on society as a whole.  I think they are fully aware.</p>

		<p>Sometimes I think that white men will one day wake up and realize they have been dispossed of the land built by their fathers by a quasi-marxist ideology, and that said men will refuse to cooperate as much as possible with the &#8216;system&rsquo; and watch it collapse, all the while preparing certain areas of the continent for exclusive habitation.  </p>
<p>I know people talk about it, but as a keen observer, I wonder how this thing will play out.  I fear for the future.  We are entering one of those periods of upheaval we learn about in our history books.</p>

		<p>This sort of thing is plentiful in South Africa, once there where 5 posts for pilots available for the police so 150 whites applied, government kept them empty and the black communities protested by burning down 2 police offices, where is the logic? – Nowhere!!  How come we need affirmative action in South Africa when blacks make up 90% of the population? Why do they need affirmative action when they make up 30% of American population and let&rsquo;s guesstimate 10% of the British Population?<br>
The answer is that only a real supremacist would propose affirmative action.</p>

		<p>This will no doubt cause a downfall to the businesses practicing this anti-white discrimination. And I agree that whites should boycott them and offer no help when these businesses do fail, all because they just had to have diversity.</p>
<p>The fact is these &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; groups aren&rsquo;t disadvantaged at all. It&rsquo;s just a title they use as an excuse for special treatment and a perpetual status of victimhood.</p>

Black engineers, black supervisors, black workers, black code enforcement officers, black accountants to manage the funds&hellip; the whole thing, BLACK ONLY!  Oh yeah, then let&rsquo;s put up a sign on each end of the street that says, &#8220;This project was completely organized, constructed, and managed, by Blacks.&#8221; &hellip;oh, and by the way, we will also add to the sign, how far over budget it was, how well designed it was, how far past the deadline it was completed, and whether or not it was ever brought up to Code.  </p>

		<p>Often what happens in these situations is that a white run company hires a black man at a handsome salary to act as a front man &#8220;owner&#8221;, thus qualifying for the money.  When this is found out it creates a scandal, and the company is sued, when all they did was subvert a racist anti-white law that should never exist in the first place.  It is the real operators of the business who should be outraged, because they had to waste money hiring the front man.</p>

		<p>Well, at least they are forthright in Seattle about their message to white mailes.  In Chicago it isn&rsquo;t that evident but the same thing af far as AA policies has existed since the 1970s, and that message is that &#8216;White Males Need Not Apply.&rsquo;  It is a subject kept hush-hush by our liberal media though and evidently the white citizens don&rsquo;t seem to mind, or maybe they think City jobs don&rsquo;t pay as much as those in the private sector, which is wrong of course.  How many private sector jobs offer twelve sick deays, two week vacations after one year, fifteen paid holidays, pensions, etc.  Why no response from the Republican Party about this discrimination in Seattle or any placeelse? </p>

		<p>Couldn&rsquo;t happen to a better group of white men who are residents of Kong county Washington.  A full 53% of the white men in California voted for old Hope and Change to the obvious detriment of themselves and their kids. I suspect that close to 90% of the white men in Seattle and Kong county did the same. These fools are simply reaping the fruit of their stupidity. </p>
<p>White people in Washington seem to have gone insane.  It was in this area (perhaps nearby Oregon) where the old communist, and probable KGB agent, Bill Clinton announced that in a few years white people in the country would be the minority.  The foolish white college kids in the crowd proceeded to enthusiastically cheer the approval of the own demise.</p>
<p>Recently the Washington State legislator voted to condemn the Arizona law that allows cops to arrest for immigration violations.  Almost on the very day they did this a big story broke about an illegal arrested for attempted rape in Seattle.</p>
<p>Turns out that the illegal Mexican had been deported nine times and had served several years in the California prison system.  Had Washington cops been allowed to arrest for immigration violations, it&rsquo;s possible the attempted rape would have been avoided. This lesson of course will be totally lost on the stupid legislators, and white voters will return them to office again and again. </p>
<p>In Pierce county, adjacent to Kong county, four white cops were killed several months ago by a black criminal racist for the sake of diversity. Police school trains cops to never ever profile minorities.  Thus these wonderful white officers ignored the black thug who walked into the coffee shop where they sat planning their day and killed all four of them.  Rest assured that had a rough looking biker type white guy walked in, these misguided cops would have kept an eye on him.  Maybe they would have fabricated a reason to request an ID. </p>
<p>Also remember that it was King county Washington that reassigned their name to honor M.L. King, from the original namesake vice president King, thus sealing their fate forever to be known as Kong county.   As others have mentioned, the first county office to receive the new seal with M.L. King&rsquo;s likeness at the center was the jail and correction offices.    </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget the Jefferson Davis highway that runs through Seattle was renamed for a black union soldier.  A soldier who likely was shanghaied by slave holding General U.S. Grant into his grand union army. Having gone unnoticed by the Washington state legislators is that without the efforts of patriots like U.S. Secretary of War Jefferson Davis,and future President of the Confederacy, the northwest perhaps would have come under Russian or British domination.    </p>
<p>Strange that Harold Covington has placed his hopes for a white republic in the Northwest among so many stupid and ignorant whites.  He would have better luck in the South and Southwest where at least a large segment of the white people have vowed to not give up without a fight.  Plus, they are for more racially aware.  Guess what? Blacks respect that.     </p>

		<p>This really irritates me.  I used to deal with contractors at my last job, all residential.  On the commercial side, a job was bid to a huge contractor in our city.  This company is all White &amp; have a good reputation for their commercial work.  </p>
<p>A black man from the church that I go too  (yes, I know.  I don&rsquo;t like it either) has his own company to promote this very thing that this topic is discussing.  He made this contracting company use a minority group for a sub-contractor by going thru the state!  The company I worked for ended up being the supplier.  We had to change name on tickets due to using the minority sub contractor.  This is NOT right!  And of course this contracting company is not happy about it.  <br>
I want so badly to go to this guy at church &amp; tell him what he is doing is not right or fair.  </p>
