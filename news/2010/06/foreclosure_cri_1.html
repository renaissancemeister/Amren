<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Of borrowers who took out mortgages between 2005 and 2008, some 8% of both African-American and Latino borrowers have lost their homes to foreclosure, compared to 4.5% of non-Hispanic whites, according to a study by the Center for Responsible Lending, released Friday.</p>
<p>The racial and ethnic disparities continued even after controlling for income differences. The center&rsquo;s research shows that African-American and Latino borrowers were about 30% more likely to get higher rate subprime loans than white borrowers with similar risk characteristics.</p>
<p>Of the total pool of homeowners, 17% of Latinos have lost their homes to foreclosure or are at imminent risk of losing their homes, while 11% of African-Americans are in that position. By comparison, 7% of non-Hispanic whites have lost their homes or are about to.</p>
<p>The reason for the disparity is that African-Americans and Latinos were marketed riskier, higher cost loans that became unaffordable during the mortgage and economic crisis, said Keith Ernst, the center&rsquo;s director of research.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>African-American and Latino communities are likely to lose $373 billion in declining property values between 2009 and 2012.</p>

<p>It couldn&rsquo;t be possible that AA&rsquo;s and mexicans (sorry, I have absolutely no idea what a &#8220;latino&#8221; is) took out high risk loans because they were the only type they qualified for? What would the headlines be if an AA was told &#8220;Yes, we do have these adjustable rate loans that you could qualify for, but they are high risk and we don&rsquo;t offer them to AA&rsquo;s, they are reserved for whites&#8221; <br>
What is ironic is that these loans were concocted specifically for AA&rsquo;s and mexicans during the Clinton administration by banks so they could be in compliance with the CRA.  </p>

		<p>CNN: &#8220;The racial and ethnic disparities continued even after controlling for income differences. The center&rsquo;s research shows that African-American and Latino borrowers were about 30% more likely to get higher rate subprime loans than white borrowers with similar risk characteristics.&#8221;</p>
<p>What CNN does not report is that minorities default at higher rates   &mdash;  - EVEN AFTER CONTROLLING FOR STANDARD RISK CHARACTERISTICS. Key 1992 Boston Fed study and four later studies that debunk the Boston Fed.</p>
<p>1992 - July - A Federal Reserve Bank of Boston study indicates that &ldquo;even after controlling for financial, employment, and neighborhood characteristics, black and Hispanic mortgage applicants in the Boston metropolitan area are roughly 60 percent more likely to be turned down than whites.&rdquo; The study suggests racism is behind the higher loan denial rate.</p>
<p>1993 - Forbes Magazine queries Boston Fed Senior Vice President and Research Director Alicia H. Munnell on the default rates of black and white mortgage holders in the Boston Fed&rsquo;s 1992 study purporting to show that racism is behind the higher loan denial rate for blacks.  The reporters learn that default rates on loans of whites and minorities are equal. This indicates no discrimination, they point out to Munnell.  &ldquo;[That] is a sophisticated point,&rdquo; she replies. &ldquo;You need that [lower default rates for blacks] as a confirming piece of evidence. And we don&rsquo;t have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forbes: Did you ever ask the question that if defaults appear to be more or less the same among blacks and whites, that points to mortgage lenders making rational decisions?</p>
<p>Munnell: No &hellip; I do believe that discrimination occurs.</p>
<p>Forbes: You have no evidence?</p>
<p>Munnell: I do not have evidence &hellip; No one has evidence. (1)</p>
<p>1996 - A study by the  Federal Reserve System and academic specialists finds  &mdash;  like the 1993 Forbes investigation  &mdash;  no evidence &ldquo;of substantial levels of bias in mortgage lending.&rdquo; Quoting from the abstract of the study:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Results of the analysis fail to find evidence of better performance on loans granted to minority borrowers. Indeed, black borrowers are found, all else being equal, to exhibit a higher likelihood of mortgage default than other borrowers. These findings argue against allegations of substantial levels of bias in mortgage lending.&rdquo; </p>
<p>1998 - October - Economists Stan L. Liebowitz and Theodore Day investigate the 1992 Boston Fed study suggesting racism in the mortgage market. They are &ldquo;shocked at the poor quality&rdquo; of the the data: </p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;When we attempted to conduct a statistical analysis removing the impact of &hellip; obvious data errors, we found that the evidence of discrimination vanished. Without discrimination there would be no reason to try to &lsquo;fix&rsquo; the mortgage market. Nevertheless, our work largely evaporated down the memory hole as government regulators got busy putting the results of the Boston Fed study to use in creating policy. That policy, simply put, was to weaken underwriting standards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two economists warn: Bad loans today will mean dispossessed minorities tomorrow: </p>
<p>&ldquo;After the warm and fuzzy glow of &lsquo;flexible underwriting standards&rsquo; has worn off, we may discover that they are nothing more than standards that led to bad loans &hellip; If this is the case, current policy will not have helped its intended beneficiaries if in future years they are dispossessed from their homes due to an inability to make their mortgage payments.&rdquo; (2)</p>
<p>1999 - Finance  professors at the University of Illinois and at Wichita State University disclose findings on the creditworthiness of minorities consistent with the 1993 Forbes report, the 1996 Federal Reserve study cited earlier, and the 1998 findings of Liebowitz and Day:</p>
<p>&ldquo;[E]verything else being the same, minority applicants are probably less creditworthy, on average, than whites. Therefore, in the absence of fair lending laws, it is likely that minorities would be denied loans more frequently than whites and would pay higher interest rates and fees on approved loans &hellip;  [F]air-lending laws have the perverse effect of forcing lenders to cross-subsidize minority borrowers from the higher profits they earn on white borrowers. Such cross-subsidization is inherently &lsquo;unfair&rsquo; because it works as a tax on one group that is used as a subsidy for another.&rdquo; </p>

		<p>There were given special loans that they really didn&rsquo;t qualify for.  Then when the market value drop below the loan balance they gave it back to the bank.  That is all that is happening.</p>
<p>Since the loans were most likely FHA the taxpayers got the bill.  You can thank Clinton, Bush and Obama for this mess.  Politicians handing out loans in exchange for votes.</p>

		<p>Everybody knows that banks and finance companies make all their money lending to minorities who can&rsquo;t pay it back.  I mean, this is so basic that anybody with an ounce of common sense can see it.</p>
<p>Every bank with a portfolio of non-performing loans is a source of sheer joy to the shareholders.  I mean, they have to suffer severe losses, but these pale into insignificance against the immense satisfaction these people gain from seeing minority borrowers facing foreclosure. And, of course, if they hold the property for perhaps a hundred years, they may actually show a gain on the foreclosed assets.</p>
<p>This is capitalism at its worst and most cruel.  </p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s just say for argument sake that we have a white and minority couple who both make 85 - 90 K a year. They have approximately equal mortgages at equal interest rates(a 200K home at 5%). Neither couple takes a financial hit (job loss, medical bills, etc). However, the minority couple goes into foreclosure; there must be racism at work here. Never mind looking at spending habits, the types of cars they drive, etc.  The 8 yo Honda Accord with no bling is not going to cut it when you should be driving a Cadillac Escalade with &#8220;Sprewells&#8221;. </p>
<p>There is a well known financial radio talk show that has a 7 step plan for getting out of debt. It does not play in every market in the US. However, there is a lot of deferred gratification for the first few steps while you are tackling everything but the mortgage. The few minorities who call in pretty much tell the same story, I am trying to get out of debt but I either have people hitting me up for money or incessant criticism. </p>
<p>I guess that when the average middle age black women has less net assets than my elementary school aged children, there might be a bigger problem here. </p>

		<p>#5: Insane post. Actually this is government socialist engineering at it&rsquo;s worst forcing loans to be made to people who are so destitute they couldn&rsquo;t even pay attention. The very idea that investors are overjoyed at seeing their stocks crash, just so minorities would fail is assinine. Obviously you are someone who could get a high position in the current administration, and join in the destruction of the economy.</p>

		<p>We all know that if a white person moves out of a black neighborhood that is racism (known as &#8220;white flight&#8221;).  We all know that if a white person moves into a black neighborhood that is racism (known as &#8220;gentrification&#8221;).  We all know that if cops enforce the law in a black neighborhood that is racism (putting those poor black men into prison!) and if cops don&rsquo;t enforce the law in a black neighborhood that is racism (letting criminals run amok in black neighborhoods!).  If a bank doesn&rsquo;t give a loan to a doubtfully qualified black or latino that is racism (redlining).  If a bank does give a loan to a doubtfully qualified black or latino, who, no surprise, defaults on his loan, that is racism (reverse redlining).</p>
<p>Clearly, if a white person merely <i>exists</i> that is racism.</p>
<p>Obama worked with ACORN to sue a bank for not providing enough mortgage loans to minorities.  After winning the suit that precedent was used to force other banks into making more such loans.  So Obama played a significant role in bringing about the mortgage crisis.<br>

		<p>Once upon a time I had the misfortune to work as a mortgage loan officer.  I was not surprised to find that black applicants had shakier credit than their white counterparts.  What did come as a bit of a surprise, however, was the realization that credit history was not indexed to income. Credit delinquencies seemed just as commonplace among high-income blacks as among those barely above the poverty level. Frequently I found myself scratching my head trying to understand how some applicant&rsquo;s problems had come about, given what appeared to be income more than adequate to meet his obligations. When pressed for an explanation, the applicant usually responded that the item purchased was in some way inadequate or defective.  The fact that the company issuing the credit had nothing to do with the manufacturer or vendor of the item did not seem to occur to him.  Alternatively, the debt was not his; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not mine; I only co-signed for my brother&rsquo;s car.&rdquo; Of course, such casual observations cannot say anything about the way blacks in general tend to handle credit.  As we all know, such anecdotal testimony can bear weight only when it reflects negatively on white people. </p>
