			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Simon Cable, Daily Mail (London), June 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Claudia Schiffer has been accused of racial insensitivity after appearing on a magazine cover made up as a black woman.</p>
<p>The 39-year-old supermodel wore dark foundation and an afro wig in the shots taken by celebrated fashion designer and photographer Karl Lagerfeld.</p>
<p>His images, taken two years ago for a Dom Perignon advertising campaign, were among six shots of Miss Schiffer used by German fashion bible Stern Fotografie to celebrate its 60th anniversary.</p>
<p>But Shevelle Rhule, fashion editor at black lifestyle magazine Pride, said the images of Miss Schiffer were tasteless.</p>
<p>She said: &#8216;It shows poor taste and it&rsquo;s offensive.</p>
<p>&#8216;There are not enough women of colour featured in mainstream magazines. This just suggests you can counteract the problem by using white models.</p>
<p>&#8216;I don&rsquo;t believe they deliberately set out to offend, they obviously see it as being arty and feel that they are pushing boundaries.</p>
<p>&#8216;But clearly no thought has been given to the history behind what they have done and the comparisons it draws with minstrel shows.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The magazine has used a collection of pictures from the Dom Perignon shoot to adorn different covers of the popular magazine including another that features Schiffer as an Asian character.</p>
<p>Others depict her as a secretary, while a further image shows her impersonating Marie Antoinette.</p>
<p>Representatives of the model claim the pictures are intended to show the model as a variety of fantasy figures.</p>
<p>A spokesman said: &#8216;The pictures have been taken out of context. The images were designed to reflect different men&rsquo;s fantasies.</p>
<p>&#8216;The pictures were not intended to offend, they were done very creatively and they are some of Karl Lagerfeld&rsquo;s favourite images of Claudia. People should not jump to conclusions.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>Well, its kinda offensive to me too seeing a gorgeous white woman diversely dressed. Even worse was seeing her in the movie Black and White,<br>
http://tiny.cc/d4z5q</p>
<p>But really in the instance related to here, please lets cool your heels. She was not being disrespectful This is just another example of Afro agitators being on the lookout to cause insurrection at any moment.</p>

<p>There aren&rsquo;t?  Says who?  What percentage would be defined as &#8220;enough?&#8221;  Oh, silly me!  <i>One hundred</i> percent, of course!</p>
<p><i>&#8220;This just suggests you can counteract the problem by using white models.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Except that there<i> is</i> no &#8220;problem,&#8221; outside of the fevered minds of blacks and their White liberal sycophants.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shevelle Rhule,&#8221;  is the &#8221; fashion editor&#8221; of a &#8220;<i>black lifestyle</i> magazine&#8221; called <i> Pride</i>, and yet she has the nerve to whine about what went on in a German magazine photo shoot of a White woman <i>two years ago?</i></p>
<p>Were there any <i>White</i> lifestyle magazine editors who claimed to be offended?  Oh, wait&hellip;</p>
<p>The only thing more absurd than this fuss over a non-issue is that it was printed in a Mainstream British media outlet at all.  This is the kind of thing that passes for &#8220;news&#8221; in the Ministry of Propaganda these days.</p>

		<p><i>&lsquo;There are not enough women of colour featured in mainstream magazines. This just suggests you can counteract the problem by using white models.</i></p>
<p>In my opinion, there are TOO MANY of them in mainstream magazines. And in all the media. They are  being pushed on us incessantly, and simply everywhere.</p>
<p><i>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe they deliberately set out to offend, they obviously see it as being arty and feel that they are pushing boundaries. </i></p>
<p>They should have known by now to steer completly away from anything &#8220;black&#8221;. No matter how good your intentions, if you touch blacks, you get burned.  With blacks, you can&rsquo;t win.  It&rsquo;s just gripe, gripe, gripe. They&rsquo;ll whine and find fault with everything you do. Just avoid them!</p>
<p><i>&lsquo;But clearly no thought has been given to the history behind what they have done and the comparisons it draws with minstrel shows.&rsquo; </i></p>
<p>What would Germany know about minstrel shows? </p>

		<p>While the picture does not show it, the dress comes with a giant buttock prosthesis.</p>
<p>Why would any White women want to look like that?  At least blacks chide their own kind when they &#8220;act White&#8221;.  Unfortunately for them that means showing any kind of civilized behavior.  Still, Whites need to develop an analogous outrage for their own good.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s funny that these black magazines, Jet, Ebony, Essence, that often have no whites on their pages, and who knows about the payroll, they&rsquo;re the first ones to complain about there not being enough non-whites here or there. Wonder what they&rsquo;d think about Ivory magazine? Wonder what they think about American Renaissance.</p>

<p>Is there a list of things that aren&rsquo;t offensive to blacks?</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t AR report on another row concerning this magazine photo shoot that was supposed to celebarate blackness?</p>
<p>Does anyone remember the Afro-Pick photo:</p>

What would they think about a white-oriented  magazine called &#8220;Pride&#8221;?<br>
It would surely be condemned as &#8220;racist&#8221; and &#8220;white supremacist&#8221;.<br>

<p>I am willing to bet that such a publication would be ranked right up there by the U.S. government with such publications as the Anarchists Cookbook which would surely get you flagged by the secret ACRONYMS (CIA, FBI, NSA, SPLC, NAACP) and others</p>

<p>Claudia Schiffer is a Professional Model.  She goes where she is told to go and wears what she is asked to wear (within reason).</p>
<p>Rhule&rsquo;s beef is with Karl Lagerfeld.  Having said that, I do not understand her beef.  All I can see is she is attempting to create a monopoly for black models with regard to any photos involving black issues/subjects.</p>
<p>Is this a back-handed way of saying black models cannot compete with white models?  And if that sentence is true, would Rhule please tell us why that is.</p>

<p>There was some talk show on TV that had the ONE MAN who still does a minstrel show give a demonstration. Well, you can just imagine the negative reaction that this guy received. I was surprised he was not mobbed and beaten right on camera.</p>
<p>But this is correct. I would think very few folks even know what a minstrel show is.</p>

<p>Your comment put a smile on my face because that&rsquo;s exactly what these people are saying.  Claudia Schiffer&rsquo;s look doesn&rsquo;t even resemble a black woman.  If she were wearing one of those rubber fat suits under her clothes, fake nose and lips with a big weave, then maybe they&rsquo;d have something to beef about. She looks more like a 70s icon such as Berndette Peters. </p>

		<p>The photo of Claudia Schiffer is obviously more of a retro statement (note the 80s shoulder pads and 70s fro) than anything else. If it offends blacks in the fashion industry, then they are free to take a black model, use makeup to alter her appearance, and dress her as a retro white. </p>

		<p>Clausia Schiffer is a <b><i>German </i></b> model, photographed by a <b><i>German</i></b>  photographer,  appearing in a <b><i>German </i></b>magazine.<br>
Hence, should that be considered surprising?</p>
<p>How many black models are working in Germany?  How many German models are working in Nigeria?</p>

		<p>This is almost as bad as most black comedians and most black sitcoms unrelentingly making fun of white people.</p>
<p>If black comics couldn&rsquo;t make fun of white people they would have no act to perform.</p>
<p>Turn off all black shows and all black influence, let the truth be known.</p>
