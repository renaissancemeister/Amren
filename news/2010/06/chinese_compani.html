<h1>Chinese Companies &#8216;Rent&rsquo; White Foreigners</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lara Farrar, CNN, June 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In China, white people can be rented.</p>
<p>For a day, a weekend, a week, up to even a month or two, Chinese companies are willing to pay high prices for fair-faced foreigners to join them as fake employees or business partners.</p>
<p>Some call it &#8220;White Guy Window Dressing.&#8221; To others, it&rsquo;s known as the &#8220;White Guy in a Tie&#8221; events, &#8220;The Token White Guy Gig,&#8221; or, simply, a &#8220;Face Job.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it is, essentially, all about the age-old Chinese concept of face. To have a few foreigners hanging around means a company has prestige, money and the increasingly crucial connections  &mdash;  real or not  &mdash;  to businesses abroad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Face, we say in China, is more important than life itself,&#8221; said Zhang Haihua, author of &#8220;Think Like Chinese.&#8221; &#8220;Because Western countries are so developed, people think they are more well off, so people think that if a company can hire foreigners, it must have a lot of money and have very important connections overseas. So when they really want to impress someone, they may roll out a foreigner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or rent one.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The requirements for these jobs are simple. 1. Be white. 2. Do not speak any Chinese, or really speak at all, unless asked. 3. Pretend like you just got off of an airplane yesterday.</p>
<p>Those who go for such gigs tend to be unemployed actors or models, part-time English teachers or other expats looking to earn a few extra bucks. Often they are jobs at a second- or third-tier city, where the presence of pale-faced foreigners is needed to impress local officials, secure a contract or simply to fulfill a claim of being international.</p>
<p>&#8220;Occasionally companies want a foreign face to go to meetings and conferences or to go to dinners and lunches and smile at the clients and shake people&rsquo;s hands,&#8221; read an ad posted by a company called Rent A Laowai (Chinese for &#8220;foreigner&#8221;) on the online classified site thebeijinger.com.</p>
<p>It continued: &#8220;There are job opportunities for girls who are pretty and for men who can look good in a suit.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>White women are also a hot commodity, sometimes to pose as phony foreign girlfriends, or, in the case of Vicky Mohieddeen, to pretend to be an oil tycoon.</p>
<p>Mohieddeen, who is Scottish, took a job in 2008 to attend what she describes as some sort of &#8220;oil drilling conference&#8221; in Shandong province for 300 yuan ($44). Several busloads of foreigners, with nationalities ranging from Pakistani to Nigerian, were trucked to the event, she said. They were greeted by brass bands and feted with a sumptuous dinner.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was like, &#8216;Yeah, we have a lot of oil in Scotland.&rsquo; I didn&rsquo;t know what to say. It was a bit nerve-racking. We were guests of honor of the vice mayor. We were put in a nice hotel. It was quite fancy.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The same thing goes on at American companies, but for different reasons. American companies have to meet the quota of black employees or face the wrath of multiple govt. agencies. But like the Chinese, American companies want the blacks to make an appearance, but don&rsquo;t touch anything, so they park their tokens in departments where they can&rsquo;t affect profit and loss, like human resources or shipping and receiving (only if they have a good loss prevention dept though)</p>

		<p>This was a tactic used in the late 1980s &amp; early 1990s by Chinese and Vietnamese businesses in Manhattan. Gangs like the Ghost Shadows, Flying Dragons and BTK (Born To Kill) would routinely shake down neighborhood shops for goods, services and protection money. So the businesses got smart and started hiring Whites as &#8220;front men&#8221;  &mdash;  even if it was just to run the registers. This worked because (1) Whites were more apt to call the police without fear of retaliation, (2) Whites could speak fluent English and tell the police what happened and (3) Whites getting robbed/assaulted was a higher police priority.</p>

		<p>WOW! White faces are in demand in China too? This very day we read the same thing about India, but that article made it seem like it was a phenomenon peculiar to that country only! Now it appears that white faces are in demand everywhere! I wonder why? </p>

		<p>I taught English in Seoul, Korea. Blond hair and blue eyes was desired for employment as a teacher. Okay, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>However, White brothers and siters  &mdash;  don&rsquo;t sell your souls and become cutiepie dolls for rich foreigners anywhere. Maintain your pride. They desire you and your presence because God has blessed you with an inarguably superior attractiveness. But don&rsquo;t sell yourself to foreigners who are not your equals. He who provides your bread may lord it over you, and your soul may pay.</p>

		<p>When I lived in  Japan in late 80s and early 90s<br>
I witnessed this first hand&hellip;Japanese and other Asians have a weakness for Westerners,esp blue eyes and blond hair<br>
You could make a decent living just having the right look and smile<br>
regardless of any real talent or skills you possessed<br>
As India and China are reaching the same levels of prosperity as Japan we are witnessing a similar phenomena..mmm perhaps I should make the move back to Asia soon before I lose all my  hair  and before I need to wear those prescription glasses!         </p>

		<p>I suppose blacks and liberals are going to complain and accuse the Chinese preference for whites over blacks over &#8220;stereotypes&#8221; and &#8220;lies of white supremacy&#8221;  (funny how blacks hate whites, yet can&rsquo;t stop following us around everywhere we go)</p>

		<p>While I know there will be liberals out there who&rsquo;ll cry foul and throw the white privilege card, these types of hiring are strictly business related.</p>
<p>Like it or not, Westerners are afraid of Chinese goods as a result of shoddy quality.  As a counter, the Chinese will hire these &#8220;whites for hire&#8221; simply to use these excuse of &#8220;look everyone!  We&rsquo;re not a Chinese firm.  We&rsquo;re a multi-national firm as evidenced by this random white guy&#8221;.  </p>
<p>As noted by a previous poster, its the same as Abercrombie and Fitch having to employ token blacks to ward off accusations of &#8220;racism&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I find it hard to believe these Asian business men are paying young blond white women large fees to be fake business partners, clients, etc. without some element of prostitution occurring.</p>
<p>It might sound like easy money but there wouldn&rsquo;t be much you could do if a politically connected Chinese businessmen with Communist party ties decided to rape you, refuse to pay you, sell you into sex slavery etc. </p>

		<p>My first thought was something along the lines of: &#8220;Oh how the mighty hath fallen&hellip;&#8221;.</p>
<p>Kind&rsquo;ve like a Roman circus bringing back all the strange and exotic beasts to die in venations in the Arena, with a white man on a leash the Chinese can effectively say: &#8220;See?!  See!?  Not all they&rsquo;re cracked up to be are they?&#8221;</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s not the motive now, as America continues it&rsquo;s face slide into mediocrity (and China holds the IOUs) it will become that way.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t understand the comments from self-hating whites who are claiming this is similar to whites showcasing blacks.  The last comment above comparing this to the Romans and their freak shows goes a little too far.  As of right now it looks like the Chinese do this to make themselves look good. It looks like they admire whites.  We can&rsquo;t predict how much things will change&hellip;..maybe the Chinese won&rsquo;t come out on top&hellip;.we really don&rsquo;t know yet.  Stop bashing your own race the way you do.</p>

		<p>I realize the practice of using these American sterotypical men as window dressing is probably a little wack but my son (who fits the mold to a tee) is going to China to study for a semester before graduating college in Spring. He REALLY needs the money so I hope he can find a situation in the city that he will be in so he can get a few bucks while he is there!<br>
You have to take the opportunities that you are given.  It&rsquo;s not like anyone in this country will hire him to fill a quota.<br>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad someone else picked that up too, so I wan&rsquo;t only the only one.  I sensed a strong odor of something fishy throughout the article, although nothing  (of course) was explicit.  But you could use your imagination. </p>
<p>This is not unusual in Asia, where sex is treated as part of business, and they don&rsquo;t have the same puritanical hang-ups as Westerners.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good time girls&#8221; don&rsquo;t sound like they&rsquo;re limited to serving drinks and just chatting with the guests.  I wonder if more is expected. And the fact that their pay can vary so widely also suggests that those willing to do more will earn more.</p>
<p>Also, why such an emphasis on their looks?  Anyone can pass out business literature or serve drinks. Even a homely person.  Why not males?  Wouldn&rsquo;t it seem more normal to have a 40-year old man as a &#8220;business partner&#8221; than a 20-year old girl?   Very fishy.</p>
