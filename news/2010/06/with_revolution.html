			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jana Winter, Fox News, June 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Standing in front of a wall-to-wall mural featuring a who&rsquo;s who of revolutionaries, including Ho Chi Minh, Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, and boldly displaying the motto Patria o Muerte, Venceremos!!! (Fatherland or Death, We Shall Overcome!!!), a group of teachers, students, parents and community activists in the Los Angeles Unified School District gathered last month for an unusual field trip  &mdash;  to Arizona, to protest that state&rsquo;s controversial immigration law.</p>
<p>A video posted on YouTube shows LA social studies teacher Jose Lara interviewing teachers and students on May 28 at the headquarters of an organization calling for a Mexican revolution on U.S. soil. Soon after he shot the video, many in the group left for an overnight &#8220;freedom ride&#8221; to Phoenix to protest what Lara tells the camera is a &#8220;racist and outrageous&#8221; law.</p>
<p>Four days later, the school board president implored the superintendent of schools to ensure that students in the district be taught that Arizona&rsquo;s law is &#8220;un-American&#8221; and Jim Crow-like. The law, passed in April, empowers law enforcement officials to question the immigration status of people they think may be in the country illegally.</p>
<p>Lara, who made the video, teaches at the Unified School District&rsquo;s Santee Education Complex with Ron Gochez, another social studies teacher who came under fire last month after he was identified making incendiary remarks in a widely circulated YouTube video that shows him speaking at a 2007 rally for La Raza, a revolutionary group calling for Mexican revolt inside the United States.</p>
<p>In that video, Gochez referred to Americans as &#8220;frail, racist, white people, and to California as &#8220;stolen, occupied Mexico.&#8221; The video&rsquo;s posting led to a groundswell of anger and a flood of calls for Gochez&rsquo;s firing, but a school district investigation found him fit to continue teaching history to public school students.</p>
<p>Both Lara and Gochez are active in numerous revolutionary groups, including Union Del Barrio, a La Raza organization that Gochez helped establish across the street from Santee High School.</p>
<p>In the video shot before the trip to Arizona, students, teachers and others are seen gathered at the Union Del Barrio meeting hall and cultural center in Los Angeles, called Centro Cultural Francisco Villa  &mdash;  a nod to one of the leaders of the Mexican Revolution  &mdash;  where wall murals picture revolutionary leaders  &mdash;  including Ho Chi Minh  &mdash;  holding machine guns.</p>
<p>Beside portraits of the revolutionaries is a hand-painted rendering of the famous and long-living revolutionary motto: Patrio o Muerte, Venceremos!!! Popularized by Fidel Castro during the Cuban Revolution, it&rsquo;s been used by Latin American leaders including Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and Evo Morales of Bolivia, who declared it the official motto of his nation&rsquo;s army three months ago.</p>

I watched the video and noticed that many of the people involved were overweight if not obese.</p>
<p>Remember the health care bill? Remember the emphasis on preventative measures, specifically fighting obesity?</p>
<p>As for these events, how much more direct do these people have to be to show Americans that they are involved in a &#8216;revolutionary struggle&rsquo; to take the American west?</p>
<p>If this isn&rsquo;t our 21st century Fort Sumter, what will be?<br>

<p>Really, that pretty much says it all!</p>
<p>A pack of Communists were allowed to use children as pawns, in advocating for the genocide of white people and the destruction of this country. The vile  wretched murderers: Ho Chi Minh, Fidel Castro, and Che Guevara, were not &ldquo;revolutionaries,&rdquo; but Red terrorists; just like this mob of psychopathic bandits that are described by the ever multiculturally correct FOX News as: &ldquo;a group of teachers, students, parents, and community activists,&rdquo; are the same.</p>
<p>Even worse, is the fact that FOX &ldquo;fails&rdquo; to point out that La Raza is given taxpayers&rsquo; money to fund their &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; activities. Of course, what else would you expect from a network that once employed Geraldo Rivera as a &ldquo;investigative reporter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p> This is what it has come to: Pass the 1965 &#8220;Favor the Dark Masses&#8221; immigration &#8220;reform&#8221; law; deliberately look the other way as millions of Mexicans cross the Rio Grande to take advantage of our hospitality (and our naivete, apparently) and depress the wages of Americans by working cheaply; and seek to paralyze with guilt any Caucasian American who protests such conduct, by screaming &#8220;Racist!&#8221; and &#8220;Bigot!&#8221; and &#8220;Xenophobe!&#8221; at him.</p>
<p> The statements by the leaders of this misbegotten &#8220;protest trip&#8221; make their views crystal clear: California is &#8220;stolen Mexico&#8221; which will be taken back in due course when enough illegals have flooded into it to overwhelm the &#8220;Anglos&#8221; there; Arizona&rsquo;s law is &#8220;un-American&#8221; and &#8220;Jim Crow-like;&#8221; the United States should not be allowed to police its own borders.</p>
<p> The fear and loathing displayed by these Mexican leftists toward Arizona and the example it has started setting the rest of the country is, by their lights, entirely understandable: &#8220;The Anglos are starting to wake up! They are starting to actually defend their country! We must nip this movement in the bud before it spreads!&#8221; </p>

		<p>If this is taking place now, what is it going to be like in 20 years?  This is the question I believe Whites are NOT asking themselves right now.  They&rsquo;re too busy running from their previous neighborhood or even their previous state.  They seem to always believe that all they have to do is just move to another neighborhood or another city or even another state and all will be well.</p>
<p>There is going to come a time when they&rsquo;re going to have to turn and fight and if they don&rsquo;t they&rsquo;re going - we&rsquo;re going - to die.  The sooner we all realize this fact and the sooner we turn and fight, the better off we&rsquo;re all going to be.</p>

		<p>This is excellent news! Just as with Blacks, all that shows(and vividly so)the hopeless divide between Whites and non-Whites is good for our people! And while the noxious presence of Marxists is notable and predictable, most of these brown invaders don&rsquo;t know Trotsky from Tinkerbelle - this is about race and ethnicity far more than ideology&hellip;though in this case, the two go hand in glove!   </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m so disappointed with white Americans.</p>
<p>General MacArthur&rsquo;s generation would never have stood for this outright defiance of law and order and treason and sedition.  What&rsquo;s wrong with us?</p>
<p>White Americans do not have an adequate grasp of the level of irresponsible behaviour they&rsquo;re exhibiting in allowing this effrontery to continue.  It&rsquo;s about 30 years past time that they start realizing that, unlike the Mexicans, WE don&rsquo;t have another country to run to.  America is the wall of civilization, and our backs are against it now.</p>
<p>These barbarians are NOT going to be content with coexisting with us, once they&rsquo;ve gotten control of the state.  Coexistence is NOT an option.</p>

		<p>Che Guevara has been all the rage for some people,during the last twenty years or so. Never mind the fact that this former finance minister of Castro&rsquo;s government, sometimes shot little children, as their parents were forced to watch. Yes, these are the type of murderous people Los Angeles Schools teach as being role models, hero&rsquo;s even.</p>
<p>But this stuff isn&rsquo;t new in Los Angeles, Southern California. I clearly remember way back in 1972, how the present Mayor of Los Angeles, Antonio Villaraigosa, then known as Tony Vilar, was an instigator and vandal at UCLA, (University of California at Los Angeles) for &#8220;Chicano Power&#8221;. These activities and these basically Mexican &#8220;revolutionary groups&#8221; have a long history in California but theyh didn&rsquo;t have much backing because the Mexican/Latino demographic back then wasn&rsquo;t very significant yet in California, believe it or not. Right up until 1970, eighty percent of Californians were Caucasian!! Now there are at most, forty percent Caucasians. It&rsquo;s a mess that without a doubt, is only going to get messier. Already, it&rsquo;s impossible to get some laws passed, if they conflict with Mexican interests. </p>
<p>Concluding thought: Oh, what a valuable lesson California could be on the effects of the, mainly Mexican demographic invasion, if only Americans everywhere in the U.S. became aware of what has happened to California. The State of California is the laboratory, the experiment is finished, and the results are in for what, massive, unregulated immigration from a foreign third world culture will do to a State that was once the envy of other states in the the U.S. and famous around the world.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s beginning to look like the movie &#8220;Red Dawn&#8221; with the late Patrick Swayze may be a little more prophetic than first realized&hellip;with Whites being kept in fenced areas as depicted, except for the Quislings among us.

		<p>This is the folly of imperialism. While the armies are out spreading he gospel of capitalism and materialism and feminism the enemy is invading the porous borders and spreading their own gospel. These are failed cultures that blame us for their dysfunctional societies. It&rsquo;s not us however and they know it. </p>
<p>As long as whites creat societies that others envy then the others will have an ideal that they can&rsquo;t live up to. If these masses of humanity blacks, Mexicans, Arabs etc. can destroy our culture then they no longer have to examine their own failure. </p>

		<p>&#8220;LA Hispanic school teachers tell students California was stolen and Arizona law is un-American&#8221;</p>
<p>Come-now, that must be what the white teachers say, anything else would be &#8216;insensitive&rsquo;. Not blaming whites properly for all problems in the world is &#8216;insensitive&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s not a great idea for whites to inhabit a sort of &#8216;racelessness&rsquo; in a society obsessed with race&hellip;</p>

<p>You can imagine the uproar if I, Bon stood up and publicly screamed:  &#8220;mexicans are a low IQd, parasitic blight on Native Born White population of the United States!  These leeches break in demanding Free White Money and the right to drive drunk on American roads!  </p>
<p>My teaching license would be pulled, I&rsquo;d be fired within an hour and the ADL would demand I be brought up on charges of racial incitement, hatred and Hate Speech and paraded around publicly for a Show Trial  &mdash;  that is if I&rsquo;m still alive by the end of the day.</p>
<p>Yet this racist is allowed to continue to teach in an American school.</p>
<p>Does this not show the state of deterioration in the state of California?</p>
<p>Does anyone doubt these hateful people plan genocide for Native Born White Americans when we Whites become a voiceless, powerless minority and non-Whites completely control the government?</p>
<p>Here is your chance to rate this racist.  You don&rsquo;t have to register and can even write a comment as to how you feel about this hateful seditionist, paid a salary by White American taxpayers in a school supported by White taxpayer money, teaching children, many of them foreign-born, who receive a free, White taxpayer-funded education which includes daily free breakfast, lunch (and soon dinner), free transportation to and from school and whose housing, food and medical care is provided by White taxpayers.</p>
<p>Not only that, they receive preferences, college admissions and scholarships over and above the children of those same White taxpayers. </p>
<p>Yet these ingrates call us White taxpayers Nazis, racists, weak, frail and genocidists while continue depend on us.</p>
<p>They think they have it so bad now, living &#8216;racist, unjust&rsquo; America?</p>
<p>Just wait until we&rsquo;re gone.  Then they&rsquo;ll receive a real lesson in genocide, anarchy, murder and mayhem.</p>

		<p>&#8221;..stolen occupied Mexico&hellip;&#8221;.</p>
<p>1)  If a group of people win a piece of land in a war&hellip;.it is theirs&rsquo; fair and square.  It is impossible to &#8220;steal land&#8221;.  Otherwise every other country in the world had best give up some land also.</p>
<p>2)  The native people who were in the Southwest are NOT the same natives of Mexico today, and they probably didn&rsquo;t think too highly of the natives of Mexico either.</p>
<p>3)  The &#8220;Mexicans&#8221; we fought for land were none other than pure white Spaniards.</p>
<p>4)  What do they want?  Do they just want the piece of land&hellip;.or do they only want this piece of land because it has been modernized and furnished by whites.  Do they think that once they themselves take over, that the nice neighborhoods with large yards, the shopping malls, the banks, the nice hospitals, etc&hellip;.will still be so nice?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Calling for a Mexican revolt inside the United States&#8221;. </p>
<p>It think that has been the plan all along. Revolutionaries are often just pawns in a larger plan. The plan is to take over the whole darn country but not by Mexico, a Mexican revolt would just be an excuse to declare martial law and do away with any and all freedom. </p>
<p>After the revolution in Russia, Cuba and even Vietnam people were trying to get out of the country because they got a lot more than they bargained for. </p>

		<p>As long ago as 1910 Mexicans were only 2.1 percent of California&rsquo;s total population. They then comprised just 48,391 persons. In 1848 Los Angeles only had a total population (not all Mexican) of 3,000. In reality the vast and overwhelming bulk of Mexico&rsquo;s traditional population had no real connection to California or the rest of the southwest. </p>

Skip, My night school teacher asked that question and non one did know&hellip; So I let it go on just long enough for her to think she was going to enlighten us, then I replied in a bored monotone, &#8220;UHhhh, It`s how you pronounce Benedict Arnold in Norwegian&#8221;&hellip; My snack bar side kick was impressed and I had to tell him I`d known that since I was six years old. The teacher also started to let me read &#8220;Germanic Tribes of The Waffen SS&#8221; during class time as she now realized that her class and her own knowledge was about 12 levels of skill below mine. <br>
   It also brings to mind an outdoor friend I have who always knows what type of insect, butterfly or beetle is underfoot. He told me, &#8220;Timmy when you were a kid studying Africa Korps camoflauge schemes on Me-109s, I was doing the same thing with Harvest Beetles!&#8221;  To each his own I guess.</p>

		<p>Quisling, It been part of the political vocabulary here for as long as I can remember and it the word came up in my sons schoolwork years ago.</p>
<p>But back to the main topic is all just another instance of both biting the hand that feeds you or killing the goose that lays the golden egg.</p>
<p>But even more worrying and sad is the following thought. Back in the 60&rsquo;s a whole generation of young American men was destroyed, supposedly protecting the American way of life by fighting the commies and yellow peril in South Vietnam.</p>
<p>You now have a significant force in the Middle East (Significantly mainly White males) fighting for what? In the meantime America is being destroyed from within.</p>
<p>America, what has happened to you and when is the rot going to stop.</p>

<p>He was also a pimp which, at least in my opinion, is one of the lowest life forms on earth. They should definitely be on the endangered species list.</p>

<p>Time to take the ol&rsquo; &#8220;put &#8216;em back in their place&#8221; routine back off the shelf once again (for all the illegals, reconquistas, cultural chauvinists, and irredentists&hellip;sorry, but LEGAL immigrants are off limits in this discussion, because America loves you as much as you would love her!).</p>
<p>The crack in the ceiling is here, led by Arizona&rsquo;s newly passed and just laws, and spearheaded by a willing Governor, Legislature, and heroic Sheriff/Dept. MUCH RESPECT to all of you and to all the wonderful comments/insights posted to this article.</p>
<p>Spanish is the language of American conquests (continental), why all the gushing false pride (-it isn&rsquo;t Spaniard bloodlines sneaking into the USA)? English speaking Americans were never conquered (a REAL source of pride). Huzzah!</p>

&#8220;You now have a significant force in the Middle East (Significantly mainly White males) fighting for what? <br>
In the meantime America is being destroyed from within.&#8221; MB<br>

<p>Fighting for what??? Good question!  Well, to be frank, we don&rsquo;t really know. Nothing is very clear.  Even the government doesn&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s objectives are or when they&rsquo;ll be achieved.  </p>
<p>We&rsquo;re told we have to fight them over there so we don&rsquo;t have to fight them over here. But &#8220;they&#8221; are pouring in over here   &mdash;   while our politicians look the other way.  And while our soldiers are over there.  </p>
<p>Is something wrong in this picture?</p>

		<p>  &#8220;If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, didn&rsquo;t one of those aforementioned Hispanic radicals call for the same thing at that rally in LA about two months ago?<br>
They&rsquo;re the worst enemies we could have on the face of this earth.&#8221;<br>

<p>Rarely do I disagree with Taurus. But I have to doubt that they are our &#8220;worst&#8221; of anything. Bad yes, and annoying, but not the <i>most </i>dangerous enemies we could have.  They&rsquo;d have to be a whole lot more cunning, ingenious, influential, and powerful to qualify for the title of &#8220;worst&#8221;.   Basically, Mexicans don&rsquo;t know what to do unless they&rsquo;re told.  They need someone to tell them. They&rsquo;re puppets on a string, awaiting their master&rsquo;s command.</p>
