			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sara Kugler Frazier, Phoenix Republic, June 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Chief executives of several major corporations, including Hewlett-Packard, Boeing, Disney and News Corp., are joining Mayor Michael Bloomberg to form a coalition advocating for immigration reform  &mdash;  including a path to legal status for all undocumented immigrants now in the United States.</p>
<p>The group includes several other big-city mayors and calls itself the Partnership for a New American Economy. It seeks to reframe immigration reform as the solution to repairing and stimulating the economy.</p>
<p>Bloomberg and Rupert Murdoch, chairman and CEO of News Corp., appeared together Thursday on Fox News to discuss the effort.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The CEOs said Thursday in statements that their companies  &mdash;  and the nation  &mdash;  depend on immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He [Blomberg] has recently taken up the fight again, declaring this week that U.S. immigration policy &#8220;is national suicide.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to solve the unemployment prob in America, you have to open the doors to immigrants who will come here, create businesses, because when the tide comes in, everybody&rsquo;s boat rises,&#8221; Bloomberg told reporters Thursday. &#8220;We need more immigrants, not less.&#8221;</p>
<p>The group&rsquo;s main immigration goals are to secure the borders, develop an easy system for employers to verify work eligibility, hold companies accountable for breaking the laws and improve the use of technology to prevent illegal immigration.</p>
<p>The group also wants more opportunities for immigrants to join the U.S. work force and a path to legal status for all undocumented immigrants.</p>

<p>No, if you want to solve the unemployment problem you start deporting en masse.  These illegal Mexicans aren&rsquo;t creating jobs other than pushing around carts selling ice cream and that doesn&rsquo;t require extra employees nor are they reporting taxes.  What kind of bizarre idiocy is this?  Our unemployment rate would about 4 percent if these alien interlopers were shown the door.</p>

		<p>What the mayor ignores is that the new breed of immigrant is far different from the immigrants that actually built the country. Our country closely resembles the countries where the original immigrants, the Germans, the Italians, the Poles, the English, the French, came from, but there is no evidence that the new breed of immigrant will bring with them the same kind economic boom the original immigrants did, and looking at where they come from suggests just the opposite.  Does the Mayor really want the country to turn into Mexico or Somalia?  How can that improve our economy when we have to spend more on services than what the new immigrants produce?</p>

<p>This is one of the dumbest statements I&rsquo;ve heard. If you have high numbers of unemployment, you don&rsquo;t bring more people in when the people here can&rsquo;t find work. All of these uneducated, unskilled Mexican illegals  aren&rsquo;t creating businesses, they just drive up unemployment and drive down wages, causing more welfare usage and such. Sure, if you handpick a person that is specifically coming over here to open a large business and hire Americans(see Google founder), then yes that could help. However, unless that is the reason and these millions of illegals aren&rsquo;t going to open any business but will simply drive down wages further, put more people out of work and rely on free emergency room care or such causing the taxpayers money, then it will financially sink America. That is what these CEO&rsquo;s want, to create an America where everyone is reduced to serfdom so they(the elites) can fill their pockets.</p>

		<p>These clowns are playing the most dishonest of all pro &#8220;immigration&#8221; games - namely, that there is essentially no difference between legal/legitimate immigration and millions of Aliens invading the country by sneeking across the border, floating up in rafts or over-staying visas, etc! Of course the reality is that America technically doesn&rsquo;t NEED either group at all! This idea that America&rsquo;s success is based upon a steady flow of foreigners is at best an anachronism, or more accurately today, a naked falsehood. Moreover, even when there was truth in that notion, it was only true because those foreigners were White Europeans, not illiterate, uneducated, unskilled Guatamalans, Mexicans, Somalis, Haitians, Hmong, etc!  </p>

		<p>There are 300,000,000 people in this country. We are a long way from &#8220;national suicide&#8221; even we imposed a 100% moratorium on ALL immigration. Besides, who in their right mind listens and takes seriously anything a corporation has to say? They have only one concern: The Bottom Line.</p>

		<p>Of course, we can expect these executives to live in the neighborhoods where the undocumented immigrants live, and send their kids to the same schools, and find their friends in those neighborhoods. When more money is needed for social services to help the undocumented immigrants, these executives will be making up any shorfalls from their personal funds. When studies show immigrants need AA to get the better jobs, these executives will be stepping aside for others to take their jobs. Yes, I&rsquo;m sure this is what the executives have in mind.</p>

<p>Well, here it is in black and white.  The Political tax hounds and the corporate consumer dregs want any kind of immigration, because they foolishly believe it will &#8220;stimulate&#8221; the economy.</p>
<p>Surely, they&rsquo;re either too stupid to dress themselves or they&rsquo;re insane, because what they want will bring this country down even faster.  I could point out that illegal immigration puts a severe strain on the economy, but it&rsquo;s so obvious only someone out-of-touch with the real world doesn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>The states and cities are going bankrupt and these pitiful excuses for humanity think a bunch of raggedy illegals are going to spend enough money to save it?  Surely nobody is THAT dim-witted.  Surely, they have other reasons, like forcing America to break up quicker with an open borders policy and handing out social benefits to newly naturalized illegals.</p>
<p>Take a look at just ONE of about three dozen articles lamenting the growing crisis states are facing due to plummeting revenue:</p>
<p>&#8220;States of Crisis for 46 Governments Facing Greek-Style Deficits&#8221; <br>
 <br>
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/2dtmlg5" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2dtmlg5</a></p>
<p>I could list many other links from so-called mainstream sources, but I think most everyone on here knows the economic situation is continuing to deteriorate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really much worse than this article admits.</p>
<p>Monetizing the debt by printing phantom money out of thin air, backed by nothing, will unequivocally lead to uncontrolled rampant inflation, a loss of credit status down to very serious levels and China, or any other country, will not buy our debt.  That spells Greece right there, but on an even more intense level, because we&rsquo;ll be totally bankrupt.</p>
<p>If this black community organizer is threatened with impeachment for purposely destroying our country, I&rsquo;m pretty sure he will issue a call to arms for a black uprising to keep him in power.  I doubt, however, that it will occur until he has his &#8220;Civilian Defense Corps&#8221; up and running, and it is &#8220;As strong and as well-funded as the military.&#8221;</p>
<p>This evil miscreant is turning out much worse than even I originally feared.  He will be tearing America down, one way or another, just as he&rsquo;s doing right now, but in such a brazen manner even his foolish white supporters will notice.</p>

		<p>Bloomberg is a stupid idiot - albeit a dangerous one - who can be trusted no more with the nation&rsquo;s immigration policy than he can with the Second Amendment. Anyone who believes that an &#8220;illegal gun&#8221; is any gun not in the hands of the police or military, cannot be trusted with the governance of a free people.</p>

<p>Not really so dumb, if you consider what Bloomberg&rsquo;s full agenda is.  You can be sure that he has other interests to serve, cards that are not all laid out on the table for everyone to see.  But he knows EXACTLY what he is doing!  It may not be good for you; but it will be good for him.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s as stupid as a fox!  We&rsquo;d be  naive to think he&rsquo;s going to look out for us.  He has no interest in protecting the American people.  To the contrary!  He and his gang want to destroy it and replace it with a more docile herd of sheep&hellip;(a program that&rsquo;s already well under way, since 1965).</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t give him more credit than he deserves! Without Rahm Emanuel and the rest of the gang that surround him   &mdash;    writing his speeches and telling him what to do   &mdash;   the &#8220;community organizer&#8221; in the White House  would be lost.  He&rsquo;s just a front, nothing more. An articulate, &#8220;educated&#8221; black that they &#8220;discovered&#8221; and spent 20 years grooming for this spot.  Their dream candidate!  But still just a front.</p>

		<p>I read a fantastic book a while ago called &#8220;The Great Mortality: An Intimate History of the Black Death, the Most Devastating Plague of All Time,&#8221; by John Kelly. Highly recommended.</p>
<p>The Black Death wiped out at least a third of Europe&rsquo;s population in the space of a few years. Among other things, this reduction in population led to rising demand for labor, higher wages, improved conditions for the peasants and a general breakdown in the feudal system.</p>
<p>In other words, a REDUCTION in population BENEFITS the working class and HURTS the ruling class. These traitorous corporate elites aren&rsquo;t interested in lowering unemployment. They&rsquo;re interested in LOWERING WAGES. If you want to reduce unemployment, you don&rsquo;t need MORE people. You need LESS.</p>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>Yep.  The only difference is that one has been caught, and the other hasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yet.</p>
<p>Less than just 2 years ago, Madoff was a highly respected member of the business world and a pillar of the community.  Until then, &#8220;The firm was one of the top market maker businesses on Wall Street.&#8221;[Wiki].  Now look at him.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they always keep a bag packed with their passport handy. That&rsquo;s why Blomberg has an estate on tax-exempt Bermuda.</p>
<p>According to the news just this week (6/21/2010), Madoff reportedly funnelled 9 BILLION dollars to three &#8220;personal friends&#8221; before going to prison.  <br>
He&rsquo;ll never starve when he gets out.</p>

<p>The Federal Government, that&rsquo;s who.</p>
<p>As always, follow the money.  Corporations well know the enormous power politicians wield; most are bought and paid for to do their patron&rsquo;s bidding which means keeping up an unlimited flow of low-wage workers. The politicians seek more statist voters so it&rsquo;s win-win for them as well.</p>
<p>The results, of course, are devastating to the White Native Born Population, but then that&rsquo;s part of the plan as well  &mdash;  some say White elimination is THE prime factor for unfettered immigration and amnesty.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Does the Mayor really want the country to turn into Mexico or Somalia?&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Anon #2</p>
<p>Yes.  That will, once and for all, destroy completely The White Establishment and the Native Born White American population and allow implementation of an authoritarian-style/police state government, which the hostile elite in power believe they&rsquo;ll lord over from behind iron gates guarded by an armed militia.  Or, they&rsquo;ll leave the country if things become too violent here after they&rsquo;ve collapsed the economy.</p>

<p>Do you think the major propaganda media outlets will interview anyone from The Heritage Foundation to counter the Blatant, Outright Lies of bloomberg, murdoch, and/or any other pro-immigration advocate?</p>
<p>The sun will go out first.</p>
<p>The Heritage Foundation reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The Obama Administration has worked rapidly to expand the welfare state further.</p>
<p>The growth of welfare spending is unsustainable and will drive the United States into bankruptcy if allowed to continue. President Barack Obama&rsquo;s fiscal year 2011 budget request would increase total welfare spending to $953 billion &mdash; a 42 percent increase over welfare spending in FY 2008, the last full year of the Bush Administration&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Suggested remedies?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The government should not provide amnesty or &#8216;earned citizenship&rsquo; to illegal immigrants, which would provide illegal immigrants with full access to the U.S. welfare system. Of the 11 million to 12 million illegal immigrants in the U.S., at least 50 percent lack a high school degree. Giving this population amnesty and access to welfare would lead to a staggering increase in future welfare costs&hellip;. The cost to taxpayers would be devastating: Social Security and Medicare costs alone would be $2.6 trillion&hellip;&#8221;</p>

		<p>I may well be true that certain immigrants come to the US to create businesses but all those immigrants come legally. The only business those who can&rsquo;t afford to fly in create is police business, it sure keeps them busy. The total and deliberate lack of border control has had one massive effect on business, it has destroyed most unions. The only group that does not and has never employed illegals is government which is why the bulk of union members are now employed by the federal and state governments. The destruction of the unions is not all bad, too many have had such a stranglehold on business that the business could no longer survive, the auto industry is the best example. Whilst business would love to go back to the pre-union days, best described in Upton Sinclair&rsquo;s &#8220;The Jungle&#8221; that no solution either. Unless Unions and Employers can agree to be reasonable, as in Germany where neither has total power it is going to be either one extreme or the other.</p>

		<p>I think it goes far deeper than what you folks are admittedly correct in saying.  Capitalism is like  cancer.  As long as it can achive &#8216;growth&rsquo;, it doesn&rsquo;t kill the function of the organ it starts from.  But as soon as it&rsquo;s contained or gets too large, it eats itself.  &#8216;Growth&rsquo; based on more junk consumerism (Black and Hispanic buying habits are atrocious) buying more goods from overseas slave manufacturing and agro economies ONLY WORKS so long as two things happen:</p>
<p>1.  The increase in distributionist style market processes (from raw material to manufacture to retail) doesn&rsquo;t price the goods right out of sight.  Where &#8216;owning the process&rsquo; through shares is what makes the wealthy for doing nothing; too many processes still wrecks the system with value-added pricing.  Such an expansion in wealth-classes to the point of zero sum gain was a -guarantee- to happen as soon as China was brought in to become our commercial partner.  We have so stretched the market supply chain out so much that, thermodynamically (and $$$ or Yuan are just labels for work product value) it is no longer possible to sustain a useful energy in : work out ratio in our bloated economic conditions.</p>
<p>2.  You maintain stature as a self-enabled manufacturing economy.  What this means is that you don&rsquo;t spend 20 years sabotaging American wage standards, across the board in the professional classes, with H-1Bs at 1/4 the market salary rate or offshore outsourcing.  Because holding that standard of living up internally is what HOLDS THE DOLLAR VALUE ON THE MARKET.  Since, with _employed_ U.S. citizen engineers and tradesmen, anyone who doesn&rsquo;t want to make some profit on the U.S. consumer markets by selling cheap, can stuff themselves as we do it on our own anyway.</p>
<p>Of course the latter is what is such a farce here.  Do you -really think- that companies like these:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hewlett-Packard, Boeing, Disney and News Corp.&#8221;</p>
<p>Are going to be hiring unskilled laborers to build 787s, laptop computers, million dollar theme park rides or to write copy in a language they can&rsquo;t speak?</p>
<p>Not Damn Likely.</p>
<p>We are approaching a point where we can no longer use the capitalist method of fractional reserve loans to artificially inflate the economy and create mass-industrial solutions to &#8216;growth&rsquo; as wealth enablement or societal evolution.  </p>
<p>Economically, we cannot compete, cheap enough, to wage a labor war with the likes of Mexico and China, using human labor.  </p>
<p>Environmentally, we -do not- want to pass China &#8216;going the other direction&rsquo; headed towards a billion person population roll.</p>
<p>The resource consumption issues will NOT be sustainable in a &#8216;globalist&rsquo; society trying to match what we have (to make the Elites even richer) there just isn&rsquo;t enough of anything to even try at these population levels (which is why white birth rates were tapering off long before the current crises).</p>
<p>We really need to make some massive changes in the way we perceive the work ethic vs. the human-cost one on a yearly basis of how many watt hours/calories/tons waste we consume and produce.</p>
<p>We need to acknowledge that, as society becomes more sophisticated, the cutoff point on IQ where we can all participate in increasing low-manpower, high-tech, industries is going to keep climbing away from the middle class without serious genetic therapy to raise the common bar.</p>
<p>What we -cannot do- is succumb to the notion that more unskilled labor from more strangers with huge families to feed is in any way helpful to this process of backing away from capitalism for it&rsquo;s own sake.</p>
<p>If you want to make an unskilled laborer that can do stoop work for competitive rates, DO IT.  With a robot.  That is never paid a dime of salary at all.  Then give half it&rsquo;s human equivalent wage levels to a common social pool that guarantees food, shelter and living standard X for ALL AMERICANS.  In trade for a _much smaller_ society.  And a move away from currency driven value systems (barter is better because it is more flexible.).</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t destroy the gene pool, culture and sustainability of our nation just to leverage some numbers on a meaningless GDP chart.  We are the Elites&rsquo; placemarker index.  The look, the IQ baseline and the cultural commonality by which they can outbreed without dumbing down their own genetic legacy or social compatibility.  We need to emphasize that LOYALTY between kin as a mean to restructure our entire society.</p>
<p>Not invite foreign, low IQ, low assimilative value, wage slaves, in to further drive a wedge between us.<br>

		<p>Personally, I believe in &#8220;managed capitalism&#8221;. It&rsquo;s great for companies and individuals to make a profit based on their ingenuity and drive, however business should not be allowed to go against the interests of the country at a whole. There has to be a balance. First and foremost,  each nation must do its&rsquo; own work with its&rsquo;own people and create on its&rsquo; own using its&rsquo; own resources and population and skill. Then nations can trade with each other fairly and based on mutual interests. Business however should not allowed to have destructive policies, such as outsourcing and insourcing, since business fuels the economy and that is a huge part of a county&rsquo;s interest. Companies should be allowed to outsource or build factories overseas ONLY if there is a shortage of American workers and they need more. Foreign workers should be allowed in legally ONLY if there is a genuine shortage and these foreigners should be allowed to work, say for 5 years, and then must go home. On the other hand, government must make it a very business friendly climate, low taxes for businesses and make it as cheap as possible for businesses to operate, which presently, the government makes it much more expensive for businesses to operate here.</p>

		<p>Well, concerning Mayor Bloombergs fear of what will happen to the U.S. economy if illegal aliens are deported, or even not given Americans jobs, is easy to explain. You see, Bloomberg has said in the past that Americans are &#8220;stupid and lazy&#8221;, and &#8220;if illegal aliens are deported from New York City, who will take care of the golf courses?&#8221; Clear? What a joke Mayor Mike is. I recently read an article by former Mayor of New York, Ed Koch, in which he supported border enforcement and a total halt on illegal immigration. Americans seem to have a talent for constantly electing people who are dead set on screwing them.</p>

<p>&gt; Yes, and now we Americans are finally getting the idea of what caused the Russian Revolution and the rise of Communism.  Don&rsquo;t think that it could happen again and happen here?  Well, history doesn&rsquo;t repeat itself - exact, it repeats itself in cause and effect.  We have the causes and likely effects in a much more potent mix this time.<br>

<p>That is so true. I wrote the orignal comments about Bloomberg being stupid. I was corrected by others who said he has a specific agenda and he is not stupid. I(I&rsquo;m a 28-year-old single woman) also have dated guys and when I bring I up the fact that Whites have interests and should protect those interests by bring in non-White labor, you wouldn&rsquo;t believe the grief I get from White guys.

		<p>Here&rsquo;s an excerpt from a recent conference by the Center for Immigration Studies from Stephen Steinlight:</p>
<p>&#8220;It is absurd to argue that the immigration policy good for our grandparents and parents  &mdash;  who migrated to a fundamentally different America, an industrial colossus needing countless unskilled, semi-skilled, and skilled workers and with a largely empty continent to fill  &mdash;  still makes sense in a post-industrial knowledge-based economy with a modern welfare state&hellip;</p>
<p>Contemporary low-skill immigration (especially illegal immigrants, a large majority of whom don&rsquo;t have high school diplomas and 30 percent haven&rsquo;t finished ninth grade) threatens to re-barbarize American capitalism, destroy the social safety net, and create a permanent underclass. </p>
<p>Immigration is a zero-sum game in some respects, and low-skill immigration has brutal consequences for the most vulnerable Americans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sadly, many people are conditioned to say the &#8220;we&rsquo;re all immigrants&#8221; line, blah blah. Pat Buchanan once said in a speech: &#8220;How many immigrants should we allow in this country each year and who should those people be?&#8221;</p>
<p>Paul Craig Roberts once said: &#8220;We exporting jobs and importing poverty&#8221;.</p>

		<p>In my opinion, the passage of a &#8220;path to citizenship&#8221; measure would actually make little difference.  The bills proposed always call at least for English proficiency, payment of fines,  and a clean criminal record.  Many of the peasant illegals barely or don&rsquo;t speak English, have rap sheets, and won&rsquo;t be willing or able to pay fines.  The government could even consider their illegal presence in the U.S. as the crime that it is and tell them they have to return to their native countries to apply (which some proposals do mandate).  <br>
Both the Democrat and Republican leadership pay lip service to an immigration bill, but apparently don&rsquo;t really want it.  For different reasons, both want a status quo situation.  The Dems have boxed themselves into a position  &mdash;  of their own making  &mdash;  in which they will be branded racists if they oppose all-out immigration, and the GOP wants cheap labor.  Big business, of course, wants the latter.  None of these groups actually expect an immigration bill to pass, so they can pay all the lip service they want.  Then, if it does pass, it will make little or no difference.  Most illegals, already getting a free ride as to welfare, medical care, legal services, Spanish-speaking authorities, and the disregarding of their status by law, will just continue to exist as they already do. </p>

		<p>The truth of the matter is that it takes a lot of poor people to support a few rich people. </p>
<p>If you ever go into a rich neighborhood you will see why all these immigrants are needed. The homes of the rich are built by cheap immigrant labor, the maids are cheap immigrant labor, the landscapers are cheap immigrant labor and if you go to where they make the money to fund this cheap immigrant labor ( their businesses) you will find more cheap immigrant labor. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to be super rich in a society where people get a fair wage and living standard. In a society that uses slave labor it&rsquo;s easy for a few at the top to become very wealthy. </p>
<p>The rich will tell you that they are needed for society to work but just try one simple experiment. Put a rich man and a poor man that knows how to work on a deserted island and see which one survives. </p>
<p>The rich can only survive on the labor of the poor and that&rsquo;s why they need immigration. </p>

<p>Correct, Paul.  I live in such a neighborhood, and I can confirm  that you are exactly right. That is the standard point of view, the accepted, &#8220;received&#8221; orthodoxy of all  &#8220;good and decent people&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s expected of you and taken for granted. It&rsquo;s the only Right Thinking that&rsquo;s legitimate. This is Liberal Country.  I&rsquo;m the rare exception, I guess   &mdash;   a deviant from orthodoxy!  If I were to express my own opinions openly on such matters, I would be viewed with horror!   Such heresy!!!</p>

<p>Who would raise their kids, walk their dogs, wash their dishes?</p>
<p>Who would hold the door for them?  Goodness!  They&rsquo;d have to do it for theselves. </p>
<p>And, furthermore,  who would provide the wonderful diversity? The Ethiopian, Turkish, and Hindu restaurants? A sushi bar on every corner (where you can show off your chopstick skills). Down the street from me there is a new Mexican restaurant which, now that the weather is warm, is spilling out onto the street with the trendy yuppie crowd.  Make no mistake   &mdash;   this is not a Mexican restaurant for Mexicans.  Oh no!  Few Mexicans could afford to eat there. (There are two kinds of Mexican restaurants, you see.)  This is a &#8220;Mexican&#8221; restaurant for yuppies, all doing their international thing (without having to rub elbows with any smelly braceros). And doubtless feeling very good about themselves. (While Maria finishes the housecleaning back home.) A couple of tequilas plus a chimichaga or burrito, and they&rsquo;ve done their good deed for the week. They are virtuous people.</p>

<p>The long term solution though is going to be much harsher.  Because people like Bloomberg are not self-sustaining.  In order to prevent their areas from collapsing, they MUST have the federal government take from arizona in order to give to NYC.  And the federal government is falling apart before our eyes.</p>

		<p>The singularity was predicted to happen circa 2030. For those who believe in the theory by then the IQ situation should be resolved through genetic manipulation. In the meantime, as one of the posters above insinuated, it is not economically or environmentally sound to try to stuff the country as full as possible with laborers. We will have enough people to do the jobs that need doing.<br>
If you don&rsquo;t think a singularity will happen, but rather that humanity is going to stumble along as usual, forever, then it really doesn&rsquo;t make sense to import more dumbbells. I just read  that the biggest purchase in the history of Illumina, a California biotech whose products are used in the genetic testing field, was done by Chinese researchers. They are actively trying to take a eugenic leap. What is so disturbing about the American leadership class is the short timeline they have. It is as if thinking a mere decade or two out is too much to ask.<br>
Maybe this is all just nightmare stuff and maybe we will pull through without any big problems. But I have my doubts because we owe the Chinese so damn much money we simply must factor in what they are doing.</p>

		<p>At one time I was mildly amused at the New World Order secret policies for the eventual unraveling of this country.  Now, I don&rsquo;t know if there isn&rsquo;t another explanation for such seemingly irrational behavior by Bloomberg, et al.  Is it that there is only so much room in the future ruling cabal of what will be left of this country?  And that a Bloomberg along with CEOs will be in that group, as participants in helping alter the makeup of the American Race.  It does seem to explain what one would have thought years ago to be psychotic behavior.</p>
