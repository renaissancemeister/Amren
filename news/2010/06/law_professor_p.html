			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kashmir Hill, Above the Law, June 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last week, we told you about the William Mitchell College of Law professor, who traveled to Rwanda to help with the defense of a political leader running against the incumbent president. He was arrested soon after his arrival because of his &#8220;genocidal ideology.&#8221; He allegedly violated Rwanda&rsquo;s laws against minimizing the 1994 genocide in which more than 500,000 Rwandans, mainly ethnic Tutsis, were killed.</p>
<p>Erlinder [Law professor Peter Erlinder], who previously defended a Hutu during the International Criminal Tribunals in 2003, contends that it&rsquo;s inaccurate to blame just one side for what happened. That got him locked in the Rwandan slammer, along with the opposition leader he went to Kigali to defend. During interrogations last week, he fell ill, leading to his hospitalization. Erlinder&rsquo;s wife says he needs his blood pressure medicine. His daughter told us she&rsquo;s hoping the State Department will intervene.</p>
<p>He pleaded not guilty to the genocide-denial charges during a hearing on Friday, but the Rwandan judge decided today to turn down Erlinder&rsquo;s bail application.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} On Friday, Erlinder was officially charged with &#8220;denying Rwanda&rsquo;s 1994 genocide and publishing articles that threaten the country&rsquo;s security,&#8221; according to the Associated Press:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Erlinder&rsquo;s lawyers asked that bail be granted because of his health   &mdash;   he has blood pressure problems and wants to return home to seek treatment. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Rwandan judge was not convinced that Erlinder&rsquo;s failing health has anything to do with his imprisonment. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Law professors (at least the non-clinical ones) aren&rsquo;t known for their prowess in the courtroom. We hope Professor Erlinder fares better in the Rwandan court.<br>

		<p>Why should we care about him?  He&rsquo;s the kind of enemy White Elite who does more harm than good.</p>
<p>Let his misery serve as an example to other Whites:  Always let Africans solve their own African problems in their own African ways, as nature allows.</p>
<p>Cannibals? Then let them feast.  Warriors? Then let them war.  Gang bangers? Then let them bang.  Keepers of the real? Then let them keep on kepp&rsquo;n it real.</p>
<p>As is Africa, so are Africans.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a civil rights lawyer, and therefore, our enemy.  Any civil rights lawyer who is not spending all their pro bono time as an activist to have the illegality of the 14th Amendment and the Brown v. Board brought to the fore, is always our enemy.</p>
<p>May he rot in Rwanda.</p>

In his name, I pledge to spend this evening continuing to Transcend Diversity.   You too. And you.</p>

<p>Is he Building Bridges? </p>

		<p>White nationalists should have ABSOLUTELY NO SYMPATHY for Peter Erlinder. A harsh punishment at the hand of the Rwandan government would be one of the all-time greatest instances of poetic justice the radical left has ever suffered.</p>
<p>Peter Erlinder is a professor at a law school here in the Twin Cities. He hates white people viscerally. He defends black copkillers and is basically Bill Ayers without the bombs.</p>
<p>Most recently has been behind an effort to allow American Indians unlimited fishing and hunting rights in OFF RESERVATION waters and forests. In effect, tribe members would not be restricted to any fishing limits or seasons that apply to white Minnesotans on state (not reservation) waters. They could use modern (white) technology such as gill nets, fiberglass boats, depth finders, etc. to decimate the fish resources in state waters. Some of these same tribes fished walleye in Red Lake (the second largest lake in the state) to total collapse. The state footed the bill to restore the walleye population there after closing the entire lake to walleye fishing for several years. Red Lake is 80% reservation waters (netting) and 20% state waters (rod and reel). Draw your own conclusion on who caused the collapse. Anyway, Peter Erlinder thinks these tribes should be able to do the same thing on almost ALL northern Minnesota waters simply because they are not white.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t shed a tear for Peter Erlinder no matter what happens to him. </p>

		<p>Not long ago I watched the 1964 Jean-Luc Godard film &#8216;Band of Outsiders&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In one scene, a character is reading a newspaper aloud.  &#8220;Unimaginable horrors from Africa&#8221;, he quotes, &#8220;the Hutus have risen up and massacred 20,000 of their taller Tutsi masters, sawing their legs off to shrink them down to size&#8221;.</p>
<p>The tribal conflict between Tutsis and Hutus has been flaring up for decades, though rarely acknowledged.  The 1996 episode is getting milage as &#8220;the Rwandan genocide&#8221;, but in fact the massacre was just one of many in the normal cycles of inter-tribal competition.</p>

They get what they deserve for being so foolish.  Why not defend some poor white person accused of a &#8220;hate crime&#8221; like &#8220;cotton balling&#8221; or &#8220;Walmart announcing&#8221;?<br>

		<p>I really hope they release him. Our spineless government probably wouldn&rsquo;t lift a finger for him, but you never know. At least this will help to show people how corrupt and dangerous Africa is, for those few people who still seem to think that Africa just needs &#8220;more capitol&#8221; or &#8220;economic training.&#8221; Yeah right, the only thing that will save Africa is an eternity under the good old-fashioned Euopean colonial empires.</p>
<p>But yes this poor, ignorant liberal will be in my prays.</p>

<p>excerpt:</p>
<p>&#8220;Professor Erlinder is a frequent litigator or consultant, often pro bono, in cases involving the death penalty, civil rights, claims of government and police misconduct, and criminal defense of political activists. He is also a frequent news commentator.&#8221;</p>
<p>Translation: Professor Erlinder is a hard core Egalitarian and Liberal who enjoys masquerading as a civil rights hero.</p>
<p>Now, he finds himself convicted, imprisoned, and dying in an African prison after he ventured outside the make-believe fantasy world that he and those of his ilk exist in and force others in society to endure. </p>
<p>In a nutshsell, Erlinder pranced over to Africa in a misguided civil rights escapade, and now an Africa judge is clubbing him over the head with a strong dose of reality! Good riddance to Erlinder. He is just where he needs to be. I hope many of his friends join him soon!<br>

		<p>This guy deserves the Amy Biehl Award for Liberal Stupidity. Why doesn&rsquo;t he complain to the Rwandan Human Rights Commission about his treatment? </p>
<p>Maybe a Rwandan shaman will help him with his high blood pressure, by giving him yohimbe to smoke.</p>
<p>If Erlinder thought that the USA judicial system is unfair, I&rsquo;d say he&rsquo;s had the cloth whipped away from his face.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see if the Obama regime gets this guy released from jail. Maybe Obama will have to grease his Rwandan soul brother&rsquo;s palms to do so. I hope not. </p>

		<p>Never heard of Erlinder until this,but after researching him I believe that if the Rwandans keep him it will be no loss to America. <br>
This man is a radical-chic lawyer out of the 60&rsquo;s whose entire life has been dedicated to aiding any anti-American activists that come along. </p>

		<p>The longer Mr. Erlinder stays there, the less damage he can do here.  C. Pete, welcome to the real world.  Liberal rhetoric will get you absolutely no where in this African gutter country.  Idea: why not show the cannibals your law degree license, your transcripts, your certifications, other licenses and liberal memberships, your ultra-liberal utopian publications, etcetera, etcetera, etc.  Expound and expand on how you hate your own (European Americans/Europeans); talk about how the European American/European is the epitome of evil.</p>

<p>You may want to rethink that position. Consider the type of White people that comrade Erlinder was likely defending. They are the Egalitarian types who believe that Rwanda, Africa should be a diverse, multicultural paradise. The truth is that Whites have no business in Rwanda, Africa and they are getting <b>exactly</b> what they deserve.</p>
<p>Jeez, for the last time&hellip;</p>
<p>Blacks belong in Africa, Whites belong in Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand, Asians belong in Asia, Indians and Pakistanis belong in India and Pakistan, Native Americans belong on reservations, Latinos and Hispanics belong in Central and South America and the Caribbean countries, and Muslims belong in Arabia. How hard is this to understand?<br>

		<p>I hear this guy is being charged because of his publications and conferences in which he denied genocide against Tutsi never happened. He is not being charged for denying genocide in his capacity as ICTR defense lawyer. His out of court publications imply that Tutsi were not victim of genocide by Hutus but that it was the other way around; in other words Hutus were victims of genocide by Tutsi minority&hellip;so all these images of babies cut to pieces by machetes were just an invention by Kagame&hellip;it didn&rsquo;t happen! right??? This guy is the most sadistic man I have ever had the misfortune to know&hellip;he make me sick. He has no sympathy whatsoever to nearly thousands and thousands of children, women and men who were murdered in cold blooded mass murder while the world stood by. If Kagame ill equipped militia had not managed to overthrow the genocidaires there would be no Tutsi left in Rwanda. This so called liberal leftist does not even care about a quarter of millions tutsi women who were raped during genocide. I hope he rot in Rwandan jail. If he is ever granted bail he should be forced to visit all genocide memorial sites as part of bail condition; maybe then he will show some kind of humanity if there is any left in him. Every right minded person should thank Rwanda judiciary for not allowing world leftist terrorist sympatisers to rewrite Rwandan bloody history.</p>

		<p>Looking  at  things  objectively if  Erlinder  had  travelled  to  Germany  and  publicly  &#8220;denied  the  Holocaust&#8221;  he  would  also  be preemptorily  arrested  and  jailed.  It&rsquo;s  German  law.</p>
<p>Erlinder  may  indeed  have  a  point  though.  The  so-called  &#8220;Rwanda  genocide&#8221;  of  1994  has  been  massively  hyped and  overblown  by the  Western  media.  The genocide  mantra  is  that  Hutu  militias  armed  with  clubs, machetes  and  sticks only were  able,  in  very  labor-intensive  fashion, to  kill  800,000  Tutsis(mainly) in  just  90  days. Just  impossible! </p>
<p>The  Tutsis  were  no  more  than  8%  of  Rwanda&rsquo;s 7 million  population  in 1994,  but  today  they  are some  16%  of  Rwanda&rsquo;s  9 million  population.  The  government  is  Tutsi  run  and  President  Kagame  rules  with  an  iron  fist. </p>
<p>So where&rsquo;s  the  so-called  &#8220;genocide&#8221;?</p>
<p>The truth  is  that  it  is the   German  and  Belgian  colonialists  who  are  at  the   source  of  Rwanda&rsquo;s  ethnic  problem.  It was  the  German  colonialists  who  first  vaulted  the  Tutsis  over  the  Hutus  during  the  German  occupying  period  &mdash;  only  because  the  noses, cranial  measurements  and  height of the  Tutsis were  seen  to  approach a  perceived  European  norm  more.  The  Tutsis  were  rewarded  with  most  of the colonial  perks.  Obviously,  this  would  breed  resentment and  conflict.</p>
<p><br>
No  doubt,  the  Tutsi-led  Rwandan  government  is  afraid  that  if  Erlinder  brings up  real  evidence  in  court  &mdash;  as  he  sought  to  defend a  local  Hutu  politicain  &mdash;  that  the  fake casualty  toll  of  the  so-called  Tutsi  genocide would be  exposed. </p>

		<p>OCCAM, you&rsquo;re full of mugabe if you think the Germans and Belgians are directly responsible for the slaughters in Rwanda and Burundi. The blame goes to the Hutus and the Tutsis. The Tutsis are about 14% of the population in both countries. However, the army and police in both countries are overwhelmingly comprised of the Tutsis; and because of that, that&rsquo;s why the Tutsis wield all the power.<br>
Rwanda and Burundi became independent in 1962, so it&rsquo;s useless to blame the Belgians or Germans for what came after.</p>
