<h1><a href="https://mjperry.blogspot.com/2010/06/medical-school-acceptance-rates-2007.html">Medical School Acceptance Rates, 2007&#150;2009</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Perry, Carpe Diem, June 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Here&rsquo;s a new chart with updated data from the Association of American Medical Colleges on medical school acceptance rates for Asians, whites, Hispanics and blacks during the period 2007-2009, based on various combinations of MCAT scores (24-26 and 27-29) and GPAs (from 3.00 to 3.59). </p>
<p>For example, for applicants with an MCAT score between 24-26 and a GPA between 3.00 and 3.19, only 1 out of every 25 Asian applicants was accepted, compared to about one out of every 11 white applicants, one of out every three Hispanics, and more than half of black applicants with those same credentials.  </p>
<p>Thanks to Walt G. for the help pointing out the links to the data.</p>

		<p>When will we see a stop to these stories?  The tyrannos know that these just cause White Awareness and resentment.  </p>
<p>We should expect soon any story that exposes Diversity Race Privilege for blacks will include lots of quotations from important Whites telling us what a good thing it is to finally be overcoming our shameful past by atoning for the sins of segregation by helping to elevate those people of color whom we have oppressed and marginalized for too long.</p>

		<p>Interesting.  And yet, the point being made by this article (which is never made explicitly clear) seems not to be that mestizos and blacks are being admitted at wildly disproportionate percentages, but that Orientals are being discriminated against. And of course, not a word is breathed of anti-<i>White</i> discrimination.</p>
<p>Presumably if Whites were to be put at the very bottom of the acceptance heap, rather than merely at the penultimate position, there would be no problem.</p>

		<p>Time to give the Blacks their own Hospitals, with 100% black everything, like they tried in LA, &#8220;Killer King Hospital&#8221;. Fund it twice as much so they can&rsquo;t whine about that and make ALL Federal Govt. workers and their families use those and those alone.</p>

		<p>This is nuts.  Is it fair to be physicially injured by affirmative action?  Earlier, it was in the pocket book.  Basically, how lower in standards will they go for hispanics and blacks?  Pretty soon, they will just make them MD&rsquo;s.</p>

		<p>They hired a black doctor at one of the clinics in my area.  He was bossy, mouthy, loud, rude, and he rarely understood anything his patients explained to him.</p>
<p>After the business went down by almost half and nobody was making their appointments with him, the dork doing the hiring finally got the picture and ended his AA program.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m told any patient who goes in for an appointment gets a back slap, a handshake, smiles and overly concerns from Dr. Diversity.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s trying to get back SOME Of the business he lost.</p>
<p>I see him outside his office occassionally and can&rsquo;t help but laugh when he passes by.</p>

		<p>Unlike the White population, the black, browns and yellows are squirting out babies like on a production line.  It only makes sense that all that extra population needs additional doctors.  I wouldn&rsquo;t go see a black doctor or a doctor of any other race, my doctor is German/Austrian.  I find these are the ones that make the best physicians.  I don&rsquo;t think White doctors should be rationed among nonwhites so it&rsquo;s a good idea that they recruit black doctors to help their own people.  The big question is how many will fail Medical School and how many were passed through it to meet some quota.  It really doesn&rsquo;t matter as long as their treating black patients.  Diagnosing syphallus or prescribing HIV cocktails shouldn&rsquo;t be all difficult.</p>

		<p>I agree my brother went to medical school at MGH, Boston. Even back in the late 90&rsquo;s Asian groups such as the Indians, Japanese and Koreans were held to the highest standards along with us whites. However, blacks, Moslems, Hispanics, Arabs and other minorities of the exotic kind were often given a free pass. The aforementioned so called minorities need to be mollycoddled and spoon fed by the liberals who are bringing down this nation. Meanwhile, the schools in the west more so in North America, UK and the socialized nations of western Europe keep pontificating the evil of higher IQ people such as white European Christians, Jews &amp; the Japanese / Asians. While low IQ&rsquo;d Moslems, Arabs, Pakistanis, Blacks and Mestizo thugs are made out to be heroes.</p>

		<p>A lesson in unintended consequences: &#8220;helping&#8221; blacks and mestizos actually ensures further discrimination.  Everyone knows the less intelligent races get an extra &#8220;boost&#8221; so they avoid blacks and mestizos in professional positions like the plague.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just doctors  &mdash;   black and mestizo law students get into great law schools with abysmal grades and LSAT scores.</p>
<p>Warning: NEVER hire a black lawyer and NEVER accept treatment from a black doctor.  Your life, liberty, or money depends on it, so don&rsquo;t trust a brainless husk when intelligent people who have worked hard and actually earned the degree are available.</p>

		<p>My wife is a cardiac care nurse of 20+ years.  She has worked in the highest level care units existing.  There is one black doctor, a surgeon, whom she says is excellent and would not worry about if I had to undergo his surgery, and believe me, she is extremely particular about who WOULD be allowed to work on me.  That being said, he is the EXCEPTION.  And the exception NEVER &#8220;proves the rule&#8221;.  Just because out of hundreds of doctors, ONE black is professionally competent, does NOT mean they all are.  In point of fact MOST blacks in professional positions of any sort are in over their head, incompetent, and knowing they are incompetent, are belligerent any time their short comings are made manifest.  The greatest example of a black in a professional position who is in over his head, stupid regardless his educational credentials, and belligerently black and vicious when his shortcomings are made manifest?  Barrack Hussein Obama.  </p>

		<p>The Asian doctors seem to be discriminated against. Go into a science classroom of suburban high schools or colleges. Who is there? Asians. On the one hand I have no problem with every black or Hispanic( meszito, not white) being excluded from medical school.  On the other hand, Asians both Chinese and Indian have excellent technical and retention skills. But their overall relationships with patients are difficult. It&rsquo;s not a language issue; many Asians speak English well, albeit with an accent in many cases. But they don&rsquo;t seem to care how the patient feels, and don&rsquo;t explore family and psychological factors as  a white, Jewish, or white Hispanic would do.  I would let more Asians into medicine, but keep them in non-interaction specialties like radiology. They seem to like those non-contact specialties anyway. To put it another way, if you have a fatal disease, don&rsquo;t have an Asian as your primary doctor.<br>
And if you have a black doctor, you will have a fatal disease, even if Dr. &#8220;Washington&#8221; is telling hilarious jokes about Magic Johnson and AIDS.</p>

		<p>Why use any black owned or managed businesses?. They all dislike whites (and every other race of people) to some extent. So, do not waste your money, none of them are competent.Some of the benefits of implementing this individual policy:</p>
<p>1. You raise the probability of receiving quality goods/services manyfold.</p>
<p>2. The level of customer service you will receive will be significantly higher.</p>
<p>3. For services requiring entry to your home, you reduce the possibility of having your home cased for a burglary.</p>
<p>4. Using white run/owned businesses can lawfully offset the blatant government (at every level)AA discrimination against white run businesses.</p>
<p>5. You make a positive contribution to white solidartiy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that you all can think of more reasons&hellip;lets hear them.<br>
By the way, i am an american of north west european origin, I want compensation from th Italian government due to the pain i still feel when i remember how my ancestors were enslaved and abused by the Romans. Sounds stupid? so is the black claim.</p>

		<p>In certain situations, it might be advantageous to hire a black attorney:  (1) your case may go to trial in an area that will likely produce a heavily black jury; (2) your children have been snatched by Child Protective Services, and most of the staff of your local CPS is black (the black staff will be more likely to cut a deal with your attorney if he is a &#8220;brother.&#8221;  Furthermore, a black attorney is less likely to hold the naive belief that CPS will drop the case when it realizes that you are &#8220;good parents&#8221; and that &#8220;a mistake was made&#8221; in taking your children away from you; (3) you think your case might be heard by a black judge, etc.</p>

		<p>Blacks are not only admitted through discriminatory policies, they are also graded in the same way (as others have pointed out)</p>
<p>This is from The Affirmative Action Hoax:</p>
<p>Even without conscious intention, Blacks receive much higher grades than Whites for the same work.  Kent Harber (1998) wrote a large number of essays that he filled with errors in grammar and content.  He then asked ninety-two  White college students to act as markers and gave one essay to each, along with a brief description of the putative author, which indicated the &ldquo;author&rsquo;s&rdquo; race indirectly but clearly (e.g., member of the Black Student Union).  The markers&rsquo; average rating (on a one to seven scale) for content of the essays they thought were written by Blacks was 3.5, but 2.7 for the essays they thought were written by Whites&hellip;</p>

		<p>I had a black primary care physician once.  He was actually quite good, but I can also say he was culturally &#8216;white.&rsquo;  There was not a whiff of brotha&rsquo; hip hop jive about him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen black nurses that were like ghetto rats in white dresses (shudders).</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve had mixed experiences.  </p>
<p>I will say that many whites going into med school are not as competant as they used to be and I&rsquo;ve seen a few young bucks in scrubs who acted like frat boys.</p>
<p>To me, the best doctors are those who are over 45 years old, because they are pre cell phone, pre internet, pre video game and pre cable.  They used to read when they were young.  That goes a long way to being the best doctor.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it doesn&rsquo;t quite work that way. You see, for every med school, there is a precise number of admitted students, in September of each year. No more. More Blacks and Mestizos, means less Whites or Asians. That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And, no, diagnosing SYPHILIS and treating AIDS, are not so simple things!</p>

		<p>To poster #16, you are so right!</p>
<p>I had a Chinese doc for about 4 years.  (HMO assigned me to him.)  He had an accent, but his main problem was that he didn&rsquo;t seem to have a clue about anything that was happening around him.  He didn&rsquo;t ask questions beyond a simple list, never probed, never dispalyed anything even resembling a badside manner and overall a visit to him was like talking to cardboard.</p>
<p>On another occassion when I was taking my child to see his doc, I witnessed an east indian female doctor actually berating an old white woman patient for asking questions.  It was ugly and the &#8216;doc&rsquo; was rude and haughty and said, &#8220;Don&rsquo;t waste my time!&#8221; before storming off.  The poor old white lady looked so sad and dejected and shuffled out of the office area.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s never mentioned that whites lose out to non-whites, as noted above. What gets little attention is that when whites are put head to head with an Asian, and the white has equal or even slightly better credentials, the white will lose. With our enemies controlling the media and academia for so long, it&rsquo;s surprising any whites are left who care enough about school to put in the work to get into Medical School. </p>
