<h1><a href="https://www.insidehalton.com/news/article/839438--is-burlington-too-white">Is Burlington Too White?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ken Peters, Metroland Media Group (Ontario), June 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The problem is, Burlington is too white.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also too white on city council.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s too white on virtually every single city citizen committee and board.</p>
<p>The 12-member Burlington Inclusivity Advisory Committee, which identified the problem, hopes to change that.</p>
<p>The committee presented six recommendations to the community service committee Wednesday that aim to make Burlington&rsquo;s movers and shakers more diverse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Burlington is a white community. Very white. Snow white,&#8221; said committee chairperson Ancilla Ho-Young.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is not to say we don&rsquo;t have people of all kinds of nationalities living in Burlington but they are invisible. They are not in the forefront, we do not hear from them. Our city council is not representative of the community it serves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Burlington&rsquo;s seven-member council is comprised of six men and one woman. None are a visible minority.</p>
<p>Advisory committee vice-chair Brian Heagle noted the irony.</p>
<p>&#8220;This (report) is going into the valley of the beast. It&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re saying, &#8216;We&rsquo;re asking people to change and by the way, we&rsquo;re asking people to change you (councillors),&rsquo;&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But veteran Burlington Councillor Jack Dennison wonders what all the fuss is about.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t see it as broken. Anyone is free to put their $100 down and run for council,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Dennison said in the past the various city boards and commissions have virtually accepted anyone who has applied.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can lead a horse to water but you can&rsquo;t make it drink,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Ho-Young, president of the Burlington Caribbean Connection, said the city&rsquo;s ethnic numbers are growing. But that ethnic population is not reflected on city boards, committees and commissions, she says.</p>
<p>Ho-Young said her committee wants to encourage those bodies to actively seek out potential members from ethnic backgrounds.</p>
<p>The committee&rsquo;s recommendations include;</p>
<p>* Require all publicly-funded city boards and citizen committees to have diverse representation that reflects Burlington&rsquo;s community demographics, starting with the Burlington Performing Arts Centre.</p>
<p>* Create a database of possible diverse committee members.</p>
<p>* Hold educational workshops on how women, seniors, youth and newcomers to Canada can successful run for city council.</p>
<p>The report is the product of the May 1 Civic Engagement Forum. Ho-Young said her committee is not just trying to increase involvement of visible minorities but also women, people with disabilities and representatives from the gay and lesbian community.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want Burlington to be inclusive and listen to everyone and include everyone,&#8221; she said, adding the committee has fielded many complaints that city hall is not user-friendly. &#8220;If you are from a different background and you go to city hall, if you don&rsquo;t speak English, you&rsquo;re in trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ted Hildebrandt, director of social planning with Community Development Halton, said 2006 Canada Census figures indicated that Burlington was home to 15,700 visible minorities, representing about 10 per cent of the city&rsquo;s population.</p>
<p>And more than one in five Burlington residents were born outside Canada. That&rsquo;s higher than the national average of 19.8 per cent.<br>

		<p>This thing starts out as if it were intended as comedy&hellip; was going to make that my comment but decided not to (good chance it might have been dropped) but I got to the end and he says, &#8220;more than one in five Burlington residents were born outside Canada. That&rsquo;s higher than the national average of 19.8 per cent&#8221;.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t &#8216;one if five&rsquo; pretty much 19.8%?</p>
<p>This man is bursting with humor.  <br>

First of all, why is this a problem?  Oh, and according to my auto-spellcheck, inclusivity isn&rsquo;t even a word and exclusivity is one of the spelling suggestions&hellip;hmmm.<br>
Why is the Burlington Caribbean Connection even involved?  The black population is much lower than the Asian population (black ~1.5% and SE Asian&Chinese; ~4.5%); if they really want to represent their demographics, then shouldn&rsquo;t the Asians be up in arms rather than the Caribbean blacks?</p>

<p>The only reason that Ho-Young would mention such a subject is because she&rsquo;s an anti-white racist. That&rsquo;s quite obvious to anyone with with even half-a-brain.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve got a question for the Burlington Inclusivity Advisory Committee. Many Toronto high schools now have a policeman posted during the school day. This would have been shocking back in the days when Toronto was white; the way Burlington is now. The police were brought in after many incidents of violence at the schools. Many people feel police should have been brought in sooner. My question for BIAC is - what school monitoring and democratic process do they propose so that police will be brought in before major problems begin?</p>

		<p>A &#8220;snow white&#8221; town means diversity.  If it were like everyplace else, then it would be uniform, and no one would notice the difference.  If the goal is to have diversity, some places should be all black, some all white, and so forth, plus some mixed.  This is an all white one.</p>

		<p>Diversity = No White People</p>
<p>Black people are the battering ram for diversity.  East Asians will sneak in behind them while everyone focuses on the headline grabbing stuff black people do like daily murders, gang activity, and parental neglect.  Make no mistake East Asians want control of the government of Burlington so they can flood the city with illegal East Asian immigrants to work in East Asian businesses and to not enforce Canadian environmental, tax, employment and health laws.  In five years, you&rsquo;ll go fishing and catch an unfamiliar fish.  Turns out it&rsquo;s from East Asia brought over as a food item for an East Asian restaurant.</p>

		<p>Too white? It sounds like a dream come true. Who decided, and when exactly was it decided, that multi-culturalism is the best possible social condition? I think that Brown Vs. Board of Education was the darkest (pardon the pun) moment in 20th century American history, followed by the insane civil rights legislation of 1964 and the Darkie Immigration Act of 1965. May we all have sweet dreams tonight of a picturesque, crime-free, prosperous, Norman Rockwell and Waltons Mountain White Utopia. </p>

		<p>After clicking &#8220;original article&#8221; above and reading their comments section, I could have easily been mistaken in believing that I was reading AmRen commentary. </p>
<p>Canadians were actually dropping the pretense of p.c. and voicing an opinion that actually means something without the usual hand-wringing platitudes that seem to prevail during these Orwellian times. </p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Burlington is a white community. Very white. Snow white,&rdquo; said committee chairperson <a href="https://www.insidehalton.com/opinion/editorial/article/605403--black-history-month" rel="nofollow">Ancilla Ho-Young</a>.</i> 
<p>Burlington, Ontario is just west of Toronto along the north shore of Lake Ontario. These <a href="https://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/prof/92-591/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=CSD&amp;Code1=3524002&amp;Geo2=PR&amp;Code2=35&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=Burlington&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=35&amp;B1=Custom&amp;Custom=28000" rel="nofollow">demographic figures</a> show the city of 162,000 is <b>90% white</b>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been recently rated one of the top five best cities to live in Canada, but Ms. Ho-Young apparently is not happy living there, so the obvious solution to that problem&hellip;is to move! </p></p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m watching GMA about the town of West Dundee Illinois and The Best Block in America.  I suspect the entire town is White. Neighbors help each other, everyone is friendly. It looks like a  Norman Rockwell dream town full of nice, attractive and articulate Euro- Americans. I did see one woman who appeared to be Asian.<br>
 As I sit here, a sudden sadness overtakes me. Someone in the town entered it into the Best Block contest. I forsee the imminent destruction of this town when someone decides that it&rsquo;s TOO WHITE. Next thing will be an influx of South side Chicago inhabitants supported by Section 8.<br>
If only the person who nominated the town had considered the almost certain consequences. All towns like W. Dundee need to stay well under the diversity radar.</p>

		<p>A town full of nothing but whites? Wow.  What horror.  Imagine the &#8216;pain&rsquo; and &#8216;uncomfortable feelings&rsquo; blacks have going there when a white stares at them, says &#8220;have a good day&#8221;, or doesn&rsquo;t give them a job.  It&rsquo;s far, far, FAR worse than the millions of whites who have been beaten, robbed, raped, or killed by blacks since the Civil Rights movement.</p>

		<p>I bet I can convince my husband to start helping me pack for the move in under 3 minutes! This is what my neighborhood was like 50 years ago, when I was a kid. When I tell young people about living in an all-white community (crime rate, sleeping outside in the summer, playing without parental supervision from after breakfast to before dinner, everyone knowing everyone else and watching out for kids and pets, etc.) their mouths drop open. I&rsquo;m so nostalgic, I&rsquo;m teary-eyed. sigh. </p>

		<p>I would think that in Canada, it&rsquo;d be Native Americans who&rsquo;d have the right to say something about an area being &#8220;too white&#8221;. I am WASP myself and a lifelong metro Atlantan who has been to CN 6 times, the last one in &#8216;94. I love that country and have pleaded previously on this site that those of you who are Canadian not allow your wonderful country to go the same route ours has.</p>
<p>My sister just returned from a week in Vancouver and felt quite safe  &mdash;  no wonder, as that city&rsquo;s crime rate is much lower than Atlanta&rsquo;s. It has a lot of Asians, as opposed to blacks and Hispanics. I mean no offense, but that&rsquo;s reality. </p>

		<p>It dosen&rsquo;t matter whose on city council.  There are more and more muslims and immigrants in burlington, I saw a bunch of them today at &#8220;Canada Day&#8221; celebrations.  Mississauga and Brampton are close by and they are completely brown,muslim, indian, seik, and they are creeping into Burlington.  Mississauga and Brampton are lost territory, lost without a shot.  Eventually, Burlington will be too.</p>

		<p>To poster #20.  </p>
<p>You are so right.</p>
<p>I live in a mostly non-white area in an urban area (Asian mostly) but there are housing projects and subsidized apartments nearby and thus the ghetto is around the corner and but three blocks away.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t let our children out of the house and even are apprehensive when they go to the fenced in backyard because of all the shifty young Latino men that walk by, the weird Asians who look like they belong to the Asian mafia and of course the blacks who sometimes pass by.</p>
<p>When I tell my kids of my childhood they are also in wonder.  The campouts in the yard at night, the ability for little kids to play in the streets or down the street by themselves, the lack of crime and garbage, the &#8216;knowing your neighbors&rsquo; thing.</p>
<p>One of my kids constantly asks if we can move to a place like that.  I&rsquo;d love to, but there are no jobs there and blacks have recently started moving into my formerly all-white wonderland.  It&rsquo;s so sad.</p>
<p>(I&rsquo;m only where I&rsquo;m at because there are great job opportunities in urban areas where competent whites are needed to care for helpless minorities who cannot take care of their own social and educational needs.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found that most young Whites just don&rsquo;t believe it. I get comments like, &#8220;No, it&rsquo;s not possible that young teenage girls then weren&rsquo;t having a lot of sex,&#8221; or &#8220;Are you sure there wasn&rsquo;t as much child abuse and pedophilia? Maybe you just didn&rsquo;t hear about it in the news,&#8221; or &#8220;What do you mean you were taught to pull over and take a nap if you got sleepy while driving? Are you crazy?&#8221; or &#8220;What do you mean there was no crime? We&rsquo;ve always had a lot of crime,&#8221; etc., etc., etc. </p>
<p>Being raised in a multicultural place this is all they know. They&rsquo;ve never lived in a sane White world.    <br>

		<p>At first glance, I thought this article was about Burlington, Vermont, USA.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The racial makeup (as of 2000) was 92.27% White, 1.78% Black or African American&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>These &#8216;too White&rsquo; American cities are prime targets of the US refugee industry  &mdash;  key locations for the  &#8220;leading refugee source countries for the U.S. program&hellip;. Iraq, Burma, Bhutan, Iran and Somalia. The program has gradually shifted towards the resettlement of refugees from Muslim countries&hellip;. The Muslim component&hellip; is  up to at least 40% and is set to rise from here.</p>
<p>The Obama administration is committed to increasing the refugee quota&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Refugee Resettlement Watch:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Medium size towns, such as Nashville, TN  (65.9% White), Ft. Wayne, IN (75.45% White), Boise, ID (92.15% White) and Manchester, NH (91.75% White), are serving as the main reception centers for the refugee program&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>As for Nashville TN and Ft. Wayne IN, I wonder if refugees are being settled in White parts of town?   After all, Somalis fled Atlanta for Maine because their children were being harassed by local blacks in the schools.  And, in Maine, the welfare benefits are better and attacks on White easier:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Reports have come into the Police Department. Witnesses and investigators say swarms of Somali boys, some as young as 8, others in their late teens, overwhelm solitary victims through sheer numbers.</p>
<p>Often, these gang members carry sticks and rocks with which to intimidate their victims. There are often four or five of them, sometimes as many as a dozen. Typically, they threaten or beat their victims until they give up the goods: money, bicycles, cell phones, prescription drugs, or other items of value&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine a more undesirable people to foist on Native Born White Americans than Somalis.  </p>
<p>The current government hates Native Born White Americans more than one can imagine.</p>
