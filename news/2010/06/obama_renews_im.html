<h1><a href="https://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-obama-immigration-20100630,0,6185729.story">Obama Renews Immigration Push</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Nicholas, Los Angeles Times, June 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It would be a revival worthy of Lazarus, but President Obama is making a renewed push for an immigration overhaul, possibly during a lame-duck session of Congress after the November election  &mdash;  when members would no longer face an imminent political risk for supporting it.</p>
<p>Obama met with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus in the State Dining Room on Tuesday and discussed a strategy for passing a bill that had seemed dead for the year.</p>
<p>On Thursday morning, the president will put the issue before the American public. In a speech at American University, he plans to make the case for providing a path to legal status for the estimated 11 million people who live in the U.S. illegally while strengthening border enforcement.</p>
<p>White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said at his daily briefing Tuesday that &#8220;this continues to be a very important national issue&#8221; requiring Republican support. To date, no Republican senators have agreed to back a comprehensive immigration bill. Nor has such a bill been introduced in the Senate.</p>
<p>Obama &#8220;can&rsquo;t sign something that doesn&rsquo;t exist,&#8221; said one person who was at the White House meeting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Latino lawmakers who have criticized the White House for neglecting immigration said they were pleased.</p>
<p>Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez (D-Ill.), who was part of the Hispanic Caucus meeting with Obama, said in an interview: &#8220;He&rsquo;s going to speak to the nation on Thursday and tell the country why it&rsquo;s important to have comprehensive immigration reform. That&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ve been demanding of this administration.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Voting on an immigration bill in a lame-duck session has some advantages in proponents&rsquo; eyes. Outgoing members of Congress would have little reason to fear backing a controversial bill. And those who won might be more likely to support it, since they wouldn&rsquo;t have to face voters for another two years  &mdash;  when Obama is up for reelection and likely to draw progressives to the polls.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Raising the issue anew allows Obama to mollify his Latino supporters. But it also puts Republicans in a tough spot. Neither party can afford to write off a Latino community whose influence is growing.</p>
<p>Forcing a vote on immigration would give Republicans a difficult choice: They could vote against the bill and risk antagonizing Latinos, or vote yes and invite the wrath of &#8220;tea party&#8221; activists and other conservatives opposed to what they view as amnesty for illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In another move likely to please Latino voters, Obama&rsquo;s immigration enforcement chief, John Morton, issued a memo Tuesday ordering his agency to focus on deporting criminals and those who pose a national security threat, rather than on pursuing people such as &#8220;immediate family members of U.S. citizens&#8221; and those caring for children.</p>

		<p>I think I know what the White House/Democrat strategy will be on immigration through the rest of this year:</p>
<p>1.  No omnibus &#8220;comprehensive&#8221; bill.  Too much blow back, and a signing ceremony would look too bad in terms of PR.</p>
<p>2.  No executive order &#8220;parole.&#8221;  Wreaks of despotism in the minds of enough crucial voters.</p>
<p>3.  They&rsquo;ll try to salami slice their way to a &#8220;comprehensive&#8221; bill, a la Johnny Cash stealing the car one piece at a time.  They&rsquo;ll tuck one provision after another after another deep down hidden in unrelated larger bills.</p>
<p>4.  ICE will simply refuse to act upon referrals from states and localities that have 1070-like laws and ordinances. </p>

<p>We&rsquo;re in the midst of so many chaotic conditions going on at one time it&rsquo;s diffuclt for some people to believe that this jerk would concentrate on lesser matters that aren&rsquo;t even close to be a pressing need, unless, of course, they&rsquo;re sharp enough to see the community organizer&rsquo;s agenda to reduce the white power structure and promote blacks is the only thing of any real importance to him.</p>
<p>If he can be stopped like old Dubya was, it would be the best victory we could achieve right now.</p>

		<p>This bill to let in more hispanics by annesty will be the last nail to finish this country off.  The flood of third world peoples will submerged this country once and for all.  The destiny of an affirmative action president will have been fulfilled  &mdash;  the destruction of an advanced civilization.  Perhaps, the whites can re-band together and re-start another civilization in the distant future, hopefully, in a much wiser matter.  But in the near future, the Chinese will step in to fill the power vacuum left by the whites.  The Chinese will be forced to address the racial issues which includes selective breeding that the whites presently have refused to address out of guilt, loss of will power, courage, and energy.  These issues were addressed by the whites in the past.  </p>

		<p>A black caucus? A Hispanic caucus? Are blacks and Hispanics so different from Americans that they need special, privileged, exclusive groups to represent them?<br>
 <br>
If Hispanics or blacks vote as a bloc and act as bloc, doesn&rsquo;t that prove they really don&rsquo;t understand the whole concept of &#8220;America&#8221;? Doesn&rsquo;t that tell you something about how they would govern the country? If you think about it, it&rsquo;s hard to believe what is taking place, we have 2 skin color based groups, embedded with in congress, each lobbying for special privileges for their respective groups, at the expense of Americans. </p>
<p>The latest result of this race lobbying is the Financial reform bill. This bill contains the most aggressive afro-action program ever, along with even more CRA-style requirements for minority lending, which is what prompted the need for reform in the first place. This is all thanks to Maxine Waters, a house conferee, and head of the Congressional Black Caucus. </p>
<p>When do we get an American caucus? Or more importantly, a white caucus.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m so sick of hearing the 11 million nonsense. They&rsquo;ve been saying that for 20 years. How about 30 million? There are 11 million in California alone. We already have a pathway to citizenship, it&rsquo;s called going through the legal immigration process. Anyways, you can bet that if Mexicans voted Republican, Obama would be screaming would have the national guard on the border and be screaming for all these rules to keep them out.<br>

		<p>This whole thing is nothing more than a sideshow for the hispanic voters so they&rsquo;ll turn out in November.  The Democrat Party is so seriously fractured that &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221;, aka amnesty, will only happen with the help of RINO Republicans.  With middle America having largely abandoned the neocons, I don&rsquo;t see anything happening for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>I want to know why a group of people need who are voting citizens of this country need to be &#8220;mollifed&#8221; by having amnesty granted to people who have committed a  crime by violating our borders. <br>
Several years ago the government spent considerable time prosecuting La Cosa Nostra/Mafia/ THe Mob. I don&rsquo;t recall any politician who was fearful of offending the Italo- American community by prosecuting criminals who in comparison with Mara Salvatrucha. los Nortenos, Latin Kings etc were a bunch of pansies.<br>

		<p>This promise, like many of Obama&rsquo;s, is nothing more than a sop to the pro-illegal forces.  The lame duck session, starting after the Nov. elections, will include legislative time off for the Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year&rsquo;s holidays.  Would Congress even have time to get this measure out of committee, let alone passed by both houses?  Even a non-controversial bill would have a very difficult time beating such a timeline.  And, after the first of the year  &mdash;  as Obama has made clear  &mdash;  the Dems won&rsquo;t have the votes to get such a measure through the House.  Neither major party wants such a bill to pass.  If it did, the specifics would still demand that illegals pass tests (including criminal background) and pay fees and fines.  What kind of bureaucracy would that take for 20-30 million people?  And most of the illegals, in my opinion, won&rsquo;t bother to learn proficient English or pay a cent.  They have a free ride right now.</p>

		<p>I guess the &#8220;undocumented democrats&#8221; are ready at the starting line to rush over the border and be counted as brand new citizens as soon as the magic wand is waved. </p>
<p>We know for a fact that the border will never be secure - that&rsquo;s the one thing the government can&rsquo;t do. They&rsquo;ve told us often enough. So, now, the millions here will suddenly start waving little American flags, speak English, become model citizens and hurry down to whatever office is responsible for bringing the rest of their large familie here.

		<p>DO NOT ACCEPT THIS, AMERICANS! </p>
<p>Defeating this amnesty-fest can be a huge Victory for true American Justice if we stand against diabolical Obama and the democratic demons. The devil is a master at putting on a victim&rsquo;s face, a protruding pouting bottom lip, and adopting a pleading tone as he appeals to the bleeding hearts of White Americans who hate themselves because they have been taught to hate themselves. The devil will promise that we will all feel so warm and fuzzy and we will have Peace on Earth if this travesty passes. </p>
<p>For every White American kid  &mdash;  whose people built this Great Nation  &mdash;  who is now homeless, sleeping on the street, whose father is out of work, whose parents can&rsquo;t afford to buy her new shoes, whose school district is broke because it has to kowtow to foreign invaders &hellip; AMERICANS, YOU FIGHT THIS! If we lose this one, the defeat will be tremendous both in terms of dollars and, more imporatantly, our sense of sovereignty and American Exceptionalism. God has blessed us for centuries now. Do not let the Devil steal your God-granted gift, that is, YOUR NATION. </p>

<p>White Raven,</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly why he doing it.  Because WE (the people who built this society)ARE preoccupied with all the chaotic situations. They&rsquo;re creating a vast, uneducated, primitive underclass that will be the majority population over whom the commisars will rule.<br>
White Americans are the only people they fear because we&rsquo;re thinkers for the most part.</p>

		<p>I think you people are all wet.  No offense but when you make this racial politics instead of -corporate- politics, you start out on the wrong foot.</p>
<p>Over at VDARE, there have been some persuasive arguments about just how -unimportant- the ethnic vote is and will continue to before another decade or so as long as the ethnics do not register and vote.</p>
<p>Either the voting bloc is always going to be set on the party which, holding the White House and the Congress, can &#8216;out promise&rsquo; them a larger segment of the pie (which is why it&rsquo;s tough to out promise a Democrat at the moment).</p>
<p>Or they won&rsquo;t vote at all because they flat out don&rsquo;t believe in politics and/or are illegals and don&rsquo;t want to register to vote.</p>
<p>In 2004, 8 million blacks did not vote = 32% of total black voting bloc.  Blacks only form 11% of the population as a whole.</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/4g5x5b</p>
<p>2004, Bush didn&rsquo;t win 44% of Hispanics.  And he still won.</p>
<p>https://vdare.com/sailer/041110_poll.htm</p>
<p>So the idea that these political bodies are trying to buy their own guarantee of vote strength is stupid.  Because whoever votes, it&rsquo;s the money that pays for the campaign which guarantees the candidate.  And that&rsquo;s always going to be corporate.</p>
<p>Hence, what will happen is that the people who own the -planks- on which platform the newly reelected or lame duck legislators have been standing will give their wood a little tug and nameless Congressional aides will fast track a joint bill through conferencing for a duck and run vote, sometime just before the holiday break.</p>
<p>And whatever measure or compromise bill gets past the House will be pencil whipped through the Senate and the White House because they are even more firmly bought out.</p>
<p>And the reason Corporate America (as much as that applies in a multinational world) wants this amnesty and indeed the building of a replacement social labor pool in America is simple: Wages.  </p>
<p>Current American wage vestments are something like 32% of the GDP fraction.  The Hispanic element of which, -even with- the illegals is something like .2% because they don&rsquo;t pay taxes and they don&rsquo;t get paid anything like a living wage.</p>
<p>American, private income, taxes make all the transfer payments which amount to the real debit exchange values (Welfare, Medical, Schooling, Housing Assistance) we know make Hispanic cheap labor a total loss for the nation.  But not for the Corporations.</p>
<p>And those major business interests ONLY requirement is to lower overhead by disenfranchising the rest will do so by getting their labor wage through the door, trusting to natural fertility rates and the actuary tables to do the rest.  White America and it&rsquo;s 60% majority is bluntly -old-.</p>
<p>Ethnics screw whites only if we let them.  Whites screw whites only when we catch them.  And if you&rsquo;re not caught, it&rsquo;s not a crime.  Nobody seems to understand that our government DOES NOT WORK FOR US.  It hasn&rsquo;t, in at least 100 years.</p>
<p>What is going to eventually happen is that there will be another tax disputation.  People will stop paying income taxes because the people they support on welfare don&rsquo;t (legal or not) and are not of their extended economic as much as racial caste in undercutting whatever standard of living they have.</p>
<p>At which point, the &#8216;nation&rsquo; (from Latin: &#8216;Nescare&rsquo; to be born, a co-ethnic not political group origin) will have to decide whether there is room for a Constitutional Contestment of the Income Tax based on equal representation as much as legal definition.</p>
<p>Because again, whites haven&rsquo;t been &#8216;equally&rsquo; represented here in a long time.  But you can bet one thing.  When the riots happen, whatever color the hand that closes on a heat gun or a sound gun or some other &#8216;less than lethal&rsquo; suppression of public revolt (Vietnam taught us so much), It will be a white voice that orders the trigger to be pulled.  Because only whites screw each other over like this.</p>

<p> The Mafia has always had about 4000 &#8220;made men&#8221;. They are totally dwarfed in comparison to the Hispanic gangs, who have hundreds of thousands of members in the United States, Central America and Mexico. In fact, the Mexican Narco-Terrorists have thousands of members armed with military weapons. Six mobsters were gunned down by Alphonse Capone in the Saint Valentine&rsquo;s Day Massacre &mdash; that many people (many non criminals) are killed in one day by Mexican drug gangs. The brutal, ultra-violent Hispanic gangs make Al Capone look like a dignified philanthropist in comparison. </p>
