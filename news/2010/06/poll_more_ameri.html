<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Arizona anti-immigration law has been beset by boycotts and demonstrations, yet a new poll suggests more Americans may want one just like it for their state.</p>
<p>According to a new Quinnipiac University poll, 48% say they want their state to pass an Arizona-style immigration law.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, according to the same poll, 45% feel that the Arizona law will lead to discrimination against Hispanics.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fifty-three percent of white voters were in favor of the law, while the poll indicated 43% of blacks opposed it, along with 52% of Hispanics.</p>
<p>Men were more supportive of the legislation than women, with 55% of males agreeing with it, while only 42% of women sided with the law.</p>

		<p> The blacks have a survival sense that tells them if brown hispanics are given amnesty and the vote, the new rulers won&rsquo;t enforce black over White policies.  They won&rsquo;t tax Whites for the benefit of blacks. They won&rsquo;t enforce Affirmative Diversity Action Race Privileges for blacks at the expense of Whites.  </p>
<p>Hispanics will be all for Hispanics.  They believe that they actually own large parts of the territory of the United States of America.  Once they get their hands on the legal machinery of the territory through immigration reform, amnesty, and the vote, they will become a majority that cares nothing about the welfare of the blacks and continued racial profiling of Whites for the benefit of blacks.</p>
<p>Hispanics will treat blacks with no respect, and that scares the blacks.  Whites are too timid and surrendered to notice the difference.  As long as the ruling White elites can caucus with the browns  instead of the blacks and keep themselves at the top with the mass of Whites on the lowest rung, then all will continue as usual.  The only difference will be that the Whites will not be lower than two non white groups- blacks and browns.</p>
<p>White standard of living will decrease by multiple factors for every factor of one that the blacks and browns increase in material well being.</p>
<p>Whites must find a way to force the White elite race and nation traitors to experience the race dispossession and posterity degradation that has been forced upon the rest of us.</p>
<p>Outlaw private churches, synagogues, country clubs, and schools.</p>
<p>Identify those White elites who run institutions and advocate and advance anything that sounds like &#8220;Diversity is our Strength.&#8221;  Do an investigative audit for how much White Privilege they keep and enjoy for themselves, and then make it all very public.  </p>
<p>Put them on the spot:  &#8220;Do you encourage your daughter to date non whites, or are you silent on the issue and therefore secretly endorse her biased preference for dating her own kind?  Doesn&rsquo;t it embarrass you that your White daughter isn&rsquo;t showing commitment to anti-racism through building a truly inclusive and welcoming Multicultural society? Should she give you only mulatto Obama baby grandchildren? Why didn&rsquo;t you send her to public schools?  Are you scared of the blacks?  Is she?&#8221;</p>
<p><br/>
The first step toward a better reckoning will be to investigate why the White churches and synagogues are not actively recruiting Multiculturalism through Multi-faith outreach and actively integrating their membership with many, many, many non whites.<br/>

		<p>The truth is that 90% of everybody wants ALL immigrants who are criminals or on welfare of any kind, to be rounded up and forcibly deported.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been that way from the very beginning of non-white immigration.</p>
<p>The only reason anti-immigrant candidates aren&rsquo;t immediately voted into office is because they are unavailable.  Neither party allows candidates to run on this issue nor has allowed it in the past to be implemented.  Americans don&rsquo;t choose to implement this on a federal level via our vote because we don&rsquo;t actually have a choice&hellip;.only the illusion of choice.  One party with two heads&hellip;.same people in power and the same agenda no matter who gets &#8220;elected&#8221; or what lip service has been given.  Republicans learned this under George Bush.  Now democrats are learning this under Barack Obama.</p>
<p>However, it seems the states are so fed up with the federal government that they are in pretty open rebellion (something I don&rsquo;t think the one party with two heads ever considered a possibility).  Only now that they are willing to openly defy the feds, is it allowed to even be an issue.  Quickly, the powers that be are figuring out how strongly Americans feel about it.  We are willing to get behind states that rebel, particularly on this issue&hellip;.which is why it is an issue now.</p>
<p>Because of Obama, the one party with two heads system has never been weaker.  It&rsquo;s analagous to the fall of the Soviet Union.  The difference being that white Americans are far more cohesive and clever when times are bad, than the russians ever were.  Their response when times were bad, was to roll over on their bellies while a small minority shaved their heads and went on a rampage.  Our response is to wake up.  Well on its way to happening.  In a few more months it will be much more advanced.</p>
<p>The November elections will be quite telling, not so much for who gets elected but for how obvious it will be that the one party with two heads is falling apart.</p>

		<p>No society can withstand the uncontrolled invasion of illegal aliens from every corner of the earth. The preservation of the nation&rsquo;s territorial sovereignty, and the culture, language, mores, traditions, and customs that make a harmonious community. This dictates that citizenship be granted only by the consent of the governed, not by the unilateral actions or demands of the illegal alien. There are currently marches opposing the Arizona&rsquo;s law that attempts to do what Obama and the federal govt. refuse to do.  Pres. Obama has actually tried to make a deal with Arizona that if they agree to what amounts to amnesty, he will start enforcing the border. He is attempting to bargain on what is his duty under the Constitution.  Can America survive Obama? 2012 cannot come soon enough!</p>

		<p>Its time American opinion was translated into policy. Luckily, at least 17 states are drafting bills similar to Arizona&rsquo;s. With strong support for such laws, they should pass in most states. The only potential problem would be the courts, who have ruled similar laws &#8220;unconstitutional&#8221; in the past.</p>

		<p>Every white father ought to park near a construction site and watch the grinning &#8220;Day Laborers&#8221; as they grab their crotches and make other obcene gestures, catcall, whistle and make lewd remarks at every (especially white) female over the age of nine that passes by. A half hour of that kind of education will go a lot further than anything he can be told.   </p>

		<p>#2 Anonymous, great commentary!  You are correct about the November elections will be quite telling, for there are candidates who have gotten smart and abandoned the notion of running on a 3rd party ticket and near 100% failure to get elected.  So several have jumped on the popularity of the Republican party to run for office.  However, they are not Republican at all.  There is a candidate for Georgia governor who is a standing member of the League of the South and is a States&rsquo; Rights man.  He approves and desires secession to solve the nation&rsquo;s woes.  This new nation, The Confederation of Southern States will not be a welfare state either. They are very clear in their &#8220;Grey Book, a Blueprint for Southern Independence&#8221; that social programs will not exist and that they will hold the biblical admonition that if a man does not work, he does not eat.  If the League of the South and it&rsquo;s Southern National Congress can pull this off, we expect to see a mass exodus of blacks to wherever there will still be a liberal state in which they can continue to get government handouts. Then we expect to see a mass emigration of whites from all over the country to come South and join this new white paradise and it&rsquo;s expected prosperity without parasites eating out our sustenance.  And you can be certain that the NAACP, SPLC, and other REAL hate organisations will be sent packing to other parts for they and their continuing to race hustle will not be welcome.  Political candidates such as Rand Paul are getting wise and running on the popular party ticket, while remaining true to their stand once in office.  More and more 3rd party candidates are beginning to do just this very thing.  To run for office on the most popular ticket at the time, only to put the real agenda into motion once in office.  I urge any white brother/sister to obtain a copy of the &#8220;Grey Book&#8221; and see what a true republic would look like and then see how a certain black exodus from the south would most certainly occur.  We very well may get our White utopia afterall soon enough.</p>

		<p>I hate to say this, but I think Arizona may have jumped out of the frying pan and into the fire with the employer sanctions law and SB1070. Ever since the employer sanctions law passed a few years ago and the Mexicans started self-deporting, I&rsquo;ve been seeing more and more blacks in my neighborhood, some of them wearing gang colors. I think that maybe the blacks in California have heard that the Mexicans are all leaving here and are moving here because of it. After all, we know that in California, the Mexicans have them on the ropes. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not crazy about Mexicans, but I&rsquo;d gladly take them back if we could get rid of the blacks.<br/>

		<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t care about this law. ALL they see is the COLOR. The more brown/black skin tones, the better. Now if these illegals had White skin then you can be sure blacks would want them deported. Many illegals are also BLACK. They don&rsquo;t have enough sense to see the future without the &#8220;crackers&#8221; paying most of the taxes for their next freebies. </p>

		<p>William Clinton was called the first black president. When he got out of office he bought a multimillion dollar home in the Hamptons. George Bush while he was in office tried to push through amnesty for the 20 millions of illegal Mexicans here in the US. When he got out of office he bought a multimillion dollar home at Preston Hollow. I wonder how many blacks and Mexicans hang out in those areas? </p>

		<p>As a woman myself, why am I not surprised that (more) women are not in support of immigration enforcement? </p>
<p>White women need to be taught to stand in solidarity with their own race. Most are too naive to do so on their own. </p>

<p>Um&hellip;who are you directing your comment(s) at?  Whites in the UK or in the US?  I can assure you whites in the US, especially those down South, don&rsquo;t care for them.  I can assure you whites who remember their cities and communities being nice and clean when they were majority white and watched to see them turn into ghettos once blacks moved in don&rsquo;t care for most blacks. </p>
