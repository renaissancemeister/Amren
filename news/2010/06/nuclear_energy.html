			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Austrian Times (Canterbury, England), June 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Most Austrians like the term &#8220;safety&#8221; while the word &#8220;Islam&#8221; creates positive feelings with just three per cent, a new poll on word association has revealed.</p>
<p>Linz-based researchers IMAS said today (Tues) 69 per cent of the 1,055 people aged 16 and older they interviewed said they liked the word &#8220;safety&#8221;. The term &#8220;justice&#8221; drew the second-best result with 65 per cent followed by &#8220;order&#8221; (61 per cent) and &#8220;work&#8221; (56 per cent).</p>
<p>A meagre 17 per cent said the term &#8220;multicultural&#8221; has a positive meaning for them, while only 15 per cent have a positive opinion of the term &#8220;European Union&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Islam&#8221; was found to be the least popular term with a support of just three per cent.</p>
<p>Terms like &#8220;foreigners&#8221; (six per cent) and &#8220;nuclear energy&#8221; (four per cent) were found to be more popular. Austria has been one of the most outspoken opponents of nuclear energy in Europe for decades.</p>
<p>These findings come just weeks after IMAS found that 54 per cent of Austrians agreed with the statement &#8220;Islam poses a threat for the west and our familiar lifestyle&#8221;. Just 19 per cent disagreed with the claim, while 27 per cent were undecided.</p>
<p>The agency also found in April that 72 per cent of Austrians believed Muslims would &#8220;not stick to the rules&#8221; when it comes to living in Austria. Only one in ten of the Austrians IMAS spoke to said they disagreed with the allegation that Muslims were badly integrated in the country.<br>

		<p>I have great hope for Austria. They even have a nationalist party (the Freedom Party) serving in the government in coalition with one of the mainstream parties. In fact, one year the Freedom Party got a fourth of the votes in a national election, and still gets around one-half in the state of Styria. And this study is just more good news from Austria.</p>

		<p>There is great hope in Austria, but it is regional. Obersalzburg is the heart of the Nationalist Party, FPÖ. The rest of Austria sadly is only slightly less anti-European than Germany and the EU.</p>
<p>Nontheless, this region has always been this way and I have faith that it will stay that way. Germany and the rest of Austria attempt to silence these people, but they have been so far unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Reading about this region will help lift spirits of anyone here on AMREN.  </p>

<p>   54% That is way too low for a people to fight back.</p>

		<p>Re Post #1, if you&rsquo;re referring to the national government, the FPÖ served in the coalition from &#8216;99 to &#8216;06 from memory but did not play such a large role in that (or at least not as large a role as one would expect or hope a &#8216;far-right&rsquo; party would play). Initially after the &#8216;99 election where they did very well they had to take a backward step after outrage from the governments of a lot of other countries including the US. The party they were in coalition with (ÖVP) then more or less took over and called the shots. The FPÖ started to fracture somewhat a few years after the &#8216;99 success and had some poor election results but has since seen a resurgence, and if anything have taken an even stronger nationalist stance under their new leadership (which has turned some voters away but is encouraging to others). (There is also a much smaller, more nationalist party called the NVP which aligns itself with Germany&rsquo;s NPD but who have not achieved any significant electoral success that I&rsquo;m aware of).</p>
<p>The FPÖ are usually the 3rd largest party. I would say if you average their votes in the state and national elections they sit around the 15% mark.  They seem on the brink of breaking into the 20%+ vote share again. The next big test is for the leader of the party, HC Strache, in the Vienna elections for mayor later this year. My guess is that he&rsquo;ll do well but he&rsquo;s up against the socialist candidate who has been mayor for 3 or 4 terms already and whose party (SPÖ) is far and away number one in Vienna.</p>
<p>As for the above article, it paints probably a bit too positive a picture than what I see here (I live quite close to Linz, incidentally). The young are as leftist as they are anywhere else I&rsquo;ve been, and the majority are still too apathetic about politics. As with much of the rest of Europe there is a very large number of foreigners here (albeit many from former Yugoslavia and Eastern Europe). In Vienna you can take bus or subway trips and not hear a word of German. </p>
<p>There is an unmistakable &#8216;far-right&rsquo; presence, though, and I think the signs are definitely there that success can be had in Austria, but I think it&rsquo;s still quite a bit too early. Besides, as a small nation I think we&rsquo;d need ti see similar success in other European nations, and at least the larger power-broking nations in the region such as Germany, France, and the UK seem quite a way off that, too. Otherwise threats of sanctions etc would follow once again and we&rsquo;d see a repeat of what happened after &#8216;99. But say 15-20 years from now, who knows.</p>

		<p>I went to school in Salzburg.   Of any place that I have ever been on Earth Austria was one of the most conservative regarding racial matters.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to give ammo to the enemies of Amren or Austria, but just imagine the conversations we had late at night over too many beers.  A PC-American would&rsquo;ve fallen out of their chair, and these were people who didn&rsquo;t consider themselves &#8220;right-wing&#8221;.  They pointed out that the real right wingers hung out at the fencing club (the origin of the scar on the face of many famous portraits of German officers) close to our place.  </p>
<p>Lovely place too.  Vienna, The Tyrol, Voralberg, Salzburg, the Steiermark&hellip; I highly recommend it to Amreners who have the money to travel in these hard times.</p>

		<p>Muslims embrace insane seventh century desert laws that were atrocities even by seventh century standards.  </p>
<p>This is why they have always been denied access to the West.</p>
<p>Today Western politicians accept bribes from Islamic states in exchange for allowing Muslims unlimited access to Western nations.  </p>
<p>This article below is a classic example of the Islamic medieval mentality so incomprehensible it can barely be deemed human:<br>
  <br>
&#8220;Somali Girl Raped and Stoned to Death UN Dispatch, November 12, 2008&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&rsquo;t get worse than this. Last week, 13-year old Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow was stoned to death in Somalia by insurgents because she was raped.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Reports indicate that was raped by three men while traveling by foot to visit her grandmother in conflict capital, Mogadishu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When she went to the authorities to report the crime, they accused her of adultery and sentenced her to death.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Aisha was forced into a hole in a stadium of 1,000 onlookers as 50 men buried her up to the neck and cast stones at her until she died.&#8221;</p>
<p>Remember the above incident as you contemplate the fact that America has a rabidly anti-white, anti-Christian, anti-Jewish, anti-American Muslim sympathizer in the Oval Office&hellip;</p>
