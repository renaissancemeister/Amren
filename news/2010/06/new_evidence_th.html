			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jay Matthews, Washington Post, June 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Roy Freedle is 76 now, with a research psychologist&rsquo;s innate patience. He knows that decades often pass before valid ideas take root. When the notion is as radical as his, that the SAT is racially biased, an even longer wait might be expected. But after 23 years the research he has done on the surprising reaction of black students to hard words versus easy words seems to be gaining new respectability.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Now, in the latest issue of the Harvard Educational Review, the two scholars who took on that project have published a paper saying Freedle was right about a flaw in the SAT, even in its current form. They say &#8220;the SAT, a high-stakes test with significant consequences for the educational opportunities available to young people in the United States, favors one ethnic group over another.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The confirmation of unfair test results throws into question the validity of the test and, consequently, all decisions based on its results,&#8221; said Maria Veronica Santelices, now at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile in Santiago, and Mark Wilson of UC Berkeley. &#8220;All admissions decisions based exclusively or predominantly on SAT performance  &mdash;  and therefore access to higher education institutions and subsequent job placement and professional success  &mdash;  appear to be biased against the African American minority group and could be exposed to legal challenge.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Back in 2003, when I wrote a long article for the Atlantic Monthly on Freedle&rsquo;s work, I relied heavily on him and other experts to explain what they were talking about. Much of it had to do with a method of test analysis called differential item functioning, or DIF (rhymes with cliff). Psychometricians like Freedle and his colleagues at ETS, which was then managing the SAT, looked at how different ethnicities that were matched at different scoring levels (those who had scored 360 on the SAT verbal test, then those who had scored 380, and so on) did on each item.</p>
<p>At each level of ability, but particularly in the lower-scoring groups, white students on average did better than blacks on the easier items, whereas blacks on average did better than whites on the harder ones. (Whites, however, as a group did better overall.)</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hard questions, those that produced more wrong answers, tended to have longer, less common words. Easy questions tended to have shorter, more common words. Freedle thought this was key to the relative success African American students had with the harder ones. Simpler words tended to have more meanings, and in some cases different meanings in white middle class neighborhoods than they had in underprivileged minority neighborhoods, he concluded. This, he said, could help explain why African American students did worse on questions with common words than on questions that depended on harder, but less ambiguous words they studied at school.</p>
<p>On average, he said, black students were performing only slightly above matched-ability whites on hard questions. But averages did not submit applications to colleges. Individual students did. Some of those individuals, he discovered, would have gotten a boost of a hundred points or more on the SAT if the score was weighted toward the hard items. He proposed that the College Board offer a supplement to SAT scores, called the Revised-SAT, or R-SAT, which would be calculated based only on the hard items. This, he said, would &#8220;greatly increase the number of high-scoring minority individuals.&#8221;</p>
<p>In their paper, Santelices and Wilson rule out Freedle&rsquo;s suggestion that the bias he found in the test might affect all kinds of multiple-choice questions, or minorities other than blacks. But they did find it in sentence completion and reading comprehension sections of the SAT.</p>

		<p>In my last US Navy days I worked on F-14 Tom-Cats, anyway, every Thursday we had to go to training on systems (engines for me), very easy, just sit there for 2 hours and pay attention, then take a simple 20 question test on what you TOLD, if you failed had to go on Saturday (usually a day off). Seems the only ones that failed the simple test were the blacks and had to go in on Saturday for the make-ups, they screamed &#8220;racism&#8221; of course. Know how they fixed this? They did away with the training, yes no Jets fell out of the sky (that anybody knows about of because of this) but just another example of dumbing everybody down as to make all equal.</p>

<p>What an absurd extrapolation.  How can a test be biased against an entire ethnic group when the ethnic group in question speaks the same language and attend the same schools?  All the SAT does is measure the academic competence of the student before he enters college, it does not, as this article states, predict or have any bearing on someone&rsquo;s professional success.  The simple fact that the racism industry refuses to acknowledge that the success on the SAT is mirrored in the average IQ of the test taker speaks volumes.</p>

		<p>For some reason every test ever devised is biased against black people. If the SAT test were the only test that blacks have trouble with then there would be cause to look into said test.</p>
<p>Why are white people not complaining that orienals do better on IQ test? They must be biased because one group does better than another group. </p>
<p>All test really are biased, smart people have an advantage. </p>

		<p> If Mr. Freedle&rsquo;s theory is proven correct, it will knock the &#8220;race is just a social construct&#8221; crowd for a 100-yard loss. For, if this problem with the long, unfamiliar words affects only blacks, then how could it not be genetically based?</p>
<p> Of course his notion might sound a little more plausible if he hadn&rsquo;t done what almost all such left-leaning researchers do in race-based cases: They limit their research to Whites and blacks only. No Hispanics or Asians need apply. Or Native Americans.</p>
<p> Because if all such identifiable racial groupings were studied, the waters almost surely would become so muddied that no case could be made, in any way, shape or form, that blacks were somehow, some way, being &#8220;discriminated against&#8221; in the way the tests are prepared and administered. And that is exactly what the researchers WANT to prove, because it confirms all their fondly-held prejudices.</p>

		<p>NYU research professor Diane Ravitch describes how the SAT (and textbooks and tests generally) have been transformed into &#8220;inoffensive pap&#8221;:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A top official at the Educational Testing Service [which produces the SAT] told me that his company and other testing agencies deleted items whenever anyone complained about them; items might be dropped not only on grounds of bias, very broadly defined, but also if they might make a student feel &lsquo;uncomfortable.&rsquo;  The very fact that someone objects to a topic or a test item can be sufficient to make it &lsquo;controversial.&rsquo;  As another ETS official admitted to me, &lsquo;It is better to be bland than to be controversial.&rsquo;  By institutionalizing this extreme sensitivity to anything that offends anybody, publishers of both textbooks and tests have been turning their products into inoffensive pap for the past generation.&rdquo; (The Language Police: How Pressure Groups Restrict What Students Learn, p.50)</p>

		<p>I remember hearing this exact same rigmarole a few years ago. The College Board published a rebuttal in which it demonstrated that the relatively better performance of blacks on difficult questions exists only because most students guess on these questions. The vast majority of SAT takers answer difficult questions incorrectly, and these questions are usually only useful for distinguishing between high scorers (of which there are virtually no blacks).</p>
<p>If we wanted to, we could administer a very difficult IQ test to a random group of people and find that blacks and whites have almost identical averages. Would that prove that they have the same average intelligence levels? Of course not   &mdash;   the scores would only indicate that both races are equally skilled at random guessing.</p>

		<p>So let me get this straight, the less ambiguous a word is the more likely a black can understand it.  The more a word&rsquo;s definition must be taken in a given context the less likely a black is able to understand it.  </p>
<p>Since many American English words have multiple meanings this leaves black at quite a disadvantage.</p>
<p>I think this study just proves blacks have less reasoning ability, not that the test is biased.   Once again the ability of foreign born and/or first generation  Asians to perform well on the SAT is ignored.</p>

		<p>Did I read what I read in this article?</p>
<p>So if the SAT were dumbed down more blacks would pass?</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t that apply to anybody?</p>
<p>Asians don&rsquo;t seem to have a problem with it.</p>
<p>Using hard words is a sign of greater education or potential from our grade school years and so is an indicator of success in rigorous college courses.  </p>
<p>Colleges were designed, by the way, to take our best and brightest, not to take our most struggling and underachieving and redress &#8216;historical wrongs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then we read that some easy words are understood by white kids differently than black kids.  Okay, I&rsquo;ll play along.  Doesn&rsquo;t this mean then that the Black people are speaking basically a foreign language, and that if they want to succeed (like the Asians) in a white American created educational system, that they need to study hard and master the nuances of the English language?</p>
<p>Otherwise, we could just give them the test in Ebonics.  But then the Asians might demand the SAT in Chinese, the Latinos, in Spanish, etc&hellip;  Uh oh, Shhhh.  Better not give the libs any more ideas!</p>
<p>Social justice advocates have messed up most of our grade K-12 schools and turned them into mediocre poster board project factories that talk about Che, Mandela and MLK ad nauseum, and now they&rsquo;re going after the colleges, because little DeQuan and Latrina can&rsquo;t seem to pass the entrance tests that generations of Americans had to jump over.</p>
<p>The next ten years or so are going to be very interesting.</p>

<p>I remember taking the SAT awhile back. I can recall several vocabulary questions. One such question asked us to define the word &#8220;bucolic.&#8221; I remembered reading about bucolic poetry, which dealt with rural and pastoral themes, so I bubbled the correct answer. <i>I never heard the word &#8220;bucolic&#8221; mentioned in my majority white, middle class suburb. Never.</i> Instead, my knowledge of the word &#8220;bucolic&#8221; derived from being well-read in literature and poetry.</p>
<p>Judging from my example, it&rsquo;s so obvious that the so-called researcher&rsquo;s entire premise for explaining the racial achievement disparity in SAT scores is false.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s give the hack researcher the benefit of the doubt for one moment and say that his bogus theory is correct. Just what is his explanation for the racial achievement disparity in SAT scores for subjects such as mathematics? Dealing exclusively with numbers can&rsquo;t possibly have any bias.</p>
<p>These egalitarians, who are extremely averse to the facts, can be adequately compared to flat-earthers, geo-centrists and creationists, because all four have something in common: they don&rsquo;t get reality.</p>

		<p>The theses presented in this article are absurd. And this is not surprising, because the official &#8220;Liberal&#8221; theory of race being a purely social construct is absurd as well. In particular, it asserts, contrary to the existing evidence, that there are no statistically significant differences between intelligence of various racial groups. So, any test that shows a significant difference must be &#8220;biased&#8221; under the (false) assumption that there is no such difference. Hence the fallacy hidden in the article.</p>
<p>A more general paradigm (falsehood proves everything) that the above fallacy is an instance of has been known at least since 19th century. Once a false premise is taken for granted, one can formally prove any absurdity from it. Here is a classic example that is attributed to Bertrand Russell. It formally proves conclusion &#8220;I am the pope&#8221; from a false statement &#8220;2 + 2 = 3&#8221;. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume 2 + 2 = 3.<br>
Subtracting 2 from both sides we get: 2 = 1.<br>
So, two persons are one person.<br>
Obviously, I and the pope are two persons.<br>
So, I and the pope are one person.<br>
Therefore, I am the pope.<br>
End of proof!</p>
<p>As the above paradigm shows, it is only a matter of time before the &#8220;Liberals&#8221; prove ANY absurd statement they want from their absurd assumptions (like that race is a purely social construct). This fact seems to characterize pretty well the &#8220;Liberal&#8221; ideology: a bunch of absurdities &#8220;scientifically&#8221; proven from another bunch of absurdities. The same characterization holds for other leftist ideologies, for instance, socialism, Marxism, etc.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t believe a word of this clap trap. You can make statistics say anything you want. Anyway why is it bias just because a black gets an easy question wrong? Doesn&rsquo;t that just mean they got the thing wrong.</p>
<p>I guess they&rsquo;ll just have to go beat up some more Asians since they continually outscore them on all tests and entrance exams. If we didn&rsquo;t set up all their success with affirmative action quotas, lower test scores and white guilt they really would be in a tissy.</p>

		<p>Jay Mathews: &#8220;At each level of ability, but particularly in the lower-scoring groups, white students on average did better than blacks on the easier items, whereas blacks on average did better than whites on the harder ones. (Whites, however, as a group did better overall.)&#8221;</p>
<p>The Freedle theory is interesting. It has logic.</p>
<p>But decades of efforts have already gone into tweaking the SAT to give better scores for minorities and women.  The chief tool for this purpose is DIF (differential item functioning) analysis of how different groups of presumed equal ability perform on individual test items. DIF has already eliminated a wide range of topics from the SAT and other tests because of their presumed bias (whites did better on these items than equal-ability blacks).</p>
<p>Thus, the remaining &#8220;harder&#8221; test items that blacks did better on than equivalent ability whites are of great interest.  What could such items be?  Could they turn out to be culturally biased in favor of blacks? </p>
<p>Quoting NYU education historian Diane Ravitch once more:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;Currently, ETS has layers of review and DIF analysis to seek out any whiff of bias or insensitivity. Its bias guidelines warn reviewers and test assemblers to avoid the following subjects: the military, sports, violence, and specialized vocabulary associated with farming, finance, law, politics, science technology, tools and machinery, transportation or charts (and maps and graphs), as well as questions assessing spatial skills.   DIF analysis has shown that these topics are associated with group differences in performance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ETS can&rsquo;t abide topics &#8220;associated with group differences in performance&#8221;.  So what topics are left?  Ravitch continues:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One can only imagine  &mdash;  and gasp at  &mdash;  the diminution of content in nationally administered tests when such a broad array of topics must be scrupulously avoided&hellip; .&rdquo;  p55, The Language Police (2003) by Diane Ravitch</p>
<p>One wonders exactly which test items, having survived such bias-detecting DIF analysis, blacks scored better on than supposedly equal ability whites.  </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s have a look at them.</p>

		<p>This is a satire or comedy piece, right? </p>
<p>What lunacy. Can you imagine the bizarre, twisted logic required to come up with this excuse? It&rsquo;s like saying the reason blacks did poorly on the SAT is because they are simply too smart.</p>
<p>This is from the article:<br>
&#8220;At each level of ability, but particularly in the lower-scoring groups, white students on average did better than blacks on the easier items, whereas blacks on average did better than whites on the harder ones. (Whites, however, as a group did better overall.)&#8221;</p>
<p>First, I&rsquo;d like to see the supporting data. Besides, if blacks did better than whites on the harder questions then it should even out and the scores would be equal. Notice that later in the WashPost piece they slide in the point that blacks did only &#8220;slightly&#8221; better than whites on hard questions. They clearly added this to refute the obvious point about the scores evening out.   </p>
<p>From the article:<br>
&#8220;Geiser said he thinks the two researchers did a good job&hellip;He said he, like Freedle, wants more research on why blacks and whites answer these questions differently, so that any unfair disadvantages for blacks can be removed&#8221;</p>
<p>Okay - it has been 50+ years of ongoing analysis and refinement on the preparation and scoring of the SATs. Seriously, how much &#8220;more research&#8221; is needed to figure out why blacks score so low? What Geiser really means is liberals need more time to think up new excuses for black failure. </p>
<p>And if the test is racially biased in terms of the phrasing of the questions then why do blacks score 100+ points lower on the math section than whites?</p>
<p>I think I can tell you. Square root is a racist term. Root refers to plants, like cotton. Blacks were forced to harvest cotton as slaves. And a square is like a small room - where the slaves lived. How can one expect black scholars to concentrate when faced with such offensive, hate-filled wording? Research will show that most blacks will purposely fill in the wrong answer as a protest against white oppression. </p>

When a white thug hears,&#8221; Stop or I`ll shoot,&#8221; they figure out that if they don`t quit running they will soon die. A black perp has to decide what does stop mean and really puzzle out the or I`ll shoot part.Stop could mean put something in a bottle of Thunderbird to make it quit pouring. Stop could mean what his 15 year old white girl friend says and everybody knows she doesn`t mean it. The or I`ll shoot part is real trickey.

		<p>One possibility to explain why, on the lowest achievement levels, blacks do better than whites on the questions with hard words is this: the blacks are randomly guessing, whereas the whites have weak knowledge which leads them into one of the SAT traps.  So, random guessing gives better results than weak knowledge.  </p>
<p>What is being suggested, then, by having a Revised-SAT, is a test where all the lowest performers guess randomly, because it is only in tests of random guessing that blacks can do as well as whites and even better than whites who have weak knowledge.  How repugnant!</p>

		<p>Because blacks are better at understanding words like &#8220;antidisestablishmentarianism&#8221; than whites, but get confused with words like &#8220;bad&#8221; because they might have different meanings in the ghetto, this is why blacks don&rsquo;t do as well on the SAT.

		<p>Suppose blacks are not as proficient on average as whites on the the whole test .  At the really hard ones they may not be much worse than the whites are, and at the easy problems they also may not be much worse than the whites at.  But there is a range where they would be very much likely to be worse than the whites.</p>
<p>Extra Lucky blacks will have equal overall scores to whites who were not especially lucky.<br>
The lucky guessing which got these blacks a high score will be just as likely to work on hard problems as on medium problems.  The intelligence which which got the whites the same score as those blacks WILL be more likely to have worked on the medium problems than on the hard problems.</p>
<p>So there is nothing strange about the blacks and white within each score range having this different profile of which problems they got right. It is exactly what one would expect to happen if blacks were less proficient overall.</p>
<p><br>
then so long as at least as many blacks as whites guess on the hard ones</p>

		<p>Within each score range,  the blacks who got that score were guessing on more problems, than the whites were guessing on.</p>
<p>Guessing works equally well on a hard mutliple choice problem as on an easy one.  </p>
<p>The whites students reason for getting that same score was based more on understanding. Understanding works better on easy problems than on hard ones.</p>
<p>So the whites reason for getting such a score was more likely from getting the easy or medium easy problems correct, </p>
<p>while the blacks reason for getting that good score was more randomly caused by lucky hard problem guesses mixed with lucky medium easy, and easy problem guesses.</p>
<p>So of course the blacks in that group of students who got a score of 560 have more of their score from the hard problems. This is exactly what would occur if they were less intelligent at every problem.</p>

<p>LOL!  One more convoluted theory as to why blacks cannot achieve at the same rate as Whites.  Last week the excuse was,  &#8216;black neighborhoods cause violence, therefore blacks cannot learn as well as Whites.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be more stupid theories before the summer is out  &mdash;  count on it.  Right now, the pundits that work far away from the schools, researchers who well know that low achievement is caused by low intellect, are devising ever more ridiculous theories to keep their cushy government-funded jobs and keep the grant money flowing in.</p>
<p>These &#8216;brand new, ground-breaking&rsquo; theories will be presented at teachers&rsquo; professional developments before school starts, and I will tune them all out as I have tuned out all the others for the past two decades.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the bottom line:  Not all children are college material!  The SAT verbal portion &#8216;hard and easy words&rsquo; is designed to test a student&rsquo;s readiness to tackle college level texts.</p>
<p>Charles Murray writes in Real Education (p.69):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;College Board researchers defined college readiness as an SAT score that predicts a 65 percent probability or higher of getting a first-year college grade point average of 2.7 or higher  &mdash;  a B-minus average in an age of grade inflation, with no limit on the courses that quality&hellip;.the benchmark scores were 590 for SAT-Verbal, 610 for the SAT-Math or 1180 or higher for the combined score.</p>
<p>Three independent methods of calculating the answer to that question lead to an estimate of 9 to 12 percent with a realistic best-guess of about 10 percent.  So few can do well in real college because real college-level material is hard&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>But, none of that matters, nor does the outcome of admitting those with IQs of 85 to college and telling them that &#8216;they can be anything they want to be!&rsquo;  &mdash;  as they sit next to students who scored 790 on the SAT-Verbal and 5s on the AP English tests.</p>
<p>The real sin is allowing those with IQs of 85 and low SAT scores to take the place of high achieving Whites students because college admissions are a zero-sum game.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t blacks have a noted edge in improvisational creativity?  Isn&rsquo;t rap an admixture of rhyming words with obscured secondary meanings intended as commentary or story telling?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be too surprised if they did have some verbal advantages and that perhaps these edges brought to them an edge in recall of &#8216;tricky&rsquo; words which had perhaps a lyrical or even just simply (as it was with me) _hard study_ as short-term associative recall pattern.</p>
<p>Despite the dominance of G as a manifold driver, intelligence is a range scale, not an absolute, for all people in each of the prime factored areas of measure.</p>
<p>Thus you will have increased functional IQ in spatial, verbal, math or recall, usually at the cost of capability in other areas.  Some of which will be cultural via exposure/access or preference.  Some of which will be morphological or biochemical as genetics influenced.</p>
<p>Whites are lucky in that we seem to have gotten a pretty good spread on all of them, being at least competent in most.  Asians do exceptionally well in spatial/math related areas.  Ashkenazi in Verbal/Cognitive and sometimes Math I believe.</p>
<p>Is it then beyond reason that blacks will also find 1-2 areas which their culture (and yes, I find the hip-hop, rap and gang scenes despicable) have magnified to prominence through their rise in the overall U.S. societal acceptance and success?</p>
<p>Like several others here, I find the wording of the articles key sentences to be somewhat abstruse and would like some clarification.  Has anyone tried to Google &#8216;Freedle&rsquo; and &#8216;Black SAT bias&rsquo; through one of the major Psychometrics/Educational publications and see if there is an article outlining his theory in a little more detail?</p>

		<p>Well, here&rsquo;s what a little digging brought up for me:</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Freedle identified seven factors that seemed to affect the difficulty of a test question. One of the most common was simple word repetition. If an answer had a word in it that also appeared in the question, more test takers chose it; thus a question was easier if it contained a word that recurred in the correct answer, and harder if it contained a word that recurred in an incorrect answer. In reading-comprehension questions another factor was where in a reading passage the key part appeared. If it was at the beginning or the end of the passage, the question was easier than if it was in the middle. </p>
<p>Then he decided he would apply his analysis to ETS&rsquo;s biggest test. He realized that if he looked at how different ethnic groups reacted to the seven factors, he might help to improve the SAT and impress his supervisors, who indicated that rooting out bias in the test was a priority. </p>
<p>Freedle was excited by a new technique called differential item functioning, or DIF (pronounced diff). To see which questions on the verbal section of the SAT produced different results by race, test takers were first divided into groups by score: those who had scored 200, the lowest possible; those who had scored 210; those who had scored 220; and on up to 800, the top score. Each of those scoring groups were examined to see how people of different ethnicities had done on each item of the test. </p>
<p>Using DIF, Freedle began to notice some intriguing results, which turned out to have more to do with word choice than with the seven difficulty factors. At each level of ability, but particularly in the lower-scoring groups, white students on average did better than blacks on the easier items, whereas blacks on average did better than whites on the harder ones. (Whites, though, did better overall.)</p>
<p>That was not a result that Freedle&rsquo;s supervisors expected. In 1987 he handed in a draft of a report on the subject that he had done with Irene Kostin, an ETS colleague. The research-division chiefs asked for a revision. He handed in a second draft. They were still not satisfied. Some of the questions were legitimate, Freedle thought. His conclusions contradicted other research. The chiefs wanted him to look at the data from other angles. But each re-examination confirmed the initial results. By the time he was ordered to do an eleventh revision, Freedle had begun to wonder if ETS, in its scholarly way, was trying to discourage him from pursuing his rogue conclusion. </p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>It should be noted from the outset that virtually all these DIF item effects are typically small. For example, White students may get 84 percent correct on some easy items, while African Americans get a slightly lower number, say 82 percent, correct for the same item. Conversely, for some particular hard items, White students may get 30 percent correct whereas African Americans might get a slightly higher score, say 31 percent correct. What is unusual about these effects is their highly patterned nature; that is, many easy items show a small but persistent effect of African Americans&rsquo; underperformance, while many hard items show their overperformance &hellip;</p>
<p>A culturally based interpretation helps explain why African American examinees (and other minorities) often do better on many hard verbal items but do worse than matched-ability Whites on many easy items. To begin with, easy analogy items tend to contain high-frequency vocabulary words while hard analogy items tend to contain low-frequency vocabulary words &hellip; For example, words such as &#8220;horse,&#8221; &#8220;snake,&#8221; &#8220;canoe,&#8221; and &#8220;golf&#8221; have appeared in several easy analogy items. These are words used frequently in everyday conversations. By contrast, words such as &#8220;vehemence,&#8221; &#8220;anathema,&#8221; &#8220;sycophant,&#8221; and &#8220;intractable&#8221; are words that have appeared in hard analogy items, and do not appear in everyday conversation &hellip; However, they are likely to occur in school-related contexts or in textbooks.<br>
Common words, Freedle explained, &#8220;often have many more semantic (dictionary) senses than rare words,&#8221; so there&rsquo;s more of a chance that people&rsquo;s cultural and socio-economic backgrounds will affect their interpretations of those words. (In a 1990 study Freedle and Kostin reported that &#8220;fifteen high-frequency analogy words &hellip; had an average of 5.2 dictionary entries, whereas rare analogy words &hellip; had an average of only 2.0 dictionary entries.&#8221;) Thus words that are frequently used in the middle-class neighborhoods of the SAT makers may have a different meaning in underprivileged minority neighborhoods. This, Freedle continued, could help explain why African-American students do worse on questions containing those common words than on questions that depend on the harder (but less ambiguous) words they study at school. He found that this effect was most pronounced on those questions &mdash; sentence completions, analogies &mdash; that provided little or no context.</p>
<p>Although Freedle&rsquo;s analysis concentrated on the verbal section of the SAT, he argued that the difficulty-bias effect extended to the math section, and perhaps even to essay questions such as those found on AP exams. He cited research showing minority students doing better than non-Hispanic whites on harder math items, which he attributed to the fact that those items used more textbooklike language and &#8220;more abstract concepts learned strictly in the classroom.&#8221; Minority students scored worse on the easier math items, just as they did on easier verbal items, because commoner words were used in those questions. Freedle said that an examination of essay test results showed a somewhat similar effect, whereby minority students scored better on harder topics than they did on easier ones.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>He believed that a supplemental SAT score was the best solution. He emphasized that he was not out to destroy the most important product of ETS and the College Board. He was not proposing a completely new SAT. He liked the adjustments the College Board was making to the test, including the thirty-minute essay section that would be added in 2005. He wanted his R-SAT scores to be sent to colleges as a bonus, to help them identify students, mostly lower-income students of all races, whose SAT scores suffered because of the distance between the language of their families and neighborhoods and that of middle-class America. </p>
<p>He did not try to estimate how many students would benefit from this additional information, but he thought it would be enough to make the supplement worthwhile. Freedle found one African-American student (Freedle&rsquo;s data gave no names) whose verbal R-SAT score was 600 although his or her original verbal SAT score was only 290. &#8220;This student&rsquo;s gain score is 310 points &mdash; an astonishingly large reassessment of his/her scholastic skills,&#8221; Freedle wrote. Potentially thousands of students would score 100 to 200 points higher on the R-SAT than on the SAT; that higher score could mean the difference between getting into a selective college and not. Such increases in their scores might also make them eligible for thousands of dollars in scholarships.</p>
<p>Freedle&rsquo;s response to this, in a draft memo that he never sent to the College Board, was &#8220;Shame on you.&#8221; He said he had done a statistical analysis of the five choices in the questions studied and found that the students&rsquo; picks did not seem to be random at all; taking his study further would not be adding error to error. Some independent experts dismissed the Freedle piece. &#8220;I was unimpressed,&#8221; says Robert Linn, a University of Colorado professor and a former president of the American Educational Research Association. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t think there is much there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>They want to remove barriers that limit young people&rsquo;s choices in life. All of them, Freedle included, acknowledge that many other things, more difficult than devising a scoring supplement to a multiple-choice test, will have to be done to make that happen. <br>

<p>For Freedle&rsquo;s original article seems costs 10 bucks and I&rsquo;m not going to pay that for 257K worth of information.</p>
<p>Apparently, there are &#8216;seven categories&rsquo; which dictate difficulty in the type of question.  Based largely on reuse of key words in the correct and incorrect answers.  And on correlative phrases with high contextual importance being at the beginning or near the end of given sentences vs. in the middle.</p>
<p>Yet critics seem to point out that the bias in percentages is within 1-2 points either way among co-scoring (i.e. nominally IQ matched) black/white students and that -overall- the rating of 22 out of 100 is little better than that of random guessing on a 5 choice answer option.  For either group.</p>
<p>To which Freedle&rsquo;s best response seems to be &#8216;shame on you&rsquo;.</p>
<p>OTOH, Robert Calfee, the one man who sees the most potential relevance to Freedle&rsquo;s work is a person to whom the notion of &#8216;hard words&rsquo; seems to mean exactly the opposite of what Freedle implies.  i.e.  The use of formal language (learned at school) vs. natural language learned at home or in everyday life.</p>
<p>Myself, the front:back vs. center context stacking issue may come down to visual psychology.  A smaller foveal gap inducing edge field versus centroidal search patterns or some other tendency to scan items differently as a function of looking for key subject:correlate patterns.</p>
<p>The use of &#8216;big word&rsquo; analogies may simply be a statistical weighting issue relevant to the way blacks and whites score the relevance of certain terms (this is something that almost has to be weighed on a question by question basis to judge well).</p>
<p>And finally, for Freedle and others _looking to make a mark_ as one last hurrah in their field or to gain a lucrative study grant, covering added re$earch, it would appear that bias attaches.</p>
<p>What bothers me however is two factors:</p>
<p>1.  The SAT-R (= R-SAT?) seems to put emphasis on harder questions which one expert in the first link suggests would post problems beyond those a typical freshman would be expected to know.  Freedle then pushes these questions at the -lower- scoring students.  Which seems backwards to me and if anything points towards the random guess conclusion.</p>
<p>2.  If semantics and total vocabulary are important interpretative measures for white performance and you do things like remove the analogies portions of the SAT which emphasize them -AND- you add a &#8216;supplimental score&rsquo; based on select rather than overall test question correct answers (which act to raise black testing as much as 200 points), are you not engaging in reverse discrimination?</p>
<p>It is the lattere area which I believe is the most crucial to understanding the flaws inherent to giving every youth expanded options within our society.  Because society was created to reflect one cultural norm.  And the SAT, at one time, selected for the intellectual values which supported that norm.  Unless you wish to make a functional efficiency check on &#8216;the way the game is played&rsquo;, it may simply not be wise to redial the biases another direction, solely to prove that discrimination can work both ways.</p>
<p>Obviously the best answer, if this is true, is to make the specific conditional advantages well known enough that either whites can adapt and compete.  Or blacks can enter institutions or classes designed for their aptitudes and post-graduate employers make decisions based on whether skillset A or B is most necessary to the work being hired for.</p>

		<p>Let me suggest a hypothosis: The Blacks mainly guess at the hard questions, and their success is random. The Whites try to reason about them. Since they are difficult, and the supplied answers are designed as bait for incorrect results, the Whites achieve less than random success. Note this is just a hypothosis (i.e. a guess), but I think a serious study would have considered and eliminated this effect. </p>

		<p>Sshadow:  Solution to &#8220;achievement gap&#8221; finally emerges.<br>
It should be a simple matter to devise an SAT with all questions using difficult words, (eg pandering etc), which give black test takers the obvious advantage, and strictly limit easy words which ordinarily give white test takers the advantage. Who would have thunk that a deficit 3 oz of biologically modern brain tissue could be more than compensated for by this clever  gambit.  Good sense dictates that it would work too. Professor Freedle smiles.</p>

		<p>Ok, playing along here, if it&rsquo;s been decided over the umpteen years this argument of SAT tests being racist, and tests have been dumbed down and down and down to accommodate this perceived fact, just HOW dumb do these tests have get before blacks make even a comparable grade? Apparently even the race cops who are changing the tests to make them more favorable to blacks aren&rsquo;t capable of judging either  a) the [lack of] intellect of blacks who continue to post abysmal scores or  b) the laziness of blacks who continue to post abysmal scores. Soon the test will only be allowed to have one question: What is your name? Considering the alphabet soup of popular black names, no one (either the student OR the scorers) would know if it&rsquo;s spelled correctly or not anyway.</p>

		<p>Just as a side note, the SAT no longer includes an analogies section. (My lame example:  bee is to hive as horse is to _______. Choices: house, building, garage, stable, hut) </p>
<p>Poster 49, who gave a detailed accounting (thank you), mentioned that the research was on the analogy type of questions. I don&rsquo;t know if other questions, such as those found in reading comprehension, were included.</p>
<p>Either way, though, the conclusion is mute.  If blacks did poorly on reading comprehension questions with &#8220;easy&#8221; words, then their comprehension is poor.  They should be able to read in context. If a word has multiple meanings, they need to understand which meaning is correct.  That is what reading comprehension is!</p>
<p>If the research is based only on word analogies, then, since the SAT no longer includes analogies, the study is outdated and useless.</p>
