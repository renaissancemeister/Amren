<h1><a href="https://www.theseoultimes.com/ST/index.html">Korean Ladies Refuse to Date Black Men</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ken Washington, Seoul Times, June 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><i>Letters to the Editor</i></p>
<p>(<i>Scroll down.</i>)</p>
<p>I am a Black American and I have lived in South Korea for eight years. I have recently been denied several jobs because I am Black.</p>
<p>My father fought and risked his life in the Korean War so Koreans could be free. Free to hate Black people. How ironic?</p>
<p>Several Korean ladies have refused to go out with me because they said that I am Black and when they were young they were made fun of because their skin was darker than most Korean. I then asked them &#8220;Would they not date Koreans if someone teased them for being Korean&#8221; and they said no because they are Korean and then I said you are also dark skinned so why do not like dark skinned people.</p>
<p>Anyway I began to understand how they felt as I watched Korean TV where all of the people in ads and TV shows are 99% white or light skinned. South Korea has effectively isolated a large majority of their population because they have color in their skin.</p>
<p>I was hoping (The Audacity to Hope) that when Obama became president that maybe the country would change about how they feel about Blacks but I was wrong.</p>
<p>The most disappointing aspect for me is that I really love Korea but I know that it is time for me leave where I know I am not wanted.</p>
<p>South Koreans have a great country with a lot of positives but to exclude so many people, simply because of their skin color, in the 21st century with no end in site is simply limiting the possibility of greater deeds.<br>

		<p>Sorry, Ken; your father didn&rsquo;t fight in the Korean war so Koreans could be free.  He fought because he was conscripted and taking his chances on the possibility of being wounded or killed in combat seemed a better deal than the certainty of a nice, long stay in Leavenworth.  Finally, if Korean women are refusing your advances because you are black, it is because they have better sense than the mother of Obama the Holy Hope Pope.</p>

		<p>One more example of the black entitlement mindset.  They want something, therefore they are entitled to it.  Somewhat ironically, in this case, the black is doing something White.  He is pretending or forgetting that race doesn&rsquo;t exist and equates it with skin color.  He appears miffed that Koreans want no solidarity with him and states, &#8220;I know that it is time for me leave where I know I am not wanted.&#8221;  I wish more blacks would figure that out. </p>

		<p> Welcome to Asia, Mr. Washington, where Political Correctness is unknown and Koreans don&rsquo;t care if they hurt your feelings by being racially conscious.</p>
<p> As Korea is largely racially homogenous, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s your imagination that so many people are &#8220;dark-skinned.&#8221; That is, unless they are the offspring of black American servicemen. Are their actions the &#8220;greater deeds&#8221; you were talking about?</p>

		<p>I envy the Koreans so much! Their country is so well-organized, the people have a clear identity, they don&rsquo;t have to be politically correct. If I could I&rsquo;d rather be Korean or Japanese than white as I see no hope for our previously-white countries. </p>

		<p>History vs. PC Propaganda. The real history of Blacks in the <br>
Korean War.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most serious example was 25id&rsquo;s unreliable all-Black 24th Infantry Regiment. 24th Infantry coined the term &#8220;Bug Out&#8221; and illustrated it, as around Sangju where 24th units abandoned their machine guns and mortars without being attacked. Exposing the flanks of adjacent regiments without warning offered the enemy access around our front lines, endangering all Eighth Army. At Muchon-ni, when our disciplined, competent 27th Infantry re-captured positions fled by 2/24 they found the battalion&rsquo;s abandoned crew-served weapons still in place. </p>
<p>Even more tragically shameful, when some of our best men in other regiments were wounded, they were abandoned by their comrades to the cruelties of the enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>I have a hard time believe this guy is really black. No black EVER leaves a place he is not wanted. That is usually why he shows up in the first place. Blacks have no interest in leading their own lives; they only get pleasure in ruining the lives of non-blacks and that is why they are drawn to places they aren&rsquo;t wanted.</p>

<p>Hey Comrade Washington, get over your &ldquo;African American&rdquo; sense of entitlement and realize, your not that hot of a commodity globally. The very fact that you underhandedly attempt to browbeat Korean women through this article to &ldquo;date&rdquo; you (or more likely to be casually mounted and discarded by you,) speaks resoundingly to your oversexed arrogance. Moreover, that you childishly thought Comrade BO&rsquo;s &ldquo;election&rdquo; would pave the way for your interracial debaucheries in Korea, indicates just how unappealing and wretched you really are as a &ldquo;man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Sorry, if the truth hurts!</p>

		<p>This obviously young man doesn&rsquo;t understand the power of reputation and race. And by the virtue of his father serving in Korea during the Korean War, he believes Korean women should automatically accept him.  </p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t a place on the planet where blacks have lived or settled where a huge precentage of their numbers have preyed on people of other races as well as their own. Their communities become war zones. For anyone of another race, blacks are a very &#8220;high risk&#8221; relationship.</p>
<p>This is the reputation blacks have built, and now black people like the author of this article don&rsquo;t like it.  Try to mentally connect the dots, Mr. Washington.  </p>

		<p>Evidently, the women of South Korea have some natural intelligence that keeps them away from that dark community that has proven to be so harmful to all that have come in contact with it through the ages. These ladies just don&rsquo;t need the whole AIDS/HIV thing, or the perpetual violence and crudeness that are the signature offerings of that dark demographic. </p>

		<p>A black man finds it incomprehensible that he is not wanted outside of his native Africa.</p>
<p>It is only the white countries that have brainwashed his head with the unnatural idea that outsiders are &#8216;welcome&rsquo; everywhere.</p>
<p>For most of human history, he would have been met with hostile armed response just for setting foot on another race&rsquo;s territory. Even in his native Africa he could be socially rejected, or worse, for not being from the local tribe.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got news for blacks, most of the world would be happier if they left. There are places where they don&rsquo;t really like whites but in most areas of the world they really hate blacks. </p>
<p>I think that back attitudes have a lot to do with not being accepted. If a Korean woman doesn&rsquo;t want to date a white guy he doesn&rsquo;t take it personal but any woman that doesn&rsquo;t want a black man is in for trouble. They just assume that because they can get away with anything here in the US that&rsquo;s the way it should be everywhere. Many countries still have traditional values. Blacks have no respect for the values of others. </p>

		<p>The author is typically so self centered he&rsquo;s incapable of being objective. He didn&rsquo;t get some jobs; perhaps he wasn&rsquo;t up to their needs. But no, it&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s black. Some women didn&rsquo;t want to date him; perhaps he&rsquo;s some homely, pushy dude. He thinks they should be thrilled at the chance to date him. But no, he&rsquo;s black. He thinks who gets elected president of the USA should electrify the mere Koreans, after all what else do they have to do but to worship us. Didn&rsquo;t translate into more dates for him, but then he&rsquo;s probably no Obama anyway. So the natives weren&rsquo;t as impressed with him as he thought they should be. Try Africa next, the residents might have a higher regard for him. </p>

<p>Let me get this straight: you think just because your father fought in the Korean War (I&rsquo;ll bet he didn&rsquo;t volunteer) that entitles you to their livelihood and their women?  Typical arrogant black!</p>
<p>By the way, for the record: your father didn&rsquo;t fight in the Korean War &#8220;so Koreans could be free.&#8221;  He fought so South Korea would remain in the U.S. sphere of influence!  Despite all the flowery rhetoric spewed out of government propaganda machines, humans don&rsquo;t fight wars with one another &#8220;to make the world safe for democracy.&#8221;  They fight them either to take something from another or to hang on to what they have!</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyway I began to understand how they felt as I watched Korean TV where all of the people in ads and TV shows are 99% white or light skinned.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a phenomenon that has been discussed at length many times here on AmRen.  Colorism, the hankering many if not most people have for the lighter elements of their society (esp. male to female), appears to be ubiquitous among humans and is probably instinctive (yes Virginia, it&rsquo;s true: humans do have instincts).  Like many other instincts that have survived in man, it&rsquo;s probably tied to fertility.</p>
<p>&#8220;South Korea has effectively isolated a large majority of their population because they have color in their skin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Evolution doesn&rsquo;t care if it hurts your feelings; it only propagates what works.  Live with it.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most disappointing aspect for me is that I really love Korea but I know that it is time for me leave where I know I am not wanted.&#8221;</p>
<p> Would that blacks here in America felt as you do.</p>

		<p>One of the reasons Korea is so good is because of its lack of diversity.  At best, multi-culture societies don&rsquo;t work, and the only country with ethnic diversity that has flourished is the USA. It&rsquo;s been fairly successful at integrating it&rsquo;s immigrants into one culture, values and language. At least so far.</p>

		<p>There are plenty of Korean ladies that refuse to date Whites or any foreigners. That is their perogative and as a White, I admire and support them completely for keeping their race Korean/Asian. Unlike the West, Koreans and Asians in general, don&rsquo;t see diversity as a strength and believe in keeping Korea and their children, Korean. Too bad Whites weren&rsquo;t like that.</p>

Korea (how you did that w/o the consent of the military service is anybody&rsquo;s guess) I can only hope that you wind up spending your food stamps in some Korean grocery store in S. Kalifornia.</p>

		<p>If this fellow has so much to offer as an émigré why doesn&rsquo;t he emigrate to Africa?  Gosh knows they need help of every sort.  Certainly the South Koreans are quite capable of taking care of themselves.  And if they are ever reunited with the north they will have more than enough third worlders of their own blood to take care of.  Third worlders who, if given a chance, will no doubt accomplish more in a generation than African have in 100 generations.</p>
<p>Another thing, why doesn&rsquo;t he find himself a black wife?  Isn&rsquo;t a black woman good enough for him?  Or is he just looking for a good time, knock up some poor Korean girl and leave her with the baby?  I bet their are lots of Nigerian mail order brides available.</p>
<p>As for he and the Koreans all being people of color, well, I am sure the Koreans can tell the difference between an Oriental and an African, even in a black and white photo.  The wide spaced eyes, the broad nose, thick lips, tiny ears and sloped forehead that are the hallmarks of an African.  Mr. Washington, race is goes much deeper than a tan.<br>

		<p>If I am not mistaken, I seem to recall that the black regiments performed horribly in the Korean War. In fact, it would not be too far-fetched to conclude that the retreat of black units caused the death of white soldiers/airmen while they tried to regain the lost ground that the blacks had forfeit.</p>
<p>Also, good for the Korean ladies. I would be ecstatic if our White women had as much common sense and loyalty as the East asians seem to possess.  Sometimes, I think our women (not all, of course) go for the &#8220;other&#8221; (blacks,hispanics, etc) to spite us&hellip; only to realise their horrible mistake too late.</p>

		<p>It is ridiculous how much black men and Southeast Asian men attempt to make advances at Korean women&hellip;.  A lot of black men always approach me and speak to me nicely because they wonder if I have some contact information of single Korean girls.  While I was in school, I know a large black boy who joined the Chinese Christian Fellowship just so he could get more chances to communicate with Chinese girls.  </p>
<p>This man does sound like a nice dude&hellip;. he says many positive things about South Korea.  and I do appreciate what his father has done during the war.  </p>
<p>This man also does sound like he is misunderstanding a little&hellip; he must understand that interracial dating is still rare throughout the world.  It does not mean any disrespect to anyone outside the race&hellip;  it only means cultural differences and physical differences can&rsquo;t easily be overcome when it comes to some particular matters in our lives.</p>
<p>I always read about a few black athletes and hispanic athletes playing baseball and basketball professionally in South Korea&hellip; if Koreans truly hated blacks, they would not be able to have jobs in Korea.  (I also read foreign players absolutely enjoy the Korean beef)  A lot of Caucasian pitchers play baseball professionally in Korea as well.  If you go to Japan, the proportion of foreign athletes is just as high, if not higher, because baseball is possibly the most beloved sport in Japan.  </p>
<p>and next, he, or anyone, cannot expect the entire Korean population to change overnight&hellip;  because they saw something on TV.  </p>

<p>He thinks a sane people would want insemination of their female population by foreigners, blacks in particular is to deny a &#8220;greater deed.&#8221;  This black thinks that he is entitled to sex with any woman anywhere because Obama was elected president of the U.S.</p>

		<p>Do blacks not understand that not all people find them attractive?  I perfectly understand this about the Koreans because Thai ladies feel the same.  In their culture, white skin is considered more beautiful and many seek to marry a caucausian man to ensure their babies are more white skinned.  I used to belong to a Thai dating site, www.thaidarling.com, and I have yet to see a Thai girl desiring a black in their profile.  Most have listed &#8220;caucasian&#8221; as their preference, and a few will list &#8220;Asian&#8221;.  But NONE have &#8220;black&#8221; listed as preference for a mate.  I have talked with several Thai ladies, and asked them about this.  Everyone had a variation of the same answer.  &#8220;Black men are unattractive, practice little or no hygeine, are lazy and most are jobless, unfaithful, bad tempered, and several other reasons given that I won&rsquo;t go into here that we all at AmRen know about.<br>
  Folks, this is Korean and Thai culture, and has nothing to do with discrimination!  This man says that &#8220;it is time for me to leave where I know I am not wanted.&#8221;  O how I do wish that all blacks had this same attitude.  AmRen readers are gonna have a field day with this one!  Why is it that whenever blacks do not get whatever they want, they claim &#8220;racism&#8221; or discrimination?  When General Lee surrendered at Appomattox, VA, this entire nation lost, only the Confederates knew it at the time. </p>

<p>Too bad the blacks in the US don&rsquo;t make the same choice.  Why did it take you so long to decide to leave?  Koreans want to be among their own kind and have children that look like them, as well as having a higher I.Q. and not a black one that borders on mental retardation.</p>
<p>&#8220;South Koreans have a great country with a lot of positives but to exclude so many people, simply because of their skin color, in the 21st century with no end in site is simply limiting the possibility of greater deeds.&#8221;</p>
<p>South Koreans have a great country, because unlike the US they&rsquo;ve never been burdened with blacks who have low I.Q.&rsquo;s, high crime rates, and practically no ability at all.</p>
<p>How on earth would Koreans be limiting the possibility of greater deeds by keeping blacks out of their society?  Blacks bring down the average national I.Q. by several points wherever they live, except for Africa, where it is normally at the 70 average.</p>
<p>When you leave, why don&rsquo;t you go to Africa and be among your own people so you won&rsquo;t be embroiled in so much angst over people of another race who want to keep their bloodlines pure?</p>

		<p>Wow, whining &#8220;racism&#8221; because he can&rsquo;t get a Korean woman to sleep with him. This is the kind of race-hustle garbage they play on white women. At least Korean women not disabled by &#8220;white guilt&#8221; don&rsquo;t go along with it for the most part. I was stationed in S Korea in the late 70&rsquo;s with the US Army and had many interactions with them, I had no problems with them. But, almost to a person they weren&rsquo;t crazy about blacks for the very same reason many whites aren&rsquo;t crazy about them.</p>

		<p>The late Oxford University Professor John R. Baker in his 1974 book RACE points out such basic matters as odor preferences among races.  Caucasians have to the noses of Koreans, Japanese, and Chinese, a much stronger body odor than these Asians typically experience among themselves.</p>
<p>The odor difference between such Asians and Blacks is very  great and is frequently encountered as being at least mildly repellent.   If such facts of life were known and amenable to open mention, a trip to the shower just before an embrace would neutralize this problem.  Male organ size is another very real problem that is not easily alluded to in any context but locker room &#8220;humor&#8221;.  Several years ago an event known all over Japan but faintly reported in the US was the rape by a Black American soldier of a Japanese girl.  Severe physical damage was done to her inescapably because of the incompatibility of the sexual organs.  On average there are frequent physically-based  &#8220;accommodation challenges&#8221; across the racial distance between Blacks and Asians.</p>
<p>The underlying question here is not whether social-sexual interactions should be encouraged.  The issue  is that a Black man seems oblivious to these possible barriers.  There is truly nothing quite as terrifying as ignorance in action.  BTW, the 1974 book was faced with such emotional resistance that it was not reprinted by the UK publisher and was revived only in 1981.</p>
<p>It would be nice to see a kind of collective non-wiki wiki effort online made to update-annotate the text for very obvious reasons.  In the climate of these times, that&rsquo;s the only update possibility that exists.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;I am a Black American and I have lived in South Korea for eight years. I have recently been denied several jobs because I am Black.&#8221;</p>
<p>So it is only recently you&rsquo;re being denied several jobs, meaning that you were able to secure job(s) previously in SK? Perhaps your past employment records leave much to be desired? Did you by any chance stomped your previous employer?   </p>
<p>&#8220;My father fought and risked his life in the Korean War so Koreans could be free. Free to hate Black people. How ironic?&#8221;</p>
<p>Get over yourself, they don&rsquo;t hate you, they just don&rsquo;t want to have anything to do with you which is pretty normal - I imagine neither Beyoncee or Hale Berry would want to be romantically involved with this 5 foot something Asian guy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Several Korean ladies have refused to go out with me because they said that I am Black and when they were young they were made fun of because their skin was darker than most Korean.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were being polite, they could have said that they refused to go out with you because you&rsquo;re too ugly-looking.</p>
<p>&#8220;I then asked them &ldquo;Would they not date Koreans if someone teased them for being Korean&rdquo; and they said no because they are Korean and then I said you are also dark skinned so why do not like dark skinned people.&#8221;</p>
<p>What kind of insane logic is this? Because they&rsquo;re dark skinned then they must like dark skinned people? Well then, you&rsquo;re black so why are you liking Korean women instead of your own black women?</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway I began to understand how they felt as I watched Korean TV where all of the people in ads and TV shows are 99% white or light skinned. South Korea has effectively isolated a large majority of their population because they have color in their skin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aside from your childish and hypocritical attitude, please do not believe all you saw on TV. And it&rsquo;s obvious that you&rsquo;re not a color-blind person either - i.e. you yourself still see color and hence &#8220;&hellip;&hellip;.Korean TV where all of the people in ads and TV shows are 99% white&hellip;&hellip;&#8221;.  </p>
<p>&#8220;I was hoping (The Audacity to Hope) that when Obama became president that maybe the country would change about how they feel about Blacks but I was wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah I was hoping that Charlize Teron and Megan Fox would drool over my 5 foot something Asian body - didn&rsquo;t happen either, I feel your pain brother.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most disappointing aspect for me is that I really love Korea but I know that it is time for me leave where I know I am not wanted. South Koreans have a great country with a lot of positives but to exclude so many people, simply because of their skin color, in the 21st century with no end in site is simply limiting the possibility of greater deeds.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I am just wondering why simply because I said black males get away with inappropriate advances they make at women, but Asian males and white males can&rsquo;t, that automatically means I received rejections from women in the dating world.    </p>
<p>You yelled at me when I described any of my past experience and success with females outside my race, that I am just another threat to the white race,</p>
<p>and if I ever stay quiet, it automatically means I am not getting any women and you think it is a failure if I can&rsquo;t get any women.  </p>

		<p>What struck me most about this poorly written article was its self-pitying nature. He didn&rsquo;t get some job he applied for? It&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s black. In reality there could be many reasons. Just how fluent is he in speaking Korean, for just one example. He hits on some Korean women and they turn him down. It&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s black. Maybe he isn&rsquo;t very attractive to these women. Maybe they prefer a fellow Korean. Who knows? I would mention that preference and prejudice are not the same thing. Note too his sense of entitlement and immaturity. His father (probably drafted and most black soldiers performed poorly during the Korean conflict) fought in Korea (that was 57 to 60 years ago) so he thinks he is owed something. WRONG! Especially since he seems to think he can help himself to Korean females. </p>

<p>Translation : Plenty of white women don&rsquo;t date blacks not because they are blacks but rather because those white women think that those blacks are of lower social status.

<p>I fully agree. Dating and marriage are very personal and everyone has their own preferences. I wouldn&rsquo;t date men in their 70&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m much younger. That doesn&rsquo;t mean I hate men in their 70&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;m tall, some men want a short, petite woman. That doesn&rsquo;t mean they hate me, it&rsquo;s just their preference. The same goes for Korean women, Korean men are just their preference, doesn&rsquo;t mean they hate others.</p>

In korea and in the US Korean people hate the blacks, ironic however that they are the only ones who would run small stores in black areas of American cities.  The Korean store owners told me that Blacks spend far more freely than whites, who were too tightfisted to make a profit</p>

<p>  Is Mr. Washington a Korean citizen? Surely, Koreans are under no obligation to hire non citizens? In addition, why shouldn&rsquo;t Koreans be allowed to hire who they want?  What about their freedom? Korea is evidently freer than America in that regard. If Korean women don&rsquo;t want to date blacks or whites, it&rsquo;s not a blow to my self-esteem. Maybe, these patriotic women love their own people and culture? Mr. Washington should realize that blacks don&rsquo;t have the same privileges overseas that they do in America.</p>

 As for Obama&rsquo;s election, folks like him need to take note that 56% of white voters cast their ballot for McCain.  If the letter-writer is one of the low-IQ, magical-thinking blacks who thought a black Prez would transform attitudes, well that alone says something about his desirability as an employee or date.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s with all this White woman bashing?  Most White women do no sleep around with other races.  You people portraying our women as some kind of slu#s are either nonwhites or White men who married orientals because of a lack of confidence or &#8220;bedroom&#8221; issues.  There are more than a few news stories out there of Korean women being pregnant by black servicemen and ditching the children in orphanages where they&rsquo;re placed by international adoption agencies to stupid White American couples.  The Japanese are notorious for shipping their race mixing women and blackanese babies to Brazil.  These fantasies of all Asian women wanting to keep their race pure are just that. <br>

<p>The reason women of other RACES do not like/date blacks is because they have not been indoctrinated with the garbage of &#8220;guilt&#8221; and with the constant propaganda of how &#8220;desirable&#8221; other races are over our own. WE are the &#8220;haters&#8221; the oppressors, the &#8220;racists&#8221; the bigots, etc and we OWE them all! They don&rsquo;t have a &#8220;hollywood&#8221;, MTV, BET, and a traitorous media as we do. They don&rsquo;t have &#8220;hate&#8221; laws where they will be punished if they do not accept all races or say the wrong thing to a minority. They don&rsquo;t get sued for not hiring or for firing a black, mexican etc. </p>
<p>The MAIN factor is because they all have their own countries without being invaded by those not of their own race!!!! ONLY White nations were FORCED to commit suicide!</p>

		<p>I suspect this man&rsquo;s frustration stems from the fact that he cannot play the race card over there&hellip;Koreans are not impressed with his slavery heritage and don&rsquo;t feel they owe him the time of day, which is hard for a black person to swallow&hellip;blacks are used to getting preferential treatment here in the States off Whitey&rsquo;s guilty feelings. Korean women have good reason to avoid mingling with blacks, nothing good ever comes of it.</p>

		<p>Korean Kid&hellip;don&rsquo;t take the negativity too hard.  Us poor white folks have a lot of, justifiably, pent up anger and frustration at how this multicultural lunacy has affected our lands and our people.  For the most part white people respect North-East Asian culture and societies&hellip;they are not so different from ours.  However, nobody asked the average Westerner if we ever wanted to be swamped by foreigners of any type and have our very existence as a people put in jeopardy.  As any Korean would not want that for their own nor do we for ours.</p>

		<p><i>Ugh, what&rsquo;s with all the &ldquo;I wish white women felt the same&rdquo; comments? There are plenty of white women who won&rsquo;t date blacks because they&rsquo;re black. The ones in America are simply smart enough not to give their blackness as a reason to their face when they&rsquo;re asked in person.</i></p>
<p>Exactly. Needs to be repeated. Quite frankly, dumping on Euro-American women is getting old.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Korean, Chinese, and Japanese women have more sense than most American white women. That is why I am certain that two centuries from now there will still be Korean, Chinese, and Japanese people, whereas I am not nearly so sure there will be any white people left.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Have you checked East Asian fertility rates lately? Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea, and most major Chinese cities like Beijing and Shanghai, are all at 1.1 child per woman, more or less. Japan is just below 1.4, about where Germany (the worst European country) is. Euro-Americans are at 1.8.</p>

The image is gangs, baggy clothes, drugs, playing basketball all the time. So Hunter-Gault started a program to dispel such myths. Sending young American black men around the world to demonstrate how wonderful the black male youth of America is. And sends PhD candidates.

<p>No wonder the white race is in trouble.  The most racially conscious among us constantly enjoy starting fights with their own.  Either you are with us or against us.  And I agree with the poster above who said that most of you who spout this nonsense date Asian women.  Get lost and let the rest of us focus on saving our people.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am just wondering why simply because I said black males get away with inappropriate advances they make at women, but Asian males and white males can&rsquo;t, that automatically means I received rejections from women in the dating world.&#8221;</p>
<p>You yelled at me when I described any of my past experience and success with females outside my race, that I am just another threat to the white race,</p>
<p>and if I ever stay quiet, it automatically means I am not getting any women and you think it is a failure if I can&rsquo;t get any women.</p>
<p>Ah, that&rsquo;s ok, I have my own matters keeping me occupied nowadays, and I can&rsquo;t afford to pay attention to every negative posts regarding me or Asian males in general.&#8221; </p>
<p>-I&rsquo;ve read a couple of your posts, and I cannot help but get the impression that sometimes you come on here to champion the rights of asian males. This of all places is the last place to do that. I understand that us asian males have our own issues and what not to deal with, but this is not the place to do it. White people obviously have enough of their own problems to deal with, they&rsquo;ve already wasted enough time worrying about the problems of other groups. </p>
<p>Whites and Asians do have some similar interests, but at some point those interests do diverge. The two races are natural allies, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that we&rsquo;re automatically bound at the hip. In my opinion, whites should stay white, and asians should stay asian, interracial mixing is acceptable (and even inevitable) on a SMALL scale, but I by no means condone or approve on a large one.   <br>
  </p>
<p>&#8220;This man does sound like a nice dude&hellip;. he says many positive things about South Korea. and I do appreciate what his father has done during the war.&#8221;</p>
<p>-The korean war was nothing but geopolitics for the united states, if they (the US) didn&rsquo;t have a stake in the far east, they wouldn&rsquo;t be there. Don&rsquo;t be naive. I&rsquo;m not saying america is bad, or manipulative, i&rsquo;m just saying that when it comes down to it America is no different than any other country thats ever existed at the present or in antiquity.</p>
<p>&#8220;This man also does sound like he is misunderstanding a little&hellip; he must understand that interracial dating is still rare throughout the world. It does not mean any disrespect to anyone outside the race&hellip; it only means cultural differences and physical differences can&rsquo;t easily be overcome when it comes to some particular matters in our lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>-Why do you assume that miscegenation is a fait accompli? If somebody wants to date interracially I have no problem with that, but I do have a problem when they act like doing so is completely natural and totally inevitable in the long run. I personally date interracially, but I don&rsquo;t think everyone else should/or be expected to for that matter. If I meet a white girl (or any other race) that is exclusively interested in her own race only, I understand that, and furthermore I RESPECT and SUPPORT that.  </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;I always read about a few black athletes and hispanic athletes playing baseball and basketball professionally in South Korea&hellip; if Koreans truly hated blacks, they would not be able to have jobs in Korea. (I also read foreign players absolutely enjoy the Korean beef) A lot of Caucasian pitchers play baseball professionally in Korea as well. If you go to Japan, the proportion of foreign athletes is just as high, if not higher, because baseball is possibly the most beloved sport in Japan.&#8221;</p>
<p>-Personally I detest this, I see it as nothing more than (racial) pandering. I&rsquo;m sure white americans feel the same when their fellow whites idolize black NBA and NFL players. For this, I fault koreans, whats the point of having basketball or baseball leagues in korea if you&rsquo;re just going to import foreign players? What does this say about korean people? (and korean athletic talent for that matter.)</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;and next, he, or anyone, cannot expect the entire Korean population to change overnight&hellip; because they saw something on TV.&#8221;</p>
<p>-May I ask you, why should they change? Perhaps&hellip;they are right, and we here in the west are completely wrong?  </p>
<p><br>
I know i&rsquo;m coming down pretty hard on you, but frankly&hellip;your viewpoints almost verge on being those of a disingenuous liberal. With regards to politics, I respect moderation if it is called for, but a lot of your points just come across as being moderate for the sake of being moderate. Being the devil&rsquo;s advocate if you will. In today&rsquo;s political climate, there is very little room for moderate opinions. Commonsense is being backed into a corner by idiotic, leftist, orwellian ideology. The time has already passed for being diplomatic, now it is time to take a stand.</p>
<p></p>
<p>*Judging by your moniker I assume that you are quite young, if thats the case, then I assume your opinions are largely a product of the folly of youth. In that case, no harm, no foul, we&rsquo;ve all been there before, hopefully though as you age, you&rsquo;ll become just as jaded, and realistic as the rest of us.</p>

		<p>As an Asian from Asia, I must say that this author is making the wrong conclusion here and he&rsquo;s unnecessarily too sensitive. In Korea, Japan and China, being white has been considered being beautiful for thousands of years, before they even knew there exist white and black races in this world. It has nothing to do with race, it&rsquo;s simply the traditional beauty standards.</p>

		<p>This is one of the best Amren posts in a long time.  </p>
<p>This semi-literate English teacher &#8220;loves&#8221; Korea but now he is just going to pack his bags and shake the dust of Korea from his shoes because the Koreans won&rsquo;t give him a job and sex.  Maybe the recession has hit Korea, too.  If so, fewer people will be able to afford English teachers, and any job for an English teacher will receive far more applicants.  Maybe this guy was employable as an English teacher in boom times, but not during the current bust.  </p>
<p>He &#8220;loves&#8221; Korea, but does he SPEAK Korean?  I think if he knew much Korean at all, he would have proudly pointed that out in his letter.  </p>
<p>He also asks whether his father&rsquo;s service to free Korea enabled them to be free to hate.  What &#8220;hate&#8221;?  When whites wander into a black neighborhood and get beaten senseless because they are white, THAT is hate.  What hateful thing have the Koreans ever done to this guy?  And if he truly believes that the Korean people hate him, why on earth does he &#8220;love&#8221; Korea?</p>
<p>How old is this guy?  If his father was a Korean War-era veteran, then he might well be over 60.  What age group is he trying to date?  Maybe the Korean women consider it rude to point out the AGE difference, and choose to focus on the RACIAL difference instead.</p>
<p>There are lots of black servicewomen in Korea   &mdash;   why doesn&rsquo;t he date them?  Is it because they are TOO DARK?  Is he actually looking for a wife, or does he just want a series of Lady Friends?  Women can often sense the difference.</p>
<p>Could it be that this guy is just too obnoxious to get a date?  He asks women out, and if they turn him down, he grills them on their racial attitudes.  If they admit to preferring to date men of their own race, he tells them that they are racist.  What a winning personality!</p>
<p>I wonder if this guy is engaging in the standard black practice of radiating his sexual energy in all directions at all times.  Maybe Korean women raised in Korea are even more put off by this approach than most American white women.</p>
<p>If he is aging, unemployed, black, unable to speak the local language and no doubt deeply in debt, is it really a surprise that women are turning him down?</p>

		<p>It angers me every time when I see a white women with a ghetto mouth thug black guy and two, three or more black kids. Even more so when I see black men hitting on white women. Many white men in the U.S. cannot find white women to date, let alone marry and form families with. I had zero luck in this regard, in part due to the huge numbers of white women who chase blacks. Is it any wonder white men are marrying and fathering children with Asian women when they cannot find white women they would prefer to be with? At least some Asian women are decent people though I know Asian men resent white men marrying Asian women because they have an even harder time than we do finding mates. White women who have black kids I for one want nothing to do with, I am not raising another man&rsquo;s kids, and I am not going to tolerate dealing with a black man interfering in my life, nor will many other white men.</p>

<p>I never tell anyone who to date either.  Of course, anyone can date whoever they want.  That&rsquo;s why I think the mainstream media is absolutely out of its mind when it pushes and pushes for white female-black male relationships.  The next common type of relationships the mainstream media pushes for is Asian female-white male.  The mainstream media also frequently try to convince the viewers that interracial couples are &#8220;cooler&#8221; and &#8220;superior&#8221; to non-interracial couples&hellip; when the reality is what race you specifically choose to date from does not determine, or make any influence at all on how wonderful one is.  There is nothing wrong with having a preference his or her own race.  White women should realize that it does not make them a racist if they say no to black men.  I remember going to a dinner party once, while doing my undergraduate, and saw a young couple&hellip; the girl was a beautifully dressed tall black girl and the man was a well-mannered, well-dressed man with black hair.  The white married couple who invited us for dinner had a ferret and the three of us had a wonderful time playing the ferret.  The couple never received any stare for the entire evening&hellip; and one of my best friends is from Hong Kong currently doing his doctorate at UBC&hellip; he is currently married to one of the most beautiful white Christian women I have ever seen.  </p>
<p>I am currently badly occupied and I decided not to look for a relationship with anyone until Feb 2011.  Meanwhile, I will also keep learning little by little about relationships and marriages until the moment I start looking for a relationship&hellip;  I constantly see a number of people who ended their relationships and marriages in bad, painful notes because they started relationships and marriages without any preparation at all, financially and mentally.  Marriage also comes with enormous responsibilities.  I know a kid, currently in late-teens, he lives with his grandparents&hellip; when I saw the kid for the first time, I thought he was not the elderly couple&rsquo;s grand kid because the couple looked too young to have such a big grandson&hellip;  and later I heard the boy&rsquo;s parents got married with each other when they were 19 years old and they divorced because of various reasons and at the moment the boy has no idea where his biological mother lives, and see his dad about once a week.  his grand mother told me a story.. one day, the boy asked his grand mother, &#8220;grand ma, can I call you mom?&#8221; and she asked, &#8220;why?&#8221; and he answered, &#8220;because I have nobody to call &#8220;mom&#8221; and it makes me so sad because of that&hellip;&#8221; I was so sad to hear that and I promised myself I will get properly prepared before I do get married&hellip;.  or start a relationship&hellip;.</p>
<p>as for my experience outside my race&hellip;. I had a couple of non-Korean girlfriends&hellip;  one was Caucasian, the other was not Caucasian but she looked Caucasian because she had light skin, hazel eyes and brown hair.  She was Armenian.  They both taught me a lot and I had beautiful times with them.  They also made my parents very happy as well.  <a href="https://img816.imageshack.us/img816/8568/picm.jpg" rel="nofollow">https://img816.imageshack.us/img816/8568/picm.jpg</a>  </p>

(and korean athletic talent for that matter.)</i></p>
<p>I think there is a limit on how many foreign players each team can have on their roster in Korea.  Any more than 10% is prohibited&hellip;  I am a fan of the Toronto Blue Jays(MLB) and two of our players, a pitcher named Brian Wolfe (Caucasian) and Randy Ruiz (Puerto Rican) asked to be released from Blue Jays organization so they can play in Japan&hellip; and their requests were granted.  </p>
<p>I know it might make Korea sound like a less attractive place for foreign players than Japan might be, but a few foreign players in Korea proudly state that their next goal is to play in Japan.  and I understand the reality.  Japan&rsquo;s population is more than twice the South Korean population and obviously the market is also more than twice bigger therefore they get paid more in Japan than they do in Korea.  baseball is also much more loved in Japan than it is in Korea.  </p>

Don&rsquo;t tell me about how things &#8220;appear&#8221; .  Whenever I go to parts of the country that have large military populations, I see more white men with black women than the other way around.</p>
<p>Other than that, anywhere else, I tend to notice when white men do this stuff more than white women anyways.  Do you suppose this is perhaps your problem also?  As a white man you notice white women doing it more because that bothers you more?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s stick with actual statistics here.  All of this aside, none of this justifies white men going after Asian women, nor does it justify the white women bashing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to hear anymore &#8220;but but but Courtney&#8221; arguments on this topic anymore.  What you say is irrelevant.  The statistics say otherwise.<br>

Please tell us all how bad old white men &ldquo;make&rdquo; you do these things to cause yourselves to instill this revulsion as potential mates. I&rsquo;ll wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>Okay, you don&rsquo;t have to wait too long.  Nice challenge, but it really wasn&rsquo;t that hard to answer.  </p>
<p>Your post proves my point.  First of all, we all know you are married to an Asian woman.  Second of all, if most white women walking around are as you describe, please explain to me why statistics show most white men marrying their own?</p>
<p>But why of course I am wrong and you are right.  Let&rsquo;s just disregard statistics.  Let&rsquo;s assume most white men prefer Asian women because that is what you want us to believe.  Try again.</p>
<p>And I am not saying this to be cute or sassy, but if any man on here wonders if I am being a hypocrite, I will be happy to send you my photo in an email, just so you know I am NOT one of the women that I fuss at men on here for accusing most white women of being like.</p>

<p>That may be true of some White women you see but not all. As a White woman, I have certainly seen my share of White males with tattoos, weird piercings, obesity, bad attitudes and mixed-race kids too.</p>
<p>Please tell us all how bad old white men &ldquo;make&rdquo; you do these things to cause yourselves to instill this revulsion as potential mates. I&rsquo;ll wait.</p>
<p>Nobody on here said White men make women do this. Obviously, White women who get tattoos etc. do it because they want to just like White men. Also, don&rsquo;t always judge a book by its&rsquo; cover. Tattoos, piercings etc may not be your personal choice in appearance but I&rsquo;ve know plenty of nice women and men who have them. It&rsquo;s a fashion thing, just not you type of fashion.<br>

		<p> &#8220;Several years ago an event known all over Japan but faintly reported in the US was the rape by a Black American soldier of a Japanese &#8220;</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s the case I&rsquo;m thinking that girl was only 12. </p>
