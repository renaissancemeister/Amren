			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Phil Willon, Los Angeles Times, June 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The city councils of Hemet and Lake Elsinore, both in Riverside County, approved proclamations Tuesday in support of Arizona&rsquo;s controversial anti-illegal immigration law.</p>
<p>The Yorba Linda City Council in Orange County approved a similar resolution earlier this month, countering actions taken by leaders in cities such as Los Angeles, who voted to boycott doing business with Arizona companies in protest of the law.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Hemet City Council unanimously approved the measure, proposed by Mayor Eric McBride. Dozens of residents testified throughout the evening, with supporters praising the council for taking a stand against illegal immigration and for the rule of law, and opponents accusing the council of fostering racial profiling and discrimination. Residents on both sides criticized the White House and Congress for failing to address the issue.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Lake Elsinore, a 28-mile drive west of Hemet on Highway 74, a similar scene played out before that city&rsquo;s council, which approved a resolution in favor of the Arizona law 4 to 1.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&rsquo;t have to do with your nationality or where you come from. It has to do if you&rsquo;re here legally or not,&#8221; said Mayor Melissa A. Melendez.</p>
<p>Melendez, who said she has relatives of Mexican and Peruvian descent, also criticized illegal immigrants for disregarding the nation&rsquo;s laws and flaunting their allegiance to Mexico.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&rsquo;t come into my country wearing a Mexican flag. It&rsquo;s insulting,&#8221; she said.<br>

		<p>Notice how every article uses the specific term &#8220;controversial anti-illegal immigration law&#8221;.  </p>
<p>This tells us three things. The first and most important is that it is not controversial at all (or they would not have to keep saying it is).  There is unanimous consent that Americans, no matter, the race, religion or creed, want Mexicans gone.  Not just &#8220;illegals&#8221;, but solid anti-immigrant sentiment that is approaching militancy in MOST areas and has crossed into militancy (ie, people are arming themselves and patrolling the border the feds will not) in some districts.  Notice that, despite a rather large number of armed citizens on our border, it is not covered in the news, incidents of violence have a total news blackout, and there is no response to this by authorities.  I am sure, they would love to go down and arrest every single one of those &#8220;vigilantes&#8221;&hellip;.but don&rsquo;t dare.  What does that mean for the future of government in this country?</p>
<p>The second thing we learn here is that, no matter the news source, the wording is exactly the same.  Specific catch phrases are repeated over and over again.  All that &#8220;news&#8221; is coming from a centralized source.  Reporting what is going on is not their goal.  Trying desperately to manipulate public opinion is what they are after.  This has been a complete failure.</p>
<p>The last thing we learn from this is what is implied by &#8220;Arizona&rsquo;s&#8221; law.  This wording strongly implies that the law is different in places other than Arizona.  Yet, the Arizona law does nothing more than emphasize federal law already in place and a desire to enforce those laws.  The US is rapidly splitting in two based on race.  But nobody will say that most whites live in white areas and most non-whites live in non-white areas.  Instead, what is being emphasized is that certain places, the rule of law is evident while other places, the rule of law does not truly exist or is selectively enforced.  That is a very short hop indeed to the law is different based on where you live.  A communist banana republic in LA, a constitutional republic in Arizona.</p>
<p>Where you live matters&hellip;.it matters a lot.  If you live in the wrong place&hellip;MOVE.  While it is still allowed.</p>

<p>Too bad the French don&rsquo;t have half the guts to do the same!</p>
<p>Of course, the Chinese can probably get away with it more easily, without the inevitable charge of &#8220;racism&#8221;.  That privilege of self-defense isn&rsquo;t allowed to whites.</p>

		<p>The Chinese protesters in that June 20th French riot, were protesting about muggings and robberies perpetrated upon their own communities over several years by Blacks, mainly from Africa.</p>
<p>They caught one black in the process of bag snatching and gave him a good beating as depicted in the video.  The police intervened and the black criminal escaped. </p>
<p>What this sort of incident reveals is that multiculturalism and diversity is one huge con-trick and an outright deception demonstrated by the fact that each ethnicity is only interested in its own safety and prosperity so to hell with the rest, while in order to create an exclusive community to start with, each must colonise patches of territory within a country. </p>
<p>Apartheid is another name for it, but in the case of the West and the Third World invasion, it&rsquo;s self-imposed.</p>

Yes, actually it does.  We want the country to remain majority white and we&rsquo;re sick of immigration period, legal or illegal.  I&rsquo;m tired of reading articles where weak-spined whites keep saying that it&rsquo;s not about race.  Well, it&rsquo;s about race to me and it&rsquo;s about race to all the hispanics that are against the law.  Fair is fair.</p>
<p>Also, beware of these so-called conservative hispanics like Ms. Melendez that are supposedly on &#8216;our&rsquo; side.  </p>

<p>Haha, you are funny. You believe your press is manipulating because of the word &#8220;controversial&#8221;.</p>
<p>Here really every guy, even lefties who criticize immigration are called &#8220;right wing populists&#8221;. Populist is a very interesting word as you know, cause it means he actually wants to do what people want him to do. So the media is knowing what we want but ignoring it.<br>
They give criminal immigrants German names in the news, refuses to public pictures and in Bremen even agreed official to not public information about wanted criminals if they are immigrants to &#8220;not produce prejudices&#8221;. Left terrorists who try to kill police officers nearly every week by organizing traps for them are called &#8220;demonstrators&#8221; or &#8220;human right activists&#8221;. <br>
Why this can happen?<br>
Well we don&rsquo;t have Fox News like you. Our public (e.g. government controlled) media has a higher tax payed budget than all budgets of all private media have in Germany together. And although all of that, the German people still all agree that immigration is bad.</p>

<p>Great observation! <br>
Well, they go hand-in-hand   &mdash;    like church and state in the Middle Ages, when you had the palace on one side of the plaza and the cathedral on the other;  and each one was committed to reinforce the authority of the other. </p>
<p>The church controlled people&rsquo;s minds and opinions in those days. It kept them in line. The relationship between press and state is the modern version of it. Or I should say, &#8220;media&#8221; and state, taking in all forms of modern opinion control.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re right, what is so &#8220;controversial&#8221; about upholding the law? Should there be any &#8220;controversy&#8221; at all?   Who tells us there is?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be curious to know what you mean about &#8220;health care reform&#8221;.</p>
<p>Well, I suppose that &#8220;reform&#8221; suggests they&rsquo;re fixing it, fine-tuning it,  and making it better.  It just sounds good.</p>

<p><i>Notice how every article uses the specific term &ldquo;controversial anti-illegal immigration law&rdquo;.</i></p>
<p>This Freudian-like slip allow us to see the true colors of the writers and the media. They may be pretending now that they side with the majority of Americans but they did not give up their hostile anti-American stance. We must not forget this or we will be betrayed, again. Saying &#8220;E tu Brute, fili&#8221; after the fact doesn&rsquo;t help much.</p>
<p><i>The first and most important is that it is not controversial at all (or they would not have to keep saying it is).</i></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a logically valid conclusion. Interestingly, they never call Mr. Obama a &#8220;controversial president&#8221; although more Americans disapproves than approves of him.</p>
<p><i>The second thing we learn here is that, no matter the news source, the wording is exactly the same [&hellip;].<i></i></i></p>
<p>True, they were caught with a hand in a jar on this one. But I see here a spontaneous co-operation of a coherent group rather than central control, not withstanding that several networks and newspapers are centrally controlled when it comes to critical issues. </p>
<p><i>Trying desperately to manipulate public opinion is what they are after. This has been a complete failure.</i></p>
<p>I agree, except for the &#8220;complete failure&#8221; part. According to recent polls some 40 percent of Americans think of themselves as conservatives while only about 20 percent as liberals. Yet, the majority of the U.S. Congress are Liberals! Also, many of incumbents that are sold out to Mexicanization of America have been re-elected despite the fact that the majority of their base are opposed to it. Don&rsquo;t forget that these were the media who secured Sen. McCain&rsquo;s GOP nomination in 2008, a slick maneuver that all but guaranteed Sen. Obama&rsquo;s win.</p>
<p><i>If you live in the wrong place&hellip;MOVE. While it is still allowed.</i></p>
<p><b>I strongly disagree with this postulate. White flight has always been a losing strategy: a short-term gain for a long-term defeat. Continuing it will lead to whites&rsquo; gradual extinction (subordination to non-whites in the best case scenario). We should be the ones who crowd out the failed ethnies from the places that they ruined and not the other way around.</b><br>

		<p>Do remember that the Irish were not considered &#8216;white&rsquo; in the 1840s. Instead, they were seen as a violent, drug-addicted (alcohol) and treasonous (St. Patrick battalion in the war of 1848). Nearly all of them entered the country legally. Over time the Irish became white, but it took some time. If the country had not been short of labor, I doubt Americans would have approved allowing them to enter. We do not hate the Mexicans, but they cannot be allowed to come here against he will of the majority.  Had the issue been put to a vote in Congress, to enlarge the quote for Mexican immigration to a cumulative total of 20 million over 20 years, it would surely have been defeated. Businesses, the wealthy, and Democrat politicians are the minority groups that benefit most from the current state of things. This must and will change, and credit to Arizona for leading the way.</p>

		<p>#6 - The strength of whites will come from unity, not division. What of white Hispanics (people of Spanish descent) who are just as white as Germans or Irish or Swedes? They&rsquo;re Europeans. They&rsquo;re Cauacasians. &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; is an ethnic category, not a race, invented by the multicults to divide and weaken the white race. A poll showed that 58% of those classified as &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; self-identify as white. They&rsquo;re part of us. They&rsquo;re on our side. I&rsquo;ve seen Ms. Melendez&rsquo;s picture. She looks like a Spaniard and she&rsquo;s speaking out against the illegal alien trash. I for one welcome her to our side. It&rsquo;s the same thing with the Jews - with very few exceptions they are white. </p>
<p>Then some people get into the stupidity of &#8220;Aryan&#8221; pride (bashing Eastern European whites), Nordic pride (bashing Mediterranean whites), and WASP pride. Etc. Enough. We need white unity, not white civil war. This is not a pro-Nordic site or a pro-WASP site, it&rsquo;s a pro-white site, plain and simple. Despite my olive skin and dark brown hair, genetically and racially I am as white as you.</p>
<p>Thank God the blacks and mestizos fight amongst themselves and with each other. I give thanks every day that they do not unite against us while we are still divided.</p>

<b>&#8220;Well, it&rsquo;s about race to me and it&rsquo;s about race to all the hispanics that are against the law. Fair is fair.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>You&rsquo;re missing part of the picture. It&rsquo;s also about politics to many Mexican irrendentists who have designs on the Southwest and want to reclaim it for Mexico. To them, it&rsquo;s political not racial.</p>
<p><b>Also, beware of these so-called conservative hispanics like Ms. Melendez that are supposedly on &lsquo;our&rsquo; side. </b></p>
<p>Not quite sure what you mean by that. Also (as it&rsquo;s getting tiresome to point out) there are many whites among the ruling class in Mexico. Just look at Vicent Fox, or indeed any of their presidents   &mdash;   all white!  So it&rsquo;s not about race to them, even if it is to you. They see it through different eyes.</p>
<p>At any rate, it&rsquo;s better to have those &#8220;conservative Hispanics&#8221; half-way on our side than not at all. American whites are in such bad shape right now, and so friendless, rejected even by our own politicians, that we can&rsquo;t afford to repudiate any allies, even luke-warm ones.  We don&rsquo;t have that luxury.</p>

<p>&ldquo;controversial federal anti-illegal law immigration law&rdquo;</p>
<p>Section 8 USC 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv)(b)(iii)</p>
<p>&#8220;Any person who &hellip; encourages or induces an illegal alien to &hellip; reside &hellip; knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that such &hellip; residence is &hellip; in violation of law, shall be punished as provided &hellip; for each illegal alien in respect to whom such a violation occurs &hellip; fined under title 18 &hellip; imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.&#8221;</p>
<p>Section 274 felonies under the federal Immigration and Nationality Act, INA 274A(a)(1)(A):</p>
<p>A person (including a group of persons, business, organization, or local government) commits a federal felony when she or he:</p>
<p>    * assists an illegal alien s/he should reasonably know is illegally in the U.S. or who lacks employment authorization, by transporting, sheltering, or assisting him or her to obtain employment, or<br>
    * encourages that illegal alien to remain in the U.S. by referring him or her to an employer or by acting as employer or agent for an employer in any way, or<br>
    * knowingly assists illegal aliens due to personal convictions.</p>
<p>Penalties upon conviction include criminal fines, imprisonment, and forfeiture of vehicles and real property used to commit the crime. Anyone employing or contracting with an illegal alien without verifying his or her work authorization status is guilty of a misdemeanor. Aliens and employers violating immigration laws are subject to arrest, detention, and seizure of their vehicles or property. In addition, individuals or entities who engage in racketeering enterprises that commit (or conspire to commit) immigration-related felonies are subject to private civil suits for treble damages and injunctive relief.</p>

		<p>13 and 14 are right, though you need to read Racism Schmacism by James Edwards.  While it&rsquo;s nice to have blacks and hispanics who agree with us, we shouldn&rsquo;t make it our sole duty to find a black or hispanic or asian to justify our cause.  We appreciate the help, but we are white and need to promote our own causes without fear of being called racists.</p>

<p>I am so sick and tired of reading this divisive left-wing propaganda, intended to set whites against each other.  Pure rubbish!<br>

		<p>Poster #13 SNAviatrix, I believe that the term &#8220;hispanic&#8221; is a linguistic delineation, not racial or ethnic. You are right though, people from Spain are white Europeans, and skin tone does not take away what culture and history show to be the truth. As for those south Americans of mixed Indian/European stock, they are a different story. </p>

She looks like a Spaniard and she&rsquo;s speaking out against the illegal alien trash. I for one welcome her to our side. It&rsquo;s the same thing with the Jews - with very few exceptions they are white.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Despite my olive skin and dark brown hair, genetically and racially I am as white as you.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the the &#8216;one drop rule&rsquo; still applies for a lot of racially conscious people and Spain spent too many ceturies under Islamic occupation for their facial features and coloring to ever be acceptable to most nationalists looking for the one thing that still differentiates us most unequivocably from the Mestizo immigrants.</p>
<p>For those Iberians who do look truly caucasian, there is still some contempt based on the notion that you chose to leave behind mixed race descendants which is not something most whites are truly fond of admitting in their family trees (watch how fast each side pulls back from the other in an IR pairing and the unluckly son or daughter and their children are left on their own).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry but that&rsquo;s what it comes down to, Mediterranean and Mestizo or Indian looks often are too close to call and so both are rejected.  Claiming to be &#8216;European&rsquo; means nothing.</p>
<p>@#14  &mdash;  <br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
You&rsquo;re missing part of the picture. It&rsquo;s also about politics to many Mexican irrendentists who have designs on the Southwest and want to reclaim it for Mexico. To them, it&rsquo;s political not racial.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Not with labels like &#8216;La Raza&rsquo; and &#8216;MechA&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The Race want their own Aztlan.</p>
<p>Though I will admit the Mexican immigrants have a very much more aculturated understanding of what race is as both the phenotype, genotype and social expression of a given lineage.  Something our own liberal left are far too frightened to acknowledge as being part of the bigger picture: your family is your heritage and your legacy as it were.</p>
<p>The fact remains that they expect to be bred into our own existence in the same way their own elites -became- &#8216;more white&rsquo; and that is something that is repugnant to people who see them taking over states like California and Texas as Reconquista, without any hint of loyalty to our values.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t breed white, you can only be born to our value systems.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Not quite sure what you mean by that. Also (as it&rsquo;s getting tiresome to point out) there are many whites among the ruling class in Mexico. Just look at Vicent Fox, or indeed any of their presidents  &mdash;  all white! So it&rsquo;s not about race to them, even if it is to you. They see it through different eyes.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the game of racial musical chairs the Mexicans play with each other.  We want no part of their delusions.</p>
<p>Mestizos pretend they aren&rsquo;t colored because they are much lighter than the indians whose ancestry they share.  And they will even go so far as to self-classify themselves as &#8216;towards the pale end of the continuum&rsquo; (i.e. white on a census).</p>
<p>While, unfortunately, what they don&rsquo;t understand is that, to most American whites, even the Mexican elite are still nothing but Hispanic with light features.</p>
<p>We can see it in the facial features and the skin and hair textures and even hear it in the voice.  And it would still be so, even if Mr. Fox had a different surname.</p>
<p>&#8216;Breeding White&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t make you so and is an act which brings with it considerable disgust among many of the white nationalists for what it says of envy and desire to &#8216;be us&rsquo; without having any of the prior traits of personality or history to make it so.</p>
<p>If you add in the current behavior of exploiting white gullibility for personal as much as national (Mexico&rsquo;s) convenience, none of the so called &#8216;whites&rsquo; of Mexico would stand a chance of acceptance here.</p>
<p>Which more or less gives you an idea of why hispanics who are considered physically ugly as well as morally contrived are really despised for their unwanted presence.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
At any rate, it&rsquo;s better to have those &ldquo;conservative Hispanics&rdquo; half-way on our side than not at all. American whites are in such bad shape right now, and so friendless, rejected even by our own politicians, that we can&rsquo;t afford to repudiate any allies, even luke-warm ones. We don&rsquo;t have that luxury.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with this either.  The only way to make an ally out of a politician is to make sure that their deal gets better the longer they associate with you.  Which conversely means that the need you devil-drives agreed to their help with is _never_ going to end.</p>
<p>And since Hispanics are already here, exploiting our kindness and attempting to submerge our culture without our permission or express request, it is a case of accepting that something once wrong can be made right.  Like smiling at a rapist.</p>
<p>Mrs. Melendez is an example of the permanency of compromise that says &#8220;We are never leaving, so assimilate us!&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;We are never leaving so let us have what we want, separately!&#8221; and neither is appealing to a nation whose majority frankly never asked for Hispanics to begin with (nor Blacks).</p>
<p>And now feels that they have been betrayed by a government which has allowed our industry to be sent overseas and leaves us with only a marginal choice between high paying &#8216;service&rsquo; jobs (doctor, lawyer, plumber, electrician) or competing with an underclass in fields which are without margin for those who pay taxes (construction, landscaping, fast food, hotels).</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t see Hispanics as allies because we don&rsquo;t see them as a people but rather as the weapon our own white government has turned on us to destroy our status of living and our way of life.  All to make the rich a little richer and the nation they _own_ as America more competitive in a &#8216;global market&rsquo; whose benefits to ourselves we have yet to see.</p>
<p>If Hispanics didn&rsquo;t, desperately, want what we have, their own insistence upon &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; in staying here as a hostile, alien, culture wouldn&rsquo;t ring so hollow.</p>
<p>As is, they are a substantial reason why we have no negotiating posture with the Elites who are ruining what we built.</p>

		<p>several years ago when I was living in the S.F. Bay area, I had a friend who was a white hispanic that traced her ancestry back to the original Spanish settlers of CA. She would look perfectly native strolling down the streets of Madrid. I was a young and inexperienced lad from the Northeast, so I was surprised by the bitter hatred she received from Mestizos. One time we were out with our mutual friends when a group of Mexicans yelled at her and asked why she was &#8216;acting White&rsquo;! She bravely berated them in Spanish and they backed right off from us since we many of us were ready to fight. <br>
Another eye-opener was a Mestizo I worked with at a warehouse. He had a large tattoo that said &#8216;nortenos&rsquo;. I asked him about it, and he said that was to show he was born in the US and was an enemy of recent immigrants. What a world we live in!!</p>

Only 9% of Mexicans are White, and since they&rsquo;re the elites of Mexico, most of them stay south of the border. I&rsquo;ve seen the ones who claim they&rsquo;re White and they&rsquo;re anything but. Most do not think like us and they&rsquo;re not on our side.</p>

		<p>I see a few often-repeated canards among the comments above.</p>
<p>One of them is the urban legend that &#8216;Irish were not considered White when they first arrived here.&rsquo; Sometimes this same canard is used in relation to the Italians. Where is the evidence of this? The Irish and the Italians were always described in official documents as White. Think about it: up until just a few decades ago there were legal barriers to racial intermarriage, yet both Irish and Italian immigrants intermarried freely with others of European origin. Had they been considered &#8221;non-white&#8221; this could not have happened. It&rsquo;s true that some considered these groups to be of different &#8216;racial&rsquo; stock,<br>
although still White. So may we please put this canard to rest, finally? It is often used by those in favor of mass Third-World immigration, whereby they claim that &#8221;just as the Irish and Italians assimilated, though they were called non-White, the Hispanics will assimilate.&#8221; Please don&rsquo;t add fuel to the open-borders crowd&rsquo;s arguments by assenting to this nonsense.</p>
<p>Another often-heard complaint is that &#8221;there are many White Hispanics&#8221;, with the variant complaint that &#8221;Hispanic is not a race.&#8221; This is a hair-splitting exercise, because the fact is that the vast majority of Hispanics who are immigrating here are not of European/White origin. Can we at least agree on that obvious fact? The fact that there are a number of very White Mexicans is irrelevant, as they are not the ones who are immigrating here by the millions.</p>
<p>One last point: there is a lot of infighting among our people, based on past ethnic grievances, but I see no sign of &#8216;WASP supremacist&rsquo; ideas here or elsewhere. On my erstwhile blog, if I wrote of my own WASP heritage, I took a lot of flak for it. There is no &#8216;WASP supremacy&rsquo; movement; if there is, I&rsquo;ve never encountered it. </p>

		<p>As others have pointed out,  I&rsquo;ve met White Mexicans and some have blue eyes and blonde hair. I&rsquo;ve also been around Mexicans who are purely Spaniard, same goes for some Cubans and South Americans. So there are certainly many White hispanics.</p>

		<p>I was riding on the San Diego trolley, sitting across from a young man carrying several books in Spanish.  He was very tall, slim, very blond, rosy cheeked, milky complexion.  He looked like a picture of someone from one of the Baltic coast countries, most likely. You don&rsquo;t see many people that white in California, nowadays.  I was curious about his origin. I guessed he was maybe a Danish or Dutch tourist (??)   &mdash;   probably in San Diego trying to learn Spanish.  </p>
<p>We got talking, and it turned out that he was a student from Mexico. Had been here only a couple of years. He knew Spanish perfectly, but was still learning English.</p>
<p>Moral:  You can never tell!</p>
<p>This is not to say that he was a typical Mexican, but rather to point out that whites can occur everywhere. We are scattered around the world. We must not turn our backs on our own kind, wherever they happen to be, due to some smug prejudice against &#8220;Hispanics&#8221;. </p>

<p><i>One of them is the urban legend that &lsquo;Irish were not considered White when they first arrived here.&rsquo; Sometimes this same canard is used in relation to the Italians.</i></p>
<p>Italian immigrants have been pretty diverse, and not surprisingly so as there had been a racial division between North and South in Italy. South Italians, particularly those from Sicily brought quite a lot of social problems to America (remember Mafia and its racial mix?), and some migh not consider them white. For an average bystander, it is difficult to tell the difference between a Sicilian mafioso and a Mexican mestizo. So there seems to be a stubborn genotype that defines their (Sicilian and Mexican) inherent incompatibility with Western values and, at the same time, shows common secondary features on their external appearance. If we had enough true geneticists in America, they would have traced the roots of this by now so we would have known where these undesirables come from (is it from South or East, or from the middle?). Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s mostly a taboo, so most of the research results are either fake or weak and disappointingly inconclusive.  </p>
<p>Some posters here seem confused by the interbreeding that blurred the racial divisions. But the mere fact that someone mixes colors is not a proof that colors objectively do not exist. If two parents have very different genotypes, one or another is likely to prevail among their offspring with some regularity that is statistical only. So, you can have, say, a mestizo-looking person that has Caucasian nature from her birth, and you can have a white-looking guy who just looks white but inside is something else. But that is rather rare (statistically unlikely).</p>
<p>One needs to remember that there was a lot of gene trading in the history of Western civilization, and some of it was done for a purpose: to make mimkry of some alien groups easier. Also there was a lot of brood parasitism. These plots complicate things a bit, but I believe that we still can win by playing it safe and take no risk.</p>

		<p>SNAviatrix says that a poll claims 58% of Hispanics are white. Well, according to the census bureau only 47% of Hispanics consider themselves &#8216;white&rsquo; while most of the rest check off &#8216;some other race.&rsquo; And I would be a bit surprised if you did random DNA tests you&rsquo;d find a larger Indian component to the &#8216;white&rsquo; hispanic population versus those who classify as Anglo, non-Hispanic white Americans. Of course most Cubans are white, but they&rsquo;re only 0.5% of the population. I guess the same could be said of Hispainc  Argentines, Urguayians, Spaniards and Costa Ricans. </p>
