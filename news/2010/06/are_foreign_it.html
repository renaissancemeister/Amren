			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Don Tennant, IT Business Edge, June 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An online discussion forum about African Americans in the IT industry caught my eye today, and I was intrigued by the comments posted by one black IT professional in particular. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I say the issue is very important, but as most racially charged subjects in our country, extremely awkward to address. Particularly in light of the abundance of IT workers from other lands that dominate the IT fields, this is a major industry issue. Racism is now being more acceptably practiced through them, when they are given the opportunities.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was in graduate school recently, the classes were disproportionately students from foreign backgrounds and quite often I was the lone African-American student in my classes. There was bias exhibited towards me by most of my classmates that has carried on into my experiences in the workforce afterwards as well. I have nearly 30 years of industry experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not to overgeneralize because of course there are exceptions, but the bias from foreign IT people can be much more severe than from American born and all are consistent in discriminating or questioning your skills, no matter how credentialed you are. {snip} I feel I must be careful in not appearing to be over reacting. But it is frustrating when people can come into your country and discriminate against you and the general society is oblivious to it.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The AA IT is still getting jobs because of AA.  It is very difficult for white IT professionals over 40 to find work because of age and race discrimination, especially from Asian IT department heads.  If those over 40 and over 50 white IT&rsquo;s were finding jobs it would be easier for AA ITs because white are not allowed to discriminate, not even on ability in many cases.  It is nice to see AA suffer a little of what whites have been going through.</p>

<p>Keep reading this forum and you&rsquo;ll learn much that could be very informative for you.</p>
<p>For example, I&rsquo;ve been saying over and over again, that blacks&hellip;especially the black leadership&hellip;just love to crowd in under the non-white umbrella, trying to create an all-inclusive anti-white sentiment among non-whites that there are two camps in this world:  Whites and &#8220;people of color,&#8221; but the fact of the matter is that many non-whites identify with whites and almost all of them detest blacks and want no part of them.</p>
<p>What makes you think non-whites should accept blacks when blacks are prone to crime and violence, unintelligent with few exceptions, and loud, rude, and overbearing?  These deficiencies are not found to any great degree in other non-whites, and they quite simply can&rsquo;t identify with blacks. </p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you people ever want to stay with your own kind in your own land?  Are you completely without pride in your race?</p>

		<p>Well Don, I have two things to say.</p>
<p>I hope you remember that feeling during any discussion of amnesty or the invasion of illegal immigrants currently.  And vote NO to amnesty and YES to closing the borders to ALL immigration from third world countries.  Including Nigeria, Kenya, etc.  Not just closing the borders to further Chinese or Indian immigrants.</p>
<p>Secondly, if Affirmative Action had not been forced on us all, there would BE NO question of your qualifications.  You would not have been hired unless you were qualified.</p>

This guy doesn&rsquo;t seem to understand that foreigners are not responsible for alleged &#8216;historical injustices&rsquo; and have no obligation to atone for alleged past sins (which they never committed).</p>
<p>These people seem to expect and believe that the whole world is supposed to practice American-based &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; and are shocked when they find the world isn&rsquo;t required to do so. </p>

I have a friend (who&rsquo;s white by the way) who works at a very high level IT position at a major insurance company.  At least the impression I get from him is that IT nowadays (at least at large corporations) is no longer based upon skill alone but the combination of skill and the ability to interact with non technical people,i.e. management.  Its no longer enough just to be a unsociable hotshot nerd,especially at the higher levels, its very important to to be able to communicate your ideas across to management team which may not have a technology background.    </p>
<p>All things being equal its even more important nowadays to be able to express yourself clearly to those in charge.  Incidently my friend doesn&rsquo;t fear IT competition from India because of his ability to communicate and interoperate with management.  </p>
<p>I also have another friend of mine,he&rsquo;s white too, who&rsquo;s a programmer and he doesn&rsquo;t worry about job security either, he&rsquo;s just good at his job. </p>
<p>If you have skill,drive and ability to keep up with the latests technology in IT you&rsquo;ll make a good living.  If you just want to go to college get your degree and keep on doing the same thing over and over then become a secretary.  There is no room for mediocrity in IT anymore.</p>

<p>The thing is, affirmative action programs can give you credentials, but they can&rsquo;t give you skills.  IT skills in particular have two characteristics: you can&rsquo;t fake them, and you can&rsquo;t learn them unless you have the aptitude.  In over 30 years in the business I never met a competent black programmer. Their brains just don&rsquo;t work that way.</p>
<p>This writer obviously feels that his paper credentials entitle him to respect from his colleagues, while his colleagues apparently feel that his skills do not.  That&rsquo;s racism.</p>

		<p>Affirmative action has a lot to answer for.  In South Africa in recent years it has displaced white deserving employees (because of their superior abilities) where they are placed under a black manager-apointee to satisfy the AA laws there, and then they end up doing the manager&rsquo;s technical work anyway as they are incapable in most cases according to independent reports.</p>
<p>In &#8220;pursuit of mediocrity&#8221; is never the right way.</p>

		<p>Poster #4 hit the nail on the head!</p>
<p>Black Americans are in for a huge shock.  They happily went along with the &#8216;browning of Amerika,&rsquo; but what they&rsquo;re finding is that other &#8216;people of color&rsquo; not only don&rsquo;t give them the time of day (latino, asian, arab, real African, etc) but that they have no crutch to lean on and wave the stick of white guilt.</p>
<p>The sad thing, however, is the white liberals who also have been supporting this program since 1965.  Now they&rsquo;re finding out that the minorities (majorities) have no time for them either, and much prefer to be led by their own people who look out for them and no others.</p>
<p>I find it so amusing when voodoos protest against this or that ethnic group for &#8216;discriminashun&rsquo; and then the government does nothing to help them (unlike if they were protesting against whites).</p>

		<p>The simple fact is that most Asians, particularly East Asians, have no unreasoning fear of racist attitudes, considering them both normal and realistic. They have, through simple observation and experience, concluded that blacks are, on average, less intelligent and more criminally inclined than other races and would prefer not to associate with them, either professionally or socially.</p>
<p>The simple fact is that most whites feel likewise but are forced by statutory sanctions to so state or act on their inevitable conclusions.  </p>

		<p>Poster #6 mentioned some things about IT people.  Here&rsquo;s another thing.  The most important Programmers, by and large, didn&rsquo;t just come off cold from the street and start a computer degree.  </p>
<p>These guys (and it&rsquo;s always guys) were into computers from ten years old - tearing them apart, rebuilding them, tinkering, writing their own game programs at 12 years old, etc.  In other words, they were immersed in the world of computers, and then they studied computer sciences and got an official degree, but you had the formative years behind them to give them that extra edge.</p>
<p><br>
A lot of blacks and latinos don&rsquo;t have that background.  Some of it is due to poverty, yes, but in the case of latinos, most just did not have computers in their home countries they could do stuff to.  In the case of blacks, ahem, it&rsquo;s not exactly cool in the black community to be a teenage boy and into computers.  </p>
<p>These guys and gals who go into computer science with very little &#8216;formative molding&rsquo; are already at a disadvantage, and Affirmative Action programs cannot bridge that gap, other than to give a person a job who didn&rsquo;t really earn it.</p>
<p>Who do you want to write your software programs?  (The A/A guy or the longtime geek?)  It&rsquo;s a no-brainer.</p>

		<p>Well, Yellow Man, wait until the Indians get into a few management positions. At the company I used to work at, and still have lunch with employees, we were commenting on a meeting where the president of the company was wondering why the Indian manager didn&rsquo;t have any whites in his department.</p>
<p>Since the vast majority of people in this company in the R&D; area are white it didn&rsquo;t make sense. It is common to read that Indians are doing this and there is no evidence that these Indian H-1Bs are really all that good. Most of them are the equivalent of AA degrees.</p>

		<p>While I agree with the sentiments, I disagree with some of the comments. Blacks have a death-lock stranglehold on affirmative action, and to a lesser extent, the mandatory &#8216;sympathy&rsquo; that always must seem to go with it. Even Japanese folks, who have never been out of Japan before, know they are supposed to be deferential towards the great &#8216;suffering&rsquo; of black folks. </p>

		<p>I still think this issue is less racism-based than ability-based. My friend works as an IT professional and over the last 10 years she has seen a significant upswing in Asian/Indian employees and colleagues at other companies. While different feelings about blacks are present among foreign born workers they are not unintelligent people and generally behave according to Marxist American standards.</p>
<p>She finds the bottom line is two-fold. First is a lack of work ethic/company perspective among blacks. It varies but is present to a degree far beyond whites and non-blacks. Second is simply lack of competence - often below mediocrity. In exceptional cases the first problem could be tolerated if the employee was a superb, skilled worker and added to the bottom line. Management could always tackle the work ethic issue and try to at least identify and correct the problem. </p>
<p>Poor performance - especially in IT - is not really something that can be addressed. It&rsquo;s not only too late for remedial training but there&rsquo;s no time for it and it wouldn&rsquo;t help anyway.</p>
<p>The sense of racism being professed by black IT workers is either an excuse for being a lousy or ill-trained employee or simply seeing frustration among colleagues not as exasperation and anger at AA hiring but as something based in racial attitudes. </p>
<p>Good workers and trained staff always are the key - they are retained no matter their skin color or background.</p>

		<p>I watched my IT degree&rsquo;s value sink beneath a wave of cheap H1B visa holders from India.  But even before that black Americans were far and few in IT.  I was able to see what was happening and move into another field.  Apparently this guy still thinks IT jobs are plentiful and bought the whole dog and pony show that ITT Tech or DeVry has been spewing loud and proud since IT hit the toilet a decade ago.  They STILL tell people that &#8220;Computer skills are in demand&#8221; but fail to mention some of those skills are standing at a drive-thru register! <br>
 <br>
But, I respect the people from India for their sheer tenacity.  They have dominated several distinct market verticals including hotels, convenience stores, liquor stores and pretty much all of IT.  The reason for this is that the family can usually afford to super-educate only 1 child, the rest work in service jobs, same as back home!  But the people from India are MUCH smarter than the ones from Mexico.  Indians rarely dump in their own back yard the way Mexicans dump in our back yards.  I have no idea what flag Indians wave at protests for government gimme programs and concessions because they aren&rsquo;t doing that kind of stuff.<br>
 <br>
Yes, I resent watching their cheap, but well-trained IT teams dominate a market that Americans created.  I really resented it when I realized it was undermining my own career.  But I realize that for the most part they are an army of mechanics.  I rarely see the kind of creativity coming from them that created the industry in the first place.  From many I see patchwork code and endless work-arounds.  Sometimes I wonder if they are doing it just to squeeze more money.  Like another group I have experience working with.<br>

		<p>Good comments. Another angle that Don should consider is that Whites are simply less bigoted than the yellows and browns and this has been the case historically as well as in post-racial America. This does not mean that Whites are inherently less racially conscious, but Whites tend to be paternalistic toward other races, instead of domineering. </p>
<p>I find  East Indians in particular to be unjustifiably arrogant in my daily interactions. Not all, but most. It is clear that they see the White man as inferior since we let them into our country and give them IT positions over and above our own racial brethren. </p>

<p>Funny thing about South Africa. The ANC fired most high end white personal from all state owned institutions after 1994. They kept or atleast tried to keep the ground staff and instead of firing them, they allowed them to do all the work with no hope in hell of ever getting a promotion. This happened in the police force, the army, Eskom, Telkom, Transnet, SAA, Sasol, all major state owned enterprises. They thought it would allow them to put themselves and their colleagues into high positions with nice generous salaries while having to do no work. What happened in reality? Well, all white South Africans with expertise built over a lifetime of work simply quit and left their jobs to start their own businesses or they emigrated. The few that stayed now find themselves in the same job position they had 16 years ago. Of course, 16 years down the line, all former state owned enterprises are now bankrupt or close to it and all are needing huge financial aid to keep running. </p>
<p>That is the reality of Affirmative Action in South Africa. Whitey stays and does all the work while darkie gets all the rewards and benefits. In the short term it looks great for blacks but in the long term the results are detrimental to the infrastructure and the economy. A good example would be Eskom, where for years since 1994 the black CEOs made massive profits off the whites back, and paid themselves hefty salaries and bonuses. Now that the truth is out and rolling black outs blanket South Africa, who has to pay? The tax payer, and who pays the tax in South Africa? You guessed it, the whites.</p>
<p>The lesson to be learnt? Affirmative Action does not work!!!</p>
<p>This black &#8220;IT&#8221; specialist needs to learn that the best way to prove people wrong is do it yourself and show them that you can do what you say. To cry and moan will simply make them more prejudiced towards you. Blacks seem to have a hard time getting that, I wonder why?  </p>

<p>That describes anyone who works at a high level anywhere in the hard sciences   &mdash;   They had to have gotten interested in it at a very young age, and as Michio Kaku once pointed out, if you&rsquo;re not interested a scientific field in a really intense fashion before you hit puberty, you&rsquo;ll never be a top scientist.  In fact, most top scientists did most of their learning before they hit puberty, because the opposite gender (or, these days, the same gender) becomes too big a distraction after puberty, and adulthood is replete with paperwork, grant applications, and so on.</p>

<p>Indian predominance over hotels and quick shops hasn&rsquo;t exactly occurred on the up and up.  A lawyer I once knew handed me down an article from a Missouri State Bar publication from about 15 years ago, at least 15 years ago from now.  It was long and convoluted, but it detailed how a lot of these Indians engage in financial fraud to manipulate and scheme their way into buying hotels and quick shops.  A crucial element to the scam is the fact that in India, many surnames are synonymous with the family occupation   &mdash;   For instance, &#8220;Patel&#8221; (or some variation in spelling) means innkeeper, and a family with the Patel surname are innkeepers.  Those named &#8220;Patels&#8221; are able to piggyback on each other in the loan application and Small Business Loan process; I can&rsquo;t remember all the details.</p>

<p>Irrespective of color, I always recommend to any young software writer that he should always be coding something and should keep some notes or program listing with him frequently, so that whenever there is an idle moment, he can review and amend his notes or program listing.</p>
<p>Once people see that he is always coding and that he has some running programs, he should never worry about racism   &mdash;   the proof is in the programming!</p>
<p>Have a pleasant evening to all and thank you for lending me your ear.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Indians engage in financial fraud to manipulate and scheme their way into buying hotels and quick shops. &#8220;</p>
<p>Although there are bad apples in any ethnic group I personally know believe that success is directly correlated to hard work.  Retailers work hard, there is no doubt about it but some work alot harder than others.   There is an Indian owned videostore that I used to go to and it was open until 2:00 am.  I think alot of things affect success but no matter how talented you are its usually effort that is the strongest predictor.  </p>
