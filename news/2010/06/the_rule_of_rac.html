<h1>The Rule of Racial Preferences</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Virgil Goode, Front Page Magazine, June 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} My former colleague Congressman Steve King (R-IA) recently tried to initiate a discussion, and the Democrats and politically correct Republicans are castigating him.</p>
<p>Rep. King told a talk show host that &#8220;the president has demonstrated that he has a default mechanism in him that breaks down the side of race  &mdash;  on the side that favors the black person.&#8221; He stood by his remarks stating that there &#8220;appears to me to be an inclination on the part of the White House and the Justice Department and perhaps others within the administration to break on the side of favoritism with regard to race.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>President Obama supports racial preferences for blacks and Hispanics over whites and Asians in education and hiring. During the 2008 election, the African American conservative Ward Connerly sponsored ballot initiatives in Colorado and Kansas stating &#8220;The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.&#8221; Obama opposed the initiatives stating they are &#8220;designed to drive a wedge between people.&#8221;</p>
<p>During his four years a Senator, Obama never voted against the NAACP&rsquo;s position on an issue.</p>
<p>Several recent incidents during his presidency provide additional fodder for Rep. King&rsquo;s statement.</p>
<p>President Obama and Attorney General Holder have sued small towns without even accusing them of disenfranchising blacks, but they dismissed a complaint against voter intimidation against whites during the presidential election.</p>
<p>The Justice Department filed a claim against the town of Lake Park, FL to make the town of 9,000 change from electing their commissioners from an at large seat into gerrymandered districts where &#8220;black persons would constitute a majority of the citizen voting age population in at least one of the districts&#8221; with the explicit goal of promoting &#8220;black electoral success.&#8221;</p>
<p>Compare this to how they treated the New Black Panther Party intimidating white voters. {snip} The Justice Department dismissed this complaint without giving any explanation.</p>
<p>The same double standard applies to so called hate crimes. Immediately after assuming office, President Obama promoted a massive expansion in hate crimes enforcement.</p>
<p>While the legislation was being debated Senators Jeff Sessions (R-AL) and Tom Coburn (R-OK) asked about both hypothetical instances where whites, Christians, or military members would be assaulted and if such would qualify as hate crimes. Attorney General Holder responded that hate crimes legislation &#8220;would not necessarily cover that&#8221; and was designed to cover &#8220;protected groups.&#8221; {snip} In other words: not whites and Christians.</p>
<p>While African Americans have been targeted for violence in the past, today it is whites who are more likely to be victims of interracial crime.</p>
<p>According to the FBI&rsquo;s latest National Crime Victimization Survey, Blacks were over 50 times more likely to commit a crime against whites than vice versa. There were over 14,000 black on white rapes and the number of white on black rapes was so small, it did not show up on FBI&rsquo;s statistical samples. That same year, the FBI did not report a single anti-black rape hate crime.</p>
<p>{snip} But the truth is that President Obama appears to be more concerned about stopping virtually non-existent &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; against &#8220;protected groups&#8221; than stopping actual committed crimes.</p>

		<p>Obama and others of his ilk are plainly racists. It&rsquo;s just that they believe their racism is righteous. </p>

		<p>One term and out, the hope and change experiment is proving to be a fraud and a failure. Who&rsquo;s out there that we can vote for with a clear conscience come the next election? The general disgruntlement of the majority of people seems to me to be deepening, and the continuing stability of the country becomes questionable. I can&rsquo;t see how we can go forward into the future with this crew of small minded people who advance the interests of their narrow faction only. And most of us aren&rsquo;t in that faction.   </p>

		<p>I think Obummer hates his white side although it provided him  his intellect while his black side got him the job via aff-action. If he were all white he would never have made it as a politician and if he were all black he would never have passed the bar.</p>

<p>The most hateful blacks have white in them:  Malcolm X, Louis Farrakhan, Obama, and Eric Holder (well, he looks mixed to me)</p>

		<p>And the funny (or scary) part about all this is the way white people have fawned over Obama.</p>
<p>Of course Obama lived in a white part of Chicago, was a member of Chicago&rsquo;s most exclusive health club and went to some of the city&rsquo;s best restaurants.</p>
<p>And like in Washington D.C. he paid thousands of dollars a year to send his kids to predominately white private schools just to keep them out of Chicago&rsquo;s wonderful all-black public schools. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;President Obama is keeping his ear to the ground. </p>
<p>Recently, he invited a race-based coalition of bloggers, &ldquo;Blogging While Brown,&rdquo; to meet with Corey Ealons, the White House director of &ldquo;African-American Media,&rdquo; at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The White House meeting was about &ldquo;&rdquo;letting them know we are open and available for conversation  &mdash;  a two-way conversation.&rdquo; </p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but scratch my chin and wonder: would President Obama be willing to have a similar &ldquo;two-way conversation&rdquo; with an alliance of bloggers called &ldquo;Blogging While White&rdquo; and respond to the concerns of the White community? Maybe he could chat with the leading voices of the White community about their concerns about, hell, I don&rsquo;t know &hellip; </p>
<p>&hellip; the evacuation of the Gulf States? </p>
<p>It would certainly be smart politics. 91% of black voters support the Obama administration. In 2008, Obama lost the White vote, and that was before Obamacare, the Gulf Oil Spill, the Wall Street bailouts, and the Tea Party took their toll on his popularity. </p>
<p>To be sure, &ldquo;structural racism&rdquo; exists in America: blacks can organize as blacks and advocate black interests while getting invited to the White House by the President of the United States himself. On the other hand, the Tea Party is demonized by the Left and charged with &ldquo;racism&rdquo; for no other reason than being appealing to Whites. </p>
<p>Am I the only one who notices this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Only the left is allowed to segregate by color. Racial Profiling has its perks.<br>
