			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rochelle Sharpe and Maggie Mulvihill, Boston Globe, June 17, 20109</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gates [Henry Louis Gates Jr.], who is African-American, described his arrest as a &#8220;teaching moment&#8221; about race relations in America.</p>
<p>His case drew national attention to the relationship between policing and race. {snip}</p>
<p>But a review of the Cambridge department&rsquo;s handling of disorderly conduct cases from 2004 to 2009 finds no evidence of racial profiling. Instead, the analysis by the New England Center for Investigative Reporting finds that the most common factor linking people who are arrested in Cambridge for disorderly conduct is that they were allegedly screaming or cursing in front of police.</p>
<p>Of the 392 adults arrested for disorderly conduct, 57 percent were white, and 34 percent were black. That racial breakdown almost exactly mirrored the racial composition of the population that Cambridge police investigated for disorderly conduct, the center&rsquo;s analysis shows.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The most striking conclusion of the review of Cambridge police data is that the majority of those arrested for disorderly conduct were allegedly yelling, often screaming obscenities, in front of police before the handcuffs snapped shut. More than 60 percent of the disorderly arrests reviewed by center involved some sort of allegedly inflammatory speech, such as talking back to the police, more commonly known as &#8220;contempt of cop.&#8221;</p>
<p>A substantial minority of those arrested for the crime also shared another trait: 17 percent of them were homeless.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Gates controversy began last July, when Crowley [Sgt. James Crowley] arrested Gates for disorderly conduct outside his home, after responding to a dispatcher&rsquo;s call about a potential break-in at the house. According to the police report, Gates became uncooperative during the incident. &#8220;Is this how you treat a black man in America?&#8221; Gates recalled saying at the time.</p>
<p>When Crowley asked to speak with him outside his home, Gates replied, &#8220;Ya, I&rsquo;ll speak with your mama outside,&#8221; according to the police report.</p>
<p>Cambridge Police Commissioner Robert C. Haas, who declined to comment on the Gates case, said that speech is never the sole basis for an arrest.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Haas called the Gates incident &#8220;a major crisis&#8221; for his department. He said his department conducted a study of its use of disorderly conduct charges between 2004 and 2008. The analysis, which also concluded race was not an issue, will be posted on the department&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ogletree [Harvard Law professor Charles Ogletree, Gates&rsquo;s lawyer] is promoting a new book about racial injustice, entitled &#8220;The Presumption of Guilt: The Arrest of Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Race, Class, and Crime in America.&#8221; In it, he compares the Gates arrest to the 1991 beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles, which led to race riots.</p>
<p>In an interview, Ogletree said he did not request any arrest data from the Cambridge police nor did he interview police officials or Crowley.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Gates arrest prompted changes at the Cambridge Police Department. Now, every time officers charge someone with disorderly conduct, they must thoroughly document why they made the arrest. Officers are also receiving training intended to make them more aware of how they react when citizens get angry at them.</p>
<p>Two other reviews sparked by the Gates arrest are underway in Cambridge. This summer, a 12-member committee of law enforcement specialists and academics from around the country plans to release its analysis of &#8220;lessons learned&#8221; from the incident.</p>

		<p>The main question that remains unanswered from the incident is whether this was all a pre-planned stunt by Prof. Gates, to get his name back into the news cycle.</p>
<p>What is interesting to me is why there would be any homelessness or cussing at cops in a city that is supposed to be so progressive and educated as Cambridge.  </p>

		<p>Then they do &#8220;act stupidly&#8221;.</p>
<p>If White policeman don&rsquo;t have an instinct about the criminality of blacks that directs them in keeping the public safe, then we should all boycott Cambridge.  Too many un-arrested blacks roaming around because the cops are color blind.</p>
<p>Color blindness is akin to Race Treason.<br>

		<p>Gates&rsquo; strident public whining made national headlines for weeks on end.  Now we finally have proof that he was just shooting his mouth off, and the information is buried in an obscure page of the Boston Globe.</p>
<p>No serious-faced &#8220;news&#8221; announcers, no indignant presidential press conferences, no frenzied &#8220;in-depth interviews&#8221; with &#8220;civil rights leaders&#8221; blustering and threatening all the Evil White Racists. </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s wrong with this picture?<br>

		<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Ogletree [Harvard Law professor Charles Ogletree, Gates&rsquo;s lawyer] is promoting a new book about racial injustice, entitled &#8216;The Presumption of Guilt: The Arrest of Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Race, Class, and Crime in America.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I wonder how much of ogletree&rsquo;s new book is plagiarized? After all, he (and tribe) received passes from elena kagan when caught plagiarizing in 2004. Do you think anyone on the Senate Judiciary Committee will question kagan about her blatant double standard and what she believes constitutes fairness?</p>
<p>&#8221;..As Dean of Harvard Law School in 2004 and 2005 [kagan] treated two liberal law professors with kid gloves when they were busted for plagiarism. Her chicanery was so blatant that even a leftist academic said she should be fired for her &#8216;whitewash.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She let the professors off easy for the kind of offense for which any Harvard undergraduate or law student would have been suspended if not expelled.</p>
<p>Ogletree, who taught both Michelle Obama and Barack Obama at Harvard Law School&hellip; blamed it on his research assistants.</p>
<p>Ogletree was not suspended&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/3am5bef" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/3am5bef</a></p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;In an interview, Ogletree said he did not request any arrest data from the Cambridge police nor did he interview police officials or Crowley&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>No, of course not.  Why would he be interested in interviewing Crowley?  Ogletree has already made up his mind that ALL White police officers (make that ALL Whites) are racists.   Promoting black racial victimization IS his meal ticket, the book tour will earn him a ton of money and the propaganda media will fawn over him, ask him softball questions and hang on his every word about White police brutality and racial injustice.</p>
<p>And no one will dare call him out.</p>

		<p>The importance of this incident wasnt about Gates or the police<br>
It was the first exposure of Obama as an ideologically driven<br>
leftist with no mental flexibility The incident served its purpose. I wonder how many Blacks even realize that.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d love to see them annouce the finding that no lessons were learned, because everything was done correctly in the first place.</p>

		<p>I am sure president Obama and Gates are going to have another beer summit so they can apologize to the police officer who detained Mr. Gates. While we are waiting for that to happen we can sit back and watch the virus of political correctness replace logic and destroy the fabric of the United States. The story initially accusing the police of racism and Obama&rsquo;s comment accusing the police of &#8220;acting stupidly&#8221;, were front page news in the national and local news papers in the United States. I have a feeling you won&rsquo;t be seeing the review of the Gates/Police incident and this article on the front page of any local or national news paper,it will be buried on page fifteen next to the comics.This article and the review will later be thrown down the memory hole.Also don&rsquo;t hold your breath waiting for the Obama and Gates beer summit apology.</p>

		<p>Re: Rodney King, when you try to explain what he did to precipitate the situation, people look at you like you&rsquo;re from Neptune. Yet, King has continued to get in trouble with the law long after he was depicted as a martyr by black America. It reminds me of a black youth in New York who accused the police of brutality, and when a fund was set up to support him, the &#8220;victim&#8221; took the money for himself, went out partying at strip clubs, filmed it and put it up on his Myspace account for the world to see. </p>
<p>You just know Gates was salivating at the prospect of getting to play the victim role. As a tenured professor with a cushy upper-middle class life he must have been feeling insecure over his estrangement from the black underclass who actually are involved in a life and death struggle. Officer Crowley gave him his chance to shine, to teach (run his mouth), and probably even milk a documentary out of the incident.</p>
<p>As a white male, with all of the supposed attendant privileges, even I wouldn&rsquo;t have mouthed off to the police like that, without the expectation that I might go to jail and get my self kicked. What a joke. </p>

<p>   I&rsquo;m a news junkie who devotes constant attention to newspapers, Internet, television and radio news. This is the first time I&rsquo;ve heard this story. Once again, the controlled media censors stories they don&rsquo;t like by ignoring them. I&rsquo;ve heard nothing from National Public Radio (who seemed to believe in Dr. Gates&lsquo; persecution) about this important story.</p>

		<p>Ogletree is FAR LEFT and Black.  These two factors will probably get him a nomination to the high court, if Obama has another chance for an appointment.</p>
