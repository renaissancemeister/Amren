<h1><a href="http://www.memphisdailynews.com/editorial/Article.aspx?id=50633">Herenton: Voters Need to Send &#8216;Just One&rsquo; African-American to Congress</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bill Dries, Memphis Daily News, June 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As he gears up for the Aug. 5 Democratic congressional primary, former Memphis Mayor Willie Herenton came out swinging this week, guaranteeing a victory because &#8220;no other African-American got in this race.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He also unveiled the new &#8220;Just One&#8221; campaign slogan for the 9th Congressional District race.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The campaign slogan is a reference to an interview earlier this year on the Thaddeus Matthews radio program when Herenton was making his case for having one black congressman in the Tennessee delegation to Washington.</p>
<p>Matthews later blogged &#8220;Why can&rsquo;t blacks have just one representative?&#8221; It echoed a similar remark Matthews made during the interview.</p>
<p>Herenton is touting 100,000 direct mail campaign ads with the now famous flyer showing Tennessee&rsquo;s all-white Washington delegation and asking, &#8220;What&rsquo;s wrong with this picture?&#8221; along with the slogan &#8220;Just One Herenton.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also took shots at his Aug. 5 opponent, U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know how Cohen was elected (in the 2006 Democratic Congressional primary)?&#8221; Herenton asked. &#8220;He played a race card. They knew that every black who thought he was somebody  &mdash;  they would get in the race.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cohen, one of 15 candidates in the 2006 primary race, was in Washington and didn&rsquo;t respond directly.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Herenton also continued taking shots at federal prosecutors, who he said unfairly targeted him for corruption charges that never came despite a grand jury investigation of his private business affairs and a target letter from prosecutors.</p>

		<p>I think Tennessee already has a black congressman.  His name is Steve Cohen.  Oh yeah, I don&rsquo;t let the face paint fool me   &mdash;   He votes 100% black, and is part of the Congressional Black Caucus.</p>

		<p>  As bad as Herenton is, Cohen, his rival, is even worse. Cohen is a full blown cultural Marxist and liberal ideologue( he scored 100 on the NAACP&#8221;s scorecard for members of Congress), while Herenton is just a typical, garden variety black politician-pompous, vain, pretentious and self-centered. What a choice Memphians have!</p>

		<p>Cohen will always be elected because he promotes the &#8220;Holocaust Studies&#8221; in public schools.   That&rsquo;s sort of like basing your ministry upon saying you support praying to Jesus in Christian churches.</p>
<p>Cohen has the Jewish Money behind him, so no black can defeat him.  That cash flows through the black &#8220;community&#8221;.  Blacks are smart enough to know how to vote for the Jew when money actually flows their way, and not vote for the black king who keeps all for himself once in office.</p>

<p>Not a thing.  Why is a group of White people considered &#8220;wrong?&#8221;  </p>
<p>Is it permitted for any White candidates for any office at all to point to a photograph of the Congressional Black Caucus and ask &#8220;What&rsquo;s wrong with this picture?&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s just &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; for Tennessee not to have even one black in Congress.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just criminal for Tennesse to have even one black in Congress, because his first, last and only concern will be nobody and nothing but the advancement of blacks and black causes.  He will do nothing for Tennessee but make it a worse place to live.</p>
<p>The best they have is Obama, and he&rsquo;s so incompetent he&rsquo;s out to lunch on every issue but how to remain in campaign mode 24/7, and his ability and performance is really sub-standard.</p>
<p>Who needs more blacks who are even less intelligent than Obama,  and who behave worse and are infinitely more incompetent?</p>

		<p> Steve Cohen is not a member of the Congressional Black Caucus. He was not allowed membership because he is not Black. Even though he represents a predominately Black district in congress In contrast, former Hawaii Congressman Neil Ambercrombie was a member of the Asian Pacific congressional caucus.</p>

		<p>I moved to Memphis in 1988 before Herenton was elected, largely to get away from the high crime rate in Washington. Two years later, Herenton was elected as Memphis&rsquo; first black mayor. When I left in 2004, he was still the mayor. Last year I read that Memphis had became the second most dangerous city in the US. </p>
