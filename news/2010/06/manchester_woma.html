			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lynne Tuohy, Concord Monitor, June 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Beatrice Munyenyezi, 40, of Manchester was indicted yesterday on two counts of lying to obtain U.S. citizenship.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors say Munyenyezi directed kidnapping, rape and murder during the genocide, in which about 800,000 people were killed during an ethnic bloodletting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prosecutors say Munyenyezi lied about her connection to the genocide when applying for entry into the United States in 1995. Because of the genocide, the State Department developed a Rwandan questionnaire in an attempt to weed out genocide participants. Munyenyezi denied having any role in the genocide.</p>
<p>She entered New York City in March 1998 as a refugee. On April 29, 2003, Munyenyezi was sworn in as a U.S. citizen in Concord.</p>

		<p>The shame of the United States is that many of the criticisms that liberals have levied against us, that USED to be lies, are now true because we have tolerated liberalism.</p>
<p>They would have us believe the US has been guilty of genocide.  That was a lie.  Now, it&rsquo;s true, literally&hellip;..because we let those guilty of genocide come here.</p>

<p>Well, there is an unexpected surprise, someone who participated in a genocide was less than forthcoming on the &ldquo;Rwandan questionnaire.&rdquo; In this day and age, you would get Mao or Stalin as  &ldquo;good immigrant&rdquo; neighbors, and quite possibly Himmler as you next county sheriff, simply because they &ldquo;unintentionally&rdquo; filled out some form inaccurately when they came here to be &ldquo;law abiding citizens,&rdquo; through unorthodox and unfortunate circumstances. </p>
<p>Ugh!</p>

		<p>If it was a scandal for Nazi war criminals to enter the U.S., then how come it isn&rsquo;t a scandal for Rwandan war criminals to do likewise?  Take a guess.  </p>

		<p>  I was actually surprised on a recent trip to New Hampshire, one of the whitest states, by the number of black (Muslim?) immigrants in the Concord/Manchester areas. I wonder if Mark Steyn knows; I thought he moved to that state to avoid them?</p>

<p>If that&rsquo;s the case, she should be granted citizenship.  Why?  Just look at all the Somalis here who undoubtedly participated in mass killings on a daily basis, since they all get high on drugs and each one has a weapon.  All of them belong to one warlord&rsquo;s command or another and the killing is constantly ongoing.   Too, were any of them here part of the mob that dragged our dead soldiers through the streets with smiles on their faces several years ago?</p>
<p>Jamaican and Haitian drug gangs are rife within this country, plus they commit many other crimes.  Blacks born here are about 12% of the population, yet they commit 58% of all violent crime, plus a far greater percentage of overall crime than their representation in this society.  On average they rape 37,500 white women per year.  Wherever they live and go to school, they create chaos, violence, discord and they&rsquo;re loud, abusive, stupid and are on a mental par with children.</p>
<p>After evaluating the foregoing and much, much more black pathologies, I don&rsquo;t see how a fair-mnded person could conclude that this woman would not fit in nicely with the black communities already here.</p>
<p>Actually, I think if she pushed it she would have a pretty good case for discrimination.</p>

		<p>To poster #5.  </p>
<p>This is the problem in a nutshell.  Because the alleged mass-murderer is black, liberal activists do not come forward to denounce her and get her deported.  If such a person was white, you can be sure that protesters would be marching at her door and lots of other protest things would be going on.</p>
<p>Liberals, strangely enough, do not criticize black people (or brown people) who kill their own.  This has been demonstrated over and over through the years.  Think about any third world hell hole where the leaders are killing their own people, or organized crime lords are doing evil deeds every day.  </p>
<p>Liberals never protest against them and oftentimes skew the argument to make it seem like whitey&rsquo;s fault, but evil multinational corporations or the G20 summit?  Whoa!  Gotta protest that and burn cars too.  Better be careful not to lose my Ipod, though.</p>

		<p>Not to be rude or nothin&rsquo; but why is this our concern?  How many hundreds of thousands of dollars in billable hours are U.S. taxpayers going to have to pay to resolve this &#8216;test cheaters&rsquo; mixup with immigration?</p>
<p>As tragedies go, Rwanda is right up there on the &#8216;nobody cares that they are humans too&rsquo; list of callous events in recent history (keeping in mind this happened shortly after Somalia as I recall so we were not exactly motivated to uplift Africa&hellip;).</p>
<p>But as far as I can tell, the most this woman can be got for is cheerleading and possibly aiding and abetting and maybe minor theft after the fact.  In our nation, that would be good for maybe 12-18 months, dealed down to 6 with a year or two of probation.</p>
<p>Even given the violence of the situation as a whole, there&rsquo;s no knifework or rape in the accusation worthy of all this legal expense, not just for a trial but also a decade long sentence at 30-40,000 dollars a year to stuff her in a box.</p>
<p>-Especially- if we are just delaying the inevitable when she does life or a noose back in Tanzania.</p>
<p>Now, with that out there, is there something like a law of extradition which we share with Rwanda or the International Courts?</p>
<p>If so and she truly did lie on her application, just strip her citizenship and boot her butt on out of the country.  Don&rsquo;t make a major production out of it with OUR tax dollars.</p>
<p>I swear, if you want the real source of the severe case of the stupids which is afflicting this nation at the moment, sometimes you really just need to find a mirror.</p>
