<h1><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/jun/30/disease-rife-countries-low-iqs">Lower IQs Found in Disease-Rife Countries, Scientists Claim</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ian Sample, The Guardian, June 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>People who live in countries where disease is rife may have lower IQs because they have to divert energy away from brain development to fight infections, scientists in the US claim.</p>
<p>The controversial idea might help explain why national IQ scores differ around the world, and are lower in some warmer countries where debilitating parasites such as malaria are widespread, they say.</p>
<p>Researchers behind the theory claim the impact of disease on IQ scores has been under-appreciated, and believe it ranks alongside education and wealth as a major factor that influences cognitive ability.</p>
<p>Attempts to measure intelligence around the world are fraught with difficulty and many researchers doubt that IQ tests are a suitable tool for the job. The average intelligence of a nation is likely to be governed by a complex web of interwoven factors.</p>
<p>The latest theory, put forward by Randy Thornhill and others at the University of New Mexico, adds disease to a long list of environmental and other issues that may all play a role in determining intelligence. Thornhill made the news in 2000, when he coauthored a provocative book called A Natural History of Rape in which he argues that sexual coercion emerged as an evolutionary adaptation.</p>
<p>Writing in the journal, Proceedings of the Royal Society, Thornhill and his colleagues explain that children under five devote much of their energy to brain development. When the body has to fight infections, it may have to sacrifice brain development, they say.</p>
<p>To test the idea, Thornhill&rsquo;s group used three published surveys of global IQ scores and compared them with data from the World Health Organisation (WHO) on how badly infectious diseases affect different countries. The list included common infections, such as malaria, tetanus and tuberculosis.</p>
<p>The scientists found that the level of infectious disease in a country was closely linked to the average national IQ. The heavier the burden of disease, the lower the nation&rsquo;s IQ scores. Thornhill believes that nations who have lived with diseases for long periods may have adapted, by developing better immune systems at the expense of brain function.</p>
<p>&#8220;The effect of infectious disease on IQ is bigger than any other single factor we looked at,&#8221; said Chris Eppig, lead author on the paper. &#8220;Disease is a major sap on the body&rsquo;s energy, and the brain takes a lot of energy to build. If you don&rsquo;t have enough, you can&rsquo;t do it properly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The consequence of this, if we&rsquo;re right, is that the IQ of a nation will be largely unaffected until you can lift the burden of disease,&#8221; Eppig added.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s an interesting and provocative finding,&#8221; said Geraint Rees, director of the UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience. &#8220;It explains about 50 to 60% of the variability in IQ scores and appears to be independent of some other factors such as overall GDP.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The authors suggest that more infectious disease could lead to lower IQ scores through an impact on brain development. This is an interesting speculation, but the data don&rsquo;t prove it one way or the other,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A bigger problem is that it might be driven by a third factor, that affects both infectious disease prevalence and IQ test scores.&#8221;</p>
<p>For reasons that are unclear, IQ scores are generally rising around the world. Thornhill suggests monitoring rates of infectious diseases in nations as they develop, to see if they decline and IQ tests scores rise.</p>
<p>Richard Lynn, professor of psychology at Ulster University, and author of the 2002 book, IQ and the Wealth of Nations, said disease and IQ is a two-way relationship, with low national IQs being partly responsible for widespread infectious diseases.</p>
<p>&#8220;In recent decades, HIV has been a serious infectious disease, and it has a high infection rate in low IQ countries, especially in southern Africa, where it is present in around 30% of the population.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This is attributable to the low IQ of the population who do not understand the way the infection is contracted, and have erroneous beliefs about how to prevent infection.&#8221;<br>

		<p>People who live in countries where disease is rife may have lower IQs because they have to divert energy away from brain development to fight infections, scientists in the US claim&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..Cause and effect. Could it be that people with low I.Q.s are the cause of the fact that their is so much disease.It has only been 200 years ago when people (white people) discovered what caused disease but for thousands of years white people by instinct realized how to prevent disease. The ancient Romans had a city of a million people. They piped in water from the mountains rather than drink water from the polluted Tiber river. The had a covered sewer system rather than the open sewers that you might find in Africa which also serve as streets. Heck there is a city in England called Bath because the Romans liked taking baths. I always thought that our ancestors migrated to cooler climates in order to avoid disease spread mosquitoes.</p>

<p>Sorry, but scientists have a reputation now for outright lying for the sake of political correcness, so they can no longer be relied upon to tell the truth.</p>
<p>All their findings are now suspect.  They&rsquo;re very close in reputation to used car salesmen anymore.</p>

		<p>I believe it is the other way around, low IQ populations lack the ability to try or know how to prevent disease or to develop drugs to cure diseases and they produce environments that foster diseases such as slums.</p>

<p>And a lot of these disease can either be controlled or eliminated by very simple measures taken by the local populace. Mosquito netting, kept in good shape. Taking micro-nutrient supplements as the part of the daily diet, not allowing pools of water to stand where mosquitos breed, using soap and water on a regular basis. etc.</p>
<p>I recall reading some time ago that there was a particular disease, fly-borne, that caused about 1/3 of the over 50 age population of sub-Saharan Africa to either go blind or lose a good percentage of their vision. Can be PREVENTED BY THE DAILY USE OF SOAP AND WATER.</p>

		<p>An easy way to find out would be to study people whose ancestors came from those low-I.Q. countries and test their I.Q.&rsquo;s.  The tests would have to be carried out in nations where disease is not so rampant, such as the U.S.  As a matter of fact, such studies have already been done time and time again and they show the same low I.Q.&rsquo;s as in their ancestral lands (taking into account racial admixture from the native population).  So, as others have said, this is just so much smoke and mirrors from the Orthodox establishment and another desperate attempt to cover up the genetic/racial aspects of I.Q.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s so special about this. Disease has been known for a long time to directly depress IQ scores.</p>

		<p>The arguement is that the diseases of Africa repress <br>
brain development.  So why havent blacks in the USA<br>
made dramatic IQ improvements? Instead we have a well<br>
fed population free of major diseases, but whose entire<br>
mental life consists of sports, food, sex, and violence?</p>

		<p>Of course, the article doesn&rsquo;t explain why certain ethnic groups continue to have low average IQ&rsquo;s even when their members, for several generations, have been born and bred in industrialized, relatively low-disease-rate nations.  <br>
It seems that many scientists will claim such phony conclusions to keep out of the firing line of the liberal media, yet anyone reading the data can clearly see the true cause and effect.</p>

		<p>The truth is starting to come out, slowly but surely. </p>
<p>I noticed that the New York Times got dangerously close to discussing race and IQ in two different articles, in today&rsquo;s and yesterday&rsquo;s editions. </p>
<p>Of course, they didn&rsquo;t use a ten-foot pole to come even close to discussing this topic honestly, but at least they printed the actual word &#8220;IQ&#8221; more than once. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, NPR asks in today&rsquo;s online edition : &#8220;Can Genes Make You Murder?&#8221; (See: https://tinyurl.com/38xeuot). </p>
<p>Of course, as soon as I saw this I knew what NPR was going to do. There were no surprises either: the article features a brutal murderer who is, naturally, a white male. </p>
<p>I posted the comment below on their web (to my utter amazement, my comment appeared along with the others. I doubt it will remain up for long, though). </p>
<p>&hellip;/&hellip;</p>
<p>NPR.ORG COMMENT RE: &#8216;CAN GENES MAKE YOU MURDER?&rsquo;</p>
<p><br>
When I saw this article I knew what NPR was doing, and I knew that the perp was going to be a white male. </p>
<p>Sure enough, I scrolled down and saw that NPR had stuck to their usual narrative. </p>
<p>And for good measure, they first showed the black detective who was responsible for busting this evil white male. </p>
<p>Adult black males (bm&rsquo;s) are only 4% of the US population but they commit 60% of the violent crime (Department of Justice crime stats). </p>
<p>But of course NPR will never say this, nor will they likely post this comment. </p>
<p>It would be noble and honourable if they did - an affirmation of NPR&rsquo;s commitment to free speech - but free speech and hate facts are something that the loony white-hating left finds despicable. </p>
<p>Shame on you NPR for skewing the facts about violent crime and the genetic predispositions that lead to it. <br>

		<p>Richard Lynn is right.  As anyone who&rsquo;s ever looked at IQ studies can tell you, people who have moved to a more civilized country retain their IQs.</p>
<p>Koreans who move to Belgium will still have higher IQs than your typical Belgians.  Whereas Somalis who move&hellip; anywhere except where Australian abos or pygmy people live, will still be stupider than your average human.  </p>
