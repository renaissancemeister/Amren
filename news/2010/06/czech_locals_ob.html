<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Plans to erect a MICHAEL JACKSON statue in the Czech Republic have been met with criticism by locals, who argue the late King of Pop had no real connection to the country.</p>
<p>City officials in Prague have approved a request by a group of Jackson fans to place a six foot (1.83 metre) tall tribute to the Thriller hitmaker in Letna Park, where the singer performed in 1996.</p>
<p>The column, featuring a bronze bust of the superstar, was due to be unveiled on what would have been Jackson&rsquo;s 52nd birthday on 29 August (10).</p>
<p>But thousands of Czech residents are angry at the prospect of having a statue of the singer in Prague and local art gallery bosses have proposed installing a piece of work by a contemporary Czech artist instead.</p>
<p>Jackson died a year ago last Friday (25Jun10).<br>

		<p>I suppose this shows that even the politicians in the Czech Republic aren&rsquo;t immune to the forces of multiculturalism. That they have even considered erecting a statue to someone with no connection to the country, was charged with child molestation, and was known equally well for their bizarre lifestyle as for their artistic achievements seems illogical and irresponsible. I usually associate statues statues and other monuments with local or national figures of lasting achievement, not with internationally famous pop culture artists.  </p>

		<p>Czechs, along with other Central and Eastern Europeans, are part of the vanguard of Worldwide White Nationalism.  </p>
<p>Bravo to the Czechs for protesting against the glorification of a pathetic Bantu freak with musical skill.  Michael Jackson could sing and dance, but he was a disgusting creature in so many ways.</p>
<p>Czech pride!</p>

		<p>Oh boy, multiculturalism at its best! - A Michael Jackson statue in the Czech Republic.  How ridiculous can it get?</p>
<p>But you know, the thing I wonder about is who these &#8220;City officials&#8221; are and why they would agree to such a ridiculous proposal in their country?  I guess even in the Czech Republic people fear appearing &#8220;racist&#8221;.</p>

		<p>On reading the headline - before I clicked over - I thought they were talking about Jesse.  I couldn&rsquo;t make a connection between Jesse and Prague.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good thing.  It shows me that - until I read the article - I had forgotten all about that nightmare named Michael.</p>

		<p>I want to commend the Czechs for not wanting a monument to Michael Jackson. While he was talented, what relevance does he hold for the average Czech? Take that statue and ship it to Gary, Indiana, they will put it somewhere. </p>
<p>The city of Gary, Indiana believes that they can rescue the town just because Michael Jackson was born there. The house that he grew up in has become a shrine. Granted just about everything else that city has tried in the last 40 years has been a failure. They do have a single A baseball team that seems to few one of the few moneymakers (it is a lot cheaper than a Cubs or White Sox Game), and the Police make sure that stupidity does not take place around the ballpark. But this is the rare ray of light escaping from a black hole. </p>

		<p>A statute of the King of Tacky and Bad Taste in the home of Dvorcak and Smetena!  Michael&rsquo;s thin, sexually perverted music hopefully will fade along with his black skin. Jackson, like most of his &#8220;fans&#8221;, was ignorant of sublime music and art; he was, I admit, a suitable representative of the degradation of the late 20th century American aesthetic.</p>

		<p> Why not a statue of one of the great Czech composers: Dvorak, Smetana, Janacek, Martinu, etc.? What does Michael Jackson have to do with the Czech Republic? What does this statue do other than promote multiculturalism and perhaps, become a subtle advertisement for Czech miscegenation?</p>

		<p>There is no need for a  Michael Jackson statue in the park.  He was not Czech, and public grounds in the country should honor their own. </p>

		<p>Last summer, I saw massive public demonstrations/performances given for Michael Jackson in Stockholm and Frankfurt. I believe this was at the time of his death.</p>
<p>An interesting aspect to this, as I learned from readers&rsquo; comments in a newspaper, was that these were ORGANIZED. Advertisements had been placed for MJ fans;  they were then taken to a stadium where they were briefed and trained prior to the public performance, which was supposed to look spontaneous.</p>
<p>It all seems so cynical. Anything to boost the enormous popularity of a black star who could do no wrong,  virtually a god. One has to wonder if any white performer would ever have gotten the hysterical adulation that MJ received.  Obviously, there was much more to it than just music.</p>

		<p>So Prague city officials have okayed a plan to erect a statue to honor a pedophile.  How pathetic!</p>
