			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>ScienceDaily, June 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Scientists are finding more variation in the human genome than they had previously expected, now that new technologies are allowing researchers a closer look at the genomes of many individuals, according to a new study from University of Maryland School of Medicine researchers.</p>
<p>The study, to be published in the June 25 issue of the journal Cell, is one of the first to take an in-depth look at transposons, known as &#8220;jumping genes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Transposons are segments of DNA that can replicate themselves  &mdash;  meaning that each generation of a human family has more transposons in its genome than its ancestors  &mdash;  and move to new sites in each individual person&rsquo;s genome. The researchers examined the genomes of 76 people and found that new occurrences of transposons were surprisingly prevalent. They also found that transposons are very active in lung cancer genomes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dr. Devine [Scott E. Devine, associate professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and a research scientist at the school&rsquo;s Institute for Genome Sciences] continues: &#8220;If you think of the human genome as a manual to build a complex machine like an aircraft, imagine what would happen if you copied the page that describes passenger seats and inserted it into the section that describes jet engines. Transposons act something like this: they copy themselves and insert the copies into other areas of the human genome, areas that contain instructions for the complex machine that is the human body. These areas and the instructions they contain may then become corrupted and hard to understand. This, in turn, can alter human traits or even cause human diseases.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw for the first time that new transposon insertions are happening at a high frequency in each person&rsquo;s genome,&#8221; Dr. Devine says. &#8220;We found that if you have a child, the child could have one or more new copies of these transposons that you don&rsquo;t have. From these findings, we predict that there is going to be more variation in human genomes than scientists first believed.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} Technological advances in DNA sequencing have made it possible to examine transposons in greater detail, Dr. Devine adds, and also have cut the cost of sequencing a human genome from millions of dollars just a few years ago to as little as $10,000 now.</p>
<p>Scientists track variation in the human genome to identify specific variants that predict human traits and diseases, says Dr. Devine: &#8220;The big picture idea here is personal genomics, a new wave of science where an individual&rsquo;s genome will be sequenced at birth and then used to make predictions about the future health of that person. This will pave the way for a future of personalized medicine, where treatments and preventive techniques will be tailored to each individual based on the information found in that person&rsquo;s genome.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This study is an example of how our world class researchers are leading the field with their innovations at the cutting edge of this emerging sector of personalized genomics and predictive medicine,&#8221; says E. Albert Reece, M.D., Ph.D., M.B.A., acting president of the University of Maryland, Baltimore and John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor and dean, University of Maryland School of Medicine. &#8220;They are bringing the field of medicine closer to a future where each person&rsquo;s genome will serve as a map to predict their health over a lifetime. We&rsquo;re proud to be a part of this future.&#8221;</p>

<p>What are the ramifications of this when it comes to smoking as a cause of lung cancer?  I have a wider political point I might want to make, but I don&rsquo;t want to expound if my suspicion isn&rsquo;t correct.</p>

		<p>Genetics research will be permitted up to the point that it can establish genetic racial differences as demonstrable fact.  Beyond that point, any findings will be demonized as &#8220;Racism&#8221; and promptly ignored.<br>

		<p>So this means that the variations of human are bigger and the differences between humans can be greater than scientist expected, and the communist idea that we are all the very same is wrong even by genes.</p>
<p>Or to say it in other words:<br>
With the new computer-generated Nano-High-Technology which allows us to look close to atoms and molecules, we are now able to find out what all folks knew 6.0000 years ago.</p>

		<p>Some people are sequencing the Human Genome and some are throwbacks living in dung huts who cannot figure out how to dig their own pit latrines.<br>
Maybe this fantastic science will finally put to rest the asinine notion that &#8220;race is just a social construct&#8221; and &#8220;we&rsquo;re all the same under our skin&#8221;. The moment can&rsquo;t come too soon.</p>
