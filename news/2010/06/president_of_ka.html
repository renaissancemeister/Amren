			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Katherine Mangan, Chronicle of Higher Education, May 31, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The president of Kaplan College&rsquo;s campus in Chula Vista, Calif., was fired this month over his handling of an incident in which students were told they could face academic sanctions if they spoke Spanish in class, according to sources involved with the case.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jonathan Cedeño, the student whose complaint triggered the investigation that led to the president&rsquo;s dismissal, said an Anglo woman in his medical-assistant course had been complaining that he and his friends, who started the class after she did, weren&rsquo;t keeping up.</p>
<p>&#8220;She had been giving us a hard time and insulted me in front of the class, and we had had enough, so we were talking about her,&#8221; he said. The conversation took place on May 3 during a break in the class, he said. After the class, &#8220;she complained to the president that we were talking about her in Spanish and that she didn&rsquo;t understand what we were saying,&#8221; Mr. Cedeño said.</p>
<p>He said Patricia Dussett, program director for allied health, came in to two of his classes the following day and told students that campus policy forbade the use of any language other than English in class, even in side conversations. &#8220;I told her I didn&rsquo;t think that was fair and that that violated my rights,&#8221; Mr. Cedeño said. He said Ms. Dussett responded that if he continued speaking in Spanish, his grades could suffer and he could face other academic sanctions, including expulsion.</p>

		<p>So let me see if I get this straight&hellip;a white woman complains about Hispanics not keeping up and therefore presumably holding back the entire class.  These Hispanics apparently decided to start the class after it had begun.  The white woman is direct and does this in front of them.  This cowardly Hispanic man and his friends is then nasty about her in a language she cannot understand.  </p>
<p>When she complains about them, he whines to his equally whiny aunt and a guy who properly corrected someone for unprofessional, juvenile behavior loses his job.</p>
<p>Just great.  Incompetent Hispanics hold up everyone else, and everyone else had just better take it otherwise a white person expecting some level of adult behavior will lose his job.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Ms. Maldonado contacted one of her former instructors at the University of California at San Diego, Patrick Velasquez, who also served as co-chair of the San Diego Chicano/Latino Concilio, a coalition of alumni, faculty and staff members, and students from higher-education institutions in San Diego County.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gee, I wish us poor whites had a place we could run to every time our feelings get hurt.</p>
<p>Worse, Kaplan is a for-profit school. So the school encourages &#8220;people of color&#8221; to apply for and receive federally-guaranteed student loans to pay the over-priced tuition. Then when the Latino/Chicano/Whatevero Council can&rsquo;t find a way to pass the failing students through racial intimidation guess who is left footing the bill? The evil white man.</p>

		<p>Cedano and Maldonado are rude, uncivilized lowlifes!  I had a coworker who passed away about 11 years ago.  She was Puerto Rican and learned English as an adult.  Although she was more fluent in Spanish she always said if one person in the group doesn&rsquo;t speak Spanish than all conversation was to be carried on in English.  We had, and I still have, a coworker who was born in the states.  She speaks Spanish as her second language, though very fluently because both her parents spoke spanish.  She would constantly speak in Spanish when it either wasn&rsquo;t necessary or just down right rude to do so.  My Puerto Rican coworker felt that she was being rude speaking Spanish when non-Spanish speakers were present.  Nelida would constantly call her on it.  Nelida was a rare one however in that she was fiercely patriotic.  She was proud to be Puerto Rican and American and would tolerate no bad mouthing of the US.  She&rsquo;d be about 65 now.  A good woman and a vanishing breed indeed.</p>
<p>A man looses his job because he expected good manners from his students.  We must liberate ourselves from these people.<br>

		<p>The American student who was being gossipped about should have recorded the Spanish speaking gossipers.  </p>
<p>I think it outrageous that someone should lose their JOB!! because of this. I hope the administrator sues the reconquista trouble makers.</p>

		<p>I think this president should look into his own legal options to this situation. I had a situation similiar at my work place with a spanish speaking guy going over the white supervisors back and complaining to a hispanic assistant manager (in spanish) about every little thing trying to get me in trouble. I was unaware of this until another employee let me in on it and I blew my stack. I went to the manager and filed a complaint and demanded that this guy had to make his complaints to the white supervisor first (chain of command) and do so in English because he speaks English. Then, I said if this was not done my next stop was human resources where I was going to file a discrimination complaint against him and the company. I also confronted him face to face and called him a lazy coward who was trying to get me in trouble simply because, first I am white, and secondly I out worked him and he feels threatened. The company saw things my way and he was pressured to find employment elsewhere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;I was outraged that he would make a correlation between being bilingual and being unprofessional,&rsquo; she said.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, by the admission of those that were speaking Spanish, they were being very unprofessional. THEY WERE talking about someone in a bad way, unprofessional. That IS WHAT it was. So what is the question?</p>
<p>That used to be considered to be very rude to speak a foreign language in front of another person and not have the &#8220;other&#8221; know what you were saying. USED to be. NOT any more. </p>

		<p>Since Kaplan is about test taking, and test taking in ENGLISH, that means that it was very RUDE and very UNPROFESSIONAL both at the same time. It was bad and it was RUDE.</p>

<p>Istvan, thank you for your comment. Nelida was right. Cedano and Maldonado are &#8220;mal educados&#8221; (badly educated)which means they have no manners. However, in Spanish it&rsquo;s stronger, it&rsquo;s quite an insult. It&rsquo;s like saying in English that someone is trashy. </p>
<p>It seems that with multiculturalism manners have gone out the window, too.   <br>

		<p>@ 5 (Istvan) - I too am delighted whenever I meet a minority who actually makes an effort to conform to our society and be a good citizen. There&rsquo;s quite a few where I live, but across the country they seem to be a diminishing breed. They are being diluted by all these greedy, filthy, America-bashing illegal immigrants, and even alot of the legal immigrants who come here just for government benefits and to spread their Latino culture.</p>
<p>Regarding the article, I&rsquo;m just glad to see that the college has such a policy. What disturbs me endlessly is the fatc that the campus president was fired for trying to uphold a law that was already in place. Such is the typical liberal thinking these days.</p>

		<p>In 18th and 19th century Europe, the criminal class developed a secret language of their own: &#8220;Argot&#8221; in France and &#8220;Rotwelsch&#8221; in Germany. The purpose was not to be  overheard by honest citzen. You can find examples e. g. in the novels of Eugen Sue (1804-1957). A word which is still used today and even by middle-class people is &#8220;flic&#8221; for a French police officer.<br>
The Hispanic criminal class in the US does&rsquo;nt need to develop a secret language of their own, they already have one: Spanish.</p>

		<p>I happen to be an American fluent bilingual speaker of English / Spanish living in Spain.  The first thing I do is speak Spanish when I&rsquo;m in a professional situation where others might not understand English  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s just common courtesy and professionalism.  The trouble in America is two-fold:  1) the low socio-economic position of the fauna being introduced into the country; 2) the element of ethnic conflict between the mestizo immigrants and the Europeans who created America  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s the simmering historical grievance.</p>

		<p>I play one of these online games. Players used to talk in foreign languages on occasion. It was truly maddening. Words in any language can&rsquo;t describe it. It really seemed they would do it to be offensive. The game banned the use of languages other than English except in private chat, and made no bones about why they did it. This was several years ago. The excuse they use now is that, &#8216;non-english languages can&rsquo;t be properly moderated at this time&rsquo;.</p>
<p>All the same, when traveling abroad, I used to like it, hearing the different languages - was part of the experience.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a school bus driver. I have a Mexican girl on my bus who constantly badgers me about whites being evil because they had slaves. She says that she doesn&rsquo;t have to listen to anything I say because I am a racist. One day she asked me if she could move to another seat and I said no. She told me that I was a racist and she got up and moved anyway. Yesterday, she was teasing me by asking me if I&rsquo;m a gringo and some other Spanish words which I don&rsquo;t know the meaning of. Several times, as she got off the bus she would say something to me in Spanish and the other Mexicans on the bus would laugh. Once I recognized the phrase she said: &#8220;viva la raza.&#8221; I remember that one day she had &#8220;la raza&#8221; written in large letters on her arm. I talked to another bus driver about this girl and the bus driver told me that she used to ride her bus, and that she refused to let her speak Spanish, and the girl&rsquo;s mom came to the bus and told the bus driver that she was going to complain to the school board for not letting her daughter speak Spanish on the school bus. </p>
