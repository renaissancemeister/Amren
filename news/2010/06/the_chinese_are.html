			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Malcolm Moore, London Telegraph, June 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Given China&rsquo;s turbulent modern history and the fact it continues to be largely a poor country, there have always been lots of people happy to trade in their Chinese citizenship for a life elsewhere.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the United States has been the destination of choice and has benefited enormously from the legions of smart Chinese immigrants it has welcomed. By some accounts, as many as 70 per cent of the Chinese who study in the US end up living there.</p>
<p>In recent years, Canada has also emerged as a popular destination, and a poll in the Canadian Globe &amp; Mail newspaper shows that 77 per cent of Chinese, when given the choice, would choose to move to Canada over staying in China.</p>
<p>(Over half the Brits they polled also said they would be keen to jump ship)</p>
<p>But is the UK seen as an attractive destination too? We did a very informal poll among some young Chinese living in Shanghai and it seems the answer is a resounding no. Indeed one respondent even studied in the UK but decided to flee, and leave her boyfriend behind too.</p>
<p>Minna, a 34-year-old PR executive said that she had discussed emigration with her husband as recently as yesterday, but had decided to stick to China. Her opinion about the UK? Taxes are too high and the standard of living is just too low.</p>
<p>&#8220;A couple that are friends with my husband are living in the UK. The husband teaches at a university and the wife works in a school library. You would think they have a middle-class life, but when they came to Shanghai on holiday they said their financial position was very awkward,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They live on the outskirts of London because they cannot afford to buy in the city. I guess they make around £5,000 a month between them, but they have to pay huge taxes. They only get £3,000 a month in total. Any middle class family in Shanghai earns more than that! After paying their mortgage and sending some money to their parents, they have nothing left. And now they have a baby girl but cannot even afford a nanny! They drive a car, but cannot go downtown because the parking costs too much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most of the other Chinese we quizzed expressed similar complaints. &#8220;The UK is really expensive, for food and everything,&#8221; said Ting Ting, a 24-year-old sales person. &#8220;The US is much cheaper, has more business opportunities and is much better. Japan is also quiet and has a good living environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Xuemei, a 32-year-old legal consultant, studied law at University College London for a year-and-a-half and said she liked the city, despite the weather and her inability to find a decent Cantonese restaurant. &#8220;What I liked the most about the UK was the range of cheap, high-end skin care products, compared to China, especially Burberry. What I didn&rsquo;t like was the rent  &mdash;  £450 a month for a shabby room  &mdash;  pricey food and fruit and the difficulty in getting a good job. I never even considered staying in the UK after graduation, even though my boyfriend, a Singaporean, was still there.&#8221;</p>
<p>So there you have it. In the eyes of young urban Chinese, Shanghai beats London any day.<br>

		<p>You&rsquo;ll notice the calculations are strictly ones of financial advantage, no naive romanticism here. One day here, another day there, wherever it&rsquo;s best for them. There&rsquo;s already a surplus of such people here already, basically just walking cash registers. The USA needs more people with a cultural and political commitment and less of the mercenary types.   </p>

<p>So they could make more money in China but they&rsquo;re staying in London?  Sounds like someone is telling a tall tale.  The only reason Western companies moved businesses into China was because of low cost labor.  An upper middle class salary in China is a paltry 15000 RMB or $28,000 per year.  If this couple is clearing 3,000 pounds or $4500 a month, they&rsquo;re making a whole lot more than they ever could in China, which is why they&rsquo;re not leaving.   </p>

		<p>Those Chinese in question ought to be grateful they&rsquo;ve been granted the opportunity to secure a Western education in the first place.  </p>
<p>I bet it never occurs to them that their taking up of places in establishments of higher education translates as one less place for a native person.  The same goes for every employment positon they occupy and every home they rent or buy.</p>

		<p>Well the other article a couple of days ago talks about the superior attitude of some students from China. If it&rsquo;s so great, why do any want to leave?  These Chinese and well as most other immigrants are just out for money and want to use whatever country they are in. If the money runs out or there is a downturn, they&rsquo;ll pack their bags and go. We need Americans and Whites in general to stop allowing themselves to be used and start protecting our own and our own culture. Our jobs and university educations to go to our own. Let China educate and employ its own.</p>

<p>What kind of citizens are they, when they have to be screened out as risks to national security, because of their blood ties to an aggressive, adversary state?</p>

<p>At the graduate level, especially in the UK, the spots are not being taken from native born students.  One of Britain&rsquo;s biggest industries is luring foreign students and their fat tuition fees.  The spots were created just for people like them.  </p>

<p>Do you realize how much a couple earning 3000 pounds, living in London, and raising a kid would save?  Nothing.  In Shanghai they would be able to actually have savings on a salary 1/3 as high.  </p>

		<p>The frivolity of most East Asians, especially women it seems, is quite staggering and shameful to their supposed higher IQ.   Re the comment about skin-care products. Does not the history and culture (or what is left of it) and the relative intellectual freedom of Britain count for nothing compared to the stultifying state-sanitised mantras of the Chinese disctatorship?</p>
<p>As for all those comments about expensive food - I spend about 3 months every year in the UK and am always amazed about how CHEAP most of the food is, esp considering most is imported. I cant speak for the US or Canada but most food is much cheaper than Australia and even South Africa (which used to be very cheap, no longer) and Argentina where I am now. Sure there are exceptions (like red meat) and it depends where your shop. I mostly shop at ASDA (division of Walmart), Lidl and Aldi - the latter 2 German chains especially can be amazingly cheap. </p>

		<p>Can someone tell he how the Chinese and other immigrants can just &#8220;end up living&#8221; in the US or other western country?<br>
To my knowledge, each foreign student on a F2 visa who graduated in the U.S. has a grace period of 60 days that is given to leave the country. The only way to stay legally in the U.S. beyond graduation is to get a working permit or to become a U.S. citizen through marriage. Given the current unemployment of nearly 10%, I think that it is very hard to find a employer who is willing to sponsor an H1B visa. Or do those Chinese marry other Chinese with a U.S. passport?<br>
If I studied in Japan, China, India or any other non-white country, I doubt that I would be able to just stay  there. I&rsquo;m sure their immigration laws are more strict, and even if there was a way to stay, it wouldn&rsquo;t work without facing bureaucratic hassles.</p>

<p>Whatever way you spin it, they are, in fact, taking education establishment places, jobs and housing provision from the indigenous peoples of the UK.  </p>
<p>Firstly, why are such UK firms creating work for alien Third Worlders instead of native peoples?  Well!!!!  (I think most intelligent people know the answer to this one.)</p>
<p>Secondly, for decades now, British companies have been subject to both part-ownership and buy-out deals by foreigners.</p>
<p>Therefore, no wonder these former British firms increasingly now part-owned or outright owned by foreigners including the Chinese, are wishing to keep the money (tuition fees) and the job opportunities &#8216;within the family&rsquo;, so to speak.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Do you realize how much a couple earning 3000 pounds, living in London, and raising a kid would save? Nothing. In Shanghai they would be able to actually have savings on a salary 1/3 as high.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Well then, what is preventing these particular complainants from relocating back to their native homelands?  </p>
<p>Incidently, do the Shanghai authorities supply a FREE at-the point-of-need National Health Service, education and welfare system?  Well!</p>
<p>In the case of the latter, some countries which do provide a welfare system of sorts may also obligate claimants via compulsory private insurance and/or increased state contributions, to reimburse their welfare benefits upon successfully securing employment.  </p>
<p>Do any of the above or similar policies apply in Shanghai?  Well!<br>

		<p>In South Korea, where it&rsquo;s more seriously an issue, it&rsquo;s called the &#8216;brain drain&rsquo;. Will there need to be a new Berlin wall erected? It&rsquo;s happening all over the third world and it is excuse #147 for why they are impoverished. I guess sometimes IQ is important&hellip; We in the West should act upon This injustice just like we do the others and ensure no third world nation ever need want for services or trained workers and administrators. It&rsquo;s the compassionate thing to do. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s my take on it too.  This isn&rsquo;t the first article I&rsquo;ve seen where Chinese are trying to put airs on coming from what is still a third world country.  Obviously they couldn&rsquo;t find work in China or they couldn&rsquo;t find work that was desirable.  I have to wonder if this couple had been prevented from entering the UK if they would be in Shanghai taxiing around passengers on a bicycle rickshaw.     <br>

<p>Exactly right. As soon as the wind changes direction many of these people will be gone practically overnight. Don&rsquo;t kid yourself - these people wouldn&rsquo;t stick around to fight if the country was attacked or if there was a protracted economic slump. As soon as the pros and cons weigh out overall negatively, they&rsquo;ll be gone. </p>

<p>No, they won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The ones in the West are running from ecological degradation, overcrowded lands, scarce opportunities, lack of societal safety nets, poor or expensive health care, and oppressively corrupt regimes.</p>
<p>They might send a breadwinner to where the money is, but they want their families residing in white countries with higher quality of life.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already seen this in Canada, where professional Arab and Chinese men obtain citizenship so they may drop their kids and parents off, while they go back to their homelands where they have careers.   </p>

__</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already seen the answer to that!  A Chinese is a Chinese, even when the family has lived abroad for centuries. <br>
Incidentally, China does not recognize dual citizenship. They&rsquo;re much more sensible about that than we are.  You&rsquo;re either Chinese or you&rsquo;re not. No straddling the line.</p>

		<p>To poster #7.  About the vapidness of east asians, you are right on.  I live right next to a little asia area.  They have so many beauty shops, designer dog shops, you wouldn&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>The average asian girl cannot go out of the house without a full compliment of make up, the accessories, etc..  You should see how gawdy their houses are with oversize chrome fencing, etc&hellip;</p>
<p>A very materialistic culture.</p>

		<p>What bothers me is that so many in other countries(not just the Chinese) come to the USA as if it is a financial decision. It is very common to hear something like, &#8220;We wanted more money, better opportunities for education, employment,whatever, so we came to the USA.&#8221; Pay attention to interviews on TV, or in conversation with those not born in the USA and you will hear this attitude, also. They act like they have a God-given right to just come to the USA. <br>
We are a nation and a culture, not a financial decision. </p>
