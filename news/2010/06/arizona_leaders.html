			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Slevin, Washington Post, June 7, 2010;</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When state Rep. Kyrsten Sinema (D) travels outside Arizona, she hears the same question over and over: &#8220;What&rsquo;s wrong with your state?&#8221; She notes Arizona&rsquo;s new immigration law, its ban on ethnic studies classes and its prohibition on creating animal-human hybrids.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sinema is a liberal Democrat in a largely Republican state, but her sense of disheartenment is shared across party lines. Dean Martin, state treasurer and conservative GOP candidate for governor, said national opinion on Arizona is &#8220;polarized. That&rsquo;s counterproductive.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gov. Jan Brewer (R) has appointed a committee and allocated $250,000 to re-brand the state&rsquo;s image, while 13 Arizona chamber of commerce executives appealed to Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig to keep the 2011 All-Star Game in Phoenix after he faced pressure to change locations. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Phoenix City Hall calculates that Arizona has lost nearly $100 million in convention commitments. Meanwhile, supporters and opponents of the immigration law are taking to the streets weekly.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Natividad Lopez Rubio, known as &#8220;Natty,&#8221; said his Nogales-to-Phoenix shuttle business is suffering. A few months ago, his minivans made 14 round trips a day and were often full. Now, he is lucky to make five trips with a few passengers in each.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Opponents of the immigration law may be frustrated, but &#8220;boycotts are absolutely the wrong way to go,&#8221; said Garrick Taylor, a spokesman for the state chamber of commerce. Boycotts hurt Arizonans, &#8220;particularly in the tourist industry, who had nothing to do with the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taylor is especially annoyed with state and local governments that are canceling deals with Arizona businesses or calling on others to do so. &#8220;If they were truly invested in the immigration issue,&#8221; he said, &#8220;they&rsquo;d be pressing Washington for comprehensive immigration reform.&#8221;</p>
<p>The last time Arizona&rsquo;s image suffered such a blow was in the 1980s, when many Republicans, including then-U.S. Rep. John McCain, opposed a national holiday honoring the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Woods [Grant Woods], the former attorney general, said the moment inspired his winning campaign as a GOP promoter of civil rights. This time, he is counting on &#8220;intelligent, compassionate people from all sides&#8221; to find a compromise.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are some states that are pretty much lily-white. That&rsquo;s not our state,&#8221; Woods said. &#8220;To be an Arizonan is to be a part of Mexico. It&rsquo;s to be a part of the various Native American tribes. That&rsquo;s part of our culture, the diversity. I think the people&rsquo;s hearts are there, but the leaders don&rsquo;t always respect that.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Please make sure the next Amren conference is in Arizona, the only state in the U.S. with a governor I can respect.  I sure hope people vote out all the politicians who have been boycotting Arizona.</p>
<p>As for Grant Woods, a man who says that Arizona is part of Mexico, I wish there was some way to deport <i>him</i>.</p>

		<p>Hmmm&hellip;I&rsquo;ve known and met plenty of people from Arizona, and I don&rsquo;t recall a single one that considered themselves part of Mexico in any conceivable way or form - go figure. Somehow, I suspect MOST Arizonans are quite fine being American alone.  </p>

		<p>Arizona&rsquo;s &#8220;image&#8221; takes a beating?  With 60% of the country in favor of it?  And 18 other states in the process of introducing similar legislation?</p>
<p>The out-of-touch libs are really desperate.  They&rsquo;ve resorted to distorting the truth, hoping the lies they tell will become reality.</p>
<p>If just one.  Just ONE!  Terrorist attack can be traced to an illegal border crossing&hellip;no matter what state it is&hellip;.the pressure will be on to close down the entire border and the community organizer will be impeached.</p>
<p>And, you can take that to the bank.</p>

		<p>Record them for posterity.  The last words of the liberal elite on the final issue anyone will ever care what they think about ever again.</p>
<p>This time next year, liberals will be an extinct species.  The media is in full denial mode over it but the tolerance in this country for this way of thinking has dropped to zero.</p>
<p>The political careers of these people are over and they are making their comments alone, with no one among the public supporting them</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;said national opinion on Arizona is &ldquo;polarized. That&rsquo;s counterproductive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Counterproductive? Yes it is, for your business interests at least, you dirty neo-con. It would just suck if you had to hire Americans for a change to work in your fruit orchards, and God forbid you should have to pay for a legal nanny! And if its so &#8220;counterproductive&#8221; to be polarized, then why don&rsquo;t the pro-amnesty people just give up? After all, far more people support Arizona&rsquo;s law, so if you want to end all this horrible polarization, then its YOU people who will have to change, not us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are some states that are pretty much lily-white. That&rsquo;s not our state,&rdquo; Woods said. &ldquo;To be an Arizonan is to be a part of Mexico.

I think the people&rsquo;s hearts are there, but the leaders don&rsquo;t always respect that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So you think the people are against Arizona&rsquo;s law, eh? The opinion polls would really beg to differ. And what states these days are &#8220;liliy-white&#8221;? Other than Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, and maybe Montana, I can&rsquo;t think of any states that aren&rsquo;t being threatened by rapidly-increasing non-white populations.</p>

		<p>If Arizona capitulates, grovels and apologizes rather than plowing ahead on this course, it will be all but over for the SouthWest U.S. Just as well give it to Mexico and let it turn on into the 3rd world, SLIGHTLY ahead of the rest of the U.S.</p>

		<p>#4 is exactly right.  The anti-white powers that control everything (for now, anyways) are scared that we&rsquo;re waking up and taking action.  If they want to exterminate us and take away our power, lives, property, children, etc, they know they are going to have to fight real hard!</p>

<p>I may be taking a beating among the effete chardonnay-swilling liberals of America, who drip with contempt for all things American, but it would appear to holding up splendidly among those who count for anything.</p>

		<p>I was in Phoenix Monday on work-related business.  There were no protests going on, so it was just a regular day in Arizona.  I noticed a local trend that I suppose is intended to be a show of force:</p>
<p>Many Hispanics are wearing T-Shirts, etc., with some reference to Mexico on them, like the souvenir-style shirts you may get there while on vacation.  Others have more belligerent attire; I saw one young Hispanic wearing a T-shirt that read &#8220;it&rsquo;s not illegal being brown,&#8221; while another was wearing a sombrero.  He looked like a fool.</p>
<p>Clearly they do see it as a Mexico vs. United States issue, because they&rsquo;re aligning themselves with Mexico as Mexicans.  I hope Arizona stands strong and that the other states that are considering legislation hurry up and not leave Arizona standing alone.</p>
