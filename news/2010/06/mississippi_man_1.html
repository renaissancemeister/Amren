<h1>Mississippi Man Faces Sixth Capital Murder Trial in 1996 Shootings</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Emanuella Grinberg, CNN, June 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Curtis Flowers has stood before five juries in the past 13 years on capital murder charges, accused of killing four people in a Mississippi furniture store.</p>
<p>This week, prosecutors are hoping his sixth trial will be the last.</p>
<p>Flowers, 40, is believed to be the only person in recent U.S. history to be tried six times on the same capital murder charges.</p>
<p>Bertha Tardy, the owner of Tardy&rsquo;s Furniture in downtown Winona, and three employees were shot execution-style in the head the morning of July 16, 1996, inside the store, court records say.</p>
<p>The shootings rattled the sleepy central Mississippi town, with a population of about 5,500 that has declined in the 14 years since then. Like most of the businesses still operating in downtown Winona, Tardy&rsquo;s was a relic of another era, having opened its doors in the 1940s. Bertha Tardy and her husband were prominent members of the community, and nearly everyone in Winona could claim some connection to the victims.</p>
<p>After months of interviews and a $30,000 reward for information, Flowers was arrested in January 1997 on four counts of capital murder. He has been in custody ever since.</p>
<p>Flowers has been convicted three times and sentenced to death twice, but the Mississippi Supreme Court reversed those verdicts and ordered a new trial each time. His two most recent trials ended in hung juries, leading his supporters to question why the Montgomery County District Attorney&rsquo;s Office continues to seek a conviction.</p>
<p>The prosecution&rsquo;s case is based largely on circumstantial evidence. There is no DNA, the alleged murder weapon has not been found and eyewitnesses who say they saw Flowers the day of the shooting have provided conflicting accounts.</p>
<p>Still, Montgomery County District Attorney Doug Evans says it&rsquo;s a straightforward case of a disgruntled worker taking out his anger against his former employer.</p>
<p>Others, who believe Flowers is innocent, say the case has turned into a crusade and suggest that race has played a major role in the prosecution and convictions of Flowers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact they&rsquo;re trying this case for the sixth time suggests to me there&rsquo;s some racial motivation here, because there&rsquo;s no way in the world I can see a white guy accused of doing the same thing being tried six times to procure a conviction,&#8221; said Jackson City Councilman Chokwe Lumumba, who represented Flowers in his second trial in 1999.</p>
<p>Flowers&rsquo; supporters say it is a classic example of a case built upon weak circumstantial evidence and shaky eyewitness testimony intended to blame an easy target: a poor black man.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In all five trials, Sam Jones, an employee of Tardy&rsquo;s since it opened in 1942, testified that Bertha Tardy called him around 9 a.m. on July 16 about coming in to train two new employees. When Jones arrived at the store around 9:30 a.m., he discovered the bodies of Tardy, bookkeeper Carmen Rigby and Robert Golden lying near the counter in pools of blood. Nearby, Jones saw 16-year-old Derrick &#8220;Bobo&#8221; Stewart on the floor, blood pouring from his head with each labored breath. He died a week later.</p>
<p>Prosecutors allege that Flowers, a former employee, stole a gun from his uncle&rsquo;s car and shot Tardy because she had fired him two weeks before the killings and docked his pay for damaging a pair of batteries. He allegedly shot the others to eliminate witnesses, and then took money from the cash register, which elevated the offense to capital murder and made him eligible for the death penalty.</p>
<p>The .380-caliber pistol used in the shootings has not been found, but investigators matched bullets at the scene to shell casings from the gun owned by Flowers&rsquo; uncle, which has also not been recovered. Another witness who came forward months after the shooting and said she saw Flowers &#8220;leaning&#8221; on his uncle&rsquo;s car around 7:15 a.m. the day of shootings. The same day, his uncle, Doyle Simpson, reported that a gun had been stolen from his car.</p>
<p>A neighbor said she saw Flowers around 7:30 a.m. outside his home wearing Fila sneakers. Another witness testified that he saw two men standing across the street from Tardy&rsquo;s around 10 a.m., and that one of them was Flowers. Another woman said she saw Flowers running out of the store the morning of the shootings while she was driving toward the store with a friend.</p>
<p>A trace analyst expert determined that a bloody footprint at the scene came from a size 10.5 Grant Hill Fila sneaker; investigators found a shoebox for a 10.5 Grant Hill Fila at the home where Flowers lived with his girlfriend, but found no sneakers.</p>
<p>The three different teams of lawyers to represent Flowers have argued that witnesses who said they saw him that morning came forward with shaky stories months after the shootings, enticed by a $30,000 reward. They also said prosecutors failed to conclusively link Flowers to the weapon or the crime scene through the bloody footprint, and questioned whether the evidence proved that money was taken from the cash register.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prosecutors at first attempted to try Flowers separately for each murder, but the first two convictions were reversed after the Mississippi Supreme Court found that evidence of the other deaths was improperly introduced. The court found that prosecutors used excessive displays of crime scene photos and testimony regarding the nature of the other deaths.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The third trial in 2004 also ended in a conviction that was later reversed after the state Supreme Court ruled that prosecutors dismissed black jurors based on race, fueling allegations of racial bias against the district attorney&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>In the case of one black female whom the prosecution voted to dismiss because of her attitude toward the death penalty, the court noted that her views &#8220;were nearly indistinguishable from those of two white jurors who ultimately served on the jury, suggesting disparate treatment.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next two trials  &mdash;  Flowers 4 and 5, as they are called by the lawyers who tried them  &mdash;  ended in hung juries after the panelists failed to reach a unanimous decision. The first jury was split along racial lines, with five black jurors voting to acquit and seven white jurors choosing to convict. The lone black juror on the panel in the fifth trial, who voted to acquit Flowers, was charged with perjury, but the charges were ultimately dismissed.</p>
<p>Flowers&rsquo; supporters say the first three convictions and the racial divides in the last two trials can be attributed to the racist attitudes that still prevail in Mississippi, especially when a low-income black person is accused of killing a prominent white member of the community. Tardy and two of the other victims were white; the fourth victim was black.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another difference involves the testimony of Charles &#8220;Porky&#8221; Collins, the man who said he saw Flowers across the street from the store around 10 a.m. with another man. It will be read to the jury, because Collins is dead.</p>

<p>What kind of Twilight Zone world do we inhabit? I&rsquo;m sure race did have something to do with the murders, and the trial results, just not the way the supporters of the accused think. Even the Twilight Zone went off after 30 minutes&hellip;</p>

		<p>Former employees are often the weak link in the security of a business. They know how the money is handled, the comings and goings of employees, all the inside info needed to rip the place off. A black woman with no police record often has a brother, boyfriend, other relative or friend that could use the information to burglarize or rob the place. These employees, current or former, often hold responsible jobs, such as bank employee, even as cops. I&rsquo;m sure the guy in this story was trusted at one time by his employer. A bit of revenge as well as getting rid of witnesses seems to be involved in this particular case.</p>

		<p>Why is the D.A. still trying to convict Flowers?</p>
<p>Because they think he murdered someone, and he has not yet been found not guilty by a unanimous jury.</p>
<p>Unless there is some drastic political change, I&rsquo;m sure that they&rsquo;ll try him 106 times if they have to.  </p>

Considering that race apparently means a lot for the way the jury members will vote on the outcome, I see no fault in the DA electing to dismiss blacks.</p>
<p>Anyone ever checked if the defense tried to exclude as many whites as possible? For the very same reason?</p>

		<p>This case shouldn&rsquo;t be dropped just because of (apparently) race-motivated hung juries.  If Flowers is truly guilty, then at least he&rsquo;ll be in jail, off the streets, while the next trial is awaiting.</p>

<p>Perhaps the story here is that blacks not only commit a much higher percentage of violent crime than they are a percentage of the population, they are also eager to issue free passes to fellow blacks. </p>

		<p>If I was on the jury panel, I would have voted not only to convict, but to execute this trash. It&rsquo;s quite plain this guy did shoot and kill four people, and race had a great deal to do with his motivations. The fact he shot three people who were innocent bystanders is all too typical of non-white murderers, robbers, and rapists.  He had too many chances to refute the allegations against him, time to hang him with a rope.</p>
