	<p>This is a list of all countries by fertility rate.</p>
<p><b>The UN TFR Ranking</b></p>
<p>The UN TFR Ranking is a list of countries by total fertility rate (TFR): the expected number of children born per woman in her child-bearing years. Figures are from the 2006 revision of the United Nations World Population Prospects report, for the period 2000-2005 and 2004-2010, using the medium assumption. Only countries/territories with a population of 100,000 or more in 2007 are included. Rank is based on 2005-2010 figure.</p>

		<p>Okay, so obviously black central Africa has the highest level of births, but it also has the highest infant mortality rates in the world. Many children die long before they have a chance to reproduce.<br>

		<p>I have viewed some of the figures, and it is horrifying.Many of the European countries are in population free fall.  That is not extremely bad as long as alien outsiders are not allowed into their countries in large numbers.  The number for South Africa is unbelievably low. Is it whites and coloreds only?  Why is so much effort being given to Africa to further accelerate their population growth?</p>

		<p>I see the USA is listed with Latin America. Hmmm.  Wonder why.</p>
<p>Also, it&rsquo;s blatantly plain to see that Africa is, by far, the baby factory of the world.  No doubt it always was. But in the past   &mdash;   without Western medicines, foodstuffs, technology, aid    &mdash;    Nature imposed her own controls.  By our shortsighted altruism, we are cutting our own children&rsquo;s throats and ensuring our own genocide.</p>

		<p>If they considered only indigenous parents, there is no doubt that the disparities would be even greater.  As it stands, over time the disparities will seem to decrease as African immigrants (who continue to have many babies) impact the overall birthrates of their host countries.  At that point, a superficial glance at current fertility maps would give the impression that the white race is recovering but this might not be the case at all.</p>

		<p>A low fertility rate for any developed country is a good thing, because the economy can be restructured to provide for lesser cointributers to the tax base.  It&rsquo;s easy and it&rsquo;s no problem.</p>
<p>This business of advocating mass immigration comes from people who are too dense to think of anything else and by those who want a fractious nation, because they perceive such a situation will help their tribe somehow.</p>
<p>Anybody with the slightest common sense is well-aware that no people on earth will allow their country to reach near zero population without invoking laws that heavily benefit couples to have babies and therefore turn once again to a growing society.</p>
<p>To repeat, this business of scarng the public into believing their country will perish without importing third world hordes is done by seditionists within the population and those too stupid to know better.</p>
<p>Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES should blacks, Muslims or Asians be allowed to poison a Christian culture.  It is this procedure that will bring the country&rsquo;s homogeneous population to zero, not low birth rates that can be reversed at the drop of a hat.</p>

		<p>Yet more proof that a move to Chile, Canada, East Asia, or Australia is advisable.  Where there are high fertility rates you can bank on there being high non-White populations.</p>

<p>No, not in ANY numbers!  You can&rsquo;t let them get a foot in the door   &mdash;   not even a toe   &mdash;   because if you do, the rest will inevitably follow.</p>

		<p>European countries NEED to study Israel and why its birth rate is so high. (And yes, even secular Israelis are considerably above replacement.) If Europeans structured their societies, tax structure, family support, and so forth on an Israeli model, it might help things quite a bit.</p>
<p>Argentina is another interesting case   &mdash;   a Southern European country like Spain and Italy, but with twice the birth rate (2.4 children per woman, vs. 1.2 in Spain and Italy). Why is this so?</p>

		<p>I suggest you have another very close look at these figures and you will find something that has been swept under the carpet. There is a direct correlation between high birth rate and poverty and vice versa. The poorest countries in the world - Afghanistan, Yemen and Somalia also have the very highest birth rates. The lowest birth rate is in Japan.</p>

<p>Liberals claim these figures are ironclad proof (and they use this logic to support their sick agenda) that where women are oppressed the birth rate goes up, and that their efforts are working and needed even more. What the figures show is that are negative consequences to men being devalued and oppressed for real.   <br>

		<p>What is more interesting is that of the countries with the highest birth rates are all receiving food aid. The question must be asked: is the food aid increasing the birth rate in these countries? Given that it probably extends their average life span I would say yes, it is.</p>

		<p>Addressing an earlier comment, even though there&rsquo;s a high Black African infant mortality rate, most are not dying before reproductive age and black Africa&rsquo;s population is still increasing. Arguably might be at a billion now, and worst many of them want to immigrate to the West.</p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t claim to know the overall reason/s, but it must be noted that there is a considerable Indian element in Argentina, plus still more coming in from Bolivia, etc.. I would wager that the Indian birthrate is VERY high, and that it at least contributes to this high figure. </p>

<p>Several European countries, Singapore, South Korea and Hong Kong has a lower fertility rate than Japan.  </p>
