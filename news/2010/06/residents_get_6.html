<h1>Residents Get 6 Votes Each in Suburban NY Election</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jim Fitzgerald, Yahoo! News, June 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Arthur Furano voted early  &mdash;  five days before Election Day. And he voted often, flipping the lever six times for his favorite candidate.</p>
<p>Furano cast multiple votes on the instructions of a federal judge and the U.S. Department of Justice as part of a new election system crafted to help boost Hispanic representation.</p>
<p>Voters in Port Chester, 25 miles northeast of New York City, are electing village trustees for the first time since the federal government alleged in 2006 that the existing election system was unfair. The election ends Tuesday and results are expected late Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Although the village of about 30,000 residents is nearly half Hispanic, no Latino had ever been elected to any of the six trustee seats, which until now were chosen in a conventional at-large election. Most voters were white, and white candidates always won.</p>
<p>Federal Judge Stephen Robinson said that violated the Voting Rights Act, and he approved a remedy suggested by village officials: a system called cumulative voting, in which residents get six votes each to apportion as they wish among the candidates. He rejected a government proposal to break the village into six districts, including one that took in heavily Hispanic areas.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first time any municipality in New York has used cumulative voting, said Amy Ngai, a director at FairVote, a nonprofit election research and reform group that has been hired to consult. The system is used to elect the school board in Amarillo, Texas, the county commission in Chilton County, Ala., and the City Council in Peoria, Ill.</p>
<p>The judge also ordered Port Chester to implement in-person early voting, allowing residents to show up on any of five days to cast ballots. That, too, is a first in New York, Ngai said.</p>
<p>Village clerk Joan Mancuso said Monday that 604 residents voted early.</p>
<p>Gloria Furano gave one vote each to six candidates. Aaron Conetta gave two votes each to three candidates.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>FairVote said cumulative voting allows a political minority to gain representation if it organizes and focuses its voting strength on specific candidates. Two of the 13 Port Chester trustee candidates  &mdash;  one Democrat and one Republican  &mdash;  are Hispanic. A third Hispanic is running a write-in campaign after being taken off the ballot on a technicality.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gregg Gregory gave all his votes to one candidate, then said, &#8220;I think this is terrific. It&rsquo;s good for Port Chester. It opens it up to a lot more people, not just Hispanics but independents, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Randolph McLaughlin, who represented a plaintiff in the lawsuit, said the goal was not merely to encourage more Hispanics to vote but &#8220;to create a system whereby the Hispanic community would be able to nominate and elect a candidate of their choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The village held 12 forums  &mdash;  six each in English and Spanish  &mdash;  to let voters know about the new system and to practice voting. The bilingual ballot lists each candidate across the top row  &mdash;  some of them twice if they have two party lines  &mdash;  and then the same candidates are listed five more times. In all, there are 114 levers; voters can flip any six.</p>

		<p>This strategy might work against the left wing.  Early in the 1990s, a town in Maryland (?) tried cumulative voting, mainly to get a black on the city council.  The first election that was held using the system, no black won a seat, but a self-described out and outright neo-Nazi won a seat.  The cumulative voting system was immediately repealed.</p>
<p>That is certainly a ridiculous example, but I can easily see how cumulative voting systems can help our side.</p>

		<p>Why haven&rsquo;t they thought of that before now?   </p>
<p>These tactics will become cumulative and then suddenly, in one election, the illegals will have elected enough U.S. Congressmen to pass Amnesty, Citizenship, and the Vote.</p>
<p>We know what&rsquo;s coming. These stories all add up to not the big bang of American destruction, but the little bangs along the way that don&rsquo;t make enough noise by themselves alone to get the White Nation moving against its total dispossession.</p>
<p>We will have our retirement accounts confiscated, our property taxes raised, and our lives controlled by government hacks.</p>
<p>We must relearn Interposition and the power of Impeachment. </p>
<p>South Carolina seceded 150 years ago this coming December.   How did they do it? Very simple: they just repealed their ratification of the Constitution and returned to sovereign status.</p>

		<p>This is beyond absurd.  One man/one vote is now &#8220;unfair,&#8221; and must be supplanted by a rigged system whose stated purpose is to &#8220;boost Hispanic representation?&#8221;  We&rsquo;re supposed to believe that our troops are fighting for &#8220;democracy&#8221; in the Middle East, while here at home democracy is to be subverted when it doesn&rsquo;t produce the results our rulers desire?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Most voters were white, and white candidates always won.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Uh, yeah&hellip;  That&rsquo;s the way <i>real</i> democracy works.  It&rsquo;s called &#8220;majority rule,&#8221; and the Imperium seems to have no problems with it in locations where the majority isn&rsquo;t White.  How much more flagrant does the current regime&rsquo;s totalitarian plan have to be before White people notice?</p>
<p>Of course, that presumes that the controlled governmedia will permit the news to be widely disseminated, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>

		<p>Lani Guinier I believe championed this.  Since minorities block vote by race, they&rsquo;ll be more likely to elect one of their own.</p>
<p>Anne-Marie Slaughter, the current director of the office of policy planning at the State Department supported this idea as well, in one of her books.  She a real stuck up elitist twit who of course doesn&rsquo;t live near minorities but likes to champion their causes.</p>

		<p>I will be up front here, I am not a fan of universal suffrage.  It is my understanding, however, that we are a nation of &#8220;one man, one vote&#8221;.  How can cumulative voting be constitutional?  How does a judge get to tell a municipality how to arrange it&rsquo;s form of government?  Shouldn&rsquo;t that be a legislative prerogative?  The SCOTUS ruled that states could not use a system similar to the Federal system of a Senate and House of Representatives. (states may not have a lower chamber based on proportional representation and an upper house based on say two representatives per county or parish, both houses must be based on proportional representation).  I often wonder why 49 of the 50 states even bother to have two houses thanks to that ruling.</p>
<p>Now a SINGLE man, a judge, has the dictatorial power, power not even accorded an Arab monarch, to determine how a village may elect it&rsquo;s trustees?  This is America? This is the new Amerika!  All the blood that was shed to keep us free and little did anyone guess that we would surrender to a man in a black robe, without even a whimper of protest.  We are a bunch of sad sacks.<br>

		<p>I hope this judge gets impeached and, after that, charged, tried, found guilty, and punished for treason. He swore to obey and uphold the Constitution, but he blatantly violated it and for racist reasons (to impose the Hispanic privilege on the community).</p>
<p>This case is one of many that prove that the American justice system became a social pathology. It needs a thorough overhaul, which should begin with post-tenure review by all the judges.<br>

<p>How sadly laughable!</p>
<p>What is the point anymore?</p>
<p>They, these multicultural freaks and one eyed Red salamanders, just make up the rules as they go along. If the US Constitution gets in the way, who cares; it is only &ldquo;paper&rdquo; representing &ldquo;living&rdquo; documentation as they decree it to be allowed to live.</p>
<p>So, why not play the game the same way?</p>
<p>I hereby declare myself the undisputed lifelong President of the USA and all 100 US Senators in toto! I do so, by rightful &ldquo;cumulative votes&rdquo; earned when I was not allowed the franchise in 1776. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that I was yet unborn or even inconceivable at that point in history, I still had my rights!</p>
<p>I Vote my entire 10,000,000,000+ &ldquo;cumulative votes&rdquo; as justly demanding both such compensation and validation. </p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t get that, racism and xenophobia are so entrenched in this society, it has to be called the Fourth Reich of Unfairness!!!</p>

		<p>So the village is half mexican, but mexicans don&rsquo;t get elected. did anyone ever consider that maybe the white candidates were better qualified and the mexicans made intelligent choices, not based on color? <br>
That the courts expect mexicans to vote for mexicans, and if they don&rsquo;t they will force them to is bad news. <br>
why do the courts assume that elected whites won&rsquo;t/can&rsquo;t represent the needs of mexicns? are mexicans so different that they must have mexican representatives? if that&rsquo;s they case, then what they really need is their own country&hellip;&hellip;.hmmmm </p>

		<p>As the article indicates, this isn&rsquo;t the first time such a system has been used in the country.  I&rsquo;ve personally heard of school boards and county commissions where the voter cast as many ballots as there were positions on the board or commission.  There might be 25 candidates for a five-man board, for instance.  <br>
How this is going to get a Hispanic elected, I&rsquo;m not certain.  As #2 indicates, a neo-Nazi might get elected as well as a Latino.  Whites can still vote for only white (or black, for that matter) candidates.  Did the court figure that liberals would cast a bone or two to the Hispanic candidates?  If I realized this kind of manipulation is going on, I would vote only for whites.  This kind of pressure is as likely to create white solidarity as not.  Certain candidates can use buzz phrases, such as &#8220;I oppose this new rule and will work to see that it&rsquo;s overturned&#8221;, and voters will get the picture.</p>

<p>Cumulative voting does not violate the principle of &#8220;one man, one vote&#8221;.  In this case, there are six seats, and everyone gets six votes.  You can cast one vote for each seat, or six votes for one.  However, it is still, on average, one vote per voter per elected office.</p>
<p>Although you are quite right, of course, that a federal judge has no business imposing this.  Nor is it incumbent on a jurisdiction to be concerned that hispanics do not have representation on a city council.</p>
<p>Proportional Representation (or PR) has been a favorite cause of certain left-wing activists.  And it would undoubtedly result in the election of some hard left candidates.  But then again, in places like New York and San Francisco and Berkeley, hard-lefties have no problem getting elected as it is.  PR might also result in some hard-right candidates winning too.</p>
<p>I might be willing to give PR a try.  It is balkanizing.  However, we are already balkanized.  We&rsquo;re just not adequately represented.</p>

		<p>I noticed Bush&rsquo;s daughter got married by a Black pastor on the Crawford ranch. Both daughters also work with all  these &ldquo;underprivilged&rdquo; black kids.<br>
   &mdash;  -<br>
Barbara Bush, the &ldquo;smarter&rdquo; of W and Laura&rsquo;s twin daughters, now runs some sort of foundation that lobbies for global health care equality, mainly so that black Africans can have health care.<br>
   &mdash;  -</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that endlessly amazing?   Blacks, in general, absolutely HATE the Bushes &hellip; always have and still do.  And yet the Bushes continue to crawl and cater to them, as if they think they&rsquo;re winning them over!  Some people just never learn.</p>
<p>What does that say about Bush intelligence?</p>
<p>And, btw, it&rsquo;s the same story with Hispanics too. Most of them hate the Bushes, no matter how much the Bushes pander to them. <br>
But the Bushes still keep trying.</p>

		<p>S.L. Cain:</p>
<p>The Constitution only requires states to have a certain number of House members, and each state has to have at least one, but they must be apportioned by population.  (Constitutionally, that&rsquo;s the only reason to do a decennial census).  However, it does not specify that there must be Congressional districts within a state, nor that each district has to be drawn equally in terms of population.  (But, Federal courts have ruled that district must be drawn equally.  Well into the 20th century, a lot of states had vastly mismatched populations in all its districts).</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m driving is that is that a good idea to try, in a state with a relatively low number of House districts, and in a state with few non-whites, is such a PR system.  For instance, Kansas has 4 seats.  Instead of dividing up KS into four districts of roughly equal population, have all the people that want to be Congress(wo)men from KS run in a big pool, and give every voter four votes, that the could cast all for one person, one for for people, or any combination.  The top four vote-getters become House members from the state of KS at large. </p>
<p>We could see if that results in a better or worse quality of politician.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be a good idea for California, though.</p>
