<h1>Officials: Harvard Student Will Not Be Deported</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Google News, June 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An undocumented Harvard University student is no longer facing deportation to Mexico after being detained nearly two weeks ago by immigration authorities at a Texas airport, officials said.</p>
<p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said late Friday that they would not pursue the deportation of Eric Balderas. The 19-year-old was detained June 7 after he tried to use a university ID card to board a plane from San Antonio to Boston.</p>
<p>ICE spokesman Brian P. Hale told The Boston Globe that Balderas had been granted deferred action, which can be used to halt deportation based on the merits of a case.</p>
<p>Balderas, who previously had used a Mexican passport to board planes but recently lost it, told The Associated Press that he became despondent and thought he was being deported to Mexico immediately, only to be released the next day.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Remember Sonya &#8220;the wise Latina&#8221; Sotomayor: this is what we get from educating ethnocentric &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; at Ivy league schools.</p>
<p>Educating Mexicans instead of deporting them is a very risky business, indeed. It empowers them by promoting them to American cognitive elite where they can &#8220;work&#8221; on behalf of their ethnies. American universities teach revisionist history that grants the American Southwest to Mexico. MEChA reinforces that &#8220;education&#8221;. They gained notoriety for being incubators of Mexican irredentism and a sense of entitlement among &#8220;Hispanics&#8221;. In particular, they teach Mexicans how to play the race card and how to get elected to American government. </p>
<p>So, one day, the student mentioned in this article may likely become an influential and successful &#8220;American citizen&#8221; advocate of &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; rights to our country, to the detriment of the rest of us.</p>
<p>Useless Feds are equally good at border and immigration enforcement as at mitigating the effects of the oil spill. <br>

		<p>Why should they care about one college student when they have 12 to 18 million illegal Mexicans invading America that they don&rsquo;t seem to care about?<br>
See you in November!</p>

<p>HEY, all this guy needed to do was go to the nearest Mexican consulate and they would provide him with ALL the papers and documents he needed. But he uses a student ID?</p>

		<p>A known illegal is allowed to continue to reside in the U.S., in clear, acknowledged violation of the law.</p>
<p>We know no shame.</p>

		<p>A female is attending college in Atlanta, and was stopped for a speeding violation to discover she had no driver&rsquo;s license as she was illegally here from Mexico. Not only is she attending college as an illegal, she has been receiving in-state tuition and loans. She was arrested, deportation proceedings had begun when the &#8220;no human being is illegal&#8221; crowd bombarded the governor&rsquo;s office. Her hearing has been suspended for a year while she finishes school. Her in-state tuition, however, IS being &#8216;looked into.&rsquo; Yearightsure. </p>

		<p>When I read this story, I thought that there is someone I would like to meet.  That someone is the native born white American who is about 19 years old, who wasn&rsquo;t accepted into Harvard so that this trespasser could be.  We&rsquo;ll never know his or her name, but mark me:  He or she exists.</p>
