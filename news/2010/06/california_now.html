	<p>Report Examines How Immigration Has Changed the Golden State</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, June 10 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/  &mdash;  In 1970, nine percent of California&rsquo;s population was comprised of immigrants; by 2008 it was 27 percent. A new report from the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) finds that as a result of immigration, California now has the least-educated labor force of any state. Historically, California was not a state with a disproportionately large unskilled population, like Appalachia or parts of the South. However, immigration has transformed the state. Absent a change in immigration policy, other parts of the country may be transformed in a similar fashion.</p>
<p>The report, &#8220;A State Transformed: Immigration and the New California,&#8221; can be found at <a href="https://www.cis.org/california-education" target="CIS-report" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>https://www.cis.org/california-education.</b></a>  Among the findings:</p>
<p>* In 1970 California had the 7th most educated work force of the 50 states in terms of the share of its workers who had completed high school. By 2008, it ranked 50th, making it the least-educated state. One in six workers in the state has not graduated high school.</p>
<p>* The decline in education in California is large relative to other states. The percentage of Californians who have completed high school has increased since 1970; however, all other states made much more progress in improving education levels. As a result, California has fallen behind the rest of the country.</p>
<p>* The large relative decline in education in California is a direct result of immigration. Without immigrants, the share of California&rsquo;s labor force that has completed high school would be above the national average.</p>
<p>* There is no indication that California will soon close the educational gap. California ranks 35th in terms of the share of its 19-year-olds who have completed high school. Moreover, one-third of the adult immigrants who settled in the state in 2007 and 2008 had not completed high school, adding 91,000 new unskilled adults to the state.</p>
<p>* In 1970, California was right at the national average in terms of income inequality, ranking 25th in the nation. By 2008, it was the 6th most unequal state in the country based on the commonly used Gini coefficient, which measures how evenly income is distributed.</p>
<p>* California&rsquo;s income distribution in 2008 was more unequal than was Mississippi&rsquo;s in 1970.</p>
<p>* While historical data on welfare are not available, we can say that in 2008 California ranked 11th highest in terms of the share of its households accessing at least one major welfare program and 8th highest in terms of the share of the state&rsquo;s population without health insurance.</p>
<p>* The large share of California&rsquo;s adults who have very little education is likely to strain social services and make it challenging for the state to generate sufficient tax revenue to cover the demands for services made by its large unskilled population.</p>
<p>Discussion. California is home to the high-tech and entertainment industries, has one of the nation&rsquo;s largest tourism industries, and has the most productive agricultural land in the country. Historically, it was not a state with a disproportionately large unskilled population, unlike Appalachia, parts of the American South, or the Rio Grande valley. Relative to other states, it had one of the more educated labor forces in terms of the share of workers who had completed high school. But today it is the state with the largest share of its labor force that has not completed high school.</p>
<p>Analysis of Census Bureau data through 2008 by the Center for Immigration Studies shows this relative change is a direct result of immigration. California has become a state with one of the most skewed income distributions and it is among the states with high rates of welfare use and lack of health insurance. Immigrants in the state are six times more likely than natives not to have completed high school. While some employers argue that a continuing stream of unskilled immigrant workers is desirable, such a policy has consequences. Productivity, standard of living, welfare use, health insurance coverage, and the tax base are heavily impacted by education levels. The low level of educational attainment in the state is likely to create significant challenges for California in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>The Center for Immigration Studies is an independent research institution which examines the impact of immigration on the United States.</p>

		<p>&#8220;One in six California workers never made it through high school.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m laying heavy odds that that stat is way too high.  It&rsquo;s going to be closer to 3 in six.</p>
<p>Too, it&rsquo;s a good thing they never gave the entire state a GED test to see who was qualified on a high school level, because that would probably reveal only one in six passed the test.</p>
<p>Just an additional word about high school graduation rates.  What good does it do to have a 100% graduation rate if none of the students qualify as high school graduates, like the many blacks who are passed simply for showing up most of the time, but still can&rsquo;t read or write?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what is occurring in the real world.  Even most of the non-white teachers, I seriously doubt, could pass a GED high school test.<br>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve all heard the saying, &#8220;As California goes, so goes the nation.&#8221; The state&rsquo;s decline is in no small part due to the demographic transformation brought about by the Ted Kennedy, Lyndon Baines Johnson, Emanuel Cellers Immigration Act of 1965. The state went from being about 80% &#8220;non-Hispanic&#8221; white in 1970 to only 47% in 2000. And I shutter to think what the results of the 2010 census will be. California is on its way to joining the Thrird-World, with the US not far behind. This is a crisis that should absolutely alarm any thinking person, but instead the MSM is obsessed with Natalee Holloway and other nonsense. </p>

		<p>I am not surprised. This proves what I have been saying all along. That illegal immigrants are basically an uneducated, disease ridden, criminal population that will work for lower pay than legal residents and US citizens will. The only way to stop illegal immigrants is to go after those that employ them and levy heavy fines and sanctions. If they are no jobs, there will be no reason for them to sneak across the border.</p>

		<p>Employers absolutely love the uneducated hispanics.  They are the favored employees.  Most California employers don&rsquo;t even bother with employee wanted ads.  Their new hires are referred by their illegal friends and relatives already on the payroll.</p>
<p>Some agribusinesses, hotels and restaurants have 800 numbers in Mexico where Mexicans can learn about job openings.  I would not be surprised to discover that employeers advance the Mexicans theri smugglers fees and transportation costs.  At 50 per cent interest of course.</p>

<p>Everything that the leftists do or want to achieve, always becomes a bazaar of the bizarre: in Russia and China (and among other lesser &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; lands they inspired) &ldquo;equality&rdquo; was to be found through wholesale murder and orchestrated famines; here in the USA, it is to be found basically the same way, only gradually via  &ldquo;undocumented enrichment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They say they are for education, but they turn the word into a joke and the process into a pornographic snuff film. Moreover, they claim to wish to see the obviously unwashed and hopelessly illiterate advanced over the determined and educable not by serious methods, no matter how rigorous, but through overwhelming forced tsunamis of infused &ldquo;diversity.&rdquo; Thus, in the process, destroying the very industrial and agricultural base (what they might call &ldquo;capitalist excesses and exploitations&rdquo;) that theoretically would provide the basis for their Marxist &ldquo;utopia,&rdquo; using the historical dialectic model proposed by Komrade Karl himself.</p>

<p>I agree this would stop some but NOT all, most come to the U.S. for the freebies and to lay their anchor babies..the ILLEGAL ALIENS are the only competition the blacks have for welfare freebies and that competition is fierce indeed.</p>

<p>The government continues to tell us that illegal colonists come here &#8216;to work and do the jobs that Americans refuse to do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>Illegal colonists come here for Free White Money.</p>
<p>And, they are only doing what the current White-hating regime allows them to do.</p>
<p>The only way to get rid of illegal colonists is to militarize the border and promise a bullet to the brain to any Third World denizen that deigns to illegally enter the United States and become a burden to the American people.</p>
<p>Employers caught employing illegal colonists over unemployed Americans should be fined an automatic million dollars with the CEO/owner/employer facing a mandatory one-year prison term and suspension of business license. </p>
<p>A wall, styled after the one the Israelis built should be built immediately, in sections by private contractors, not government workers, with a bonus paid for early completion.</p>
<p>And, as a Libertarian, I believe the welfare state should be immediately dismantled as it serves as a magnet to the world&rsquo;s poor as the poor in the United States live like sultans compared to poor in Third and Fourth world hell holes.</p>
<p>The riots in Europe?  They will spread here, and for the same reason, the same reason the old Soviet Union imploded:  Socialism doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>We now have 50% of the population supporting the other 50% of the population with the dependent side growing at a faster clip than the supporting side.  </p>
<p>Yet, even with high, entrenched unemployment rates, the government continues to allow the southern border to remain wide open, sanctions high levels of legal immigration, imports the most wretched type of refugee from Somalia and Haiti for permanent settlement in White communities and continues to push for amnesty for millions of uneducated illegals who have broken American laws.</p>
<p>Do not think any of this was (is) being done by accident  &mdash;  it is a part of a carefully planned, 50-year old, triangulated effort to displace and dispossess Native White Americans.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to get a lot worse.</p>

		<p>Really?  I thought that as a Southerner I was always supposed to get lectured by my Northern brothers and sisters on how the Deep South has the most ignorant people.</p>
<p>I get into discussions about this sort of thing all the time on online forums.  A lot of Northern liberal whites want to turn it into a blue state/ red state issue.  I ask them why red states like Utah and North Dakota do so well on school tests while blue states like Hawaii and California do so poorly.  I also ask them why schools in Detroit and in Harlem are so horrible&hellip;.they are up in the Great Superior North after all.</p>
<p>I tell them to think really hard about what Detroit, Harlem, Hawaii, California, New Mexico, Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi have in common.  I ask them to think real real hard&hellip;..  I ask them to also think about what Vermont, Maine, West Virginia, Utah, and North Dakota have in common (all states that do well on school tests).</p>
<p>Perhaps this isn&rsquo;t an issue of Bible-clinging, gun-toting, Bubba and Mary Sue down in Mississippi keeping the test standards down.  Maybe it is because of somebody else who lives down there.</p>

		<p>As Jay, Bon and others have pointed out often here, completing high school in certain areas is nothing more than doing a poster board and glitter project that sorta looks like something that the average person could recognize.  So the fact that so many &#8220;Californians&#8221; can&rsquo;t finish high school is frightening just in that regard.</p>

		<p>As California becomes more dumbed down and less productive, a responsible government should prepare its people for a lower standard of living. It&rsquo;ll be a complicated transition to get everyone to lower his expectations so it might be best to start the downward revision with a jolting change. If they prohibited air-conditioning in retail stores that would be uncomfortable but not life threatening. Air-conditioning in stores is a luxury that can&rsquo;t be afforded anymore. The message would be sent that contrary to myth, increasing diversity does not always mean a higher standard of living. Certain people in California had a lot of fun pushing for diversity. They claimed the moral high-ground and called opponents bigots. Now California has to suffer the cost for this social experiment. </p>

<p>They will be used as an army of mindless, useful idiots  &mdash;   whipped into a hateful frenzy, unable to think beyond the slogans, impervious to reason  &mdash;    to carry out the activists&rsquo; dream: eliminating &ldquo;frail, racist, white people&#8221; living on &ldquo;stolen, occupied Mexico.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Well&hellip; to a degree it&rsquo;s true, though.

But it would also drastically reduce  financial contributions to the two parties&rsquo; election campaigns, so we&rsquo;re not likely to see it happen.  </p>

		<p>The only way to put a stop to the illegal invaders would be to educate the voting public, which is a joke. Since they have already been educated. Old Karl would undoubtedly be dancing with joy if it were not so hellish hot where he is. Minnesota has the smartest people? I can certainly agree with that, why just look at the last few governors the have elected, pure rocket science at it&rsquo;s finest. What is the value of being educated when you are going to pick fruit? Uneducated people with extremely low I Q&rsquo;s are the perfect marxist weapons, who will eventually destroy us and, their enablers,possibly without ever firing a single shot. The most divisive man who perhaps ever lived once said united we stand, divided we fall, then he divided us by force and reunited us by force and we have been divided ever since. We should now be known as the Divided States of AmeriKA. &#8220;WOE IS US.&#8221; Those who should be ashamed of themselves are the lefties who have gotten to where they are by doing the very things they pretend to abhor.  </p>

		<p>I teach immigrant students in the northeast, all from latin america.  In general, 99.99% of my students not only do not read books of any kind, they don&rsquo;t even have the concept that books offer something useful or entertaining.</p>
<p>I get them in high school, all newly arrived.  80% of them are at what we would call a third or fourth grade level of skills.  </p>
<p>(Many Columbian, Ecuadorian and Chilean kids are almost on par with American students.  It&rsquo;s the central American, Caribbean and half the Mexican kids who are utterly hopeless.)  </p>
<p>Then we are all told that they have to pass all the state tests and such, when many of them can barely read or write a full sentence - in SPANISH, let alone English.</p>
<p>All the young liberal female teachers put on their rose-colored glasses and pretend these kids, most of them illegal, are just like any suburban American high schooler with equal skills and abilities, and life goes on in la la land.  (Poster board projects, little role plays, some real baby-level work.)</p>
<p>Most of the kids are truly nice and I like them on a personal level, being simple farming folk and all, but about 20% of them are so useless (gangbangers, psychologically insane, criminally-minded, etc) that it&rsquo;s unnerving.  </p>
<p>The same story is repeated in urban schools all over the nation.  Blacks are being squeezed out and forgotten, and most of them migrate to white areas for relief.  The latinos are taking over the cities, and many small towns also.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t like where this is going, especially since when it really gets bad, I&rsquo;m going to be too old to do much about it.</p>

		<p>I am tempted to take offense at the comment concerning uneducated Southerners and those of Appalachia.  Many people from these regions have undergone a diaspora of sorts, leaving their rural and mountain communities (especially with the collapse of the coal industry) to find work elsewhere. Hold your tongue before you dismiss them as &#8220;uneducated.&#8221; These regions have produced some of America&rsquo;s finest writers and most talented singers/songwriters.   </p>
<p>Can California&rsquo;s immigrant community say the same at this point? </p>
<p>There has been so much propaganda and a general &#8220;push&#8221; for more and more immigration.  See the movies &#8220;A Day Without Mexicans&#8221; and &#8220;Quinceanera.&#8221;  Both portray Californian immigrants as innocent victims of white oppression and xenophobia.  Nothing is ever such a cut-and-dry issue.  While I don&rsquo;t hate Hispanics, I do not think they should have license to invade America. Illegal immigration disproportionately hurts low-wage workers, strains our education system, and wreaks havoc on efforts to make English our official language. </p>
<p>And, for the record, I say this as the granddaughter of European immigrants.  </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know which comment you are referring to, but if you are referring to mine above, you completely missed my point.  Sorry if I was unclear, but I was using humor and poking fun at Northern liberals who degrade Southerners.  I myself am a Southerner and I take offense to their jokes too.  That was the whole point of my post.  You missed the humor.</p>

		<p>Courtney, </p>
<p>I should have clarified   &mdash;   I was responding to the article and not your posting.  The article reads, &#8220;Historically, California was not a state with a disproportionately large unskilled population, like Appalachia or parts of the South.&#8221;  <br>

		<p>&#8220;Really? I thought that as a Southerner I was always supposed to get lectured by my Northern brothers and sisters on how the Deep South has the most ignorant people.&#8221;</p>
<p>White people in the South are less educated than whites in other parts of the country.  Who do you think are the people giving money to televangelists?  Residents of Maine and Minnesota?  </p>

<p>Hi Courtney,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Northerner from Boston. (I live in California now to boot.) I am not liberal and I don&rsquo;t bash the South. I could write a book on how much I dislike liberals..it would be a very angry 3000 pages. It&rsquo;s Sunday, so I won&rsquo;t do that&hellip;but you must know that many Northerners and even Californians agree with you.</p>

		<p># 23 Jay my friend, I don&rsquo;t know how old you are now, but I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about having to wait too long before you reach whatever age you consider too old, since the time to act is already past for us all.</p>

<p>This is a straw man argument.  My concern is how liberals ignorantly enjoy attacking Southern &#8220;red necks&#8221; for their &#8220;lack of intelligence&#8221; while not acknowledging how Third World immigrants and blacks have the same &#8220;negative qualities&#8221; of Southerners to the nth degree.</p>
<p>Northern liberals, when bashing the South, aren&rsquo;t comparing whites to whites.  They are comparing Southern whites to everybody else, unless there is something I am missing.</p>
<p>The key words in your above statement are &#8220;less educated than WHITES&#8221;.</p>
