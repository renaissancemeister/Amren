<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A New York hotel is staking its claim to have invented a new hospitality niche  &mdash;  birth tourism. The Marmara Manhattan offers &#8220;an exclusive package for new mothers that wish to give birth in the USA&#8221;, with the additional bonus of the newborn child gaining US citizenship.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Marmara Manhattan [part of the Turkish hospitality chain], which is located in New York&rsquo;s Upper East Side, told The Times: &#8220;What we offer is simply a one-bedroom suite accommodation for $5,100, plus taxes, for a month, with airport transfer, baby cradle and a gift set for the mother.&#8221; There are also medical fees of about £20,500.</p>
<p>However the price is a cheap and easy one to pay for US citizenship. Many will eventually use the newborn  &mdash;  known as an &#8220;anchor baby&#8221;  &mdash;  as a stepping stone for the immigration of extended family.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, the practice is entirely legal as long as the women can pay their medical bills.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>They receive food stamps and social programmes. The American taxpayers are paying for it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Many people say they are doing it because they want their kids to get a cheaper education and not deal with visa issues when they grow up,&#8221; said Levant Bas, of the Istanbul-based operator Gurib Tourism. &#8220;We have a package that covers everything from the flight and city tours to accommodation for several months and hospital expenses.<br>

This is in violation of the constitution.</p>
<p>The birth citizenship clause of the 14th amendment excluded, in the words of Senator Jacob Howard, &#8220;persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers.&#8221;</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t get more explicit than that. Subsequent interpretations by the courts defied the constitution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s up to today&rsquo;s legislators to clean up this mess and reestablish constitutional supremacy.</p>

		<p>When it comes to &#8220;birth tourism&#8221;   &mdash;  - foreigners taking advantage of Uncle Doormat to produce their very own &#8220;American citizen&#8221; while on a visit the U. S.   &mdash;  - South Koreans are the most systematic about it.  From the Los Angeles Times:<br>
 <br>
&#8220;&hellip;One might say it is the ultimate gift that South Korean parents can give their newborns. Those who can cough up the $20,000 or so it costs are coming to the United States by the thousands to give birth so their newborns can have American citizenship &hellip;&#8221;<br>
 <br>
&#8220;So many are doing it that a mini-industry has developed here of agencies that refer expectant mothers to travel agents, immigration lawyers, prenatal clinics, hospitals and even baby-sitters, arranging what are, in effect, package tours for pregnant women.&#8221; (&ldquo;Korean Moms Want &lsquo;Born in USA&rsquo; Babies,&rdquo; May, 2002; see also three-minute video) </p>

		<p>This should be recognized as an act of hostile aggression against our nation, just as any other form of invasion.</p>
<p>If a spy sells military secrets to an enemy, the profitability of transaction doesn&rsquo;t get him off the hook. Likewise, the mere fact that the said hotel makes (good) money of its anti-American business should be no excuse for their (implied) hostility.</p>
<p>I hope to see them tried one day in the court of law. (I would prefer to make them answer for their treachery before a specially appointed tribunal, but this may be difficult to devise.)</p>

		<p>Regarding comment #1</p>
<p>I disagree with the interpretation.</p>
<p>Here is the text from section 1, clause 1 of the 14th amendment:</p>
<p>All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.</p>
<p>This is the opening paragraph and hence is generally applicable, and is only subject to any explicit exclusions stated elsewhere in the amendment.</p>
<p>Jacob Howard stated that this excluded &#8220;persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers&#8221;.</p>
<p>A child born in the US is not a &#8220;foreigner&#8221; at the time of birth because he/she has not applied to be a citizen of any other country and has never lived in any other country. I know of no country that specifically grants citizenship to individuals before they are born.</p>

<p> &#8220;A child born in the US is not a &ldquo;foreigner&rdquo; at the time of birth because he/she has not applied to be a citizen of any other country and has never lived in any other country. I know of no country that specifically grants citizenship to individuals before they are born.&#8221;<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Before they are born?  You&rsquo;re splitting hairs here. We are not discussing unborn children. That is being ridiculously picky. But I&rsquo;ll grant that the clause does need further clarification   &mdash;   and it needs it desperately, given the way it&rsquo;s being mis-interpreted. </p>
<p>Generally, it&rsquo;s assumed that a &#8220;foreign&#8221; child is the child of a foreign parent.  A child born in Belgium to Italian parents is an Italian.  That is automatic. He does not need to apply for citizenship.  If you&rsquo;re saying that he has not yet applied for citizenship in any other country, then are you saying that he is a a stateless person until he has done so?<br>

		<p>&#8220;The basis of the constitutional claim of birthright citizenship is the Citizenship Clause, the first sentence of the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment, which states: &#8216;All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.&rsquo; Not everyone, therefore, born in the United States is automatically a citizen, but only those &#8216;subject to the jurisdiction&rsquo; of the United States. The basic question becomes what that phrase &mdash; the jurisdiction requirement &mdash; is properly understood to mean.&#8221;</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s the crux of it.  Precisely what is meant by &#8220;jurisdiction&#8221;?  Everyone within the boundaries of the United States is <b>subject to US &#8220;law&#8221; </b>- whether citizen or not. Everyone, that is, except those diplomats enjoying diplomatic immunity, who are subject to the laws of their own countries. It was assumed at the time of writing that (if the government was doing its proper job) no one would be living in the US <i>illegally. </i> So that was not addressed.</p>
<p>An excellent example of the old lesson that nothing should ever be assumed!<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
It could be argued further that if Mexicans who reside in foreign countries are still Mexicans and remain subject to the jurisdiction of Mexico (as the Mexican government claims), then they are automatically NOT subject to the jurisdiction of the USA. Thus, Mexico has pulled the carpet out from under its own feet, and their anchor babies cannot be US citizens.</p>
<p>We also need to do something about this legalistic nonsense of dual citizenship. (But closing that loophole is going to be a hard one!) I once ran into a wealthy Afghan/Swiss (living in California) who had about four or five citizenships! I think it included the US, Britain, and Canada. He had a stack of passports. That nonsense has to stop.</p>

		<p><i>&ldquo;A child born in the US is not a &ldquo;foreigner&rdquo; at the time of birth [&hellip;]&#8221;</i></p>
<p>This thesis leads to absurdity. For instance, a child born of a female soldier on an invaded territory would have to be considered &#8220;not a foreigner&#8221; as well. (One can build many other scenarios that lead to similar absurdities, for instance, a child born during international flight over a territory of the country in question, etc.) So, the thesis is false.</p>
<p>The only unproblematic convention here is a legal presumption that a newborn child inherits subject status of its biological mother; in particular, it is subject to the same jurisdiction that its mother is. Because if mother owe allegiance to, say, Mexico, her child inherits it (for instance, she can insist that she takes it back there). This would be very much in line with the &#8220;woman&rsquo;s right to chose&#8221;.</p>
<p>But whatever convention is actually used, treating the clause &#8220;and subject to the jurisdiction thereof&#8221; as a meaningless figure of speech is pure nonsense.<br>

		<p><i>Everyone within the boundaries of the United States is subject to US &ldquo;law&rdquo; - whether citizen or not.</i></p>
<p>There is nothing in the Constitution and its Amendments that would imply that &#8220;subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S.&#8221; and &#8220;subject to the U.S. law&#8221; are synonymous clauses. An example of group that was subject to the U.S. law but excluded from the &#8220;subject to the jurisdiction thereof&#8221; clause at the time of writing 14th Amendment were &#8220;Indians not taxed&#8221;. So the above quotation doesn&rsquo;t settle the problem.</p>
<p>Several contemporary writings explained the &#8220;subject to [&hellip;]&#8221; clause as an exclusion of persons owing allegiance to a foreign power or nation. Since Section 5 of 15th Amendment gives the Congress &#8220;power to enforce, by appropriate legislation&#8221;, all it takes to clear any ambiguity here once and for all is to pass a bill (as opposed to Constitutional Amendment) that would state that 1) &#8220;subject to the jurisdiction&#8221; means &#8220;not owing allegiance to any foreign country&#8221;, and that 2) in case of doubt, the burden of proof is on those who claim the birthright citizenship.<br>

		<p>A few dozen Turk(eys) are preferable to tens of thousands Mexicans a year.If a lot more countries would do this, it just might draw some much needed attention to the absurdity of the birthright law. </p>

		<p>Please remember that American Indians, who were certainly born in the US, were not given citizenship until 1924 and then not by a SCOTUS decision but by a law passed by Congress. Let&rsquo;s pass a law saying that children born to illegal aliens are not citizens and see how it sorts out. What do we have to lose? The worst that will happen is that we will have to pass a constitutional amendment if we fail. And if we succeed, that is wonderful.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s often believed that people have to go to the US in order to make better lives for themselves. However, there are people from Turkey and South Korea who can afford $20,000 to go to the US to have their children. If that&rsquo;s the case, are they really doing that badly without US citizenship?</p>
