<h1><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/jun/14/congressman-wants-obamas-aunt-testify-asylum/">Congressman Wants Obama&rsquo;s Aunt to Testify on Asylum</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen Dinan, Washington Times, June 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After initially being ordered deported, Zeituni Onyango was granted asylum by an immigration judge last month. Rep. Steve King of Iowa, the ranking Republican on the House immigration subcommittee, said that raises questions that she must answer. He said he wants to invite Ms. Onyango to be a witness at a hearing Thursday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to better determine whether favoritism played a role  &mdash;  especially because Ms. Onyango had been earlier turned down for asylum and was ordered to be deported in 2004 before her nephew became president  &mdash;  the subcommittee needs to hear from Ms. Onyango herself,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A spokesman for Ms. Onyango&rsquo;s lawyers said she will not testify, and said Mr. Obama did not exercise influence in the case.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A Democratic aide said Mr. King&rsquo;s move was odd because he didn&rsquo;t follow the usual procedure of inviting witnesses. The aide said usually the minority party secures the witness&rsquo;s agreement first, and then has the panel issue the invitation.</p>

		<p>Lol&hellip;.what disturbs me most about Obama is that favoritism did NOT play a role.  I know that, if I was in Obama&rsquo;s place, I would openly favor my aunt and if anyone didn&rsquo;t like it&hellip;.well, they would quickly learn that being President affords a person a certain amount of power and priveledge that other people do not have.  Family is family and I doubt even the most rabid idealogues would begrudge the president of the united states pulling a few strings to help out someone in his family.</p>
<p>But I have noticed a disturbing callousness of Obama towards his own flesh and blood.  A willingness to allow a brother to waste away in one of the worst slums in the world.  Ignoring an aunt in public housing, etc.  Hey&hellip;how about a couple hundred bucks a month to afford her an apartment.  Why is she on welfare to begin with?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on here is some person (probably some white person) is looking out for this woman because they notice that she is related to Obama&hellip;..meanwhile our psychopathic president could care less about her.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure the judge that finally approved, did it out of &#8216;favoritism&rsquo;, or at least other considerations than pure merit. But seriously, would you want Obama&rsquo;s aunt out in the boonies, where she could be kidnapped? Sure, Obama is popular in Kenya, the aunt wouldn&rsquo;t have /local/ enemies but, she&rsquo;d be an easy target for Al Qaeda / Janjaweed / whoever else wants something. Obama couldn&rsquo;t + wouldn&rsquo;t just abandon her to her fate, and that&rsquo;s all the country needs. </p>
<p>Sure it sets a bad example, but this was the least expensive, least troublesome thing to do. </p>

__</p>
<p>That argument is just silly.   Don&rsquo;t you think Obama has plenty of other relatives in Kenya?   Would you advocate that ALL of them should be brought over here, because just POSSIBLLY some one of them might be kidnapped?  Ridiculous!</p>
<p>(Oh, and don&rsquo;t people get kidnapped in Boston?) </p>

Get that!  The arrogance!  She&rsquo;s giving the finger to Congress.</p>
<p>But what stands out to me is that she has spokesmen and lawyer<i>S</i><br>
(yes, that&rsquo;s in the plural: lawyers with an &#8220;s&#8221;).   <br>
How does someone living in public housing and on welfare manage to afford this extravagance?   Who&rsquo;s paying these people?</p>

		<p>Obama&rsquo;s illegal alien aunt lives in a South Boston housing project (section 8, courtesy of the US taxpayer).  Her amnesty claims are almost certainly a scam.  </p>
<p>The community organizer turned president has plenty of money now.  Why doesn&rsquo;t Obama just buy his aunt a nice house back in her native Kenya?        </p>

		<p>Browser:</p>
<p>Funny you say that.  She&rsquo;s kinda out of style now, but in the 1990s, a St. Louis public housing tenant by the name of Bertha Gilkey was just this type.  She got frustrated with the bad conditions of her project, and shouted and hooted and hollered at one of the citizens meetings.  Immediately, she started flying around all across the country, testifying at legislative committees for public housing, and staying at nice hotels wherever she went.</p>
<p>Now, she lived in public housing because she had to; if she could afford a better neighborhood at market rate rent or mortgage, she would have been there.  So where was she coming up with all this money for airfare and hotels?  Answer:  A lot of &#8220;advocacy&#8221; and &#8220;social justice&#8221; groups were paying her way.  Then that begged the next obvious question:  Why didn&rsquo;t they pay her way to a better part of St. Louis?  I think the answer to that was/is to follow the money.  I bet a lot of these groups that were paying Gilkey&rsquo;s way were being funded by the labor unions, public employee and otherwise, that stood to benefit if the states and Feds ponied up all the money to fix these projects up (or tear them down and rebuild them, as did happen a lot in St. Louis) to the extent that Gilkey wanted.</p>

<p>Yes. They come here, from all over the world, going through any hardship to get here.  And then they complain and complain about how awful it is. </p>
<p>But they refuse to go back when they came from.</p>

<p>And then, within a few years, they would be wrecked again. After all, these projects were all new   &mdash;    once!   Buildings don&rsquo;t get ruined by themselves; it&rsquo;s the people who live in them.</p>
<p>I saw this happen on a block near where I once lived. The buildings were all rehabbed like nice and new, and then rented out. Beautiful new apartments. The whole block.  Within less than five years, they were just as bad as they had ever been before. You would never know thay had been fixed up.</p>
<p>When will the social engineers ever understand that <b>it&rsquo;s not buildings that make slums?</b></p>

		<p>I doubt that Obama knows his Kenyan relatives very well. He has a half-sister there who he never even met until his father&rsquo;s funeral, and the father did go back there when Obama was only three. People often lose contact with each other when they&rsquo;re thousands of miles away from each other.</p>
