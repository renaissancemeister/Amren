<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In February 1961, Barack Obama&rsquo;s parents did something that was illegal in 22 states and that 96% of the population disapproved of: they got married. In fact, interracial marriage, sex and cohabitation would remain illegal in much of the U.S. for another six years. Then on June 12, 1967, in the case Loving v. Virginia, the Supreme Court unanimously struck down the country&rsquo;s anti-miscegenation laws, allowing interracial couples across the country to marry. Thirteen years after Brown v. Board of Education, the court took the last legal teeth out of the Jim Crow era, ridding the U.S. of its last major piece of state-sanctioned segregation. June 12 has since become a grass-roots holiday in the U.S., especially for multiracial couples and families. Known as Loving Day, the celebration commemorates the 1967 case and fights prejudice against mixed-race couples, and is a reason to throw an awesome, inclusive party.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} As late as 1987, a full 20 years after the case, only 48% of Americans said it was acceptable for blacks and whites to date. That number has since jumped to 83%, according to the Pew Research Center. In 2010, the center estimated that 1 in 7 new marriages in the U.S. is now an interracial coupling. In 1961, the year Obama&rsquo;s parents married, only 1 in a 1,000 marriages included a black person and a white person; today, it&rsquo;s 1 in 60.</p>
<p>The idea for Loving Day came from one person, Ken Tanabe. In 2004, while a student at Parsons the New School for Design, Tanabe created Loving Day as part of his senior thesis. Growing up, he had never heard of the Lovings, and as a person of mixed-race heritage, he wanted that to change. He created a website to educate people about the history of mixed-race marriages and encouraged people to host their own Loving Day gatherings to create an annual tradition for the mixed-race community. In 2004, there were two large public celebrations  &mdash;  one in New York City and one in Seattle. Now Loving Day is the biggest multiracial celebration in the U.S., with public events in most large cities across the country. {snip}<br/>

								<h2>Younger People Least Likely to Object to Interracial Marriage</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Meredith Moss, Dayton Daily News, June 12, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Interracial marriage in Ohio, once punishable by imprisonment and fines, has tripled since 1980, reflecting a national trend.</p>
<p>The percentage of marriages between spouses of different races is at an all time high, according to a new study released by the Pew Research Center. About one in seven marriages in the country is now interracial or interethnic.</p>
<p>Ohio is below the 14.6 percent national average. The intermarriage rate in the Buckeye State was 3 percent for new marriages in 1980, 9 percent in 2008.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When people were asked how they felt about a relative marrying outside of their race, depending upon their race, about 80 percent of those in their 20s said it would be &#8220;fine,&#8221; while only one-third of whites older than 65 said they would find it acceptable.</p>

		<p> Notice the warmly approving tone of both pieces? &#8220;Two-four-six-eight, let&rsquo;s all go miscegenate!&#8221; That seems to be the attitude of most of these mainstream media, bleeding-heart liberal, self-hating White reporters. Or, in some cases, non-White reporters chosen for the assignment precisely because they can be counted on to write positive puff pieces about our ongoing racial suicide.</p>
<p> It&rsquo;s interesting how they point out the highest approval percentage for miscegenation is among young people, as if their generation has become &#8220;enlightened&#8221; (ironic word, that!), and that the obliteration of the White race can go on apace as soon as all of us nasty old White racists finish dying off. Of course, it&rsquo;s not &#8220;enlightenment,&#8221; for pity&rsquo;s sake; it&rsquo;s &#8220;brainwashing&#8221; on the part of government, schools and the media for the last 50 years or so.</p>
<p> And we White Americans did it to ourselves, sad to say, with our diminishing interest in having children, our passage of re-written immigration laws that favor the darker-skinned world, and the idiotic acceptance, by many of us, of the unscientific notion that there is &#8220;no such thing as race.&#8221; </p>

		<p>With figures such as these, is it even worth it trying to fight anymore?</p>
<p>Racism is actually much more prevalent among the youth than one might expect (being one, I think I have a good vantage point). In fact, my liberal social studies teacher back in high school once scolded our class saying, &#8220;We teachers know you guys are racist.&#8221; My junior year they implemented a &#8220;diversity awareness&#8221; club which sponsored a &#8220;world flag celebration.&#8221; At the &#8216;celebration,&rsquo; all 10 of our black students huddled together on the bleachers whereupon a teacher sitting next to me (with whom I am quite close) pointed at the black separation and remarked, &#8220;There&rsquo;s your diversity for ya.&#8221;</p>
<p>As an aside, I confronted the &#8216;guidance counselor&rsquo; -the guy had a bachelor&rsquo;s in communication- about the pathetic dog &amp; pony show displayed, whereon he, in typical liberal fashion, became redfaced &amp; angry. I found it odd he that that was his final year there. My first interaction with an ideological liberal.</p>

		<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t object to people marrying who they love.</p>
<p>If there are two people, such as a white man and an Asian woman, who love each other, is it really fair for us to say they can&rsquo;t get married simply because they don&rsquo;t belong to the same race?</p>
<p>Yes, I love my race and heritage; yes, I&rsquo;m opposed to all the double standards against our people; yes, I&rsquo;m opposed to the mass invasion of foreign, non-white aliens into our lands, making us minorities in our own countries; and yes, I want to see our race preserved &mdash; but will a few interracial marriages wipe the white race off the face of the earth? Of course not.</p>
<p>If any of you oppose miscegnation on a personal level and refuse to date or marry others of a different race, fine; but don&rsquo;t judge interracial couples.</p>

		<p>Well, the first article is clearly &ldquo;dedicated&rdquo; to the truth:</p>

From that day forward, a slow march toward all but forced miscegenation had begun,&rsquo;</p>
<p>2.) &ldquo;Known as Loving Day, the celebration commemorates the 1967 case and fights prejudice against mixed-race couples, and is a reason to throw an awesome, inclusive party,&rdquo;</p>

<p>3.) &ldquo;Now Loving Day is the biggest multiracial celebration in the U.S., with public events in most large cities across the country,&rdquo;</p>
<p>That should read:  &lsquo;Now Loving Day is the biggest multiracial celebration in the U.S.S.A, with public events in most large cities across the country; oddly these are never attended by any large number of white people that are not classified as mentally ill; intellectually deficient; or the combination of the two, outright Communists.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s see a statistical breakdown of the figures.  Interracial and interethnic are two different things whereas the latter could be an Italian married to a German.  Take out the interethnic marriages and nonwhites married to nonwhites and I suspect you&rsquo;ll be left with a much lower figure than 1 in 7.  </p>

You know, I just finished reading &#8220;Camp of The Saints&#8221; by Jean Respail. In it, once the Ganges mob took over southern France, the provisional French government legalized, essentially, the rape of white women. They allowed for brothels in Nice and they appointed a traitorous white women who was married to a black as Minister for Population. Respail depicted the Left perfectly in his book. Sadly it is all happening now&hellip;</p>

		<p>Do you favor White genocide? Or do you oppose White genocide?</p>
<p>Mixing a superior substance with an inferior substance is NOT a method of progress.  It is a method of stagnation and decline.  OJ Simpson and Tiger Woods found White blonds and then created mongrels that neither men would consider dating!  The White blonds, and all other race-mixing White people, turned their backs on thousands of generations of their ancestors, and forever shut the down on thousands of generations of future descendants.  HONOR your blood, honor, and heritage!   </p>
<p>When someone tells you about the brilliant mongrel they know, or says that not all miscegeny results in inferior stock, point out that the law of large numbers (averages) trumps exceptions, always, for long-term social trends.  </p>
<p>Provide the violent and illiterate mestizos (fine European Spaniards mongrelized with savage Amerinds) as an example of a lowered genetic stock.  Point out the difference between North America (mostly cleared out Amerinds, created White stock) and South America (brought no wives and thus created a mongrelized mestizo stock).  Notice any differences, despite South America&rsquo;s greater share of natural resources?  Calling Jared Diamond&hellip;</p>
<p>ONLY White people are expected to accept miscegeny and mongrelization in ALL White countries.  This is White genocide.  Read part (c) of the 1948 UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.</p>
<p>If we reestablish White homelands and regain control of the international scene, expect to see TRIBUNALS where the architects of White genocide will face severe penalty.  </p>

		<p>As many have said, I keep hearing about this &#8216;integration&rsquo; but all I see around me is self-segregation.  Sure I&rsquo;ll have coffee with someone from another race, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I have any intention of marrying them or living next to them.  If you look around you, you&rsquo;ll see much the same. </p>
<p>@7) I wouldn&rsquo;t hold any real concern seeing young people of different races hang out.  One of my best friends that happened to hang out with blacks more than anyone else(and I always considered somewhat of a race-denier, even if he never said a peep to me about race) I knew once remarked to me how the world would be a better place without &#8220;all those blacks and browns.&#8221;  It was a completely off topic comment and nearly made me spew my drink.  Don&rsquo;t believe everything you see.</p>
<p>As I stated earlier in a previous article(and I believe someone backed up my suspicions with statistics) I simply don&rsquo;t see an epidemic of young people marrying interacially.  Break the statistics down by age as well as race, as well as whether or not the person in question that&rsquo;s remarrying already has children.</p>
<p>Older people are much more willing to cross the racial boundary when they re-marry.  </p>

		<p>OK, I think we all agree that it&rsquo;s MSM brain washing that is the root cause of white miscegenation, so what are we going to do about it? Speak out and try to educate people about the facts on race, boycott companies that promote white miscegenation, vote the right people into office and (of course) help American Renaissance grow. </p>

		<p>   I get tired of the same old worn-out arguments used by Neo-Marxist Multiculturalists to advance miscegenation: genetically we all come out of Africa &mdash; the African Eve; we&rsquo;re all mixed racially, so why object?  I say look at the countries that have large black and white mixed populations: Brazil, Egypt, Venezuela, etc. Do these countries make a good impression on you? Would you want to live there? Has racism really ever been eliminated by miscegenation? Why are mulattos running so many mixed black countries (Haiti, Jamaica, etc.)?  Why does the great liberal dream of the elimination of racism through miscegenation not work?</p>

		<p>I, like a few of the commenters, have no objection to the idea of so-called interracial friendships, romances, and marriages.  Where the matter becomes problematic is when those involved have their heads in the clouds and don&rsquo;t look at the situation realistically.  For instance, white women who might be willing to date a non-white shouldn&rsquo;t just be willing to date ANY non-white just to prove to herself and/or others that she&rsquo;s not bigoted.  A low-class, criminal black man is at least as bad as a low-class, criminal white man (and likely worse).  <br/>
And I don&rsquo;t worry about the white race disappearing because of interbreeding.  Non-whites are as likely to become washed out in the mixture as not.</p>

		<p>&#8220;If there are two people, such as a white man and an Asian woman, who love each other, is it really fair for us to say they can&rsquo;t get married simply because they don&rsquo;t belong to the same race?&#8221;</p>
<p>The couple are usually quite happy and self satisfied, but the half-breed children aren&rsquo;t.  Many have Caucasian faces and Asian eyes, making them different and separate from everyone around them. They grow up with a higher than average incidence of depression and some with unique health problems.</p>
<p>The parents experience none of what the child goes through.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re mistaken.</p>
<p>Unless the couple are living alone on an isolated island, society has a strong interest in these things and it has a say about who marries whom. Marriage is a social institution having a profound effect upon all of society.  It is not a purely private matter of personal gratification, and of no one else&rsquo;s concern.</p>
<p>If they have children, those children will be part of society   and will become part of the gene pool. Those children and their descendents will live on long after their parents infatuation with each other is over and the parents are dead. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not without good reason that even the most primitive tribes everywhere in the world recognize marriage as a social institution and not a purely private arrangement that is nobody else&rsquo;s business.</p>

		<p>This article seems to celebrate the choice made by Barack Obama&rsquo;s mother.  She was motivated by hate for her father that was projected to white males, the boredom of Kansas, and her desire for attention.  Our already poisoned system brought an undeserving Kenyan to an Ivy League university as a social experiment.  All they did was to provide bratty white girls with a way to hurt their parents, and Obama&rsquo;s father did it a number of times, beating the women he impregnated on the way.  So our president is the product of hate, not love.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Yet another reason to live in the country&#8221;</p>
<p>From what I&rsquo;ve seen, race-mixing is as common as dirt in the country as well as the cities. I live in a small town in fly-over country and there are mixed couples everywhere. No, scratch that. There are white women with half-black babies everywhere. The baby daddies never seem to be around.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really kind of mind-boggling. These pathological fads are everywhere these days: black &#8220;boyfriends,&#8221; rap music, piercings, tattoos. I can&rsquo;t prove this, but based on my own observations, I&rsquo;d say that the percentage of mixed-race &#8220;marriages&#8221; is a lot higher than the official statistics would lead you to believe.</p>

		<p>   I think many whites mix because they either don&rsquo;t know or are not proud of their history/heritage. In the South, heritage was a big thing, but even here it&rsquo;s been declining rapidly. In the last twenty years our Southern schools have utterly failed us in teaching history and culture; the love of the land and our people. Many whites are ashamed of Southern History &mdash; they are ashamed of themselves.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that many Italian Americans have resisted mixing with blacks because of their lack of racial guilt (a heavy burden is unduly placed by liberals on Anglo Americans) and their genuine love of Italian culture. In many cases, they still have that sense of community that other white ethnic groups have either lost or been robbed of by self-hating, minority-loving multiculturalists. We need to get back to that as a means of survival as a people. <br/>

		<p>So what are you going to do about it? The white race has lost the moral high ground and most of its members no longer have any interest in our survival as a race, or are actively hostile to that survival.<br/>
If we are to survive as a people, racially conscious whites really must seek each other out, live in the same neighbourhoods,form a community of our own, employ each other, patronise each others businesses, marry each others sons and daughters, have lots of children and bring them up in the right way and in the right beliefs. Then we will survive the gathering racial chaos around us and one day - one day - our descendants will recover everything that our generation has lost.</p>

		<p>The way to track miscegenation artifacting through a racial gene pool is to look at the grandkids and invasion routes.</p>
<p>Where you have Huns and Mongols coming into Eastern Europe throughout the late and post-Roman period, you have a largely endogamous pool in modern Poland with few Asian haplotype groups.  Why?  Were rape victims killed or driven out, dragged back to the steppes or their children castrated?</p>
<p>Transfer that to the modern setting.  How many hybrids breed back to their parent races?  Twenty Percent?  Sixty Percent?  I&rsquo;m gonna bid low and say it&rsquo;s about 15% which means that the other 85% will have to find subsequent partners among other pop group &#8216;identity exiles&rsquo; and in the process, even further break down the &#8216;familiarity gauges&rsquo; by which phenotypic recognition is a _genetic instinct_ as much as an imprinted behavioral affinity.</p>
<p>One which finds no harmony in most other group features.</p>
<p>Which may mean that as each generation adds hybrid features, behaviors and identity issues through the genetics that drive them, they may become more fertility depressed and/or islanded as population elements.  Until they are lost.</p>
<p>There are obviously exceptions.  Jessica Alba comes to mind as someone whose multiracial heritage was found highly attractive.</p>
<p>But the real sadness is that we are not moving FAST ENOUGH in reporting the realities of genetics on things like intelligence and altruism and social conformity.</p>
<p>Not simply as the strengths and weaknesses of given characteristics within specific races but the -nature- of ingrained behaviors.</p>
<p>I think, once we are forced to admit that we are indeed fighting against a predisposition in our genes to select normed characteristics as &#8216;average&rsquo; selection requirements within the group; we will finally be forced to start asking ourselves if we wish to fight our natural imperatives to refine and elevate specific, associated, abilities.</p>
<p>If we wish to abandon instinct.</p>
<p>Which is where things like &#8216;hybrid vigor&rsquo; (so recently attributed to men like Tiger Woods and our President) will have to be better explained as something which appears to transfer dominant genetic patterns from each racial group in creating highly energized individuals.</p>
<p>But which may ultimately do damage by -halving- recessive traits (blue eyes, blonde hair, certain types of intelligence) which may well have &#8216;built up in our junk gene drawer&rsquo; through cousin-of-a-cousin thrice removed inbreeding in such a way that certain races are naturally, epigenetically, preconditioned to select for as leveraging abilities.</p>
<p>If you halve the number of those replicated, recessive, allele groups with assortive mating between pop groups, suddenly the selection rate for those rare traits also goes down and with it comes an immediate, depressive, period of _hybrid slump_ after the first generation.</p>
<p>Of course, this path also opens up questions about how we might truly &#8216;fix things&rsquo;, if we wanted to.</p>
<p>Physically supporting one kid or two isn&rsquo;t all that much difference once they are here.  It&rsquo;s mostly about time and pain in getting them delivered.</p>
<p>A pretty woman, rendered mediocre -and- dated in her work expertise by two births is looking at another 2-4 years, minimum, before she can responsibly leave her children alone, even with daycare.  Failures in this act of familial intimacy result in failure to bond socially at the most basic level and often social atrophy that shows up later in the child&rsquo;s development.</p>
<p>There is also the matter of forced marriage and costly divorce as a function of this exclusive maternalism and the vindictive, resentment it breeds in the socially disadvantaged female.</p>
<p>So remove all three conditions with exogenics.</p>
<p>And apply gene therapy at optimum retroviral insert points of zygote splits in an unharmable womb environment that can be closely monitored for any genetic defects.</p>
<p>Bang, you have optimized evolutionary growth paths that conserve critical DNA advantages in the parents and maybe even add a few more.</p>
<p>IF you want equality as the means to &#8216;fair competition&rsquo; as social levelling.  And IF you are willing to look at the genetics behind things like a 10-15 point IQ difference that hasn&rsquo;t changed in a century&rsquo;s worth of Flynn Effect (black-white-asian-jewish) this could be a way forward for all of us.</p>
<p>But it all has to start with some principle understandings about the biological origins of prejudice, the purpose of genetic recombinancy (to create -more- &#8216;competitive&rsquo; species ideals within a given environment and pop group) and, for want of a better word, the &#8216;social genetics&rsquo; consequences behind the current fascination with interracialism as it&rsquo;s own love-connection effect rather than something with multigenerational biologic consequences.</p>
<p>The student has to grow up enough to recognize the value in the lessons.</p>

		<p>Although treasonous sociologists made miscegnation legitimate invariably the mixed race couples and their mulatto broods are on the far left end of intelligence and social status. Look at well off intelligent couples and they are always both white</p>

You raise an interesting point.  Which is that the number of marriage licenses don&rsquo;t necessarily equate with the number of babies. Not where blacks are concerned!</p>

Yes, estimating the amount of miscegenation that&rsquo;s going on by looking at the number of marriages doesn&rsquo;t really tell us much    &mdash;   where blacks are concerned.</p>
<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t generally bother themselves with petty little details like that. If it feels good, they just do it.</p>
