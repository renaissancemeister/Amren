			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Slevin and Karen Tumulty, Washington Post, June 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For all the millions that both sides spent on the bruising Arkansas Senate Democratic primary race, Yvonne Thomas admits she went to the polls not having much of a sense about the candidates.</p>
<p>What she did know, and what turned out to be the only thing that mattered in her decision to cast her ballot for the embattled incumbent Blanche Lincoln, was this: &#8220;Obama wanted us to vote for her,&#8221; said Thomas, who is African American.</p>
<p>Unlike in much of the South, in Arkansas it is a rare thing for the black vote to be the decisive factor in elections. African Americans here account for 16 percent of the population  &mdash;  about half their percentage in Georgia to the east. Arkansas is the only state from the Confederacy that has never elected a black candidate to Congress, or to any statewide office, since Reconstruction.</p>
<p>But in this election, Lincoln and her Democratic primary challenger, Lt. Gov. Bill Halter, battled hard to win black voters. The intensity of that courtship was evidenced by the large number of African Americans who stood onstage Tuesday night with Lincoln as she celebrated a victory that the smart money in Washington had declared to be all but out of reach.</p>
<p>The black vote &#8220;was definitely something we had to pay close attention to,&#8221; said campaign manager Steve Patterson the day after Lincoln&rsquo;s victory.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Lincoln beat Halter in all but one of the Arkansas counties with the largest African American populations, said Janine A. Parry, director of the Arkansas Poll; by comparison, in the May 18 primary, he took two.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lincoln already held a sizable advantage with Arkansas&rsquo; African American voters before being forced into a runoff. In the initial primary matchup in May, Lincoln beat Halter 58 to 42 percent among blacks, compared with her much narrower 44 to 43 percent performance across the electorate, Patterson said.</p>
<p>{snip} Obama&rsquo;s imprimatur may have added as many as six percentage points to Lincoln&rsquo;s total, by reassuring African Americans and white liberals.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s a great deal of magic to President Obama in the black community,&#8221; agreed state Sen. Joyce Elliott, an African American candidate who won the Democratic primary for a Little Rock-based congressional seat. Elliott&rsquo;s own candidacy may have increased black voter turnout in populous Pulaski County, which went decisively for Lincoln on May 18 and in Tuesday&rsquo;s runoff.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The president taped just one 30-second advertisement for Lincoln, but she made sure that his endorsement echoed widely in the Arkansas black community. {snip}</p>

		<p>Meanwhile, Halter was endorsed by all the unions that Obama supposedly loves so much, like the SEIU and AFSCME.  You have to think that in Arkansas, most SEIU and AFSCME members are black.</p>
<p>I think what helped Blanche Lincoln out more than anything is Bill Clinton&rsquo;s endorsement.</p>

<p>Magic?? As in fooling whitey to vote for him? or his ability to make white money disappear?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Obama&rsquo;s imprimatur may have added as many as six percentage points to Lincoln&rsquo;s total, by reassuring African Americans and white liberals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notice the important connotations there. </p>
<p>Which Whites? &#8220;&hellip;white liberals&#8221;.</p>
<p>Which African Americans? &#8220;All&#8221; is implied.</p>
<p>My friends, while Whites are divided politically, Blacks are very united, politically. They vote as a block. The White vote is split. It has been this way for quite some time.</p>
<p>It comes down to White Liberals and virtually all Blacks against White Conservatives.</p>

		<p>Have there been any gushing articles lately about &#8220;the <i>White</i> vote,&#8221; or the &#8220;power of <i>White</i> voters&#8221; or the <i>White</i> voter turnout?&#8221;</p>

		<p>While I believe one should vote for the candidate who has the best interests of the state or nation as whole in mind I have no problem with blacks voting for a black candidate.  My problem is that the press never denounces voters who vote for a black candidate because he (or she) is black as racist.  A white who votes for a white candidate because he is white is denounced as racist.  A white who votes for a white candidate rather than a black candidate because they believe the white candidate to be a better choice has their motives impugned.  The MSM will say that &#8220;better qualified&#8221; is just code for &#8220;I only vote white&#8221; or some such drivel.</p>
<p>I would just like to see the press become more even handed.  It would be nice if a white billionaire would buy a publication like Newsweek, a publication that already has wide circulation and turn it into a fair minded, honest publication.  I think there is a market for such a publication.  Starting one from scratch, without name recognition and a broad retail base, would be next to impossible because such a new publication, regardless of how truthful and honest it was, would be denounced as racist and would never be seen in supermarket, quick mart or book store news stands.<br>

		<p>This primary win is very important.  A wake up call to democrats that their unholy alliance among various identity groups is a pointless charade.  The very second, one group gets an upper hand, in any way, it mercilessly plunges a knife into the backs of the other identity groups.  Obama made this clear on the national level, by marginalizing first the feminists, then the anti-war movement, then the gays, and now the environmentalists.</p>
<p>But that was only a prelude of things to come, as this primary shows.  The blacks were ONLY willing to vote for the black candidate, no matter who he was, or his ability to win, let alone govern successfully.  It mattered NOTHING to them what the national party strategy was&hellip;..if they even knew about.  They knew nothing about who they voted for and cared about nothing, except one thing&hellip;.the color of his skin.</p>
<p>The democratic party has lost the ability to work as a cogent group towards collective goals.  It cannot field candidates that can win because the various allies of convenience care NOTHING for each other.  They won&rsquo;t work together anymore.</p>
<p>This is just an extreme example of something that will destroy the democratic party.  They are hoisted by their own petard.  They wanted racial politics&hellip;..they got it.</p>

		<p>As I read this article I think of what I read about Argentina the other day.  Argentina was in the top ten wealthiest nations in the world around the turn of the 20th century. </p>
<p>Then in 1912 they began to expand suffrage.  And guess what, the leftist parties began to win elections!  Look at them now, a shadow of their former selves.</p>
<p>Sounds strangely familiar doesn&rsquo;t it?  When you expand the vote to the indigent and overly emotional, should you be surprised when you get an indigent and overly emotional country?</p>
<p>I think it would be impossible to revoke suffrage for select groups but we would do well to create a system where your vote gains a little more weight with your contribution to society.  Then we won&rsquo;t be at the whims of those who vote according to Obama&rsquo;s bidding like we are now.</p>
