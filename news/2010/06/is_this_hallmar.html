<h1><a href="http://www.ocregister.com/entertainment/card-251715-graduation-hallmark.html">Is This Hallmark Graduation Card Racist?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Orange County Register, June 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hoops and Yoyo, the cartoon stars of one of Hallmark&rsquo;s most popular lines, are created and voiced by Hallmark artists Bob Holt and Mike Adair, an Orange County native.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s startling to see the fun-loving pair hauled into the court of local TV to be accused of racism by the Los Angeles chapter of the NAACP.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Printed on the card, is dialogue such as, &#8220;Watch out, Saturn, this grad is gonna run rings around you!&#8221; And on the audio chip that plays once the card is opened, Hoops and Yoyo continue their riffing on all the things new graduates are going to do once they get out there to take on the universe.</p>
<p>Including: &#8220;And you black holes  &mdash;  you&rsquo;re so ominous! And you planets? Watch your back!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sounds like an innocent enough reference to that peculiar feature of the solar system known as a black hole to us. But members of the NAACP hear it differently, saying the high-pitched voice of Hoops  &mdash;  or Yoyo, we still can&rsquo;t keep &rsquo;em straight  &mdash;  says &#8220;black whores&#8221; and is a racist slur against African-American women.</p>
<p>Hallmark&rsquo;s response to KABC was to defend the card  &mdash;  which has been sold for three years now with no complaints  &mdash;  as not being racist at all, but then to go ahead and pull it from all its stores anyway.<br>

								<h2><a href="http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&amp;id=7475737">NAACP Calls Hallmark Graduation Card Racist</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Miriam Hernandez, KABC-TV, June 2, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>A graduation card sold at local stores has been pulled from shelves after a civil rights group raised concerns about the content. The group claims the card&rsquo;s micro-speaker plays a greeting that&rsquo;s racist.</p>
<p>It is a graduation greeting from Hallmark that says, &#8220;Hey world, we are officially putting you on notice.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;And you black holes, you are so ominous. Watch your back,&#8221; the card vocalizes.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was very demeaning to African American women. When it made reference to African American women as whores and at the end, it says &#8216;watch your back,&rsquo;&#8221; said Leon Jenkins of the Los Angeles NAACP.</p>
<p>When Hallmark was reached by phone, they said the card is all a misunderstanding. The card&rsquo;s theme is the {snip} power the grad will wield.</p>
<p>&#8220;The intent here is to say that this graduate is not afraid of anything,&#8221; explained Hallmark spokesman Steve Doyal.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;You hear the &#8216;r&rsquo; in there. &#8216;Whores,&rsquo; not, &#8216;holes.&rsquo; The &#8216;r&rsquo; is in there,&#8221; said Minnie Hatley of the Los Angeles NAACP.</p>
<p>Hallmark sent Eyewitness News a transcript of what the card says, but Hatley says that the actual audio raises questions.</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds like a group of children laughing and joking about blackness, again,&#8221; said another NAACP member.</p>
<p>Hallmark is now notifying all of its stores to pull the card. Walgreens and CVS are doing the same.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, NAACP members say they do not want to see the card on store shelves ever again.<br>

Now that the NAACP has tackled the issue of graduation cards, are they going to tackle the issue of rap lyrics?</p>
<p>Certainly more black kids will hear the demeaning and degrading lyrics found in rap than would ever hear in garbled dialog from a graduation card.</p>
<p>How long before they ask for tolerance, inclusion, and sensitivity classes? Then jobs and money as compensation for pain and suffering.</p>
<p>Why do these people wonder why we avoid them?</p>

		<p>What never ceases to amaze me is that black leaders never, ever feel even slightest bit embarrassed when they pull a Fred Sanford.  And the fact that Hallmark pulled the card because some ignoramus doesn&rsquo;t know the difference between the term &#8220;black hole&#8221; and the ghetto slang term &#8220;black ho&#8221; is even worse.  We are a second world nation quickly sliding towards third worldism.<br>

		<p>Blacks, i.e. &#8220;the moral story of this country,&#8221; have the privilege of calling anything racist that they want. Just by their calling it racist, makes it both de facto and de jure racist.</p>

Every time Liberal White Elites encounter Unbridled Black Racism and Imbecility, it weakens their case for demanding our embracing Diversity and that &#8220;we must do more to atone for the sins of segregation.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a problem with the cards, but it pleases me to no end to see that Hallmark is taking what it regularly dishes out.  As one of Kansas City&rsquo;s biggest corporate citizens, Hallmark is always dumping a lot of money on left-wing causes in Missouri and Kansas.  It was the big money source against CCW in Missouri, and probably also Kansas, meaning that friends don&rsquo;t let friends buy Hallmark.</p>

		<p> Only a lunkhead, or someone deliberately trying to cause trouble, would misinterpret what the card said. Flip a coin as to which the NAACP is, collectively. Hallmark should have told the racial agitators to go take a hike, and kept the cards on the shelves. But of course, all anyone has to be in 21st Century America is yell, &#8220;Racism!&#8221; and everybody goes weak in the knees and caves in   &mdash;   just as Hallmark did. Shame on them.</p>
<p> As I&rsquo;ve said here before, when are some people going to start giving the NAACP some of its own medicine? File some humongous lawsuits against it (you think a smart lawyer couldn&rsquo;t find some very valid reasons to? Then you don&rsquo;t know lawyers). Force it to defend itself   &mdash;   over and over again. Hit it good and hard in the pocketbook, where it really hurts. Maybe then it wouldn&rsquo;t be so quick to pull its shakedown games.</p>

		<p>Does anyone really wonder why there are so few blacks in the space program? They hear astronomical terms as racial slurs. The NAACP obviously has no clue as to how ignorant this makes them look. And who was it who popularized the term &#8220;ho,&#8221; anyway? Contrary to Ms. Hatley&rsquo;s assertion, the &#8220;r&#8221; is not usually pronounced by blacks. </p>
<p>And let us not forget the earlier story of a white Detroit (?) city council member who was castigated for using the term &#8220;black hole.&#8221; In that case, there was no claim of it being confused with &#8220;whore,&#8221; it was just called a racist term in and of itself. I guess the NAACP didn&rsquo;t think they could get away with such a charge in this instance, but if you asked them, I&rsquo;ll bet most of them would admit that they think the term black hole is racist in itself.</p>

		<p>Black holes are in our galaxy. If they were in our solar system, like this reporter indicated, we would not be here. But seriously, this reminds me of the video of a city council meeting were the white said that it seems like money is being sucked into a black hole. A black said &#8220;you mean a white hole&#8221;. The whites explained that it was a scientific term but the blacks demanded an apology. Imagine if there were no whites on that council. The city would be screwed. Doesn&rsquo;t this reporter know that whatever whites say is automatically offensive. </p>

		<p>Apparently the NAACP doesn&rsquo;t pay very close attention to the rap &#8220;artists&#8221; who spew their vile degradations of women, black or otherwise, in their infantile rantings.  As suggested above, if the NAACP can&rsquo;t find something to whine and throw a tantrum about, they just create it.  They need to grow up, but that is something obviously beyond their abilities.</p>

		<p>When I was a child in the forties and fifties, blacks were virtually ignored in the commercial world.  There were a few geegaws, dolls, postcards, etc. that almost invariably made fun of them.  Now, after a half century and every conceivable attempt being made to mainstream the group, every presentation of them is subject to ignorant complaints that are treated as legitimate by the MSM.  It&rsquo;s time for commerce to start ignoring them again.</p>

		<p>Poets, lyricist and copywriters all need to be sensitive to extraneous connotations of the words they use.  Hallmark is in the business of making money.  The use of the phrase &#8220;black hole&#8221; was kinda dumb, IMHO.  Why not &#8220;Jupiter, you are so ominous?&#8221;  That would have the added benefit of referencing a white pagan deity.</p>

		<p>They need to have this black man astronomer [De Grasse Tyson] who appears on TV all the time explain to the organization for Colored People that a black hole is not what the NAACP thinks it is. An astronomical object. OH, this is just so hard to understand. I just cannot understand it.</p>
<p>There are believed perhaps to be white holes too in outer space. White wormholes I think they call them. Give off energy and matter. A black hole totally absorbs both. A black hole is bad, a white hole is good!! A black hole destroys only a white hole creates!</p>

<p>To appease them, we&rsquo;ll have to end up re-writing the entire dictionary and re-making the English language.</p>
<p>But since words change meanings and new ones are invented, by the time they&rsquo;re finished revising English, they&rsquo;re going to have to start out all over again!   They will have created new terms to replace the banished old ones. Back to the starting line!</p>

<p><i>&ldquo;You hear the &lsquo;r&rsquo; in there. &lsquo;Whores,&rsquo; not, &lsquo;holes.&rsquo; The &lsquo;r&rsquo; is in there,&rdquo; said Minnie Hatley of the Los Angeles NAACP.</i></p>
<p>Nonsense!  There are some American accents that do or don&rsquo;t pronounce their &#8220;R&rsquo;s&#8221;, and some that drop them or insert them where other people would not. [e.g. In Boston, &#8220;Ha&rsquo;vaa&rsquo;d Yaa&rsquo;rd&#8221;;   &#8220;park the car&#8221; becomes &#8220;pa&rsquo;k the ca&rsquo;&#8221;; police depahment; and heart is ho&rsquo;t;  while in (some parts of) the South, butter is buttah, and father is fathah.]</p>
<p>The neighbors I grew up next to, of old Yankee stock, pronounced  &#8220;wash&#8221;  as &#8220;worsh&#8221;.   I always thought that odd, but it&rsquo;s common in parts of New England and NY State.  (I wonder how they&rsquo;d say &#8220;holes&#8221;. I dread to think!)  </p>

		<p>If there was ever any danger that mainstream, thinking Americans will ever take blacks seriously, continuation of this sort of absurd whining on their part surely prevents it.</p>
<p>While we&rsquo;re busy pretending to be offended by astronomical terms, I want to suggest that the term &#8220;white dwarf&#8221; is both racially- and height-insensitive, and that it needs to be changed.  Additionally, describing objects like white dwarves, neutron stars and black holes as &#8220;dense&#8221; smacks of intelligence-elitism, and may be offensive to retards (do we call those &#8220;Short Bus-Americans&#8221; now?  I can never keep up with Politically Correctspeak.)</p>

		<p>Maybe Nasa could just rename black holes something like &#8216;Black Stars.I think blacks coined the term black ho** first.THAT might just be a lawsuit itself.NAACP? And you all thought &#8216;ho&rsquo; meant whore? Haven&rsquo;t you noticed,ALL females are &#8216;hoes&rsquo; according to the black guy.</p>

		<p>I would tell the NAACP to go to hell, but if they don&rsquo;t understand the word &#8220;hole&#8221;, they might not understand &#8220;hell&#8221; either.</p>

		<p>Yes, Liberal White Elites are beginning to reap the harvest of what they have sown.  Yet it absolutely amazes me at how blacks continue time and again, to make jackanapes of themselves.  It appears they pronounce &#8220;r&#8221; in many words that do not include it.  For example, they pronounce &#8220;Buick&#8221; as &#8220;Burick&#8221;.  Ever listen to them pronouce words with a &#8220;u&#8221;?  Right on cue, they pronounce an &#8220;r&#8221; within the word.  I am but 4 whites working alongside 30 blacks, so I hear this everyday.  Yet the phrase I get SOOOOOOOOOOO weary and sick of hearing is, &#8220;you know what I&rsquo;m saying?&#8221;  Segregation is the only way for the different races to live in peace.</p>
