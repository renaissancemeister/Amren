<h1>Worst Human Rights Offenders Condemn West</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Licia Corbella, Calgary Herald, June 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In what can only be described as Orwellian double-speak, the Organization of the Islamic Conference told the United Nations Human Rights Council  &mdash;  made up of many of the world&rsquo;s worst human rights violators  &mdash;  that Muslims in western democracies face unbearable racism and discrimination, and demanded that the UN do something about it.</p>
<p>&#8220;People of Arab origin face new forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related forms of intolerance and experience discrimination and marginalization,&#8221; an Egyptian delegate said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Pakistan, speaking for the 57-nation OIC, tabled a resolution instructing the council&rsquo;s special investigator into religious freedom to look into such racism, &#8220;especially in western societies&#8221; to &#8220;work closely with mass media organizations to ensure that they create and promote an atmosphere of respect and tolerance for religious and cultural diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mahfooz Kanwar, a professor emeritus at Mount Royal University and author, said these resolutions  &mdash;  which are expected to pass owing to the over-abundance of &#8220;Islamist and other dictatorial states&#8221; that sit on the oxymoronically named UN Human Rights Council  &mdash;  would be funny for their sheer audacity and hypocrisy if they were not so potentially harmful and disturbing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was born and raised in Pakistan and any honest person from there will admit that nobody in that country has religious freedom  &mdash;  or any kind of freedom  &mdash;  not Muslims and certainly not members of minority religions who are afforded even less rights and are often beaten, raped and killed for not being Muslim,&#8221; said Kanwar, a sociologist and criminologist. &#8220;As for gender equality, there is none. Women are considered property in Pakistan and virtually every Islamic country,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I were to go to Pakistan and do what I do here in Canada, write articles and books that are critical of those governments, I would not survive more than 24 hours,&#8221; Kanwar said.</p>
<p>Just last month, on May 28, Muslim suicide bombers stormed two Ahmadi Muslim mosques in Lahore, Pakistan and murdered about 100 worshippers. &#8220;That&rsquo;s extreme discrimination. The Pakistani government declared long ago that Ahmadiyya Muslims are not real Muslims, they are infidels and therefore deserve to be killed,&#8221; said Kanwar. &#8220;And so, these ignorant fanatics listen to the semi-literate mullahs in the mosques and go out and murder the so-called infidels in suicide bombings with the hopes of going straight to heaven.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reality is,&#8221; he added, &#8220;the ONLY countries where Muslims can really practise their religion freely and without coercion or discrimination is in the West. In Muslim countries, they force you to worship the way the state wants you to worship or you face being attacked. That&rsquo;s why Muslims are always killing Muslims. The Sunni kill Shiites and vice versa. They think anyone who doesn&rsquo;t believe exactly like they do is an infidel and deserves to die.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kanwar acknowledges that there is some racism in the West, but it is &#8220;not systemic and is microscopic in comparison with any Muslim country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Organizations that track freedom and religious persecution in the world say that the worst offenders are the same states that have signed on to the resolution to condemn the West. Freedom House ranks the level of freedom in every country and when the lists are compared, the same countries that want the UN to condemn the West for discriminating against Muslims are among the least free countries in the world. These countries are also seeking at the United Nations to make it a crime for anyone to ever blaspheme Islam or Muhammad in the West, yet in their own countries, they have laws that state that non-Muslims have less rights than Muslims.</p>
<p>According to Kanwar and Voice of the Martyrs  &mdash;  a Christian non-governmental organization  &mdash;  in Pakistan, a Christian man&rsquo;s testimony in court is counted as being worth half that of a Muslim man&rsquo;s. A Christian woman&rsquo;s testimony in court is worth only one-quarter of a Muslim man&rsquo;s, making Christian women and girls prime targets for rape, since it&rsquo;s near impossible for the perpetrator to be convicted under such laws.</p>
<p>Voice of the Martyrs, which monitors attacks against Christians around the world, states that &#8220;many Pakistani Christians have been falsely accused under law 295c of blaspheming Muhammad or the Qur&rsquo;an, a crime punishable by death.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Egypt, where there is a large, though dwindling, Christian community, the country&rsquo;s constitution gives more rights to Muslims, and Christians are treated as second-class citizens, denied political representation, and often discriminated against in education and employment, states Voice of the Martyrs. &#8220;While the constitution allows for freedom of conversion, Muslims converting to Christianity have often been unable to change their religion or their name on their identification cards. Without the freedom to make this change, Christian women remain designated as Muslims and are unable to marry Christian men,&#8221; states the Voice of the Martyrs website.</p>

		<p>Islam is truly a horrific, backward cult that makes no apoligies for it&rsquo;s hypocritical treatment of other religions in Moslem dominated areas.  It is no suprise that the US media or pro-Moslem &#8220;discrimiation watchdog&#8221; groups have little to say about rampant muslim discrimination.  </p>

<p>EVEN the Muslim, unwittingly admits this is so. Everywhere else in the Islamic world, the government interferes big time with the religious practices of EVERYONE and for the detriment!</p>
<p>ONLY in the west and most of all in the U.S. are the Muslim allowed to practice their religion freely without the government meddling.</p>
<p>Rip the headscarf off a Muslim woman in the U.S., you get thirty days in jail, a single glance wrongly taken in an Islamic country and you might be torn to pieces.</p>
<p>THESE BAD GUYS KNOW IT TOO, THEY JUST DO NOT WANT TO SAY SO!!</p>

		<p>Why do Muslims emigrate to countries where they face &ldquo;unbearable racism and discrimination&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Why do they even emigrate to western countries at all? If they have it so bad in western nations, then they should not even be there in the first place! The western ways of life and Islam will never integrate together harmoniously, no matter how much the liberal elitists want to believe and try to enforce.</p>

		<p>People in Islamic countries where conformity is the rule shouldn&rsquo;t rock the boat. If they do, they know the consequences. </p>
<p>As much as a boat-rocking migrant from Pakistan or the Middle East will tell you he rejects his culture, he&rsquo;s still bound by blood loyalty to his kin.</p>
<p>The Mount Royal professor quoted in the article will someday want his Muslim children to occupy a place above white children.</p>

		<p>The more intelligent of peoples living in the West are already well aware of the ways of the Cult of Islam and its nafarious practices.</p>
<p>The real stumbling block and great danger to the West, is the West&rsquo;s continung membership of the current United Nations.  Being the brainchild of socialist indoctrinated Western do-gooders and non-Socialist political opportunists alike as with similar organisations before and since, the present version of it has morphed into a non-White Third World dominated global governmental social policy inventing dictatorship whose policies are being forcibly implemented across the Western world by puppet administrations at national level and in a one-size-fits-all format too.</p>
<p>The remedy is for White nations to withdraw from it and instal their own White United Nations alternative across the West while outlawing the present version which has now become totally unrepresentative of the rights and aspirations of White nations and their ancestral territorial integrity.</p>
<p>In other words, the present United Nations setup has long since been hijacked by a self-loathing White enabled Marxist/Trotskyite/Islamic cabal of non-White Third World dictatorships and this needs to be faced up to by the White Western world before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>To commence with, it&rsquo;s time to pull out of it once and for all.</p>

		<p>Kudos to #5 for recognizing the obvious; as with many organizations, the UN has outlived its historical era and is a relic. There is far too much churchiness in the modern world, far too much ossified sentimentality. I am a believer in secession into manageable units of government and that most certainly included a reorganization of the most pretentious of all, the UN. </p>

		<p>You should see how Muslims treat women.  We like to say these people have a right to immigrate to our countries, and meanwhile &#8220;Lifetime&#8221; is always showing movies about upper class white men beating the stuff out of their wives.</p>
<p>I watched one movie the other day that was laughable.  It was about a blonde, blue-eyed upper class white couple where the husband brutally beat his wife up all the time.  There was one scene where he throws her across the room and he punches her lights out repeatedly.  At the end of the scene she has a bloody face.  When she separated from him, he spends the rest of the movie stalking her and trying to kill her.  Why do all these stupid movies about white men beating up their wives always have the same plots?</p>
<p>I love how Hollywood makes it seem as if this is such common behavior among white males.  The type of abuse that is portrayed in these movies is very common among Muslims and among Third World people in general, but very very rare among whites.  When you hear of a white man &#8220;assaulting&#8221; his wife in the news, it usually means he lost his temper with her, scared her, maybe slapped her in the face and shook her etc&hellip;. I am not saying that is okay either, but there is a big difference between that and actually beating the stuff out of your wife, which is what Third World men do all the time.</p>
<p>But that is okay&hellip;..let&rsquo;s keep letting Muslims immigrate here, and turn a blind eye to how they treat their women.</p>

		<p>  I fully agree with &#8220;A Swain&#8221;. I also believe the muslims are here to take over Americ(k)a. Islam is a religion/cult of barbarians that are stuck in the middle ages. They will, given the chance, completely destroy this country</p>

		<p>How it goes:</p>
<p>If a white man attacks blacks, the white man is an evil racist and needs punishment.</p>
<p>If a black man attacks whites, the poor black fellow has been &#8216;radicalised&rsquo; by the dreadful white society in which he is &#8216;forced&rsquo; to live.  <br>

<p>It was probably one of those &#8216;based on a true story&rsquo; drama&rsquo;s. Because sometimes it&rsquo;s A-Ok if white actors portray people of color on screen&hellip;</p>

		<p>A couple of the commenters above have been too quick to slander Mr Kanwar as a Muslim &#8220;5th columnist&#8221; by assuming he is a Muslim as unfortunately 99% of Pakistani´s are.   Although the article doesn´t say, from his forthrightly anti-Islamic and pro-West sentiments I suspect he is a minority Pakistani Christian.  Give the man a break - if only they all thought like him. </p>
