<h1><a href="https://phoenixrally.com/">Join Thousands As We Rally in Support of SB1070</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Phoenix Rally, June 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Saturday, June 5, 2010 from 3-6PM PST<br>
(Other activities happening prior to 3PM  &mdash;  Check back here for updates and details!)<br>
Wesley Bolin Plaza<br>
1700 West Washington St<br>
(Across from the Capitol in Phoenix, AZ)</p>
<p>Those who oppose SB1070 in Arizona have had their say. With sporadic outbursts of violence, shouting and civil disobedience, they have made their intentions clear  &mdash;  that enforcement of the law is not a top priority for them.</p>
<p>It is now our turn!</p>
<p>Join thousands of other Americans as they make their way from the far reaches of America on a four day Freedom March Across America beginning June 1, 2010 culminating in a mass rally in Phoenix, Arizona on June 5, 2010.</p>
<p>The rally is called Phoenix Rising for a reason. On this day Americans will come together and watch as the Phoenix rises from the ashes of non-enforcement of our immigration laws that has gone on for decades. They will stand for the rule of law and in support of Arizona and its new law SB1070. They will call for a groundswell of other states to take on the duty our federal government has failed to uphold.</p>
<p>This promises to be the largest rally in American history demanding that the states and federal government secure our borders and crack down on illegal immigration. The federal government has been shirking its duty for far too long as Americans have carried the burden of their lack of action. All the while Americans have been demanding that our laws be enforced  &mdash;  and we have been ignored.</p>
<p>Americans are no longer remaining silent. It is time now for you to join your fellow citizens. It is time to stand up and demand an end to non-enforcement, high unemployment due to illegal labor and the immoral burden being placed on both their own and their children&rsquo;s backs by people who have chosen to break the law in entering our country.</p>
<p>Join us in the Freedom March starting June 1 and we&rsquo;ll see you across from the State Capitol building in Phoenix at Wesley Bolin Park on June 5, 2010!</p>
<p>(The rally is scheduled to be from 3-6PM, but there will be activities going on throughout the day at the event location).<br>

		<p> Here&rsquo;s hoping the rally gets a turnout like those of the various Tea Party rallies of the last year. Wonder if there will be any &#8220;counter-demonstrators&#8221; to try to disrupt things, as they do so often at conservative and White Nationalist events?</p>
<p> At least with some Hispanic faces and names among the listed featured speakers, etc., it will be harder for White liberals and Hispanic fanatics to claim that the group is supporting a &#8220;racist law&#8221; that will lead to &#8220;racial profiling.&#8221;</p>

		<p>No offense but the best way to &#8220;show your support of immigration law&#8221; is by carefully evaluating political choices and voting for the right people.</p>
<p>Also, donations to the right people can be very helpful.</p>
<p>Demonstrations?  Not so helpful.  Especially since our communist controlled media will make sure coverage is near zero.</p>
<p>Not giving any money to these guys (causing even more of them to simply go out of business)&hellip;.also helpful.  Notice all the newspapers laying off people left and right.  Starve the communist controlled media enough and they will die.</p>
<p>Talk with those you have contact with.  Encourage them to do these same things, discretely.  In other words, tell your co-workers but make sure your boss doesn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Something interesting to notice.  These communists have a huge honking weakness.  They can&rsquo;t keep their mouths shut.  A certain subset has been very successful in quietly infiltrating our government.  Then, given the slightest bit of credibility, they can&rsquo;t keep from shouting from the rooftops about who and what they are all about.  The backlash will likely destroy them this November.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be like them.  Do, quietly &#8220;infiltrate&#8221; our government.  When elected, bring sanity back to our government.</p>
<p>Good example of this is Rand Paul.  He knows how to play the game.  Despite everyone knowing that his father is a white nationalist who went underground several decades ago, he appears like a mainstream conservative GOP candidate.</p>
<p>Hehe&hellip;.he&rsquo;s not.  We need several dozen just like him on all levels of government.  Once in place, they will simply de-fund those destroying our country.  The trillion dollars a year flowing out of this country for military adventurism and whole countries as welfare entitlement recipients will end.  Welfare to non-whites will slowly be tapered off, causing them to leave.</p>
<p>Imagine this scenario.  Welfare for non-whites disappears but it&rsquo;s made known that much the same thing is available south of the border as money we already send that country is &#8220;re-directed&#8221; politically.  The border is militarized and becomes a one way door out for non-whites.  No one, of course, mentions race.  Ten years of this, when almost all non-whites have left and can&rsquo;t get back in, that welfare is slowly tapered off.</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>

		<p>I susbscribe to the policy of not knocking people on our side, so I won&rsquo;t name the individual involved in the smear against this rally, but he&rsquo;s a big name in the anti-illegal alien movement.  I don&rsquo;t know what his motive is, but he put up an article on his website knocking Tom Tancredo, et al. Curiously, this guy&rsquo;s complaint seems to be like typical SPLC nonsense in that he whines that a guy involved in the rally likes the music of a right wing band. Huh?</p>

		<p>Thanks to the tea parties rallies like this have brought whites out t the streets.</p>
<p>News coverage will create more white activists, which is whythe mainfringe media tries its best to avoiid coverage on something like a million people from the tea party movement in Washington.</p>
<p>But if white people stay active we will not only bring some of these crazies under control, but we will be forming a UNITED base in the event civil war breaks out.  The more activists we have in the streets protesting ANYTHING!  ANYTHING! The more people we will have that will pick up on the anti-white racist ferver from all these non-whites that has went on for far too long now.</p>
<p>Whites NEED to hit the streets as often as they can about anything and everything.  Focusing a unified white movement into one that defends itself against the racists hordes will be forced upon them by violent, anti-white racist action and rhetoric from non-whites, especially blacks and mestizos.</p>

		<p>While I don&rsquo;t mind the few non-whites who support our cause, this is dangerous to have to rely on blacks or hispanics to validate our cause.  Then it becomes more a case of proving we&rsquo;re not racist (which won&rsquo;t satisfy liberal and non-white bigots unless we kill ourselves), then we&rsquo;ve lost sight of what we originally started the movements for.  We want to preserve our white race and protect the lands we paid for in blood.</p>

		<p>I doubt this rally will have more than several hundred people. It&rsquo;s just not realistic to expect people to stand in the blazing sun for hours to listen to speeches. </p>
<p>More than likely the media will have a field day talking about the low turnout. Overall this rally has a high chance of being counterproductive. </p>

		<p>Do you think the lamestream media will cover this event? Other than Fox News and Rush, you&rsquo;ll never hear about the vast opposition rallies to illegal immigration in this country, unless of course they&rsquo;re infiltrated by instigators and anarchists who try to discredit the movement with violence and mayhem&hellip;</p>

<p>I wanted to commend you for your very fine post  &mdash;  the best one I&rsquo;ve read this week.</p>
<p>You have written (very well) important, vital information for ALL Whites, not just us White Nationalists:</p>
<p>All Whites should heed the following:</p>
<p>Stop voting for politicians who do not support (or worse) work for White dispossession (pro-Open Borders) or against White interests (pro-AA policies).  Donate to those who believe illegal colonists should be removed from the US.  I do. </p>
<p>I believe the two entities that have done the most damage to Whites and White psyches are the media and K-12 educational system.  With that in mind:</p>
<p>Stop buying and funding newspapers that degrade and/or demoralize Whites, papers that blow up stories of possible White Racism while black-on-White crime is considered &#8216;not worth reporting&rsquo; and (in California) illegal immigrants are championed with the crimes they commit, especially murderous drunk driving, deemed &#8216;non newsworthy,&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stop patronizing non-White businesses! If you are treated rudely by non-White clerks, as we Whites often are in California, report it immediately via e mail to company headquarters, leaving out any mention of race.  Tell them you&rsquo;re taking your business to their rival from now on, or to an on-line competitor.   I take names and report incidents as I see them, every single one.  If we Whites ALL did this, EVERY TIME, hit &#8216;em in the pocketbook, companies will take notice or go out of business, especially as the business climate in California especially is downright hostile. </p>
<p>Hire only Whites to work on your property  &mdash;  I put the word out to my neighbors and I have a White electrician, White plumber, White vet, White dog groomer, etc.</p>
<p>Turn off TV shows, stupid &#8216;dramas ripped from the headlines&rsquo; with the races reversed  &mdash;  blacks as victims, Whites as criminals, news shows that blare anti-White propaganda such as the &#8216;biggest threat to US safety is from White Supremacist Hate Groups&rsquo;, any advertising that portrays Whites as fools in need of salvation from blacks.</p>
<p>Get your precious White kids out of government schools if possible!  They are being<br>
indoctrinated to promote for White displacement and view themselves as oppressors and racists.</p>
<p>And most important, I believe, is to tell Everyone You Care About.  Spread The Message as far and wide as possible, as it will become increasingly difficult if the current regime gets a second term and Hate Speech legislation, enforced with an iron fist against Whites becomes the Law of the Land, upheld by the new majority SCOTUS appointees.</p>
<p>The alternative is unthinkable as I believe we Whites are being set up for genocide.</p>
<p>Bon</p>

You do not seem to understand that for the mexicans, this is about race.  They hold demonstrations with hundreds of thousands of their people and loudly scream about exterminating you and your family because you are white&hellip;..as part of invasion and takeover of the US.</p>

		<p>To # 7, &#8220;conservative republican&#8221;: You have mislabeled yourself; you are a NEOcon and are what is wrong with today&rsquo;s so-called conservatives.  The issue is race, not economics or even law and order.  Under a WN system, the latter two issues would take care of themselves.  If we are to dwindle into a melting pot, what care does any self-respecting white person have about the type of economic system the melted victims have?</p>

<p>If you are so gullible and naive as you sound, thinking that non-white hordes want to do anything but take over this country and change things to their liking, better step aside, because it is fools like you who got us in this fix to begin with.</p>
<p>You make me disgusted, knowing that there are such cowardly people out there that are supposed to be conservative.  Step aside or you will be trampled in the coming chaos.  Your view is in the process of being replaced by people much smarter than you will ever be.<br>

<p>If you really feel that way, then support amnesty and open borders.  That way, it will solve the illegal immigration problem with one stroke of an ink pen.  On top of that, it will give you even more of those &#8220;colors and races&#8221; for your precious chamber pot.</p>

		<p>I personally am not against legal immigration  &mdash;  but we should definitely have a say as to who can live here, and to whom we can say &#8220;hasta la vista.&#8221;  Our sandbox, our rules.</p>
<p>This was intended to be a white nation.  Is there really anything wrong with whites wanting our own country?  I hear there are black nations that don&rsquo;t want whites, and that&rsquo;s fine  &mdash;  their sandbox, their rules.</p>
<p>I have said this before here, but my paternal great-grandparents from Belarus and Poland not only learned English, but they also Anglicized their names.  They assimilated.  I know this from having looked at census records from 1910, 1920, and 1930.</p>
<p>If Mexicans are so hung up on their race and Madre Mexico, then maybe they ought to stay there, huh&hellip;?</p>

So you reject race as a basis for immigration control?<br>
By that of course you only mean white racial consciousness..<br>
because your opposition, La Raza etc has no intention<br>
whatsoever to give up Hispanic racial consciousness. They<br>
know what the stakes are. They know that this is about<br>
political power and control with you as the new minority.<br>
They define you as the enemy even if you are too goofy to see it.<br>
No one in all of  human history has ever lost control<br>

Poles, Germans, Swedes, Irish, Lithuanians, that was a melting pot. All white people. This country was founded for white people. Not for people from India,China and Mexico.</p>

<p>I have to ask what makes you think your opinion is in the majority?  Your a fool if you don&rsquo;t think this about race.  It&rsquo;s always been about race whether the issue is school choice, lower taxes, less government or immigration. Immigration represents the political marginalization and economic enslavement of White America.  Argue that it&rsquo;s not. Time to put the cards on the table.   Do you think this Mexican invasion of the Southwest doesn&rsquo;t have racial connotations?  This is why I&rsquo;m not a conservative anymore or at least not your neocon brand of conservatism.  The sickening &#8220;Immigration is just fine as long as it&rsquo;s legal, the &#8220;we&rsquo;re all the same&#8221; counterfeit liberalism and the endless parading of black &#8220;conservative&#8221; minstrel shows while they betray you behind your backs.  Your brand is experiencing so many defections coupled with the rise of the old right means people like you will be cast to the far fringes of the political spectrum just like we&rsquo;ve been for the past 40 years.  Racial politics is the future of this country whether you like it or not. <br>

<p>So if this melting pot of different colors and races is so wonderful why do you support the AZ law?  Is it a question of legality?  If so, it should be no problem to craft some kind of amnesty so that these people can drive back down to Mexico, pick up their green card at the US embassy and head right back to AZ.  Problem solved.  Right?</p>

		<p>#12, Ranger, hats off to you for putting that Neo-Con in his place.  He is another typical black/brown butt-smoocher who really believes the WBTS was over slavery.  I cannot wait until the liberal whites who got us into this debacle, reap fully what they have sown.  Bet you that this Neo-Con who states that we are a &#8220;melting pot of all races and colors&#8221; still locks his car door at intersections when a black crosses in front of him.  Or walks in another direction when he sees a group of young blacks coming his way.  Actual statistics:  Blacks make up about 12% of the total American population.  That 12% makes up 88% of the prison population.  Yet it is all the white man&rsquo;s fault.  Gag, Neo-Cons and white liberals make me nauseated!</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re not distorting anything. Mexicans and their supporters in the USA have openly said they want to replace us. It is not &#8220;xenophobic&#8221; to not want to have another race/nationality pour into your country and change your culture and colonize you.</p>
<p>&#8220;We live in a melting pot of all colors and races that love our country.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>We love our country too and we want to keep it our country,NOT have it become part of Mexico/Latin America.</p>
