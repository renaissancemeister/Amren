<h1><a href="https://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/7043040.html">ICE to Make Detention Centers More Humane</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Susan Carroll, Houston Chronicle, June 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>ICE and the private prison company Corrections Corporation of America have agreed to make more than 24 changes at nine facilities. The changes include:</p>
<p>* Relaxing security: Low-risk detainees will have &#8220;freedom of movement&#8221; in the facilities and will no longer be subject to lock downs or lights out.</p>
<p>*Access: Detainees will be able to have visitors stay as long as they like within a 12-hour window. The facilities will increase attorney visitation space, add un-monitored phone lines and give detainees email and free, Internet-based calling. A unit manager will be available to take complaints directly from detainees.</p>
<p>* Daily life: Detainees will be allowed to wear regular clothing, will have at least four hours of recreation daily, and will be offered cooking, art and dance classes.</p>
<p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials are preparing to roll out a series of changes at several privately owned immigration detention centers, including relaxing some security measures for low-risk detainees and offering art classes, bingo and continental breakfast on the weekends.</p>
<p>The changes, detailed in an internal ICE e-mail obtained by the Houston Chronicle, were welcomed by immigrant advocates who have been waiting for the Obama administration to deliver on a promise made in August to overhaul the nation&rsquo;s immigration detention system.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some of the changes will be implemented within 30 days; others may take up to six months, said Beth Gibson, ICE&rsquo;s senior counselor to Assistant Secretary John Morton and a leader of the detention reform effort.</p>
<p>Other major changes include:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>* Providing e-mail access and Internet-based free phone service.</p>
<p><b>Not about punishment</b></p>
<p>Gibson said the improvements are part of ICE&rsquo;s efforts to detain immigrants in the least restrictive manner possible while ensuring they leave the country if ordered to do so.</p>
<p>&#8220;When people come to our custody, we&rsquo;re detaining them to effect their removal,&#8221; Gibson said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s about deportation. It&rsquo;s not about punishing people for a crime they committed.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the CCA facilities that have agreed to ICE&rsquo;s changes, detainees will see more variety in their dining hall menus and have self-serve beverage and fresh vegetable bars.</p>
<p>CCA also plans to offer movie nights, bingo, arts and crafts, dance and cooking classes, tutoring and computer training, the e-mail states.</p>
<p>Detainees also will be allowed four hours or more of recreation &#8220;in a natural setting, allowing for robust aerobic exercise.&#8221;</p>
<p>CCA also committed to improving the look of the facilities, such as requiring plants, fresh paint and new bedding in lower-risk units.</p>
<p><b>Advocates pleased</b></p>
<p>Some of the improvements offered at the CCA facilities counted as hard-fought victories for immigrant advocates, including plans to improve visitor and attorney access.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Union members said they have concerns about the plans, primarily focusing on safety.</p>

		<p>There will be very few if any visitor or inmate pat-downs.  Prediction:  There will be an armed riot at one of these &#8220;humane detention centers&#8221; within a year.</p>

		<p>The illegals did not come to America to take meaningless courses. They came to take advantage of the much-desired free benefits package offered by the U.S. government using the money they forcibly take from working Americans under the threat of physical violence and imprisonment during each and every pay cycle. They call the money they steal from us &#8220;taxes&#8221;. Sane people call the process &#8220;robbery&#8221; and &#8220;enslavement&#8221;!</p>
<p>Once again, the facts!</p>

Essentially, detention centers are going to become vocational schools so that hispanics can graduate from being dishwashers to chefs thereby taking higher level jobs &#8216;Americans don&rsquo;t want to do&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Great, let them consider it another place to cool their heels.</p>
<p>Forget what the bleeding hearts at the ACLU think.  Prison shouldn&rsquo;t be a vacation.  You should want to behave yourself so you don&rsquo;t have to be there!</p>
<p>Likewise, illegals should be discouraged from coming here to begin with.</p>

		<p>I personally favor an expedited process where there is a set period of time when the would be asylum seeker would request asylum and whether the acceptance or denial of asylum is done so that those who are denied asylum can be processed out for deportation and new asylum seekers can take their place.</p>

		<p>Sounds like life in a detention center for an illegal will be better than life in a hovel back in Mexico. The homeless of Mexico can now come to Mexico North for three hots abd a cot, cooking classes, arts and crafts, etc, Sounds like a sweet deal. In fact it is a better deal than our own home grown criminals get.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Relaxing security: Low-risk detainees will have &ldquo;freedom of movement&rdquo; in the facilities and will no longer be subject to lock downs or lights out.&#8221; I&rsquo;d be afraid of being raped or murdered at night when no one is paying attention. Please lock my door patron!</p>

		<p>Next time  I get caught by the  police, I&rsquo;m going to tell them that I am here illegally. Going to an ICE detention  center sounds better than going to jail. </p>

		<p>The more we make life great for them, the more they will come.  I don&rsquo;t like treating anyone badly as a rule, least of all poor immigrants, but this is ridiculous.</p>
<p>The best, most cost effective and humane solution is to do away with detention for 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, etc&hellip;</p>
<p>When you scoop up an illegal, deport them IMMEDIATELY.</p>
<p>Why wait?  Why all the bells and whistles?</p>
<p>Even more, confiscate from them (if they have any money) the cost of the airfare to send them home.  If they don&rsquo;t have nay money, give them a bill and tell them if they ever come back they have to pay it or go to jail and do hard labor until it&rsquo;s paid, and then deport them again.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The danger to America is not Barack Obama but a citizenry capable of entrusting a man like him with the presidency. It will be easier to limit and undo the follies of an Obama presidency than to restore the necessary common sense and good judgment to a depraved electorate willing to have such a man for their president.<br>
The problem is much deeper and far more serious than Mr. Obama, who is a mere symptom of what ails us. Blaming the prince of the fools should not blind anyone to the vast confederacy of fools that made him their prince. The republic can survive a Barack Obama, who is, after all, merely a fool. It is less likely to survive a multitude of fools such as those who made him their president.&rdquo; </p>

		<p>Nothing new here!  Just the usual pampering and babying of criminals at the taxpayers expense.  We are now to the point where people that work hard for a living, abide by the law, and contribute to society are punished, and those that break the law, do nothing for a living, and contribute nothing to society are rewarded. This will all bring about self destruction and chaos to a once great nation known as the U.S.A. which is exactly what the America hating Marxist left wants to happen.</p>

		<p>To be honest, I do not care about the amenities the detainees are provided with&hellip;so long as it isn&rsquo;t at American taxpayers&rsquo; expense. THAT is where I take issue.  If these services were funded by their own countries, what could, or would, I say?</p>
<p>Then again, if their own countries were providing for them well, these people would not be here in the first place&hellip;.so I guess that puts me back to square one&hellip;</p>

		<p>CCA claims that the resort amenities will only be provided for &#8220;non-criminals&#8221;.  However, local jails drop their criminal charges for illegals so they can ship them from their overcrowded jails to ICE detention.  Result:  criminals get a vegetable bar, free Internet and conjugal visits.<br>
