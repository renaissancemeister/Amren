<h1>An Embarrassment and the Colleagues Who Enabled Him</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Editorial, Detroit Free Press, June 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The good news is that most Detroit Board of Education members have ignored school board president Otis Mathis&rsquo; ill-considered attempt to retract the resignation he submitted last week after Detroit Public Schools Superintendent Teresa Gueyser outed him for masturbating in school business meetings. Mathis has no future in public service. If he even dimly appreciated his predicament, he&rsquo;d be decamping to a remote foreign country instead of trying to get his office back.</p>
<p>The bad news is that the board majority that elected Mathis president earlier this year is still in place, and at least one of their number, the Reverend David Murray, has dismissed Mathis&rsquo; over-the-top transgressions as a function of either the ex-board president&rsquo;s youth (Mathis is 55) or his naivete. (&#8220;Maybe he didn&rsquo;t know,&#8221; Murray suggested Friday after Gueyser&rsquo;s accusations became public, &#8220;it was offensive to her.&#8221;)</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But every board member, including the nine who voted to elect him school board president last year, was aware that Mathis had difficulty reading and that he struggled to compose a coherent English sentence. The fact that none of Mathis&rsquo; peers regarded this as disqualifying him as the titular head of Michigan&rsquo;s largest school district speaks volumes about the board&rsquo;s collective judgment, or lack of it.</p>
<p>Mathis&rsquo; failure to offer his resignation when his deficit became a source of national embarrassment, and the board&rsquo;s reluctance to make a leadership change or to even publicly address the matter, can be viewed in hindsight as a omen of the more grotesque scandal to come.</p>

								<h2>Mathis Puts DPS Board at New Low</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Laura Berman, Detroit News, June 22, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a March 4 column, when I reported on Mathis&rsquo; inability to write a coherent sentence, I asked whether he had overcome disabilities or convinced people that an academically challenged school board president was a good choice to lead the nation&rsquo;s lowest-achieving big city district.</p>
<p>In retrospect, the rise of Otis Mathis to that leadership role says as much about the current Detroit Board of Education as it does about Mathis.</p>
<p>This is the body that unanimously elected Mathis over Tyrone Winfrey, a board member who is an academic officer at the University of Michigan.</p>
<p>Mathis has succeeded over the years by never admitting defeat when he failed. Unable to meet academic requirements, he found ways around them.</p>
<p>After graduating from Southeastern High School with a D-plus average, he got into Wayne State University in a program for the academically unqualified. When he failed to pass an English language writing exam required for graduation, he sued, claiming the exam discriminated against African-Americans. When the exam was dropped, a decade later, he duly received his bachelor of science degree.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last week, when board-appointed school Superintendent Teresa Gueyser astonished most of us by filing a complaint with the DPS Office of Public Safety, alleging that Mathis had fondled himself repeatedly in front of her during one-on-one meetings, Mathis apologized for inappropriate behavior, then resigned. Within hours, though, he tried to rescind his resignation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Even then, though, some DPS board members continued to defend him. Reverend David Murray, who is 58, described the 56-year-old Mathis as &#8220;a young man,&#8221; who is still learning basic rules of deportment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like I say, it&rsquo;s not that uncommon for people to behave in that fashion,&#8221; he said Monday, &#8220;especially if the person is coming on to them. In most workplaces, they tell you you shouldn&rsquo;t have any social carrying on in the workplace.&#8221;</p>
<p>Murray&rsquo;s willingness to dismiss Gueyser&rsquo;s sexual harassment complaint as a kind of courtship strategy is bizarre  &mdash;  but it also helps explain why Gueyser waited so long to complain about behavior she said had been a regular feature of their meetings.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Murray, who legally changed his first name from David to &#8220;Reverend,&#8221; is now campaigning for a seat on the Wayne County Commission  &mdash;  a $68,000 a year job. Who knows? Perhaps the school board of low expectations is a springboard to higher office.<br>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s see; Mathis can barely read and write, and is described in the article as masturbating in public.  Since he appears capable of dressing himself and of refraining from throwing poop at reporters, perhaps he should consider a run for President.</p>

		<p>If I didn&rsquo;t already have prior knowledge of how depraved Blacks were, I would think that these articles were parodies written for the Onion. Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m never surprised anymore these days at the depths that supposedly educated Blacks can sink too. It&rsquo;s even lost it&rsquo;s comic value for me. It&rsquo;s like witnessing a never ending train wreck; I&rsquo;ve grown numb to horror.</p>

		<p>Each race achieves a level of culture commensurate with their abilities.  Whites, Asians, and Africans each possess different skill sets and create different types of societies.  There is nothing wrong with Mathis serving on Detroit&rsquo;s School Board   &mdash;   he is as qualified as perhaps the average African is.  I say give African-Americans their freedom!  Stop trying to make Africans into Europeans.  Let them run their societies and school boards, and schools and cities (Detroit) as they see fit.  </p>
<p>The communities that Africans build, be it Zimbabwe, Haiti, or Detroit are not like Whites would build, but it is not our place to tell Africans how they should live their lives.  Set Africans free!  Leave them alone   &mdash;   all this trying to make them into White people just makes them frustrated and resentful. </p>

		<p>After all these years of supporting AmRen and reading/commenting on the hundreds of news articles and media pieces that underline the organization&rsquo;s basic tenets a story like this appears.</p>
<p>I am speechless. There is nothing left to say except, &#8220;I give up.&#8221;</p>
<p>We are truly living in a Twilight Zone. What civilized nation, what kind of enlightened populace, would allow one of its largest cities to have its educational system run by a documented idiot?</p>
<p>This speaks volumes for why whites should finally become pro-active and take a stand in opposition to those who mindlessly hand money and power to blacks out of guilt or fear or just plain ignorance. Unless something is done our civilization will collapse.</p>

<p>Well, I have to agree that ousting him wasn&rsquo;t fair, since Detroit, as a third world city, doesn&rsquo;t display anything more on a more primitive level than most other black run cities or countries do. </p>
<p>The best thing to do is overlook this and attributate it to white racism and oppression and go on with business as usual, which would be looting the treasury or applying pressure by the males on the females to be more cooperative or resign, as their leader Kirkpatrick did.</p>
<p>The black male is treated unjustly and outrageously by this racist country, as Reverend Wright has announced many times.  This is just another one of those instances.</p>

		<p>When it comes to grotesque sexual practices, most Bantus will quickly stand up, and defend one of their own. That&rsquo;s why they defended Mike Tyson on that rape charge, Michael Jackson sleeping with those young boys in bed, and now, some Bantu school board president choking his chicken during meetings, no less.</p>
<p>No wonder Detroit is in the mess it&rsquo;s in. I really shouldn&rsquo;t be outraged that a colleague actually DEFENDS this idiot - Bantus will circle the wagons for one of their own. Even for something like this. </p>

		<p>You know what gets me? The sheer <i>hubris</i> of this creep, unable to be satisfied with riding some kind of affirmative-action perfect storm all the way to being elected as the head of the public school system of a major American city, despite being a D+ student who can barely read or, indeed, even speak coherently (seriously, read his memos; this idiot can&rsquo;t even <i>dictate</i>). You&rsquo;d think somebody in that position might just possibly realize how lucky they were and endeavor to just coast along and collect their paycheck, not rock the boat, not call undue attention to themselves, not OPENLY FONDLE THEIR GENITALS IN MEETINGS, for the love of God. But no, this nitwit shows no sign of being aware he was ever on any kind of thin ice in a position he was obviously vastly, <i>hilariously</i>, unqualified for. I know, I know, it&rsquo;s Detroit, the Zimbabwe of the Midwest, but still, not a bloody clue. </p>

		<p>Among the stupid and uncivilized, such behavior is apparently common.  I&rsquo;ve heard that it&rsquo;s rampant among blacks in prison, and I&rsquo;ve never heard of a white criminal referring to the rape of a 90-year-old woman as an instance where &#8220;we had sex&#8221;.  <br>
Last night, I gave the new show &#8220;Bait Car&#8221; a watch.  A Mexican car thief, riding shotgun, appeared to be masturbating.  I was surprised the scene didn&rsquo;t get censored.</p>

As several have eluded to, after so much &#8216;news&rsquo; about the state of  [what used to account for] American society it&rsquo;s to the point of only having the energy left to shake one&rsquo;s head and sigh. A public official can masturbate at work, but God forbid you say the word N*****. It&rsquo;s all about &#8216;offending&rsquo; but only &#8216;offending&rsquo; the black race.</p>

		<p>The only time I ever saw a man masturbating in public was on the subway in NYC. It was a black man sitting across from me, but he wasn&rsquo;t using his hands. Rather he kept lifting his hips and pressing his legs together and moaning. Of course, this was NYC so everyone tried to ignore it, but we knew what he was doing. I never forgot it.    </p>

		<p>Why is it that non-whites are always said to be &#8220;young&#8221; when they do something wrong?  Or even if they don&rsquo;t do anything wrong?</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<p>*  She is no longer on the air, but a St. Louis black talk radio hostess named Lizz Brown, in her last few years on the air, developed the habit of calling young black adults (especially men) who were accused of crimes &#8220;babies.&#8221;  People as old as 37 (in that instance, a woman) was a &#8220;baby&#8221; under her terminology.  When another host on that station was on the abortion subject, I called him and said that the question wasn&rsquo;t when does one start being a baby after one is conceived, the question is when does one stop being a baby after one is born.  He got my gag right away.</p>
<p>*  Alex Rodriguez (A-Rod), when he admitted steroid use, chalked it up to &#8220;youthful impetulence.&#8221;  I did the math, and he was 28 at the time he did the steroids.  I take that back   &mdash;   He was a wee lad of 28.</p>
<p>*  The New York Post, in their morning issue after Jackie Robinson&rsquo;s first game as a major leaguer, and ergo the first black to play a regular season game in the MLB, referred to Robinson (28 at the time) as a &#8220;colored boy.&#8221;</p>

		<p>In answer #4 Anonymous:  I will be more than willing to leave the - as they like to be called - &#8216;Afro-Americans&rsquo; to run &#8216;their&rsquo; school systems as they wish and will not attempt to impose my &#8216;White&rsquo; standards on them as long as they keep their hands out of my pockets and do not expect me - in any way - to support them.  EVERY penny of my taxes - whether it be property, sales, lottery, liquor, food, or any other tax will go to support the &#8216;white&rsquo; students.  Let him fondle himself on the streetcorner in &#8216;his&rsquo; &#8216;hood while he figures out how to pay the bills.  We&rsquo;ll see how long &#8216;his&rsquo; schools last.<br>
