<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/europe/10276738.stm">Immigrant Youths Riot in Sweden, Burning Down School</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, June 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Rioters in the Swedish capital, Stockholm, have burned down a school building and thrown stones at police in a second night of disturbances.</p>
<p>The trouble began on Monday after a group of youths in a suburb with a mainly immigrant population were refused entry to a school dance.</p>
<p>Police say up to 100 youths went on the rampage, throwing stones and setting several cars alight.</p>
<p>Two people were detained but later released.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Little Mogadishu&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Police said the rioters threw stones at the fire engines, preventing them from reaching the school building before it burned to the ground. The youths also attacked a police station.</p>
<p>Rinkeby is home to a large number of first- and second-generation immigrants. Many of them are from Somalia, so the area is sometimes nicknamed Little Mogadishu.</p>
<p>Government ministers have visited Rinkeby to assess the situation.<br>

<p>Somalis burn down a school.<br>
They throw rocks at policemen.<br>
They throw rocks at the firemen trying to reach the burning building.<br>
They attack a police station.<br>
There are 100 of them - </p>
<p>- and 2 are detained?  Detained?  Not arrested? </p>
<p>The Swedes are another group of people that are going to go down even faster than the British.  They can&rsquo;t defend themselves against these few Somalis for fear of appearing racist.  What are they going to do 10 or 15 years down the road when it really gets bad?   &mdash;   I&rsquo;ll tell you what they&rsquo;re going to do.  They&rsquo;re going to perish unless they experience a major awakening. </p>

		<p>The Swedes have pretty much committed ethnic and national suicide by having a low native birthrate combined with embracing multiculturalism and high immigration.  It&rsquo;s just a matter of time.  It will be interesting to see how these exact same policies turn out for America.  </p>

<p>No doubt more vigorous anti-racism laws; and  more money, more social programs, more sensitivity training, more diversity, more immigrant centers, more Moslem sharia, will be the solutions.  <br>

		<p>Horrible story. Is it any wonder why Somalia is in a virtually perpetual state of warfare? &#8220;Little Somalia,&#8221; indeed. And imagine if there had been children still in that school. Did the rioters check to see if everyone was out? </p>
<p>Imagine the media uproar if whites had set fire to a black school. And to think that the Swedes were the ones who helped teach America &#8220;white guilt.&#8221; The only upside to this story is they&rsquo;re getting a taste of their own medicine.</p>

		<p>Is anyone else in the west feeling particularly Roman right now? History seems doomed to repeat itself: as the italic people were snuffed out by their insane lust for empire and the impossible equality of their new citizens - so too will we.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tragedy second to none, that we Germans should suffer the same fate as our old enemy instead of learning from his downfall.</p>

<p>No one except the traitor politicians did. It&rsquo;s close to a century of socialist rule that brought this on us. We&rsquo;re not allowed to vote on immigration issues. We can&rsquo;t talk about immigration in a negative way since it&rsquo;s a hate crime to tell the truth.</p>
<p>There are changes coming but it will take time and we will need help. </p>

		<p>I suspect that the school these blacks wanted into was to assault the White girls, probably at a dominantly White school! I notice too that the article just uses the now famous euphemism of &#8220;youths&#8221; and not the hated words BLACK MUSLIM! Like the U.S.it is unfair to claim the Swedes as a nation wanted these black youffs in their country any more than we White Americans want millions more black muslims in our own country but the politicians, in both countries, seem to want them and damned if they care about the White peoples of their respective countries.</p>

		<p>Come on, Swedes.  You along with every other European nation chided American whites for our &#8216;racist&rsquo; and &#8216;bigoted&rsquo; treatment of blacks when you were totally ignorant of black behavior.  Now you can deal with these blacks who will destroy your country, rape your women, guilt trip yourwomen into having sex with them, assault your old, gang up on your young men, and take advantage of the infrastructure that generations of Swedes worked hard to create.    </p>

<p>Indeed. And most Swedes would nod thier heads sagely, even as they thought &#8220;Hmm &hellip; I don&rsquo;t think I am racist. But if this great academic says it is true it must be a fact. Maybe if I ask nicely, some of these blacks can help me and my family/friends discover our inner racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Swedes are a very trusting, naive people. Almost comically so. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid most Swedes are not cut out for a multiracial society. If thier daughters come home from school and say they were gang raped by blacks the parents and school officials will start asking them what they did to provoke this behavior.</p>

I believe the problem is the Swedes aren&rsquo;t trying hard enough to prove that they love non-white immigrants.</p>
<p>They need more sensitivity and tolerance classes. More government handouts and preferential set asides. Requiring businesses to hire more non-white immigrants would help too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the Swedes will come to see that THEY are the problem and I have no doubt they will work even harder to make diversity work for everyone.<br>

The Swedes came late to the game of multi-racialism, and their demented leftist government did it with a shrug of moral pomposity and superioty - &#8220;look what great and enlightened people we are&#8221;, they said &#8220;look how we self-sacrifice to help our poor wretched &#8216;brothers&rsquo; with black skin&#8221;, &#8220;look how better we are than those nasty racist Americans or Germans of the 1930s&#8221;.<br>

		<p>The problem is that the politicians have forced these changes upon us. The &#8220;social democrats&#8221; have, together with the other 6 ruling parties, become complete twats with regards to what they once stood for.</p>
<p>Once upon a time there were 7 different parties that each wanted to govern Sweden in their own way. As time went on they became more and more alike. Sometime in the late 90&rsquo;s becoming pretty much the same party.</p>
<p>Now the old-school social democrats are tired of what Sweden has become and they are desperately searching for answers &hellip; mostly in the form of the Sweden Democrat party. A party which is basically what the social democrats were 50 years ago - and they&rsquo;re called &#8220;right extremists&#8221;.</p>
<p>Hate crime laws are abound, the communists in the media protecting both the lying politicians and their poor, poor immigrant criminal kiddies. The riots in Rikeby are blamed on &hellip; get this.</p>
<p>The politicians blame the riots on the school holidays and warm weather.</p>

		<p>Too bad for the liberals that Somalis are racist, sexist and homophobic.  During Minnesota&rsquo;s gay pride event, the Somalis followed the gays and shouted for violence.  Needless to say, the police didn&rsquo;t want to get involved with two minority groups and did NOTHING.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m offended that they didn&rsquo;t burn down a church.  That&rsquo;s where the worst of the worst racial transgressions are promoted.</p>
<p>Are you watching the story out of Asheville?</p>
<p>A Presbyterian dared mention the IQ difference, and his church decided to make him the subject of hatred. He&rsquo;s White, they&rsquo;re White.  Whites fighting Whites just to protect the blacks from reality.</p>
<p>We just can&rsquo;t afford to let this injustice go unconfronted.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, two Asheville-area PCA churches have drafted statements denouncing racism that the presbytery will likely adopt this summer. One of them responds specifically to the local controversy by, among other things, asserting that interracial marriage is not a sin.</p>
<p>For its part, Friendship is starting to see more faces at its worship services now that the Payne and Lyons families aren&rsquo;t attending. And that&rsquo;s especially gratifying for the PCA leaders who have been battling racism in their pews. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not enough to simply not commit sins of commission,&#8221; Hutchinson said. &#8220;We have to also do the right thing.&#8221; <br>

Yahweh ben Yahweh, who headed the Nation of Yahweh sect, wore a turban and flowing white robes and claimed to be the reincarnated Messiah. He began numerous business enterprises in poor neighborhoods that amassed a fortune of as much as $100 million. Although he was initially welcomed with open arms by gullible Miami civic leaders, he and more than a dozen followers ultimately were indicted on federal racketeering and extortion charges related to the murder of 14 people, several of them whites whose ears were brought back to Yahweh ben Yahweh as trophies. He was convicted in 1992 of conspiracy to commit murder and sentenced to 18 years in prison. He was released on parole in 2001 and died in 2007.</p>

<p>&#8220;Swedes will never fight&#8221;..</p>
<p>Nor will they allow others to do so on their home turf. To wit:</p>
<p>When Stockholm hosted the 1912 Summer Olympics, they banned the boxing competition, as they felt it was not in keeping with their image as a peace-loving people. The IOC went along with it.</p>

Something essential is missing from this  bare-bones story, as might be expected for any censored news emanating from Sweden or the politically correct BBC.</p>
<p>  *  WHY were these &#8220;youths&#8221; refused entry to a school dance? There had to be a good reason (eg. drugs, fights, rapes or something???)  Why isn&rsquo;t that being told?</p>
<p>  *  Wouldn&rsquo;t refusing Somalis entry be considered &#8220;racist&#8221;?  That&rsquo;s not likely to happen in Sweden! So then, what was the real basis for the refusal?</p>
<p>  *  Are Somali youths so  enamored of dancing that they will riot if they can&rsquo;t dance?  I didn&rsquo;t know that Somalis loved music and dancing so much!  In fact, I thought these things were outlawed as sinful.</p>
<p>  *  And a SECOND night of rioting?  All because of a dance?  Come now, something more is going on here that we&rsquo;re not being told.</p>

The country&rsquo;s fertility rate rose to 1.91 children born per woman in 2008, the highest rate since 1993, according to figures from Statistics Sweden (SCB) released on Friday.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were 109,301 children born in Sweden in 2008, which is 1,880 more than in 2007,&#8221; out of a population of around 9.2 million, SCB said in a statement.</p>
<p>While Sweden has one of the highest fertility rates in the European Union thanks to its generous parental leave for both mothers and fathers, the rate is not high enough to renew the population.</p>
<p>A rate of 2.1 children would be needed for that, SCB said.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Actually, Sweden has had a big of a baby boom in the past decade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swedish women are giving birth to more babies than at any point since the earlier nineties, new figures show.&#8221;<br>
[Whiteplight] </p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>That proves nothing. Those are just babies that are  born in Sweden, on Swedish soil. Are they born to mothers AND FATHERS who are BOTH Swedes?  And are those parents ethnic Swedes by descent, not merely by holding Swedish citizenship?  (Swedish nturalization can be had after 5 years residence; refugees need only 4. Most immigrants are &#8220;refugees&#8221;.)* </p>
<p>The immigrants/refugees*   &mdash;   Somalis, Bosnians, Iraqis, Kurds   &mdash;    are extremely fertile; the ethnic Swedes are not.  Sweden, like France, does not keep ethnic/racial records. This illusory &#8220;baby boom&#8221; is the same thing as is going on in France and Germany. &hellip; Entirely deceptive. </p>
<p> *[Sweden has discontinued the term &#8220;immigrant&#8221;, preferring the euphemism &#8220;persons of migrant origin&#8221;. And modern Sweden, like France, does not recognize the existence of ethnicity as relevant to citizenship. It is a term of interest only to anthropologists, not government.]</p>

		<p>27-WhitePlight, 6:42pm:  Based on the comments made, I believe you are more in agreement than disagreement with my original statements.  A &#8220;baby boom&#8221; of 1.9 children per women only means the death of the nation comes slower than if the birth rate is 1.6 or 1.3 per woman.  Adding in that 75% of Sweden&rsquo;s population growth since 1960 is from foreign input, and given the current demographics of the country as a whole, I stand by my statement that it is just a matter of time until Sweden becomes a non-Swedish nation.  For some background information, the &#8220;Migration Policy Institute&#8221; recently issued this statement regarding Sweden: </p>
<p>&#8220;Sweden, like all countries in Western Europe, is facing an aging population and low birth rates. It is reasonable to believe that Sweden will have to rethink its immigration policy in the not-too-distant future and to accept low-skilled labor immigration from non-European countries. </p>
<p>Sweden will also have to rethink its self-image as a European nation-state, which is not compatible with the multicultural image Sweden is trying to establish. The notion of &#8220;Swedishness&#8221; will also need reconsideration in order to become more inclusive.</p>
<p>To me, that sounds anti-White, anti-European, and particularly anti-Swedish, in that multi-culturalism is mainly a passing phase during which a nation is moving from a previously dominant culture to a new dominant (and different) culture.  Heaven forbid anyone should suggest a halt to all immigration and policies to increase the native White birthrate.  Otherwise, the following links are offered as additional information.  Thank you.</p>

		<p>I must say I reject the views of some commentators here from Sweden that they were just victims of their government. Who votes for the governments? Why couldn&rsquo;t the Swedish people form or support a new and different party that would stop this needless and self-destructive immigration? For my money Swedes get my vote for the most clueless, unwordly and naive White people on earth, INDEPENDENT OF THEIR TREASONOUS GOVERNMENT. This is what a century of nanny-state, cradle-to-grave socialism does to the national ethic and ethnic. </p>

		<p>Multiculturalism is an American poison which we allow to be exported by our treasonous media.   These Euros really believe the fairy tales,  the one-sided, simplistic, hate propaganda that our media spits out about the Great Ongoing Civil Rights Struggle.  They think &#8220;A Time To Kill&#8221; is a documentary.  Detroit is the reality of our elites beliefs and actions, which they are starting to find out.  Unfortunately they&rsquo;ll probably no more halt the destruction than we did.   A complete Lebanese-style implosion of the U.S. is the only thing that might make them reconsider.  </p>

<p>This is in good part very true.  Not entirely, but largely. <br>
America, right now, is the main exporter of the cultural rot, and the center of the disease that&rsquo;s infecting the white world.  Yes, we earlier got a huge dose of trouble from Gunnar Myrdahl, who provided, in the 40&rsquo;s, the philosophical backing for all the integrationist movements that were to follow: the riots, the school desegregation, the white flight, the crime, the crumbling inner-cities, the anti-white discrimination that we see today.  </p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s remember too that Prime Minister Olaf Palme,the extreme leftist who proclaimed Sweden to be a multi-racial country and opened the gates to the Third World, had been educated largely in the United States. He came from an upper-class, conservative Swedish family, but his education in hippy-radical America transformed him into a raging radical.  Now, look at Sweden today: riots, rapes, burning schools, racial tension, black power movements   &mdash;  - just the same as what happened in the USA.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re only getting started.</p>

As an American, I must disagree with the above sentiment; I find it very cold and lacking in understanding.  The writer obviously cannot imagine living in a country where information is withheld from the public or else distorted, and where you cannot speak your opinion or make any protest without facing the danger of arrest. Immigration is not something on which they&rsquo;re allowed to vote. (Have Americans been allowed to vote on amnesty/immigration?)   And anything even hinting at racism is strictly illegal. For most Swedes, all they know is what their government and media tell them.  And, after a lifetime of constant brainwashing and propaganda, they&rsquo;re not even interested to know anything else.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something essential is missing from this bare-bones story, as might be expected for any censored news emanating from Sweden or the politically correct BBC.</p>
<p>&#8221; WHY were these &ldquo;youths&rdquo; refused entry to a school dance? There had to be a good reason (eg. drugs, fights, rapes or something???) Why isn&rsquo;t that being told?&#8221;</p>
<p>In America most high schools have a policy that only students of the school holding the dance can attend the dances.  Sweden may have the same policy.  The purpose of students only at the school dances is to prevent fights, invaders from rival schools,<br>
dropouts and troublemakers from causing problems.</p>
<p>The Swedish authorities will probably &#8220;heal&#8221; and &#8220;reconcile&#8221; the problem by passing a law that any middleaged thug and rapist be admitted to school dances.</p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>That is a fascinating question. And it remains a fascinating mystery.</p>
<p>Palme (and his wife), emerging from a theater, were shot by a lone gunman. She was not seriously injured.</p>
<p>A known &#8220;right wing extremist&#8221; was promptly arrested on suspicion, but was soon released for lack of any evidence. He later moved to the United States where he was murdered.</p>
<p>A brain-damaged derelict and drug addict was arrested three years afterward, and even confessed to the crime. He was  tried and was convicted; but the conviction was overturned by the High Court.</p>
<p>He remained under suspicion, but later sustained an injury to the head (in 2004) and died. </p>
<p>One week before Palme was murdered, he addressed the Swedish  <i>&#8220;Parliament Against Apartheid&#8221;  </i> held in Stockholm, attended  by a large crowd and officials from the ANC.  Sweden had made large contributions to the ANC. In his address,  Palme stated  that,  <i>&#8220;Apartheid cannot be reformed;  it has to be eliminated.&#8221;</i> </p>
<p>A former South African police official later named  a Swedish mercenary living in Cyprus,  as well as a South African &#8220;superspy&#8221;, and also a Rhodesian.  But, despite investigation, no evidence has ever  been  possible to obtain.</p>
<p>The morning of his assassination, Palme had met with the Iraqi ambassador, a close Saddam  Hussein associate, discussing Sweden&rsquo;s very large arms sales during the Iran-Iraq war   &mdash;   over which there was serious disagreement.</p>
<p>There were allegations also of Kurdish involvement. These are still under investigation but unproven. (There are many Iraqis living in Sweden.)</p>
<p>There are MANY OTHER theories afloat. Several books have been written about it,  but the murder remains officially unsolved.</p>
