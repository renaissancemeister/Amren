			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gautham Nagesh, The Hill, June 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is being urged to monitor &#8220;hate speech&#8221; on talk radio and cable broadcast networks.</p>
<p>A coalition of more than 30 organizations argue in a letter to the FCC that the Internet has made it harder for the public to separate the facts from bigotry masquerading as news.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;As traditional media have become less diverse and less competitive, they have also grown less responsible and less responsive to the communities that they are supposed to serve,&#8221; the organizations wrote to the FCC. &#8220;In this same atmosphere hate speech thrives, as hate has developed as a profit-model for syndicated radio and cable television program masquerading as &#8216;news.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>The organizations, which include Free Press, the Center for Media Justice, the Benton Foundation and Media Alliance, also argue that the anonymity of the Web gives ammunition to those that would spread hate.</p>
<p>The groups did not mention any specific programming on the right or the left in their letter, which supports a petition filed by the National Hispanic Media Coalition last year requesting a probe of the relationship between hate speech and hate crimes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The Internet gives the illusion that news sources have increased, but in fact there are fewer journalists employed now than ever before. Moreover, on the Internet, speakers can hide in the cloak of anonymity, emboldened to say things that they may not say in the public eye.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For these reasons, as the Commission deliberates how the public interest will be served in the digital age, it should consider the extent of hate speech in media, and its effects.&#8221;<br>

		<p>This is just one of many examples of in-your-face-Hispanic racial politics which is encouraged by Liberal immigration enthusiasts in the MSM. At this late stage in the game it is absolutetly crucial for White Nationalist to give multiple examples of the the double standard.</p>
<p>It is all about La Raza for Hispanics, and the enthusiastic expression of the spirit of La Raza is encouraged by the likes of Chris Mathews,Rachel Maddow and Kieth Oberman. Always comment on the double standard when confronted with the racism charge.</p>
<p>This news story is a warning to the Native Born White majority, and the warning is this:&#8221;when you are no longer a racial majority within the borders of America, La Raza will brutally oppress you&#8221;.</p>
<p>In effect, what Hispanics want to do is to criminalize Native Born White American opposition to race-replacement at the hands of post-1965 Hispanics. </p>
<p>A well known high ranking member of The Race named Mario Obledo once said publicly:&#8221;This is the last gasp of White America&#8221;.</p>
<p>What would happen if a White American said:&#8221;This is the last gsp of Hispanic America&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Technology, as First Amendment law recognizes, increases the amount of choice available to the public, who are the consumers of information and who benefit from the widest possible availability of opinion and information.</p>
<p>The left only want State approved politically approved information sources, filtered to contain only politically approved opinion, and no opposing ideas.  In that situation there can be no robust debate or competition within the free market place of ideas.</p>
<p>That is not a free society, nor a strong one.  Only a society that can honestly address its problems with free and open debate can succeed.</p>

		<p> I find it interesting that The Hill identifies these groups by name only   &mdash;   no hint that they are all multi-culti, leftist liberal, which they are.</p>
<p> It&rsquo;s also interesting that with the sole exception of the first reference, &#8220;hate speech&#8221; in quotes, as it should always be, the word &#8220;hate&#8221; is always bandied about as if everyone knows just what it is and just who is &#8220;spewing&#8221; it. As a matter of fact, &#8220;hate&#8221; as defined by the Left is, anything that opponents of the Left say about race or ethnicity, that the Left doesn&rsquo;t agree with.</p>
<p> If I were the news director of a network or on-line news outlet, or the editor of a newspaper, I would insist that the words &#8220;hate&#8221;, &#8220;bigotry&#8221; or &#8220;hate speech,&#8221; among others favored by the Left, always be encased in quote marks, just to show that not everyone agrees with their definition. Many news organs don&rsquo;t do that   &mdash;   but they should.</p>

		<p>I stated earlier that First Amendment case law recognizes that technology, like the Internet and Cable TV increases range of opinion and viewpoints, and should not be censored by government, but welcomed.</p>
<p>Here is a quote from landmark Supreme Court case United States vs. Playboy Entertainment Group.</p>
<blockquote>
     &#8220;When a student first encounters our free speech jurisprudence, he or she might think it is influenced by the philosophy that one idea is as good as any other, and that in art and literature objective standards of style, taste, decorum, beauty, and esthetics are deemed by the Constitution to be inappropriate, indeed unattainable. Quite the opposite is true. The Constitution no more enforces a relativistic philosophy or moral nihilism than it does any other point of view. The Constitution exists precisely so that opinions and judgments, including esthetic and moral judgments about art and literature, can be formed, tested, and expressed. What the Constitution says is that these judgments are for the individual to make, not for the Government to decree, even with the mandate or approval of a majority. Technology expands the capacity to choose; and it denies the potential of this revolution if we assume the Government is best positioned to make these choices for us. &#8221;
</blockquote>

		<p>How does one put out an article like this, and make no attempt whatever to even define what this so-called &#8220;hate speech&#8221; even is? Moreover, what jurisdiction does the FCC have over cable-tv? I am paying for that service - the govt. should have no say whatsoever over what is politically said there, just as they have no say over nudity, profanity, etc.    </p>

		<p>Free Speech is Hate Speech because it was invented by Whites during the time slavery was legal, and it was used against the Freedom Riders who were fighting in the struggle for Civil Rights for the blacks.</p>
<p>Or so it goes.</p>
<p>But today, I found for the first time one of the blacks admit that &#8220;Black Privilege&#8221; exists.  I&rsquo;ve never ever seen or heard of this Black Privilege, unless I was the one saying it exists.</p>
<p>I encourage all Free Speech used by the blacks to admit that they enjoy Black Privilege. </p>
<p> <a href="http://www.1droprule.com/2010/06/black-privilege.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.1droprule.com/2010/06/black-privilege.html</a></p>
<p>Sadly, he forgot to call it &#8220;Unearned Black Privilege.&#8221;</p>
<p>Everything the blacks have, Whites gave to them.  Whites are decreased by a factor of two for every factor of one that they improve the blacks.</p>
<p>The blacks don&rsquo;t really get improved. They just are given more free stuff. They are too incompetent and violent to know the difference.  </p>

		<p>Liberals are NOT stupid. They know that Rush Limbo and Fox news are no threat. They also know that the internet is a threat, in fact, the greatest threat to Liberalism. Getting the Feds to gain more control over broadcast communication, will be the next step in gaining control over internet communication. </p>
<p> Remember when Liberals use the term &#8220;hate speech&#8221;, they mean any ideas that Liberals regard as a threat i.e. the truth.</p>

		<p>&#8220;the parents, crying, were clearly appalled to discover that their kids held such attitudes about race. Many seemed confused as to why their children exhibited blatant racial biases  &mdash;  considering that race never surfaced as an issue in their own homes.&#8221;<br>
__   __   __   __   __   __   </p>
<p>Why?  Because, dear parents, it&rsquo;s NATURAL, it&rsquo;s simply natural. They didn&rsquo;t have to get it from you. They got it from nature, from their own healthy, normal instincts that haven&rsquo;t been suppressed yet.  Your young children haven&rsquo;t been subjected to the years of propaganda that you have, and so they haven&rsquo;t buried it inside of themselves, they haven&rsquo;t learned to feel guilty. They&rsquo;re just being honest. </p>

		<p>We have a constitutional right to use hate speech, love speech, and indifferent speech.  </p>
<p>Any legislation against free speech that is not defined as liable and slander is rendered null and void by the First Amendment.  </p>
<p>Politicians who believe they have the right to dictate what the people can and can not say are in desperate need of professional psychiatric care&hellip;  </p>

		<p>The liberals have always been opposed to freedom of speech.  </p>
<p>They oppose it while proclaiming they are strong supporters of it, with typical liberal hypocrisy.</p>
<p>The reason they oppose it is that free speech leads to the free exchange of information and free thought.</p>
<p>Information and rational thinking are the enemies of the liberals because their philosophy is irrational.</p>
<p>The best thing we can do is spread as much information as possible and create an atmosphere where free speech is possible.</p>
<p>Knowledge, free speech and free thought are our friends and the enemies of our enemies.</p>

		<p>This is why a second term for the obama regime must be stopped.</p>
<p>More, pro-AA/disparate impact (sotomeyer), pro-Hate Speech (kagan) judges will be appointed to SCOTUS and other federal judgeships, upholding and enforcing brand new anti-White, entrenched, federal laws  &mdash;  lorded over by new federal &#8216;enforcement&rsquo; departments headed by la raza, adl and naacp appointees.</p>
<p>You can be sure punitive Hate Speech laws will be passed, meriting severe prison time and promising bankrupting fines for any White who mentions racial differences, complains about non-White immigration, or challenges any blatant, open discrimination directed at Whites.</p>
<p>The FCC will &#8216;crack down&rsquo; on any opponents of the hateful la raza.  Hate Speech will be whatever the communists in the government say it is  &mdash;  and it will be directed solely at Whites.</p>
<p>Of this you can be sure.</p>
