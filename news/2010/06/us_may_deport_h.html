<h1><a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/06/12/us_may_deport_harvard_student/">US May Deport Harvard Student</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Maria Sacchetti, Boston Globe, June 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Eric Balderas, a sophomore on a full scholarship to Harvard, was detained Monday while preparing to board a flight back to Boston to spend the summer conducting research at the university. He had been visiting his mother in San Antonio, where he grew up and was valedictorian of his high school class.</p>
<p>Balderas said he had lost his Mexican passport and tried to board the flight using a consular card from the Mexican government and his Harvard identification. Instead, he said, airport security called immigration officials, who handcuffed and fingerprinted him and detained him for five hours before letting him go. He boarded a flight back to Boston the next day, pending a July 6 court date with an immigration judge, probably in Boston.</p>

		<p> Deporting all Harvard students sounds like a pretty good idea to me. Short of that, consider a 30 year moratorium on allowing any to serve in the government in any capacity. We&rsquo;d be a better nation for it!</p>

		<p>I wonder what this Mexican&rsquo;s grades were to get into Harvard?  I know, I know, it&rsquo;s a racist question to ask isn&rsquo;t it?  It really doesn&rsquo;t matter what his grades were; just asking the question is proof of a White supremacist lurking somewhere.</p>

		<p>This article is misleading.</p>
<p>If all illegal aliens were competent enough to get accepted into Ivy League universities, which is still difficult even with affirmative action providing lesser qualfied minorities with advantages they don&rsquo;t deserve, do you really think they would have fled to the USA in the first place? No &mdash; because they would have been competent enough to maintain a first world society; consequently, there would be no reason to flee illegally to a foreign country.</p>
<p>The reality is that most illegal aliens are a drain on the American economy. Overwhelmed prisons full of illegal aliens, hospitals filing bankruptcy because illegal aliens won&rsquo;t pay, etc. &mdash; all these facts testify to the reality of the illegal alien issue.</p>

		<p>Imagine that you stole a race car. Not only the racist DMV refuses to register it in your name, so that you have to live in the shadows as an undocumented owner, but now, despite the fact that you won a race in your stolen vehicle, police came to your home in order to repossess it.</p>
<p>If you expect me to cry moved by your ordeal then you, Balderas, and Boston Globe belong to the same category.<br/>

		<p>Ok, so lets not pretend that he didn&rsquo;t get into Harvard because of his race, beating out a more qualified white American.</p>
<p>American schools, all of which are funded by our government and our tax dollars, should be for Americans first - and to the most qualified Americans we can find.</p>
<p>Nobody should shed a tear for this foreign leech.</p>

		<p>Nobody needs a passport to fly from San Antonio to Boston, neither Mexican or American. He need only show his Texas drivers license as a photo identification. He wanted to be cute and show his Mexican consular identification card instead. </p>
<p>Dumbass. Let the K-9 dog chew off his ears in the back seat of the police car then ask him if he has a Texas drivers license&hellip;.where he &#8220;grew up&#8221;.</p>

		<p>This kid is straight out of central casting for the drama currently going on around the DREAM act. After all, who better to illustrate the injustice of deporting an illegal than a fresh faced Harvard student?</p>
<p>The DREAM act is a horrible piece of legislation. In essence, it&rsquo;s a kind of expansion of the idea of &#8220;anchor babies&#8221; - rather than getting citizenship by being born in this country, under the DREAM act citizenship is granted to people brought here as children. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another piece in the grand plan for &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform,&#8221; a grand plan which as far as I can tell can be boiled down to one central principle: if you&rsquo;ve managed to squat in this country long enough without being caught, you deserve to be rewarded with US citizenship. </p>

		<p>  How manywhite christians were denied entry to Harvard so this illegal could get in? St Peter&rsquo;s College in JC recently witnessed the top man in it&rsquo;s graduating class get no ivy league offers. This despite a perfect SAT. He was Catholic and white. The runner up, with distinctly less scores was bombarded with acceptances from the ivy&rsquo;s. He was a cuban. &#8216;Nuff said.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m betting this guy has a driver&rsquo;s license.  If he does how did he get it?  If he says he doesn&rsquo;t, it seems mighty strange that a 19 year old isn&rsquo;t driving something even if he doesn&rsquo;t own a vehicle.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been licensed for years, but when my renewal came up this time I spent three months writing, phoning, threatening and insulting various people before data was sent to me that would prove I was the person in the photo on my driver&rsquo;s license.</p>
<p>My county of birth outright refused to send me a certifiable copy of my birth certificate unless I had a passport, a union I.D. with a photo on it, or some kind of government issued I.D. with a photo, (Sorry, driver&rsquo;s license won&rsquo;t do.), a valid SS Card that would be scrutinized for authenticity, or a DD214, honorable discharge from military service. They said they would accept a DD214, or a SS Card, plus one of the other requirements.</p>
<p>And if I had to travel over two thousand miles, up and back, well, &#8220;we can&rsquo;t help it, that&rsquo;s the law.&#8221; </p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m willing to bet there&rsquo;s at least 5 to 10 million aliens in this country with driver&rsquo;s licenses who are not who they say they are, and they obtained them with some kind of Mickey Mouse Mex I.D., which enabled them to get a green card or something similar.</p>
<p>If I thought I&rsquo;d have to go through all that again, I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;d just drive without a license.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really, really, sick of what this country has become.</p>

		<p>The red-eye flight on Continental from Los Angeles to New York every night was always packed with little Mayan-looking Indios clustered in the back of the plane, non-English speaking and sometimes very little Spanish.  Obvious illegals.  They seemed to be herded by a &#8220;coyote&#8221;.   I wonder how they got aboard?   (Haven&rsquo;t taken that flight recently.)</p>

		<p>A friend who speaks spanish showed me the help wanted section of LA Opinion the spanish language newspaper in los Angeles that is owned by the Los Angeles Times.  (Looking ahead to when there are no English speakers left in S. California.)</p>
<p>That local Los Angeles newspaper is packed with spanish language help wanted ads from all over the country.  Hotels and restaurants and especially meat packing plants located in the northern midwest and mountain states.  All the ads have 800 numbers.</p>
