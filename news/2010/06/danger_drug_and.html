<h1><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/06/16/closes-park-land-mexico-border-americans/">Uptick in Violence Forces Closing of Parkland Along Mexico Border to Americans</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News, June 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>About 3,500 acres of southern Arizona have been closed off to U.S. citizens due to increased violence at the U.S.-Mexico border, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</p>
<p>The closed off area includes part of the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge that stretches along the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
<p>Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu told Fox News that violence against law enforcement officers and U.S. citizens has increased in the past four months, forcing officers on an 80 mile stretch of Arizona land north of the Mexico border off-limits to Americans.</p>
<p>The refuge had been adversely affected by the increase in drug smugglers, illegal activity and surveillance, which made it dangerous for Americans to visit.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>U.S. Fish and Wildlife officials have warned visitors in Arizona to beware of heavily armed drug smugglers and human traffickers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Signs have been posted warning Americans not to cross into the closed off territory south of Interstate 8. Babeu said the signs are not enough  &mdash;  he said Arizona needs more resources to help scale back the violence caused by the drug cartels.</p>

		<p>Let me see if I&rsquo;ve got this right&hellip;our homeland security knows exactly where the drugs and armed gangsters are coming into this country, but rather than setting up sniper nests to terminate them with extreme prejudice, we now concede American teritory to foreign criminals&hellip;What kind of a message does this send to Mexico?&hellip;Is this what Obummer has in store for the USA, to not only leave our borders porous, but to actually surrender US soil without a fight? Is there anyone left in this country with a backbone? Do lines on a map mean anything anymore?<br>
Lock and load, people, it&rsquo;s time to take back our country&hellip;</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t this kind of like Germany&rsquo;s (former) no-man zone or Korea&rsquo;s DMZ.  Before a war is officially concluded but there is a temporary truce it is common for opposing sides to remove their civilians from harms way.  Would we really want unarmed Americans coming up face to face with Mexican insurgents?  To do otherwise could be very bloody.</p>

		<p>And in the mean time, CNN, MSNBC, and even Drudge Report jump by leaps and bounds to report only on stories of white people commiting crimes (or at least mostly).  How long do they spend searching for those stories?  If they would start posting stories about Third World people commiting crimes, they wouldn&rsquo;t have to look for so long.</p>

More American territory voluntarily surrendered.</p>
<p>Paraphrasing Jared Taylor&rsquo;s description of land ceded to non-whites, in which whites are no longer welcome.</p>

		<p>From the original article:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;&rsquo;It&rsquo;s literally out of control,&rsquo; said Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu . &#8216;We stood with Senator McCain and literally demanded support for 3,000 soldiers to be deployed to Arizona to get this under control and finally secure our border with Mexico.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Would that be Senator John McAmnesty demanding &#8216;3,000 soldiers be deployed to Arizona to finally secure our border with Mexico?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The flip-flopping senator that:   &#8220;campaigned against his state&rsquo;s successful Proposition 200, which denied welfare benefits to illegal immigrants and forced state agencies to report them to the federal government and worked with Ted Kennedy to try and expand the H1-B visa program?&#8221;</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/2bp5eo3</p>
<p>The same senator that rates an over-all career grade of D from NumbersUSA and the following description:  &#8216;Leans toward higher immigration, population growth, foreign labor?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Could political hack McAmnesty be fending off attacks from his opponent JD Hayworth and immensely popular Sheriff Joe Arpio (who is fundraising for Hayworth)?</p>
<p> Sheriff Babeu also said this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need support from the federal government. It&rsquo;s their job to secure the border and they haven&rsquo;t done it. In fact, President Obama suspended the construction of the fence and it&rsquo;s just simply outrageous.</p>
<p>We need action. It&rsquo;s shameful that we, as the most powerful nation on Earth, &hellip; can&rsquo;t even secure our own border and protect our own families.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/2bgf7cl" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2bgf7cl</a></p>
<p>Hopefully, Arizonans (and Sheriff Babeu) will see through McAmnesty&rsquo;s ruse and retire him permanently in August.</p>

		<p>So this is what it&rsquo;s come to now. We just start quietly ceding portions of our once sovereign nation to illegal invaders, drug- and people-smugglers, and other persons of ill-intent from another nation. Just say, &#8220;it&rsquo;s too dangerous for Americans to go there&#8221; and close it off. Just let Mexico have it. It&rsquo;s not like we won it in a war, then PAID them for the raw land anyway. It&rsquo;s not like WE made the improvements that made it a National Wildlife Refuge or anything like that. It&rsquo;s not like it belongs to us and we ought to be the ones to determine who uses it and how. When and where are we going to put a stop to this insanity? It&rsquo;s &#8220;too dangerous&#8221; for us to live in or even travel through certain portions of many large cities, now it&rsquo;s &#8220;too dangerous&#8221; for us to use our wild, natural lands for the purpose for which our forefathers intended. It&rsquo;s about time all of us took a look around and really SEE what&rsquo;s happening to our country and decide once and for all to TAKE IT BACK.  </p>

		<p>How about sending a massive military force down there to clean up this mess - on OUR BORDER - and stop wasting time and resources on pointless, fruitless warfare in the Middle East, etc. Using the military to protect us, the American citizen and our country&hellip;what an apparently novel concept!!  </p>

		<p>Obama has probably conceded, in his own mind, that he will never be reelected.  His aides have hinted as much.  But does he believe he can implement his new world order by November?  Helpless in the midst of the oil gush, he has a chance to look strong by announcing to Mexico that its citizens will not be tolerated running rampant on U.S. soil, making large tracts of it out of bounds for Americans.  He could declare that the latter have a right to freely use public land and send large numbers of troops to the border to enforce that right.  But, like so many blacks in powerful positions, he dithers.  His VP is apparently brain damaged, and so many of his aides are either lackeys or anti-white radicals that they will suggest nothing.<br>
At least the situation will serve to mobilize all patriotic Americans.</p>

		<p>This is very analogous to the &#8220;no-go&#8221; areas of France?</p>
<p>First the citizens stay out, fear for their lives with good reason.</p>
<p>Then the authorities and law enforcement stay out. Too dangerous.</p>
<p>Gangsters, druggies, terrorists create within U.S borders an enclave for &#8220;them&#8221;. De facto but still turning American territory over to &#8220;others&#8221;.</p>
<p>A trend only going to spread and like the proverbial wildfire.</p>

		<p>One more reason the pro-illegals don&rsquo;t want an actual fence is so that the interlopers can hop back across to safety when they want to leave.  A &#8220;dumb&#8221; fence will stop traffic both ways.  Right now, smugglers can reverse course if pursued thereby avoiding arrest.  With a real fence (double rows, anti-vehicle trenches, access road in the middle)most of these invaders will be easily trapped.       </p>

		<p>The disturbing thing is that the USA seems to be heading down the path of the Roman Empire. The government can no longer protect its citizens from foreign and domestic threats. The military and police now seem to grow more distant from the citizens. The force of law ends up protecting the predators. </p>
