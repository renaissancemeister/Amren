<h1>Iowa Republican: Obama Favors Blacks Over Whites</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Charles Babington, Yahoo! News, June 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rep. Steve King, known for sometimes incendiary remarks about immigration, Abu Ghraib and other issues, criticized Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder, who also is black, in an interview Monday on G. Gordon Liddy&rsquo;s nationally syndicated radio talk show.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m offended by Eric Holder and the president also, their posture,&#8221; said King, 61. &#8220;It looks like Eric Holder said that white people in America are cowards when it comes to race.&#8221;</p>
<p>King continued: &#8220;The president has demonstrated that he has a default mechanism in him that breaks down the side of race on the side that favors the black person in the case of professor Gates and officer Crowley.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As news of King&rsquo;s remarks spread, GOP House candidate Cory Gardner of Colorado canceled a planned $100 per-plate fundraiser where King was to speak. King&rsquo;s appearance was also canceled at a Colorado tea party gathering where he was scheduled to appear.</p>
<p>&#8220;His comments do not represent the tea party,&#8221; said Owen Loftus, a spokesman for Republican Ken Buck, who is running for Senate in Colorado.</p>
<p>Andy Stone, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, criticized Gardner for having scheduled King. &#8220;This is just the kind of over-the-top extremism that Colorado voters have rejected again and again,&#8221; Stone said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;When he had an Irish cop and a black professor, who&rsquo;d he side with?&#8221; King said. &#8220;He jumped to a conclusion without having heard the facts. And he ended up having to have a beer summit. The president of the United States has got to articulate a mission. And instead, he&rsquo;s playing race-bait games to undermine the law enforcement in the state of Arizona and across the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And after compiling what he [King] called an accurate civilian violent death rate for Iraq, he said living there was safer than in some U.S. cities, including New Orleans and Detroit.</p>

		<p>Typical Whites are jettisoning one of their own who speaks the truth about non white Obamakenyatta.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our problem. Our own people are enemies.  We can&rsquo;t win.</p>
<p>All we can do is hope that somehow the long reach of the Diversity Treatment gets hold of these race traitor Whites and teaches them the lesson of Race Reality.   We call it poetic justice.</p>

		<p> Rep. King is just one more in a string of White legislators who are being pilloried and excoriated for speaking the truth.</p>
<p> And even if it could be proven conclusively that he is wrong, what he said is obviously his opinion, to which he has a right, if I understand the American system correctly. At least, that&rsquo;s the way it USED to work.</p>
<p> His gutless wonder fellow Republicans are now running from him as if he had the bubonic plague, while the Democrats are gleefully trotting out their usual claptrap about &#8220;racists&#8221; and &#8220;incendiary comments.&#8221;</p>
<p> By the way, what is an &#8220;incendiary comment&#8221;? Why, it&rsquo;s a politically incorrect one that forces us to face one or more unpleasant truths about our society in A.D. 2010!</p>

		<p>Yahoo! uses its popularity to turn its outlets into medium of efficient leftist propaganda. As a matter of fact, what they do is a mild form of fascism (a form of non-Marxian socialism) with strong transnational flavor (I will not use noun &#8220;odor&#8221; here). I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they advocated first burning the &#8220;politically incorrect&#8221; books on stakes, and it that weren&rsquo;t enough (nothing really is), if they turned next to burning the authors, too.</p>
<p>How mentally incapacitated they are is beyond comprehension: most of their profits will disappear with First Amendment protection of controversial speech, and yet they seem against it. How stupid.<br/>

		<p>I guess King didnt get the memo. You still cannot speak truthfully when the subject is a black person. His own people (republicans) turned on him in a heartbeat for saying something that isnt politically correct concerning blacks. Im sure his fellow reps agree with what he said, but they cannot admit it publically and of course must publically condemn anyone for saying something politically INcorrect about blacks, that they know to be the truth.</p>
<p>IMO, reps or anyone else could indeed get away with speaking truthfully about black behaviour, they just dont realize it. Reps seem to live in fear of being branded a racist and thusly refuse to speak candidly about blacks. </p>
<p>I liken the &#8220;gag order&#8221; on speaking truthfully about blacks to the new Arizona law concerning illegals. Most pols walked on eggshells when the illegal alien subject was broached and refused to condemn them. Then Arizona passed their wonderful law (THANK YOU ARIZONA), and polls nationwide consistantly showed the majority of Americans SUPPORT such action. Now pols are much more likely to speak candidly about the illegal alien invasion and they are scrambling in state after state to enact laws similar to the one Arizona passed. </p>
<p>If the reps would back one of their own whenever they speak openly and honestly about black (mis)behaviour, it wouldnt be long before it would be accepted. But when they come down on someone speaking truthfully, as King did, then it delays the time when it will be accepted. </p>
<p>IMO, America is ripe for the ending of this politically correct nonsense. All it takes is for someone with some backbone, LIKE MR KING, to get the ball rolling. AND for his spineless brethren to refrain from condemning him.</p>

In his context, those are two mutually exclusive ideas.  Typical black-speak.</p>
<p>White American can&rsquo;t unleash our innovation because we are crowded out by the Diversity who demands that we &#8220;atone for the sins of segregation by holding ourselves accountable to people of color for our unearned White Privilege.&#8221;</p>
<p>If an exercise of creative genius and innovative initiative puts a debt on us to apologize to the blacks for our White advancement, then all progress is retarded by toxic racial politics.   If we are constantly auditing our companies for &#8220;hidden and lingering biases&#8221; that prevent us from hiring as many blacks into executive positions as the naacp tells us to, then we are distracted and disordered by constant agitation from the blacks on behalf of the blacks.</p>
<p><br/>
We don&rsquo;t feel like exercising any White initiative if blacks get to swoop in and skim the benefits from our achievements.</p>
<p>And Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;seize our destiny&#8221; is pure race hatred.  That means &#8220;now we can seize more tax money from the majority Whites and transfer it to my black buddies in government and with favored contractors and unions.&#8221;</p>
<p><br/>
This won&rsquo;t last. Obama is a one termer, unless ACORN, the Black Panthers and Eric Holder can steal the election.  But as a one termer, we will always have white libs at Newsweek and MSNBC telling us how racist America is for not giving him the second term he deserved.  They will force us &#8220;to do more&#8221; to help blacks to atone for our vote against Obamakenyatta.</p>
<p><br/>
Break down barriers that separate you from you White Awareness. Transcend the Diversity Lies. Donate your time and treasure to WHITES ONLY, but firs  make sure those Whites aren&rsquo;t Diversity Enablers and White Humanity Traitors.</p>

<p>I detest this racist Holder with ferocity and passion.  Although the winds of real change are upon us,  if the above statement is taken as general and not all-encompassing, I&rsquo;m afraid Holder was correct when he said those words.  More importantly, kudos to King for going where few public figures dare.</p>

		<p>Just because some people are overly polite or even over-the-top PC in public doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t fully understand racial politics.  And voting is by secret ballot.  Only 44% of whites voted for Obama, and surely less will do so in 2012.  </p>

<p>Well, there is another possibility. </p>
<p>A &#8220;civil rights&#8221; attorney will file a &#8220;voting rights&#8221; lawsuit claiming that Obama lost because of &#8220;racist&#8221; votes, and a judge will impose cumulative voting that counts all Obama votes six times.

		<p>Just like the victorious forces in the European theater of WWII engaged in a program of denazification of the parts of Germany they occupied in the post-war years, denazification being an omnibus term to describe the physical destruction of GNSWP-constructed monuments, prohibition of the dissemination of Nazi ideology, propaganda and psychological warfare relating to collectivising the guilt of the Holocaust and other GNSWP atrocities on the backs of Germanity as a whole, kangaroo court trials of the remaining high-level military and political leaders from the GNSWP regime, the CIA financing far-left political parties in what would become and eventually was the Federal Republic of Germany (&ldquo;West Germany&rdquo;), such as the communists in the early years and the Green Party in latter years (IMHO, the Green Party of a united Germany is still on the American payroll) to serve as a diversion to funnel right wing sympathies toward non-racial center-right Christian Democrat-style or American Republican-style parties and away from GNSWP imitators, and some other things, I think we need a program of destupificiation of the American Republican Party.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reading some of the &ldquo;fallout&rdquo; over King&rsquo;s remarks. First off, supporting black people is exactly what a sane halfway intelligent adult black man should do.  (I only wish whites would start favoring whites).  But the only minor point of disagreement I have with King is that, politically, IMHO, Obama seems to be taking black voters for granted (which he can).  Almost everything Obama has done or wants to do seems to benefit one of the following constituencies:  Hispanics, homosexuals, abortionists, Kenya, trial lawyers and public employee unions.  The black vote that was jazzed in 2008 to elect a black President will be just as jazzed in 2012 to retain a black President  &mdash;  All those other faithful Democrat constituencies aren&rsquo;t so easily fooled, and want results.</p>
<p>But, like the Trent Lott non-scandal at Strom Thurmond&rsquo;s 100th Birthday Party, the kind of people whining the loudest about what King said aren&rsquo;t Democrats, but pandering Republican neo-con types, and even a lot of people in the Tea Party Movement.  This is a point that James Edwards made in his new book  &mdash;  Like me, Edwards noticed that it was hypocritical for the GOP to call the Democrats on the carpet for &ldquo;double standards&rdquo; re Harry Reid and the &ldquo;N***o dialect&rdquo; non-issue vis-a-vis Trent Lott, because it wasn&rsquo;t the Democrats that wanted Trent Lott&rsquo;s head in late 2002 and early 2003, it was the Stupid Party types.<br/>

		<p>I&rsquo;m surprised no on has commented on the fact that when criticized by the left, King has refused to back down and has (correctly) pointed out that this is anti-white RACISM (the term racism specifically used by him).</p>
<p>And&hellip;&hellip;there is no huge fanfare in the media.  There is no placing him in stocks to have rotten vegetables at him.  In short, after only a perfunctory chiding, there is near silence.</p>
<p>The first thing to notice is that this is a major incident of open racial awareness among a representative of whites, in political power.  That is incredibly important.  It shows that racial awareness is now common place among whites.  Common enough that it is reflected in our elected representatives.  Think about the implications of that.</p>
<p>The second thing to notice is how very, VERY weak non-white identity politics has become.  They can no longer effectively shut someone up by using the race card&hellip;..because, quite frankly, the vast majority of whites no longer recognize it.</p>
<p>The new paradigm is right on the cusp of becoming, whites are not racist, at all&hellip;..but blacks are.</p>
