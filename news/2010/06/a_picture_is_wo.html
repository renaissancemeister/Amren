<h1>A Picture Is Worth a Thousand Words</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thomas Jackson, <font color="red">Special to AR News,</font> June 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The <b> June 4 issue of the <cite>Charlotte Observer</cite></b> has a short article about three men who raped a woman in her apartment and then ransacked the place  &mdash;  a depressingly routine news story these days. What caught our eye, however, were the police drawings of the suspects, which we have reproduced <em>exactly</em> as they appear on the <cite>Observer</cite> web page (including Number 2&rsquo;s non-mouth).</p>
<p>What race are these fellows? Number 3 must be black, but the other two, especially Number 1, could be white. Fortunately, the <cite>Observer</cite> article included suspect descriptions:</p>
<p>&#8220;One was a dark-skinned black male, about 6-foot  &mdash;  2 or 6-foot-3, age 23 or 24, wearing dark clothes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another was a black male, about 5-foot-10 and thin with long hair, wearing loose clothing with a shirt over his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;The third was a black male of medium build with a round face and short hair, wearing black sunglasses and a baseball hat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now we know that Number 3 is a &#8220;black male,&#8221; as we suspected. Number 2 had the shirt over his face, which must be why the victim could not describe the mouth. That means Number 1 is the &#8220;dark-skinned black male.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looks to us more like a Martian than he does a dark-skinned black. Maybe the lighting is different in North Carolina.</p>

		<p>When I first looked at these photos and I was just a little bit confused in trying to figure out why the makers of these photos depicted these Blacks with such White-appearing skin.  My first thought after a few minutes was that they might be afraid to make their skin dark in the photos for fear that that in some way negatively portrays Blacks.  It is apparent to me now that they are so afraid of being called &#8220;racist&#8221; that they don&rsquo;t want to show the true color of any Blacks&rsquo; skin, that might make us think Blacks commit crimes more often than Whites (even though they do). </p>

		<p>A similar story about a black composite suspect drawing from St. Louis in the last few days:  The drawing of the suspect is that as the suspect was described, a black man, early 20s, dreadlocks.  However, the drawing was drawn so generically, that the authorities are getting tons of useless tips, because it looks like almost every third young black man you see.  And it&rsquo;s not just a matter of &#8220;they all look alike.&#8221;  Heck, just based on the drawing, I saw the man in question in three different places at the same time on Sunday.</p>

		<p>Obviously, a computer was used to generate these drawings. Does the software program that was used not have a feature that allows the user to adjust the lightness or darkness of the skin tone? I would say the answer is obviously yes, or else it would be worthless.</p>
<p>Now we come to the question of how accurate the drawings are aside from skin tone. Picture #1, which is supposed to be a black male, has widely-set eyes but does not have a broad, flat nose. </p>
<p>Finally, why are the images in gray scale? We&rsquo;re long past the days when pictures of this type are most widely seen on post-office bulletin boards or in the newspapers. In most cases, the pictures are seen on a computer screen. So why no color? I think I know the answer.</p>

		<p>If No.1 is a dark-skinned black, then he should have been drawn as DARK-SKINNED.  Also, the skin tones of the other two should have been described, and No.2 should have been described, in print, as having dreads.  <br>
It doesn&rsquo;t sound as if they want to catch these creeps.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;He looks to us more like a Martian than he does a dark-skinned black. Maybe the lighting is different in North Carolina.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nope Mr. Jackson, what number one really looks like, is an effete &ldquo;victim&rdquo; type, not a Martian. Perhaps a lesbian or a transsexual, but none the less, a &ldquo;victim&rdquo; of nebulous ancestry. Is that not, what might be the planned confusion of this article&rsquo;s intent and  masking? That he is the &ldquo;victim,&rdquo; when in reality he is the main perpetrator and ringleader in this attack?</p>
<p>It is expected that a multicultural rag like &ldquo;The Charlotte Observer,&rdquo; must endlessly invent new ways of deceiving or even mystifying its readers into diversity stupors. With this in mind, a short article with some rather oddly similar drawings depicting the suspects as almost a metamorphic progression of themselves into one criminal might do the trick. That is, if you largely expect most of your readership to only be skimming through such an article over breakfast, prior to leaving for work in the morning.</p>
<p>Please pay very special attention to the last minute of this &ldquo;acclaimed&rdquo; artist&rsquo;s video:</p>

		<p>There is a discomfort level with the police and the media with stories that have black assailants and white victims. And, in such cases, there seems to be a reluctance to allege a hate crime no matter how brutal the crimes are.  The Knoxville case is a prime example.  There was no charges of hate crimes and very little national media coverage. Also, many newspapers will not publish the race of the perps when it is a black on white crime. If it doesn&rsquo;t fit some sort of predetermined narrative of how we view taboo subjects like race and crime, there&rsquo;s a disinclination to cover it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;It don&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re black or white&#8221;?  After watching the video that John PM linked within his comment, it struck me as quite humorous thinking and wondering how much money MJ spent trying to look WHITE!</p>
<p>As for the police drawings of the low life thugs above, don&rsquo;t all of you know the reason they look like they do is because of the legacy of slavery??</p>

<p>My response: That last minute was definitely worth watching. The very last moment was also interesting, showing the filming crew terminating with the young black woman as being the in-the-flesh prototype for all the preceding racial, etc. variants. Or so our brains are meant to subliminally see it.</p>

		<p>Years ago now, when they had the Zebra killings in San Fran, the police detectives had an artist draw a composite sketch. Some of the locals said that this was just like putting a bullseye target on the backs of all black men. Some wag then retorted that when the police previously had printed in the paper a composite sketch of the Zodiac killer [white man], no one made any objections. Well, you can never please everyone.</p>

		<p>This is why I no longer get my news from the MSM (mainstream newsmedia). It just can&rsquo;t be trusted to be honest or objective. Everything is filtered through the prism of political correctness. As a good rule of thumb, if no description of race is offered you can probably make a safe bet the suspect is black, since the MSM would never hesitate to identify the race of a White accused of a crime. Its like the old, probably apocryphal, tale of the first shipmate noting in his daily journal, &#8216;the captain was sober&rsquo;. In other words the captain is usually drunk. </p>

		<p>You have to remember there is a new first ever black police chief named Rodney Monroe who was police chief in Richmond under black (mixed) Doug Wilder who was Va 1st &#8220;black&#8221; gov and we know how the whites long ago were run out of the city that is blacker than Atlanta. </p>
<p>The only way Charlotte and other cities in NC have compensated is due to the most liberal city annexation laws in America and they annex the entire county into the city to double taxes on all to pay for mostly social programs. </p>
<p>Monroe not only lied about and then after caught played dumb about his VCU college degree to get the Charlotte job but he claimed he reduced the murders by 50% in Richmond by only a couple yrs. Monroe had friends at VCU and could only produce a total of 9 hours credit yet got his degree. Incredible. The local news lib rag covers everything up because it is actually run by blacks but that is a well kept secret.</p>
<p>Meanwhile we know figures dont lie but liars can figure as allegedly rape and murder have gone down in the city yet it seems there is more news about black crime than there ever was. </p>
<p>Could we have discovered the reason why after a white female was attacked robbed beaten and raped by three black thugs that seems to be common and they never seem to seem to catch the black criminals either who rape and murder rob and assault daily.</p>
<p>It is apparently now racial profiling to sketch pics of black rapists of white females showing black traits so they are made to look white to tone it all down for police chief Monroe. </p>
<p>Whites are truly in mortal danger and the most hideous ways to cover it up are being performed. It will only get worse.</p>

		<p>The raped female was WHITE as usual.</p>
<p>They are trying to eliminate race  and in doing so it will eliminate who is committing all the violent crime. </p>
<p>The blacks and liberals who run the show at the Charlotte Observer have been caught in their web of lies. </p>
<p>Where are the lips on the center one? They have been doctored out by a computer. </p>
<p>The one on the right looks like a white female. </p>
<p>This is astounding but clearly proves that the police dept under a black chief, black mayor, black county manager and most of the politicans who are black, are clearly trying to coverup the real criminal element in society.</p>

<p>Joe, what is wrong with White Europeans? They have sat back and not uttered a peep about their own displacement in their own lands. At least, most of them haven&rsquo;t. I also am dismayed that in America it is getting close to that point here. We have a few WN but the majority of Whites are clueless and apathetic to their own displacement.</p>

		<p>Obviously we should be on the lookout for grey aliens.  </p>
<p>However, since the term &#8220;alien&#8221; is out of favor with the Political Commissars of speech and thought control, maybe we need to be on the lookout for &#8220;undocumented extra-terrestrial migrants representing diversity of respect for personal integrity and well-being&#8221; (as it wouldn&rsquo;t be very nice to refer to them as rapists, or criminals of any kind - unless of course it can be alleged that they were prospects for a Duke University athletics team&hellip;  </p>

They do love those black guys, and they do love those latinos, and they do chastise any white that stands up for himself just the teeniest bit.

<p>Eventually, they&rsquo;re going to catch onto your trick (for identifying perps) and just stop revealing the race of any criminals at all.  That will keep you from figuring it out.<br>
So there!   &mdash;   you evil racisss, you!!!</p>
<p>Well, maybe you could still tell by the name or the neighborhood. Therefore, those must be banished too.<br>
Whites must not be allowed a clue!  Crime will be made a forbidden subject in The Peoples&rsquo; New Multicultural Utopia.</p>
