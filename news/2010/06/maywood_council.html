			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hector Tobar, Los Angeles Times, June 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The city of Maywood can&rsquo;t be trusted to hire a school crossing guard.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the verdict of assorted insurance companies. And after spending several hours this week at Maywood City Hall, watching in stunned silence as the City Council laid off just about every employee who works there, I have to agree.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the back of the meeting room, the council&rsquo;s supporters cheered. They see the layoffs, which included the dismantling of the Police Department, as the purge they&rsquo;ve long been waiting for.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let them all go,&#8221; said Juan Ayala, an L.A. County employee and a Maywood resident since the 1960s. And then he added in Spanish: &#8220;Es una limpieza de casa,&#8221; a housecleaning. He used another Spanish word to describe the city&rsquo;s employees: una cochinada, a herd of swine.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The people running Maywood came to office in 2007 promising a government friendlier to the large immigrant population. They&rsquo;re backed by a handful of community groups with Spanish names.</p>
<p>They said they were going to remake City Hall, but instead they&rsquo;re dismantling it. And it&rsquo;s the people who keep Maywood streets paved and parks clean who are paying the price. The school crossing guards were the last group of employees added to the official layoff list on Monday night, almost as an afterthought. {snip}</p>
<p>Now employees from neighboring Bell will perform most city functions, under contract. The Sheriff&rsquo;s Department will take the place of the Maywood police. {snip}</p>
<p>The members of Maywood&rsquo;s current council say the crisis isn&rsquo;t their fault. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This city has been in a bad situation for a long time,&#8221; Councilwoman and Vice Mayor Veronica Guardado told me after the meeting was over. &#8220;I inherited these problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the public record says otherwise. Most damning is a memorandum on Maywood issued on May 26 by the California Joint Powers Insurance Authority, a government entity formed by more than 120 cities and other public agencies to share insurance costs.</p>
<p>In its 32-year history, the JPIA has never terminated a member&rsquo;s coverage. Until now.</p>
<p>Last July, the insurance authority issued Maywood a warning, telling the city it had to end a long pattern of &#8220;passive administration.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After a while Maywood even failed to send the JPIA periodic reports. And the council never hired a city manager. Finally the JPIA had enough. Saying Maywood had demonstrated &#8220;a consistent pattern&#8221; of missing deadlines and not fulfilling its obligations, it canceled the city&rsquo;s insurance.</p>
<p>I asked Vice Mayor Guardado how the council had managed to keep from filling the city manager position for an entire year. After all, the recession has created legions of applicants for every other job in local government.</p>
<p>Guardado blamed the council&rsquo;s political opponents, a small group whose most vocal leader is Sandra Orozco, a City Hall gadfly who uses a walker and will proudly tell you about her bigger battle  &mdash;  with multiple sclerosis. Her group &#8220;scared off&#8221; the council&rsquo;s preferred candidate for the city manager job, Guardado said.</p>

		<p>There was a very interesting piece by Will Grigg on Lewrockwell this morning.</p>
<p>It would appear that the municipality lost its liability coverage due to the incredible number of outrageous acts of police brutality, false arrests, and other criminal acts committed by the police force of this 40,000 population township.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found Mr. Grigg to be a totally honest, thoughtful, and convincing libertarian commentator.  Anybody wanting to read this piece can find it on the lewrockwell site. </p>

		<p>When one leaves people to their own device, which in the U.S. is still (mostly) the case, they will create a community that reflects their genetically determined nature.</p>
<p>If one allows a bunch of squirrels to self-govern (assuming that one is able to teach them democracy), they will move the city hall to the nearby tree and keep burying nuts in the school playground.</p>
<p>Same with Mexicans. If you let them do what they want then they will &hellip; well, just look what they did to their country of origin, Mexico. Or even better yet, just look what kind of civilization the Aztecs built (human sacrifice was but one of many symptoms of their violent nature) and you will know the &#8220;ideal&#8221; to which we are headed.</p>
<p>It takes a moron or a liberal agitator to insist that you can convert these people onto Westerners indistinguishable (except for their external appearance) from you and me. This claim is one of the inventions of ideologues of the left. Its (forced) acceptance moves us some 500 years backwards. (The idiots insist that it&rsquo;s progress.) Sure, when there is only a few of them (&#8220;Latinos&#8221;) among the real Western citizens then they will conform to the majority and learn how to behave in a way that is congruent with Western norms and not with their nature, particularly when their genes have been diluted by interbreeding and when they are handsomely rewarded for proper behavior. But as soon as they can create their own communities, they tend to revert to their natural instincts, as the case of Maywood suggests. (Not that L.A. or CA are that much better.)    </p>
<p>The liberals never provided any meaningful proof or evidence for their absurd claims (like that the race is a &#8220;purely social construct,&#8221; etc.). Their &#8220;research&#8221; is full of factual errors, fallacies, and outright censorship, so whatever conclusions it offers, it&rsquo;s not to be trusted. Unfortunately, they took over American universities (particularly, over such strategic sciences as anthropology, sociology, etc.) where they entrenched themselves, immunizing themselves from truth and reality, very much like antibiotic-resistant bacteria in a host body surrounds themselves with a membrane that makes them immune to drugs. (Let alone their ethnic studies that are incubators of future revolutionaries and liberators for the ethnic &#8220;minorities.&#8221;)</p>
<p>We must take back our universities or else our society will never recover from this madness.<br/>

		<p>     The readers of this web-site are very knowledgeable and insightful.  As we all know, Senator McCain is very pro-amnesty and pro-immigrant invasion.  Yet, on the surface, it would appear that someone with his credentials, veteran and ex-POW, would be very much in favor of defending and conserving America.  But, of course, he is not.  I do not understand why McCain is the way he is.  Perhaps someone on this web-site can help me to understand.  Was something done to him in Hanoi?  Is he a type of Manchurian candidate?  Is he a sociopath?  If anybody out there has McCain figured out, let me know.  Thanks.</p>

		<p>I think people kinda missed the point.  What type of police FORCE is needed to control a 95% mexican criminal population?</p>
<p>Such behavior might be criminal in this country but it is necessary to prevent said population from burning the town right to the ground.  Out of control peoples tend to form totalitarian societies to get by force what they cannot get by nature.</p>
<p>This news item will disappear down the memory hole.  But I would be very interested to see what Maywood is like, a year from now, or 5 years from now.</p>
<p>This is the great problem of non-white immigration.  But it is also the great solution.  They cannot live here unless we feed them, they cannot stop themselves from burning down their own homes unless we allow them to form a police state.</p>
<p>Eventually, the will to do both of these things will run out.  The mexicans will leave ghost towns in their wake&hellip;.but they will leave.  It takes mass effort on the part of whites for them to stay, is the issue.  It&rsquo;s a non-sustainable situation.  Maywood is an example of this.</p>

		<p>The abolishment of little burgs like this one will be the norm as we continue on into the next Winter and Spring.  Thereafter, it will so bad with so many paybacks occurring I&rsquo;m pretty sure a committee of citizens will have to chain and shackle them to get them to take an elected position.</p>
<p>While the revenue was flowing local political hacks were spending money on anything and everything, including using a lot of taxpayer dollars to pay their personal expenses.  My, my, my, how big and powerful they felt.  They fought over these little political offices as if it were a matter of life or death, so great was their perverted desire for power, money and position.  </p>
<p>For years this country has drawn to politics MOSTLY those who have a propensity for crime and all of them have a burning need to feel important from the local level on up.  Since we have a way to go before we hit bottom, they&rsquo;re still wanting a piece of the action.  Just look at Fla. Gov. Crist and Arlen Spector.  Both prostitute themselves to anyone, any party or anything in order to stay in political office.</p>
<p>Speed traps and cameras are everywhere in a desperate attempt by the criminal elements in government to maintain their power and positions.  License fees, property taxes, sales taxes, hidden taxes are being included everywhere and contained within most all products and services.  Corrupt politicians are fighting desperately to bilk the public for all they can rather than cut down on the size of their overgrown, monstrous governments.</p>
<p>But in the end, most will be forced to cut back to sane levels or face mass riots on the streets, and many will be forced out of &#8220;business&#8221; (The business of playing powerful, greedy politicians)just like this little multi-million dollar extravagance that amounted to just a handful of residents who didn&rsquo;t need a government at all.</p>
<p>In the end, there will be skeleton crews on the public dole, and they will be hated and reviled, because the increase in taxes they enacted will still be there.  Have you ever heard of a politician annulling or rescinding a tax once it is put in place?</p>

		<p>Flood a place with Mexicans and&hellip; it eventually looks just like Mexico.  Meanwhile, the city council says it isn&rsquo;t their fault.  Instead, this must the fault of the English-speaking whites who were ethnically cleansed from the area and who now comprise only 2.6% of the population.  Having destroyed Maywood, this horde of human locusts will look for greener pastures.</p>

		<p>Poor Maywood.  I lived there in the early &#8216;60&rsquo;s.  Nice, middle America kind of town.  My grandmother had a cafe on Slauson, between Atlantic and Pacific Ave&rsquo;s. I walked to work, grave yard shift,  and never had a thought of any problems. Homes had nice neat lawns, flowers and was clean. Industry throbbed in the next little burg.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the 90&rsquo;s. Pacific Blvd. was a garbage dump.  Debris floated in the air and swirled down the streets, where it wasn&rsquo;t piled on the curb.  One lonely old white woman sat on a bench,waiting for a bus, terror in her eyes as she watched the dark skinned hoards kill her with their flat stares as they passed. </p>
<p>The end result of war is control over the land.  Mexico won there. Or was it El Salvador?</p>

		<p>You know what the real tragedy is?  These people who moved into an all-white town some 30-40 years ago and ruined it will be &#8216;migrating&rsquo; for a &#8216;better life&rsquo; to another American town.  </p>
<p>Then they&rsquo;ll ruin that one and then&hellip;  Until all of America is a reflection of current Mexico today.  </p>
<p>There will be a few pockets of black folks in poor, violent enclaves, a few last-stand white areas that the &#8216;rainbow coalition (read almost all non-white)&rsquo; Feds will forever try to &#8216;integrate&rsquo; and a few Asian pockets that will cut themselves off from everyone, but the majority of the land from sea to shining sea will be occupied by latinos.</p>

		<p>In its own way, this may be the breach in the dam we are all wishing for when it comes to liberalism. Here is a town that was done in by illegal immigrants and rogue police officers. If memory serves, this was a hardcore &#8220;Sanctuary city&#8221;. Gee, why would this lovely community obtain the reputation with law enforcement officers as the place of last resort for employment? The equivalent of the local lock-up or probation in some other places. I guess when you have been fired from a similar job with 4 or 5 employers, maybe you aren&rsquo;t a fit for that position. </p>
<p>I guess this town needed to hire a Hispanic version of Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton to go protest before the JPIA and have the federal goons threaten them for canceling their liability coverage. Maybe the city of LA would have the ability to make this happen, but Maywood will probably be absorbed into another community. </p>

		<p>The William Norman Grigg referred to by some posters actually blames Maywood&rsquo;s demise on the actions of the police force and not the presence of illegal immigrants. In fact, he talks of the police force using it&rsquo;s powers to confiscate the autos of the illegals. He even complains about office Brent Talmo calling a fellow officer a derogatory name used for blacks.</p>
<p>While I appreciate Mr. Griggs views of the police state, and tend to agree with much of what he says, he is certainly no friend of White racialists. He is half mexican himself, and I doubt if he would agree with most of the Whites on this forum. Check out his article titled &#8220;The Borders Are Closing In.</p>
