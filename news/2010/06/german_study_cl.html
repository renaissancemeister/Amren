<h1>German Study Claims Devout Islamic Youth More Violence-Prone</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Monsters and Critics, June 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The more devout a young Muslim male in Germany is, the more likely he is to resort to violence, according to a federally financed study seen Saturday by the German Press Agency dpa.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The as-yet-unpublished research was jointly conducted by the federal Interior Ministry and the KFN criminology research institute in Hanover headed by Christian Pfeiffer. Dpa obtained a copy in Berlin.</p>
<p>In a conclusion, the authors said the finding might be explained by hypotheses of Rauf Ceylan, an ethnic Turkish scholar in German who studies religion.</p>
<p>They said Ceylan had discovered that a majority of mosque clergy in Germany encouraged their congregations to practice a conservative form of Islam and to preserve their ethnic roots.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The findings characterised imams or clergy as men working only temporarily in Germany with no knowledge of the German language, preventing them from developing a positive attitude to German culture or from questioning male dominance.</p>
<p>The study suggested those views were transferred to young people at the mosque, whereas non-devout boys picked up more liberal German attitudes. Pfeiffer wrote: &#8216;This is not a problem with Islam, but a problem with their education in Islam.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>As I see Amren is global. Very good.</p>
<p>To tell you this, Pfeiffer is one of the most liberal lefty in the history of German statistics. He lied on a court to blame whites for racism when an accident happened in a pool: He said whites attacked the kid and pushed it under water, but it came out that nobody was near to her and he knew it.</p>
<p>And even this communist white-hating liberal was not able any more to see that immigrants are more violent even if you consider all the social conditions as poverty and school achievements. The results were too clear: Immigrants from Arab countries are much more criminal and violent than whites. </p>

		<p>&lsquo;This is not a problem with Islam, but a problem with their education in Islam.&rsquo;</p>
<p> Say what?  Is there a difference?  In any case, the problem is Islam, edcuation within Islam, and pretty much anything that is influenced by Islam.  Islam is not a &#8220;religion of peace&#8221;, and is more a social behavioral experiment gone wrong than anything else. This is due to the fact that Islam allows those who commit acts of hateful violence to push their responsibility onto another entity, that being their god or prophet, and so do not accept responsibility for themselves.  This mindset is identical in nature to Milgram&rsquo;s electric shock studies which showed the negative effects of obedience to authority. But that&rsquo;s only half the problem. It takes an open-borders, anti-White, anti-European, pro-multicultural policy of government to allow Islam to gain a foothold and thus spread its tyranny.  Unfortunate as it is, that&rsquo;s what we have now throughout the Western world.  I would add that anyone who is devoutly anything is probably more prone to violence on behalf of whatever it is to which they are adhering as compared to those who are more open-minded about everything. Of course, being overly open-minded is what has gotten us into this disaster with Islam in the first place!!!!! </p>

		<p>They are violent because of the religion. </p>
<p>NOT because of mistaken teaching. They are violent because of correct teaching.</p>
<p>Those of us that are kaffir [various spellings exist] according to Muslim teaching are sub-human, lesser than a cockroach, devoid of any humanity, unclean, etc. This is what they are taught. Given that the Muslim has been in contact with, violently so, &#8220;western&#8221; civilization and Christianity for 1400 years, it is not a surprise that the Muslim &#8220;youth&#8221; is so violent toward others.</p>
<p>The Muslim sees the west and Christianity as the ONLY IMPEDIMENT TO TOTAL WORLD DOMINATION. Has so for 1400 years. We are an irritating speck in their eye that they must rub all the time. Want to get the speck out of the once and for all this time.</p>

		<p>#3 is right.  And, as I believe Geert Wilders himself stated, the problem isn&rsquo;t Moslems, but Islam.  <br>
Of course, most western liberals don&rsquo;t seem to understand religion, so they can&rsquo;t grasp the problem with Islam.  I once read that Mohammed Atta said he didn&rsquo;t know he was a Moslem(!)until an aunt informed him.  I suppose she emphasized the fact that the family was Moslem, which meant, in Islamic thinking, that he was as well.  So, what does this intelligent, educated, modern-thinking young man do?  Goes to a mosque, fully UNDERSTANDS the Koran, and goes jihad!  </p>

		<p>I have posted this link before but I will do so again because many of the readers here might have missed it. This book &lsquo;Islam and the Psychology of the Musulman&rsquo; authored by Andre Servier, is the best ever written on Islam from the point of view of a non-Muslim. <br>
<a href="http://musulmanbook.blogspot.com/2005/11/read-this-first-about-book-islam-and.html" rel="nofollow">http://musulmanbook.blogspot.com/2005/11/read-this-first-about-book-islam-and.html</a><br>
Especially lesson number 14 is a must read. <br>
<a href="http://musulmanbook.blogspot.com/2005/11/ch-xiv-14-mind-of-musulman.html" rel="nofollow">http://musulmanbook.blogspot.com/2005/11/ch-xiv-14-mind-of-musulman.html</a><br>
You will realise that it is impossible to reform Islam in the long term. <br>
Besides this is an attempt by the leftists to divide the muslims into the good &lsquo;moderate&rsquo; and evil &lsquo;extremist&rsquo; camps. There is no moderate Islam, it is a liberal delusion.<br>
http://97.74.65.51/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=9781</p>
<p>Besides one must realise we are not dealing with German muslims here but muslims of foreign descent. So the problem is not only religious and cultural but most important of all it is RACAIL.  <br>
The only solution to this is the complete expulsion of all non-Whites from Germany and from Europe.<br>

		<p>-They may be a bit more prone to beating their women and mutilating unbelievers. Otherwise, I don´t believe that study (oops).<br>
However, I´ve been asking myself for a long time why ALL those &#8220;Islamic Culture Centers&#8221; need a karate school.<br>
(not that &#8220;Black Community Centers&#8221; are better, just sayin´)</p>
