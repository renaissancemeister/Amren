<h1>Hispanic Farmers Fight to Reclaim Heritage</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeremy Schwartz, Austin American-Statesman, June 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to make it the way it was before I die,&#8221; said Modesta Rodriguez Salazar, 66, who now cares for what is left of her family&rsquo;s heritage.</p>
<p>She said the farm&rsquo;s downfall was due to the denial of several loans in the 1980s by local U.S. Department of Agriculture agents, which prevented the family from planting. One by one, her siblings  &mdash;  she was one of 13  &mdash;  left the farm their father bought in 1952 after realizing they couldn&rsquo;t make a living from it.</p>
<p>The farm is one of more than 700 nationwide  &mdash;  and 143 in Texas  &mdash;  at the heart of a decade-long legal battle that a generation of Hispanic farmers has been waging against the Agriculture Department. The farmers sued the government in 2000, claiming widespread and institutionalized discrimination at the hands of government agents, who they say denied or delayed crucial farm loans, resulting in the ruin and loss of many family farms.</p>
<p>{snip} Last month, the U.S. government made a $1.33 billion offer to settle the case. And though the farmers and their attorney call the offer grossly inadequate, it signals the possible resolution of what some U.S. officials call a dark chapter in American farming history.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>African American farmers received a $1 billion settlement in 1999, and in February the White House announced another $1.25 billion for black farmers not included in the initial class action settlement.</p>
<p>The more than $2 billion that black farmers are slated to receive helps explain the anger Hispanic farmers have expressed since their settlement offer was made public. Though it&rsquo;s not clear exactly how many farmers would be eligible for the settlement, the number could reach the tens of thousands.</p>
<p>Stephen Hill, the attorney for the Hispanic farmers, argues that it&rsquo;s not fair for them to receive about half of what black farmers are getting despite being more numerous (the 2007 Department of Agriculture census shows 30,599 black-owned farms and 55,570 Hispanic-owned farms in the U.S.). And the Hispanic farmers would share the $1.33 billion with female farmers, who number 306,000 according to the 2007 census, Hill said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The four cases have followed different paths. Though the cases brought by black and Native American farmers were certified as class action lawsuits, Hispanic and female farmers were denied such certification by a federal judge, a decision later upheld by the Supreme Court. The Department of Justice said that because of the denial, it could not negotiate a classwide settlement with Hispanic and female farmers, meaning they would have to pursue individual claims against the government.</p>
<p>But the Obama administration has made it a priority to settle large civil rights cases at the Department of Agriculture, and last month Justice Department officials reversed course and started negotiating with them as a group, officials said.</p>
<p>Native American farmers are also negotiating with the Department of Justice.</p>
<p>According to Hill, the settlement offer comes with a $50,000 cap on damages for individual farmers, regardless of how much they have lost. Black farmers were able to get many times that amount if they could prove their losses, he said.</p>

<p>Me too. I think we have different objectives in mind, however.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get serious though: are they really considering this? And they actually gave black and &#8220;Native American&#8221; farmers conpensation for something?!? For what, might I ask? They were probably denied loans at a larger rate than whites simply because they don&rsquo;t know how to run a farm effectively.</p>

		<p>I see, if a big corporation comes in and forces you off your farm with economic and political power, it is racism if you are not white.</p>
<p>They once made a movie about it.  Don&rsquo;t tell anyone because the affected people were white.  (The movie is called &#8220;Grapes of Wrath,&#8221; Shhhh,&hellip; from a book a white man named Steinbeck wrote).</p>
<p>But lots of white farmers lost farms to industrial farming in the 1970s and 80s.  It was going on everywhere and the buyers were Saudis, as I recall.  They owned the big agribusinesses that bought the Midwest.  </p>

Reminds me of the old joke about the guy who wins Two Hundred Million in the Powerball Lotto. The reporter asks, &#8220;What are your plans now?&#8221; The man replies, &#8220;I`m gonna continue farming for another two seasons till the money`s all gone&#8221;&hellip;</p>

		<p>The issue here is loans.  People are not entitled to loans.  You get a loan according to the good graces of someone else.  Then, if you qualify and present a good case, the loan officer can give you the loan.  He doesn&rsquo;t HAVE TO give you anything.  After all, you are the one with hat in hand.</p>
<p>I am sure there are lots of white farmers who didn&rsquo;t get loans.  Many others were pushed off their land by big corporations with government ties.  Maybe they should band together and sue.  For that matter, there must be some Mongolian farmers in Illinois or Hmong farmers in Wisconson, or even Syrian farmers in Iowa who didn&rsquo;t get loans.  (There have been Arab farmers in America for over 8o years!)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been denied a loan before, but then I only applied for loans for which I was qualified and I have always been considered a good credit risk.  If I go apply for a big loan for which I can obviously not pay, should I be angry if I don&rsquo;t get it?</p>

		<p>My grandfather owned and operated a small family farm in Iowa.  Never borrowed with federally subsidized loans.  Excellent farmer.  Retired in his 50s, and lived off the rental of the family farm to another successful farmer.  So many farmers have taken the easy money route of govt loans.  And apparently if they don&rsquo;t qualify are allowed to claim discrimination 30 years later with paid out claims far exceeding what they could have earned.  These are farmers alright, farming the rich fields of federal handouts.</p>

		<p>I could have looked up the stats, however due to time constraints, let me just say this, the number of mestizo&rsquo;s who lost their farms would be minute compared to whites. There are single digit percentages of all farmers as compared to a few decades ago. There are millions of families who once made a living on small farms, who no longer farm, and nearly all had to sell out. The idea that mexicans were disproportionally disposessed is absolutely, and totally ludricrous. Also that female farmers would share in the handouts is preposterous. Where would they come up with a significant number of these? Widows or divorsees possibly, and most all of these having sold out when they became unmarried. The real fact of life is nothing is permanent on this earth. How many families are still in the same line of work for generations, or even for their lifetimes? Just another whiney bunch of minorities with their begging cups looking for a handout from TAXPAYING CITIZENS. Enabled by the benevolent democrat marxist thieves on the left with their Robin Hood mentality. </p>

<p>At the very least, American Indians were displaced from their native lands. Why would you even consider a complaint from black and hispanic farmers who were given everything by the government and still receive everything from the govt. including loans I doubt a white person could get in  this &#8216;post-racial society&rsquo;.<br>
