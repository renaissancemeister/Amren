<h1>Sharpton to NNPA: Corporations &#8216;Owe&rsquo; Ad Dollars to Black Newspapers</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hazel Trice Edney, Savannah Tribune, June 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Activist Al Sharpton, keynote speaker at a kickoff prayer breakfast at the National Newspaper Publishers Associations 70th Anniversary Convention last week, warned the more than 215 Black publishers to stay in control of the definition of the Black struggle and to not back down from demanding their fair share of advertising dollars.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are meeting because the future of Black America is in this room,&#8221; he described the pivotal leadership of the Black Press. He frequently referred to NNPA Chairman Danny Bakewell of the Los Angeles Sentinel, a firebrand leader who has been demanding corporate and federal government fair share of ads for NNPA member papers.</p>
<p>Noting that &#8220;Danny preaches night and day&#8221; on behalf of this cause, Sharpton said corporate America must get the message that their businesses are indebted to Black newspapers.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re not giving us a hand-out. They are in our communities. They owe us in our communities. We have to stop going to these companies like they are doing you a favor to advertise in a market where the margin of their profit comes from in the first place.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The federal government, the Black President needs to be advertising with the Black Press. Otherwise what does it mean to us if we have Negroes in high places if those on the ground don&rsquo;t have anything,&#8221; he said. He added that in keeping the heat on advertisers, Black newspapers must adhere to their historic mission of defending Black people and defining the struggle for justice.</p>

		<p>And why should Barack Obama pay attention to you, Mr. Sharpton?  First, you didn&rsquo;t even consider him a real black, hence the whole &#8220;Barack the Magic N   &mdash;  - o&#8221; LA Times column and the subsequent Rush Limbaugh and Paul Shanklin song parody in 2007.  Second, Obama got virtually all of the black vote combined with a high black turnout in 2008, both primaries and general   &mdash;   they&rsquo;ll turn out just the same for him in 2012.  If anything, I disagree with Steve King on this one slight bit   &mdash;   Obama seems to be taking black voters for granted, because he can.  Almost everything he does or wants to do benefits one of the following constituencies:  Homosexuals, public employee unions, trial lawyers, abortionists and Hispanics.  </p>
<p>Also, why are we to think that people with money have some sort of &#8220;obligation&#8221; to newspapers (a dying medium regardless of race)?   Especially to black newspapers, free of charge (you get what you pay for), most of them sit in racks uncollected, (I guess people don&rsquo;t keep birds as pets like they used to), and the few that bother to read them are mostly dopey white liberals and the occasional white neo-con who is still searching for, as James Edwards calls it, the pot of black Republicans at the end of the rainbow.</p>

		<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve got news for brother Al. In North Carolina, the most non-mainstream media advertising dollars spent for State/Federal Public Works projects, public hearings and bidding is done in the Spanish language media.</p>

		<p>The original article has two telling quotes. The first is when Reverend Al says, &#8220;They owe us in our communities.&#8221; </p>
<p>Really? For what? It&rsquo;s classic black extortion/victim mentality. Just because papers like The Savannah Tribune cater to an audience that generally doesn&rsquo;t read anything and can&rsquo;t turn a profit they now have to demand that whites save the business. Al doesn&rsquo;t even bother to explain, nor does he have to, the reason for this money grab - it&rsquo;s just the way things are in America today. </p>
<p>Later, after spewing some biblical jargon to show just how serious he is, Al adds, &#8220;We started imitating the enemy instead of being who we are.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The enemy? Oh, that&rsquo;s white people. How gracious that Al, a man of God, feels that way, especially when demanding another handout to cover-up black failure.</p>

		<p>The internet will lead to most newspapers disappearing. To waste our tax $ propping them up  would be like Teddy Roosevelt bailing out the horse and buggy industry to protect them from automobiles.</p>
<p>Or trying to save icemen from losing business to the then-new refrigerator. </p>

		<p>Al &#8220;they owe us&#8221; Sharpton is still running true to form. His one mission on earth is to shake down white America. He and Jesse Jackson have devoted their lives to making white people pay for any real or imagined slights. He&rsquo;s a laughingstock, but is a past master of talking over people, never stopping nor ever saying anything of worth.</p>

		<p>Basic white business strategy: Create a decent product, such as a newspaper, and persuade others to spend their hard earned money on said product.</p>
<p>Basic black business strategy: Create an inferior product which nobody wants, then threaten lawsuits, boycotts and shakedowns to strong arm businesses and governments to keep you afloat long enough for you to loot assets before the house of cards collapses.</p>

		<p>What a bizarre sense of entitlement this man has. What do Newspapers &#8220;owe&#8221; blacks? &#8220;Owe&#8221; them for what? This comment makes no sense at all. Blacks are not forced to buy newspapers. As far as advertising goes, advertisers want as wide a market as possible. They will tend to place their advertisements in whatever papers have the widest distribution, irrespective of its racial demographics.</p>

		<p>It is unbelievable to me that this foolish buffoon still enjoys Protected and Exalted Status from the media and government and that statements such as this:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;corporate America must get the message that their businesses are indebted to Black newspapers!&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>go unchallenged.</p>
<p>Black newspapers will be &#8216;revitalized&rsquo; via the usual corporate shake-downs &#8220;keeping the heat on advertisers&#8221; combined with government bailouts:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Obama said that he will look at a news paper bailout, because otherwise, blogs will take over the world, and that would be a threat to democracy.</p>
<p>&#8216;I am concerned the direction of the news is all blogosphere, all opinions, with no serious fact-checking, no serious attempts to put stories in context&rsquo;&hellip;.</p>
<p>One of the bills is that of Senator Ben Cardin, who has introduced the &#8216;Newspaper Revitalization Act.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/mun33e" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/mun33e</a></p>
<p>&#8216;As if&rsquo; the propaganda media bother to fact check now, reporting isn&rsquo;t one-sided opinion passed off as fact, stories (such as black-on-White crime) are &#8216;put in context&rsquo;  &mdash;  context such as publishing Justice Dept. and FBI statistics on black crime.</p>
<p>Of course obama and his handlers want the media bailed out, they&rsquo;ve been his prime cheerleaders with nary a word of criticism (although I believe they are starting to turn on him).</p>
<p>Geitner will be instructed put the &#8216;pedal to the metal&rsquo; on the printing presses to run off more fiat currency to bail out the anti-White, dead-tree media, black or otherwise and $harpton will continue to shake down corporations, willing to pay large sums of money to get rid of him. </p>

		<p>I am a White American Christian. The &#8220;Reverend&#8221; Sharpton (like the &#8220;Reverends&#8221; Jesse Jackson and Martin Luther King, et al)never  &mdash;  and I mean NEVER  &mdash;  praises our Lord Jesus Christ. Black, black, black! That&rsquo;s all the clowns talk about. All of my favorite White Christian ministers talk often and boldly about our Lord, and they don&rsquo;t ever refer to themselves as &#8220;The Reverend &hellip; so and so&#8221;. A tree is known by its fruit. Sharpton&rsquo;s fruit is BLACK and rotten.</p>

		<p>Speaking about Black Newapapers, there is one in San Francisco named Bayview, and it is a doozy. It spends most of its print complaining about how downtrodden and opressed blacks are because of Whitey.It constantly praises the most vile, disgusting black racists and hate groups in existance.It says that the black thug who killed 4 Oakland police officers didnt do it!It ties to placate Whitey by praising a few white leftist Marxists.</p>

<p>It can only be explained by the cowering, cringing fear that they have of the black populace.  Anything to appease them!</p>
<p>When blacks get angry, they don&rsquo;t write lucid, carefully composed letters to newspaper editors.  They loot, shoot, and burn.</p>
<p>Evidently, that&rsquo;s what gets results.</p>
