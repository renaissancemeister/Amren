			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Simon Walters, Daily Mail (London), June 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Home Secretary Theresa May was accused last night of watering down a Tory pledge to bar immigrants unless they can speak good English.</p>
<p>The promise was a central part of David Cameron&rsquo;s Election campaign. But it has now been disclosed that the families of asylum seekers allowed to settle in the UK will be exempt from the ban.</p>
<p>Labour MPs said the Conservatives had been forced to drop their hardline stance by their Liberal Democrat Coalition partners who support uncontrolled immigration.</p>
<p>The move came on the eve of the launch of Britain&rsquo;s first-ever cap on immigration.</p>
<p>Mrs May will tomorrow disclose how a strict limit will be imposed on non-EU work permits.</p>
<p>Former Immigration Minister Phil Woolas said: &#8216;This ruling means that a British man who marries, say, a Brazilian girl who can&rsquo;t speak English will not be able to bring her into this country.</p>
<p>&#8216;But an Afghan who gets here on the back of a lorry and successfully claims asylum can bring his Afghan wife, children and grandparents in  &mdash;  even if they don&rsquo;t speak English.</p>
<p>&#8216;The Tories gave the impression that the English speaking test would apply to all immigrants.</p>
<p>&#8216;It is now clear that is not the case. It is absolutely essential that all immigrants speak English if they are to integrate with the rest of society. This is clear evidence that the Lib Dem tail is wagging the Conservative dog in this Coalition.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When Mr Cameron and Nick Clegg formed the Coalition, the Lib Dem leader agreed to drop his commitment to grant an amnesty to illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>However, a little-noticed Commons written reply last week said: &#8216;The new language requirement will not apply to dependants of refugees and people granted humanitarian protection in the UK.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Government granted the exemption after being warned that forcing refugees&rsquo; dependants to learn English breaks Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which gives everyone &#8216;the right to a family life&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Lawyers say a refugee could argue that as they cannot return to their country, they can gain their &#8216;right to family life&rsquo; only by having it allowed in the UK  &mdash;  whether or not they speak English. Britons whose foreign spouses cannot speak English could get their right by emigrating.</p>
<p>A Home Office spokesman said: &#8216;In compelling circumstances where a refusal of leave would amount to a breach of Article 8, we will consider granting discretionary leave outside the immigration rules.&rsquo;</p>
<p>About 20,000 people a year apply for asylum in Britain.<br>

		<p>Frankly, I never thought that David Cameron had any intention to crack down on immigration, even with very small, symbolic and ineffectual measures.  The coalition with the LDs gives him cover to dump it all, and do it quickly   &mdash;   which he would have done more gradually and piecemeal if the Tories won an absolute majority.</p>

		<p>&#8220;a refugee could argue that as they cannot return to their country, they can gain their &lsquo;right to family life&rsquo; only by having it allowed in the UK &mdash; whether or not they speak English. Britons whose foreign spouses cannot speak English could get their right by emigrating&#8221;</p>
<p>It is glaringly obvious that the Afghan &#8216;refugee&rsquo; can also get his &#8216;right to a family life&rsquo; by emigrating, but, as usual, British sovereign laws will be bent to accomodate him instead.</p>
<p>There is nothing stopping an asylum seeker in Britain from seeking a third country compatible with his language, creed, culture, and race.  </p>
<p>Britain need not be his final destination as a self-described &#8216;refugee&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>What if an Englishman or other native Briton is unable to obtain a wife in the United Kingdom? His only option is to use the services of a matchmaker that pairs Western men with foreign women, marry a foreign woman and bring her to his country.</p>
<p>As an American who couldn&rsquo;t obtain a wife in the United States, it was necessary for me to use the services of a foreign matchmaker, otherwise I would have remained single forever. I was paired with a wonderful woman, but she couldn&rsquo;t speak English; she could only speak Mandarin.</p>
<p>The matchmaking service was very expensive and covered a lot of things, including English language courses while we were waiting for her visa to process.</p>
<p>Would my wife&rsquo;s English skills at the time her visa finished processing be sufficient to pass the above-mentioned test? I don&rsquo;t think so. However, she&rsquo;s learned English quite well now that she&rsquo;s been in the US for a number of years and can speak it quite fluently.</p>
<p>How can British men in a similar predicament obtain wives with this new law?</p>
<p>If the British Conservative Party wants to limit immigration, why couldn&rsquo;t they just make a law placing limits on the number of immigrants allowed in the United Kingdom per year? National origin quotas probably wouldn&rsquo;t pass in the current political climate in Britain, but limiting numbers isn&rsquo;t unrealistic.</p>

		<p>Why should it be Britain&rsquo;s responsibility to take in 20,000 &#8220;refugees&#8221; a year? Why should the British be burdened with them?</p>

		<p>#4:  The real question is why should whites be required to look after the interests of other races and not be encouraged to have more white babies and encourage those that do live here to adopt our culture and laws instead of the reverse?</p>
