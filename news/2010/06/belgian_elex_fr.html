<h1>Belgian Elex Frontrunner Wants to Break Up Nation</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert Wielaard, Google News, June 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The frontrunner in Belgium&rsquo;s elections this weekend is running on perhaps the ultimate in divisive proposals: the breakup of the nation.</p>
<p>Despite its status as the home of the European Union, Belgium itself has long struggled with divisions between its 6 million Dutch-speakers and 4.5 million Francophones but until recently talk of a breakup has been limited to extremists.</p>
<p>Now, Bart De Wever of the centrist New Flemish Alliance is pressing for exactly that. What once seemed a preposterous fantasy of the political fringes has, in the mouth of a man seen as a possible prime minister, suddenly takes on an air of plausibility.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Carving up Belgium has been a cherished dream for the far-right in Flanders, Belgium&rsquo;s economically dominant north, and a nightmare scenario for poorer French-speaking Wallonia.</p>
<p>Flanders has half the unemployment of and a 25 percent higher per capita income than Wallonia, and Dutch-speakers have long complained that they are subsidizing the lives of their Francophone neighbors.</p>
<p>De Wever&rsquo;s party is forecast to win 26 percent of the vote  &mdash;  way up from 3.2 percent in 2007. That means his party will likely emerge as the biggest in parliament with the right to try to cobble together a coalition government. He will unlikely get other mainstream parties to vote for a Belgian breakup.</p>
<p>That is why he seeks no immediate split but advocates a gradual and orderly breakup of Belgium to punish Christian Democrats, Liberals and Socialists for three years of political gridlock that has prevented them from addressing Belgium&rsquo;s urgent economic woes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>De Wever wants Flanders and Wallonia to be fully responsible for their own economies and taxation but &#8220;we do not want to declare Flanders independent overnight.&#8221;</p>
<p>He speaks of a confederation  &mdash;  presumably resembling Serbia&rsquo;s ties with Montenegro  &mdash;  but was silent on the fate of the monarchy or the capital of Flanders. Today, overwhelmingly Francophone Brussels is the capital of both Belgium and Flanders.</p>
<p>An April study by French-language broadcaster RTL, showed the Flemish for change: 32 percent wanted outright independence, 17 percent a &#8220;confederation&#8221; with Wallonia  &mdash;  which would mean de facto independence  &mdash;  and 25 percent more self-rule within Belgium.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Belgium just about everything  &mdash;  from political parties to broadcasters to boy scouts and voting ballots  &mdash;  comes in Dutch- and French-speaking versions, leading to myriad and sometimes comical spats.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The only French-speaking party that wants Belgium to break up is the far-right  &mdash;  and tiny  &mdash;  National Front which wants Wallonia to join France.</p>
<p>The Belgian divide goes beyond language.</p>
<p>Flanders tends to be conservative and free-trade minded. Wallonia&rsquo;s long-dominant Socialists have a record of corruption and poor governance.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have become two different peoples,&#8221; explains Jean-Marie Dedecker, head of a Flemish party that bears his name. &#8220;We are socially and culturally divided. We don&rsquo;t read each other&rsquo;s newspapers. We don&rsquo;t watch each other&rsquo;s TV programs.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Complicating Belgium&rsquo;s linguistic puzzle is Brussels. The city is an enclave in Flanders, but overwhelmingly French-speaking, and for many embodies the political inefficiency that disturbs De Wever.</p>
<p>The bureaucracy-laden city offers jobs to almost 1,000 public office holders, hosts the national and Flemish governments as well as its own regional government and assembly, and has always remained an amalgam of 19 towns  &mdash;  boasting 19 mayors and 19 city councils.<br>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;but advocates a gradual and orderly breakup&hellip;&#8221;: This option is far better than Civil War or continued political gridlock.  The Czech Republic and Slovakia offer a decent example of ethnic separation done in a way that doesn&rsquo;t kill half the population.  With that in mind, we&rsquo;ll have our own choice to make in the not too distant future here in America.</p>

		<p>I can sort of sympathize with the Belgians&rsquo; plight   &mdash;   being locked in a forced marriage, as it were.</p>
<p>But at the same time, is this is a fatal diversion from their real problems?  The native whites are preoccupied with squabbling among themselves over a relatively minor issue such as language,  while at the same time they are being inundated by alien races, and nobody dares say a word or even notice it.  </p>
<p>What should be their real priorities?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not much different from Canada   &mdash;   bickering over English vs. French, while the whole Third World pours in upon them.<br>

		<p>I see this as more positive than negative as we Americans all well know that having white genes doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make one part of the team.  In fact, without adversarial whites our problems would be very swiftly put away from us.</p>
<p>Belgium seems to have this figured out.  The Northern half anyway.</p>

		<p>Belgium is an artificial, non-historic state created largely by Britain. It should be dissolved. The Francophones have allowed Flanders, and Brussels in particular, to be flodded with muslims from the Maghreb to put one over on their linguistic rivals the Flemings. It is a very short-sighted, cut off your nose to spite your face policy&hellip;.</p>

		<p>This might become interesting.</p>
<p>It is well to remember that Belgium was CREATED by the Brits for the sole purpose that neither the French nor the Germans might control the Schelde estuary. It has no nation-state tradition whatsoever (which made it a prime spot for EU headquarters in the first place).<br>
Of course, if they break up it will be a well-nigh declaration of bankruptcy of the EU (moving headquarters to Vienna or Prague might be more organic anyway).</p>
<p>As for their monarchy, I take the Fifth.</p>

		<p>I once watched a Belgian movie with English subtitles.  It was a murder mystery in which the cops had to move among those speaking both of the nation&rsquo;s languages.  Of course, it reminded me of the U.S. with its significant number of Spanish-only speakers.  Though the Belgian movie didn&rsquo;t seem to be trying to make this point, the burden of two official languages was overly obvious.  </p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Added to that is the snooty attitude of superiority of the French-speakers, which must be a pain for the Flemings to put up with.  But the Walloons are speaking French today only because of centuries  (a thousand years!) of French cultural encroachment.  </p>
<p>I read somewhere a Walloon&rsquo;s arrogant remark that he never bothered to learn any Flemish because there are no Flemish-speakers worth talking to.  That pretty sums up the attitude.  No wonder the Flemings want to get out of this shotgun marriage that Britain forced them into! </p>
<p>What must particularly burn the French is that the Flemish area is now the economic powerhouse of the country, and the French area is depressed. Formerly, it was the reverse and the French could feel smug and superior, but not so anymore.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the Moslems and Africans are rapidly overtaking them both   &mdash;  - while French and Flemish speakers bicker over deck chairs on the Titanic.</p>

		<p>As does many other media reports with all kinds of movements (but especially conservative ones), this article paints a picture that the desire and push for independence is primarily and foremost due to economic reasons and only the societal fringes would support it if it just wasn&rsquo;t espoused by a leading politician (even though they include a poll that declares a third of Flemish want outright independence while at least a total of 74% want some sort of separation from Wallonia). </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just like (authoritarian) leftist to believe economics is the basis for all human relations and social change only comes about through top-down influence and/or control. They just can&rsquo;t fully comprehend nationalism.</p>
<p>Not to mention, this orwellian writer describes the same movement as both &#8220;far-right&#8221; and &#8220;centrist.&#8221; I mean, how else would the innocent public know someone or something political is bad and should be avoided and shunned at all costs if it wasn&rsquo;t labeled as &#8220;far-right?&#8221;</p>
