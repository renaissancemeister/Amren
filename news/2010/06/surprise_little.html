<h1>Surprise! Little-Known Candidate Shakes Up SC Senate Primary, But Faces Obscenity Charge</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Meg Kinnard, Star Tribune (Minneapolis-St. Paul), June 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The night of his victory in South Carolina&rsquo;s Democratic primary, U.S. Senate candidate Alvin Greene didn&rsquo;t have much to say. Asked how he managed to defeat a four-term lawmaker who the party establishment figured would cruise to an easy win, the mysterious Greene had no insights.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Now, thanks to his shocking win, he has the attention of state and national Democrats who also found out he faces a felony obscenity charge. After The Associated Press reported that on Wednesday, the leader of the state Democratic party said she asked Greene to withdraw from the race against Republican U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint.</p>
<p>Greene refused.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Democratic Party has chosen their nominee, and we have to stand behind their choice,&#8221; Greene told an AP reporter at his Manning childhood home, which he shares with his father. &#8220;The people have spoken. We need to be pro-South Carolina, not anti-Greene.&#8221;</p>
<p>Greene, who did no fundraising and had no ads or website, had been considered such a long shot that neither his opponent nor the media bothered to check his background.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Charged with disseminating, procuring or promoting obscenity, Greene could face up to five years in prison. He has yet to enter a plea or be indicted.</p>
<p>{snip} The college student Greene was accused of showing the obscenty described the encounter to the AP.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said, &#8216;That&rsquo;s offensive,&rsquo; and he sat there laughing,&#8221; said Camille McCoy, a rising sophomore who said Greene sat down next to her in a computer lab and asked her to look at pornographic photos on his screen. &#8220;He said, &#8216;Let&rsquo;s go to your room now.&rsquo; It was kind of scary. He&rsquo;s a pretty big boy. He could&rsquo;ve overpowered me.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCoy called campus police and picked Greene out of a photo array. Greene has posted bond on the charge, which carries a punishment of up to five years in prison.</p>
<p>Refusing to discuss the pending charge, Greene says he&rsquo;s ready to get the message out about his platform, whose three main points  &mdash;  jobs, education and justice  &mdash;  were listed on a green campaign flyer he told a reporter he couldn&rsquo;t have because it was his only copy.</p>

		<p>The reason he won the primary is obvious   &mdash;   An overwhelmingly majority of SC Democrat voters are black.  In the deep South, black and Democrat are almost synonymous, and white and Republican are also synonymous.  </p>

		<p>This is too funny.  In SC the vast majority of Democrat voters are black and I guess in the age of Obama they decided to start backing their own from now on.  No matter the obscenity charges, that&rsquo;s just icing on the cake to them.  I hope this is a permanent trend all across the South as their beloved people turn against their White liberal charges effectively shutting the Party out of the South for years to come.</p>

		<p>A news story highlighting the hypersexualization of the blacks will soon disappear.  MSM won&rsquo;t allow their White viewers  much groveling in biased stereotypes against blacks.</p>
<p>Anything that portrays the blacks as something other than sweet, light filled angels will be banned.  Whites must constantly be kept thinking that anything causing them to see blacks as they really are is just the fault of White Racist Privilege.</p>
<p>Story soon gone.</p>

		<p>This guy is going to be a huge embarrassment to the Democratic party. I watched his first interview and I don&rsquo;t think he has an IQ higher than 75. I actually felt bad for the guy watching him shuffle about, clearly unaware of what he was involved in. </p>
<p>See the interview here:</p>

		<p>For anonymous, post #3.</p>
<p>The coed is probably white. It&rsquo;s less likely one of the sisters would run to the cops just because she viewed a little porn. And then her description of him being big and scary.</p>
<p>White college women are wildcards on how they might react to sexual situations. I mean, with all the feminist propaganda on campuses and feminism being a white luxury issue. Besides, Camille is usually a white name and McCoy is Scottish. At least this girl showed good sense. Maybe her dad even visits AmRen for all we know.</p>
<p>Assuming candidate Greene&rsquo;s election was legitimate, it still would never have happened if SC black population wasn&rsquo;t 30% or more. But liberal whites could have created a tipping effect even though their numbers are small. But then again, I could be underestimating the effects of northern influx.</p>

		<p>With examples like this I&rsquo;m wondering how White liberals will be able to maintain any kind of political power in a future minority majority multicultural &#8220;paradise&#8221;.  The majority of Democrats in the Southern states are black and in the age of Obama, blacks are becoming less content at voting for some  White liberal over their own in areas where their votes determine the outcome.  Hispanics vote along similiar lines and I would be willing to bet that orientals in places like San Francisco also adhere to these same patterns.  It used to be that money and fundraising weeded out the wannabe politicians from the serious players but I&rsquo;m happy to report that that wall has been breached in 21st century racial politics.   </p>

<p>I read an interview with her and while it didn&rsquo;t mention her race, it did point out that she was a Republican, so the odds are strongly against her being Black.</p>

		<p>This is an interesting trend in the democratic party.  For years they promoted identity politics and now it is destroying them.</p>
<p>They need all these groups to pull together under one banner in order to win elections.  But they are now showing a willingness to ONLY vote for their own.</p>
<p>Blacks voted this guy in the primary, refusing to vote for the white democrat who wasn&rsquo;t a total joke for the Senate.  Come the election, only blacks will vote for the democratic candidate.  Feminists, hispanics, gays, communists, jews and other identity groups will refuse, hoping to coerce the party into giving them a candidate from their group by withholding their vote.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about this is it will starkly contrast with the one reliable voting group that does NOT hold to identity politics (yet)&hellip;..whites.</p>

		<p>Re #7</p>
<p>The race weapon was just a cynical ploy when it was first used,  but  when the New Left took over Liberalism in the early 70s a racist hatred of whites became the central tenet of Liberalism.  It took until the 90s for this hatred to break out into the open, when the influence of the older Democrats began to fade.  <br>
Liberals don&rsquo;t care if they maintain power, they&rsquo;re cultural suicide bombers,  content to destroy themselves as long as they destroy hated white society at the same time.    They&rsquo;re not misguided, they understand that diversity is death for white America that&rsquo;s why they support it,  they don&rsquo;t care what comes after it.   Crook Republicans and Conservatives also understand it means the death of the Republic and the civilization, they believe what you believe about third world immigration, they&rsquo;re just in it for the money.  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s always been a mystery to me why the Democrats don&rsquo;t run part of every campaign from the state and federal prisons.  That way, they wouldn&rsquo;t have to wait until they were released to build up some name recognition, unless, of course, they were on the national news every night before they were caught and convicted.   </p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;ve already pressed many states to allow felons to vote.  If they can vote, surely they can run for office.</p>

		<p>Great North Woods #6: What happened to the Movement called &#8220;Christian Exodus&#8221; which called on Christians, predominately Fundementalist, or Charismatic, to move to the State of South Carolina, to reshape it into a Christian base, and support other Christian groups from their State?</p>
<p>According to their website, South Carolina was selected, due to its Christian heritage, and its long opposition to an overreaching Federal Government, as its history will show.</p>
<p>Christian Exodus started a few years back, about four years ago. I was interested to know about its progress in that State. Maybe someone on here, who lives in South Carolina can write about it, here.</p>

<p>This is the blowback from the Democrats idiotic Obama strategy&hellip;Blacks will not ever vote for a White candidate after a Black has been elected to high office.  I guarantee you the Republicans will win in every race where there is a Black candidate because they will always split the Democratic ticket&hellip;and from the example of Mr. Greene, there are very few Obama&rsquo;s out there (i.e. articulate, light-skinned, high IQ, etc&hellip;)<br>

<p>I live there and I have never heard of the movement. Also, I see when I come home how previously White S.C. cities are turning black, including my own. A new high school was build near my home a few years ago and during my time here in the middle east there have been 5 killings of White high school girls by their ADULT black boyfriends!!! A previously all white apartment housing complex was FORCED to allow  blacks who couldn&rsquo;t afford to live there in and the usual happened&hellip;SEC.8 housing, the murders, drugs, police sirens all the damn time!! my wife now allows me to keep loaded handguns in every room of the house.</p>
