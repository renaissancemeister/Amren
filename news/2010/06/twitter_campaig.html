<h1>Twitter Campaign Wants &#8216;Community&rsquo; Actor to Be First Non-White Spider-Man</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lindsay Robertson, Yahoo! Movies, June 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If thousands of Twitter users get their way, the star of Sony&rsquo;s upcoming reboot of the franchise will be Donald Glover, best known from his role on NBC&rsquo;s &#8220;Community.&#8221; This weekend the Twitter hashtag &#8220;donald4spiderman&#8221; became the #3 trending topic in the U.S., and the campaign is still gaining steam.</p>
<p>The origins of this latest attempt by social media users to influence casting decisions occurred last week. After surveying the five mostly unknown white actors said to be vying for the role, Marc Bernadin, a writer for the sci-fi site io9.com, called the choices &#8220;bland&#8221; and asked, &#8220;In this day and age, why does Spidey have to be a white guy?&#8221; In response, commenters threw out Donald Glover&rsquo;s name as a possible contender, and a Twitter campaign was born.</p>
<p>A unique aspect of this latest fan campaign is its wholehearted support by the subject in question. Glover seems to like the idea (though he makes it clear on his Twitter page that he&rsquo;s interested in auditioning, not just being handed the role without first having to prove his worthiness). While he had nothing to do with its inception, Glover himself has been promoting the campaign, instructing fans to tweet the #donald4spiderman hash tag at strategic times to keep it trending.</p>
<p>{snip} He and his fans will have to act fast, though: The Hollywood Reporter is already forecasting the five most likely contenders for the role, and Glover is not on the list</p>

		<p><i>&ldquo;In this day and age, why does Spidey have to be a white guy?&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Because the man who had the creative inspiration created a white Spider Man.</p>
<p>If any black person has the creative inspiration to create a universally likable and viable black super hero, I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t expect him to be transformed into a white super hero. </p>
<p>Leave my white icons alone.</p>
<p>While we&rsquo;re on the subjects of movies, I wanted to point out the now ubiquitous black stock character who is now a MUST in every film. He&rsquo;s the one I call, &#8220;Da Sassy Black Man&#8221;.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t watch movies much anymore but when I see commercials and trailers, the first thing that I ask myself is &#8216;who da sassy black man?&rsquo;</p>

<p>That last sentence pretty much says it all.  It sounds like Glover is building up this promotion of himself and then angling for a discrimination suit if things don&rsquo;t go his way.  A black Spiderman will be about as popular as Halle Berry was in &#8220;Catwoman&#8221;.  That movie still hasn&rsquo;t even recovered production costs yet. Of course, Beyonce Knowles is pressuring Warner Brothers and DC Comics to give her the role of Wonder Woman in the upcoming movie.  Hopefully they&rsquo;re holding off production long enough to wait for her to land a role in another box office bomb like &#8220;Obsessed II&#8221; and then give the role to another actress.  I saw a website where some fans of hers (no doubt she was behind it) were petitioning for her and Kanye West do a remake of that old detective show &#8220;Hart to Hart&#8221; because they would be the perfect couple.  Gimme a break.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s see&hellip;the Character of Spider man was conceived by whites, drawn by whites, as a white character, by a white founded comic book company, that was funded by white investors,..yeah, that&rsquo;s right, the character needs to be black! That&rsquo;s definitely too much whiteness going on there for our own good! </p>
<p>Besides, whites are too &#8220;bland&#8221;&hellip;after all, they created the &#8220;bland&#8221; character of Spider man&hellip;wait a minute, that didn&rsquo;t come out right&hellip;</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t many black academics make a career out of claiming European culture was stolen and appropriated from blacks? Am I mistaken in my perception that &#8216;multiculturalism&rsquo; is simply taking white culture and institutions and painting them black.</p>

		<p>Affirmative action and reverse racism at their finest (or worst, rather). &#8220;Why does Spidey have to be white?&#8221;, asks Marc Bernadin. Well, Marc, Spiderman has to be white because Spiderman is not a new character that was invented yesterday, he is a decades-old superhero who has been white for longer than you have been alive. If you really think that Spiderman should be black, then why don&rsquo;t we just let the Green lantern be portrayed as a white guy? In fact, the Passion of the Christ really should have cast Pacific Islanders for the part of Jesus. Shame on them.</p>

<p>Yet another example of blacks&rsquo; demanding to be let in on something whites created, rather than take the initiative to create something themselves. To put pen to paper and come up with their own black superhero would never occur to them. They&rsquo;d rather let us do the gruntwork, then swoop in at the last moment and grab all the glory of playing the lead. </p>

		<p>A few years back they re-did &#8220;The Wild Wild West&#8221; with Will Smith portraying James West. Now they&rsquo;re re-doing &#8220;The Karate Kid&#8221; with a black main character. Of course, if a White guy was cast as &#8220;Shaft&#8221; or &#8220;Superfly&#8221; you&rsquo;d hear most blacks (and many Whites) screaming that those are roles for blacks only. </p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t it funny how blacks are always accusing us of &#8216;stealing&rsquo; their artwork or entertainment?  When they say &#8220;black are better at basketball&#8221; I say, &#8216;It may appear that way and only in the US and it was a white man that created basketball.&rsquo;  Black privilege is what it is.  Nothing they&rsquo;ve achieved has been accomplished without white guilt and extortion.</p>

		<p>The black Green Lantern was created as an addition to the real Green Lantern, Hal Jordan, not by remaking the original as a colored person.  It makes me wonder why there are no blacks with any creativity in producing anything original instead of Whites having to blackface their own creations.  There&rsquo;s a dearth of black superheros out there and I imagine it probably has something to do with blacks not reading comic books.     </p>

		<p>Well, while we are at this, why not recast Fat Albert&rsquo;s Gang as all white.  OR the Cosby Show with all white cast?  This won&rsquo;t stop until there is a black superman, black batman and black robin, the boy wonder.  Oh, I forgot, if Robin is black it would be racist to call him the &#8220;Boy&#8221; Wonder.  Bogey and Bacall in Key Largo would be played by Morgan Freeman and Queen Latifah. (I just love old TCM movies).  Hey, how about an all black Brady Bunch?  Come on AmRen fans, help me out here.  I would like to see more bright ideas on how to recast all white movies with all black actors/actresses.  Of course this could go into cartoons as well.  Instead of the &#8220;Pink Panther&#8221;(one of my favorites as a kid), we would have the &#8220;Black Panther&#8221;.  Where will all this end.  Blacks cannot create their own heroes so they do in fact, steal(something they excel at)white ideas for heroes.</p>

		<p>The same things goes on in the music business. Some talentless rapper takes a classic white song (Forever Young by Alphaville or I&rsquo;ll be Watching you by the Police) and raps something over the beat. A real artist creates the entire song, not just take an existing song and shouts &#8221; Yeah&#8221; and &#8220;Uh-huh&#8221; over the track.<br>
