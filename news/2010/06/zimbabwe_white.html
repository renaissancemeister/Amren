			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Business Report, June 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A farmers&rsquo; organization says a new surge of violence erupted on 16 farms across Zimbabwe in the past week as loyalists of President Robert Mugabe try to seize more land.</p>
<p>The Commercial Farmers Union, representing some 300 white farmers still on their properties, says crops and equipment have been looted. In eastern Zimbabwe, a black farm foreman was beaten unconscious in the same Manicaland district a farmer&rsquo;s wife was barricaded into her homestead and given four hours to leave.</p>

		<p>What would happen if the remaining Rhodesians were to take airplanes to, say, Australia, claim refugee status and refuse to leave.  Would Australia treat white refugees as well as they do black or asiatic refugees?  Or would they forcibly deport them back to Zimbabwe to be killed?  How cruel would a white majority government be to white refugees?  It would be an interesting experiment into the mind of white elites and just how little loyalty they have left to their own kind.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Mugabe loyalists want more land.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, for certain they should get it.  Just look how they have made the country the farming capitol of the world.</p>
<p>And just look at all the blacks in power who have made such a roaring success of their countries in general.</p>
<p>Detroit will go down in the history books as the result of one more example of black genius, in spite of white racism and oppression.</p>
<p>Rumor has it that they&rsquo;re seriously thinking of building pyramids there also.</p>

		<p>It is astonishing to me that there are any whites left in Rhodesia. Much less the white farmers.</p>
<p>And a lot of those beaten, killed, robbed, intimidated have been black farm workers employed by whitey. Seems they suffer even worse than the whites.</p>
<p>Good old Robert. Like any other dictator, never satisfied with 99 %. Must have the 100 %. In decades to come, perhaps centuries to come, that part of Africa will slowly but surely revert back to nature and become as it was in olden times.</p>

<p>Except for black or hispanic dictators, I don&rsquo;t see that this is actually true. Stalin, Mussolini and Hitler had very little in the way of gigantic wealth (at least from what I have read). It appears to me that dictators, especially black dictators/presidents MUST be the big chief with all the bling that goes with that position. Unfortunatly, once an elected government position goes black, they will NEVER willingly give it back..there will be blood if the Obamaster is not re-elected or if any attempt is made to remove him from office.</p>

<p>It won&rsquo;t be like it was before, the blacks will turn it into a desert wasteland like they do nearer the Sahara. They don&rsquo;t know how to stop soil erosion and they don&rsquo;t know how to rotate crops, if they do indeed grow them. They will hunt wild game until none exists and they will destroy all animal and plant life and when it is all gone they will beg for food aid from Europe and America. This is the sorry situation of Africa and the reason why white South Africans, against the entire world, tried to implement the only solution they knew of. That was Apartheid.</p>
<p>Africa was a beautiful continent, but after being given to blacks with modern weapons of warfare it has be turned into a never ending war zone with no hope of ever returning to the beauty it once had.</p>

		<p>I am also wondering the same thing as poster #3.  Are there some who literally cannot read the writing on the wall.  I feel the remaining farmers should burn all their equipment (or sell it), burn their barns and homes and take a flight to anywhere but there.  Or organize a massive convoy and take everything they own to a more welcoming place.  I heard some other African countries want the white farmers.  But for God&rsquo;s sake, why stay where you are surely going to die a horrible death?</p>

		<p> &#8220;blacks with modern weapons of warfare it has be turned into a never ending war zone&#8221;</p>
<p>Your average AK sells on the international market for about $60. And ammo in abundance. These African &#8220;armies&#8221; don&rsquo;t even aim. They put the weapon on auto and just fire off endless thirty round bursts.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard some other African countries want the white farmers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mozambique. They made offers to Rhodesian farmers but since that time several years ago I have seen no reports.</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&rsquo;t be like it was before, the blacks will turn it into a desert wasteland like they do near the Sahara&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps the population will crash to such an extent that vast areas will be de-populated and nature will reclaim. This may have happened before. Dr. Livingston when he made his treks across Africa often commented about walking for days and not seeing any other people.</p>

		<p>I believe that these white farmers in Zimbabwe and South Africa love their homelands and want to stay and defend them.  Surely loyal Americans would do the same!  <br>
The only countries in central and southern Africa that have their heads above water are those where whites still have enough political and/or economic control to maintain resource distribution and at least a modicum of civil order.  Some are leasing farmlands to Afrikaaner and Chinese farmers.  The region will either develop a neo-colonial structure or become a wasteland.</p>
