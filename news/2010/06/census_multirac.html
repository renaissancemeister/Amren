<h1>Census: Multiracial US Becoming Even More Diverse</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hope Yen, Google News, June 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The nation&rsquo;s minority population is steadily rising and now makes up 35 percent of the United States, advancing an unmistakable trend that could make minorities the new American majority by midcentury.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Currently four states  &mdash;  Hawaii, New Mexico, California and Texas  &mdash;  as well as the District of Columbia have minority populations that exceeded 50 percent. That&rsquo;s one state more than in 2000, when Texas was not on the list.</p>
<p>About 311 of the 3,143 counties  &mdash;  one in 10  &mdash;  have minority populations of 50 percent or greater. That&rsquo;s up from around 250 counties in 2000.</p>
<p>The Census estimates released Thursday documented a widening age and race divide. They are the last government numbers before completion later this year of the 2010 census, which could change the balance of political power when legislative districts are redrawn based on population and racial diversity.</p>
<p>A key factor in the demographic transformation is aging baby boomers, a predominantly white group now shepherding college kids instead of starting young families. Since 2000, the number of whites under age 45 decreased by 8.4 million, while the number of whites over that age rose by 12.6 million.</p>
<p>The result is that the number of white younger adults and children fell in 42 states. Fifteen states, led by California, New York, Pennsylvania and Michigan, have lost more than 10 percent of their younger white population since 2000.</p>
<p>Locally, the changing race dynamics were widespread.</p>
<p>Seven U.S. counties last year saw their minority populations become the majority: Gwinnett County, Ga.; Titus and Victoria counties in Texas; Finney County, Kan.; Saguache County, Colo.; Contra Costa County, Calif.; and Yakima County, Wash.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Multiracial Americans, the fastest growing U.S. demographic group, are also adding to minority gains. About 5.3 million last year were identified as being of multiple race or ethnicity, up 3.2 percent from the previous year.</p>
<p>Among racial and ethnic groups, Hispanics grew by 3.1 percent to 48.4 million and Asians increased 2.5 percent to 13.7 million. They now represent about 15.8 percent and 4.5 percent of the U.S. population, respectively.</p>
<p>Blacks, who make up about 12.3 percent of the population, increased less than 1 percent last year to 37.7 million.</p>

		<p>Yes, but how many of the &#8220;minorities&#8221; are illegals or non-US citizens. I&rsquo;d say about half the &#8220;minorities&#8221; in this country are non-citizens. These are census &#8220;estimates&#8221;. They along with the media love to make Whites think it is all over. The truth is nobody knows what will happen by mid-century. It&rsquo;s impossible to predict. I predict the USA will collapse economically etc. long before then.</p>

		<p>Clearly California is trending downward in terms of economic strength.  I&rsquo;ve told numerous friends who were fretting about the AZ law that the California Governor&rsquo;s May revised budget bill might as well be termed the &#8220;Illegal Immigrant Removal Law of 2010.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reason is that no fewer than 2 million of the 3 million illegal aliens in California are utterly dependent on state and county spending in their behalf to make ends meet, without which they will be unable to stay in California.  And the Governor&rsquo;s May revised budget bill yanks that support away from them.</p>
<p>We are already at the point where there just isn&rsquo;t the money to continue California&rsquo;s generous support of illegal aliens so they&rsquo;ll be moving north to Oregon and east all over the nation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ironic but you can chart the decline of California&rsquo;s economic fortunes overall and see that the decline is in an inverse relationship with the increase in numbers of illegal aliens taking up residence.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think our economy will collapse, but without the means to pay for babies, medical care, food, and rent, they will be scattering out of California.</p>

		<p>The bad news is that White population statistics are being inflated with Persians, Arabs, North Africans and Central Asians.  Remember, the US Census says that Iranians, Saudis, Moroccans, Khazakistanis and Afghans are considered White.  The good news is that 75-78 percent of US CITIZENS are White.  That&rsquo;s a whole lot of house cleaning that needs to be done.  Deport all illegals, non-renewal of green card holders, H1B, TN1 and other work visas and remove all nonwhite foreign students and asylum seekers. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not 35% friends.  It&rsquo;s more like 40%.  We are about 60% of the population of this country now.  They&rsquo;re not including the 20-30 million illegal aliens when they state this.  The 12 million figure that the gov&rsquo;t gives us for illegal aliens is a con.  They&rsquo;re attempting to lull us into a false sense of security while our population (White population) dwindles.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think this list is correct. New York and Arizona are in the same category or are close? And this year Illinois too will become &#8220;majority minority&#8221;. I so do love that phrase. I wonder who thought that one up?</p>

		<p>So, it&rsquo;s not even a 2 to 1 White/non-White ration anymore.<br>
Clearly this implies that in many localities in the USA, Whites are already at minority status, and as a whole Whites are no more an overwhelming majority or even a noticeably big majority.<br>
  As recently as the 1960s and early 70s, Whites were around 90% of the American population.It is the sheer speed of change and the way the realtive proportions are being tipped over that is shocking.</p>

		<p>Are people walking around seriously thinking that there are more white people in the world than non-whites? There are more people in INDIA living without electricity than there are people living in the entire EU - that is just ONE country - greater population then all of the EU member nations combined.</p>
<p>The numbers are staggering yet people keep referring to whites as if we are some sort of overwhelming majority - it&rsquo;s just false and pure anti-white propaganda. </p>
<p>The same goes for the USA!</p>

		<p>Just some food for thought, an article I found today about ethnic rioting in Kyrgistan foreshadows Amerika in 2025.</p>
<p>OSH, Kyrgyzstan -Kyrgyzstan begged Russia for military help Saturday to quell ethnic rioting as the country&rsquo;s second largest city burned and thousands of minority Uzbeks fled to the border. More than 60 people were reported killed and nearly 850 wounded in the violence.</p>
<p>Interim President Roza Otunbayeva acknowledged that her government has lost control over the south as its main city of Osh slid further into chaos. Her government sent troops and armor into the city of 250,000, but they have failed to stop the rampage.</p>
<p>Much of central Osh was on fire Saturday, and the sky was black with smoke. Gangs of young Kyrgyz men armed with firearms and metal bars marched on minority Uzbek neighborhoods and set homes on fire. </p>
<p>Stores were looted and the city was running out of food.<br>
Thousands of terrified ethnic Uzbeks were rushing toward the nearby border with Uzbekistan. An Associated Press reporter at the border saw the bodies of children killed in the panicky stampede.</p>
<p>&#8220;The situation in the Osh region has spun out of control,&#8221; Otunbayeva told reporters. &#8220;Attempts to establish a dialogue have failed and fighting and rampages are continuing. We need outside forces to quell confrontation.&#8221;</p>

<p>No, 75-78 % of US citizes are caucasians. Whites are a subgroup of the much bigger caucasian group which includes huge numbers of non whites. A more realistic estimate is that about 50% of the US population is white. By 2030 it should be very obvious that whites are a minority in the US. By 2050, if the current projections hold, whites will be about 20-25% of the total US population. </p>

		<p>The parameters of a holocaust.   The crooks at the head of the Republican Party and the conservative movement have conditioned their followers to believe that people are nothing more than interchangeable economic units, but when these third-worlders start getting political power the Republican idiots who allowed their leaders to collaborate in genocide by colonialism are in for a rude surprise.  The Alvin Greene story in S.C and this story - </p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/36e2xay" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/36e2xay</a></p>
<p>are good indicators of just what sort of government we will have.  Gone will be their beloved military might, their freedoms,  voyages to the moon, etc.   Creedal nation has come a cropper. </p>
<p>Somewhat in the same vein,  the Chinese must have a hard time not to laugh in the face of American officials who gave as an example of American wrongdoing the immigration law passed in Arizona.   Can you imagine what they thought about public officials who are embarrassed about controlling their own borders and apologetic about possessing their own territory?   Who are embarrassed that  foreigners don&rsquo;t get preferential treatment in their country?  It&rsquo;s said that the Chinese used to refer to Bill Clinton as &#8220;The Traitor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes.  And for the same reason:  &#8216;Diversity is Strength&rsquo; is a lie.</p>
<p>During the time of the Old Soviet Union, the Kremlin sat on Russia and the Eastern Bloc countries under its &#8216;influence&rsquo; like a lid on a pressure cooker.</p>
<p>When the unworkable, statist Soviet economy finally imploded and the Kremlin fell, ethnic/religious warfare erupted all across Eastern Europe  &mdash;  all of it brutal, as it will be here when the same set of conditions implodes.</p>
<p>California will lead the way, as it always does, as California&rsquo;s massive welfare-state economy is collapsing.  We are the Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain (PIGS) of the US.<br>
 <br>
Freshly-printed stimulus or bailout (or whatever the hell the government is calling it these days)  money is only a band-aide solution, the real problem (as in the EU) is this: </p>
<p>Socialism doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union was a brutal, authoritarian police state  &mdash;  the ONLY outcome possible when ethnic/racial/religious groups are forced by the government to live with one another in what the media, academia and government tell us will be a peaceful, multicultural utopia.  Brutal government force is needed to suppress those who refuse or don&rsquo;t believe in living with or supporting those unlike themselves  &mdash;  which is the vast majority of humankind.  </p>
<p>And, as did the Old Soviet Bosses, the hypocritical elites in the US hold themselves separate from the peaceful, egalitarian society they force on us lowly kulaks.</p>
<p>And, as in the old USSR, the creation of  a mult-culti workers&rsquo; paradise is NOT the main goal of the current US regime; the main goal is complete, brutal power via the creation of an authoritarian, police-state government.</p>
<p>That old tired cliche from George Santayana, &ldquo;Those who refuse to learn from history are condemned to repeat it&#8221; is certainly apt in this case.</p>
<p>We even know the outcome of the failed utopian paradise: 62 million dead, as in the old USSR.</p>
<p>Professor Rummel writes in Death by Government:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Probably 61,911,000 people, 54,769,000 of them citizens, were murdered by the Communist Party  &mdash;  the government  &mdash;  of the Soviet Union. </p>
<p>Old and young, healthy and sick, men and women, and even infants and infirm, were killed in cold-blood. They were not combatants in civil war or rebellions, they were not criminals. Indeed, nearly all were guilty of &hellip; nothing.</p>
<p>The citizens of democracies are the least likely to be murdered by their own governments; the citizens of totalitarian, especially Marxist systems, the most likely. This has been confirmed by systematic, empirical tests&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/ybs26hz" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/ybs26hz</a></p>
<p>A brutal Marxist government is the &#8216;hope&rsquo; and &#8216;change&rsquo; promised by the obama regime.</p>

<p>Actually, this is true. Get rid of all the illegals, all 30 or so million of them, do away with all these green card holders and the percentage of Whites goes up hugely.</p>

		<p>Complacency has resulted in a situation where a majority of Americans don&rsquo;t vote.  Now that we have still another waffling President and a Congress that won&rsquo;t act against a rampant invasion of illegals, people can hardly continue to believe everything is hunky-dory.</p>

<p>  Yes, the velocity of the change has been astonishing! If Obama&rsquo;s shamnasty (Comprehensive Immigration Reform) should be passed, this will accelerate the process even faster. It is entirely possible that a new North American Brazil will debut before the second half of this century. In other words, poverty stricken non white immigrants will emigrate from Latin America to Latin America. </p>

<p><br>
It&rsquo;s not THAT bad &hellip; It&rsquo;s hard to find the stats, but I have over the last few years&hellip; </p>
<p>People of (almost all or all) Middle Eastern/North African/West Asian descent are around 1-1.5% of the WHOLE U.S. population (2/3 of whom are &#8220;Christians&#8221; and most are from the Levant region meaning they&rsquo;re not reproducing like the Muslims in Western Europe and a good chunk of them could fool even some of you to pass for &#8220;White&#8221; [which says something about their racial ancestry]). Those numbers don&rsquo;t include people of (almost all or all) Judaic descent (Jews and non-religious &#8220;Jews&#8221; alike) who account for around 2% of the WHOLE U.S. population.</p>
<p>This translates that the &#8220;White&#8221; population, where &#8220;White&#8221; are all people of direct (almost all or all) (indigenous) European (the &#8220;continent&#8221;) descent, is now hovering at 62%.</p>
<p>Although, the 62% U.S. &#8220;White&#8221; figure also includes a lot of people of (indigenous) European descent that aren&rsquo;t so &#8220;White&#8221; like many Southern Italians (the largest of these type of ethnic groups in Europe and ancestry groups in the U.S. by far) or some Castilians (the main ethnic group of Spain, also known as Spaniards [but they&rsquo;re tallied as &#8220;Hispanic/Latino&#8221; on the U.S. Census anyway, and the vast majority of emigrants from Spain {as well as Portugal} went to Latin America over the last centuries of European immigration/emigration {depending where you are} on top of that]).</p>
<p>(I define the term &#8220;racially &#8216;White&rsquo;&#8221; basically as anyone a typical &#8220;White&#8221; &#8220;American&#8221; of today would identify as &#8220;White,&#8221; racially speaking, based on phenotype alone as well as those whom I consider &#8220;White,&#8221; racially speaking, based both on phenotype and genotype. I believe those two definitions for the same term I typed out to be one and the same stated two different ways.)</p>
<p>Knowing these facts, one could estimate that the European &#8220;Caucasian(?)&#8221; population in the U.S. of 62% balances out at that figure as the racially &#8220;White&#8221; population in the U.S. when you (numerically) swap (around 1.5-3% of the WHOLE U.S. population) those persons in the U.S. of not so &#8220;White&#8221; (indigenous) European descent for those in the U.S. (supposedly definitely not &#8220;White&#8221;) people of Middle Eastern/North African/West Asian descent like many Turks (from Turkey at least), some Arabs (mostly Levant &#8220;Arabs&#8221;), most (true/&#8221;pure&#8221;) Berbers, many &#8220;Jews&#8221; (almost all Ashkenazi Jews, many Sephardic Jews, etc.), etc. who are racially &#8220;White&#8221; (not just &#8220;Caucasian&#8221; as some would claim) and even (to varying degrees) &#8220;Whiter&#8221; than those persons of European descent for who they&rsquo;d be swapped but are now officially labeled or considered as &#8220;White&#8221; partly because their ancestors more contemporarily came from the European side of the Mediterranean (as if sea-faring in the area and accompanying genetic swapping and settlement didn&rsquo;t happen in a semi-large scale for antiquity and later and/or similar human evolutionary pattens couldn&rsquo;t happen in the same Mediterranean climate zone that exists on most sides of that sea); (not to mention, Georgians and Armenians are geographically outside Europe [directly south of the Caucasus, which is the southern land border of the continent of Europe], but are definitely European/&#8221;White&#8221; culturally and racially by our [including the U.S. Census] and their definitions.)</p>
<p>BUT WAIT! It gets a little brighter for us. That 62% figure as racially &#8220;White&#8221; &#8220;America&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t even include the millions (yes, millions) of &#8220;Hispanics/Latinos&#8221; who are truly &#8220;White&#8221; by OUR standards, not Latin America&rsquo;s standards (so I&rsquo;m not including any of those near-&#8220;White&#8221; &#8220;Latinos/as&#8221; that think they&rsquo;re &#8220;White&#8221; too). (If you live in much of the Southwest U.S. or certain parts of the Chicago or Bo-Wash Megalopolis area, etc. that may be hard to believe, but take a trip to South Florida and you&rsquo;ll more likely see what I&rsquo;m pointing out.) <br>
Approximately 48% of people who &#8220;ethnically&#8221; self-identified as &#8220;Hispanic/Latino&#8221; also &#8220;racially&#8221; self-identified as &#8220;White&#8221; on the (2000) U.S. Census (yes, officially &#8220;ethnicity&#8221; and &#8220;race&#8221; are 2 different things as well as sections/questions on the U.S. Census where you can mix and match identity like that ever since 1977); (coincidentally, another approximately 48% of people who &#8220;ethnically&#8221; self-identified as &#8220;Hispanic/Latino&#8221; also &#8220;racially&#8221; self-identified as &#8220;Some other race&#8221; on the (2000) U.S. Census [probably Mestizos, Mulattos, etc.].) Those self-identified &#8220;Hispanic White&#8221; millions (around 17 million then) make-up about 6% of the WHOLE U.S. population (cut out from the WHOLE U.S. &#8220;Hispanic/Latino&#8221; population, which is approximately 12.5% of the WHOLE U.S. population [back in 2000 according to that year&rsquo;s U.S. Census]); of course, those self-identified &#8220;Hispanic White&#8221; millions probably include over a majority of near-&#8220;Whites,&#8221; so I&rsquo;d calculate that fairly around 1/3-2/5 of these self-identified &#8220;Hispanic Whites&#8221; pass for OUR standard of &#8220;White.&#8221; This translates to roughly 2%-under 3% of the WHOLE U.S. population and under 1/6-1/3 of the WHOLE U.S. &#8220;Hispanic/Latino&#8221; population or approximately 5 1/2-8 1/2 million as of 2000). Extrapolating those figures&rsquo; most likely fate forward 10 years, with birth and immigration rates close to other &#8220;Whites&#8221; but being outpaced by the (truly) non-&#8220;White&#8221; &#8220;Hispanics/Latinos,&#8221; the racially &#8220;White&#8221; population in the U.S. now actually is in fact SLIGHTLY UNDER 65%.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the racially mixed population can now self-identify per the U.S. Census (1997 and on) and social tastes have changed towards accepting (even desiring) them so that whatever the figure is probably includes everybody who actually is significantly racially mixed, so it&rsquo;s not necessary to estimate and deduct their lot from (especially) the &#8220;White&#8221; U.S. population like before the 2000 U.S. Census; one last thing, when a person has parents where one is &#8220;non-Hispanic White&#8221; (U.S. Census category) and another any racial category &#8220;Hispanic/Latino,&#8221; their marking on the U.S. Census labels them (given the set up) as a &#8220;Hispanic/Latino&#8221; (albeit a &#8220;White&#8221; one) but not mixed race (despite whatever is their genetic reality), so given the hypo-descent rule, the U.S. total &#8220;Hispanic/Latino&#8221; population may have more racial &#8220;Whites&#8221; than where I noted above (due to my calculations being based on racial &#8220;Whites&#8221; descended only from Latin America [i.e. indirectly {almost all or all} from Europe]) because after all a racially &#8220;White&#8221; and near-&#8220;White&#8221; (probably the most likely combination [not Mestizo]) couple produce offspring almost as &#8220;White&#8221; as some racial &#8220;Whites&#8221; in the U.S. let alone the offspring of &#8220;non-Hispanic Whites&#8221; and &#8220;White&#8221; &#8220;Hispanics/Latinos.&#8221; </p>
<p>In short, in terms of groups in the U.S., the &#8220;non-Hispanic White&#8221; population minus people of Middle Eastern/North African/West Asian descent minus people of (indigenous) European descent that aren&rsquo;t so &#8220;White&#8221; plus racially &#8220;White&#8221; Middle Eastern/North African/West Asian people plus racially &#8220;White&#8221; &#8220;Hispanics/Latinos&#8221; plus the &#8220;non-Hispanic White&#8221; mixed with near-&#8220;White&#8221; &#8220;Hispanic/Latino&#8221; and &#8220;non-Hispanic White&#8221; mixed with racially &#8220;White&#8221; &#8220;Hispanic/Latino&#8221; offspring equals the total racially &#8220;White&#8221; population or 65% - (3-3.5%) - ((1.5-3%) + (1.5-3%)) + (2%-under 3%) + (less than or equal to 1%) approximately = 65% or approximately (in millions) 201.5 - (9.3-10.85) - ((4.65-9.3) + (4.65-9.3)) + (6.2-under 9.1) + (less than or equal to 3.1) approximately = 201.5.  </p>
<p>2009-2010 TOTAL RACIALLY &#8220;WHITE&#8221; POPULATION OF THE U.S: APPROXIMATELY 65% OR 201.5 MILLION OUT OF A TOTAL (LEGAL) U.S. POPULATION OF 310 MILLION.</p>

		<p>Self identification is not a reliable method of asserting whiteness. Argentina is 90% white by self assertion but 40% white by genetics. In Latin America they have this reverse Jim Crow rule whereby anyone having a drop of white blood considers themselves white. I would be very, very wary of Latin Americans claiming they are white. </p>
<p><br>
BTW, I cant understand why you consider people from the Levant or Lebanon white, their minds are like Arabs no matter how they look. Judging by the mestizos between local swede and middle easterners I have met, white mental traits are recessive. <br>
These specimens were mentally very similar to a typical middle easterner and not at all like a typical swede.  </p>
<p>BTW, Southern Europeans are generally mestizos in varying degrees between real whites and Mediterranean non white Caucasians. Its no coincidence Greece, Italy, Spain etc are so dysfunctional by northern European standards. Tiny northern Italy is pulling the rest of Italy behind itself because of racial reasons - the people there are closer genetically to Germans than the people of southern Italy, who are of ancient Mediterranean stock and more closely related to Greeks and Lebanese than Germans. </p>

		<p>I know I wrote a great deal with varying points jumbled together, but you may want to read a little closer my section on Hispanics in the U.S.<br>
I cut my number for the (truly/actual) racially White Hispanics OUT from the self-identified White Hispanics giving me a number close to your example on Argentina coincidentally; in other words, I claimed less than about 40% of the Hispanics who also self-identified as White, which was 48% of ALL U.S. Hispanics making my (40%) number less than 20% of ALL U.S. Hispanics, were actually White by OUR standards and added THAT (20%) number to the total of Whites in the U.S.</p>
<p>You are probably right about the recessivity of White mental abilities though. <br>
I&rsquo;ve witnessed some of what you&rsquo;re talking about first hand as far as average White and Middle Eastern genetics getting mixed together goes, but I would also argue that race isn&rsquo;t EVERYTHING (as important as it is apparently) and culture matters too.<br>
The half Middle Eastern (Christian Arab) half European (Basque) mixed people I know well seem to act and think more like the culture they were raised in (Latin America) and are more intelligent and compassionate than what I&rsquo;ve witnessed from the Arabo-Islamic Middle East; although, those cultures are all more or less Mediterranean extractions, and as far as the individuals I&rsquo;m talking about goes, their propensity for discipline/self-control does seem to be semi-lacking (on top of which it seems to be predictably graded by intensity according to sex/gender and skin tone) or at least not on par with Northern European extractions, but that sounds like Latin America to me anyhow.</p>

		<p>To poster #18, I also am amazed by the lack of whiteness in the southern Euro zone.  I have met many Greeks in my time, and only a few look white.  Most of the rest look a lot like Turks, Arabs, etc&hellip; probably due to centuries of mixing.</p>
<p>The most famous mosaic portrait of Alexander the Great done by someone who saw him clearly shows he was white with brown/blond hair.</p>
<p>The Greeks had been mixing with middle easterners for a couple of centuries before his time, but it really took off with the conquest of Persia and the Middle East.  His successors had four states that had the result of mixing a lot of non-greek blood into their nations&rsquo; lines.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve met a lot of southern Italians and Sicilians in my time also and some of them are as brown as a standard brown Mexican.  It&rsquo;s uncanny how people call them white.  Northern Italians are mainly Germanic due to the Lombards, et al settling there.</p>

<p>  It was good to hear that I&rsquo;m a mestizo at least to a &#8220;degree&#8221;. Maybe, the Mexicans will accept me now. I wonder if I qualify for Affirmative Action. Alas, I look in the mirror and I still see a Gringo or partially? White person  &mdash;   at least I&rsquo;m White down here in Dixie. One thing for sure, I won&rsquo;t qualify for the SS Totenkopf Division.</p>

<p>The problem with the Census is that it allows people to choose their race through self-identification.  I do not believe that 48 percent of Hispanics are White.  Check out the Census for California:</p>
<p>https://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/06000.html</p>
<p>White population 76.6 percent.  Do you honestly believe that?  Virtually all the Hispanic population was dumped into the White category.  Census statistics are flawed or worse, fraudulent and misleading.  I&rsquo;d say the White Hispanic population is alot lower than reported.  I&rsquo;ve been to Southern Florida and it doesn&rsquo;t give me a warm and fuzzy feeling.  Very little of our White Hispanic population comes from Europe but from South America.  Their culture is Latin American not Spanish and Cubans have an Afro-Carribbean element in theirs.  Latin American culture does not appear to assimilate to Anglo-Saxon norms.  There&rsquo;s massive crime in Southern Florida and White flight.  I sold my house in Leesburg which is in Central Florida, to a couple from South Florida before I moved out of the state.  </p>
<p>The non-Hispanic White European population is about 60 percent.  When the results of the 2010 Census comes out it will be around 56-57 percent.  That of course depends on how many aliens came into the country, how many illegals were deported and how many were prevented from taking their place.  We can restore a healthy demographic balance by removing all illegals and green card holders.  Once that&rsquo;s achieved we could offer financial incentives for the rest to leave.  Those that are left behind, well, we can make it very uncomfortable for them to live here.</p>

		<p>What people are missing here are actual citizens. The census counts everyone living here, illegals and others, not just citizens. Only citizens should be counted. The percentage of actual citizens I&rsquo;d estimate is around 80% White. The rest are illegals or Mexicans who are here legally but not citizens. There numbers are in the millions. Same goes for Indians and Asians and those here on long term visas or H1bs. If you don&rsquo;t count all these, the numbers of Whites go up hugely. The problem is if Whites sit back and do nothing, then all these illegals and legals will stay here permanantly, then the numbers of non-Whites will grow hugely. The question is what will Whites do?</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no need for crass comments linking Northern Europeans to Nazism.  </p>
<p>North and South Europe look different and have different histories.  It&rsquo;s as simple as that.  No need to go further.</p>
