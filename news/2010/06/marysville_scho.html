			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kirk Boxleitner, Marysville Globe (Washington), June 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Marysville School District Board member&rsquo;s e-mails drew condemnation and inspired vigorous debates on racial issues during the Board&rsquo;s regular June 7 meeting.</p>
<p>Board member Chris Nation was criticized by Lillian Ortiz-Self, chair of the state Commission on Hispanic Affairs, for addressing the ethnic academic achievement gap &#8220;as merely a poverty issue,&#8221; in her words. However, Ortiz-Self joined Janice Greene, president of the Snohomish County branch of the NAACP, in devoting the majority of their expressed concerns to the words of Board member Michael Kundu for his suggestions that academic potential could be rooted in genetics.</p>
<p>In an e-mail dated June 3 that Kundu sent to Nation and Kyle Kinoshita, executive director of teaching and learning for the Marysville School District, Kundu cited the work of John Philippe Rushton, a psychology professor at the University of Western Ontario in Canada, as evidence that certain ethnic groups possess biological advantages and disadvantages compared to others, in areas including brain sizes and intelligence levels.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think what is safe to draw from this is that there is a definitive factor played by racial genetics in intellectual achievement, but we, as a society, are striving to offset that foundation by increasing educational and social opportunities to &#8216;offset&rsquo; the racial achievement gap,&#8221; Kundu wrote in the e-mail, whose subject line was &#8220;race and achievement (please circulate).&#8221;</p>
<p>Ortiz-Self asserted that Rushton&rsquo;s study was &#8220;not only discriminatory but resembles white supremacist ideology that takes us back to the time of segregation.&#8221; Speaking on behalf of the NAACP, Greene deemed Kundu&rsquo;s remarks &#8220;offensive, not in accord with the mainstream of modern U.S. society, and certainly not in the equitable interest of all Marysville School District students.&#8221; Greene went on to declare that Rushton &#8220;is a known white supremacist and that his pseudo-scientific theory has been effectively and consistently debunked by well regarded scientists.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ortiz-Self and Greene were not alone in their testimony. They were joined by enough speakers from the audience to help extend the Board&rsquo;s meeting until nearly 11 p.m., almost four and a half hours after it had started. Ben Young read a letter written by Kinuko Noborikawa, chair of the Communities of Color Coalition, who could not attend the Board meeting. Noborikawa&rsquo;s letter likewise expressed &#8220;grave concern&#8221; regarding Kundu&rsquo;s citations of Rushton and quoted the conclusions of 2002 Washington State School Director&rsquo;s Association President Connie Fletcher, who argued that allocations of resources should be based not on equal measurements, but on the degree of need of each student.</p>
<p>&#8220;Students are educated to the level that the community allows,&#8221; said Oscar Eason Jr., state conference president of the NAACP. &#8220;Messages like this are damaging to youth because they place in the minds of teachers the idea that these kids are incapable of learning, so they just keep getting passed on to the next grade, because they&rsquo;re never expected to succeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kundu likewise emphasized that he doesn&rsquo;t consider biology to be the only cause of the achievement gap, but even as he acknowledged Rushton&rsquo;s racism, he defended genetics as one of a number of possible influences, along with a student&rsquo;s family dynamics and relative economic prosperity.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s behind the achievement gap,&#8221; Kundu said. &#8220;If we did, every school district would be making significant progress in correcting it. No one has the formula for it. A lot of people have elements of the formula, but this achievement gap has been around for decades. I&rsquo;m saying almost precisely the same things as a lot of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Board President Sherri Crenshaw confessed her frustration with what she went &#8220;out of my way not to say was underlying racism,&#8221; even as she pointed to the disproportionate number of Native Americans in special education in the school district, as well as the disproportionate percentages of minority students in the Marysville School District who are failing to meet reading and math standards, when compared to both their white peers in the school district and the state averages for those minority groups.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I was offended,&#8221; Crenshaw said after reading the e-mail aloud. &#8220;I think it&rsquo;s racist. I saw it as my responsibility to speak up and let you know that people who are making decisions about your children could be this ignorant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marysville School District Superintendent Dr. Larry Nyland freely admitted that not all of the school district&rsquo;s students are being reached, but he pledged his &#8220;personal commitment to seeing every student of color succeed.&#8221; To that end, he suggested that one goal might be to increase the number of students of color in AP classes.<br>

The above is a curious statement. So he is saying that blacks are uneducated because the black community does not allow them higher ed? </p>
<p>The correct statement would read &#8216;intellectual achievements rise to the level that genetics allow&rsquo;</p>

		<p>In an effort to raise my White IQ and widen the intractable Achievement Gap, I&rsquo;ve been reading Rosalie Gordon&rsquo;s Nine Men Against America.  (And I watched Glenn Beck all the way through today because he seemed to have momentarily overcome his weakness for praising MLK and America&rsquo;s black &#8220;founders&#8221;.)</p>
<p><br>
Gordon&rsquo;s great book gave me an insight into Plessey&rsquo;s Separate but Equal.</p>
<p>When we return to sanity after going bankrupt trying to close the Achievement Gap by turning Africans from the jungle into Europeans from the Alps, a feat not even the Lord your God ever attempted, we may be tempted by the Separate but Equal doctrine again.</p>
<p>But we must modify it to its more natural meaning.</p>
<p>Equal will not then mean equally funded facilities. Equal funding puts a greater and unequal burden on Whites to fund the poor blacks.  </p>
<p>Equality then will mean that each community has equal chance to fund their schools according to their ability.  No unequal distribution.  No White money for black schools, no black money for White schools, nor black employees at White schools.</p>
<p>Separate AND equal.  Equal in funding opportunity, not equal funding.</p>
<p>Got it?   You&rsquo;ll need it, because you know what&rsquo;s coming your way.</p>

<p>Funny how I always read a sentence like this whenever Rushton or &#8220;The Bell Curve&#8221; comes up in the lamestream media, but I have NEVER seen a link or citation to these supposed &#8220;debunkings&#8221;.  As we know, these &#8220;debunkings&#8221; almost certainly do not even exist at all, or if they do, they are full of emotional appeals and very little hard facts.</p>

		<p>We all know perfectly well what&rsquo;s behind &#8220;the achievement gap.&#8221;  The only remarkable thing about this burn-the-witch episode is that someone actually had the nerve to bring up the-truth-that-dare-not-speak-its-name at all.

<p>Racism is the belief that (a) race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and (b) that racial differences result in the superiority of a PARTICULAR race.</p>
<p>Facts aren&rsquo;t racist, and neither is Prof. Rushton for simply stating the facts as he has observed them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Racist&#8221; is a smear that is used to silence whites without having to mount a logical argument.  It&rsquo;s used so frequently because it has worked like a charm for the past few decades.  Whites who retreat when it is used on them just get more of the same.</p>
<p>Whites who have backbones and stand their ground (which has a factual basis) can, when smeared, challenge accusers to demonstrate how they are factually incorrect.  That usually ends things since lefties aren&rsquo;t accustomed for forming logical arguments.</p>
<p>One is not racist because one recognizes that race is real and the races not NOT equal in their aptitudes and abilities.  Never let this smear be hung around your neck.  ALWAYS have your facts straight and NEVER back down.<br>

		<p>I have read the brilliant work of Dr. Rushton and many of his colleagues for years. His work has a strong basis in facts and truth. To my knowledge, his detractors have never successfully disproven his findings. </p>
<p>In fact, I have been waiting for years for several of my Liberal friends in academia to produce evidence that any of Dr. Rushton&rsquo;s findings are in error. Thus far, they have been unsuccessful. They best they can do is level empty charges of &#8220;racism&#8221;.</p>
<p>My friends, the egalitarian worldview is more like a cult religion rather than an illegitimate political view. Suggesting to these people that the genetic differences between the races plays a crucial role in intelligence, behavior, and outcomes is little more than racial blasphemy in their eyes. There is simply no reasoning with the egalitarian mind. </p>
<p>As we have repeatedly read, even when they are repeatedly raped, assaulted, and killed by those they defend, they never abandon their misguided and disturbing views. Many of them would literally rather die than abandon the cult religion of egalitarianism. Indeed, many of them have died or suffered worse horrors.</p>

		<p>Memorable insider perspective below by a teacher in the Oakland (CA) system in response to a San Francisco Chronicle report on the perennial &#8220;achievement gap&#8221; illustrates the &#8220;best practices&#8221; of our government schooling industry in response to the challenge: </p>
<p>&#8220;As a long-term veteran teacher of the Oakland schools, I can only say that I completely dread the likely professional development which is surely to come, in which white teachers will again be told how culturally insensitive we are and how we fail at teaching. I have been hearing this (it&rsquo;s nothing new) for my entire tenure of nearly two decades in the district. I have been called a racist for every imaginable reason&hellip;except actual racism. Both black parents and students assume racism on the part of white teachers, and it&rsquo;s up to you to prove otherwise. Meanwhile, if I try to address issues such as absenteeism, illiteracy, or failure to do homework, I am taken to task by students and their families. The real story that should be investigated is the endless racism TOWARDS white teachers in the schools. Almost every white teacher in Oakland has been subjected to treatment that would be headline news if it were black teachers being treated this way. Welcome to OUSD!.&#8221; <br>

		<p> Did anyone but NAACP mouthpieces get to speak at this meeting? And why, when J. Philippe Rushton&rsquo;s research and conclusions are still hanging there like an unanswered question, was a speaker allowed to say his research has been &#8220;effectively and consistently debunked,&#8221; without anyone rising to point out that she was simply WRONG?</p>
<p> &#8220;Students of color,&#8221; to use the current trendy phrase, namely blacks and Indians, consistently fail to measure up academically. And that is always assumed to be the fault of &#8220;privileged White people,&#8221; or &#8220;White racism,&#8221; or some other such shibboleth.</p>
<p> Let&rsquo;s use Occam&rsquo;s Razor to cut through all this baloney: Rushton and those who agree with him on race, are definitely onto something. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that Whites are better than blacks (the most glaring example) at everything: Look at professional sports, which are now heavily black in this country. But it DOES mean that there is a racial pyramid in IQ averages in this world, with Ashkenazi Jews and East Asians at the top, White Americans and Europeans a little farther down, and Sub-Saharan Africans way at the bottom.</p>
<p> And speaking of Asians, why don&rsquo;t these &#8220;people of color&#8221; comparisons with White academic achievement (with the darker people&rsquo;s lesser achievements the fault of Whites, of course) ever include a sampling of Chinese, Japanese and Korean students living in this country? Because that would knock the whole &#8220;Whitey&rsquo;s fault&#8221; theory into a cocked hat, of course.</p>

		<p>Good Lord so we have a STATE Commission on Hispanic Affairs?  Suppose that has something to do with why we have ferry boats with hulls so weak you can punch holes through the rust&hellip;&hellip;.. </p>
<p>All this in a small town that in 2000 was over 88 percent white.  You can bet your bottom dollar that a good majority of the people getting up on the cross over this &#8220;ignorant racism&#8221; are going home and telling their own kids the exact same thing.  One face in public, another in private.  It&rsquo;s hard to see how we could ever form any kind of alliance with these spineless people.</p>
<p>I get up to the Snohomish County fairly often as I have family that lives right inside the next county over.  It&rsquo;s mostly rural, and one of the great meth capitals of America.  Mainly either well-to-do whites or dirt-poor whites, not much in between, except for the ubiquitous ever-growing Hispanic population.  Farmers and folks that work at the Boeing plant in Everett.  Very little in the way of middle class outside of Everett.  </p>
<p>Guess which group is providing the hand-wringers that are shocked, SHOCKED at these racist ideas permeating the school board?  The lower class working people?  Or the union drones that experience a good deal of &#8220;sensitivity training&#8221; as a perk of their employment at the Lazy B?</p>
<p>How does this kind of nonsense prevail in an 88 percent white community?  It has to make the majority of people sick, yet they sit and take it and pray for forgiveness at the altar of diversity anyway.  When will whites realize that the NAACP and Commission on Hispanic Affairs only have this power over us because we grant it to them?</p>
<p>TAKE IT AWAY.</p>

		<p>Homo neanderthalensis &amp; Homo sapiens interbreeding produced the Caucasian and Mongoloid races.</p>
<p>Green et al in the 7 May 2010 issue of Science published &ldquo;The Neandertal Genome&rdquo;.  </p>
<p>They concluded that people from Eurasia and Oceania trace their ancestry to a small population of modern humans that left Africa 50,000-60,000 years ago and their descendants today share between 1 and 4% of the genomes derived from Neandertals.  </p>
<p>The Neandertal genome in question is associated with genes involved in metabolism and in cognitive and skeletal development.</p>
<p>Homo sapiens that remained in Africa do not share the Neandertal genomes.</p>
<p>The authors report, &ldquo;Implications for modern human origins. One model for modern human origins suggests that all present-day humans trace all their ancestry back to a small African population that expanded and replaced archaic forms of humans without admixture. Our analysis of the Neandertal genome may not be compatible with this view because Neandertals are on average closer to individuals in Eurasia than to individuals in Africa. Furthermore, individuals in Eurasia today carry regions in their genome that are closely related to those in Neandertals and distant from other present-day humans. The data suggest that between 1 and 4% of the genomes of people in Eurasia are derived from Neandertals. Thus, while the Neandertal genome presents a challenge to the simplest version of an &#8220;out-of-Africa&#8221; model for modern human origins, it continues to support the view that the vast majority of genetic variants that exist at appreciable frequencies outside Africa came from Africa with the spread of anatomically modern humans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The team reports &ldquo;Neandertals, the closest evolutionary relatives of present-day humans, lived in large parts of Europe and western Asia before disappearing 30,000 years ago. We present a draft sequence of the Neandertal genome composed of more than 4 billion nucleotides from three individuals. Comparisons of the Neandertal genome to the genomes of five present-day humans from different parts of the world identify a number of genomic regions that may have been affected by positive selection in ancestral modern humans, including genes involved in metabolism and in cognitive and skeletal development. We show that Neandertals shared more genetic variants with present-day humans in Eurasia than with present-day humans in sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting that gene flow from Neandertals into the ancestors of non-Africans occurred before the divergence of Eurasian groups from each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The range of Homo neanderthalensis extended as far south as the modern day Suez Canal, the northern extent of Homo sapiens at that contemporary time.</p>
<p>Pure conjecture is that Homo neanderthalensis could have blocked movement of Homo sapiens out of Africa until interbreeding between the two occurred and produced a viable hybrid that became the Caucasian and Mongoloid races that we know today.  </p>
<p>That viable hybrid could have resulted from advantages associated with genes for metabolism, cognitive, and skeletal development reported by the authors of the paper.</p>

		<p>Here again we see that few people dare to accept that genetics are the basis of intelligence.  They likely fear that they themselves will be revealed as inferior in a very meaningful way.</p>
<p>I know a lot of White people who behave like this.  </p>
<p>They think that just because they want equality to be true means it is true.</p>
<p>They practice &#8220;feel good&#8221; science and thus can never arrive at an accurate explanation for the achievement gap because they  always deny genetics as a major cause of intelligence.</p>
<p>It will take men with the courage to face their own inferiority to get honest research done on genetics and exactly how they influence intelligence.</p>
<p>We need a Galileo of genetics to stand up to the Church of Equality and tell them the earth is not flat.</p>

		<p>If I say &#8220;2 + 2 = 5&#8221; does Mary correct me by shouting &#8220;racist&#8221; or does she show me how 2 + 2 actually totals 4?  Of course she shows me how 2 + 2 actually equals 4.</p>
<p>If I say &#8220;There is a genetic component to persistent black underachievement&#8221; Mary doesn&rsquo;t correct me by presenting facts, she merely shouts &#8220;racist&#8221;.  Why?  Because she has no factual argument to bolster her claim of racial genetic intellectual equality.</p>
<p>My mother always said only an ignorant man curses because he can not express himself any other way.  The people who shout racist are basically ignorant because they have no real argument.  They just keep coming up with newer and more convoluted excuses.  The ancients were actually able to use some pretty convoluted mathematical equations to accurately predict the movements of the planets based on an earth-centric universe.  But they were still ultimately wrong.<br>

		<p>Notice how nobody except the local press cares that someone raised the issue of race, genetics and IQ.  A huge difference from a few years ago when such a thing would have been national headlines.</p>
<p>That fact is far more important than anything going on in Marysville.  The race card no longer works.  Only a matter of time before people figure this out (and act on it).</p>

<p>Yeah, right. Just like the theories of Copernicus and Galileo were debunked by the Flat Earth Society. </p>

		<p>One man speaks a very dangerous (albeit screamingly evident) truth, and a hideous, ironic parade of ad hominem attacks spew forth&hellip;hours and hours. <br>
This is NO DIFFERENT than what liberals like to refer to as the bad old days of religious thought control and intellectual boondage.<br>
Liberals are the new inquisitors, the new witch burners, the new oppressors.<br>
There is no hope for ressurecting the West, it is DEAD, for these jellyfish and their brown footsoldiers are too many in number.</p>

		<p>Whenever I hear someone saying that Rushton has been debunked, I always ask the question; What should be done assuming Rushton is correct? Everyone knows this would be a huge problem. Whites could segregate based on race. Government would feel no need to equalize outcomes. Blacks would feel inferior and whites superior. The social impact would be immense. Racial equality activists would lose their jobs. So there&rsquo;s no surprise that they won&rsquo;t respond to Rushton&rsquo;s challenge honestly. </p>

		<p>Wayne Eagle #11, I agree that, overall, the racial IQ statistics you point out are correct.  However, I want to add that EU studies have shown that some European nations have average IQ&rsquo;s that are above the 104 usually quoted for Japanese, Chinese, and Koreans.  While British (and American) IQ&rsquo;s are put at the &#8220;base&#8221; average of 100, some countries have numbers higher than 104 (at least according to the EU study).  Germany and Holland average at about 108, with Poland and Italy a point or two behind respectively.  And, if we removed the lower Arabic IQ that probably influenced these national studies, how much higher might the numbers be? (Judophobes sometimes use Israel&rsquo;s high 90&rsquo;s numbers to prove Jewish inferiority, but not only Jews live there!)  It has always seemed obvious to me that Jews (average 115!) are the world&rsquo;s smartest, and that Germans are mighty brainy too.  </p>

		<p> Isn&rsquo;t it interesting that Neo-Marxist charlatans are given thunderous approval on campus, while Dr. John Philippe Rushton must be escorted by campus security or private guards for every campus speaking engagement? Why are racial topics forbidden by our liberal inquisition? Why are our privileged elites so frightened of truth seekers?</p>

		<p>Rushton has been debunked?  Really?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see who debunked him.  A peer-reviewed article, perhaps.  What&rsquo;s that?  You can&rsquo;t tell me who debunked him or even cite the publication in which he was debunked?  Somehow, I&rsquo;m not surprised. </p>
<p>What they mean by &#8220;debunked&#8221; is that people shouted &#8216;RACIST&rsquo; and considered the argument won when their debating opponents didn&rsquo;t bother to respond to their unique brand of idiocy.</p>

<p>It amuses me how blacks use the word &#8220;ignorant&#8221; to describe anything they don&rsquo;t like, or any person they disagree with. That&rsquo;s just a misuse of a fairly simple word.   And mis-using words demonstrates what&hellip;?</p>

		<p>The &#8220;achievement gap&#8221; of which we speak and which consumes the government schooling industry   &mdash;  - at all levels   &mdash;  - is below defined by Education Trust for the National Governors Association:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the time [minority students] reach grade 12, if they do so at all, minority students are about four years behind other young people. Indeed, 17 year-old African American and Latino students have skills in English, mathematics and science similar to those of 13-year-old white students.&rdquo; (Closing the Achievement Gap, National Governors Association Clearinghouse, 2002, 9th paragraph) http://www.subnet.nga.org/educlear/achievement/index.html</p>

		<p>Whenever those that challenge the clear evidence that the races are unequal, their only means of attack is to scream about racism. If all the races are equal, then it shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard to find one example where people from multiple races all perform equally on a cognitive test. So where is it? Where&rsquo;s the proof? If all the races have equal ability, then there should be mountains of evidence showing so, but what do all test show instead? A consistent hierarchy with Blacks scoring at the bottom, Hispanics and AmerIndians next, Whites higher than them and east Asians a bit higher still. This pattern is so consistent that it might as well be a fundamental law of psychometrics. </p>

		<p>The problem is that there are always some 3rd rate researchers/professors who want to advance their mediocre careers and will come out and claim for some media outlet that the Rushton-like research if greatly flawed and (naturally unchallenged) instantly become darlings of the PC world, get quoted and maybe invited to give funded talks here and there. If you try to defend the real research you get branded a racist and your career is damaged or even ended. Who will want to further the IQ research under these conditions? No wonder most people are ignorant of the truth. </p>

		<p>Ortiz-Self said that Rushton&rsquo;s study &#8220;resembles white supremacist ideology &#8221; and Greene said that he&rsquo;s &#8220;a known white supremacist.&#8221; Excuse me, but how can someone who claims that Asians have (on average) higher IQs, are less fertile and less agressive than whites be a &#8220;white supremacist?!&#8221; Once again, the hysterical leftists who are obsessed with the dogma of egalitarianism can only resort to name calling as a means of discrediting their opponenets. Greene also made the flagrently false accuasation that Rushton&rsquo;s &#8220;pseudo-scientific theory has been effectively and consistently debunked by well regarded scientists.&#8221; Oh really? What about the Nobel prize winning geneticist James Watson who said that we should not expect that populations which have been seperated geographically should have evolved equal powers of reason. What about scientist Steven Pinker of Harvard University who also accepts the possibility that intelligence may in fact differ between groups. I can just imagine the meltdown these idelogues would have if science suddenly proved that Rushton&rsquo;s theories are indeed true. </p>
