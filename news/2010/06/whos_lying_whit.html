			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chip Reid, CBS News, June 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It started last week when Republican Sen. Jon Kyl said at a town hall in Tempe, Ariz. that during a recent private meeting in the Oval Office the president said: &#8220;The problem is, if we secure the border, then you all won&rsquo;t have any reason to support &#8216;comprehensive immigration reform.&rsquo;&#8221; In other words, Kyl said, the president is holding border security hostage to comprehensive reform.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I asked Deputy Press Secretary Bill Burton (subbing for Robert Gibbs) about it today at the briefing. &#8220;Kyl knows the president didn&rsquo;t say that,&#8221; Burton said. He would not say exactly what it was the president DID say (Burton said he was not present at the meeting), and he deflected a question about whether Kyl lied.</p>
<p>Afterward Kyl&rsquo;s office said the senator is sticking to his guns.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t believe you anymore than I would John McCain on Border Security in Arizona. You didn&rsquo;t say &#8220;boo&#8221; during EIGHT years of George W Bush&rsquo;s treasonous behavior on Border Security.</p>
<p>Now that the &#8220;Decider&#8221; is gone, you no longer have to dance to his tune.</p>

		<p> Who&rsquo;s lying? I&rsquo;ll give you three guesses, and the first two don&rsquo;t count.</p>
<p> Is there an Oval Office taping system? Well, of course every president since Nixon has sworn that, No, no, a thousand times no, there is no taping system! But if you were president, and you sometimes had one-on-one conversations with people in the Oval Office, no stenographers or aides present, now wouldn&rsquo;t you want some kind of a record of what was said   &mdash;   especially if it was one that the other party didn&rsquo;t know about? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be the prudent thing to do   &mdash;   albeit rather sneaky   &mdash;   in case of just such a thing happening as has just occurred with Sen. Kyl?</p>
<p> To sum up: Yes, I think Barack Obama is lying; yes, I think there is a taping system; no, I don&rsquo;t think anyone in the White House would admit it even under pain of thumbscrews and the rack.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Who&rsquo;s Lying? White House Denies Kyl&rsquo;s Immigration Story&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, sure, Kyl is going to dream up stories about this corrupt administration.</p>
<p>What is unbelievable to me is that CBS actually asks the questions as if we don&rsquo;t know the answer.</p>
<p>Every decision this community organizer makes is based on whether or not it is favorable for blacks and/or whether it reduces the white power base.</p>
<p>Both Bush and Obama seem to believe that there is no concern at all of a terrorist attack that could be traced to the open southern border.  They&rsquo;re both lucky none has occurred yet. If one occurs, however,  this black child will be impeached.  But, of course, the hearings will have to be held at the golf course or the basketball court or he won&rsquo;t appear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m beginning to think these jihadists are just too stupid to contrive a plan of action quite frankly, because they could finish off what is left of the US economy and send us into deep depression if even a minor attack or two were to occur. We&rsquo;re lucky we&rsquo;ve got an enemy that is dumber than the present administration&hellip;.and the last one as well. </p>

		<p>Depending on the poll, somewhere between 50 and 85% of adult American Citizens don&rsquo;t want aminsty for the illegal invaiders.  The majority of Americans want their jobs and salaries back, they want to stop paying high taxes to educate and support perpetually poor Mexians, and they want the job-theifs to return to their own country.</p>
<p>But the Democrats don&rsquo;t care what the American people want.  The Democrats want more minority voters, and they will pursue that corrupt policy, even if it fills our cities with massive angry foreign overpopulation, destroys our ecology, education system and social structure, and bankrupts our nation.  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s official: Obama is against securing the border, and he&rsquo;s against it for political gain.</p>
<p>What would follow securing the border would be the depopulation of illegals trespassing in the United States.</p>
<p>As ICE rounds them up and deports them by the millions, amnesty would become unthinkable.</p>
<p>Amnesty is a carrot Obama keeps Hispanic voters chasing. To the Hispanic voter, the Dems want to be the &#8220;party of amnesty&#8221;, not the &#8220;party of deportations&#8221;.</p>
<p>The time for fence sitting is over. This is the wedge issue dividing the country, and Obama is being forced to reveal what kind of man he is.<br>

		<p>Contemporary ethics begets nasty abuse.  In modern society it is considered rude to call someone a liar.  Instead of complementing the rule by not not lying, the behavior seems to go in the other direction.  You cannot call someone a liar, therefore lie more.  You&rsquo;ll suffer no punishment and your accusers will be the ones cited.  We are in deep trouble. </p>

<p>Of course he is, just as expected!</p>
<p>I hope all the white fools and traitors that voted for this &ldquo;transcendent&rdquo; multicultural abomination, remember their idiotic euphoria of self-hate in about 5 to 10 years from now, and it keeps them warm and fed at night. The reality of the situation is that the Utopian States of America is about to collapse and a mulatto &ldquo;savior&rdquo; is not only presiding over it, but hastening it. Everything he tries to do to avoid it, just blows up in his arrogantly incompetent face like some Bolshevik bomb. That is because he is so wedded to his Red ideology, that he plants those bombs there himself in the first place and then smugly denies that anything popped, let alone went exploded.</p>
<p>Aided and abetted by the Marxstream Media, he always manages to keep us from seeing him wipe the dirt and dust from his face; well, that is at least what they believe and want the rest of to reciprocate.</p>
<p>Did you plug the hole yet, daddy?</p>

		<p>In a sense, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what did Obama say. Even if he wanted to, he would not be able to enforce the border. Just look at his performance, for instance, how he deals with the oil spill crisis. His wining personality makes him good at talking but not at problem solving. Dr. Rushton researched this trait thoroughly.<br>

		<p>President Obama is the Chief Executive, i.e. the head of the executive branch of the federal government.  It is not his position to formulate policy; that is the function of the legislative branch of government.  As the Chief Executive, it is President Obama&rsquo;s obligation to implement the policies of the legislature, regardless of his personal disposition in that regard; it is not his function to promulgate legislation.</p>
<p>The laws regarding immigration are on the books.  Those laws are simple and clear and do not lend themselves to political posturing.  A lawful and orderly implementation of those laws is all President Obama need do, nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p>Do it, Mr. President.</p>

		<p>Kyl is more believable than Obama, but I agree that all these incumbent Republicans who followed along with the pro-illegal immigration agenda of George W. Bush and Karl Rove deserve little respect.  The Democrats want to make millions of illegal Hispanic, Haitian, and African immigrants citizens for one reason:  To lock in a Democratic majority.  The country be damned.</p>

		<p>The leadership of both major parties is fiddling while Rome burns.  Both want to juggle Hispanic and non-Hispanic votes, hoping that they lose neither.  Meanwhile, illegals are spreading all over the nation, bringing welfare depletion, crime, and disease in their wake.  </p>

<p>Obama is, as every AR reader naturally knows, a Socialist at heart   &mdash;   but of course a major politician in the US can&rsquo;t use the word &#8220;socialist&#8221; so Obama publicly positions himself as a &#8220;liberal&#8221; (and runs as a Democrat, rather than some unelectable far-left 3rd Party fringe candidate).</p>
<p>Obama is also, as every AR reader also naturally knows, an multicultural open-borders Internationalist at heart   &mdash;   but of course a major politician in the US can&rsquo;t use the words &#8220;open-borders&#8221; or &#8220;Internationalist,&#8221; so Obama poses as an American and claims to have an interest in border security. </p>
<p>This two-faced approach by which Obama hides his radical intentions been mainstream has been his strategy ever since launching his political career at Billy the Bomber&rsquo;s house back in the &rsquo;90s. The key to this strategy&rsquo;s success is that Obama and his co-conspirators is that they must NEVER own up to their radicalism. They must maintain the facade of &#8220;reasonableness&#8221; and &#8220;acceptable discourse&#8221; AT ALL TIMES. </p>
<p>And most of the time, he pulls off this obfuscation campaign quite well   &mdash;   so well that it&rsquo;s taken him all the way to the White House! But every once in a while, Obama lets something revealing slip when he should have kept his mouth shut. His famous &#8220;oratorical genius&#8221; (yeah, right) lets him down. It&rsquo;s a kind of ideological version of a Freudian Slip. </p>
<p>One such incident was in late &#8216;08 when Joe The Plumber forced Obama to admit to a collectivist &#8220;spread the wealth&#8221; philosophy. </p>
<p>Big mistake, Barry.</p>
<p>Another such mistake seems to have happened with Sen. Kyl over the amnistying of Undocumented Democrats. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the president&rsquo;s latest goof-up wasn&rsquo;t caught on tape   &mdash;   and so its very existence will be endlessly disputed, with the MSM (of course) taking Obama&rsquo;s side in the matter. </p>
<p>As other posters have noted, Sen. Kyl isn&rsquo;t the most sympathetic or likable of Republicans for those of an AmRen persuasion. But he&rsquo;s infinitely more believable than Obama! </p>
<p>What we have here is a rare glimpse into the true feelings of B. Hussein Obama. And it only confirms what his most &#8220;extreme right-wing&#8221; opponents are always saying about him. </p>
<p>&hellip;Which only goes to show that those who criticize Obama most harshly are the most likely to be proven correct. </p>

		<p>I still say the easiest way out for Obama and indeed whoever or whatever is controlling this farce*, is to say: &#8220;Go for it!&#8221;</p>
<p>And let each state enact legislation which, in and of itself, invites Congressional if not Constitutional review.  Throw in some sad sack lies-damn-lies-and-statistics reports of the construction and service industry down-turns in the wake of a &#8216;major labor shortage&rsquo; and you will see Democrats fighting Republicans over _who&rsquo;s first_ to craft legislation that essentially overturns or supercedes whatever the States do locally.</p>
<p>Proving once again the dominance of Federalism.</p>
<p>Of course, the Dems will take hits in the Hispanic community but what are the latter gonna do, vote Republican?  Please, half the Hispanics out there don&rsquo;t vote, even in states like California where they have huge numbers yet a low turnout cost them a couple of crucial seats in the State Senate and LA City Council.</p>
<p>If you screw them over, they will hunker down and adopt a wait and see attitude and those facing elections after this November will all be sure to go whichever way the wind blows in damning or praising them.</p>
