			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Alderson, London Telegraph, June 26, 2010\</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The official figures, which examine the ethnicity of those accused of violent offences in London, suggest the majority of men held responsible by police for gun crimes, robberies and street crimes are black.</p>
<p>Black men are also disproportionately the victims of violent crime in the capital.</p>
<p>The statistics, released by the Metropolitan Police, permit an informed debate on a sensitive subject for the first time.</p>
<p>One prominent black politician said that the black community needed to face up to major challenges.</p>
<p>Shaun Bailey, a Tory election candidate in London and a charity worker, said: &#8220;The black community has to look at itself and say that, at the end of the day, these figures suggest we are heavily  &mdash;  not casually  &mdash;  involved in violent crime. We are also involved in crime against ourselves  &mdash;  and we regularly attack each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>The data provide a breakdown of the ethnicity of the 18,091 men and boys who police took action against for a range of violent and sexual offences in London in 2009-10.</p>
<p>They show that among those proceeded against for street crimes, 54 per cent were black; for robbery, 59 per cent; and for gun crimes, 67 per cent. Street crimes include muggings, assault with intent to rob and snatching property.</p>
<p>Just over 12 per cent of London&rsquo;s 7.5 million population is black, including those of mixed black and white parentage, while 69 per cent is white, according to the Office for National Statistics.</p>
<p>The police figures also show that black men are twice as likely to be victims. They made up 29 per cent of the male victims of gun crime and 24 per cent of the male victims of knife crime.</p>
<p>The Met declined to comment on the statistics. However, some officers will see them as a justification for Operation Trident, a unit targeting black-on-black murder and violent crime.</p>
<p>Others will see it as justification for targeting a disproportionate number of black men under stop and search powers. Figures released annually have shown black people are at least six times more likely to be stopped and searched than their white counterparts.</p>
<p>On sex offences, black men made up 32 per cent of male suspects proceeded against, and white men 49 per cent. The statistics also suggest that black women are responsible for a disproportionate amount of violent crime committed by females.</p>
<p>Richard Garside, of the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies at King&rsquo;s College London, said: &#8220;Given Britain&rsquo;s long history of racism and imperialism it should not greatly surprise us that black and minority ethnic groups are disproportionately members of social classes that have tended to experience greater victimisation and to be the subject of police attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just because the police treat black men as more criminal than white men, it does not mean that they are.&#8221; Simon Woolley, speaking as the director of the Operation Black Vote pressure group, but who is also a commissioner on the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said: &#8220;Although the charge rates for some criminal acts amongst black men are high, black people are more than twice as likely to have their cases dismissed, suggesting unfairness in the system.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Sunday Telegraph obtained the figures via a Freedom of Information request after Rod Liddle, the writer, caused controversy last year when he claimed in an online blog published on The Spectator website that &#8220;the overwhelming majority of street crime, knife crime, gun crime, robbery and crimes of sexual violence in London is carried out by young men from the African-Caribbean community&#8221;.</p>
<p>The comments led to claims that Mr Liddle was racist, However, Mr Liddle said: &#8220;I cannot think of anything more vile than racism. The issue here is not racism, it is one of multiculturalism.&#8221;</p>
<p>The statistics suggest that Mr Liddle was largely right on some of his claims  &mdash;  notably those on gun crimes, robberies and street crimes.</p>
<p>The figures suggest, however, that he was probably wrong on his claims about knife crimes and violent sex crimes.</p>
<p>The figures relate to those &#8220;proceeded against&#8221;.</p>
<p>This includes those prosecuted in court, whether convicted or acquitted; those issued with a caution, warning or penalty notice; those the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to charge; and those whose crimes were &#8220;taken into consideration&#8221; after a further offence.</p>
<p>Unsolved crimes are not included.</p>
<p>The figures do not take into account that any one perpetrator may have committed numerous offences .<br>

		<p>This is truly a shocker.  I thought it was only in the US, the Caribbean, Brazil, Haiti, the DR, and everywhere in sub-Sahara Africa that blacks committed the majority of crimes.</p>
<p>This problem is much worse that I&rsquo;d thought.</p>

		<p><i>On sex offences, black men made up 32 per cent of male suspects proceeded against, and white men 49 per cent.</i></p>
<p>49 plus 32 is 81.  Who is responsible for the other 19%?</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Just because the police treat black men as more criminal than white men, it does not mean that they are.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Well, there is one simple way to find out:  Do an FBI-style crime victimization survey.  If the race stats of crime victims have differences from the race stats of arrests/convictions that is statistically insignificant, as Jared Taylor finds that the FBI UCR and the NCVS are consistently, then that&rsquo;s not the case   &mdash;   blacks really are that criminal.</p>
<p><i>Simon Woolley, speaking as the director of the Operation Black Vote pressure group, but who is also a commissioner on the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said: &ldquo;Although the charge rates for some criminal acts amongst black men are high, black people are more than twice as likely to have their cases dismissed, suggesting unfairness in the system.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean anything.  There are a lot of black Americans who have their cases dismissed, and it might be higher than the white percentage of the same.  But it might be because of incompetent prosecutors, uncooperative witnesses, legal technicalities, worries about black jury nullificiation making attempts at prosecution futile, etc.  Depends on British jurisprudence whether my theories are right or wrong.</p>

<p><i>&#8220;They show that among those proceeded against for street crimes, 54 per cent were black; for robbery, 59 per cent; and for gun crimes, 67 per cent. Street crimes include muggings, assault with intent to rob and snatching property.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>And yet on the other hand:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;I cannot think of anything more vile than racism.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t burn me   &mdash;   I&rsquo;m not a witch!</p>

<p>Unsolved crimes are not included.</p>
<p>The figures do not take into account that any one perpetrator may have committed numerous offences.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, then, Andrew Alderson&hellip; Since you&rsquo;re so certain that the figures cited are incorrect, what are the <i>correct</i> figures?  Or didn&rsquo;t you think it was necessary to research such embarrassing data?</p>
<p>The usual &#8220;keep your eye on the little ball&#8221; misdirection to keep the masses from getting any disquieting thoughts about the wisdom of Multicultural Diversity.</p>
<p>Nothing will be done.  Move along, folks, move along.  Nothing to see here.</p>

		<p>59% of the crime caused by a 12% black population. . so. . the community responds with a &#8216;black on black crime initiative&rsquo; and some notes about how the racists and bigots are, white. Looks like the UK has figured out diversity.  </p>

<p>Hmm, funny, in the U.S., the problem is &#8220;the long history of slavery and oppression.&#8221; In the U.K., it&rsquo;s the &#8220;history of imperialism.&#8221; What that has to do with black crime I don&rsquo;t know.

<p>Absolutely correct. The unfairness, however, is that a lot of judges, I&rsquo;m sure, feel like they have to throw out black cases for fears of being called racists and losing their job.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot think of anything more vile than racism. The issue here is not racism, it is one of multiculturalism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How &#8216;bout murder, rape, terrorist bombings, armed robbery&hellip; Hell I can think of lots of things that are worse than &#8220;racism,&#8221; why can&rsquo;t he?</p>

		<p>One big reason why cases get dismissed is because witnesses refuse to testify.  They may supply the cops with evidence, but then back out when it comes time to come to court.  Sometimes they&rsquo;re afraid, or they wilt under pressure from the suspects&rsquo; family or friends, or they leave town, go underground, or are simply too lazy and trifling to do their civic duty.  </p>

		<p>Did you see how the liberal blamed Britain&rsquo;s racist and imperialistic policies for making people poor?</p>
<p>First of all, there was no slavery in Britain and the arrival of non-whites is mostly a phenomenon of the last 30 years or so, so you cannot blame racism for a criminal cultural mindset.  </p>
<p>Next, imperialism did not make all those people poor.  The nations that Britain took over were POOR to begin with with cruel, despotic kings and sultans ruling over the ignorant masses with a heavy hand.</p>
<p>The British did suck resources out, but at the same time they set up schools, regularized the governments in the colonial lands and brought a level of civilization many of those places had never seen before.</p>
<p>When imperialism ended after WW I and WW II, the natives were left with the rudimentary beginnings of modern states.  They just returned to their corrupt ways and ruined that rise to civilization.</p>

		<p>Good debate on this in the Spectator. The last post by Simon Wooley (Apologists for multiculti and once diversity Czar for the outgoing New Labour Party) is quite interesting, For instance, he happily quotes Glasgow as the &#8216;knife crime capital of Britain&rsquo; but in Glasgow this can run to anything from a stripe across the face to a knife in the belly. What Wooley and others fail to mention is that in Glasgow, these knifings and stabbings are rarely  taken to a fatal conclusion. Thankfully, even in Glasgow, the mad Jocks are nowhere near n the same  pathological class as the blacks.</p>
