			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nadra Kareem, Race in America, May 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Psychologists tested the racial attitudes of children in the study by presenting them with five cartoon figures, identical in every regard but skin color, which ranged from very dark to very light. Asked to choose the smartest, nicest and prettiest cartoons, the children tested invariably chose the whitest of the bunch. More significantly, the children didn&rsquo;t hold back their reasons for their selections, admitting point-blank that the cartoons&rsquo; coloring factored into their choices.</p>
<p>When interviewed later, the parents, crying, were clearly appalled to discover that their kids held such attitudes about race. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Parents as well as CNN personalities such as Soledad O&rsquo;Brien were quick to name the nightly news, television shows and racist playmates as culprits.</p>
<p>{snip} Parents play an enormous role in how their children feel about race. Is it any wonder that white children overwhelmingly found the white cartoon kids to be the most attractive  &mdash;  considering that their parents overwhelmingly buy them dolls with light hair, light skin and light eyes? Dark dolls are so unpopular in retail stores that some companies sell them for less than white dolls just to get them off the shelves. Moreover, children recognize the types of people their parents find attractive. If a mother consistently calls men and women with light hair, light skin and light eyes beautiful, children pick up on it. The same can be said for black parents who criticize children for the texture of their hair and warn them not to play in the sun for too long  &mdash;  lest they get darker  &mdash;  or praise lighter-skinned blacks for their beauty, while ignoring darker-skinned blacks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that parents who live in all-white communities send a real message to their children about people of color, even if it&rsquo;s not expressed. White children who live exclusively around other whites may conclude that their parents chose their neighborhood because darker-skinned people are bad or dangerous. Such children may also conclude that they have no black classmates in school because blacks aren&rsquo;t as smart as whites, instead of considering the reality of economic and residential segregation  &mdash;  an issue likely too complex for them to grasp.</p>
<p>All of which is why if parents want to seriously tackle the issue of race with their kids, they have to be prepared to discuss the choices they&rsquo;ve made in life  &mdash;  from the neighborhood they choose to live in to the church they attend to the friends they have. And if parents want to raise non-racist children, they must be prepared to reconsider some of their choices, even if it means broadening their social circles, enrolling their children in diverse schools, buying their children multicultural toys and books or relocating to a different area altogether. Blaming children&rsquo;s racial attitudes on the media simply won&rsquo;t cut it.<br>

		<p>The parents whose children were in the study purportedly cried over their kids&rsquo; &#8220;racism&#8221;, yet they were blamed for causing their children&rsquo;s attitudes by buying white dolls?  Any silly liberals reduced to such tears probably are already buying multiethnic dolls, sending their kids to integrated schools, renting or buying homes in integrated churches, etc.  <br>
Ideas of beauty, both for children and adults, have nothing to do with perceptions of criminality or stupidity.  And, as for dolls, parents usually buy their daughters the dolls they specifically ask for.  <br>
The beating of this dead horse will apparently never stop.  And now we have a pea-brain like Soledad O&rsquo;Brien being quoted  &mdash;  a woman who is famous simply because of her multiracial makeup.  How can anyone continue to blame TV, with its full quota of non-whites, of propagating the liberal version of racism?</p>

		<p>I  have never read such non-sense in all my life. After 40 years of media manipulation and school desegregation children still have the correct attitudes about race. Long before I became racially aware. I myself never made one bigoted or &#8220;racist&#8221; comment to my 8 year old son. He did in fact go to school with many black children. He asked me a very simple question. &#8220;Dad why are black kids so dumb&#8221;. This story implies the opposite. That white parents failed to expose their children to enough black people because they lived in all white communities. Sorry but I lived in an all white community but they bussed in plenty of blacks to my high school. All they caused was trouble.</p>

<p>Such thoughts never enter the minds of white children because they are living and developing naturally in their own homogenous culture. Thoughts like that only pop into the heads of busybody minorities who hate the thought of white children growing up outside the grasp of their poisonous influence.</p>
<p>Reading the comments on the original article is entertaining. Their views on race and culture defy logic. The emotional contortions they go through to deny the obvious is at once comical and disturbing. The crux of it all is that whites get along fine with no minorities around but minorities are hopelessly dependent on whites to function at even a basic level in this society - and this is what they interpret as &#8216;white supremacy&rsquo; so as to save themselves the humiliation of owning up to their own limitations.</p>

		<p>Why can&rsquo;t liberals just accept the fact that we&rsquo;re all of bunch of racists? Their hatred of anything that isn&rsquo;t sufficiently &#8220;multicultural&#8221; reminds me of Victorian-era restraints. To the Victorians, natural thoughts and actions that were deemed immoral were utterly suppressed, and anything that diverged from the social norm was considered evil and demented. </p>
<p>&#8220;All of which is why if parents want to seriously tackle the issue of race with their kids, they have to be prepared to discuss the choices they&rsquo;ve made in life &mdash; from the neighborhood they choose to live in to the church they attend to the friends they have. And if parents want to raise non-racist children, they must be prepared to reconsider some of their choices, even if it means broadening their social circles, enrolling their children in diverse schools, buying their children multicultural toys and books or relocating to a different area altogether. Blaming children&rsquo;s racial attitudes on the media simply won&rsquo;t cut it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Funny. I didn&rsquo;t know we had been taken over by fascists just yet. But this sounds like something out of an Orwell book. You must change your entire life, move to a new house, make new friends, you must even allow yourself and your children to suffer (i.e. in a crime-ridden neighborhood with bad schools), if that&rsquo;s what it takes to condition people to think a certain way. On another article, one about miscegenation, featured here on AmRen, a lot of people commented that it was only a matter of time before marrying a white person as a white person yourself, was going to be considered immoral and racist. At the time, I laughed. &#8220;How silly. That could never happen!&#8221;, I thought. But now, I&rsquo;m not so sure anymore.</p>

		<p>Whites should demand that Nadra stop straightening her wool into fake straight hair before paying any attention to what she says about Whites.  We demand that she stop writing in the White Englishman&rsquo;s language, put her thoughts in writing in her own native African language.   Don&rsquo;t use my English against me- use your Edo or Congolese.  I want to hear and read it in its authentic forms from africa.</p>

<p><br>
The blacks who won&rsquo;t let their wool grow out natural and nappy are especially untrustworthy.  They hide their fierceness by contorting their wool into straightness and by speaking our native English to us instead of their African gibberish.</p>
<p>Everything they have, we gave to them. Language, opportunity, privilege, etc.</p>
<p>We should never engage them unless they first acknowledge that all they have was first ours, and admit that they are using our own inventions as weapons against us.  Language, opportunity, privilege, etc.</p>
<p>White parents who allow their White children to watch TV are doing their part to destroy Whiteness.  Look for the ubiquitous commercials where the black man is  muscular, good looking, shaven headed (non threatening), cool and in charge.  The White Dude will be fat, sloppy, frantic, and confused.  At the end, the black will heroically show the White the answer to the problem, and the White will look relieved and thankful that he was lucky enough to meet the naturally smart black man with all the answers.</p>
<p>What message about Whites does that send to White children?  Won&rsquo;t a few years of constant indoctrination by that message cure the racist problem in Whites?</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;All of which is why if parents want to seriously tackle the issue of race with their kids, they have to be prepared to discuss the choices they&rsquo;ve made in life &mdash; from the neighborhood they choose to live in to the church they attend to the friends they have. And if parents want to raise non-racist children, they must be prepared to reconsider some of their choices, even if it means broadening their social circles, enrolling their children in diverse schools, buying their children multicultural toys and books or relocating to a different area altogether. &#8220;</p>
<p>In other words, this black woman wants White parents to make their White daughters to be made available to black men in diverse environments.  The definition of racist has now changed to from actions in the positive (prejudice, bigotry) to the negative (not embracing diversity).</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s not what you do that makes you a racist, it&rsquo;s what you don&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>In your Racism Audit, you will be asked to confess all those occasions when you had the opportunity to put your White daughter in the middle of a gang of black men, but chose not to.  To atone for the sin of racism, you will be faced with the choice of complete dispossession through loss of job and opportunity, or complete degradation through loss of pure bloodlines in your posterity.</p>
<p>We are in a contest of survival, and our enemies have found our weakness and are assaulting us with a full attack.  </p>
<p>We must engage the battle.  Let&rsquo;s take the Nadra Diversity Demand into the White synagogues and put those non Christian children through the racial doll experiment.  If they fail and betray their racist tendencies, then we have the MORAL AUTHORITY for dictating the remedy.  </p>
<p>The synagogues must be integrated both Racially and Religiously.</p>
<p>White Episcopalians now reach salvation through Multi-faith and Inter-faith ceremonies in which Muslims take charge and lead so called Christians and Buddhists in common prayer.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s demand that the White synagogues become beacons of Multi-Faith Diversity!</p>
<p>Fight racism- no more segregated synagogues!<br>

		<p>I didn&rsquo;t see anything about the results of similar tests done using black kids.</p>
<p>Is it at least POSSIBLE that kids think the &#8220;better color&#8221; is the color of their parents and extended family, so that white children would prefer whites and black children would prefer blacks?  </p>
<p>Would I know the answer to this if I&rsquo;d read the entire article?  Or is the main supposition of the article supposed to be that whites are guilty of racism, always and forever, world-without-end-amen?  (Also: Is it possible that a person named Nadra Kareem might not be totally objective in her analysis?  Deep thinkers want to know&hellip;)</p>

<p>How about we tell our kids blacks are a liability, they hate you because you&rsquo;re white, and they can&rsquo;t past the muster no matter how much you help them out.

<p>Says it all doesn&rsquo;t it? In other words if you are WHITE (only) you will have to live in diverse neighborhoods, send your kids to schools that are about 10% White, if that. Work with &#8220;diverse&#8221; peoples only. Buy black dolls and GI Joes only for your White children. </p>

All the so called racists I know are the ones that have to come in contact with them, whereas the Whites I know that have very little contact with them are the ones that are champions of &#8220;diversity&#8221;.

<p>The attitude of the parents is far more frightening than that of the children.  Why is it desirable for blacks to have self esteem, including pride about their own race, but wicked for whites to have the same feelings?</p>

<p>The best way to make a liberal white person into a race realist (what Nadra Kareem would call a &#8220;racist&#8221;) is to make him live in a majority black neighborhood and make his kids attend a majority black school.  So Nadra had better be careful of what she wishes for.  Also, I wonder, do black parents go out of their way to buy their children white dolls?  I suspect not.</p>
<p><i>Blaming children&rsquo;s racial attitudes on the media simply won&rsquo;t cut it.</i></p>
<p>I agree.  I blame the parents&rsquo; egregious attitudes on the media.<br>

		<p>I raised my family in a very white town. Far different than the East Los Angeles of my youth. I never felt the need to prejudice my children with stories of my past experiences with the darker peoples of this world. I knew they were bright kids and would see what needed to be seen. I was right, while both of them were bombarded with propaganda telling them to feel guilty about being white in a white town. Nether of them bought into it. My son went so far as to tell one of his high school teachers that she was an anti white racist, after one of her comments. He was cheered by most of his classmates. My daughter figured it out while studying criminal law on her way into law enforcement.</p>
<p>Not that that would not have set them straight, if they turned out to be less intelligent and observant.I think most white kids are seeing the truth for themselves. They just tend to stay quiet about it, as they make sure they live in the white parts of town.  </p>

		<p>One way a parent can prevent their child from being racist is to raise them in an all white area. The child will then have no idea what real non-whites are like and think they are all like the ones they see on TV.</p>

		<p>Children are very observant. This ability to intelligently develop conclusions based on what one sees is a fundamental aspect of being human. What liberals want out of parents is to convince their children that what they see is wrong and to punish them severely if their children do not believe that which is contrary to their own observations. I think absent liberal indoctrination, all well-minded White children would naturally come to the realization that all the races aren&rsquo;t equal. The evidence is just too plain to see. </p>

		<p>I for one wholeheartedly agree with Ms. Nadra Kareem. After all, had I not been raised in a multicultural environment and enrolled in diverse schools I wouldn&rsquo;t be on Amren today.</p>
<p>Does this woman really believe herself? Surely she&rsquo;s considered <br>
that the obnoxious, violent, and often downright bizarre behavior of blacks is what sends the real message about color. Take my experience for instance.</p>
<p>By the time I graduated in 06, I had sat through the guilt trips of black guidance counselors, field trips to civil rights exhibits, racial propaganda videos, and black history month since grade 1. Coincidentally, I was pretty liberal on racial topics (despite attending lilly white suburban and private schools). It wasn&rsquo;t until I dealt with large numbers of blacks personally at work and in college that I knew I didn&rsquo;t want to associate with them.</p>
<p>All the things people like Ms. Kareem fight against: the stereotypes, prejudice, etc. are absolutely vindicated after dealing with them. Im young and I&rsquo;ve seen blacks threaten to kill a coworker, call my suburban hometown &#8220;k land&#8221;, &#8220;stomp&#8221; each other, a 25 year old consider using birth control after the fifth kid, and participate in a &#8220;flash mob&#8221; of hundreds at my university on election night 08, yelling &#8220;paint the whitehouse black&#8221;, specifically asking white kids who they voted for. These are only a few of my more diverse experiences.  </p>
<p>The bottom line is this Ms. Kareem: subjecting white kids to any truly diverse environments will only bring them to our side. Every white kid I know looks down on the appalling behavior of blacks even though they&rsquo;ve been taught better. Instead, keep them away from blacks, in garbage classes like Sociology and Critical theory, &#8220;considering the reality of economic and residential segregation&#8221; and other unprovable anti-white nonsense.</p>

		<p>Do the black kids have racist parents? (Yes, of course, but against whites) Or, have these kids just observed reality and haven&rsquo;t yet learned to deny reality so that people don&rsquo;t call them racist for being honest?</p>

		<p>Preferance for lighter skin is universal, as many AmReners have mentioned. When I was in Turkey with a group of American students, a Turk friend of mine asked me which student I thought was the most beautiful. I was an anti-racist before my experience in Turkey, so I said the blackest girl we had was the most beautiful because of her inner beauty. This friend of mine burst out in laughter. Even Turks, one of the most mixed &#8220;races&#8221; on the earth, know perfectly well that white skin is the most beautiful and I was accused of lying. </p>
<p>I wish it were not true. I wish more blacks were attracted to their own, more Asians to their own. I did not make many friends in Turkey because I was a white girl and Turkish girls did not want me near their boyfriends. I completely understand and do not blame them.</p>
<p>But that is just the way it is, the way it will always be.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s hope that more indoctrinated white people realize this, lest we fall deeper into this Orwellian trap.  </p>

		<p>Communism prevails, those things which only a short time past would been thought too insane to imagine are now the norm. Time and space doesn&rsquo;t allow me to enumerate them. What was thought to exist ony in communist countries are now rampant everywhere. Excuse me, what am I thinking where are these NON communist countries? None come to mind. Yes parents DO need to discuss race with their children, if they are intelligent enough to realize the real diffrences. Again, what am I thinking that would mean only a select few whites would be able to give sane advice. Of course I am only talking about white parents, all other races have it figured out, and their children have already been enlightened from day one.</p>

		<p>A few weeks ago a black male tried to rob me with a handgun. There was a scuffle and I ended up firing at the suspect. I missed and he got away&hellip;.when my wife and I told the children about it, my son kept asking why are blacks like that?? <br>
He just assumed the suspect was black (correctly).I never mentioned the race of the robber. <br>
But, I do make sure my children understand that blacks are different. We emphasize that God loves them too (which I wholeheartedly believe). <br>
But we have a right to live as a separate race with our peculiar institutions and wants. </p>

		<p>     After reading this piece of fairytale liberal garbage, I actually found myself agreeing with part of it:</p>
<p>   &#8220;Parents play an enormous role in how their children feel about race.&#8221;  &#8220;It&rsquo;s also worth noting that parents who live in all-white communities send a real message to their children about people of color, even if it&rsquo;s not expressed. White children who live exclusively around other whites may conclude that their parents chose their neighborhood because darker-skinned people are bad or dangerous. Such children may also conclude that they have no black classmates in school because blacks aren&rsquo;t as smart as whites.&#8221;  &#8220;All of which is why if parents want to seriously tackle the issue of race with their kids, they have to be prepared to discuss the choices they&rsquo;ve made in life &mdash; from the neighborhood they choose to live in to the church they attend to the friends they have.&#8221;</p>
<p>     My children have drawn their own conclusions.  Further, as suggested by the article, I have had discussions with them as they grew about the choices I&rsquo;ve made- &#8220;from neighborhood to the church [I] attend&#8221;.  My ten year old, and his five older siblings, would have all responded as expected to the questions asked&hellip;.. except that their father would be crying with pride, not shame, that his children were not pansy-brained white apologists and were able to see the world for what it really is, and see the black race for what it really is. </p>

		<p>Kids are smart enough to discern for themselves that there is something not right with the behavior of their black schoolmates&hellip;the disruptive conduct, disrespect, crime, drugs, physical assaults, etc. No amount of multi-culti brainwashing will change that, and these impressions carry over into adulthood.</p>

		<p>This is proof that Diversity is being taught as a religion.  This is why seperation between church and state is so important, and why undermining that for your favorite religion is dangerous.  Like organized religion, Diversity is being taught as a moral fact.  The State continues to work to indoctrinate in schools, colleges, and now they want to intervene into the homelife of every American.  They want to enlist ignorant adults into assisting them with programming innocent children into their ideology, even when it means the marginalization and eventual extermination of their own kind.</p>
<p>I hope that all whites still have enough ability for free, objective, and critical thought so that they will recognize that these tactics are an attempt by the State to rob youth of their right to free thought.  As a philosopher I recognize that the effect of dogmatic religions on whole populations is against the development and preservation of that skill.  Whites need to wake up in more ways than some here may think.</p>

		<p>Let me get this straight. We are supposed to move to higher crime racially diverse areas, enroll our children in less safe and less successful multi-racial schools, buy them toys that depict non-whites, go to a multi racial church and select friends specifically because they are non-white in order to make sure that our children don&rsquo;t grow up to be evil white racists?</p>
<p>I have a better idea why don&rsquo;t we repatriate Blacks, Mestizos, Arabs and other non-whites to their countries of origin, if the only race left in the US is the white race then there will be no more &#8220;racism&#8221; in America. Racial conflict and strife will end finally. Support ending all racial conflict support the repatriation of non-whites to their countries of origin!</p>
<p>Consider this as well, we know that non-whites bring incredible and numerous benefits to our society, why then is it fair for us to horde all the non-white masses, we should insist that they stay in Mexico, Arabia, Africa, and Asia, it&rsquo;s not fair for white countries to take all of these incredibly beneficial non whites and horde them we must share non-white immigrants with the third world after all these impoverished nations could benefit from diversity the most. Surely they need the skills and family values, hard work and abilities that only these minorities have more than anyone.</p>

		<p>At least they&rsquo;re openly admitting that brainwashing is required to achieve this wonderful diverse and multicultural society - as if public schooling and popular culture weren&rsquo;t already doing enough of it.</p>
<p>Kareem gives all-white communities too much credit - the greatest lovers of diversity are rich white people who have never had the pleasure of experiencing it for themselves. My high school was full of white and asian kids who watched BET and listened to rap music, and I had a friend who was so fascinated by black people that she would take us on drives around the ghettos whenever we went shopping. (Was it here that I read the article about the actual paid ghetto tours? Apparently there&rsquo;s a market for it.)</p>
<p>What will they do when they realize it&rsquo;s impossible to completely eliminate what is essentially natural instinct? Perhaps (white) babies will be genetically modified to have Williams syndrome.</p>

<p>No, Kareem, that is what YOU think. Most White children in their natural surrounding have no reason whatsover to even think about black people. Why are you so obsessed with White people, kareem?<br>
Making a living out of it?<br>
Who gave you this &#8216;authority&rsquo; and platform to advocate for the ethnic cleansing of White people?<br>

<p>I lived in Memphis for many years, and I think I know which university you&rsquo;re talking about, and I also attended it. I also had a liberal attitude towards blacks before I came into close contact with them. The dormitory was always filled with loud rap music, and they would turn aggresive if they were asked to keep the music down. I&rsquo;m not surprised that there was a flash mob on campus. It sounds like the type of thing that might go on there. </p>

		<p>The ongoing persecution and outright racial harassment of White peoples by White Marxists and their enabled non-White pet projects, very clearly falls into the criminal category.</p>
<p>I believe, the current Communist agenda is to now attempt the denial altogether of <b>all</b> natural human rights, ie, freedom of speech, freedom of movement AND even basic natural instinct especially that relating to survival, of White peoples.  They have for past decades been denying White people their rights to compete for employment and academic opportunity through criminal Affirmative Action and quota system set-aside legislation for the exclusive benefits and privileges of non-Whites only. </p>
<p>They, the extreme Left, are presently actively following a policy which very evidently is aimed at dehumanizing White people entirely.</p>
<p>We had better start waking up pronto and recognising such relentless and hideous attacks for what they truly are -</p>
<p><b>attempted extermination of White European descended peoples.</b>  </p>
<p>The fact that only White people are singled out for race-hate persecution by the Marxist political system and media, proves this.</p>
<p>Whites globally have got to seriously organise themselves collectively in every human activity sphere so as to be in a position to initiate criminal prosecution proceedings against the Marxist-controlled establishment and media outlets that employ these perpetrators of anti-White race hate.<br>
