			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeffrey S. Passel, Wendy Wang and Paul Taylor, Pew Research Center, June 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Key findings:</p>
<p>* A record 14.6% of all new marriages in the United States in 2008 were between spouses of a different race or ethnicity from one another. This includes marriages between a Hispanic and non-Hispanic (Hispanics are an ethnic group, not a race) as well as marriages between spouses of different races  &mdash;  be they white, black, Asian, American Indian or those who identify as being of multiple races or &#8220;some other&#8221; race.</p>
<p>* Among all newlyweds in 2008, 9% of whites, 16% of blacks, 26% of Hispanics and 31% of Asians married someone whose race or ethnicity was different from their own.</p>
<p>* Gender patterns in intermarriage vary widely. Some 22% of all black male newlyweds in 2008 married outside their race, compared with just 9% of black female newlyweds. Among Asians, the gender pattern runs the other way. Some 40% of Asian female newlyweds married outside their race in 2008, compared with just 20% of Asian male newlyweds. Among whites and Hispanics, by contrast, there are no gender differences in intermarriage rates.</p>
<p>* Rates of intermarriages among newlyweds in the U.S. more than doubled between 1980 (6.7%) and 2008 (14.6%). However, different groups experienced different trends. Rates more than doubled among whites and nearly tripled among blacks. But for both Hispanics and Asians, rates were nearly identical in 2008 and 1980.</p>
<p>* These seemingly contradictory trends were both driven by the heavy, ongoing Hispanic and Asian immigration wave of the past four decades. For whites and blacks, these immigrants (and, increasingly, their U.S.-born children who are now of marrying age) have enlarged the pool of potential spouses for out-marriage. But for Hispanics and Asians, the ongoing immigration wave has also enlarged the pool of potential partners for in-group marriage.</p>
<p>* There is a strong regional pattern to intermarriage. Among all new marriages in 2008, 21% in the West were interracial or interethnic, compared with 13% in both the South and Northeast and 11% in the Midwest.</p>
<p>* Most Americans say they approve of racial or ethnic intermarriage  &mdash;  not just in the abstract, but in their own families. More than six-in-ten say it &#8220;would be fine&#8221; with them if a family member told them they were going to marry someone from any of three major race/ethnic groups other than their own.</p>
<p>* More than a third of adults (35%) say they have a family member who is married to someone of a different race. Blacks say this at higher rates than do whites; younger adults at higher rates than older adults; and Westerners at higher rates than people living in other regions of the country.</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>A record 14.6% of all new marriages in the United States in 2008 were between spouses of a different race or ethnicity from each other, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of new data from the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>
<p>That figure is an estimated six times the intermarriage1 rate among newlyweds in 1960 and more than double the rate in 1980.</p>
<p>This dramatic increase has been driven in part by the weakening of longstanding cultural taboos against intermarriage and in part by a large, multi-decade wave of immigrants from Latin America and Asia.</p>
<p>In 1961, the year Barack Obama&rsquo;s parents were married, less than one in 1,000 new marriages in the United States was, like theirs, the pairing of a black person and a white person, according to Pew Research estimates. By 1980, that share had risen to about one in 150 new marriages. By 2008, it had risen to one-in-sixty.</p>
<p>Pairings: Even with that sharp increase, however, black-white couplings represented only about one-in-nine of the approximately 280,000 new interracial or interethnic marriages in 2008.</p>
<p>White-Hispanic couples accounted for about four-in-ten (41%) of such new marriages; white-Asian couples made up 15%; and white-black couples made up 11%.</p>
<p>The remaining third consisted of marriages in which each spouse was a member of a different minority group or in which at least one spouse self-identified as being American Indian or of mixed or multiple races.</p>

		<p>This is no surprise based on my observations. Out west you definitely see the most race mixing, so much so that when I lived out there I did not blink an eye after awhile seeing a good looking white female with a black guy or the ubiquitous Asian female/white male coupling. <br/>
One thing to note though is that this study deals with marriage. Black guys aren&rsquo;t exactly the marrying kind so I think black male rates are understated. Also much infidelity/one night stands among white women probably involve black men.  </p>

		<p>This is the result of one side propaganda by the mass media, the government, and the churches.</p>
<p>When I was growing up, Interracial relationships were frowned upon. I even had a very liberal high school teacher who voted for LBJ for President in 1964 said that interracial relationships are unfair to the children in front an integrated classroom that caused a black student to to cry, and yell.  The Teacher never got in trouble for the remark, in which I agreed with.</p>
<p>If you should openly oppose interracial relationship, and give very sound reasons. You are branded a hater, and a racist. And to the multicults, they will never give you a chance to argue racial differences.</p>
<p>To those whom remember in what America look liked in 1960.  Today America is starting to act and look like the third world.</p>
<p>I do not believe that America can continue to be a great country and be multiracial too.  You can look at Brazil and Mexico for examples.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a big difference between marrying someone of a different race and marrying someone from a different ethnic group.  An inter-ethnic marriage would be a German marrying a Scots.</p>

<p>No, &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; is a catch-all umbrella group of Spanish-speaking peoples from a wide spectrum of ethnic groups that range ethno-racially from white to black and most everything &#8220;brown&#8221; in between!    </p>

		<p>Can someone look up the domostic violence and divorce rates of interracial marriages. </p>
<p>Once a people has lost its women the the people shall exist no more. Time to step up white men. Quit being haters and with your women back. Protect them, provide for them, entertain them, listen to them, pleasure them and most of all appreciate them. If you don&rsquo;t someone else will. And that someone is more than likely not white. </p>

		<p>I once dated a guy who enjoyed lecturing me on how racist I was.  He looked down on me with his West Coast snobbiness towards my Southern &#8220;stupidity&#8221;.  He kept lecturing me on how the South needs to be more tolerant and that it is such a backwards part of the country (meanwhile he seemed to enjoy living down there and he is still down there to this day). The &#8220;relationship&#8221; didn&rsquo;t last long.  </p>
<p>I remember arguing with him about intermarriage one day.  I remember watching his face filling with disgust when I spoke about how there is nothing wrong with whites wishing to preserve their race.  I then watched his face go from a look of disgust to a boyish smile when I started mentioning nonwhite races that I find beautiful and how I thought that they too need to be preserved.  Then I started talking about whites again, and his face went back to a frown.  </p>
<p>Why do so many whites hate themselves in this way?  Sometimes I misunderstand other whites more than I do nonwhites.</p>

		<p>Now give us a report on how these marriages are doing; divorce, longevity, happiness, family income, domestic problems, child well-being etc. I knew a white woman who&rsquo;d been married to a Chinese guy. They had two kids and later divorced. She was the one who raised the kids as the father moved to a different city. The kids, now university age, have identity problems and are drifting in the direction of their Chinese family and away from the mother. The mother&rsquo;s conclusion? People should marry within their own race. </p>

<p>I am not a hypocrite, either; I also support the preservation of the non-White races.</p>
<p>Strangely, your ex-boyfriend favors preserving the other races; but not our own. </p>

<p>Courtney - I hope you never gave that guy a second date, and it would please me enormously if you had terminated that initial date early and asked the guy to never call you again.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one rule I stand by, as a white Southern man.   If I see any indication at all coming from a white female that she approves of race mixing, or is in any way one of these guilt-ridden, self-hating white idiots - I end that relationship interview so fast, I leave skid marks in the drive way.</p>
<p>And, I don&rsquo;t care if she looks hotter than Bo Derek in her prime, I&rsquo;m gone.   Zero tolerance as far as that most critical issue is concerned, and that&rsquo;s the only attitude whites should have if we are serious about our survival.</p>
<p>Heck, the CDC Statistics on AIDS infections alone are sufficient motivation to NEVER get romantically involved with non-white races!  </p>

<p>Well Alexandra, &#8220;mestizo&#8221; is the Spanish word for mixed.  Generally in Latin America someone of mixed Native American Indian and white (usually Spanish) ancestory is known as a &#8220;mestizo.&#8221; Of course you could probably call any Spanish speaker who clearly looks to have non-white ancestory &#8220;mestizo&#8221; even if they are in fact a stew of white, Indian, and/or black background. But stricly speaking the word has traditionally been used for white/Indain mixes. </p>

		<p>What I&rsquo;d love to see are the numbers broken down again by age.  How many of these whites marrying non-whites are over the childbearing age?  I remember reading the story of one white woman who had already had two white children and was in her late thirties that was talking about remarrying to a black man for whatever reason.</p>
<p>And again, how many of the &#8220;hispanics&#8221; are mestizo, and how many are castizo or even full blooded Spaniards&hellip; or Italians for that matter(up to 60% of Argentina is estimated to have Italian heritage)?  </p>
<p>I live in the South and I simply don&rsquo;t see very many mestizo/white pairings at all, despite the fact that there are mestizos everywhere.  In fact, I can count the number of marriages between whites and mestizos I personally know on one hand.  </p>

<p>Over 100 years of propaganda, hundreds of years of colonization, orientalism, loss of Christian faith (which once bound together white people with one another rather than with various pagan peoples), THE SEXUAL REVOLUTION and all the perversions that followed along with it. </p>
<p>Feminism has killed our race. The few holdouts with large families (white Christians) will be exterminated by the state. Watch for it.</p>
<p>I bet you 90% of people who say they care for the white race will refuse to even have 4 children. Our people look at family sizes like the JAPANESE do now and they are disappearing as a people (in Japan anyway).</p>

		<p>I travel mostly by auto all around the US, and I see very little mixing of races or at the very least much less than what some have described.  Ethnicities I don&rsquo;t know, because the way these liars fudge statistics on studies, they could well mean that when a German American marries an Irish one, that constitutes a mixed marriage.</p>
<p>However, this much I know very well:  The liberal factions who are brainwashed and propagandized into wanting a mixed race society will lie, cheat, steal or kill in order to try to convince others such a utopia is coming about.  Their intent is to hopefully bring about their sick fantasies by lying about the extent of them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a saying in Washington:  &#8220;If you want to promote a point of view, pay me and I&rsquo;ll have a study done to support whatever you want.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, how they want to see their &#8220;everyman&#8221; utopia come about because, like Courtney&rsquo;s acquaintance above, they&rsquo;re reached a point where they are programmed as effectively as one of the furer&rsquo;s followers or one of &#8220;Dear Leader&rsquo;s&#8221; typical followers who fell into the street weeping upon learning of his death and remained there for days afterward, tearing at their hair and clothes.</p>
<p>This is the result of turning institutes of education into dungeons of social engineering that promote only one point of view that involves a process of programming&hellip;&hellip;.or accept the consequences on the rack&hellip;&hellip;or its equivalent in being ostracized and hated by the administration and mentally ill students.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t allow yourselves to be among the gullible who can be tricked into believing what sick people want you to believe.</p>
<p>Of course there is race-mixing, but I&rsquo;m positive not to the extent they would have you believe.</p>

		<p>Since this appears to label &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; a race, I think we can assume perhaps half the &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; are White-Hispanics. The white exogamy rate in actuality is much lower than 8.9%.</p>

		<p>The only acceptable number of interracial marriages for whites is zero. </p>
<p>The number of non-white children being born to white women that is acceptable is zero. </p>
<p>Our goal is to eliminate both - permanently.</p>
<p>Whites have been targeted for extermination. The genocidists are using social engineering to breed whites out of existence. </p>
<p>Their plan has the following elements.</p>
<p>1. Degrade white people and white culture as much as possible. Make whites feel that they are worthless and evil. If whites believe that white people are garbage they won&rsquo;t want to have white partners or children.</p>
<p>2. Glorify non-whites and non-white culture as much as possible. If whites believe that non-whites are royalty they will want to have non-white partners and children</p>
<p>3. Make whites feel that non-whites and non-white culture are far superior to white people and white culture. </p>
<p>4. Engage in propaganda specifically to persuade whites to breed with non-whites instead of whites.</p>
<p>We need to oppose this policy straight down the line. We should do the exact opposite of what the genocidists do.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for something concrete to do, do something to build up whites and white culture. Talk about what&rsquo;s good about white people and their culture. Talk about the wonderful history of the white race.</p>

		<p>Thank God 41% of these are between Whites and Hispanics. This is good for two reasons: 1.) a good number of Hispanics are white-skinned, especially Cubans it seems, 2.) even brownish Hispanics often produces a white baby. For example, my sister is one-fourth Hispanic but look like a pure-bred white person, and has excellent mental capabilities.</p>
<p>Also, marriages between whites and Asians seem to produce children that are more white than not.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Mestizo&#8221; is Spanish for &#8220;mixed.&#8221;  The peoples of Central and South America were originally pure Indians who were conquered by the Spanish and mixed with them to create a unique hybrid group of people.  </p>
<p>It is believed the average Mestizo of Mexico is on average 85% or more Indian and 15% or less Spanish, Black or Other.  At one time Mexico had a large African population that has been almost totally absorbed into their Indian gene pool.  There also used to be a small German population in Mexico that has been absorbed, as well as other small groups.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Hispanic&#8221; is a euphemism to lull North Americans into thinking the strangers entering our country by the millions are Spanish people just like we would find in Spain!  In reality they are Meso-American Indians with a touch of primarily Spanish ancestry.</p>
<p>Like many non-Whites, they admire Whites but resent/envy them.  In sufficient numbers they will create a USA in their own image that comes from their collective subconscious. </p>
<p>At current illegal immigration levels Mexican Americans will be the largest ethnic group in America by 2050.  That USA will be a very different country than our country today.</p>

<p>Mestizo means a mixture of European (usually Spanish) and American Indian.  Which race they more resemble depends on the proportions.  Most Mexicans we see in the US are mestizos with a substantial Indian component.  There are mostly or entirely Spanish descended Mexicans but they tend not to be the ones illegally crossing the border to work as gardners.  I think about 10% of Mexico is supposed to be of pure European descent.</p>

		<p>mestizo/mestiso or as we say in Canada Metis, are people of White/native ancestry. While in Canada the White ancestry predominates most Metis, in latin America the native side predominates (less white blood). Hope that helps.</p>

		<p>#9, a mestizo is someone of mixed European and Native American blood.  Usually, the white element will be Spanish.  <br/>
As to this article, the reader must realize that many states had laws against interracial marriage until 1967, when the Supreme Court struck them down.  Some states outlawed white/black, some white/Native, and some white/&#8221;Oriental&#8221;, or any combo of the three.  (I&rsquo;ve never seen where a state outlawed Anglo/Hispanic unions.)  Trying to decide who is Hispanic often becomes a conundrum, and many whites in the South have Native blood, so it&rsquo;s usually a matter of how someone identifies himself and if he can convince others of his stated ethnicity.  <br/>
#3 makes a good point.  There are many ethnicities within the white race, but whites are often ignored on such terms.  In liberal thinking, we&rsquo;re just the great white horde that must be oppressed for the good of those darker.<br/>

		<p>This is just more propaganda spin.  Assume conservatively that half of those White/Hispanic marriages are not to mestizos and you end up with the result that less than half of all mixed marriages are Whites to nonwhites.  The 9 percent figure is probably in actuality about 4.5 percent for Whites.  I personally don&rsquo;t care if Whites marry nonwhites as long as they don&rsquo;t have children, a covert form of birth control if you will, to reduce the long term nonwhite populations in the country.    </p>

		<p>Moving one step past the numbers take a look at what happens within these unions. What percent of white females are murdered, beaten, cheated on, psychologically abused, financially exploited, etc, by their black spouses? From personal observation I&rsquo;d say nearly all. When these black &#8220;husbands&#8221; get tired they just disappear without the slightest regard for what happens to their offspring, the children could starve for all they care. They just move on from woman to woman, having some children here and there along the way with no regard for anything or anybody. The children produced by all these unions are usually maladjusted and have all sorts of problems throughout their lives. Whites tend to be naive and get suckered into these type marriages by the initial pampering and compliments they receive at first. Misery follows later.   </p>

		<p>I am skeptical of these figures.  I live in the liberal Northeast and even here the vast majority of whites draw the line at miscegenation.  There is no way that one in ten whites is marrying a non-white.  The purpose of this article, like all media propaganda, is to influence events rather than report them.</p>
<p>A far greater danger to our survival is the disparity in birth rates between whites and non-whites.      </p>

<p>There is a relatively common conspiracy theory going around the low class black parts of St. Louis that &#8220;da man&#8221; or &#8220;da white po-leeceseseses&#8221; or &#8220;da white powa strucha&#8221; are deliberately parading white women around the &#8220;getos&#8221; as nothing more than bait to lure black men into jail. </p>
<p>The reason they think that is that in virtually all instances where a low class black has taken up with a white woman, the black winds up going to jail or prison.</p>
<p>First, that probably would have happened anyway, even without the white woman in his life.  But second, it&rsquo;s not that there&rsquo;s any police/establishment conspiracy, it&rsquo;s that (A) white women are significantly more sensitive than black women to recognizing domestic violence and abuse, and far more likely to interpret a certain action, set of actions or words on the part of her man as illegal or proto-illegal domestic violence, and (B) Black men, especially the low class ones in question, are far more likely to engage in such acts.  Add the two together, and when you put low class black man and any white woman in a relationship, there is almost a 100% chance that she&rsquo;ll have to call the cops to report domestic violence.  And since cops are far more sensitive to domestic violence than they used to be, they will take the man off to jail.</p>

		<p>Miscegenation (interracial breeding) produces offspring of lower intelligence relative to the more intelligent parent. For example, when a White woman reproduces with a Black man, she has a less intelligent baby compared to the one she likely would have had with a White man. It&rsquo;s a genetic fact. </p>
<p>The mulatto offspring will be at a disadvantage intellectually. Result? A win for corporations and governments, which rely on their ability to manipulate a dumbed-down populace. Is it any wonder they celebrate their planned reduction in the numbers of Whites? Only Whites pose a serious threat to their power.</p>
<p>Indeed, Whites in society represent problems for corporations and governments. We demand much more accountability from employers, sellers, government, and society. Our standards are far higher. In contrast, it is far easier for the gov-corp machine to manipulate and use people with less intelligence (e.g., Blacks and Mulattos).</p>
<p>Regardng &#8220;Hispanics&#8221;, how in God&rsquo;s name can one consider them an ethnic category that is classified under &#8220;White&#8221;? </p>
<p>Yes, there are some White people who were born in Central and South America and are direct descendants of European stock, but most of the people there are the products of Spanish explorers who interbred with Central Americans who purportedly descended from Oriental Asians who walked from Asia to North America, Central America, and South America. They are NOT White. They are mixed-race offspring with a lot of other genetic material.</p>
<p>Most of the time, when I travel to large cities in North America, I find it impossible to determine race or ethnicity. The intermixed people appear increasingly strange, odd, and unrecognizable; a point that I am sure pleases the government and large corporations to no end. </p>

		<p><i>What I&rsquo;d love to see are the numbers broken down again by age. How many of these whites marrying non-whites are over the childbearing age? I remember reading the story of one white woman who had already had two white children and was in her late thirties that was talking about remarrying to a black man for whatever reason.</i><br/>
<a href="../../../../assets/publications/1616-8.gif" rel="nofollow">http://pewresearch.org/assets/publications/1616-8.gif</a><br/>
Younger whites, it appear, do not mix as much. Older whites who remarry do indeed appear to be more likely to race-mix than the general married population. People in their 20s seem to in fact be less likely to marry out than people in their 30s or 40s.</p>
<p><i>And again, how many of the &ldquo;hispanics&rdquo; are mestizo, and how many are castizo or even full blooded Spaniards… or Italians for that matter(up to 60% of Argentina is estimated to have Italian heritage)?</i></p>
<p>I live in the South and I simply don&rsquo;t see very many mestizo/white pairings at all, despite the fact that there are mestizos everywhere. In fact, I can count the number of marriages between whites and mestizos I personally know on one hand. </p>
<p>I know personally of several whites who happen to bear Spanish surnames and are therefore counted as &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; by the Census. From other people&rsquo;s observations, most of these &#8220;white/Hispanic&#8221; intermarriages are of this kind; they may be even less common than actual white/mestizo marriages.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s upsetting that Americans are withheld information by the mainstream equalitarian media. Offspring of African Americans to others will probably decrease measurable intelligence to the mean of the parent&rsquo;s IQ. I suspect, or hope that if a White woman was to learn that her child would likely have an IQ of 90 because her IQ of 100 and her Black spouse&rsquo;s IQ of 80 was the case, then just maybe she would think twice about producing children? Maybe not, but most people want their children to excel in school and be able to better solve problems in life? Since Hispanics have a lower IQ the same problem exists there. Of course this doesn&rsquo;t even factor in things like increased incidence of HIV, spousal abuse and a host of other likelihoods.</p>
<p>The Bell Curve attempted to deal with this looming intelligence problem. However, Bell Curve wasn&rsquo;t refuted but only attacked with verbal abuse. Equalitarians might counter that freedom of speech exists to get the message of intelligence and genetics out, but look at how the AmRen Convention tried to do so and was closed down because of anti-free speech advocates? And AG Holder did absolutely nothing to protect their free speech. </p>
<p>Maybe if more people contributed financially to American Renaissance then people could be educated as to how multiracialism decreases the intelligence of children. In the meanwhile, multiracialists don&rsquo;t expect your child to ever become rocket scientists and don&rsquo;t bother to argue with schools which can do very little to educate your lower IQ children.</p>

		<p>I think a lot of you are being entirely too optimistic about this situation, claiming that you hardly ever see couples race-mixing in your area. That may be true in your area, but let me tell you, where I am from - BALTIMORE/DC metro - it is RAMPANT and depending on where you go in my area, you will see more white women/black men and white women/hispanic men pairings than white/white pairings.</p>
<p>I am 30 and grew up in the suburbs of Baltimore. When I was a little girl, it was EXTREMELY unusual to see a mixed race couple. The only experience I had with anyone dating outside of their race was through my best friend&rsquo;s sister who seemed to have a very unhealthy preoccupation with black men and black culture in general. Over the years, I watched her morph into a full-fledged &#8220;hood rat.&#8221; As a little girl, I remember my best friend on many occasions saying &#8220;I wish my sister wouldn&rsquo;t do that&hellip;I wish she would date white men.&#8221; Little did I know then, that my best friend and more than half of the white girls I grew up with would follow the same path as my friend&rsquo;s sister.</p>
<p>Fast forward 10 years and I&rsquo;m in high school. That&rsquo;s when things really started to change, from the late 90s on, at least here in MD. Lots of people in my high school and especially in college were much more receptive to dating outside their race. Initially, I bought into all the propaganda but I never dated outside my race; I was just a lot more &#8220;accepting&#8221; of people who did. I even took a &#8220;culture&#8221; course in college that, for the most part, talked about how evil whites are and how much damage we&rsquo;ve inflicted on non-whites. A big component of that class was discussing the importance of interracial relationships, how great they are, how mixed race people are stronger, etc. Thank god I never bought into it and eventually figured it all out. </p>
<p>That aside, over the last 10 years or so interracial relationships have positively skyrocketed in this area. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, the marriage component is irrelevant. Black men and white women are reproducing at breakneck speed. The fact that there is offspring, and not necessarily a marriage, is what is so utterly damaging and terrifying to think about. I want to share with you, from my experiences, how this happens:</p>
<p>Just about every white girl I know who&rsquo;s done this has come from a broken home with little to no parental involvement, especially from the father. Usually, the father has passed away, is abusive, uninvolved, etc. The girl seems relatively stable until she reaches adolescence and falls into a depression. She will begin lashing out and rebelling as most teenagers do, only she will, for a variety of different reasons, rebel by &#8220;becoming black.&#8221; She will fully reject white culture in order to be accepted by her black peers at her integrated school. She will shun intelligence and feign stupidity in order to fit in. She will watch MTV, adopt black fashion styles and listen only to black music. She will usually become overweight, adopting the poor eating habits and the attitude that &#8220;thick is good&#8221; from her black peers. She will act fully black in every way imaginable, even speaking with a &#8220;blackcent.&#8221; Once the transformation is complete, a black male comes in for the kill and impregnates her. Of course, she&rsquo;ll give the child some ridiculous name like Demario or Quandrell. I see it happening all the time, it happened to half the girls with whom I went to school. There are always these common themes: the girl&rsquo;s family is either uninvolved or working so much that they can&rsquo;t be concerned with what the kid is doing, they send their kids to an integrated school because they can&rsquo;t afford a private one, MTV/school indoctrination machine, what they see as &#8220;acceptance&#8221; and &#8220;love&#8221; from black culture where they feel shunned by the own families and are told by the media that whites are evil, etc. For these girls, having a biracial baby is a way of becoming fully black.</p>
<p>My husband argues that there is nothing wrong with this phenomenon, that if a woman is weak-willed and sick enough to do this that it&rsquo;s best for her to remove herself from the gene pool anyway. I don&rsquo;t agree. My best friend growing up was a beautiful white girl and she was smart too, probably a good bit smarter than most her peers (who in elementary school were close to 100% white). I really believed then that she would make something of herself, that we both would. Once adolescence hit, she totally changed. She told me that her mother neglected her and that her step-father was abusive. Neither seemed very involved in her education or her problems. Eventually, we grew apart and I didn&rsquo;t see her until 10 years later. Now she is addicted to drugs and has three biracial children with three different &#8220;baby daddy.&#8221; She is living on welfare in some run down apartment in a black neighborhood. What a life. I think that she, and many other girls, could have been saved if only the family had been more involved!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always the same tragic story. I don&rsquo;t believe that these girls were &#8220;throwaways&#8221; - instead, I believe that their families failed them and they were lost to one of the most powerful propaganda machines the world has ever witnessed. I imagine how much these girls were a victim of circumstance, how surely, their white ancestors are probably rolling their graves knowing that their descendants are now black. Of course, I&rsquo;m simplifying something that is very complex and is occurring for a number of reasons but that family element is so very essential. If you don&rsquo;t instill in your child a sense of white racial pride, then it will be very easy for all that propaganda to work. </p>
<p>To conclude, if you aren&rsquo;t seeing this phenomenon now you will soon enough. It is coming to a neighborhood near you. My husband and I even play a little game when we&rsquo;re at the store and see white women, &#8220;Guess the race of the baby in the stroller&#8221; and unfortunately, I&rsquo;d say that we have a 90% accuracy race when we guess &#8220;biracial.&#8221;<br/>

Your aunt and first cousins would be White, not mestizo even though they would have some Hispanic background.

Nice post, MM&hellip;I totally agree. We have to only care about our own racial survival because it is the White race that is falling. (9% of the total world population??) That is horrid! Then think about when half of that 9% dies (50 yrs and older) then what? It is Whites only that are being vilified, oppressed, and hated in their OWN lands, for pete&rsquo;s sake!  I don&rsquo;t care about the black, mexican, Asian or any other race surviving and growing their numbers ever larger than what they are now. Our altruism should be for our own race and no other. It was place in the White race for a reason. To do and care about their own people and not like it is now with them going all over the world and giving aid and comfort to those who hate our guts. And YES, they do hate us and envy us at the same time. </p>

In Soviet America, interracial marriage can only be described in positive, glowing terms.  Any journalist who attempts to contradict the lies and exaggerations would be unceremoniously fired.  Let freedom ring. </p>
<p>Thanks to Hollywood, the black male has become appealing to white females.  The silver screen black male is strong, sensitive, witty, resourceful, trustworthy and always seems to be outsmarting and outfighting white males.  And to top it off he&rsquo;s also great at sex, an urban legend that, sadly, a growing number of young white females are willing to put to the test. White males, by contrast, are mere mortals in the presence of the god like black male.  </p>
<p>In spite of the massive interracial propaganda it still seems the vast majority of whites are reluctant to marry outside of their race.  Let&rsquo;s hope sanity continues to prevail among our people.      <br/>

<p>The White population is probably below a billion and Whites have very low birthrates. And I would put the east Asian population several hundreds of millions higher then your figure. Nor are your countries being inundated by people of differing other races.</p>

		<p>#42, I agree that whites (or Asians) are in no danger of disappearing.  There&rsquo;s such a thing as survival of the fittest.  Those of African and Australoid ancestry are engaging in behaviors such as wholesale murder, drug addiction, and the spreading of deadly diseases that are reducing their numbers.  Without aid provided by the lighter races, threats like famine, drought, and resource mismanagement would kill millions in the third world.  And, if push comes to shove, this aid won&rsquo;t be there for them.  The same goes for much of the mestizo population.</p>

		<p>&#8220;So what? Whites are actually the 2nd most numerous race on the planet. There are about 1.3 to 1.4 billion East Asians, and 1.1 to 1.2 billion whites. Whites are playing in the same ballpark as East Asians. And East Asians are now reproducing at rates which are not any higher than that of whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s over 1.3 billion people just in China. If we just count what&rsquo;s considered the Far East, leaving out Bangladesh and everything west of it, I come up with 2.3 billion oriental Asians.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are about 200 million more whites than there are people of black African descent in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>The population of Sub-Saharan Africa was 800 million in 2007. <br/>
The current growth rate is 2.3%. The UN predicts for the region a population of nearly 1.5 billion in 2050 while Europe is predicted to shrink by 150 million.  </p>
<p>&#8220;I have two children with a white American woman. They are doing fine - both good looking and intelligent. They don&rsquo;t have any identity problems at all. They attend an international school here in HK, and some of their peers are also mixed.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny, I can&rsquo;t ever remember a parent with a mixed race kid ever admitting there were problems with them.  I would be shocked if they did.  It&rsquo;s easier to live in denial than admit they made a mistake.  If you want to focus on the particulars of mixed White/oriental children, they tend to be shy and withdrawn.  In a school environment they tend to keep to themselves and as they get older they find social situations increasingly awkward.  Having a healthy normal social life becomes exceedingly difficult and many of them will turn homosexual for lack of girlfriends. Many of these kids are walking time bombs just waiting to go off, perhaps in some kind of university shooting.  Maybe it is different for your kids living in Hong Kong being surrounded by people who look like them.  Most nonwhite kids as a rule look like their nonwhite parents.     </p>

<p>If 46&rsquo;s stats are correct re Sub Saharan Africa, that means there are more black Africans in sub-Saharan Africa than there are white people in the entire world.  There are also more Han Chinese in China than there are whites in the entire world, and more Indians in India than there are whites in the entire world.  So you&rsquo;re over-counting the white population, and giving them an overall rank too high.</p>
<p>Where you may be correct is the misplaced fear among some of us that we&rsquo;re getting too minute in terms of percentage of the world&rsquo;s population.  I&rsquo;m more worried about white control over heretofore white territory; take care of that, and it almost doesn&rsquo;t matter how many Chinese in China, Indians in India or blacks in Africa there are.</p>

<p>There are a lot of &#8216;white&rsquo; Americans with Spanish last names that go way back to the days of the Mexican Cession.  As long as there are opportunities for assimilation, that sort of thing works.</p>
<p>I think the thing that alarms us the most, on this board and in general, is that assimilation has broken down with the floodgates of immigration since 1965.</p>

		<p>One other thing, some posters have mentioned how some &#8216;hispanics&rsquo; are 100% white.  I personally know some people from Argentina and a few other places whose parents were originally from Italy or England or elsewhere.  It is so weird to lump them together with hispanics, even though they adopted the culture and language, they are not genetically the people.</p>

		<p>35-Jenn: You nailed it.  From my own experience - Neighbor girl, White, kind, smart, friendly, even talkative.  Her parents were divorced and she stayed with her alcoholic, semi-employed  father. Her father was vehemently anti-black, but once the daughter got into high school, he caught on with a black gang of some sort.  Fast forward to today: Father remains no-where, and the daughter has three mixed race children by who knows. The last time I spoke with her, her eyes were blank and distant, she didn&rsquo;t (or couldn&rsquo;t) look at me.  She spoke in a flat tone, commenting about how hard it is on welfare.  I will never forgive myself for not doing more to assist her in life.</p>

		<p><i>American Renaissance</i> has posted articles on miscegnation in the past. I commented on several of those articles, stating my opinion objectively. Surprisingly, <i>all</i> of my comments were censored, even though I did not include any obscenities or insults, which the guidelines prohibit. Thus, I conclude that <i>American Renaissance</i> censored my comments because they merely didn&rsquo;t like my opinion, not because I resorted to obscenities or insults.</p>
<p>Uh, moderators &mdash; why do you have such a big problem allowing me to express my opinion on this forum? You&rsquo;re the type of people who would criticize political correctness because of its censorship of dissenting opinions; but when you&rsquo;re in control, as on <i>American Renaissance,</i> you seem to conform to the same behavior: censoring opinions that dissent from your views.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I am someone who married outside of my race. I married a wonderful woman from Vietnam. I love her very much. We have two daughters.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find a white American woman who had any moral values. I was in my mid-twenties when I finally gave up on American women and married a foreign woman from another race and culture. Trying to find an American woman (or even a foreign European woman) in her mid-twenties who was still a virgin, like me, was like trying to find a needle in a haystack, even among the ones with weight problems. I had no problem finding an Asian woman who valued me enough to not sleep with other men.</p>
<p>American women <i>say</i> they want to find a decent guy who will treat them right. Of course, their actions clearly demonstrate otherwise. Once they finally realize that dating someone like me isn&rsquo;t so horrible, they&rsquo;ve had countless sex partners. Is it not appropriate for me to feel indignant?</p>
<p>Many of my friends suggested that I meet an American woman at a church for marriage, because it would be more likely that I would find the type of woman I was searching for. However, as someone who doesn&rsquo;t subscribe to any religious belief &mdash; and also has animosity towards Christianity in particular &mdash; it is doubtful that any of those women would want to date me.</p>
<p>Unwholesome premarital behavior is not the only issue I have with Western women. American women want to focus too much on their careers at the expense of their family. Also, American women have abandoned their femininity and traditional gender role.</p>
<p>The only argument people have put forth on this forum to oppose miscegnation is for racial preservation purposes. Uh, did any of you actually read the statistics? Only 14.6% of marriages were interracial, many involving parters who were both non-white. Those numbers are not large enough to dilute the white gene pool.</p>

		<p>I always like to seek truth from facts. </p>
<p>Here are the facts:</p>
<p>Whites in the world:</p>
<p>Europe	        800000000<br/>
Australia	16000000<br/>
New Zealand	2,609,592<br/>
South Africa	4,472,100<br/>
United States	230000000<br/>
Canada	        28000000<br/>
South America (unmixed whites)	190000000<br/>
Total number whites <b>1271081692</b></p>
<p>East Asians in the world:</p>
<p>Chinese	              1,324,655,000<br/>
Japanese	      127,704,000<br/>
Koreans	              72000000<br/>
Diaspora East Asians  40000000<br/>
Total number East Asians: <b>1,564,359,000</b></p>
<p>Black Africans:</p>
<p>Sub-saharan Africa 800000000<br/>
South America	   100000000<br/>
United States	   37,586,050<br/>
Total number black Africans:  <b>937586050</b></p>
<p>Of course there are a few sundry populations here and there of whites, asians, and blacks I have left out, but they would not change the overall picture.</p>
<p>Based on the numbers above, in terms of number of people:</p>
<p>East Asians &gt; Whites &gt; black Africans</p>
<p>Blacks are about 74% the white population, and whites are 81% the East Asian population.</p>

<p>Yes, that is true. But then East Asians are quite genetically distinct from South East Asians such as Malays and Phillipinos.</p>
<p>If you want to do an overall <i>Mongoloid</i> count then yes your figure of 2.3 billion could well be correct. </p>
<p>But if you want to discuss numbers in terms of macro-races then comparing Mongoloid numbers with just those populations you consider &#8216;white&rsquo; would be like comparing apples with oranges.</p>
<p>Just considering the populations of North Africa, the Middle East, and the subcontinent and adding these to &#8216;whites&rsquo;, would show you that there are many more Caucasoids on the planet than Mongoloids.<br/>

I see two different groups of white women with black men.</p>
<p>One is the overweight to slightly overweight young girl who likely has self esteem issues. She&rsquo;s easy prey for a sweet talking black man who showers her with the attention that white males aren&rsquo;t willing to invest.</p>
<p>The second is (sorry for the crude term) the &#8216;slut&rsquo;. These are the women who dress in flashy and skimpy outfits and seem to go out of their way to be sexually aggressive towards black males.</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve noticed about black men is that they take a swing at any and every white girl they see. For example, I was on the bus on my way to work and a black man got on the bus and immediately sat next to a white girl (who he apparently didn&rsquo;t know) and began hitting on her. After a few stops, another white girl got on the bus and he left the first white girl to talk to the second (who he apparently didn&rsquo;t know). When he got off the bus downtown, he immediately stopped to talk to a third white girl who was alone.</p>
<p>Black males play the numbers game. They hit on every girl they see. No matter how many misses, taking that many swings guarantees an occasional home run.</p>
<p>When I was younger and went to bars and clubs, I would see white males taking multiple swings at the plate but out in public, I don&rsquo;t see white males as sexually agressive as black males.</p>

		<p>I am Jewish.  My sister is married to wonderful man of Ukrainian heritage and a Roman Catholic.  They have two beautiful white children.</p>
<p>This August, my nephew is going to marry a beautiful white woman who is a minister.  Who has done ministry work in India.</p>
<p>In such interfaith marriages, their offspring can either decide to convert to Judaism or convert to Christianity, or be as I am, by not practising any religion.  I am a member of The Freedom from Religion Foundation.  But in any case, still assimilate into white society.</p>
<p>I grew up with having to endure such traumas as early male-pattern baldness, at age 14, long before the advent of rogaine and monoxidil, learning disabilities, hearing and visual problems, and poor coordination.  I had not yet gotten my driver&rsquo;s license at age 18, my mother furiously objected to my learning to drive because of my coordination disabilities, until me father stepped in on my side.  I finally did get my driver&rsquo;s license, at 18, in December of 1974. </p>
<p>Anyway, because of my physical and mental disabilities I was extremely angry at my parents for bringing me into this world for many years.  I even had powerful, extreme anti-semitic feelings to blame all my physical and mental disabiliies on being Jewish.  Even though now I fully understand that physical and mental disabilites, and even male-pattern baldness do not just happen to Jews.</p>
<p>But you may ask &#8220;What does this information about yourself have to do with inter-racial marriage?&#8221;</p>
<p>I often say &#8220;Try this for size.&#8221;  Because of what I had to go through in my youth, I cannot help but mourn and feel extremely sorry for people who are born to a white mother and a black father.  Through no fault of their own, such offspring of these kind of inter-racial marriages are unjustly robbed of their white heritage!  They are often rejected by both the black and white races.</p>
<p>Readers of American Renaissance are well aware of the racial powder keg our country is in.  Through no fault of their own, the children of black-white marriages are stuck in the middle of an extremely terrible cross fire!</p>

<p>What a load of bunk!  Mixed race kids 99 percent of the time look like the nonwhite parent.  Those rare times that they do look White they are positioned into the public spotlight, sports heros, movie actors, etc. to give the public a false impression of miscegenation as being less destructive than it really is.

<p>&#8220;Can someone look up the domostic violence and divorce rates of interracial marriages. </p>
<p>Once a people has lost its women the the people shall exist no more. Time to step up white men. Quit being haters and with your women back. Protect them, provide for them, entertain them, listen to them, pleasure them and most of all appreciate them. If you don&rsquo;t someone else will. And that someone is more than likely not white. &#8220;</p>
<p>Is everyone laughing at this post?  The spelling and word choices reflect the dumbing down and ignorance we are all too familiar with.  Apparently, this guy is not old enough to remember much recent social history.  One of Ophra Winfrey&rsquo;s first programs was about black women who preferred white men.  They reason they gave was that black men were violent and unreliable, while white men were the opposite and had gentle dispositions.  So why did the white women leave such white men?  </p>
<p>When white men were being nice is when white women were heading out the door.  I was there.  It is the feminist movement that created anti-white male hating, not white males hating.  I am a case in point.  I had no resentment toward any race, I was raised that way and it was reinforced by the Lutheran church.  It was my experiences and observations later that changed me, including the rise of anti-male feminism.  They combined with the American Socialist Movement and they are still at work.  The reason there is so much race mixing today is that it is pushed constantly in the media, while anything that can be used to denigrate the white male is subtley applied.<br/>

		<p>The only good thing I can see for the future of America in these intermarriage statistics is the high percentage of Hispanics who are marrying (mainly) Whites. If a significant percentage of the coming generations of Hispanics can think of themselves more as mixed race Americans than as Hispanics it will work against the balkanization that is killing us. Of course this is only a hope and a faint one at that. But it&rsquo;s something.</p>

		<p>To MM and the poster who agreed with MM.  I appreciate your input and feedback.  However, the only reason I went into other races being beautiful is because sometimes we need to use arguments like that to make our cases stronger.  If you think about it, by using nonwhites as an example and pointing out the double standard, I was actually making a good point.  I am most certainly not a push over on this topic and I never said nonwhites belong in our countries.  What is wrong with making the case that whites should be preserved in their own lands just as nonwhites should in their own lands?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Anyhow, I am someone who married outside of my race. I married a wonderful woman from Vietnam. I love her very much. We have two daughters.&#8221;</p>
<p>I read your post and something doesn&rsquo;t add up.  You can&rsquo;t tell us that most white women are not worthy of marriage (which is what you seem to imply through your experience at least) while at the same time acknowledging that most white men marry white women ( as you reveal with the statistics you quote from the article).  You lose credibility here because you admit that most white men disagree with you.  Most white men obviously haven&rsquo;t had a hard time finding a white woman so what is your point?</p>
<p>I love the way some men on this website enjoy trash talking about white women as if we have the same negative traits as many minority women (such as black women etc&hellip;).  How absurd. Don&rsquo;t act like you care about the white race while coming on here and speaking such nonsense.  It only tells me that you are the one with the short coming.</p>
<p>And for the record, I am very much opposed to radical feminism and I would probably shock very many of you on here with my views on a woman&rsquo;s role.</p>

		<p>The topic of who is white has shifted and changed over the years.  Many proudly declare that Spanish people from Spain are &#8216;white&rsquo; but then they deride other groups that could loosely be lumped in with whites.</p>
<p>Think about it, the Spanish from Spain have A LOT of Arab and Berber in them from the 800 years of Arab rule.  After the reconquista, a huge number of these darker Spaniards chose to (or were forced to) convert to Catholicism and they remained in Spain.  A lot of Jews were in the same pickle.</p>
<p>So if Spanish people are really mestizos (Visigoth/Basques/Romans/Arabs/Berbers) then how can we criticize whitish hispanics as not being white enough?  Italians are in the same boat here, with many looking exotic and dark with Mediterannean overtones.  The further east you go in Russia, the more you find people with blond hair, yet asian facial features.<br/>

		<p>What ever became of Michael J. Polignano, the Race Realist who was harrassed at Emory University?  </p>
<p>(Why would a Race Realist ever attend Emory? To prove all theories true? It&rsquo;s near enough to Decatur and Atlanta for plenty of evidence.)</p>

It must be realised that acts of miscegenation will ruin thousands of years of racial/ethnic heritage not just for White people but for every race. Michael J. Polignano argues that a &lsquo;race&rsquo;s unique genetic identity will be maintained only as long as it remains genetically separate and exclusive, breeding within itself and not breeding with other races. Miscegenation undoes this. Thus it destroys millennia of racial evolution. The genes are not lost, per se, just as no paint molecules are lost when different colors of paint are mixed. But it would take millennia to re-isolate gene types that can be spread out among a miscegenated population in just one generation of crossbreeding&rsquo;.</p>

<p>&#8221; I don&rsquo;t see White maless as sexually aggressive as Black males.&#8221; </p>
<p>Are you for real? How old are you? You must be in your mid to late 40s or older. All you have to do is go to any bar in amy major city and you will see young White males targeting any attractive young (and in some cases, not so attractive) woman in their vicinity. </p>
<p>Young White men are just as sexually aggressive as non-White men. </p>
