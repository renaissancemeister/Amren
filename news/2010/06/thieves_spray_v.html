			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Teri Pecoskie, Toronto Star, May 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Toronto police are searching for suspects after several people reported being squirted with feces and then robbed.</p>
<p>Police say the suspects strike after their victims make ATM withdrawals.</p>
<p>First, one suspect walks up behind the victim and shoots feces at them from a squirt bottle.</p>
<p>The second suspect then offers to help by holding the victim&rsquo;s purse or jacket while they clean themselves off, before allegedly fleeing with the items.</p>
<p>&#8220;They try to get the victim in a place where they&rsquo;re alone, so even if they yell, no one can hear them,&#8221; said Det. David Barwell.</p>
<p>Barwell said there have been four such incidents at banks in the financial district in the past week.</p>
<p>He said crimes like this are typically carried out by transient groups that are both &#8220;practiced and organized.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re also usually pretty adept pickpockets,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&rsquo;re trying to get people to free up their arms.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Barwell has never heard of groups using feces before, he said the robbery technique is not unique.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ketchup bandits did the same thing,&#8221; he said. Barwell said police haven&rsquo;t analyzed the feces, but &#8220;the running belief&#8221; is that it&rsquo;s human.</p>
<p>Investigators are looking for at least four suspects who are all described as Hispanic and who police say, &#8220;could be in the possession of squeeze bottles or containers of feces.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Third World confidence gangs are working Canadian cities, using techniques refined in other parts of the world. </p>
<p>Multiculturalism is to blame, and Toronto is ground zero, with almost half the city being non-white.</p>

		<p>I was in the local supermarket about two weeks ago. There were a group of Hispanic men and two White men. The White men worked at the store.</p>
<p>The two Hispanic men were engaged in an argument with the two White men. They were loud, combative and were making a scene. The fact that they were speking spanish I could not understand what they were saying. I was very nervous and angry to see such a spectacle.</p>
<p>The fact is that Hispanics are going to be more problems than Blacks ever were. </p>

		<p>To #3: I at first believed Hispanics when they said all they wanted was the Southwest back, as it was &#8220;stolen&#8221; from them.  Okay, fine.  Have back Colorado, California, Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona I thought.  However, the fact they spread to states that had NO hispanics in it and now that they&rsquo;re moving to Canada to spread their Latino supremacy spells invasion.  I hope our white brothers in Canada run them out of Canada soon.</p>

<p>Per Wiki, Toronto&rsquo;s &#8220;Latin American&#8221; &#8220;community&#8221; is only 2.6%. Despite the diverse diverseness of the diversity in Canada&rsquo;s #1 city, with fully HALF of the city&rsquo;s citizens now foreign born, hispanics remain mercifully rare. </p>
<p>This I credit primarily to the fact that your average mestizo couldn&rsquo;t locate Canada on a map of North America with the US and Mexico already labeled. To them, the thing called &#8220;Canada&#8221; is, at best, a hazy concept: some sort of Extra-Gringo Gringoland somewhere up beyond Regular Gringoland (AKA &#8220;Estados Unidos&#8221; or &#8220;El Norte&#8221;.) </p>
<p>But even so, this tiny and only-recently-arrived minority have already established some sort of MS-13 presence in Canadian cities&hellip; and now have also innovated the DISGUSTING AND DANGEROUS new form of street robbery described in this article. </p>
<p>21st Century Canada:  A place where a newsmagazine reporting Muslim birthrates qualifies as a &#8220;Hatecrime&#8221;&hellip; but browns assaulting whites with feces while robbing them, does not. <br>

		<p>#3 is right about Hispanics being more trouble than blacks.  While there are many American-born people of Latin heritage who are law-abiding and patriotic, too many foreign-born ones are anti-American, anti-Anglo third-worlders who are barely civilized.  They don&rsquo;t know how to live in a country where brutality is not the order of the day, and many just figure they&rsquo;ll run roughshod over peaceful American citizens.</p>

		<p>But I thought our diversity was our strength.  I have noticed many more Hispanics flooding our major Canadian cities these last few years&hellip;unskilled, uneducated and with a brood of offspring in tow.  What could possibly go wrong with this?  It sure is working for the US.<br>
I think, in all honesty, that our politicians and intellectual elites should one day be held accountable for the irreparable harm being done to my country, culture and people because of mass, Third World immigration.  Our wages being held down artificially, urban and suburban sprawl, crime, social benefits, intangible costs such as disintegrating social fabric and fracturing of societies&hellip;how has Canada benefited from this?</p>

<p>Just as with blacks, they prefer to head for fresh new places where there aren&rsquo;t (yet) very many of their own kind. How odd that they don&rsquo;t really want to be around their own   &mdash;   too many problems,  too much crime and squalor    &mdash;  - they want to GET AWAY from their own.  They want to live where YOU are.</p>
<p>You have such nice cities and neighborhoods!  Of course, everyone [who&rsquo;s been to school] knows that you have &#8220;stolen&#8221; these things from them, that your countries have been built by black and latino labor. They just want them back, that&rsquo;s all. It&rsquo;s a matter of simple justice.</p>

<p>Amen to that.  I couldn&rsquo;t agree more. I want to see trials. And punishments!!!</p>

		<p>Why on earth do they follow whites into our nice neighborhoods, even far north as Anchorage, AL?  I saw a special on gangs in LA and how they have migrated as far north as Anchorage to set up drug trade there.  The history channel should be ashamed to give these thugs airtime and add to their already overblown egos.  A portion of this special featured a special dance that Crips do, called &#8220;cripping&#8221;.  A spear-chunking, jungle dance if I ever saw one!  The black look absolutely ridiculous with that congo-interior dance that only showed his wild animal nature.  I would like to see how many blacks or browns are in the town of Barrow, AL, which is the most northern town in AL.  There the winter night is months long, so I don&rsquo;t think blacks could stand that.  The white liberals who have brought in this diversity should be reaping what they have sown instead of we regular white people.  They want us to live among blacks, but I daresay you won&rsquo;t find them living among blacks.</p>
