			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David D. Dawson, Charlotte Post, June 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Motorsport&rsquo;s racial discrimination in the stands and on the track is well documented. However, with Max Siegel at the helm of Drive for Diversity, NASCAR&rsquo;s competition diversity program, that perception may be changing.</p>
<p>Siegel is the former president of global operations at Dale Earnhardt Inc., where he made history as the highest-ranking African-American executive in NASCAR.</p>
<p>Siegel, an accomplished African-American lawyer and sports and entertainment mogul, touts that NASCAR is an open and welcoming sport. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Siegel and his partners exemplify that passion by using new and conventional marketing tactics to introduce and educate the African-American community about the sport.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a big youth initiative. We will bring over 100 kids in for a week to our facility in Charlotte. We have a technology center and they&rsquo;ll be there for a week of summer camp. We&rsquo;ll introduce them to simulated racing, the franchise and the profession,&#8221; said Siegel.</p>
<p>Revolution Racing, a race team that Siegel owns and operates with former vice-president of DEI, John Story, was created to develop female and minority drivers and crew in an academy style. Revolution Racing&rsquo;s drivers and crew members participate in NASCAR&rsquo;s Drive For Diversity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I noticed, with young drivers that did not have media exposure, especially drivers of color, they needed an opportunity to tell their stories in a compelling way. Get them a media platform where they&rsquo;re exposed to the public and give a reason for a sponsor to invest in them. So I wanted to give an &#8216;American Idol&rsquo; meets &#8216;The Apprentice&rsquo; where I went out and try to find the next female or driver of color,&#8221; explained Siegel.</p>
<p>After he pitched the show to executives, BET picked the show up and partnered with a NASCAR media group as well as Ken Mok, who created the reality show, &#8220;America&rsquo;s Next Top Model.&#8221;</p>
<p>He wants viewers to learn what it takes to be involved in the sport, show the sacrifices and character of the young drivers who made an enormous investment in the sport and to celebrate the accomplishments of people of color, who are currently in the sport.</p>
<p>The Indianapolis native has partnered with other prominent African-Americans to push for diversity in motorsports. Actor and rap artist Ludacris is one of Siegel&rsquo;s partners and is doing voiceovers on the show. Media personalities Tom Joyner and Tavis Smiley are also supporters of his endeavors.</p>

		<p>We boycott NASCAR and all its sponsors, as should the entirety of White Humanity.</p>
<p>If they start getting a bunch of high testosterone, low IQ black drivers, the injury and death rates on race tracks will increase dramatically.  Blacks are careless in cars, and their overconfidence is instilled in them through constant coddling by Whites that makes them exceedingly dangerous at 160 mph.</p>
<p>Worse yet, if the blacks don&rsquo;t win their &#8220;fair share&#8221; of races, then we will see Whites handicapped in an effort to &#8220;do the right thing by atoning for the sins of segregation.&#8221;</p>
<p>I hope it happens.  Would love to see bunch of White country boys yell, &#8220;Hot jump&rsquo;n dang! We did the right thing and let that black win another race! Let&rsquo;s go congratulate by  holding ourselves accountable to people of color for our unearned White privilege.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, David D. Dawson, I guess that lets you off the hook for actually providing any proof of your sweeping assertions, doesn&rsquo;t it?  Nor will you be expected to tell us <i>why</i> the matter is so terribly, terribly urgent. Well, don&rsquo;t worry.  Diversiphiles are <i>never</i> required to come up with hard evidence to support their religion.</p>
<p>Really, this article has been   &mdash;   and probably will continue to be   &mdash;   run in hundreds of variants throughout the controlled governmedia.  Just build your own article around the theme &#8220;There aren&rsquo;t enough African-Americans in ; it&rsquo;s all because of Evil White Racism, and we&rsquo;ve gotta do something about it <i>right now</i>.</p>
<p>See how easy it is?<br>

Max can promote Nascar all he likes, but few blacks will ever be attracted to the sport,especially as competitors.</p>
<p>Why do I say this?</p>
<p>Because they have an aversion to extreme sports and related activities.</p>
<p>How often do you see blacks participating in activities that risk personal safety? Activities like sky diving, cliff diving, bungy jumping, rock climbing, messing with sharks, outdoor survival, wrestling alligators, handling dangerous snakes and the like? </p>
<p>And that includes driving aound a racetrack at 180 mph. I mean, speed can kill,- right? </p>
<p>No need to worry&hellip;</p>

		<p>Well documented discrimination in NASCAR? Are you kidding me?! A couple of years ago there were plans from a news outlet leaked about sending minorities to NASCAR events to see if they were treated poorly. They were treated as <br>
nicely as everyone else and the plan for the show fell through. The only possible thing that could even possibly be considered discrimination might be that NASCAR has few black attendees, or even the Confederate battle flag display, which I think has now been banned at any official events.</p>

		<p>Why are the white Southerners who run Nascar so determined to &#8220;diversify&#8221; the sport?  Why do virtually all elite whites hate their own people?  You might think that the people running Nascar would have similar attitudes as the fans.  That seems to be true about rich and powerful blacks, Jews, Indians, Muslims etc.  They seem to have the same level of ethnocentrism as their people in general.  With whites, the higher up the income/power/status scale you go, the less loyalty they have to their own people.  If America&rsquo;s leaders had even the same low level of ethnocentrism as the average white American on the street, we would have avoided most of the problems we are having now.  </p>

<p>It is?  By whom exactly?  White people have always been the pioneers of motorsport and the majority of the fans as well.  The things that keep blacks out of motorsport are the same things that keep whites out.  Lack of money or connections.  In other countries motor racing is looked at like a real sport, young talent is fostered to become professional.  This is just another case of forming a solution when there is no problem.</p>

		<p>Two things that have always impressed me about the NASCAR circuit, even though I&rsquo;m not a fan:</p>
<p>1.  When the race starts, in the first few laps, drivers can be driving well over 150 mph, but they&rsquo;re all in a big pack with only inches of separation between each car.</p>
<p>2.  Obviously, every driver wants to finish in the best possible position he can, but I have noticed that a lot of drivers who don&rsquo;t have much of a chance to finish very high will often make sacrifices to help a team mate who is in a good spot finish better than he otherwise would.</p>
<p>So you have consideration, altruism and self-sacrifice.  How many black drivers does that describe?</p>

		<p>The &#8220;well-documented incidents of discrimination&#8221; apparently stems from the fact that LeBron James went to a NASCAR race a couple of years ago, and was shocked to see some fans were waving around Confederate flags.</p>
<p>NASCAR also had a female Bantu track official (that was her &#8220;dream job&#8221;, believe it or not), sue NASCAR on the grounds of racial and sexual harassment. She won her case, and NASCAR had to pay her an undisclosed amount of money.</p>
<p>NASCAR can save $ 20-25 million easy, by scrapping its Drive For Diversity program and canning Max Siegel. It&rsquo;s struggling to hang on to keep its bread and butter fan base, which happens to be Caucasian - what makes them think blacks will pick up the slack, especially in an economy like this?</p>

		<p>My husband, a Southerner, is an avid NASCAR fan. I&rsquo;m from the North, but I&rsquo;ve developed a liking for the sport, although not to the same extent as my husband. </p>
<p>NASCAR has benn taken over the big corporations. I&rsquo;m sure it was a lot more fun in its early days. <br>
 <br>
Anyway, we were watching a race a week or two ago that had something like 140,000 fans in the stands. I commented to my husband that it was &#8220;interesting&#8221; that there were no fights, stabbings, shootings, etc. </p>
<p>The last thing NASCAR needs is diversity!  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s amazing to watch these people going so far out of their way to locate and train black kids for an expected eventual takeover of NASCAR.  It&rsquo;s as if whites are planning to disappear from everywhere and everything and the businesses just want to make sure they will survive, financially.  Oops, tipped the entire Western World&rsquo;s national government adgendas here!</p>

		<p>I suspect they&rsquo;ll be looking for a &#8220;tiger woods&#8221; or a &#8220;venus williams&#8221; to shove into a car. But as we&rsquo;ve seen that doesn&rsquo;t really work out very well because whoever wins that ghetto lottery will still act poorly. And it still won&rsquo;t attract any black fans. At least, I haven&rsquo;t seen many blacks showing up to watch golf and tennis. But at least those NASCAR execs can brag about how they &#8220;integrated NASCAR&#8221; when they go to all the cool cocktail parties.</p>

		<p>When the tv cameras scan the stands at a nascar event, and they see not a single black face, the ONLY conclusion they can have is that it must be because of discrimination? Are the track operators refusing to sell tickets to blacks? white fans are conspiring to buy all the tickets? the event is kept secret from blacks? the concession stands only serve &#8220;white friendly&#8221; items? it couldn&rsquo;t be possible that maybe black folks don&rsquo;t care for the sport? <br>
this scenario is true in all aspects of society, if blacks are under-represented in some segment, the only possible reason is &#8220;whites be rassisst&#8221;, if black test scores are substantially lower than all others, the only acceptable explanation is it&rsquo;s because of white racism/discrimination/prejudice/bigotry, you are not allowed to suggest the problem lies within blacks, they are the teflon race  </p>

		<p>Racing is more cerebral than fast action sports like basketball and football where the lead is constnatly changing and there is something happening every second. In racing, for example, pit stop strategy and car set up can mean the person leading most of race can easily lose at the end because of the need to change tires or refuel (poor strategy) or because the track conditions change and the car is set up wrong (again often poor strategy). Racing fans know these things and have to keep track of many variables for each car to figure out where their favorites are in the race. Also like golf it is great to  win, but where one finishes in the race is also very important in determining standings and the season winner. This is just too much heavy lifting without immediate gratification for all but a few blacks to enjoy the sport and that is not going to change.</p>

		<p>At least half the joy all blacks derive from professional sports stem from a desire to be seen, to showboat and hot dog. That&rsquo;s great when you&rsquo;re dunking a basketball with your tongue out, or preening in the end zone. But if you&rsquo;re hidden inside a car, the ego factor is probably not large enough to attract blacks. How could you scream and throw a tantrum, a la black pro athletes, if you&rsquo;re inside of a car? </p>

		<p>I went to a high school with plenty of diversity, as it was located near a historic slave-trading market.</p>
<p>Although blacks have no interest in NASCAR, it was hilarious to see that NASCAR jackets became an object of status among blacks.  Leather jackets bearing NASCAR logos and even Looney Tunes characters (both of which seem very out of place in black &#8220;culture&#8221;) quickly rose to popularity strictly among black ghetto children.  </p>
<p>The best explanation I heard for the phenomenon was that the NASCAR and Looney Tunes jackets were expensive.  </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t doubt that blacks could be represented fairly proportionally in NASCAR were they interested in the sport, which I rather doubt that they are. I&rsquo;m from the Philly area, where the motorcycle bro&rsquo;s all ride big bore sport bikes rather than Harleys.  These bikes have the power-to-ratio not too far off that of an F-1 car (as opposed to a Hog, which has the power to weight ratio of a stock &#8216;57 Chevy), and the brothers around here ride like lunatics, doing two-block long wheelies, front wheel stoppies, wild smoky burnouts, and other stunts not exactly conducive to living to ripe a old age. Whatever they may be lacking in IQ, they don&rsquo;t seem to be lacking in nerve.</p>

		<p>I can see it all now. NASCAR introduces affirmative action racing. African American drivers get a half mile head start and don&rsquo;t need to qualify. There is the introduction of a quota system where at least 40 percent of the races must be won by <br>
African Americans, by whatever means.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t watch any sports, they are just a distraction to keep you from thinking. It&rsquo;s been done before, free bread and games to hold the mob&rsquo;s attention. If the people ever start to think those in power lose the advantage. </p>

		<p>To the posters who have seen blacks wearing red NASCAR jackets, and think it&rsquo;s a gang thing - I wouldn&rsquo;t doubt it. Maybe it&rsquo;s Bloods affiliates who buy the jackets.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve posted before on this, but a huge reason NASCAR - or any form of motorsports - has never made inroads with blacks, is that the traditional methods of recruiting blacks in the stick and ball sports are absent in NASCAR. There are no high school or college auto racing teams, of course. It&rsquo;d be too hazardous and expensive to maintain.  Then, NASCAR isn&rsquo;t going to send recruiters into ghetto areas, in search of a &#8220;great black hope&#8221; like college recruiters for basketball and football programs do.</p>
<p>Racing schools are available, like the Skip Barber and Richard Petty racing schools, but they are expensive, and beyond the reach of most black families - particularly if they&rsquo;re on some form of public aid. Heck, a motorsports career takes a lot of money, even for Caucasians.</p>
<p>Motorsports tracks are huge venues, of course, and often are located in spacious suburban or rural areas. For example, Pocono Raceway is in Long Pond, PA and Atlanta Motor Speedway is actually in Hampton, GA - not Atlanta. A central city location is therefore, impractical. Indianapolis Speedway is actually located in Speedway, IN.</p>
<p>Unlike the stick and ball sports, NASCAR is heavily influenced by the economy, due to its relationship with the auto industry, and sponsors. Baseball players will still collect their salaries, regardless of how automakers perform. NASCAR doesn&rsquo;t have that luxury.</p>
<p>NASCAR often has black entertainers sing the national anthem, or serve as grand marshals prior to the start of a race. These entertainers know that a NASCAR venue is the largest crowd that will ever see them perform, so they are only too happy to do it. So they just shut up and go along with it.</p>
<p>Max Siegel&rsquo;s ultimate goal is to run NASCAR. He&rsquo;ll have a fight on his hands with the France family, though.  </p>

		<p>What of all the other races of mankind?  Why would black participation in a white dominated sport somehow represent an ethnic balance?  Does black presence as the antithesis of whiteness cover for all of the races of mankind that don&rsquo;t partake of this endeavor?  </p>

		<p>To become involved in auto racing first and foremost one must have a fascination with mechanical things. One cannot isolate the athletic part from the mechanical part. Endless hours of tinkering and work are involved. The grass roots of auto racing is young men obsessed with cars who are willing to work on them hour after hour. Young families get their children involved in go cart, motocross, drag racing and stock car racing. The best of these advance. Many of the current NASCAR drivers began this way. Jeff Gordon is an example. He began very young as a go cart driver. His stepfather groomed him, and he had the ability.</p>
<p>Successful drivers at the highest level are constantly feeding <br>
back data about their car to the crew. This requires a complete understanding of the car. Blacks do not on average have the aptitude to master the workings of the race cars. They do not even have an interest in working on them. To say that they would want to become drivers without first understanding how the vehicles operate is ridiculous.</p>

		<p>There have been several black drivers in the NASCAR series. A guy named Bill Lester was the latest I believe. He didn&rsquo;t perform very well.<br>
The &#8220;discrimination&#8221; stuff at races is totally nonsense. I&rsquo;ve been to several tracks and have seen black fans enjoying the race just like everyone else. The worst behaviour is usually alcohol fueled, childish nonsense.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been to at least one Cup race every year since &#8216;99 or 2000.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been trying this since at least back then and it hasn&rsquo;t worked.  As someone else said it takes more than a ball and an empty parking lot to practice.  As DW (Darrel Waltrip) said, &#8220;What&rsquo;s the quickest way to make a small fortune in racing?  Start with a large one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Someone mentioned the last black driver Bill Lester.  He was already an anomaly in african-american culture.  He was an engineer, married to a black woman, a devoted father, and could speak English better than anyone else who was interviewed; not that he ever deserved to be interviewed because he routinely ran 30th or worse in the Truck Series.  Outside of him I have not heard of any &#8220;Lewis Hamiltons&#8221; (The mixed race former F1 champion who really ruins F1 for me some days).</p>
<p>Quick thought on the Nascar jackets.. Red was probably the Budweiser 8 or Junior&rsquo;s old ride.  Living close to Philadelphia I have seen blacks wearing Earnhardt Senior&rsquo;s jacket, Elliot&rsquo;s Sadler&rsquo;s M&M;&rsquo;s jacket, and I even think I&rsquo;ve seen one wearing a Mark Martin Viagra jacket.  Not ruling out the fact that a blood might have been wearing the red Budweiser jacket, but I&rsquo;ve always just thought that blacks like the Nascar jackets because they are so gaudy.  I know I don&rsquo;t wear my Lowe&rsquo;s Jimmie Johnson jacket out much because of that reason.  </p>
<p>As the Lady with the southern husband pointed out&hellip; 140,000 people together and no rapes and murders and very little fighting.  I mean precious little because I&rsquo;ve been to 26 Cup Races and plenty of the smaller BUSCH and Truck races and only seen one fight, and it turned out to be a stabbing.  Of course, the stabbing was pulled off by a white hiphopper and I doubt they were there for the race as it was the Saturday night before the race in Dover.  Ok make that twice as I saw a huge drunk guy try to take on the State Police in Richmond right in front of the stands during the race.  Needless to say but he didn&rsquo;t win but he gave a good fight.  </p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve always wondered what kind of crazy place the campground would turn into if we were to up the percentage of blacks even up to 10%?  But can you imagine what it would be like to have 15,000 blacks camping together and in and amongst whites?  It would be the death of NASCAR, at least NASCAR as something that you arrive at on Thursday or Friday and don&rsquo;t leave until Monday.  And don&rsquo;t forget on all the tracks on the east coast and middle America allow BYOB (bring your own beer).  Can you imagine 30,000 stereotypical black americans sitting in the stands where at some courses (Martinsville and Charlotte) one can take a case of beer inside?   From what I&rsquo;ve seen when dealing with inner-city blacks it doesn&rsquo;t take much more than 2 blacks and 2 40&rsquo;s of Malt-Liquor for murder to happen. </p>

<p>One &#8220;white&#8221; institution after another   &mdash;   from NASCAR to NASA to the GOP   &mdash;   keeps attempting these &#8220;outreach&#8221; programs to get more blacks interested. But these efforts are <i>always</i> a one-way street; the blacks never return the favor. </p>
<p>Well, I for one would like to see some reciprocation. When, oh when, will some black sports org   &mdash;   like, say, the Greater Detroit Dog-Fighting Ass&rsquo;n   &mdash;   do an outreach effort to get whites more interested in spending their Saturday nights betting $20 on which mean mutt will succeed in tearing his opponent to shreds in the parking lot of the local Projects? That&rsquo;s what <i>I&rsquo;d</i> like to know. </p>
