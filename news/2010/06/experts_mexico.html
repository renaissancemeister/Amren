			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chris Hawley, Arizona Republic (Phoenix), May. 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Arizona&rsquo;s new law directing local police to take a greater role in enforcing immigration rules has brought a lot of criticism from Mexico, the largest source of illegal immigrants in the United States. But, in Mexico, undocumented immigrants say they suffer even worse treatment from corrupt authorities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mexican police freely engage in racial profiling, harassing Central American migrants while ignoring thousands of American retirees living illegally in Mexico, immigration experts say.</p>
<p>Mexico already has an Arizona-style statute requiring local police to check IDs. That clause has fed an epidemic of kidnappings, rapes and other atrocities against migrants because victims are afraid to talk to police, Mexico&rsquo;s National Human Rights Commission says. A bill eliminating the rule has been stalled in the Mexican Senate since March.</p>
<p>Mexican officials say they&rsquo;ve been trying to improve treatment of immigrants by softening some of the most restrictive parts of Mexico&rsquo;s immigration law since 2008.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Dangerous territory</b></p>
<p>In one six-month period from September 2008 to February 2009, at least 9,758 migrants were kidnapped and held for ransom in Mexico, 91 of them with the direct participation of Mexican police, a report by the National Human Rights Commission says. Other migrants are routinely stopped and shaken down for bribes, it says.</p>
<p>A separate survey conducted during one month in 2008 at 10 migrant shelters showed Mexican authorities were behind migrant attacks in 35 of 240 cases, or 15 percent. Most of the abuses against migrants are committed by gangs and migrant smugglers.</p>
<p>Most migrants in Mexico are Central Americans passing through on their way to the United States, human-rights groups say. Others are Guatemalans who live and work along Mexico&rsquo;s southern border, mainly as farmworkers, maids, or in bars and restaurants.</p>
<p>One of the largest populations of illegal migrants in Mexico is made up of American retirees who enter as tourists, then overstay their visas, said Patricia de los Rios, director of the migrant-affairs program at Iberoamerican University in Mexico City. Some Americans even work in Mexico illegally, giving English lessons, running tourism-related businesses or telecommuting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Central American migrants headed to the United States travel mainly on freight trains, stopping to rest and beg for food at rail crossings like the one in Tultitlan, an industrial suburb of Mexico City.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Defying change</b></p>
<p>Abuses by Mexican authorities have persisted even as Mexico has relaxed its rules against illegal immigrants in recent years.</p>
<p>In 2008, the Mexican government softened the punishment for undocumented migrants, from a maximum 10 years in prison to a maximum fine of $461. Most detainees are simply taken to detention centers and put on buses for home.</p>
<p>Mexican law calls for six to 12 years of prison and up to $46,000 in fines for anyone who shelters or transports illegal immigrants, but the nation&rsquo;s Supreme Court ruled in March 2008 that the law applies only to people who do it for money.</p>
<p>For years, the Mexican government has allowed charity groups to openly operate migrant shelters, where travelers can rest for a few days on their journey north. The government also has a special unit of immigration agents, known as Grupo Beta, that patrols the countryside in orange pickup trucks, helping immigrants who are in trouble.</p>
<p>At the same time, however, Article 67 of Mexico&rsquo;s immigration law requires that all authorities, &#8220;whether federal, local or municipal,&#8221; demand to see visas if approached by a foreigner, and to hand over any undocumented migrants to immigration authorities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To discourage migrants from speaking out about abuse, Mexican authorities often tell detainees they will have to stay longer in detention centers if they file a complaint, said Vertíz, of the Human Rights Center.</p>
<p>A March 2007 order allows Mexican immigration agents to give &#8220;humanitarian visas&#8221; to migrants who have suffered crimes in Mexico.</p>

<p>These American retirees are but a tiny amount of Mexico&rsquo;s population. They don&rsquo;t get any welfare, don&rsquo;t commit crimes or compete for Mexican jobs or have kids and they contribute and spend a lot of money. No doubt whatsoever if millions of poor White Americans showed up at Mexico&rsquo;s border to cross illegally, Mexico would put their military on the borders with orders to shoot.</p>

___________</p>
<p>Well, the real reason the Mexican government is enforcing it&rsquo;s immigration laws against these central Americans is because they don&rsquo;t want their Mexican population living in the US to have competition for jobs here from fellow non-Mexican illegals.</p>

<p><br>
There was a whole article in an edition of the National Geographic devoted to this subject. The Central American &#8220;migrants&#8221; cling to the side of the train for hours on end riding north. Some fall and all you hear is a scream as the legs are severed. This goes on day after day, week after week, etc.</p>
<p>&#8220;if millions of poor White Americans showed up at Mexico&rsquo;s border to cross illegally&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, I have often wondered about this. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF A MILLION OR SO WHITEY EN MASSE ONE DAY AS A DEMONSTRATION DID APPEAR AT THE BORDER AND JUST CROSSED INTO MEXICO!</p>
<p>Cross the border, just mill around for a time, walk around aimlessly but in formation and just return to the U.S.</p>
<p>Just for the fun of it, &#8220;free movement of people and goods across the border&#8221;, as these various Mexican Presidents like to talk about all the time.</p>
<p>Maybe this is a good idea? Maybe a &#8220;movement&#8221; can be started?</p>
<p>The &#8220;Million Whitey March&#8221;! I can only imagine the reaction.</p>
