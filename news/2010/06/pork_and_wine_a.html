			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>London Telegraph, June 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Anti-racism activists have condemned plans to hold a &#8220;pork sausage and wine&#8221; party in a multi-ethnic Paris district to protest against what the organisers call the area&rsquo;s &#8220;Islamisation&#8221;.</p>
<p>SOS Racisme called for the event scheduled for Friday in the Goutte d&rsquo;Or area of north Paris to be banned because it sent out a &#8220;message of hate and of violence towards groups of people because of their real or supposed origins&#8221;.</p>
<p>The opposition Communist Party said in a statement that &#8220;this disgusting joke seeks to exacerbate the differences that make for the richness of the 18th arrondissement (district)&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sylvie Francois, a local resident, told French radio that she set up a Facebook page for the event to fight against what she saw as the increasing &#8220;Islamisation&#8221; of her area.</p>
<p>The project has been publicised on internet social networking sites by a small far-Right group that calls itself the Bloc Identitaire.</p>
<p>Paris police said they will meet with the event&rsquo;s organisers on Tuesday to consider their official request for permission to hold the event.<br>

		<p>Wait til the French Communist party learns about Wendy&rsquo;s racist bacon cheeseburger.</p>
<p>It discriminates against Hindus who can&rsquo;t eat meat and Muslims and Orthodox Jews who can&rsquo;t dine on pork.</p>

		<p>I remember reading not long ago, perhaps here in amren, about a charity in France that was banned from operating what was basically a soup kitchen because they served pork, and therefore were excluding muslims from receiving free food.  It&rsquo;s a madhouse.</p>

		<p>Of course there&rsquo;s nothing racist about opposing a religion.  And isn&rsquo;t it interesting that patriots in the U.S, Britain, and France are labeled the far right  &mdash;  in this article even as a &#8220;small&#8221; group?  If that were the case, the far left (self-proclaimed Communists) would not be worried.</p>

		<p>I hope the French wine and pork parties become a worldwide trend.  French are renowned for their cuisine and the Muslims have no right to prohibit the French from celebrating one of the most admirable and enjoyable cornerstones of their culture.  </p>
<p>Other iconic aspects of France   &mdash;   namely, beauty Brigitte Bardot   &mdash;   have been attacked by the Muslim extremists and their leftist enablers.  When will the cultural destruction end? </p>

		<p>Those bacon cheeseburgers also discriminate against orthodox Jews who aren&rsquo;t allowed to mix meat and dairy products - are tofu-burgers in our future as that won&rsquo;t offend anyone&rsquo;s religious beliefs?<br>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what the proportions are. (I doubt if even the French know, as their government forbids gathering any such statistics.)  But there are a great many sub-Saharans too (i.e. who are black). In fact, there are tremendous numbers of both. Many of the North Africans, especially those who dress in modern clothing, are much less conspicuous; and many can pass for French.  Both the black and the non-black Africans in France are almost invariably Moslems.</p>
<p>This is, btw, the district  containing the famous Basilica of the Sacred Heart (Sacre Coeur), the Moulin Rouge, Pigalle, Montmartre. The northern part of it is by  now heavily black; I&rsquo;d say more black than Arab. It&rsquo;s on the northern edge of the city, and the suburbs beyond that are virtually all black   &mdash;   they are black and they are communist. And they are all (at least nominally) Moslem.  </p>
<p>One further point I should add: this is where the &#8220;French&#8221; baby boom is occuring.  One sees babies and baby strollers everywhere. There is hardly a woman in sight without several babies.<br>

		<p>Very good propaganda on the part of our French kinsmen.</p>
<p>The key is to take beloved cultural activities that are threatened by NW immigrants, invaders - NW Muslims can generally be counted on to threaten so much of what White people like.</p>
<p>In France - the NW Muslims threaten the right to enjoy French win, French cuisine, to watch the legs of beautiful French (and other women).  Most regular Whites can understand economics and will usually reject the true believer Libertarian campaigns of American style &#8220;Patriots&#8221; - but most French will join together to fight for the French language, the French way of life - and why shouldn&rsquo;t they? It&rsquo;s a great way of life.</p>
<p>Now translating this to America (don&rsquo;t try to simply copy what works in France or Holland, as it will not work in the USA). Find something that local Whites like, that is threatened by mass immigration of NWs - usually NW Muslims are the best propaganda enemy.</p>
<p>For working class Whites in the South and other places - start putting the word out that things will have to &#8220;Change&#8221; if NW Muslims continue to immigrate - the locals will no longer be allowed to drink beer, enjoy BBQ pork ribs, play C& W music or just be &#8220;good ol boys&#8221;.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t others catch where some regular good ol Texas boy with farm land that was next to a growing Mosque in Texas decided to hold Friday night pig races just to insult the NW Muslim invaders?</p>
<p>Culture is what gets Whites to fight - not Constitutions, free market economics.</p>

		<p>Interestingly, there is very old historical precedent for this wine festival, going back at least to the 1400&rsquo;s. It is being held in  a location called the Goutte-d&rsquo;Or   &mdash;    a small street, meaning Drop of Gold. I was curious about the name, and had to look it up. </p>
<p>It seems that in the Middle Ages, this locale, lying  at the base of Montmartre, grew a vine that yielded a very famous wine called Drop of Gold (Goutte-d&rsquo;Or). Every year, the City of Paris gifted  the king with four barrels of this prized wine. Even today, there are still vinyards growing on the crowded slopes of Montmartre, though I don&rsquo;t know if they still produce this ancient wine.</p>

		<p>  I guess SOS Racisme would rather folks eat &#8220;bush meat&#8221; and drink a Masai delicacy  &mdash;  cattle blood mixed with milk? Would that be more acceptable from a multicultural standpoint? How about eating some good old fashioned Cajun Crawfish Gumbo? Long live <br>

I recall another Amrener, about a year ago, in a northern suburb of Dallas  (Plano?) saying their their Hindu neighbors were holding snake festivals in their yard. Ugh!<br>
Well, snake worship may be part of their &#8220;culture&#8221;,in India, but it isn&rsquo;t part of ours!</p>

<p>How utterly and nauseatingly laughable!</p>
<p>Communists saying that anything is a &ldquo;disgusting joke&rdquo;, must not look at themselves in the mirror very much. Perhaps, that is why so many of these Red revolutionary types sport beards and avoid shaving every morning?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>
<p>Sorry, if you don&rsquo;t get the joke:</p>

<p>So true. Today, not allowing illegal immigration or immigration of of people with incompatable beliefs is called &#8220;right-wing extremism&#8221; whereas 50 years ago it would have been called common sense. Today, common sense has become &#8220;right-wing extremism&#8221;.</p>
