<h1>6.2 Million Mexicans Want to Move to U.S., Gallup Poll Says</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Melanie Hunter-Omar, Cybercast News Service, June 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new poll shows 6.2 million Mexicans would like to move permanently to the United States if they could  &mdash;  almost half the 14 million Mexicans who said they would like to move outside of their native country.</p>
<p>Canada and Spain were listed as the other top destinations that Mexicans cited.</p>
<p>Gallup compiled a list of the top 10 countries by highest projected population of potential migrants who say they would like to move to the United States. That list also includes: China (22.9 million), India (17.1 million), Nigeria (16.6 million), Ethiopia (9.2 million), Bangladesh (7.8 million), Brazil (7.7 million), Philippines (5.8 million), Vietnam (5 million), and Japanese (3.3 million).</p>
<p>Gallup concluded that if all adults worldwide who said they would like to move to another country actually did so, the U.S. could see a net population gain of 60 percent. On the other hand, Mexico could see net population losses as high as 15 percent.</p>

		<p>Great except the USA is running out of whites to fleece. If the government of the USA were to not allow an emigrant to live in an environment either enriched or supported by white labor and infrastructure, how many of these would move here? Even better, require the new emigrants to support the blacks for the next 10 generations as a ticket price.</p>

		<p>I believe the initial figure of 6 million is too low, and doesn&rsquo;t take into account the ones who would only want citizenship of temporary convenience.</p>
<p>The population of Mexico is 108 million.  The remaining 102 million Mexicans would consider their options if the first wave was successful.</p>
<p>Many would maintain a family home in Mexico, and send a young breadwinner to the U.S. to earn remittance money.  </p>

<p>And a lot of people would like Bill Gates&rsquo; wealth, too.  Does that mean we can just take it from him?  Why can&rsquo;t these people just stay with their own race, in their own country, and fix their own damn problems instead of coming to white nations, taking of us, and then whining about racism?  </p>

  Amazing.  They all want to be somewhere other than their own country.  That&rsquo;s just simply amazing given how much they brag about their country and how much better than everyone else they consider themselves to be.  </p>

		<p>6.2 million, NO problem, not to worry at the present rate of invasion in another year or so they will have succeeded, only to be replaced by another unknown millions. What&rsquo;s to stop them? This is from an unknown random sampling questioned? Does anyone ever question the validity of these polls? Absolutely insane. </p>

		<p>I felt compelled to post on this since I have actual experience dealing with these kinds of people and I&rsquo;m not just refering to mexicans but especially ones from Asia. <br>
All these groups see themselves as entitled to move to our country and without any restrictions as if one of us would move out of one state to another in the USA. This is a very dangerous attitude even if someone were blind to the obviousness of race, since none of these groups assimilate and I mean truly assimilate. I&rsquo;ve met those with the fluency of english and no accent that you&rsquo;d think they didn&rsquo;t speak their own language yet do. They don&rsquo;t think assimilation is good and want both racial separation and to have little colonies here while taking it away from whites in general.<br>
They see the gates are opened to the land of milk and honey and we need to shut them out before we lose it all. At this rate we certainly will.</p>

		<p>Anybody else notice that no European country seems to be included in this article?  I&rsquo;d like to know how many Europeans would like to immigrate to the U.S. but now can&rsquo;t because of the 1965 Immigration Act.</p>

		<p>@white is right, black is whack</p>
<p>You asked why can&rsquo;t they stay home and take care of their own country?</p>
<p>Because that is hard and humans like the easy way out.</p>
<p>And the white nations make it easier than anybody as we collectively roll over and surrender to mass immigration. Even gang rapes and murderes don&rsquo;t provoke a collective respoonse from whites. Apparently we are doomed.</p>

		<p>White is Right asks why.  The answer, as I&rsquo;m sure he knows, is because WE LET THEM.<br>
Why do we let them?  BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO REMAIN IN POWER IN PERPETUITY.  That&rsquo;s the only way they can impose their socialist paradise on us.<br>
They know that if they allow 15 or 20 million &#8220;immigrants&#8221; in, they will have the edge in every election IF THEY CHOOSE THEIR IMMIGRANTS CAREFULLY.  No whites.  No europeans.  No 1st world immigrants.  Only immigrants from the third world guaranteed to need, and vote for, more nanny state socialism.</p>

		<p> Most of the potential immigration numbers are way too low to be realistic. I estimate that 20 million Mexicans would like to move to the United States. As far as countries like Nigeria, Ethiopia and Bangladesh, I believe that almost half of the population in each country would move, particularly if American taxpayers paid their way. In my academic career I&rsquo;ve known few students from the previously mentioned nations to return to their home countries after graduation. Many &ldquo;jump&rdquo; or overstay their student Visas. What surprises me if that three million Japanese wish to leave their country?</p>

<p>The only problem with this schneme is that these people often have high birthrates and take more in taxes than they contribute. When the parasite outweighs the host, then the host dies. Socialism would be even more likely to collapse because there simply won&rsquo;t be enough Whites to make the money and contribute the taxes.</p>
