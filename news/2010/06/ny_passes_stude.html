<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite promises that the exams  &mdash;  which determine whether students advance to the next grade  &mdash;  would not be dumbed down this year, students got &#8220;partial credit&#8221; for wrong answers after failing to correctly add, subtract, multiply and divide. Some got credit for no answer at all.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But scoring guides obtained by The Post reveal that kids get half-credit or more for showing fragments of work related to the problem  &mdash;  even if they screw up the calculations or leave the answer blank.</p>
<p>Examples in the fourth-grade scoring guide include:</p>
<p>* A kid who answers that a 2-foot-long skateboard is 48 inches long gets half-credit for adding 24 and 24 instead of the correct 12 plus 12.</p>
<p>* A miscalculation that 28 divided by 14 equals 4 instead of 2 is &#8220;partially correct&#8221; if the student uses the right method to verify the wrong answer.</p>
<p>* Setting up a division problem to find one-fifth of $400, but not solving the problem  &mdash;  and leaving the answer blank  &mdash;  gets half-credit.</p>
<p>* A kid who subtracts 57 cents from three quarters for the right change and comes up with 15 cents instead of 18 cents still gets half-credit.</p>
<p>* A student who figures the numbers of books in 35 boxes of 10 gets half-credit despite messed-up multiplication that yields the wrong answer, 150 instead of 350.</p>
<p>These questions ask students to show their work. The scoring guidelines, called &#8220;holistic rubrics,&#8221; require that points be given if a kid&rsquo;s attempt at an answer reflects a &#8220;partial understanding&#8221; of the math concept, &#8220;addresses some element of the task correctly,&#8221; or uses the &#8220;appropriate process&#8221; to arrive at a wrong solution. Despite flubbing the answer, students can get 1 point on a 2-point problem and 1 or 2 points on a 3-pointer.</p>
<p>The Brooklyn teacher said she and peers who had trained to score the tests were stunned at some instructions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some testing experts are also troubled.</p>
<p>Ray Domanico, a former head of data analysis for city schools, said kids deserve a little credit for partial knowledge but agreed the scoring system &#8220;raises some questions about whether it&rsquo;s too generous.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A year ago, Chancellor Joel Klein boasted that the city was making &#8220;dramatic progress&#8221; when 82 percent of city students passed the state math test and 69 percent passed in English, up sharply from 2002. And fewer kids have been left back in recent years.</p>
<p>What officials didn&rsquo;t reveal was that the number of points needed to pass proficiency levels has, in most cases, steadily dropped.</p>

		<p>Well, of course they&rsquo;re pushed along in school. All anyone has to do is stand across the street from a NYC school and watch the children emerge from school each day. Any lucid person can see they&rsquo;re sub-par people. Like the old black comedian, Flip Wilson used to say, &#8220;What you see, is what you got.&#8221;</p>
<p>That says it all. don&rsquo;t be confused, it is what it is.</p>

		<p>That isn&rsquo;t the half of it:  Texas standardized state tests now consider 43.6% to be a passing score:</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/2ewgeuc</p>
<p>This is how public schools are going to be able to &#8220;comply&#8221; with NCLB   &mdash;   make the questions easier, give partial credit for partial answers, and lower the threshold for a passing test.  </p>

		<p>I knew some day, some way, they would find a way to elevate minorities to equal achievement levels. This defies all sanity. Why even give the test? Pass them all for making some little effort for taking the test. These geniuses will undoubtedly become lifelong democrats, and welfare recipients thus hastening our downfall. Or better yet they can replace the brilliant teachers, and further the cause of marxism. The irony of this is if this same test were given to inner city high school youts the same method would need to be applied to achieve the same results.</p>

		<p>No one here will be much shocked by this.  Our politicians insist they&rsquo;ll impose tough, uniform standards to improve our failing schools.  Teachers are stuck with the reality of the quality of students they are teaching.  The result of the irresistible force meeting the immovable object is Ebonic Math, where 28 / 14 = 4.  At least the students should find promising jobs at the federal budget office.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not surprized. This is the same mentality that these kids will expect later in life when they apply for civil service jobs such as fireman police officer, etc. and barely pass the test and still want to bypass those who scored higher on the test to get the job and if they don&rsquo;t get their way, they sue stating that the exam was discriminatory.</p>

<p>If I were a rich man and setup a scholarship I would use this scoring method   &mdash;  <br>
- spelling errors are wrong answers<br>
- test are not T/F or multiple choice<br>
- each puncuation error is minus one point<br>
- each wrong answer is minus two points <br>
- questions requiring multiple responses must be in correct order</p>

		<p>I do not understand this. Basic math is concrete  &mdash;  either an answer is right or it&rsquo;s wrong  &mdash;  there is no &#8220;partially correct&#8221; about it. <br>
6 x 8 = 48 and if I say it&rsquo;s 72 or 45 or whatever, it&rsquo;s WRONG, no matter what kinds of &#8220;fragments of calculations&#8221; I used to get the WRONG answer.<br>
Schools have been producing graduates that can&rsquo;t read for years. Now they are producing graduates who can&rsquo;t count, add or make change either. No wonder Americais no longer a super power. We have so many low-IQ &#8220;diverse&#8221; people among us, and their unteachable children, that the whole nation is falling into a sewer of ignorance and illiteracy.</p>

		<p>Could you imagine if NASA was this laissez-faire about their calculations? That first shuttle never would have made it off the ground.</p>
<p>My teachers do this for me a lot, and I never thought much of it. To be honest, it always made sense to me, if I do everything right but maybe I punch the wrong figues into the calculator, why shouldn&rsquo;t I get some credit? But now I&rsquo;m beginning to realize how much trouble our society will be in if we grow up thinking its okay to be &#8220;sorta right&#8221; or &#8220;kinda correct&#8221; or &#8220;well hey, at least I did the first part right!&#8221;</p>

		<p>Just one of many reasons that blacks  are completely unprepared for life after school.  And why most fast food joints have to put pictures on the cash registers&hellip;to show them what the change should look like.  Instead of forcing them to learn, we just change the rules so whatever they do is ok.  <br>
But, when they can&rsquo;t even pass the dumbed down tests, it&rsquo;s whiteys fault&hellip;.<br>
Is there an actual place in this world where blacks are held to the same standards and rules as everyone else??<br>

		<p>I am glad these test takers, or for that matter the test scorers, weren&rsquo;t with the space program. First is was make the questions easier, then it was lower the score for passing, and now its redefine what was once thought to be concrete answers.  Who knew math has socially approved answers.<br>
Perhaps we can share our educational insights with the Chinese who have yet to adopt these standards for competitiveness.  <br>

		<p>Mathematics, of course, is a branch of science. When they play around with mathematics, and give credit for &#8220;half-truths&#8221;, the rest of science branches being manipulated can&rsquo;t be far behind. Medicine, physics, chemistry and botany will soon follow.</p>
<p>Biology and anthropology have already been manipulated to considerable extents.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m an engineer who at the time worked for a large corporation and we were encouraged to go into inner city schools and talk to the students about what engineers did. I decided to keep things simple and describe the simple process of building a garage. <br>
When we got to the part about estimating quantities of materials, I lost them- including the teacher! These were seniors in high sschool. I could not get even the teacher to understand how to calculate the quantity of concrete needed in the foundation. The security guard came in from the hallway and was astonished that I understood this complex problem and was trying to explain this to the students. Only by an experience like this can one really the depth of the problem. Simple mutiplication is beyond a lot of them.</p>

		<p>All this points way back to 1865.  When the last of the Confederate Armies surrendered to superior numbers and firepower, the entire nation lost.  Only the Confederacy and Copperhead supporters up North knew this at the time.  Our leaders tried in vain to make everyone understand this, but to no avail.  The Bell Curve, called &#8220;scientific racism&#8221; by the naacp (I refuse to capitalize this true hate organisations), turns out to be perfectly true.  It is not racist, it does not discriminate, it is merely proven science.</p>

I went to a northern city H.S. in the late 1950&rsquo;s, the school system did not racially dicriminate, but it did accademically discriminate. No  Black (or other race) senior in that school system would not have been able to do basic arithmetic, or he would not have been a senior.</p>

		<p>My husband and I both teach in Philadelphia public schools - he in a predominantly white charter school in the Northeast, myself in an utter hell hole of a high school in North Philly. After 35+ years of classroom service, we are both in the final days of our careers - and not a moment too soon. The Philadelphia School District is no longer on the verge of collapse - it HAS collapsed. Teachers in my (98% black) school have been sexually assaulted, students run wild in the hallways all day long, and I have taken to carrying pepper spray in my purse after being punched in the head by a mentally disturbed and extremely violent freshman (who received exactly one day of in-house suspension for his attack - which he spent reading comic books and listening to rap music. I, however, was asked by the assistant principal what I did to provoke the attack and why she should take the word of a &#8216;too-strict old woman&rsquo; over a young, proud black brother. No lie.)  For those who complain about teachers&rsquo; salaries being too high, here&rsquo;s a dirty little secret you should know. Teachers are not being paid for their knowledge of chemistry or mathematics or history or whatever - nor for their ability to impart knowledge in these subjects to their pupils. We are paid to keep thousands of crazy, out-of-control thugs and gangbangers off the streets of Philadelphia for 7 hours a day/9.5 months a year.  And I - and others like me - are the last bullwark against the (inevitable and likely bloody) disintegration of this once-beautiful city. The new generation of teachers (wisely) quits the profession after three years or so of unrelieved stress (in teacher lingo, we refer to it as &#8220;Burn and Churn&#8221;). When my generation goes, all hell will break loose. There will be NO ONE left to keep them under control. Philly is run by blacks for the (unearned) advancement of blacks. Our Superintendent of Schools, Arlene Ackerman, is an appallingly ignorant, extremely low-class representative of all that is wrong here. When black pupils viciously attacked docile Asian students at South Philly High (after these Asians were forced into the streets by a black principal who locked the doors behind them and denied them refuge from their being beaten), the school district did its best to frame the VICTIMS of the attacks as the perpetrators. Mayor Nutter, a true black political disgrace, backed both Superintendent and Principal (who was shortly deposed for NOT EVEN HAVING A VALID EDUCATION CREDENTIAL!) to the hilt - a new low in racial politics.  I expect that I will like things much better in our new home (in Singapore!)  Farewell to black anarchy!</p>
