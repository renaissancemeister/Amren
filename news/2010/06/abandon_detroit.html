<h1>Abandon Detroit, Abandon Black America</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>L&rsquo;Heureux Lewis, Atlanta Post, June 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Detroit: The city that represents the prospects and failures of American industry.The city that is the punch line of a million jokes. The city that is Blacker than nearly any other in this country. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Detroit is a microcosm of Black America. I believe if you cannot love Detroit, you cannot fully love Black people. The Detroit Metropolitan area represents the best and the worst that Black folks in this country have to offer. The Black middle class was solidified in and around Detroit with steady unionized blue collar labor in the auto industry.</p>
<p>The middle class expanded as more Black folks with college educations occupied managerial positions. Detroiters experienced and vigilantly fought the racisms of housing redlining, riots, as well as White and Black flight. {snip} If there is a city that tells us about the promise and perils of Blackness, it&rsquo;s Detroit. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} When I lived in Michigan, I hung out in Detroit and fell in love with the rich activism taking place. The strength of Detroiters and their voices are often missing from the reality shows and headlines. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Detroit communities are addressing the consequences of poverty  &mdash;  like violence  &mdash;  and more importantly, the roots of poverty  &mdash;  like education. On the ground, Detroiters are fighting back by forming the vanguard that is rethinking education, the media, health and youth issues. During the close of June, Detroit will host the Allied Media Conference, the United States Social Forum and the National Hip Hop Congress Conference.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} It is time that we demand more of media, more of ourselves and help turn around the sullied gem of Black America.<br>

		<p>Detroit is a good example of what can happen. I just hope there are enough people paying attention. </p>
<p>&#8220;If there is a city that tells us about the promise and perils of Blackness, it&rsquo;s Detroit&#8221;. I don&rsquo;t know where he gets the promise from but I agree with the perils. </p>

		<p>This is a rather bizarre piece.  Anybody who doesn&rsquo;t love Detroit doesn&rsquo;t fully love black people?</p>
<p>Well, I think Detroit&rsquo;s a crime-ridden bombed-out city.  But I love it!  I love the muggings, the drug deals, the intermittent rattle of small arms fire, the filth, the squalor, the abandoned buildings and dwellings, the daily school killings, the abandoned cars, the arson, the broken glass everywhere, the local denizens staring in a dull stupor from their porches, yes, all these things I love!  </p>

<p>rich activism    (superlative adjectives for anything that destroys White America)</p>

<p>fighting back by forming the vanguard   (caucusing with the splc, adl, aclu, naacp, and obamas for new and improved ways to shake down whitey for more money and more easy access to his White Daughters)</p>
<p>National Hip Hop Congress Conference    (proud black culture, and please all you raciss Whitey Folks, just ignore the lyrics, knifings, and shootings)<br>

		<p>Detroit was once a great city.  This author needs to acknowledge that Detroit was destroyed.  And now he wants us to rebuild Detroit?  For what, so it can be destoyed again?  No thanks.  </p>
<p>Those that destoyed it should rebuild it.</p>

		<p>I saw a video on Youtube showing you can buy a mansion for $300,000.  But the problem is you will be taxed to death on it and the crime is so bad that you will risk you life living in it.</p>
<p>The video showed where Thomas Edison and Henry Ford once lived.  Huge, beautiful houses surrounded by crumbling buildings.</p>

		<p>This writer has it backwards. Detroit is not violent because people are poor. Detroit is poor because people are violent. Skyscrapers are abandoned in Detroit because the people are violent. If were to have given Detroit to poor Japanese people instead of Africans, Detroit would look like Tokyo rather than the burned out wasteland that it is today. Detroit is a wonderful port city on the great lakes. Geographically there are no major natural disasters that have ever harmed Detroit. Detroit is an utter failure because of the people who live there. While there is debate as to whether these people are capable of learning, they obviously don&rsquo;t want to learn anything anyway. Entire classrooms of sixth graders from one end of the city to the other, can&rsquo;t read. The teachers who tried to care, they all quit. The poor pathetic parents who only want a good education for their children, send their kids to school with nothing. No lunch, no pencils, no paper &hellip;nothing! Its the school&rsquo;s job to do everything. All the latest hip hop fashions are on display at every school courtesy of the white man&rsquo;s welfare check. Detroit is a hole of government money. It produces nothing, exhausts the resources of the surrounding areas and threatens life ending violence to anyone within its grasp who has anything to steal.</p>

		<p>I would love to spearhead a project to tear down those dilapidated buildings, bulldoze over the trash and burnt out cars and return the area to nature.  Create lush forests, rolling meadows, artificial waterfalls, nature preserves, etc.  The only problem is the mobile blight that is the people of Detroit would spread out to some other area recreating the same conditions they left.  </p>

<p>This will provide context for his quasi-social-scientific comments. Consider that before WWII a black with Lewis&rsquo; capacity might well have been a principal at a high school, and making a positive contribution to his people and his country. In today&rsquo;s liberal America, he has become another taker.</p>

		<p>l&rsquo;heureux means &#8220;the hour&#8221; in English. I think that perhaps this is not a coincidence. Maybe it IS the hour of our reconning. Maybe the reality of Detroit should be examined more carefully and not be so sumarily dismissed. It could be that how and why Detroit became as it is, is a most imprtant lessson. Although I&rsquo;ve never actually been there, I&rsquo;m certain that it was not always like it is today. Talk is cheap. Understanding, knowing&hellip; has much more value..</p>

		<p>&#8220;to usurp a dignity with absurd pretensions&#8221;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a &#8220;professor,&rsquo; or a &#8220;Dr.&#8221; or some such silly fanciness. </p>
<p>And his last name! What a ridiculous invention!  He chose real French instead of the French colonial African original.</p>
<p>Reminds me of a quotation from Hinton Rowan Helper&rsquo;s &#8220;Africans in Africaland.&#8221;   Blacks always assume the most absurd pretensions to make themselves look important. The never actually earn their meritorious titles.  Any black professor in America today is the product of preferential Affirmative Diversity Action Race Privilege for non whites only.  Whites need not apply, especially at historically White universities founded and funded by Whites.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[blockquote]&#8221;The [african] has been, and still is, thoroughly misunderstood.  However severely we may condemn the horrible system of slavery, the results of emancipation have proved that the [African] does not appreciate the blessings of freedom, nor does he show the slightest feeling of gratitude to the hand that broke the rivets of his fetters. His narrow mind cannot embrace that feeling of pure philanthropy that first prompted England to declare herself against slavery, and he only regards the anti-slavery movement  as a proof of his own importance. In his limited horizon he is himself the important object, and as a sequence to his self-conceit, he imagines that the whole world is at issue concerning the black man. The [African], therefore, being the important question, must be an important person, and he conducts himself accordingly, he is far too great a man to work. Upon this point his natural character exhibits itself most determinedly. Accordingly, he resists any attempt at coercion; being free, his first impulse is to claim an equality with those whom he lately served, and to usurp a dignity with absurd pretensions, that must inevitably insure the  disgust and abhorrence of the white community.&#8221; Baker&rsquo;s Great <br>

In universities that hand out degrees to the tribe of this black &#8220;professor,&#8221; minorities are all we want now. Makes us look good. Diversity is our Greatest Virtue.  Academic Excellence is an outdated and probably racist construct.  Cultural Sensitivity is our goal, not White achievement and White advancement.  If Whites are dispossessed and degraded as we remake America into its best more hopeful transformed self, then all the better, because making Whites miserable is how we &#8220;atone for the sins of segregation.&#8221;</p>
<p>A healthy, happy, hopeful White is a crime against human dignity. We must do more! We must make Whites miserable! Diversity is our Strength, and also the best way we know to make Whites so absolutely miserable that they flee  neighborhoods, schools, and churches, leaving behind their homes, their campuses, and their huge multimillion dollar denominational endowments just for us! Social Justice through forcing the Whites to abandon all their stuff to us because they can&rsquo;t enjoy it in peace and safety when we surround them! Social Justice = Whites Running for Their Lives! </p>

<p>Since he &#8220;studies&#8221; the blacks, then maybe he&rsquo;s come up with the reason that his blacks are so inclined toward over-representing themselves in all destructive pathologies, such as illegitimate births and crime rates.  </p>
<p>Maybe he is the black &#8220;professor&#8221; who can explain why the blacks are steadfastly dedicated to living into every racist Jim Crow stereotype ever sprung forth from the fertile imaginations of Prof. Charles Carroll, Rev. Buckner W. Payne, and our beloved Thomas Dixon, Jr.  He knows the truth. Why  is he keeping it a secret? </p>
<p>Because the truth will collapse the shake-down-whitey racket, that&rsquo;s why.</p>

I&rsquo;m a frustrated anthropologist-wanna-be.  I never had a chance to go to Africa to study &#8220;vital indigenous peoples and their thriving, vibrant, and authentic cultures.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I watch the blacks perform minstrel shows in their hip hop rap videos on youtube and BET.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take much to get my fill.  I then offer thanks to my blessed and loving God up in Heaven that I never had the opportunity to go to Africa and study &#8220;vital indigenous peoples and their thriving, vibrant, and authentic cultures.&#8221;</p>
<p>I confess that I do like the blacks&rsquo; soul, funk, blues, gospel and some jazz, but I also admit that those African beats I enjoyed so much while growing up did great damage to my mind.</p>
<p>They urged me toward greater and greater forms of immediate sensation, and chasing the buzz was my demise.  Wild syncopated music was the gateway to the need for stronger physical sensation.  Nothing good ever came of it, just like nothing good happens after Midnight.  I saw the sun rise on too many occasions. I would be much further advanced in life if had obeyed my father and not listened to that music.</p>
<p>Thank God hip hop rap is an unlistenable degeneracy of the forms I enjoy, because I can see the logical ends of where I&rsquo;d be if I kept listening to the rapping blacks in the same quantities as I did their earlier enjoyable forms. </p>
<p>So, when I do indulge in wild sensation via black music (sans booze or drugs), I at least apprehend it as something dangerous and to be taken in very limited or moderate quantities.  </p>
<p>Whenever I listen to it, or rock music as well, I always strive to end the day listening to healing, elevating, and mentally stimulating music, such as my White People&rsquo;s classical and bluegrass.  </p>
<p>I consider these White musical forms as a wholesome and healing.  </p>
<p>I am thoroughly White Ethnocentric in my greatest appreciations and affinities.  Amren has served a vital purpose for me by awakening me to the problems surrounding us.  I am shaped into a better White Person through what I read on Amren.  I am the reason Abe F. and Heidi B. are restless, tireless workaholics.<br>

		<p>I grew up in Calgary, Alberta, which suffered a terrible economic recession in the mid to late 1980s. Did the city fall apart? No - a majority white population toughed it out, and Calgary bounced back stronger than ever. Similarly, Detroit may have fallen on tough times with the demise of the auto industry, but Pittsburgh suffered equally badly with the demise of the steel industry. Yet Pittsburgh rebuilt itself - the downtown (IMO) is really quite nice. Of course, Pittsburgh (unlike Detroit) had a majority white population, which made all the difference in the world.</p>
<p>Is there one black-majority country or city or region in the world that&rsquo;s truly prosperous (and with no whites around to prop things up)? I&rsquo;d be really interested to find out, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure I already know the answer.</p>

<p>In addition, we have to:</p>
<p>Stop them from dropping out of school<br>
Bring their test scores up<br>
Stop them from being so violent<br>
Reduce their very high rate of out of wedlock births<br>
Reduce their high rates of STDs<br>
Pass hate crime laws for them<br>
Force quotas and affirmative actions laws so they can obtain jobs they are not qualified for<br>
Give them free breakfast and lunches at school<br>

		<p>When my mother was born in Detroit, it was 90% white.  I am not Methuselah.  Neither was she.  In other words: it is not ancient history.  The decline of the city has been dramatic.  What is now the blackest city in America was built by my mother, my father, and millions of productive white people like them.   </p>
<p>It was a white city. </p>
<p>It was a great city, with jobs and good schools and community - our neighborhood was much like an extended family.  All of it created, built and maintained by white people.  It was our city, the work of our own hands.  </p>
<p>Blacks drove us out and destroyed it.  </p>

I sometimes feel like I&rsquo;m banging my head against the wall, talking to zombies. People who have been brainwashed for so long, that they actually believe, up is down and wrong is right. I become frustrated, I receive email after email from people -  like those who post on Amren. They complain and lament, but things continue to get worse. <br>
Because of that, I sometimes feel that it&rsquo;s a waste of time for me to argue, write op-ed&rsquo;s, letters to the editor,and lengthy emails. Can we ever stop this slide?<br>
Your comment was inspiring. You nailed the problem as well as anyone I have read on this site, and you did it succinctly.<br>
Like you,I will continue to voice my logical criticisms no matter whom it offends. Short of resorting to the behavior that we abhor and condemn, I don&rsquo;t know what else I can do.    </p>

<p>Way too late for any of that. Way too late. And the decline has been so bad for so long I doubt any remedy will work now. Dee has been on the way out for some time and NEVER will come back.</p>

<p>This is actually occurring by itself and has been for some many decades now. At least [??] fifty percent of Dee has already reverted back to nature. I was very surprised that for a period of over twenty years, Dee has been studied from satellite photos to determine how MUCH of Dee has already gone back to the natural state. And when it does revert, it comes back with a vengeance and fast and does a good job. Very surprisisng.</p>

<p> &#8220;Freedom of association is a fundamental human right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not in an anti racist culture.   Dig deep enough, and you will find that black activists and &#8220;academic scholars&#8221; (ha ha) have pushed so far into the leadership of formerly White Institutions, that the mandates now come from the radically  subversive Black Power attitude.</p>
<p>They believe that bias and racism come from &#8220;freedom of association,&#8221; and that wherever Whites gather with Whites,  and racism spews forth like a toxic spill. (If only!)</p>
<p>They want Whites to be surrounded and infiltrated with the constant presence of blacks.   Their mission is to Eracism through eradicating White opportunities for freedom of association.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a takeover, and Whites are timid enough to go along with it.</p>
<p>All these Freedoms we keep hearing about are just code words for White Privilege.  Blacks don&rsquo;t believe Whites have any legitimate freedoms or rights.  Blacks don&rsquo;t comprehend these abstractions. They see all through the African mind of tribal warriors.</p>
<p>So should we, since we are surrounded by tribal warriors.</p>
<p>We are in an ethno war, and only our enemy knows it.</p>
<p>We should begin dedicating our selves to publicizting what the blacks tell each other about us. We need to teach Whites how to see into the comprehendable part of the hateful black mind.</p>
<p>If we succeed, we will easily turn the tide of Whites worrying about their own prejudices, biases, and hidden racism to worrying about how they will survive being surrounded by an alien race intent on our destruction.</p>
<p>Whites must begin to see themselves as targets, because that&rsquo;s how the blacks see us.</p>
<p>Be on the lookout for anything that sends this message about White environments:</p>
<p><a href="https://themoderatevoice.com/73370/resurgent-racism/" rel="nofollow">https://themoderatevoice.com/73370/resurgent-racism/</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Like any evil, racism and ethnic discrimination flourish in a conducive environment. When respected leaders take public positions, as Rand Paul recently has, that privately owned restaurants should be allowed to deny both employment and service based on race, those leaders add to an environment in which racism can flourish.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
The solution?  Always more White Dispossession and Degradation through increased Affirmative Diversity Action Race Privilege:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.colby.edu/education/activism/files/taskforce2.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.colby.edu/education/activism/files/taskforce2.html</a></p>
<p>&#8220;That a full-time Affirmative Action officer (person of color) be appointed. </p>
<p>&#8220;That, in addition to the Dean of Intercultural Affairs, there be at least one more person. of color in the Dean&rsquo;s Office Staff.<br>
 <br>
&#8220;That the College make a greater commitment to the recruitment of minority faculty and that a minority post-doc be offered in every department as a way to bring such candidates to campus. That there be a review of the attrition of minority faculty at Colby in order to reveal a possible pattern of discrimination.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
A wise man, who was White, of course, told me once that if my employer ever hires a Diversity Officer, that person will be there to make sure my job promotions goes to  non whites.</p>
<p>Whites who work for companies with Offices of Institutional Diversity and Equal Opportunity are employed by people who pay someone to make sure that Whites don&rsquo;t advance through the company.</p>
<p>How long can this last?</p>
<p>Does insanity have a lifespan?<br>

		<p>Even blacks rag on Detroit. And whenever there is trouble, within 400 miles or so, the local paper always puts it down to (when they must lift up the rug) &#8216;youths from Detroit&rsquo;, not the precious local darlings - they&rsquo;re victims too. Enoughs enough though. Leave Detroit alone once in awhile. It&rsquo;s not as if every other big city in the US isn&rsquo;t a bit like it.</p>

		<p>Historically, wherever blacks have clustered in any significant numbers, they have always failed to generate a tax base (jobs) to sustain their communities.  Hence the desire (pre 1964) for integration.  After 1964, their integration became a demand.  But why can&rsquo;t blacks generate a tax base?   </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve a friend (a white woman) who was a high school biology teacher in Detroit. She is no longer able to teach because she is now disabled, due to having been pushed down the stairwell by a group of 4-5 girls between classes one fine day a few years ago. She has permanent nerve damage to her spine and one leg and is confined to a wheelchair. Anyone who gives enough of a damn to try and teach these people anything deserves combat pay. Naturally, the teenage female felons who crippled her for life were black. </p>

		<p>Note that the author refers to the riots as a &#8220;racism&#8221;.  Of course, this is true: it was black racism directed at whites, Koreans, and other non-blacks.  These riots were the main cause of white flight in Detroit.  And when white-hater Coleman Young became mayor, an example of his administrative capabilities was the appointment of a beat cop &#8220;from the &#8216;hood&#8221; to be chief of police.  The magical thinking of so many blacks is absolutely amazing.  Apparently, Young thought all he had to do was sit in the mayor&rsquo;s office, and the city would run itself!  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Detroit communities are addressing the consequences of poverty &mdash; like violence &mdash; and more importantly, the roots of poverty &mdash; like education. On the ground, Detroiters are fighting back by forming the vanguard that is rethinking education, the media, health and youth issues. During the close of June, Detroit will host the Allied Media Conference, the United States Social Forum and the National Hip Hop Congress Conference.&#8221;</p>
<p>This article is a joke, yes? It is written as if by a college freshman practicing his composition or theme paper chops.  And what are these organizations?  Groups of charity- and grant-funded do-gooders getting paid to hang out, party, drink, and clap each other on the back, all the while creating nothing of value or  productivity?  The problem with Detroit seems to be  .  .  .  . &#8220;Detroiters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;.L&rsquo;Heureux Lewis capitalzes both White and Black, correctly acknowledging the existence of the ethnic groups White American and Black American, and implicitly recognizing their right to be treated with as much respect as other ethnic groups, such as Chinese or Jew, which have been in existence for a much longer time&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether Chinese or Jews have &#8216;been in existence for a much longer time&rsquo; is a moot point open to much argument, debate and discussion.  </p>
<p>None of which matters.</p>
<p>What matters is this:  </p>
<p>In the current anti-White Amerikan regime, ALL ETHNIC/RACIAL GROUPS EXCEPT WHITES are allowed by the government to band together and form race-specific groups to advocate and seek redress for their people.  This includes  Jews, Chinese, Blacks, Hispanics  &mdash;  ALL EXCEPT WHITES, who are subjected to open, anti-White discrimination via AA policies in hiring, promotions and college admissions.</p>
<p>The masters of the regime, who plan genocide for us Whites when our numbers fall  low enough, are intent on keeping us atomized and individualized while pitting non-White racial groups against us via the media, academia and, most importantly, through government force (as in Hate Speech laws only applied to Whites and Hate Crime enhancements that do not include crimes against Whites).</p>
<p>Any and ALL White groups  &mdash;  from tea partiers, to the Boy Scouts to the DAR  &mdash;   are subjected to immediate government scrutiny, its members labeled as Nazis, homophobes, and Supremacists by a biased media that give jerks like tim wise and mark potok full voice and unlimited time and space to condemn anything that smacks of White advocacy.  The ADL, SPLC and ACLU, backed by tremendous amounts of money, stand by, every ready to file lawsuits against White organizations or any perceived &#8216;White&rsquo; institutions.</p>
<p>We Whites, unlike any other racial or ethnic group in the entire US, have the government&rsquo;s boot on our necks.</p>
<p>And from #22 Surrounded by Non-Whites:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Dig deep enough, and you will find that black activists and &#8216;academic scholars&rsquo; (ha ha) have pushed so far into the leadership of formerly White Institutions, that the mandates now come from the radically subversive Black Power attitude&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Blacks are neither intelligent enough nor organized enough to foment and carry out a carefully-planned, triangulated, 50-year assault by the media, government and academia that Whites and White Culture have been subjected to.</p>
<p>If you dig deep enough you will find that specific, anti-White policies such as AA, desegregation, school busing and massive non-White immigration were not enacted by blacks; even the NAACP was not founded by blacks. </p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/cgeph</p>
<p>As for Detroit, what did anyone expect from a people group with high levels of violence, that never developed the wheel or a written language and whose home is the veldt of Africa?</p>
<p>Here are examples of what happens when blacks are moved into First World Cultures created by Whites:</p>
<p>From SA, Death of Durban, after blacks moved in:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/6xexvd" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/6xexvd</a></p>
<p>And from the USA, The Ruins of Detroit, after blacks moved in and Whites fled:</p>

<p>Huge swaths of the city are burnt out warrens of vagrants.  My car was broken into one night there, while I was attending a program at Wayne State University.</p>
<p>All of us from the suburbs knew that Detroit was a dangerous place to go.  Now this guy is talking about vibrancy and activism?  </p>

		<p>&#8221;Detroit is a microcosm of Black America. I believe if you cannot love Detroit, you cannot fully love Black people. The Detroit Metropolitan area represents the best and the worst that Black folks in this country have to offer &hellip; The middle class expanded as more Black folks with college educations occupied managerial positions. Detroiters experienced and vigilantly fought the racisms of housing redlining, riots, as well as White and Black flight. {snip} If there is a city that tells us about the promise and perils of Blackness, it&rsquo;s Detroit &hellip; When I lived in Michigan, I hung out in Detroit &amp; fell in love with the rich activism taking place. The strength of Detroiters &amp; their voices are often missing from the reality shows and headlines.&#8221;</p>

		<p>There is no Detriot. There hasn`t been in about 20 years. The median home price in the City limits is 12,000. 350,000 people live there instead of 1960 census 1.5 million. Of the 350,000, 25% are children under 18 living in single parent units. Less than 1 child in ten has a married mother and father living with them. Of the 180,000 males, 60 thousand have felony records. Detriot is now a minimum security prison with the same ethos of Jackson State Reformatory. The strong rule the weak; violent behavior is rewarded with status; the cops are in reality correction officers, who like all correction officers allow the inmates to control themselves as long as they do not attack the officers. Much has been made about whites who refuse to shop or visit the place; however how many whites want to visit a prison except maybe on execution day.<br>

Farms and orchards and grazing land in former industrial areas, and a major cleanup effort generating good jobs in heavy equipment, construction, and railroads. Maybe we should work for that and forget the nasty present.</p>

I know they have talked about the auto plants on here before. The uaw helped to get Clinton elected who then signed free trade, which devastated the manufacturing in this country. This whole country seems to be self destructing and all our enemys have to do is wait. I know some say China wins in the end or in the future. The saying always is it comes from the top.

<i>L&rsquo;Heureux</i> means  &#8220;the happy one&#8221;. It is NOT a first name! But it could be a last.

In  Latin America, the ignorant often do  use mangled foreign names   &mdash;   such as Washington, Franklin, Lenin, Stalin, as first names, inappropriately, and often mis-spelled too. </p>

		<p>&#8220;It is time that we demand more of media, more of ourselves and help turn around the sullied gem of Black America.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ha!  Hilarious!  </p>
<p>Is this article more than a meaningless piece of uselessness or have I missed something?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen so many words mean so little.  Another pithy, little appeal to prop up another black failure.  Do they never end?</p>
<p>If boom times had continued, the corporate greed mongers, the government and the media were making substantial strides in pretending the only thing holding blacks back was the after effects of slavery and white racism.</p>
<p>AA was being pushed at every level in every way.  Blacks who could barely read and write were forced into positions that left those kinds of &#8220;underling,&#8221; menial labor to their assistants, which went all the way to the presidency.</p>
<p>The country was flooded with illegals, with the country clubs and the WSJ screaming for more of the same.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s winding down to a minimal whine right now, and all indications are that the party is over and the things that excess cash bought or covered up are being easily seen for what they were.</p>
<p>Now we are being asked by this brilliant scholar:  Will Detroit reach it&rsquo;s once greatness as the black gem of the world?  Haha!</p>
<p>The entire Western world is on the brink of implosion and this really funny man is wondering whether &#8220;we&#8221; can make Detroit great again.</p>
<p>Too funny.  Just, too funny.</p>

<p>Edgar J. Steele writes in Defensive Racism about people of a certain IQ not being able to comprehend people of a higher IQ. </p>
<p>Makes me think of these Whites how voluntarily surrender their higher IQ when faced with lower IQ blacks. They must have some sort of insane death wish or Stockholm Syndrome.  </p>
<p>Maybe we need to reassess our notions of superiority.</p>
<p>Maybe in times of Diversity, modern civilization no longer allows us to feel superior based on innate traits.  If those traits don&rsquo;t compel us to survive and dominant, then we can&rsquo;t proclaim any superiority. We are weakened by them, and thus we are inferior.</p>
<p>The non whites are winning Amerika now.  Can&rsquo;t we all just agree that going from the lowest status to the highest ruling status without really having to fight for it is some sign of some sort of natural superiority?  Even voodoo tricky counts for superiority if you are winning.<br>

<p>So my extension, all I must do is hate Detroit, and then by spiritual force, I automatically hate the blacks?  You mean, I never have to be an over racist, just a hater of Detroit and I automatically ascend upward to total Transcend Diversity?  Disgust at Detroit is disgust at Inclusive Tolerance and Multiculturalism?</p>
<p>Good.  I adopt Detroit as my fetish of hatred, and thereby free myself from &#8220;All Men Are Created Equal, Diversity is Our Strength, and We Must Do More to Atone for the Sins of Segregation.&#8221;</p>
<p>I never knew what profit would come my way just be hating one city!  May we always have Detroit.<br>

&#8220;Sometimes it is best to think in terms of the future. Forget the next 25 years; what will Detroit be like mid century? I see an agricultural port, like Duluth; population around 100,000. Farms and orchards and grazing land in former industrial areas, and a major cleanup effort generating good jobs in heavy equipment, construction, and railroads. Maybe we should work for that and forget the nasty present.&#8221;</p>
<p>What happens to all those blacks and their future generations?  They aren&rsquo;t just going to die off.  Any remaking of Detroit would require the relocation of its black residents so why bother?  Any place they settle in will in time create another Detroit.  <br>

<p>Why don&rsquo;t you stop and question yourselves as to why people don&rsquo;t want to do business with you.  Why they don&rsquo;t want to open stores in large black areas.  Why they don&rsquo;t want their daughters being with your &#8216;men&rsquo;.  Why they don&rsquo;t want to be in your areas, especially late at night (and without a firearm on them, too).  Why don&rsquo;t you ask yourselves why cops are more likely to be suspicious of a group of black men than a group of white men or asian men?  Ask yourselves that instead of giving the knee-jerk, cop-out &#8216;racism!&rsquo; response you always give.</p>

<p>Yes. I can understand that.   It&rsquo;s analogous to an adult dealing with a child.   The adult can understand  the child&rsquo;s thinking, because the adult has already  been a child.  But a child cannot possibly understand the adult&rsquo;s thinking, because the child has never been an adult.</p>

<p>Exactly.  In Nature, the sole determinant of  &#8220;superiority&#8221; is survival and dominance.  Nature is all about survival of the fittest.  At present, we are toiling to support the &#8220;Others&#8221;  and their multiple offspring to the detriment of our own offspring, while our  own numbers diminish. We are raising the eggs of the cuckoo birds, while neglecting our own. </p>
<p>Is that superiority?  No!  It&rsquo;s servitude.  Toiling for someone else?  Who are the real &#8220;slaves&#8221; in this picture? </p>

		<p>The original document may over state the case that &#8220;ignoring or giving up Detroit is giving up on blacks&#8221;. However, I have lived in Detroit for over 40 years, and teach at a local University.     <br>
     The problems that Detroit has experienced are related to the loss of jobs in all of the &#8220;rust belt&#8221; cities in the midwest. And, I must point out the decision to &#8220;loose&#8221; those jobs were made by corporations dominated by white, male leadership, not &#8220;black&#8221; persons.  <br>
     In addition, Detroit, like any major city in the US facing problems is trying to find a balance between people who live here, and the geography that surrounds us (large areas of green space and abandoned buildings). <br>
     Finally, crime in Detroit is overstated in relationship to other cities. That image of a &#8220;black dominated, crime ridden city&#8221; is also an overstatment. Check the statistics. <br>
     Detroit has a lively music community, a wonderful art museum, the &#8220;Heidelburg project&#8221; and many other cultural and community strengths that are not seen or understood by previous persons who have commented. <br>

		<p>White Woman in Detroit, why does anyone here at Amren need to visit your beautiful city of Detroit? You claim that crime is no worse in Detroit, than in other Rust Belt cities. If that&rsquo;s the case, why are there no supermarkets in Detroit? Why does a house now cost $ 5,000 there?<br>
Detroit&rsquo;s &#8220;lively music community&#8221; consists of hip-hop garbage. Heck, even Berry Gordy relocated Motown Records to Los Angeles, some time ago.</p>
<p>You claim the decision to lose the jobs was made by white men. That may be, but a Bantu mayor made it impossible for businesses to thrive, other than building sports arenas, one for each of Detroit&rsquo;s teams.</p>
<p>Now Detroit is led in the mayor&rsquo;s office by a man whose most difficult accomplishment to date was trying to guard John Havlicek. </p>

		<p>Re my comment about the spectacular rise of Hong Kong,I agree, not well said on my part. British, American, Canadian, French, German and Australian architects, engineers and money all helped build Hong Kong. Supported by the Chinese population there who are born entrepeneurs and business people. The point I was trying to make is, that there is no &#8220;ethnic minority&#8221; group there to hinder it&rsquo;s progress or simply DESTROY! No welfare or AA there either.<br>

		<p>Re 59 on 44&hellip;I made the original comment sort of tongue in cheek, but seriously the question of out-migration is not unsolvable. Many poor people moved to Detroit when times were looking up and it is not inconceivable the reverse may happen. The Michigan economy cannot support a permanent welfare state much longer. Michigan itself has many beautiful areas, and an agricultural and tourist renaissance is not a foolish hope. I suspect whether planned or not a depopulation of Detroit will happen.</p>
