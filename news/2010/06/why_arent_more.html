<h1>Why Aren&rsquo;t More Blacks in the Audience at Broadway Plays?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>E.R. Shipp, The Root, June 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Several plays that have been wooing audiences and critics alike and with particular interest to black folks are up for a record number of Tony Awards. So how well is Broadway  &mdash;  or Off Broadway, for that matter  &mdash;  doing in terms of attracting blacks?</p>
<p>About 75 percent of Broadway theatergoers are white, though according to the Broadway League, which co-sponsors the Tony Awards, audiences have become &#8220;slightly more diverse over the past decade.&#8221; Blacks, Latinos and Asians made up the balance. In the 2008-2009 season, when shows included In the Heights, Rent, Thurgood and Joe Turner&rsquo;s Come and Gone and the all-black version of Tennessee Williams&rsquo; Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, less than 3 percent of 12.15 million tickets sold were to black Broadway theatergoers. In recent years, when the lineup included the Oprah Winfrey-produced The Color Purple and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof  &mdash;  starring James Earl Jones, Phylicia Rashad, Terrence Howard and Anika Noni Rose and directed by Debbie Allen  &mdash;  black turnout was double that. {snip}</p>
<p>Making it on Broadway is not easy. Even now Fela!, a musical about the life of the musician and Nigerian activist, Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, who died in 1997, is struggling to fill seats. Its audience, according to the New York Times, is full of white people, who apparently love the spectacle of blacks dancing and singing  &mdash;  even if they don&rsquo;t understand anything about Fela or Nigerian history. {snip}</p>
<p>On the other hand, there&rsquo;s a revival of August Wilson&rsquo;s Pulitzer and Tony-winning drama, Fences, which is breaking records at the box office, thanks to the marquee allure of Denzel Washington. {snip}</p>
<p>Holding steady at the box office is David Mamet&rsquo;s confrontational drama, Race, where comic actor David Alan Grier plays it straight as a black lawyer representing a white man accused of raping a black woman. {snip} Then there&rsquo;s Ragtime, based on E.L. Doctorow&rsquo;s novel, which focuses on three families  &mdash;  one of them black  &mdash;  trying to adjust to rapidly changing life in early 20th century New York. {snip}</p>
<p>Broadway, of course, isn&rsquo;t alone in this struggle. Off Broadway shows also strive to diversify their audiences, whether it is for those at the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) or the Vineyard Theater, which presented The Scottsboro Boys, or the venerable Joe Papp Public Theater, which among various events, is producing The Winter&rsquo;s Tale and The Merchant of Venice in repertory this summer in its Shakespeare in the Park series. {snip}</p>
<p>So what brings blacks to Broadway?</p>
<p>{snip} Walker-Kuhne [Donna Walker-Kuhne] formed her company, Walker International Communications Group, in 2002 to more formally promote what she had been doing since the 1980s: convincing the theater world to reach out to people of color. Some producers are quite receptive; some don&rsquo;t think they need people like her; and, then, there are those who call at the last minute.</p>
<p>&#8220;It takes a good two months or so to just penetrate the market,&#8221; which, she says, includes advertising through black media. &#8220;The more we use black media, the more they do for us,&#8221; Walker-Kuhne says. She encourages producers to respect black media and not expect them to run ads for free just because blacks are in a cast.</p>
<p>As Walker-Kuhne sees it, money is no more an issue for blacks than for other theatergoers who know how to work the discounts, find the coupons, come in as groups, whatever. {snip}</p>
<p>Like to Memphis. According to the New York Times, Memphis, a musical about the early days of rock and roll in the 1950s and the racial interactions associated with that, &#8220;has attracted one of the most racially diverse audiences on Broadway in recent memory.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&rsquo;s a remarkably diverse season, and I&rsquo;m encouraged by it,&#8221; says Sue Frost, a producer of Memphis, which has received eight Tony nominations, including one for best lead actress in a musical for Montego Glover. {snip} The show received a major boost when first lady Michelle Obama came with her daughters and her mother for a March matinee performance. After that, according to Frost, there was a marked increase in the number of families of color in the audience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like any other group of people, I think blacks like seeing themselves on stage. By that I mean truthful, artful, honest representations of the African-American experience,&#8221; says Glover, who plays Felicia, the love interest of a white DJ who becomes smitten by black music  &mdash;  and her. &#8220;Of course, they identify in other ways, but when we&rsquo;re talking about one of the major draws, seeing their reflections is very high on the list.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot honestly say that I feel that the average Broadway producer will go out of his or her way to attract a diverse audience unless he or she has &#8216;gone out of the way&rsquo; to put these very diverse people on the stage,&#8221; says Roberson, who is working on a Washington revival of the 1980s Broadway hit Sophisticated Ladies, and is also in pre-production for an upcoming Broadway musical, Unchain My Heart, about Ray Charles.</p>

Not only do whites go to shows about blacks but whites are the overwhelming producers and writers of these plays dealing with the alleged historical injustices.</p>
<p>So we learn from Million Dollar Quartet that the black man created rock and roll which the white man expropriated.</p>
<p>From Memphis, we learn that blacks, again created rock and roll, but the white man gets the credit for bringing it to the public.</p>
<p>The subtext is that the black man is the creative force behind popular music but the white man takes the credit, the glory, and the money.</p>
<p>The white man does get the money from Broadway by feeding whites white guilt.<br>

		<p>Why?  Because the blacks have more self respect than to be subjected to today&rsquo;s  &#8220;theatrical arts&#8221;.   I went to a Broadway play, and not being gay, I found it repulsive.  Never want to go back.</p>

		<p>Nowhere in this oh-so-trendy article is the most essential question addressed: why do we <i>care</i> what percentage of the Broadway audience is nonWhite?</p>
<p>If black-oriented shows aren&rsquo;t bringing in the paying customers, the obvious answer is to not produce black-oriented shows.  Why should there be a &#8220;struggle&#8221; to &#8220;diversify the audiences?&#8221;</p>
<p>I always had the naive idea that the purpose of a Broadway show was to entertain the audience and make money, not to serve as some sort of avant-guard street theater to uplift the colored masses.<br>

		<p>Looks like another example of trying to make an issue out of a non-issue.  Who cares?  But just wait until Je$$e and Al $harpton get a hold of this.  When they scream &#8220;racism&#8221;, that will change everything.  But, it may also backfire, by causing more bleeding heart liberal Whites, wracked with guilt, to attend black productions.</p>
<p>Maybe the real reason is, the theater staff members do a weapons check on the audience before they allow them entrance.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The black man created rock &#8216;n&rsquo; roll.&#8221; Actually, George Pullen Jackson made a very strong case for the theory that the ur-source of American music, black gospel, as well as the worship-style that accompanied it, were taken over largely unchanged from *white* styles prevalent in the Second Great Awakening of the early 19th century. But think about it  &mdash;  how much of the words, tunes, scales, instrumentation, etc., of black American music could possibly have come from Africa? How closely does it resemble authentic African music? What is a more likely source, closer to hand? Jackson spelled it out, through rigorous scholarship, 75 years ago. (And for the record, Jackson was a Yankee.) </p>

		<p>You&rsquo;re never going to see Blacks at Broadway plays in any significant percentages.  The obvious answer as to why there aren&rsquo;t more Blacks at plays on B&rsquo;way is not the politically correct answer.  But it is probably the c-o-r-r-e-c-t answer, and that is that Blacks do not appreciate any kind of forms of art, no matter what they are.  </p>

		<p>My impression of Broadway audiences is that they are mostly composed of people who like to do what they are &#8216;supposed&rsquo; to do.  Museum Mavens are the same crowd, I think.  And those who qvell over Diversity also do it because they&rsquo;re &#8216;supposed to&rsquo;.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Gays I know get sick looks on their faces when someone tries to talk Theatre or Show Tunes with them at parties.  But then, I seem to know only professional-class gays, who drive F-150s, go to rodeos, and like to build things, when they&rsquo;re not pumping Iron (which, apparently, is takes up most of their time.  The richer gays are, the more they seem to look like tanks..or Gorillas&hellip;).</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re the most open and honest Race Realists I know. They&rsquo;ve experienced rabid black/hispanic/middle-eastern homophobia, firsthand.  Don&rsquo;t be knockin&rsquo; our allies, guys.</p>

		<p>The last play my wife and I went to was &#8220;Inherit the Wind.&#8221; There were no blacks in that audience that I saw. Blacks couldn&rsquo;t follow a play like that. They&rsquo;d jumpout of their skin trying to follow the dialogue. It would be much too much for blacks to handle.</p>

		<p>10  &mdash;  Dalai Lima:</p>
<p>I essentially agree.</p>
<p>In all the talk of how blacks allegedly created rock and roll (out of thin air) few people ever discuss the origins of black music. Where and when and how did blacks learn gospel? Did it just spring out of nothing or was it an offshoot of white, church hymns? </p>
<p>Musicologists have speculated that the blues scale derived from Muslim calls to prayers. Did blacks hear this as Muslims or as slaves of the Muslims?</p>
<p>Black music didn&rsquo;t just spring out of thin air. </p>
<p>Rock and roll was the result of many influences. How much influence blacks had is debatable. What is also debatable is had rock and roll not been created, what music form would have evolved? I ask this question because blacks use the creation of rock and roll as both a &#8220;the white man stole black music&#8221; and &#8220;the white man owes me for creating Elvis and the Beatles&#8221;.</p>
<p>Musical creations simply wouldn&rsquo;t have stopped without blacks. </p>

<p>It was also pointed out to radical racists like Cassius Clay who called some of his opponents as &#8220;the great white hope&#8221; that 99% of all &#8220;paying&#8221; boxing fans were white. </p>

		<p> Why aren&rsquo;t more blacks at the opera or chamber music concerts? It&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re not interested! I don&rsquo;t know of a single African country, outside of South Africa, that has an opera company, chamber society or symphony orchestra. Obviously, the overwhelming majority of blacks would rather be at black oriented sporting events. This is fine with me.</p>
<p>All the &#8220;outreach&#8221; programs by well-meaning artistic liberals have really accomplished little or nothing in the last fifty years. Are there no blacks in so called musical &#8220;high&#8221; culture?  Of course, there are some: both as talented performers and as  very rare, well educated and cultured black patrons. However, I wouldn&rsquo;t depend on them to keep Western culture alive and well.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not a country-western fan, but I will never forget how a liberal acquaintance was very puzzled as to why, on a televised show dedicated to country music awards, there were no blacks in the large audience.  It was no use trying to explain to her that blacks have little to no interest in this white form of music (other than the rare non-white C/W performer) and never will.  </p>
<p>In fact, as &#8220;Awakened&#8221; has pointed out, blacks have little interest in anything that can be termed &#8220;cultural&#8221;.  Broadway&rsquo;s and Hollywood&rsquo;s catering to a segment that has little to no appreciation of the finer aspects of cultural continues to puzzle me.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m still trying to wrap my head around Disney&rsquo;s &#8220;The Princess and the Frog&#8221;.  How many black kids were actually taken to see this PC attempt?  All I know is that Walt would be turning over in his grave.<br>

		<p>Black people don&rsquo;t seem to go for much in the way of culture, or &#8220;high&#8221; culture. I like classical music, but you won&rsquo;t find many blacks in the seats at any live symphony performance. I like to read, but other than renting free movies at public libraries, not too many blacks there. Same for bookstores. Even jazz, an art form which you think would attract blacks because so many of its best practitioners were black doesn&rsquo;t draw much of a black crowd. Why would it be any different for theatre?</p>

		<p>If you want to see a complete lack of diversity even in a city like New York try the Met Opera, Met Museum of Art, or any classical concert at a place like Lincoln Center. The most non diverse activity in the world has to be downhill skiing. Just visit any major ski resort in North America or Europe and the lack of people of color would probably cause a PC multicult apostle to have a coronary. Only a moron would be upset by that. </p>

		<p>I agree with Ector&rsquo;s Brigade.  Plays are generally boring and gay.  I&rsquo;m on the black&rsquo;s side on this one.  No self respecting man should be caught anywhere near a play.</p>
<p>The kind of people in a Broadway audience are a great example of those responsible for putting our nation into its current state.  Too many of us have changed from a people that tamed the West into a people who just want to be &#8220;sophisticated&#8221; and &#8220;intellectual.&#8221;</p>

<p>Usually I like fantasy &amp; science fiction, but this premise does nothing for me.</p>

So we learn from Million Dollar Quartet that the black man created rock and roll which the white man expropriated.</p>
<p>And  what if the White man hadnt have  brought blacks to the deep south? What if the white man hadnt have invented the piano and saxophone and upright bass etc. What if the white man hadnt have invented the radio and the gramophone and given the technology to have amplified  sound? </p>
<p> Yep, any misearable fool can sing the blues.        </p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Exactly.  Few people ever stop to think of these things. <br>
Where did the clarinet and trumpet and bass viol come from?<br>
They seem to think these were just always there   &mdash;   like artifacts of nature. Do they &#8220;grow&#8221; on plants?  You just go out and pick them off trees, or dig them out of the ground? </p>
<p>Who studied and developed the musical scale?  The science of harmony, chords, musical keys?  Who developed the art of musical script?</p>
<p>WHITE PEOPLE invented them!   &mdash;    All of them.</p>
