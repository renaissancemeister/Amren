<h1><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/england/birmingham/10337961.stm">Plastic Bags to Be Put Over Birmingham &#8216;Terror Cameras&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, June 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Bags are to be put over dozens of surveillance cameras in parts of Birmingham with large Muslim populations, after local objections.</p>
<p>Safer Birmingham Partnership (SBP) said 218 cameras were put up, including hidden ones, mainly in the Washwood Heath and Sparkbrook districts.</p>
<p>The cameras were financed through a counter-terrorism fund, but the SBP said they would tackle all crime.</p>
<p>Councillor Salma Yaqoob said people had lost faith in the authorities.</p>
<p>The Respect Party councillor for Sparkbrook said: &#8220;In terms of reassurance it&rsquo;s going to take a lot more than plastic bags.</p>
<p>&#8220;The residents have lost faith with the authorities for their sneaky handling of the way they went about this and will not be reassured until they have been told the locations of the hidden cameras too.&#8221;</p>
<p>SBP  &mdash;  a partnership of the police, the city council and other agencies  &mdash;  said 72 cameras had been placed covertly but that they would not be covered by the plastic bags.</p>
<p>The partnership said it would not be placing bags on these hidden cameras because it does not want to reveal their location.</p>
<p>It said 106 cameras were Automatic Number Plate Recognition devices that were only trained on car registration plates at road level.</p>
<p>These are to be covered along with 40 other overt cameras, SBP said.</p>
<p>But none of the cameras  &mdash;  overt or covert  &mdash;  are to be used until a consultation has been carried out, SBP claimed.</p>
<p>The cameras were financed through the Association of Chief Police Officers&rsquo; (Acpo) Terrorism and Allied Matters (TAM).</p>
<p>In a statement in April, the SBP said it had received Â£3m from the Home Office to improve community safety and reduce crime in the Washwood Heath and Sparkbrook wards.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although the counter-terrorism unit was responsible for identifying and securing central government funds and have overseen the technical aspects of the installation, the camera sites were chosen on the basis of general crime data  &mdash;  not just counter-terrorism intelligence,&#8221; the SBP said on Thursday.</p>
<p>SBP said a number of concerns had been raised and it wanted to give people the right to express their views.</p>
<p>Roger Godsiff, Labour MP for Hall Green, said: &#8220;I put down an early day motion in the House of Commons expressing my concern about the way it had been handled and saying that there should be proper public consultation before the cameras are activated.</p>
<p>&#8220;If that&rsquo;s what the police have now decided to do, I applaud them for doing so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ayoub Khan, Birmingham City Council&rsquo;s community safety portfolio holder, said a detailed consultation ought to have taken place before the cameras were installed.</p>
<p>He said the partnership was now reviewing why this had not happened.</p>
<p>The camera idea was first proposed by Home Office counter-terrorism officers in April 2009, Mr Khan said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was informed that this was to attack anti-social behaviour and various other criminal behaviour with a bolt-on of some terrorism activity detecting too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Khan said because of the way it had been presented the idea received the support of many councillors, but explained that he had no idea that so many cameras would be installed in only a few Birmingham wards or that they would be &#8220;circling in&#8221; the community living there.</p>
<p>Steve Jolly, one of those who first began campaigning about the cameras, said people had been &#8220;misled&#8221;.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;Now the truth is out, there&rsquo;s a lot of anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certain communities have been ring-fenced and saturated with cameras, making it impossible for you to get in or out without being tracked.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&rsquo;s happening here is the government is spying on its citizens covertly in some cases, without their knowledge or consent, and it&rsquo;s a gross invasion of privacy and civil liberties.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Jolly described the latest developments as &#8220;a victory&#8221; and &#8220;a start&#8221; but added: &#8220;It&rsquo;s not the conclusion, though.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cameras are already in now. There&rsquo;s going to be a lot of reluctance to have them taken away.&#8221;<br/>

		<p>Birmingham, England was in the news recently because it wants to implement a Chicago-style &#8220;shot spotter&#8221; system, so that the authorities know where gunshots come from.  The day after, there was a gun fight in a night club in the city, and all the parties involved were black.  Seems to me you don&rsquo;t need an expensive gimmick to find out where gunshots are coming from, just look for the black faces.  </p>
<p>Point is, they&rsquo;re spending all this money on crime prevention systems, and you can&rsquo;t seem to use them against blacks and Muslims.  Why even have it to begin with?  Answer:  To find those guilty of the dastardly crime of handing out BNP leaflets.</p>

		<p>Yeah, we can&rsquo;t have cameras taking pictures in Moslem neighborhoods.  Think of all the Moslem criminals it might embarrass.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m sure they wouldn&rsquo;t find any security cameras watching them in their home countries.  They can always return at any time.<br/>

		<p>Was reading another article the other day and it mention England has around 20 courts now that are governed by &#8216;Sharia law&rsquo;. Wonder how many courts are set up by the BNP across the nation not bowing to political correctness?</p>

		<p>If you have cameras like this, it becomes alot harder to ignore crime.</p>

		<p>I have mixed feelings about this article.  On the one hand, street surveillance cameras to monitor the populace smacks of Orwellianism (the KGB, Securitate and the Stasi all used to do this, folks).  </p>
<p>On the other hand, these cameras would be unnecessary if the British government hadn&rsquo;t allowed all this Third World flotsam and jetsam to wash up on its shores.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m old enough to remember when the mainstream media used to regale the masses of the Great Unwashed with stories of surveillance cameras to show us how, unlike Eastern Europeans, we were &#8220;free&#8221;.  Of course, now that our government is doing this (example: street surveillance cameras are everywhere in Manhattan) it&rsquo;s ok because &#8216;it&rsquo;s for our own good.&rsquo; </p>

<p>Part of me chuckles at reading this article because it calls to mind another, similar situation we have here in Zoo York.  Streets in business districts have clearly marked signs informing drivers when they can&rsquo;t park there so that street sweepers can pass through.  Recently the city council passed an ordinance allowing lazy non-White drivers an extra five minutes to move their cars so they can avoid a ticket.</p>

		<p>Right, if &#8220;they&#8221; are offended in some way, &#8220;they&#8221; must be pampered and assuaged.</p>
<p>Please never do a thing to make &#8220;them&#8221; feel bad and only try to do whatever &#8220;they&#8221; want to make &#8220;them&#8221; feel comfortable.</p>
<p>British security is most worried about the Somali &#8220;refugee&#8221;, 10 % of which can field strip an AK blindfolded in less and a minute. With such a threat present, the threat manifesting itself or not, there is cause for worry? I think so.</p>

		<p>The hell with Big Brother and his spy cams! Cameras are being put all over America&rsquo;s cities as well and it has nothing to do with the phoney &#8216;War on Terror.&rsquo; Anyone with an IQ of 70 or better can tell you 9/11 was an inside job carried out by the Bush/Cheney regime. The Big Bad Wolf didn&rsquo;t huff and puff and blow WTC Building 7 over. It was done by controlled demolition. And that doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m a fan of Muslims. I prefer they remain in the own lands and not import their Sharia Law and cousin marriages to the West.</p>

		<p>Birmingham, my home town, was once a great place. Cars, motorcycles, rock bands. The epicentre of the Industrial revolution - City of a Thousand Trades/Workshop of the World.</p>
<p>In the last 3 decades however it has been flooded with Muslims and Afro&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Now it is a dump - and a dangerous dump at that. The whites are fleeing, I fled 30 years ago. Gun crime, gangs, Islamist terrorism, halal slaughter, honour murders, TB, Aids&hellip;&hellip;.the list is long.</p>
<p>The future for the UK is bleak.</p>

		<p>England, not Alabama.  At first I thought Birmingham Alabama.</p>
<p>Might be for the best.  The muslims can rob and assault each other with impunity because the perps can&rsquo;t be identified.  Then they can caterwaul, hoot and holler about how police ignore their neighborhoods.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s interesting is that when native British objected to the cameras, the government ignored them. But when it came to Muslims, the government takes action. Shows how low the indigenous people of Britain are being treated by their ruling class. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because unlike Muslims, all the native Brits do nowadays is complain.  Hundreds of years ago, if the government ignored the demands of the people long enough, they would have felt compelled to resort to more astringent measures.</p>
