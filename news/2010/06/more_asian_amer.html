<h1>More Asian Americans, Other Minorities Recruited in US Army: Report</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Nation, June 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The United States has seen a record high of Asian Americans and people from other ethnic groups getting recruited in the army, according to a study published on Wednesday.</p>
<p>This can be attributed to rising unemployment rate in the country during recession and the increased bonuses provided by the U.S. government, said researchers at RAND Corp., a non-profit think tank.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Usually Asian Americans were most unlikely to join the army and those who volunteered to join the army have the lowest rate of any ethnic groups. Asians make up 4 percent of the U.S. population, but only 1 percent of military recruits, statistics show.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One of the reasons behind the increase is that most Asian American parents want their children to &#8220;go to college&#8221;, and joining the army is one way to go to college since the U.S. Government will pay the four-year tuition for anyone who has served in the army and will go to college.</p>

		<p>I was an army recruiter in the Bay Area some years ago and that&rsquo;s true. Asian parents want their kids to go to college- period. There are a few exceptions - Filipinos will join. To the other extreme, Indians definitely will not join.</p>
<p>Asians aren&rsquo;t flag waivers and don&rsquo;t have the &#8220;honor to country&#8221; mentality that traditional Americans have. Their focus is pretty much economic.</p>

		<p>The Times of India runs articles which tell Indians about the advantages of acquiring Western citizenship.  </p>
<p>They are aware that they can save money on tuition by getting citizenship for the family, as opposed to paying foreign student rates.</p>

		<p>The second biggest threat after immigration to white people is lack of education.  East Asians and Indians because of their borg-like ways will study hours on end for high school exams and the SATs to get into good colleges.  This has created a situation where they are vastly overrepresented on America&rsquo;s most prestigious college campuses in turn driving down the number of white college students.  More white people have to instill a mindset for academic excellence and industry into their children.  I also think white people need to teach their children about their ethnic background.  Envy is a motivator.  Chris Rock once joked that white people would not want to be him and he&rsquo;s rich.  You can point out how well East Asians or Indians are doing in school and it won&rsquo;t motivate them to do better because they don&rsquo;t want to be East Asian or Indian.  I think re-ethnicizing white people will motivate them to do better.  Jews are the only white ethnic group that has maintained an ethnic identity and they remain the most successful group in the country.</p>

		<p>To be fair, the motives of many (not just Asian-Americans) are economic; but it could also be the case that sufficient time has passed such that descendants of Asian immigrants feel greater patriotism to this country. Simply assuming that those recruited are all non &#8220;flag waivers&#8221;, is an insult to those of them who are. </p>

		<p>The recruitment numbers are a bit misleading.</p>
<p>Look at the numbers for West Point.  Asians are 7% of West Point but only about 4% of the 18 year old population in this country.  So they are the most represented group.  They are even more over represented at the Air Force Academy.  </p>

		<p>Asian immigrants and their native born offspring have a built-in aversion to the military. In their own country of origin, the two most hated institutions are the police and the military. Persons in the old country that join the military and police are doing so for personal gain, and are noted for their abusive behavior toward their fellow citizens.</p>
<p>Filipinos ARE and exception to the rule. Filipinos for over 100 years have a close relationship to the U.S. military, many recruits doing very honorable service.</p>

		<p>Of course when Asians do join the US military they gravitate to the rear echelon occupations like most non-whites. This is because collecting benefits is what is most important, not &#8220;fighting for your country&#8221; and certainly not dying for this country. The dirty work jobs, ie fighting and killing is still done overwhelmingly by white males.</p>

<p>The Japanese were pretty patriot when it came to their own country in WWII. It would be interesting to see if more Asian-Americans buy an American car than white Americans (controlling for income - comparing their purchases with Americans of the same income level). I bet more of them buy an American car.</p>
<p>The military is an unpleasant occupation for most people and a physical occupation. You&rsquo;re &#8216;rights&rsquo; are taken away or suspended while you are in the military. Asians would be serving with other men who would be bigger and stronger than themselves. It&rsquo;s not too much different from prison. Once again, compared by income, low income Asian-Americans are probably less likely to join the military.</p>
<p>There were so many exceptions from the draft during the Vietnam era, the all-volunteer army is not much more unfair than it&rsquo;s previous incarnation. </p>

		<p>I think the lack of asians in the military has a great deal to do with their physique.  They&rsquo;re not exactly GI Joe.  They&rsquo;re of shorter stature, less muscle tissue and the men have some feminine qualities about them.  Another thing is the military is no place for the introverted, shy, timid and shower shy. When I was in the military I went through a grueling physical fitness curriculum that weeded out the weaker among us.  That was 20 years ago so it&rsquo;s possible the standards have been lowered like everything else.  </p>

		<p>I recall that Guam has lost more (mostly Chamorro) soldiers killed in the current wars than any US state.  I don&rsquo;t know for certain, but where Indians are concerned, the only ones that enlist in any numbers are Sikhs.  Sikhs seem to like armies.</p>

		<p>Asians have a history of migrating to places where they can outperform the host.  </p>
<p>The British recognized this and moved them around their empire, this being the reason Africa has an Asian professional and entrepreneurial class.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the United States, the Asians are frequently the shopkeepers in black neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Ask yourself if you want your son or daughter working for Asians. If they immigrate in large numbers, we will be forced to adopt their ant-like ways to compete for scarce opportunities.<br>

		<p>The majority of non-Whites joining the military in White homelands generally do so with two objectives in mind.  </p>
<p>1. To secure a certificate or diploma in some profession or trade through the many FREE training schemes whilst earning a living at the same time and for only as long as it takes to qualify.  The notion of patriotism is almost certainly absent in most of their considerations.  There are only a tiny handful of exceptions amongst them.</p>
<p>2.  Most will not join the regular army if they can help it and where they do so to earn a wage, will tend to seek out posts which do not place themselves in the combat line of fire.</p>
<p>Many attempts have been made throughout the West by self-loathing White Marxist Liberal non-White pet project lovers to recruit Western-born multi-ethic non-Whites, but still the success rate continues to be markedly dismal in stark comparison with the number of native White recruits.</p>
<p>It means that overwhelmingly, non-Whites have no concept of loyality to their adopted lands of habitation and never will have, and most certainly are not prepared to die in defence of them either.  This is because they know instinctively and honestly that White homelands are not their lands of racial and cultural origins, and never will be.<br>

		<p>I wonder how many of you have actually met an asian person thats in the US military? Seems like there is a bunch of blind conjecture here as to their motives for joining the army, as well as their performance in the army. (Even their physical aptitude)</p>
<p>Its a damned if you do, damned if you dont situation. If there was an article talking about how asians are the lowest recruited into the army then you would refer to them as spineless parasites unwilling to fight for their country, meanwhile, if the article is about their high rates of recruitment into the army then everybody gets on them for taking advantage of the economic incentives provided by the army. You know, asians are not the only group that join the army for those reasons. Most of the people my age (mostly whites) that have joined the armed forces typically do it more for the generous benefits than for simply serving their country. </p>
<p>As for asian men being less physically imposing etc etc, i&rsquo;d agree that this is generally true. However as to if this is the reason that there may be less asians in the military, i&rsquo;d have to disagree. I think its more of a temperament issue, i mean take a look at how many hispanics are in the military, many of them are about on par physically with asians; yet they still have a pretty big presence in the armed forces. Like i said, i think its more about temperament. (additionally one must take into consideration the fact that asians only make up a small fraction of the us population.)</p>

<p>Do you know this from personal observation and experience? Or is this just your conjecture? If you&rsquo;ve actually seen this happening in person then I won&rsquo;t argue against it, but it sounds to me like you&rsquo;re just assuming most of that. (I&rsquo;ve personally noticed that koreans have a penchant for joining the marines. Typically if there is an asian in the marines, it is a korean. And IIRC all marines go into combat. but that is only my personal anecdote, what about yours?)   </p>

<p>I would hate to be Chris Rock, even with his money because the man is psychotically obsessed with blackness, whiteness, and race.  I mean, we Amren posters could be so accused, but he is allowed to fester himself into creating material for performances that would be called hate speech if it were to be done off stage.  Wait a minute, Michael Richards (Krammer of Seinfeld) lost his career for doing it just once!</p>
<p>I hope Chris Rock goes mad and eats his own feet.</p>

<p>Such a typically American comment. To Americans size and height is everything. Putin or Medvedev would never have become president if they were Americans. </p>
<p>The fact is you don&rsquo;t have to be of GI Joe physique to make a great soldier.</p>
<p>The Gurkhas are smaller than the average Asian American and they make fine soldiers. </p>
<p>The Chinese People&rsquo;s Volunteers whupped the Americans in the Korean War, and the Viet Minh (acknowledged by a leading French commander as the world&rsquo;s greatest infantry) whupped the Chinese, French, Americans, and then Chinese again.</p>
<p>The Imperial Japanese army also did not give a bad account of itself during WWII.</p>
<p>And of course going back a lot farther in history we have the Mongol warriors, who defeated everything that stood in their way, Poles, Hungarians, Germans, and Russians included.</p>
<p>Of course even in Western armies there is no positive correlation between physical size and soldierly ability.</p>
<p>The great Audie Murphy was only 5&rsquo;5 and the only two times VC winner, New Zealander Charles Upham was very small in stature as well.</p>

<p>Firstly, the White population of the US is now only approximately 63% which means that 37% is non-White.  This being the case, we are still seeing the overwhelming military presence in terms of race to be, in fact, comprised of White recruits.  Explain that!  </p>
<p>Incidentally, this picture is repeated across the whole of the multicultured and diverse White world.</p>
<p>The use of the explanation for the stark lack of non-White recruits being down to <i>temperament</i> is a lame-duck excuse and you know it unless, that is, we are to assume non-Whites are perhaps basically yellow-bellied by nature.</p>
<p>Secondly, by your accusation, ie,</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Seems like there is a bunch of blind conjecture here as to their motives for joining the army, as well as their performance in the army.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>You are being entirely hypocritical yourself.  After all, your original post from which I am quoting in that case, could also be said to be composed of nothing but conjecture too. </p>

		<p>Those of you saying the Asians are avoiding the front line duties of combat I would say that you are wrong. I work with the military in the muslim wars and it is without doubt the blacks that avoid the combat units. The military to blacks, is a white girl hunting ground and white girls (and black women) are hounded mercilessly with no respite from officer intervention. White officers especially are loathe to do anything against blacks which is a sure career killer.</p>

		<p>The PLA did not &#8220;whup&#8221; us during the Korean War.  The US First Marine Division left the broken, withered wreckage of several Chinese army groups behind it, while it packed out its own dead, frozen in trucks.  One of Chaiman Mao&rsquo;s sons was among the Chinese KIA.</p>
<p>My wife&rsquo;s great-grandfather died sinking USS St. Lo.  Unfortunately, we went to war in 1941 under the impression that Japanese were merely extremely brave.  They were something a little different than that.</p>
<p>The German General Staff considered the Scottish 51st Highland Infantry Division the most &#8220;furchtbar&#8221; or dangerous of all Allied divisions during both world wars.</p>

<p>Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus (i.e. Octavian), the first Roman emperor and the man who destroyed Antony and Cleopatra, was said to be short for a Roman.</p>

<p>These lovers of stature also forget the ancient Romans were significantly shorter in stature than the Gauls and Brythonic Celts they conquered and ruled for four centuries.  The 1st. century B.C. Greco-Roman historian Diodorus Siculus described the Celts as &#8220;very tall, with rippling muscles under clear white skin&#8221;, implying they towered over the Romans who conquered them.</p>

<p>Attila the Hun, &#8220;the Scourge of God&#8221;, and the man who almost destroyed the Western AND Roman Empires, was also said to be short of stature.</p>

<p>The Huns, who terrorized much of Europe, were described by the 6th century AD Gothic-Roman historian Jordanes as a &#8220;stunted, foul and puny tribe.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Charles Upham was I think the only *surviving* member of the British armed forces to win a bar to his VC.  I think a few others (two or three) won their VC bar posthumously.  My wife&rsquo;s great-grandfather didn&rsquo;t even get a wooden cross, but he won the gratitude of a government that appreciates the grotesque sacrifices Japanese soldiers and seamen were expected to make.  He has a placque at the Yasukuni shrine.  Soldiers are soldiers and dead is dead, but Sakado-shi in Saitama Prefecture isn&rsquo;t being filled up with Somalis the way Lewiston, Maine is.  He won his war.</p>

		<p>John Liu has a point, in a sense, about the height not being inherently essential for being a soldier. East Asian were and are fine soldiers in their own militaries despite low height. North Koreans are probably shorter than any nowadays, but their military still does just fine. Nevertheless, it&rsquo;s not like American military going to run around in circles adjusting its practices and norms for people of the &#8220;wrong&#8221; size. The drill sergeants are used to dealing with people who look like a normal white city dweller, and they would not be happy to see people looking like a normal Chinese peasant. In China it might be the opposite, but that&rsquo;s none of our business.</p>
<p>In any event, there is nothing good about having Asians or Latinos in combat units or in important support positions. How enthusiastic would such soldiers be in a conflict against Mexico with Chinese support or, God forbid, conflict with China with Mexican support?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Firstly, the White population of the US is now only approximately 63% which means that 37% is non-White. This being the case, we are still seeing the overwhelming military presence in terms of race to be, in fact, comprised of White recruits. Explain that!&#8221;</p>
<p>Whats your point dude, that doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that a major reason for many recruits (regardless of race) are the financial/educational incentives. Furthermore, I see many blacks and hispanics joining the armed forces as well. And since as you say yourself that 63% of the population is white (still a majority) that also means that the majority of military recruits will be white. There you go, I explained it. Your argument as you crafted it makes little sense and does little to address my original point. </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;The use of the explanation for the stark lack of non-White recruits being down to temperament is a lame-duck excuse and you know it unless, that is, we are to assume non-Whites are perhaps basically yellow-bellied by nature.&#8221;</p>
<p>-Did you not bother to read anything I wrote closely? I wasnt talking about any recruit that is not white. I was exclusively referring to asian recruits. IF there is a lack of them, it is because either their temperament, their low percentage of the population, or probably a mixture of the two aforementioned reasons. </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;You are being entirely hypocritical yourself. After all, your original post from which I am quoting in that case, could also be said to be composed of nothing but conjecture too.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, not really. The things I say are educated conjecture based upon my observations of reality, as well as my own personal experiences. There is no hypocrisy here, I cautioned against BLIND conjecture. </p>
<p>A Swain, i can&rsquo;t help but get the feeling that you are a troll. Either that or you are extremely dense. Many of the things I said apparently went completely over your head. And a lot of what you responded with didn&rsquo;t even remotely address the things that I was originally talking about. Next time you respond, read over everything i have said carefully and then formulate an appropriate response that actually addresses the points that i have brought up.</p>

		<p>John is correct,throughout history asians have had their successful warriors all the way up to WWII when the Japanese volunteers fought valiantly. My 1st comment was about contempory asians who will, as a fact, stay away from military service. I think a lot of it has to do with disconnection from American culture as a whole. They really (vast majority) are not patriotic. Nice people, but they don&rsquo;t share the same culture or mentality that we have. They mostly focus on opportunities available to them, and not necessarily pride of being American. </p>

		<p>The US military, mostly within the pentagon and high level field officers, are, generally, as politically correct as our traitorous, greed mongering corporate types.  And, as such, they eagerly adapt any idea the PC dregs in Congress or the WH want them to.</p>
<p>But, this command structure is not by accident.  Carter started the ball rolling by advancing mostly politically correct types, but it was Clinton and his black traitorous Army Secretary, Togo West, and those like him heading the other branches of service that really pounded home a politically correct theme.  Feminists were put in charge of panels overseeing all aspects of all the branches of service.  Remember the ones calling the Marines &#8220;extremists&#8221; for not using women in combat roles and severely limiting their other military roles as well?</p>
<p>Bush, Sr. did much damage, also.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure it was he who ordered that ALL US military vessels were to have larger door wheels, so they could be opened by weaker females, plus many other adaptions had to be made as well, which cost an average of $500,000 per ship.  It was also Bush Sr. who bragged to the press that, &#8220;Woman leads invasion,&#8221; indicating that a female in charge of an MP unit went ashore at some point after the male combat troops in Panama, I believe it was.  She actually &#8220;led&#8221; nobody, but she was the ranking officer of the MP unit that went in with the support troops.  Bush&rsquo;s press secretary, Fitzwater, played it up big, as did the press, who hoped their lying and exaggerations made it possible for more women to secure more roles in the military.  It has always been one of their pet aspirations.</p>
<p>By the end of Clinton&rsquo;s last term, the military had many politically correct favorites advanced within the Pentagon, but, more importantly, the mood toward &#8220;diversity,&#8221; and &#8220;sensitivity,&#8221; was well entrenched.</p>
<p>Sensitivity training started with Carter whereby white enlisted men were given several days of derogatory comments about their families, their friends, their history and the white race in general, so they would &#8220;see how they liked it,&#8221; because the theory was that once they understood what blacks endured they would change their attitudes and be more &#8220;sensitive.&#8221;  The only problem was that blacks were never subjected to the same thing in real life.  The whole affair was a hare-brained idea pushed by some mentally disturbed leftist radical who was probably insane.</p>
<p>The whites called it &#8220;Watermelon School,&#8221; and they hated it and intensely despised the blacks in charge and the white officers who forced it down their throats.  At one point, one of geniuses in the military saw that it was causing rabid hatred among whites and decided to change things a bit or face a rebellion.  However, they still have a type of brainwashing, but it&rsquo;s different, something like what we see in the corporate world and that which is displayed by the media.</p>
<p>Much, much else of the same kind of corruption of the military went on for years, but it would take a book to list it all.</p>
<p>For anyone really interested in some great essays by an ex-commander, Commander Gerald Atkinson,  who has researched most all of this military PC, go to:<br>
https://www.newtotalitarians.com/index.htm</p>
<p>As it stands now, the deterioration of the military is occurring at an accelerated pace as most would expect, with the black community organizer in charge with a fixation to reduce whites as much as possible in every way, while elevating blacks as much as possible in four years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fairly certain we will see a military catastrophe of large proportions occur before the community organizer leaves office, because the military is much, much worse than every day people know.  Hardly no one is writing about it anymore.</p>

You could joke around with blacks about racial things and they&rsquo;d laugh right along with you.  You could do a &#8220;Miley Cyrus&#8221; with your eyes and hum a Chinese melody with an imitated gong and a kyoto instrument and an oriental would pretend you weren&rsquo;t in the room even though their face and ears would turn beet red.

		<p>First, there is no such thing as an &ldquo;Asian-American&rdquo;.  Second, it should never come as a surprise that asians don&rsquo;t do anything for America since their only concern is to strip mine the gold mine.  And you amren people love them because as many of you have said more than once, &ldquo;asians are more intelligent than White People&rdquo;.  Yeah, &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; they are&hellip;That&rsquo;s why their Countries are Third Worlds.</p>
<p>Now for all you asian lovers who love to post about how asians are &ldquo;so much more intelligent&rdquo; than White People&rdquo;, they may be smarter than you but they damn sure are not smarter than I.  Going forward on your praises for the hordes from the East, speak for yourself.  You may be &ldquo;White&rdquo; and dumb but KNOW that there are still some, while few we are, Intelligent White People who are not only much, much, much smarter than any asian out there but also work harder and have more Ethics and Morals combined.</p>
<p>Last but not least, you asian lovers, India is Number One when it comes to remittances and China does quite well too.  It doesn&rsquo;t end there.  They also get special ethnic privileges, cheat us via cheating our IRS and rotating family members (just another form of cheating the IRS) for example.<br>

		<p>Thanks to John Liu for reminding everybody that the 442d Regimental Combat Team was the most decorated American unit (Army, Marine Corps, or Navy) of WW II.  They were all Japanese Americans released from the internment camps to form the 442d RCT, though one would have thought that their imprisonment in the first place would have lessened their enthusiasm for serving their adoptive country.</p>
<p>Anyone who ever fought the hardcore Vietcong or the North Vietnamese Army, as I have, or the PLA in Korea would ever doubt<br>
the fighting effectiveness of Asian troops, whatever their relatively diminutive stature.</p>
<p>Asians in general in our country probably aren&rsquo;t attracted to the military simply because they&rsquo;re more often drawn into family businesses or the professions. </p>

<p>obviously you hold powerful delusions about the pervasiveness of &#8220;asian lovers&#8221; here at amren. In all of the comments for this article, there are very few that could be considered pro asian, and there are absolutely none that could be considered pro asian/anti white. So i&rsquo;m not really sure what you&rsquo;re going for with your little rant. A little objectiveness to your views wouldnt hurt, but its pretty obvious that you&rsquo;re pleased with yourself and your myopic views.   </p>

<p>-I don&rsquo;t know how much I agree with your assertion about contemporary asians and the military. I&rsquo;m not gonna lie and say that there are massive amounts of asian americans joining it, but I do see a pretty good number joining. Also, I do believe that the biggest reason why there are not that many asians in the military is because they only make up about 5% of the US population. Also take into consideration that world war 2 was a much bigger war, so obviously there would be a lot more asian (japanese) volunteers. You have some good points though, i imagine the real truth of the matter probably lies somewhere in between our opinions on the subject.</p>

<p>Its also a possibility that since there were only a few asians, the asians there saw it in there best interests to keep a low profile and suck it up. Juxtapose the situation and imagine if you were the very rare minority being made fun of by someone from the majority? Chances are, you would not say much either. I imagine that since asians were very rare in the military at that time, the incident (incidences?) that occured were probably taken personally as opposed to being seen as what they were, a joke. If there were greater numbers of asians in the military, i&rsquo;m sure that the butt of the joke would be able to see it wasn&rsquo;t personal or anything. (Kind of like how the blacks [probably not numerous at the time, but did have a decent presence] could joke around with you about racial stuff)</p>

		<p>We can&rsquo;t live in a PC fairy universe with unicorns and rainbows and everyone&rsquo;s the same 24 hours a day to keep from offending someone.  Sometimes reality comes crashing in whether we like it or not.  Physical stature is the number 1 issue why orientals stay away from the service.  I&rsquo;m 5&rsquo;10&#8221; and about 240 lbs of solid mass and I was considered a runt among my command.  The average oriental male is about 5&rsquo;6&#8221; not 5&rsquo;10&#8221; as one poster would have us believe.  Jeeshhh, we&rsquo;ve got eyes in our heads so face the fact you come from a race of short people instead of creating all this distraction.  Does it matter?  In the military, yes! If I&rsquo;m standing next to a guy in a combat zone who weighs all of 135 lbs and has a body like a prepubescent 10 year old, am I going to feel confident that he&rsquo;ll be able to carry me to safety if I&rsquo;m injured?  NOOOOOOO!  I&rsquo;m not willing to risk my life or the life of my platoon for some feel good social experiment.  </p>

		<p>This was an interesting comment thread; I see traditional AMRENer&rsquo;s an apparent real-deal asian, and a couple of trolls.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll throw in my two cents.  I suspect many asians view the military as less ideal than college because a military career doesn&rsquo;t get much on the outside. They agressively chase the American Dream by whatever means are available to them.  Sure, they&rsquo;ll game the system if they can; they&rsquo;ll also work 2-3 jobs and live in a shoebox to build a business and put their kids through college.  Despite the anacrhonism of the white country club noted by &#8220;Anonymous,&#8221; Asians are prospering just fine. </p>
<p>I also disagree with some of the other postings about representation of different races in the military.  With the exception of Asians, other ethnic groups are proportionately represented in the military, as well as in the Iraq/Afghanistan casualty statistics.</p>
<p>Now to temper this with something worthy of Amren, I will say to those posters that note Filipino exeptions in the military that Filipinos don&rsquo;t count as asians.  In the asian world, its Japanese, Chinese, and Korean that are considered asians.  They have no love for Filipinos, Vietnamese, etc., and do not classify them as asians.  Asians are the most racist people I&rsquo;ve ever met.</p>

<p>I was comparing motives here if you had interpreted what I said correctly which you had not. In other words, non-Whites are likely to be motivated by the free higher education opportunities and, of course, salary rather than loyality, moreso than White recruits.<br>
 <br>
<i>&#8220;Furthermore, I see many blacks and hispanics joining the armed forces as well.

<p>Everybody is aware of non-Whites joining the forces, you are not the only one seeing it.  Again, you missed my meaning.  Approximately, sixty-three percent of the population is White, leaving 37% as non-White yet the 37% non-White ratio is not correspondingly reflected in the ranks of the military.</p>
<p>(The use of the explanation for the stark lack of non-White recruits being down to temperament is a lame-duck excuse and you know it unless, that is, we are to assume non-Whites are perhaps basically yellow-bellied by nature.)</p>

IF there is a lack of them, it is because either their temperament, their low percentage of the population, or probably a mixture of the two aforementioned reasons.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Look, temperament has nothing to do with it. Do not these non-Whites have armies and, in most cases, navies in their own homelands of origin? I&rsquo;m sure Asian and most other non-White governments don&rsquo;t select their recruits on the basis of temperament since in those countries as far as I&rsquo;m aware, military training is compulsory.  </p>
<p>As regards your &#8220;low percentage of the population&#8221; remark, the Asian definition does not only refer to the many ethnicities of Oriental background, it includes Indians and Fillipinos by way of just a few examples.   You are trying to suggest that the Asian population makes up a low percentage?  I would imagine, using my own quantative judgement and experience of observation that collectively, Asians make up a rather significant percentage of the American population these days. What, with the relentless invasion from both India and China utilizing the Works Permits scam, for example.</p>
<p>(You are being entirely hypocritical yourself. After all, your original post from which I am quoting in that case, could also be said to be composed of nothing but conjecture too.)</p>
<p><i>&#8220;No, not really. The things I say are educated conjecture based upon my observations of reality, as well as my own personal experiences. There is no hypocrisy here, I cautioned against BLIND conjecture.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>And who are you to caution against blind conjecture! Do you actually believe you&rsquo;re the only individual here able to arrive at an educated conjecture based on observations of reality and personal experience? I detect a clear case of baseless arrogance since all you are doing is offering conjecture yourself and then attempting to qualify it by admitting that your utterances are educated conjecture based on, etc, etc, etc without any evidence.</p>
