<h1><a href="https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2010/06/could_america_handle_an_angry.html">Can a President Be an Angry Black Man?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Frank James, National Public Radio, June 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>All the talk in recent weeks about President Barack Obama not being angry enough over the BP oil spill has gotten me thinking, isn&rsquo;t that what helped him get elected in the first place, that his calm mien made him a non-threatening figure for many voters being asked to take a risk on a black politician from Illinois so relatively unknown nationally?</p>
<p>Over the course of American history, after all, the angry black man hasn&rsquo;t exactly been embraced, not unless he was a sports star or a character from the entertainment world like Mr. T.</p>
<p>Real angry black men have been a decided turn off for most Americans, to say the least.</p>
<p>Take Nat Turner of Virginia slave uprising fame was probably the nation&rsquo;s original angry black man, at least the one who got the earliest publicity.</p>
<p>Enraged about the cruelty and suffering visited upon him and his fellow enslaved blacks, he decided to do something about it, slaughtering whites as part of an ultimately unsuccessful slave revolt in 1831. He was caught and hanged.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Even though he had mellowed in the years just before his death, it was the earlier Malcolm who said: &#8220;Be peaceful, be courteous, obey the law, respect everyone, but if someone puts his hand on you, send him to the cemetery&#8221; who remained stuck in the American psyche.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably no accident that one of the least publicly angry black men, Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., became one of the nation&rsquo;s greatest heroes. King knew his audience, which was white Americans at least as much as black Americans. Being non-threatening was the only way to melt white resistance and make civil rights progress.</p>
<p>Try as I might, I can&rsquo;t come up with examples of black men, or women for that matter, who&rsquo;ve been able to routinely flash anger publicly and still achieve success at the highest levels of government, corporate, or academia.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The president seems on some level to have bought into the notion he needs to show more anger. Witness his comments Tuesday morning on the Today Show when he said if it were up to him, BP CEO Tony Hayward would be so fired already. Also, he said he needed to &#8220;know whose a** to kick&#8221; over getting results in stopping the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and cleaning up the damage.</p>
<p>Maybe he senses that America, having proven it was ready for a black president now is ready for an angry black man as president. Maybe he&rsquo;s right.</p>

Poet Rita Dove claimed, in a bit of a jealous manner, &#8220;back then (in the 60&rsquo;s) all you had to do is be a black male and angry about something to get published&#8221;.</p>

		<p>NPR is a liberal outfit that prefers blacks of the angry type who spout colorful rhetoric that will make good sound bites for their stories. The non-angry appearing blacks just aren&rsquo;t as entertaining for them. All blacks must be made to dance to the liberal music of victimology and say the right things. Liberal profiling on display here, they&rsquo;re the worst ones of all when it comes to pigeonholing other groups of people.     </p>

Angry or not Obama seems utterly powerless in the face of this crude oil spill and seems incapable of understanding where ultimate responsibility for cleaning up this mess truly lies: with the President.   The President is commander and chief and its his responsibility to mobilize the nation in a time of crisis.   Unfortunately someone forgot to send this memo to Obama.   </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always believed that it was crazy to have BP cleanup this mess because it&rsquo;s unclear if they are the most qualified party and it&rsquo;s definitely unclear if they&rsquo;re even honest about what&rsquo;s happening on the ocean floor.  It&rsquo;s impossible to assess BP&rsquo;s progress without objective data and oversight, unfortunately we seem to have neither.  </p>
<p>Honestly Obama should just take a vacation and let Bush and Cheney handle things for a few weeks, or least until this disaster has been cleaned up.  </p>
<p>Although I am no great fan of Bush I think he has Obama beat in one department: he has always been able to own his actions. </p>
<p>Bob Woodward: Late last year, he had key Republicans up to the White House to talk about the war, and said &#8216;I Will Not Withdraw Even If Laura And Barney Are The Only Ones Supporting Me.&rsquo; Barney is his dog.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2006/10/01/woodward-bush-says-he-wil_n_30712.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2006/10/01/woodward-bush-says-he-wil_n_30712.html</a></p>
<p>Although I think Bush wasn&rsquo;t a great President I feel that he was a true Mensch by comparison to our current Commander and Chief.  He was a responsible leader who tried to do his best,although I agree with his detractors that his best obviously wasn&rsquo;t good enough Bush never lacked heart.</p>

		<p>Oh, but Obama HAS displayed anger.  More than once.  And each time it was anger in favor of blacks and against whites, or in favor of his liberal agenda and against middle America, or in reaction to ANY criticism of himself or his policies.  It&rsquo;s not that folks are saying he hasn&rsquo;t displayed anger Mr James of the National Proletariatan Revolution.<br>
It&rsquo;s the he never seems to display ANY emotion over those things he SHOULD.  Such as an invading army of illegals from across the border, or muslim extremists, or the crime rate, or the real enemies of this country, or assaults on the Constitution.  Nope.  He displays anger and rudeness or apathy to our longest standing allies.  But not against BP.  Why?  Because he received his greatest contributions from BP.  To our enemies he bows.  To our allies he snubs or gets angry.  To Revolutionaries and terrorists and illegals he identifies.  To middle America he has only contempt.</p>
<p>But dont&rsquo; tell us Obama has never displayed anger.  </p>

		<p>&ldquo;Maybe he senses that America, having proven it was ready for a black president now is ready for an angry black man as president. Maybe he&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maybe he is also very wrong as well, Comrade James!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you plug the hole yet, daddy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps, he should prove himself competent first and forget about being &ldquo;angry&rdquo; at white America. After all, the country is still roughly 65% white and might not be ready for the croissant Communist to start his messianic Mau Mauing just for a bit. He has yet to end either the recession or the wars in the Middle East, so maybe he better just cool his head, have another beer with some professor of color, and think about if he wants to be impeached and tried for treason, and then get the Nat Turner treatment himself.</p>
<p>Or better still, he might want to watch it for another reason. It is not inconceivable, that some angry white man of means, so long degraded and vilified by the multicultural propaganda machine, isn&rsquo;t just waiting for our &ldquo;beloved&rdquo; General Secretary to show his real color, and capitalize on it in 2012. Moreover, such an outcome might just see all the spades and bleeding hearts removed from the deck, once and for all.</p>
<p>I say, may God let it be so!</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t blame Obama for the BP disaster any more than I blame Bush for Katrina.  Nowhere does the Constitution say that the President is supposed to be an expert in plugging deep sea oil leaks.  The hard truth is that essentially all of the people with the skills to deal with this problem are engineers working for the oil companies or the supporting industries.  So I&rsquo;m not so sure that any other President would have done much better on this issue.  The best that can be done at the political level is to remove all caps on liability so that oil companies are aware that if they cut corners and cause $5 billion of damage they will have to pay $5 billion plus billions more in penalties.</p>
<p>It seems to me that people complaining about Obama&rsquo;s handling of the oil spill are getting mad for the wrong reasons.  Obama&rsquo;s court appointments are disasters.  His $1.6 trillion deficits will cripple this country.  His advocacy of illegal immigration is traitorous.  During the election Obama opposed the Patriot Act (good), but as President he reauthorized it.  Obamacare is an abomination.  Count me out of the Obama fan club.  But the oil spill is BP&rsquo;s fault, not Obama&rsquo;s.  Unless the Navy or the Corps of Engineers has some brilliant scheme to plug the leak there&rsquo;s not much the government can do beyond putting plenty of legal and financial pressure on BP to speed things up.<br>

		<p>Funny, I&rsquo;ve never noticed any angry Koreans, Japanese, Chinese, Indians, Poles, Russians, or Latvians among our immigrant populations. Apparently only blacks feel it necessary to display anger and menace toward others. Could it be a chronic lack of self-control or perhaps the realization that they can&rsquo;t compete successfully (outside the realm of athletics) with other races?  Perhaps that explains their overwhelming propensity for criminal and violent behavior.  </p>

<p>  President Obama is not popular with American voters because he is angry and black, but because he is ineffectual. He has not proven to be a strong or capable leader. </p>
<p>NPR is basically a cheerleading society for the East Coast Liberal Elite. They are a hypocritical bunch of diversity-worshipping liberals, who, I believe, have been sued in the past by disgruntled black correspondents. Their constant celebration of &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; and low-brow culture is irritating in the extreme. </p>

		<p>From a distance I get the feeling that no one is running America at present. America seems to be just drifting, where, who knows. What has happened to the great American spirit that produced the great Texas Oil Men like &#8220;Red&#8221; Adair? The sort people who could get things DONE. The leak would have been plugged by now.<br>
The oil leak is not the President&rsquo;s fault but real leadership will get more done than feigned anger. And as for BP, they are only supplying a product that is an essential need for the whole modern world.<br>
From a distance it would be difficult to hate or dislike President Obama  but if he does not lift his game America will just drift into the 3rd world with 3rd world law &amp; order and debt problems. America used to be the greatest nation on Earth, BHO is not doing anything to restore this greatness.<br>
The BP oil disaster is a bit like the Iran hostage crisis in the late 70&rsquo;s. It went on and on, under President Carter, for an eternity, embarassing and humiliating America. It was solved in one day by the election of President Regan!<br>
Wake up America before it is too late.</p>

		<p>An angry white man simply wants the right to govern his own country and take care of his family.  An angry black man wants to get back at whitey, take the white man&rsquo;s possessions, &#8216;plant his seed in his wife and daughters&rsquo;, and kill whites as their end result.</p>

<p>Agreed America&rsquo;s enemies are probably laughing their heads off at this guy.  Obama&rsquo;s bizarre combination of feigned outrage/indifference is causing far more damage to America than any of America&rsquo;s enemies.  I am reminded of that wonderful parable about the writing on the wall:</p>

<p>Before the Civil Rights Era, blacks complained that they were always portrayed as happy and all that.  Now they&rsquo;re mad they are portrayed as angry.  You really can&rsquo;t win with blacks!  Hell, women and children aren&rsquo;t even this flip flop with their wants.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;Real angry black men have been a decided turn off for most Americans, to say the least&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>So many of us who have had the unfortunate experience of working around angry blacks know that the smallest, most innocuous thing sets them off on an out-of-control rage of yelling, screaming and accusations of racism  &mdash;   when losing an argument, when presented with indisputable facts of theft  or when asked to do something they consider  unreasonable such as show up on time for work.</p>
<p>Irrational, hyper-sensitive blacks, having little to no reasoning power, scream loudly, become aggressive, storm around and threaten everyone in sight.  This is their idea of presenting &#8216;their side&rsquo; and winning an argument  &mdash;  and they well know it intimidates most Whites into acquiescing to their demands. </p>
<p> We Whites also know that in front of the media, the EEOC, SPLC or any other of the myriad groups that advocate for non-Whites over Whites, we Whites are automatically guilty, because we are White, and we will never win, even when indisputable facts are on our side (this is part of the larger War on Whites about which blacks know nothing  &mdash;  they do indeed think it&rsquo;s all about them).</p>
<p>But blacks will tell each other that they &#8216;Put One Over On The Man&rsquo; or &#8216;Old Whitey was Shaking in His Boots.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Black anger, often manifested in violence, is a cover for an inferior intellect, part of their frustration at an incapability of functioning in a First World Technological civilization that requires an IQ two to three standard deviations above theirs and a lack of ability to compete on a level field with Whites and Asians.</p>
<p>The only solution is to avoid blacks whenever and wherever possible and if you must work with them, keep your distance.  Avoid all conversation with them and if you must communicate, talk only about what is necessary for business.  </p>
<p>My experience in the schools is that most blacks have been steeped in a &#8216;hate Whitey&rsquo; culture since birth, are aggrieved, despise Whites and will happily do whatever is necessary to get you (White) fired  &mdash;  they have sided with students over me, lied to my bosses about me behind my back, and I&rsquo;ve been accused by them of all kinds of racism.  After these experiences I am now 100% distrustful around all blacks as I know most would stab me in the back if they could.  </p>
<p>Great Quote:  &ldquo;Be peaceful, be courteous, obey the law, respect everyone, but if someone puts his hand on you, send him to the cemetery&rdquo; </p>
<p>We Whites are well advised to embed this into our collective psyche, let blacks know this will be the case  &mdash;  and Let Everyone You Care About Know.</p>

Well, Leonard Jefferies is an angry racist Black, with a Ph.D. in African American studies, who used to teach at NYU. He was a tenured professor&hellip; until he got kicked out for some of the hateful and nonsensical things he used to teach to his students.</p>
