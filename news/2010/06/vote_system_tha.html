<h1>Vote System That Elected NY Hispanic Could Expand</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jim FitzGerald, Google News, June 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The court-ordered election that allowed residents of one New York town to flip the lever six times for one candidate  &mdash;  and produced a Hispanic winner  &mdash;  could expand to other towns where minorities complain their voices aren&rsquo;t being heard.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The unusual election was imposed on Port Chester after a federal judge determined that Hispanics were being treated unfairly.</p>
<p>The 2010 Census is expected to show large increases in Latino populations and lawsuits alleging discrimination are likely to increase, said Rob Richie, executive director of FairVote, a nonprofit election research and reform group.</p>
<p>&#8220;The country&rsquo;s been changing in a lot of places, with minority growth in exurbs and commuter cities, and there will be a realization that those minorities can&rsquo;t elect candidates of choice,&#8221; Richie said.</p>
<p>That will leave minority groups, federal prosecutors and municipalities looking for ways to keep elections from violating the federal Voting Rights Act, which protects minorities&rsquo; constitutional right to equal protection under the law.</p>
<p>In Port Chester, trustees had been elected two at a time every two years, with conventional at-large voting. Most voters were white, and there were always six white trustees even though Hispanics made up half the population and nearly a quarter of the voters. Judge Stephen Robinson concluded the system violated U.S. law by diluting Hispanics&rsquo; votes.</p>
<p>The standard remedy was to break a municipality into districts, with one district including many from the minority, thereby increasing the chances for a candidate backed by the minority group. The Justice Department proposed that solution for Port Chester.</p>
<p>But the village of about 30,000 objected to districts. It suggested instead a system called cumulative voting. All six trustees would be elected at once and the voters could apportion their six votes as they wished  &mdash;  all six to one candidate, one each to six candidates or any combination.</p>
<p>The system, which has been used in Alabama, Illinois, South Dakota and Texas, allows a political minority to gain representation if it organizes behind specific candidates. Judge Robinson went for it, and cumulative voting was used for the first time in a New York municipality.</p>
<p>Peruvian immigrant Luis Marino, 43, finished fourth, making him Port Chester&rsquo;s first Hispanic trustee.</p>
<p>&#8220;It helped me get elected,&#8221; said Marino, a Democrat who works in maintenance at the Scarsdale schools. {snip}</p>
<p>Voters also elected a black trustee for the first time: Joseph Kenner, a Republican who was already on the board as an appointee.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Marino&rsquo;s victory might prompt other judges to consider cumulative voting as a remedy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Until there&rsquo;s a separate analysis of the votes, including who did well in Hispanic neighborhoods, it won&rsquo;t be known for sure if Marino was actually the preferred candidate of Latino voters.</p>
<p>&#8220;The election of a Hispanic candidate does not necessarily mean that a Hispanic-supported candidate was chosen,&#8221; McLaughlin said. &#8220;But it&rsquo;s definitely a step forward.&#8221;</p>

<p>In short, they just admitted that the concept of &ldquo;one man, one vote&rdquo; that we forced on South Africa, violates the rights of minorities, even white ones, but they could care less so long as it equals nonwhite &ldquo;power.&rdquo; They also admit that a political process with a white majority, needs to be eradicated, from their viewpoint. Their windy words and ideas are all so much multicultural terrorism, masking &ldquo;tolerance.&rdquo; That is what they are about and what they want normal and thinking human beings to swallow, like so much waste flushed down a toilet!</p>
<p>They are destroying themselves, and what a pity that is. The only problem being, they are determined for the rest of to join them in this foul and fetid drowning in their utopian gutter of sanctimony and idiocy.</p>

		<p>So much to say&hellip;</p>
<p>I always thought that the person who got elected was the one who did the best job of convincing likely voters to choose him or her.  </p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not good enough, because hispanic candidates don&rsquo;t seem to spend any time campaigning in what was once an all-white town, and is now a half latino, half white town.</p>
<p>So if the latino candidates won&rsquo;t do the grueling organizing and legwork, and if they won&rsquo;t work to build coalitions with white voters, and if they won&rsquo;t tell white voters how they will work for their interests as well as their own people&rsquo;s interest, well then in the old days we would say that there isn&rsquo;t political will on the part of the candidates to really go for the office.</p>
<p>So enter the liberals, who say if white people won&rsquo;t vote for hispanics (in enough numbers), and if hispanics won&rsquo;t vote (because most are illegal in town) then we need to rig the system to make sure a person wins BECAUSE of their race and nothing more.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter which latino wins, as long as a latino wins.</p>
<p>So under this logic, then majority black towns need to be remedied so that white candidates can take office, too.  </p>
<p>Oh, we&rsquo;re not a &#8216;protected class&rsquo; as one of Obama&rsquo;s justice department lackeys called non-whites.  &#8220;Protected Class&#8221;?  I have never heard this before!  That is the worst kind of race based politics.</p>
<p>My friends, as our white land becomes more and more non-white, look to more and more of this forced dispossession through unfair means.  Don&rsquo;t think that you can run to your whiteopias and be safe.  They will be forcibly integrated at some point.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think fantastically that WHEN (not if) whites become a minority that we will somehow be called a protected class and we can stick it to the majority blacks, latinos and asians for affirmative action.</p>
<p>Once they&rsquo;re in control, they will never relinquish it.  They are not pacifist, social justice, celebrate diversity people.   They look out for their own.  Only whites developed enough to begin to empathize with the &#8216;other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sadly, it is that great leap of enlightenment tolerance that was our evolutionary undoing.</p>
<p>By the way, don&rsquo;t harbot fantasies about escaping to Russia or eastern Europe to live in all white places.  The Third World is rapidly entering there, even as we speak.  Google blacks, asians, etc in the european nation of your choice.</p>

<p>My question is simple.  How and why did whomever decide to set the number of votes at six?</p>
<p>Give ol&rsquo; whitey one vote, and give the illegals 90 votes.  How would that be un-FAIR?  Just go ahead and give everyone BUT whitey 90 votes.  Why stop at six?</p>

		<p>The problem of low-reading comprehension levels strikes again. With cumulative voting, EVERYONE still has an EQUAL number of votes. </p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&rsquo;t matter which latino wins, as long as a latino wins.</p>
<p>So under this logic, then majority black towns need to be remedied so that white candidates can take office, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>And this outburst:</p>
<p>&#8220;Give ol&rsquo; whitey one vote, and give the illegals 90 votes. How would that be un-FAIR? Just go ahead and give everyone BUT whitey 90 votes. Why stop at six?&#8221;</p>
<p>Everyone has six votes and only citizens can vote  &mdash;  what on earth are you talking about? </p>
<p>Things would be a lot better in south africa today if they had instituted cumulative voting  &mdash;  it would be possible for whites to concentrate their votes and get candidates to protect their interests in office instead of the ANC winning everywhere except in gerrymandered majority-minority districts. Unless you&rsquo;re in favor of simple tyranny of the majority everywhere (something the founders warned against) this is a good thing and makes it possible for well organized small groups with the same interests to have their voice heard instead of having to take over an  entire political machine and shut everyone else out.</p>
<p>What I suspect is that a lot of posters here are not really in favor of democracy but see democracy as a tool for white supremacy in majority-white countries. This is short-sighted and completely disregards places where whites are a minority, since  the legitimacy of practicing the racial supremacy of the majority is accepted in principle.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, Jonathan, you are correct in this assumption as to a possible future for what is now the US.  The &#8220;Road Warrior&#8221; scenario is also called &#8220;Bandenkrieg&#8221; in German, and was a major feature of the 30 Years War in Germany (1618-1648).  One of the most destructive wars in European history, this conflict killed some 1/3 of the German population.  This future, while not optimal, is better than that which activist courts like the one responsible for this travesty offer us.</p>

		<p>First of all, everyone is getting to spend 6 votes on whomever they want.</p>
<p>If your enemies elected someone by a concerted effort of putting all their 6 votes on the same guy, your group could respond by doing the same thing and the system would work just like the old one. </p>
<p>If your enemies got an advantage by spreading their 6 votes over 4 different enemy candidates, then you need to find some candidates on your side who are more moderate.  The kind who will please everyone a little even if no one likes them very much.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t seriously be that naive to think that cummulative voting would ever be used to help a white minority elect a white representative.  Further, the article doesn&rsquo;t make it clear that all voters get 6 votes, just that the end result would hopefully see a hispanic elected.  </p>

		<p>An interesting side effect of this is that it basically forces whites to be racist in order to get political representation.</p>
<p>The method is OVERTLY racist.  Its efficay relies specifically on minorities &#8220;getting behind a specific candidate&#8221; based on the race of the candidate ONLY.  The implication is that there will only be one hispanic candidate (else the vote would split) and his qualification is his race.</p>
<p>Here is a simple question&hellip;..why should whites pay taxes when they are divested of political representation because of racism?  They should not.  Most of the tax base will probably flee New York.</p>
<p>The time is soon coming when these people take control of a subset of American lands and what we think of today as the USA will shrink.  That is the bad news.  The good news is what we see here will not be tolerated.  And in the end, whites win by simply being better at everything than other races.  They feed off of us parasitically&hellip;.but, lately, have gotten arrogant about it.  They live by being handed everything by whites and are now openly spitting on us.  It&rsquo;s taken a long time for whites to understand the contempt since it is so contrary to OUR nature but it is sinking in, now, finally.</p>
<p>Once the handouts stop, non-whites will simply collapse as their various peoples.  They can&rsquo;t even feed themselves, let alone maintain civilization.</p>

		<p>It is precisely this kind of policy that further entrenches and exacerbates racist and nationalist tensions. The assumption behind the problem is that any result which does not mirror the census report is inherently biased and unfair. The assumption behind the solution is that racial groups  &mdash;  and in this particular case, Hispanics  &mdash;  do not already sufficiently organize themselves as a political bloc. The hope, then, is that there is an increase in political organization along racial lines (particularly Hispanic)such that where the census indicates there are 48% Hispanics, e.g., 48% of the vote goes to an Hispanic candidate. And the assumption behind that desired result is only Hispanic candidates can truly represent Hispanics, only White candidates can truly represent Whites, only black candidates can truly represent blacks, etc. And if that is the case, then race is the single most important component of personal identity. Race is more important, e.g., than religion or vocation. Otherwise, we would evaluate the fairness of our elections based on outcome by religion or vocation. All of this is very surprising (at least to me); all I have been hearing about for the 3 years is the need to move beyond and transcend race  &mdash;  to create a post-racial society even. Yet our federal judges  &mdash;  in rulings lauded by both liberals and moderates  &mdash;  are openly and emphatically rebuilding our democratic institutions upon a foundation of race politics.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
The problem of low-reading comprehension levels strikes again. With cumulative voting, EVERYONE still has an EQUAL number of votes. <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Perhaps, though some of it may well be based on sarcasm.</p>
<p>The problem with your argument being that not everyone has six votes.  Some have more on the simple basis that they can vote once for every _non voter_ who didn&rsquo;t turn up to make their opionion heard.  As another suggested, perhaps because they are illegal aliens.</p>
<p>This-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
The court-ordered election that allowed residents of one New York town to flip the lever six times for one candidate &mdash; and produced a Hispanic winner &mdash; could expand to other towns where minorities complain their voices aren&rsquo;t being heard.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Does not agree with this-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
In Port Chester, trustees had been elected two at a time every two years, with conventional at-large voting. Most voters were white, and there were always six white trustees even though Hispanics made up half the population and nearly a quarter of the voters. Judge Stephen Robinson concluded the system violated U.S. law by diluting Hispanics&rsquo; votes.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Which means that this-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
The unusual election was imposed on Port Chester after a federal judge determined that Hispanics were being treated unfairly.</p>
<p>The 2010 Census is expected to show large increases in Latino populations and lawsuits alleging discrimination are likely to increase, said Rob Richie, executive director of FairVote, a nonprofit election research and reform group.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Is to a large extent scaremongering in pursuit of enablement-industry power brokering.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Everyone has six votes and only citizens can vote &mdash; what on earth are you talking about? <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simple.  IT&rsquo;S OUR LAND.  We want to keep it that way rather than have a repeat of Mexico where &#8216;degrees of whiteness&rsquo; dictate the native Indians are seen the same way blacks are here and the Mestizo&rsquo;s play a game of self delusion thinking they are paler than their neighbor while the real whites (all of them highly wealthy and educated) divide up BILLIONS in monopolized industry and services management whose legality of syphoned profits sis assured because they are run through intermediate hedge group or &#8216;on the same board&rsquo; (=nepotism/croneyism) vote control.</p>
<p>This can happen so long as we are not fragmented into island populations, enjoying none of the benefits of scalar economics (why the voters didn&rsquo;t want to be redistricted) and so long as we have enough WHITE CHOICES in candidates that the political divisions by party prevent dominance by external PACSIG type controlling groups.</p>
<p>As soon as whites become isolated, not only does their civic mindedness disappear (as a voting percentage of total population) but they lose their voice as a function of criticizing their leadership and replacing them with someone more in line with their views.</p>
<p>The irony here being that Hispanics _do not care_ about politics.  Even 4th/5th generation types merely want the socioeconomic benefits and handouts of living in our society, not the hassle of party allegiances.  This has been proven, over and over again, even in places like California where &#8216;winning the Hispanic vote&rsquo; from a state that has _73%_ of this nation&rsquo;s Hispanic population has resulted in such tiny percentage fractions overall that White Republicans have LOST Presidential races for want of voting against their racial interests amongst those who do turn out.</p>
<p>The one exception to all of which is Race Based agendas which Hispanics can always be trusted to miss a day of work to march in the streets for.  And this is what will indeed destroy our nation.  Because as multi-party balkanization has done in Iraq, (essentially reducing goverment to screaming matches and voting block predation) so will it do here.  And Democrats who count on sweeping together a grab bag of minorities to displace the natively conservative Republican white majority will instead find themselves facing NEW parties who elect based on this presumption that &#8216;voting six times&rsquo; when you have 100 million people will make you victorious.</p>
<p>And it certainly would.  If you create a social conscience based on playing the victim card.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
What I suspect is that a lot of posters here are not really in favor of democracy but see democracy as a tool for white supremacy in majority-white countries. This is short-sighted and completely disregards places where whites are a minority, since the legitimacy of practicing the racial supremacy of the majority is accepted in principle.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Rubbish.  Democracy can work for one ethnic group, well educated and with common belief systems as it never can as an influence peddling multicult buyoff attempt by some panjandrum who has convinced him or herself that they actually can relate to &#8216;everybody&rsquo; enough to get elected by a &#8216;diversity&rsquo;.  Of opinions, wealth, goals and capabilities.</p>
<p>There are frankly not enough resources as is and the more slices of the pie you cut for each group, the thinner those slices get.</p>
<p>Forget socioeconomics, look at history:</p>
<p>The Romans tried to invite in the Goths and ended up cutting their own throats -precisely because- they treated them like ethnic wage slaves.</p>
<p>The Egyptians did the same with the Numidians, conquering a people they weren&rsquo;t willing to subjugate or eradicate.</p>
<p>The Babylonians had Cyrus.</p>
<p>The Gauls tried &#8216;accomodating&rsquo; Charlemagne.</p>
<p>The Indians thought surely the White Settlers would have to run out of people /some time/.</p>
<p>History is FILLED with instances where a people who could get along, internally, did so.  Until they had their societies means of existence stolen and their culture overrun and destroyed by outsiders.</p>
<p>This time it is being done willingly, on the basis of pity that 60-80% of White Americans AGREE (democracy in action) we don&rsquo;t have to feel for these people.</p>
<p>Mexicans have Mexico.  We don&rsquo;t want their mess.  Any of it.  Let them fix their own nation before they come screaming for the keys to ours.</p>
<p>This Is Our Land.</p>
