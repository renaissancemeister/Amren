<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Andrew Warren, a former CIA station chief in Algeria, pleaded guilty in federal court here Monday to drugging and raping a Muslim woman while stationed in Algiers.</p>
<p>Dressed in prison garb and walking with a limp, Andrew Warren, 42, appeared in a Washington, D.C., federal courtroom to plead guilty to one count of abusive sexual conduct and one count of using illegal drugs while possessing a firearm. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to two former CIA officials, Warren was a rising star at the CIA before he was charged with sexual assault. He was a fluent Arabic speaker who had converted to Islam, making him an ideal officer in the Middle East for the intelligence agency. He was recalled from Algeria in October 2008 and then fired after two women came forward and accused him of rape, accusations which were first reported by ABC News&rsquo; Brian Ross in January 2009. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Bureau of Diplomatic Security</b></p>
<p>Warren&rsquo;s fall from grace was dramatic. Before being posted to Algeria, Warren had served in Egypt, Afghanistan, and a stint in that CIA domestic station in New York. It was in New York, a few years after 9/11, that supervisors spotted him as a potential star, ready to be deployed around the world as a spy. Within a very short time  &mdash;  four years  &mdash;  Warren had been posted as station chief in Algeria.</p>
<p>According to an affidavit filed by the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, two women in separate incidents alleged that Warren gave them drinks that caused them to pass out and then sexually assaulted them at his Algerian apartment while they were in a helpless unconscious or semi-conscious state.</p>
<p>In the first case, the alleged victim claims that Warren prepared a mixed drink of cola and whiskey. The woman stated that she felt a &#8220;violent onset of nausea,&#8221; and Warren said she should spend the night at his home.</p>
<p>When she woke up the next morning, according to the affidavit, &#8220;she was lying on a bed, completely nude, with no memory of how she had been undressed.&#8221; She said she realized &#8220;she recently had engaged in sexual intercourse, though she had no memory of having intercourse.&#8221;</p>
<p>The second victim&rsquo;s account also states that Warren allegedly drugged her before raping her. &#8220;While drinking the second apple martini, [Victim 2] suddenly felt faint and felt the immediate needed to vomit. V2 described the sudden and violent onset of the illness as nothing like the physiological effects of alcohol related sickness that she had experienced when she consumed alcohol on previous occasions. V2 stated she immediately began to pass in and out of consciousness. V2&rsquo;s recollections of the ensuing events are characterized as passing in and out of consciousness, due to the debilitating effects of the illness,&#8221; the affidavit states.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Victim 2&rsquo;s] next recollection was being located in Warren&rsquo;s upstairs bathroom, on the floor. V2 could see and hear, but she could not move. Warren was in the bathroom, and he was attempting to remove V2&rsquo;s pants. Although V2 could not physically resist Warren, she was able to speak, and she asked him to leave the bathroom. Warren continued to undress V2, and told her she would feel better after a bath. V2 stated that she had difficulty comprehending what was happening to her. Eventually Warren was able to remove V2&rsquo;s blue jeans, boots, and her blazer,&#8221; the statement said.</p>
<p>Allegedly, the woman remembers being in Warren&rsquo;s bed and asking him to stop, but according to the affidavit, &#8220;Warren made a statement to the effect of &#8216;nobody stays in my expensive sheets with clothes on.&rsquo;&#8221; She told the Diplomatic Security agents that, &#8220;as she slipped in and out of consciousness she had conscious images of Warren penetrating her vagina repeatedly with his penis.&#8221;</p>
<p>Diplomatic Security Special Agent Scott Baker noted in the affidavit, &#8220;The victims&rsquo; symptoms were consistent with drugs used to facilitate sexual assaults.&#8221;</p>
<p>U.S. officials also said that a search of Warren&rsquo;s residence uncovered many tapes of Warren engaged in sex with women, including at least one tape that shows a woman in a semi-conscious state.</p>

<p>Well, while I do feel sorry for the Muslim women who got raped, it is apparent that this story goes to the core of our multicultural madness in the USA. Clearly this man is black  ( http://www.laosnews.net/story/644936)  and as a convert to black American &ldquo;Islam&rdquo; was supposed to be &ldquo;respectful&rdquo; and &ldquo;culturally compatible&rdquo; with the CIA areas he was not just stationed in, but running. Oh, what a big &ldquo;surprise,&rdquo; that went the way of &ldquo;non-racial&rdquo; South Africa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Enough said there, except this: Islam&rsquo;s &ldquo;leadership&rdquo; had better understand that the Communist overlords in the West that aid and abet their terrorism and invasions of our civilization are so bloody Red, that they make an overripe cherry in the August sun, look pink. </p>
<p>It is a horribly ironic partnership….and it would be deserved, if others did not suffer because of it. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>In their excitement to get a real live black person for this position they turned a blind eye to a huge red flag: conversion to islam. A psychologically stable person doesn&rsquo;t just jump ship and convert to islam; this bespeaks a person with some inner problems. In this case he got into a jam by being brazenly criminal in a foreign environment. But in the run up to this what has he done and gotten away with when he had greater control of and familiarity with his terrain? He didn&rsquo;t just start all this as a 40 yr old, typically people of this sort begin their depredations in their youth. His supposedly astute employers never noticed anything fishy about this &#8220;star&#8221;?  </p>

		<p>How ironic that the &#8220;sensitive&#8221; issue of rape was brought up. Warren should be executed as should any rapist but the double standard is disgusting when one considers that number of non- Muslim women raped every day in their own countries by these invaders while their Imams condone it from their pulpits ( or whatever you call them). I wonder if the two victims will now be murdered for having become damaged goods? </p>

		<p>This guy is a light-skinned Bantu, but a Bantu nevertheless. So. what&rsquo;s his excuse going to be, that he converted to Islam, and wanted to sample an Islamic woman?</p>

<p>Well, this is correct? And is a surprise to me too. It used to be that CIA officers were almost strictly from the Ivy League schools. I guess the agency has become diverse. With all that means. Give them an inch and you know what.</p>

		<p>  As I&rsquo;ve mentioned in other posts, one of the problems facing Islam in America are the jailhouse conversions of too many black criminals. These people generally don&rsquo;t help the respectability of Islam. Mr. Warren, who appears mulatto, was not only a probable criminal, but another insincere American black convert.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m curious as to why he was not prosecuted by an Algerian court for this.  Do CIA station chiefs carry diplomatic immunity?  Time in an Algerian prison would be a more just punishment than he could receive here in the US, and would certainly better mitigate the social stigma his victims must carry in a Muslim country.  Algeria is a bit more civilized than places like Somalia, where in 2008 a 13 year-old girl was stoned to death in a soccer stadium as punishment by a Sharia court for having been gang-raped by three men, but the women may be subject to &#8220;honor&#8221; killing by family members.<br/>
