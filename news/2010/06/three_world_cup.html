			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Times News Line (New Delhi), June 9, 2010 </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Three foreign World Cup photo journalists were robbed of money, passports, cameras and computers at gunpoint early on Wednesday morning, according to South African police. Police Col. Charmaine Muller told the media that armed suspects entered three hotel rooms where the journalists were staying near the town of Magaliesburg.</p>
<p>A Portuguese photographer was held up at gunpoint and two other journalists also were robbed at the same World Cup hotel. The other two journalists sharing his three-bedroomed lodge then discovered they had been robbed as they slept.</p>
<p>A suspect pointed a gun at him and told him to keep quiet, he said.</p>
<p>No one has been caught yet by the police and the investigation is taking place to catch the unknown robbers.</p>
<p>World cup soccer tournament starts on Friday in South Africa for which hundreds of thousands of sports fans and journalists are descending to South Africa to be a part of the biggest sporting event in the world this year.<br>

						<p>Portuguese photographer Antonio Simoes was in South Africa to shoot the World Cup when he was robbed at gunpoint in his hotel room yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Two men entered his room at the Nutbush Boma Lodge at about 4am, pointed a gun at his head, and stole roughly $35,000 worth of camera equipment. Two other journalists staying in the hotel were also robbed that same morning.</p>

<p>My question is, after they have suffered first hand, will they report what happened or continue with &#8220;diversity is our strength&#8221;?</p>

		<p>And so it begins.  We knew it would.  Why didn&rsquo;t THEY?  What did they think would happen?  The predicted economic boom for SA was never about ticket sales.  It was always (for the South Africans) about robbing, raping, and hijacking visitors.  This is just the beginning.  The South African police are about as useful and honest as the New Orleans/Katrina cops.  They either ignore crime, go home and be safe, or participate in the crimes.  Black is as black does.</p>

		<p> Gee, fellers, not a word about the race of the robbers! Maybe the lights were off and the victims couldn&rsquo;t see them clearly. Maybe the thieves ordered the victims to keep their eyes closed the whole time.</p>
<p> And maybe the felons were black Africans, and the reporter was afraid to state that   &mdash;   &#8220;racism,&#8221; you know. At least we know that one journalist was Portuguese and therefore, probably, White. What race were the other two victims?</p>
<p> I&rsquo;ll bet you a dollar to a doughnut that it was strictly a black criminals-White victims incident, which the press is very, very leery of describing as such in so many words.</p>

<p>Robbed?  Nonsense!</p>
<p>What these black businessmen were doing was making a more equitable distribution of weath, as a payback for thousands of years of oppression by these foreigners.</p>
<p>Here, in America, we call it:  &#8220;Spreading the wealth around.&#8221;</p>

<p>I could not have phrased it any better myself.  After the news involving these three journalists broke on Wednesday, my father said to me &#8220;Well, your prediction about crime surrounding the World Cup was spot on.&#8221;  I replied by telling him to wait a couple weeks, and then he can give me some credit.  In the meantime, strap on your seatbelts.</p>

		<p>We have a whole month  &mdash;  June 11 to July 11, for various horrors to emerge from South Africa during the world cup, but whether the MSM covers it  &mdash;  or covers it up  &mdash;  is another matter. Me, I&rsquo;m fully expecting the latter.</p>

		<p>Just another day in South Africa with richer pìckings now having arrived.   Many may not know but SA is 10 times mre dangerous to live in than the USA.  And you Yanks thought you were the &#8220;best&#8221; at everything.  God bless America.</p>
<p>Who knws perhaps the Press will now shout out more about the true modern South Africa.</p>

		<p>  You can bet that the controlled media, like NPR, will have a blackout on World Cup crime. After all, why spoil Africa&rsquo;s celebration with the legacy of Apartheid? I already saw one report on how Africa had the &#8220;roots&#8221; of European Football.</p>

<p>Soprano,<br>
Isn&rsquo;t this unbefreakinlievable?  The primitives certainly are true to their words. The raping will begin shortly. They managed to pull these capers off in hotel rooms. God help the women who encounter them.  I wonder how bad it has to get before the truth explodes in the faces of these mind numbed pendejos blancos.</p>

		<p>Will the journalists in question and those who will (inevitably) be similarly assaulted report their stories?  Will the MSM choose to report on these incidents at length, or will they be buried in panegyrics to Mandela&rsquo;s South Africa?</p>
<p>Personally I would like to see a piece entitled &#8220;The World Cup is Decadent and Depraved&#8221;.</p>

<p>How about White hating black hotel employees who sympathize with &#8221; the movement&#8221; to kill and rape Whites during the games GAVE them keys?</p>
