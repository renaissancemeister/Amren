			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kevin Cullen, Boston Globe, June 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For much of the last century, the official record was that the first African-American police officer in Boston wasn&rsquo;t hired until after the great police strike in 1919.</p>
<p>Then, a while back, Margaret Sullivan, the Boston police archivist, found an obscure reference in a book written by a 19th-century police chief to &#8220;the first colored officer&#8221; being appointed in 1878.</p>
<p>There was no name, so Sullivan, who is a civilian but would make a very fine detective, kept looking. She compared the police payroll, which listed names, with the 1880 Census, which listed race, and she found Horatio Julius Homer.</p>
<p>Then she started looking for descendants and she found Homer&rsquo;s granddaughters, Lillian and Maria Homer, who live in Cambridge. In February, Sullivan asked the Homer sisters to meet her at the Parker House.</p>
<p>When the sisters got to the hotel, they found Police Commissioner Ed Davis; Dan Linskey, the police superintendent in chief; Bob Anthony, a cop in East Boston; and Sullivan waiting for them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found your grandfather,&#8221; Ed Davis said. &#8220;He was a very important man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sullivan found the existence of Sergeant Horatio Julius Homer buried deep in the files of the Boston Police Department and newspaper archives and the Boston Public Library. Then, Anthony found the body of Sergeant Horatio Julius Homer, buried in an unmarked grave in Brighton.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the last gasp of an enlightened period in the city,&#8221; Sullivan said. &#8220;There wasn&rsquo;t another black officer appointed over the next 30 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Horatio Homer was a renaissance man. He played 10 musical instruments. He memorized a poem each day, and, given his name, was especially interested in Greek literature. He was a Republican, the party of Lincoln, and belonged to a black man&rsquo;s political club.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>All of this was unearthed by Sullivan and Anthony, part of an effort by the Police Department to learn more about its history as the oldest police force in the United States. Davis is a history buff.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Homer is believed to have been the second African-American police officer in the United States, appointed two years after a black officer was hired in Cleveland.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And on Saturday at 10 a.m., in Evergreen Cemetery, a great oversight will be corrected, and a piece of Boston history will be recognized. A headstone will be unveiled over the grave of Sergeant Horatio Julius Homer, a cop who read poetry and carried secrets, from the commissioner&rsquo;s office all the way to his grave.</p>

		<p>It is amazing how many very famous Blacks are yet to be acknowledged.  In our town, we are trying to document the first Black to use a telephone and the first Black to purchase something in a store.  When we find who they are, we will erect bronze monuments or even statues. We will have speakers and bring forward their grandchildren, and each year we will teach in our schools these great achievements.  Kids will be bused in from around the County to view the spot and remember the great deeds of these individuals of color, in the face of constant racism. </p>

<p>One could suggest many things,  but with such a paucity of information, nobody could draw the conclusion that &#8220;enlightenment&#8221; (with regards to the racial divide) had anything to do with his hiring. </p>
<p>This is &#8216;spin&rsquo;.<br>

A couple points.</p>
<p>If they didn&rsquo;t know about this guy, how many other black historical incidents are they also wrong about?</p>
<p>If this guy was the police cheif in 1878, what does that tell us about the alleged horros of post-slavery racism in America?</p>

<p>This has to be one of the most absurd and sickening examples of multiculturalism gone wild, that I have read or witnessed in a long time!</p>
<p>So what does this demonstrate for us in 2010, that we need more &ldquo;affirmative&rdquo; actions toward getting more blacks as policemen today? Or is it that we need more &ldquo;affirmative&rdquo; actions to get black cops on the poetry circuit?</p>
<p>White guilt always spreads thin these days, however, this is an example of the most &ldquo;transcendental&rdquo; and translucent kind!</p>
<p>You called it poetry and made &ldquo;progress:&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Quick, someone send this to Glenn Beck! He seems to delight in exhuming obscure black figures(or more often than not, mixed-race types)and engaging in the kind of revisionism that would make many a leftwinger blush. </p>

<p>Who believes anything they say? Only an idiot would. Blacks don&rsquo;t even believe it. Though they always seem to be defending a lie till the end, I honest believe most of them don&rsquo;t truly believe it either. It&rsquo;s only made up information we need to memorize for our next &#8216;diversity&rsquo; test. Now the most important subject of all. Good thing we are excel at memorization. </p>

		<p>This is very nice, and  he sounds like a commendable person. I don&rsquo;t mean to take any credit away from him. <br>
But how many white policemen also read poetry or played musical instruments?  Are they going to be commemorated too? </p>
<p>Really, what was the big thing about this man - aside from the fact that he was &#8220;black&#8221;.  (And I wonder just how black he was.)</p>

		<p>This sounds more like a &#8220;special interest&#8221; or &#8220;life and society&#8221; type story than anything else.  If I were a granddaughter of this policeman, I would be interested in knowing about my grandparent, as well&hellip;but I doubt many others would be.  It doesn&rsquo;t sound like the family went seeking adulation or an investigation into their ancestors.  It is the liberals who like to latch on to these personal-interest stories and attempt to make them relevant to everyone else. </p>

		<p>I disagree with most of the criticisms above. It is a nice article about an African American who discovers an ancestor to be proud of.  What it reminds me of is that we European Americans also need to take pride in the discoveries of our ancestors. Pride of heritage is what is key in my opinion!</p>
