			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Samantha Chang, Examiner, June 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The news that Angelina Jolie has been hired to play Cleopatra in an upcoming biopic has some in the African-American community fuming that Jolie is &#8220;too white&#8221; to play the famous Egyptian pharaoh.</p>
<p>&#8216;WHY NOT A BLACK ACTRESS?&rsquo;</p>
<p>A recent Essence.com commentary entitled Another White Actress to Play Cleopatra? insists:</p>
<p>&#8220;Honestly, I don&rsquo;t care how full Angelina Jolie&rsquo;s lips are, how many African children she adopts, or how bronzed her skin will become for the film, I firmly believe this role should have gone to a black woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another blogger wrote:</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t dispute Jolie&rsquo;s dramatic skill but really, enough of this! This is Hollywood&rsquo;s third time casting a White woman to play Cleopatra  &mdash;  in 1934, actress Claudette Colbert, in 1945, actress Vivien Leigh, and the latest, Elizabeth Taylor in a 1963 version.</p>
<p>HISTORIANS CLAIM CLEOPATRA WAS &#8216;SHORT, FAT &amp; HOMELY&rsquo;</p>
<p>A better question might be whether the gorgeous, slim 5&rsquo;7&#8221; Angelina is too beautiful and skinny to play Cleopatra, since historians who studied relics from her reign suggest she was &#8220;short, fat and homely.&#8221; Coins also indicate she had a pointy chin, thin lips and a hooked nose  &mdash;  a far cry physically from Jolie.</p>
<p>In addition, Egyptologists maintain that Cleopatra was a descendant of aristocratic Greeks and didn&rsquo;t have any African lineage at all.</p>

		<p>All historical evidence depicts Cleopatra as of Macedonian descent, as were all the Ptolemaic dynasty rulers of Egypt.  To keep the bloodline pure, Cleopatra was married to her brother as were previous Queens and Kings in that dynasty. The same so-called controversy surrounds Hannibal of Carthage, where historical evidence never depicts him as a Sub-Saharan African, but rather as from Mediterranean stock (likely Phoenician) as were the Romans, Greeks, Egyptians and other peoples of the area.  There is absolutely no proof for these claims, which normally would be laughable except that now because of political correctness, these types of undocumented assertions are taken seriously.</p>

		<p>Cleopatra was a Ptolemy, of Macedonian Greek origin. Alexandria was no more an African city than Hong Kong is. Don&rsquo;t these people read history at all? This is information easily obtainable in a survey course on Western Civilization. I guess they don&rsquo;t teach that at &#8220;Historically Black Colleges&#8221;!

		<p>Afrocentrists can&rsquo;t seem to grasp the basic historical fact that Cleopatra was a Macedonian Greek descended from Ptolemy I Soter I, Alexander&rsquo;s general. Racially, Cleopatra wasn&rsquo;t even a native Egyptian, much less a sub-Saharan black.</p>
<p>The Black Cleopatra crowd are living in a fantasy world, however. They&rsquo;re absolutely convinced that the entire western world owes all of its ideas and institutions to blacks who founded Egypt and then mysteriously forgot everything they knew. Apparently, the evil whites sucked all those ideas out of their heads like zombies.</p>
<p>As for Angelina Jolie, I&rsquo;m against casting her as Cleopatra because she&rsquo;s a lousy actress. The worst. Fantastically over-rated.The English actress Lyndsey Marshal would be a thousand times better. A million times better. Marshal played Cleopatra in HBO&rsquo;s series Rome and she was great  &mdash;  the best Cleopatra I&rsquo;ve ever seen. Way better than Elizabeth Taylor, for instance, and definitely better than Angelina Jolie.</p>

<p>She was a blue eyed blonde, very pretty, but not beautiful and extremely intelligent and personable, very well read and intellectual and a master of statecraft (how else to captivate the two dominant men in her world, Julius Caesar and Marc Antony).<br>

		<p>Ahhh, a subject of great interest to me, being Greek on my father&rsquo;s side.  I love to argue with Afrocentrics  on this subject, since I don&rsquo;t argue from a white guy&rsquo;s point of view, but from a Greek&rsquo;s point of view. Can&rsquo;t call you racist if you can pull out the ethnic card!  Who am I kidding, they still do.</p>
<p>Mary Lefkowitz wrote a well researched book &#8220;Not out of Africa&#8221; that demolishes all of the afrocentrics arguments and theories about supposed cultural theft of African ideas and identities.  She has a whole chapter on Cleopatra.       </p>

		<p>To 8  &mdash;  Sosthenes and 9  &mdash;  Sissy White:</p>
<p>Nordicists have often been just as guilty of rewriting history as Afrocentrists.  Take both of your claims that Cleopatra was fair-haired (and Sissy&rsquo;s claim she was blue-eyed).  It should be noted modern historians point out the whitewashing of Cleopatra began during the Renaissance.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2006/aug/19/theatre.history" rel="nofollow">https://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2006/aug/19/theatre.history</a></p>
<p>&#8220;The storyline shifts. So does Cleopatra&rsquo;s appearance. For several hundred years she was blonde. She was a famous beauty, and so medieval poets ascribed all the conventional attributes of beauty to her: hair like spun gold, sky-blue eyes and breasts &#8220;as white as ivory billiard balls&#8221;. The tradition was persistent.</p>
<p>Cleopatra is not the only victim of the tug-of-war between Nordicists and Afrocentrics over the corpses of the peoples of ancient Egypt.  Queen Nefertiti, who unlike Cleopatra was an ethnic Egyptian, has also been claimed by both.  Neither side wishes to let the historical evidence speak for itself.</p>

		<p>The Blacks, who are making a stink over a caucasian portraying Cleo, have no interest in historical facts. To them, the genetic composition of the Egyptian Queen is irrelevant. Being able to impose their view that Cleopatra was Black, means that they have dominated Whites. This is what the Essence crowd cares about. </p>

		<p>All the posters hit it right on the head.  All historical evidence is that Cleo was white.  Do you think Mark Anthony or Caesar would&rsquo;ve shacked up with a women who was black with nappy hair?</p>
<p>Black people seem to think that every last soul on the continent of Africa was black as in Western or southern Africa black.  Truth be told, there is a big desert (the Sahara) that has kept north Africans from integrating or looking like the Bantus save for periods of invasion from the Berbers and the taking of black slaves by the Arabs.</p>
<p>North Africans are Berbers, Arabs and the descendants of Phoenicians and some Greeks with only slight African genes due to slave mistresses.  Hence we say the &#8216;Mediterranean look.&rsquo;  They have no semblance to a Michael Jordan or Serena Williams look.  I know lots of north Africans and none of them look black nor do they claim to be so.</p>
<p>In addition, the ancient Egyptians were not black.  Yes, the laborers had brown skin from working in the sun.  There were brief periods where east African blacks from Aksum in the south ruled over the Egyptians, but anyone who takes an honest look at the thousands of paintings left behind through the millennia cannot come to any other conclusion than that these people were not of black stock.</p>
<p>Again, they were more Mediterranean than anything else, with some dark trends, but the hue of most of the rulers seems to be brown to very light brown.</p>
<p>For crying out loud, look at King Tut&rsquo;s death mask!  No black features at all!</p>

		<p>Cleopatra was a descendant of Ptolemy, a general of Alexander the Great.  She was not black, and was at least as white as Angelina Jolie, who is of predominant European ancestry with some Iroquois mixed in.  We live in an age of extreme political correctness, where even Hannibal was depicted in the Washington Post as being a black African, which he was not.</p>

		<p>I am a little confused.  African Americans describe anyone who has black blood in their veins as black.  Angeline Jolie is described elsewhere as being of mixed black/white race.  Then surely, as far as the African Americans who are complaining (as usual?) she qualifies especially as he has the famous African rear that develops on all African women who get overweight.  It was a safety reserve of fat for the lean times when the Africans had to endure famines.</p>

<p>There is an article in todays Daily Mail Online that deals with the question of why Barry Mao Obama Soweto (or whatever his real name is) hates the British.</p>
<p>In it, the reporter quotes Barry&rsquo;s Kenyan (black) grandfather&rsquo;s third wife (because she is the only wife still living).  This widow quotes her husband as having asked at one time: &#8220;How can we defeat the white man when we can&rsquo;t even build bicycles?&#8221;</p>

		<p>Regarding the anonymous poster who waxed so enthusiatic about Lindsey Marshall as Cleopatra, I checked her out on that link.  I know nothing about her skills as an actress, so I can&rsquo;t comment. She may be a splendid actress.  But, in the photos, the character she portrays is FAR TOO DUSKY to be a person of pure Macedonian descent (which Cleopatra was)    &mdash;   nor any kind of European, for that matter.  That is a sop thrown to the Afro-centrist crowd. And her thick, matted, heavy  braids are far too similar to dreadlocks. (I doubt that dreadlocks were in fashion or even known back then in Egypt!)  No way could that be considered an accurate portrayal.  Additionally, the story line of  that TV production was highly fictionalized as well.  It may have been interesting drama  and good acting (again I can&rsquo;t comment) but history it was not.</p>

		<p>As to Jolie&rsquo;s mixed race status, I googled this fact and found that she apparently has some Native American blood.  In the South, I think this is extremely common among both whites and blacks.  Both latter ethnic groups still identify, however, as white and black.  Both Anglos and Latinos who have a small amount of Native heritage ID as white.<br>
Jolie also sparked some controversy when she played Danny Pearl&rsquo;s &#8220;of color&#8221; wife.  But the movie industry, of course, usually cares little about historical or social accuracy.  Top draws have always been cast as famous characters.  <br>
There was a TV movie about Cleopatra in 1999.  I saw the video in a local library and thought the title character was a light-skinned black woman with dark blonde hair.  Today, I checked on the actress&rsquo;s ethnicity and found she&rsquo;s a (probably white) Chilean with black hair.  I don&rsquo;t know whether the front of the 1999 video was trying to &#8220;have it both ways&#8221; by presenting her as whatever the viewer perceived or wanted to perceive.  I never believed the historical figure was black, but figured the TV movie industry was trying to draw blacks.  <br>
Anyway, movies today seem even more fantastical than they were at their inception.  Gender is so bent and confused that there seems to be little difference in the motivations and actions of men and women.  The Sex in the City gals behave like urban gays on the make, and even Maid Marian suits up in armor.  Classic monsters and superheros have become CGI cartoons.<br>
Afrocentrism claims the ancient Egyptians could fly.  Maybe Jolie&rsquo;s Cleo could do that.</p>

<p>You believe what you want to believe. And this &#8220;movement&#8221;, what you could call it, to declare that Cleo and other ancient Egyptian rulers were &#8220;black&#8221; [meaning the same as a west African] has had some troubling and bothersome capitulations. The National Geographic in particular gave in to protestors and has had an article dealing with the Nubian rulers of Egypt, portraying the Nubian rulers and their soldiers as having the appearance of west Africans etc. The Geographic has headquarters in DC, so I guess they have to be wary?</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;Go to google and type this: Cleopatra Coin&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>As an amateur (very amateur) numismatist, I am familiar with coins that depict Cleopatra.  Each coin is like mini-history lessons  &mdash;  a non-revisionist one, that is!  Maybe that&rsquo;s why I love them so much, peering into each coin, gazing at long-forgotten Ozymandias-type rulers and studying the statist symbols of ancient Rome depicted throughout American coinage (if you have a Mercury Dime, flip it over and take a good look at the back, you&rsquo;ll see a beautiful depiction of a fasces, old Rome&rsquo;s symbol of power).</p>
<p>And coins don&rsquo;t lie (well, the real ones, that is, there are a lot of fakes coming onto the market because numismatics is exploding as current US coinage and paper money become worthless, people flee US currency for hard assets and coins are easy to cache and more difficult to counterfeit than metal bars/ingots).</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t us Google, but I found a double-header  &mdash;  a picture of a beautiful coin that features Cleopatra on one side and Antony on the other.</p>

Western Civ has Got to Go!</p>
<p>The communist agitators behind the chanters WON; they have control of academia (and media and government).</p>
<p>Western &#8216;Civ&rsquo; is portrayed in K-university texts as one of White hegemony, White colonization, White genocide of gaia-loving natives in North America and White brutalization and enslavement of the advanced civilizations of Africa.</p>
<p>Modern textbooks are written by statist/socialist revisionists such as howard zinn, presenting  an &#8216;enlightened&rsquo; view of history  &mdash;  one which promotes a PC/statist side of every historical incident. </p>
<p>Children are taught that the solution to all problems is government.  And this mindset is very hard to break once its entrenched.</p>

		<p>Egypt may be on the continent of Africa, but for sub-Saharan Africans to claim this as their achievement is as ridiculous as me searching for my Welsh roots among the ruins of the Acropolis in Greece, or the ruins of ancient southern Italy. Same continent, greatly different histories. </p>

<p>There are none, so they have been trying to appropriate other&rsquo;s history and insert themselves.  It is true that there was a Nubian ruler for 60 years during a period of disarry between Egyptian dynasties, but that was long before Cleopatra&rsquo;s time, and had no lasting effect.  Apparently, the discovery of this bit of history by blacks has allowed them to project further and completely fraudulent claims of Afrocentric historic revisionism.</p>
<p>As for the Jolie film, it will be a flop.  Critics will inevitably compare it to the 1962 Burton/Taylor version, because it is a classic and THE standard.  The Burton/Taylor version will never be topped for its magnificence, and there will never be a better Cleopatra than Taylor was, however anyone feels about her politics now.  Anyone who hasn&rsquo;t seen that version ought to rent it and give themselves a treat.  <br>

		<p>&#8220;Regarding the anonymous poster who waxed so enthusiatic about Lindsey Marshall as Cleopatra, I checked her out on that link. I know nothing about her skills as an actress, so I can&rsquo;t comment. She may be a splendid actress. But, in the photos, the character she portrays is FAR TOO DUSKY to be a person of pure Macedonian descent (which Cleopatra was)  &mdash;  nor any kind of European, for that matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>She isn&rsquo;t all that dusky. On the show, she had more of an olive complexion, I guess you&rsquo;d call it. And those matted braids you&rsquo;re talking about were a ceremonial wig. Her real hair was clipped short (at least in the series). In any case, a white Nordic Cleopatra would be just as out of place as a black Cleopatra.</p>
<p>The storyline in Rome wasn&rsquo;t all that accurate as far as the actual history went, granted, but it was closer than anything I&rsquo;ve seen before and it was extremely accurate when it came to the details of the setting. It would be impossible to dramatize the real history in a series of one-hour TV shows because the real thing was way too complex and it would cost a fortune to produce. As it was, Rome was too expensive to last more than two seasons.</p>
<p>I stand by Lindsey Marshall. She looks the part, if you ask me, and she would be a million times better than Angelina Jolie or anyone else I can think of. Marshall isn&rsquo;t a glamor type either. The real Cleopatra was supposed to have been fairly plain. She owed her success to her intelligence, from what I&rsquo;ve read. </p>

		<p>You don&rsquo;t have to have a Ph.D. in Egyptology or Classics to do a little research and find out that Cleopatra was not black. But, of course, I understand there have been so few truly important blacks in history that blacks feel the need to claim non-blacks as black and to elevate relatively unimportant blacks into positions of great importance. Don&rsquo;t blacks realize that this sort of thing merely makes them look foolish to well-educated people?</p>

<p>I myself made copies of a calendar that I found hanging on the wall of a black insurance agency, when I went there to work on their copiers (I used to be an electronics technician).</p>
<p>This calendar portray Beethoven (BEETHOVEN!), Pushkin (PUSHKIN!) and others as black! Beyond absurd!</p>
<p>I have even heard the usual crowd on the radio claiming that the Greeks (Plato and Aristotle) were black.</p>
<p>When my wife and I went to the 1982 World&rsquo;s Fair in Knoxville, TN, there was a black exhibit, sponsored by some beer company. They had posters in front portraying Cleopatra (a Greek) and Hannibal (a Semite) as thick-lipped, very dark blacks.</p>
<p>No one was going in to see the film about the supposed &#8220;awesome&#8221; historical deeds of supposed black personages. We, ourselves, did not, even though the very polite and gracious black attendant practically implored us. </p>

		<p>The ancient Egyptians were not black, much as blacks today would dearly love to believe so. Cleopatra was certainly not black. Blacks were all but unknown in the Roman empire. They were such an oddity that when captured as slaves they would be paired against each other in the colosseum. The original population of north Africa - which should really not be thought of as north Africa, but rather the south Mediterranean - was Berber, Phoenicians, Greeks, who established many colonies there, the Egyptians and others from the Levant. Blacks did not inhabit this coastal strip of the Mediterranean littoral or the Nile delta region. Even the Arabization of the Berbers in the Maghreb did not occur until the eighth and ninth centuries. </p>

		<p>HISTORIANS CLAIM CLEOPATRA WAS &lsquo;SHORT, FAT &amp; HOMELY&rsquo;</p>
<p>*********************</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s necessary to understand that in an age long before industrialization  (when manufactured goods became abundant) when ordinary people wore rough homespun clothes, lived in relative poverty and scarcity (by modern standards) and no one but royalty had access to silks, satins, jewels, the &#8220;beauty&#8221; of a royal personage was awesome.  It referred to the entire, overall appearance they conveyed - not the physical beauty of the individual. Thus, Cleopatra was &#8220;beautiful&#8221; and stunning in the eyes of the commoner. Indeed, royalty was theater designed to awe the masses. Their clothing, jewelry, entourage were intended to impress.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that in Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign (almost two thousand years after Cleopatra) Elizabeth was lavishly praised by her courtiers and ambassadors for her resplendent &#8220;beauty&#8221;   &mdash;   even after she had become a withered, aged, bald, toothless hag.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that she wasn&rsquo;t praised for her beauty - when she was much younger and prettier - UNTIL she became queen. Then, she was praised as the most beautiful woman in the realm!  What people were looking at was the total package, not the individual inside the package.</p>

<p>Enough likenesses of the ancient Greeks survive on frescos and decorative urns to show us the typical Greek was someone with dark, wavy/curly hair and dark eyes (with light to olive complexions).  That there were ancient Greeks with lighter complexions is without a doubt, but apparently then, as now, they were never very numerous.</p>

<p>From Carleton S. Coon&rsquo;s &#8220;The Races of Europe&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Greeks of the great period of Athenian civilization were thus the product of much mixture from diverse ethnic sources, as the study of the origin of the Greek language also reveals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also pertinent:</p>
<p>&#8220;As will be shown later (Chapter XI, section 14), the modern inhabitants of Greece itself differ surprisingly little from their classical predecessors.&#8221;</p>
<p>That would probably explain why the ancient Greeks wrote at length of anyone who did display blonde or red hair and blue eyes.  Such an exotic-looking person must have seemed fascinating to them.</p>

<p>Most of those &#8216;accounts&rsquo; were written/rewritten by Northern Europeans who would undoubtedly love in any way possible to claim the great Macedonian world-conqueror for themselves.  Alexander is hardly unique in this regard.  Example: look at all the depictions of a Northern European-looking Jesus of Nazareth that so many people today of European descent take for granted.   </p>

<p>Even the Northern Italian physiologist Angelo Mosso criticized this habit of &#8220;Nordicizing&#8221; Southern Europeans in his book &#8220;The Dawn of Mediterreanan Civilization.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally, the oldest known depiction of Alexander of Macedon (in color) is the famous &#8220;Alexander Mosaic&#8221; found in Pompeii.  It was created around 100 BC.  The Romans admitted it was a copy of a much older Greek work that was done around the time of Alexander.  It depicts a battle between Alexander&rsquo;s armies and the armies of Darius III of Persia.  Modern historians say it is the most accurate depiction known of a battle in the ancient world.</p>
<p>The profile of Alexander in the mosaic is remarkably similar to that found on coins struck around the time of Alexander&rsquo;s reign.  As such, most modern historians are inclined to believe this is what Alexander looked like in life.  Does this man look like a blue-eyed blonde to you?</p>

Most of the prints were by a single black &#8216;artist&rsquo;, and depicted scenes from Ancient Black &#8216;History&rsquo;.

		<p>This subject has been investigated in great detail in the compendious biography of Cleopatra   by the historian Michael Grant.  Here is (some of)  what he says:<br>
 <br>
Cleopatra VII was born into a world controlled by the Romans.  But the inhabitants of its eastern (and richer) half were mainly Greeks.  At the time of her birth, in 70 BC,  Egypt had been a united nation for over three thousand years; and the Macedonian, Greek-speaking dynasty of the Ptolemies had been ruling the country for three hundred.</p>
<p>Inheriting the trade of Phoenician Tyre (which Alexander had destroyed), Alexandria eclipsed Carthage after its defeat by Rome. From then onwards, until overtaken by Rome itself, Alexandria was the greatest city and most famous port in the  entire Mediterranean world. The vast city rapidly became the centre of culture and fashion for the whole Greco-Roman world.  It was an extension of Greece, rather than part of Egypt.    </p>
<p>Cleopatra was a Greek more than anything else. Though Queen of Egypt, she possessed not a drop of Egyptian blood. As last of the dynasty of the Ptolemies, she was wholly Greek in upbringing and to a very considerable extent of Greek race. Cleopatra was the product of nine generations of incestuous marriages, designed to keep the blood line  pure.</p>
<p>Racial investigation suggests that she may have had a fairly dark complexion, at least not blonde hair, as was ascribed to her in a Stratford production of Shakespeare&rsquo;s Antony and Cleopatra. Her remote Macedonian forebears must have been of various complexions, since the Macedonians were of very mixed blood. Not all of them were fair-haired   &mdash;   although her ancestor Ptolemy II  Philadelphus was a blond.  Her great-great-grandfather (Ptolemy V) married into the house of the Seleucids and his wife was partially of Persian and other Iranian blood.  No Ptolemy, so far as we know, ever had an Egyptian wife.  Thus, when Robert Greene in  1589 wrote of Cleopatra VII as &#8220;black Egyptian&#8221; this was wrong, for she possessed not a single drop of Egyptian blood,  nor the blackness attributed to her in modern African Schoolbooks.</p>
<p>Cleopatra ruled over one of the most rigidly centralized bureaucratic governments the world has ever seen.  The kings regarded Egypt primarily as a source of income and the whole administration was directed to this end.    In theory, the Ptolemies owned  the entire soil as their own personal property.   Almost every article in daily use was manufactured in royal factories or under royal licenses.  Banking was another state monopoly, and was efficiently centralized in the hands of the government. As everywhere in the ancient world, interest rates were high   &mdash;   officially at 24 percent per annum   &mdash;   which kept labour cheap and money dear.   The entire national economy was deliberately isolated from the rest of the Hellenistic world, so that nothing should interfere with the completeness of royal control. </p>
<p>Cleopatra was a Greek queen.  She would certainly have described herself as a Greek. Her language was Greek,  and so was her whole education and culture.   Her ruling class, who were  allowed to share some of the monarch&rsquo;s riches, were also persons of Greek culture, descended from Greek and Macedonian conquerors.  They enjoyed a superior status and special privileges, including law courts of their own and exemption from the more degrading forms of punishment.  Mixed marriages were illegal.  The Egyptian peasants, however,  lived   barely above subsistence level and were wholly excluded from power. </p>

		<p>The problem is, Bantus have Cleopatra, queen of Egypt, confused with Cleopatra Jones, a Bantu detective, in one of those blaxploitation movies of the 1970&rsquo;s. </p>

<p>I tend to agree with your information.  I may be wrong, but do I sense an implication that because whites have &#8220;Nordicized&rdquo; features, it&rsquo;s not any different from other groups doing it?  Just curious.</p>

		<p>&#8220;In any case, a white Nordic Cleopatra would be just as out of place as a black Cleopatra.&#8221;</p>
<p>True, Cleopatra likely had olive skin and dark hair and was White like many of today&rsquo;s modern day White Italians, Greeks etc. It&rsquo;s unlikely that she was nordic looking even though there are some blonde Greeks with blue eyes. Jennifer Anniston is of Greek heritage.</p>
