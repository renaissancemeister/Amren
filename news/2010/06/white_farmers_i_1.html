			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Leah Hyslop, London Telegraph, June 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ian Ferguson&rsquo;s conservation farm, seized in April, is now littered with the remains of his slaughtered animals.</p>
<p>On May 25, Geoff Carbutt and his wife Shirley were evicted from their farm in Inyathi at gunpoint. Mr Carbutt was then arrested at his farm for occupying state land without a permit.</p>
<p>On the same day, farmer Ed Grenfell Dexter was arrested in Bulawayo, whilst a few days later on May 28, James Taylor and his son Matthew were arrested on their farm and taken to police cells in Nyamandhlovu .</p>
<p>But according to the SACFA, most of the affected farmers had official permits protecting their land from seizure.</p>
<p>Chris Jarrett, Chairman of the SACFA, commented: &#8220;For a while, things were quiet, but all of a sudden there has been a real burst of activity against white landowners.</p>
<p>&#8220;As far as we&rsquo;re concerned, all these seizures have been completely illegal. Most of the remaining white farmers exist on tiny portions of their original land, and have every right to stay there. The land acquisition notice for James Taylor&rsquo;s estate was withdrawn several years ago. The Carbutts have already given up most of their land for resettlement, and had a High Court order saying they could stay on the remaining section. Ed Grenfell Dexter doesn&rsquo;t even live on his farm any more and was lured out to be arrested.</p>
<p>&#8220;People think that there may be a period of quiet now until the World Cup is over, but we can&rsquo;t be sure. It&rsquo;s an unsettling time for farmers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Land reform in Zimbabwe began in 1979, when the Lancaster House Agreement between Britain and Zimbabwe pledged to begin a fairer distribution of land between the white minority who ruled Zimbabwe from 1890 to 1979 and the landless black population. At this stage, land acquisition could only occur on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p>By March 2000, however, little land had been redistributed and frustrated groups of government supporters began seizing white-owned commercial farms.</p>
<p>Since the seizures began, agricultural production in Zimbabwe has fallen dramatically.</p>
<p>Mr Jarrett said there had even been occasions when local people gathered in support of persecuted white farmers: &#8220;I think it would be true to say that it is widely accepted in Zimbabwe now, as in the rest of the world, that our economical and financial problems are due to the seizure of these farms. It was the white farmers who often provided the local community with support  &mdash;  providing work, or sending their men to fix things like piping problems in the village.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the police tried to take Gary Godfrey&rsquo;s farm in Nyamandhlovu a few weeks ago, his workers and the local veterans went to see the superintendent and insisted it stopped. Most of the seizures have been taking place in Nyamandhalovu and Inyathi, districts which are traditionally very independent. People there are very tired of being dictated to by the police.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ian Ferguson, a farmer in Beitbridge whose land was seized in April, said that the situation was become increasingly difficult for white land owners to bear: &#8220;I spent twenty five years setting up a wildlife conservation farm in a semi desert area which the government had officially declared no interest in. All of a sudden, it was seized, and now there is nothing left.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the past month, machinery has been ripped apart, solar panels stolen and nearly all my animals shot. 80 per cent of the impalas are dead, and the attackers have skinned over 100 zebra for their hides. In just a few weeks, they have inflicted a level of devastation which I would have thought would take three or four months.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two thirds of my family have left Zimbabwe now, and I think it&rsquo;s probably the best thing for them. This is nothing more than ethic cleansing  &mdash;  pure and simple.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr Steven Chan, a professor of international relations at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, said that the farm seizures were &#8220;likely to be related to an eventual election, next year or further in the future, when Zanu-PF might lose its command over Zimbabwe. They become a hedging of bets, seizing assets while it is still possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are now fewer than than 400 white farmers in Zimbabwe. In 2000, this was number was around 4500.<br>

		<p>Blacks destroy what they cannot hold onto or identify with as their own.  Including the means, nominally, to give their country -some- GDP on which to attach foreign aid loans.  Big surprise.  We have seen this instinctive razed earth behavior everywhere, from South Africa to New Orleans to LA and Watts.</p>
<p>Bleep where you Sleep syndrome.</p>
<p>And the notion that this is going to &#8216;change&rsquo; soon is ridiculous, ZANU-PF has been in control of Zimbabwe since 1980 when the country was &#8216;liberated&rsquo; and maintains a pseudo-communist/socialist elitist power structure through terror and influence peddling, largely at the expense of white farmers who lose property rights so the centrist black government can hand out favors.  That&rsquo;s all stopped now because there is frankly very little left to steal and give away.</p>
<p>Political action won&rsquo;t change this either, the last opposition candidate for President in Zimbabwe (in 2008) won the vote, got into a runoff condition over sufficient majority disclaimer from the ruling president, Robert Mugabe, and won that one too.</p>
<p>A third &#8216;recount&rsquo; happened without international arbitration or observers and suddenly Morgan Tsvangirai, of the MDC-T, fled the country.  Claiming it was too violent to accept change, and leaving Mr. Mugabe as the single, voteable, candidate again.</p>
<p>Of course it was &#8216;racist&rsquo; when whites pull this kind of only-for-us elitist political sabotage and it&rsquo;s always on the basis of their being so unfair to the local blacks who have nothing (but food, running water and general security).</p>
<p>When blacks do it to each other, it&rsquo;s not commented on at all because the news would be that they cannot sustain what they win -or- steal.</p>
<p>And so the former Rhodesia turns into a land of starving fools because nobody in the new government can keep the scaled infrastructure necessary for even sufficiency agriculture in the hands of those who know how to run it.</p>
<p>Result?  Huge spikes in crime as what little agro wealth existed disappears like water into the baked dirt, rumours of regional genocide to lower the levels of competition for food and the flight of Zimbabwean blacks to whomever will have them (even across lion infested game preserves) elsewhere. </p>
<p>&#8220;Whites all gone, no food, you give job.&#8221;</p>
<p>What is happening in Zimbabwe and South Africa is what -will- happen here if whites run out of places to make flight to and, realizing the great experiment in rule by mediocrity has failed (via Affirmative Action and the destruction of our economy by a pluralist democracy of class as much as race guilt) we try instead to partition.</p>
<p>The only credible jobs and wealth will be concentrated in isolated island populations surrounded by masses of poor ethnic (hispanic here) cultures whom whites -do not- want to intermix with.</p>
<p>And yet if they don&rsquo;t share their remaining wealth, it will be taken from them.</p>
<p>In a war on a scale we cannot imagine.</p>
<p>While the ethnically homogenous Chinese look on in wonderment.  </p>
<p>And then start to laugh.</p>

<p>The Chinese seem to be making the same mistake.</p>
<p>There is a major Southern city there where the African population is large and growing and causing problems.</p>

How right you are.  This coming collapse of America was described in perfect detail in the 1992 book, &#8220;Civil War II, The Coming Breakup of America&#8221;.  It will scare the pants off of you.  In this brilliant work he states that the war will begin on May 5, 2020 in LA and quickly spread continent-wide.  He believes that we will split into a black south, an hispanic southwest and the rest white.  Getting there will not be pretty, millions could perish.</p>

		<p>They are nothing but useless racist whites that abused the noble africans for centuries. Just take what they have and kill them all, after all nobody will fight for whites and we can get away with  Why wont some animal rights group fight for the wildlife they kill. Imagine if it was whites killing the impalas, would be all over the news.  Is it simple political correctness to just let the whites and the endangered species be exterminated.      Rhodesia was once called the breadbasket of africa but now cant feed itself without the white farmers. But it doesnt matter as the rest of the world will just send food for these noble oppressed blacks.  We should let them starve until they see that the white farmers are exactly what they need to feed them.  But of course that will never happen. Besides all the foolish spending in the USA, I guess our tax dollars can support these poor africans who could eat on thier own if they did not kill the golden goose. KF   </p>

		<p>Again - - as I have commented before, it surprises me that THERE ARE ANY WHITEY LEFT IN RHODESIA!! Surely by NOW or even a long time ago they realized what peril they are in. Once everything has been taken, there is only your life left to take. That will be taken too. </p>
<p>Even if Robert is gone, things ARE NOT going to change.</p>

Never forget that non-whites make war with sticks and rocks (if we don&rsquo;t give them other weapons&hellip;.and maintain them for them), while whites make war with nuclear bombs.</p>
<p>Also, understand that an army is only as effective as its support structure.  An army of 50,000 with only food enough for 100 and gasoline enough for 10 vehicles is an army of 100 with 10 vehicles.</p>
<p>If they bring war to us, they will quickly discover that they are completely and totally dependent on us&hellip;..not in the long term, but in terms of where their next meal is coming from.</p>
