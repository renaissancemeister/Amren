			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Simon Walters, Daily Mail (London), June 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Labour leadership contender Diane Abbott was seething after being branded a &#8216;racist&rsquo; and an expenses cheat by political pundit Andrew Neil.</p>
<p>Left-winger Ms Abbott was savaged by Mr Neil on his late-night BBC show This Week over her decision to send her son James to the £12,700-a-year City of London School.</p>
<p>Ms Abbott, who earned £36,000 a year as a regular guest on the show alongside Michael Portillo until stepping down to fight for the Labour leadership, had defended her stance, saying: &#8216;West Indian mums will go to the wall for their children.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Neil hit back by demanding: &#8216;So black mums love their kids more than white mums, do they?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Furious Ms Abbott said: &#8216;I have said everything I am going to say about where I send my son to school.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Neil persisted: &#8216;Supposing Michael said white mums will go to the wall for their children. Why did you say that? Isn&rsquo;t it a racist remark?</p>
<p>&#8216;If West Indian mums are as wonderful as you say, why are there so many dysfunctional West Indian families in this country? And why do so many young West Indian men end up in a life of crime and gangs?</p>
<p>&#8216;You didn&rsquo;t want your son to go to a school full of kids who have been brought up by West Indian mums.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As Ms Abbott repeatedly refused to reply, Mr Neil asked: &#8216;Would you like to make it clear that West Indian mums are no better than white mums or Asian mums?&rsquo;</p>
<p>When Ms Abbott, squirming in her seat, replied, &#8216;I have nothing to say,&rsquo; Mr Neil taunted her:</p>
<p>&#8216;You don&rsquo;t want to do that  &mdash;  you still think West Indian mums are the best?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The clash came after Ms Abbott said last week: &#8216;I knew what could happen if my son went to the wrong school and got in with the wrong crowd. They are subjected to peer pressure and when that happens it&rsquo;s very hard for a mother to save her son. Once a black boy is lost to the world of gangs it&rsquo;s very hard to get them back.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Mr Neil also confronted her over the £142,000 she claimed last year in Commons expenses.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;We _discovered you claimed £1,100 on taxis, including an individual claim for £192. Is that acceptable for an inner London MP?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ms Abbott stumbled: &#8216;The £192 _figure is, I think, a dozen taxi bills.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Neil replied: &#8216;You put in one claim, you didn&rsquo;t designate each one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ms Abbott: &#8216;No, no, I added it up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Neil: &#8216;Do you think the taxpayer should be paying over £1,000 for _running around London in a taxi?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ms Abbott: &#8216;I don&rsquo;t run around London in taxis. I take a couple of taxis a week to get home late at night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Neil: &#8216;Why don&rsquo;t you dip into your own pocket? You&rsquo;re well paid.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is not the first time the pair have fallen out. The MP was left angry last October when Mr Neil jokingly referred to her and Mr Portillo as &#8216;our very own chocolate HobNob and custard cream&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Well, I suppose in terms of sheer quantity black women make &#8220;better&#8221; mums.  And in truth, they have to be really good to raise their broods without fathers, without even being able to identify in many cases who the fathers were.</p>
<p>These are highly responsible, disciplined, and resourceful people.</p>
<p>They should be encouraged in their prolific ways.</p>

<p>But want the taxpayer to pay for it.</p>
<p>I hope she wins.  Labour will never win another election.  Honestly, I wish she could clone herself twice, and the two clones could lead the Tories and the Liberal Democrats.  That&rsquo;ll finally be what the BNP needs.</p>

<p>Mr. Neil you did a great job.<br>
It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you are left or right. Now you are not biased. You were able to call a colored woman a racist. You are race-blind, a thing that many lefties call themselves but not one of them really is. They are just anti-white, you are race-blind.</p>

		<p>This type of candid exchange should have happened 40 years ago when decisions were being made.</p>
<p>Now it is just sqabbling after the accident.</p>
<p>Sadly, I think England has fallen, and I don&rsquo;t know if it can ever regain the great culture it once had.  The United States is on the same path.</p>

		<p>This woman is one very arrogant female and had a massively misplaced sense of self-importance and superiority - traits that are far far more associated with the Black psychic than White.   </p>
<p>She&rsquo;s always trying to mimic an upper-class White peoples&rsquo; accent which comes across as very contrived and forced.  It also lends an insight into her personality and character exposing her as a very shallow and conceited article, toboot. </p>
<p>This is not the first time she has made offensive statements about White peoples.  She is not qualified to be leader of any political party let alone, a potential Prime Minister. </p>
<p>I believe non-Whites should be barred from holding high-profile positions of any kind in any ancestral White homeland.  We do not see White people hold any in non-White countries and this should be one of our chief reasons for not permitting it in any of our own. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve watched the video and he was soft on her. It seems much more aggressive here in text than it plays out on film.</p>
<p>If that were Nick Griffin and he had said the same about white moms, Neil would of morphed into a rabid attack dog and not given up until the statement was either retracted or restated.</p>

		<p>Actually, this is typical left wing hypocrites. Left-wingers of any race run far away from bad non-White neighborhoods and wouldn&rsquo;t dare live or send their kids to one of their schools. Yet, they support polices that turn the country into a &#8220;bad neighborhood&#8221; and expect others to go to such schools and accuse them or racsim if they don&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>Well, I&rsquo;m glad that the stifling Political Correctness that recently plagued Britain seems to have been toned down a bit. Can you imagine a white person saying something like taht just a yera or two ago? It would have gotten them in very hot water, I bet.</p>

<p>Its funny how when these blacks gain office or some other position of power the first think they do is holler about how &#8216;precious&rsquo; blacks are compared to everyone else.</p>
<p>Blacks are the True Racists. And we&rsquo;re all, here in the States, going to find out at midterm election.</p>

		<p>I was shocked watching this at how Andrew Neil went for her. He was attacking someone in a priviliged racial class that a white man like him is simply not allowed to attack. In today&rsquo;s poltical climate, you have to say he was pretty brave. <br>
Diane Abbott has &#8216;form&rsquo; with these kind of comments. A few years back she said that she did not want blonde-haired blue-eyed Finnish nurses working in her local (heavily vibrant) hospital, as they would not understand the needs of black patients.<br>
I really hope she wins the leadership election, for the same reason I wanted Obama to win in America. The public need to hear more of what black people really think.<br>

		<p>Wow, I&rsquo;d never heard of Andrew Neil before and I hope I hear more from him.  The questions were valid and completely stumped his opponent, though she did mask her anger well.  I wish more TV presenters had the courage to call the protected classes out on their racism.</p>

<p>I reckon you&rsquo;re forgetting the magnitude of the non-White invasion of the UK as well as its indefinite nature.</p>
<p>The way things are going, the native White vote will be swept away with the tide in a mere handful of years never mind a couple of decades.  By the time the White sheeple cotton on to the dire situation they themselves and their progeny are indeed in, not even the BNP, if it were to successfully attain power by then which it would be prevented from administering anyway, would be able to save the day.</p>
<p>Too little, too late is the reason why.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s going to take something far more concrete than the rigged ballot box of a now Third World UK Banana Republic.</p>
