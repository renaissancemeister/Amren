			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>MSNBC, June 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Kyrgyz mobs burned Uzbek villages, slaughtered their residents and stormed police stations seeking to loot more weapons Sunday as ethnic rioting engulfed new areas in southern Kyrgyzstan.</p>
<p>The interim government in the impoverished Central Asian nation ordered troops to shoot rioters dead but even that has failed to stop the spiraling violence that has left more than 100 people dead and about 1,250 wounded since Thursday night.</p>
<p>Doctors and rights activists say that official toll is far too low because wounded minority Uzbeks are too afraid of being attacked again to go to hospitals.</p>
<p>The riots are the worst violence since former President Kurmanbek Bakiyev was ousted in a bloody uprising in April and fled the country. The Uzbeks have backed the interim government, while many Kyrgyz in the south support the toppled president.</p>
<p>Thousands of Uzbeks have fled in panic to the nearby border with Uzbekistan after their homes were torched by roving mobs of Kyrgyz men. Some Uzbek women and children were gunned down as they tried to escape, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Fires set by rioters have destroyed most of Osh, the country&rsquo;s second-largest city, and looters have stolen most of its food. Triumphant crowds of Kyrgyz men took control of most of Osh on Sunday while the few Uzbeks still in the city of 250,000 barricaded themselves in their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Fires continued to rage across Osh and occasional shots were heard. Police were nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p><b>Police, military on the defensive</b></p>
<p>The rampages spread quickly Sunday to Jalal-Abad, another major southern city, and its neighboring villages, as mobs methodically set Uzbek houses, stores and cafes on fire. The rioters seized an armored vehicle and automatic weapons at a local military unit and attacked police stations around the region trying to get more firearms.</p>
<p>Police and the military appeared to be on the defensive across the south, avoiding clashes with mobs. Flights to both Osh and Jalal-Abad were canceled.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Jalal-Abad on Sunday, thousands of Kyrgyz men brandishing sticks, metals bars and hunting rifles gathered at the city&rsquo;s race track and marched to burn Uzbek property while frightened police stayed away. Uzbeks felled trees on the city&rsquo;s main thoroughfare, trying to block their advance. Jalal-Abad is 45 miles (70 kilometers) from Osh.</p>
<p>Kyrgyz mobs tried to storm the city&rsquo;s hospital, but Uzbeks drove them off after a fierce gunbattle that raged for hours, witnesses said. Mobs also surrounded a local prison, trying to free its inmates and attempted repeatedly to capture the Jalal-Abad police headquarters, but were repelled.</p>
<p>Kyrgyz mobs killed about 30 Uzbeks Sunday in the village of Suzak in the Jalal-Abad region, Talaaibek Myrzabayev, the chief military conscription officer in Bishkek, told The Associated Press. Another Uzbek village, Dostuk, was burned by Kyrgyz assailants, but it was not known how many people were killed there, he said.</p>
<p>Ethnic Uzbeks ambushed about 100 Kyrgyz men Sunday on a road near Jalal-Abad and took them hostage, he said. Vehicles on the main highway near Jalal-Abad repeatedly came under fire from unidentified gunmen.</p>
<p>In the nearby village of Bazar-Kurgan, a mob of 400 Uzbeks overturned cars and killed a police captain, local political activist Asyl Tekebayev said. Residents said armed Kyrgyz men were flooding into the village to retaliate.</p>
<p>The fertile Ferghana Valley where Osh and Jalal-Abad are located once belonged to a single feudal lord, but it was split by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin among Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The Stalinist borders rekindled old rivalries and fomented ethnic tensions.</p>
<p>Both ethnic groups are predominantly Sunni Muslim. Uzbeks are generally better off economically, but they have few representatives in power and have pushed for broader political and cultural rights.</p>

		<p>The Uzbeks (Oʻzbek, pl. Oʻzbeklar) are a Turkic people in Central Asia.</p>
<p>The Kyrgyz (also spelled Kirgiz, Kirghiz) are a Turkic ethnic group found primarily in Kyrgyzstan.</p>
<p>These two peoples seem to have a slight difference and yet they fight bitterly. Just think how things will go with the vast differences between those of European descent, and our growing population of outlanders! </p>

		<p>Forgive me if you`ve seen this before, but the end of multi-culturalism for me personally came at an intersection in Vegas. I hailed a cab and asked the cabbie to drive me and my handi-capped girlfriend to downtown via the strip instead of the cross town freeway. So she could see some neon eye-candy.<br>
 The man brusquely imformed me that it was a hassle but he would do it under one ironclad condition. That we understand, accept and verbally acknowledge our driver was &#8220;a proud Albanian, and not another smelly  stupid  Turk&hellip;&#8221;  I agreed but he lost my favor somewhat when he didn`t have a clue what &#8220;Step on it!&#8221; meant.</p>

		<p>The political elite and the so-called &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; in almost all white countries in the West praise multiculturalism as an enrichment, declaring it as the epitome of the modern society. They reject ethnic homogeneity and label it as racist and outdated. The slaughter of Uzbeks in Kyrgyzstan proves once more that cultural diversity at a high degree of polarization only increases the likelihood of ethnic conflicts, but never decreases - there is no logic behind the wishful thinking that diversity is a strength when it comes to the stability of the society. Interethnic conflicts start when individuals representing various ethnicities commit violent crimes on each other, after which the individuals interpret the attack not as on the individual person, but on the whole ethnic group. Retaliation attacks follow, and innocent people become victims. The best security against ethnic civil war is therefore homogeneity (I&rsquo;m explicitly emphasizing on ETHNIC civil war - not political, these can happen even in a homogeneous society). Japan, Korea and Poland among other countries have been spared incidents like in Kyrgysztan because their societies preserved ethnic homogeneity - unlike the Balkan states.</p>

		<p>Mobs burn villages, slaughter aliens, guns, violence, death and destruction.  This sounds like an Arnie movie&hellip; But given that the entire Western world is heading in this direction, it gives new meaning the phrase, &#8220;Coming to a -country- near you&hellip;&#8221;.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The fertile Ferghana Valley&#8221;</p>
<p>Everyone in the region covets the Ferghana Valley. For over 2,000 years this is an oasis in a high desert land. Even the Chinese sent expeditions to the place because of the repute.</p>
<p>&#8220;These two peoples seem to have a slight difference and yet they fight bitterly. Just think how things will go with the vast differences between those of European descent, and our growing population of outlanders!&#8221;</p>
<p>Exactly!! An American or any other outsider would say these folks are the same. BUT THEY CAN DISTINGUISH ONE ANOTHER AND HATE ONE ANOTHER AND KILL ONE ANOTHER.</p>
<p>Mixing different folks in the same place is a recipe for disaster. Always has been, always will be. Just something about human nature. The reason the world order, built on the nation-state system, exists, is to prevent unneeded mixing and trouble. Each group has its own country and lives apart and conducts their own affairs. Such is the theory.</p>

		<p>to say that there is no difference between Uzbeks and Kyrgyz because both are Turkish groups is a big stretch. Note the facts that Uzbeks are traditional agriculturalists, Kyrgyz are traditional nomads and that right now Uzbeks are the market dominant minority over there.</p>
<p>Wikipedia article on Kyrgyzstan sounds to me like that nation got Tibet type treatment from the more civilized Uzbeks and the Russian overlords under the Soviets.</p>

		<p>Borat would approve.</p>
<p>Kidding aside, I wonder what the difference is between the two. Both speak Turkic languages, both are Muslim, and both are Mongoloid. I guess the Uzbeks are somewhat more Persian-influenced and slightly more Caucasoid, but I don&rsquo;t understand anything beyond that.</p>

<p>Our dear leaders may have figured out how to do it&hellip; As long as you treat one group as slaves, and the other group as Royalty, things can work fine. Or in a truly mixed race nation (where the challenge is more difficult) treat only one of the different groups as abject servants, it can work.</p>
<p>As long as the expectations are clearly divided, it can work. </p>

Ah, yes.  And Europe will be flooded with them too.<br>
 <br>
But not to worry!  The Powers That Be, craving more diversity in places like Stockholm and Brussels, must be rubbing their hands and squealing with glee.   Just think of all those new refugees to be had,  all that multi-culturalism.  Oh, goody! How exciting.</p>

		<p>  I can&rsquo;t figure out what&rsquo;s going on here. I can&rsquo;t really see much difference in the two ethnic groups. Diversity doesn&rsquo;t appear to strengthen any state. Maybe, these Central Asian people were better off under Russian (not Soviet) rule.</p>

		<p>I hope you like Uzbek food  (barbequed sheep&rsquo;s heads?).<br>
&#8216;Cause we&rsquo;ll soon have an Uzbek restaurant in every neighborhood.</p>
<p>And I hope Uzbeks make good drivers (not camels, silly!).<br>
They&rsquo;ll soon be driving every other taxi in town. </p>
<p>The Somalis and Iraqis won&rsquo;t like that, but   &mdash;   oh well   &mdash;   gotta make room for the new gang on the block.</p>
<p>I presume they&rsquo;ll do some of the work &#8220;that Americans refuse to do&#8221;   &mdash;   until their anchor babies get on welfare.</p>

		<p>Isnt&rsquo; Krgyzstan or Uzbekistan one of the staging points and tactical bases for supplies going into AfG?</p>
<p>I seem to recall that we signed a long term agreement just a year or so ago to continue using these nations military infrastructure to based some of our tacair assets out of&hellip;</p>
<p>I would also like to know what the system of government (and precisely: the commander in chief) is that this unlawfulness is allowed to persist.</p>
<p>It makes one wonder what the doctrinal justification for &#8216;sit back and watch, they&rsquo;re only our own people&rsquo; is compared to say the BHD scenario where UN relief columns could not be protected against Aidid&rsquo;s troops.</p>
<p>If nothing else, the simplest way to hobble a civil insurrection is exactly that: lock down the roads (mines, caltrops, sticky foam, MMW heatguns) and tell everyone to go back where they came from.</p>
<p>If you stop it outright, it doesn&rsquo;t grow.  It&rsquo;s the &#8216;growth phase&rsquo; which is dangerous because people start to /hunt/ for food and trophies and as the numbers grow, so does the degree of violence.</p>
