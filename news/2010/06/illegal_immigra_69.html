<h1>Illegal Immigrants Crime Spree in WA</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dan Springer, Fox News, June 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One woman is dead and two others were raped recently and police say each crime was committed by a different illegal immigrant. One of the sexual assaults happened just hours before the Seattle city council passed an ordinance boycotting Arizona over its new immigration law.</p>
<p>Gregorio Luna Luna had a history of beating up his live-in girlfriend Griselda Ocampo Meza. He was also in the U.S. illegally. On May 1, Luna Luna was deported to Mexico. Three weeks later Meza was murdered in her apartment in a violent knife attack.</p>
<p>Franklin County prosecutors say Luna Luna slipped past the border again and killed Meza in front of their five year old son.  He&rsquo;s in the county jail awaiting trial.</p>
<p>A suspected rapist in Edmonds, Washington has been deported at least 4 times according to Snohomish County prosecutors. Jose Lopez Madrigal has been charged with raping a woman next to a dumpster behind a Safeway store. A witness to the attack alerted police and Madrigal was taken into custody.</p>
<p>An illegal immigrant just convicted of his possible 3rd strike in Whatcom county  &mdash;  a rape of a homeless woman  &mdash;  has been deported to Mexico five times.</p>
<p>Washington State ranks 11th in the nation in the number of illegal immigrants with an estimated 150,000. They make up 2% of the state&rsquo;s population, but account for 4.5% of those in Washington prisons. In Franklin county, 14% of the jail bookings are illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Currently, over half of the individuals on the Washington State Patrol&rsquo;s Most Wanted List are suspected illegal immigrants. 18 of the 26 on the list are Hispanic with no place of birth identified. Most are wanted for vehicular homicide and they have languished on the Most Wanted list for several years.</p>
<p>There are about 50,000 felony warrants currently issued in Washington State and according to a source in the U.S. Marshall&rsquo;s office between 30-40 percent are believed to be illegal immigrants.</p>

<p>This is why we will eventually win this war (and that is exactly what it is) of political ideologies and socioeconomics. We have both reality and truth on our side and it would also seem, a slowly awakening lumpen-bourgeoisie and toten-proletariat also adjusting to our ideas, just when our multicultural Obama &ldquo;utopia&rdquo; seems to be lost in its worst apoplexy of radically disinterested malevolence. Not even when Comrade Clinton &ldquo;felt our pain&rdquo; or El Presidente Bush demanded that &ldquo;family values&rdquo; do not stop at the Rio Grand, has the collapse of the federal diversity propaganda spearhead, seemed more apparent or desirable.  </p>
<p>You cannot have people raped and murdered by invaders forever, and expect it to be considered &ldquo;enriching.&rdquo; This is particularly true, when passing laws to aid and abet the rape and pillage of these invaders is coinciding with the facts of the matter.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all and may he also grant us a inexorable victory!</p>

<p>And this is just for one state alone. Imagine the nation-wide statistics. And these bad guys have multiple aliases and ID and &#8220;papers&#8221;, etc. Or they just move around so much they are like a mirage, here one day, gone the next. And everywhere a trail of destruction. That is a side of &#8220;immigration&#8221; that none of these &#8220;activists&#8221; like to talk about. And no wonder WHY!<br>

<p>As the economy continues to worsen these nest two years, more mestizos will turn to crime.  At some point, I&rsquo;m hoping a news incident occurs where bringing up these wanted posters with mestizos all over them will occur.</p>
<p>If the crazies keep pushing Arizona, maybe it is they who will start the ball rolling on identifying perps in defense of their claims of rising crime rates the reveal mestizo involvement.</p>
<p>18 states have introduced Arizona illegal alien laws just like Arizona.  It took a brave woman to show these effeminate male politicians how to act appropriately.</p>
<p>If JD Hayworth can defeat McCain it will be another BIG BIG plus for us, but it&rsquo;s going to be really tough now that McCain is pretending he&rsquo;s against the illegal hordes.<br>

		<p>You want to make money?<br>
Invest in right-wing news and white areas. Like #1 John said, whites can&rsquo;t be raped and killed forever and still diversity seen as enrichment.The people will wake up, and those who don&rsquo;t will be killed or raped. In the end it&rsquo;s everywhere like in South Africa: Every white, not matter is he right or left, will be against diversity.</p>

		<p>Alas, the world becomes increasingly insane each day. This has been the trend of the past 40 years and it has been accelerating over the past two decades.</p>
<p>As a White couple, my wife and I are very thankful that we chose to never have children. Yes, we missed the experience and the joy children bring to families, but our unborn children undoubtedly thank us for not subjecting them to this insane world.</p>
<p>I know that the decision to not procreate is often a strong point of contention among my fellow Whites, but I stand firmly and proudly behind our reasoning and final choice.</p>
<p>Yes, we realize that some Whites see us as disloyal to our race for not reproducing, but I must strongly disagree. </p>
<p>Our race is face immense challenges that do not seem to have a solution. One would be a fool not to see that. Somewhere between 30 percent and 50 percent of all Whites   &mdash;   our own race!   &mdash;   are egalitarians who are hell-bent on destroying their own race. They are the ones who voted for Barack Hussein Obama. They are the ones who cede our positions to Blacks and Browns every step of the way. Those are the facts! </p>
<p>Plus, the government and the wealthiest White corporate owners fully support the eradication of Whites. It is communicated and mandated in every action they take!  Those too are facts!</p>
<p>My God! Would any White person be allowed to hide his birth certificate and school records from the voting public and get away with it? Corporations and the government have been replacing highly qualified Whites with unqualified Blacks on the basis of skin color alone for over 30 years!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only a matter of time until miscegenation, White self-loathing, third-world immigration, and government-corporate policies eradicate the White population. A government-corporate partnership, by the way, is called Fascism. Obama&rsquo;s principles and policies are, by definition, Marxist. The USA is now a hybrid Fascist/Marxist country! Many of our fellow Whites voted for both and will vote for both again and again!</p>
<p>What else? The most damning problem we face is that the Muslims, Hispanics, and Africans are simply out-breeding and replacing us in North America, Europe, and Australia. The race is not even close! It is not in the nature of Whites to procreate like wild jackal and for good reason!</p>
<p>You know what is coming, my friends! Why would any sane White person sentence their children, born or unborn, to face what is coming?</p>
<p>My heart grieves for my nieces, nephews, and all White children. They were all betrayed by misguided elements of our own race!</p>
<p>May God help us all!<br>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t diversity &amp; multiculturalism wonderful? </p>
<p>This crime spree and huge taxpayer spending to accommodate the needs of Illegal aliens is the result of Americans not objecting strenuously decades ago to the liberal politicians, press and various intellectual elites telling us that we were suddenly a multicultural county as if we were ever asked &amp; agreed to it.  Doing nothing when liberal elites try to run things always costs big time in blood &amp; money.</p>

		<p>At some point in time, cannot the idea of the US federal government becoming civilly or even criminally liable for its dereliction of duties, be brought forth in the form of a law suit or charges from a state General Attorney?   It wound seem the federal government has become negligent in allowing such a volume of illegal aliens to enter the country without a sufficient defensive response.  As such is it not a prime time for such action?  If one of these women raped by an illegal were in my family, I would want to pursue such action.  There has to be lawyers out there contemplating a class action suit on behalf of victims across an entire state, or for that matter across the entire country.  Maybe such a suit or criminal charge is what is required to get the federal government to wake up and do the job the US constitution holds it responsible for doing.</p>

		<p>We need to erect the same kinds of databases that women now access in checking their dates.</p>
<p>Take pictures using those deer stalker, game trail, cameras.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here he was six months ago, crossing the border.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then again with cellphone cameras.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here he is on a most wanted poster.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here he is working in MacDonalds on Madison.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;These are his known names and aliases&#8221;</p>
<p>And provide the same kind of criminal background check that any woman would do for an employer.</p>
<p>Because _if the information is out there_ (and there are database systems which can biometrically match almost any face to any existing picture in the base, the border patrol uses them now), in the public domain, and a business hires this person.</p>
<p>The next thing to do is _boycott the business and all the suppliers who deal with it_.</p>
<p>You see?  We act like they do.  We get all &#8216;egalistic&rsquo; on their behinds.  We bypass the limits of law enforcement in refusing to do what it knows is right because it is _the law_.</p>
<p>And we base it on commercial interest so that the REAL purchasing power in this nation starts to assert itself.</p>
<p>Then we hold a referendum, nationally, to see how many people _really want_ illegal immigrants settling here.</p>
<p>We may lose.  But at least it would be out in the open.  The big question then being where do we move to once it becomes clear that the U.S. is no longer ours.</p>
<p>Or how do we move it up the political food chain when there is so obviously a glass ceiling against any kind of reform.</p>

		<p>Riverhound is certainly right. A class-action lawsuit from the victims of crimes committed by illegals against the federal government might be an idea. The US government has the largest military in the world, and has the resources to seal that border. They&rsquo;re definately neglecting their duties if they fail to do so.</p>

		<p>Mexican Indians embraced cannibalism and ritualized mass murder for eons until the comparatively recent arrival of the Spanish.</p>
<p>Mexican Indians and Mestizos of today share the same propensity for murder as their ancestors.  </p>
<p>If you look you can see it in the vacuous expression emanating from their reptilian-like eyes.  </p>
<p>These are not a people we want in our country and they must be driven out at all costs by every means available&hellip;  </p>

<p>This matter goes far beyond the &#8220;victims of crimes committed by illegals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every U.S. citizen who labors and pays taxes is FORCED to subsidize the presence of illegal aliens in the United States because the U.S. government fails to enforce the law.</p>
<p>Not only do they fail to enforce the law, they openly declare that they will not enforce the law!</p>
<p>What in God&rsquo;s name is wrong with the world?</p>
<p>The class action lawsuit against the U.S. government should be by any U.S. citizen taxpayer who wants to join.</p>
