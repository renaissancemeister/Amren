<h1>Congresswoman: White Supremacists Behind Arizona Immigration Law</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Whittier Daily News (Whittier, California), June 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The Arizona laws are not a mistake,&#8221; said [Rep. Linda] Sanchez, D-Lakewood, referring to Arizona&rsquo;s S.B. 1070, {snip}.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re not accidental or one person&rsquo;s crazy idea.&#8221; &#8220;There&rsquo;s a concerted effort behind promoting these kinds of laws on a state-by-state basis by people who have ties to white supremacy groups,&#8221; Sanchez said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s been documented. It&rsquo;s not mainstream politics. (Legislators) are being approached by folks, who are front organizations who are white supremacist hate groups. They propose the language of these bills and get people to carry these bills in the state legislatures,&#8221; she said.</p>

		<p>Morris Dees awaits your generous contribution, Miss Sanchez.  Liquidate all your assets and give it to the SPLC.  Now!  Quickly!  Hurry up and do it, before the secret white supremacist cabal, surely being led by an old Hitler hiding in the rain forests of South America, financed with stolen Jewish gold, eats you and every other tolerant progressive alive until only the bare bones are left.</p>

		<p>S.B. 1070 is more than an immigration tool, it is a repudiation.  &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; understand full well that they are now on the radar screen.  It is one thing to hide in a crowd and throw bricks and another to have a crowd facing you.  There are probably 200 million or more people in this country that approve of what Arizona did!  </p>

		<p>Yes..White Supremacists are behind the Arizona law and to be<br>
frank they are behind the United States of America. You will find<br>
no clearer statement of white supremacy than in the writings of<br>
Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt. As Teddy Roosevelt said..&#8221;It is one of most fortuitous events in human history that the temperate regions of North America have<br>
been reserved for the white man&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I remember when Linda Sanchez was on CSPAN she bragged about how her ancestors explored the coast of California in response to a  caller who said that she and her fellow Hispanics are basically trying to takeover the southwest. So from that I surmise that her ancestors were mostly/entirely Spainiards, not Indians; she can play the race card all she wants for her dusky constituents, but her white-bashing is just a little hypocrtical in light of this.</p>

		<p> This is a typical Leftist ploy: When something is happening that threatens your agenda, claim that the usual devils, &#8220;white supremacists,&#8221; are behind it all. Never mind that 70 percent of all Americans agree with Arizona&rsquo;s passage of the law; it doesn&rsquo;t fit the multi-culti gamebook, so it must be &#8220;racist&#8221; and &#8220;nativist.&#8221; I don&rsquo;t think liberalism has had a new idea in 100 years   &mdash;   or admitted it was wrong about any of them.</p>

		<p>Interesting theory. By this logic, however, some three-quarters of Americans(depending on which polls you utilize), including liberlas, blacks and other non-whites, are all &#8220;white supremacists!&#8221; A curious development to be sure. I think Rep. Sanchez may need to rethink this. </p>

<p>Wrong!  Tea party members, plus other fed up whites are against Arizona law.</p>
<p>Linda Chavez, La Raza and the Brown Beret want full amnesty for illegal aliens, because their purpose is to gain control of the entire Southwest US through a soft invasion of warm bodies.</p>
<p>If they are successful, they will petition the rest of the country for continual bailouts, because it will fail economically, just as their country of Mexico has failed.</p>
<p>Like blacks, Mexicans are blind to their own incompetence.  After getting in the driver&rsquo;s seat, they will soon discover that the vehicle isn&rsquo;t easy to drive, and things will deterorate just like Mexico.</p>
<p>They WILL NOT, however, admit to incompetence.  They will scream that they are the victims of white racist policies as the reasons for their unavoidable failures.</p>

		<p>Hispanic supremacists are behind the calls for amnesty and a &#8220;path to citizenship&#8221;, but they always get a pass.  It is not at all hard to find connections between MEChA and pro-amnesty politicians.  Starting with Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who was a member of MEChA and has never repudiated that organization.<br>

		<p>The complete opposite is true. Hispanics-La Raza(The Race)-along with their political and media representatives such as Linda Sanchez and the multimillionaire &#8220;journalist&#8221; Soledade O&rsquo;Brain are the racists. They publicly taunt the Native Born White American majority about how high fertility Hispanic foreigners will reduce them to an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America.</p>
<p>What Hispanics and their Liberal White supporters mean by racist is this:Only Hispanics and other post-1965 nonwhites can have a strong racial preference for their own kind. White Americans are not allowed to have one. Of course, as White Nationalist we don&rsquo;t give a hoot if Hispanics and other post-1965 nonwhites-such as the racist Latina Soledade O&rsquo;Brian-think we are racist. We know how the game is being played and we know what&rsquo;s at stake.</p>
<p>Throw the racism charge right back at the Hispanics.</p>

		<p>If you have ever listened the Terry Anderson show (a black man) who has a show about illegal immigration. He often plays a clip by some Hispanic politician who says &#8221; If those rednecks try to do what is in best interest of their communities by enforcing immigration laws they will be sorry&#8221; In other words he knows that hispanic immigration is bad for White people. The fact is Hispanic immigration hurts blacks even more than whites. So why would white supremacist be against hispanic immigration if it hurts Blacks. </p>

<p>I checked her biographical page on Congress.org.  She appears to be white, with light brown hair.  Linda Sanchez&rsquo; name in private life is Mrs. Jim Sullivan.</p>

		<p>Every country in the world is practicing it&rsquo;s own brand of &#8220;supremacy&#8221; within it&rsquo;s own borders.  Mexican supremacy, Chinese supremacy, North Korean supremacy, etc.  It&rsquo;s only when White nations are involved, especially the US, that are not expected to defend their own racial interests.  </p>

		<p>This country needs to fight for its survival against the current massive Third World invasion and the policies that have allowed it.  It will be a tough fight because this problem has been allowed to brewed for too long.  The two major parties do not want to deal with the non-ending illegal influx of Third World peoples.  At the current rate of influx and breeding this country&rsquo;s survival is fast losing ground.  They will keep on coming if this country do not stand firm.  Ms. Sanchez should be deported to fight for her own country against poverty and corruption.  This country do not need anymore of her kind to tell us how bad we are so that the welfare and invasion can keep continuing.  This country has wasted vast amount of resources to help countries of color at the expense of its citizens.  It is time to stop.</p>

		<p>The fairy tale that Mexicans are only reclaiming &#8220;lands stolen&#8221; from them is being used by the criminals aka illegal aliens to justify their crimes. </p>
<p>However, on another (military history) forum, I started a thread which examined whether any land was stolen from the Mexicans after they were defeated in the Mexican American war.</p>
<p>I had to go back to newspapers from 1846,which are available on the library of congress website, to obtain information other than the PC that the US SW is land stolen from Mexico. I won&rsquo;t go into details but, for example Arizona had less than 1,000 Mexicans in the 1840s. The area where the few Mexicans who actually stoled the land from the Indians, was not part of the land ceded to the US in 1848. It was sold to the US after the dictator of Mexico Santa Ana begged the US to buy the area that makes up extreme southern Arizona.  So Sanchez is a liar. Her ancestors have no claim to Arizona and she should immigrate to Mexico.</p>

How sweet it&rsquo;s going to be when the authorities start rounding up the illegals. And of course, there&rsquo;ll be national protests, riots, and who knows what else.

<p>Yes, both low IQd, uneducated fools kept in women, booze and high living by those who funded their campaigns (and call the shots).  Your forgot to mention how they both &#8216;shared&rsquo; la raza TV news anchor mirthala salinas  &mdash;  after nunez was finished with her, he passed her along to his &#8216;compadre&rsquo; VivaLaRaza (and others):</p>

<p>As for fabian nunez, another la raza-type racist, did you know his son was on trial for murder?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Esteban Nunez, the 20-year-old son of former state Assembly Speaker and Los Angeles political powerhouse fabian nunez, took a plea deal on Wednesday in the case of a stabbing death at San Diego State University in the fall of 2008. Nunez and co-defendant Ryan Jett plead guilty to Manslaughter and two counts of assault with a deadly weapon and could each face up to 16 years in Prison for the stabbing death of Luis Santos on the night of Oct. 4&hellip;.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Although Hispanics have a slightly higher group I.Q. than blacks and do considerably better than blacks it is due to the high percentage of white blood within their ranks.  However, if only the mostly indians are counted within the group I&rsquo;m pretty sure the average I.Q. would be down somewhere around the black average, with the same kind of inability as blacks for not being able to maintain a first world civilization, though their work ethic would be considerably higher. </p>
<p>I can tell you and be perfectly accurate that the mostly European types governing Mexico right now are estatic that they are sending their least competents up here.  It&rsquo;s like Castro emptying his prisons, asylums and sending his dumbest subjects in a Mariel boat lift, after Carter&rsquo;s ignorant faux pas. </p>
<p>So, if we have a Mexican school board in Los Angeles teaching their soon to-be-drop-outs hate propaganda, what else can be expected from people who were rejected by their own country and forced onto the welfare rolls of the US?</p>
<p>And, as Linda Chavez reveals, this burden extends into politics as well.</p>
<p>When you add to a country&rsquo;s population with immigrants, the smart thing to do is only accept those with a skill or an I.Q. high enough to learn at least on an average basis, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Until recent times we have pretty much followed this procedure with exceptions from time to time.  But this changed for the worse many years ago. Right now, along with blacks, we are beset with about 90 million basket cases that not only have to be cared for they really aren&rsquo;t smart enough to advance any nation in any way, yet we are required to pretend that they are and lie through our teeth to that effect every single day of the year.  </p>
<p>The really dangerous part, however, is when they occupy positions of authority and increase their numbers beyond about 3%.  Our burden now amounts to about 30%, and the situation has placed us on the edge of collapse socially and economically, and we are staring social unrest and breakup right in the face, as these dark omens extend their collective arm and beckon to us with their collective finger, at the same time trying to distract us from the bottomless chasm just in front of us that will swallow us completely if we continue.</p>
<p>We have to have mass defections in another direction for some of us able to perceive the danger ahead before we get there if we are to survive as a people.  We must go our way.  Let the others, along with our traitors, continue ahead on the same path and be glad we have to deal with them no more.</p>
<p>Then, our work will begin again.  This time let&rsquo;s get it right.  Homogeneity.  In thought and race. And nothing less.  No compromises.</p>

		<p>I have heard this Sanchez chick on Fox News. She talks a real neocon rap. She was bashing the unions because of their alleged corruption. I can&rsquo;t remember the particulars but she was pretty convincing. Way smarter than you average Wise Latina Woman. So my guess is that she is Anti White Union-Pro Amnesty Immigration let&rsquo;s take their jobs away. </p>
<p>Her condemnation of unions was a ruse for the fact that Unions tend to at least try and protect their workers with competency requirements and wage minimums coupled with select memberships. </p>
<p>Her charade is finally revealed. </p>

Just what white supremacists out there are wielding so much political power as to get such a controversial and un-PC law as this one in Arizona passed? And be operating in multiple states?
