<h1>Pharmaceuticals Failed to Warn African Americans of Drug&rsquo;s Dangers</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kelly Holleran, Madison/St. Clair Record (Edwardsville, Illinois), May 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The makers of a popular drug used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder find themselves named as defendants in a lawsuit in which consumers claim the drug causes life-threatening skin problems, including a syndrome that causes the top layer of a person&rsquo;s skin to shed and die.</p>
<p>Nineteen plaintiffs from across the country filed a lawsuit April 27 in St. Clair County Circuit Court against the makers of drug products that contain carbamazepine. Defendants include Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp., CIBA Pharmaceuticals and Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The plaintiffs claim doctors prescribed either them or their deceased relatives carbamazepine drug products, which caused them to develop a skin rash, itching, skin discoloration, skin exfoliation, shedding of the hair, shedding of the nails, loss of skin pigmentation, hives, burns, scarring, damaged eyesight, permanent damage to their internal organs, hypersensitivity, Stevens Johnson Syndrome or Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis Syndrome or a combination of all of the above.</p>
<p>Carbamazepine  &mdash;  a mood-stabilizing and anticonvulsant drug usually used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder  &mdash;  has been sold under the brand name Tegretol, the drug the plaintiffs ingested to treat their conditions, according to the complaint. Tegretol, a drug that has existed since 1966, has a storied history.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Different races, such as African Americans, Hispanics, native Indians, Asians and Caucasians, face an increased risk of developing SJS and TEN because of their genetics. African Americans and Asians remain especially prone to developing the life-threatening skin conditions because of a gene they have a tendency to carry, the complaint says.</p>
<p>Despite the connection to race and the dangers of the drug, Novartis did nothing for years to warn physicians or consumers of the possible health concerns, the plaintiffs claim. In December 2007, after the FDA forced the Tetragel manufacturer to place a warning label on the drug, it provided a warning to Asians and recommended they be tested for the gene before ingesting the medication, according to the complaint. Still, the warning failed to caution African Americans to do the same, the suit states.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In their 20-count complaint, the plaintiffs allege strict products liability, breach of express warranty, negligence, misrepresentation by omission, negligence per se, negligent misrepresentation, fraud and misrepresentation, fraud by concealment, violation of consumer protection laws, breach of implied warranties, constructive fraud, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress and wrongful death.</p>
<p>They seek compensatory damages, statutory remedies, a disgorgement of profits, pre-judgment interest, costs, punitive damages and other relief the court deems just. They also want Novartis to pay for testing and medical monitoring costs, which they say may save their lives.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;d bet that more blacks died in one day from black on black crime than died in the entire history of taking this drug.  But, ya know, there is no ghetto lottery payoff in recognizing that fact and suing each other.</p>

		<p>This is bogus. The drug has been on the market for 30+ years - now, suddenly, lawsuits emerge? It&rsquo;s nothing more than a ghetto lottery for blacks who probably never even paid for or even bothered to take the drug. Moreover, they&rsquo;re too stupid to realize they are being used by lawyers who will keep most of whatever money they extort from the legal system - which is now simply a giant ATM for auto-payments linked to black grievances great and small and, mostly, imagined and fabricated.</p>

		<p>Yep.  Another Ghetto Lottery in the offing.  Notice there are no demands to take the drug off the market.  Shoot, every black that has taken this drug and has a keloid on their body, will be jumping into this Ghetto Lottery.  Novartis will being paying off generations of blacks because of their emotional suffering resulting from their ancestors being done a great injustice by letting this dangerous drug remain on the market.  Just wonderful!  Now some blacks that ordinarily could not afford to, will now be purchasing homes in affluent white neighborhoods with this Ghetto Lottery money, where they are not welcome.</p>

		<p>Ok, so if the pharma companies put racially targeted warning labels on their drugs, they would ABSOLUTELY be sued for &#8216;discrimination&rsquo; right?</p>
<p>But if they don&rsquo;t, and the drug affects blacks/others more, well then they also get sued.</p>
<p>Any questions? next&hellip;</p>

		<p>Years ago there was this Vietnam vet, a black man, who had developed a skin rash from his military service. Was being given experimental shots for the rash at Hines hospital. His skin peeled off and he was white underneath. The poor guy lost his marriage, his job because he was sick all the time, and even as a black man was beaten almost every time he went out of doors, as he lived in a black neighborhood and was thought to be white.</p>
<p>The last I ever heard, the VA was desperately trying to find a remedy for the rash and for having the &#8220;turned the man white.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Jedderman, they are white underneath.  I work as a healthcare professional in a hospital which happens to include a Burn Intensive Care Unit.  Every single black I have seen who suffers such burns that the outer black layer is burned off, reveals white skin underneath.  Ever notice the palms of their hands and soles of their feet are white too.</p>
