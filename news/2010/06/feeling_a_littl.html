<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>I&rsquo;m not used to feeling uncomfortable around black people, but I&rsquo;ve had some experiences in South Africa that have made me uneasy.</p>
<p>I was in Soweto watching South Africa&rsquo;s opening match against Mexico when I got into a philosophical discussion with a young black South African about what black South Africans think of African-Americans.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see how the n  &mdash;    &mdash;  s live on TV  &mdash;  the videos, they show me,&#8221; he said, beaming proudly.</p>
<p>Now, you probably think I was uncomfortable because he said the N-word, but that wasn&rsquo;t it. It didn&rsquo;t even offend me, because I realized he meant it as a compliment. I knew that by using that word he was trying to fit in with another black person from the United States, because in the short time I&rsquo;ve been in South Africa, I&rsquo;ve discovered how much black South Africans idolize American rappers, who use the N-word frequently.</p>
<p>Talking with me, though, only seemed to confirm the perceptions of African-Americans he gleaned through entertainment. He ended our conversation by wrapping his arm around my shoulder and telling me that he couldn&rsquo;t wait to tell his grandchildren he had met me: a successful African-American woman. {snip}</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had that type of encounter regularly since I&rsquo;ve been in South Africa. I know this will seem strange, but being treated with such reverence embarrasses me.</p>
<p>Several of my black friends who have visited Africa told me before my trip to prepare for this. {snip}</p>
<p>Like the black maid in Sun City who told me she would love to go back to the States and work as my live-in housekeeper because it would afford her a rare opportunity to work for a &#8220;smart black woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or the black bartender who said to me: &#8220;A black American and a white American .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you all are the same to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was another awkward compliment, but from his viewpoint, he equates the lifestyles of black Americans with white people, both in America and in South Africa.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The problem, though, is that it implies privilege. Am I blessed? Yes. Hard-working? Absolutely. Privileged? Never.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t an easy admission, but on some level I&rsquo;m bothered by the fact that black South Africans would look at me and see any similarities between myself and the privileged classes that oppressed them for hundreds of years. One of the weirdest things about Johannesburg is that every house, gas station, school, grocery store, just about any building is fenced in, protected by either iron gates, barbed wire or a fence  &mdash;  especially in the fancier, mostly white neighborhoods. It&rsquo;s like a city full of military compounds. So when they praise me for living a &#8220;white life,&#8221; are they saying I&rsquo;m also like that?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Certainly a great deal of healing has taken place in South Africa, but there is still an enormous gap between the way blacks and whites live. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}<br>

<p>&#8220;there is still an enormous gap between the way blacks and whites live&#8221;</p>
<p>They still don&rsquo;t get it, never will get it.  To most blacks, in this country and in South Africa, wealth is a zero-sum game.  Wealth is something that must be CREATED - by hard work, thought, planning, organization, will, self-denial, control of impulses, etc., etc.  And as to the first statement, the whites built South Africa.  The blacks moved there, they weren&rsquo;t indigenous. They do what blacks have always done when they have a choice: go where the white man goes, so they can feed off him.  THEN, complain about it.</p>

<p>Of course you cannot be privileged! Only whites can be privileged! It doesn&rsquo;t matter that blacks in America have it better then any other nation of blacks in the world, they are still oppressed and discriminated against.</p>

<p>- - Yeah, healing.  Tell that to the Africaners and the White farmers that are being slaughtered like animals along with one of the highest or perhaps, the highest overall murder rate in the world.  And the folks doing practically all of this are those wonderful Black men and women who only wanted a chance to run their own country their way.  We say what &#8220;their way&#8221; means.</p>

		<p>She actually had to go to South Africa to affirm that her &#8220;ancestors&#8221; are still basically swinging from vines? That they still can&rsquo;t build a wheel barrow let alone a functioning,  fair, prosperous society?

Ohhhh&hellip;I forgot&hellip;the Dutch are still in charge of that. Yet now&hellip;most of the diamonds are in their noses and the gold in their teeth&hellip;just like the rappers they emulate.

This black woman is embarrassed because these black South Africans have exposed the black American lie about how miserable it is for blacks in America.</p>
<p>Black Africans see the honored and privileged place of black Americans. They see the American black man as he really is; living the life on easy street.</p>
<p>I bet they even wish THEIR ancestors were slaves in America.<br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know what planet Ms. Hill is from but I cannot think of a single white person who would accept being called a &#8216;cracker, white bread, gringo&rsquo; or any of a dozen other racial epithets from a fellow white OR other ethny and stick around for more.</p>
<p>Nor would we report the actions of someone who social conscience was just shy of mentally retarded in it&rsquo;s conversion of fictionalized Hollywood perception to actual existence.  We would not be proud of them or humbled by them.</p>
<p>Finally, the creation of miniature armed camps does NOT signify that things need to go &#8216;a lot farther&rsquo; to continue a healing process or redress Apartheid wrongs.  It is indicative of a society on the verge of total breakdown as law and order flees and people begin to look after themselves in a way that polarizes people not around color but have and have not&rsquo;ism.</p>
<p>All because a totally corrupt black government that robs it&rsquo;s own coffers and does nothing for the people who elected it -want&rsquo;s them- to ethnically cleanse their way across the land.  That they might pillage private wealth rather than come with their hand out to their elected leadership.</p>
<p>Meanwhile whites are so terrified that they flee Johannesburg for The Cape in -droves-, even if it cripples them, economically.</p>
<p>And from there, if they are smart, they will NOT reinvest in their homeland but catch the next White Flight to Australia, Canada, or Argentina.</p>
<p>South Africa is now the rape capital of the planet and #7 on the murder list.  If whites isolate themselves in a tiny (visibly exposed) enclave on the coast and the economy continues to slide while ANC sends the nation to hell, the proto civil war environment will quickly descend to Zimbabwean or worse levels.</p>
<p>Sending the World Cup there is a cruel joke, ignoring the massive human rights abuses that go on, daily.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Maybe it&rsquo;s not embarrassment I feel when I interact with black South Africans as much as it is guilt, and a desire to belong and prove a shared experience. I appreciate that their awkward compliments are born out of the fact that they are proud to see someone who looks like them living a life they have been told only whites could live.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s because we share the same skin and because of my profound respect for the unimaginable struggle they&rsquo;ve endured that I never want to be placed in some awkward position of superiority.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not better than them. I&rsquo;m humbled by them.<br>

<p>You&rsquo;ve been sent to South Africa because you&rsquo;re black and entering a landscape where skin color DOES matter, if only a pretentious alignment of media demographies.</p>
<p>You are trying to &#8216;fit in&rsquo; because you want to have a sense of racial community with people who, on average have a ten point disparity with your IQ (at least) but &#8216;who own their country&rsquo;.  Which says a lot about how you really feel about what you will put up with after being culturally alienated, living in the States.</p>
<p>As a function of your ambassadorial status and your inner sense of covictimization, you displace your identity and your dignity onto crude people with bad attitudes rather than face the ugly truth that what has moved out of the tribal lands into J-Berg is as brutally selfish, envious, and stupid as any stereotype image, no matter what label you give it.</p>
<p>Here is the reality of post Apartheid life-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Jones sets forth the raw facts of South Africa&rsquo;s now endemic problem of rape with uncompromising directness. He describes the brutal assault of a white woman, Mrs. Ame Brown, in her Johannesburg home, in the absence of her husband, who was working a night shift. Mrs. Brown&rsquo;s two young sons were bound at the wrists and forced at gunpoint to watch by the four-strong black gang which had broken into their flat as their mother was violated in turn by each of the gang members. Says Jones: &#8220;As the first man made way for the second, he spat out the hate-filled words Ame, an Afrikaner, will never forget: &#8220;For years you Boers always took from us. Now we&rsquo;re taking from you.&#8221; </p>
<p>In fact, Ame Brown worked as a care assistant looking after mainly black children at a Johannesburg home for youngsters. But her work on behalf of such an underprivileged, have-not section of the population obviously cut no ice with her assailants. Her race was all that mattered as far as they were concerned. &#8220;Afterwards,&#8221; continues Jones&hellip; </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; the attackers remained in the family&rsquo;s home, a second-floor apartment, for almost two hours before brazenly carrying away everything they could find - from furniture right down to the boys&rsquo; favourite Dinky toys - through the front door and into a waiting car.&#8221; </p>
<p>The attack had what Jones describes as &#8220;its desired effect.&#8221; The Browns left the city, with its &#8220;gratuitously violent gangs and simmering undercurrent of residual racial resentment.&#8221; But their move to a rural location did not help them escape their nightmares. Their having been, in effect, thus &#8216;ethnically cleansed&rsquo; from Johannesburg, the family&rsquo;s wounds, both psychological and physical, persisted and festered. <br>
&gt;</p>

<p>Have a care while you&rsquo;re there, Ms. Hill, because while white women are premium meat, black women still form the statistical majority of victims.</p>

		<p>Compared to South Africa, this black American writer does live in gated community.  Most places in the U.S.A. are much safer than any of the &#8220;military compounds&#8221; where the white S Africans live, surrounded by a 90% black population.  And she does have privilege compared to them (affirmative action, hate speech laws).  It is sad, but it the direction that the U.S.A. is headed.  Look at I.Q. scores.  We all know that blacks have lower I.Q.s than whites no matter where they are, but being in a white society brings up the black average, just as white South Africans have lower I.Q.s than other whites, in Europe or in the U.S.A.  It won&rsquo;t be long before all the blacks and Mexicans living in our country will make the same thing happen to us-dumbed down by the low intelligence around us, voting to elect a black president, and letting the country our ancestors had the guts to fight for being overtaken and taken away. </p>

		<p>Just another self-infatuated black given a platform to vent their all important feelings and obsess about race. Whites &#8220;oppressed&#8221; blacks for &#8220;hundreds of years&#8221;, she writes. Apartheid was officially enacted only in 1948. Blacks migrated into the area from further north seeking work and other benefits from the white population. The ratio of blacks to whites a hundred years ago was not so lopsided as it is now, black numbers increasing exponentially since then and enabling them to take over. Don&rsquo;t let the facts stand in the way of a good legend, especially one that continues the narrative of blacks being a noble race. Mediocre, semi-literate and self-congratulory, the writer is obviously a beneficiary of the &#8220;privilege&#8221; of affirmative action. How long did it take to write this stream of consciousness drivel, about 10 minutes?    </p>

		<p>We lived in SA until 1999 when we left, escaping the violent and corrupt society that SA had become under the Marxist trained and supported by the West govt that had managed to grab power using terrorism and propaganda about how bad Apartheid was.  But some people now who ask me what was Aparheid and when I explain the overall concept, not just the bad minor points used by the Marxists to turn the Western World against the white govt. that had turned SA into an economic miracle in Africa (or compared with many countries elsewhere) so good in fact that many black people from central Africa came to live there as even with Apartheid, life was so much better for them than in their own &#8220;free&#8221; countries, the &#8220;ignorant&#8221; who had only read the propaganda realised that they had been hoodwinked and said so. </p>
<p>But the future Africans there in all those countries will pay the price as the murdering in their thousands of white farmers in SA who have been producing reliably food for many decades or even centuries in some areas means that hunger is soon to follow as history in Africa shows.</p>
<p>Please remember this when the clasped hands are held out again for international aid by even South Africa, a country that thrived and no one starved even with international sanctions in place just 30 to 20 years ago.</p>
<p>They must be forced to make it on their own despite any arguments being made about how droughts (that have plagued the continent for centuries, were caused by the West with their man-made global warming, a flawed theory that is now being attacked by many prominent scientists and people as being badly researched.</p>
<p>The continent must be kept unitary until they are desperate for colonisation again by those who can solve the many problems there, and the masses must be kept out of the West where they can quickly procreate and take over.  Zimbabwe is just the beginning. </p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve got that right.</p>
<p>Despite how successful Ms. Jemele Hill is, she sees herself and believes herself to be the victim of the white man and the white mans&rsquo; racism. Regardless of her position and circumstance, it&rsquo;s what she KNOWS to be true. She&rsquo;s been told this since she was in her mothers womb. </p>
<p>Blacks believe themselves to be the eternal victim. It&rsquo;s how they seem themselves and the world. It&rsquo;s one of the reasons I believe it&rsquo;s pointless talking to blacks. As much as they have, they will believe they should have more if not for racism.  They actually believe their own hype that THEY created the modern world and THEY could build the great Utopia if only the white man would step aside.<br>

<p>People accept the use of the word &#8216;red-neck&rsquo;. The word &#8216;red-neck&rsquo;, is normally used by a speaker in an attempt to show everyone else how enlightened he is. This is interesting, because the nearest corollary to &#8216;red-neck&rsquo; is the &#8216;N&rsquo; word.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s like a city full of military compounds. So when they praise me for living a &ldquo;white life,&rdquo; are they saying I&rsquo;m also like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>  Yes indeed, how do wealthy people live in the rest of black Africa? Don&rsquo;t they live in similar military compounds? When America is down to 50% white, how different will we be from South Africa? Does the government make the nation or the people who live there?  I believe that Ms. Hill would say it is the government. </p>

		<p>What does she expect? All Africans see are millionaire black rappers, basketball stars, movie stars and foul mouthed comedians. They act just like rich white chicks from the suburbs who patrol arena parking lots to have Kobe`s baby. They don`t see the perp walks, crack abies, etc. Even our drive by shooting are pale compared to their`s. They are like the Martians, who after watching tv would honestly infer that blacks in Amercia were the dominant group led by one of their own. The end isn`t far off boys.<br>

		<p>It looks like some reality finally made it through the ideological blinders. The author was forced, in her limited way, to recognize that maybe, just maybe, the real world does not quite live up to the delusions perpetuated by the Western media.</p>
<p><i>Like the black maid in Sun City who told me she would love to go back to the States and work as my live-in housekeeper because it would afford her a rare opportunity to work for a &ldquo;smart black woman.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>This statement says a lot. After getting what they demanded in their own country, black South Africans want to move to the USA, despite its &#8220;racism.&#8221; Now consider that she seems to be saying that things are better when Whites, or blacks who have been assimilated into White culture, run the show. We can see this on a larger scale with the mass migration of third world peoples into Europe-North America. </p>
<p>But no one seems to rethink the &#8220;liberation&#8221; struggles of the latter part of the 20th century in which third world peoples got exactly what they demanded: an end to colonialism, &#8220;people&rsquo;s&#8221; governments [aka one party states which wrecked their economies], and plenty of White hand-wringing-guilt plus foreign aid.  Yet despite getting the countries they demanded, third worlders must now escape from them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of a more general phenomenon of third world peoples, while demanding &#8220;liberation,&#8221; can not live with the consequences of getting what they demanded. Instead, they have a tacit understanding that life is better for everyone, even those at the lower end of the feeding chain, in White/Western run countries. </p>
<p><i>This isn&rsquo;t an easy admission, but on some level I&rsquo;m bothered by the fact that black South Africans would look at me and see any similarities between myself and the privileged classes that oppressed them for hundreds of years. </i></p>
<p>If she feels so bothered by her &#8220;privilege,&#8221; then why not give up her fancy job and move to the new South Africa? Why continue to live in a racist USA when she can live in a liberated country such as newSA?  </p>
<p><i>One of the weirdest things about Johannesburg is that every house, gas station, school, grocery store, just about any building is fenced in, protected by either iron gates, barbed wire or a fence &mdash; especially in the fancier, mostly white neighborhoods. </i></p>
<p>&#8220;Weird?&#8221; What&rsquo;s so weird about people protecting themselves from violent criminals? Does this not fit in with the post-apartheid paradise of a rainbow nation that was supposed to spring forth on the veldt?</p>
<p>What is going on here is a cognitive disconnect in which she can not accept the hellacious nature of the new SA.  She sees things which do not fit into the picture, so she tries to reinterpret them in terms of ideology. Rather than seeing these compounds as another symptom of declining quality of life under majority-rule, she puts a positive spin on things by referring to a healing process. </p>
<p>Again, it is a matter of reality breaking through, even if ever so briefly, on the ideological-media delusion in which she has lived for her entire life. </p>
<p><i>Finally, the creation of miniature armed camps does NOT signify that things need to go &lsquo;a lot farther&rsquo; to continue a healing process or redress Apartheid wrongs.</i></p>
<p>What is this &#8220;healing&#8221; that is going on in new SA? Does she seriously think that things will get better and eventually everyone in the rainbow nation will hold hands and sing kum-bay-ya together? Again the ideological blinders. As in most of the rest of Africa, things are on a slide downward. There&rsquo;s a lot more to wreck in South Africa, given how the country was built up under apartheid, but here seems to be no changing the historical course of self-destruction. </p>
<p>As for the &#8220;wrongs&#8221; of apartheid, of course, prior to White colonization of South Africa there were no cities, no railroads, no power plants, no universities, no scientific agriculture. Perhaps she would prefer to live in a country which has none of these things. Maybe she can move on up to Zimbabwe. </p>
<p><i><br>
The end isn`t far off boys.</i></p>
<p>Hard to argue that point!<br>

		<p>In the meantime, a white nurse (apparently) has invented an anti-rape condom that a female wears.  It has teeth that seizes the male rapist&rsquo;s organ.  It remains attached when the rapist withdraws in pain, assisting with an arrest.  The article I saw said that with rape so bad in SA, this condom has become necessary.  </p>

<p>I saw that story too, with a picture of the clever device.  When it said that it could be used to collect evidence to get a prosecution, I thought to myself:  Good luck with that.  The President (Jacob Zuma) has a history of rape and advocates rape.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also waiting for the first time that a man and woman agree to sex and she forgets to tell him that she has one of those things in her.  The lawyers will be a&rsquo;flockin.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Mediocre, semi-literate and self-congratulory, the writer is obviously a beneficiary of the &ldquo;privilege&rdquo; of affirmative action. How long did it take to write this stream of consciousness drivel, about 10 minutes?&#8221;</p>
<p>Every piece of writing that I read from an &#8216;African-american&rsquo;, whether they be professor, school teacher, or even school superintendent or the person above on ESPN Soccernet, all have one thing in common. They read like something that has been written by a twelve year old. </p>

		<p>The writer herself says she was in that pigsty Soweto, and felt uneasy because the residents of Soweto thought she was a privileged American Bantu. Heck, a Wisconsin dairy farm looks better than Soweto. Her insides are also gnawed, since she pretends not to understand why the white neighborhoods of Johannesburg seem like military compounds, to her. She also is amazed that South African Bantus make no distinction between American Bantus and Caucasians in terms of living the same lifestyle.</p>
<p>After all, isn&rsquo;t that what this woman wanted, equality? </p>

		<p>You would think she might learn from this experience.  Having met others who treat her as &#8220;privileged&#8221;, she struggles with how to respond, thinking that she is not privileged (though I bet she is, through affirmative action, etc).  But does she stop to consider that the whites whom she calls privileged feel the same way as she does when so labeled?  No.</p>

<p>Saw the picture. Looks like it has to be a lot bigger than the man&rsquo;s thing, yet it&rsquo;s supposed to be inside the woman all day. What kind of woman would want this? Maybe a white woman who wants to protect herself from white rapists, but who has sex freely with black men. Can it be long before this condom, too, is available for American school kids? </p>

I like her rationalization of Africans using the n-word.</p>
<p>She doesn&rsquo;t blame American black rappers for legitimizing the word and she accepts the usage by Africans.</p>
<p>American blacks wanted to own the word. Now black Africans do too.</p>
