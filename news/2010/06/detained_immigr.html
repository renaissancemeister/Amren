<h1><a href="https://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_CENSUS_DETENTION_CENTERS?SITE=FLTAM&amp;SECTION=US">Detained Immigrants May Help Bring in Census Money</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Manuel Valdes, Tampa Bay Online, May 31, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Paulo Sergio Alfaro-Sanchez, an illegal immigrant being held at a detention center in Washington state, had no idea that the federal government would count him in the census.</p>
<p>No one gave him a census form. No one told him his information would be culled from the center&rsquo;s records.</p>
<p>But counted he was, along with other illegal immigrants facing deportation in detention centers across the country  &mdash;  about 30,000 people on any given day, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs and Enforcement.</p>
<p>By the time the census delivers the total tallies to the state and federal government, most of the immigrants will be long gone. But because the population snapshot determines the allocation of federal dollars, those in custody could help bring money to the towns, cities and counties in Texas, Arizona, Washington and Georgia where the country&rsquo;s biggest and newest facilities are located.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the irony, if there&rsquo;s any irony, is that the locality is what&rsquo;s going to benefit, because you have a detention center in a particular city where people have been brought from different parts of the region, and that community will benefit,&#8221; said Arturo Vargas, executive director of National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, an organization that has pushed Latinos to participate in the census.</p>
<p>This census brings a twist, though. For the first time, states have the option of counting people in detention centers and prisons as residents of their last address before they&rsquo;re detained, worrying some local lawmakers who say cities and counties that host detention centers could lose money.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>ICE operates 22 immigrant detention centers and also houses people in hundreds of other jails or prisons. Most of the largest centers are in small towns in Texas, Arizona and Georgia. Texas is home to six detention centers, and Arizona has three.</p>
<p>The payout can be hefty for small towns. Federal money being distributed from the census averaged about $1,469 per person in fiscal year 2008, according to the Brookings Institution, and other grants are also available to small towns depending on their population.</p>
<p>In Raymondville, Texas, a town of nearly 10,000 people, the Willacy Detention Center holds an average daily population of about 1,000. The center opened in 2006 and was a boon to the community as ICE and the private company that runs the center rushed to hire personnel.</p>
<p>Now, the detention center&rsquo;s population may push Raymondville over the town&rsquo;s goal of surpassing 10,000, a number that will allow them to qualify for more federal help, Mayor Orlando Correa said.</p>

Trolling for bodies to boost census numbers using illegals has gone beyond shameless. It should be considered criminal.</p>
<p>The census has long since stopped being about counting people and re-apportionment. It&rsquo;s now nothing but a scam for states to grab money from the federal government.</p>

<p>Immigrants?</p>
<p>When, when, WHEN will members of the press stop referring to illegal aliens as <b> &#8220;immigrants&#8221;?  </b></p>
<p>They are INVADERS, and they are criminals, they are not immigrants!  They are no more &#8220;immigrants&#8221; than burglars in your home are &#8220;univited guests&#8221;, or a rapist is a &#8220;boyfriend&#8221;!!! </p>
<p>Reporters (like this Manuel Valdes) are part of the problem. They are abbetors to the crime and are complicit in helping the invaders to escape detection by obscuring their true status behind garbled words.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, this point has been made over and over,  time and again&hellip; and it does no good;  they continue making this &#8220;mistake&#8221;.</p>
