<h1>Black Leaders Leaving DISD Along With Students</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tawnell D. Hobbs, Dallas Morning News, June 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><i>Second of two parts</i></p>

<i>[Part 1 of this series, &#8220;&#8216;Black Flight&rsquo; Changing the Makeup of Dallas Schools,&#8221; can be read <a href="/news/2010/06/black_flight_ch.html" target="part 1" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>here.</b></a>]</i>
</blockquote>
<p>As the number of black children in Dallas ISD declined over the last decade, the number of black activists closely observing school board meetings has dwindled to a few in the audience.</p>
<p>And some leaders of a civil rights group that once battled for equal education in Dallas schools are now urging black parents to send their kids elsewhere. Some say the rising attention to the needs of children learning English is overshadowing the needs of black students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not a surprise to anybody that blacks are leaving DISD,&#8221; said Juanita Wallace, president of the Dallas NAACP. &#8220;We know that Hispanics are really taking over the school district. The whites are completely gone, and now blacks are going.&#8221;</p>
<p>The number of black students in DISD has fallen from 60,000 a decade ago to about 41,000 today. Meanwhile, suburban districts  &mdash;  such as Cedar Hill, Mansfield and DeSoto  &mdash;  and Dallas charter schools show growing numbers of black students. Though DISD&rsquo;s overall enrollment of about 157,000 students is fairly flat, the percentage of Hispanic students has soared to 68 percent. The percentage of black students, the dominant group from 1975 to 1994, has dropped to 26 percent. White students now make up about 5 percent of the district, down sharply from 57 percent in 1970.</p>
<p><b>Hispanic focus denied</b></p>
<p>DISD Superintendent Michael Hinojosa did not voice concern about the drop in black students in a recent interview, saying that it is a trend reflected nationwide. But the decrease in Dallas is more than in other large Texas districts and most major districts nationwide. He disagreed that black children in DISD are being treated any differently.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hispanic leaders, some of whom battled alongside black leaders in the 1960s and &rsquo;70s for equal education, say it only makes sense that more focus be paid to Hispanic students because of their larger numbers and special needs, such as bilingual education. The district spends nearly $6.9 million a year on stipends for certified bilingual teachers. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Diaz recently noted that he had a hard time identifying &#8220;Hispanic activists&#8221; to weigh in on the issue of blacks leaving the district  &mdash;  other than longtime activist and attorney Adelfa Callejo.</p>
<p>Callejo believes that blacks are &#8220;abandoning&#8221; DISD. She said it&rsquo;s like history repeating itself  &mdash;  when whites fled DISD en masse after a 1971 federal court order to desegregate Dallas schools. The order meant the district would have to provide minority children with the same education that white children were receiving. In 2003, a federal judge declared DISD desegregated.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Anthony Peterson is among the leaders of the Black Coalition to Maximize Education, a civil rights group that became a plaintiff in DISD&rsquo;s decades-long desegregation suit. He has children in DISD&rsquo;s magnet schools, which offer specialized instruction. He said he would not recommend sending black kids to regular district campuses. He, along with the group&rsquo;s spokeswoman, Shirley Daniels, has encouraged parents to consider other options.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some parents in Dallas have varying reasons for bypassing DISD, including a belief that smaller educational environments are better  &mdash;  and safer  &mdash;  for their children.</p>
<p><b>Educator numbers</b></p>
<p>Some black leaders say that the district&rsquo;s focus on Hispanic children has caused black veteran teachers to lose their jobs. Data on teacher experience by race wasn&rsquo;t readily available, but the percentage of black teachers in DISD was at about 40 percent in <nobreak>2008-09,</nobreak> the same as before Hinojosa&rsquo;s arrival five years ago. The percentage of Hispanic teachers in DISD has increased since Hinojosa arrived, from almost 16 percent to 22 percent in <nobreak>2008-09.</nobreak> The number of white teachers has declined during that time, from 42 percent to 35 percent.</p>
<p>Joyce Foreman, also a member of the Black Coalition to Maximize Education, said she&rsquo;s not surprised that blacks are leaving DISD because the focus on their children has waned, citing cuts in funding to learning centers established as part of the desegregation order. {snip}</p>

		<p>Too bad for the White schools that will suffer from the influx of new blacks.  We should lament and pray for our White Brothers and Sisters who will be dispossessed and degraded by the coming black wave.</p>
<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t the blacks make a citizen&rsquo;s arrest on any school principal who allows illegal aliens to steal education from Dallas&rsquo; legal citizens and property tax payers?  <br>

<p>In urban Canada, this is becoming a major issue with white parents and students.  Teachers who spend too much time on the immigrant children have no time for white kids. </p>
<p>Students who don&rsquo;t speak English are one of the driving reasons that private school enrolment is on the rise, as whites seek a better learning environment for their children away from immigrants.</p>

		<p>So I guess blacks don&rsquo;t want to stick around to experience the joys of diversity.  They want someone else to experience it when they show up elsewhere.</p>

		<p>As someone who was raised in the inner city of Chicago I have experienced going to school in both Mexican, as well as black majority schools. When I attended the nearly all black school I was not even given the courtesy of being called by my birth name. My name basically became &#8220;White Mother _ _ _ _ _ _&#8221;. That is how they normally referred to me, and that is how I was addressed. I then transferred to a school that was mostly Mexican.(while having a handful of whites and blacks) To be fair, the Mexicans treated me quite well (in comparison to how the blacks treated me) for the most part. My name became James again. I played on the football team where I started at runningback for the Varsity team my junior and senior year. I ran track and would end up going down state in the 200 meter dash where I finished 7th in the State. I even took a rather attractive panamanian girl to the senior prom. (No, I am not advocating mixing, my Australian wife is half Serbian and Half Greek)I say all this only to illustrate that while outnumbered by Mexicans, I atleast had some level of participation and was not despised for the color of my skin. When I went to the black school, I was lower than a dog in their eyes and their to be mistreated. I was fortunate in the sense that God has given me a strong body so actual physical abuse against me was a rarity (although I was jumped twice in the two years I went to that hell hole and bear the facial scars even today) Anyway, I know I went a bit off of the topic, however I read Amren almost daily and believe in their position on racial realism. The races are different. Very different. And those differences show themsleves every single day. Those who deny this are either ignorant,or lying. </p>

		<p>And, interestingly, after the departure of black children test scores for the school district will begin to rise. Hispanics have a natural intelligence that is lacking in blacks and even though English is not their first language they will perform better than most blacks.</p>

		<p>Anonymous 9:07 June 9:The white girl who was gang raped in Richmond was gang raped by mostly hispanics, a couple of blacks, and at least one white. Going into an alley at 10 PM where there are a bunch of male teens, no matter what their race is, to put it mildly is foolhardy. Read what James from Australia (6) said.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve taught on both coasts - virtually all Hispanics or all Blacks. Trust me, Hispanics are WAY, WAY better. In 22 years of teaching, I was never cursed at, disrespected or assaulted by my Hispanic kids - and I taught in South Central LA! My kids were hardly motivated to learn, and they might have beat the snot out of each other - but they and their families had great regard and appreciation for me, &#8220;el maestro&#8221;. The east coast blacks were uniformly arrogant, disrespectful, violent thugs. It was nothing less than hell working with them. Between the two groups, there&rsquo;s no doubt which one this Irish boy would pick!</p>
