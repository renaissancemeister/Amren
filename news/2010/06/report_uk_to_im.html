<h1><a href="https://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5739973,00.html">Report: UK to Impose Temporary Cap on Migrants</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Darren Mara, Deutsche Welle, June 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The British government has unveiled a series of measures to gradually cut the number of skilled immigrants entering the UK. The temporary cap is to precede a permanent limit next year.</p>
<p>The British government has announced a temporary cap on the number of skilled non-EU immigrants who are allowed to enter Britain, ahead of a permanent cap on numbers to be introduced next April.</p>
<p>The temporary curb will take effect next month, and is to limit the number of non-EU immigrants to just over 24,000 before April 2011, a fall of five percent on last year.</p>
<p>Prime Minister David Cameron took a tough line on immigration during his election campaign last month, promising reductions.</p>
<p>Home Secretary Theresa May said net immigration had been too high under the previous Labour government, and that if left uncontrolled, immigration &#8220;was not a good thing&#8221; due to the pressure it placed on public services.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we have as an aim is indeed to bring immigration down from the hundreds of thousands that it became under Labour to the tens of thousands that it used to be. There are various ways in which we can do that,&#8221; she told BBC Radio.</p>
<p>&#8220;This government believes that Britain can benefit from migration but not uncontrolled migration,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>May added that the interim limit was necessary to avoid a rush of immigrants ahead of the permanent cap next year.</p>
<p>She said that recent figures showed that migration from EU countries to the UK accounted for around 33 percent of the total, with the rest consisting of non-EU and non-British peoples.</p>
<p>Net migration to the UK was 142,000 from January to September last year, down from 160,000 in the previous 12-month period.<br>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;if left uncontrolled, immigration &ldquo;was not a good thing&rdquo; due to the pressure it placed on public services.&#8221;:  HA! Pressure on public services??  Wait until ethnocentric civil war breaks out and then see who worries about public services. </p>
<p>&#8220;This government believes that Britain can benefit from migration but not uncontrolled migration,&#8221;: This is a cry for help.  She knows Britain is dying, but as a politician, she just can&rsquo;t say it.  If she were a true leader and British Statesperson, she would switch to the BNP and demand and end to all immigration.  </p>

		<p>Good news but the British people need to keep the heat on so that the government further reduces the number of non-white immigrants.  These reductions are not enough.</p>

		<p>You can rest assured that there will be no cap on asylum and family unification scams. This will be the final nail in the coffin here.  Write your reps and demand now that we open our doors to white native europeans and english as the UK is about to turn into an islamic version of Zimbabwe.  Also demand that the US stop the flow of non-native europeans and others that hate us by revoking the visa waiver immediately.</p>

		<p>Too little, too late. Now the only solution left is to expel all non-Whites and their White traitor friends from the U.K and all of Europe. </p>

<p>Ummmmm&hellip;why are you claiming an 18,000 reduction when contrasting January to September with 12 months?!</p>
<p>Also, this means citizens of places like Russia, USA, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand will be discriminated against in favour of anyone who just happens to have acquired an EU passport in the last 40 or so years.  </p>

		<p>Britain has finally gotten a clue, and a leadership that recognizes that uncontrolled immigration, particularly from the third world, destroys a country.  When will WE get that clue, and take those actions?  </p>

		<p>The agenda is the extermination of White Majorities, Communists prefer to rule over poor and uneducated, therefore these are just words designed to get millions of Concerned Brits to put their heads back in the sand, nothing will really change, it&rsquo;s deckchair shuffling to placate Brits.<br>

		<p>A good step, but unfortunately it&rsquo;s too little and too late.  The UK is done for.  The only unknown is the expiration date.  It may happen in our lifetime.</p>

		<p>Hang on a minute&hellip; So unemployment in UK has reached 2.51 million and they still left the borders open so 142,000 could come in??? It doesn&rsquo;t make sense. <br>
And mind you these figures are underestimated as usual, they &#8220;forgot&#8221; to include all illegals and &#8220;asylum&#8221; seekers.</p>
