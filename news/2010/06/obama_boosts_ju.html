			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Scott Wong, Politico, June 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Barack Obama is not only breaking barriers in his appointments to the highest court in the land, he&rsquo;s quickly reshaping the lower ranks of the federal judiciary, nominating an unprecedented number of minorities and women.</p>
<p>Monday night, the Senate confirmed three of Obama&rsquo;s judicial picks  &mdash;  all of them women. Among them is Lucy Koh of California, who is slated to become the nation&rsquo;s first Korean-American district court judge.</p>
<p>Also pending confirmation is Goodwin Liu, who would become the first Taiwanese-American federal appellate court judge  &mdash;  though his nomination is threatened by Republicans who believe he&rsquo;s too liberal.</p>
<p>Of Obama&rsquo;s 70 appellate and district court nominees, 44 percent are female and 43 percent are minorities, according to recent analysis by the Alliance for Justice, a liberal advocacy group. By contrast, only 22 percent of President George W. Bush&rsquo;s 322 confirmed judges were female and less than 18 percent were minorities.</p>
<p>Of President Bill Clinton&rsquo;s 372 confirmed judges, 29 percent were women and 25 percent were minorities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If confirmed, Wiliam Martinez, a native of Mexico City, would become the first immigrant to serve on the U.S. District Court of Colorado. Albert Diaz of North Carolina is waiting to become the first Hispanic to serve on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. And Benita Pearson could become the first African-American woman to serve on the First District Court in Ohio. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said it&rsquo;s healthy to have diversity in the courts but not when judges begin favoring their own constituencies.</p>
<p>&#8220;There have been disturbing concepts that have arisen out of the diversity question, and President Obama has suggested that you put a person on the bench to represent that ethnic group,&#8221; Sessions said Monday. &#8220;When the president says he wants someone with empathy, he wants someone with bias.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After weeks of delay, Liu, whom Obama tapped for the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, advanced through the Senate Judiciary Committee last month with no support from Republicans. And some have hinted at a possible filibuster.</p>
<p>If confirmed, the 39-year-old Liu would become the first Taiwanese-American to serve on a federal appeals court and is often mentioned as a possibility to become the first Asian-American to serve on the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>But conservatives paint him as a liberal judicial activist who has defended same-sex marriage and affirmative action and criticized Bush&rsquo;s Supreme Court appointees, John Roberts and Samuel Alito.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Upon Jacqueline Nguyen&rsquo;s confirmation in December as the first Vietnamese-American district court judge, Leahy said, &#8220;Diversity on the bench helps ensure that the words &#8216;equal justice under law,&rsquo; inscribed in Vermont marble over the entrance to the Supreme Court, are a reality and that justice is rendered fairly and impartially.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Strangely, Obama has made very few nominations to the Federal appellate level.  In many cases, the Federal appellate courts have more influence than the Supreme Court, because SCOTUS can only hear so many cases, and it usually lets the opinion of the appellate level stand, with a few exceptions, like the 9th Circus.</p>

<p>Given the context, isn&rsquo;t he basically saying whites are deficient, unfair and impartial? If that&rsquo;s what I have to profess in order to be &#8216;sensitive&rsquo; and &#8216;tolerant&rsquo;, and believe in diversity, count me out.</p>

		<p>Are Whites unable to render &#8220;equal justice under law?&#8221;  As I understand it, Whites can write and pass laws but only minorities (for now) have the ability interpret it fairly?  Something doesn&rsquo;t add up.</p>

		<p>As bad as being ruled by white liberals has been, when non-whites reach a critical mass in positions of power, things will get much uglier.  You can bet that people like Liu and Koh will be more willing to ignore the Constitution in their efforts to use the courts to dispossess whites.  White liberals, as bad they are, are mostly motivated a desire to be fair to non-whites and treat them equally.  Non-white leftists are interested in naked power grabs and have no concern for treating whites with fairness or equality.  <br>

		<p>The plain language of the Constitution should govern judges when rendering constitutional decisions.  Decisions should not be based on he personal beliefs and policy preferences of a particular judge.  They have a different role which is to search for answers to the issues presented to them based on what the Constitution and the law compel. <br>
Based on his time in office, Obama has not shown great respect for the Constitution and seems to be appointing judges who also believe they will just do what they consider &#8220;right&#8221; with little regard to the constraints of the Constitution.<br>
When a judge strays from his obligation, he undermines the very structure of our Constitution, disenfranchises the people and inserts into law subjective opinions that often lead to inconsistent, illogical and flawed results.<br>

<p>President Obama&rsquo;s first Supreme Court nominee fits the Sessions formulation of Obama&rsquo;s selection criteria in spades.</p>
<p>Sotomayor is a member of the Hispanic National Bar Association, the Association of Judges of Hispanic Heritage, the National Council of La Raza [the race], the Puerto Rican Bar Association and the Latino Justice Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund. So rooted is Sotomayor in her ethnic identity she thinks in those terms about the law: </p>
<p>&#8220;I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn&rsquo;t lived that life.&#8221; </p>

		<p>The Amren community appears to be the most informed, well-read, and passionate group of True White Americans found on the Internet.  Each of your comments contribute to  growing and strengthening our now widening White Awarian Community.  </p>
<p>And thank you, Jared Taylor and all others behind the scenes, for your vast investment in bettering our human race.  Little by little, post by post, comment by comment, you are making a huge difference by building bridges of reality to reach the shores of sanity. </p>
<p>All it takes is one sentence in one post in one comment to open vast vistas of racial awareness in the mind of one web surfing, race suffering White Student.   The comment that most persistently rings in my own head was &#8220;I boycott restaurants that serve the blacks.&#8221;    </p>
<p>That one sentence set me on a course of reading and learning about the White Citizens Councils, Massive Resistance, and the Shining Bright White Lights of Segregation,  with James Jackson Kilpatrick being the latest.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never again see America, or my White role in it, the same way after what I&rsquo;ve learned thanks to Amren.  You were the good doctor who administered the life-saving first dose.  Thank you, eternally. </p>
<p><br>
Regarding this Obama post, most of us have no doubt read Rosalie Gordon&rsquo;s &#8220;Nine Men Against America&#8221;, and thus we are the ones who have knowledgeable insight into the long march that led to our Obama Diversity Disaster and its virulent effect on the already ruined judiciary.</p>
<p><a href="http://sovereignstates.org/books/NMAA/NineMen_Cover.html" rel="nofollow">http://sovereignstates.org/books/NMAA/NineMen_Cover.html</a></p>
<p><br>
We are now losing the last visible portions of our White Republic, and our greatest lament is that most of the damage done to us was done by White Men.  We have much more work to do in informing our people that the true and first enemies are not the swarms of incompetent, indolent, and violent blacks who make us miserable and who should be back home in Africa instead of in our America. </p>
<p>Elite, Liberal, Powerful White Men are responsible for our nation&rsquo;s ruin and wreckage: Charles Sumner, Thaddeus Stevens, Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Earl Warren, Ike &#8220;Send in the Troops&#8221; Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson, Ted Kennedy, etc.</p>
<p>We are victims mostly of our own race.  What to make of that? Why should we feel superior? On what claim?</p>
<p>How can we develop a rhetoric and strategy that forces Whites who work against Whites to suffer on the front lines of racial dispossession and degradation?  We must find a way! </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s develop our narrative right here as a collaborative project.</p>
<p>Also, I greatly appreciate all the Amreners who post links and make reading recommendations.  Let&rsquo;s build a stronger community by helping each other more often in those ways.  Let&rsquo;s commit to closing our posts with a comment on what we are currently reading and by making recommendations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reading Demosthenes, Theognis, Hinton Rowan Helper, Professor Charles Carroll, Thomas Cranmer&rsquo;s Book of Common Prayer, Martin Luther&rsquo;s Theologica Germanica, and James George Frazer&rsquo;s Golden Bough.  I recommend Helper most of all. I&rsquo;ve never encountered a more passionate Race Realist. Thanks to Amren posters for the links to his books.</p>
<p><br>
Let&rsquo;s all do our part to drive Abe F. and Heidi B. into such a frenzy of panicked workaholic activity that they never again make it home to bathe.<br>

		<p>it&rsquo;s hard for me to grasp the concept, is barry saying that different races have different brands or flavors of justice? is he saying that white judges give inferior justice to all except whites? it sounds like what he is really saying is white judges are not as qualified as black or asian or mexican and it&rsquo;s time for the new and improved &#8220;people of color justice system&#8221;, but we have all seen the brand of justice produced in africa, and asia and mexico, and nobody wants any of that.<br>
I wish these &#8220;progressive&#8221;/leftist/liberals would make up their minds; either we are all the same and color/gender make no difference, especially in dispensing justice,  or we are all different. I dare them to open the &#8220;were all different&#8221; door, </p>

<p>Great post! 8  &mdash;  All Eyes on Obama&rsquo;s Radical Picks</p>
<p>I feel the same way- THANKFUL!- as I&rsquo;m sure most of the rest of us do.  Everyday that Obama, Holder, Foxman, and Beirich haven&rsquo;t shut down free speech on the Internet, I praise God and read Amren as fast as possible.  We all know what&rsquo;s coming. You better save your favorite posts and burn to a CD that you can hide from Obama&rsquo;s civil service &#8220;inspectors for the public good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right before your eyes- you can&rsquo;t say you didn&rsquo;t see it coming- http://tiny.cc/5ucdt</p>
<p>That knock in the night- http://tiny.cc/43hne</p>
<p>Thanks for your book recommendations, and I was thrilled that I had even read some of them. Will pursue the others.  </p>
<p>Obama and his takeover is no mystery. In fact, it is surprisingly out in the open, which is maybe more terrifying for us than we realize.  His audacity is &#8220;brazen,&#8221; and &#8220;brazen&#8221; in crime reports is always codeword for &#8220;we have reason to believe that these African American youths were armed and would not have hesitated to shoot innocent citizens.&#8221;</p>
<p>Please allow me the privilege of being the first to offer a few book recommendations for the continued elevation of the Amren White Community, in random order:</p>
<p>Morality of Everyday Life, Thomas Fleming<br>
De Oficcis, Cicero (online)<br>
The Laws of Race, Sydney Fisher (find at google books)<br>
Up from Liberalism, Richard Weaver   (http://www.mmisi.org/ma/03_01/weaver.pdf)<br>
The Road to Serfdom, Hayek<br>
Manchurian President, Aaron Klein<br>
The Marketing of Evil, David Kupelian<br>
The Long March, Roger Kimball<br>
The Crisis of Modern World, Rene Guenon<br>
Stonewall Jackson, Alan Tate<br>
The Legacy of the Civil War, Robert Penn Warren</p>
<p>Race Realism is fine, but the Amren Community needs to be fully learned in Reconstruction I (illegal Congressional Reconstruction Acts) and Reconstruction II (illegal SCOTUS Brown v. Board).  Read everything about the great White reaction against these two illegal  horrors of American History. We MUST understand everything that went into the collapse of White Massive Resistance.  That one capitulation and defeat gave our enemies all the hope they needed to keep pushing and pushing toward their soon to come total victory over us. We must know what are our faults that give them so much confidence in victory. Sadly, I don&rsquo;t know what book to recommend that explains it. Who does?</p>
<p> (When Glenn Back gets his sharp Teutonic mind into these precursors   of all the &#8220;Crime, Inc.&#8221;  subjects of his complaining,  maybe he will stop talking about Martin Luther King and the Civil Rights Movement so much.  He&rsquo;s good for us in general, but when he starts on that afro-worship  nonsense, I lose respect for him.)</p>
<p>Essential: The Prostrate State, James Pike <br>
Essential: Sequel to Appomattox, Walter Lynwood Fleming<br>
Essential: The Tragic Era, Claude Bowers<br>
Essential: Reconstruction Trilogy, Thomas Dixon, Jr. </p>
<p>Essential:  You and Segregation, Herman E. Talmadge<br>
Essential: Race and Reason, Carleton Putnam<br>
Essential: Black Monday, Thomas Brady<br>
Essential: The Southern Case Against Desegregation,  Thomas Waring</p>
<p><br>
Do we have any Amreners who attended any of the  &#8221; white flight segregation academies&#8221; that sprang up like flowers of hope across the South after Brown?</p>
<p>I attended one in the Deep South from grammar school through high school graduation.  </p>
<p>Now the editors of the slick, glossy, fancy alumni magazine have a weakness for forcing the Diversity Blacks into nearly every photo.  So, naturally,  I now boycott their fundraising appeals.<br>

		<p>Well we really must do something about the Courts. If the founding fathers made a mistake it was giving the Judicial branch so much lasting power. I realize that thier role has been perverted to subvert the popular will of the electorate but we have to find a way to make the courts more accountable to the will of the people. </p>
<p>My guess is that 2012 will see the end of the 4 year term for President. I predict that if Obama can&rsquo;t win and I don&rsquo;t know if he can or can&rsquo;t then they will manufacture some sort of catastrophe for him to stay in office. The courts will back this situation.</p>
<p>A solution would be to have he judges elected like everyone else. Pool the qualified candidates review their platforms and vote accordingly. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not just the appointment of one person that is the issue.  The real hidden action is who those people hire as staffers, give internships to, promote and bring into the circles of power.</p>
<p>One appinted judge brings in 30-40 of their own people over several years.  Look at some of the big cities and how entire departments of government have become private fiefdoms of one ethnic group or another.</p>
<p>We are the last generation to know what America used to be like.  Our descendants will know America in a vastly different context, until it ultimately fails and breaks up into competing, racially based states.</p>

		<p>When the ruling ethic becomes that ethnic appointments are necessary for proper ethnic representation, then whites must understand that white appointment is necessary for white representation.  Once this sinks in, minorities in the US are in trouble.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;&rsquo;Diversity on the bench helps ensure that the words &lsquo;equal justice under law,&rsquo; inscribed in Vermont marble over the entrance to the Supreme Court, are a reality and that justice is rendered fairly and impartially.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Nonsense.</p>
<p>It seems appointments to the bench are &#8216;diversity&rsquo; driven rather than merit driven.  I cannot imagine non-Whites upholding and respecting White-created laws as these laws were devised by Whites for Whites as a reflection of White DNA, White men and mores.  </p>
<p>If the present regime continues for another term, I suggest Vermont sandblast  &#8216;Equal Justice Under the Law&rsquo; from the marble face of its Supreme Court building and replace it with:  &#8216;Diversity is Strength!&rsquo;  &mdash;  or better &#8216;Ignorance is Strength!&rsquo;</p>
<p>High school history texts teach that The US Constitution was formulated by evil, racist Dead White Males who were slave holders, thus making anything they said, wrote or did irrelevant.  The Constitution itself, according to &#8216;new history&rsquo;, needs to be re-vamped and re-written as it was created over 200 years ago in a country that sanctioned slavery.  The two aspects that need to be &#8216;re-written&rsquo; and &#8216;re-thought&rsquo; in particular are the First and Second Amendments.  </p>
<p>The appointment to SCOTUS of judicial activists such as Kagan and Sotomeyer will get the ball rolling on &#8216;rethinking&rsquo; the US Constitution.</p>
<p>The Great Ideas of White-Created Western Civilization: &#8220;rationalism, self-criticism, the disinterested search for truth, the separation of church and state, the rule of law and equality under the law, freedom of thought and expression, human rights, and liberal democracy &mdash; are superior to any others devised by humankind&hellip;  recognizing and defending the rights of the individual: we are free to think what we want, to read what we want, to practice our religion, to live lives of our choosing&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Or So it Was. </p>
<p>These Great Ideas are being tossed on the dust bin of history, ready to be burned at 451 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>There is no &#8216;equality under the law&rsquo; according to the Obama regime, &#8216;equality under the law&rsquo; is only what the fascist government says it is, and you as a White will sit in judgment before hateful non-Whites who have been conditioned to believe you are the source of all poverty, misery and human suffering.  </p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t be found guilty because you already are guilty!</p>
<p>That is why many of us on this forum believe genocide is what awaits Whites in the future when non-Whites reach numbers sufficient to lord over us.</p>

That&rsquo;s why liberal, populist, Edwards or liberal, first female President,  Hillary didn&rsquo;t represent change.   Obama&rsquo;s skin color is relevant mainly in relation to immigration,  his white colleagues are just as racist against whites as he is,  and if we had the same population that we had in 1960 he&rsquo;d be just another liberal white-hater, subject to change at the next election.   But he represents the successful effort of the elite, who, through undemocratic methods, dissolved the people and elected another,  to paraphrase Brecht.  Long before whites become a minority they&rsquo;ll have to deal with permanent rule by a Leftist/minority coalition that practices blatant racist robbery and oppression against whites, even worse than today.   They&rsquo;ll be no relief from the bench or from juries.   There&rsquo;s going to be a lot of sad faces among the fake conservatives who went along with &#8220;multi-culturalism&#8221;  and helpfully  purged their movement of those who spoke out against the racism of the left.  </p>
