<h1>Police Arrest Civil Rights Leaders After School Board Takeover</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thomas Goldsmith and T. Keung Hui, Raleigh News &amp; Observer, June 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police arrested four civil rights protesters, including state NAACP head Rev. William Barber and author Tim Tyson, after they refused to leave tonight&rsquo;s Wake County school board meeting. The arrests started about an hour-and-a-half after the biracial group disrupted the meeting, speaking and singing to empty seats when the board recessed, then taking over the elective body&rsquo;s own seats.</p>
<p>In addition to Barber and Tyson, author of the personal civil rights history &#8220;Blood Done Sign My Name,&#8221; police arrested civil rights activist Mary Williams, a gospel singer and Wake schools parent who teaches a course with Tyson, and Pullen Memorial Baptist Church minister Nancy Petty. They were taken in handcuffs to the Wake County jail where all four were charged with second degree trespassing and released on a promise to appear in court at various dates next month.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The protest began when Margiotta called a recess of the board and Barber, state leader of the NAACP, objected.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;d like to finish the public comment period at this time,&#8221; Barber said. &#8220;We&rsquo;ve not had an opportunity to speak.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margiotta offered Barber and the others a chance to speak after the recess.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re going to do it now,&#8221; Barber said. &#8220;We are engaging in nonviolent resistance. We will not release the podium.&#8221;</p>
<p>Board members have now come back into session and the leaders are being given a chance to speak. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As Barber, Tyson and other continued their protest, the NAACP&rsquo;s North Carolina chapter issued a statement criticizing the school board&rsquo;s ruling majority decision to &#8220;destroy the socio-economic diversity policy&#8221; of North Carolina&rsquo;s largest school district. Signed by Barber, Tyson, Petty and others, the statement said protesters were prepared to be arrested to defend the legacy of school desegregation efforts of the past and prevent schools from being resegregated.</p>

		<p>I believe that after the civil war, whites gave it a try, and then after dealing with blacks for several decades, pushed segregation&hellip;&hellip;  then the people that don&rsquo;t have to deal with blacks, decided they couldn&rsquo;t be that bad so let&rsquo;s get rid of segregation &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>but we are finding out the hard way, that:</p>
<p>1)  it&rsquo;s never enough, never will be<br>
2)  I&rsquo;m not sure people realize that most blacks hate you and will spend their dying breath letting you know it.<br>
3)  good luck</p>

		<p>Apparently the only qualifications required to qualify as a &#8220;civil rights activist&#8221; are being black and being obnoxious.  Imagine if a group of proWhite protestors had pulled a similar stunt.  Do you think they&rsquo;d be described as &#8220;civil rights activists&#8221; and given a slap on the wrist?</p>

<p>Blacks are mortified and throwing hissy fits because white children have an opportunity to escape from them.</p>
<p>My personal feeling is that blacks really enjoy causing misery to a captive audience of whites.  </p>

		<p>What sort of person is a &#8220;civil rights leader&#8221;?  </p>
<p>Stuart Taylor is a contributing editor for Newsweek, a columnist for National Journal and co-author of Until Proven Innocent: Political Correctness and the Shameful Injustices of the Duke Lacrosse Rape Case. Taylor provides insight into the question I pose   &mdash;  - at least as regards the North Carolina NAACP: </p>
<p>&ldquo;The local NAACP and other local black leaders  &mdash;  enough to be a critical mass  &mdash;  basically crusaded to attack the lacrosse players. They joined the mob. They misrepresented the truth regularly, repeatedly, and grossly. They supported the rogue prosecutor long after he had been proven a rogue prosecutor. They threw away the opportunity to build that cross-racial coalition and they threw away whatever shreds were left of their own credibility.&rdquo; (Taylor in a BookTV.org presentation on Until Proven Innocent, Sept. 11, 2007)<br>

<p> Oh and I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll receive REAL harsh punishment! If they would lock these racist thugs - oops - &#8220;civil rights activists&#8221; up for six months, I bet they&rsquo;d think twice about &#8220;engaging in nonviolent resistance&#8221;.<br>
 This is another example of their sickness. Most blacks hate Whites to their very core, but insist on being around us. Wherever we live, shop, work and go to school, they ALWAYS follow us instead of trying to create their own nice neighborhoods, malls, work places and schools.</p>

		<p>Black &#8220;civil rights leaders&#8221; who insist that black children can&rsquo;t learn unless there are enough white children sitting next to them hold a far more racist view of themselves than do most white separatists.  Also, now that only half the children born in the United States are white, with that proportion diminishing every year, what are they going to do when there aren&rsquo;t enough magic white children to pass around?</p>
<p>Or is their real motivation the realization that if white children are forced into majority black schools their own performance will worsen, both due to the noise, disruption, and threats of violence, and to the dumbed down school curriculum   &mdash;   and that is what they seek, not to raise black children up but to drag white children down.<br>

		<p>I tried to post the following statement in the News and Observer leftist rag paper but they had the comments link blocked - Typical behavior from the cowardly leftist.</p>
<p><br>
What this boils down to is that Petty, Tyson and Barber&hellip; want the Federal Government (and themselves) to run our local school system and Margiotta, Tedesco and the majority of the local citizens of Wake County want the local citizens who were fairly elected to a position on the Wake County School Board to run the local school system. It&rsquo;s really that simple.</p>

<p>I am supposed to be surprised?</p>
<p>I should wakeup every morning, simply mewling and puking out the names: Rev. William Barber and Tim Tyson?</p>
<p>Indeed!</p>
<p>They are doing what they do best, acting like feral animals (what else is expected of Reds) and causing chaos. I should be surprised, but for some reason, I am not. I honestly ask again, why?</p>
<p>Come on, we all know the answers to these questions and problems:</p>

		<p>I once was discussing race issues with a former hospital administrator.  He told me that he built a new hospital in N Fl around 1960.  The hospital had separate bathrooms for whites and blacks in a visitor area.  Within six months, the black restroom was in a shambles.  Originally built to the same specifications and maintained in the same manner as the white restrooms, the black areas had to all but be rebuilt due to the misuse of the facility.  Even the black custodians disliked cleaning their own race&rsquo;s rooms due to the dirt.  This is what it is to have been generous and liberal whites in America.  We now await the end of the death spiral of this once great nation.</p>

<p>Whites are the real slaves and have been for a long time.<br>
Forced to attend failing schools, forced to pay for their<br>

go be by ourselves and testify to the truth as we know it.</p>

		<p>The Fightback!news site refers to &#8220;oppressed nationalities&#8221;.  If some people in NC believe they are a different nationality than American, they should return to their own nations.  <br>
I bet NC public schools are already, for the most part, de-facto segregated.  Most whites live in white enclaves, and most white students attend private schools.  Busing is disruptive and costly and has been shown to be counterproductive to its intentions.  The black &#8220;leaders&#8221; involved here are probably less than intelligent and out for their own gain, as is often the case.</p>

		<p>As usual, blacks totally miss the point about education.  Instead they have some kind of crazy magical thinking that if they only get next to whites, our juju or whatever kind of magic will rub off on them and high grades, high intelligence, and real academic achievement will suddenly appear!  Forget persistence, determination, and hard work!  Believe me, as an college student, I see this nonsense all of the time.</p>
