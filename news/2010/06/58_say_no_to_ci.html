			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rasmussen Reports, June 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Fifty-eight percent (58%) of U.S. voters say a child born to an illegal immigrant in this country should not automatically become a citizen of the United States, according to a new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey.</p>
<p>Thirty-three percent (33%) disagree and say if a women enters the United States as an illegal alien and gives birth to a child here, that child should automatically be a U.S. citizen. That&rsquo;s what the current law allows and many believe it would require a Constitutional Amendment to change the law.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On another aspect of the debate, voters overwhelmingly oppose allowing illegal immigrants to be eligible for state and federal government benefits. Just nine percent (9%) say illegals should receive such benefits, but 85% say they should not.</p>
<p>Most voters believe that the availability of government money and services draws illegal immigrants to the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fifty-two percent (52%) of Democrats think children born to illegal immigrants in this country should automatically become U.S. citizens. Seventy-six percent (76%) of Republicans and 60% of voters not affiliated with either major party disagree.</p>
<p>Most Americans don&rsquo;t believe Mexico wants to stop the illegal flow of its citizens into this country and think America&rsquo;s southern neighbor should be asked to compensate U.S. taxpayers for costs incurred by illegal immigration.</p>
<p>Even as legislators in Washington once again are talking about immigration reform, voters across the nation remain skeptical about the federal government&rsquo;s role in the immigration debate. Three-out-of-four voters believe that the federal government is not doing enough to secure the nation&rsquo;s borders. Fifty-six percent (56%) believe the policies of the federal government actually encourage illegal immigration.</p>
<p>Among voters who are angry about immigration, 83% are angry at the federal government.  Only 12% direct their anger at the immigrants.</p>
<p>Most voters continue to say as they have for years that gaining control of the border is more important than legalizing the status of undocumented workers. In fact, 67% now say military troops should be sent to the Mexican border to prevent illegal immigration.</p>

		<p>Look into the future. </p>
<p>When this whole thing comes crashing down, pain and misery will be widespread across the White population.  The culprits will obviously be non white illegal aliens and their non white anchor babies, and also the indolent, incompetent, and violent blacks who can&rsquo;t sustain anything unless Whites continually give them everything.</p>
<p>What will the suffering White youth think about Diversity after Diversity destroys their futures?</p>
<p>Our greatest hope will be in the  White youth who are taught to make the connection between their suffering and the Kennedy Immigration Act, the illegal aliens who were NOT STOPPED AT THE BORDER, and the White Presidents who allowed the non white invasion, the non white president who actively promoted the non white invasion.  </p>
<p>Once they reach that righteous height of prejudice, they will vote for politicians who will pass laws that retroactively reinterpret the 14th amendment to cancel the citizenship of the non white illegal anchor babies.</p>
<p>Look into the future. That will never happen, because by that time, the politicians will all be owned and controlled by the non white coalitions. </p>
<p>The suffering White youth will just have to keep on suffering.<br/>
 <br/>
 Maybe they will work out their frustrations by guaranteeing that the elites who allowed and profited from the transformation of first world White America in to a third world country will not be allowed to protect themselves from the horrors or enjoy their ill gotten gains.</p>
<p>In our dystopian and darkened  future, poetic justice against White elites may be our only relief and sacrament.<br/>

<p>Lingering White Guilt. How can Whites be outraged that mestizos are coming here, and yet still claim to love mestizos?  Cognitive Dissonance in action.</p>

		<p>The illegals should welcome the fact that their children born here are not U.S. citizens. So when they are deported they can bring their mexican children back to Mexico. No longer will deportation mean families being broken up. Not that there is anything stopping them from bringing their american citizen children back with them to mexico when they get deported. They can even get mexican citizenship for them. Or can they. It seems that mexico might try to deport any children not born on  mexican soil.</p>

Absolutely! Mexico should be presented with a bill for all the services consumed by its illegals here. That would considerably curb Mexico&rsquo;s enthusiasm for dumping its unemployed and uneducated social problems on this side of the border.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there should be a tax imposed on all the remittances being sent out  of this country.</p>

		<p>Odds are the results would have been very similar if the public had been questioned about birth-right citizenship 10 years ago (or 20 years ago&hellip; or 30 years ago&hellip;). But then again, our rulers haven&rsquo;t cared one-iota what their underlings think in regards to immigration policy since at least 1965. But it&rsquo;s high time we began giving them an earful about how we think and made them actually comply with our wishes for once.  </p>

<p>Actually, these children today would have duo citizenship. Under Mexican law, if a child has one parent that is a Mexican citizen at the time of the child&rsquo;s birth, then that child is also considered a Mexican citizen. Mexico does not have BP citizneship, it&rsquo;s by blood. So these parents today can take their duo citizenship children who are also Mexican citizens, back to Mexico.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been saying this for years, that babies born to illegal alien should automatically and permanently be barred from receiving American citizenship, along with their invader parents. Moreover, they should be forced to submit fingerprints and DNA for entry into a database, so if they are caught again sneaking into the U.S., harsh penalties will be imposed. As for Mexico, we should send a message through massing troops, armored vehicles and aircraft along the border to prevent illegal immigration, round up the illegals here, and detain them. Why should children of criminals be rewarded for the the actions of their criminal parents?</p>

		<p>According to Article 30 of the Mexican Constitution, a child born outside of Mexico is a Mexican citizen if one or more of the parents are Mexican.</p>
<p>There is NO REASON to give US citizenship to Mexicans who happen to be born in the USA&hellip;..they are ALREADY and AUTOMATICALLY citizens of Mexico.</p>
<p>Likewise with Americans born outside the USA&hellip;..like John McCain. He was born in the Republic of Panama but was never considered Panamanian. And this also applies to all other US military and naval families, their children born abroad are US citizens&hellip;.by naturalization. Just like John McCain.<br/>

		<p>This whole understanding from the legal perspective of children of illegal aliens being given automatic citizenship if born in the U.S. is based upon an anachronistic Supreme Court decision from the 1870&rsquo;s [?], the precedent of which still stands today.</p>
<p>At the time, is issue was very SMALL conpared to what it is today. The numbers involved in the 1870&rsquo;s were infintesimal compared to what they are now. But the precedent still stands and is not even contested.</p>

		<p>Most of the Problematic Illegal Immigrant Nations Have Blood Citizenship<br/>
	The majority of illegal immigrants that violate the Mexican-US border come from neighboring countries in North and Central America.  Mexico, along with its southern neighbors of Honduras, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Belize, contribute the lion&rsquo;s share of these illegal immigrants.  All of these countries grant national citizenship to children born of at least one citizen parent.  <br/>
	According to the Mexican constitution, &#8220;Mexicans by birth are: I. Those born in the territory of the Republic, regardless of the nationality of their parents.  II. Those born in a foreign country of Mexican parents; of a Mexican father and foreign mother; or of a Mexican mother and an unknown father&#8221; . Thus, a child born to an illegal Mexican immigrant father and mother in the US is already granted Mexican citizenship at birth, and there is no need to provide a gratuitous US citizenship to reward the choice to spawn on US soil.<br/>
	Pursuant to the El Salvadorian constitution, &#8220;Citizens of El Salvador are: 1. Those born in the territory of El Salvador; 2. The children of a Salvadorian father or mother, born on foreign soil&#8221; . <br/>
	The Guatemalan constitution states: &#8220;National origin:  Guatemalans are those that are born in the territory of the Republic of Guatemala, on Guatemalan ships and airplanes, and the children of a Guatemalan father or mother, born on foreign soil&rdquo; . <br/>
	Pursuant to the Honduran constitution, &#8220;Hondurans by birth are: 1. Those born in the national territory, with the exception of the children of diplomatic agents; 2. The foreign-born children of Hondurans fathers or mothers by birth&#8221; .  	<br/>
The constitution of Belize states: &#8220;(3) Every person born outside Belize, before Independence Day, shall become a citizen of Belize on Independence Day if his father or mother becomes, or would have become but for his death or the renunciation of his citizenship, a citizen of Belize by virtue of subsection (1) or (2) of this section [which grants citizenship by birth in Belize]&#8221; .  <br/>
	As made explicitly clear above, children born to illegal immigrant(s) from Belize, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Mexico are all citizens of the respective countries of at least one of the parents.  If the US constitution is amended to create citizenship by blood, rather than by soil, then children born to many illegal immigrants on US soil would not be granted US citizenship.  They would remain citizens of the country from which their mother and/or father left to violate the US border.<br/>

Agreed. Analogously, wasn&rsquo;t north American land &#8216;stolen&rsquo; in some cases at least by European whites ? I say &rsquo; some cases&rsquo; because there could be an argument,a valid one, that not all of the land was inhabited by natives when whites arrived .</p>
<p>In those some cases shouldn&rsquo;t whites evict that land ? Technically speaking i.e. I am not a supporter of illegal immigration but I am just applying your own rule above to another situation of similar nature.</p>
<p>Fundamentally this is not about what&rsquo;s &#8216;stolen&rsquo; and what&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s simply Darwin&rsquo;s principle at work. Struggle for existence and survival of the fittest. </p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>No. You&rsquo;re accepting the canard that it was &#8220;stolen&#8221;.   In most cases it was purchased or acquired by treaty.  </p>
<p>Additionally, much of the land was contested even between tribes and there was no recognized &#8220;owner&#8221; from whom to purchase it.<br/>
When nomadic tribes roamed the landscape, as in much of the West, there was no precise &#8220;owner&#8221; of the land, nor any concept of ownership.  They fought constantly among themselves, and it belonged to whoever was occupying it at the moment.  And that meant whoever was strongest.</p>
<p>By that same standard determining Indian ownership, of who was strongest, whites arrived on the scene and proved to be the strongest of all. So, even when  by conquest, they acquired the land by the Indians&rsquo; own rules  of&hellip; &#8220;to the victor go the spoils&#8221;.</p>
<p>You are right that, at bottom,  it is &#8220;simply Darwin&rsquo;s principle of survival of the fittest.&#8221;  </p>
<p>I could add that the Indians had no laws or legal system codifying any of this &hellip; so among them ownership was determined simply by who was strongest.   We have tried to introduce law and logic in order to establish a more just system extending beyond raw physical strength.</p>

<p>BTW, addressing another comment:  The Constitution NEVER allowed for anchor babies to become citizens.  Some people say that the 14th Amendment (which was never really ratified) says that anchor babies are citizens  &mdash;  but the writers of that amendment specifically stated that it wasn&rsquo;t the case.</p>

<p>Could you please write something about Bolivia? It reminds me a little bit about what happened in Zimbabwe and South Africa: The media is proud about natives &#8220;ruling <b>their</b> country again&#8221; and say how great and tolerant the people are. Then the none-whites start to fight the whites and the media is totally silence for 10 years. And then they start to talk about the problems there, like there was no good white time before. Like they have absolutely no idea about what exactly happened in the last 10 years they report how bad the poor people are living.</p>
<p>Here you can see lynch mob Indians which now are allowed to take justice in their own care because of their traditions:<br/>
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/3x978jm" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/3x978jm</a><br/>
And here is a report about the new ongoing civil war between rich Whites and poor Indians who want the money of Whitey:<br/>
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/4lbchw" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/4lbchw</a><br/>
And in very short time we will read and see how poor this country is (getting), and how evil white man not allows the poor Indians to get into his areas. There will be refugees from Bolivia in a few years.<br/>
What can we do? Well Amren could say it. Write about it. So people will remind themselves that Amren exactly said this would happen 5 years before. They will see the process and then they will start to think. We are now at a very fascinating point: The whites are thinking about race more than 20 years ago. They are getting more race-realistic as you can see on most youtube videos and forums. And on the other hand, whites are so much that they can influence the process and stop it -not as in Zimbabwe where it is to late now. That can happen to America and Boliviea too:http://tinyurl.com/39rgzed<br/>

		<p>If you just check the constitution, it states, &#8220;Under the jurisdiction&#8221;  Illegals are not under the jurisdiction, thus their off spring are not automatically US citizens.  As usual, the liberal courts in this country have interpreted it wrong.  They aren&rsquo;t citizens and should be deported with the parents.  But don&rsquo;t take my word for it, read the Constitution, specifically the citizenship clause.</p>

<p>They have pushed Americans as far as we will be pushed.  </p>
<p>I do not relish the thought of neutralizing Mexicans one family at time, but it is preferable to the alternative.  </p>
<p>The alternative is to do nothing and let them take our country away from us right under our noses.  </p>
<p>Whites carved this nation out of a wilderness.   </p>
<p>The rightful owners of America are our progeny, not the progeny of Mexican invaders.  </p>
<p>Mexicans can have our country when they pry it from our cold dead hands.  </p>
<p>However, as a firm believer in the preemptive strike I don&rsquo;t intend to give them that opportunity…</p>

<p>There is no &#8216;analogous&rsquo; connection because American land was not &#8216;stolen&rsquo; from mexico.</p>
<p>Once again:   Mexico fought and lost a war.  It signed a treaty and accepted money from the U.S.  Nowhere is it stated that Mexicans have the right to enter the US illegally because of perceived violations of a treaty signed 152 years ago.</p>
<p>This is the 21st century and the &#8216;stolen&rsquo; land justification put out by illegal colonists and their supporters in the US and mexican governments does not defend or excuse dirt-poor illegal parasites colonizing US lands demanding that White American citizens support them and their children.</p>
<p>Mexicans and other dirt poor denizens of the Third and Fourth world hell-holes that their own people created as an image of themselves come here for one reason: Free White Money.</p>
<p>Those in power allow and even encourage illegal mexican colonization because their ultimate goal is to make Whites a minority in their homelands.  Mexicans and blacks are merely pawns being used by the hostile elites that control the government and media in their larger ongoing War Against Whites.</p>

<p>If so, then anyone who lives here who makes that argument should return to their ancestors&rsquo; lands from North America. That is, if they want to be intellectually consistent. Someone who thinks this land was &#8220;stolen&#8221; from the Indians but continues to live here is a hypocrite.</p>

Indeed they are.  That fact cannot possibly be reiterated enough in response to those here who rail constantly against Mexicans and blacks. They are attacking the leaves of the weed and ignoring the roots.  They must be made aware that this is a wider, far more complex war that&rsquo;s being conducted against us,  sub rosa, and that blacks and Mexicans don&rsquo;t even realize how they are being used to batter down white society. Naturally, those blacks and &#8220;Latinos&#8221; think this is all about them.  But it is not! They are just incidentals in the larger picture.  Bit players! We must not be fooled. If there were no blacks or Mexicans here, someone else would have to be imported to do the job of diluting us and weakening us. Nothing would really change, because this is NOT fundamentally about them.</p>

		<p>Illegal immigrants and their anchor babies have no intentions of leaving. The US must take action to secure our borders and begin removing these law breakers as Eisenhower did in the 50s. Mexican comedian Jorge Lopez makes a clear public announcement on youtube:<br/>

		<p>America has always needed and used cheap labor to undercut the competition. In the early years of this country, newcomers from England provided bonded labor for a certain period of time to repay their sponsor for the cost of their passage from England to America. When this did not work out, due to the laborers running away and fitting in with the rest of society, they were replaced with African slaves, which lasted for over 100 years. Later on, freed Black sharecroppers and Mexicans who freely crossed the border for work provided sources of cheap labor for farmers. However, when the ecomomy goes downhill, like it did in the great depression, the Mexicans were deported back to Mexico and we are in the same situation again. However, this time the Mexicans brought their families and had children in this country instead of just working and going back to Mexico like was done in the past. Now these groups which include undocumented students demanding passage of the Dream Act and undocumented immigrants demanding reform and rights. The mistake of giving amnesty in 1986 to some illegals tends to provide hope that the rest of them will get it as well and all it will do is to encourage more to cross the border illegally. I once read where some border crossers actually believe that they can legalize their status after living illegally in the US for one year. This is of course, not true.</p>
