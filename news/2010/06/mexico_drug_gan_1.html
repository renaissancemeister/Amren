<h1>Mexico Drug Gang Threatens Arizona Police</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reuters, June 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police in an Arizona border city are on heightened alert after receiving a warning from a Mexican drug cartel that officers may be targeted if they carry out off-duty drug busts, authorities said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Nogales Police Chief Jeff Kirkham said the department received the threat through an informant after two off-duty policemen seized 400 pounds (182 kg) of marijuana while horseback riding outside the city in early June.</p>
<p>&#8220;The warning was .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that the officers, if they are off duty, are to look the other way and ignore any drug trafficking loads that are coming across the border, otherwise they will be targeted,&#8221; Kirkham told Reuters.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kirkham said he took the threats against Nogales police &#8220;very seriously.&#8221; He said he had asked the Border Patrol for additional support, and had ordered officers to carry communications equipment and guns at all times.</p>

		<p>I seriously doubt the cartels will target US officials as they have Mexican authorities.  </p>
<p>Some are saying as the border is getting better protected, more drugs are being seized and the cartels are running out of routes they can use to transition narcotics to US points of disbursements, so they will rachet up the violence as in Mexico to force US law enforcement to back off.</p>
<p>If they do that the community organizer will be forced to send the military to the border, plus additional security measures, and the cartels will get even less through.  They know that, so I doubt there will be assassinations on the US side.</p>
<p>The community organizer wants a vigorous inflow of Mexicans in order to water down the white power structure, so I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s hoping there&rsquo;s not an acceleration in killings.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m wrong and it comes to assassinations, we know one thing for certain, this corrupt community organizer will drag his feet, make excuses and do as little as he can get away with for as long as he can.  One of the basic schemes of his plan to rob whites and enrich and empower non-whites, especially blacks, must included unchecked immigration.  </p>
<p>More drug violence on the US side&hellip;if it occurs&hellip;. is going to put a crimp in the Obamanation&rsquo;s schemes.</p>
<p>This country is deteriorating rapidly.  Causing it to increase by shutting down drilling in the Gulf, so more workers will be out of work, tells many of us that this man really does think he can remold the US if he can destroy it first.</p>
<p>Personally, I think forces are in play right now for a second civil war, but it will come in bits and pieces&hellip;starting in the Southwest&hellip;.. and not all at once.</p>
<p>We will be forewarned more clearly of what is to occur before this year is out.</p>

		<p>  Predominately Hispanic immigrant areas are fair game for the drug cartels. If the Mexican government can&rsquo;t control them, they will soon be powerful enough to set up shop in &#8220;El Norte.&#8221; I expect a rash of kidnappings, public intimidation, and murders on this side of the border. While we are worried about Middle Eastern terrorists, some Southwestern cities will experience a reign of terror instituted by the drug cartels. Of course, our controlled media will ignore this trend as long as possible. <br>
No Country for Old (white) Men will turn out to be prophetic. </p>

		<p>Anything worth billions is going to be &#8216;regulated&rsquo; with some white&rsquo;s hand in the till at virtually every level.</p>
<p>I personally believe that there is an undertable, pre-NAU, functional agreement going to &#8216;prepare both sides for the merger&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And so certain &#8216;agreed upon&rsquo; levels of sustained immigration and drug smuggling are maintained to keep the economic wheels of this farce greased.</p>
<p>Doing things like closing off 80 miles of the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge to _American_ tourists is thus an easy way to remove any surveillance of the area.  And create the equivalent of a &#8216;free trade corridor&rsquo; through which a public crackdown on drugs and immigration can be compensated for with a massive, free flowing, secondary route.  </p>
<p>Out of the public view.</p>
<p>The degree of corruption this nation faces is beyond common knowledge and it is proliferated through all levels of government, including law enforcement.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, look at this statement-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Kirkham said he took the threats against Nogales police &#8220;very seriously.&#8221;  He said he had asked the Border Patrol for additional support, and had ordered officers to carry communications equipment and guns at all times.<br>

<p>IMO, this is just a way to magnify the tension as hype yet truly mean nothing.  Doesn&rsquo;t everyone have a cellphone these days?  Certainly a microwave linked walkie talkie does you no good without the patrol car to rebro the signal.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t all cops carry off duty weapons as a part of their job requirements to intervene in ANY illegal action, in uniform or out?</p>
<p>So what has this Sheriff done if not tell his deputies to act as they always do anyway.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, if a Mexican gang decided to kill a cop as he left his front door in the morning or as the cop and his family slept in their beds at night.  With the kinds of (grenades and automatic weapons plus practice) capabilities they have, would this officer be able to do anything to stop it?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Thus the real answer to all this is that there is no actual threat because there is no real heady bounty.  And won&rsquo;t be, so long as business as usual is preserved.</p>
<p>Wait a few weeks and find your local weeder and or dopehead friend and ask him if the price on his product has changed.  When he tells you no, start to think outside the box about why.</p>

		<p>I doubt they&rsquo;re actually going to shoot off-duty cops for making drug busts.  These creatures are running drugs to make money, and this is best achieved by staying under law-enforcement&rsquo;s radar.  No act could be better designed to attract a lot of attention the narco-traffickers DON&rsquo;T want than an &#8220;open season&#8221; on US cops.  Of course, my statement here assumes a level of intelligence on the part of the narcos that they may not actually possess, so who knows?</p>
