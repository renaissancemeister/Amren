			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Innocent Madawo, Toronto Sun, June 6, 210</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>This is Africa&rsquo;s decade.</p>
<p>The decade when the continent&rsquo;s potential will be recognized and rewarded.</p>
<p>True, that statement is reminiscent of former prime minister Wilfrid Laurier saying the 20th century would belong to Canada (or, more specifically, that Canada would fill the 20th century).</p>
<p>But all the stars are aligned for Africa&rsquo;s coming out party, kicking off next week with the biggest of all parties, soccer&rsquo;s World Cup.</p>
<p>For centuries, Africa has struggled to shake off the loathsome &#8220;Dark Continent&#8221; status of victimhood due to slavery, famine, disease and self-destruction through endless wars.</p>
<p>This negativity is bolstered by a continuous stream of media images of starving babies, people dying of AIDS, political persecution and more.</p>
<p>The World Cup is a sporting extravaganza that also guarantees the media spotlight, but the focus this time will be on what Africa has never been allowed to display  &mdash;  its innovative and playful side.</p>
<p>Not only will we see enthusiastic fans blowing vuvuzelas and playing drums in the stands or singing and dancing in cultural ensembles, we&rsquo;ll see African kids wearing Lionel Messi shirts and mimicking Ronaldo.</p>
<p>The point is, South Africans (and millions of other Africans) will portray an Africa that is content, sophisticated and  &mdash;  most importantly  &mdash;  has great potential.</p>
<p><b>Frontier of innovation</b></p>
<p>Earlier this year, the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) declared Africa a new frontier of innovation, boasting a reservoir of young talent, a growing market for cutting-edge technologies, and a source of fresh ideas.</p>
<p>Anybody heard of Maasai cattlemen who trade their stocks on cellphones from deep in the country?</p>
<p>This is why the significance of the World Cup goes beyond South Africa&rsquo;s capability to host it.</p>
<p>It is a litmus test for the continent&rsquo;s capacity and ability to carry the heavy loads of global business and politics.</p>
<p>Africans want to display their readiness to be engaged as equals in investment and trade. They want a seat at the world affairs table and a right to lead in other important global issues.</p>
<p>In terms of play, Africa wants to ensure it gets another chance to host another major cultural or sporting event like the Olympics, in the not too distant future.</p>
<p>Of course, there is no guarantee the world&rsquo;s view of Africa will suddenly change because the continent is hosting the World Cup.</p>
<p>However, success in this respect will earn Africa a right to pose singer Adam Lambert&rsquo;s question: &#8220;What do you want from me?&#8221;</p>
<p>If Africa can be entrusted, for a full month, with billions (if not trillions) of dollars worth of investment in the world&rsquo;s biggest sporting event, and handle it successfully, why can&rsquo;t it be trusted with protecting lesser forms of investment, or making key decisions on world affairs?</p>
<p><b>Lasting significance</b></p>
<p>This is the significance of the World Cup  &mdash;  beyond the last match on July 11.</p>
<p>However, there is a flip side. What if Africa&rsquo;s perceived ineptitude manifests itself through, say, inadequate security for the teams, such as the ambush of the Togolese team in Angola in January?</p>
<p>Something like that would not only mar the World Cup, but embolden the prevailing view that Africa is not prepared for responsibility.</p>
<p>A forgettable World Cup could dump Africa back into the dark recesses of world perception. The light might not return for a long time.</p>
<p>One hopes those in charge know they hold the destiny of a continent in their hands and the slightest slip-up could mean the difference between a decade when Africa claims its rightful position in world affairs and one where it regresses.</p>
<p>That said, the challenge is also upon the rest of the world to see beyond football and discover the real Africa.<br>

		<p>Does anyone remember President Thabo Mbeki&rsquo;s promise of an African Renaissance. Did it happen. Don&rsquo;t remember seeing anything other than the killing of farmers &amp; emigrants.  Any inventions or remarkable art / literature, science discoveries,<br>
medical advancements&hellip;.no!!</p>
<p>I think the Renaissance should happen before the party, similar to having the horse before the cart &amp; not the other way round.</p>
<p>I guess parties are easier than all the work required for achievement &amp; Renaissance. Oh by the way it also requires quite a high IQ.  Oh well&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;!</p>

		<p>Will the media cover up the on-going, for over 40 years now, cultural and physical genocide of white Africans?  One country by one, the whites have been driven from their homes and farms (if they&rsquo;re lucky), their lands and good stolen, and their native lands left poorer as a result.  E.g., Angola, Rhodesia, Mozambique, Zambia, etc., etc.  In South Africa right now there is wholesale slaughter of whites; will that be mentioned by the press?  Will the South Africa World Cup be like the 1936 Berlin Olympics, only not as well run, where the open discrimination and race hatred of the majority is ignored by the world press and media? Will the complete degradation of the major cities of South Africa since the ANC took over be noted, and criticized?  I doubt it.  Africa will continue to be held to an abysmally low standard of civilized behavior, and the rest of the world will be expected to continue to be its sustenance and support.</p>

		<p>This guy actually thinks a soccer tournament will enable the entire continent of Africa to uplift itself? I read the accompanying posts with amusement - all but one share my sentiments.</p>
<p>Mexico was host of the 1970 and 1986 World Cups - I don&rsquo;t think it has uplifted that country. However, Mexico does have a rich soccer tradition.</p>
<p>Japan and South Korea co-hosted the 2002 World Cup. Neither country has a strong soccer tradition, but they are two of the most economically advanced nations in Asia. Besides an Asian nation had never hosted the World Cup.</p>
<p>All of the other nations that have hosted the World Cup - from Uruguay in 1930, since - have either rich soccer traditions, or are economically advanced, or both.</p>
<p>Now we come to the new South Africa, which has neither a rich soccer tradition or is economically advanced -except in comparison to the other sub-Saharan African states. I think that the main reason they gave the 2010 World Cup to South Africa is so they can claim &#8220;multiculturalism works&#8221;, and &#8220;diversity is beautiful&#8221;. The Obama regime is going to milk this for all it can.</p>
<p>I just pray for the safety of all foreign visitors to the new South Africa, especially the Caucasians. If they think South Africa is like the old &#8220;Daktari&#8221; television show, they&rsquo;re sadly mistaken.</p>
<p>We shall see what we shall see. But the ANC will determine much of what we will see, I have the feeling.   </p>

		<p>If this is supposed to be Africa&rsquo;s century, then why are black Africans deserting the continent whenever they get the chance? Why do Somalis prefer Maine and England and Minneapolis over Africa? Why do the Sudanese head up to Alaska, which is about as far away from their homeland as you can get? Why do no whites (or black Americans) want to move to Africa? That&rsquo;s easy to answer - because Africa is the worst continent on the globe on account of Africans. So it&rsquo;s ludicrous to suggest that this is Africa&rsquo;s century. And as a Canadian, I say that the last century did not belong to Canada - the United States was definitely more prominent.</p>

		<p>The Toronto Sun can sit there and gush all day long about Africa&rsquo;s potential and that this is their decade. Something tells me that the World Cup is not going to be the spark that lights the economic fire of success. Even the most well built infrastructures in white countries will start to fall apart after years of neglect and mismanagement. Will you see full stadiums and cheering crowds on TV, sure you will. How many of those people received free (or reduced price) tickets and free rides there? Unlike Ray Nagin, the SA officials will make good use of their buses.  </p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if there are blogs in most countries around the world warning people of what is very likely to happen to them should they attend this event. Even if you spent $3000 on the most gold-plated pay per view or whatever is available in your home country, this is peanuts compared to the horror show of being there. Chris Rock did this bit one one of his specials (cleaned up for this site). &#8220;Black People are always complaining that &#8220;it&rsquo;s the media, the media makes us look so bad&#8221;. SHUT UP! Ted Koppel never stole anything from me. You know who has.&#8221; </p>

<p>Africa&rsquo;s playful side: Doing drugs, looting after a disaster, raping helpless women. Africa is a very playful continent indeed.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;This is Africa&rsquo;s decade&#8221;. Yeah right - pull the other one. The whites of South Africa had over 300 years of rule and they couldn&rsquo;t even drag the blacks into the 21st Century. Do they honestly think that a soccer tournament is going to magically  transform not only South AFrica but the rest of that hell hole continent? I had 37 years in Africa and I never want to see it again. Been there, got the T-shirt and a wake up call&hellip;</p>

		<p>The real SA is a place of inconceivable murder and rape statistics, where the president is a Zulu king with several wives and the health minister a magical thinker who declares tap water will cure AIDS.  The vast lower classes stay stoned on hooch, glue, and fermented sewage.  The power grid constantly fails because thieves steal its copper in broad daylight.  The urban middle and upper classes live in walled compounds, and life in rural areas is as dangerous as Apache territory.<br>
It will be interesting to see whether the MSM can continue their coverup throughout the festivities. </p>

		<p>Interesting how this black African &#8220;writer&#8221; views hosting the World Cup as an African &#8220;achievement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Africa, since the effective dispossession of the European whites who created modern civilized Africa, has quickly reverted to primitive barbarism.  In another couple of decades there will be nothing left of the Africa of the Sixties and Seventies.  The cities will have crumbled, the plains game will have been exterminated by blacks armed with guns as opposed to spears, and the remaining inhabitants reduced to starving, disease-ridden vagabonds.</p>
<p>China, by then the world&rsquo;s leading power, likely will gradually take control of the African continent.  What they do with the remaining inhabitants is anybody&rsquo;s guess, though it would seem doubtful that they&rsquo;ll see any value in maintaining their presence, even as slave laborers.</p>
<p>There are other groups who have no place in the modern world, groups such as the aborigines of Australia and the Eskimos of North America.  These groups, however, are not occupying millions of square miles of minerally and agriculturally rich prime real estate.  The black Africans are.  </p>

<p>What they mean to say is WHITE Africa&rsquo;s innovative side. The World Cup being held in South Africa, the land being developed by white capitalists, farmed by white farm owners, the cities designed and developed by white engineers and architects. A lot of black African labor used but the innovation was from WHITES. South Africa is hardly representative of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

		<p>South Africa is indeed impressive compared to other countries in Africa, but it is subpar when it is compared to other white countries (in Europe and the US). So this crowning glory for Africa is not so great when held to the standards of the rest of the civilized world. </p>

		<p>Honestly it is hard to fathom that whites would be so stupid that they would travel there.  Like others who have commented I will pray for their safety.  The media will probably be able to keep the media coverage of any violent incidents low,  just as they do not report much on the crime that already happens in South Africa.  </p>
