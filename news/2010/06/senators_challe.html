			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>NumbersUSA, June 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Several Senators have learned of a possible plan by the Obama Administration that would provide a mass Amnesty for the nation&rsquo;s 11-18 million illegal aliens. Led by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), eight Senators addressed a letter to the President asking for answers to questions about a plan that would allow DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano to provide an amnesty if they can&rsquo;t secure enough votes for a bill in the Senate.</p>
<p>The letter that was sent to Pres. Obama earlier today asks the President for clarification on the use of deferred action or parole for illegal aliens. The executive actions are typically used in special cases and are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, but if 60 votes can&rsquo;t be secured in the Senate to pass a mass Amnesty, the Administration may use the discretionary actions as an alternative.</p>
<p>Here is the text of the letter signed by Sens. Grassley, Hatch (R-Utah), Vitter (R-La.), Bunning (R-Ky.), Chambliss (R-Ga.), Isakson (R-Ga.), Inhofe (R-Okla.), and Cochran (R-Miss.).<blockquote>Dear President Obama:</p>
<p>We understand that there&rsquo;s a push for your Administration to develop a plan to unilaterally extend either deferred action or parole to millions of illegal aliens in the United States. We understand that the Administration may include aliens who have willfully overstayed their visas or filed for benefits knowing that they will not be eligible for a status for years to come. We understand that deferred action and parole are discretionary actions reserved for individual cases that present unusual, emergent or humanitarian circumstances. Deferred action and parole were not intended to be used to confer a status or offer protection to large groups of illegal aliens, even if the agency claims that they look at each case on a &#8220;case-by-case&#8221; basis.</p>
<p>While we agree our immigration laws need to be fixed, we are deeply concerned about the potential expansion of deferred action or parole for a large illegal alien population. While deferred action and parole are Executive Branch authorities, they should not be used to circumvent Congress&rsquo; constitutional authority to legislate immigration policy, particularly as it relates to the illegal population in the United States.</p>
<p>The Administration would be wise to abandon any plans for deferred action or parole for the illegal population. Such a move would further erode the American public&rsquo;s confidence in the federal government and its commitment to securing the borders and enforcing the laws already on the books.</p>
<p>We would appreciate receiving a commitment that the Administration has no plans to use either authority to change the current position of a large group of illegal aliens already in the United States, and ask that you respond to us about this matter as soon as possible.<br>

		<p>If Obama grants &#8220;parole&#8221; to these illegals by EO, would this auto-magically make them all citizens who are eligible to vote?  Or would it merely mean they would still be &#8220;illegal aliens&#8221; as a technicality, but just not face any criminal penalties for being here illegally?</p>

		<p>The message that Obama is sending us is that no one really needs to obey the law.  If you can &#8220;obtain a better life&#8221; by breaking the law, then not only is that OK, but the USA government will actually reward you for that action.  </p>
<p>Obama is saying that you are a fool if you obey the law.</p>
<p>I am sure that all AmRen readers, like I, feel that this is wrong.  Both American citizens, and even foreigners need to always obey the laws of America.</p>

		<p>If Obama is so stupid to try this, he&rsquo;d better prepare for a backlash that this country hasn&rsquo;t seen for over a century. White Americans are already in the midst of an awakening and if the Obamunist thinks that throwing cold water in our faces won&rsquo;t lead to dramatic consequences then he is truly deluded and detached from reality. My blood boils at the very idea that he&rsquo;s even considered usurping the power of the people this way. Using his executive power to grant amnesty to millions of invaders will tear apart this country in a way that I fear will be irreparable.</p>

<p>Well, that is the most interesting paragraph in the letter; that is because, if the Republicans really do intend to make good on it, they would have an easy time of it.</p>
<p>History shows they won&rsquo;t, unfortunately, particularly if they control the legislative branch after the elections this November.</p>
<p>Too much inter and intra whoring, on all sides for that!</p>
<p>The sad state of affairs being, that the Republicans had this General Secretary Obamanation on the ropes from the start, and what did they do? Nothing, is the answer to that question!</p>
<p>Adolf Hillary was, sadly just more of the same.</p>
<p>They cannot bring themselves to bring this guy down, because they fear the nonwhite &ldquo;backlash&rdquo; to come if they do so; along with, the much needed obliteration of multiculturalism that would logically result as well. They are hard pressed and contrite, for even having to call them illegal aliens, and not the &ldquo;undocumented.&rdquo; </p>
<p>They could if they wanted to, legally halt the intended violations of the US Constitution via these &ldquo;executive orders,&rdquo; as are clearly presented by Comrade BO. The intent to allow an invasion of this country by criminal marauders to be rewarded and encouraged for new incoming alien interlopers, is openly and threateningly admitted. What more is needed to bring impeachment and treason charges against the &ldquo;savior,&rdquo; other than the above?</p>
<p>That would be the classical manly and sanity triad, that is now so lacking in the USA: Brains, Guts, and Balls!</p>
<p>Need I say more, as to why this will not happen?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

Obama needs to be held responsible for his actions; he cannot continue to push his policy against the will of the American people.  Amnesty is outrageous&hellip;read Tom Chittum&rsquo;s &#8220;Civil War II: The Coming breakup of America.&#8221;  Who do you think the illegals are going to vote for, once they&rsquo;ve got the opportunity?

		<p>Such an act would leave absolutely no doubt in any person in the US, that the federal government has turned rogue.  The very next day, our military would stop recognizing the federal government.  The very next day, the vast majority of the states would break away and form a new government.

		<p>The North American Union is going to happen whether we like it or not.  If McCain were in the White House, he&rsquo;d be threatening the same edict.  Both parties are in on this sham.   They&rsquo;re gauging to see if the anger would be severe enough to cause serious public strife.   They may back down on this if they fear a virtual or real civil war would break out.  But, then again, Obama is incredibly obtuse, and really doesn&rsquo;t give a hoot what the average American thinks or values.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s like every week Obama does or wants to do something that usually upsets and/or scares the hell out of us. Because of him, we are slowly turning into a freaky sideshow for the rest of the world to mock at. I tell you something ain&rsquo;t right with this guy. Of all that&rsquo;s been said, I must add: He&rsquo;s like a runaway train without an engineer and with no hope of stopping. Nothing seems to keep him down for long. The man&rsquo;s ineptness and recklessness is blatant, and the public is finally recognizing this. Is he or is he not acting increasingly like a tyrant? Impeachment should no longer be in the whispers or speculation.</p>

		<p>RINO GOP Knife In Our White Back Alert!</p>
<p>My gut instincts and deep cynicism suggests to me that RINOS and DemonRats got together with this Communist in secret, and they cooked up this idea.   Zero support for it to pass, and the last time they tried it - we remember what happened, right?  But, doing it this way, our ineligbile illegal alien - who is a one term clown for sure - can ram this through via E.O. (which is illegal and unconstitutional, since E.O.&rsquo;s are supposed to only affect &#8216;administrative&rsquo; related issues pertaining to the operation of the Rat House and not be a means of enacting laws or forcing legislation upon the citizens) and neither party has to go on record as having voted for it.   The R&rsquo;s who are kicking up a fuss about this issue right now are all following a fake script.   Face facts: they are all globalists and just as anti-white and obsessed with destroying White Western civilization as the Ds are - but they have to &#8216;pretend&rsquo; to be concerned about their base.    </p>
<p>Let me say that I&rsquo;ve been watching this criminal trend by both Rs and Ds, whichever mainstream party happens to control the presidency, for almost 2 decades - whereby they issue &#8216;executive orders&rsquo; as a means of enacting laws or regulations or proclamations that stand zero chance of getting through Congress, either due to lack of sufficient support, or due to the controversial and radioactive aroma of them.  Congress, according to the law, has 30 days to vote to overturn and repeal executive orders if they deem them to be an encroachment on their legislative authority or harmful to the interests of their constituents - who&rsquo;s interests these rats are SUPPOSED to be looking to safeguard. </p>
<p>When was the last time anyone ever heard of ANY E.O. being swatted back in the face of the dictator who stoked it?   I can&rsquo;t think of a single instance of this happening.  </p>
<p>What we have here, fellow AR readers - is a federal government that has become increasingly staffed with tyrannical minded control freaks.   Psychopaths - who not only sneer at the rule of law and who harbor nothing but contempt for the Constitution and Bill of Rights - but, these arrogant elitists also harbor contempt for the very people who pay their salaries and who&rsquo;s liberties they are supposed to be bound to protect.  </p>
<p>And, who&rsquo;s fault is that?  Well, it is obvious that our system of government - a Constitutional Representative Republic, NOT a &#8216;democracy&rsquo;,  Hillary-girl - requires an educated and informed citizenry.  We lost that long ago, and addictions to TV sports and to Oprah probably a role in distracting the citizens from what was going on inside the beltway.  But, continuing to put these same incumbents back into office, over and over and over, and being too stinking lazy to keep a sharp eye on these criminals and watching for any signs of disobedience to the rule of law or any signs of disobedience to the Constitution or a lack of commitment to our Bill of Rights - this failure on the part of the citizens of this nation has allowed these tyrants to rise to the top of this dung heap of a once great nation.</p>
<p>Like a writer named Alexander Massa said the other day, in his excellent article titled:  &#8220;An Epidemic of Terminal Ignorance&#8221;:  &#8220;..it is the growing mass of ignorant individuals, and the overall ignorance of the populace, which are destroying our sacred Republic. The more stupid the population gets, the more ignorant the populace becomes, the more powerful our shady overlords become – and the men pulling the strings behind the grand curtain just laugh in amusement.</p>
<p>Yet, instead of rebelling against the chains that bind us, the American people seem more than willing to oblige their masters, and indeed, exceed their expectations as far as general idiocy and general compliance and submission are concerned. &#8220;</p>
<p>Great analysis, Mr. Massa.   I couldn&rsquo;t have said it better myself.</p>

		<p>Let us assume Obama did pardon or parole millions of illegal aliens for breaking the law and illegally entering the US.  Although they could no longer be prosecuted for the crime of illegal entry that would not automatically make them citizens and they would still be subject to deportation. On the other hand if Obama changed the rules for becoming a citizen by executive order we have to consider the constitutional dimension of an executive order.  Basically such orders are presumed constituional as a part of the Presidents inherent executive power to fill in the gaps to administer and execute laws that are already in effect. To my mind this is so overreaching as to actually negate laws that Congress has already passed and would be struck down by the Courts.</p>

		<p>This is just the latest example of Obama dangling a carrot before a particular group to try to keep its support.  He had many gays believing that don&rsquo;t-ask-don&rsquo;t-tell would be repealed within days, allowing boa-bedecked flamers to sign up within the week.  And, of course, the Republicans want to make hay with his empty promises, knowing that neither Obama nor most Congress members want to really do anything about it.<br>
If this blanket amnesty were actually instituted, millions more would pour across the borders to take advantage of it.  If the amnesty order provided for proof of sustained residence or anything else, it would take years for all the paperwork to be processed, so it would amount to a law without much force.  It would be just like the proposed laws that would require fines and other fees, English proficiency, etc.  Basically, the lawless ignore laws.</p>

		<p>It is Congress&rsquo;s and only Congress&rsquo;s purview on who becomes new citizens and how they become citizens (&#8220;uniform..naturalization,&#8221; Art I Sec 8).  If Obama &#8220;paroles&#8221; them or &#8220;pardons&#8221; them for violating immigration law, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that they&rsquo;re still not here illegally, because Congress hasn&rsquo;t changed the immigration law.  It would be a huge pandering puff to the Mecha/Maldef/Raza kooks and existing Hispanic voters.</p>

		<p>Amnesty would be a travesty. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if the congress passes it in the usual way or if Obama uses an executive order, and it doesn&rsquo;t matter what they call it. &#8220;Deferred action.&#8221; &#8220;Parole.&#8221; They all amount to the same thing.</p>
<p>Having said that, I don&rsquo;t think that amnesty would make any real difference at this point. After all, these &#8220;illegals&#8221; are already living here relatively unmolested and more of them are crossing the border every day. They&rsquo;re getting welfare, free education, free medical treatment, in-state tuition in several places, etc., etc. As a practical matter, they&rsquo;ve already received amnesty by default.</p>
<p>Neither party has any intention of protecting the border or enforcing the immigration laws. This should be blindingly obvious by now. The Republicans are just playing politics here. If they got into power, they&rsquo;d just go back to business as usual. The word &#8220;amnesty&#8221; is a lightning rod, so they&rsquo;ll just avoid using it. That&rsquo;s all. They&rsquo;ll make the usual token gestures at border security: building a section of a fence here, raiding a meat-packing plant there. None of it will mean anything at all.</p>
<p>Enforcing the borders would be a move in the right direction, but any policy that leaves the illegals here would just be another form of amnesty. The real issue here has nothing to do with the law  &mdash;  whether someone is here &#8220;legally&#8221; or not. I&rsquo;m not against illegal immigration because it&rsquo;s illegal. If the illegals were white Britons or Norwegians or whatever, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind it at all. I&rsquo;m against it because we are being invaded by an alien culture which is turning us into a third-world country.</p>

		<p>23 Seek:</p>
<p>Maybe not.  Look at what the state&rsquo;s Republican voters (almost entirely white) did yesterday:</p>
<p>1.  They picked an Indian woman (Nimrata Randhawa, aka Nikki Haley) who has a thin legislative record and really no record on immigration issues, just promises, over an established U.S. House member (Gresham Barrett) who has an A+ lifetime rating from Numbers USA (I know, they&rsquo;re flimsy on the legal immig issue, and not perfect, but still useful), for Governor.  This probably means that the Deep South will have two Indian Governors come January.</p>
<p>2.  They picked a black man (last name Scott) for U.S. House District 1 (Coastal regions), over the son of a state political legend, by more than a 2-1 margin.  Incidentally, Scott wanted to run for Lieutenant Governor, but picked SC-1 on a last minute basis because the long time incumbent in SC-1 retired.  Scott will face another black man, Ben Frasier, who like Alvin Greene, &#8220;shockingly&#8221; won the Democrat primary, but it&rsquo;s not a shock to me.  Frasier is one of these perennial candidate types.  Either way, SC-1 will have a black Congressman.</p>
<p>Now, on an issue by issue basis, I&rsquo;m probably in majority agreement with Miss Randhawa and Mr. Scott.  But I just don&rsquo;t like the implications of our self-imposed racial dispossession from a political party that gets almost every vote it gets from whites. </p>

		<p>Who do you think the illegals are going to vote for, once they&rsquo;ve got the opportunity? You bet they&rsquo;ll be thanking the legislators </p>
<p>Perhaps they will be thanking the legislators BUT!! only until the ILLEGAL ALIENS have enough voting power to vote THEMSELVES into office and to hell with the whites who helped them. I say, it would be what the white politicos deserved until we conclude the &#8220;final solution&#8221; to these traitors.</p>
