<h1><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2010-06-14-breakthrough_N.htm?loc=interstitialskip">For Black Candidates, Top Spots Still Elusive</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Susan Page, USA Today, June 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nationwide, the number of African Americans winning major-party nominations for the high-profile offices hasn&rsquo;t risen in the wake of Obama&rsquo;s election. It has gone down.</p>
<p>A record six black candidates claimed these nominations in the 2006 midterms. This year, no more than four have a reasonable chance to be nominated.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among black candidates, Massachusetts Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick is seeking a second term. In Georgia, Labor Commissioner Michael Thurmond faces an uphill race for the Senate against Republican incumbent Johnny Isakson and Attorney General Thurbert Baker is seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, though former governor Roy Barnes is favored in the state&rsquo;s July 20 primary.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s Meek [Rep. Kendrick Meek], who cites Obama as an inspiration and met in Chicago this month with veterans of Obama&rsquo;s 2004 Senate campaign for advice. But a $4 million advertising blitz over the past month by political unknown Jeff Greene has imperiled Meek&rsquo;s nomination.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Political scientists including Vincent Hutchings of the University of Michigan say Obama&rsquo;s breakthrough not only hasn&rsquo;t smoothed the way for other black candidates but has complicated it, at least for now.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Oversized expectations</b></p>
<p>Why are there so few black nominees for top jobs this year?</p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of African-American candidates are Democrats, and some problems they&rsquo;re encountering are familiar to Democratic contenders generally. Republicans hope a widespread sense that the nation is headed in the wrong direction could fuel an electoral tidal wave that might even cost Democrats control of Congress.</p>
<p>David Bositis, a veteran scholar of black politics at The Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, says a lack of a deep bench of African-American officeholders in lower offices also has been a factor in the paucity of nominees for prized offices this year.</p>
<p>And he and others say it was never realistic to expect that Obama&rsquo;s election, while a milestone, instantly would transform the nation&rsquo;s racial politics. Expectations were oversized when he won: Seven in 10 Americans predicted in a USA TODAY survey that his election would make race relations better.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Only a few black candidates in U.S. history have managed to do that. Since Reconstruction, the number of African Americans who have been elected senator or governor can be counted on one hand: governors Wilder and Patrick and senators Edward Brooke of Massachusetts, Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois and Obama. (Brooke was a Republican; the rest are Democrats.)</p>

		<p>I found out today that Alvin Greene, who &#8220;shockingly&#8221; won the D-nomination for Senate in SC, who can&rsquo;t seem to string together a coherent sentence, nor knows the name of his Republican opponent and incumbent office holder of the seat he wants off the top of his head, has a University of South Carolina degree in PolySci, and was also in Army Intelligence.</p>
<p>Another factor to explain the paucity of blacks winning nominations for statewide offices is that Obama&rsquo;s sorry performance is spoiling it for the rest of them, though they really wouldn&rsquo;t be much better.</p>

How to make the instant transformation?  Give illegals the Vote, just as the American Promise demands of us that we do, and ban White Humanity from voting who live in districts that have a &#8220;troubling and disappointing&#8221; record of never electing the black.</p>

		<p>Boy, this is really a surprise!  We elect a Marxist ninny to the White House and black pols find their prospects diminished.  Who woulda thunk it?</p>
<p>The simple fact is that Obama has set race relations in this country back fifty years.  He&rsquo;s America&rsquo;s very own Robert Mugabe, who in a remarkably short time destroyed the incredibly prosperous and productive nation of Rhodesia.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the damage wrought by this witless dolt will not prove to be irreparable.</p>

The public got a sample of black leadership and it didn&rsquo;t turn out to be the second coming.</p>
<p>I said after the election of President Obama that the one good thing to come out of his victory was that he was elected while there is still a white majority. It&rsquo;s not too late for whites to see what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

		<p>There is to my way of thinking, and perhaps always will be, something very strange and even very peculiar about how O got to the top. Came from out of nowhere, an unknown IL state senator and then to to the front runner for Pres in just two years? That is impossible.</p>
<p>At least to now.</p>
<p>The man had in the background some very strong and powerful backers pushing him along. Ted Kennedy and the Daley boys, Soros, Geffen, etc. Lots of big money, much more than the big business Republicans could ever muster from their backers.</p>
<p>So how is this so? And that there are so few other blacks for top positions seems to suggest that O was pushed in a way NO OTHER ever has been or maybe EVER will be.</p>
<p>My perceptions were over a year before the election that O was ANOINTED! Powerful elites &#8220;see-lected&#8221; [A. Sharpton] him?</p>

		<p>Since 1916, when this country started electing all US Senators, there have been three black US Senators&hellip;.two from Illinois and one from Massachusetts. This means, 48 states have never had a black US Senator&hellip;.never more than one at the same time and, more often than not, there were none at all.</p>
<p>To me, Obama&rsquo;s election in 2008, with almost no Federal experience, was a reflection of how horrible John McCain was as a candidate and campaigner. </p>
<p>Wait till November.<br>

<p>It never ends. </p>
<p>Gerrymandering. Affirmative action. A Black POTUS. A free pass in all walks of life based on skin color. All of this, and they still whine.</p>
<p>If a company has 100 employees, including 14 who are Black, I have no doubt that the 14 Blacks look around and immediately conclude, &#8220;Racism!&#8221; Proportionality is beyond the grasp of most Blacks.</p>
<p>Of course, proportionality is wrong too. What about the best people for the job, based on merit and ability? </p>
<p>Instead of realizing that their demographic is proportionally represented in a situation where they constitute about 14 percent, Blacks are undoubtedly upset that they do not see an equal number of Blacks or more.  </p>
<p>In contrast, a sane White person would look at the 14 Blacks in the company of 100 and immediately recognize that 14 much more qualified Whites were passed over for the positions to satisfy affirmative action requirements.</p>

		<p>By specifying by race, etc who should be elected or even selected, this is, as being proven already in countries such as South Africa where it is called affirmative action, the end as far as excellence in a country&rsquo;s progress is concerned.  We have it in the West in some countrie where the insistence on there being more women elected just because they are women and &#8220;there are not enough of them in government or a business etc&#8221;.  Only those who are the best, most qualified and capable should be elected.  That is true democracy.</p>

		<p>Though not all black politicians are bad, so many of them are that their increased visibility leads many white voters to distrust them.  (Many blacks probably distrust them as well, but few would admit this publicly.)  The more authority they have, the more problematic.  Where cities and nations have been taken over by blacks, failure is in the wake.  The liberals created the biggest racial experiment of all in getting a black elected to the world&rsquo;s most powerful position, and now the old adages regarding blacks in power is there for all the planet to observe.  Worse, the liberals painted him as a magical messiah who could cure the racial ills of the entire world, making his failures even more glaring.  <br>
I figured that when Obama was elected it would mean a decreased electibility for black candidates.  Voters will cross party lines and vote for a less-than-stellar white candidate to keep blacks out.  Just look at NYC.  </p>

<i>Though not all black politicians are bad&hellip;</i></p>
<p>Which ones are good? Which ones represent my interests as a White man? I have not observed a single one who will.</p>
<p>JD Watts and Colin Powell were supposed to be different. What did they do when push came to shove? They both chose <b>race</b> before their political party&rsquo;s candidate. They both lobbied for, supported, and voted for Barack Hussein Obama because he was a <b>Black</b> man. As usual, race trumped all. Why deny it?</p>
<p>Of course, Juan &#8220;Amnesty&#8221; McShame was no better than the illegal alien African. I voted for Chuck Baldwin of the Constitution Party.<br>
