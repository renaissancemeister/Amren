			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jack Dolan, Los Angeles Times, June 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>California welfare recipients are able to use state-issued debit cards to withdraw cash on gaming floors in more than half of the casinos in the state, a Los Angeles Times review of records found.</p>
<p>The cards, provided by the Department of Social Services to help recipients feed and clothe their families, work in automated teller machines at 32 of 58 tribal casinos and 47 of 90 state-licensed poker rooms, the review found.</p>
<p>State officials said Wednesday they were working to determine how much money had been withdrawn from casino ATMs by people using the welfare debit cards.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>McLear said the system of paying out welfare benefits via bank cards was created under Schwarzenegger&rsquo;s predecessor, Democrat Gray Davis. Since the late 1990s most states have adopted this system, which is a viewed as a more efficient way of distributing and tracking government aid.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Those cards, known as Electronic Benefit Transfer cards, look and work just like ordinary debit cards. They allow welfare recipients to access two accounts: the cash offered so needy parents can provide a home for their children while they train for better jobs, and an electronic version of food stamps that comes with rules governing where and how the benefits can be spent.</p>
<p>The cash benefits, however, can be withdrawn and spent just about anywhere.</p>

		<p>This is a old problem, not a new one.  In 1991, I was at a meeting of managers at an Indian casino.  They were concerned about the number of welfare checks (before EBT cards) being cashed at the casino.  Their decision was to continue cashing them because the checks would just be cashed elsewhere if they stopped.  <br>
This was in Minnesota, Land of 10,000 Welfare Programs.</p>

<p>We really have corrupted the Indians&hellip; Sometimes Arab grocery store workers will be charged for exchanging stamps for cash. Where I live the funds are electronic now. I have to admit, foolishly I&rsquo;ve bought food stamps before from people who claimed they needed my help. Live and learn. Not excusing what I did but at least they got something for their food stamps. . </p>

<p>Um I don&rsquo;t know about the rest of the country but most of the East coast &#8220;tribes&#8221; running the casinos are mostly fictions with people with like 1/8th or 1/16 indian blood using white guilt to get rich.</p>
<p>For example &#8220;Foxwoods&#8221; the largest casino on the East Coast, is run by a Indian &#8220;Nation&#8221;  &mdash;  the Pequots  &mdash;  which according to its wikipedia page only has just over members claiming to be full blooded Indian although almost all of them are Mixed Mestizos to some degree as a 200 person tribe would be rife with incest and deformity to be a genetically viable population.</p>

		<p>Orwell had a great critique of the mob and gambling in &#8220;1984.&#8221;  Sadly, his nightmare vision is becoming reality in 21st-century America.</p>
