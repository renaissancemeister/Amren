<h1>Reshape Universities Because of &#8220;Stereotype Threat&#8221;?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Roger Clegg, Minding the Campus, June 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An Inside Higher Ed article yesterday by English professor Satya P. Mohanty of Cornell on &#8220;Diversity&rsquo;s Next Challenges&#8221; {snip} features, in particular, an argument suggesting that &#8220;stereotype threat&#8221;  &mdash;  the claim that fear of being judged by a stereotype can cause minorities to do much less well on a test than they should  &mdash;  requires that universities and all of society must be restructured before minorities can be expected to succeed.</p>
<p>{snip} Professor Mohanty has extrapolated [the] claimed findings [of stereotype-threat research] to a broader one, that the &#8220;culture of our campuses,&#8221; indeed the entire &#8220;culture of learning,&#8221; needs to be restructured with the aim of fostering racial trust. Merely admitting a diverse student body is not enough: We must &#8220;think about what our campuses feel like to those who come to learn.&#8221; Campuses must be perceived as &#8220;trustworthy&#8221; by these students. And this means that campus culture must be &#8220;more open, democratic, and genuinely attentive to the experience of different social groups.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Needless to say, it would be a mistake to think that the problem of stereotype threat should be solved by encouraging students to think of themselves as individuals. To the contrary, we must recognize &#8220;the importance of group identification for the psychological well-being of those who are from socially marginalized groups.&#8221; Group identities are a good thing; indeed, even the resulting conflicts are just fine and should be &#8220;normalize[ed],&#8221; since such conflict is &#8220;a potential source of knowledge, a vitally important knowledge in a democratic society that thrives on difference  .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Professor Mohanty&rsquo;s piece appeared a day after Inside Higher Ed&rsquo;s rival The Chronicle of Higher Education published a piece by the Century Foundation&rsquo;s Richard D. Kahlenberg, arguing, as he long has, for the replacement of race-based affirmative action with wealth-based preferences. {snip} Having done this, we must &#8220;question our deeper assumptions about what success is&#8221; and &#8220;rethink some of our most basic theoretical assumptions.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of those is &#8220;the nature and value of what is called &#8216;objectivity.&rsquo;&#8221; In particular, &#8220;genuine objectivity&#8221; need not embrace &#8220;neutrality&#8221;  &mdash;  colorblindness  &mdash;  where &#8220;unfairness is built into the environment&#8221;: &#8220;What seems fair and just to a member of one social group is not in fact experienced in the same way by members of a group that is, say, the target of negative social stereotypes.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, really, you have a remarkable amount of the usual nonsense compressed into one piece here: Our whole educational system  &mdash;  indeed, our whole society  &mdash;  is rife with discriminatory assumptions and attitudes that explain why some groups don&rsquo;t do as well as others, that the solution is to change the way universities (and, ultimately, all society, which of course must be led by our universities) operate so that all students succeed, that identity politics and even conflict is good, that more federal spending on and control of education is essential, and that objectivity is a fraud, or at least it is if you define it as neutral rather than as, well, subjective.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the irony: Professor Mohanty unwittingly does a fine job of refuting most of the rest of his piece in this one sentence that begins his penultimate paragraph:</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the most revealing experiments .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. showed that what targets of negative stereotype threat respond to most favorably is a clear message that while the test is tough the evaluation will be fair  &mdash;  that the students&rsquo; social identities will not be a factor in the way their academic performance is judged.&#8221;</p>
<p>Precisely. {snip} The test can be &#8220;tough&#8221;  &mdash;  don&rsquo;t dumb it down to ensure that everyone succeeds  &mdash;  so long as the students know that &#8220;social identities&#8221; aren&rsquo;t weighed, one way or the other. Universities cannot keep it a secret when they have different admission standards, and they will not fool the students when post-admission policies are jerry-rigged with an eye on politically correct equal outcomes either.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And how could it be otherwise? If a university has one set of admission standards for one group, but it lowers them for another group, it will inevitably feed stereotype threat rather than thwart it. The same is true if begins changing post-admission standards.</p>
<p>Rather than obsessively defining and redefining diversity, and trying to calibrate what effect this or that kind of diversity has on this or that vague aspect of &#8220;the learning environment,&#8221; universities would be better advised to focus on hiring smart professors who are best qualified to find the truth in particular disciplines and impart it to students who are, in turn, chosen as the most qualified to do work at the intellectual level demanded by that university.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that &#8220;the future of diversity&#8221; means &#8220;the future of racial and ethnic preferences.&#8221; And focusing on superficial characteristics like skin color and what country someone&rsquo;s ancestors came from is, besides being divisive and unfair and legally dubious, simply not a good way to select the most talented and valuable individuals. {snip}<br>

Anyone who wants to read about the foolishness that is &#8216;stereotype threat&rsquo;, you can read about it here:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat</a></p>
<p>I once got into an online discussion with Mr. Claude M. Steele in the early 2000s regarding his theory of stereotype threat. I asked him to provide me with peer review research. The three studies he cited listed him as an author in the study.</p>
<p>I hardly consider peer review independent if the work being reviewed is reviewed and verified by the original proponent of the work.</p>

And this means that campus culture must be &ldquo;more open, democratic, and genuinely attentive to the experience of different social groups.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Surely they are worried about what white men on campus think, as college campuses are centered on the idea that all problems in the world, past, present and future, are caused by white men, and that seems the knowledge they are most concerned with transmitting to students? </p>

		<p> Just another way of blaming black nonachievement on whites! If &#8216;group Identification is vital to the psychological well-being of those from socially marginalized groups&#8221;, whites must now have a green light to redevelop an intense sense of racial solidarity since, on today&rsquo;s politically correct campuses, they are the most marginalized group of all. </p>

		<p>But what about the smart Asians who score highest on all exams?  Do we reconstruct university to help them score even higher?  Won&rsquo;t that only widen the so called achievement gap between them and the other non white minorities?</p>
<p>Perhaps Asians live into the stereotype of academic achievement.  Should we close the achievement gap by insisting they show more compassion on those ethnic groups who haven&rsquo;t yet progressed to that self image? Shouldn&rsquo;t Asians not study so hard as a concession to those non whites who aren&rsquo;t achieving academic success?</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
Glegg understands this: Diversity is the tactic in the contest for Unearned Race Privilege for non whites. </p>
<p>In corollary,  Affirmative Action in racial profiling against the career aspirations and hopes of whites.</p>
<p>Affirmative Action is Diversity Race Privilege for non whites.</p>
<p>How much longer will we tolerate injustice?</p>
<p><br>
I&rsquo;ll live into this stereotype- Whites are the Creative Geniuses who created advanced civilization, and therefore, I distrust all non whites who parisitically take what should me only ours and ours alone.<br>

		<p>What&rsquo;s interesting is that wherever there are these company diversity statements and affirmative action, wherever they are discrimination against whites the most, this is where the public face of diversity must be that it is &#8216;whites who are discriminating&rsquo;, and discrimination is evil. </p>

		<p>&#8216;Stereotype threat&rsquo;? Raymond Wolters, who was covered here on AmRen a few weeks ago, was noticing how every years it&rsquo;s a different excuse, or at least there&rsquo;s new terminology. What&rsquo;s funny is that no matter how many different words they use to describe white behavior and right and wrong, the real behavior of non-whites becomes worse and worse.</p>

		<p>This is perhaps the biggest nonsense I have heard form the diversity/multi-culti/all-people-are-equal propaganda headquarters.</p>
<p>Jews, allegedly, were discriminated against for centuries (hence, anti-Semitism) in half of Europe so, according to the above &#8220;theory&#8221;, they should show substandard academic achievement at those times and places.</p>
<p>Nothing like that happened. On the contrary, they tended to outperform the natives. Which clearly debunks this absurd &#8220;theory&#8221;.</p>
<p>I hope one day an objective commission will review the &#8220;scholarship&#8221; of these propagandists (some of them being morons and some being agitators) and strip of academic degrees, titles, and tenures all those who preached nonsense, for whatever reason. (I guess, most of anthropology departments would fall into that category.) In addition, if that were my choice, I would have them re-pay their universities all the salaries they drew.</p>
<p>What a shame!<br>

<p>Wait, was he the reviewer of the study or just the author.  I don&rsquo;t put much stock in the studies themselves (whether they were properly peer reviewed or not), but alleging that the authors of the study were chosen as a the reviewers is a pretty serious accusation and a seeming non sequitur when placed with the rest of your comment.<br>

		<p>The situation can be called &#8216;racial bloating&rsquo;. This is amply  documented by the failure of a black national bank managed and staffed entirely by blacks but with a &#8216;workforce&rsquo; bloated by some 75% simply because of blacks giving other blacks &#8216;jobs&rsquo; as perks for past services rendered. This black &#8216;bloating&rsquo; can be political, racial or financial (or any combination) but always fails. Black supermarkets just for black customers for example.<br>

		<p>It sounds like Mohanty would be pleased with schools segregated as to ethnicity.  Then one ethnic group wouldn&rsquo;t be threatened by another, and each group could teach that it was superior to every other group.</p>

		<p>This writer is a Hindu whose parents, and possibly herself are from India.  I wonder how her people are doing with the whole social justice thing over there?</p>
<p>You know, in India, there are rigid classes and those on the bottom, the untouchables, are often discriminated against.  I wonder if Satya, when she visits India, looks down on the Dalits, as they are called, and is happy when they clean her toilets.  Social justice has not been achieved in her homeland.  Why is she lecturing us here about some crock theory of group depression over stereotypes?</p>
<p>Even Mexico, I read, is the country with the most inequalities on earth (in terms of the gap between rich and poor).  You can look anywhere in the world outside of Western civilization and find huge inqualities.</p>
<p>America is the only nation on earth where so many can come from so many places and claim &#8216;equality&rsquo; without earning it or sacrificing for it.</p>
<p>They have already turned our KG-12 system into a social justice fantasy land where &#8220;all children can learn&#8221; (cue the smiley face and diverse array of children in a poster).  </p>
<p>Since that&rsquo;s not really working out, and a combination of an expanding flood of foreign illiterates and an ever declining and self-destructive black culture is swamping any progress they might have made, now they want to rip down the universities and make them marxist feel-good centers too, instead of centers of cutting edge research and learning by our best and brightest.</p>
<p>Look, I don&rsquo;t care what race the person is, if they have the intellectual chops then they should have a shot at college, but flooding our colleges with Affirmative Action cases, with high school &#8216;graduates&rsquo; who got by on cut-and-paste poster board &#8216;projects&rsquo; and &#8216;differentiated&rsquo; learning, and then they find the work is too tough for them - well then that&rsquo;s too bad.  </p>
<p>My own father wouldn&rsquo;t have made it in college, because he just had a different life experience - a raw deal in many respects, but he found meaningful factory work and never caused any trouble with the law.  </p>
<p>I got into college with no special help from anyone and then I loved it and truly blossomed. (No student loans or scholarships - just 2-3 jobs and 1-2 classes a term until I graduated with two degrees)  That&rsquo;s how it goes.  Some people in a family have the luck/ability and some don&rsquo;t.  </p>
<p>Why is it I never suffered from a &#8216;group-stereotype&rsquo;?  I was not from a rich or particulary gifted family, and there were rich kids all around me, and I didn&rsquo;t give a hoot.</p>

		<p>The left has destroyed grades K-12 and virtually ever liberal arts program in every college in America.   Now they&rsquo;re going for science, engineering, and math as well.   Pretty soon, any university that receives federal grants will just be holding tanks for  communist morons and thugs.   </p>

		<p>TO: 8  &mdash;  Anonymous wrote at 10:12 PM on June 4:</p>
<p>Some of what I will respond to can be found at this link:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat</a></p>
<p>In 1999, Steele presented his stereotype threat theory to the general public in this article:</p>
<p>The Atlantic Monthly, August 1999 Thin Ice: Stereotype Threat and Black College Students</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/2bzp327" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2bzp327</a></p>
<p>PBS did a hit piece on the SATs based on a book I believe is called, &ldquo;The Big Test&rdquo; which is where I first heard the term stereotype threat. I later read the Atlantic Monthly article:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/sats/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/sats/</a></p>
<p>During an online discussion, I asked Steele if he could provide any independent peer review articles supporting his research (I don&rsquo;t recall my exact phasing from the time but that&rsquo;s how I remember it).</p>
<p>Mr. Steele gave me three papers that he claimed (independently) supported his work.</p>
<p>If you go to the wikipedia link above, you will find at the bottom, a list of works allegedly supporting his claims.</p>
<p>Here are a few:</p>
<p>Steele, C. M., Spencer, S., &amp; Aronson, J. (2002). Contending with group image: The psychology of stereotype and social identity threat. In M. Zanna (Ed.), Advances in Experimental Social Psychology Vol. 37. Academic Press.</p>
<p>Steele CM, Aronson J (November 1995). &#8220;Stereotype threat and the intellectual test performance of African Americans&#8221;. J Pers Soc Psychol 69 (5): 797–811.</p>
<p>Aronson, J., Lustina, M. J., Good, C., Keough, K., Steele, C. M., &amp; Brown, J. (1999). When white men can&rsquo;t do math: Necessary and sufficient factors in stereotype threat. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 35, 29–46.</p>
<p>Blascovich J, Spencer SJ, Quinn D, Steele C (May 2001). &#8220;African Americans and high blood pressure: the role of stereotype threat&#8221;. Psychol Sci 12 (3): 225–9.</p>
<p>(There may be others which aren&rsquo;t listed on the wikipedia page)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recall which of the research papers Mr. Steele cited as independent peer review, but if you look at the four I posted here, you&rsquo;ll see that Mr. Steele has participated as author in each of these four papers (as I noted, there may be others which aren&rsquo;t listed in the Wikipedia entry and I don&rsquo;t recall which ones Mr. Steele gave me).</p>
<p>However, at the time, I thought it odd that Mr. Steele presented examples of work on which he was listed as an author as being independent peer review.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Subjective objectivity!&#8221; Only a Marxist could come up with something like that and only a deranged society thoroughly brainwashed with multicultural mumbo-jumbo would take any of this nonsense seriously. </p>
<p>The situation is crazy. I mean, here&rsquo;s Mohanty warbling about &#8220;stereotype threats&#8221; and &#8220;the future of diversity&#8221; while the country collapses all around him. Picture Marx, Lenin and Trotsky arguing dialectics in a cabin on the Titanic, completely unaware that the ship is sinking. </p>
<p>Characters like Mohanty can only exist in times of economic surplus and general prosperity when the culture&rsquo;s rich enough to indulge its parasites, but the handwriting is on the wall. In a few years, maybe sooner, the US is going to implode financially  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s unavoidable now  &mdash;  and the country won&rsquo;t be able to afford frauds like Mohanty or the increasingly useless, overpriced ivory towers that pay them so much for their hot air.<br>

		<p>I have been taking classes at our local community college for a couple years now, and this year all science courses, except for one law class.  It has been very easy to discern the attitude of automatic advancement among some women and all racial minorities.  Women and minorities that are failing seem to have the attitude that they will make it anyway because of their Protected Group status.  One teacher has confided this same observation in general.  Some are getting big surprises right now, at the end of the term.  Regardless, the general trend is that many women and minorities get passed because the pressure is so great to move them on.  This same teacher is schedueled to teach the same class this summer, only in a shorter, easier form.  His quote last week was, &#8220;I will get those of you who did not make it this time, through.&#8221;  This correlates with the increasing incompetence in America in general.</p>
<p>(Incidentally, the law teacher expressed his &#8220;skepticism&#8221; regarding Diversity via private email.  This at a campus that is making Diversity a major point of their educational process.  I feel like a spy among true believers.)</p>
<p>This all confirms the basic idea that meritless advancement creates a malaise in society. This is what happened in the USSR and other communist countries and is creating in the West now.  Our systems are collapsing because of a standards.  (However, it is also because the loss of ethics in the capitalist world.  Theodore Roosvelt and Eisenhower was right.) </p>
