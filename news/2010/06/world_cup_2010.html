<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->

<p>According to the South African organizing committee and FIFA, soccer&rsquo;s international governing body, more than 130,000 of the 2.8 million tickets were purchased by U.S. residents, the highest total by any country other than South Africa. Donald Gips, U.S. ambassador to South Africa, estimated that between 25,000 and 40,000 Americans would attend some of the 64 matches.</p>
<p>They are not necessarily coming to see the U.S. team, however. Although there&rsquo;s no way to determine, through ticket purchases, a fan&rsquo;s rooting interest, the United States&rsquo; broad ethnic makeup suggests that many will support Mexico, Honduras and other Latin American nations.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the massive ticket-buying effort &#8220;says a lot about the growth of the game in the U.S.,&#8221; said Sunil Gulati, president of the U.S. Soccer Federation. &#8220;It also says something about the size of our country, the wealth of our country and the diversity of our country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of the three first-round matches involving the U.S. team, Saturday&rsquo;s meeting against Group C favorite England was the most appealing to American supporters. The USSF sold its entire allotment of tickets: about 5,200 at 44,530-seat Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg. Other U.S. fans purchased tickets through FIFA&rsquo;s distribution program and tour packages. Vice President Biden is scheduled to attend.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a perception that, in the States, it is mainly Spanish-speaking Americans, it&rsquo;s their game,&#8221; said Danny Jordaan, chief executive of South Africa&rsquo;s World Cup organizing committee. &#8220;What we found is that it has become more of a sport than to just Spanish-speaking Americans. It&rsquo;s good for the sport in the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Airfare to South Africa from the United States ranged from $1,500 to $4,000 in recent months and quality hotels were initially difficult to secure. Visitors also had to take into account logistical issues in an emerging country and South Africa&rsquo;s security concerns.</p>

		<p>My wife works with a guy who fled South Africa, and another guy who&rsquo;s going to South Africa for the World Cup.  Apparently the former told the latter all sorts of useful information about staying in the crowd with the rest of the white people and to NEVER go anywhere alone if he wanted to return home intact.  We&rsquo;ll see how it turns out.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sorry but there&rsquo;s no way it&rsquo;s Hispanic &#8220;Americans&#8221; shelling out a minimum of $1500 just to FLY to South Africa, in addition to what it&rsquo;ll cost to stay there.  No, methinks it&rsquo;s more of the same white-guilt folks that put the Kenyan in the White House.  Hopefully their perverse fascination with all things African doesn&rsquo;t become hazardous to their health like it has for so many others.</p>

		<p>People who are rooting for Mexican or Honduras are not Americans, they&rsquo;re Mexicans or Hondurans, foreign nationals who happen to live in the US legally or illegally.</p>

<p>The first poster said this already but I would like to reiterate: There aren&rsquo;t hoards of unassimilated Hispanics who can afford to fly all the way to South Africa (which costs a LOT of money, no joke) and stay in a hotel and everything. The few assimilated Hispanics who can afford to go will, of course, be rooting for the US team. But Mr. Villanueva and his sixteen children, fresh from Matamoros, cannot afford to be making trips to South Africa just to see some soccer games.</p>

		<p>When Hispanics become the majority in the U.S. the NFL and AFL will disappear, or at least become the inverse of what soccer and American football is today.  One could consider it a benchmark for the historic declaration of the end of America.</p>

<p>  This doesn&rsquo;t bode well for our future as a nation. Most people emigrate from Latin America to get away from Latin America and its problems. In the near future they will emigrate from Latin America to Latin America.</p>

		<p>&#8220;American Fans Will Have Power In Numbers.&#8221; Power to do what?</p>
<p>Maybe I should become a headline writer when I retire. This makes no sense. </p>
<p>&#8220;Visitors also had to take into account logistical issues in an emerging country and South Africa&rsquo;s security concerns.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Emerging?&#8221; How about &#8220;devolving&#8221; or &#8220;decaying?&#8221; South Africa, along with Rhodesia, was once a thriving civilized country. South Africa had <i>nuclear weapons,</i> until some prescient individual saw which way the wind was blowing, and ordered their dismantling. They &#8220;emerged&#8221; a long time ago. Now they&rsquo;re falling apart.  </p>

		<p>It is unfortunate that most of these Americans do not know about the violent crime in S. Africa, since if they did they would not be so foolish to travel there. We can hope that security will be up and with many more people there it will be safer than usual. Still it is an expensive risk to take to travel there-as a friend who fled S. Africa (leaving behind many assets because it was more important to get his family out of that country) has told me.</p>
