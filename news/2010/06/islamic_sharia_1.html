			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joel Siegel, ABC News, June 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Oklahoma is poised to become the first state in the nation to ban state judges from relying on Islamic law known as Sharia when deciding cases.</p>
<p>The ban is a cornerstone of a &#8220;Save our State&#8221; amendment to the Oklahoma constitution that was recently approved by the Legislature.</p>
<p>The amendment  &mdash;  which also would forbid judges from using international laws as a basis for decisions  &mdash;  will now be put before Oklahoma&rsquo;s voters in November. Approval is expected.</p>
<p>Oklahoma has few Muslims  &mdash;  only 30,000 out of a population of 3.7 million. The prospect of sharia being applied there seems remote. But a chief architect of the measure, Republican State Rep. Rex Duncan, calls the proposed ban a necessary &#8220;preemptive strike&#8221; against Islamic law coming to the state.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sharia has gained a toehold in some western countries, notably Great Britain, where five sharia courts have been established to settle certain disputes among Muslims, with the government&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<p>The proposed Oklahoma amendment is aimed, in part, at &#8220;cases of first impression,&#8221; legal disputes in which there is no law or precedent to resolve the matter at hand.</p>
<p>In such cases, judges might look to laws or rulings in other jurisdictions for guidance. The proposed amendment would block judges in Oklahoma courts from drawing on sharia, or the laws of other nations, in such decisions.</p>
<p>The amendment also is a response to what some conservatives see as a pernicious trend  &mdash;  cases of liberal judges mostly notably Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, using foreign laws to shape their opinions in U.S. cases.</p>
<p>&#8220;It should not matter what France might do, what Great Britain might do, or what the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia might do,&#8221; Duncan said. &#8220;Court decisions ought to be based on federal law, or state law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oklahoma Law May Not Be Constitutional</p>
<p>Legal experts contacted by ABC News said they did not know of one instance of a judge in the U.S. invoking sharia in rendering a decision.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cohen added that he questions whether the proposed amendment would pass constitutional muster.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our federal system and our state system is in part governed by the concept of separation of powers. It&rsquo;s far from clear that the Oklahoma legislature can restrict what a separate branch of government can consider in terms of doing its job  &mdash;  in this case, deciding cases,&#8221; he said.</p>

		<p>I think the legislature can make such a bill, because if the Oklahoma Constitution is anything like the Federal Constitution, then it is the legislature&rsquo;s purview what courts other than the state supreme court get created, and the scope of their jurisdiction.</p>
<p>As an aside, I tend to think that talk about Muslim terrorism, while important, is a bit of a distraction:  When it comes to Muslims, the end game is the imposition of Sharia.  Terrorism is just one of many tactics in their arsenal for that end.  Former Federal prosecutor Andy McCarthy thinks that the Jihad crowd will actually tone it down on terrorist threats and activity, because it is turning out to be counterproductive (in their view) in their larger quest to spread Sharia.  McCarthy thinks that they&rsquo;ll try and work their way up in through the &#8220;long march through the institutions,&#8221; i.e. play on liberal-neocon notions of fairness and equality, and then implement Sharia once they gain adequate power through the democratic process.</p>

		<p>Arizona making sense, and now Oklahoma?</p>
<p>Seems offensive that the best states in the Union weren&rsquo;t part of the Old Confederacy and can&rsquo;t become scapegoats in the South-hating habit of the MSM.</p>
<p>Dang, if only South Carolina has led the nation in these timely and helpful laws, then MSM could have blamed the racist bigotry on John C. Calhoun and Jeff Davis!   </p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t somebody do some research and prove that Nathan Bedford Forrest stepped on S.C. soil and thus the whole state is tainted with dreams of Ft. Pillow and Night Riders?</p>

		<p>Cohen is obviously being disingenuous.  The Oklahoma legislature is not putting restrictions on the Oklahoma judiciary.   The legislature has put forward a constitutional amendment that the voters will decide on.  If it passes, it will bind the entire Oklahoma government, executive, legislative, and judicial.</p>

		<p>Ugly interlopers have entered this country and seek to eat at it&rsquo;s foundations much like termites. They have enlisted fatherless children from the ghettos to do some of their bidding.

This sentence strikes right to the heart of the issue.  If the federal government is no longer willing to provide even a veneer of legitimacy or appearance to be working in the interests of the people who live here, then what motivation do the states have for recognizing its authority?  None.</p>
<p>In the past, respect for that authority (combined with the threat of federal troops) manipulated the states into accepting a great deal that should have been unacceptable.  That has changed&hellip;remarkably, under Obama.  MANY states are openly questioning the legitimacy of federal institutions, even talking about seccession (ie texas, alaska).  More to the point, they have raised troops, separate from the national guard, in numbers greater than the federal troops remaining in the US, AT THE SAME TIME as they are writing laws that nullify federal authority.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that the states are pausing, briefly, to see if the republican landslide that is obviously coming this November will return the federal government to some semblance of legitimacy.  If it does not, I think they will move aggressively against it.  They will pass all sorts of laws in direct contradiction to federal law, maybe even withhold the income taxes of their residents (if that happens you know the beginning of the end of the federal government has come).  Publically, they will give all sorts of justifications as to why the federal government should allow it.  Privately, they will threaten to jail, even deploy troops, against any agents of federal authority that attempt to sanction them.  They will be bluntly told to stay out of such and such a state.  </p>
<p>Actually, this has happened already to a certain extent.  Examples are New Hampshire and Montana that have threatened to jail BATFE agents who attempt to enforce federal laws in those states that contradict new state laws passed.</p>
<p>On the surface, things will likely look like business as usual in the US.  But it will be anything but.  Where you live will determine what types of goverance you are subject to and what types of opportunities are available.  Living in, say, california will be a very different experience than living in oklahoma.  People of various political bents better pay close attention to this.  The race of your neighbors (specifically if it matches your own) may soon be a very big deal indeed.</p>

		<p>That this could even become an issue any place in the US is incredible. If only Charles Manson and his followers had thought of this defense!  &#8220;We&rsquo;re devil-worshippers, following the dictates of Satan.  Let my people go!&#8221;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not a lawyer (but rather a human), but it occurs to me that it *would* pass &#8220;constitutional muster.&#8221; They aren&rsquo;t passing a simple law, but rather  &mdash;  it says right in the article  &mdash;  that this is a change to the state&rsquo;s constitution.</p>
<p>So the law would pass &#8220;constitutional muster&#8221; if the constitution was changed to allow it to pass muster, which is what they are proposing.</p>
<p>Good for Oklahoma, I say.</p>

		<p>I think this is a good move, on the part of the Oklahoma legislature. The citizens of Oklahoma will be governed according to the U.S.  and Oklahoma constitutions. It seems strange that a state has to put in writing what, heretofore, everyone took for granted; but with the influx of Muslims in this country, who owe allegiance to only their Koran, it has to be done.</p>
<p>How many times have we heard misguided fools say, &#8220;The law is the same, everywhere&#8221;? No, it&rsquo;s not.</p>

		<p>Anytime the Constitution of a State or Nation is &#8221;opened&#8221; up,( the process by which it is amended, there is big risk. This convention is as unnecessary as it is dangerous.  Laws not on the books, are not enforced or adhered to.  Judges have quite a bit of leeway when interpreting the law, but they are limited to the law they have before them.  </p>
<p>Similarities may exist between American and Sharia Law, and that&rsquo;s as close as it should get.  The Constitution is fine, those who disagree truly should find another country, thereby that countries laws, and reside there.</p>
