<h1>Murder Rates Affect IQ Tests Scores: Study</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Maggie Fox, Yahoo! News, June 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A murder in the neighborhood can significantly knock down a child&rsquo;s score on an IQ test, even if the child did not directly witness the killing or know the victim, U.S. researchers reported on Monday.</p>
<p>The findings have implications both for crime control efforts and for the heavy reliance on standardized tests, said New York University sociology professor Patrick Sharkey, who conducted the study.</p>
<p>They can also explain about half the achievement gap between blacks and whites on such tests, he reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sharkey {snip} collected details of more than 6,000 murders in the Chicago area and the results of two surveys of children and families in Chicago neighborhoods. The surveys included scores from tests that are used to determine a child&rsquo;s IQ.</p>
<p>If a murder occurred in a child&rsquo;s neighborhood  &mdash;  an area of roughly six to 10 square blocks as denoted by the U.S. Census  &mdash;  the children&rsquo;s test scores fell by an average of half a standard deviation, Sharkey reported.</p>
<p>On an IQ test using 100 as the average or norm, one standard deviation is 15 points. So if a child took the test within a week of a local murder, his or her score was 7-8 points lower on average than the score of a similar child in a similar neighborhood where there was no murder.</p>
<p>This fits in with what is known about the effects of post traumatic stress, Sharkey said. &#8220;The results suggest that children may carry the burden of violence with them as they take part in daily life within the neighborhood or school settings,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>PASSING EFFECT</p>
<p>The effects wear off after a week to nine days, Sharkey found. But in areas with a lot of crime, this does not provide much relief.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He was unable to find enough murders in predominately white neighborhoods to see if white children were affected.</p>
<p>Curiously, there were enough murders in Hispanic neighborhoods but Latino children seemed unaffected.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It could be the Hispanic children did not identify with the violence, Sharkey added. &#8220;Most of the victims, even in the Hispanic neighborhoods, were black.&#8221;</p>

		<p>WOW! Sandra Bullock was right!  Therefore let us do the right thing: appoint Sandra czarina of a new White House program, &#8220;Adopt for America&#8221; which will place EVERY black child (parents or not) into a white (preferably Ivy League) family as soon as possible.  That&rsquo;s the best way to get them out of violent IQ depressing neighborhoods and into peaceful IQ enhancing neighborhoods, right?</p>

		<p>I think these buffoons have causality reversed here; low IQ scores in a population increase murder rates, and not - as these &#8220;researchers&#8221; would have everyone pretend - the other way &#8216;round.</p>

		<p>So they are highlighting and reminding that &#8220;neighborhoods&#8221; in the black community are violent?   Ok, sure, I get the message. Blacks are dangerous and violent and prone to commit murder. </p>
<p>Why would MSM want this out there? Why would they want to give me data that confirms the truth of all my anti black &#8220;biases&#8221;?  </p>
<p>My instincts are vindicated, and MSM contributes to my veracity?</p>
<p>Something must be up with this. Watch the other hand.</p>
<p>Oh, I get it.   Blacks deserve equal protection under the law, adn if they have a drop in IQ because of violence endimic to their &#8216;hood, then we must close the IQ gap by moving whole tribes of black children into affluent White communities.</p>
<p>Today I saw a first. Walked out of a museum and encountered a group of school children, all black, except for ONE White boy.  How often do you see just ONE of ours surrounded by all of them?</p>
<p>Very off putting.  I fear for his IQ reduction and his helping to close the achievement gap by never being inspired by White genius and creativity.  </p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t smiling. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that in multiculturally integrated groups of school children, the minoritized White Humanity does not smile. It looks fearful, distracted, worried, and unhappy.   The Whites only smile and laugh when they get relief from the Diversity Treatment during lunch time and can all go sit by themselves alone, on their side of the Color Line, segregated into nature&rsquo;s White Tribe, just as God intended.</p>
<p>So my heart cried out for this one White boy surrounded by  non whites.  As I walked by, I said to him, &#8220;Miserable, isn&rsquo;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe I changed a life, just as mine was changed when I was a boy and found a copy of J.B. Stoner&rsquo;s Thunderbolt newspaper.  Everything has always made sense to me from that time till Kingdom come.</p>

		<p> One may consider whether, if this item of «research» had been available to the defence in the matter of Davidson v. The State of Tennessee, they would have tabled it as an component of their defense «strategy» to plead «mitigating circumstances» for their client.</p>
<p>  In his last appearance before the courts, «Mr» Davidson, now «brightly» attired in an white cotton prison jumpsuit, bearing the legand «TDOC - maximum security» across the shoulders, was sporting an arrow shaped «muslim» goatee. </p>
<p>  It appears that «Mr» Davidson, in an manner similar to approximately 100,000 male blacks currently incarcerated, on or off death row, has, despite his relatively short interval of incarceration, already converted to Islam. </p>
<p>  I have no idea of the speed at which the Tennessee DOC «graduates» death row inmates. However, if he lives long enough, perhaps, by the time his appeals are exhausted,  he may be invested with the status of an «prison imam.» </p>
<p>  I recall that, several years ago, an individual, quite likeable and charismatic, in fact, «Mike Thompson» by name, stated that he «was the most violent human being you will ever meet. The fact that I&rsquo;m alive proves that» Or,«words to that effect.»</p>
<p>  Mr. Thompson is an former member of the «executive» of the «Aryan Brotherhood,» «Alice Baker» or «The Brand.» An «Violent White Prison Gang.» According to the hyperbole of the BBC «documentary» (circa 2005), «exposing» the organisation.» And is serving an life sentence, without parole, for murder. He has admitted to murdering another 22 people during his interval of incarceration - most of his adult life, at this point. </p>
<p>  However, I would agree - immediately, that Mr Thompson, non obstant his violent career in prison, and the violent criminal act that put him there, is nevertheless, still an human being. During his interview, he was animated, voluble, and exposed an very high degree of intellectual capability. </p>
<p> By contrast, (by contrast), the brooding, silent, «Mr» Davidson, staring vacantly at the parents of his victims, as they excoriated him - rather too politely, I thought, for the crimes he and his accomplices had committed against their children, did not appear human at all. </p>
<p>  He had the passive, silent wariness that I have seen in wild animals, like bears,  or wolves, or other predators, that have been trapped, for euthanization, for killing human beings. These creatures do not exhibit remorse, but they exhibit an wary bewilderment for having been caught. </p>
<p>  That «Mr» Davidson was «radiating» the same psychological «aura» and the same passive yet wary physical posture, at his sentencing hearing was quite remarkable. He had all the «character,» attitude and demeanor of a monitor lizard.</p>
<p>  The world will be a better place without him.</p>
<p>  The trial proceedings were an exercise in «order;» they were not an exercise in justice. Even the Emperor Commodus, no paragon of fair play or self restraint, would have seen the justice in turning «Mr» Davidson over to the parents; particularly the punacious Mr. Christian, and then throwing them into the arena for the enjoyment of the crowd. </p>
<p>  Perhaps, in a better season, if the world ever turns right side up, we, or our children or grand children, may see the likes of «Mr» Davidson, fighting for their lives against Murmillos and Retiarii. «Damnati ad Ludus» is what «Mr» Davidson and his henchmen were; and Damnati ad Ludus» is what they deserve.</p>

<p>This research should be easily debunked but as I&rsquo;ve pointed out many times, one absurd theory after another to explain why the previous absurd theory (which was deemed flawless) was wrong and now requires a new theory to explain why the old theory needed to be revised.</p>

Apparently murders have a detrimental impact on black kids who take IQ tests, but have no bearing on the outcome of White kids who take the same test. Now all we have to do is stop blacks from murdering people and black kids will catch up to White kids (in school)in no time. Finally a solution to this problem. (sarcasm mode off)</p>

<p>You&rsquo;d think that by this time, they&rsquo;d have run out of tortuous pseudo-explanations to cover up the obvious.  But the imagination of the multiculti liberal knows no bounds when it comes to race.</p>

		<p>Well, since black violence is at least partly <a href="https://theunsilencedscience.blogspot.com/2010/01/epistemology-endocrinology.html" rel="nofollow">genetic</a>, I guess this proves that the black-white IQ-score gap is also partly genetic.</p>

		<p>Even if you want to believe such absolute nonsense it still boils down to blacks have lower IQ on average and that whites (discrimination) are not to blame for it, blacks are.<br>
Plus, if this new theory were true, the Jews in Israel should score very low due to all the suicide bombings and other traumatic violence over the last 20 years they have experienced. Perhaps Sharkey should go to Israel and prove his theory.</p>

		<p><i>A murder in the neighborhood can significantly knock down a child&rsquo;s score on an IQ test</i> just like bringing home insulin increases a risk of having a diabetic in one&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>It is hard to figure out whether the absurd claims of this kind are made by the &#8220;Liberal&#8221; agitators who wand to fool Americans into believing that race is just a social construct, or by morons who in their eagerness to prove the &#8220;politically correct&#8221; nonsense commit ideologue&rsquo;s fallacy (deriving &#8220;is&#8221; from &#8220;ought&#8221;).</p>
<p>The &#8220;revelations&#8221; reported in this article are particularly mind boggling these days when it&rsquo;s well known that low IQ causes asocial behavior, such as a tendency to break the law or to turn violent. (Just look how angry some less intelligent individuals become when they can&rsquo;t solve a puzzle.) Also, IQ is to a large extent inheritable (with reported 80+ percent correlation). So, a low IQ child is likely to live in a neighborhood characterized by low IQ where, naturally, crime and violence prevail.</p>
<p>In 1920ties, this kind of confusion of cause and effect was prevailing among politicized Soviet &#8220;scientists&#8221; (Lysenko being perhaps the most notorious example). I cannot resist hypothesizing a causality relationship between huge immigration from (former) Soviet Union to the U.S. and emergence of these Soviet-like &#8220;logic&#8221;.<br>

		<p>Once again an alleged professor in an institute of higher learning has it bass ackward! He assumes that low I.Q. scores are the result of the murder rate, rather than looking at the murder rates and how they are affected by low I.Q.scores. Personally, I think that a field such as sociology is akin to fields such as black history and women&rsquo;s studies. When I was growing up in South Philly, the average person in the fifties had more street smarts than today&rsquo;s citizens, and could tell you more about people and how they interact than any sociologist.These clowns (sociologists) do nothing but waste time and money with their useless studies. </p>
<p>I guess it never occurred to this joker that people with low I.Q.s are more prone to commit murders. Maybe someone should introduce him to the works of J. Philippe Rushton. Now there is a man who knows how to conduct a real scientific study.</p>
<p>Apparently professor Sharkey has made a living worrying about this sort of nonsense.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;They can also explain about half the achievement gap between blacks and whites on such tests, he reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>Wrong!</p>
<p>This study is inherently flawed, since it assumes two things:</p>
<p>1.) That blacks are only impacted by their environment and do not equally leave their mark (or should I say gunpowder traces) on it;</p>
<p>2.) That somehow whites and Hispanics seem to do the reverse, even when the interactions between environment and its impact on their respective groups&rsquo; individual IQ scores are in conflict with each others socioeconomic/security &ldquo;norms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now how can that be?</p>
<p>How can this be, to be more precise:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was unable to find enough murders in predominately white neighborhoods to see if white children were affected.</p>
<p>Curiously, there were enough murders in Hispanic neighborhoods but Latino children seemed unaffected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Are we indicating that if enough Hispanics move into white neighborhoods and everyday murder increases for them from that multicultural &ldquo;enrichment,&rdquo; we might gauge the white IQ average in a negative direction? Are we saying that blacks exposed to Hispanic resilience via IQ averages to the same degree, might culturally impact (nurture them, so to speak) in a different direction on the Bell Curve? If I purchase &ldquo;magic beans&rdquo; tonight and eat them, might I grow a beanstalk out of my head and turn green tomorrow?</p>

		<p>The study seems very odd and the results are equally confusing. In order to affect the child, the murder (homicide) must have occurred in his/her neighborhood within a six to ten square block.  Strange. And the effect is temporary.</p>
<p>&#8220;On an IQ test using 100 as the average or norm, one standard deviation is 15 points. So if a child took the test within a week of a local murder, his or her score was 7-8 points lower on average than the score of a similar child in a similar neighborhood where there was no murder.&#8221;</p>
<p>Note &#8220;similar child&#8221; i.e. another black child.  Now is this study saying that a black child exposed to violence would score 7-8 points below another black child in a similar neighborhood not recently exposed to violence?  In that case, the traumatized child would score only a 77 to 78 IQ.</p>
<p>&#8220;Curiously, there were enough murders in Hispanic neighborhoods but Latino children seemed unaffected.&#8221;  Interesting how this phenomenon does not affect hispanic kids.  Could there be something fundamentally wrong with the interpretation of these statistics?</p>
<p>I personally can understand that any child exposed to violence is certainly cognitively distracted.  But this does not address the cognitive gap between blacks and whites, but simply states that violence lowers black children&rsquo;s cognitive score even more than genes alone.</p>
<p>I thought the study was finally going to explain why blacks have an IQ at least one stand deviation below whites. But again, another worthless study.</p>

		<p>This certainly ranks as one of the most absurd interpretations of data ever.  So now kids in black neighborhoods, rife with violent crime, to include murder, are traumatized into much lower IQ scores than kids in neigborhoods without frequent murders, which by some strange coincidence are predominantly white neighborhoods.  Clearly, the only way to validate these data is to increase the murder rate in white neighborhoods, which could be effected by importing blacks to live in these neighborhoods.  Bur then the results would be tainted by umm, ah, oh, never mind.</p>

		<p>It is hard to tell from the article if the sociologist performed a statistically valid study, but I suspect he did not. It appears he did not track the measured IQs of individual children as a function of time, giving the same children tests over a period of time and looking for dips in individual scores after murders. Instead, it looks like he used different children in different neighborhoods at the same time. This is dubious. Also, did he check to see if the children were actually aware of the murders and knew the victims?  </p>

<p>Right, so FEW murders in white neighborhoods in Chi that NO statistical analysis can be done. That is correct about Chi. The image of Chi is that violence is just everywhere. But in a white Chi neighborhood, especially white working class, of which significant areas remain, you are very safe there. And if a crime did occur, it would not have been done by a whitey.</p>
<p>&#8220;Curiously, there were enough murders in Hispanic neighborhoods but Latino children seemed unaffected.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right again. Within their culture, violence is an accepted way of life. It does not bother them. On the contrary, revenge and killing over trivialties is an essential part of life. Taken with relative composure. An expression of macho and mano-a-mano and all that.</p>

		<p>Does low IQ really cause high murder rates? I&rsquo;m not discounting it as a factor, but say you collect a sample of 10,000 black guys, 10,000 asian guys and 10,000 white guys, all with IQs of about 75. I would bet you that the black guys still commit more murders than the other two groups put together. Who would commit more murders: a bunch of black men with IQs of 110, or a bunch of Asian women with IQs of 80? I really don&rsquo;t think IQ is the master factor here.</p>
<p>Low IQ neighbourhoods are highly correlated with high-murder rates however, but this is most likely due to the fact that low IQ neighbourhoods are filled with black people.</p>

		<p>Many liberals deny the existence of IQ and refuse to even discuss it.  So, it&rsquo;s at least interesting when one does so.  Maybe the increasing awareness of the public, via the internet, has pressured the left into confronting more than simply the nebulous &#8220;achievement gap&#8221;.  So, a study is found that supports the liberal argument that race isn&rsquo;t responsible for lower IQ&rsquo;s.  Of course, the sound bite is all that matters, because the study further found that the slightly lowered IQ&rsquo;s go back up in a short period of time.  But, anyway, high murder rates make for a good excuse because at least 2/3 of murders are by blacks, and that&rsquo;s not likely to change for the better.  And you can bet that huge numbers of whites aren&rsquo;t going to move into crime-infested ghettos to water down the numbers.  So, blaming murder for low IQ is an assured winner.</p>

The rest of the time they are smarter than  Koreans, Chinamen, and Hebrews. If we would do away with tests the myth of racial differences in intelligence would evaporate.I watched Stephen Hawking on tv. He is so dumb he can`t even talk and he scored 165.

<p>Your bright White/Asian child matter nothing to the educational establishment and the government, they&rsquo;re the ones left behind.

<p>Here&rsquo;s an excerpt from a letter I received from a colleague (an EXCELLENT teacher) who teaches Algebra I in  a large, typical high school in Los Angeles:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I&rsquo;m really glad I didn&rsquo;t waste my time making a cumulative final for the class.  The students here can&rsquo;t even be bothered to study for a unit test. </p>
<p> Question #1 is:   &#8216;How long did you study?&rsquo;   &mdash;  and the majority of them wrote in that they didn&rsquo;t.  Then there is a large portion of them that handed the test in completely blank.  I&rsquo;m thinking I should send a few copies to Obama and some of the knotheads up north and ask them what they expect us to do with that kind of<br>
nonsense&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This is what the public needs to know about typical non-White high school students  &mdash;  that so many are disinterested and disconnected from the educational process and there is NOTHING we teachers can do about it.  </p>

		<p>It seems possible that hearing rumors of a murder would force someone into a mental state which is mainly concerned with immediate safety and that this might lower IQ temporarily.</p>
<p>It seems unlikely that it truly causes half the racial IQ gap. Maybe that researcher was lying, or maybe he meant that there are enough murders that IF it is the cause that it could be causing half the IQ gap.</p>
<p>What we might need to protect the IQs of children is for communities to be allowed to jointly own property so that they can have a policy that anyone who is convicted of a crime above a certain severity be ejected from the community.  It could be done privately, and since the residents would no longer be the owners of the living quarters, they would have not right to stay there if the whim of the corporation was to have them leave.  The corporation could also have a contract with each member that said that they would not eject them unless they were convicted of one of the forbidden crimes.</p>

Murders anywhere within a 6 to 10 square block range!  And victims that they didn&rsquo;t even know!</p>
<p>How did the vibes of this violence reach the child   &mdash;   was it carried, like germs, through the air? <br>
What about violence within  <b>the child&rsquo;s own home, </b> which is probably a far more common and casual experience,  and which would affect the child directly?  What about that?</p>

		<p>This is from Science Daily:</p>
<p>To measure the impact of a local homicide, Sharkey compared the test scores of children who were assessed directly after a homicide in their neighborhood with other children in the same neighborhood who were assessed at different times. He took into account three geographic areas of increasing size: &#8220;block groups,&#8221; which are small sets of city blocks that have about 1,500 residents; &#8220;census tracts,&#8221; which are slightly larger and have about 4,000 residents; and &#8220;neighborhood clusters,&#8221; which have about 8,000 residents. Because all comparisons were made among children living within the same neighborhoods, the analysis can be thought of like an experiment in which some children are randomly picked to be assessed in the days following a local homicide while other children are picked to be assessed at a different point, further removed from the date of the homicide.</p>
<p>Correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but the study is comparing black children in the same general neighborhood with other black children.  If violence is the cause of half the IQ gap between blacks and whites, then blacks not exposed to violence for at least a couple of weeks would score on average 92 IQ.  But that isn&rsquo;t the case, is it? It&rsquo;s more like blacks exposed to recent violence score 77-78 IQ.  Am I interpreting the data correctly?</p>

		<p>Ah, another brilliant attempt at explaining the intractable achievement gap, and another swing and a miss.  I remember when I was younger, it was the lead paint on the walls of the projects that was causing the drop in IQ points.  How many kids did you know that ATE paint off the walls?  I dunno, maybe that&rsquo;s a black thang.</p>
<p>Before that it was poor nutrition, or it was the deplorable conditions of the classrooms, or noisy traffic outside, it has been explored ad nauseam.  The one thing I have noticed in these achievement gap studies, is that Asians are never mentioned.  They can&rsquo;t explain how a group of people of a different race, who were brought into this country in the 19th century as cheap, disposable labor, who were vilified and considered sub-human have managed to out-perform scholastically every other minority.  It flies in face of all their theories.  Here in San Francisco there are Asian gangs, and sporadic violence in their communities, but it doesn&rsquo;t affect the cumulative IQ of the students.</p>

But I do remember that the nutrient in question isn&rsquo;t much found in the kind of food that you order from a plastic clown, even if you get fries with that.</p>

<p>The counter-logical and <i>prima facia</i> preposterous &#8220;study&#8221; would have been more accurately titled &#8220;No Alibi Left Behind.&#8221; It is an example of PC excuse-making at its most whimsical and unscientific, wackily untroubled either by causality or reality. The work of either an incompetent bozo or a baldfaced liar. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve said it before and I&rsquo;ll say it again.  Multiculturalism is a religion, and just as it was dangerous to advocate Copernican theories when the Catholic Church reigned supreme today it is verbotten to come to the conclusion that stares us right in the face.</p>
<p>Instead of stating the obvious we employ people at universities to explain away the correlations that any elementary school kid who has had to deal with bussing or schools full of black people would readily make.</p>

		<p>All this study proves is that low IQ black thugs and black murderers and other violent criminals live in the same black neighborhoods.</p>
