			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Allan Hall, Daily Mail (London), June 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Immigrants are making Germany &#8216;dumber&rsquo;, according to a board member of the country&rsquo;s central bank.</p>
<p>Thilo Sarrazin claimed the &#8216;limited education&rsquo; of immigrants  &mdash;  coupled with their high birth rate  &mdash;  meant Germans &#8216;are becoming dumber in a simple way&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;There&rsquo;s a difference in the reproduction of population groups with varying intelligence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is not the first time the 65-year-old member of the Bundesbank has caused controversy since he joined last year.</p>
<p>In October he described Muslim children as &#8216;underclass&rsquo; citizens.</p>
<p>&#8216;I don&rsquo;t have to accept someone who lives off a state they reject, doesn&rsquo;t properly take care of the education of his children-and keeps producing more little girls in headscarves,&rsquo; Mr Sarrazin said.</p>
<p>&#8216;That goes for 70 percent of the Turkish and 90 percent of the Arabic population of Berlin.&rsquo; He added that they were not fit for much other than &#8216;fruit and vegetable selling&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In his latest speech this week he said there were &#8216;ample statistics&rsquo; proving he was correct about German intelligence.</p>
<p>He went on to say that in particular immigrants from &#8216;Turkey, the Middle East and Africa&rsquo; were less educated.</p>
<p>Because immigrants tend to have more children than Germans  &mdash;  who have the lowest birth rate in Europe  &mdash;  this caused &#8216;a different propagation of population groups with different intelligence because parents pass their intelligence on to their children&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Mr Sarrazin, who was previously Germany&rsquo;s finance minister, has not yet apologised. It is thought his position at the Bundesbank may now be untenable.</p>
<p>A spokesman for a Muslim group in Berlin said: &#8216;He is a tired old white Christian male full of prejudice and few ideas.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But among conservatives in Germany his comments have struck a chord.</p>
<p>They have voiced concern that the country&rsquo;s three million Turks tend to live in their own communities, socialise among each other and have little in common with their German neighbours.<br>

		<p>There are different angles to take on what is, as Jared Taylor might say, transparently true. It could simply be a matter of educating Muslims in Germany - a process greatly aided by Muslims wanting to learn. It&rsquo;s not necessarily a racial issue. It also may be true that those who really are less intelligent are having the greatest number of children. Again not necessarily a racial issue - though an issue for all races. </p>
<p>I fear the problem wont be solved until Muslims are so well-educated as to be taking jobs from liberals. Then liberal elites might decide to respond to immigration. Perhaps Germans should stay tuned and watch what happens to their elite comrades in SA, England and the USA?</p>

		<p>Thilo Sarrazin is a German phenomenon.<br>
What he says is &#8220;racist&#8221; but it doesn&rsquo;t matter how hard the media try it, they can&rsquo;t put him down for two reasons:<br>
1.) He has statistics made by the government. And he uses them.<br>
2.) The Internet Blogger: No matter which magazine or news paper wants to put him down, they get thousands of bad comments because the German people really agree with him.</p>
<p>To understand that as a US citizen you have to know that Germans didn&rsquo;t brought slaves here. This people are not black. Liberals brought them here for more diversity and to fix the lack of kids. But instead they make to many kids who do not want to go to school (school is for free), and if they go they only make problems, insult the teachers and fight the whites and use the race card whenever they can. They totally dump down classes. Teachers are praying to get into a white only class. <br>
There are only negative effects of immigrations. Liberals and media tried really hard to show positive effects but don&rsquo;t find any. So the only thing they do is blaming whitey and saying it wouldn&rsquo;t be as bad as the people think.  </p>

<p>But, worst of all to this Muslim, he knows he&rsquo;s right on&hellip;&hellip;AND HE IS.</p>
<p>If he&rsquo;s a tired old white Christian, then what do we call the Muslims who hate their own countries so badly they are CONSTANTLY fleeing to the ends of the earth into any country stupid enough to allow them entry?</p>

		<p>It is ridiculous that the writer so presumptuously aserts, &#8220;Mr Sarrazin, who was previously Germany&rsquo;s finance minister, has not yet apologised. It is thought his position at the Bundesbank may now be untenable.&#8221; He seems to think its inevitable Mr. Sarrazin will apologise. Perhaps Allan Hall thinks any of the Muslim daughters in scarves who sell vegetables could replace Mr. Sarrazin at the Bundesbank. </p>
<p>But of course Mr. Sarrazin is right. Germany remains the most intelligent country in the world, the one that is at the engineering and scientific forefront; its universities still provide excellence in the disciplines of philosophy, language, music and economics. They have not yet been debilitated or diluted by accountancy courses for hordes of Chinese, or hospitality for Indians, or soft subjects like women&rsquo;s studies, or indigenous studies, or queer studies. Germany is lucky it never acquired much of and empire, like Britain or France, or was beset by squawking indigenous tribes, that deny the benefits brought by the west as in Australia; or by the US descendants of slaves, unwilling to grant that they are better off than their cousins who were left behind in Nigeria, or returned to build a failed paradise in Liberia.  So Germany&rsquo;s mind is still strong, and if the Germans listen to the likes of Mr. Sarrazin, maybe they can retain German strength of mind.</p>
<p>A world without traditional German intelligence could be a world that has lost its mind.</p>

<p>Thus, making Herr Sarrazin&rsquo;s point for him. Need I say more?</p>
<p>Well, I would guess that I do!</p>
<p>These Muslims in Germany are mostly Turks, who once lived in the Ottoman Empire. They are not ex-German slaves, but former allies in World War I, who committed hideous atrocities against Armenian Christians following that war. Yet, they remain what they were and are: anti-European, anti-Christian, and Anti-Western. Any who do not see this in Germany or the West as whole are wretched fools. Moreover, any who do not see the &ldquo;accepting&rdquo; and self-serving sedition that embraces Islam on the Left in the West, as nothing but  the work of institutionalized traitors, are not even worth calling abject sub-imbeciles.</p>
<p>The hope in this article, is to be found in this sentence: &ldquo;But among conservatives in Germany his comments have struck a chord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed and it should; thus, may God allow it to continue to be so and grow there!!!</p>

		<p>One old white Christian male is worth more than a country full of muslims. Name a single idea or innovation coming from the ethnic Turks in their entire history beneficial to humanity. Any high points they might point to are traceable to the efforts of captive minorities, some of whom converted to islam. They have a huge amount of brass moving to a country then criticizing the natives living there. So quit coming already, stay in your muslim paradise.    </p>

<p>Incorrect.  The ethnic cleansing against the Armenians occured during the Ottoman Empire&rsquo;s time in the beginning of the First World War.  However, they were not killed because they were Christians, they were killed because Turkey feared their alliance with Russia against Germany, Turkey&rsquo;s ally.  </p>

		<p>About time someone had the balls to state the obvious - the Middle-East and Africa are not intellectual wastelands for nothing. People make a nation, and low-IQ immigration is a terrible drain on the German nation. Richard Lynn has set the mean German IQ at between 102 and 107. The Turkish mean IQ is 90, and the sub-Saharan African mean IQ is around 70. You don&rsquo;t have to be a mathematical genius to determine that Sarrazin is absolutely correct. Europe is heading down the path toward intellectual decline and cultural and economic stagnation.   </p>

		<p>Mr. Thilo Sarrazin is right that most of Germany&rsquo;s immigration has not raised the intellectual or cultural level of the country.  Alas, the situation is even worst in the United States where so many of our recent immigrants are uneducated Third Worlders. The Turks, despite their drawbacks, are at least white and from a historically advanced civilization  &mdash;   we can&rsquo;t say that about &#8220;our&#8221; Somalis, Guatemalans, Hondurans, Nigerians, Sudanese, etc. etc.</p>

<p>&#8220;All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self-evident&#8221;; a quote that most readers of AmRen are very familiar with.</p>
<p>As other posters here have pointed out, Germany has produced brilliant scientists, artists and philosophers.  Immigration is both absurd and destructive.  I thought Germany would have been the last country to have jumped on the PC wagon but alas, this is a very virulent virus that has infected all of the Western world.</p>

<p>There was a well known (and quite beautiful)female television anchor in Germany who, about 2 yrs. ago, made the unfortunate comment that the nazis at least had a strong family program (which they did). She was immediately yanked off the air and hasn&rsquo;t been heard of since. Her career was instantly over.  It was even mentioned here on AR.  (Of course they did have a strong family program, but true or not, you can&rsquo;t say that in Germany. You probably  couldn&rsquo;t say the weather was nice under the Nazis. Ruinous to a career!) </p>

		<p>How sad for Germany, that before WWII they lamented how completely Jews had assimilated into their country - even Admiral Raeder has a mischling son in law whom helpd escape from the contry. (Testimony from the Admiral himself can be found in the Nurenburg transcripts, and is probably on the web ) . Now, they have Turks who refuse to integrate.

However, they were not killed because they were Christians, they were killed because Turkey feared their alliance with Russia against Germany, Turkey&rsquo;s ally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sorry, but while what you write is partially true, the Armenian genocide both lasted beyond the war&rsquo;s end and was not devoid of all anti-Christian sentiments. Indeed, while there was fear on the Ottomans&rsquo; part that the subjugated Armenians would revolt against them for independence with enough Triple Entente support (as had the Greeks and Bulgarians prior to the war) this calculation also included the fact, that they were Christians with eager Christian allies in that European power bloc. It is sort of chicken versus egg, but please consider that the Arabs also were not without thoughts of independence during the war, encouraged by England in particular, and were never subjected to the same kind of methodical annihilation. </p>
<p>There the chickens are birds of a feather, I would say!</p>
<p>All the best to you Whiteplight, John PM!!!</p>

<p>What would make you think a thing like that, anyway?  After WW2 the pathogen known as &#8216;multi-culturalism&rsquo; was literally rammed down Germany&rsquo;s throat (after it was partitioned)!  It started with the stationing of black soldiers by the U.S. in West Germany and Central Asiatic soldiers by the Soviets in East Germany.  The Germans had no say in this matter.  As with the Italians, they were occupied by their enemies and at their mercy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think even most AmReners can appreciate how much racial damage the United States of America has done to the White Western world.  Example: it was the U.S. that put pressure on Iceland to abandon its racialist policies excluding blacks from setting foot in that country.  I hate saying this, but this country has been a vector in spreading much evil over this planet.</p>

<p>I disagree with this entirely. Europeans etc. are fully capable and responsible for making their own decisions and it&rsquo;s not the  USA&rsquo;s fault what the rest of the Western world did or does. The rest of the Western world did what they did in regards to race because of socialism/marxism and their own naivete. They had no peoples of color so they had no understanding what would happen if they opened their borders. THAT is why the rest of the Western world opened its&rsquo; border, not because of the USA.</p>

 &#8220;After WW2 the pathogen known as &lsquo;multi-culturalism&rsquo; was literally rammed down Germany&rsquo;s throat (after it was partitioned)! It started with the stationing of black soldiers by the U.S. in West Germany and Central Asiatic soldiers by the Soviets in East Germany. The Germans had no say in this matter. As with the Italians, they were occupied by their enemies and at their mercy.  I don&rsquo;t think even most AmReners can appreciate how much racial damage the United States of America has done to the [entire] White Western World.&#8221;   &mdash;   Anon.@9:51PM</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Absolutely correct!  After WW 2, the other countries (of Western Europe, at least) were restored to their own governance. In almost every one of them, Marxist/socialist governments [communist lite]  came to power, determined that they would radically change their societies to cure them of &#8220;the illness of nationalism&#8221;.  This  course they chose voluntarily.  But Germany and Italy were occupied countries whose surrender was unconditional.  They had no choice about their fate, though Italy was treated more leniently. The Germans were subjected to programs of severe re-education.  They were indoctrinated with guilt that remains strong today. (Even in the Netherlands, as much as 1/3 of the population spent time under arrest or being &#8220;re-educated&#8221;.) Germans were in no position to talk  back. They were, and still are, an occupied country. The Soviet bases in the East are gone, as is the Soviet Union, but the American bases are still there   &mdash;   65 years after the end of the war! (I am not sure about the British bases   &mdash;   perhaps someone can help me on that).  To date, no peace treaty has ever been signed. Thus, technically, Germany is still an occupied country.</p>
<p>&#8220;The pathogen known as multiculturalism&#8221; was indeed rammed down their throats   &mdash;   in a way that Americans have never experienced. Marxists such as Max Horkheimer of the Frankfurt School (who rode out the war in New York and California) returned to Germany to pursue a program of re-indoctrination.   </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand that the Frankfurt School holds all nationalism or prejudice (which they equate) to be manifestations of mental illness, and that nationalism is  merely a form of  fascism. Thus, to them, any manifestation of  national or racial pride is an illness that must be cured.  So it was determined that the entire country  was ill and had to be subjected to an intensive program of mass mental  therapy.</p>
<p>The modern guilt-filled, self-hating, de-racinated  German is the result. The other countries of Western Europe chose the milder Marxist course, more or less voluntarily, but in Germany there was no choice   &mdash;   it was imposed on a helpless, starving population by the occupiers at bayonet point.</p>

 &#8220;I think the problem is that most germans who would rather die fighting than disappear into the night did just that during World War 2. <br>
What you have left is a population of people without a spine.&#8221;    &mdash;   #24 Anon.@4:19AM</p>

The brave ones disappeared during the war?  I must disagree with you on that. This malaise doesn&rsquo;t apply just to Germans.  How do you explain the fact that this passivity affects all of Western Europe?  It is the case (and very much so!) even in Sweden which was not involved in the war at all. Where did all the brave Swedes disappear? </p>
