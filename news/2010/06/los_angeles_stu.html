			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jana Winter, Fox News, June 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Los Angeles Unified School District school board wants all public school students in the city to be taught that Arizona&rsquo;s new immigration law is un-American.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The school board voted unanimously on Tuesday to &#8220;express outrage&#8221; and &#8220;condemnation&#8221; of the law, and it called on the school superintendent to look into curtailing economic support to the Grand Canyon State. About 73 percent of the students in the school district are Latino.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This is ridiculous, it&rsquo;s ridiculous for us to be involved in Arizona law,&#8221; said Jane Barnett, Chairman, Los Angeles County Republican Party. &#8220;There is a 50 percent dropout rate in some parts of the school district  &mdash;  is this going to keep kids in school?&#8221;</p>
<p>According to its press release, &#8220;The Los Angeles Board of Education also requested that Superintendent Ramon Cortines ensure that civics and history classes discuss the recent laws with students in the context of the American values of unity, diversity and equal protection for all people.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In an e-mail to FOXNews.com, school district spokesman Robert Alaniz elaborated:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Board of Education directed the Superintendent to ensure that LAUSD civics and history classes discuss the recent laws enacted in Arizona in the context of the American values of unity, diversity, and Equal Protection for all. Much like a number of controversial periods and laws that are part of our history and are currently taught including:</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Slavery</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Jim Crowe laws and segregation</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Native American reservations</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Residential schools (for Native Americans)</p>
<p>  &mdash;  The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Anti-Irish racism in the 19th century</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Racism against immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe in the 20th century</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Anti-Semitism</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Internment camps for Japanese Americans during World War II</p>
<p>  &mdash;  The Mexican Repatriation Program (1929-1939).&#8221;</p>
<p>The school district resolution also opposed another new Arizona law that bans schools from teaching classes that promote the overthrow of the government or advocate ethnic solidarity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The board said the laws &#8220;effectively sanction and promote unconstitutional racial profiling and harassment,&#8221; and &#8220;blatantly violate the civil rights of both Arizona residents and all visitors to the State.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to do everything in our power to help our students be global citizens, develop appreciation for the diversity in our midst, and reject any forms of racism or bias,&#8221; said Board Vice President Yolie Flores. &#8220;This resolution highlights our commitment to ensuring that our students understand the ideals and constitutional rights that this great country is founded on, while also gaining an appreciation of the histories and cultural contributions of those who have helped build this nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a sad day in America when the rights guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution are trampled upon under the color of law and authority,&#8221; said LAUSD Board Member Martinez. &#8220;Everyone, regardless of their status in the United States, has the right to equal protection under our laws. These Arizona laws are nothing but a knee-jerk backlash resulting from the lack of a comprehensive and well thought out immigration reform policy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nathan Mintz, the founder of the South Bay Tea Party and the Republican nominee for the 53rd State Assembly seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is just another example of these embedded bureaucrats in California doing anything they can to deflect and distract from the poor job their doing of educating our children,&#8221; said Nathan Mintz, the founder of the South Bay Tea Party and the Republican nominee for the 53rd State Assembly seat.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s one for the philosophers among you:  If a school district teaches that a given law is un-American, yet there are virtually no American students in the district, is the law really un-American?</p>

		<p>Why is that peoples of color only demand &#8220;civil rights&#8221; entitlements boldly and relentlessly when allowed to live in the USA.  But they dare not speak or stand up for these same demands in their own country of origin.</p>
<p>Peoples of color come here for the welfare and standard of living not to make this country better as reflected by the latino school drop out rate of 50%!  They do not have the inherent ability to understand nor maintain the high ideals that founded this country.  This country&rsquo;s future is fated to be a Third World country once the whites drop below a critical mass ratio of about 30%.  Where ever the black and brown races become the majority in a community, crime and degradation is the norm which is reflected in their countries of origin.  </p>

		<p>People who are here breaking the law (such as entering the country illegaly) do not have equal rights.  Teaching  the list of subject above leaves little time for the 3-Rs.  Maybe that is why they have such a high drop-out rate.</p>

		<p>How is it when someone is here illegally his rights are somehow violated if he is detained for deportation but a white person who is beaten and nearly murdered by minorities screaming racial slurs is not a victim of a hate crime? Is this not an example of a violation of &#8220;equal protection under the law&#8221;?</p>

		<p>No one should have any doubt at this point in time that there is very large Mexican-Hispanic fifth column in America. It should be very easy to identify it for mass deportation. The situation is totally out of control.</p>
<p>Southern California is a parched-brown landscape-basically a desert on life support. A cordon-sanitaire policy towards Southern California will help speed up the self-deportation process.</p>
<p>We have a bunch of Hispanic foreigners telling the Native Born White American majority that they are now foreigners in America. Outrageous isn&rsquo;t it folks.</p>
<p>The Republican-Democratic consensus that has a stranglehold on American politics is doomed. It won&rsquo;t last much longer. When a critical number of native born white Americans withdraw support from it&hellip;there will be very big changes. Very soon, it will no longer be possible to deny the obvious that America no longer exists. White Americans will ask the million dollar question:which Republican and Democratic politicians were responsible for the loss of huge amount of White American territory.  There will be very strong accusations of treason. Around 99.9 percent of Republican and Democrat politicians will be accused of treason. Their legitimacy to govern will come to an end.</p>

<p>In Buffalo public schools, the failure rate for blacks is 53% and blacks are pushing for &#8216;African Immersion&rsquo; classes.</p>
<p>We all know public schools have nothing to do with learning. They&rsquo;re only concerned with indoctrination.<br>

		<p>This is no more than the actions of a bunch of ignorant mestrizos, hurting their children with hate propaganda.  Added to the hate that is already there from their current teaching of propaganda these same stooges put out about lack of mestizo accomplishment being the result of white racism and oppression, and voila!  The drop out rate grows from 50% to 60% and the prison incarceration rates go up also.</p>
<p>This is an excellent example of why mestizos fail in every country south of the border, especially Mexico.  They just constantly make one bad decision after another.</p>
<p>Of course, these pitiful backward people think they&rsquo;re getting back at whitey with this silly propaganda scheme, unaware it will hurt them far more than anything else.</p>
<p>6 months ago they were informed that they would have to cut back to 4 days per week, with a substantial pay reduction or face layoffs of 8500 teachers.</p>
<p>An update recently revealed that the present situation has deteriorated due to an unexpected drop in revenue and the 2011 school year now looks twice as bad than when the report first came out in Nov. of 2009. </p>
<p>With drop out rates growing, and racial riots in the schools continuing unabated between blacks and mestizos, and the probability of laying off about 30% more teachers and others than orginally expected, wouldn&rsquo;t a person think that their problems are so enormous that attempting petty little racial schemes would be unimportant by comparison?</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t of course, because they come from a failed people and failed nations that cannot compete in a first world society, nor can they maintain one, which they are making abundantly clear by this latest nonsense.</p>
<p>California will be the first to disintegrate.</p>

		<p>This is what they are being taught about white people. Come to think of it, this is what I was taught about white people in the public schools of the 1980s.</p>
<p>-Slavery</p>
<p>Is universal and still exists in many parts of the world but is taught as if only whites had slaves</p>
<p> &mdash; Jim Crowe laws and segregation</p>
<p>Jim Crow bad, affirmative action good.</p>
<p> &mdash; Native American reservations</p>
<p>No reservations allowed to preserve white culture.</p>
<p> &mdash; Residential schools (for Native Americans)</p>
<p>Residential schools and values are great unless we are talking about white residences and values.</p>
<p> &mdash; The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882</p>
<p>No mention of the Chinese immigration policy which limits immigration to ethnic Chinese.</p>
<p> &mdash; Anti-Irish racism in the 19th century</p>
<p>They ain&rsquo;t talking about blacks robbing, raping and murdering poor Irish kids.</p>
<p> &mdash; Racism against immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe in the 20th century</p>
<p>Same as with the Irish. Only whites can be racist.</p>
<p> &mdash; Anti-Semitism</p>
<p>Again, same thing. No mention of black or Muslim anti-Semitism.</p>
<p> &mdash; Internment camps for Japanese Americans during World War II</p>
<p>Of course, no mention of the fact that more Italians and Germans wer interned than Japanese.</p>
<p> &mdash; The Mexican Repatriation Program (1929-1939).&rdquo;</p>
<p>No mention of the racist Mexican immigration policy.<br>

		<p>At Taco Bell you&rsquo;re asked if you&rsquo;d like to donate a dollar to help more students graduate.</p>
<p>Um, excuse me&hellip;?  Isn&rsquo;t this another instance of just throwing money at the problem, instead of seeing things as they really are?</p>
<p>Needless to say, I gave a firm &#8220;NO.&#8221;</p>
<p>They already leech off the taxpayers, now they&rsquo;re mooching everywhere.</p>
<p>Seems to me that the kids that aren&rsquo;t graduating are the ones who couldn&rsquo;t care less about &#8220;edumacation&#8221; anyway.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s fine for classes to DISCUSS any law, but teaching anti-American rebelliousness is way beyond the pale.  Of course, most of the Mexican aliens and, apparently, many Mexican-Americans in these schools already want the reconquista.  <br>
If a Mexican is here illegally, he is already a criminal and knows it.  Many of these criminals kill with less forethought than the vast majority of ghetto lawbreakers.  The former are invaders, and Americans of all ethnicities are the enemy.  They feel free and justified in robbing, raping, and slaughtering the foe, and they do it day after day!  Only those safe in their ivory towers can possibly not see it. </p>

		<p>     I think what we are seeing with this action by the Los Angeles school board is the beginning of the breaking up of the United States.  We are beginning to see, with the Arizona law, that different parts of the country do not only disagree with one another, but also enact laws that contradict one another and seem outlandish to one another.  Maybe it&rsquo;s for the best.  </p>

		<p>&ldquo;It is a sad day in America when the rights guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution are trampled upon under the color of law and authority,&rdquo; said LAUSD Board Member Martinez. &ldquo;Everyone, regardless of their status in the United States, has the right to equal protection under our laws.  </p>
<p><br>
Clause 2: Protection from invasion and domestic violence<br>
&ldquo; [&hellip;] and [The United States] shall protect each of them [the States] against Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened) against domestic Violence. &rdquo; </p>
<p>Section Four requires the United States to protect each state from invasion, and, upon the application of the state legislature (or executive, if the legislature cannot be convened), from domestic violence.  &mdash;  Article IV US Constitution. </p>
<p>All the rights except those in Article IV, right Martinez??<br>

		<p>The schools&rsquo; job is to teach FACTS. Not opinions, not political agendas. FACTS. I would yank my child out of the public school system so fast&hellip; By adopting this policy what they&rsquo;re actually teaching is that it is not necessary to adhere to any law in the United States - no reason to respect authority about anything. This country is sooo doomed.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Forget about the 50 percent drop-out rate &mdash; this is what&rsquo;s important.&#8221;</p>
<p>With these people race comes first, last and always, over and above every single thing that occurs around them. </p>
<p>California is falling to ruin specifically, because they are now in the majority, especially in Southern California.  Their intellect and overall abilities are just a wee bit above blacks, but they share the same &#8220;race-above&#8221; everything&#8221; instinct that  blacks do.  &#8220;LA RAZA!&#8221;  The &#8220;Race&#8221; is their whole world.</p>
<p>It is an interesting phenomenon that blacks, mestizos and other low intellects on this earth are ones that have the largest instinct for survival, the very people humankind needs fewer of.</p>
<p>But nature has a way of trying to compensate for an organism&rsquo;s intense desire to survive at all costs, if the organism is lacking in assets that are vital to its survival.  It&rsquo;s a kind of &#8220;add-on&#8221; to the &#8220;survival of the fittest&#8221; that culls the weakest from the species pool.  </p>
<p>It appears that nature gave blacks and mestizos this instinct to a greater intensity than whites and some Asians in order to compensate for their inate inability to compete on a higher intelligence level.</p>
<p>Nature&rsquo;s injecting a desire for unity to a higher degree in some species will compensate for some of the losses they suffer due to lack of intelligence.  A higher birth rate helps also.</p>
<p>When this unity desire becomes weak for whatever reason, or is overcome by outside forces of some type, the species dies out and becomes extinct.  For example, if these same mestizos were dependent upon themselves and ONLY themselves for survival, they would be quickly headed for mass extinction, because they&rsquo;ve dropped everything important and concentrated instead on matters of little consequence to their immediate needs.  If they were not under the wing of the white power structure, so to speak, they would continue with this kind of lack of focus on matters of greater importance and concentrate instead on items that allow them to give vent to their childish rage.  No civilization like that can endure in the long run.</p>

		<p>When I was in government school the teachers knew that their job was to teach students HOW to think.</p>
<p>Today in government school the teachers know that their job is to teach students WHAT to think.</p>
<p>This is why we have a generation of government school graduates most of whom have never experienced an independent thought and are incapable of making correct change for a dollar.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been spoon fed anti-American communist doctrine from kindergarten, pumped full of self-esteem delusions, and are totally unprepared to face life in the real world.</p>

		<p>From the LA Times yesterday:</p>
<p>&#8216;&hellip;Nearly 60% in California high schools are not proficient despite more than six years of a U.S. education. Flaws in the English-language programs could imperil the state&rsquo;s economic future, report says&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>As this IS from the LA Times, the blame is placed solely on the deficiencies of the &#8216;English-language programs&rsquo;, despite White US taxpayers having spent trillions of dollars, for over three decades, on these worthless program.</p>
<p>The inherent &#8216;flaws&rsquo; of lazy, IQ deficient, disinterested students and their illiterate &#8216;immigrant&rsquo; parents are never held accountable.  You can be sure there will loud calls from racial activists screaming for trillions more White money to be poured into &#8216;more studies&rsquo; and more worthless race-specific programs.</p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip; Superintendent Ramon Cortines [to] ensure that civics and history classes discuss the recent laws with students in the context of the American values of unity, diversity and equal protection for all people&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Not true.  Civics and history classes teach ONLY &#8216;people of color&rsquo; deserve &#8216;protection&rsquo; under the law  &mdash;  protection from White Oppressors and White Slavers living illegally on &#8216;stolen land&rsquo; who want to take non-Whites &#8216;back to the days of Jim Crow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I have a new American Literature textbook sitting in front of me right now.  The first selection is &#8220;The Iroquois Constitution&#8221; (remember, according to rewritten history, the US Constitution was &#8216;stolen&rsquo; from the peaceful gaia-loving Iroquois).  Next selection:  &#8220;The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano&#8221;, written in the  first person by an extremely well educated, literate, well versed slave about being dragged to America chained, starved and beaten by White slavers.</p>
<p>These are the first two readings  &mdash;  a far cry from the old McGruffy readers I&rsquo;d say or the old American Lit textbooks I own from the 60s which feature letters from Robert E. Lee to his son and refer to the WBTS as the WBTS.</p>
<p>American education has become a non-White grievance industry  &mdash;  with the grievances targeted solely at Whites.  I believe the educational system is being used to set non-Whites against Whites for genocide and to educate White children that it is their job to accept their displacement and dispossession.    </p>
<p>Remember:  In ed schools these days the two &#8216;bibles&rsquo; are &#8216;Pedagogy of the Oppressed&rsquo; and &#8216;To Teach: The Journey of a Teacher&rsquo; by bomber bill ayers who also authored  &#8220;Race Course:  Against White Supremacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again:  Get your precious White children out of the White-hating educational gulag, do it now and don&rsquo;t look back.  Homeschool your kids if at all possible, many churches in my area are forming homeschooling coalitions for parents who work and there are more and more fully accredited K-12 schools that can be accessed on line.</p>

<p>That depends on whether you believe the LAUSD&rsquo;s own figure (26.4%), the state of California&rsquo;s figure (34.9%)  &mdash;   (which showed a jump of nearly 10 percent from the year before)  or the following:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;According to the nonpartisan publication Education Week with support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, just 44 percent of Los Angeles Unified students receive a high school diploma.</p>
<p>Harvard University estimated that LAUSD&rsquo;s graduation rate is 48 percent&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d put my money on Harvard and Education Week over the state and LAUSD&rsquo;s own figures.</p>
<p>The LAUSD is under tremendous pressure to reduce the non-White drop-out rate,  and &#8216;make disappear&rsquo; the huge graduation gap between Whites/Asians and blacks/hispanics.</p>
<p>Steve Sailer writes in &#8220;The Real Graduation Rate&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The true high school graduation rate is substantially lower than the official rate issued by the National Center for Educational Statistics.</p>
<p>The high school dropout rate has improved little since the passage of the No Child Left Behind act in 2001&hellip;.In fact, we find no evidence of convergence in minority-majority graduation rates over the past 35 years.</p>
<p>The federal government&rsquo;s measure of high school graduation is biased by counting as graduates those dropouts who subsequently pass the GED test.</p>
<p> GED recipients lack noncognitive skills such as perseverance and motivation that are essential to success in school and in life.</p>
<p>Indeed, over 10 percent of all GEDs are earned in prison&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And of course, none of these reports mention that the entire curricula has been tremendously dumbed down over the past three decades precisely to make it easier for blacks and hispanics to graduate.  </p>
<p>The graduation gap is intractable and it&rsquo;s far past time to stop wasting massive amounts of White tax monies trying to graduate those whose reading and computing levels top out around the fourth grade.  The average hispanics or blacks that does manage to graduate high school reads and computes at an 8th grade level.</p>

<p>Better yet, let&rsquo;s put a stop to massive non-White immigration (illegal OR legal) and stop wasting White tax money on low skilled, low IQd, (r)-driven populations that don&rsquo;t look like us but demand that we pay for their children&rsquo;s educations (in futility) at the expense of our own.</p>

<p>A row out of Texas a few weeks ago showed another way districts are fudging the dropout rate downward:  Pretending that a lot of dropouts are being home schooled.</p>
<p>Also out of Texas, specifically Dallas:</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s also un-American to aid and abett illegal aliens. To disregard U.S. laws because it doesn&rsquo;t suit you is also un-American. So, where are we going with this?</p>

		<p>Perhaps the Unified School District will be able to teach this material with more success than they&rsquo;ve had teaching basic reading and mathematics skills.  Perhaps, but since the typical graduate of this system can only read and write well enough to understand the average 30-second television commercial, I very much doubt it.</p>
