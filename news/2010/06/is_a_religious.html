			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Judith Woods, London Telegraph, June 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On two occasions last week my dog was barred from London buses, not because she&rsquo;s particularly fierce or big, but on religious grounds. A friend and I had taken her to the park, and as I went across to the grocer, my friend took Daisy, a Manchester terrier, to the bus stop.</p>
<p>As they tried to board the bus, the driver stopped her and told her that there was a Muslim lady on the bus who &#8220;might be upset by the dog&#8221;. As she attempted to remonstrate, the doors closed and the bus drew away.</p>
<p>When a second bus arrived, she again made to embark, but was stopped again  &mdash;  this time because the driver said he was Muslim. I know that Muslims consider dogs to be unclean, but last time I looked this wasn&rsquo;t a Muslim country and London Transport was a non-denominational organisation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Catholic, but I&rsquo;m hardly likely to start insisting that no divorced people should be allowed on my bus. I have no intention of causing upset with my dog and I wouldn&rsquo;t allow her to brush against anyone who was at pains to avoid her. None the less, I instinctively cavil at this creeping intolerance, masquerading as pious devotion, whatever its origins.<br>

		<p>  Yes, the Prophet did consider dogs unclear. He allowed them for hunting or as watch dogs, but the notion of a &#8220;pet&#8221; dog would have been unthinkable to him. For some reason, Mohammad disliked black dogs the most  &mdash;  so beware you Black Lab lovers! On the other hand, the Prophet Mohammad was very fond of cats.  We know this mostly from the Hadith, or sayings of the Prophet.  Obviously, this is a shock to the British, a nation of dog lovers. </p>

		<p>Hard to understand why the dog owner is complaining, it can&rsquo;t be a surprise to anyone that there are severe consequences to opening your borders to people who don&rsquo;t share any of your beliefs or customs. It&rsquo;s ironic that our own laws will be the tools used to bring about the destruction of out society,  to be replaced by a new and improved 3rd world society. I wonder if it will be as hard for us to adapt to living in a 3rd world culture as it was for the 3rd worlders to attempt to live in ours. Better not get to attached to your dog! </p>

		<p>If it is permissable to take pets on busses, trollies and trains in the UK then the bus drivers in question should be fired.  End of story.</p>
<p>Now, there are a lot of things Muslims don&rsquo;t like.  Should we require all woman to cover their faces when out in public or visible from the street?  I would suppose that public beheadings of gays should start as quickley as possible.  And what to do with the Jews?  Their existence offends Muslims.  Oh my, we need to eradicate the pig population as well.</p>
<p>Where do we stop in the accomodation of aliens over our own people?  Eviction is the only solution.</p>

		<p>This article asks the wrong question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not if this is &#8220;right&#8221; or not.  What Brits should be asking themselves is why they do not have a say in such things.</p>
<p>Intolerance is something that people who get to have a say may choose to or not choose to engage in.  That the muslim is the one who makes this decision, says something very serious about Britain, its people and its government.</p>
<p>This woman is, in fact, a dhimmi.  A second class citizen in a muslim dominated land.  The fact that muslims did not have to use force, to create this situation shows the extreme cowardice and sickness of the british people.  Both incidents on the bus should have provoked fights.  White males should have insisted the woman be allowed to ride with her dog.  Should have forced the muslims off the bus, if they had a problem with it.  Should have insisted both drivers, both the muslim and the non-muslim, lose their jobs over this.</p>
<p>They did not.  And because of that choice, the result is they are dhimmis&hellip;..very close to becoming slaves.  This is much more serious than simple cowardice.  A white man who did this has real fear of being attacked by other whites. Of going to jail under Britains insane hate crime laws.  This is far, FAR beyond individuals choosing not to fight for their own well being.<br>

		<p>I concur. Our western civilization is in trouble. To any one with half a brain, the adherents of the &#8220;religion of peace&#8221; and their wacky ideology is simply not compatible with any civilized nation be it in North America, Asia, Europe or my native Israel. Talking about the Islamization and dhimmi attitude of liberals in the west, here&rsquo;s an interesting video by Pat Condell regarding the proposed building of a mosque near ground zero (NY) :</p>

		<p>Please I am being serious here. The prophet Mohamed was in fact a Cat lover. So I can say that maybe that is why he hated dogs. I had a dog that killed at least 5 cats. So look it up on the net. As far as I am concerned this makes Islam a Cult. BTW  I read somewhere that Iran has placed a Fatwa upon dog owners along with Salmon Rushdie.</p>

		<p>You know, folks better start taking this sort of thing seriously.  Just extrapolate 15 or 20 years down the road.  If it&rsquo;s like this now, what is it going to be like then?  The British people in the 1960&rsquo;s were at the forefront of the sex, drugs and rock-and-roll culture.  They were &#8220;tolerant&#8221; of everything under the sun. Now, I think, they are beginning to see where all of that was leading.  It was leading to destruction.  These Muslims have no concern for British or White culture.  The British are so incredibly weak now as a people, and the tragic thing is that most of them can&rsquo;t even see it themselves.  If this continues, there&rsquo;s no doubt that down the road there will be an incredible amount of bloodshed and violence in not just England, but all over Europe, because this is not just occurring in England but in other countries as well.  They must get a grip on reality - and soon.</p>

<p>Then, IS it permissible? Or is it NOT?  Is there an official policy on this?  What is needed is an articulate statement on the matter. And that should be the end of that. </p>
<p>However, given the large Moslem presence in Britain, and the apparent dread of &#8220;offending&#8221; them, such an articulated official policy  is not likely to be forthcoming anytime soon, as all officials duck for cover and desperatly CYA.</p>

		<p>One wonders why the Brits resisted German domination so vigorously but yet have resigned themselves to Muslim domination. Islam is not very different from the Nazi philosophy at least when it comes to Jews and Homosexuals.  I also think that they seem to enjoy killing as much as did the devoted Nazis.</p>
<p>Mein Kampf was a bestseller in the Middle East; in fact better even than in the Vaterland.  Most Germans were compelled to have a copy whereas Muslims ( Arabs) bought it willingly.  They apparently hated Jews even before the reestablishment of Israel.</p>

		<p>Perhaps the British could set up some kind of apartheid system, with ghettos (called casbahs) for the Moslems, where they would not have to fear offense from dogs, Jews, &#8220;immodest&#8221; women, bars, or churches.  There they could practice sharia law to their hearts&rsquo; content, with all the beheadings, honor killings, rapes, tortures, beatings, and female circumcism they desire.  <br>
As for dogs, they have been with humans since the caves, and any society that even partially bans them is a sick, sick society.  I would suggest that the British acquire even more dogs.</p>

		<p>Here in Sweden, it has become quite common for young women to say they have a dog with them, when they call for a taxi.<br>
That way they know it won&rsquo;t be a muslim driver, radically decreasing the risk of sexual harassment or even rape.</p>

<p>  A dog, being an unclean animal, would have to be immediately ejected from the Mosque or more likely killed by the faithful for this unpardonable sacrilege. Unclean animals are not allowed in the holy places, and don&rsquo;t bring your pet in for a blessing ritual on Saint Francis Day. Immigrant-loving, British multiculturalists better by willing to curb or &ldquo;put down&rdquo; Fido. I don&rsquo;t recommend having a dog show in areas where Muslims are in the majority. It will not be well received. </p>

		<p>I suspect this dog-phobia is a cultural thing pre-dating Islam. Our Sonya has written before about Islam&rsquo;s love for animals which is allegedly written  in the Koran/hadiths. Where is there any evidence of it?  I&rsquo;d like to hear her &#8220;take&#8221; on this.   </p>
<p>An American friend of mine,  married to a Greek-American woman, has a home on Corfu (a Greek island).  He tells me the natives there  despise  dogs, and that they  are revolted to see his children playing with their dog.  They consider it especially disgusting that they allow the dog to  lick and &#8220;kiss&#8221; them.</p>
<p>The modern Greeks obviously been heavily influenced by the Turkish occupation, but also before that by centuries of other Near Easterners who predated the Turks. This is a very different scene than it was with the ancient Greeks who, like other Europeans, were close to  their dogs.   </p>
<p>In the Odyssey, in a touching scene, when Odysseus returns home  from the Trojan War after years of wandering, his loyal old dog, his one truly faithful companion now grown aged and feeble, is the only one who recognizes him and then, its long wait over,  dies at his feet. A modern Greek would have kicked the dog away.</p>

		<p>The crew of B-turret on HMS Hood who stayed at their guns to fire one last salvo as the ship went down, instead of trying to get out, wasted their lives.  The government of a UK that would allow this sort of discrimination against native Britons does not deserve the loyalty or courage of men like these.<br>

<p>It is still dangerous in the majority of the US, for muslims to engage in such behavior.  Saying something about the dog will provoke an argument&hellip;.but attempting violence will result in arrest, often lethal self-defense.  That&rsquo;s the difference between the US and Britain (and Canada to a lesser extent).</p>

		<p>Several thoughs: First, all of God&rsquo;s creatures are filthy &amp; unclean, including us. It&rsquo;s a pretty filthy planet.  Just accept that, &amp; wash your hands now &amp; then.</p>
<p>Second: What further is there to say about any person, or group of people, who don&rsquo;t like dogs&hellip;?  Dogs are hairy litmus tests of what kind of person you are.  Even old Adolf liked his dogs. Unless someone&rsquo;s been injured by one in the past, despising dogs indicates something profoundly wrong with a person.  </p>
<p>Third: Tolerance is a 2 way street.  If you tolerate anyone who doesn&rsquo;t tolerate you back, you&rsquo;re just being bullied.  Brits need to wake up &amp; get angry or they&rsquo;ll be pushed into the gutter.</p>

<p>  You bring up an interesting point. The ancient Assyrians had large Mastiff-like fighting dogs, but I don&rsquo;t know about the other civilizations. I remember a dog recognizing the Prodigal son in the Bible and dogs also licked Jezebel&rsquo;s blood from the chariot wheels. I don&rsquo;t remember any mention of dogs in old Babylon, although I know the ancient Egyptians had dogs for both hunting and as pets.  <br>
 <br>
I think the Prophet&rsquo;s unusual aversion to black dogs may be based on an ancient occult belief that evil spirits could take that form. I recall one legend where Apollonius of Tyana reconmended that a black dog be stoned stop a plague.  Subsequently, a man/ sorcerer/demon was found under the pile of stones.  Dogs are kept in Muslim countries but the attitude is quite different than the West. <br>

		<p>Since there is no law operating in any part of the United Kingdom declaring it illegal to take one&rsquo;s dog onto a bus, it&rsquo;s down to the discretion of bus drivers whether or not to refuse boarding. </p>
<p>Public transport drivers are employed to serve the public and are expected to exercise sensible judgment regarding matters pertaining to the safety of passengers, themselves and the vehicle.  A docile animal is unlikely to present a danger unless due the arising of improbable circumstance aboard the vehicle where the animal or its owner is threatened by others and simply proceeds to defend itself or its owner. One would expect your average bus driver to know this and accordingly apply sensible judgement in favour of the dog-owner. </p>
<p>However, when bus drivers take it upon themselves to break the existing law in relation to guide dogs, they must be correctly prosecuted as was the case in the hightlighted newspaper article.  </p>
<p>It would be up to the relevant bus company to decide upon the matter of dismissal.</p>
<p>What makes cases like these so alarming, is that there are alien ethnicities domicile in the native territories of other races and ethnicities being permitted to infringe <b>their</b> human rights, AND offend <b>their</b> cultures and beliefs without censure or prosecution by making unwarranted claims that they, the alien ethnicities, find the cultures and beliefs of others offensive.</p>
<p>This type of felony clearly falls into the hate-crime category and the commencement of prosecution proceedings should never be permitted to depend solely on the ethnicity of the offender or offenders in any circumstance(s) which, in general, today is what is becoming precisely the case in increasing numbers of Western nations in favour of alien ethnicities. </p>
<p>Indigenous peoples of Europe and her enclaves as well as White people of European descent living in non-European countries, are not even included in let alone protected by human rights laws pertaining to every kind of hate-crime and this, in itself, is a crime against humanity.</p>

		<p>The British consider themselves a nation of dog-lovers, and have that reputation.  But the truth is they don&rsquo;t treat their dogs very well. I lived there for a year, and the dogs didn&rsquo;t look very happy. When they get taken for a walk, it&rsquo;s on a leash and often muzzled as well.  Dog-owners are so hemmed in by regulations that it&rsquo;s no wonder they submit to additional restrictions imposed by authority figures (like bus drivers).</p>

		<p>I personally feel us westerners are to obsessed with dogs, yes there good for leading the blind, finding drugs, etc but they can also be an annonying nuisance. The loud barking, dog mess in our parks, the disgusting smell are just a few things that offend my senses.</p>
<p>The problem as I see it is humans feel they can no longer love or trust each other so they substitute human companionship with befriending what is ultimately a dumb animal.   </p>

<p>Liberals are sure to make them very welcome. They&rsquo;re moved into neighborhoods, no matter how small the mother country may be, with people from the home country exactly like themselves, and live in virtually private communities, as a bonus, they&rsquo;re taught to celebrate and have pride in their special &#8216;vibrancy&rsquo; - pretty much all the things that it would be evil for whites to even Think about, although, there&rsquo;s still plenty of room to Actually blame whites for doing all the these thing - the ignorance, racism, hate, etc, that none whites do for real as a part of normal business, all the things that it would be &#8216;racism&rsquo;, or at the very least, &#8216;insensitivity&rsquo;, to point out non-whites are doing as part of their daily business. </p>

<p>I completely agree with your post. Britain and I would include Holland, were at the forefront of the 60&rsquo;s Sex, drugs, hedonism, and general nihilism at that time. They became ultra-liberal. I would say decadent. They also became flooded with Muslims. This was no casual coincidence. When a nation loses touch with its cultural and social roots it is walking to its doom.</p>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>Agreed.  And &#8220;decadent&#8221; is the right word.</p>
<p>They turned their backs on their own people, culture, and history, and became enamoured of gurus, maharishees, and all that. How could they possibly object to an invasion from India, the place from which all goodness and wisdom flowed?</p>
<p>An intriguiging question is &#8220;what caused this&#8221;? </p>

<p>&#8220;The loud barking&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>This is indicative of a dog that has not had good socialization when it was a puppy.</p>
<p>&#8220;dog mess in our parks&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>This is the fault of the IDIOT, IGNORANT owner who declines to pick up after his pet and properly dispose of it. Hardly the animal&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>&#8220;disgusting smell&#8221;</p>
<p>A regularly bathed and groomed dog will have less odour then many humans I have to endure on the subway every morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;dumb animal&#8221;</p>
<p>Some breeds of dogs, like Border Collies or German Sheperds are extremely intelligent.</p>
<p>Finally a dogs&rsquo; loyalty and devotion is unsurpassed.</p>
<p>The real issue here is that muslims are controlling the agenda and not the indigenous Britons.</p>

		<p>In Toronto, Canada, I telephoned for a taxi and warned them I had a dog, so they should call when the taxi was outside.  I  meant that there was a dog at the house who wouldn&rsquo;t take kindly to a stranger, the taxi driver, knocking on the door.  The taxi finally arrived and when I entered, the white driver asked &#8220;where&rsquo;s your dog?&#8221;  The taxi company thought that a dog was going to accompany me in the cab.  The white driver said he was the only one that would take the fare as all the others drivers do not like dogs.  Moral of the story, tell them you have a dog and you&rsquo;ll be assured of giving your money to a white driver.  </p>

		<p>11) Ironically most of the brits that resisted the Nazis that are still alive are sick of the way the country is now.</p>
<p>I believe there was a big thing a while back where they had multiple WW2(and possibly even a WW1) veterans in the membership.</p>

Your absolutely right in what you say, what I was condemning is the owners who believe their dogs are demi-gods who can do no wrong. There are many white people who worship their pets yet have a dislike to their own breathren, a white solidarity movement will never emerge with those sort of beliefs. An example was this wealthy Scottish woman who left millions of pounds in her will to animal welfare charities but none to childrens charities even though many scottish children live well below the official poverty line in the UK.  </p>
