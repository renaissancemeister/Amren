<h1><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/jun/15/what-makes-sikh-join-far-right">Hideously Diverse Britain: What Makes a Sikh Join the Far Right?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hugh Muir, Guardian (London), June 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Because there is one born every minute, and remembering even numbskulls are free to do what they like, it is as well not to be too easily shocked. But still one looks at Rajinder Singh, the useful idiot who implores non-whites to join the BNP, and more recently Guramit Singh, who does the same mucky job for the English Defence League, and it&rsquo;s hard not to raise an eyebrow. Both minorities. Both Sikh. How to explain?</p>
<p>I take tea and cake with Bhupinder Singh, who tells me he launched the first Sikh information website in 1994, and gently mocks my incredulity. The first thing to understand, he says, is that those two are two sausages short of a fry-up. &#8220;Most people I know are embarrassed by them. We know the BNP is against all immigrant communities of colour. And we know about the EDL. For either to be part of that, it&rsquo;s laughable really.&#8221;</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the draw in both cases? Both say they want to fight Muslim &#8220;extremism&#8221;. Risible, says Bhupinder. But that&rsquo;s not to say, he adds, that there isn&rsquo;t stuff there to be exploited. We are all different. But we are all the same. So who gets what? Tricky.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a lot of history in there, going all the way back to the partition of India in 1947. But even here and now, there is an impression many have that Muslims benefit from favouritism. Look at the London Central Mosque in Regent&rsquo;s Park. Who else has a place of worship in a royal park?&#8221;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s harmony day to day, he says; the odd flare up is inevitable, but also a general unease that the playing field isn&rsquo;t always level. &#8220;Look at all these places serving up halal,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Sikhs can&rsquo;t eat halal. Every time a KFC or a Subway goes halal, that&rsquo;s one more place that we can&rsquo;t eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s uncomfortable to hear some of this, but he doesn&rsquo;t strike me as a bigot. Rather, he seems a small &#8220;c&#8221; conservative. &#8220;We have issues sometimes; with turbans and with bangles. But at the end of the day, I just don&rsquo;t think any community should be allowed to change Britain,&#8221; he says, dismantling his muffin. &#8220;It&rsquo;s fine as it is.&#8221; Whoever says that these days?</p>

<p>Well now, there&rsquo;s a claim. Many things may be said about britain, but being &#8220;fine as it is&#8221; ? Doubtful, not after 13 years of labour.</p>

		<p>The Sikhs and Hindus in the UK are our allies.  The Muslims and Jamaicans, by contrast, are destroying this nation.  I do not want more immigration from India (because they are not my people), but the Sikhs and Hindus who ARE here legally can stay, and help us!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like that Sikhs and Hindus are helping us, I just wish idiotic whites would wake up&hellip; </p>

		<p>Hugh Muir obviously has a bias against white Britons and white nationalists, but writes as though he&rsquo;s above the fray. </p>
<p>&#8220;who says that these days?&#8221; &#8220;even numbskulls are free to do as they like&#8221; &#8220;doesn&rsquo;t strike me as a bigot&#8221; says Muir.</p>
<p>Lefty hubris will turn to shock when England&rsquo;s economy gets worse and whites shake off their brainwashed stupor.</p>

		<p>Apparently being a gracious guest is frowned upon.<br>
I have no problem with the Sikhs whatsoever.  <br>
Perhaps the fact that they have pretty solid universal values and actually live them is not something that endears them to Mr. Muir.</p>

		<p>The BNP has already made overtures to the Sikh and Hindu communities in England? Join us for your own protection. Have an alliance even if covert and not open? The Muslim is your enemy too. We must join forces while we can or eventually we all go down together.</p>
<p>The Sikh religion in particular was and is a warrior tradition based in large measure upon resistance to the Muslim overlord of pre-Raj India. </p>

		<p>&#8220;What Makes A Sikh Want to Join the Far Right&#8221;?</p>
<p>Here is that word again, &#8220;far-right&#8221;. How is wanting to preserve<br>
your own race, culture and language &#8220;far-right&#8221;? This is something EVERY non-White country does. In Mexico&rsquo;s immigration law, it states that immigration can never threaten Mexican ethnicity. So how is it &#8220;far-right&#8221; when Whites want the same thing.</p>

<p> There is a difference between immigrants that want to assimilate and those who demand that their new country adapt to their culture. These new immigrants are essentially colonists. I think Rajinder Singh is wise enough to realize that pleasant, mostly white, Great Britain will be radically transformed when the agents of multiculturalism gradually replace the indigenous population with Third World immigrants. This is why he supports the BNP.</p>

		<p>I wonder why Sikhs cannot eat &#8216;halal&rsquo; meat.  That&rsquo;s the Muslim kosher standard and is prepared in an identical fashion to kosher.  They can eat &#8216;regular&rsquo; meat, prepared in cruel slaughterhouses and less clean than kosher-type meat?  Sikhism, as I understand it, was created by a hindu who wanted to blend islam and hinduism together.  Guru nanak was his name.  Since hindus cannot eat meat at all (though most of them break this dictate of their religion) then I would think that meat in the muslim way would be okay.  Especially since in India 500 years ago when sikhism was created there was no other kind of meat available.</p>

		<p>The left always tries to downplay ethnic differences between non-white groups, to imply that racism is an invention of whites.</p>
<p>Obviously some Asians have come to a sensible realisation that Britain is a crowded country and their particular ethnicity can only ever be a minority in Britain (be it Sikh,Hindu) or whatever), so they may as well try to restrict immigration in general.</p>
<p>Mr Muir is worried his tribe won&rsquo;t come out on top in the immigration pecking order.</p>
