<h1>Surprise Woman Wants Stripper Career Over Kids, Punches Son</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Thomas, azfamily.com, June 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police officers arrested a 29-year-old Surprise woman after she reportedly told police she didn&rsquo;t want her children any longer and punched her 11-year-old son in the stomach in front of officers.</p>
<p>On Friday, police received a call from an 11-year-old boy who said his mother was packing and moving to California and wasn&rsquo;t taking him or his 6-year-old brother with her.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to police spokesman Sgt. Mark Ortega, the boy&rsquo;s mother, Christina Muniz, came out and told officers that she was &#8220;sick of her children&#8221; and wanted the police to take them so she can &#8220;have fun and play.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ortega said Muniz told police she wanted to start her life over and follow her dream of wanting to become a stripper and move to California.</p>
<p>The older boy told investigators that he took care of himself and his little brother. He said their mom spent her money on alcohol and there wasn&rsquo;t very much food in the house.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ortega said Muniz continued to be verbally abusive to the children in the presence of CPS and police. She reportedly yelled at the children, cursed at them and told them she did not want them.</p>
<p>As the children were being removed by CPS, the older boy attempted to hug his mom and she punched him in the stomach, according to Ortega.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Muniz was arrested and charged with child neglect, aggravated assault, disorderly conduct and possession of drug paraphernalia.<br>

		<p>This is despicable to be sure.  But I don&rsquo;t think this really represents Hispanics any more than a white psychopath represents whites.  This woman just appears to be a lunatic.  I do agree, however, Amren&rsquo;s message overall that an open border policy is a disaster for America and that our country is headed for a breakup.  </p>

		<p>Because this is AZ, I was expecting the person involved in the moral turpitude to be Hispanic.  But this sort of jettisoning of teenage boys is a big problem for too many black women   &mdash;   Mainly the reason for that is that she has a new &#8220;boo,&#8221; obviously not the young man&rsquo;s father, and &#8220;boo&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t like too much male competition around.  So she leans on his mother to throw him out of the house, which she does often, as she relies on &#8220;boo&#8221; for money and/or drugs.</p>
<p>One suburban almost entirely black school district in St. Louis owns and operates a special home for such jettisoned teenage boys:  <a href="https://www.joesplacestl.org/" rel="nofollow">https://www.joesplacestl.org/</a>  When they announced they were opening it, the local media almost told a taboo racial truth about why these teenage boys were kicked out.  BTW, it&rsquo;s never teenage girls that are kicked out, because these same kind of crum-bum &#8220;boos&#8221; don&rsquo;t see the mother&rsquo;s teenage daughter as competition, but more like a second &#8220;helping,&#8221; if I can be so circumspect.</p>

		<p>Re &#8220;Question Diversity&#8221; at 6:12,June 16: Very good summary of the situation.  A lot of times the &#8220;boo&#8221; may try to keep the lady in line with some Mack tactics,like slapping her around. The boy may not like that. Lets just face the obvious  :Blacks and to a certain degree so-called Hispanics, are a different people and will revert to their ways when possible.  Kicking out the boys is the normal &#8220;thang&#8221; for them!</p>

<p>Yes, Hispanics are MORE than likely represented by this &#8220;woman&#8221;.</p>
<p>Just in the city where I live there has been story after story of Hispanic women killing their kids and newborns than Whites ever thought of. Don&rsquo;t forget many &#8220;hispanic&#8221; women want many kids to collect their welfare checks every month also. Very few are married.<br>

		<p>The point is not that this woman is more likely to be this way because she is a mestizo.  The point is how American socialism enables this behavior and that people from other countries who are like this come here specifically because they would not be able to survive anywhere else&hellip;.which is a very bad thing.<br>

		<p>This is pretty typical.  Knocked up at 17-18, no husband, the kids get to be a drag, and girls just wanna have fun.  Such &#8220;women&#8221; need to be sterilized.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, it pains me to say so, but based on everything I&rsquo;ve seen it is white women who are more representative of this sort of behavior.  For all their faults (and their are many), blatant self-destruction, child neglect and sexually immoral lifestyles isn&rsquo;t as common amongst hispanic women as white women. </p>

		<p>I agree with the first poster, this woman is a lunatic.  What a horrible situation for these children, regardless of race.</p>
<p>We get stories like that all the time in my area.  Welfare mothers hooked on booze or meth, the children filthy, no food in the house. You read it in the paper; other stories are by word of mouth, since everyone knows everyone.  There are so many single mothers around here with children by multiple fathers.  I can count on one hand the women I know who are actually married with children.<br>
People are frequently killed in drunk driving incidents locally, and I&rsquo;ve hardly met anyone in the area who has not had a run-in with the law on some offense or another.</p>
<p>I live in the Northwest.  I live in a 99% white, semi-rural area (not saying where!).  I am sick to my stomach because it is not supposed to be this way.  I don&rsquo;t know if it is the times we live in or what, but it makes me heartsick.  And then I see an article like this and think  &mdash;  -hmmm, maybe we should tend to some of our own housekeeping, you know?<br>
Does anyone understand???</p>

		<p>I believe it would be uncommon to find a white or black woman who&rsquo;d toss out little children and then tell authorities that she doesn&rsquo;t give a heck about it!  Such ethnics would usually show remoarse and shame in the face of condemnation.  It&rsquo;s the UNCIVILIZED peasant class of Mexicans and Central Americans who spit in the faces of cops, fight them like maniacs, and threaten to kill them and their own children.  These people are a different breed of Hispanic and exhibit little, if any, resemblance to homegrown Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans, or Cubans.  These criminals apparently think the U.S. is a hunting ground where laws either don&rsquo;t apply to them or can easily be overcome.  They&rsquo;re often the first suspects to lawyer up, and, unlike many whites and blacks, they don&rsquo;t run home to mama when free, but to the motherland  &mdash;  Mexico.  It&rsquo;s hard for me to believe that any law-abiding Hispanic would take their side on any issue, since innocent Hispanics are often their victims.  I think there must be a lot of misunderstanding about laws like that passed in AZ  &mdash;  thanks to the liberal MSM.</p>

<p>In my 20 odd years of life on this planet. I have never met a white women who would do this to their children. Maybe it is because I come from a Boer/Afrikaner protestant upbringing and most people I am around have similar upbringings, who knows. However, to say that white women are more representative of this sort of behavior and not provide any proof doesn&rsquo;t really help anyone. I could say any number of &#8220;my opinions&#8221; and state them as fact. If I don&rsquo;t have any proof and make such statements, no one will take me seriously.</p>
<p>You at least say it is what you have seen rather than from any sort of study. I gather you don&rsquo;t have many conservative white women around your neck of the woods? </p>
<p>Back to the article. There is something to be said for taking a personal interest in your child&rsquo;s life and making a concerted effort to make sure they take the right path. Any person who doesn&rsquo;t do this, doesn&rsquo;t deserve to have children. Just my opinion. If this were a white American or South African women rather than an Hispanic, I would say the same thing. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what race they are. Any parent should do everything in their power to help their children succeed, nothing less will suffice.  </p>

		<p>Kitty you are right.  There is a deeper rot here than just racial differences.  </p>
<p>I would tend to blame what is sometimes called &#8220;cultural Marxism&#8221; and the total destruction of traditional society.  No one has anything to gauge where they are in life or to give their lives meaning outside of income and number of sexual partners.  You know being &#8220;cool&#8221;. </p>
<p>Back to the subject at hand&hellip; Someone suggested sterilization.  I sort of lean that direction, but I&rsquo;m also trying to think up a way to fix the problem without creating a new government agency.  </p>
<p>Simply because I&rsquo;m terribly afraid of powerful governments I always am apprehensive about a &#8220;quick fix&#8221; which might create a problem in the long run that was bigger than the original.  I firmly believe that Europe came to dominate the world during a time of relative personal freedom in Europe which culminated in the dominance of the British Empire during the early 1800&rsquo;s in their &#8220;Free-trade&#8221; days.  Contrast that to the 1900 when western governments grew and fought two needless wars which according to the thesis of the book I&rsquo;m reading doomed the west to eventual extinction.   The book is Buchanan&rsquo;s &#8220;Churchill and Hitler and The Unnecessary War.   </p>

		<p>She&rsquo;s 29, and has two sons of 11 and 6.  Therefore, she&rsquo;s looking 30 straight into the barrel, and had children at 18 and 23.  Her figure and waistline are probably shot to hell, and she expects to start a new career as a stripper in her very early middle age?  Lotsaluck with that.</p>
