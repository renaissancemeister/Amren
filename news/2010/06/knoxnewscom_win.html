<h1>Knoxnews.com Wins Murrow Award for Christian/Newsom Documentary</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Knoxville News Sentinel, June 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>knoxnews.com, the Knoxville News Sentinel website, won a national Edward R. Murrow Award today for its video news documentary on the murders of Knox County couple Channon Christian and Christopher Newsom.</p>
<p>The 2010 awards were announced by the Radio Television Digital News Association, which honors excellence in electronic journalism.</p>
<p>&#8220;Death on Chipman Street: The Channon Christian and Chris Newsom Murders&#8221; examined the carjacking, robbery, rape and murders of the University of Tennessee student and her boyfriend in January 2007.</p>
<p>The documentary was honored in the &#8220;Online News Operation  &mdash;  Local&#8221; category.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve always known that the News Sentinel staff has been among the most committed and innovative servants of their communities,&#8221; said Mark Contreras, senior vice president/Scripps newspapers.</p>

		<p>Never trust the media that hands out to the media those awards for being the media.  Watch the other hand.  Soon, this award will be leveraged into some sort of call that Whites are to blame for the murders. We will be told that in order to stop more violence in the future, we must &#8220;do more to atone for the sins of segregation by holding ourselves accountable to people of color for our unearned White privileges.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Southern patriot explained it all to me once: &#8220;They give each other these awards so they you will think they are important.&#8221;<br>

		<p>I just watched the video, and nowhere does any black person say anything supportive or sympathetic.  There are two spots where blacks make excuses and very obviously avoid the hate-crime subject.  The one white kid who talks about racism misses the point; we do not advocate racism, but race realism.  Race realism would inform whites to avoid blacks, and like many in the area do now, notably women, carry and be ready to use it.  This is a war on whites, make no mistake.  </p>

		<p>WHAT coverage?</p>
<p>Other than through Amren or Nicholas Stix, this story was not covered by anyone. It was all hush-hush and deliberately so. And even when more or less over, all the perps convicted and sentenced, not a word anywhere. Except for Pitts the moron journalist who joked and laughed at the whole thing, the national media totally ignored. Even this Knoxville bunch more or less went after things after the fact.</p>

		<p>I have seen this documentary and it is infuriating to see the black reactions.  The barber, in particular, who says he knew the suspects and that they were into doing bad things and their ways &#8220;just finally caught up to them.&#8221;   Spoken as if the tragedy is their incarceration.  This says it all.  Just like when Leonard Pitts basically said whites have no justification for outrage on this case and said &#8220;cry me a river.&#8221;</p>
<p>But yet &#8220;po&rsquo; ol&rsquo; Emitt Till&#8221; is paraded out before our children&rsquo;s eyes every February.</p>
<p>Rosa Parks once said Emitt Till was the reason she got involved in the Civil Rights movement.</p>
<p>Channon and Christopher were the last straw for me.  There is no living with people who have such a perverted perspective of &#8220;social justice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Except that Rosa Parks was lying   &mdash;   She was involved in the civil rights movement since the very early 1950s.  IIRC, she was caught red-handed at the Marxist-run Highlander Folk School.</p>

<p>Except that Channon was better looking.<br>
Incidentally, speaking of Joran Van Der Sloot, most people probably think that he is white. Not really!<br>
I saw some pictures of his mother, and she is an island woman, clearly of mixed race, but no way what we could consider &#8220;white&#8221;.</p>
