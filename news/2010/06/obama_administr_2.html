			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News, June 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Obama administration plans to file suit challenging Arizona&rsquo;s immigration law, officials told Fox News on Friday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} But an official told Fox News on Friday that while the review is still underway, the decision has already been made that a Department of Justice suit will be filed. The administration at this point is just building its case.</p>
<p>Another official said there are still &#8220;substantial&#8221; issues to address and work out before the Justice Department knows that it has a strong enough case to file a lawsuit. The official said the department intends to file suit, but that any court action is contingent on the final review.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not going to back away from this issue,&#8221; Brewer said. &#8220;We are going to pursue it, we&rsquo;re going to be very aggressive,&#8221; Brewer said. &#8220;We&rsquo;ll meet them in court.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And we will win.&#8221;</p>
<p>She added: &#8220;The population of America agrees with Arizona.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder have both criticized the Arizona law, but the administration had maintained to that point that its attorneys were reviewing the legislation to determine the next step.</p>

		<p>Arizona should welcome this lawsuit and hope its basis is &#8220;racial profiling&#8221;.  </p>

		<p>First off, IBIWISI (I&rsquo;ll Believe It When I See It).  Until there&rsquo;s a PDF file I can download and read of the lawsuit, I&rsquo;m going to think that this is more White House maneuvering to placate both Hispanics and pro-SB 1070 white voters simultaneously; rattling the sabers to pander to Hispanics, yet doing nothing to placate whites.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s really interesting here is why the WH has outsourced the anti-1070 talking and PR campaign to HRC and State.  After all, in 2008, Hispanics favored her over Obama by about a 2-1 margin.  So why would they punt Hispandering over to someone who not only has a big edge with Hispanics, but still has Presidential ambitions of her own?  Maybe they want her to latch on to an obviously losing issue, so that it would sink and not help any primary challenge she would mount against Obama.</p>
<p>Still, I&rsquo;m happy that a woman is the Admin&rsquo;s point person on anti-SB 1070 rhetoric.  It will only strengthen Jan Brewer&rsquo;s resolve, a la the Queen Bee Syndrome.  As for the Fed&rsquo;s prospects, I have read both the law and a lot of pundits&rsquo; interpretations of the law (pundits that have read the law, BTW), and they say that the law was written to be simultaneously as effective as it can in the purpose AND to stand up in the Federal courts;  the authors of SB 1070 knew full well it would end up there.</p>
<p>BTW, if you want to avoid a liberal for any reason any time soon, just go to a BP gas station in the state of Arizona.  </p>

		<p>This&rsquo;ll be interesting. The fedgov&rsquo;s painted themselves in a corner on this. They have no choice but to try and get an injunction, but that&rsquo;ll be hard. Certainly, the state of Arizona will cite the constant violation of the fedgov in refusing to enforce the existing laws against illegal entry and further, hamstrining local attempts to follow the law. I would imagine Arizona will also cite the financial costs involved in the govts continued violation of their Constitutional duties. The fedgov has got a tiger by the tail here of their own making. Then there is the point that there is Arizona type legislation pending on the floor of seventeen state legislatures.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not any &#8220;queen bee&#8221; syndrome. Jan Brewer believes in these laws very strongly and so do the Arizona people and she is standing up for her beliefs and for the people.  Too bad all of our politicians weren&rsquo;t like that.</p>

		<p>I welcome this challenge! This is the perfect opportunity to expose the spectacular failure of the Federal Government to secure the borders of this nation and the sheer ineptitude exhibited in locating/keeping track of the literally millions and millions(by the Fed&rsquo;s own estimates)of Aliens who lurk about in this country! </p>
<p>The Courts should DEMAND that the Feds obey and enforce THEIR OWN LAWS, and then the states wouldn&rsquo;t have to do things such as Arizona has. I&rsquo;ll not be holding my breath, of course!</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The administration at this point is just building its case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, they are building a case alright, but not the kind they are &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; of. The case they are building isn&rsquo;t about how individual states violate the &ldquo;rights&rdquo; of criminal alien invaders, but how a group of Marxist bandits and buffoons with federal power, are attempting to violate both the national laws they have sworn to enforce and the rights of individual states to do the same. Moreover, they are building a case that might just have the citizens of these individual states asking a dangerous question: &lsquo;Besides stealing our money and forcing their imbecilic wills upon us with it, what purpose does this misnamed joke called the federal &ldquo;government&rdquo; really serve?&rsquo;</p>
<p>In many respects, I am glad Comrade General Secretary BO beat Hillary in the primaries and this is one of them. She would have finessed this issue like the incrementally obsessed Red viper she is; the &ldquo;savior&rdquo; on the other hand, just plows ahead like an arrogant 4th grader that just won a spelling bee and thinks that makes him the next Galileo and Einstein, all rolled into one.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work Comrade BO, if successful you will be both this country&rsquo;s first and last nonwhite &ldquo;president.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, what a pity!</p>

		<p>Obama took an oath to uphold the laws of this country,including immigration laws. Since Obamas refusing to do that, isn&rsquo;t that grounds for impeachment? If they go ahead with this suit, I think impeachment proceedings should begin. This is proof positive that our govn. never has and never will have any intention of securing our borders and consider the American people [ especially White Americans ] the enemy.   </p>

		<p>Dan Stein, President, Federation for American Immigration Reform, in the April 20 Los Angeles Times:</p>
<p>&#8220;Under the law, Arizona police are prohibited from racially profiling or stopping anybody merely because of appearance or ethnicity. They may inquire about immigration status only if there is justification for the stop under the Constitution  &mdash;  such as investigating a possible crime  &mdash;  and there is reasonable suspicion that the individual is in the U.S. illegally.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what is reasonable suspicion? Reasonable suspicion might include the lack of any sort of valid U.S. identification documents that police officers routinely request from anyone who is lawfully stopped. The law expressly states that race, color or ethnicity does not constitute reasonable suspicion of illegal presence in the U.S.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In reality, SB 1070 does nothing more than require police in Arizona to protect the citizenry and uphold responsibilities abrogated by the federal government.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;A ruling by the U.S. 1st Circuit Court of Appeals this year provides firm legal footing for Arizona&rsquo;s law. In Estrada vs. Rhode Island, the court affirmed that the failure of an alien to possess alien registration documents represents probable cause for state or local police to arrest the person for a federal misdemeanor committed in the officer&rsquo;s presence, or detain that person until the individual&rsquo;s status can be verified.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
&#8220;Predictably, those who have consistently opposed all efforts to enforce U.S. immigration laws are resorting to a campaign of lies and distortions to fight implementation of the law. <br>
SB 1070, plain and simple, will allow police to identify and detain people because of the laws they violate, not because they happen to meet a particular racial or ethnic profile.&#8221;</p>

If Obama were a betting man it&rsquo;s hard imagine anyone gambling so badly.  Obama has decided to invest the prestige of his administration and take on SB 1070.  It&rsquo;s difficult to see how this will help him even if he succeeds in challenging SB 1070 he will earn the ire of most Americans.  </p>
<p>On the other hand if he fails he will also earn the ire of most Americans and he will be humbled.</p>
<p>If only he would take on BP with so much gusto.  Arresting a few BP executives wouldn&rsquo;t exactly be unpopular or illegal (in the light the 11 men killed on the Deepwater Horizon).  Of course that would require taking ownership we can&rsquo;t have that now can we?</p>
<p>Obama gambles poorly.</p>

		<p>I wish I were as optimistic about the outcome of this whole thing as your other readers are. My fear is that with the Supreme Court loaded. The law will be struck down al la Brown Vs. Board of Education. This is in no way a cake walk for anyone. </p>
<p>My guess is that it will be found unconstitutional on the grounds that HB 1070 violates the civil rights of the Mexican population. What will be interesting to see is whether or not the general population gets their panties in a wad enough to really do something about this kind of legislation from the bench. </p>
<p>50 years of court meddling will hopefully turn to Romans sour on the wine and the bread and circus politics going on at present will be seriously challenged. </p>

		<p>One of the things that Obama is doing that really is self-sabotaging is overtly working against the best interests of the states.  For a long, long time, the states have put up with a lot from the federal government because of the ambiguity as to if what the federal government is legitimate or not.  Little things add up to a lot over time but resistance is light because they are little things.</p>
<p>But Obama is doing big things (like suing states who want to enforce federal law and stopping state run oil skimmers, successfully cleaning up the oil mess they refuse to).  These leaves no doubt whatsoever that the federal government is a rogue state acting directly against the interests of the states and the people who live here.</p>
<p>Once that doubt is gone, it&rsquo;s gone for good.  And the federal government has no power whatsoever to enforce its will other than the willingness of people to cooperate.  That willingness will be completely gone&hellip;.and soon.</p>

<p>It would be the same if the Federal government filed a lawsuit against Arizona for its law against homicide! It&rsquo;s ludicrous!</p>

		<p>The only grounds for AG Holder&rsquo;s challenge are profiling and Supremacy Clause.  Profiling is not allowed by the very language of the law.  That leaves the Supremacy Clause.    The Supremacy Clause is a provision in the United States Constitution that provides for situations in which state and federal law are in conflict; in such cases where the two overlap, federal law trumps.</p>
<p>The Arizona law is NOT in conflict with this clause, it&rsquo;s consistent.  Arizona will merely enforce the immigration law because the feds refuse to do so.  <br>
Arizona is very lucky to have Gov. Jan Brewer, she is a real leader and will not back down.  <br>
Good Luck to Arizona!</p>

		<p>In Hillary&rsquo;s interview she suggested that Obama&rsquo;s problem with the law is that he sees it as an infringement on the Fed Govt&rsquo;s authority over immigration matters. It will be interesting to see if those are the grounds on which the DOJ bases its case. To the legal experts who read and comment here: What do you think? Will SB 1070 hold up against such a challenge?</p>
<p>Aside from the specifics of the law and the court challenges it faces, I find this controversy fascinating. It&rsquo;s amazing to see the left wing media work its audience up into a fervor over the supposed threat of racial profiling, when the fact is that ICE agents operate in the same way on a daily basis as the law proposes that AZ law enforcement officers be able to do. Pure race-based fear mongering, there&rsquo;s no other way to describe it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also fascinating to see how despite a full tilt media attack on the law and on Arizona, polls have consistently shown that a solid majority of the country supports the law, including almost half of Dem voters. One wonders if this support is more or less coming from whites. Actually, I don&rsquo;t wonder.</p>
<p>Which tells me that SB 1070, regardless of whether the law survives the courts and ever goes into effect, has been a great opportunity politically for those who are opposed to illegal immigration and opposed to the changing demographics of the country that have come in large part thanks to illegal immigration.</p>
<p>Before Obama has even got to the National Council of La Raza&rsquo;s agenda of &#8220;immigration reform&#8221; (or as it will be known if it passes, &#8220;the Obama Amnesty&#8221;), the majority of the electorate has already been whipped up into an anti-immigrant state of awareness. And every day the battle over Arizona&rsquo;s law continues is another day that more people see through the left&rsquo;s hysteria over racial profiling, and get a chance to become more educated about how illegal immigration is wrecking this country. The Obama Amnesty may be dead before its even gets off the ground. Thanks to SB 1070!</p>
<p>Who knows, this could end up being a significant window of opportunity. I think those leading the anti-illegal immigration fight should consider going on the offensive in an even bigger way. </p>

		<p>I wonder what the argumentation of the Obama administration will be. Arizona is not breaking a federal law, it is perhaps over-zealous in enforcing a federal law. Over-zealousness is a rather weak argument. The case is comparable to that of a citizen who reports cars parking in a no-parking area to the police. That may not be his business, but he is acting within his rights.<br>
In the context of Arizona&rsquo;s over-zealousness, SCOTUS will be obliged to say somethimg about administrations which openly and bluntly refuse to enforce federal laws, i. e. the so-called sanctuary cities. That will be interesting.</p>

		<p>The AZ law cannot be found unconstitutional without the similar federal law suffering the same fate.  And, contrary to popular belief, the Supreme Court usually favors law enforcement.  The police can racially profile if it&rsquo;s pertinent to the crime at hand (car with whites slowly cruising a ghetto=reasonable suspicion of drug buying); the cops may lie to suspects to elicit info and confessions (claim to have evidence they don&rsquo;t, for ex.); they can set up decoys such as pretend prostitutes and bait cars to lure prospective criminals; they can seize evidence that&rsquo;s &#8220;in plain sight&#8221; or even theoretically would have been found anyway.  And even with Miranda, if cops give some garbled version that should have been comprehended, it&rsquo;s ok.  <br>
Furthermore, Obama is so weak and waffling that he will probably never get around to actually doing anything about the AZ law  &mdash;  just as nothing is getting done about illegal immigration itself.</p>

		<p>Arizona should file a cross complaint and counter sue the United States Federal government for failing to protect the citizens  of the United States and their property from the illegals. Also if possible any U.S. citizen who is injured or has property damage due to illegal immigration from Mexico should seek redress for damages from the Mexican government. </p>

<p>As an aside, the Supreme Court isn&rsquo;t &#8220;loaded&#8221;, True Blue.  Obama&rsquo;s appointments have been identically liberal to those justices that have stepped down.  The Holy Hope Pope hasn&rsquo;t replaced any conservatives there, and the court was conservative enough to vote 5:4 that the second Amendment does in fact mean an individual right (the only depressing thing about that vote was that the four dissenters seemed under the impression that the amendment really just protects the government&rsquo;s right to arm the police and national guard.)</p>

		<p>This disgusts me.  It is flat out hateful and criminal for the government to force any state in this country to abide by oppressive laws and regulations while at the same time creating a huge hooplah and waging war when they decide they want to break away from the country.</p>
<p>As a Southerner, the topic of states&rsquo; rights strikes a nerve with me. It was none of Abraham Lincoln&rsquo;s business to force war on the South when we wanted to break away from the Union because we didn&rsquo;t agree with the Union&rsquo;s way of doing things.  Why is it anybody&rsquo;s business up in New England or in Washington DC how people in the South and in the Southwest choose to live?  </p>
<p>The whole point of this country was to give different states rights. Now we are moving back to the monarchy system that we tried to escape in England to begin with.</p>
<p>It is purely hateful to force any states to stay in this Union when we don&rsquo;t agree with how the Union does anything to begin with.  Why do Washington and the liberal establishment insist we stay a part of this country when they seem to look down on us anyways?  Why?  If you dislike us so much, then please, leave us alone, stay out of our business, and let us break away if we so desire!</p>
<p>I am sick of this.  I am sick of liberals who live up in Seattle and New England telling those of us who live in the South, the Heartland, and Southwest, how we are supposed to live, as if the people up in those areas even have to deal with minorities like we do on a day to day basis.  </p>
<p>It is just like liberal Northerners constantly bashing the South but yet they keep moving down here, turning states such as Virginia, North Carolina, and Florida blue in the process.  Please leave us alone.  What is your problem?  Do you really dislike us or are you somehow jealous of what we have down here?  Keep your sorry disgraceful selves far away from us and move back to your paradises up in Connecticut and New York.</p>
<p>By the way, why is it that all the people who are from those areas don&rsquo;t seem to like them?  Why doesn&rsquo;t anybody from New York City or New Jersey ever stay in those places?  Why do they all come South to live but yet continue to vote the way they did up North?  Please stay home and leave us alone.</p>
<p>I am sick of it.  I hope Arizona fights with every tooth and nail, and I hope other states follow suit.</p>
<p>I know that on this website we are supposed to be about coming together as whites. I&rsquo;m sorry but as a Southerner, there are way too many white people particularly from the North that I find it very hard to like.  If this country has to split and divide in order for whites as a race to have a future, then so be it.  I am sick of the white people in Washington DC, Seattle, and New York City who think they are so much better than the rest of us.</p>

		<p>So they won&rsquo;t file suit against the Black Panthers who intimidated the rights of legal (white) citizens, but they will fight a law that makes sure illegal criminals who aren&rsquo;t citizens have to carry documentation?</p>

		<p>Three thoughts come to my mind. First, this is the Supreme Court&rsquo;s chance for revenge; recall if you will, of how the man of perdition abraded and ridiculed the justices in front of the whole nation back in January. Second, between this lawsuit and the ongoing BP episode, whatever popularity he has left will vaporize. Third, regardless of the outcome, most of those in congress who cater to his whim and end up supporting this suit will without doubt be losing sleep in the months to come, wondering if maybe they had finally pushed the American people too far. November is roughly only four months away. Anticipation abounds.</p>

		<p>I have a sneaking suspicioun that it doesn&rsquo;t matter anymore.</p>
<p>What Obama, Congress, the Supreme Court have to say on these matters simply no longer matters to state authorities when they decide what to do in their states.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s become obvious that Obama has no power to enforce his will.  There are no longer any consequences should a state decide the law within their boundaries no longer has anything to do with federal institutions.</p>
<p>Obama can flap his gums all he wants.  It&rsquo;s just talk.  He can file whatever lawsuits he wants.  It&rsquo;s just paper.</p>

		<p>It seems to me that politicians in the US just do as they please regardless of what the people that elected them want. Most Americans never wanted anti miscegenation laws taken off the books back in the day. And the overwhelming majority of Americans today don&rsquo;t want affirmative action or anymore more immigration, but our leaders seem to just keep giving us more. It doesn&rsquo;t matter which of the two major parties we vote for. And the far left still say that they have the overwhelming majority on their side whenever they protest against nationalists. </p>

		<p>Obama is worried that if too many illegals self deport, then there will be fewer Dem. votes once Amnesty hits our Republic with it fully transformative force.  He needs as many votes as possible to overrun the rising tide of White Awareness.  Nothing goes back to normal after his first 18 months as President.  America has changed forever, and the Whites will vote with ethno political consciousness, so he wants the browns to outnumber the Whites.</p>
<p>Where can you go to see the future of America?  Walk down your grocery store isle and take a look at all the smiling babies on the diaper packages.  Only one or two will be are pure white, and none of those are Teutonic White.  Most of the babies are some sort of mulatto-mestizo-asian mix.  You can&rsquo;t even identify them as a race.  Only one appeared to be pure blooded African.  <br>
All but the White will have some sort of kinky hair-wool blend on its head, clearly the rude result of miscegenation, now rewarded and encouraged.</p>
<p>We are being browned out of existence.  All ethnologist who studied the slavery and race problem predicted  America&rsquo;s demise if we become mongrelized.  It&rsquo;s happening, as though history is forcing itself to prove all the White Racists as true prophets and great historical heroes of their people- of us- of Whites.</p>
<p>Non whites insist on living into the stereotypes we draw for them, thus vindicating those Whites who still retain their natural and God given race prejudices.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s recommended reading for the Amren Community: Fisher&rsquo;s Laws of Race. http://tiny.cc/6rhzs  He proves that the yankee sensibility about the blacks was more rational that that of the South.   Southerners surrounded themselves with blacks, something a self respected yankee would never do, and for good reason.   He lays it out.<br>

		<p>rather than debate the law(thats just a distraction), i will just make an observation. it is pretty sick when our own federal government, run by obama and his comminists minions,  bring a law suit against a state for trying to enforce existing law. it tells me that america has been taken over by a bunch of radicals who are only out for the demise of white america (that is their driving force). if i was arizona and lost this suit, i would do four things, one, i would build a wall within the borders all the way across the bottom end of arizona about a mile or two in from the mexican border. this wall would  belong exclusively to arizona and would not be stopping mexicans from entering the usa illegally, it would only stop them from entering arizona. two, i would put the federal government on notice that i will not enforce any federal laws that they request of me..example..kidnapping, flight or any other federal law. i would tell them to send their own federal agents to arrest the people. i would tell them that i will use no arizona enforcement authorities to help in the capture of any federal suspects. three, i would pass legislation eliminating all programs of welfare or support to illegal aliens. and four, i would pass legislation that would put all employers within the state of arizona on notice that there is a 20 year prison sentence awaiting them if they work any illegals. i would also tell obama if he comes to arizona, i will arrest him if he can not prove he is an american citizen.  </p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t believe this&hellip;Tell me&hellip;Why does the USA want these illegals to come in as they please? I don&rsquo;t get it&hellip;They are illegal and thats it!I admire the governor of Arizona. She is right. And both Whites and Black agree with her on this. I have checked both forums. She must stand strong&hellip;.</p>
