			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Charlie Gillis, Maclean's (Toronto), June 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Midway through last summer, when much of official Ottawa was away at the cottage, a revealing document landed on the desk of Canada&rsquo;s top immigration bureaucrat, deputy minister Neil Yeates. Prosaically titled &#8220;Social and Economic Outcomes of Second Generation Youth,&#8221; the four-page memo showed little regard for the political correctness typical of government correspondence. &#8220;Chinese and South Asians are the most likely to have university degrees or higher, and to be employed in high-skilled occupations,&#8221; observed the summary, which was prepared by departmental bureaucrats and released recently through access to information. Second-generation youth of Caribbean and Latin American origin don&rsquo;t fare so well, the memo went on; they tend to obtain lower levels of education than native-born Canadian kids and wind up in less skilled jobs.</p>
<p>To Richard Kurland, the Vancouver-based immigration lawyer who dug it up, the document confirmed &#8220;what everybody in the business has known for a long time.&#8221; For years, the government has been gathering data on the performance of newcomers and their children based on ethnicity, he notes, and while immigration officials deny they use information to identify the best countries from which to recruit, the numbers tell a different story. Since 1999, China and India have been the top two source countries for immigrants to Canada, averaging about 60,000 landings per year, while the number coming from the Caribbean has fallen sharply. Immigration from the West Indies had fallen 45 per cent below levels seen in the early 1990s, according to figures compiled by Statistics Canada, when more than 16,000 from that region were entering the country annually.</p>
<p>And these days, equipped with new legislative powers, the government is able to pick and choose more aggressively than ever. Bill C-50, passed in late 2008, allows the minister to delay the processing of applications from specific missions abroad in order to speed those from others, and so far the results have been stark. The average wait time for someone wishing to bring a spouse into the country through Kingston, Jamaica has ballooned to 15 months, fully three times the processing time in 2006. A similar application lodged in New Delhi takes just six months.</p>
<p>It would be simplistic to call this profiling. China and India are better represented in Canada&rsquo;s intake statistics, a senior government official told Maclean&rsquo;s, because they are rich in skilled, educated people willing to emigrate  &mdash;  not because of ethnic traits, real or imagined: &#8220;It&rsquo;s a matter of basic supply and demand.&#8221; As for the memo, a spokeswoman for Citizenship and Immigration Canada would say only that it reflects the department&rsquo;s ongoing concern for groups &#8220;experiencing less positive outcomes from an immigration, settlement and a multiculturalism perspective.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, both the memo and numbers reflect a preoccupation that has come to define the Harper government&rsquo;s approach to immigration: which applicants offer the greatest long-term value  &mdash;  now or a generation or two down the line? In speech after speech, Immigration Minister Jason Kenney points up pressures wrought by the country&rsquo;s low birth rate and advancing economy, noting that 100 per cent of Canada&rsquo;s labour growth will have to come from outside the country by 2016. Under the circumstances, he says, there is little place for electorally driven immigration, in which governments endlessly expanded family reunification quotas in return for goodwill at voting time. &#8220;The standard Liberal electoral strategy in the past three decades has been a kind of shameless pandering to immigrant communities,&#8221; Kenney charges in an interview. &#8220;It didn&rsquo;t work. They over-promised and under-delivered.&#8221;</p>
<p>It all sounds well and good: a system that emphasizes merit rather than familial connection or crass politics. But recruiting 250,000 immigrants per year, as Ottawa hopes to do for the foreseeable future, will require sweeping, some would say un-Canadian, judgments. Do some countries offer better immigrants, on average, than others? Whose children do better? What, exactly, do we mean by &#8220;better&#8221;? Deciding who gets into the country has arguably never been so important. And rarely has it been so hard.</p>
<p>The idea that we might goose our economy with strategic immigration isn&rsquo;t new, of course. Clifford Sifton&rsquo;s &#8220;stalwart peasant in a sheepskin coat&#8221; was an early 1900s version of today&rsquo;s &#8220;designer immigrant&#8221;  &mdash;  an applicant in, say, her late 20s, with a graduate degree and $300,000 in savings. Yet the latter half of the century saw waves of newcomers enter through the country&rsquo;s other gateway: programs allowing those already here to sponsor family members from abroad. Tradesmen who flooded in from southern Europe in the &rsquo;50s and &rsquo;60s sponsored their spouses and children, as did women who had arrived from Jamaica, Haiti and Trinidad to work as housekeepers. By 1976, nearly 10 per cent of the country&rsquo;s immigrants were coming from the Caribbean, though the region represented about 0.6 per cent of the world&rsquo;s population.</p>
<p>By 1993, with the family-class quotient nearing 44 per cent of the intake, decision-makers were starting to worry. Successive immigration ministers under prime minister Jean Chrétien jacked up the number of so-called economic immigrants  &mdash;  skilled workers, or people with money  &mdash;  pushing family-class applicants&rsquo; share of intake down to 24 per cent in 2005. For a party with deep political ties to the country&rsquo;s ethnic communities, this was risky policy, and soon the Grits were taking heat over a 100,000-case backlog in the number of residents trying to bring their parents and grandparents into the country. In 2005, then-minister Joe Volpe buckled under the pressure, promising to triple the number of family reunification applications the department would process.</p>
<p>Kenney&rsquo;s break with this pattern has been one of tone as much as substance: while he talks up the importance of economic immigration, he&rsquo;s cultivated his own strong ties with ethnic groups and maintained family-class immigration targets at or near previous levels. Bill C-50, however, allows Kenney to move with a freedom his Liberal predecessors would have envied, fast-tracking applicants in 38 high-demand occupations  &mdash;  from petroleum engineers to hotel managers  &mdash;  while effectively shutting off the tap from parts of the world awash in family-class applications. Caribbean, Latin American and African candidates appear to have been hit hardest. Canadian-based parents who apply to the immigration post in Nairobi to bring over their children are told they must wait three years, nearly double the projected wait in 2006. In Guatemala, the delay is up 63 per cent during the same period, to 23 months, while wait times for Asian and Pacific countries have grown only marginally.</p>
<p>The sense of unequal treatment rankles people like Jessica Thomas, a 29-year-old Barbudan-Canadian who lives in Toronto. Four years ago, she married a man from Barbuda here in Toronto and became pregnant. But after her husband, Nicholas, returned a few weeks later to the tiny Caribbean island to care for his ailing father, he found he couldn&rsquo;t get back; evidently, ofﬁcials suspected the marriage was a sham. Thomas was infuriated (&#8220;Who spends $40,000 on a sham wedding?&#8221;), not least by the contempt she says the couple encountered at Canada&rsquo;s high commission in Trinidad. &#8220;I&rsquo;ve found them very rude,&#8221; she says, pointedly noting that top positions at the mission appear to be occupied by Asians, Indians and white people. &#8220;Maybe they look at people who come from the Caribbean and live off the system. Well, we&rsquo;re not in that category.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the sort of ill will that is worth it only if the government can point to tangible results. For the Tories, that&rsquo;s no slam dunk. Despite the new emphasis on economic immigration, a StatsCan study released in February showed that less than one in four newcomers are finding work in the occupations they&rsquo;d trained for, while immigrants in general are less likely to be employed than native-born Canadians. It is now trite for politicians to bemoan the professional barriers stopping skilled workers from finding jobs in their field  &mdash;  the proverbial cab driver with a Ph.D. But little has been done to remedy the problem.</p>
<p>Meantime, the de-emphasis on family unification may be driving away the very people the government is trying to recruit. Jim Karygiannis, a Liberal MP representing the ethnically diverse riding of Scarborough-Agincourt, says he&rsquo;s been hearing from skilled workers and business-class migrants frustrated by the government&rsquo;s policy of consigning sponsorship applications for parents and grandparents to the bottom of the pile. &#8220;A lot of immigrant families want to have the parents or grandparents here to help raise the kids,&#8221; he says. &#8220;If they can&rsquo;t do that, they say, &#8216;Thank you very much but I&rsquo;m gone.&rsquo; &#8221; This is no small concern, given the benefits Canada has gained from immigrants who had upwardly mobile children. (In addition to its ethnic breakdown, last summer&rsquo;s memo quotes studies concluding that second-generation immigrant youth are on the whole more likely to get high school diplomas, university degrees and high-skill jobs than kids of native-born Canadians.)</p>
<p>All of which exposes the government to criticism that it is turning its back on  &mdash;  if not discriminating against  &mdash;  the sort of people who helped build the country. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t think family reunification exists in [this government&rsquo;s] vocabulary,&#8221; says Judy Sgro, a Liberal MP who served as immigration minister in 2004. Luin Goldring, a York University professor who has studied the difficulties faced by Caribbean and Latin American immigrants, questions &#8220;the whole business of looking at people as economic units.&#8221; &#8220;It divides the person into their economic role and social role,&#8221; she says, when studies have shown that all classes of immigrants integrate more smoothly if they establish strong family support networks.</p>
<p>Yet even critics like Sgro acknowledge the need to &#8220;get it right&#8221; as Canada enters the post-baby-boom economic era, with a birth rate of 1.66 and a host of entitlement programs and pensions to pay for. It is no less a challenge than the one government faced at the turn of the century, when it set out to settle the West, observes Alan Simmons, the author of a forthcoming history on immigration to Canada. But now, as a free-trading nation in a knowledge economy, he says, we would &#8220;like to recruit only the perfect designer immigrants,&#8221; and that means leaning on the narrow band of countries that have them in surplus. It also means pinching the flow from countries where the education system is lacking, or money is scarce.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a far cry from our fondest self-image as a haven for the lowly, who yearn for a better life. Years ago, during a cross-country train trip, Maclean&rsquo;s journalist Rae Corelli summoned a romantic image of Canada&rsquo;s French and English founders leaving &#8220;a key under the mat for dreamers from other lands.&#8221; The key is still there, of course. But as we weigh an uncertain future, we&rsquo;re getting a lot more picky about whom we invite to use it.<br>

		<p>And if the government weren&rsquo;t run by deluded treacherous fools, they&rsquo;d realize that WHITES are superior to both indians and chinese, and that if we want any immigration at all it should be whites only.</p>
<p>It is a strange world we live in, 100 years ago white population was growing rapidly and we were colonizing and expanding all over the world.<br>
Now, we are retreating on all fronts, our population is getting set to half in a few decades, every single white country accepting hundreds of thousands of non-whites every year, meanwhile whites are taxed to feed and clothe the masses of third worlders.</p>

		<p>Well, it should be common sense that any nation should be choosey about who they let settle their country. Only in the minds of the braindead Marxist is it shocking or immoral to do so. If only the US would start openly pushing for such policies. </p>
<p>Some would say we should limit immigration to White Europeans only, but considering European birthrates, they don&rsquo;t exactly have a surplus. Given a choice between educated Asians and low IQ Mestizos and Africans, we would at least be on the right track of  practicing quality control. </p>

		<p>Canada became prosperous in the post-war era by having easy resources and branch plants of American factories.</p>
<p>Now the mills and mines of the British empire have long closed, the fishery is not what it used to be, free trade, globalization, and the declining fortunes of the American &#8216;rust belt&rsquo; are taking Canadian manufacturing down with them.</p>
<p>Still, successive Canadian governments cling to the simple formula: immigrants plus debt-created money equals economic growth.</p>
<p>They are neo-conservatives, hopelessly thinking a nation can be run like a business.  There is no long term vision.</p>

		<p>This writing is only a little better than the usual celebration pieces on immigration. Canada is not even close to becoming honest about immigration. Canadians are still afraid to speak their minds. I&rsquo;m going to continue with my program of introducing white Canadians to the modern white movement such as AmRen. White Canadians will be better off by developing an ethnic group based on our European derived identity. </p>

		<p>Well obviously Asian immigrants are better than blacks. After all north East Asians have a very high average IQ unlike blacks who have some of the lowest intelligence among all human races. As far as Indians are concerned, Canada has been very selective in taking in economic and intellectual cream of that billion plus strong nation. So no surprises here. Except that some of the lower IQ immigrants from South Asia (who came in earlier) behave like Hispanics if not as bad as blacks. Many Canadian cities face the menace of Punjabi and Tamil gangs.</p>
<p>   But these high IQ immigrants from brown lands tend to be very clannish, racist and very poor morals. Even if they contribute positively to the Canadian economy, it is harmful for the Canadians in the long run. Instead of bringing in these immigrants Canada should have encouraged White Canadians to increase their fertility and to take up higher education. Canadians died fighting in so many wars including both the World Wars only to turn over their nation to brown-black immigrants who hate them! Is it surprising that such a stupid sub-species is going extinct? <br>

		<p>Toronto is a multiculty hovel. If you want to avoid the yellows, browns &amp; blacks, you move to North York, as close to Steeles ave on Bathurst st - IF you can afford the extra $200 monthly. The downside is that its 90% Jewish, 70% Russian speaking with 5 synagogues within a 1km radius but at least its wealthy, safe, clean &amp; Caucasian. Scarborough is a Tamil hell. The entire West end north of St Claire is an African nightmare, south including Parkdale is a Black-Yellow slum of open criminality. </p>

		<p>Chinese and Indian immigration is in fact a net economic drain on Canada&rsquo;s economy, as stated in study after study, such as the Council on Science and Toronto University studies. </p>
<p>What is happening is economic expansion that benefits almost entirely the immigrant and his family - not Canada, not Canadians. Instinctively we know this because immigration cities, like Metro Vancouver are now vastly non-Canadian. Drive through the centre of Vancouver, or visit five random schools, and you will find many that are almost entirely Chinese. In fact, the ESL programs here in Vancouver cater almost entirely to born-in-Canada Chinese and Indians who have not, and will not assimilate. There&rsquo;s no one in Vancouver to assimilate to.</p>

		<p>If you won&rsquo;t breed with them you&rsquo;d better compete with them because North East Asians are smart enough to form -effective- intercultural &#8216;working groups&rsquo; high enough up the food chain as to form separate elite groups.  Groups that can dominate pie slice allocations in industries where high math and spatial skills (engineers all) are sought after and guaranteed wage rewarded.</p>
<p>Which may not be a bad thing if you are truly into the genetics of superiority and don&rsquo;t mind seeing your destiny as your children&rsquo;s genes mixed with an Indian or Chinese partners.  But if not, then importing non-assimilative secondary populations ensures you are setting yourselves up for a destructive power grab scenario where the new bloods have the ethnic solidarity to defeat the more numerous but diffuse indigene wishes.</p>
<p>Something made all the harder to break into by the insular nature of many of their extended family as a cultural isolates within given geographies.</p>
<p>Myself, if you look at the macro, you see the micro.  People who &#8216;escape&rsquo; from billion+ societies locked in antlike regression from 6-7 person households which have rendered much of their nation unliveable, unadvanceable, slums (or rural subsistence farms on the brink of starvation) are not going to leave behind the attitudes which let those societies be created.</p>
<p>The will bring them to their new landscape and set about filling it too.</p>
<p>Indeed, Asian immigrants are often -proud- of those creations to the point where nationalism is far more rabid among Asians of all cultures than it is here.  Which further hurts any melting pot process.</p>
<p>Finally, I have to ask:  What started all this?  Was it H-1b driven?  Has Canada, like America, become addicted to cheap engineers and essentially stopped hiring indigenes out of their colleges because they don&rsquo;t want to pay 90,000 for a job they can offer 27 for?</p>
<p>If so, look out.  The worst thing you can do in a society already suffering sub-replacement level TFR shortfalls is disenfranchise their mid/upper classes because that will lower their social exchange value for class-equivalent eligible mates and cause a collapse from the top scenario.  It also inhibit the trickle down enablement of the ethny group as a whole.</p>
<p>It may well be that the middle class is, for once, the &#8216;barometer species&rsquo; by which a nation&rsquo;s loyalty to it&rsquo;s internal peoples as it&rsquo;s preferred destinty is measured.</p>

		<p>While there may be noticeable numbers of East Asian and Indian people, the vast majority of the Canadian population (84%) is White. Almost all of our elected leaders are White. Outside the major urban centers, the population is predominantly White.  </p>
<p>Most immigration to Canada is from Asia, and the case for people like Chinese immigrants is understandable. Like the article said, they are on average more educated, wealthier, and less dependent on welfare (immigrants especially from places like Hong Kong bring their money and businesses). These values contribute to our largely peaceful social fabric and maintenance of Canada&rsquo;s economic prosperity.</p>
<p>There is no question that problems exist in the immigration system that leave it vulnerable to being abused (e.g., Indian immigration &#8220;consultants&#8221;), and I&rsquo;m in favor of a moratorium until things can be resolved.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure if the Somali community had the money to pay off Mr Gillis, he&rsquo;d be writing about how much better those Somali immigrants are than Koreans, Indians or Chinese.  The truth is none of them are better for Canada, in fact some Asians could be worse.  Look at those billions of people crammed into those countries like sardines in a can and they&rsquo;re eyeing North America and all that freed up living space that they hope to conquer.</p>

		<p>The numbers are interesting (and scary) but it&rsquo;s all about racial pandering.   In the 1990&rsquo;s, Canada closed immigration offices in Britain and Europe while opening new offices in India, Pakistan and Hong Kong.   Third World immigrants now form such a large part of our major cities that all political parties court their vote.   Non-white immigrants tend to vote for the Liberal party which is why the Conservative party rarely elects a member from multi-racial Toronto.   If politicians are still convinced that we must fill up every square foot of Canada with new immigrants, why must they be Third Worlders?   This country was built with the money, labour and brains of British and European settlers.   Why on earth would any civilized country deny entry to fellow well-educated whites in favour of East Indian and Chinese merchants?   It is also worth repeating that Third Worlders have large families whereas whites have now reached almost zero population growth. </p>

		<p>Well, no real surprise here folks. Of coarse Canada would rather have Chinese and Hindus coming in juxtaposed to Caribbeans and Africans. Canada&rsquo;s complexion has changed dramatically during the past twenty five years, although it is still clearly a majority White nation. For the most part, the Chinese that migrated in have been a net plus for the nation because they are very well educated, hard working and make for good neighbors. This stands true for the Hindus from India as well. The migrants from the Caribbean region and sub-Saharan Africa have been demonstrated to be a huge burden on Canada because of their lazy lifestyle, propensity to engage in criminal activities and their lack of enthusiasm for getting good education. If our options are between these two paradigms, the the better choice is clear  &mdash;  -bring in the Chinese.</p>

		<p>Liberal whites who think affluent Chinese and Indians are going to take care of them in their old age are deluding themselves. Those people are notorious for evading taxes. Only whites think is their duty to pay taxes or give to charity. The Americans are even more insane thinking the Mexicans will do it, even if they could.</p>

<p>Looking around heavily diversified Torontostan these days, I&rsquo;d say the answer to the question &#8220;Who Doesn&rsquo;t Get Into Canada?&#8221; must be &#8220;NOBODY! Nobody doesn&rsquo;t get into Canada!&#8221;</p>
<p>But then I remembered Brandon Huntley, the white South African refugee applicant whom poster #12 Bon mentioned. The seven-times-victimized Mr. Huntley is someone who apparently won&rsquo;t be getting into Canada. He&rsquo;s the wrong color, you see. </p>

		<p>&#8220;<i>Third World immigrants now form such a large part of our major cities that all political parties court their vote.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>If Canada&rsquo;s <i>white</i> population still amounts to 84%, why would pandering politicians court a fragmented population of diverse third-worlders, many of whom don&rsquo;t even speak English or French, and could care less about Canada? </p>
<p>Because of some unwritten rule, none of the major federal political parties ever speaks in favour of advancing the interests of Euro-Caucasians born in their own country, and who just happen to form the majority. If the political game is about numbers, why pander to the other 16 percent? </p>
<p>Why do suicidal white Canadians advance the interests of FOREIGN visible-minorities at the expense of themselves in almost every part of society from jobs/promotions to vastly over-representation in commercial advertising? (Frankly, I boycott products when I see this blatant display of tokenism.)   </p>
<p>For example, blacks are now composed of 2% of Canada&rsquo;s population, mostly due to mass immigration, but we&rsquo;re expected to offer token opportunities to this particular minority group equal to those of the majority white population.</p>
<p>Incidentally, there&rsquo;s another segment of the entire world&rsquo;s population that amounts to only 2%. That percentage belongs to <i>white</i> women who are of child-bearing age! </p>

		<p>Come now, Canada, Punjabis (Considered the stupidest but physically most robust of the India subgroups)have transformed your country into a bedlam of vice and hot-blooded impulsive gang member and the Tamils have made urban-guerilla warfare a byword in the Tiger-financing stage of their terrorist-independent state that Ajax and Scarborough now are through narco-trafficking.</p>

		<p>The US raised the bar by admitting only those Brahmin immigrants of caste privilege in the US who had the capacity to function at the level of the culturally similar European-branch of the Caucasoid tree.</p>

		<p>Let us not forget the Sikhs, always a bedrock of Canadian immigrant subcultural ghetto violence, who turned Canada into the basde of operations for their notions of a Khalistan-thewy are basically fanatic Pakistanis under a different religion with some admixture of ancient Scythian blood-large, stupid, aggressive, fearless, dangerous&hellip;.barbaric.</p>

		<p>Sikhs ARE the MEXICANS OF CANADA: imported for cheap labour in the agricultural sector, their inclination towards macho warrior codes-not how live but how you die-immediately unleashed the petty sort of gang activity we see in the barrios of the United States.</p>

<p>The tamils are a more organized, logical group of Dravidians.  Essentially cowardly, physically unimposing, slimy, unethical, their approach is one of more organized an intelligent violence: witness the Sri Lankan war against the Singhalese</p>

		<p>Although superficially politically correct, Canada has an unspoken attrition strategy for the &#8220;:south Asian&#8221; Tamils and Sikhs that works: let them kill each other in their wretched Third World districts of Canada&rsquo;s once pristine inner-cities, and let the police-in collusion with the Hell&rsquo;s Angels who are supported in mute silence by the silent majority of white Canadians who would not like to see the Chinese and Punjabis get their hands on the market-dominance of the heroin supplies. </p>
<p>Occasionally, a Punjabi will attribute the violence in their community to the influence of the Hell&rsquo;s Angels to which their youths have been subcontracted as dealers, and a HA spokesperson will publicly respond that it is nonsense.</p>

		<p>Since this thread seems to be regarding various real-life experiences in Toronto Canada&hellip;. especially related to race matters&hellip;.  </p>
<p>I heard a few times that the most dangerous area in Toronto is Jane &amp; Eglinton.  One of my best friends lives there with his younger brother in an apartment very close to Jane &amp; Eglinton.  He is Korean and they are the sons of a pastor.  I remember giving them a ride home from the church several times.  </p>
<p>A few years ago, I lived with the boys in their apartment for a couple of weeks because the house my parents purchased was not available for my family to move in for a couple weeks.  My mother gave the boys loads of potato chips and soft drinks as a sign of appreciation on the evening I moved in.  I enjoyed my days while I was living with the boys&hellip;  It was a few years ago but I do not remember anything specifically dangerous&hellip;  The three of us just spent the evenings reading comics, munching down and watching TV.  I do remember nobody was outside in public in the evenings, however.  </p>
<p>In the mornings, when I had to get to school, I remember getting on the bus a few times without paying enough fare because I honestly did not have any more coins with me.  And I did that a few times for the next several days and accidentally the bus driver was the same dude&hellip; he did let me get away for a few days.  I finally acknowledged that I had to be fair regarding the bus fare and I basically paid all my overdue bus fare all at once one morning.  </p>
<p>The bigger problems in Toronto seem to be homeless people and pickpockets and the government having to spend a lot of money every winter to maintain the road conditions.  And it is unfortunate but, police officers in Toronto are very liberal.  Once in a while, you can see police officers of East Asian background&hellip;.  and those police officers of East Asian ethnicity seem to be a lot less liberal than their white counterparts&hellip; I can see that.  East Asian police officers are in much less dangers of being called racists than white police officers.  </p>
<p>Another thing I remember that happened a few years ago&hellip;. I worked until 3 in the morning and my outfits became very dirty.  and then I was walking home&hellip; I was moderately limping because I was very tired.  Then a police car pulled over and they got out of the car and asked me why all my outfit is smudged with blood&hellip;.  and asked me how much I have been drinking&hellip;.  It looked like they felt I was just coming home from a rampage with weapons&hellip;.  I said it was not blood.  They argued and said to each other it was blood&hellip;.  Maybe they could not see very well because it was 3 in the morning.  </p>
<p>Another thing I heard from a friend named Matt&hellip; he is a tall white boy.  very athletic and well-built.  He told me he hates police officers in Toronto.  One Saturday morning, a bunch of police officers and seized him and rudely searched him out of nowhere&hellip;. the police officers were looking for a five foot Indian girl who allegedly committed a crime and she was last seen near a public pay phone, and Matt was making a phone call at the public pay phone when the police officers spotted him and rudely searched him.  He said, &#8220;what the beep else am I supposed to do at a phone booth? Isn&rsquo;t that what the beep the public pay phone is for? and do I look like a five foot Indian girl to you?&#8221;</p>
