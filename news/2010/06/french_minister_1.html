<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/10242356.stm">French Minister Hortefeux Fined for Racism</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, June 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A French court has fined Interior Minister Brice Hortefeux for making racist comments about a young party activist of Algerian origin.</p>
<p>The court fined Mr Hortefeux 750 euros (Â£622) and ordered that he pay 2,000 euros to an anti-racism group.</p>
<p>Mr Hortefeux was recorded saying: &#8220;We always need one. It&rsquo;s when there are lots of them that there are problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>He has said he was talking about the number of photos being taken, rather than people of Arab origin.</p>
<p>A lawyer for Mr Hortefeux said he would appeal against he ruling.</p>
<p>The comments were made in September and were broadcast in a video clip that circulated on the internet.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Our little Arab&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Mr Hortefeux was joking with a small group of activists from the ruling UMP party in south-west France.</p>
<p>Immediately before Mr Hortefeux&rsquo;s controversial remark, one activist is heard saying: &#8220;Amin is a Catholic. He eats pork and drinks alcohol.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Hortefeux then says: &#8220;Ah, well that won&rsquo;t do at all. He doesn&rsquo;t match the prototype.&#8221;</p>
<p>A woman is then heard to say: &#8220;He is one of us .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he is our little Arab.&#8221;</p>
<p>The interior minister then says: &#8220;We always need one. It&rsquo;s when there are lots of them that there are problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>The court ruled that his remark was &#8220;incontestably offensive, if not contemptuous&#8221;.</p>
<p>The court did not issue a criminal conviction, judging that Mr Hortefeux had not intended the comments to be heard in public.</p>
<p>It found him guilty instead of the lesser offence of racial insult, AFP news agency reported.</p>
<p>At the time the video emerged, the opposition Socialist Party called for his resignation, saying the comment was &#8220;shameful and unspeakable&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mr Hortefeux is a friend and longstanding ally of President Nicolas Sarkozy.</p>
<p>Mr Hortefeux is known for a tough approach on immigration, and served as immigration minister from 2007-2009.</p>
<p>The activist himself defended the minister in an interview with the newspaper Le Monde.<br>

		<p>It is White French marxists that create anti racism laws.  It is White French marxists that establish open border policies.  It is White French marxists who think that muslims and non Whites can be magically transformed into Frenchmen, if only welfare payments were high enough and the ethereal power of racism could be defeated. </p>
<p>Muslims, Arabs, and various non Whites are not that stupid.  Or suicidal. </p>

<p>What a chilling piece of legislation that must be.  Stand-up comedians must be walking on eggshells in France if they can&rsquo;t use racial stereotypes.</p>

<p>JUST TRY saying something negative against blacks or muslims in the U.S. and you will find out. Mustn&rsquo;t &#8220;outrage&#8221; the blacks or muslims.</p>

		<p>Actually, here in America, Muslims are probably the least protected minority group. Mainstream conservative pundits say very harsh things about Muslims all the time, things that they would never say about blacks.  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s precisely because MOST of the white population would prefer to live in an all white country, that these draconian &#8216;hate&rsquo; laws have been FORCED onto us. Because if it were only a tiny minority of whites who wanted to live in all white countries, then their voices would be drowned out by all the whites who just &#8216;love&rsquo; diversity&hellip;</p>
<p>The defendant should ask the court when the people of France got a VOTE on this law being put on the books&hellip; the court knows full well that it was tyrannically forced onto the French people, and cannot justify that.</p>

<p>Oh, it can&rsquo;t be that bad!  I am sure it&rsquo;s still possible to  stereotype evil white bigots, nazi-like white racists, stupid white rednecks (whatever its French equivalent).  There are plenty of opportunities!    It&rsquo;s only non-whites that are exempt from criticism, and certain other sacred minorities that cannot be discussed except in terms of lavish praise.  Not really so different from here, in fact, when you come right down to it.</p>
<p>  <b> <i>&#8220;Since when have opinions become criminal offences ?&#8221;</i></b></p>
<p>I recall that at the time of Brigitte Bardot&rsquo;s trial, it was stated that  &#8220;racism is not an opinion, it is a crime&#8221;.   So there you have it.  So much for freedom of OPINION in France!</p>
<p>  <b><i>&#8220;Actually, here in America, Muslims are probably the least protected minority group.&#8221;</i></b>  ATBOTL</p>
<p>Precisely.  At least we can discuss THEM, and we do it all the time. Not so with all others. Some groups/things are virtually beyond reproach. We don&rsquo;t have direct laws, but there are other very effective ways of silencing criticism. Just look at Helen Thomas as an illuminating example of how a person can be destroyed virtually overnight.<br>

		<p>Will non-whites have to abide by these laws and have to pay money to an &#8220;anti-racism&#8221; fund if they refuse?  (that was a rhetorical question)</p>

<p>The only I know of is Michael Savage, and even he has death threats at him.   They are ungrateful, hate us, exploit our country, and use our good deeds against us.  Non-whites in any white country don&rsquo;t need nor deserve any protection nor the right to be here in the first place as far as I&rsquo;m concerned. </p>
