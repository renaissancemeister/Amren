			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Adrian Chiles, London Telegraph, June 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On the flight out here I read a rather brilliant essay in The Spectator by the white South Africa writer Rian Malan.</p>
<p>While being somewhat scornful of what he sees as our obsession with crime rates here, he also lacks enthusiasm for what he calls &#8220;the joyous new society Nelson Mandela seems bent on creating&#8221;.</p>
<p>But, after a fine night out in Soweto, he concedes there might be more to what he calls &#8220;this Rainbow Nation guff&#8221; than he thought.</p>
<p>So is it guff or not? I&rsquo;m anxious to know. Two factors hamper my research: firstly, I&rsquo;m not quite sure how to ask the question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had the odd stab at it but find my voice trailing away before I get to the end of the sentence: &#8220;how&rsquo;s the, er, black-white thing, er, going, these days?&#8221; Or &#8220;how are you all, you know, getting along now?&#8221; It sounds fatuous; probably because it is.</p>
<p>My research effort is also restricted by the long hours we&rsquo;re working and our extremely strict security team, who more or less ban us from going anywhere without them.</p>
<p>Accordingly, any conclusions I reach will have to be based on what I see in the only five places I spend time in: our apartment block in the middle-class area of Sandton; the Pick n Pay supermarket nearby; a bar round the corner, and the studio.</p>
<p>With such limited material to go on, every encounter I have assumes vast opinion-forming significance. A good example came at the local hospital  &mdash;  the sixth place I&rsquo;ve spent time at.</p>
<p>Stricken by a very minor eye infection, I was dispatched for a consultation with an embarrassingly eminent eye surgeon. A sign by the entrance to the Morningside Medi-Clinic tells us it was opened in 1985 by some city councillor with a forbidding sounding Afrikaans name  &mdash;  1985! So recent, yet Nelson still had five years to serve and that, you know, apartheid thing, was still happening.</p>
<p>The surgeon, like most white South Africans, looked like a cross between Graeme Hick and Fran√ßois Pienaar. When he asked me which is my dominant eye I couldn&rsquo;t tell him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, how would you hold a rifle?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;Absolutely no idea,&#8221; I replied.</p>
<p>He told me that he treated Mandela. &#8220;What&rsquo;s he like?&#8221; I asked carefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Incredible man,&#8221; he replied, up close and personal, shining a light in my eye. &#8220;Absolutely awesome.&#8221;</p>
<p>I breathed a sigh of relief all over him. Terrific! The Rainbow Nation&rsquo;s a reality. This white eye surgeon likes Mandela so it must be!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ludicrously nice to any black person I meet. Even as I write two women are cleaning the kitchen. They are plainly tiring of my chit-chat; they don&rsquo;t need any more grovelling thanks for doing the ironing. They just want to get the job done and be on their way.</p>
<p>But the encounters I find myself most closely scrutinising are those between black and white people. I find myself straining to capture every sound and movement the white person makes. Is the (white) security guy giving enough respect or our (black) driver? Yes. Good.</p>
<p>In the gym at our apartment block the other day my very white, very muscular, very South African personal trainer was distracted briefly by another client, an Indian woman asking several questions in very poor English. It went on forever. I scoured his face for any sign of race-based irritation, eye-rolling or anything negative at all. Nothing. I on the other hand was glaring at the stupid woman for using up my time.</p>
<p>At the supermarket yesterday I was stuck in the queue behind a big square-shouldered white guy having trouble with his debit card. The black checkout woman kept trying and failing to put it through the machine.</p>
<p>Anxiously, fatuously, I found myself waiting for this dispute to deteriorate and divide along racial lines. The bloke tapped his Blackberry in fury, called his bank, huffed and puffed and shifted his considerable weight from one foot to the other. She looked helpless.</p>
<p>Eventually he barked something into his Blackberry, apologised profusely to the supermarket woman for wasting her time and shouted &#8220;Bloody banks. Useless.&#8221; We all smiled and agreed.</p>
<p>All was well.<br/>

<p>I would like to think that this was a satire by Comrade Chiles, but it is obviously not, given the &ldquo;newspaper&rdquo; it is printed in. It is the typical bloody borscht that Marxist guzzle like vampires on the rampage: ignore all nonwhite pathologies and simply &ldquo;evaluate&rdquo; the &ldquo;racism of whitey,&rdquo; in an &ldquo;unbiased&rdquo; and &ldquo;professional&rdquo; manner. Never mind the white woman being raped by blacks in the context of racial sexual violence, in other words; or the white man being hacked to death with machetes by Pakistanis chanting about &ldquo;revenge&rdquo; in the name of &ldquo;Allah,&rdquo; for that matter. It all boils down to &ldquo;white racism:&rdquo; if the white woman didn&rsquo;t smile while she was being violated and brutalized, she is a &ldquo;racist;&rdquo; or if the white man didn&rsquo;t apologize and prostrate himself like sacrificial lamb while being murdered, than he is just a &ldquo;bigoted throwback.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Calling this &#8220;empty headed rubbish&#8221; is a bit harsh.  The author acknowledged his limitations, and doesn&rsquo;t draw any major conclusions about the current state of racial relations in South Africa.  You didn&rsquo;t take the &#8220;I breathed a sigh of relief all over him. Terrific! The Rainbow Nation&rsquo;s a reality. This white eye surgeon likes Mandela so it must be!&#8221; part seriously did you?</p>

		<p>Frankly, who is he to go over and judge South Africa. You can bet that if he moved over there to live, he would quickly go to the &#8220;White side&#8221; and live in some gated compound with razor wire and armed guards. I suggest if he is so concerned about &#8220;equality&#8221;, he go live in a non-White neighborhood there with no security. I suggest Mr.Chiles put his  money where his mouth is before he talks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Five Australian football fans were among nine people tied up and robbed at gunpoint in a terrifying hold-up in their hotel room following the Australia-Serbia World Cup match in South Africa.</p>
<p>The Nine Network said that one of the female victims was sexually assaulted during the robbery, staged by four armed men at the hotel in Nelspruit.&#8221;</p>
<p>It important to state that these leftists aren&rsquo;t silly airheads who don&rsquo;t understand the truth,  they are totalitarians who knowingly lie in support of anti-white racism,  and the result of their lies is that people are murdered and raped in the streets.   Suppose just one black a month was lynched in Britain the way white farmers and others are lynched for clearly racial reasons in SA, do you think that this Adrian Chiles would be writing an article on how wonderful race relations are in Britain?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all very nice, Mr. Western Liberal Reporter Man. Now about those THREE THOUSAND murdered White farmers&hellip;</p>
<p>Also, note that Mr. Western Liberal Reporter Man asks a question in one paragraph, and then   &mdash;   without realizing he&rsquo;s doing it   &mdash;   answers his own question in the next paragraph. Watch: </p>

The fact that your &#8220;security team&#8221; must be &#8220;extremely strict&#8221; and &#8220;more or less ban you from going anywhere without them&#8221; tells you everything you need to know about &#8220;how the black-white thing is going these days.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Firstly, Rian Malan is viewed by the vast majority of Afrikaners as a traitor ( he is known for his book &#8220;My Traitor&rsquo;s Heart&#8221;).</p>
<p>Secondly, yes, during the WCup there has been a temporary suspension of interracial trifles, but this false sense of &#8220;Simunye-we-are-one-Rainbow-Nation&#8221; will soon fall away when the true and real financial disaster that this WCup (predictably) was becomes clear for all to see. The day that the ANC government admits to the demanding and entitled masses that the money has been looted in order to stage a party, the true rifts will become the basis for riots - and somehow the Whites will be blamed even though we are mostly indifferent to soccer, and fervently fought against it being staged here in SA.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that this journalist isn&rsquo;t being allowed to roam freely through South Africa. This speaks volumes about how the government there is trying to stop the outside world from seeing the real SA. I was hoping that the World Cup would be an opportunity for the world to see what SA is really like, but that obviously isn&rsquo;t going to happen, and the games are nearly over.</p>

		<p> Color blind! Really? He said he visited Morningside Clinic and Pick and Pay.  Has he noted that both these places have car guards to prevent his vehicle being stolen?  Has he noted that these car guards outside these places are mostly White and those working inside are mostly Black?  I hoped he tipped one of these car guards because it is their only means of putting bread on the table.  Only Blacks and professional Whites are allowed inside for jobs.  One of these days there the professional Whites will also not be welcome.  It is already happening, I know, I am here.  Things are not as it seems, you just have to know where to look.  And the guy not loosing his temper - don&rsquo;t be fooled!</p>

		<p>How&rsquo;s it working?  This can be judged by the fact that you have an &#8220;extremely strict security team&#8221; that goes everywhere with you.  If it was working well, Americans and Europeans visiting South Africa wouldn&rsquo;t have to hire security guards to walk around with them.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m glad to read that all the whites in S. Africa are properly grovelling to the blacks there.  Guess that&rsquo;s what ruined their country in the first place.  And now I hear about some of the Africaaners wanting whites from the US to help bail them out.  Sorry, you got yourselves into this mess.  Don&rsquo;t look to us to clean it up for you.  We&rsquo;re busy trying not to let the same thing happen here.</p>

		<p>I doubt that those Australians who were robbed and sexually assaulted, or the journalists who were robbed, or any of the other victims of crime that the MSM isn&rsquo;t reporting on would say the Rainbow Nation is working out.  There&rsquo;s a reason this is the most dangerous World Cup so far (according to Yahoo)-and that reason is 90% black.</p>

		<p>Well, I suppose it&rsquo;s nice that the relentless racist hunter Chiles observed signs of civility and respect between blacks and whites in SA.</p>
<p>Of course, he could come to the US, whether the deep South, mid-West, or Gold Coast and observe the same thing between whites and blacks in their daily dealings.  We&rsquo;re both, blacks and whites, completely civil to one another in normal discourse, and many American blacks and whites genuinely like and enjoy each other&rsquo;s company.  </p>
<p>The simple fact is that overt friction and strife are very much the exception rather than the rule in our day to day living. Of course, people like Chiles find this both remarkable and disappointing, since such realities deny them the chance to display their moral superiority to the rest of us benighted peasants.</p>

		<p>If he wants to see happy integration, he should go to East Flatbush in Brooklyn, NY.  He can casually saunter up to any group of young black men on the corner and strike up a cheerful conversation.  He can do this in Detroit, Atlanta, Cleveland - anywhere really.  As we all know, diversity is our strength.</p>

		<p>Just a little by-note:</p>
<p>Rian Malan is a National Service evader who left South Africa in 1977 at the start of our Border War. He worked as a journalist in Los Angeles. The first thing he did when arriving overseas, was to visit a left-wing, communist bookshop, in order to read all about the ANC.He got converted away from communism in 1983 after meeting a young American David Horowitz, a so called red diaper baby.</p>
