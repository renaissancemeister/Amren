<h1>Haitian Students Now Welcome at South Florida Schools</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nadege Charles, Miami Herald, June 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Haitians ate cats. HBO stood for Haitian Body Odor.</p>
<p>Those were some of the taunts that haunted Fabrice Laguerre as he walked the hallways of North Miami Senior High as a teenager.</p>
<p>Today, Laguerre walks the halls of North Miami as assistant principal, surrounded by mostly Haitian and Haitian-American students who matter-of-factly greet each other in Creole, tie Haitian flags to their backpacks  &mdash;  and welcome newcomers who fled the January earthquake.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8216;NO ONE REALLY KNEW&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;They picked at the way we smelled, the way we looked, the way we talked, everything,&#8221; said Laguerre, 37, who graduated from North Miami in 1990. &#8220;No one really knew about our culture or who we were.&#8221;</p>
<p>That has changed. Of North Miami&rsquo;s 2,750 students, 80 percent consider themselves Haitian or of Haitian descent.</p>
<p>After school, Laguerre hears students singing along to iPod playlists that include popular Haitian artists like Daan Junior and Wyclef Jean. A few weeks ago, students performed Haitian-inspired dances and recited monologues depicting heroes like Jean-Jacques Dessalines, one of the founding fathers of Haiti.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haitians were picked on all the time. Now they are a majority in some of the schools; they have become part of the establishment over time,&#8221; said Monsignor Jean Pierre, who oversees St. James Catholic School in North Miami, where more than 30 earthquake survivors enrolled.</p>
<p>NO BULLYING REPORTED</p>
<p>Miami-Dade and Broward school officials say they have had no reports of earthquake survivors being bullied or harassed. They say the hiring of Creole-speaking instructors over the years has helped newly arrived Haitians make smoother transitions into their classrooms.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rose Dorval&rsquo;s reception was starkly different when she arrived from Haiti at the same age.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She had dreamed of America as a magical country filled with joyful kids. Instead she loathed this new place where classmates at Horace Mann Middle School mocked her uncool outfits: the flowery, poofy church dresses with taffeta underskirts her mother made her wear to school.</p>
<p>She learned to declare in broken English: &#8220;I&rsquo;m not no Haitian.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It was not unusual for Haitian students to deny their heritage, said Deland Innocent, supervisor of the bilingual Creole program for Miami-Dade County Public Schools.</p>
<p>&#8220;The students didn&rsquo;t have many local Haitian role models to look up to. This was before Wyclef and Haitian mayors,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They tried to hide.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A quarter century later, the Haitian community&rsquo;s impact on South Florida is evident in pastel-hued storefronts, elected officials with Haitian surnames and celebrations like the Compas Festival that marks Haitian Heritage Month each May.</p>
<p>But although newly arrived Haitians may find solidarity in numbers, they still carry the burden of being strangers in a new land.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>SITUATION NOT &#8216;ROSY&rsquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Even within the Haitian diaspora, there can be friction between newcomers and those who have been here longer.</p>
<p>North Miami High senior Maxi Samuel, who arrived one month after the earthquake, said some classmates of Haitian descent teased him for being &#8220;the boy from Haiti.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not no Haitian.&#8221;? According to what I daily hear on the bus, this isn&rsquo;t &#8220;broken&#8221; at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They picked at the way we smelled, the way we looked, the way we talked, everything.&#8221; So I guess in this new world of diversity, we also have to be tolerant of other people&rsquo;s odors. Yeah, shame on me for forcing my ethnocentric ideal of regular bathing on other people! Don&rsquo;t I know that there are those whose cultures don&rsquo;t include sanitation? Someone alert Obama- I think next month should be&#8221; Multihygenic Awareness Month: Raising Awareness about the ways other cultures lovingly embrace the totality of the human body (as opposed to those self-hating Westerners who use animal tested, anti-environmental SHAMPOO &amp; kill millions of innocent bacteria with their HANDSOAP!!!!!)</p>

		<p>What is the point in bringing Haitian &#8220;refugees&#8221; to the US?  Unless the Feds were to bring EVERY single Haitian to the US the ones left behind will still have a crummy life.  So why bring any?  Why not just send them food and medicine and building supplies?  It makes no sense.  Either all or none.</p>

<p>- wait a minute.  I thought there was no racism or chauvanism among minorities.  This statement is bursting my Avatar inspired bubble.  I thought &#8216;diverse&rsquo; peoples were all good and noble and only whty was cruel and capable of taunting.</p>

		<p>I bet the Cubans are pissed.They took over Miami 20 years ago.The entire article is hilarious.LOL&hellip; Haitian culture? Are you serious? I live in cenral Florida and unfortunately I have been forced to work with Haitians so I experienced their &#8220;culture&#8221; first hand, especially in the employees restrooms.I won&rsquo;t go into detail I&rsquo;ll just say that toilets are foriegn to their &#8220;culture&#8221;,they think any where close to the bowl is close enough. There were many fights among them (they don&rsquo;t even get along with each other )and even a machete attack. There were several incidents of chicken bones arranged in such a way as to put a Voodoo hex on the plant manager and all supervisors.I kid you not,I&rsquo;m very serious.I guess we didn&rsquo;t &#8220;embrace&#8221; their culture enough. This is just what America needs,more rude,ill mannered, uneducated and seriously dangerous foriegners invading our shores, demanding social services, jobs and civil rights etc.etc. I don&rsquo;t know what the hell it&rsquo;s gonna take for Americans to wake up.We just keep watching liberal run media and minority controlled sports and have another beer! Stick your head up your butt and ignore the obvious.If we keep this up it&rsquo;s gonna be too late. God bless america and Teach your children well.</p>

<p>  I know your speaking the truth MM. Most liberal brainwashed Yankees don&rsquo;t realize how superstitious your average semi-educated Southern black really is.  I&rsquo;ve seen all sorts of &#8220;Hoodoo&#8221; and &#8220;Voodoo&#8221; signs and activity in both Louisiana and South Carolina. These are from blacks, who have been removed from Haiti and Africa for many generations. When I leave academia, I could probably make a good living as a Creole white witch doctor or &ldquo;Hougan&rdquo;.</p>

		<p><i>She had dreamed of America as a magical country filled with joyful kids. Instead she loathed this new place where classmates at Horace Mann Middle School mocked her uncool outfits</i></p>
<p>First of all, who told her that America was &#8220;filled with joyful kids?&#8221; A &#8220;land of promise?&#8221; Maybe. &#8220;a land of joyful kids?&#8221; Hardly. This is clearly pure invention for propaganda purposes. Secondly, she came to &#8220;loath&#8221; America simply because some classmates teased her? Shows the kind of people we&rsquo;re bringing here.</p>
<p><i>She learned to declare in broken English: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not no Haitian.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><i>{snip}</i></p>
<p><i>It was not unusual for Haitian students to deny their heritage</i></p>
<p>Oh, that was &#8220;denying her heritage? I thought that was her way of saying she is now an American.  Thank you, MSM, for telling me the right way to think about this.</p>
<p><i> Haitians ate cats. HBO stood for Haitian Body Odor.</i></p>
<p>Who do you think called them this? Notice the article is suspiciously silent on this matter. It was American-born blacks who called them this, not whites.</p>

<p><br>
Not true, Monsieur Laguerre! Allow me to demonstrate how much this ignorant white American knows about &#8220;your culture and who you are&#8221;&hellip; </p>
<p><br>
Who you are: You are black former slaves who for 200 years have been running a failed state predicated on a genocidal revolt against Europeans. You speak a mangled, slangy version of French. Your median IQ is around 70, same as in Africa. </p>
<p>Your culture: Your national religion is a dumbed-down and Africanized Catholicism called Vodou, which involves sticking pins in dolls and leaving slaughtered chickens in public places. Your average annual income is the lowest in all of the Americas, North, South or Central. Your average life expectancy is only half that of a First Worlder. Your rates of rape and violent crimes are astronomical. Your main industry is receiving freebies from international aid agencies and the governments of other countries. Your main export is poor people   &mdash;   who are often so desperate to leave Haiti that they risk their lives on rafts to get away. </p>
<p>See? I know LOTS about Haitians. So do many other ordinary Americans. That&rsquo;s why we don&rsquo;t want you here. <br>
