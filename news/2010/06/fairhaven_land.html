<h1>Fairhaven Land Advertised for &#8216;Caucasians Only&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Beth Germano, WBZ-TV (Boston), June 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There was a notice in the New Bedford Standard Times newspaper indicating land for sale in the town of Fairhaven, but it wasn&rsquo;t for everyone.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The ad read, &#8220;The said land shall not be sold, leased or rented to any person other than of the Caucasian race or to any entity of which any person other than that of said race shall be a member, stockholder, officer or director.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In fact, records at Fairhaven Town Hall reveal a deed dating back to 1946, when the property was subdivided and a covenant established which the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD) calls &#8220;unlawful and unenforceable under Massachusetts statute.&#8221;</p>
<p>The language used then is still used now, and the Harmon law firm in Newton which placed the ad said in a statement, &#8220;This notice involves a restriction that a previous owner placed on the property. We do not condone the language and do not believe it would be enforceable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mandi Costa wants to be sure, which is why she filed a discrimination suit. &#8220;Discrimination is alive and well and this is a primary example of something that says we&rsquo;re not equal yet. This is why I&rsquo;m trying to bring light to everyone,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>MCAD is now looking into the legal notice and whether any laws were broken when it was published.</p>

		<p>Wasn&rsquo;t there a case, where a newspaper refused to carry a paid advertisement simply announcing the date and time, and nothing more, of a speech Jared Taylor was to give on diversity? Actually, I believe every newspaper refused to print the ad. Then, the same newspapers later wrote lengthy opinion pieces about how they were brave champions of free speech, and condemned Mr. Taylor being roughed up while attempting to give his, &#8216;Banned in Halifax&rsquo; speech. </p>

<p>Where is William Lloyd Garrison when Boston needs him?</p>
<p>The north was all holy and good and pure on the race question.</p>
<p>  How could it be that Boston, that Shining City on a Hill, that beacon of hope and equality and justice for all, would have had a White raciss who didn&rsquo;t want his land sold to non whites? Unthinkable!</p>
<p>How is this even possible?  Didn&rsquo;t the Massachusetts yankees destroy the South to wipe out this kind of race prejudice?</p>
<p>Oh, my, we have more work to do!<br>

		<p>I am curious to know, what possible benefit could Ms. Germano receive by writing the above news article. Moreover, what would inspire anyone to even think of pursuing such a remote and inconsequential topic. Truly, there are those among the white race who hate themselves, their own kind, more then any non white could ever hate.</p>

		<p>Freedom of association is a fundamental human right. The very idea that the government is in the business of telling people who they can live next to is nothing less than tyranny. It has nothing to do with equal rights. No one has the right to force another person to sell his home to him through the threat of force by government. </p>

		<p>For some reason this has become a racial issue even though it was and still is a cultural issue. It&rsquo;s not necessarily about the colour of their skin but their way of life that we don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want most non-Whites living next to me because most of the time they drag down the value of my property by association to people who like loud ethnic music until early hours of the morning, their lack of respect for their neighbours (being me in this case), and the associated crime in the form of drugs and violence that comes with the backwards cultures and poor morals that they have adopted as their own. This holds true for the so-called &#8220;White Trash&#8221; too, I don&rsquo;t want to live next to them either!</p>

		<p>Right, this is what is called a white covenant. Was ruled by the Supreme Court to be illegal around 1947 or so. Was legal to include such language in a contract prior to that. I believe the decision of the Court was based upon a case that occurred in Chicago. When you bought a house with a white covenant, you the buyer agreed to ONLY sell the property to another white person when YOU sold the house. Sounds beyond belief NOW, doesn&rsquo;t it? Was quite common at one time.</p>

		<p>Somewhere once I read about the NAACP sending agitators into all-white neighborhoods, with the instruction to demand to be able to purchase a home in that neighborhood.  Wished I could remember the source, but I do remember it very well.  The NAACP would offer to pay the cost of the home for the black family.  The term used for this action was, &#8220;block-busting.&#8221;  Their M.O. was that there should not be a single neighborhood in America that did not have at least one black family.  Here in Memphis, formally all-white neighborhoods are all-black now.  Cause once the blacks began moving in, the whites fled to other parts of town.  Needless to say that those neighborhoods are in dismal condition now.  Apartment complexes are the same way.  Once too many blacks move in, the whites begin moving out.  Of course they refer to whites that flee black intrusion, yes you guessed it, racists!  </p>

		<p>Suing over this is like filing a suit because someone&rsquo;s ancestor was a slave or a white woman who was denied the vote.  There&rsquo;s a very interesting book called Sundown Towns that examines the exclusion of non-whites.  Though written by a liberal, it&rsquo;s jammed with facts that readers can interpret for themselves.  I learned, for instance, that following the Civil War, many blacks relocated to small towns in the North and Midwest.  Within a couple of decades, however, whites were running a lot of these folks out, whereupon most ended up settling in big-city enclaves.  The author claims that the reason for the expulsions must have been an increase in racism because the Democrats had come to power  &mdash;  as though people just change their social views according to whoever is in office!  Of course, liberals always have to come up with some nebulous reason for the obvious.  To me, it seems obvious that these newly-freed blacks were behaving in some manner that the whites did not like.  People in the South were used to it and knew how to deal with it.<br>
Most, if not all, of land covenants came about to keep real estate speculators from block-busting and thus lowering the price of land.  As whites moved out, the land buyers would divide up houses and rent to blacks at inflated prices, or they would sell to them on land contracts, which would often fail.  </p>

<p>This is 55th st. on the south side of Chi. Marquette Boulevard. Over 100 years ago, this is where all the executives working at the Union Stockyards built their mansions. Was very upscale. Then when speculators bought the homes decades later, divided them into apartments and the entire area deteriorated very badly and very quickly. Most are gone now. But you can still see here and there that something very impressive existed at one time.</p>

<p>Well, culture flows from race.  It&rsquo;s wired in the DNA.  You might be able to get a few blacks to adhere to our cultural norms by placing them in a neighborhood where they&rsquo;re greatly outnumbered by Whites but place them back in their own enviroment they will quickly revert back to theirs.  They really do not understand the value of our norms and cannot pass it on to other blacks, they are merely immitating a behaviour. <br>

<p>Very simple!  You&rsquo;re supposed to stay right there, socialize with them,  marry one of them,  play their music, eat their food, celebrate their festivals,  and even adopt a few of their children. In other words, give up your entire culture and convert to theirs.  </p>

		<p>This exclusionist covenant is probably nothing at all unusual   &mdash;   although it&rsquo;s being treated as an oddity now. I think it was probably quite standard in real estate contracts of the time (pre-WW2).</p>
<p>I know that the deed to  my parent&rsquo;s house contains such a clause. However, it was invalidated by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, if not before (#8 says it was about 1947). WW2 really changed everything   &mdash;   far more than we ever anticipated when we got into it.</p>

<p>According to leftists, America was a place of horrible segregation. If so, they wouldn&rsquo;t have needed these housing covenants. </p>
