<h1>Pakistan Scans Google, Other Sites for Blasphemy</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Asif Shahzad, Google News, June 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Pakistan will monitor seven major websites, including Google and Yahoo, to block anti-Islamic links and content, an official said Friday. Seventeen lesser-known sites are being blocked outright for alleged blasphemous material.</p>
<p>The moves follow Pakistan&rsquo;s temporary ban imposed on Facebook in May that drew both praise and condemnation in a country that has long struggled to figure out how strict a version of Islam it should follow.</p>
<p>Both the Facebook ban and the move announced Friday were in response to court orders. The sites to be monitored include those of Yahoo Inc., Google Inc. and its YouTube service, Amazon.com Inc. and MSN, Hotmail and Bing from Microsoft Corp., said Pakistan Telecommunication Authority spokesman Khurram Mehran.</p>
<p>&#8220;If any particular link with offensive content appears on these websites, the (link) shall be blocked immediately without disturbing the main website,&#8221; Mehran said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mehran said an example of one of the 17 sites being blocked include islamexposed.blogspot.com, which is a blog created through Google&rsquo;s Blogger service. That site features postings with headlines such as &#8220;Islam: The Ultimate Hypocrisy&#8221; and links to anti-Islam online petitions.</p>
<p>Mehran said that, under instructions from the Ministry of Information Technology, the authority had begun the process of barring and monitoring the various sites.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Facebook controversy sparked a handful of protests across Pakistan, many by student members of radical Islamic groups. Some of the protesters carried signs advocating holy war against the website for allowing the page.</p>
<p>It also sparked a good deal of soul-searching, especially among commentators, who questioned why Pakistanis could not be entrusted to decide for themselves whether or not to look at a website.</p>
<p>Some observers noted that Pakistan had gone further than several other Muslim countries by banning Facebook, and said it showed the rise of conservative Islam in the country. {snip}</p>

		<p>If Muslims really were so very terrified of coming into contact with &#8220;blasphemy&#8221;, then why is it they cannot wait to flood into a Western nation?</p>
<p>If such a real fear existed, every Muslim nation on earth would be like North Korea, the population controlled and kept in the dark at any cost&hellip;.no one leaves and certainly no one enters.</p>
<p>This has nothing to do with Muslims or Muslim behaviors.  It has to do with white dhimmitude.  They want to see if whites will obey them in this.  Because if they will, they will obey them in other things.</p>
<p>This is about domination.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Seventeen lesser-known sites are being blocked outright for alleged blasphemous material.&#8221;</p>
<p>First they will just block.</p>
<p>Then they will later ask to IDENTIFY the &#8220;culprits&#8221;.</p>
<p>Then they will say to extradite the &#8220;culprits&#8221;.</p>
<p>Or they will ask or demand the host nation to punish or silence the &#8220;culprits&#8221;.</p>
<p>YOU are causing grave bodily harm to a Muslim and Pakistani, so they will say, by posting &#8220;bad&#8221; material on these web sites about Islam. Bodily harm to include psychological damage. </p>
<p>EVEN when not actually reading the material &#8220;damage&#8221; is done just by knowing that the material is out there.</p>
<p>This is how it will go down!! Please forgive me for using that term &#8220;go down&#8221; but I could not hesitate.</p>

		<p>The Facebook controversy - not actually described in the abbreviated summary above - was over a &#8220;Let&rsquo;s Draw the Prophet&#8221; contest a small group arranged.  Apparantly, some entries included snouts, curly tails and pointed ears.</p>

		<p>Looking for blasphemy? The same method that O.J. could have used to find Nichole Simpson and Ron Goldman&rsquo;s killer would serve well here. They should look in the mirror to find the true blasphemers of the real GOD. Since satan is the true personification of all that is evil this quote applies. JESUS SAID: &#8220;If you are not against me you are for me.&#8221; All the devil has to do to succeed is to get you to follow [ANY] other entity, or even none. &#8220;Let those who have eyes see, let those who have ears hear.&#8221;</p>
