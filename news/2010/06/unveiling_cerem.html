<h1>Unveiling Ceremony for Plaques Recognizing Slaves Who Built Capitol</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robin Caldwell, Politic365, June 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Speaker Nancy Pelosi hosted an unveiling ceremony for plaques to recognize the contributions of enslaved African Americans in the construction of the United States Capitol this afternoon in the Rayburn Room of the Capitol.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rep. [John] Lewis&rsquo; online office has a brief history posted of the role slaves played in the Capitol&rsquo;s construction,</p>
<p>Enslaved African-Americans played an integral part in the construction of the U.S.Capitol working as carpenters, masons, rafters, roofers, plasterers, painters,and glazers working in quarries, in addition to many other occupations. Slave women and children were used to mold clay in kilns. All of the slaves worked 12-hour days, six days a week and were paid five dollars a month which was given to their owners. There were more than 400 slaves involved in the construction of the Capitol who were rented from area plantations.</p>
<p>One place where the handiwork of slaves is visible is in the Capitol&rsquo;s Statuary Hall, which is a former meeting place for the House of Representatives that has been turned into an art gallery. {snip}</p>
<p>In her remarks, Speaker Pelosi noted,</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the past decade, the Slave Labor Task Force worked to document the history of slave laborers who constructed the walls of the United States Capitol. {snip} Out of a dark chapter in our past, an age of equality denied, rights refused, a dream not yet realized, these masons, carpenters, painters, and others gave us this house of liberty and this beacon of hope for our nation, and indeed, the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;History books up until now had not reported their story, nor described the pivotal role they played in erecting the Capitol. That the tale will be written forever into these walls, etched into this structure, and spoken from this marble chamber. {snip}</p>

<p>My biggest objection to this monument is that it does nothing to honor the modern day slaves who are slaving away more than six months a year to fund the government housed inside that Capitol.</p>

		<p>Although, obviously, the details were different, America enters a similar stage as Russia did after the Bolshevik revolution of 1917.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s American Bolsheviks don&rsquo;t call themselves Bolsheviks, they do not resort to violently revolutional methods (not yet) that Russian Bolsheviks did, and they prefer to hide behind others. But they impose, little by little, their hostile dictatorship on once free nation. And insults like the one described in the article just show how arrogantly do they exercise their power to control speech and thought.</p>
<p>Those who are interested in doing something about it may wish to begin from studying the history of the civil rights movement in 1950ties and 1960ties. Unless you have already done that, you will be surprised what you find out, I guarantee it.<br>

Think of all the great things blacks accomplished as slaves. Compare that to what they&rsquo;re achieved with their freedom.</p>
<p>For the sake of blacks, I suggest we re-enslave blacks so they can again be as great as they once were.</p>

<p>The answer is yes, unfortunately.  The biggest reason why slavery was bad for the average white Southerner before the War is that the presence of all this free labor precluded the development and growth of a bourgeoise middle class of skilled workers and artisans that there was north of the M-D line.  The main parallel you can find today with it is cheap labor Hispanic immigration.</p>

		<p>And where are all the &#8220;carpenters, masons, rafters, roofers, plasterers, painters, and glazers&#8221; in the crumbling cities of Africa? Where are they in Haiti? Is that why white nations have to send billions of dollars of aid there?</p>

<p>I wonder how many plaques there are going to be in the U.S. commemorating the black Africans who were sold into slavery by other black Africans? I wonder how many plaques there are in Africa commemorating this?</p>
<p>On second thought, never mind. I don&rsquo;t wonder at all.</p>
<p>The only thing it is important for blacks to remember is when the &#8220;white man done them wrong,&#8221; never the countless and myriad ways in which they do wrong to each other.</p>

		<p>You know what?  I&rsquo;m not going to begrudge them a plaque.  They played a role, and a plaque is appropriate.  In fact, a plaque recognizing them specifically is fine too.</p>
<p>I do object to PC awkward phrasing such as &#8220;enslaved African-Americans&#8221; though.  They were just slaves, that&rsquo;s it.  They sure weren&rsquo;t Americans, since they weren&rsquo;t US citizens, and until 1808 many were straight off the boat.</p>
<p>And I wouldn&rsquo;t support any white guilt nonsense either - no &#8220;dark chapter&#8221;, no hand-wringing, keep it matter-of-fact.</p>
<p>What I DO object to, though is the impressive main hall of the Capitol Visitors Center being named Emancipation Hall.  That name was tacked on at the last minute when blacks began whining that the new underground wing of the Capitol, and the Capitol overall, wasn&rsquo;t black enough.  In effect, blacks hijacked the hall, and made it all about them, when it&rsquo;s meant to be a general, all-American area that welcomes visitors from all over the world.   And calling it Emancipation Hall is stupid.  The Emancipation Proclamation wasn&rsquo;t written or signed there; it didn&rsquo;t exist until a few years ago.</p>

<p>I suppose it&rsquo;ll be discovered that Pierre L&rsquo;Enfant had a black helper who was the actual designer of the city of Washington, DC, while L&rsquo;Enfant spent his time in a boozy fog and collected all the credit. This historical fact has been hidden until now because of White Racism. But you can&rsquo;t hide the truth forever. It&rsquo;s going to be uncovered any day now.</p>
<p>And the Lewis And Clark Expedition which explored the Louisiana Territory had a &#8220;black slave&#8221; along as a helper, so we&rsquo;ve always been told. But, the truth is, he was actually leading the expedition because those helpless white males would have been lost without him. Another racist distortion!  Let the truth finally come out!</p>

<p>To a certain degree, they were. But they were TRAINED in all of these skills and trades   &mdash;    by whites. These refined skills did not come with the blacks from Africa!  They had to be taught.(And who taught them?)</p>
<p>However, when you study the architecture of old southern mansions and such   &mdash;   when it came to the finer aspects, such as carved plaster, fine woodwork, elegant furniture   &mdash;   this highly skilled work was done by expert craftsmen imported from Europe.  These experts might have had a black helper assigned to learn the trade, and who mixed the plaster or sawed the wood, but the master craftsman was European.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Why not just have a plaque commemorating &#8220;the workers&#8221; who erected the building?  ALL the workers. Period!<br>
Why divide people by race and select certain groups for special mention?</p>
<p>I object to any attempt to break down people into groups by race or ethnicity, and single out any certain group or groups for special credit. Why are no other groups mentioned?  Did nobody else work on the capitol? Where are they?  (Example: the supervising architect of the construction was Irish, James Hoban (he also designed the White House.  Were the Irish singled out for special credit?   The designer of the dome was August Schoenborn, a German.  Why were Germans not mentioned? Why should they be? How would that be relevant?)</p>
<p>The point to be made here is that  <b>this is the current strategy  </b>of the Marxist Left and the Democratic Party: to fragment society into various disgruntled groups and  aggrieved factions, and then to play off each one against the other or against the Majority.  The Democrats are a coalition of cranky &#8220;minority&#8221; groups with chips on their shoulders. They thrive on division and pandering to old grudges.  They shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to get away with this trick without challenge.</p>
<p> <i>When the Capitol was expanded in the 1850s, some of the construction labor was carried out by slaves  <b>&#8220;who cut the logs, laid the stones, and baked the bricks&#8221;.  </b><br>
The original plan was to use workers brought in from Europe; however, there was a poor response to recruitment efforts, and African Americans &mdash; slave  <b>and free </b> &mdash; composed the majority of the work force. </i>  [Wiki]</p>

		<p>I hope you know me by my posts. (See above.)</p>
<p>I propose that we do NOT blame blacks for being blacks. In particular, that we do not disparage black slaves for being slaves.</p>
<p>They are no more whites&rsquo; enemies than members of any other racial group. Whatever characteristics they may have, it tends to follow a bell curve (normal distribution, that is) descriptive of their race. One can analyze the (statistical) differences between the races, and there certainly are many, but they were born that way of which they had no choice. I am not saying that a person should be shielded from the consequences of his own character and actions, but blaming, say, squirrel for not remembering where did it bury its nuts is irrational. </p>
<p>Those who broke ethical or legal rules should be accountable for for their misbehavior, but not for a lack of particular skill or mental quality.</p>
<p>The ones who deserve blame here are the self-appointed intermediaries. They indoctrinate blacks and implant racial hatred in their minds. They deliver venom to interracial relations making already difficult situation (two distinct races living together in one country) unbearable. When you see blacks chanting &#8220;we can whatever we want&#8221; with redistributive motives being quite transparent, it&rsquo;s the result of that indoctrination.</p>
<p>Obviously, the above is a very general description that is only statistically accurate, so that one can find several individual counterexamples that go against the tendency, but it paints the big picture that we should not forget or ignore.</p>
<p>This is how you can, usually, tell a really high-IQed person: he does not exhibit a tendency of looking down on or making fun of those less intelligent. Just like a civilized person does not belittle or make fun of a handicapped one. We may wish not to put ourselves in to the less-intelligent-but-more-arrogant category.</p>

		<p>Quite right, it is uncouth to blame blacks for being blacks.  Sometimes I sympathise with them.  It must be very frustrating&hellip; certain whites have convinced them that they have equal abilities and yet everywhere they look they see unequal outcomes, so who are they going to blame?</p>
<p>The real evil lies with the whites who have created this situation.  Deep down some of them must know that it&rsquo;s wrong, against human nature like communism was but they can&rsquo;t back-pedal now and the whole egalitarian doctrine just leads to more absurdities and in all probability frustrates blacks more and more.</p>
<p>These whites are the real enemy, they have been all along.  When the chips are down, these people should go on trial for crimes against their own people.  I don&rsquo;t wish blacks any ill-will though, I just don&rsquo;t want to live with them.  They need to all be put back in Africa where they can undergo some evolution slaughtering each other and then maybe they can join the table in another thousand years or so..</p>

		<p>Truth be known, virtually every recent major public works project today in the metro DC area has significant labor contributions from the &#8220;velvet slaves&#8221; of the &#8220;Brown Sub-North American Continent&#8221;.</p>

<p>That sums it up for me, &amp; probably for most readers of this site.  It&rsquo;s infuriating that we can&rsquo;t discuss this openly w/o being called vile names, at the very least, or worse, running the risk of genuine hardship. Who decided that anything less than rapturous enthusiasm for blacks would be regarded as some kind of heresy?</p>

		<p>I took a tour of the Mammoth cave national park recently. The most important information the tour-guide had for us, and the most important thing in the history of the caves, was that slaves had once lived near the grounds or worked on the cave or helped restore it at one time. I don&rsquo;t even believe the story we were told. </p>
<p>As an added bonus, the park ranger guide commented on Obama, saying, with Obama, &#8220;looks like we&rsquo;re going to have some honest leadership for a change&#8221;.</p>

<p>And on this article, so many people of all different races made the capitol what it is.  Perhaps much of the grunt work was done by slaves but so what? Do we need plaques in cotton fields and on roads too just because blacks worked there? Get over it, we brought you to a better place and you are now looking this gift horse in the mouth.</p>
