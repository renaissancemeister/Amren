<h1><a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0616/1224272616926.html">Number of Migrants Voting in Local Elections Rises 44%</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alison Healy, Irish Times, June 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>THERE WAS a 44 per cent increase in the number of immigrants who voted in last year&rsquo;s local elections, following a campaign which encouraged more immigrants to register and vote.</p>
<p>The campaign, by the Africa Centre and the New Communities Partnership, aimed to encourage 10,0000 more immigrants in 10 local authority areas to get involved in the June elections. An additional 15,681 immigrants registered and voted in those 10 areas.</p>
<p>While Irish citizens may vote in all elections and referendums, non-EU citizens may only vote in local elections. British citizens may vote in DÃ¡il, European and local elections, while other EU citizens outside Britain may vote in European and local elections.</p>
<p>Eric Yao, of the Africa Centre, said there had been an increase in immigrant candidates standing for election and &#8220;although we didn&rsquo;t see a lot of immigrant candidates winning the election, we think this is a first step in the right direction&#8221;.</p>
<p>Prof Bryan Fanning of UCD&rsquo;s school of applied social studies said immigrants would not have political clout until a significant number became Irish citizens.</p>
<p>He said almost half of all applications for citizenship from eligible long-term residents were turned down in Ireland, compared with just 9 per cent in the UK.</p>
<p>&#8220;So civil servants pretty much are saying that one in two immigrants will never get to vote in this country,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Comparatively speaking, there is something odd about how the Irish State is responding to immigrants. There is something very, very impoverished about its commitment to integration.&#8221;</p>
<p>He urged immigrant communities to focus on a campaign of turning immigrants into Irish citizens. &#8220;If a significant number of immigrants are Irish citizens, political parties are interested in immigrants all the way along. They are interested potentially in grooming immigrant candidates for general elections,&#8221; Prof Fanning said.</p>
<p>He pointed to the possibility that Dublin citizens would elect their lord mayor for the first time later this year and said if immigrants were on the voting register their views could be reflected in the city&rsquo;s politics.</p>
<p>Issah Huseini, of the New Communities Partnership, said it took an immigrant at least eight years to have the right to vote in a general election here, as it took five years to apply for citizenship and another three for the process to be completed. &#8220;It reinforces the perception that immigrants are outsiders notwithstanding the number of years they&rsquo;ve lived in the country,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Minister of State for Integration Mary White said it was &#8220;vital&#8221; that immigrants be encouraged to participate to the greatest extent possible in the political system.</p>
<p>&#8220;People from migrant backgrounds bring a new perspective, experience and vision to local and national politics,&#8221; she said.<br>

<p>Though I&rsquo;ve never set foot in Ireland, I still have a compelling desire to see the island kept pure of non-whites.  I think it comes from a strictly rational belief in conservatism and preservation of that which is rare.  Defending it is a duty handed down in the bloodlines.<br>

 <br>
I Feel the same way. I&rsquo;m of many European ancestrys; German, Italian, Irish, Scottish, English. I&rsquo;ve never been to any of those countries but I can&rsquo;t understand when I express concern for the situation over there and other white people look at and ask &#8220;why do you care about over there?&#8221;. I usually can&rsquo;t find the words to explain it. It&rsquo;s something primordial.</p>

		<p>I am an American of mostly German and Czech ancestry and I have been fortunate enough to travel much of Germany, Nothern Italy, Eastern Europe and Scandinavia. </p>
<p>The sight of Germany pains me the most. However, I also am depressed by the situations in nations I have no ancestry in. Meanwhile I celebrate the racial homogeneity in Poland, even as I also have no ties there. </p>
<p>Europe is our second home. Above all, our right to existence throughout the globe depends on the preservation of Europe. She is the mother of our people and I honestly believe her demise would be the greatest damage to our cause.  </p>

<p>Those white people annoy me!  Oh, it&rsquo;s racist and stupid of us to worry what&rsquo;s going on in a white continent (Europe), but we should drop our interests and desires for non-whites (like New Orleans or Haiti, for example)?  </p>

		<p>As an island with fewer than 6 million people (and fewer than 4 million in the Republic of Ireland), Ireland is in quite a shaky posiiton. They don&rsquo;t have tens of millions of white natives to protect them from quick obliteration like the UK, France, and Germany do. A flood of immigrants could probably flood Ireland in just a matter of a couple of decades.</p>

<p>The suggestion was made not so long ago that to keep the Celtic Tiger economy booming, forty thousand migrants minimum were needed for a twenty year period just to keep the economy growing. A minimum. At that rate, within just one generation Ireland would go from an almost all-white nation to a nation that would contain a very significant non-white population.</p>
<p>Insanity or what? But a suggestion taken very seriously.</p>

<p>The underlying idelogy of the Left  (i.e.Marxism) is that nationalism equals racism, and all nationalism is a form of fascism. Of course, fascism is the mortal enemy of the Marxists. <br>
Hence, all nationalism/racism must be eliminated at any cost&hellip;even at the extinction of the native people of the land, since Marxists claim to be totally indifferent to race (being that it&rsquo;s merely a &#8220;social construct&#8221; and doesn&rsquo;t really exist). Indeed, replacing your own people would be a sign of tolerance and anti-racism that could be flaunted as a demonstration of moral superiority. </p>
<p>Silly fools! Yes, they are &#8220;electing a new people&#8221;, and it is no accident. The importation of exotic races is a deliberate plan, almost never alluded to publicly   &mdash;   although that admission recently slipped out in Britain.</p>
