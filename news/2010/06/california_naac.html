			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Wyatt Buchanan, San Francisco Chronicle, June 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The California NAACP has endorsed a November ballot measure to legalize adult recreational use of marijuana, calling the measure a civil rights issue because blacks have a disproportionate number of arrests for marijuana possession compared with whites.</p>
<p>Accompanied by other African American leaders in California, the president of the state NAACP, Alice Huffman, said the current prohibition on marijuana has led to the criminalizing of young people and consequently has hampered the ability of many African Americans to prosper.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not a war on the drug lords, this is a war against young men and women of color,&#8221; Huffman said, adding later that, &#8220;Once a young person is arrested and brought under the justice system, he or she is more likely to get caught in the criminal justice system again, further wasting tax dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In announcing support, African American leaders pointed to a report that shows that in the 25 largest counties in California, blacks are arrested for possession of marijuana at rates that are as much as four times as high as those for white people. Those arrested are overwhelmingly young men.</p>
<p>Black people 18 to 25 years old use marijuana less frequently than whites, according to federal data in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.</p>
<p>The report was written by Harry Levine, a sociology professor at Queens College at the City University of New York, who has researched similar trends in New York City. It was released by the Drug Policy Alliance, which is backing the ballot measure.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a nutshell, the police are assigned heavily to patrol only in certain neighborhoods and in those neighborhoods they are looking for certain suspects who are young, who are male,&#8221; Levine said, adding that police would make more arrests for marijuana possession if they focused on areas with higher concentrations of whites.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the support is not shared throughout that community, as many black religious leaders are in opposition.</p>
<p>Bishop Ron Allen, leader of the International Faith Based Coalition and a member of the coalition opposing Prop. 19, said he was &#8220;shocked, stunned and surprised&#8221; by the endorsement and said it is not a civil rights issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;If anyone should know what illicit drugs will do to an underserved community, we expect our civil rights leaders to have a better understanding than anyone else,&#8221; he said.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d vote for Prop 19, but not because of race or &#8220;disparate impact.&#8221;  But the NAACP&rsquo;s reasoning is suspect.</p>
<p>First off, blacks aren&rsquo;t the only non-whites in California.  Second, a &ldquo;marijuana arrest&rdquo; can be for more than just simple possession of a small amount  &mdash;  One can be arrested for dealing, or transporting large quantities (&ldquo;with intent to distribute.&rdquo;)  Third, while I think the studies of weed usage are right, the reason blacks are arrested more often than whites is that white users are better at hiding their usage  &mdash;  black users tend to do something ostentatious in public, which only draws attention to their use.  Fourth, the 42% of those arrested (for either usage, dealing or transporting) under the age of 20 won&rsquo;t be helped by this proposal, because it only applies to possession of small quantities, and only if you&rsquo;re at least 21.</p>
<p>(Just in case you&rsquo;re wondering, I wouldn&rsquo;t advise one to smoke weed, even if it were legal.  It has long term negative irreparable neurological consequences, plus the plant that used to harvest marijuana very easily absorbs toxic poisons that may be present in the soil, e.g. cadmium, and concentrates it in the resin that is smoked.)</p>

		<p>I support legalizing marijuana.  That being said, might the NAACP do one better and implement anti-drug use campaigns?  </p>
<p>&#8220;The president of the state NAACP, Alice Huffman, said the current prohibition on marijuana has led to the criminalizing of young people and consequently has hampered the ability of many African Americans to prosper.&#8221;<br>
NO, Huffman, it&rsquo;s their DRUG USE (among other things) that is hampering their ability to prosper!  No one is forcing them to do illegal drugs but they ARE required to abide by the law&hellip;is that really so surprising?  I don&rsquo;t support changing the law to excuse certain actions, especially when it&rsquo;s racially motivated (which this shouldn&rsquo;t be).  <br>
Amnesty for illegals, anyone??<br>

		<p>One of the secrets the dems never talk about is how drugs became illegal in the first place.  The answer is religious groups demanded it.  One of the strongest voices were black churches.</p>
<p>That has not changed.  For the same reason blacks don&rsquo;t get along with gays, they don&rsquo;t get along with the pro-legalization crowd.  If the NAACP is now endorsing drug use, well, that is basically the end of any funding they get from blacks.</p>

		<p>The majority of blacks arrested is not from just smoking weed or those who have a little on them. WE all know that!  They are arrested for hard core drugs and horrific crimes for the most part. Will the NAACP ever acknowledge that fact? No.</p>

		<p>When legalized, medical marijuana will surely be a &#8220;covered&#8221; drug, dispensed for everything from hangnails to stress from not having a job and being on the dole.</p>

		<p>The NAACP has to continue to appear relevant, so it craves the spotlight and will take any controversial position to put it there.  All the black people I&rsquo;ve ever known have been against the legalization of street drugs.  <br>
Most states, as far as I know, allow possession of a little pot.  Most blacks who are involved with it, however, are probably selling it.  All it takes is possession of a certain amount to be charged with intent to distribute, whether you actually intend it for personal use or not.  It seems to me that crack is a much bigger problem for blacks.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s say, for a minute that it is just casual smokers.<br>
I still have friends who imbibe a little bit of the herb.<br>
They do it at home, or on fishing / camping trips, or at their friends&rsquo; homes.<br>
I&rsquo;ve NEVER seen them standing on a street corner smoking pot.</p>
<p>How many times have you crossed paths with any (on duty) cops at a backyard bbq? </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet blacks get busted for public intox much more frequently than whites.<br>
Once again, it boils down to the location.<br>
The cops I know, really don&rsquo;t care if you&rsquo;re smoking a little weed <br>
inside of a private residence, nor do they care if you&rsquo;re drinking beer.<br>
Do it in public, and see what happens.<br>
The blacks suffer from a total disregard for the law much more<br>
than any stupid prohibition law.</p>
<p>What is it the real estate folks say?<br>
Location. Location. Location.</p>

		<p>In CA you are only arrested for pot if you have more than an ounce or are dealing it. If they legalize it they better keep these restrictions or the floodgates will open with street pharmacists. The NAACP only cares about taking care of their brothers.</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;Black people 18 to 25 years old use marijuana less frequently than whites, according to federal data in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Such &#8220;data&#8221; is highly suspect at best, since it all depends upon how many of the respondents answered the question truthfully.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Accompanied by other African American leaders in California, the president of the state NAACP, Alice Huffman, said the current prohibition on marijuana has led to the criminalizing of young people and consequently has hampered the ability of many African Americans to prosper.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Well, then, I think we need to remove the prohibitions on murder, rape and robbery as well.  After all, convictions for those crimes are surely &#8220;hampering the ability of many African Americans to prosper.&#8221;</p>
<p>There just seems to be no end to the imaginative excuses that blacks and the White left can haul out to &#8220;explain&#8221; black failure.<br>

		<p>Liberals raise the subject of &#8220;non violent drug offenses,&#8221; when complaining about the high rate of incarceration in the United States.  This is a distraction from the reality that the vast majority of people in maximum security prisons are there for violent and property crimes.<br>
 <br>
Also, what is a &#8220;non violent drug offense?&#8221;  Drug dealers are usually very violent men. <br>
 <br>
That said, nearly everything I have read about marijuana tells me that it is less dangerous than cigarettes and alcohol.  I support the NAACP on this issue.  </p>
