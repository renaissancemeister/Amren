			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Maureen Callahan, New York Post, June 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During a five-day seminar Wright taught last week in Chicago, he [the Rev. Jeremiah Wright] was back at it, claiming that whites and Jews are controlling the flow of worldwide information and oppressing blacks in Israel and America.</p>
<p>&#8220;White folk done took this country,&#8221; Wright said. &#8220;You&rsquo;re in their home, and they&rsquo;re gonna let you know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The course, advertised as focusing on politics and public policy in South Africa and America, was taught in a small, ground-floor room at the Chicago Theological Seminary, where Wright&rsquo;s voice echoed out an open window. The class was composed of about 15 to 20 students, mainly older African-American women {snip}.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yet during this course  &mdash;  which was described as asking, &#8220;What is the response and public witness of persons of faith to ongoing developments in both countries?&#8221;  &mdash;  Wright made many statements about what he believes are the true aims of whites and Jews.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not now, nor have you ever been, nor will you ever be a brother to white folk,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And if you do not realize that, you are in serious trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wright referred to Italians as &#8220;Mamma Luigi&#8221; and &#8220;pizzeria.&#8221; He said the educational system in America is designed by whites to miseducate blacks &#8220;not by benign neglect but by malignant intent.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The civil-rights movement, Wright said, was never about racial equality: &#8220;It was always about becoming white .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to master what [they] do.&#8221; Martin Luther King, he said, was misguided for advocating nonviolence among his people, &#8220;born in the oven of America.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We probably have more African-Americans who&rsquo;ve been brainwashed than we have South Africans who&rsquo;ve been brainwashed,&#8221; he said, and seemed to allude to President Obama twice: &#8220;Unfortunately, I got in trouble with a fella for saying this.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. All your commentaries are written by oppressors.&#8221; At the mention of Nation of Islam head Louis Farrakhan  &mdash;  whom Obama disavowed during the campaign  &mdash;  black leaders &#8220;go cuttin&rsquo; and duckin&rsquo;,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A few months ago, Wright and his family moved into a brand-new million-dollar home located near a golf course and made of stone with a recessed doorway surrounded by pillars. It&rsquo;s the only house on a cul-de-sac. Records show it was sold by Trinity United Church to a company called ATG Trust and paid for in cash.</p>

		<p>Remember, Barack Obama sat in the pews of this &#8220;church&#8221; for 19 years.  He deliberately chose this church because he wanted &#8220;street cred&#8221; in Chicago, back in the days when he thought the entirety of his political career would be based in the city.  (When his political career went national, and his TUCC membership was more of a liability than a benefit, Obama dumped TUCC for the same reasons he embraced it 19 years earlier, for political posturing.)  Yet, through all those years, he never heard a single word his Pastor said.</p>

<p>Take your pick, but either way, this remains an abjectly disturbing statement.</p>
<p>Indeed, I say this because while what the good Comrade Reverend explains above should be true, it is the direct opposite of the multicultural and dictatorial sociopolitical norm that now dominates this country. Or put another way, the Marxist elites in this country not only demand that blacks be forced into &ldquo;our home,&rdquo; but that they also expect decent taxpaying whites to be the willing welcome mats for them while they occupy it in the most obnoxious of manners. </p>

		<p>Can anybody out there imagine the hoots and jeers of derision, the howls of contemptuous laughter, the utter disbelief, were a white &#8220;leader&#8221; to hold forth in such an ignorant, ungrammatical, moronic manner?  Yet when slack-jawed buffoons such as Wright, Jesse Jackson, or Al Sharpton do so we&rsquo;re all expected to purse our lips, nod thoughtfully, and act as though these incredible displays of grossly inferior intelligence and education deserve a serious audience and every consideration.</p>
<p>One can at least have some small respect for clever charlatans; to be one requires as least some duplicitous cunning.  Bill Clinton, LBJ, FDR were all charlatans to one extent or another.  But these black &#8220;leaders&#8221; are of another stripe altogether.  They&rsquo;re too dumb to be duplicitous, and by and large, we&rsquo;re too craven to call them on it.</p>

		<p>I think the below quote pretty much sums up this racist hate mongering reverend&rsquo;s distorted world view.</p>
<p><br>
The inner defenses are unconscious. They consist of a kind of magic aura which the mind builds around cherished belief. Arguments which penetrate into the magic aura are not dealt with rationally but by a specific type of pseudo-reasoning. Absurdities and contradictions are made acceptable by specious rationalizations. ARTHUR KOESTLER (1904-1983) </p>

<p></p>
<p>All good lies have a grain of truth in them.  Wright, of course, fails to mention that it is those very liberals that make up him and his followers that engage in that &#8220;malignant intent&#8221;.  Blacks have low IQ&rsquo;s.  That is a biological fact.  But it is Wright and other blacks of money and priveledge that steal the money that could provide a reasonable education and blight the neighborhood into a hellhole of drugs and gangs.</p>
<p>Through separation and the vigorous enforcement of the rule of law, both American blacks and whites could share this country and live in peace.  Blacks could have a future that doesn&rsquo;t involve being fish that eats a smaller fish eating yet a smaller fish (ie both predator and prey).  They could have a fairly good standard of living, albeit one they have not earned.  But they won&rsquo;t&hellip;&hellip;because of people like the Rev Wright here.</p>

		<p>Doesn&rsquo;t this guy live in a multi-million dollar home in a predominantly white suburb?  </p>
<p>And didn&rsquo;t he marry a parishioner&rsquo;s wife?</p>
<p>Anyway, he complains whites are deliberately not educating blacks.  Well, he can&rsquo;t have it both ways.  Whites wanted to educate whites, and whites believed blacks should educate blacks.  That is the way it was, but then that was deemed evil.<br>

<p>No, no, no, no, no, no, and again no. Wake up liberals. You can spend your life for blacks, you can destroy your constitution for blacks, you can forget all your principles like free speech and democracy for blacks, you can sell your country out for blacks. They will never be able to manage themselves and they will always blame you, your children, your grandchildren and your grand grandchildren, the same way they blamed your parents, your grandparents and your grand grandparents for that.</p>

		<p>If these white fools in the media ever wake up and learn that most all blacks in the US regard them in the same way that Jeremiah Wright does, I&rsquo;m betting they still will continue with their self-hating, anti-white beliefs.  </p>
<p>But, even if they do finally see the light before the festivities begin, many of us preparing for our defense will NOT allow them sanctuary nor lift a finger for their protection.</p>
<p>They have caused us immeasurable harm, and they should be held accountable and publicly identified as the white criminals they are.</p>

		<p>Has this person ever had a real job? Bashing whites for a living sure has paid off, all the while without getting any dirt underneath his fingernails. His home is in a white suburb, paid for by his black congregation. They&rsquo;re good enough to pay for his house but not to live with, I suppose. And in cash? Seems financially irregular.                               So Obama sat there in the pulpit for twenty years and heard nothing out of the ordinary? This is all some horrible joke, isn&rsquo;t it?

		<p>It reminds me of the comments made about African-American community ministers in the 1960&rsquo;s. How the pennies in the plate becomes the Cadillac, the few dollars of the poor&rsquo;s salary become the fine suit, how the ministry became a means of escape from the same poverty and low status these men come from. Black authors saw the scam decades ago. </p>

		<p> And they talk about &#8220;hate speech&#8221;! Oh, but, I forgot: Only &#8220;White folk&#8221; are capable of uttering hate speech   &mdash;   right?</p>
<p> &#8220;Rev.&#8221; Wright appears to be eaten up with resentment and, yes, hatred, of European-descended people, whether they are Americans or Israelis. &#8220;White folk done took this country,&#8221; you say, Rev? Let me amend that statement just a bit: White folk BUILT this country   &mdash;   we didn&rsquo;t &#8220;take it&#8221; from anybody, because there wasn&rsquo;t any &#8220;America&#8221; before we came here. There was a virgin wilderness, populated by various scattered Indian tribes who were as at odds with each other as the many tribes of Africa. And they weren&rsquo;t &#8220;Native Americans&#8221; because historians have shown that they originally came across the land bridge from Asia to what later became America.</p>
<p> You say, Rev, that you are not &#8220;a brother to White folk&#8221;? Well, we&rsquo;re not brothers to you either, you spouter of wrong-headed Jeremiads!</p>
<p> And when you say America&rsquo;s educational system is &#8220;designed to miseducate blacks,&#8221; it shows that you REALLY don&rsquo;t understand what it&rsquo;s all about. Everyone knows the education system is designed to provide high-paying jobs with three months vacation a year for members of the NEA!</p>

<p>Reverend Wrong does not live too far from me. But his is a gated community to keep the whitey riff-raff out.</p>
<p>And it is either a $5 million house with 10,000 square feet or a $10 million dollar house with 5,000 square feet. And option for an indoor swimming pool!!</p>
<p>And I bet it is all church property too. The man does not even pay a cent in taxes either. So I would guess. This all in retirement?</p>

		<p>Both Wright and Farrakhan have very ostentatious homes. His comments against whites will not deter white liberals who already support him; if anything, his words will only feed into their collective masochistic psyche. His comments about Jews, however, would destroy his appeal to a general public, if he&rsquo;d had any to lose.</p>

		<p>So in addition to being anti-American, we now learn that Wright is blatantly anti-white, anti jew, anti-Italian, anti-school&hellip;even anti &#8220;civil rights&#8221;&hellip; could anything be more scandalous? And yet the MSM is, for the most part, strangely silent about all this. </p>
<p>During the presidential election, the MSM tried to cover up the Wright controversy, and when it became too obvious to keep quiet, tried to downplay it and portray Wright as &#8220;merely&#8221; anti-American! Heck, among liberals, that&rsquo;s a badge of honor! </p>
<p>Anti-Americanism only scratches the surface! Wright has a long history of scandalous statements, and yet, most outrageously of all,  we&rsquo;re expected to believe that Obama didn&rsquo;t know about any of this until the campaign! Give me a break!</p>

		<p>Notice that &#8220;Reverend&#8221; Wright and ALL notable black men of any merit, however small, are MULATTO.  These mulattos have White genes to thank for their marginal intelligence.</p>
<p>Take the humanitarian view:</p>
<p>Tigers don&rsquo;t belong in zoos or in the circus.  It&rsquo;s cruel that we put them in such a foreign habitat.  Blacks don&rsquo;t belong in White societies.  It&rsquo;s cruel that we put them in such a foreign habitat.</p>
<p>Repatriate all of these Bantus and mulattos back to Africa.  Perhaps the mulattos, with the benefit of White admixture, can help create a Black civilization beyond Stone Age savagery.</p>

		<p>We all know that if it were politically expedient for Obama to benefit from the relationship, he would still be maintaining photo ops with the Rev, and he would be saying, &#8220;Right on, Reverend!

		<p>The civil-rights movement, Wright said, was never about racial equality: &ldquo;It was always about becoming white &hellip; to master what [they] do.&rdquo; Martin Luther King, he said, was misguided for advocating nonviolence among his people, &ldquo;born in the oven of America.&rdquo;</p>

<p> I knew that the Reverend Wright was a crazy Anti-Semite and white hater, but I should have known that Italian-Americans would come in for special abuse. Maybe, Spike Lee is one of his parishioners?  Both Spike and the Rev. share the same phobia against Italian Americans. </p>

		<p>How does Wright REALLY feel about Obama, the son of a white mother, who was raised in Hawaii, a predominantly Asian and white enclave? Obama is &#8220;black&#8221; for political purposes only. Obama knew being &#8220;black&#8221; was a free ticket to the Ivy League for what may have been a mediocre student. Wright is spitting in the wind. The Obamas used him and dumped him. His audience is a dozen old black ladies. How many votes can they deliver?</p>

		<p>Rave on, fool.  You have shown white gullibles just exactly how the black community regards whites.</p>
<p>While anything you or anyone else might say about whites, no matter how racist, evil or insulting, you will never turn away the white fools who need to be culled from the white race.  However, you have awakened many brighter types who have the mentality to understand just what lies behind the black curtain you briefly opened for them, and many of us are praying you keep it up.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you will be able to merge with the Black Panthers, with Eric Holder as your consul, and openly threaten whites, as well as carrying your sticks in your hands and your guns in your boots with no hesitancy whatever to display them.</p>

		<p>Perhaps some readers here may remember a a book &#8220;The Way of the WASP&#8221;. Its thesis that the ideal for all Americans, regardless of national origin, is to emulate the cultural style and behaviors of what once was the elite class.  Those who have most successfully entered the elite class have done so. Wright has not, and resents that he could not. Even the Irish were once not white, and it took them a long while to acculturate.  Indeed, the Civil Rights movement was the struggle to enable black to become honorary Aryans.</p>

<p>Complete nonsense. For all the attacks levied against poor Irish immigrants in the 18th century, they were never thought of as non whites.</p>
<p>Also the Irish were in the American colonies right from the start and formed the backbone of what was to become America, so they fitted in quite well.</p>
