<h1>Immigration Law Supporters Rally at Ariz. Capitol</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michelle Price, Google News, June 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hundreds of people supporting Arizona&rsquo;s new law cracking down on illegal immigration rallied near the state Capitol on Saturday afternoon in soaring temperatures.</p>
<p>Hundreds of motorcycle riders kicked off the downtown Phoenix rally by riding in a procession around the Capitol. Supporters waved American flags and some carried signs that read &#8220;What part of illegal don&rsquo;t they understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>The rally&rsquo;s turnout fell far short of the march organized by opponents of the law last weekend, when an estimated 20,000 people gathered.</p>
<p>Demonstrators on Saturday sweated as temperatures reached 105 degrees. Some shaded themselves with umbrellas and clamored to buy cold water and ice cream from vendors.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, perhaps best known for his efforts targeting illegal immigrants, drew loud chants of &#8220;Joe, Joe, Joe!&#8221; when he spoke to the audience at the rally.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Arpaio praised lawmakers for passing the law and reiterated that he&rsquo;ll lock up as many illegal immigrants as his deputies can arrest.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania-based group Voice of the People USA organized the demonstration, which it touted as a grassroots effort. Attendees traveled from every region of the U.S., Voice of the People president Daniel Smeriglio said.</p>
<p>Former Republican Congressman Tom Tancredo of Colorado and GOP state Sen. Russell Pearce of Mesa, the author of the law, also spoke at the rally.</p>

<p>McClendon sported a T-shirt that read &#8220;Arizona: Doing the Job the Feds Won&rsquo;t Do!&#8221; It&rsquo;s one of four similarly-themed shirts she wears regularly. Her sartorial choices earn her frequent compliments from strangers  &mdash;  not a surprise, as polls consistently show large majorities backing the state&rsquo;s crackdown against illegal immigration.</p>
<p>But McClendon says she also gets dirty looks from Latino neighbors and believes her stance has led people to leave trash on her car. &#8220;So many legal citizens are scared to come out,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They&rsquo;re afraid to speak up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier that day, tens of thousands of protesters denouncing the law filled the streets of Phoenix. But the rally McClendon attended couldn&rsquo;t even fill the 9,873-seat stadium. It&rsquo;s a dynamic that&rsquo;s persisted ever since April, when Gov. Jan Brewer signed SB 1070 into law.</p>
<p>The onslaught of criticism through boycotts, protests and lawsuits has frustrated many of the law&rsquo;s backers, who contend its broad support in polls  &mdash;  ranging from 51% to 70% depending on how the statute is described and who is surveyed  &mdash;  shows it is the people&rsquo;s will</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Backers of the law hope a rally planned for Saturday in Phoenix will draw foes of illegal immigration from around the country. Another Phoenix rally is scheduled for June 12.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite fewer events and lower turnout from the law&rsquo;s backers, it appears that their message is being heard more loudly nationwide than that of SB 1070&rsquo;s foes, who support reform that allows illegal immigrants who obey the law to become legal residents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The law&rsquo;s supporters say people favor the bill because it&rsquo;s common sense. And common-sense measures don&rsquo;t tend to draw big crowds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should I protest [in support of] a law that says you can&rsquo;t go over the speed limit?&#8221; said former Colorado Rep. Tom Tancredo, who is scheduled to speak in Phoenix on Saturday. {snip} Business and religious groups tend to support a path to citizenship for illegal workers, while the movement opposing legalization has few large groups or donors to help it.</p>

		<p> It&rsquo;s amazing that the leftist-oriented Associated Press managed to write as even-handed a report as they did. True, they did mention that there were fewer people who came out to support the law than there were bused in to trash it. But they didn&rsquo;t belabor the fact, or deliberately seek out people who disagreed with the group favoring the law to give quotes denigrating it.</p>
<p> The fact remains that any cause that can be labeled as &#8220;unfair&#8221; or &#8220;racist&#8221;, whether that label is unfair or not, will draw out the Loony Left in their many thousands. Makes them feel all warm, fuzzy and morally superior to be able to dump on the people they disagree with, and tell each other they&rsquo;re defending the so-called &#8220;down-trodden.&#8221;</p>

<p>Laughably, I think this reflects the fact that most people who support this law, are decent and hardworking taxpayers who do not have the time to be activists and demonstrators. Instead of suckling at the system&rsquo;s magical mystery udder, we are the ones who actually are forced to finance the &ldquo;golden&rdquo; diversity heifer. Unlike the &ldquo;undocumented&rdquo; or &ldquo;marginalized&rdquo; enrichment automatons, who seem to milk that thing dry and then rigorously cry &ldquo;racism&rdquo; when they thirst for more.</p>
<p>It is an absurdly ominous sign for our future as a country, which our &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; seem to willfully ignore at every turn. We are on the precipice to an abyss of: poverty, endless &ldquo;domestic&rdquo; terrorism, and finally civil war.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>The low turnout is indicative of the type of people who support the anti-illegal law.  They are not activists.</p>
<p>They are average Americans who believe in quiet democracy, and they believe in letting elected government and its institutions do the job they are supposed to do.</p>
<p>They shouldn&rsquo;t have to take to the streets to twist the government&rsquo;s arm to make it perform its elected duty.<br>

<p>Huh?  What kid of double-talk is this?  Illegal  &#8220;immigrants&#8221; who obey the law?   What&rsquo;s that?  No such thing!!!   If they were obeying the law, they wouldn&rsquo;t be ILLEGAL. </p>
<p>Illegal means <i>NOT </i> OBEYING THE LAW! Need that be explained to the L.A. Times?</p>
<p>Damn!&hellip; What is there about this subject   &mdash;   legal vs. illegal   &mdash;    that is so hard for journalists to understand? They just don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>And while I&rsquo;m at it, for the zillionth time, illegal aliens are NOT &#8220;IMMIGRANTS&#8221;  either!    They are invaders, gate crashers, intruders, trespassers. An &#8220;immigrant&#8221; comes in legally, in compliance with the law, and doesn&rsquo;t sneak over/under a fence during the night.  Illegal entrants are no more &#8220;immigrants&#8221; than a burglar is an uninvited &#8220;guest&#8221;.   Why can&rsquo;t we call things what they are?  And down further comes the term &#8220;ilegal workers&#8221;.  That&rsquo;s deceptive too. (What if they&rsquo;re not workers? Would deportation apply only to those who are not <i>working</i>?)</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t journalists get their terminology straight?  Ordinary people may get confused by such terms; but professional writers who earn their living by using words ought to be able to discern the simple difference between &#8220;legal&#8221; and &#8220;illegal&#8221;. </p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t they learn ANYTHING in Journalism School   &mdash;   except not to offend The Sacred Minorities?</p>

<p>&#8220;Hundreds&#8221; the radical leftist Google says, when it has been reported by most news orgs that &#8220;thousands&#8221; were supporting the law.</p>
<p>The Mexican writing the second story above said the supporters &#8220;couldn&rsquo;t even fill&#8221; a 9800 plus capacity building.  That sounds like there were more than hundreds again, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Whatever the case, that anybody showed up in support of since to do so is kind of redundant since 70% of Arizonans support the law.</p>
<p>I wonder if he&rsquo;s too dimwitted to understand that these Mex displays of protests actually make thing worse for illegal Mexicans&hellip;and probably legal ones as well.</p>

		<p><i>Despite fewer events and lower turnout from the law&rsquo;s backers, it appears that their message is being heard more loudly nationwide than that of SB 1070&rsquo;s foes, who support reform that allows illegal immigrants who obey the law to become legal residents.</i></p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s an oxymoron   &mdash;   an illegal immigrant who obeys the law.  By that reasoning a burglar also obeys the law   &mdash;   except for that pesky one about burglary.  Also, it has been my experience that people who break our immigration laws with impunity invariably break other laws, such as the ones against littering, making obnoxious noises, zoning restrictions in housing, and so forth.</p>
<p><i>But McClendon says she also gets dirty looks from Latino neighbors and believes her stance has led people to leave trash on her car. &ldquo;So many legal citizens are scared to come out,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re afraid to speak up.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Here is the core of the problem.  White people who oppose illegal immigration are subjected to vandalism or worse if they make their views public.  Illegal aliens who demand their &#8220;right&#8221; to become citizens never have to fear that any such actions will be carried out against them.  After all, vandalizing their cars would be a &#8220;hate crime&#8221;, while Eric Holder has helpfully let us know that straight whites will not be considered to be victims of hate crimes.<br>

		<p>you just knew our country was going to come apart when they elected a black president. when blacks are in charge, everything goes to hell. and such a great country it was for so many great years. then ted kennedy got the 1965 immigration bill passed, and the 45 years of amalgamation began. so now we are only about 55 to 60% white. thank you democrats, you&rsquo;ve done a great job of ruining our country.</p>

		<p>Just because only a couple 100 anti-illegal immigration people came doesn&rsquo;t mean there aren&rsquo;t more who don&rsquo;t care.  Not all of us could make it Arizona.  We&rsquo;re too busy/too broke to go all the way to AZ to organize.  There are other ways to show your support, even quietly.  </p>

		<p>Why are there were fewer rally attendees for the new law than that for pro-illegal alien rallies?  Perhaps for the Arizona law supporters most of those citizens have to keep previous made schedules which, through taxation, support the larger group of illegals who apparently had the time to amass.  <br>
Also it appears the Arizona law supporters are more likely to use the written word and internet to express themselves.  Numerous national polls by recognized pollsters show supporters of the new Arizona law at or above 75%.  It can&rsquo;t be all Republicans if the number is that high.<br>

<p>Roger Hedgecock, former mayor of San Diego reports on his show that Arizonans  &mdash;  known as &#8216;zonies&rsquo; in SD because so many of them visit during the brutal summer heat in AZ  &mdash;   have fomented their own boycott against San Diego (whose city council voted to boycott AZ).

		<p>One reason pro SB-1070 type law suporters have usually small presence at the support rallies is that &#8220;most all of us have jobs to support the ones that DON&rsquo;T have jobs and have time to rally for US to continue their support&#8221; I am optimistic that this train of events is gonna derail pretty soon. I see that blacks in Memphis are upset about not getting their extended unemployment checks..they will just have to make do with their welfare checks and food stamps.</p>
