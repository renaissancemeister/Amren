			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rebecca English, Daily Mail (London), June 10, 2100</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Prince Charles yesterday urged the world to follow Islamic &#8216;spiritual principles&rsquo; in order to protect the environment.</p>
<p>In an hour-long speech, the heir to the throne argued that man&rsquo;s destruction of the world was contrary to the scriptures of all religions  &mdash;  but particularly those of Islam.</p>
<p>He said the current &#8216;division&rsquo; between man and nature had been caused not just by industrialisation, but also by our attitude to the environment  &mdash;  which goes against the grain of &#8216;sacred traditions&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Charles, who is a practising Christian and will become the head of the Church of England when he succeeds to the throne, spoke in depth about his own study of the Koran which, he said, tells its followers that there is &#8216;no separation between man and nature&rsquo; and says we must always live within our environment&rsquo;s limits.</p>
<p>The prince was speaking to an audience of scholars at the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies  &mdash;  which attempts to encourage a better understanding of the culture and civilisation of the religion.</p>
<p>His speech, merging religion with his other favourite subject, the environment, marked the 25th anniversary of the organisation, of which he is patron.</p>
<p>He added: &#8216;The inconvenient truth is that we share this planet with the rest of creation for a very good reason  &mdash;  and that is, we cannot exist on our own without the intricately balanced web of life around us.</p>
<p>&#8216;Islam has always taught this and to ignore that lesson is to default on our contract with creation.&rsquo;<br/>

<p>His Highness&rsquo;s latest ravings, I believe, are signs of a genetic<br/>

<p>He is not likely to be king and therefore head of the Church of England but he does have offspring and you know how genetics works!!</p>

		<p>You know, I think it a bit odd that the prince is praising Muslims when he talks about limits and saving the environment.  As everyone should know by know, the Muslims have very high birthrates, and unless offset by techological breakthroughs that greatly increase the productivity of the land, would put a strain of the environment.  But then, what could you expect from him?  Prince Charles&rsquo; initials are PC  &mdash;    the same as Political Correctness!!</p>

<p>Actually Paganism taught this long before Islam came into being so maybe we should all follow the Pagan way instead.  At least Pagans don&rsquo;t want to forcibly convert everyone to their beliefs and murder everyone who won&rsquo;t convert.</p>

		<p>The Whites who are elected &#8220;leaders&#8221;, politicians, royalty, and corporate elitists run the world. They are well aware that their own race   &mdash;   OUR race!   &mdash;   is being rapidly out-bred. Consequently, they are very busy making friends with the new owners of the world.</p>
<p>In their eyes, common Whites are in their way and we are a burden to them. They are anxious to institute Sharia Law and hand the keys to the new tenants.</p>
<p>Very dire times are ahead, my friends. This is not a &#8220;bump in the road.&#8221; We are the frogs in the pot of water that is now set to boil. We have been betrayed by our own kind! </p>
<p>Blacks did not do this to us. Browns did not do this to us. Muslims did not do this to us. White elitists did this to us. They sold us out! They&rsquo;ve been selling us out for our entire lives!</p>
<p>This is the way they do it:</p>
<p>1. Create an excellent, civilized White society with rules, laws, and a common religion that binds.</p>
<p>2. Compel its citizens to participate in a socialized pyramid scheme (e.g., social security). Make the scheme seem rock solid and foolproof! Make it seem like it is guaranteed! Promise the citizens that if they work hard for 40+ years, they can retire to a life of ease and a great life!</p>
<p>3. Keep the carrot dangling in front of the following sheeple during their entire working lives as they toil in obscurity below.</p>
<p>4. When it becomes apparent that the pyramid scheme is on the verge of collapsing, open the floodgates to illegal immigrants and keep the ruse going a little longer.</p>
<p>5. When the aging Whites are out-bred by the immigrants and others, enforce sweeping austerity measures to eliminate the benefits of the aging Whites as they enter retirement.</p>
<p>6. Collapse the stock markets and devalue the currency.</p>
<p>7. Laugh all the way to the bank after enjoying a lifetime of &#8220;free labor&#8221; provided by the now-aging Whites. With the Muslims in control and Sharia Law implemented, the aging Whites are owed nothing! Their retirement packages are worthless. The companies that promised them retirement pensions and benefits now have new owners with new rules and policies.</p>
<p>8. Imprison and execute any White who complains under Sharia Law. </p>
<p>In the above scenario, who will the Whites be able to blame? No one! The crime was spread over many decades. By then, the Muslims will hold the keys to the U.S. and Europe. Does anyone think that a young Muslim will want to pay taxes to support an aging, White Christian?</p>
<p>All that the retired Whites will be able to do at that point is wither and die in poverty as the Muslims take completely over. The most elite Whites, of course, will be protected by their Muslim friends.</p>
<p>May God help us all!</p>

		<p>Prince Charles is part of that entire PC, post war, hippy dippy generation.  His mother and son&rsquo;s stay out of anything political.  I bet the Queen prays she out lives Charles so that the throne goes to Wills.  I could actually see Harry leading troops against a Sharia dominated England to save his brother&rsquo;s throne.  I could actually see the Harry making the Royal Family relevant when the final push comes.  The boys may not be as PC as their father and may actually see what is coming, and not just for them but for their subjects as well.  The big question is are their enough real Englishmen of any stripe to save England?</p>

		<p>People should closely pay attention whenever political leaders get involved with religions. This is text-book fascism folks. Society is divided into groups. Notice how individual Muslims are being directed into a collective goal. People are managed by subconscious non-rational methods that are loaded with symbolism. Religion has the added power of being sacred so the politician comes across as being an intermediary with God. Notice the complete lack of science for analyzing the holy claims of the religion. Try to imagine how the political-religious  relationship could be made democratic and subject to debate in parliament or congress. It couldn&rsquo;t be done. What more proof do people need that we are living under fascism? How do groups get action for what they want? They get more power, that&rsquo;s how. Whites - pay attention. </p>

		<p>I take anything I read in the Daily Mail with a grain of salt. But it&rsquo;s entirely unsurprising that Charles tried to establish a connection between environmentalism and Islam, given that he was speaking at the Islamic Center.  So he was reaching for what would resonate with them. Even so, as Whiteplight said, one does not need recourse to religious scripture to recognize the importance of nature in our lives, and the simple fact that we are all part of nature.</p>

<p>The problem with waffle like this is that all him premises are incorrect.<br/>
Mankind does has not destroyed the world, and is not currently doing so; mankind likes the world.  There is no <br/>
&#8216;division&rsquo; between man and nature, man is nature. </p>
<p>In any case, whenever there is any divisiveness or destruction it&rsquo;s always mankind who steps in to cure the mess that nature causes, volcanos, floods,earthquakes,tidal waves,forest fires plagues,cholera, typhoid, smallpox,polio, the list of nature&rsquo;s evil schemes to self destruct is endless; all these attempts by nature to destroy the planet &amp; human and animal life have been going on since records began. Mankind has the occasional disaster (deliberate: Sadaam lighting the oilfields in Kuwait) or accidental: Oil spills, Chernobyl) but we work our fingers to the bone clearing up our messes, nature just ignores it and waits for the Earth heal itself.<br/>
 Its all a crock. Charles is a nincompoop.</p>

		<p>Prince Charles has joined the ranks of politically correct idiots.  Look at the birth rates in Islamic countries from Egypt to Indonesia and one thing is plain   &mdash;   population stabilization and Islam don&rsquo;t go together.  There is no hope for protecting the environment in countries that keep doubling their population every 20 - 30 years.<br/>

		<p>The Islamic agenda and continuous invasion is no joke.  I urge all whites, particularily white christians to read &#8220;The Islamic Antichrist&#8221;, by Joel Richardson.  A letter from an American Muslim in the appendix, titled &#8220;Give it up, UR losing to us&#8221;, is a shocking realization of the true Islamic agenda for America.  Immigration from the Southwest is tea and crumpets compared to the Islamic invasion of Western Civilization.</p>

By that time, there will be few Whites left so fitting into the spaceship will not be problematic. Just a thought, but with a black running NASA now, is it coincidental that the shuttle missions are ending! How many White technicians/scientists/engineers will the black management run off.</p>

		<p>I think that it is easy for very wealthy people to talk blithely and irresponsibly about topics such as saving the environment. This man-who-would-be-king will suffer none of the consequences of the drivel that he spouts on various topics. Because he&rsquo;ll never know what it is like for the average Christian or Hindu or Buddhist to reside near a colony of islamists, he can rave on about the wonders of islam too. He will pay zero consequences despite what happens in the future. </p>
<p>Man was made to be an active seeker of his own welfare and well being. In place of physical abilities (ours are quite limited compared to even a low life-form on the charts) he&rsquo;s been given a brain. This brain has enabled him to survive and thrive. Religion can remind man of his place in the universe, but it should not pronounce that all men live by codes that the religion makes up and changes to suit that religion&rsquo;s purposes. It should never get in the way of what man does to sustain and maintain life. Had we listened to the early Church pronouncements and done nothing else, We&rsquo;d be living in dung-heated hovels in Europe watching our children starve to death as we gleaned the fields of the king and his family.</p>
<p>But we didn&rsquo;t. Fortunately men used their minds and we&rsquo;ve come a long way since. It&rsquo;s not Nirvana, and it never will be (doctrine of Original Sin&hellip;). Nonetheless, developed nations do far less environmental damage than do undeveloped ones. Many fundamentalist-dominated muslim nations are environmental nightmares with burgeoning poor populations that wouldn&rsquo;t dream of violating the wishes of the imam. </p>
<p>Prince Charles is comparable to an ayatollah. But, fortunately, his power is all symbolic. We need to take his words with a great grain of salt and not listen to the guilt-driven nonsense that he and other very wealthy, out-of-touch people are prone to spout now and then.</p>

		<p>     Prince Charles, whether he realizes it or not, is doing the very same thing that many Christian leaders, in the areas conquered by the Arabs (Muslims) in the 700-800&rsquo;s, did.  He converted.  In those areas in the 700-800&rsquo;s, even though Christians and Zoroastrians would remain the large majority for a long time, the leaders of the Christians and Zoroastrians knew who was in charge and capitulated.  I believe that Charles believes that the future of Britain is Islam, and he wants to maintain the crown for his family.  Just like the Christian leaders of the Middle East did centuries before when the Muslims took over, he is changing religion.  Charles is not an idiot, just a contemptible traitor.  It&rsquo;s all very obvious.  I would say that within fifty years, most Whites in Britain will either leave the country or convert to Islam.  It&rsquo;s already happening in their prisons, where Britons are converting to Islam to get privileges or just to make their lives safer and easier.  </p>

		<p>Well the fact is Islam addresses a number of things that the Old and New Testament totally ignore. The environment is one of them, animal cruelty is another. Just try to find passages that address either of those things&hellip;there aren&rsquo;t any. But the Quran and the Hadiths are full of instructions on both matters.</p>

		<p>What exactly has gotten into the Monarchy?  I realize the titles are mostly (though far from entirely) symbolic, but as the symbols of all that is England, the royals have a responsibility to speak sense to the public.  Hadn&rsquo;t the 7/7/05 attacks in London shown that maybe &#8220;Islamic principles&#8221; have a major downside? </p>
<p>Somebody tell me:  Why are the royals, from Her Majesty the Queen on down, so daft these days?</p>

		<p>Charlie as King will be the last straw, and the reason why millions in the Anglican Communion will jump ship, and become Roman Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, or any other Christian Denomination.  </p>
<p>The Worldwide Anglican Communion is in tough shape right now,and I don&rsquo;t suppose that it would weather Charles too well as the &#8220;Defender of the Faith&#8221;. </p>

		<blockquote>Quoting Skip #19: Perhaps, as in the movie/book &ldquo;When Worlds Collide&rdquo; we Whites could build huge space ships and leave the damn planet to get away from them! By that time, there will be few Whites left so fitting into the spaceship will not be problematic. Just a thought, but with a black running NASA now, is it coincidental that the shuttle missions are ending! How many White technicians/scientists/engineers will the black management run off.</blockquote>
<p>One might also add that there is no physical law which says that the web of life must <i>necessarily</i> be confined to the earth.</p>
<p>Earth is only the birthplace, the crib, the cradle if you will. Eventually, we must leave the crib and venture out into the surrounding vastness. There is far far more material off-planet than there is here on earth, and the conditions off-planet are unremittingly hostile to the life and practice of multiculturalism.</p>
<p>It is naive to believe, as many multiculturalists and others do, that all men are equally fitted to all circumstances (some are <i>much</i> more suited to the maintenance of something like a space colony than others) and that we can continue happily to circle the sun forever and ever without consequence.</p>

<p>Sonya! the Quran is also full of way and means of dealing with non muslims, these means ways I have seen first hand, up close and personal and I have the photos to prove it.</p>

		<p>Prince Charles talk of &#8220;saving&#8221; the world is akin to Al Gore&rsquo;s constant pitch that we must each reduce our carbon consumption&hellip; while he hedonistically lives in a $9 million mansion in southern California - which of course must use plenty of electricity for summer air-conditioning.</p>
<p>It was said by other posters above that the coronation of Charlie would result in Australia and New Zealand becoming republics, but the odds are fairly good that Britain would as well.  There was once another King Charles who was beheaded by Parliamentary order, after all.</p>

<p>The fact is there are passages in the Bible on how to treat animals and the land. Basically, take care of them, be good to them, because God created them. Why must the Koran go on and on, in minute detail about this, when it is so simple a matter?</p>
