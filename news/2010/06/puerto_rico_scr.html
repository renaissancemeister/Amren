<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->

<p>What he doesn&rsquo;t have is a birth certificate that&rsquo;s good beyond this month. Born 46 years ago in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico  &mdash;  a U.S. territory  &mdash;  Roldan is one of about 5.5 million island natives whose identity document will be invalidated July 1.</p>
<p>In an effort to end what it describes as a brisk black market in Puerto Rican birth certificates, which confer U.S. citizenship, the Puerto Rican government decided in December to invalidate all existing birth certificates. Those born on the island, including about 1.35 million who live on the mainland, must apply for a new birth certificate.</p>
<p>The black market is not fueled by counterfeiting but by multiple official copies of individual certificates. In Puerto Rico, it is customary to hand over an official birth certificate to register for school or sports leagues.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have filed away in unsecure locations tens of millions of live valid birth certificates,&#8221; says Kenneth McClintock, Puerto Rico&rsquo;s secretary of State, who says he used to buy five birth certificates at a time for his children from the Vital Statistics Record Office. Although drastic, he says, the measure to invalidate millions of documents was necessary. &#8220;We can take care of the public school records, although it would be difficult. But what about your volleyball coach who died last week and left in her garage a cardboard box with 237 records of her past team members?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Stolen documents</b></p>
<p>The new law forbids institutions such as schools from keeping official copies of a birth certificate.</p>
<p>In 2008, federal agents confiscated 14,000 stolen birth certificates in an investigation that resulted in five convictions, says Ivan Ortiz, a spokesman for the federal Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agency in Puerto Rico. In a previous case, birth certificates were bought from drug addicts for $25 and then sent to the U.S. mainland to be sold for $5,000 each. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t know if the new law is going to shut this down, but it will definitely make it more difficult to obtain an original of this document,&#8221; Ortiz says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the wake of Arizona&rsquo;s anti-illegal-immigration law, some Puerto Ricans aren&rsquo;t happy to have any change in their identity papers. &#8220;Every Spanish-speaking person, everybody who looks Latin is suddenly suspect,&#8221; says Cesar Perales of the advocacy group LatinoJustice PRLDEF (Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund.) &#8220;So to decide that this is the time to change Puerto Rican birth certificates is not a good idea at the very least.&#8221;</p>

<p>Puerto Ricans are not a statistally relevant size population in Arizona, as anyone who has ever been there can attest. The problem there is mestizos from Mexico and Central America. Since Arizona&rsquo;s new law is confined to Arizona (for now) and there are basically no Puerto Ricans in Arizona, what are they griping about? </p>

		<p>I consider Puerto Rico to be a mistake of empire and it would be best to give Puerto Rico independence.  Even in peaceable Canada there has long been friction between French speaking Quebec and the rest of the country.  Puerto Rico is the main reason it is impossible to get English made the official language of our country.  It is also a welfare basket case.  Now we see how its loose birth certificate policy has been a bonanza for illegal immigrants.  I prefer to see an amicable separation rather than wait for a civil war.  </p>

		<p>Most people I know who are Peurto Rican are annoyed over the invalidation of their LFBCs but understand the reason for it.  Puerto Rico has sued the Federal Government over lack of immigration enforcement.  Peurto Ricans suffer the easiest over stolen identity because most illegals are Hispanic and it is easier for a Hispanic from the Dominican Republic or Central America to convincingly use a PR birth Certificate and PR issued SSN than say to try to pass themselves off as a Tyrone Johnson or Skip Wigglesworth.  A PR LFBC and SSN gives an illegal instant &#8220;legitmacy&#8221; in the US.  Where I work native Spanish Speakers from Cuba and Puerto Rico have caught illegals because they do not have the appropriate accent.  Having worked around these people I can now spot with fair accuracy who is Puerto Rican and who isn&rsquo;t.  Most people, however, see a PR birth certificate and will accept you as a non-English speaking US citizen.  </p>
<p>No one should ever let any agency keep an original copy of a birth certificate.  A certified BC should be presented and if acceptable photocopied for school or employer records.  No one but the individual or his parents should have the original, certified, raised seal LFBC.</p>

		<p>This is sad.  Yes, there are innumerable Puerto Ricans who come to America and leech off our system, and the island is an American-bolstered welfare state, but birth certificates are an essential part of modern-day life.  Currently, there is a push for adoptees to have access to their original birth records, as well as for children born to single mothers in the Mideast to have access to a certificate and a right to register for subsequent services. </p>
<p>I am sympathetic towards any Puerto Ricans, on their own island, whose lives are complicated by the red tape resulting from illegal immigration to our country. </p>

		<p>Someone answer this for me. I have had this thought.</p>
<p>Suppose Roldan or Jose does go to get a copy of his birth certificate. A new one! And the records show in various regards that there are a half dozen or a dozen or maybe more persons already using that original and now outdated and invalid birth certificate. How does Roldan or Jose absolutely establish with certainty for the authorities that he really IS Roldan or Jose?</p>
<p>I guess if you had three or more persons vouch under oath for Roldan or Jose that Roldan or Jose really was Roldan or Jose?</p>
<p>But with so much stuff already out there that is now invalid, who is to say for certain what will occur!</p>

		<p>The USA should just give Puerto Rico its independence. It was a foolish mistake to acquire this resource-poor, Spanish-speaking island. I am at a complete and utter loss to see how holding the place has ever been of any benefit to America.</p>

		<p>The issue of PR birth certificates was a big issue about a decade ago.  A little league pitcher named Danny Almonte was just cleaning up   &mdash;   He through multiple no-hitters and perfect games (IIRC) not only during the regular season, but in the L/L playoffs.  Someone got suspicious, and went snooping around in Almonte&rsquo;s native PR, and got enough documentation to prove that he was born two years earlier than the fake paperwork his parents showed to L/L authorities.  Meaning he was 14 instead of 12.</p>
<p>My take at the time was this:  I&rsquo;ll be circumspect, because of the nature of AR.  But I didn&rsquo;t buy the excuse that his coaches and fellow teammates were fooled and bamboozled.  In most instances, it should be easy to differentiate a 14-year old boy and a 12-year old boy.  There are many situations in the course of a L/L baseball season where it should be perfectly obvious that 14 is 14 and 12 is 12.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>But it has been a rich benefit to certain powerful special interests, such as the sugar companies, banks, and others, who are profiting from the relationship.  The relationship would not exist if somebody wasn&rsquo;t profiting from it..</p>
<p>I recall, a year or two ago when Martinique was in the news, a similar question was asked:  Since Martinique consumed more benefits than it produced and is a general headache to France,  why didn&rsquo;t France just give Martinique its independence and be rid of it?   A French poster, although agreeing,  pointed out that independence was not going to happen anytime soon because, while it Martinique a drag on the average French taxpayer, it is useful to certain influential interests for a tax haven, vacation homes, investments, etc.  <br/>
The devil is always in the details.</p>
<p>But I agree that Puerto should be allowed to go its own way, with an amicable divorce. And that BOTH parties involved should be given a say in this: not just Puerto Rico.</p>
