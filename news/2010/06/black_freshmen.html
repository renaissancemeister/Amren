			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Larry Gordon, Los Angeles Times, June 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Despite much-publicized racial tensions on the campus last semester, UC San Diego has managed to slightly raise its still small numbers of African American freshman for the fall, according to statistics released by the campus Tuesday.</p>
<p>Some students and faculty had feared that black enrollment on the campus could be negatively affected by the &#8220;Compton Cookout,&#8221; an off-campus party in February that mocked African Americans and led to protests about UC San Diego&rsquo;s small numbers of black students. That led to extra efforts to recruit African American students without violating the state&rsquo;s ban on racial affirmative action in college admissions.</p>
<p>Although still less than 2% of the incoming freshman class of 4,206, 68 black students have said they plan to enroll at UC San Diego as freshmen in the fall, up from 50 last year. Among the 2,943 transfer students, 87 are black, up from 46 last year.</p>
<p>Students who described themselves as Asian Americans will make up 48% of the campus&rsquo; freshman class; whites 20%, Latinos, 16%; Filipino, 4%. {snip}</p>

<p>She managed to condense Orwell&rsquo;s book into one sentence&hellip;</p>
<p>Will it reach the point, everytime one of these prep students does something embarrassing, blacks will secretly rejoice? Don&rsquo;t tell me, affirmative-action in California is so lax, Blacks are oppressed for real now?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Black enrollment currently stands at 68 out of 4,206, up from 50 last year.&#8221;</p>
<p>And out of 68 MAYBE one is not an affirmative action appointee.</p>
<p>If blacks had to qualify for admission, grades, and certification like whites, it would be rare for any black to have a degree in almost anything.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, white people will focus on the tiny number of black students at UC San Diego instead of the number of white students.  People who are number one don&rsquo;t look at last place, they look at their closest competitors.  Black people are at the bottom.  East Asians are our closest competitors.  When non-white people come to any country or area which is or has been white-populated their goal is to surpass white people.  Envy is a motivator.  Although East Asians do well in school white people want to do better than other white people.  White parents and the white community at large must instill acedemic excellence and industry in their youth.</p>

		<p>Ice has it right, &#8220;if blacks had to qualify diploma&rsquo;s would be rare&#8221;.</p>
<p>Qualify being the operative word, AA is mental aids.</p>

		<p>Well, there is good news and bad news here. I am actually quite relieved that the percentage of Compton darks enrolled at UC San Diego is so small. That is the true market place of life in the works. On the other hand, we see that whites are only twenty percent of the pie graph in a state that is nearly half white. That is alarming. East Asians, although they generally make for good neighbors  &mdash;  (I even married one)  &mdash;  seem to be aggressively angling to take over the highest echelon of American society, as their numbers are wildly over represented at all of the UC campi. What is going on here? Maybe when the southern California counties become the first provice of Aztlan a few years from now, the Chinese that dominate these flagship state universities will realize that whitey was not so bad after all.</p>

		<p>I would like to see them follow these 68 students through their years at UCSD. How many of them actually graduate?</p>
