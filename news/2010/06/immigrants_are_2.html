<h1>Immigrants Are Taking Lead Roles in New Finnish Children&rsquo;s Books</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Päivi Heikkilä-Halttunenm, Helsingin Sanomat, June 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The new books by authors Niina Hakalahti and Kari Levola can be regarded as a turning point in the Finnish children&rsquo;s literature that deals with tolerance. They bring up the multicultural main characters already in the title of the book.</p>
<p>Niina Hakalahti&rsquo;s book is titled Tuukka-Omar, while the title of Levola&rsquo;s book is Leevi ja Leonora.</p>
<p>Tuukka-Omar&rsquo;s father comes from Syria. He got married to a Finn and settled in his wife&rsquo;s home country. He works as a taxi-driver.</p>
<p>The Finnish boy Leevi has a friend Leonora who has moved from Albania with her grandparents. The girl is waiting to hear from her parents about whether it would be possible for the family to return to Albania.</p>
<p>Hakalahti flavours her description of multiculturalism with a fantasy element: Smoking a water pipe, Tuukka-Omar&rsquo;s father alleviates his homesickness by flying on an oriental carpet above the roofs of the city.</p>
<p>The father also uses more florid language than Finns and listens to his son&rsquo;s troubles with more sensitive ears than does his mother, who is dedicated to her work.</p>
<p>The 21st century children&rsquo;s literature also underlines problems and makes a stab at realism.</p>
<p>In addition to multiculturalism matters, both books have also brought up some other problem bothering the main character.</p>
<p>The 8-year-old Tuukka-Omar is suffering from wetting his bed at night, while Leevi and Leonora are victims of school bullying.</p>
<p>However, the problems are not explained to be directly attributable to ethnic backgrounds.</p>
<p>Tuukka-Omar has inherited the same bed-wetting problem his father had as a child, but Leonora is being picked on because she is overly lively rather than because of her Balkan background.</p>
<p>Leevi, who has moved from the countryside is called a woolly back  &mdash;  this, too, is some sort of reversed political correctness!</p>
<p>Two different editions of Kari Levola&rsquo;s book Leevi ja Leonora have been published at the same time.</p>
<p>One of them is in regular Finnish by the publishing company Tammi, who were also behind Tuukka-Omar, while the other is in simple Finnish and released by Pieni Karhu, a publishing company specialising in books written for children and teens.</p>
<p>One could only hope that such cultural deeds would be more frequently performed, particularly by the big mainstream publishers.</p>
<p>In addition to books written in their native languages, immigrant children really need good Finnish reading material that is easy to absorb and that tempts them to identify with the characters of the book.</p>
<p>Natalia Laurila and Hanna Koljonen&rsquo;s book Mamumuksut  &mdash;  suomea leikki-ikäisille (&#8220;Immigrant Kids  &mdash;  Finnish for Preschoolers&#8221;), published by Finnlectura, can be classified as nonfiction.</p>
<p>The book attempts to cover an obvious fringe area, and the intention as such is worth supporting.</p>
<p>However, a good idea has been left halfway. Instead of standard language, the book uses the colloquial speech of the Greater Helsinki area, which is constantly absorbing new nuances.</p>
<p>In other words, the life of the book could be short.</p>
<p>The real blunder is, however, in the name of the book: Mamumuksut  &mdash;  suomea leikki-ikäisille.</p>
<p>The abbreviation mamu [from maahanmuuttaja, &#8220;immigrant&#8221;] is often used as a pejorative term among Finnish children and young adults.</p>
<p>In the book, the Finnish girl Aino, the Indian Shashi, the Russian Jevgeni and the Somali Asad are getting to know the Finnish everyday life, naturally including going to sauna and camping in the woods.</p>
<p>Hanna Koljonen&rsquo;s rich illustrations tempt the reader to name details, thereby taking on board the Finnish language and terms.</p>
<p>Mamumuksut  &mdash;  suomea leikki-ikäisille nevertheless contains too much written material, if it is supposed to encourage immigrant families to read the book together.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Inherited the same bed wetting problems&#8221;  I`ll never forget one of those journalistic Oouch! Wham! Bingo! moments I had a few years back. Buried on Page 16A was a copyline that went &#8220;86 Year Old Recluse Donates Entire Fortune To Curing Childhood Affliction&#8221;. It then went on to inform the reader that the Whole 65 million dollars was going to finding a cure for&hellip; Bedwetting!! I exhaled audibly, then took a sip of bourbon and wondered exactly what kind of taunts flew around the merry-go-round back in 1932 soo long ago&hellip;</p>

		<p>The racial marxists are going after the kids, hoping to cut off the influence of their parents who may have more settled ideas about race and culture. </p>
<p>The problem is that the underlying premise of all these books is a simple formula: white culture = bad and in need of change, non-white cultures = all good in an Avatarish sort of way.</p>
<p>The end result is that white cultures are being asked to change and become more like the non-white cultures.  But the reason those people came to white lands to begin with was to live among more prosperous, well-ordered societies.</p>
<p>If you make Europe, for example, a mulatto continent with Arab and African rythmns, where would the German work ethic be?  Where would British sensibility be?  Where would Scandanavian practicality be?  Where would white-guilt/enlightenment tolerance be?  Third worlders are decidedly intolerant, if anyone hasn&rsquo;t noticed.</p>
<p>All those cultural traits that took centuries to build and foster would be gone, and you would have nothing but third world cronyism and corruption, which predated colonialism, by the way, as numerous primary sources document.</p>
<p>So racial marxists want to create a social justice/rainbow wonderland of the brotherhood of man, yet the only societies that are being asked to drop their values and cultures are the very ones that allowed this warm fuzzy feeling ideology to form in the first place!  There is no love for minorities and there is no functioning multiculturalism/social justice in any other culture on earth.</p>

		<p>The fact that this  &#8220;softening up&#8221; of young minds is going on in all white countries is no accident!  But ONLY white countries.</p>
<p>Internationalism is a fundamental tenet of Marxism.  The Soviet Union may have died, but Marxism lives on, and (like Islam) continues spreading.  (Islam, btw, is also international, multiracial.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Diversity&#8221; and &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; are just updated terms for traditional Marxist internationalism.  Much as old-style Communists are now called &#8220;Progressives&#8221;.  And blacks are now &#8220;African-Americans&#8221;.  It sounds better and it gives them a new start when the old terms have taken on bad connotations.</p>
<p>And why is it ONLY in white countries?  Because the white race has been judged and condemned, by those Marxists, as &#8220;the cancer of history&#8221;. The white working class disappointed the Marxists by failing to produce the expected revolutionaries, so it has been abandoned in favor of racial politics and gender politics, and immigration,  as ways of undermining and destroying western civilization.  </p>
<p>The Marxist elite never really liked the white working class anyway, but hoped to use them. They were bitterly disapponted by the proletariat&rsquo;s lack of revolutionary zeal, and its lack of enthusiasm for miscegenation. So it has to be replaced.</p>

<p>Well, isn&rsquo;t this the real point of the book that some secret pedophile wrote?  Get the cute little Finnish girl into a sexual situation that she doesn&rsquo;t understand, but will undoubtedly love.  Even this reporter is oblivious to the problems of a Finnish female of any age going to take a sauna and camping in the woods with three foreign males.  See, Finnish boys and men are gentlemen, it is part of their culture.  So they just assume that their immigrants will join right in with those simple traditions.  </p>
<p>This report reflect&rsquo;s the height of cultural naivity.  I am sure that somewhere out there a film of the children&rsquo;s book, at least the sauna part, will be made and distributed via the internet.  Nice going, you criminal publishers.</p>

		<p>OMG. <br>
Oh, how I always yearned in my childhood for books with heroes having a bed-wetting problem. Instead I just have had to make do with Jules Verne books&hellip; </p>

		<p>Meanwhile the &#8220;xenophobic&#8221; and &#8220;racist&#8221; &#8216;True Finns&rsquo; party does nothing but increase their vote share with every election.  A situation mirrored in nearly every single other European country.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Tuukka-Omar&rsquo;s father comes from Syria. He got married to a Finn and settled in his wife&rsquo;s home country. He works as a taxi-driver.&#8221;</p>
<p>Translation: He invaded Finnish territory, and later conquered one of the Finnish women. They didn&rsquo;t just meet in between their respective countries, and flip a coin about where to live.</p>
<p>&#8220;The father also uses more florid language than Finns and listens to his son&rsquo;s troubles with more sensitive ears than does his mother, who is dedicated to her work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Translation: He&rsquo;s a &#8216;noble savage&rsquo;. His taxi driver income is paltry, and she&rsquo;s the bread-winner. Although she&rsquo;s carrying the burden of maintaining Finnish values, she must be portrayed as guilty of being too Western in her work ethic.  </p>

		<p>Years ago I encountered a Muslim family from North Africa.</p>
<p>The wife would automatically give up the front passenger seat to her young son. The boy would sit beside his taxi-driver father, while she rode in the back.</p>
<p>Equality of the sexes isn&rsquo;t part of their culture. Multiculturalism hides this fact and expects Westerners to allow themselves to be dominated by Eastern customs rather than fight them.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, I can just imagine a Somali boy taking a sauna and camping out in the woods. If they wanted to be realistic, they should have depicted him raping Aino and Jevgeni. After all, Somalis are very keen on rape, but not so much on taking baths and enjoying nature.</p>
