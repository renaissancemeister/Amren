<h1>U.S. Senate Candidate Ron Johnson Distances Himself From Controversial Genetic Views of Speaker He Helped Bring to Oshkosh</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Adam Rodewald, Northwestern (Oshkosh, Wisconsin), June 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>U.S. Senate candidate Ron Johnson is distancing himself from the views of a controversial political scientist who believes genetics are closely tied to intelligence Johnson helped bring to Oshkosh to speak with business and education leaders.</p>
<p>While serving as chairman of the Partners in Education Council, Johnson played a key role in bringing Charles Murray, a member of the conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute, to Oshkosh earlier this year.</p>
<p>Murray is best known for his controversial and bestselling book, &#8220;The Bell Curve,&#8221; which discusses genetic-based intelligence and differences in abilities among ethnic groups. The book also claims IQ is the best indicator of a person&rsquo;s potential success and provides the basis for class structure.</p>
<p>Johnson successfully booked Murray as the keynote speaker for the PIE council&rsquo;s annual Business/Education Summit in March. Murray spoke about his 2009 book, &#8220;Real Education,&#8221; which asserts, among other things, that too many students go to college, and America&rsquo;s future depends on the truly gifted.</p>
<p>Following Murray&rsquo;s speech, a member of the Oshkosh school board asked the group to apologize for bringing Murray to Oshkosh because of a post-speech conversation about the theory of genetically-based intelligence he thought was racist.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Johnson says Murray was invited to speak in Oshkosh because his message closely aligned with the business community&rsquo;s wish for schools to prepare students for all paths after high school, not just 4-year college. He said he was not familiar Murray&rsquo;s other views.</p>
<p>His campaign&rsquo;s communications director issued a statement that Johnson denounces any notion that hearing a person&rsquo;s views indicates an endorsement of those views.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly think everybody should have the opportunity to go to college,&#8221; Johnson said, adding, &#8220;Kids should have an in depth understanding of all their options, whether that is college, vocational or technical college or going right into the workforce.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On education, Murray has written that the education system&rsquo;s failures stem from a fundamental lie that every child can be anything he or she wants. Murray argues not every student should go to college and the future of America depends on the &#8220;cognitive elite.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Julie Leschke, the former coordinator of the PIE council who left to work with Johnson&rsquo;s campaign against U.S. Senator Russ Feingold, also played an influential role in booking Murray. Leschke wouldn&rsquo;t comment on this story, saying she is not authorized to speak to the press while working on the Johnson campaign.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bottom line is we took a unanimous vote to bring Charles Murray in,&#8221; Johnson said.</p>
<p>However, other members of the PIE Council say the idea originated with Johnson.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Call for speaker&rsquo;s apology</b></p>
<p>After Murray&rsquo;s March speech, school board member Matt Wiedenhoeft took issue with Murray&rsquo;s suggestions during an individual conversation that the United States couldn&rsquo;t keep up with Asian countries in producing engineers because of a difference in genetic abilities.</p>
<p>According to an e-mail Murray wrote to Leschke, he told Wiedenhoeft in a personal conversation that east Asians have more of the &#8220;visual-spatial abilities associated with engineering than whites or any other ethnic group.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wiedenhoeft said he believes the comments were racist and requested that the Partners in Education Council vote to apologize to the community for inviting Murray.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Murray told the Northwestern his theory is backed by IQ test data showing Japanese and Chinese students score higher on visual-spatial components of IQ tests than whites of European origin. He said that pattern is observed in both Chinese raised in China and Chinese Americans whose families have lived in the U.S. for multiple generations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you think of any explanation of this pattern that does not involve genes?&#8221; he wrote in an e-mail to The Northwestern. &#8220;The hand-wringing reaction of the council member, and of everyone who gets upset by any mention of ethnic differences is, in my view, childish.&#8221;</p>

		<p>When I read that a member of the Oshkosh school board wanted the council to apologize because he viewed Murray&rsquo;s comments as &#8220;racist&#8221; I asked myself, who is this numscull anyway? He must be black I thought . Further down in the article his name is revealved- Matt Wiedenhoeft. Since most american blacks have Anglo-Saxon surnames, it is highly unlikely that a Mr. Wiedenhoeft is a black man. More likely than not, he is another shallow, brainwashed and ignorant white liberal who has never taken the time of day to review Murray&rsquo;s theories or anyone else&rsquo;s with similar beliefs on race, genetics and IQ. <br>
How pathetic.<br>
No wonder we&rsquo;re in such a mess.   </p>

		<p>&ldquo;Can you think of any explanation of this pattern that does not involve genes?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Yeah, actually I can.  While I support Murray&rsquo;s candor, when you compare Asians to Whites, it is not as clear cut as Murray is stating.  Asian (and only East Asians) score only slightly higher than whites. I read that in the Bell Curve, and it  surprised me.  </p>
<p>Whites have been demonized in their own land.  We spend billions trying to ensure blacks score as high as whites on every test.  We have forced disruptive and unruly black students into the same classes as whites in the name of equality.  We have created a massive affirmative action program system that punishes white men.  When you consider the environment (IQ is not solely based on genetics), I wondered why East Asian scored only slightly higher than whites.  </p>
<p>Furthermore, I didn&rsquo;t see any clips of the Chinese walking on the moon.  I did see some white guys walking on the moon and they were supported by mission control  &mdash;  almost all white men.  You can&rsquo;t just buy your way to the moon, you have to have some high powered engineers to get your their.  But today, whites could never focus on such an endeavor.  No, today the focus would be on diversity.  </p>
<p>I am not saying I think whites are smarter that East Asian, I am just saying they appear to be on par with each other.  I think whites are more creative.  I also believe at the high end of the IQ spectrum, whites probably outscore Asians.</p>

		<p>Politically, it&rsquo;s understandable why Johnson would try to distance himself from Charles Murray. The nation is just not at the point where such views can be openly expressed by a Senate candidate. I give him credit though, as the fact that he even brought Murray to speak in the first place shows that he understands the reality of racial genetics and what that means for America; I don&rsquo;t buy that he was unaware of the book, &#8220;The Bell Curve&#8221;, and Murray&rsquo;s involvement with it. He&rsquo;s just trying to downplay that fact at the moment to get elected. </p>
<p>Some of you may call this spineless; I just call this practical. The oppressive boulder of multiculturalism weighing down this country has to be chipped away slowly lest America be shocked by the horror of the rotting corpse that lay beneath it.</p>

		<p>I was in college when The Bell Curve came out. If the subject ever came up on campus, I wasted no time saying, &#8220;what a racist. How can he say Asians are more intelligent than whites?&#8221; with all the seriousness I could muster. I was like liberal number one. </p>
<p>It was interesting the reaction. I was thought to be terribly out of order. Considering how afraid everyone was of African Americans, this statement was somehow seen as demeaning of the terrible &#8216;oppression&rsquo; that everyone was sure blacks live under (or the fear they have of blacks). It was quite a challenging to their world view. It was then I realized that the most racist, most &#8216;nazi&rsquo; thing of all, is to say whites are victims of something, especially &#8216;racism&rsquo;. They&rsquo;re used to conservatives, and anxious for the pleasure of quickly putting them in their place, but I was something truly objectionable.</p>

<p>I disagree that Whites can&rsquo;t keep up with Asians. It&rsquo;s true that Asians tend to do better on spatial differences than Whites but Whites I&rsquo;ve noticed tend to be more creative. Anyways, the reason the USA won&rsquo;t be able to keep up with Asia if we continue down the path we&rsquo;re going is that we are filling this country up with low IQ, mostly 3rd world Mexicans, dumbing down our schools for them, so that we won&rsquo;t be able to compete.</p>

		<p>Looks to me like we&rsquo;re shooting ourselves in the foot on this one.  Having created a great &#8216;multi cultural debate&rsquo; on the value of the individual and diversity in an equal opportunity environment, not genes and merit, we are now in a position of having to explain why:</p>
<p>1.  Junior can&rsquo;t go to the college he wants to because of affirmative action quotas.</p>
<p>2.  Why he must accept living in a service economy where the difference between a wage like his father had and &#8216;the rest of the workforce&rsquo; is based on literally outdoing every ethnic wage slave brought into the country _if he doesn&rsquo;t have the qualifications to go into higher learning_.</p>
<p>3.  Why it is that, when a labor glut, falling wages directly linked to illegal immigration and a national perception that the gravy train&rsquo;s stopping is _still_ &#8216;all white&rsquo;s fault&rsquo; we continue to import more, dumber, more socially insular, migrant populations to compete with him.  Cheaper.</p>
<p>See, like it or lump it, one of the things about a monoethnic culture is that it rewards social conformity with group altruism.  Knowing that, so long as you go with the flow and don&rsquo;t make too big a stink about union wages or pensions or insurance benefits, you will _belong_ to a culture as a nation that looks out for it&rsquo;s own.</p>
<p>And that your kids may do better that you because nobody is going to use your ethnic dedication to a work ethic to build something up and then discard the lot of you for some kind of Elitist economic reset button intended to create a permanent underclass, no middle class and a restrictive upper class.  Via wage suppression and export of decent jobs overseas.</p>
<p>All that is gone now.  And so we will indeed see how much of &#8216;nature vs. nurture&rsquo; remains valid when the extended family of race is no longer a mutually reinforcing placemark on the values of society as a whole.</p>

		<p>I read Charles Murray&rsquo;s book &#8220;The Bell Curve&#8221;, co-written by Richard Hernnstein, from cover to cover, and I thought it the most frightening book I ever read. Murray is a genius and a national treasure. The knee-jerk reactions of those silly people who objected to his comments regarding race say more about their PC brain-washing than they do about his comments.</p>

		<p>As a white male who was told he was not college material as early as 6th grad (by a really irresponsible teacher) and went on to become a doctor after never fitting in with early tries at blue collar employment, I have to agree with the idea that there are late bloomers who are intelligent.  I have a tested and retested IQ of 136, but you wouldn&rsquo;t have thought it when I was 16 and all I wanted to do was race motorcycles.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I am attending classes at the local community college and it is clear that the system is pretending that everyone can train for a new vocation at college.  Many people, especially those in the so-called &#8220;Protected Groups&#8221; seem to think that they don&rsquo;t have to try that hard, they will be allowed in wherever they want.  This rather proves the fallacy of the idea that everyone should or even could benefit society with a higher education.  &#8220;All big cheifs and no little indians,&#8221; as the saying goes.  I see women especially occupying all the cushiest jobs around, while men - white men, are increasingly self-employed plumbers, electricians, construction contractors, truck drivers, and salesmen.</p>
<p>This story is extra special to me; I was born in Oshkosh.</p>

		<p><i>&ldquo;I certainly think everybody should have the opportunity to go to college,&rdquo; Johnson said.<i></i></i></p>
<p>Ah yes, the Bill Clinton theory of higher education.  When we send people with IQs of 85 to college all we do is force colleges to dumb down their curriculum to the junior high school level.  The difference is that college is enormously more expensive than junior high school, so this imposes a huge drain on the economy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been 16 years since the publication of The Bell Curve and the topics it covers are still forbidden by the Thought Police.  The left still insists that the brain is the only organ of the body that is not subject to the laws of genetics and inheritance, even while they sneer at religious conservatives who doubt the truth of evolution through natural selection.</p>
<p>I think Murray misses his target when he argues that we can not be competitive with east Asians because of that group&rsquo;s  somewhat higher performance on the visual-spatial components of IQ compared to whites.  Our problem isn&rsquo;t the white people   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s the black and Hispanic population, which makes up an ever growing fraction of our population.  To the extent that white children aren&rsquo;t doing so well that&rsquo;s in large part due to the changes made in our schools needed to accommodate the diversity.  When &#8220;Teaching Tolerance&#8221; replaces calculus, guess where the next generation of engineers comes from?  When this country was over 85% white we didn&rsquo;t have any trouble keeping up with the Asians.</p>

<p>The facts are obviously on Murray&rsquo;s side, despite the blatant lies the left wishes the general populace to know:  &#8216;There Are No Differences Between the Races!&rsquo;  and &#8216;Race is a Social Construct!&rsquo;</p>
<p>We must, as Murray makes clear in his reply, challenge the left&rsquo;s lies, smoke them out, make them prove their lies and then use ridicule to drive the point home!</p>
<p>As Saul Alinsky points out in Rules for Radicals about how to defeat one&rsquo;s enemies, i.e., The White Establishment, in order to  &#8220;reorganization into a new social order of the dictatorship of the proletariat   &mdash;   the political paradise of communism.&#8221; (p.10)  &mdash;  use ridicule.</p>

		<p>I heartily concur that we whites may be lacking in some spatial abiliies. That said however we were the first with the space program we were the first with the bomb. Many Asian countries were stone age agri economies until we pulled them out of the muck. </p>
<p>Asians have had the same 40,000 years of evolution we have. If they are that much smarter than us then where&rsquo;s the proof. There is an underbelly to this bell curve stuff that is attempting to make whites third class citizens below blacks and asians. Be careful white folks the truth is a double edge sword.</p>

		<p>I always enjoy reading Charles Murray&rsquo;s book, &#8220;Human Accomplishment&#8221;.  It is very clear throughout certain parts of his book that he is a huge admirer of Asian culture.  In fact when he started writing the book, it was his goal to prove that Asians contributed far far more to science than they are given credit for.  After going through many sources and developing his own data, which he explains in detail in the book, he ends up finding out just the opposite, and what most people should already take for granted: White males are responsible for 80 to 90% of history&rsquo;s achievements.  I get this book from the library every now and then.  It confirms why I should be proud of my heritage and people.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think it is terribly important that Murray&rsquo;s statement about Asians versus whites be entirely accurate.  The important thing is that he openly suggested racial differences in intellect and did not back down.  Good for him!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe for a second that leftists consider the discussion of white/Asian I.Q. differences to be offensive.  Instead, they see it as a gateway to a discussion of white/black I.Q. differences and, since they worship blacks, this can not be tolerated.  This is similar to the leftist reaction against discussion of sports performance and claims that blacks have a genetic advantage in some sports.  Leftists don&rsquo;t have a problem with that - but they realize that this might open the door for discussions about I.Q., where blacks do not come out on top, and so they nip it in the bud.</p>

		<p>The IQ difference between Asians and whites is not THAT great.  Whites have great spatial abilities, just not quite a good on average.  The gap between Asian/WhiteEuro and Blacks is much larger.  That is the real point here, I think.  That, and the problem with mushy headed whites, addicted to feeling virtuous, who think if you keep repeating failed attempts at lifting up blacks, even giving them extreme privileges over youself and your children, that they will suddenly improve as a whole.  They never have and never will.</p>

		<p>There are real genetic differences and real cultural differences between the races, producing the educational outcomes we see.  I don&rsquo;t think anyone can define exactly how much of which influence is at work, but both are present.  Blacks have the worst of both factors.</p>
