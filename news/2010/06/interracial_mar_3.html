			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>George E. Curry, June 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Most news stories about a new study showing that 22 percent of Black male newlyweds and 9 percent of African-American females marry outside their race neglected to report another major finding: When Whites, Hispanics and Asians decide to marry outside their group, African-Americans rank last in their choice of mates.</p>
<p>A study by the Pew Research Center titled, &#8220;Marrying Out: One-in-Seven New U.S. Marriages is Interracial or Interethnic,&#8221; received widespread national attention. And many saw it as yet another confirmation that Black females are in a no-win predicament when it comes to marriage, especially marriage to another African-American.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the part of the report that most news outlets omitted: &#8220;Of the four groups tested in the survey, openness to a family member&rsquo;s marriage to an African-American ranked lowest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Looked at another way, even as the country has grown considerably more open-minded about interracial marriages over the last half-century, race still matters.</p>
<p>Of the four groups studied  &mdash;  Whites, Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians  &mdash;  Whites are least likely to marry outside of their race, which is not surprising given the advantages of White privilege in the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among African-American newlyweds [who married a non-black], 58 percent married a White person, 23 percent married a Hispanic, 7 percent married an Asian and 13 percent married someone of a mixed race, a Native American, or someone from another race.</p>
<p>Despite the huge gender gap among African-Americans, the intergroup marriage pattern between men and women was the same. Nearly 60 percent in each gender married a Caucasian. Nearly a fourth of Black women (24 percent) and 22 percent of African-American men married a Hispanic. Only 7 percent of Black men and 6 percent of African-American women married an Asian.</p>
<p>The gap between the number of African-American men and Black women marrying non-Blacks is growing. An estimated 1.3 percent of Black males and 0.9 percent of African-American females married outside their race in 1960. By 2008, however, 22 percent of Black males married a non-Black and 8.9 percent of African-American women.</p>
<p>The growing tendency of Black men to marry outside their race, coupled with the overall decline in marriage rates among all groups, is expected to compound the problem of African-American females finding a desired marriage partner.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Of Whites marrying outside their race in 2008, nearly half  &mdash;  49 percent  &mdash;  married a Hispanic, 18 percent married an Asian, 14 percent married an African-American and the remainder married someone from another group.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 22 percent figure for African-American males outside their race was comparable to the figures for Asian males. Almost a fifth  &mdash;  19.5 percent  &mdash;  of Asian males took on non-Asian brides in 2008. But Asian women were four times more likely than Black women to marry outside their race, with 39.5 percent of them married to someone of a different race or ethnicity.</p>
<p>Among the out-marriage Asian newlyweds, 75 percent married a White person, 12 percent married a Hispanic and only 7 percent married an African-American.</p>
<p>The pattern was similar among Hispanics marrying outside their ethnic group. The study reports that 81 percent of Hispanic newlyweds married a White person in 2008. Only 9 percent married an African-American and 5 percent married an Asian.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the mad rush to point to the growth of interracial marriages as evidence of a more accepting society  &mdash;  such marriages were outlawed in many states until 1967  &mdash;   the numbers show that race indeed still matters.</p>

		<p>Marriages are becoming a thing of the past in ghettos and barrios.  About 70% of all black births are out of wedlock, as are about 45% of Hispanic ones.  Men in the lowest strata of these two groups now juggle several girlfriends, adding white girls to their stables whenever possible.  Of the 1/4 or so of  births to white mothers that are out of wedlock, I wonder how many are fathered by black of Hispanic men.</p>

<p>You better believe it, George.  But since very few mestzos or Orientals seem to want to be married to blacks, either, you&rsquo;re going to have a hard time pinning this one on &#8220;White racism.&#8221;<br>

<p>This figure is counting foreign, mail order brides, etc, as if they were born in America, and is not an accurate figure for Asian women born in the USA.</p>
<p>&#8220;The study reports that 81 percent of Hispanic newlyweds married a White person in 2008. Only 9 percent married an African-American and 5 percent married an Asian&#8221;.</p>
<p>According to this, practically zero Hispanics marry other Hispanic&hellip;</p>

<p>What &#8220;White privilege&#8221;????? Yes, we Whites have privilege alright. The privilege to pay billions of our tax dollars for food stamps, section 8 etc. for dysfunctional minorities. The privilege to sit back while minorities get favored treatment from the government. Yeah right we have real great privileges here. Also, most Whites want to marry within their race just like other groups do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than eight-in-ten (83%) Hispanic men who out-married in 2008 married a white spouse, compared to 78% of Hispanic women,&rdquo; the study said. &ldquo;Among Hispanic female newlyweds who out-married in 2008, some 13 percent married a black spouse, compared with just 5% of Hispanic male newlyweds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I expect a large portion of these Hispanics are White Hispanics (basically Euro-Americans who happen to bear a Spanish surname or have some Spanish ancestry) or half-Hispanic half-White (i.e., one-quarter Amerindian).</p>

		<p>This is not the case where I live.  Seattle liberal white women are absolutely terminal with jungle fever.  Usually they approach it as a fling, you know, something you do so you can tell your girlfriends about it over martinis, but unfortunately it too often turns into a never-ending nightmare of mixed-race fatherless children that their own families won&rsquo;t accept and the father won&rsquo;t acknowledge.  Maybe this is why they wanted abortion so badly&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a &#8220;growing tendency&#8221; of black men to marry outside their race, it&rsquo;s a &#8220;growing tendency&#8221; of (mainly) white women who are willing to accept a black man as a mate, and frankly, a &#8220;growing tendency&#8221; of the families of white women to act as if this is an acceptable development.</p>
<p>Black men don&rsquo;t desire white women any more than they did in 1800.  It&rsquo;s white women who desire THEM more, or are more comfortable with acting out their fantasies in our &#8220;anything goes&#8221; society.  And when you consider the utter destruction of most white males by the feminists since WWII, part of me doesn&rsquo;t blame them for wanting a man that still exhibits some primal male qualities.  </p>
<p>I know a few black guys personally, and even these people who have managed to become civilized and assimilate to a degree LOVE to tell me all about the white women they bed.  </p>
<p>Their eyes light up and they get this smug look on their face, because they expect me to get irritated like most white men do when faced with this.  You can almost sense the disappointment when they fail to get a rise out of me.</p>
<p>I wish I could let them know the real reason I don&rsquo;t get mad about it without risking a fight; that I wouldn&rsquo;t give the time of day or poke with a 10 foot pole ANY white woman who strays to the dark side.  </p>
<p>All they&rsquo;re doing is revealing to me the traitors.  I plan to keep these people in mind in case of the arrival of WTSHTF or TEOTWAWKI so I can make sure they remain consistent in their choices.</p>
<p>Oh you need help?  You&rsquo;re starving?  Where&rsquo;s your big black mandingo now?  Oh he&rsquo;s not taking care of his children?  Didn&rsquo;t someone try to tell you this was going to happen?  Didn&rsquo;t you call them a racist?  Well there are &#8220;racists&#8221; here as well so I suggest you better be on your way to finish the good work of righting the wrongs of your white ancestors with your private parts.  </p>
<p>Too bad you can&rsquo;t eat or wrap yourself up in liberal racial bonafides to keep warm&hellip;&hellip;</p>

		<p>Here in New York City one cannot go a day without seeing not just one White woman with a man of another race, but several, especially if one walks in the &#8220;right places&#8221;.  It is absolutely incredible how vulnerable White women are to the race-mixing agenda that is being foisted upon us everywhere we look in the media.  Nearly every website you go to has a sea of different races usually with White males the least represented.  One website that I just visited is www.careerbuilder.com  </p>
<p>If you go to this website and do a search there is depiction at the top of the screen of a 20 something Black male next to a 20-something White Blond-haired female.  The depiction appears on the left side of the screen and then appears on right side, however, before the depiction on the right side disappears the Black male appears to &#8220;merge&#8221; or &#8220;join&#8221; with the White female.  The purpose of the imagery is clear:</p>
<p>White women go out and have sexual relations with Black men.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that that&rsquo;s stretching it either.  And this is job-search website!  This sort of thing is all over the place.  They&rsquo;re &#8220;telling&#8221; White women what they must do and they&rsquo;re doing it not by directly instructing them, but just with simple imagery.  Multiply this thousands or even 10&rsquo;s or 100&rsquo;s of thousand times and you have a population of lemmings being led to the precipice.</p>

		<p>There have been many articles about Americans and interracial marriage lately.  Different studies have yielded different conclusions: One study suggested that men are more racist than women when it comes to dating.  Another study showed that blacks of both sexes have a hard time getting dates from people of other races.  </p>
<p>The only study that I have found convincing is the one that analyzed response patterns for OkCupid online dating.  Black women receive the fewest responses despite sending out the most messages and Asian men are responded to the least of the men.  </p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s true that men of all races are less attracted to black women than women of all races are attracted to black men, it explains why black men marry outside of their race at a much higher rate than black women.  Similarly, if it&rsquo;s true that women of all races are less attracted to Asian men than men of all races are attracted to Asian women that that explains why Asian women marry out way more than Asian men.</p>

<p>Yes, I have always noticed - since my earliest moments of being consious of it (early in my youth around 1962) that blacks, both male and female seem to be eternally aimed at &#8220;marrying up,&#8221; or perhaps mating up.  I used to get hit on my black girls an awful lot in school if I but spoke one word to one.  The black boys seemed focused on impressing or somehow confronting white girls with their sexuality at every moment.  Putting it all together, all this struggle and difficulty, and it seems that being black is a real affliction.  It&rsquo;s almost as if the life force itself is against its existence and seeks a way out.<br>

		<p>To poster #3</p>
<p>I was having a conversation with a puerto rican woman the other day.  She likes to talk about race for some reason, and some of the things she says are so un-PC as to be unbelievable.  </p>
<p>(She has the hots for me, and can barely conceal it - tall well mannered and well built white guy with shiny blond/sunstreaked hair - probably the only such specimen she can regularly interact with in this very non-white city.  Alas, I&rsquo;m married and I believe in faithfulness, due to my conservative upbringing.)</p>
<p>She said that in her culture, the general preference for marriage rank order is 1. another puerto rican and 2. a white boy.  There is nothing after that.  She always becomes so animated in talking about how bad she thinks black men are, and she beamed when she bragged that she &#8216;never dated a black man - ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She said some of her friends bucked the norm and did marry black guys, and that those relationships are troubled.  </p>
<p>Other misc hispanics and mexicans I know (and I know a lot of them, due to my work situation) are really racist against black people in a way that would make a supremacist blush.  I am totally surprised by this.  (The Dominicans are more black-friendly and enjoy rap music).</p>
<p>I do know that many latina women actively seek out white guys.  One educated mexican woman said in an article I read, &#8220;Who am I supposed to marry, a latino lettuce picker?&#8221;</p>
<p>The thing is, many latinos are actually whites whose european parents or grandparents immigrated to south america.  Many other are mestizos, yet mostly white, and they look no more unusual than a lot of exotic looking Italian women who are obviously mixed up with north africa in their family tree somewhere.</p>
<p>A lot of white guys I know fall for those latina charms and &#8216;spiciness&rsquo; and because they know the kids will turn out white in appearance, neither they nor their families raise alarm bells.</p>
<p>So white/ whitish latina pairings are common, and it doesn&rsquo;t bother me at all.</p>

		<p>It  takes 2  to  tango, as  the saying  goes.  So maybe blacks  prefer  endogenous  marriages  more  than  the  other  groups.</p>
<p>Despite  the  fact  that  &#8220;Hispanic&#8221;  is  not  a  racial  category, one  must  wonder  why  the  study  assumes  otherwise.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve wondered about the tiny minority of whites who marry outside their race.  Maybe, Nature goes to the track and &#8220;lays off&#8221; some of her bet on a second horse.  Perhaps, survival of the species as a whole against novel pestilence is greater if a tiny proportion follow radical reproductive strategies?</p>

		<p>I have interacted with a lot if black men in recent years due to my job situation, and I can tell you, they have a &#8216;song and dance&rsquo; that is more polished than any other race of men.  Women of all races seem to be powerless to their smooth talking, direct ways.</p>
<p>I have seen such black guys (that I personally know) walk up to groups of white women they don&rsquo;t even know, with a fearlessness that I can only admire, and start the &#8216;hey baby&rsquo; talk.  </p>
<p>I must say that in ALL cases I have observed, and there have been many, the white girls always open up and never shoot the advances down.</p>
<p>Someone else on this board had mentioned once that black guys play a simple numbers game: x amount of rejections = x amount of conquests.  </p>
<p>My friends, our old fashioned values of how to go about securing a date/mate are being out gunned by better evolved strategies.  Alas, I will not become a hustler like that, so I guess I won&rsquo;t be having numerous children with lots of different women.</p>

		<p>While it might be dreadfully impolitic to so state, but for the most part black Africans in general don&rsquo;t conform to most accepted standards of human beauty, and those that do generally have a large percentage of other-race blood.</p>
<p>White men can generally find Asian and Hispanic women very attractive in some cases, though the obverse doesn&rsquo;t seem to be true for white women.</p>

		<p>My first thought/comment has already been written above but one point, why did the man write White privilege with a capital &#8220;W&#8221;.  Used in this way the word is an adjective not a capital name and so should have a small &#8220;w&#8221;.</p>
<p>But we all see the implied propaganda: dammit, it is pure propaganda.  Use the phrase &#8220;white privilege&#8221; as often as possible so all believe that the whites did not work hard and intelligently to establish their leadership and culture in the World.  They &#8220;stole it from the Third Worlders as the reverse is happening in Africa now.</p>
<p>Now we must stop it being crushed by the modern &#8220;Barbarians&#8221;.</p>

		<p>As a mulatto race, Hispanics lead the way in openess, in that they have an accepted term for marrying up the genetic ladder, &#8220;Mejora la Raza&#8221; means &#8220;improve the race by mating white&#8221; (or the lightest skin available).</p>
<p>Asian women desire white males because, on a primal level of attraction, the white male represents Western icons, like the cowboy, fighter pilot, knight in armour, movie star, renaissance artist-scientist, and the male who explored the world and built an unmatched technological civilization for his offspring. </p>
<p>Black women have told me they like the idea of having lighter skinned babies, though they&rsquo;re usually confined to finding mates who have some mulatto in their lineage.</p>
<p>Whites aren&rsquo;t the conquerers in the sexual game, they&rsquo;re the target of sexual predators.  White genetics are what non-whites want a piece of. </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know where you live, Jay, but I work part-time as a bouncer in San Francisco, and I see black guys using their scatter-gun tactics on women of all races all of the time. However, for all of their bluster, their confidence is false, for they are extremely insecure. If they are turned down, they immediately start cussing the woman out, calling her a racist whore, white b**ch, and worse.  They can&rsquo;t stand being rejected, it gives lie to their cherished myth that all females want to &#8220;get wit a brutha&#8221;.  They shake it off, however, buy themselves another Hennessey, stiff the bartender, and move on to the next girl. </p>
<p> I believe that&rsquo;s why some women allow these men to hit on them, and feign interest, because they want to avoid that verbal assault, and not appear prejudiced in front their friends.  I think most have no intention of dating these idiots. I rarely see these &#8220;players&#8221; leaving the club with any women.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually escorted a few of these &#8220;highly evolved dating strategists&#8221; out of my club for pestering my customers.  Trust me, it was my pleasure.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Of the four groups studied – Whites, Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians   &mdash;   Whites are least likely to marry outside of their race, which is not surprising given the advantages of White privilege in the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>If &#8220;White Privilege&#8221; is all that, then why are Arab-Americans kicking themselves for fighting so hard to get classified as White and are now trying to get their own non-White classification?</p>
<p>&#8220;White Privilege.&#8221;  Shyeah, right.  It&rsquo;s such a privilege to be the only non-protected class where Hate Crimes are concerned.  It&rsquo;s such a privilege to be taxed out the wazoo to support every person of color who wants to soak the system for benefits.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like TPTB are saying to White people that if they don&rsquo;t want mulatto or mongrel offspring, that&rsquo;s their privilege, but its going to cost them, big time, in every way imaginable and they will be paying through the nose for all perpetuity until they are willing to give up the thought of White offspring.  </p>

		<p>Whites are the least likely to marry outside their race and this is described as &#8220;white priveledge&#8221;?</p>
<p>This is really just simple demographics.  The large population of whites in the US means that any randomly chosen white man or woman is more likely to find a compatible partner who is of the same race.  On the other hand, the relatively small numbers - in most areas, anyway - of east Asians here means that any given Oriental man or woman is likely to encounter some difficulty finding a co-ethnic with whom they share enough in common to make a marriage work.  Who does the reader think a white guy in Billings, Montana is going to end up dating?  Who is a Chinese living in the same city going to date?  I rest my case.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whites aren&rsquo;t the conquerers in the sexual game, they&rsquo;re the target of sexual predators. White genetics are what non-whites want a piece of.&#8221;</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s true the results are unimpressive.  Traits like blonde hair and blue eyes rarely show up in mixed race kids.  In fact, 99 percent of the time the kids look like the nonwhite parent and if they&rsquo;re really unfortunate they&rsquo;ll have a wierd looking appearance to them.  <br>

		<p>Who cares. Nobody wants us so let&rsquo;s just stick to our own kind. Racial separation would be mutually beneficial, and would provide a morale boost to Black People. Not only would we not have to constantly &#8220;keep up with the Jones (the non-Blacks)&#8221;, we&rsquo;d also be forced to do for self, and if we succeeded in this, it would build greater self-confidence.</p>

		<p>Thank you, #21 - Michael, for putting this into perspective. I agree with you.</p>
<p>With regard to black males&rsquo; apparent success with white women, it reminds me of how Richard P. Feynman learned how to get girls to put out, as described in his book &#8220;Surely You&rsquo;re Joking, Mr. Feynman!&#8221;, in the chapter titled &#8220;You Just ASK Them?&#8221;.</p>

<p>I Agree 100% with what you say. Now in furtherance of our mutual goal, will you please ask blacks from Jamaica and Somalia to stop coming to my country of Canada?</p>

		<p>Jay you make some excellent points. I have observed the same kinds of situations where I live.<br>
My wife is Latina (Mexican parents), and she has a BA and MA. She too did not want to marry someone uneducated; but, to her chagrin, even the educated Latino men she dated exhibited chauvinistic behavior that she found unacceptable. </p>
