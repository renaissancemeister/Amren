<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The hired-gun immigrant behind a sensational murder-for-profit plot is about to walk free from prison  &mdash;  with a green card to boot  &mdash;  thanks to a sweetheart deal he worked out with federal prosecutors.</p>
<p>Killer Camuldeen Allie, 35, had been serving 15 years to life behind bars for gunning down Vernon &#8220;Dilly&#8221; Peter, 43, in July 1993 in exchange for $7,000.</p>
<p>The slaying was part of an infamous scheme in which four unsuspecting members of the Guyanese community were killed so that their beneficiaries could collect life-insurance payments.</p>
<p>But after Allie turned star witness against two co-conspirators  &mdash;  Queens insurance agent Richard James, 46, and Ronald Mallay, 61  &mdash;  in the federal racketeering case, helping to convict them, authorities paved the way for his release.</p>
<p>Allie is now set to walk out of prison a free man in August after having served only a fraction of his maximum sentence  &mdash;  and also will escape deportation back to his native Guyana with his government-approved green card in hand.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The US Attorney&rsquo;s Office declined comment.</p>
<p>Allie had initially been denied parole in 2008, even after cutting his deal with the feds.</p>
<p>He then promptly whined to federal Judge Sterling Johnson, who had overseen his trial, that he was being double-crossed by the government.</p>
<p>&#8220;I helped bring justice to a situation in which .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. people lost their lives,&#8221; he insisted in a letter to Johnson.</p>

		<p>It doesn&rsquo;t say here, but I&rsquo;m sure that one of the conditions of his early release is that he registers to vote and votes Democrat in every election, early and often.</p>

		<p>Federal prosecutors should not be allowed to play fast and loose with American identity and citizenship.</p>
<p>Offer the stoolie a million dollars in gold if necessary, but not residency. Treat American citizenship as the priceless object it is.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t believe this - a convicted killer will walk free among us, because he turned state&rsquo;s evidence in the commission of another felony, namely insurance fraud.</p>
<p>Then they wonder why people were running out and buying guns in record numbers coast to coast. This episode provides an answer. The Obama regime will not protect its citizens, so let&rsquo;s do it ourselves.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m reminded of a line from &#8216;Clear And Present Danger&rsquo;:  &#8220;Regular or Extra Crispy&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I guess the real question here is whether you would rather let the planners of your murder go unpunished or with significantly lesser, wrist-slap, penalties.</p>
<p>Or if you would prefer the triggerman be the one to get a walk into the sunlight.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Pals of his victim, Peter, were outraged. </p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s just not fair,&#8221; said Patricia Sewnanan, 34, who lives in Woodside, where Peter also resided. &#8220;I mean, Vernon was a good guy, and this guy does [17] years and then he can still go on with his life.&#8221; </p>
<p>James&rsquo;s lawyer, Steve Zissou, also ripped Allie&rsquo;s release. </p>
<p>&#8220;For anybody else, [federal] agents would have a detainer already filed against him and he would be deported,&#8221; Zissou said. <br>

<p>Seventeen Years is not a short stay in any prison.  But murder for hire is not a crime to be rewarded.  Ever.</p>
<p>I have to say they missed a great chance to make a case for &#8216;lethal injection or back to BFE after prison&rsquo; deportation as the lesser of two evils.</p>

		<p>Actually, I disagree with AR&rsquo;s implicit take on this.</p>
<p>Liberals always whine about illegal aliens being unwilling to work with cops for fear of deportation, and use this idea as an excuse for tolerating illegals to cut down on violent crime.</p>
<p>If we make it clear that helping the cops catch bigger fish, or fellow violent criminals, gets you a green card, that kills that argument, and lets the police crack down hard on BOTH violent crime AND illegal immigration.  The more of the latter they do, the more illegals will fall over each other to cooperate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to put up with 10% or so of the illegal population being allowed to stay in return for permanently deporting the rest (and effectively preventing their return via a real physical fence, strict hiring checks, etc.)</p>
