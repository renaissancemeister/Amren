			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Slevin, Washington Post, May 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Along a rugged stretch of the Mexican border here in southern Arizona, U.S. authorities captured 687 illegal immigrants in a 24-hour period last week, three times the number captured near San Diego. During the past eight months, agents have apprehended 168,000 migrants along this sector of the border.</p>
<p>The border crossers are so determined, and so impervious to a long-running buildup of federal agents and technology, that few here think President Obama&rsquo;s recent decision to dispatch 1,200 National Guard soldiers and $500 million will make much difference.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nogales is the heart of a 262-mile stretch of border defined by sharp rises, steep ravines and brutal desert heat. As border controls are tightened elsewhere, including through the construction of a border fence in parts of Arizona, California, Texas and New Mexico, Mexican migrants and smugglers have gravitated to the 90,000-square-mile area known by U.S. Customs and Border Protection as the Tucson Sector.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you plug a hole in the wall, the water looks for another spot to flow through. Arizona is that spot,&#8221; said Nogales police chief Jeff Kirkham, who reported that immigrants are &#8220;going over the wall, going through the wall or through tunnels.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others try to make their way though the remote desert where the high fence stops. Once across the border, they face a daunting trek that can stretch 30 miles or more in heat approaching 100 degrees. Agents staff checkpoints and crisscross the area, supported by millions of dollars worth of sensors, cameras, surveillance aircraft and computer technology.</p>
<p>Since 2006, staffing of the Tucson Sector has increased 30 percent, to about 3,200 officers. But immigrants from across the globe keep coming over the border  &mdash;  alone or in groups, sometimes guided by smugglers, sometimes arriving at official crossings neatly dressed and with fake papers.</p>
<p>On a typical day, nearly 1 million people cross from Mexico into the United States, according to U.S. government figures. About 270,000 vehicles cross the Southwest border every 24 hours, along with about 57,000 truck, rail and sea containers. Sixty percent of the Mexican fruit and vegetables entering the United States comes through Nogales.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So far, 210 miles of the 262-mile Tucson Sector border is fenced. McCain, facing GOP primary challenger J.D. Hayworth, a border hawk, made waves by declaring in a campaign advertisement filmed in Nogales: &#8220;Complete the danged fence.&#8221;</p>

		<p>USA cannot even control its own borders but yet number one in military might?  Something is wrong and the invaders know it.  This country is run by corruption and the average citizen has very power to change it.  How corrupt? Look no further than the imprisonment of Richard Fine in Los Angeles.  He has been in the can for 15 plus months without even being charged.  He has submitted numerous appeals to be released, all ignored.  Why is he jailed?  For exposing the illegal bribes some judges have taken.  To protect themselves, Ronald George, presiding judge of the state Supreme Court, quickly had the legislature pass a bill protecting those judges.  The California State Bar also disbarred Richard Fine because he has been harassing judges by filing appeals on corrupted rulings!  How about that?     </p>

<p>Well, this is just intuitive. And that is too why the barrier, NOT a fence, needs to be built ALONG the ENTIRE border with Mex. I repeat this - - India just completed a FENCE, double, twelve foot high, with razor wire in between, lit at night, on their border with Bangladesh, and that fence is 4,000 kilometers long. That is about 2,500 miles. LONGER than our border with Mex. The question immediately comes to mind. IF India can do it, WHY not U.S.</p>

		<p>Border Fence should be made to withstand cranky hurricane-force hot air.</p>
<p>There are four technical aspects of the Border Fence that are not often enough discussed: (1) Speed of construction; (2) Timing; (3) Exact location; (4) Quality of construction. The best answers are: (1) The final stage of construction should take place at lightening speed; (2) Timed to coincide with the next trip Senator John McCain takes touring the border; (3) The Border Fence should be constructed immediately to the north of the Senator; (4) This barrier should be impenetrable and soundproof.<br>

		<p>I heard this morning that a suggestion has been made that school children be taught that the Arizona laws is unAmerican. I suppose that will be followed up by the teacher explaining that it is the right of everyone in the world to invade the US and that the expense, crime and destruction of our nation by illegal aliens is perfectly okay. God help America!</p>

<p>Good idea! let&rsquo;s import 300,000 Indians to build the fence to keep out 40 million ILLEGAL ALIEN mexicans we could offer ohhhhhhhhh say H1B visas. I&rsquo;m kidding of course, but that sort of thinking is how OUR government thinks</p>
