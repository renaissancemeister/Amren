<h1>Record Number of Indian Candidates Seeking Office</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jesse Washington, Google News, June 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new wave of Indian-American candidates are running for high-profile office across the country. At least eight children of Indian immigrants are running for Congress, governor or attorney general  &mdash;  the most ever.</p>
<p>The star of this trend is Nikki Haley, born Nimrata Nikki Randhawa (nim-RAH&rsquo;-tah NICK&rsquo;-ee rahn-DAH&rsquo;-wah). {snip}</p>
<p>Haley is a Republican who uses an American name and converted to Methodism from the Sikh religion. That has led to accusations of abandoning her heritage to get votes.</p>
<p>Raj (RAHJ&rsquo;) Goyle is seeking the Democratic congressional nomination in his hometown of Wichita, Kan. {snip}<br>

		<p>From what I understand, Indians are the most liberal ethnic/racial group in the country, save for the blacks. They are more liberal than Orientals, more liberal than hispanics, &amp; more liberal than Jews. About 90% of them vote democratic. If the republicans had any common sense they&rsquo;d end the HB-1 scam on this basis alone, but I guess this proves they don&rsquo;t have any. </p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s disgusting about all of this is that we now have a new &#8216;model minority&rsquo; which the press is going crazy about. They are all furiously spraying teflon on Indians as if we are all now to look up to them as equal to or even better than we are. And forget about criticizing them at all. The John Batchelor radio show, for example, regularly has this guy Tunku somebody-or-other on whose sole purpose for being there seems to be to cheerlead these wonderful new &#8216;Americans&rsquo;. Never mind that any neighborhood where Indians live, even the affluent ones, immediatly turns into Calcutta after a critical mass of them move in. They are currently the most overrated minority by far and any lsrge number of them in the country can mean no good. Disgraceful.</p>

		<p>Americans take warning: here in Canada, East Indians have a broader history of political involvement, and they&rsquo;ve shown a craving for power.</p>
<p>Most are socially conservative and have little interest in being &#8216;average&rsquo; Westerners pursuing average distractions.  They come from a land where people are stratified into social classes, and they see our society as a free ladder to climb, with their eyes fixed on the top.</p>
<p>Those who surround themselves with an Indian community organize in the temple.  Those who spend most of their time around whites seek out the liberals who approve of diversity as a cause, or the conservatives who have no racial scruples.</p>
<p>Where they can gather a critical mass, they join a party and pool their votes to secure office for &#8216;one of their own&rsquo;.  They are shameless in their competition with whites, but sensitive to any slights against their race.</p>
<p>In Canada, it is not uncommon to find websites where they brag of how many Sikhs, Hindus, or Pakistani Muslims hold elected office, university degrees, or influential positions.  </p>
<p>Racial competition against the host white population gives them the motivation of the underdog. </p>

		<p>First a wave of motel/hotel managers, then a wave of H1-B and L1 visa holders, now a wave of politicians who will no doubt work to bring even more of their fellow countrymen here. A disturbing trend indeed.   </p>

		<p>When someone mentioned Indians were being called &#8220;a model minority&#8221; I just could not help but be reminded of &#8216;Anand Jon Alexander&rsquo;, the so-called fashion designer who was convicted after a sexual predation spree across America.</p>

<p>Many white women travelling in India find out that Indian men stare at them with undisguised lust.  This is the real India.</p>

		<p>When will White Americans wake up to the threat of nonwhite immigration? We seem to have sold out our own race and heritage to those who are jealous and vindictive of our own race. I, as a Republican, will never vote for any nonwhite to hold any office whatsoever in MY country. Just look at how the Republicans praise Bobby Jindal!</p>

<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
Hispanics are not liberal!  Blacks are not liberal! Moslems (when Indians) are not liberal!<br>
These are all some of the most narrow, closed-minded, intolerant, illiberal people we have in this country. (I&rsquo;m not calling them conservative either, in a political sense; they&rsquo;re not interested in &#8220;conserving&#8221; YOUR culture, that is, just their own.)  </p>
<p>If they vote for Democratic, or &#8220;liberal&#8221; politicians and policies, that is only in order to get all they can get out of it, because liberals are the most generous to them,  not because of any liberal philosophical or social views. Far from it.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about voting proclivities of East Asian Indians, but my impression of them from working with them as chemical engineers is that they are quite conservative, at least socially. Indians typically marry other Indians. They are obsessed with getting ahead and making money here in the U.S., not necessarily a bad attribute, but one with side effects such as less employment for professionals such as myself (I probably would be employed right now if there were fewer Indian chemical engineers in the U.S.). I went to college in the 70s, and MOST of the grad students in chemical engineering at my school were Indians.</p>
<p>Next time the National spelling bee comes up (or any other academic bee), see how many Indians are represented. I&rsquo;ll wager there will be a lot of them. It isn&rsquo;t accidental; Indian families have high expectations for their children, and band together to provide resources to enhance their success.</p>

		<p>Hindus and Sikhs are of the same race as Pakistanis and Bangladeshis.  </p>
<p>They harbour but also mostly endeavour to disguise a deep dislike and even racial hatred of White peoples of every nationality which is also pretty well known even though they&rsquo;ve had their own sub-continent and self-rule returned to them during the early part of the last century.  </p>
<p>Canada noticably, has been an Indian Sikh/Hindu primary choice destination for decades and consequently has amassed one of the world&rsquo;s most prolific populations of Sikhs outside of the India sub-continent.</p>
<p>Their ultimate aims are precisely the same as those of Blacks, Orientals and assorted other non-White races including of Muslims currently in the process of colonising White homelands, ie, to usurp White power and culture in every White homeland, disposses White peoples everywhere of their legitimate birthrights and steal their homelands, leading inevitably to permanent <b>enslavement</b> of all White peoples.  </p>
<p>Therefore, <b>all</b> non-Whites are our enemies and must be repatriated if we are to survive at all.<br>

		<p>My mom is obsessed with Indian doctors.  She goes to an Indian MALE OBGYN which to me is sickening.  It would be hard enough for me to go to a white male, so why would any white woman in her right mind go to a NONWHITE male?  My mom also insists that the best heart doctor in her city is an Indian as well.</p>
<p>I am sick of this praising of an ethnic group that hasn&rsquo;t even earned our praise yet.  With Northeast Asians, I can slightly understand the praise, but not with Indians. When did Americans decide these people make the best engineers, doctors, and NOW politicians?</p>
<p>If Bobby Jindal runs against Obama in the next election, that will be the first election that I as a Republican don&rsquo;t vote for my party.  If Republicans are stupid enough to put him up as their top candidate then they don&rsquo;t deserve to exist as a party.  And if white Republican voters are stupid enough to vote for him then they shouldn&rsquo;t be voting. If it is those two running in 2012, and not enough whites see the irony of how representative that is of whites getting completely shoved out of their own politics, then we are doomed.</p>

		<p>  It&rsquo;s ironic that most successful Indian-American politicians are Republicans but Indians as a group vote Democratic. Indian immigrants in places like Trinidad or Fuji are looked on as an anti-indigenous, criminal oriented group. They are not particularly liked in Africa either and have been expelled from numerous African countries. Of course, we have tended to get the Indian elites here in America, which has skewed our view of the Subcontinent.  In this age of high unemployment and declining industry, I question our need for massive immigration from India. A few wealthy industrialists and eminent scientists/engineers should be all we accept. </p>

		<p>If the case against post-1965 immigration policy is made exclusively in terns of economics, an economic argument is being made for the race-replacement of the Native Born White American majority. This is exactly what&rsquo;s going  in Canada. Mexicans and Haitians are an economic drag&hellip;increase-massively-the number of Hindu,Sikh,Korean,Chinese and Pakistani legal immigrants. The end result of an exclusively skills based economic argument for immigration is the race-replacement of Native Born White Americans street-by street,town by town,city by city and state by state. California,Miami and NJ are examples of this. </p>
<p>Steve Sailer is well known enthusiast for the economic case against certain kinds of immigrants-Hispanics-for other kinds of immigrants-Asians. He is pushing- in his own wonkish way- a race-replacement post-1965 immigration policy. No one here should have any doubt about this.</p>
<p>South Asian legal immigrants are actively participating in the race-replacement of the Native Born White American majority. No one here should have any doubt about this.</p>

		<p>That a race between Jindal and Barry Obama for POTUS is even possible is unreal.  This would mean that both, as the only representatives in office for their particular racial group at the time, would be promoted above all others for the highest attainable office. I&rsquo;m sure this possibility has been seriously considered by both political parties as a plausible outcome.  More frightening is the thought that the voters would accept this scenario as desirable.      </p>

<p>I totally agree!  Republicans (White ones, that is) are about the stupidest people on earth. Just like appointing Michael Steele as head of the GOP left a bad taste in my mouth. They are so quick to praise any nonwhite &#8220;conservative&#8221; as one of their own. Ever hear these neo-con talk radio hosts? They HINDER the conservative movement rather than help. They will NEVER discuss RACE and if they do it is always siding with the nonwhite ones. They are such cowardly traitors.</p>

		<p>Where I work I&rsquo;ve been blessed with experiencing Diversity, much of that with people of the Asian subcontinent.</p>
<p>They are a very clannish people and will stick together and play the race card when needed. Some are highly competent but many are lazy incompetents. The incompetents have been getting the promotions as much as the competent ones. They are relishing in the anti-whiteness of my employer (and what has become of the good old USA). I could relate more anecdotal work happenings but maybe later&hellip;</p>
<p>In a way you cannot blame them for sticking together so tenaciously. This is a race realist site. What is truly disastrous is white Uncle Toms allowing this to happen. My left wing colleague recently commented that he &#8220;loves the Diverse environment&#8221; this after Indians have been getting all the recent higher promotions. </p>
<p>Also, Indians are not all politically liberal. Jindal and Haley are repubs and Pia Varma is a Libertarian running as a Republican. <a href="http://www.piavarma.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.piavarma.com/</a> Of course there&rsquo;s Peter Brimelow&rsquo;s favorite National Reviewer Ramesh Ponnuru. </p>
