	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} [A] problem USA Swimming hopes to highlight Thursday in a report [shows] that 70% of African-American children and 58% of Hispanic children have little or no swimming ability, compared with 40% of Caucasian children.</p>
<p>Evidence of a continued swimming gap comes as the economic slowdown has cut back opportunities for inner-city kids to swim. {snip}</p>
<p>The report, including interviews with children and parents in several cities, revealed that the biggest barrier to inner-city swimming proficiency isn&rsquo;t a lack of pools and instructors, but parents&rsquo; fear of water.</p>
<p>Among low-income families, &#8220;many parents wouldn&rsquo;t let kids swim even if lessons were free, a theme that was tested four times in different focus groups,&#8221; according to a summary of the study, conducted by Richard Irwin, professor of health and sports sciences at the University of Memphis. &#8220;Overall, fear trumped financial concerns across all respondent race groups in low-income families.&#8221;</p>
<p>The low swimming-proficiency rate reflects both the prohibition against blacks in public pools that lasted well into the civil-rights era and a legacy of bogus science that, as recently as the 1970s, claimed blacks were biologically disadvantaged in water. In an interview, Dr. Irwin said black parents who can&rsquo;t swim often go to incredible lengths to keep their children away from water. {snip}</p>
<p>According to the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 5- to 14-year-old African-Americans drowned at 3.1 times the rate of whites in that age range, from 2000 to 2006. And in that period African-American kids were five times as likely as white kids to drown in swimming pools, in some cases inches from safety. {snip}</p>

		<p>The Achievement Gap and the Drowning Gap</p>
<p><br/>
The achievement gap can be closed if Whites would quit trying so hard, and likewise for the drowning gap.</p>
<p>Or better yet, prohibit Whites from ever teaching their own White children how to swim unless they are also teach a black to swim at the same time.   White parents who show favoritism for their own White Children should be charged a &#8220;Race Bias Tax&#8221; for not helping the black kid as much as their own.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where we are headed.  White parents should spend their time teach their kids all survival skills, not just swimming.<br/>

		<p>A typical Black would attribute this to White racism.  After all Blacks are not as good at swimming as Whites because White racism keeps them from having the same facilities as Whites.  And if they do get the same facilities and they don&rsquo;t make the team it&rsquo;s because of institutional White racism.  And if they do make the team and don&rsquo;t swim as well it&rsquo;s because their coaches are giving more attention and assistance to the White swimmers.  And if the coaches are giving the same attention to the Blacks and the Blacks don&rsquo;t perform as well, it&rsquo;s because their neighborhood is bad - and it&rsquo;s bad because of White racism.</p>
<p>They will always have an excuse no matter how nonsensical it is.</p>

		<p>What this tells me is that  if I am fortunate enough to be accosted by a gang of Hispanics or Blacks next to a river or a large body of water, I simply need to jump in. Doing so would give me a 75% chance of evasion with no more effort than paddling away on my back&hellip;<br/>
 By the way my own mother was phobic about the water. But she made sure I wasn`t because she knew she wouldn`t be there or able to help me. Like my Cajun buddy said, &#8220;There`s two types of people in this world. Those that can fall off a shrimp boat drunk at night and make it to shore and those that can`t.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Every black I ever saw try in high school was a sinker.  Heavy bones and denser soft tissues, I think.  But to rectify this gap, someone will have to deprive white children of swim classes, or just outright drown some whites. It&rsquo;s coming to that, going by the logic our government uses in deciding on who to protect and who not to.  It&rsquo;s a perfect analogy.  Drown whites so that there can be more monority swimmers, even if the sucessful minority swimmers remains the same and performance drops.  It&rsquo;s the new American Way.</p>

		<p>Like most liberal-toned articles, this one speaks with a forked tongue.  Blacks drown because whitey won&rsquo;t let them learn to swim, yet black parents won&rsquo;t let their kids learn to swim anyway!  <br/>
One reason for the problem is probably that blacks, on average, have thicker, denser  &mdash;  and thus heavier  &mdash;  bones.  They also might tend to panic more easily, and  &mdash;  in the case of &#8220;helpless&#8221; ghetto types  &mdash;  wait for some white man to help.</p>

		<p>My thoughts go back to 1953 when I went swimming in the municipal pool in Ashville, North Carolina. There were two separate pools (I don&rsquo;t remember if they were equal).</p>
<p>Blacks could go swimming back then. It was just segregated.<br/>

		<p>Whenever I see black at the beach I am always just a little surprised.  When I was a kid it was always said blacks don&rsquo;t like water.  Maybe it is some primal fear of theirs, sort of like their belief in ghosts and spirits which seems very common even amomg college educated blacks.  </p>

		<p>Decades ago, I&rsquo;m told, Jackson&rsquo;s Ross Barnett Memorial Reservoir (Why couldn&rsquo;t it just be Lake Barnett?)had a swimming area for blacks.  Cocoa Beach, as it was referred to (can&rsquo;t imagine why&hellip;) was the scene of one mass-panic/drowning after another.  Often, people drowned in a foot or two of water&hellip;maybe less.  So when the Wallstreet Journal author says &#8220;&hellip;in some cases inches from safety.&#8221;  I have to wonder if he means &#8220;&hellip;in mere inches of water.&#8221;  You get a good stampede going&hellip;maybe a Garfish touches a foot, and someone decides it&rsquo; a snake&hellip;and you&rsquo;d think a school of giant Piranhas was attacking&hellip;or that they were running out of Fried Chicken&hellip;.total pandemonium.</p>
<p>And heaven forbid someone should spot an actual Snake.</p>
<p>As for the &#8216;bogus science that blacks are biologically disadvantaged in water&rsquo;, I think the author should have phrased it &#8216;forbidden science&rsquo;, instead.  Home one summer from Tulane, I took Swimming 101 at Delta State.  There were several elite black athletes in the class.  They sank like lead. Drown-proofing training did not work for them.  Swimming was a huge effort for them: as much so as it was like floating on air, for me.  Come to think of it, I&rsquo;m not sure they even were able to finish the class.  But as slender as I am, I (and the other whites) floated like a cork. It&rsquo;s a &#8216;bogus science&rsquo; about like the concept of &#8216;race&rsquo; is bogus.  They may be forbidden, but they&rsquo;re still real.</p>

		<p>This is truly a tragedy, but a simple solution exists:</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know how to swim, STAY OUT OF THE BLEEPIN&rsquo; WATER! And take some swimming lessons in a controlled environment! </p>
<p>How smart do you have to be to figure THAT out?</p>

		<p>Why should anyone care? </p>
<p>I am a poor swimmer because I don&rsquo;t float (non-obese Black men are likewise buoyancy challenged), so I don&rsquo;t get into swimming situations, and I avoid aquatic problems. In fact, the only people who are concerned are trouble making Liberals. </p>
<p>Notice how liberals, as usual, blame white men for the problem:<i>The low swimming-proficiency rate reflects both the prohibition against blacks in public pools that lasted well into the civil-rights era and a legacy of bogus science that, as recently as the 1970s, claimed blacks were biologically disadvantaged in water.</i> </p>

<p>Yeah, and while we&rsquo;re at it, why don&rsquo;t we talk about how night and day are caused by the switching off of lights aimed at our flat earth, contrary to that &#8220;bogus&#8221; theory that the earth is round and revolves around the sun!</p>
<p>Anyway, how does a &#8220;prohibition against blacks in public pools&#8221; back in the 1960&rsquo;s (which to today&rsquo;s young blacks is ancient history) affect swimming ability in 2010?  There are swimming pools at nearly every public high school, are there not? </p>
<p>According to the &#8220;logic&#8221; of this article, because blacks up to the 1960s were banned from public pools, that caused them to fail to develop proficiency at swimming (which they never knew about because they were never allowed to swim anyway), which has caused today&rsquo;s generation of black mothers to be terrified at the thought of letting their kids swim? Makes sense to me. </p>
<p>Common sense serves no purpose when there is an agenda to be served.</p>

<p>Mostly this is because black folks do foolish things and go in areas where they should not go and end up in &#8220;deep water&#8221;, so to speak.</p>
<p>Like a few years ago in Texas where the crowd from Chi went into the outdoor fountain or whatever it was. The deep end had a whirlpool and they got caught and could not extricate themselves. One went in and got caught. A second went in to get the first out and got caught too. A third went in to rescue the second and got caught. Etc.</p>

		<p>I think people are missing something  &mdash;  black lifeguards.</p>
<p>I live in Brooklyn and used to always go to Coney Island every summer well Brighton Beach (the much whiter mostly Russian beach). </p>
<p>Last year I noticed all the life guards at Coney Island were black male teenagers. None of your typical bleach blond white surfer dudes at all. It was astounding how many of them would just lounge around listening to IPODs, flirting with the ladies and zooming around the beach on their ATVs. Anything but working. There was also a massive epidemics of drownings last years. All black children of course.<br/>

<p>Bogus science? My step-father is an EMT, and he has said that mandatory seminars or classes, they actually teach them, to this day, that blacks ARE poorer swimmers than whites. Something about their bone structure I think. Liberal journalists may like to deny the truth, but in professions that involve life-or-death situations, the truth is vital. And I can;t believe their syaing now that blacks weren&rsquo;t allowed to swim. Really? Don&rsquo;t they know that segregation emant seperate swimming pools, not denying swimming rights to blacks.</p>
<p>And for the record, I myself can&rsquo;t swim (I nearly drowned once and from that point on I haven&rsquo;t liked the water at all). But you don&rsquo;t see liberal complaining about the fatc that 40% of whites can&rsquo;t swim. Oh no, they only care about the blacks.</p>

		<p>Here, around the lakes in Fresno County, the Mexicans like to sit on the beach drinking beer and watching the teen age white girls laying out in bikinis while they wear street clothing. When they get nice and drunk, they hop into the lake fully dressed and act like fools. Maybe thats why more then a few of them end up drowning. And its not just males that swim in their clothes, I have seen whole families swimming and not one bathing suit to be seen in the bunch. Its very rare to see a Mexican girl in a bikini.</p>

		<p>Perhaps Blacks and Hispanics would spend more productive time expanding their minds in the water instead of forming gangs in the inner city. All it takes is parental initiative and guidance which seems to be lacking. I personally have taught my girl friend of hispanic heritage to swim better. Although she grew up in a Los Angeles High School which provided a pool, while I went to Catholic School (forget the pool), she seemed to be lacking in guidance. Soon I will have her ready for the Mexican Olympic Swim Team; don&rsquo;t worry America your position in International Swimming Competition is quite safe. Mexicans cannot swim they just jump (the border) quite safely and effectively.</p>

		<p>This does not excuse the folly of youth and think that since you know how to swim, you can swim anywhere. We should also educate our youth on the dangers of swimming in unguarded areas. Here in Buffalo there has been a rash of male teenagers, all white, drowning in local creeks and canals. In an effort to escape the heat, thery jump off of railroad bridges or swim in canals. The all too familiar story, a cry for help and then they went under. The combination of cold water &amp; muddy conditions are tragic. </p>

		<p>I read an excellent series of books about big game hunting in Africa several years ago.  The rivers and lakes there are infested with crocodiles.  In one village the watering hole was an especially dangerous place and on average a fatal croc attack occurred at least once a month.  The response of the villagers was nothing.  They simply accepted the casualty rate of 1-4 per month while gathering water.  To build cage around the watering hole or a piping system (or to kill the crocs) was simply beyond their comprehension it seems.  </p>

		<p>This story almost has an AmRen touch to it. 3 times more likely to drown, called &#8216;a swim gap&rsquo;. The reporter didn&rsquo;t have to print the nonsense the black &#8216;expert&rsquo; gave him, yet he did so almost gleefully. He could have called another expert. Still, the &#8216;swim gap&rsquo; may turn out to be as illusory as the &#8216;intelligence gap&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>This article is nothing but the truth as I am a case in point.  I grew up in Africa and I&rsquo;ll confess swimming is not in African or most of my Cameroonian culture.  At age 48,I have a phobia for water just like most of my compatriots from Cameroon.  To compound matters, I grew in in the hinterlands of my country very far away from the coast.  I also had a protective father who believed my going to the river to swim in the Cross river was an indirect path to being served as lunch to the hippopotami in that river.  That has shaped my psyche as today I would not let my teen daughter to pass by a pool as I don&rsquo;t want her to drown!!!!</p>

		<p>When I was a teenager, I worked at a well known amusement park in eastern Pennsylvania where many &#8220;inner city youths&#8221; would be bussed in, providing weeks of entertainment. Aside from being threatened and called ugly racial names by these people every time they lost the basketball game (the game and myself were racists), at LEAST twice a summer I&rsquo;d hear about some black kid drowning in the wave pool. An impressive feat considering the pool&rsquo;s packed with people and no more than 4 feet deep.</p>
<p>C&rsquo;est la vie&hellip; another stereotype rings true. Say, who wants to open up a pool someplace to &#8220;benefit inner city youth&#8221;?<br/>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t try Coney Island, Brighton Beach, or (worst of all) the Rockaways without a lifejacket and several months&rsquo; experience of swimming laps in a pool.  Someone had once suggested posting signs illustrating typical current patterns at those beaches.  *Expect to* get swept out.  Moreover, the bottom will suddenly drop off to 100 feet deep, within what looks like reasonable swimming distance from shoreline.  It&rsquo;s dangerous even to jump the waves (different velocity layers ==&gt; torque ==&gt; you get tipped over ==&gt; you&rsquo;re swimming! ==&gt; the abovementioned issues now apply).  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d ban anyone with an IQ of less than 100 from those beaches, if there were a way to do so.  </p>

		<p>This story isn&rsquo;t really about drowning blacks.  It&rsquo;s part of a prolonged assault on the self image of gullible Whites.</p>
<p>The Left knows that it must continually feed the minds of Whites with stories about how all problems for the blacks were caused by Whites.</p>
<p>If a black makes and F instead of an A on a test, automatically Whites are supposed to start asking themselves what they didn&rsquo;t do that they should have.   Repeat, repeat.</p>
<p>All black pathologies are sacraments in the Religion that holds sacred the idea that Whites should always be off balance and in a state of self doubt and in need of solutions to their biases and racism that causes so much misery for their fellow creatures in Christ, the noble but plighted &#8220;African American.&#8221; </p>
<p>The purpose of the drowning story isn&rsquo;t to suddenly implement swimming programs so the blacks will stop drowning, but to keep Whites in agreement with &#8220;Diversity is Our Strength, No Person is Illegal, Equality of Opportunity is Not Enough, We Must Do More to Bring About the Promise of America to All its Citizens,&#8221; etc.</p>
<p>Again, the target of these stories isn&rsquo;t the safety of the blacks, but instead it is aimed at the confidence and self image of Whites as Whites.</p>
<p>The trick has worked since the days of Boas and Myrdal, but we must ask, in view of the Internet and the free flow of information, how much longer can the trick keep working?</p>
<p>The solution is to &#8220;Police the Internet for Hate and Bigotry.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they enforce that, the trick can continue toward its total end: the mongrelization of White Race until we exist no more.</p>
<p>But will that apply to all Whites, or just the Celtic Christians?</p>
<p>Which Whites will be exempt from extermination by mongrelization?  The one&rsquo;s controlling the message, that&rsquo;s who.</p>

		<p>   When I was about six years old, my grandfather and I were walking by a slow-moving but deep creek.  He asked me if I could swim and I said &#8220;No.&#8221;  He replied that this was as good a place as any to learn.  He picked me up and threw me in.  As I screamed and panicked he just kept yelling, &#8220;kick&#8221; &#8220;kick&#8221;.  I did and though I&rsquo;m not a graceful swimmer, I am not afraid of the water and I still get the job done.</p>
<p>   That&rsquo;s not really a swimming story, it&rsquo;s a life story.  Throw you in to something, give you instructions on how to deal, and teach you to solve your problems through your own effort.  Teach you to not panic in the face of surprise and fear, work your way out.  It&rsquo;s a white way of doing things.  Blacks have no ability to teach or understand those concepts.</p>
<p>     P.S. - This afternoon I&rsquo;m going to start digging a moat.</p>

<p>Last year I noticed all the life guards at Coney Island were black male teenagers. None of your typical bleach blond white surfer dudes at all. It was astounding how many of them would just lounge around listening to IPODs, flirting with the ladies and zooming around the beach on their ATVs. Anything but working. There was also a massive epidemics of drownings last years. All black children of course.</p>
<p> - - No doubt.  This is typical Black behavior.  Furthermore, there are no White lifeguards there because there are few Whites left in Brooklyn and the few that are there DO NOT want to work at a place like Coney Island.  It&rsquo;s a dangerous neighborhood - and by dangerous I mean Black.  Which is not racist to say, just true.  I used to be a lifeguard and the few Blacks that I knew fit this stereotype.  They loved to just laze around whenever they could, flirt with the girls - preferably White girls - and act like the HBIC.  They had very little teamwork skills.</p>

		<p>In one of the bygone Summer Olympics, A swimmer named Anthony Nesty, from Suriname, won a gold metal in swimming. At the time, he was hailed as a man who shattered &#8220;myths&#8221; about blacks and swimming. I would say he&rsquo;s more the exception, than the rule.</p>
<p>Blacks do not make good swimmers. Given all of Africa&rsquo;s lakes and rivers therein, that&rsquo;s rather surprising. </p>

<p>Cullen Jones was in the 2008 Summer games.  He was part of the 4x100 relay team that won the Gold.  Surprisingly, the media didn&rsquo;t make a huge racial deal like I thought they would, but he has been showered (no pun intended) with corporate endorsement and sponsorship deals, and was before the Games, because he&rsquo;s black and can hold his own as a competitive speed swimmer.  If he were white, he would have had to accomplish something that could be said to be a reasonable fraction of the resume of Michael Phelps to get that sort of endorsement money.</p>

		<p>Let me tell you about my experience with Blacks and pools. In Roanoke, VA, there are two city pools located purposefully in the projects. One is the &#8220;white&#8221; pool and one is the &#8220;black&#8221; pool. I had the unique terror of managing both pools during two separate years during my college years. At the white pool, we had our drowners, but it was usually a kid who would tread water and get tired, or didn&rsquo;t know how to swim. We jumped in and saved them. The pool was clean. The patrons, although low income, were mostly clean and adhered to the rules. The parents stayed there all day to keep an eye on their kids. </p>
<p>The black pool was completely different. The parents would drop off their kids for the day and leave while the lifeguards/managers weren&rsquo;t looking. They became free babysitters for the parents who already had free food stamps, free housing, free money, and enough to buy drugs and alcohol. The kids they would leave behind were ages 3 to 18. The kids would steal from the register if you weren&rsquo;t careful. The black employee who ran the register wouldn&rsquo;t even show up some days, and when she did, she gave away pool entrance fee money for snacks to the kids. The kids would jump in with their socks on, run around loudmouthed, foul-language, pointing finger guns at each other yelling tity-ot-pop! Tity-ot-pop! Others would be selling drugs. The pool had a constant, nasty, brown goop floating on top from all the oil, jerry curl, weaves, glue, and unwashed bodies. And the lifeguards literally had to jump in every day because none of them could swim well. They all sank or stayed in the shallow end, where they would drown also. Sometimes kids would go off the diving board and &#8220;manage&#8221; to get to the ladder in a head above the water, exhausting, slap the water attempt. We would LITERALLY come into work some mornings and the blacks had jumped the fence that night and held a party&hellip;.we would find watermelon rinds and fried chicken all in the pool. Worst job of my whole life.</p>

		<p>Years ago, when my kids were little, I remember reading that 50% of drownings were of children under the age of 2, and 75% were of children under the age of 3.  Also, most drownings involving people over the age of 14 are alcohol-related.</p>
<p>Black children learn to walk earlier than whites, meaning that they are at risk of leaving the house unnoticed and drowning in a nearby body of water a couple of months earlier than a white child would be.  Black kids, especially the boys, are notoriously impulsive.  Also, the younger the mother is, the more likely a child is to be admitted to the emergency room.  You add these factors together, and it is no surprise that black kids are more likely to drown.  (In my opinion, swimming lessons before the age of 3 1/2 or 4 years old probably do NOT prevent drowning.  The kid learns some skills, but at the same time loses his fear of the water.)</p>
<p>Once you get to the over 14 age group, you are dealing with the fact that blacks &#8220;party harder&#8221; than whites while being less likely to have swimming skills.  Substance abuse by non-swimmers near a body of water is an obvious disaster waiting to happen.</p>

		<p>#1 White nurse, you really slay me!  Your commentary is right on target, yet there is a humorous side that tickles me.  And Oh so true, I find that you and I agree 100% on the wild animal type that most blacks are.  I have found that along with water, blacks are afraid of two more things.  Snakes and jobs.  Once, in Hot Springs AR, my girlfriend and I were taking a scenic drive on a Saturday afternoon.(Hot Springs is her hometown).  We drove by a public swimming pool where she used to go as a child herself.  In the shallow end of the pool, it was absolutely jam-packed with blacks, and most everyone of them was wearing life-preservers!  In the shallow end, no more than 4 foot deep.  No joke, this is true!  We laughed so hard, we had to pull over to the side of the road and there we laughed until our sides ached for about a 1/2 hour.  I told her that no one back home would believe this story.  This article made me think of that day when I believe I laughed the hardest I had ever laughed.  You had to be there to appreciate the sight, I will never forget that hilarious event as along as I live!</p>
