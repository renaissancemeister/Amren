			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert Marquand, Christian Science Monitor, June 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>French organizers of a so-called &#8220;pork sausage and booze&#8221; party in Paris  &mdash;  designed as a deliberate provocation against Muslims  &mdash;  will move it from a heavily Muslim neighborhood to the Arc de Triomphe on Friday.</p>
<p>The group, &#8220;Identity Block,&#8221; called the new venue &#8220;Plan B,&#8221; after Paris police banned their bash this week on grounds of maintaining public order.</p>
<p>Advertised on Facebook and receiving some 7,000 RSVPs, the party is billed as a &#8220;resistance to the Islamization of France.&#8221; It was initially planned to take place next to a mosque in the 18th district after Friday prayers, and on the same day as the English-Algerian World Cup soccer match.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Today, the group sent out a press release, calling upon &#8220;all Parisians .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and French&#8221; to meet at the Arc de Triomphe Friday to eat ham and drink grape juice, fly French flags, protest the police ban, and listen to speeches against &#8220;religious control of public space&#8221; in France  &mdash;  a reference to the majority Arab-Muslim Goutte d&rsquo;Or neighborhood where the sausage and wine party was to be held.</p>
<p>Fadela Amara, a French federal minister of Algerian origin, calls the implicit protest against Muslims &#8220;hateful, racist, and xenophobic.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The plan to hold a pork-and-wine bash in Goutte d&rsquo;Or, where the overcrowded mosque spills into the streets on Fridays, was considered provocative enough to cause a riot. Islam forbids the consumption of pork and alcoholic beverages.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The pork bash and protest is also seen as an example of Facebook&rsquo;s power to quickly mobilize large crowds. The right-wing pork party is a further morphing here of a new fad called &#8220;apéro géant&#8221;  &mdash;  huge binge-drinking parties organized overnight on Facebook. Apéro is short for apéritif, and geant means giant.</p>
<p>French authorities have lately reined in apéro géant after a man fell off a bridge and was killed; an apéro géant aiming at 10,000 drinkers beneath the Eiffel Tower two weeks ago was also banned.</p>
<p>Some conservative media have played the pork party ban as an abridgment of free speech.</p>
<p>Marine Le Pen, deputy leader of the right-wing National Front (FN) party, calls the ban a &#8220;capitulation&#8221; by authorities to Muslims.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Websites associated with the party claim Goutte d&rsquo;Or has become so Islamized that pork is no longer sold there. But French media in recent days have published photos of piles of pork sausages and ham legs in the windows of shops in the Paris neighborhood.<br>

<p>Note the tone of this article.  Such slanted reporting!  Why does it repreatedly refer to the party as a &#8220;bash&#8221;?  They make it sound like an orgy!  A &#8220;binge-drinking&#8221; bacchanal!!!</p>
<p>It is simply a wine and sausage party, that&rsquo;s all.  No big deal.</p>
<p>And &#8220;right-wing&#8221;?  Since when is having a glass of wine or eating a sausage considered &#8220;right-wing&#8221;?   This is, after all, France &hellip; isn&rsquo;t it?  Or it used to be.</p>

		<p>We should bring these pork and booze parties stateside. Anytime the government decides it wants to dump Somalis in some tranquil community, the residents should be protesting with pork and beer. Any time a new mosque in planned somewhere, let&rsquo;s protest with more beer and pork. Oh, and have all the women participants dress-up in bikinis, that&rsquo;ll really rile the Islamicists! </p>

		<p>Okay, Muslims kill over 50 people as a reaction to a Danish cartoon, and that is okay. French people congregate to eat pork and we have a potential hate crime. Muslims make no secret of their desire to conquer the entire world via the spread of Islam, no complaint. French people struggle to maintain a piece of ground, retain their ways and culture, and we have a group of tyrants. Good to know.</p>

		<p>So a pork sausage eating, and wine-drinking gathering of French nationals is seen as &#8220;racist, xenophobic and anti-Islamic&#8221;? What about the Muslim and blacks who torch thousands of cars in Paris&rsquo; suburbs - is that a form of scouts mastering camping skills by building fires?</p>
<p>Speaking for myself, no religion has the right to proscribe what a person may eat or drink. People were eating ham and pork long before Mohammed had his delusions in the desert.</p>

		<p>I may be in the minority here, but I believe we need to take the high road in our struggle.  I don&rsquo;t think we need to insult other cultures or religions.  I wish all Muslims a long and happy life - in their native North African or Middle Eastern countries. </p>
<p>That being stated, it is good to see the French stand up to the invaders.  A great many French are aware of what is at stake if the tide of invasion is not stemmed.</p>
<p>Finally, I think we need to reject the boorish stereotypes of the French the neoconservatives are always yakking about.  French contributions to Western Civilization are significant.  Americans would be well served to put down the TV remote and pick up a Western Civilization textbook.    <br>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>What should be understood here, for those who haven&rsquo;t  seen or experienced it, is that Islam is a very public religion, whereas in the Western tradition, religion  is considered a private matter.  In western culture,  religious rituals are  something you practice in your church or synagogue and in the privacy of your own home, not out in the street.  Not Moslems!  Their religion is very public. They take over the streets.  They stop, lay out their prayer rugs, and pray wherever they  happen to be. There is a basic conflict in these two concepts, about whether religion should be public or private.</p>
<p>I have seen (in Nice) where at noon prayer time, they take over entire streets in the downtown area.  Their prayer rugs are laid out everywhere. You simply can&rsquo;t get through!  It&rsquo;s really annoying.   Why should everyone else be inconvenienced?  </p>
<p>We&rsquo;re inclined to say: &#8220;Take it indoors and do your praying at home!&#8221;  But that&rsquo;s not Islam. That&rsquo;s not their culture.  They come from countries where Islam is dominant and gets its way.  They are not used to being minorities.  For them, all other interests must defer  to Islam.</p>

		<p>Good for the French.  One hopes they&rsquo;ve seasoned their sausage with some testosterone   &mdash;   hold the Grey Poupon.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s perfectly intuitive to ask:  If Muslims feel &#8220;oppressed&#8221; in Western countries, why do they continue to move those very countries?  Could it be that they have a less than friendly ulterior motive?  Say, why don&rsquo;t more Americans harbor such a wicked question?</p>

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t call this display of fortitude on the part of the French &#8220;atypical&#8221;.  If they&rsquo;ve shown a lot of apathy when it comes to the repopulation of their country into Francistan, it is likely because they have been bought off with the same &#8220;bread and circuses&#8221; as most white Americans, who think a huge influx of Somalis is just fine so long as their favorite team wins the Superbowl.  Even their military reputation took an undeserved blow in 1940; the Armee de l&rsquo;Air was outnumbered 3:1 by the Luftwaffe, and we&rsquo;ve seen pretty graphic examples of how such air superiority impacts land battles in 1944, 1991 and 2003.<br>

<p>In Windsor England, a couple miles from Windsor Castle the muslims rent a tiny storefront on a narrow side street.  That street is a direct route from the local high school to the main street where the students catch their buses.</p>
<p>The muslims spread out their prayer rugs every afternoon as school gets out and totally block the street as a way of showing their power over the people who want to get to the bus route.</p>

<p>To #14 ghw - Tell me it ain&rsquo;t so! I spent some time on the French Riviera in the 60&rsquo;s. I had a boyfriend whose family owned a small hotel in St. Paul de Vence. We went frequently to Nice to shop and not a Muslim to be seen, just White people. </p>
<p>Truthfully, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to go back now. It would be too depressing. Nor would I want to go back to Spain where they made the stupid decision a couple of years back to allow in Cubans who could prove they had a great-grandfather that was Spanish.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no fun getting old, but in a way it&rsquo;s a blessing because I won&rsquo;t live to see the total destruction of the West. God knows if and when the European peoples will ever come to their senses.    <br>

<p>France during the 60&rsquo;s must have been another world.  As was Britain and all the rest of Europe, for that matter.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m afraid it is so, now.  North Africans are everywhere.  In fact, the above scene I described occurs in the streets  all around the Nice cathedral, of all places!  I don&rsquo;t know if this is intentional or merely by accident, but (as someone said above) they totally block the streets as a way of displaying their numbers and power. </p>
<p>PS. St.Paul de Vence -  a very tiny town, as you know - is still elegant, arty, very expensive,  a second home for rich Parisiens; and I didn&rsquo;t see anyone but wealthy Frenchmen and foreign tourists.  Much too expensive for Africans.<br>
So far.</p>

		<p>I appreciate Mr. Marlow&rsquo;s comments about the French and the neo-cons. It&rsquo; so tedious to hear over and over again about the &#8220;surrender monkies&#8221;. I&rsquo;m glad to read that people-some people,anyway-in Europe are starting to stand up against the spread of Islamic and non-European &#8220;imperialism&#8221;. As Europe goes, so goes America. If we do not stick together, then we will all hang separately.</p>
