			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Will Connors, Wall Street Journal, June 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This World Cup will be the first on African soil, and there are more African teams here than have been at any other World Cup. But that Algeria&rsquo;s Rabah Saadane is the only African manager at the tournament has provoked not a little hand-wringing among Africa&rsquo;s soccer-obsessed fans. They fear that foreign coaches, who are frequently brought in at the last minute and are unfamiliar with a team&rsquo;s players, may actually hamper their countries&rsquo; chances at the World Cup. (No team has won a World Cup with a foreign coach.)</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people [in Africa] still have that mentality that the European knows more,&#8221; said Thomas Mlambo, a well-known TV presenter and analyst on the South Africa-based sports network SuperSport.</p>
<p>Host South Africa is coached by Brazilian Carlos Alberto Parreira, who won a World Cup coaching his country in 1994. Ivory Coast is using a Swedish coach, Sven-GÃ¶ran Eriksson, who coached England in two World Cups but never got past the quarterfinals. Nigeria hired Swede Lars Lagerback, who coached his country in the 2006 Cup but failed as head coach to qualify Sweden this year.</p>
<p>Neither the coach of Cameroon (Paul Le Guen, from France) nor Ghana (Milovan Rajevac, from Serbia) has any World Cup coaching experience. Representatives for the teams were unavailable to comment on their coaching selections.</p>
<p>{snip}<br>
African coaches working in their countries&rsquo; national leagues, often with shoddy infrastructure and little money to lure top talent, are at a big disadvantage to their Western counterparts. With national prestige riding on one&rsquo;s team, African soccer authorities tend to play it safe.</p>
<p>{snip}<br>
 <br>
Some fans maintain that coaches of the African teams  &mdash;  which have a few white players total, all on the South African squad  &mdash;  face an unusual racial barrier. &#8220;The players have more respect for whites,&#8221; says Bienvenue Kehedi, a 26 year-old student in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. &#8220;An Ivorian can&rsquo;t assert their will against the players because he tries to keep on the side of all the players and is scared of taking tough decisions.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I have no respect for Whites who do anything to help blacks. </p>
<p>Any effort made by a White to elevate or train the blacks is effort stolen from the White Race.</p>
<p>Every time I meet or see an articulate, educated black, I think of all the dispossessed and degraded Whites whose misery made his privilege possible.  Everything blacks have, elite Whites stole for more deserving Whites.</p>
<p>This American Republic will not stand much longer. It was created for Whites by Whites, and as soon as the blacks were given the vote, a sequence was set in motion that  will end in total collapse.   </p>
<p>This White Republic requires White Leaders of the real kind to keep it. When we lost those, we started losing our Republic. We will see the end of American History in our lifetimes.</p>

<p>And that is of course stupid, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>They had black trainer, and they had white trainer. And what they saw is that they have more success with white trainer. The logical consequence is to favor white trainers.</p>
<p>What, White trainer more successful? That mus have to do with white racism!</p>

		<p>Last night I flipped through the channels and watched the beginning of that with the &#8220;stars&#8221; that was comprised of ONLY BLACK &#8220;singers&#8221; and that Chakita(sp?), the one who lectured us on the Arizona immigration law, and a group of MEXICAN singers from Mexico!  NOT ONE WHITE group from the USA or anywhere else! Oh, and Desmond Tutu and Mandela made an appearance!  The crowd went wild! Oh and the Whites in the audience clapping and screaming for them all! ALL the music and groups were nothing but screaming and grunting out words that no one could understand and went on FOREVER! It could have been the BET Awards show.</p>

		<p>This article sounds like one in which the writer was given the assignment to write about white coaches for African teams.  Of course, in any mainstream Western medium PC must be observed, so the author has to come up with declarations that somehow deflect the obvious conclusions: &#8220;last-minute&#8221; hires may hamper the teams&rsquo; prospects; little money and shoddy infrastructures are the real problems.  So, if the African teams lose, it will STILL be the white man&rsquo;s fault.  In this case, I suppose the white coaches will actually be blamed, and liberals will bemoan that the Africans would have won if only they had had black coaches!  But, due to a longlasting colonial mentality, the blacks didn&rsquo;t think they could win without a white man at the helm.  Hmmmm&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Actually, Africans are lucky. I just saw the Nigerian side and they are 100% black. Same for the Ivory Coast and the starters for South Africa. So Africans can watch their national team and feel that it represents them (even if African teams are awful). </p>
<p>Same with Asians and the Korean sides. Yet the &#8220;French&#8221; team started 7 blacks and 4 whites. So a Frenchman has to see his team represent Africa, not France.</p>
<p>Even England and Germany have several blacks on their team. Only the eastern European teams, Spain, Greece and Italy have all white sides. Uruguay and Argentina are also mostly white.</p>
<p>Perhaps the WSJ can run an article titled, &#8220;Shouldn&rsquo;t Europeans Play for Europe?&#8221;</p>

		<p>The  reason why  white  coaches are  often  chosen  to coach  African  national  teams  is obvious to  many  Africans. These  coaches  &mdash;  usually  over-the-hill, safari junketeering  types  &mdash;  are  chosen at  great  expense  because they  are  seen  as  a  conduit  whereby  promising  African  players  could  be  introduced to  European  professional clubs  for  trials. These  European  coaches all  belong  to  a  network  of  clubs and  recommend  players to  other  managers, etc. The   coaches last  for  a  couple  of  years and  then released  for  lack of  success  &mdash;  but with  their  bank  accounts  flush  with  cash.</p>
<p>The  reason why  the  French and  English  teams have  a  disproportionate  number  of  black  players is  the same  reason  that  the  American  NBA and  NFL  teams  carry  many  black  players.  Rightly  or  wrongly, black  soccer  players  in France  and  Britain  are  seen  as  better  on  average.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Host South Africa is coached by Brazilian Carlos Alberto Parreira&#8221;</p>
<p>He is Brazilian and therefore not white.  The Algerian coach is Arab and cannot really be counted as black African.</p>
