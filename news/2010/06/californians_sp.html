			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Seema Mehta, Los Angeles Times, May 31, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>California voters are closely divided over the crackdown on illegal immigration in Arizona, with sharp splits along lines of ethnicity and age, according to a new Los Angeles Times/USC poll.</p>
<p>Overall, 50% of registered voters surveyed said they support the law, which compels police to check the immigration status of those they suspect are in the country illegally, while 43% oppose it. That level of support is lower than polls have indicated nationwide.</p>
<p>But attitudes among the state&rsquo;s voters are not uniform. Strong majorities of white voters and those over 50 support the Arizona law, while Latinos and those under 30 are heavily opposed.</p>
<p>Arizona&rsquo;s adoption of the law in April stirred passions and protests across the nation, with cities including Los Angeles voting to boycott the state. The matter has turned into a pressure point in electoral battles, including the Republican gubernatorial primary in California. But the poll shows that most voters, even those with ardent feelings about the measure, said they were unlikely to reject candidates based solely on their immigration stances.</p>
<p>Those who oppose the law were more likely to say they would only support a candidate who agreed with them on that issue, with 1 in 3 making the Arizona law a litmus test for their vote. Supporters of the Arizona law were more likely to say they were voting on other issues.</p>
<p>Gina Bonecutter, 39, a Republican and fervent supporter of the Arizona measure, said she was frustrated by what she sees as unwillingness by recent immigrants to acclimate to American culture. The Laguna Hills mother and part-time educational therapist said large numbers of illegal immigrants are hurting public schools, one of the reasons she placed her four children in private school.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I&rsquo;m seeing today is immigrants coming here, wanting us to become like Mexico, instead of wanting to become American,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That&rsquo;s never going to work.&#8221;</p>
<p>But in the GOP primary, Bonecutter is supporting Meg Whitman, who opposes the Arizona law, instead of Steve Poizner, who supports it. Poizner has made his support of the law a defining issue in the race, but among his supporters only 9% said they chose the candidate because of his immigration stance.</p>
<p>With the state&rsquo;s finances in dire straits, Bonecutter said Whitman&rsquo;s business background is more important.</p>
<p>On the other side of the issue, Daisy Vidal, 23, of Banning said Arizona&rsquo;s law will lead to racial profiling and she would never vote for a politician who supported it. A registered Democrat, Vidal is a first-generation American, born after her family immigrated to the United States legally in the mid-1980s.</p>
<p>&#8220;There should be some type of pathway to citizenship,&#8221; said the Cal State San Bernardino student. &#8220;This whole country was started by immigrants.&#8221;</p>
<p>The survey of 1,506 registered voters was conducted between May 19 and 26 for The Times and the University of Southern California College of Letters, Arts and Sciences by the Democratic polling firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner and the Republican firm American Viewpoint. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 2.6 percentage points for the overall sample and slightly larger for smaller breakdowns.</p>

		<p>The poll misrepresented SB 1070 in its polling efforts, suggesting that AZ LEOs were required to accost someone who appeared to be here illegally.  The reality is that another legal above-board accost has to happen first, and if the LEO thinks the person is here illegally, all the while not using race as grounds for suspicion, then SB 1070 can kick in.</p>
<p>But even with the (deliberate?) misrepresentation, there is more overall support than overall opposition, and also more strong support than strong opposition.</p>

		<p>Whites are getting out wake up call from Arizona.  This time, more of us will wake up than ever. </p>
<p>Those who are demeaning the White hopes of a protected border and deported illegals don&rsquo;t want any mention of crime.  White are awake enough to understand that non whites equal crime and potential political domination of Whites by non whites through amnesty and the vote. </p>
<p>The precarious financial status of the country and out of work Whites makes us inclined toward intolerance of non white privileges.   God is speaking to us through Race and Nation.</p>

		<p>Amazing how hard it can be to find exactly what white people think about an issue like this!  After digging all over the net, I found where the LA Independent states &#8220;nearly 6 in 10&#8221; whites approve of the bill.</p>

		<p>The major fault line in America is along race. We have come to the point in time in America when states with differing racial compositions are threatening each other with very serious economic sanctions. It will only get worse from here on in.</p>
<p>How will Native Born White Americans react to the very real possibility of losing a large amounts of territory to colonizers from China,Mexico,Iran,Pakistan and other nonwhite nations? I wouldn&rsquo;t rule out the very  real possibilty that this will provoke a very strong reaction among Native Born White Americans&hellip;.don&rsquo;t rule out the possibility that a large population of Native born White Americans getting  funny thoughts in their heads about repelling the invasion.</p>
<p>At a certain point in time, the Republican-Democratic beltway consensus will have absolutetly no legitimacy.</p>

<p>Every country on earth was &#8220;started by immigrants&#8221; at some point in history. That is irrelevant. Once a nation and its&rsquo; culture is established, borders drawn etc., you can&rsquo;t keep importing more people. That is just common sense. I&rsquo;m sick of this silly idealism.<br>

		<p>If strong majorities of Whites support the crackdown in AZ then maybe there&rsquo;s hope for California since the White electorate is still 66 percent of all voters in the state although probably not for too much longer.  </p>

		<p>Liberalism feeds off of delusion and lies. </p>
<p>We need to get into the schools and teach the true history of <br>
immigration into the USA. It was never a free-for-all. It was<br>
highly discriminatory on the base of race. Above all everyone<br>
in California needs to have their paycheck marked clearly with amount deducted  for the cost<br>
of illegal immigration, students need to see their tuition raised, and white liberals need to see their property taxes raised..and the reason for the raise precisely explained. Tell the truth and liberalism goes away<br>

		<p>How convenient.</p>
<p>Because the original poll showed that 90% of the population of LA was on arizona&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>When the polls don&rsquo;t show what you want, poll again and then make up the numbers to suit your agenda.</p>
<p>I would say it&rsquo;s too late for that though.  There is STRONG consensus among all groups in the US, of all races, political idealogies etc. in support of arizona.</p>
<p>Whenever there are demonstrations against this ONLY mestizos show up.</p>

		<p>The earlier poster was right.  I became more &#8216;racist&rsquo; against non-whites, especially blacks and hispanics, when I learned more about them, studied parts of history I wasn&rsquo;t taught in school, a multicultural class in college, Tim Wise columns I came across rubbed me wrong quickly (even though I was being a good little &#8216;anti-racist&rsquo; white person), and the Trent Lott thing really sparked me.  American Renaissance came way, too, back in December 2002 and it snapped me out of the self-hating trance I was in.</p>

<p>You are right on the money!!! But there is an obvious question that needs to be asked. How does it currently get paid for? One is obvious the national dept is raised. The other not so obvious is that the money supply is increased, just printed, which devalues the money. </p>
<p>This is why I have said in the past here that we have to stop seeing the Federal Reserve system as a separate issue from immigration, and any other that increases dept for that matter. If we don&rsquo;t face the Federal Reserve issue we won&rsquo;t solve the immigration issue.   </p>

		<p>If and when Native Born White Americans become an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America, the post-1965 nonwhite majority will implement a race-based national origins immigration policy that will exclude Europeans. It will be an immigration policy  whose intended consequence is to make the current Native Born White American majority a very small racial minority permanently. There will be no silly liberal sentiments about America being a nation &#8220;started by immigrants.&#8221; For post-1965 nonwhites it is all about race. Post-1965 nonwhites are demanding that the Native Born White  American Majority commit racial suicide within the borders of America. They are under no obligation to do this.</p>

		<p>With the state&rsquo;s finances in dire straits, Bonecutter said Whitman&rsquo;s business background is more important.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not good enough Bonecutter!  It was BUSINESSES willing to flood the country with illegal immigrants willing to accept slave wages that undermined our economy, ruined our schools, and increased crime exponentially.  Another liberal stalking horse - the sense that businessmen can save our nation based on it&rsquo;s economic problems.  This country&rsquo;s economic problems are a RESULT of diversity and minorities and pandering to them be it blacks or mestizos here, or Chinese and Asian outsourcing.  At least it was.  NOW we have a President (not coincidentally a mulatto who is INTENTIONALLY ruining our national economy in order to bring it into the World Socialist Order.  How is he doing that?  One way is flooding our nation even more with mestizos and blacks.  So, Ms Bonecutter, voting against immigration and FOR candidates willing to reverse it all actually SAVES the economy and puts it back on it&rsquo;s feet.</p>

		<p>Polls are nonsense whipped up to influence public opinion.  I would be willing to bet that most Whites in California are in favor of cracking down on illegals, especially with the economy suffering and the state teetering on bankruptcy.  I&rsquo;ve been to Los Angeles once and that was enough to do me for a lifetime.  It&rsquo;s not the hip trendy future city portrayed by Hollywood with blonde bronze bodies on the beach and swanky outdoor cafes.  It&rsquo;s Latin America at its worst with neighborhoods that are eerily like the clapboard shacks you see across the border in AZ complete with chicken coupes, grafitti and barred doors and windows.  </p>
