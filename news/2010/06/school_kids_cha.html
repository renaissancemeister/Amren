	<p>School children are led by a teacher in a chant that begins with &#8220;I will be anything I want to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>At one point during the incantation the teacher asks the students to repeat the phrase &#8220;I am an Obama scholar.&#8221;</p>

		<p>They aren&rsquo;t really Obama scholars, and I can prove it:  Real Obama scholars would have said, &#8220;I is an Obama scholar.&#8221;</p>
<p>All kidding aside, we were told that the Obama effect would mean they&rsquo;d all hit the books and stop committing crime.  (Belied by the AR news item today from Cincinnati).  Yet, these young gentlemen of pretty much the same color as Barack H. Obama II still &#8220;strive&#8221; to be something important, instead of actually being something important.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, we could use a few good geologists and petrochemical engineers right about now.</p>

		<p>These students are excellent Obama scholars! They&rsquo;ve already mastered the art of parroting words spouted out at them. Now, if we could just teach them how to chant what they read off a telepromter (which, unfortunately for over half of them, requires literacy), they too can be president!</p>

		<p>Chanting your way to &#8220;education.&#8221; Grotesquely idiotic! The liberals couldn&rsquo;t have done more to make these minority races more uneducated and inept if they had tried!  Maybe that&rsquo;s the thinking behind it!  Look at all the black people pushed beyond their abilities by affirmative action,instead of working to become really competent at whatever level Nature has put them at.  Like our beloved esteemed Attorney General, Eric Hold&rsquo;em.  He might have been a decent everyday lawyer, or businessman, but he is now the AG and probably,with apologies to Alberto Gonzalez,the most inept incompetent AG we ever had! </p>

		<p> &#8220;Obama scholars&#8221; that is an oxymoron if I have ever heard one. I have noticed something about black kids. If you ask any young black kids want they want to be when they grow up the answer is usually along the lines of &#8221; I want to be a rapper,basketball player,football player ect&hellip; Ask a white kid same question and I hear &#8220;doctor,lawyer,engineer,cop,president&#8221; funny how our kids have realistic aims but the others want only dreams</p>

		<p>In addition to the &#8220;Obama Scholar&#8221; line, there is the sticky sweet, saccharine concept that one can &#8220;be anything one desires&#8221; simply by &#8220;believing&#8221; that one can. </p>
<p>Goodbye aptitude testing! Who needs something old-fashioned like aptitude when one can be anything just by believing in it? </p>
<p>This is the &#8220;positive thinking&#8221; drivel that passes for education in some of the schools, especially black schools. Rather than encouraging students to find out what they&rsquo;re best suited for and to make a backup plan in case that fails, they are told they can be anything they set their mind to. </p>
<p>I can assure you that someone with an IQ of 70 is never going to be a nuclear physicist, no matter how many affirmations they chant, any more than I&rsquo;m going to have the money of Bill Gates just by thinking positively about money rolling into my bank account.</p>

		<p>What is an Obama Scholar? Since his academic records are sealed by an Executive Order by Obama himself, how do we know what an Obama scholar is. In fact a lot of his history is shrouded in mystery. This is nothing but feel good talk that will be backed up by no action. &#8220;I said it, I did it, now gibs me dat, I&rsquo;s a&rsquo;Bama scholar.&#8221; Let&rsquo;s check back next year and check out the progress of our new found scholars. </p>

		<p>Notice this &#8220;classroom&#8221; has more adults than students. I am sure most of them are black muslims, probably former inmates who are now picking up a nice paycheck from the state as &#8220;community activists&#8221; or &#8220;motivational speakers&#8221; for standing around doing nothing, but looking tough, maybe leading a chant now and then.</p>

		<p>There is nothing wrong with positive thinking, so long as it is backed up by sincere, concentrated efforts to put the thoughts into action.  I just hope the students and teachers realize that. I didn&rsquo;t watch the video, but&hellip;what exactly is an Obama scholar, anyhow?  Should I be chanting that I am a Ron Paul scholar?  A Pat Buchanan scholar?  </p>
<p>Also, if you&rsquo;re interested in the Obamas&rsquo; academic background, read Ann Coulter&rsquo;s Guilty.  She explains how Michelle Obama&rsquo;s thesis focused on being black in academia.  (What a novel topic!)</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve complained for years about students being told they can be anything they want to be.  As other commenters here have noted, such illogic gives young people the idea of entitlement and, failing their goals, the notion that someone must be responsible.  And we all know who gets the blame.  <br>
Young white people are willing to admit that they&rsquo;re not smart enough or specifically skilled enough to perform certain jobs, but too many blacks, with their magical thinking, believe simply wanting might make it so.  Liberal whites apparently don&rsquo;t understand that ghetto youths can&rsquo;t analyze be-anything-you-want sentiments.  Just look at the slack-jawed, stoop-shouldered posture of some of the guys in the above video.  It speaks volumes, as they say.</p>

		<p>  I&rsquo;m not sure what these children mean by &#8220;Obama scholar&#8221; Is our president personally paying for their education through a charitable foundation, or are taxpayers paying? If our college professor president is offering middle school scholarships, I  haven&rsquo;t heard about it. President Obama did give a pep talk to students months ago. Maybe, this applies to that talk?  </p>

		<p>The use of the word incantation hit it right on the head.  To blacks, education is white man&rsquo;s magic, and if they just say the right words, they will be able to use it as well.  As far as their ever obtaining a real (as opposed to magic) education, the chances are pretty much nil; they simply do not have the mental capacity.  They are going to be a burden on our society for as long as they remain here.</p>

		<p>Sure any of them can be a doctor or lawyer or president&hellip; This reminds me of another recent story some of the worst schools in Detroit were closing and one of the black students lamented that he had big plans and many of the students there hoped to go to Harvard!</p>
<p>Why do teachers lie to students? Very few of them can be &#8220;anything they want to be&#8221; most of them if they have a job will end up doing some kind of boring menial labor. It is no wonder blacks hate whites so much when we lie to them and tell them they can do anything when in reality their abilities are quite limited.</p>
<p>Unfortunately as standards lower more and more of these uneducated violent youths will become judges, doctors and politicians but that is not something we should look forward to.</p>

		<p>With 3 grandchildren age 15 to 6 I have spent a lot of time in the children&rsquo;s departments of big chain bookstores such as Barnes&Noble; and Borders over the last 12 years.</p>
<p>Within a week of Obama&rsquo;s inaugral the children&rsquo;s sections were inundated with pictures and books about Obama.  I had never seen such books during any other administration going back to when my children were young. There are more of them every month.</p>
<p>It is all very remniscent of &#8220;Father&#8221; Lenin in Russia and Mao in China.  And of course big brother in Brave New World.</p>

		<p>Since black schools receive more money than White ones, I would think it wouldn&rsquo;t be in their best interests if black children started improving because they could no longer justify the extra funding.  I believe that Whites are smarter than blacks but I also think blacks don&rsquo;t really try as hard as they could and that maybe the school administration hampers the process with low standards and low expectations like the pointless exercise in this video.   <br>

		<p>Perhaps it is best if black teachers and students were just left alone to figure it out for themselves. At least these people, on their own, seem motivated and disinclined to blame white folks for failure should it come their way. People achieve to the level personality allows. <br>
The longer I have lived the more inclined I am to accept &#8220;stereotypical descriptions&#8221; as pretty much accurate. Yesterday I saw a video of a couple of black females duking it out with a uniformed Seattle policeman when he attempted to tag one of them for jaywalking. Eventually the cop punched a girl because he simply could not get cooperation; they were pushing back and screaming bloody murder. As the scene played out I thought how difficult it would be to imagine a white or Asian girl flipping out this way.<br>
Even worse - for Seattle race relations - is the fact that this kind of public display comes on the heels of a recent massacre of four police officers in a doughnut shop by some black thug. Imagine how stupid these black girls were to tangle with this in the background.</p>
