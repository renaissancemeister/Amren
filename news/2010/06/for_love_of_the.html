	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It happened at a junior varsity girls&rsquo; softball game in Indianapolis this spring. After an inning and a half, Roncalli was womanhandling inner-city Marshall Community. Marshall pitchers had already walked nine Roncalli batters. The game could&rsquo;ve been 50-0 with no problem.</p>
<p>Yes, a team that hadn&rsquo;t lost a game in 21⁄2 years, a team that was going to win in a landslide purposely offered to declare defeat. Why? Because Roncalli wanted to spend the two hours teaching the Marshall girls how to get better, not how to get humiliated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no wonder. This was the first softball game in Marshall history. A middle school trying to move up to include grades 6 through 12, Marshall showed up to the game with five balls, two bats, no helmets, no sliding pads, no cleats, 16 players who&rsquo;d never played before, and a coach who&rsquo;d never even seen a game.</p>
<p>One Marshall player asked, &#8220;Which one is first base?&#8221; Another: &#8220;How do I hold this bat?&#8221; They didn&rsquo;t know where to stand in the batter&rsquo;s box. Their coaches had to be shown where the first- and third-base coaching boxes were.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when Roncalli did something crazy. It offered to forfeit.</p>
<p>Yes, a team that hadn&rsquo;t lost a game in 21⁄2 years, a team that was going to win in a landslide purposely offered to declare defeat. Why? Because Roncalli wanted to spend the two hours teaching the Marshall girls how to get better, not how to get humiliated.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Marshall players did NOT want to quit,&#8221; wrote Roncalli JV coach Jeff Traylor, in recalling the incident. &#8220;They were willing to lose 100 to 0 if it meant they finished their first game.&#8221; But the Marshall players finally decided if Roncalli was willing to forfeit for them, they should do it for themselves. They decided that maybe  &mdash;  this one time  &mdash;  losing was actually winning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about when the weirdest scene broke out all over the field: Roncalli kids teaching Marshall kids the right batting stance, throwing them soft-toss in the outfield, teaching them how to play catch. They showed them how to put on catching gear, how to pitch, and how to run the bases. Even the umps stuck around to watch.</p>
<p>&#8220;One at a time the Marshall girls would come in to hit off of the [Roncalli] pitchers,&#8221; Traylor recalled. &#8220;As they hit the ball their faces LIT UP! They were high fiving and hugging the girls from Roncalli, thanking them for teaching to them the game.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the kind of thing that can backfire with teenagers  &mdash;  the rich kids taking pity on the inner-city kids kind of thing. Traylor was afraid of it, too.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Roncalli wasn&rsquo;t done. Traylor asked all the parents of his players and anybody else he knew for more help for Marshall  &mdash;  used bats, gloves, helmets, money for cleats, gloves, sliders, socks and team shirts. They came up with $2,500 and worked with Marshall on the best way to help the program with that money. Roncalli also connected Marshall with former Bishop Chatard coach Kim Wright, who will advise the program.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And that was just the appetizer. A rep from Reebok called Sullivan and said, &#8220;What do you need? We&rsquo;ll get it for you.&#8221; A man who owns an indoor batting cage facility has offered free time in the winter. The Cincinnati Reds are donating good dirt for the new field Marshall will play on.</p>

		<p>Reminds me of the first lesson my extremely liberal father taught me. He had bought me a six foot styrofoam surfboard for the local pool. I must have been five or six. <br>
 What I remember most of all more than 45 years on about that day is how I would stick my hand out to the end of it to keep it from  being scuffed by the pool gunite when I swam with it back to the edge of the pool. <br>
  Then a kid asked me in front of my Dad if he could &#8220;borrow&#8221; it. I stammered hoping my Dad would intervene. Well, he did. He cajoled me into sharing it. I watched the kid carry it under his arm over to the water. He then placed in gingerly in the water by the deep end. So far so good. THEN!, he ran back to get a running start and cannonballed  on top of it like it was a direct hit from Bismarck onto H.M.S. Hood. Seconds later the boy brought the two broken halves over and told me, &#8220;It broke!&#8221; He then tottered off and was absorbed in some other activity while I gawked at my five minute old broken toy.<br>
  My Dad told me he was &#8220;proud of me&#8221; for sharing. That gave me some comfort until years after he died I started to question his values among other things. Looking back I wish I could have been proud of him that day instead if he had told the boy, &#8220;Sorry! It`s brand new and I just bought it for my son&#8221;&hellip;</p>

		<p>As soon as I saw the photo above of the Roncalli team I knew.  All White girls.  What does that mean?  Well it means (usually) White guilt complex fostered by media conditioning.  Especially girls.  Can you imagine an inner city group of Blacks &#8220;helping&#8221; an all-White team to play Basketball and forfeiting a game to let the Whites win?</p>
<p>I could picture the inner-city Blacks taunting and intimidating a lesser skilled White team.  I could picture the Blacks playing unnecessarily rough and Black referees letting the Blacks get away with it.  I could envision a hostile Black crowd yelling obscenities at the Whites.  I could envision a fight started by an attack of a Black player on a White one without provocation. The last thing the Blacks would adopt is a &#8220;Good Samaritan attitude with respect to the Whites.  The Blacks would be brimming with hostility, supported by any Black referees, coaches, and so-called &#8220;fans&#8221;.  And any attempt on the part of the Whites at merely self-defense would be viewed as &#8220;Racism&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time we all helped our fellow Whites to wake up.</p>

		<p>More feeeel good cheese from the Death Star of Sports, ESPN. I hate ESPN more than any other organ of the MSM, because I am a fan of sport.</p>
<p>This network ran Rush out on a rail for the blatantly obvious McNabb thing, churns non-stop articles and stories crying racism over every little thing, shuts everything down for Jackie Robinson and every other minority that had some tenuous &#8220;first&#8221; in sports, even buries stories if it doesn&rsquo;t conform to the egalitarian creed.</p>
<p>Most annoyingly of all, the self-proclaimed &#8220;Worldwide Leader&#8221; hires talentless black after talentless black to give play-by-play and color commentary, letting truly talented white broadcasters to rot on local AM stations. </p>

Self deceptive altruism strikes again. It must be a gender thing in which younger white females are particurly succeptible.</p>
<p>Their mindset: Don&rsquo;t want to show dominance in any way because we are white and that would be racist. Think of the other teams feelings- feelings- feelings.</p>
<p>They would not have chosen to forfeit if the other team was caucasian like themselves,-for any reason. </p>
<p> Maybe subconciously, the Roncalli team recognized the opposing teams inherent inferiority, needing the benevolent assistance of their genetic superiors. </p>
<p>Hmmmm&hellip;wouldn&rsquo;t that at least make those girls racially concious?</p>
<p>Bad decision young ladies!</p>

		<p>Offers an interesting parallel with American Whites who are forfeiting there very existence, their own country, and their own resources to the very troubled minority races.  Pretty soon it will be 2 outs 2 strikes with no one on base in the bottom of the 9th for American Whites, in the &#8220;game&#8221; of controlling the U.S.A. </p>

<p>Seen a softball game once where one team was behind 27-0 after the first half of the first inning. Was not that unusual</p>
<p>And a lot of these leagues, no matter where they are, have rules about if one team is so far ahead after so many innings, the game is called. </p>

		<p>Honestly, this is sickening. First, the Marshall time should have forfeited the game for being unprepared. But beyond that, the Roncalli team should have just plowed along and won 100-0. THAT is the great motivator to an beaten opponent - do not let this happen again. Watch what the winning team does. A winning team does not forfeit and help the losers. They should fire the coaches. Of course, the idiots at the Marshall team are too stupid to see this - if they had any pride they would have refused to allow a forfeit and played on.  </p>
<p>From the article: &#8220;One Marshall player asked, &ldquo;Which one is first base?&rdquo; Another: &ldquo;How do I hold this bat?&rdquo; They didn&rsquo;t know where to stand in the batter&rsquo;s box. Their coaches had to be shown where the first- and third-base coaching boxes were.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not at all.  Misdirected altruism is one of the fundamental causes of white dispossession.  Altruism is only for the in group, only for people who will reciprocate.  Do you think this black school would lift a finger to help whites if the roles were reversed?</p>

		<p>Girls of Roncalli,</p>
<p>I congratulate you on your Christ like behavior but PLEEEASE don&rsquo;t get involved in &#8220;bringing baseball back to the inner city&#8221;. They rejected it because baseball requires one to have an attention span of more than 5 minutes and that goes for the spectators as well as the players. <br>
I hope parents have the good sense not to expose you to the obvious hazards such as beatings, rape and possible death.<br>

		<p>Tim McHugh, #3, is totally right-on. </p>
<p>I think that kids must be taught how NOT to be taken advantage of! This &#8220;sharing&#8221; malarkey  &mdash;  it is a wimping-out, and being stupid about human nature.</p>
<p>I am past 50, and have evolved a battery of strategies to PREVENT sharing in a diplomatic way. This &#8220;sharing&#8221; thing is so engrained in our society, to free oneself from it is an act of enlightenment. Even adults expect you to &#8220;share.&#8221;</p>
<p>But about this softball thing  &mdash;  it is my experience that blacks do not want any of this sort of charity. They do not offer it, nor do they want it. It has a creepy feel to it, a weird sense of obligation.</p>
<p>Even in a football game where a team is winning by four touchdowns or so, they do not let up. You never know what will happen.</p>
<p>Perhaps these white girls believe that for every drop of rain that falls, a flower grows. Perhaps they want to teach the world to sing in perfect hamony, as they drink their carbonated beverages. Apple trees and honey bees and snow white turtle doves. Woodstock with nine bases. St. Francis with a baseball glove; Mother Tesesa with a bat. So holy!</p>
<p>The cult of self-sacrifice is everywhere. It turns real humans into smug, soft-edged, insipid ghosts.</p>

		<p>What a wonderful propaganda piece for ESPN and the MSM.  I have no doubt it happened, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be a stretch for a &#8220;feel-good&#8221; story like this to be completely concocted by our beloved liberals.</p>
<p>This story no doubt brings a tear to thousands of liberal eyes.  But, as usual, those eyes are blind to reality.  Off the playing field where these girls were so generous reality will set in.  In areas such as the wrong shopping mall or bus one or two of these Samaritans will be surrounded by the other &#8220;team.&#8221;  AMREN has posted stories in the past on what happens next.   </p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t believe they are going to all the trouble of all the donations. If any of these girls were even remotely interested in the game, baseball is broadcast for free on a near nightly basis for 8 months of the year, picking up the basic rules would not exactly be difficult. Not bothering to look up the rules in an encyclopedia shows an unfathomable degree of laziness and malaise.</p>
<p>I would bet any amount of money this &#8220;team&#8221; is just some sort of cash cow for the &#8220;coaches&#8221; who draw a salary or get some kind of financial incentive for their hard &#8220;work&#8221;.<br>

		<p>The problem is that every member of the Roncalli team likely put in countless hours of dedication, practice and sacrifices in other areas of their personal lives to gain that kind of ability. Then everyone gives of the fruit of their own time, talent, and resources to make &#8220;equals&#8221; out of a team who has, until that day, made no effort whatsoever. More and more it&rsquo;s people honking for what they &#8220;want&#8221; even though it is in no way what they &#8220;deserve&#8221;. </p>

		<p>   I KNEW I SMELLED SOMETHING IN THE WOODPILE!  Anytime there&rsquo;s a liberal feel-good story about how the races are so happy together&hellip;.. (que the Hillside Singers: &#8220;I&rsquo;d like to teach the world to sing, in perfect harmony&hellip;&#8221;)&hellip;.. CHECK THE FACTS!</p>
<p>    &#8220;Yes, a team that hadn&rsquo;t lost a game in 21⁄2 years&#8221;</p>
<p>     WRONG! According to their website, the team is mediocre at best.  That &#8220;game&#8221; was on April 14.  The next loss by Roncalli was the following day.  They&rsquo;ve lost seven games so far this year.  It is the Varsity team that hasn&rsquo;t lost in 2-1/2 years.  The claim that the Freshman Team is so wonderful is an outright lie and a low-life attempt to gild the lily.  </p>
<p>    &#8220;That&rsquo;s when Roncalli did something crazy. It offered to forfeit.&#8221;  &#8220;..a team that was going to win in a landslide purposely offered to declare defeat.&#8221;  </p>
<p>     WRONG: According to the Roncalli Coach&rsquo;s letter which is posted on their website, they (Roncalli Coach&rsquo;s) went to Marshall and asked THEM to forfeit.  It was Marshall who forfeited.  We wouldn&rsquo;t want to ruin a good fairytale by saying, &#8220;then, the white coach went to the black coach and said, &#8216;You guys really suck, why don&rsquo;t you give up?&rsquo; and then the black coach, in typical black fashion, gave up.&#8221;</p>
<p>     According to the Coach&rsquo;s letter, the Marshall girls had a week of practice.  You might not be good in a week, but you didn&rsquo;t know how to hold a bat or where first base was after a week of practice?  What exactly were they practicing?  </p>
<p>     This from the Coach&rsquo;s letter: &ldquo;One at a time the Marshall girls would come in to hit.&rdquo; Traylor recalled. &ldquo;As they hit the ball their faces LIT UP!&#8221;</p>
<p>     A week of practice and this is the first time they hit a ball?</p>
<p>     Something that was left out of the article, but included in the Coach&rsquo;s letter&hellip; and this I find not surprising&hellip; </p>
<p>     &#8220;&hellip;I had to show them how to fill out a lineup card.&#8221;</p>
<p>     Exactly how hard is it to write down nine names on a card containing nine spaces?</p>
<p>     This whole feel-good tripe is aggravating at best.<br>

<p>That reminds me of a recent Dateline NBC.  Chris Hansen of &#8220;Catch a Kiddie Diddler&#8221; fame, profiled his native Detroit.  Actually, he wasn&rsquo;t a city native, but from the suburbs.  He also profiled a program run by his HS alma mater, a far out safe suburban Catholic school, where students would volunteer to teach inner city Detroit blacks who are behind grade level some basic skills.</p>
<p>So here you go   &mdash;   In the time the (presumably) high achieving whites from Brother Rice H.S. could have been furthering their own education, they were holding themselves back in effect to make dummies a little less dumb, or at least they hoped.  In the long run, the smart whites were less educated than they otherwise would have been, and the city blacks were only slightly more educated.  Not a good return on time investment, IMHO.<br>

		<p>Aside from Brigand&rsquo;s excellent sleuth work, the obvious questions remain:  Why would you go out for a sport if you don&rsquo;t innately understand the most basic rules and know how to practice the most elementary of fundamentals?  Why would you coach a sport, Ibid.?</p>

		<p>Good work, Brigand.</p>
<p>But now we come to this question, which is still but one step removed from what they wanted us to believe: Why did the Leftist press hype this story in this way? Even if it did not happen in real life as such; it was reported as such.</p>
<p>Why?</p>

&#8220;So here you go  &mdash;  In the time the (presumably) high achieving whites from Brother Rice H.S. could have been furthering their own education, they were holding themselves back in effect to make dummies a little less dumb, or at least they hoped. In the long run, the smart whites were less educated than they otherwise would have been, and the city blacks were only slightly more educated. Not a good return on time investment, IMHO.&#8221;</p>
<p>The error is in assuming that Whites actually make an &#8220;investment&#8221; in advancing the blacks.  An investment is made with the expectation of a return, and no White really believes that blacks will advance.  Some Whites hope the blacks will advance, and they call it an investment, but it is really a speculation based on the hope of equality, which is a false hope because the blacks are not, nor will they ever be, equal to Whites.</p>
<p>But when the truth is out, just as you observed, the Whites will have wasted their time and lost the opportunity to advance themselves further.</p>
<p>Helping the blacks is never an investment or a speculation, it is always an liability, a pure cost, a net loss, a misguided gift of charity, and an unappreciated one at that.</p>
<p>When Whites help blacks, the Whites lose by a count of two for every count of one that the blacks gain.  Whites always step backwards while trying to pull the blacks forward.  </p>
<p>The question Whites must ask themselves is this:  Why are White people the ones coming to the rescues of the blacks.  Why aren&rsquo;t the blacks doing this for themselves?  Where do we find Whites in such a helpless condition when drugs and alcohol are not present?  </p>
<p>Why do we care for the blacks (I no longer say &#8220;black people&#8221; or &#8220;black race&#8221; because I share nothing of my humanity with them; I refuse to be universalized with such a degenerate creature) when the blacks care so little for themselves?</p>
<p>Whites need to wake up and realize that the blacks are not just White people with black skin and kinky hair.  </p>
<p>Blacks are creatures of the african jungle, and their black skin and kinky wool heads are only outward manifestations of just how opposite of us they are in mind and temperament.</p>
<p>Waste nothing for their sake.  Only defend yourself.  Care not for those who are not of your blood.  Love your own kind.  Love your Race, and the only truly human race is White Anglo Nordic Aryan Celtic Christian Gentile Saxon. </p>
<p>Your Kith and Kin are your only concern.  Let the others solve their own problems.  NEVER sacrifice for anything less than your own White Nation. <br>

		<p>My first instinct is to agree with the first post and go with charity, but what would the black girls do if the roles where reversed? They would run up the score and make fun of the losing team.</p>
