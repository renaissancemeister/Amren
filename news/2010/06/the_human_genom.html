			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Damian Thompson, London Telegraph, June 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The current issue of The Economist carries an article marking the 10th anniversary of the mapping of the human genome. There&rsquo;s nothing sensational about it until the last two paragraphs, which claim that humanity is on the verge of making dangerous discoveries about itself. I won&rsquo;t take the risk of guessing what those discoveries might be, but it strikes me as odd that The Economist should raise this matter <i>en passant,</i> as if it were half hoping that no one would notice:<blockquote>Genomics may reveal that humans really are brothers and sisters under the skin. The species is young, so there has been little time for differences to evolve. Politically, that would be good news. It may turn out, however, that some differences both between and within groups are quite marked. If those differences are in sensitive traits like personality or intelligence, real trouble could ensue.</p>
<p>People must be prepared for this possibility, and ready to resist the excesses of racialism, nationalism and eugenics that some are bound to propose in response. That will not be easy. The liberal answer is to respect people as individuals, regardless of the genetic hand that they have been dealt. Genetic knowledge, however awkward, does not change that.<br/>

		<p>Whenever someone like Phillippe Rushton or Charles Murray mentions genetic racial differences someone always chimes in that the idea was disproved by the Human Genome Project.</p>
<p>As this article makes clear that is simply untrue.</p>

		<p>Questions and reservations about Out of Africa theory of human origins are of relevance to this issue.  AR and scientists presenting at AR Conferences appear in the past to have assumed implicitly that OoA was t-h-e confirmed version of human origins.  But there are troubling voices in the shadows that are<br/>
reasonable and informed and that object to this rush to judgment.<br/>
It would help journalists to be more forthcoming if if the <br/>
abiding question marks that belong in place were not air brushed away but were dissipated by informed and reasonable disputation among those holding different views.  Where is that disputation?<br/>

<p>Actually I would tend to agree with that statement. But only for those deserving of respect. And this quote IS NOT the stance liberals take. They may mouth the words, but their actions are something completely different. How much respect do they have for White&rsquo;s when they hang a &#8220;White&rsquo;s need not apply sign&#8221; in Seattle? Or by forcing minorities into White neighborhoods through section 8? Or by forced busing in the past? Or by CONFISCATING White earned wages to support a plethora of &#8220;great society&#8221; programs for minorities? The list is endless. </p>

		<p>For a long time I have wondered what the scientific community would do if they discovered  an intelligence gene, or a sociopath gene. Being a minor cynic, I automatically assumed that, despite being scientists, they would destroy any trace of the evidence, as it would be the atomic bomb of society, a genie that could not be put back in it&rsquo;s bottle. But now I&rsquo;m thinking that the hint dropped by the Economist is a prelude, that the scientific world is trying to find a diplomatic way to tell us that, yes, we are not the same.</p>

		<p>Dangerous discoveries?  I suppose that means that if a seismically active fault is discovered near a major population center the discovery must be suppressed, lest the peasants panic.</p>
<p>Likewise, if genetically-based differences in intelligence are noted, this must be suppressed also, lest the peasants realize that these differences, which they&rsquo;ve noted for untold generations, are factual and real.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t have the peasants drawing the obvious (and correct) conclusions.</p>

<p>This is not true. Liberals believe in group entitlements and outlooks. Conservatives believe in rights for the individual. It&rsquo;s not even true liberals are respectful in general - aside from seeming to have little respect for even themselves, they don&rsquo;t seem to have to much respect for those that don&rsquo;t agree with them. </p>

<p>Tell you what, lets avoid &#8216;real trouble&rsquo; by continuing to ignore the facts and blaming Whites for the failings of Blacks instead. That would be much fairer and far more ethical, and would keep self-loathing White academics employed for another generation.</p>

		<p> We all know what the writer is referring to. We&rsquo;re not all &#8220;brothers and sisters under the skin.&#8221; All human beings, yes, of course. But we don&rsquo;t look just alike   &mdash;   there are easily identifiable racial appearances that say, &#8220;Here&rsquo;s a White man, here&rsquo;s a black man, here&rsquo;s an Oriental man.&#8221;</p>
<p> But we know that the differences go far deeper than just looks. Whites tend to swim better than blacks; blacks tend to make better sprinters than Whites; Jews (a White ethnic group, to be sure) and East Asians tend to be a little smarter than the rest of us.</p>
<p> Of course the writer is referring to his fear that conclusive proof of White superiority in IQ, nation building, etc., as opposed to black levels in those qualities, will foster White &#8220;racism,&#8221; White &#8220;nationalism,&#8221; ad nauseum. What they&rsquo;re more likely to cause, is an explosion of rage among blacks worldwide when they realize they&rsquo;ve run out of excuses for a lot of their failures.</p>

<p>Yes. One should be prepared to resist the excesses in BOTH directions. However, the suggestion that there may be excesses also suggests the possibility of a reasonable and acceptable level as well. And I think my opinion on what is reasonable and acceptable is every bit as good as Damian Thompson&rsquo;s.</p>

They flatly deny that blacks and Hispanics are less intelligent on average and more criminal prone than whites, despite decades of statistics and millenia of folk knowledge.

<p>Nonsense.</p>
<p>The statement should read:</p>
<p>The liberal answer is to respect, promote and enforce non-White group rights and use the idea of &#8216;people as individuals&rsquo; to keep Whites atomized and separated at all times.</p>
<p>Individuals have no power and the liberal/lefty elite know it.</p>
<p>The hostile elite have used the notion of &#8216;people as individuals&rsquo; to hypocritically prevent White group formation which they trumpet as always leading to Nazism and therefore must be instantly quashed (via the DOJ, ADL lawyers, FBI and other enforcement/intimidation arms of the current White-hating government).</p>
<p>Or as Alec Kurtagic writes on OO:</p>
<p>Hostile elites have internalized two simple Leftist syllogisms:  </p>
<p>White Nationalists are ethnonationalists.<br/>
The Nazis were ethnonationalists.<br/>
Therefore, White Nationalists are Nazis.   </p>

<p>After we are throughly vilified (as if we aren&rsquo;t now) and de-humanized, deemed &#8216;excess population&rsquo;, genocide against us Whites won&rsquo;t be far away.</p>

		<p>The Economist also carried an article late last year (in Nov.)saying that in 2010 there would be a &#8220;looming crisis in genetics.&#8221; Scientists would discover that groups differ much more greatly than the PC police have insisted and that this would become &#8220;public knowledge.&#8221; We&rsquo;re about half way through 2010 so just when will this &#8220;dangerous&#8221; knowledge finally be unveiled? Is this just hype or will there really soon be irresfutable proof that race is not a mere social construct .</p>

<p>&#8220;The liberal answer is to respect people as individuals, regardless of the genetic hand that they have been dealt.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is actually the conservative approach.  The liberal answer is to redistribute.</p>

		<p>26 you forget the new liberal science is based on consensus not silly things like experimentation and replication of results. If they get more people with letters on the end of their names to sign something than our side then that&rsquo;s the way it is and everything else is pseudoscience. </p>

		<p>#27: couldn&rsquo;t agree more. Whites have been vilified not only through official govt. policies, but through college courses (white studies), and even in secondary schools for quite some time. A cynic could look at all of this exactly as &#8220;preparation&#8221; for Whites being &#8220;set up&#8221; for extermination, or severe marginalization as was done to the native americans. &#8220;Hate Whitey&#8221; has been the battle cry for a long time. Why do we tolerate it?</p>

		<p>The Telegraph should read the Economist more carefully if it thinks only the last 2 paragraphs of its report on the human genome was controversial.</p>
<p>In the same issue the Economist reports the plans of an institute in Hong Kong as follows:</p>
<p>&#8220;The building belongs to the BGI, once known as the Beijing Genomics Institute. Mr Wong manages the institute&rsquo;s Hong Kong operation, but the institute itself is based over the border in the People&rsquo;s Republic proper, in Shenzhen. The BGI itself is one part &mdash; arguably the leading one &mdash; of China&rsquo;s effort to show that it can be the scientific peer of the West.</p>
<p>&#8220;Its boss, Yang Huangming, is certainly the peer of people like Dr Venter, Dr Lander and Dr Collins. He is a man on a mission to make the BGI the first global genomics operation. Part of the reason for building his newest sequencing centre in Hong Kong is to reassure researchers from other countries that the facility will operate inside a reliable legal framework. If all goes well, laboratories in North America and Europe will follow.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr Yang is also candid about the possibility of the 1,000-genome project revealing systematic geographical differences in human genetics &mdash; or, to put it politically incorrectly, racial differences. The differences that have come to light so far are not in sensitive areas such as intelligence. But if his study of schoolchildren does find genes that help control intelligence, a comparison with the results of the 1,000-genome project will be only a mouse-click away.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Today&rsquo;s &#8220;dangerous discoveries,&#8221; as will never be tolerated by anti racist, inclusive, and welcoming Abe F. and Heidi B.</p>
<p>1. Today, I didn&rsquo;t see a single mixed race couple or mulatto children. I am grateful to the fates for offering me a city experience that didn&rsquo;t offend me by violating my God given sense of taste and propriety. The &#8220;dangerous discovery&#8221; I made was just how refined my tastes are in favor of White Women for whom I suffer the compassionate fear of White Womb Destruction. </p>
<p>2. Today, I put my faith into action by practicing White Liberation Theology.  Walked into a store, and black salesman approached me.  I declined his offer and waited on the White salesperson, with whom I share White Humanity and victim status. (I could have just walked out and started boycotting the business for having the poor judgment of thinking a black could offer me the quality experience that I want.) I gave my business to my White brother because I&rsquo;m more interested in his economic success than I am in that of the black, or any black.  The &#8220;dangerous discovery&#8221; I made through that exercise of religious freedom was that it feels really good and makes God smile when we consciously ignore &#8220;the feelings of blacks&#8221; and &#8220;do the right thing&#8221; by helping members of our own Humanity.   </p>
<p>3. Today, I looked at German tourist magazines. Some were refreshingly free of the Diversity Horror Show, but even the purest one had an article about &#8220;Marching for Tolerance&#8221; showing White German lesbians waving rainbow flags while frowning.  The &#8220;dangerous discovery&#8221; I made today was that Germans are not yet  mongrelized, and how depressing it is to see that their lesbians are just as ugly as ours. </p>
<p>4. Today, for the very first time I encountered Leni Riefenstahl&rsquo;s photographs from deepest, darkest Africa.  God, she must have really been suffering from dementia or was trying to overcome the Nazi stain by showing how appreciative she became of Our Universal Humanity, or something absurd like that. Or maybe, and more likely given the German Genius, she had read Hinton Rowan Helper and decided his dedicated research and brilliant insights about the blacks needed a illustrated guide.   The &#8220;dangerous discovery&#8221; I made today was just how much of Africa is still in our yet to be deported Africans.   </p>
<p>Post Script: Living as a dispossessed White minority in a majority black city, I can look forward to many more &#8220;dangerous discoveries&#8221; each and every day that I fail to &#8220;do the right thing&#8221; and flee this place of Reconstruction II violence and degradation and ever increasing property taxes mandated for paying for all the black government salaries, travel, insurance, and lifetime retirements.</p>
<p>Are you despondent over just what idiots Whites prove themselves to be? Then look at me and where I live and sink deeper into hopelessness.  </p>

<p>Conservatives are wrong. The liberals are right. It is just that the liberals are fighting for the wrong side. Advancing group interests is what all people, including white people, have done throughout human history. The pioneering white Americans took land away from Indians, because they believed the rights of white people were more important than the rights of Indians. What the hell is wrong with that? If Indians had been better-armed and defeated the whites, how would whites have been treated. In a normal and healthy society, whites are supposed to advance the rights of whites, and not the interests of other races. Does anybody expect the Chinese, Arabs, blacks, and Mestizos to advance white interests? If whites will not advance the interests of white people, who will?</p>
<p>The white NATO nations are prepared to use all military force necessary, to defend every inch of their national territory, from foreign military invasions. The white gene pool is more important than geographical territory. If whites are ready to wage war to defend dirt, would they be willing to consider the possibility that their genes and their children, are more important than dirt?</p>
<p>If the human genome project proves beyond doubt that whites alone, possess some unique creativity gene, that can explain why 95 percent of scientific and technological innovations were made by white people, what should we do? Should we throw away this unique genetic inheritance, in the name of treating people as individuals? Or should we suggest a humane relocation of non-whites living in white nations, while paying them billions in relocation costs, in order to protect this unique genotype.</p>
<p>Think of all the future scientific achievements that lie in the future. A manned mission to Mars. A cure for all types of cancer. Cheap Space tourism for the masses. Weight loss drugs that rapidly increase body metabolism, without harming human health. Cloning technology that can bring back the Mammoths. Are we going to throw all that away? Treating people as individuals is fine, when you are living in a racially homogenous society. But if Japan wants to remain Japanese, and China wants to remain Chinese, what would be wrong if America and Europe were re-established as white nations?</p>

		<p>I believe liberal Whites put the interests of non-Whites ahead of their own kind because they are in rebellion against their extended genetic family.  Something must have happened to them when they were young that filled them with dislike for Whites as a people, above and beyond the media influences and school brainwashing.  </p>
<p>Maybe they were rejected by their peers at school, or their families were dysfunctional, but something happened to turn them against their own kind and to be attracted to &#8220;the other,&#8221; even idealizing non-Whites as better people than Whites.  Because there is a deep emotional basis for the rebellion, liberals will not respond to logic if you mention intelligence differences, drop-out rates, crime rates, destroyed neighborhoods, etc.  </p>
<p>Many liberal Whites want to help people, but when they don&rsquo;t love their own kind because of unresolved childhood issues, they transfer their concern and love to non-White groups.  For those who wish to exact vengeance against Whites, and many do, they actively support ONLY non-White causes while simultaneously disdaining poor, marginalized Whites as losers.</p>

<p>I think you are on to something there. I have also thought that Liberal Whites identification with minorities to be a kind of collective Stockhome Syndrome. I grew up in the in the Hyde Park neighborhood on the South side of Chicago. (Obama&rsquo;s neighborhood). I was a minority in a majority black high school. Many of of white kids were terrified of the violence among the blacks and lived with the daily fear of getting jumped, etc.. I think in attempting to identify with the black students, the white students were trying to avoid being beaten, raped or worse.</p>

		<p>I think Psychology Student is definitely onto something here.</p>
<p>There may be explanations in childhood trauma, but I suspect that the real fault lies in the constitution of the individual.</p>
<p>The defective perverts with a grievance against societal norms will probably tend toward subversion and potential racial annihilation.</p>
<p>One only has to look at the &#8216;grand coalition&rsquo; of moribund defectives to see this come into play.</p>
<p>Those with a Grievance or a Natural Sense of Injustice will likely lash out at the society they are putatively a part of and tend to embrace the transgressive, the defective and the retrograde.</p>
<p>From the point of view of an Englishman, I am not too surprised that the defectors and traitors to the Soviet Union were all defective in some way and usually in very personal ways. As this is a family web site, I will not emphasise too much just what these deficiencies and personal defects may be; though for those of more mature and experienced years, I feel sure that it would all come together to form a coherent picture as to what we are really up against.</p>

<p>This is plainly false.  </p>
<p>The liberal position is very explicitly founded upon the belief that all races are identical in character and talent, and that an array of race-based policies are required to prevent the irreversibly racist white man from getting ahead by cheating.</p>
<p>The contrary position, the race realist position, is simply that these policies which are based on myths should be repealed, and has nothing to do with a lack of respect for non-whites.</p>
