			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Pomfret, Washington Post, June 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Last year, Zhao Bowen was part of a team that cracked the genetic code of the cucumber. These days, he&rsquo;s probing the genetic basis for human IQ.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Unburdened by social and legal constraints common in the West, China&rsquo;s trailblazing scientists are also pushing the limits of ethics and principle as they create a new  &mdash;  and to many, worrisome  &mdash;  Wild West in the Far East.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2007, Chinese geneticists discovered vast differences in the genetic makeup of Africans, Asians and Caucasians. They will soon report a breakthrough showing why some people  &mdash;  such as Tibetans  &mdash;  can live effortlessly at high altitudes while others can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Inside the 11-story facility, the vibe is pure Silicon Valley start-up: shorts, flip-flops, ankle bracelets, designer eyewear and a random tattoo. Zhao came to BGI on a summer internship last year to work on cucumbers. Now afull-time employee while continuing his studies, Zhao is turning his attention to a topic Western researchers have shied away from because of ethical worries: Zhao plans to study the genes of 1,000 of his best-performing classmates at a top high school in Beijing and compare them, he said, &#8220;with1,000 normal kids.&#8221;<br>

		<p>If everything can be made &#8216;equal&rsquo;, any remaining differences in intelligence must be due to genes. IQ is probably 50% genetics, and 50% environment, study and interest. We aren&rsquo;t born rocket scientists. Environment plays a part. All the more reason to encourage students to live up to their full potential; something currently not on the agenda in the PC West. </p>

		<p>Hmm, It never occurred to me that non-Westerns would take Genetics on questions of human equality forward. I suppose I always just assumed Westerners would stumble upon it by accident or by &#8220;accident.&#8221;</p>
<p>One way or another, whether the West stares the truth right in the face and even denies it or not, the truth will come to light and we as concerned individuals, our nationalist and/or racialist movement, and at least the oppressed Western populations of the world will have their day in the sun.</p>

		<p>The Chinese will likely blaze ahead in science because they spend their resources on their best and brightest while Western  nations spend their money on their least brightest ie. &#8220;no child left behind&#8221; blah blah.

		<p>&#8220;a topic Western researchers have shied away from because of ethical worries:&#8221;</p>
<p>NOT ONLY a topic like the link between intelligence and race, etc. Also eugenics and such. The Chinese will NOT have inhibitions, religious based, against such research. NOR confined to eugenics alone.</p>
<p>Their ethical code is not of the Judeo-Christian background. They WILL and probably are now conducting research in all areas that American and European scientists cannot do because of ethical restraints.</p>
<p>I have read that ALREADY the communists are engaging in selective breeding among the communist party cadres. In six or seven generations a whole population of persons will be running around in China with IQ&rsquo;s of around 200 or so?</p>

		<p>Asians will force the Human Genome Project to show its cards.  Asians have always known that blacks and aboriginal races are less intelligent.  The HGP has been quivering in fear over the predictable results it found.  They must be thinking, &#8220;How do we explain to everyone that the people with common sense were 100% right?&#8221;</p>

		<p> The portion of the article concerning the racial genetic make-up discoveries was tantalizingly brief   &mdash;   but, I suspect, just a hint of things to come.</p>
<p> I suppose the IQ-related portion of all the research described was the part that Westerners are supposed to find &#8220;worrisome.&#8221; At least, those who believe that &#8220;race is just a social construct&#8221; should be worried. That muted thunder they hear in the distance will one day turn into a deafening boom as their cherished wish-balloon explodes in their faces.</p>
<p> And we told them all the time they were wrong. But they wouldn&rsquo;t listen &hellip;</p>

		<p>Fascinating. Since the Chinese want to re-colonize Africa (with Chinese, of course) I guess it makes sense that, unlike the West, they would be unafraid of political correctness considerations,. It would be interesting if they succeeded in advancing knowledge of the genetic basis for human IQ. But even if they did, we would probably just ignore it.  I also wonder if the Chinese have the technical expertise to make major breakthroughs in genetic science, even if they did crack the genetic code of the cucumber&hellip;</p>

		<p>Yep, the Chinese have finally woken up in the pursuit of truth.  They have been slumbering for the last couple of centuries.  In mean while, the whites have and continual to waste tons of tax money over affirmative action, closing educational racial gap, etc. etc.  Even elected an affirmative action president!  You think the Chinese are not laughing about that?  They are not fools regarding the inherent deficiencies of the black/brown races.  Perhaps, the whites will threaten enough by the Chinese to have first class educational programs, keeping jobs here, etc.  </p>

		<p>Domestic nonsense (domination of education system by rigid dogmata of &#8220;liberalism&#8221;, <i>de facto</i> ban on &#8220;politically incorrect&#8221; free intellectual inquiry, idiocies of multiculturalism, diversity, and affirmative action, and - if the above were not enough nails in the coffin of American superiority - an emergence of neo-socialism and powerful unions) makes mediocre but populous countries like China competitive these days. Add to this the nonsenses of free trade (an euphemism for siphoning of advanced technology abroad) and heavy capital investment in foreign countries, trends that strip the U.S. of traditional but fading technological advantage, and &hellip; well, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. (That is for those naive or dishonest who claim that the past four decades of economic policies were beneficial to our country: for if everything is so good then why is it so bad?)</p>
<p>It all begun with LB Johnson&rsquo;s draconian &#8220;New Society&#8221; laws (not that Richard Nixon did not contribute to the present catastrophe) and gradual implementation of &#8220;liberal&#8221; improvements to our country. I would hypothesize that the main architects of these changes have had sinister anti-American intentions. Whatever it was, nothing will improve before there is a true separation of &#8220;liberalism&#8221; and political power. Be prepared for a rough ride.<br>

		<p>China doesn&rsquo;t need to worry about being politically correct or catering to the diversity crowd when it comes to science and research.  China today is like America was shortly after world war II and America is where China was during the Cultural Revolution.  America is headed for 3rd world status while Chine is headed for the top.  </p>
<p>China has an average IQ of about 105, while white America with an average IQ of about 100 continues to create immigration policies that permit Latinos with average IQ&rsquo;s well below 90 into the country.  Do the math&hellip;LOL.</p>

<p>OpenMind3 wrote:</p>
<p>I live in a city with a vibrant hi-tech industry. My 6 year old son is about to start K-1. The local school board recently approved a dumbed-down version of mathematics curriculum called &ldquo;Discovery math&rdquo; which essentially turn the teaching of math into an English class. When I confronted the board that the curriculum does not prepare the kids for a hi-tech career, the board&rsquo;s response was they are not training the students to be engineers and most students are no going to need math in their career!</p>
<p>Amazingly, quite a number of (non-Asian) parents support the &ldquo;discovery math&rdquo; and think that the earlier math curriculum frustrate their childen and lower their elf-esteem.</p>
<p>The funny (but sad) thing is that I learned from my (Taiwanese) wife that there are weekend chinese language schools start to cash in on the anxiety face by Asian parent who are afraid that their kids can&rsquo;t compete globally and start to often (&ldquo;traditional&rdquo;) weekend math classes.</p>

		<p>Why is this research &#8216;worrisome&rsquo; to the liberal left? Surely the results will only prove liberal paradigms of equality and humiliate evil racists?</p>
<p>I mean, the liberals sincerely believe all that stuff they&rsquo;ve been telling us&hellip; don&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>Normally if this sort of research was started in the West I&rsquo;d expected it to be canceled and airbrushed out of history. Now that it&rsquo;s happening in China I really don&rsquo;t know how the liberals are going to react to it.</p>

		<p>Interesting how this witless ninny Pomfret characterizes scientific inquiry into genetic contributions to human intelligence as &#8220;pushing the limits of ethics and principle.&#8221; So now revealing the truth is unethical?</p>
<p>Well, actually, to any good socialist suppressing the truth in order to brutally hammer whatever pegs into whatever non-fitting holes they find convenient is morally correct, no matter how many of the hapless pegs they have imprison, torture, or kill in the process.  They managed to kill over 100 million non-fitting pegs in the 20th Century alone, and effectively imprisoned all the rest during their highly moral crusade of social conformity.</p>
<p>And here in the enlightened West the truth about genetics and human intelligence must be suppressed at all cost, even when the truth is known to everybody with normal powers of observation and raciocination. Vast social programs and even perhaps the main function of government itself is devoted to maintaining the myth and punishing the non-believers (or at least those who speak out).</p>
<p>The only way to save what&rsquo;s left of this nation will be its dissolution.</p>

People who live long enough will eventually realize that certain groups are, on average, smarter than others  &mdash;  and liberals are no different in this knowledge than anyone else.  They just lie about it and worry that the truth will come out in a baldly scientific statement.  And this knowledge has been around for thousands of years.</p>

<p>No this won&rsquo;t happen because there is a tendency of IQs to regress to the norm. For example if two very low IQ or high IQ parents get together there children will have a tendency to have IQs closer to normal for the race. Selective breeding while helpfull does have its limits.</p>

		<p>The Chinese are allowing real science without the constraints placed on Western scientists that are forced to tailor their research to conform to the liberal PC dogma. I think we are going to see many Western scientist moving to China where they can work in a atmosphere where they won&rsquo;t fear being ostracized and having their careers ruined. This is where the real innovations will come from. Western ingenuity combined with Eastern willingness to pursue fields deemed taboo in Europe and America. I imagine that many White scientists that are seeing their dreams stamped on by underfunding and outright hostility by our government will jump at an invitation from the Chinese to be able to work on the projects of their choice. </p>

<p>Where does study, self discipline and interest come from?  Yes, the character of the person, which is overwhelmingly heritable.  We create our own environments, discriminate on what we wish to learn, pursue the things that interest us, associate with people of our choosing and read what interests us.  Yes, an enriched environment is good to have, but ultimately each person must create it for himself.  One needs both appetite as well as aptitude.  It&rsquo;s all in the chemistry.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t agree at all that these are &#8216;great days&rsquo; for our nation.</p>
<p>Having sold off heavy manufacturing and a good deal of our agro base, we are now offshoring R&D.;</p>
<p>So that not only are we ditching blue and white collar jobs but now the lab coat specialties which _drive our university_ research is being tossed.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
While R&D; goes offshore, innovation stays. For now. </p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re talking about offshoring, Engardio says, the conversation is no longer just about costs. It&rsquo;s also about where talent and capabilities are available. Though cost-cutting remains the driver behind offshoring, Engardio says this work won&rsquo;t come back to the U.S. as India&rsquo;s wages or other costs rise. &#8220;The shift is permanent,&#8221; Engardio says. </p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the other reason R&D; is increasingly headquartered in India and China: proximity to emerging markets. </p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Cisco now has 2,000 people doing R&D; in India. &#8220;The head of that centre sits in an office and looks like a modern day Pharaoh with the scale of building under way around him,&#8221; says Engardio. &#8220;He says in five years, they will have 10,000 people. And by the way, I&rsquo;m not looking for average engineers. I want innovators. These are no cheap bodies.&#8221; Why? He&rsquo;s not looking at the U.S. as his major market for product sales. He&rsquo;s looking at emerging technology greenfields markets like Dubai in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. </p>
<p>&#8220;All the new developments outfitted with next generation telecom networks we&rsquo;ll never see in the U.S.,&#8221; says Engardio. &#8220;The next generation of services is going to be in Asia.&#8221; So Cisco is situating the design work in India. &#8220;Is it going to work out?&#8221; asks Engardio. &#8220;Who knows? But it seems like the right bet.&#8221; </p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;The only thing (India) isn&rsquo;t doing is owning the intellectual property. The multinationals are pulling the strings and staying at the top of the food chain, which is why the debate over whether this is good or bad for the United States is very, very murky,&#8221; says Engardio, &#8220;The American companies have India working for us, in a way.&#8221;<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>The next wave of globalisation: Offshoring R&D; to India and China</p>

We have -never- been able to contain the proliferation of knowledge, nor has any other nation.  WWI happened because the German leads in synthetic chemical industry were stolen by the Brits.  The Greeks lost out to the Latins and the Arabs.  The Arabs brought some of that knowledge to a Darkened Europe.</p>
<p>And once these smart people have real power they will begin to do what smart people -everywhere- do: manipulate the &#8216;leadership&rsquo; under them.  Mouse eats Elephant.  And whether the racial divides are acknowledged (publicly) or not, the ethnic and geographical hegemony of Asians over Asians will disenfranchise the very multi-nats that think they now &#8216;own&rsquo; these technology base investments.</p>
<p>And the U.S., dumbed down for a solid 3 generations by it&rsquo;s Elites, raping everything for profit while distracting us with the ethnocultural debacle of the 60s, will be seen or the evil influence that they represent by people who have a very insular system of internal safeguards.</p>
<p>The Chinese will laugh, wrest free the technology and patent controls and go on to rule a world for which white corporate influence is seen as a nuisance to be destroyed and overridden.</p>
<p>If genetic differences in IQ can be proven and the key to isolating and (jump gene as opposed to viral imbed) transcribing them between DNA groups determined, WHY SHOULD ANYONE who is not crippled by Judeo-Christian beliefs want to &#8216;share&rsquo;?</p>
<p>We have essentially won the battle, after massive treachery from above and below amongst our own, only to hand over our swords on the eve of a war that we are no longer prepared to fight.</p>
<p>The Chinese will make fun of us for our trusting natures.  And inferior intelligence.  Because they will not look at any man except as a building block to something more.  So long as that man is Asian and culturally loyal rather than gregarious.</p>
<p>As such, they will keep their most sensitive bio-tech leads at home.  Because they don&rsquo;t need to whore their advances overseas to afford what they develop for themselves as the U.S. based &#8216;for profit&rsquo; system has so long done.</p>

		<p>Breeding children from two very high IQ parents also tends to produce autistic kids.  Silicon Valley, where bright, single men and women working in the microelectronics industry met, married and produced children is a hot-spot for smart kids, but it is also a hot-spot for autistic kids.</p>

		<p>I think you are right, RJS.  These discoveries have been made once before by whites.</p>
<p>Some people on here are using this story as an excuse to discuss how China&rsquo;s whopping 5 point IQ difference over white America makes the Chinese so much smarter than us.</p>
<p>No, this is just another example of the Chinese taking over something that was first discovered by white people and running with it, while in the mean time, whites shy away from it in order to make their multicultural societies work.</p>
<p>If the West had stayed homogenous and had kept all it&rsquo;s technology to itself, the Chinese wouldn&rsquo;t be looking so big and bad now would they?</p>
<p><br>
For these reasons, the Chinese continue to get credit for many things that white people actually started doing first.  How long will we allow this happen?  We need to pick our race or multiculturalism.  Which will it be?</p>

		<p>Science is not the only field in which China is pushing the envelope. To make matters worse, China practically owns the US.  </p>
<p>After all, whoever controls a country&rsquo;s finances also, by implication, controls its economy.</p>
<p>In total, lenders from Japan and China held 44% of the foreign-owned debt.  About 66% of that 44% debt was held by the central banks of other countries, in particular the central banks of Japan and China. In May 2009, the US owed China $772 billion.[22]</p>
<p>China will most likely try to dump the US dollar as soon as she decides it&rsquo;s expedient to do as was speculated about few years ago.</p>
<p>How on earth did, the USA ever allow itself to fall so far.  There again, the true answer is not that elusive either providing one researches the right avenues.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Unburdened by social and legal constraints common in the West, China&rsquo;s trailblazing scientists are also pushing the limits of ethics and principle as they create a new &mdash; and to many, worrisome &mdash; Wild West in the Far East.&#8221;</p>
<p>So there you have it. Science is unethical and unprincipled if it contradicts politically correct doctrines about race and equality.</p>

		<p><i>No this won&rsquo;t happen because there is a tendency of IQs to regress to the norm. For example if two very low IQ or high IQ parents get together there children will have a tendency to have IQs closer to normal for the race. Selective breeding while helpfull does have its limits.</i></p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t regress <i>quite</i> to the norm. If the smarter people in a given population have more surviving children than the dumber people (such as in pre-industrial areas with very cold winters), the population gets smarter over time.</p>

		<p>I heard that because of the higher average IQ and the population size China actually has as many people in the gifted and talented range as there are people in the USA.<br>
Also, I second the notion that China will colonize Africa. although that appears far-out to many. I foresee China using a media campaign to remind the world of how close she came to landing in Africa ca. 1000 AD, and of her peaceful intentions towards Africa. Whether China will be peaceful or bellicose depends on what China needs; I don&rsquo;t think we will have much to say about it. <br>
The USA faces a huge political challenge because of the debt we have incurred to China; our government will be acting as a defacto tax collector for the Chinese government literally forever as our debt compounds. Will our government  de-legitimize itself, in the very process of funding itself, when the citizenry awakens to the extent of tax tribute we must pay?<br>
Will certain sections of the population renounce fealty to the compromised state?</p>

<p>This is not multiculturalism, this is good news. Funny how you have to turn anything remotely about asia into a superiority shouting match. Can&rsquo;t you just be happy that at least truth is coming to light thats going to benefit WNs everywhere? Oh, of course not, its trash just because it wasn&rsquo;t whites who are being credited with it. You are too picky, really. In the long run, your objections amount to very little.</p>
<p>(Keep in mind it was the white mans intelligence that discovered genetics, but it was also that same white man who chooses to tie his hands behind his back. They&rsquo;re both part of the same package, you can&rsquo;t accept white genius and then discard white altruism as some anomaly. As long as whites are whites, you will still see white altruism being expressed in some manner. Therefore you shouldn&rsquo;t really be so surprised at your brethren for being so eager to share their spoils with other races. Like I said, you have to take the whole thing about whites, the good and the bad, you can&rsquo;t just pick and choose what white traits you choose to acknowledge.)</p>

		<p>America will retain its competitive advantages in the near future because it still attracts many of the best &amp; brightest from around the world. Even though education today may be dumbed down, there is still enough human talent and innovation in centers of excellence to remain viable.</p>
<p>Part of China&rsquo;s grand modernisation juggling act includes the attraction of &#8220;overseas Chinese&#8221; scientists who are working abroad, with incentives being brand new labs, equipment, money etc. The Chinese aren&rsquo;t as cohesive and clan-like as many seem to believe, hence China&rsquo;s effort in trying to sway them back. There&rsquo;s reason to believe that China either doesn&rsquo;t have enough PhDs yet, or is still trying to find ways to fully marshal the talent in its existing pool. </p>
<p>Education in China, at both the primary and secondary levels, is about the sorting and selection of good students; starkly different from the &#8220;no child left behind&#8221; mantra. The strength of the approach is obvious, but so is the weakness (it seems like they&rsquo;re willing to accept the sacrifice, at least for now).</p>
<p>Time will tell how all this pans out. China is being built up at an incredible rate and its engine is starting to kick into gear after years of slumber. There is a great risk of underestimating their capabilities, because a lot can change over there in a short amount of time.</p>

&#8220;&hellip;.Illumina Makes Record Sale of New Gene Machines to China<br>
January 12, 2010, 5:20 PM EST</p>
<p></p>
<p>By Meg Tirrell</p>
<p>Jan. 12 (Bloomberg)   &mdash;   Illumina Inc., the San Diego-based maker of equipment to analyze DNA, said it had a record sale of its new systems that can decipher a person&rsquo;s genetic code for less than $10,000. The shares rose the most in almost a year.</p>
<p>Illumina sold 128 of the HiSeq 2000 systems to the Beijing Genomics Institute, a Chinese government research institute. The company also reported preliminary fourth-quarter sales that topped analysts&rsquo; estimates&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>These machines are to be used by the Chinese educational establishment to research how to identify gifted individuals early on. I guess &#8220;no child left behind&#8221; means different things to different people.</p>

		<p>There  are  problems  with IQ  scores  as  a  measure  of  natural  or  innate  intelligence.  The environment  always plays  a  crucial  role.</p>
<p>Thus  the  attempt  by  Chinese  scientists to find  the  genetic  basis  for  intelligence would seem  to  face   serious  hurdles given the  billions  of  neurons  &mdash;  all  firing  &mdash;  involved  in  thinking. Furthermore,  they  will  have  to  explain  the large  intra-group  differences  in  IQ  scores.</p>
<p>But  yet,  Asian  IQs  have  been  overblown.  Indians  score  81 on  IQ  tests.  And  for  China  the score  ranges  from  95-100.  The  Philippines  which  is  very  close  to  China scores  86.  And  the  average  for  South East Asia(Cambodia,Laos, Thailand, Indonesia) combined would  be  no  more  than 86-90.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t understand what you are getting at here. If you read my post again, you will see that I acknowledge the bad traits of whites as well&hellip;.specifically the stuff you get into.  Do you just like to start arguments?</p>
<p>My entire post was just a response to people who use stories like this as a reason to talk about how much smarter the Chinese are when the truth of the matter is that both races have their ups and downs.  </p>
<p>And white people, if they would put their minds to it, really aren&rsquo;t that far removed from being on top of the world.  But it seems that certain people just want to constantly cheerlead China and it&rsquo;s glorious future anyways, while making doomsday predictions about the future of white people. </p>
<p>Nothing you have said in your statement there is any different from anything I have talked about before.  I don&rsquo;t understand why we are arguing. I have mentioned the problems with the white race very clearly in my last post.  My point is, that if we could fix those problems we would easily be on top of things again.  This is hardly an issue of the Chinese having a mere 5 point higher IQ, which is what some people want to make it into.</p>
<p>With all the propaganda out there designed to make white people look bad and everybody else (including Asians) look better, I don&rsquo;t understand why people continue to harrass me when I want to stand up for whites on here. And I disagree with you.  I most certainly do NOT do this every time Asians are mentioned.  I just do it when things are blown out of proportion by commenters, and too often they are.</p>

		<p>East Asians are very interested in finding the roots for different cognitive abilities. They are very interested in finding whatever it is that gives whites a general edge in creativity. The Japanese for instance have tried for decades to increase creativity by using all kinds of bizarre exercises (mental and physical) ranging from games to suspending oneself upside down in a swimming pool. </p>

<p>I find it hard to believe a white woman actually wrote this.  All I am doing is standing up for myself.  I am not doing anything to make Asian women look better.  How ridiculous.  I find it hard to believe this isn&rsquo;t some joke post written by a white man trying to make his case as to why he is married to an Asian woman.  Give me a break.</p>
<p>Once again Amren lowers its standards letting personal attacks such as this go through&hellip;&hellip;attacks that add nothing to the discussion.  And I don&rsquo;t even think this post is legitimate to begin with.</p>
<p>I have had two posters email me telling me they are on my side and that they think Amren lets this Asiaphile business go on way too much. One of those posters has said he has tried to put up posts in my defense but that Amren hasn&rsquo;t been putting them up.  I have had a third poster tell me over the phone that he agrees with me.  The four of us might get together and send the people in charge of this website a letter.</p>
<p>There is no reason for posters like me to get harrassed just because we wish to stand up for whites every now and then to make a case that, no, Asians most certainly are not better than us in many ways, and no, we will not accept this argument that China will rule over the world and that there is nothing we can do about it.</p>
<p>I have been posting on here a long while and I used to never have to put up with this stuff.  Amren used to be a place where white people stood up exclusively for whites and white civilization. I think what I am doing on here is healthy.</p>

		<p>Another thing I would like to add is that &#8220;Emily&#8220;&#8216;s comment isn&rsquo;t even accurate.  Only a small percentage of white men go after Asian women when looking at statistics.  I am a conservative Southern Belle, and even though I sound tough on here (because the topic of standing up for my people is so dear to me)&hellip;that doesn&rsquo;t mean I am in any way unfeminine in real life.  I have never had to worry about getting competition from Asian women&hellip;I am still in my twenties and plan to start a white family one day.  But yet, people like &#8220;Emily&#8221; and others on here want to waste their time going after me instead of the race mixers, liberals, and Asiaphiles who post on here.</p>
<p>Now I am going to get accused of turning this discussion into a miscegenation discussion. Blame Amren for putting up &#8220;Emily&#8221; &#8216;s irrelevant and immature post.</p>
