<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The drubbing Tuesday of Rep. Artur Davis (D), who was running to be the first black governor of Alabama, was the latest in a series of defeats this year of African American politicians in primaries for statewide office. {snip} One of the nation&rsquo;s two black governors, New York&rsquo;s David Paterson (D), who has been plagued by ethics scandals, opted not to run this fall  &mdash;  the same decision made by the only black senator, Roland Burris (D-Ill.).</p>
<p>The only African American favored to win a gubernatorial or Senate race is Massachusetts Gov. Deval L. Patrick (D), who is running for a second term.</p>
<p>Aspiring black politicians, such as Rep. Kendrick B. Meek (D-Fla.), who is seeking a Senate seat, are underdogs in general-election contests. And while a number of black Republicans are running, many are losing in primaries.</p>
<p>The defeats suggest that Obama&rsquo;s victory did not herald greater success for other black politicians.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The majority of black politicians in Washington are members of the Congressional Black Caucus, representing districts that are disproportionately liberal and African American, making it difficult for them to build broader coalitions of supporters to win a statewide race. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Black voters and activists, perhaps because of doubts about some black candidates&rsquo; ability to win, have not rallied around them as they did Obama.</p>
<p>African Americans &#8220;are so invested personally in Barack Obama the man, and it&rsquo;s unique to him,&#8221; said Cornell Belcher, a black pollster who worked on the Obama campaign. &#8220;They are invested in him in a way they are not in other black political leaders.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;There were a lot of people who were in fantasy land about black candidates all of sudden getting elected to all of these offices,&#8221; said David Bositis, who studies black political trends at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies. {snip}<br>

<p>This is what those black politicians wanted.  It was blacks, and their white liberal advocates, who pushed for the &#8220;voting rights&#8221; laws that mandate gerrymandering districts so that there are enough blacks in some of them to guarantee that black candidates win.  The logic behind that is interesting   &mdash;   it is an admission that race is all important   &mdash;   not economics, not class, not war vs. peace, not jobs vs. environment, but race.  Given the choice of a black to vote for, blacks will vote for blacks, period.  Nobody was surprised that 95% of the black votes in the presidential election went to Obama.  Blacks were not called racist for such a lopsided turnout, as whites would be.  That race is central to politics is what many race realists have been saying for years, while the Tim Wises of the world insist that race doesn&rsquo;t matter, it is class and economics that really divides us, and only neo-Nazis could argue otherwise.  The liberals and the blacks who pushed for those voting rights laws agreed with us whether they want to admit it or not.</p>
<p>Where is the black candidate calling for limited, Constitutional government?  For abolishing the Department of Education, phasing out handouts, balancing the budget, deporting illegal immigrants, and eliminating all racial preferences in government hiring and allocation of contracts?  There isn&rsquo;t one.  That&rsquo;s why I won&rsquo;t vote for blacks.</p>

I would suggest that it is exactly the results of Obama&rsquo;s victory that is causing voters to avoid other black politicians.</p>

		<p>The REAL fantasyland is believing that ANY black candidate is competent to do the job, and that any black candidate could perform in a racially un-biased manner.  That fantasy was put to rest once and for all by the election of Barack Obama.  There will be no blacks getting elected on HIS coat tails.  People have now had a perfect look at what black politicians really are: incompetent, bitter, white hating, welfare statist, anti-American, often muslim leaning, Marxists out of the Highlander or Alinsky school.</p>

		<p>I think Whites have had their fill of black politicians and want their own people in office.  It&rsquo;s not a good strategy for a White liberal to vote for a black politician with the changing demographics.  They get into office and put their own people in positions, many that are permanent until they retire, and create a hegemony against the White liberal power structure.  I would hope conservatives are a little bit smarter with examples like Michael Steele and Colin Powell and how disastrous they&rsquo;ve been for the Republican Party.    </p>

		<p>Deval Patrick is still far from a sure thing, in my opinion.  A Rasmussen poll shows him at 45% and the Republican candidate at 31%, but there&rsquo;s an ex-Dem indie who has 14%, and 10% is undecided.  Patrick has suffered such decreasing support that I figured he was goner.  <br>
And what liberal claptrap about black pols being unable to build wider coalitions because they&rsquo;re in gerrymandered black-majority districts!  Any representative who desires to build statewide support has to campaign outside his district, regardless of his ethnicity!  The article makes it sound like black elected officials have somehow been ghettoized into particular regions and are unable to move into other districts from which to run.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Obama&rsquo;s Win Apparently Hasn&rsquo;t Helped Black Politicians in Campaigns&#8221;</p>
<p>And why would it?  His campaign rhetoric has been revealed as nothing more than the worst lies by any politician in recent history except to people who are either mentally challenged or just plain ignorant and misinformed.</p>
<p>If his school records and writings were not guarded like the information during the Manhattan Project, I&rsquo;m pretty sure they would reveal someone who was a mediocre student at best, and, of course, his books have already been exposed as blatant scams, authored by the little twerp with the coke bottle glasses, Wm. Ayres.</p>
<p>As much as I dislike this man, and his evil intent, I have to admit he has a likable personality, which wins people over, except for those who remind themselves this man is no more than a pro-black, anti-white America hater that wants to create a society where blacks are awarded positions and power without being qualified or having to work for them.  He does that, because only in a controlled, bean counting society will blacks EVER achieve anything on their own except in very small numbers.</p>
<p>If he were really bright he could see that his work is for naught, because such advancements for blacks on a forced basis is unsustainable.</p>
<p>Too, I&rsquo;ve observed, and listened carefully to, the community organizer and his administration on video and T.V. very closely, and I think it&rsquo;s plain to anyone with good perceptive abilities that these people are very good at campaign rhetoric, because it has been rehearsed so many times, but when they have to conduct themselves or think out of this tight kind of propaganda box they&rsquo;ve created they&rsquo;re absolutely clueless.  </p>
<p>And keep me in mind if the community organizer ever screws up numerous times in close sequence. We will all witness what inability really is.  Under great pressure he will crack badly, and his gaffs and inanities will come one after another for all to see.  Remember I said it first.</p>
