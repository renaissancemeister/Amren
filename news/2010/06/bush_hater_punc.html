<h1><a href="https://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=165201">&#8216;Bush Hater&rsquo; Punches GOP Official at Tea Party</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chelsea Schilling, WorldNetDaily, June 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A local GOP chairman and author of &#8220;The Beast on the East River&#8221; received an unexpected blow to the face during a June 8 tea party by a man who blamed former President George W. Bush &#8220;for the mess we&rsquo;re in.&#8221;</p>
<p>The incident took place during a rally outside Democrat Rep. Mel Watt&rsquo;s office in Greensboro, N.C.</p>
<p>Nathan Tabor is Forsyth Republican Party chairman, former candidate for Congress in North Carolina and North Carolina Senate and founder of TCVmedia.com and TheConservativeVoice.com. He was also the webmaster for the presidential campaign of Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tabor blocked attacker Govenor Spencer of Greensboro when he lunged toward Tabor&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&rsquo;t touch my property again, and don&rsquo;t push me again&#8221; Tabor said.</p>
<p>According to Human Events, the aggressor, a black man in his &rsquo;50s, responded, &#8220;Then get the f  &mdash;  - out.&#8221;</p>
<p>He lunged toward Tabor and punched him in the face.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tabor said he stopped recording at the conclusion of the protest and walked toward his wife and daughter near the sidewalk.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I walked around the corner, this gentleman pushed me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And when he pushed me the first time, I turned my camera on and brought my camera up. I said please don&rsquo;t push me. And when I said that, he slapped my camera. He pushes me again. In the video you can see my body fall back. And I did not say anything to him, I didn&rsquo;t engage him. I wasn&rsquo;t going to, until he touched me wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tabor told WGHP-TV Spencer had pushed his wife, so he pushed Spencer back. That&rsquo;s when Spencer lunged toward him and punched him in the face.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The blog BigGovernment.com noted that Spencer is a union organizer and a black liberation activist who led the Greensboro K-Mart protests of 1995. Spencer had a black liberation flag bumper sticker on his car.</p>

		<p>Whew!  For a minute, I was afraid this was a Racist attack.  But now that I know the attacker was black, I feel much better.  As we all know, no Person Of Colour can be Racist.</p>
<p>And since the attack wasn&rsquo;t Racist, I guess the controlled governmedia will feel no need to give this incident any wide distribution, will they?<br>

		<p>Can you imagine what would happen to a lone White man if he disrupted a black gathering and punched one in the face! But, of course, the White &#8220;boy&#8221; that got punched just ducked and ran off like a little girl. At the VERY least, that thug should&rsquo;ve been knocked to the ground and held until the police got there. How that thug got to disrupt this gathering, assault someone and then just casually drive off is beyond me.    </p>

		<p>Hmmm?? Outside Mel Watt&rsquo;s office 25 people gather to protest and out of nowhere a concerned citizen intervenes and no Greensboro PD gumshoes on site?? </p>
<p>But one look at Mel Watt and it all falls into to place as neat as Eric Holder and the Philly NBP polling place thugs. Mel Watt&rsquo;s legislative assistant didn&rsquo;t get nervous over 25 angry White folks chanting outside her window and dial 911, the assistant had someone else on speed dial  &mdash;   that&rsquo;s plain to see.  </p>

		<p>It is possible that if he fights back then HE is likely to face some sort of charges as well. Any more if someone is assaulted and defends himself (or his wife in this case) both parties are charged with assault. The better thing to do if faced with this situation is to fend off the attack with like force and leave the scene. It helps if you have a video of the incident.</p>

		<p>Can you imagine a White man in a Black crowd going up and punching a Black man in the face during any kind of a rally by and for Black people?  Every single Black would attack him and most likely kill him.  And then the media would shout, &#8220;White racist attacks Black man fighting for civil rights&#8221;.</p>
<p>You know it.</p>

We will continue to hear about the [unidentified as a black] man who carried the rifle at the Tea Party Rally but this won&rsquo;t make news.</p>

		<p>@ comment #3:</p>
<p>And when you click that wikipedia link to Congressman Watt, make sure you take notice and read the &#8220;Ralph Nader Incident&#8221; that is recounted there.  Interesting.  Sounds like maybe Watt was acting out against some egotistical white people again.</p>

		<p>Bush might have some responsibility for the mess we&rsquo;re in, but he had a Democrat-controlled House and Senate helping screw things up, and those same people are still running the House and Senate.</p>

		<p>Sometimes I understand why white girls are attracted to black men. The big tall white guy ran away from an old black man after he punched him in front of his wife. i&rsquo;m not saying he should have pummeled the black guy, but be a man instead of an overgrown baby. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d say that returning blows after attacked would have landed the white man in jail with a hate crimes charge.  I suspect that often whites will turn away from confrontation not from fear of taking a beating but from fear of the (in)justice system.</p>

		<p>Why is no one commenting on the cowardice of Tabor and the other teabaggers? He hid behind the skirts of his wife like a b****. Spartan, you need to change your handle if the first thing that you would consider when a man lays his hands on you or your wife is what legal consequences defending yourself or wife would have. Tabor is like the rest of the &#8220;men&#8221; in the republican establishment, NO HEART. That is why the republicans are exlusively running women for the senate. The women have more testoserone than the men.</p>

		<p>Watch America fall. No one does anything about it. 12 percent of the country has the majority of the other 88 percent in fear. I am ashamed of whites in this country. We built this country and now we stand idly by while minorities rip it away from us. In 100 years we will an after thought</p>
