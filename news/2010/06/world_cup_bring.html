			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hector Becerra, Los Angeles Times, June 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Mexican flag is back on the streets of Los Angeles after several years of political exile.</p>
<p>Four years ago, Miguel Haro was among half a million people who marched for immigrant rights in downtown L.A. At the urging of organizers and Spanish-language disc jockeys, he left his Mexican flag at home and waved an American flag instead.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But with the World Cup in full swing, Haro proudly has affixed his Mexican flag to his Toyota RAV4 and cheered for the team of his parents. The American flag is fine for politics, he said, but this is soccer.</p>
<p>&#8220;My allegiance is to America, no doubt about it, and I&rsquo;d think I wouldn&rsquo;t have to prove it,&#8221; said Haro, a 25-year-old utility worker. &#8220;But when I wave the Mexican flag for soccer, it&rsquo;s strictly cultural. It&rsquo;s showing I&rsquo;m proud of my Mexican background.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The red, white and green banners hang from cars on the freeway, wave inside countless bars and eateries during games and are even held proudly by cyclists riding through downtown L.A.</p>
<p>With the Mexican team having survived preliminary rounds and scheduled to play Sunday against Argentina in the Round of 16, fan loyalty  &mdash;  and flags  &mdash;  are likely to be at a highly visible peak.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During the World Cup, sales have been brisk for South Korean flags as well as countries with big soccer followings such as Brazil, England and Spain. Displays of those banners are largely noncontroversial.</p>
<p>But the Mexican flag is different. The American political debate over immigration  &mdash;  illegal immigration in particular  &mdash;  is largely a debate over Mexicans. And few symbols in that debate have carried as much political weight as the Mexican flag.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Showing your heritage during a sports event,&#8221; he added, &#8220;is very different than showing your heritage in a controversial way during a political demonstration.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Activist Javier Rodriguez, 60, said he didn&rsquo;t argue for replacing the Mexican flag with the American one at major rallies. But he was not happy about how the Mexican flag came to be demonized by some.</p>
<p>&#8220;The flag just infuriates the other side,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Rodriguez said immigrant-rights organizers have debated the polarizing effect the Mexican flag has at large gatherings since at least 1994, when Proposition 187 was on the ballot. But the 2006 downtown rally was the most dramatic example of the move to replace the Mexican flag with the American flag at rallies because the event was so well organized and received so much media attention.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jorge Ramos, a 41-year-old fast-food worker, walked underneath a replica facade of the governor&rsquo;s mansion in Guadalajara in Plaza Mexico, toward a rendition of the Angel of Independence statue in Mexico City. His sons, ages 3, 5 and 10, clutched Mexican flags.</p>
<p>&#8220;It reminds me that we&rsquo;re far from home, but we always have Mexico in our heart,&#8221; Ramos said. &#8220;We&rsquo;re here, and we have to become accustomed to this country. My children are American, and this country has given us so much, but they have Mexican roots, and they shouldn&rsquo;t forget that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Support for the AZ law of May 2010 can be explained as a delayed response to the May Day 2006 brandishing of hate speech against the diverse white American peoples as well as the public demand for the concept of two nations in one country, much like Canada, Belgium, Israel, and other countries with a bicultural society.  </p>
<p>In Canada&rsquo;s case, it&rsquo;s French speaking and English speaking segments; in Belgium&rsquo;s case, it&rsquo;s Dutch speaking and French speaking segments; and in Israel&rsquo;s case, it&rsquo;s Hebrew speaking and Arabic speaking segments.  Advocating two-language cultures into the USA is something that finally caught up with the Spanish advocates in Arizona in May 2006, just four years later.  </p>
<p>The Arizona law is entirely justified by the radical demands made on May Day 2006 which have never been repudiated by any responsible Latino leader in the USA.</p>

<p>Only a fool or an idiot would celebrate and honor the flag of a country that treats them so badly they have to flee the country in order to earn a living, because the richest country in Latin America spends no more on its citizens than Haiti, and requires its peons to beg for permission to dig through the state dump.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for certain the Mexican narco government is glad to have their worst people leave the country, so they can get rid of their worst elements.</p>

<p>This is all correct. Those disc jockeys, what they call them, all across the nation [U.S.], had URGED the partipants NOT to fly the Mexican flag. These disc jockeys knew full well what the reaction would be. And YET, among the &#8220;protestors&#8221;, the reverse happened, it was a SEA of Mexican flags. A deliberate and spontaneous provocation deliberately intended to infuriate. And it did infuriate. And with good reason. It was a DELIBERATE PROVOCATION, IN-YOUR-FACE-WE-SPIT-ON-YOU!!</p>
<p>And they were so proud to do so too. After all, these are a proud people. We cannot deny them their pride. After all, they are so proud!</p>

		<p>Every time I see one of those Mexican flag being flown by these ignorant, violent, and vile invaders from south of our undefended border, I wipe down and oil my weapons. This is a provocation, just as their violence against my race is another provocation. The Mexicans who do this are very stupid and ignorant people, they don&rsquo;t realize how whites perceive their actions. The day is going to be soon where any Mexican flying a flag publicly will be deservedly shot and killed by enraged whites wielding military weapon. I personally think the Mexicans invaders are going to get a terrifyingly rude awakening how cruel, dangerous and merciless whites really are when battle&rsquo;s joined. By then, it will be too late for compromise or burying the hatchet, whites like myself want them gone, dead or both.</p>

		<p>I wonder how it would go over with the liberals if German-Americans carried the Nazi flag during the World Cup!  But, not to worry, Obama will ban the Mexican flag in the U.S. as soon as Mexico asks him to.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget how Mexico was created. It was one expansive nation, the Spanish Empire, conquering another expansive nation, the Aztec Empire. Mexican mestizos are mixtures of both. As one can expect, they have deception, territorial claims, conquest, and expansion in their genes.</p>
<p>If the U.S were in the same league, we would have conquered half of the world shortly after WWII when we had a monopoly on A-bomb. In fact, when one compares the history of the U.S. and the history of Mexico, it must be clear to a honest and intelligent student that the attitudes of prevailing populations in these regions were poles apart. One of consequences of these differences are the results: the U.S. is law-abiding and prosperous while Mexico is crime-driven, corrupt, and insolvent.</p>
<p>One more reason to object putting all whites, particularly Anglos and Spaniards, into the same category. There is no reason why should we accept any guilt for what Spanish conquistadors did to the &#8220;indigenous&#8221; populations. Mexicans, if they had any decency and brains, should direct their grievances to Spain and its remainders in Mexico (most of their ruling elite are white Spaniards), and NOT to the U.S.<br>

Yes they are. I tend to believe that the things Mexicans in the US do which infuriate us anglos   &mdash;   including but by no means limited to flying or waving a FOREIGN flag in our country   &mdash;   are done not out of malice but only out of lack of intelligence. White Americans, averaging 100 IQs, don&rsquo;t need to be told that if they went to, say, France and started waving US flags and boasting about taking over the country, the French would resent it. Yet a majority of Mexicans   &mdash;   with their median IQ 10+ points lower   &mdash;   really don&rsquo;t seem to possess the (fairly minimal) reasoning powers to understand that them doing these things in the US would spur resentment from Americans. </p>
<p>Some of the more radical Reconquista types might <i>deliberately</i> seek to provoke or annoy us, but I believe your average Juan or Juanita has an &#8220;absence of malice&#8221; because they are genuinely too dull-witted and logic-impaired to recognize that their actions are offensive. </p>
<p>Remember: Empathy correlates strongly with intelligence. The more intelligent you are, the better you&rsquo;re able to see another&rsquo;s POV; to put yourself in another&rsquo;s shoes. Lower mestizo intelligence means lower levels of empathy; less caring for others; less ability to &#8220;relate&#8221; to situations outside of their own personal experiences. They literally CAN&rsquo;T imagine how it feels in your shoes   &mdash;   the abstract reasoning and &#8220;higher-brain&#8221; theorizing necessary to do so is simply <i>beyond their cognitive abilities.</i> </p>
<p>Broad strokes: they&rsquo;re not malicious, they&rsquo;re just not very smart.  </p>
