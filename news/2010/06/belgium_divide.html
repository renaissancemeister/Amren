<h1><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jun/14/belgium-election-result-flemish-triumph">Belgium Divide Deepens After Flemish Separatists Win Election</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jenny Percival, Guardian (London), June 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A rightwing separatist party that wants independence for the Dutch-speaking region of northern Belgium has won a shock victory in the country&rsquo;s general election.</p>
<p>The New Flemish Alliance (NVA) is on course to become the largest party in parliament  &mdash;  the first time in Belgium&rsquo;s 180-year history that a Flemish nationalist party has gained more seats than the traditional federalist parties.</p>
<p>Early results suggest the NVA scored a record 29% of the vote in Dutch-speaking Flanders, while the French-speaking Socialists got the largest share of the vote  &mdash;  36%  &mdash;  in Wallonia which has fewer voters.</p>
<p>Talks underway today on forming a coalition are likely to force the NVA to tone down its nationalist rhetoric but the party&rsquo;s victory could lead to greater autonomy for Dutch and French speaking regions. King Albert, as head of state, was holding one-on-one meetings with political leaders.</p>
<p>As many as eight parties could make up the new government. In 2007, those talks lasted more than six months.</p>
<p>There are fears that protracted negotiations and the formation of a potentially unstable, high-spending coalition could upset the markets. The country&rsquo;s ratio of debt to gross domestic product is behind only Greece and Italy in the eurozone.</p>
<p>Belgium is also preparing to take over the presidency of the European Union in July.</p>
<p>Divisions between the 6.5 million Dutch speakers in Flanders and the 4 million French speakers in Wallonia in the poorer south of the country have caused decades of disputes which permeate every aspect of Belgian society: there are separate language sections of almost every organisation from Scouts and charities, such as the Red Cross, to national political parties.</p>
<p>The NVA&rsquo;s victory on Sunday, winning 27 seats in the 150-member assembly, up 19 from the 2007 elections, was a shock to the Belgian political world.</p>
<p>Voters rejected prime minister Yves Leterme&rsquo;s outgoing coalition of Christian Democrats, Liberals and Socialists  &mdash;  each split into French and Dutch speaking sections  &mdash;  whose three years in power were marked by linguistic spats that remained unresolved.</p>
<p>The election outcome was seen as a warning to French-speaking politicians to negotiate seriously about granting Dutch and French-speakers more self-rule, or Dutch-speaking Flanders would seek independence.</p>
<p>The Francophone daily Le Soir said &#8220;Flanders has chosen a new king&#8221;, referring to Bart de Wever, 39, the NVA leader and a potential new Belgian prime minister, who urged &#8220;Francophones to make (a country) that works&#8221;.</p>
<p>De Wever seeks an orderly breakup of Belgium. His party accuses French-speaking Wallonia of poor governance that has raised the unemployment rate to double that of Flanders. In Wallonia the Socialists, traditionally a dominant force in the south, did well  &mdash;  winning 26 seats, up six from 2007.</p>
<p>Party leader, Elio di Rupo, another candidate to be prime minister, said: &#8220;Many Flemish people want the country&rsquo;s institutions reformed. We need to listen to that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flanders and Wallonia already have autonomy in urban development, environment, agriculture, employment, energy, culture, sports and other areas.</p>
<p>Flemish parties demand that justice, health and social security are added to that, but Walloon politicians fear ending social security as a federal responsibility will mark the end of Belgium.</p>
<p>The divide goes beyond language. Flanders is conservative and free-trade minded. Wallonia&rsquo;s long-dominant Socialists have a record of corruption and poor governance. Flanders has half the unemployment of Wallonia and a 25% higher per-capita income, and its politicians say they are tired of subsidising their French-speaking neighbours.</p>
<p>As governments worldwide tried to tame a financial crisis and recession, the four parties that led Belgium since 2007 struggled with linguistic spats, most notably over a bilingual voting district comprising the capital, Brussels, and 35 Flemish towns bordering it.</p>
<p>The high court ruled it illegal in 2003 because Dutch is the only official language in Flanders. Over the years, Francophones from Brussels have moved in large numbers to the city&rsquo;s leafy Flemish suburbs, where they are accused of refusing to learn Dutch and integrate.<br>

		<p>The country is divided between Flemish and Walloons, with a smidgeon of Germans near the border, and the differences are significan, but the most important thing about the entire incident&hellip;.which holds true around the world&hellip;.any group of homogeneous people who want to secede should be allowed to do so.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure there will be a lot of the same thing right here in the US in the VERY NEAR future.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s really none of my business, as a foreigner, whether Belgium breaks up or not, nor do I have any strong feelings on the subject. But this saga has been dragging on for as long as I can remember, which is a very long time, and I don&rsquo;t understand why two peoples who so clearly wish to live apart cannot simply have an amicable divorce. After all, the Czechs and Slovaks did it and there do not seem to have been any bad after effects. </p>

Western Europe is doing to itself what the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact never could. All this without one shot being fired.</p>

		<p>There are probably some Amren readers who believe that all of America&rsquo;s problems would be solved, if we got rid of all the non-whites living in America. Often, I have read posts hinting at what a paradise America would be, if there were no blacks and mestizos in this country. How do they explain that, for most of European history, whites slaughtered each other on a massive scale?</p>
<p>If there were no blacks or mestizos in America, some white ethnic group would have been singled out to play the role of the blacks. Every multi-ethnic society needs a despised ethnic group to play the role of the national scapegoat. It is possible that Irish Catholics, Italians or Scotch-Irish, would have played the role of the blacks, in the absence of actual blacks. French-Canadians are the blacks of Canada. Irish-Catholics are the blacks of Northern Ireland. And, as we are seeing in Belgium, the Walloons are the welfare queens of Belgium.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m all for an independent Flanders. The Flemish were shot-gun married to the Walloons by the British and have been held back ever since by it. The French-speaking Walloons have allowed Flanders to be flooded with Arabs to dilute Flanders Dutch heritage. A short-sighted, cut off your nose to spite your face strategy, if ever there was one. </p>

<p>Interesting start of a discussion, but just a start, I think.  Certainly, Christians would fall back into quarreling with one another they way they were in the first couple centuries of Christianity, as well as most of the other Christian dominated periods of Western history.  Remember that by the time of the Civil War, every little dell in the Appalachians had a different denomination of church, so that when the war broke out, people went in all directions, and so often faced one another across that &#8220;deadly space.&#8221;  Not exactly the Christian ideal - or is it?</p>
<p>Well, today they are all united as angry Christian Conservatives, but not destined for greatness or success, I&rsquo;d bet.</p>
<p>Looking deeper, it is Christianity that got Europeans fighting one another.  Before Rome&rsquo;s intrusions to the north, those lands were settled and happy regions, enjoying their own homeostasis of culture.  Christianity promised to set son to rise up against his father, and brother to fight against his brother.  The Christian European epic certainly fulfills this promise, supposedly made by Jesus himself, as did our own CW.  And what was that for?</p>
<p>But also I think you are incorrect about an ethnic groups always being chosen for oppression and to be scapegoats.  Actually, more often, it is the poor are the ones chosen.  There is no denying the class distinction in civilized hierarchy.  Just look at Medieval Europe.  Look at the history of Russia.  If you get bored with that, look to non-white regions before large population shifts.  It is more complicated than just ethnic groups or even just class.  But when a religion sets up distinctions, like the Caste system in India, it is creating inequalities that eventually lead to rebellion and wars, even wars of invasion and occupation.  (Think about that one).  Maybe this can&rsquo;t be avoided where humans are concerned, and we are stuck in a cycle.</p>
<p>The larger issue is whether whites can succeed alone.  I think we can if we do not make impossible demands on ourselves.  I think half the habitual posters on Amren - at least, cannot fathom a white movement that isn&rsquo;t a Bible thumping, hellfire preaching, gaggle of angry - and confused people who couldn&rsquo;t make room for the sort of minds that have actually been responsible for the advances and leaps of genius that actually made whites so unstoppable in the past.  I hope that there is more intelligent thought going on out there than it seems.  I hope we can proceed intelligently.<br>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if your a troll but I must respond to your post. The historical violence in Europe was not rooted in race but there were other factors, like religion, ethnicity and power-politics. The multitude of languages also didn&rsquo;t help, a problem America doesn&rsquo;t face (yet). Add to this the fact that Europe is a small, densely crowded continent with limited resources. It also faced predatory foes from abroad. To the east were the Mongols and other Asiatics. The Iberian peninsula had to endure seven centuries of Islamic enslavement from the Moors, while the Balkans and much of east-central Europe was menaced for several centuries by the Ottomans. None of this was the fault of Europeans. By the way your comment about French-Canadians being &#8220;the blacks of Canada&#8221; is absolutely ridiculous. Its obvious to me you don&rsquo;t know anything about Canada at all in saying that. There has NEVER been a single non-Francophone premier of Quebec (imagine South Carolina NEVER having a non-black governor) and Canada has had many Francophone prime ministers, going as far back as the 19th century. Francophones are over-represented at all levels of the Canadian federal government. Your comment is absolutely asinine. </p>

            You&rsquo;re attempt to compare the Walloons to American blacks or insult them as &#8216;welfare queens&rsquo; is completely wrong and ignorant.<br>
 In all probability you know very little about the Walloons or Belgium, or of Belgium&rsquo;s history.Suffice to say until very recently Wallonia was the economic powerhouse of Belgium that kept national rvenues going - it had a very well developed coal mining and iron and steel industry, unfortunately these industries have largely been destroyed with no replacements found.<br>
  The real issue is that the Flemings feel that their national culture was been undermined, to the threat of extinction, by the rise of the French language.</p>

		<p>The liberals always seem to support national ethnic separatism when the group that wants it is perceived to be an underdog.  Seldom, if ever, will a Germanic group (which includes the English and Dutch) be deemed as such by the left, so the latter will probably oppose Belgium separation.   <br>
It would be interesting to see what liberals would say if the majority of Mexican-Americans wanted to separate and settle in one of the states.  Of course, many lefties wouldn&rsquo;t openly acknowledge the drive toward reconquista, but most behave as though minorities are never wrong.</p>

My understanding is that this group, a new party carefully  avoiding all  hints of racism, has moved in and seized the victory, taking advantage of all the work done by the (more nationalistic, hence less respectable) anti-immigrant,  &#8220;Vlaams Belang&#8221; party.   </p>
<p>This strikes me as very analogous to the way Sarkozy, posing as a tough rightist, took the election away from LePen and the Front National in France.</p>
<p>The Vlaams Belang is never mentioned in the press without the scare words &#8220;far right&#8221; preceeding it.  I notice that the Vlaams Belang is  <i>not even mentioned   in this article! </i></p>
<p>  &#8220;When the far-right Vlaams Belag proposed such a referendum in the Flemish regional Parliament in early September, not one other Flemish party was willing even to debate the issue.&#8221; [Arab News] </p>

<p>The description of French-Canadians as the &#8220;blacks of Canada&#8221; is not something that I made up in my mind. The term was first used by the late Quebecois journalist and activist, Pierre Vallieres (1938 - 1998). Vallieres was a prominent journalist, who was often described as the Malcolm X of the French-Canadians. British-Canadians viewed him as a radical, but he was regarded as a mainstream and respected figure in Quebec. In 1968, Vallieres published a book about his people and his struggle, called &#8220;White Negroes of America&#8221;. He didn&rsquo;t actually use the term &#8220;Negroes&#8221;, but Amren is a respectable family-friendly website, which forbids the use of the term in question. Here is Vallieres&rsquo; wikipedia entry:  </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Valli%C3%A8res" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Valli%C3%A8res</a></p>
<p>Historically, French-Canadians suffered massive discrimination, even within Quebec itself, when the province was under greater British-Canadian control. This explains why one of the major parties in the province, the Parti Quebecois, has demanded independence from Canada. The fact that some anglicized French-Canadians have held high office, does not change the reality of past discrimination. British-Canadians even established their own chapters of the Ku Klux Klan in Canada in the 1920s, in imitation of the American Klan revival in that decade. The Canadian chapters of the Klan organized boycotts of French-Canadian businesses, in protest against Catholic influence on Protestant Canada. Poverty rates among French-Canadians have historically been higher, and their educational levels are lower, than those of the Anglo-Canadians.</p>
<p>Obviously, the income and education gap among the white ethnic groups of Canada, is not as great as that between whites and blacks in America. It is closer to the gap between the Protestants and the Catholics in Northern Ireland. But as I said before, in any multi-ethnic society, some group has to play the role of the blacks. </p>

		<p>After Czechoslovakia&rsquo;s peaceful breakup and Yugoslavia&rsquo;s extremely bloody one, the concept that the multiethnic superstate doesn&rsquo;t work very well - even when the members of differing groups actually look alike - should come as no suprise to anyone.  Switzerland - the major exception - works because the various cantons are internally ethnically homogenous, and the central government allows the individual cantons a lot of local autonomy.</p>

		<p>Will Flanders revert to becoming a Dutch principality then or stand on it&rsquo;s own?</p>
<p>Is there enough economic resources for the split to be &#8216;amicable&rsquo; as one poster suggested or will one popgroup end up suffering?</p>
<p>If they are truly going to engineer further micro-fracturization of Europe into yet -smaller- feudal city states (all clamoring to be seen as &#8216;nations&rsquo;), we really should pay attention to the outcomes as much as the motivations likely to result.</p>
<p>What made American great was indeed Ethnic Homogeny within our borders: E Pluribus Unum.  But the effects were as much strategic as social given we are the SOLE nation state to have achieved what could be thought of as political homeostacy rather than simply a population driven one.</p>
<p>Balkanization, into a land of whites, asians, mexicans and blacks, even if only as dictated by &#8216;freedom to associate&rsquo; lines on a map, would destroy our sum economic and strategic power.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt the mainly pro-EU Wallonians have been encouraging many French-speaking Muslims &amp; Africans to settle around Brussels &amp; this has antagonised already tense relations between Flemish &amp; Wallonians who seemingly have never gottern along since the formation of Belgium. It seems the two are destined for a divorce which must be causing the EU controllers in Brussels absolute nightmares. How can the EU continue to demand people accept a multicultural EUSSR that is importing millions of Third World immigrants, when the two native groups in the small country hosting the EU capital can&rsquo;t even get along.</p>
<p>Alongside the ongoing financial crisis with the euro &amp; Geert Wilders nationalist Freedom Party in Holland having 24 members elected in last Thursday&rsquo;s national elections, it will be wonderful to watch the EU Marxists/globalists continue to squirm as European voters finally start to awaken &amp; take revenge on the pro-EU Marxist/globalist political cabal who have destroyed the sovereignty of European nation-states &amp; now attempt to save their multicultural EUSSR Federal Superstate from destruction.</p>

		<p>In the hypothetical event of Flanders gaining independence it is highly unlikely that it would ever be incorporated into Holland as it is so overwhelmingly catholic,which puts it into a similar position to Austria&rsquo;s historic relationship with Germany.This would be the Netherlands loss,as they would be gaining six million ethnic Dutch,or roughly twice the number of third-worlders currently occupying Holland. </p>
