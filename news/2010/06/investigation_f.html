			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lindsay Fergus, Belfast Telegraph, June 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A formal investigation into the role of the recruitment sector in the employment of migrant workers in Northern Ireland has found non-nationals are being discriminated against.</p>
<p>The findings are revealed today in an Equality Commission for Northern Ireland report entitled &#8216;The Role of the Recruitment Sector in the Employment of Migrant Workers&rsquo;.</p>
<p>During its 21 months of research, the commission spoke to migrant workers, the majority of which were eastern European nationals, recruitment agencies across Northern Ireland and employers.</p>
<p>Those findings include:</p>
<p>* Participants encountered barriers to equality of opportunity for those using the recruitment sector.</p>
<p>* Irregularity of work.</p>
<p>* Large amounts of money being paid in their native countries to find work which was not as expected.</p>
<p>* Poor employment practices.</p>
<p>* Securing predominantly low paid work.</p>
<p>* Difficulties in having qualifications gained outside the UK recognised by employers.</p>
<p>Other findings revealed more than half of migrant workers had used the recruitment sector, and recruitment agencies reported a high proportion of migrant workers registered with them, in some cases more than 80%.</p>
<p>Of those participants using the recruitment sector, just 27% had gone on to find direct employment with 52% remaining as agency workers and 21% no longer working. And 60% of participants reported experiencing difficulties with pay.</p>
<p>One migrant worker said: &#8220;We paid €600 to the agency (in their own country) and then £500 to a contact in the UK who said he would get us work documents. We never got these. We knew only we would be doing unskilled work in Belfast. We work on a farm and the job is not what we expected.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another recounted: &#8220;We have trouble getting holiday pay from the agency. They don&rsquo;t want to speak to us about it. They said that if we don&rsquo;t like it we could always go back home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob Collins, chief commissioner said: &#8220;The investigation found areas of good practice in the recruitment sector, on the part of government agencies and among community support groups.</p>
<p>&#8220;The investigation also found that while there is a considerable body of legislation governing the recruitment sector, not all recruitment agencies work within its terms, and barriers to equality of opportunity do exist for those who use their services.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the key challenges for Northern Ireland is to ensure that those who come to live here are treated with dignity and fairness, that their contribution to the economy and to wider society are recognised and that they are accorded the same respect and value that people from Northern Ireland expect when they go abroad to live and work.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;The Commission will take appropriate action to address the issues highlighted and to ensure that its recommendations are highlighted.&#8221;<br>

		<p>&#8220;Immigrants to Ireland complain about jobs and pay.&#8221;</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t like their jobs and pay right now, all they have to do is wait anywhere from 3 to 6 months and they won&rsquo;t have either.</p>
<p>Ireland cannot pay its debts.  They&rsquo;re way over extended, almost as bad as Greece, but they&rsquo;re still declining.</p>
<p>The European Union in all likelihood will disintegrate, and the Euro as a currency will collapse as well.  Too, let me interject that these are not my evaluations. Any economist worth his salt is telling us exactly that.  They&rsquo;ll also add that when the money Greece borrowed runs out, they&rsquo;ll be back in the streets only this time there won&rsquo;t be any money to bail them out.  The German Chancellor, Merkel, said that also. </p>
<p>The protestors can tear down everything in sight, but it won&rsquo;t do anything but make them poorer.  They&rsquo;re going to have to stop their cradle to grave nanny state.  It&rsquo;s over for all of them.</p>
<p>Ireland will have to plummet all the way down to unheard of austere levels. (Sorry diversitoids no more immigrants.  The ones here will be hold up in some kind of makeshift stronghold, before much longer, trying to keep from being eaten.)  Spain, too.  And Portugal.  Especially the UK.  And France is going to have 5 million Muslims burning and rioting every night of the week.  Their average vehicle burning of 100 cars per night will sky rocket in numbers, right along with armed insurrection.  </p>
<p>And believe it or not, that economic titan Germany will have many busy people looking for the ones who saddled them with third world hordes, because they will be just as strapped for cash as the rest.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be chuckling a lot for quite a while, in spite of the fact that this severe situation will be affecting me as well.</p>
<p>Sorry, but I just can&rsquo;t help it.  These brilliant minds on the radical left, and within these money-grubbing corporations, who stupidly saw the entire global economy growing and enriching them and their heirs with money and power for this entire century are going to watch their hare-brained schemes come apart in living color.  </p>
<p>Well, their number one concern was eternal economic growth, but their diversity schemes changed it all to unending economic depression.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll have to continue on with another idiotic saying that is just the opposite of reality, like &#8220;Poverty is our strength,&#8221; and there will be a few white fools who will be frothing at the mouth if anybody tries to discredit something as preposterous as that as if it is an absolute truism.<br>

		<p>Irish are leaving the country in search of work in North America.</p>
<p>A Third World non-white will take any job in Ireland just to get a foot into the white Western world. The payoff for him isn&rsquo;t the substandard wages for digging potatoes, it&rsquo;s the opportunity to leave his spawn permanently anchored in the First World.</p>
<p>As for the Eastern Europeans, they just want to be deeper into the West, because we have a more developed social safety net.<br>

Belfast is geographically a part of the island of Ireland. It is temporally a part of the U.K.. A matter which will be remedied in the near future since the United Kingdom will cease to exist within the next few decades. The U.K. will go the way of Austria-Hungary.</p>

<p>Belfast is part of the United Kingdom. But is it not also part of the island of Ireland?</p>

<p>Why do they call themselves &#8220;Northern Irish&#8221;, Reggie? <br>
They don&rsquo;t call themselves &#8220;Northern U.K.&#8221;</p>
