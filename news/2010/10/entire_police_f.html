			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Philip Caulfield, New York Daily News, October 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The entire police force in a small Mexican town abruptly resigned Tuesday after its new headquarters was viciously attacked by suspected drug cartel gunmen.</p>
<p>All 14 police officers in Los Ramones, a rural town in northern Mexico, fled the force in terror after gunmen fired more than 1,000 bullets and flung six grenades at their headquarters on Monday night.</p>
<p>No one was injured in the attack. Mayor Santos Salinas Garza told local media that the officers resigned because of the incident.</p>
<p>The gunmen&rsquo;s 20-minute shooting spree destroyed six police vehicles and left the white and orange police station pocked with bullet holes, the Financial Times reported.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The attack was the second in less than a week against police forces in Nuevo Leon. Last week, thugs threw two grenades at police in Sabinas Hidalgo, according to newspaper Noroeste.</p>
<p>Los Ramones is in the Mexican state of Nuevo Leon, which has been a war zone of turf violence between two of the country&rsquo;s fiercest drug gangs, the Zetas and the Gulf cartel.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mexico&rsquo;s municipal police forces often quit out of fear after being attacked by cartels.</p>

		<p>I`m not into The Sopranos or The Paisano`s or whatever they call it but this story reminds me of a mob movie I saw. The hero takes out a full page ad decalring that he WILL NOT testify against a mob boss, especially since every other witness besides him has been killed.<br>
 Late that night a package is thrown through his front window. He picks it up thinking it`s a failed time bomb only to find out it`s  $250,000 in new bills.<br>
 So, to correlate to this situation, they may be Mexican but they`re not stupid&hellip;I don`t blame them. $200.00 dollars a month is not much of a living much less a dying!</p>

		<p>  Does anyone doubt that Mexico is entirely out of control? It&rsquo;s obvious the police, such as they are, can&rsquo;t handle the cartels. The Mexican police have always been notoriously corrupt anyway. Many of the cartel shooters are ex-police and military, as everyone knows by now. Many of the people I discuss this with aren&rsquo;t concerned that the violence will spill across the border to any great extent. I don&rsquo;t under stand how someone can believe that if common people from Mexico and points south aren&rsquo;t afraid to cross our border and cause trouble, what would stop a bunch of ruthless criminals, heavily armed and with police/military training?  Not Obama/Reid/Pelosi, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>

		<p>No pity from me, you wear the bullseye, you know you&rsquo;re target practice.</p>
<p>I would however offer three opinions:</p>
<p>1.  If these guys had a target and an &#8216;the undersigned did what they did for the good of the nation&rsquo; free standing warrant, so that _they_ could be on the offense for once, I have a feeling that they would be a lot braver.  I&rsquo;m sure they know exactly where to go to send a message of their own (and don&rsquo;t think that 1,000 rounds and six grenades with six cop cars burning beats one M72 LAW or RPG-7 through the doorway if these LEOINOs were the actual targets).  But that would mean acting against 100 or more bad guys in a manner that required ambush and no quarter given.</p>
<p>2.  The drug cartels aren&rsquo;t stupid.  They know that if two lions fight to the death over one lamb, only the jackals will eat well.  As the nail which remains standing will get hammered by the Federales.  What you have to do is push one hard enough (with national forces) that the other is tempted into a takeover _regionally_.  And then smack them for it when they are the sole target.  Past which, you stand up roadblocks, isolate the country and lock down &#8216;safe zones&rsquo; where all residents are tagged on a local electronic ID database.  Anybody without a tag in a safe zone gets iced, no questions asked.</p>
<p>3.  Nobody likes airpower.  It rules the roost because, at 3-5,000ft it&rsquo;s often invisible and usually noiseless.  Which translates into first-shot advantagement.  Now that we are into &#8216;heavy fuels&rsquo; (modified diesel) on our UAVs, we can get endurances from 200,000 dollar MQ-5 Hunters up to about 14 hours.  We can also hang el-cheapo Hellfire (10,000 dollar GBU-44 Viper Strike) PGMs underwing.  If someone is standing an electronic nightwatch over these local station houses and someone else pulls up and starts unpacking ordnance, one shot _wins the battle_.  This is not jet fighter level stuff here, we can train a PFC to fly these over grown RC planes.</p>
<p>So could the Mexicans.  So could SOF -helping- the Mexicans.  Like we sent SEALs and the 7th SOG after Escobar.</p>
<p>The reason the drug trade works is because the governments on both sides of the border _let it_.  Want it to.  Period.</p>

<p>The reason the drug trade works is because of prohibition. Just like with alcohol in the 1920&rsquo;s.</p>

		<p>Nice country they have there, so close to ours.  The drug users blame the laws, but they won&rsquo;t stop using, which would do the trick as well, when it comes to stopping the violence.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t feel too bad for them.  I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll be sneaking across the amerikan &#8220;border&#8221; and applying for welfare by this time next week.<br>

		<p>Uncle Stupid is going to be faced with an interesting choice in a few short years: secure the border or let this stuff happen here in the US.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see which decision they make, but I&rsquo;m not optimistic.</p>
