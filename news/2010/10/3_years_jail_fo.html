			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jan Raath, The Australian (Sydney), October 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>IT was a miracle hailed by the authorities as a solution to Zimbabwe&rsquo;s problems.</p>
<p>Nomatter Tagarira, a spirit medium, had apparently been blessed with the power to conjure diesel from a rock  &mdash;  providing fuel for a country suffering dire shortages.</p>
<p>Unable to contain their excitement, President Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s officials invested in Tagarira&rsquo;s extraordinary abilities, lavishing her with a $2.7 million cash gift. It was more than a year before they realised they had been fooled.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Tagarira was sentenced to 39 months in jail for defrauding the government and supplying &#8220;false information to the state&#8221;, according to court documents. &#8220;Many people became gullible,&#8221; magistrate Ignatius Mugova told the court.</p>
<p>&#8220;The state channelled immense resources toward the diesel project.&#8221;</p>
<p>What Tagarira, 35, neglected to mention after revealing her supernatural abilities in 2007 was that she had earlier filled an old fuel bowser with diesel, attached a length of pipe, and hidden it. Then she let it be known to local functionaries of Mugabe&rsquo;s ZANU-PF party that ancestral spirits had given her the gift of spiriting diesel from a rock 96km north of Harare.</p>
<p>Mugabe dispatched a taskforce to investigate what was already being talked about as a source of fuel for the nation. The ministers of State Security and Defence watched as Tagarira struck the rock  &mdash;  the signal for a hidden assistant to open the tap from the bowser  &mdash;  and a fountain of diesel gushed out.</p>
<p>The ministers, accompanied by the deputy commissioner of police and an array of military commanders, removed their shoes, sat on the bare ground and clapped in unison. They returned to report to Mugabe that the nation&rsquo;s fuel problems could be at an end. Sentencing her, Mr Mugova said Tagarira had lied to the government and the people. &#8220;Her trickery brought despondency in the nation,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>At one point, ministers supplied a 50-vehicle convoy for her on a 465km trip for night-time rituals to consolidate the &#8220;project&#8221;, he said. She was flown about in air force helicopters. As well as the cash gift, she was given a farm seized from its white owner, cattle and large quantities of food. A permanent armed guard was stationed around the rock.</p>
<p>The ruse came to light after Mugabe, not entirely convinced, sent a second taskforce. This time, it reported she had &#8220;failed to prove the existence of fuel&#8221;.</p>
<p>Tagarira immediately absconded. She was caught, and escaped but was recaptured after nearly three years on the run.</p>
<p>Even after her first arrest, some remained convinced of her supernatural abilities. At her first court appearance, she went into a trance, growling apparently possessed  &mdash;  causing several spectators to flee the room.</p>

<p><br>
What Zimbabweans should be despondent about is that they live in a nation run by nincompoops. Having the diesel &#8220;divinely&#8221; flow on command from hidden pipes, is a sleight-of-hand trick that most whites would consider about on the level of a part-time children&rsquo;s entertainer who does a magic act at birthday parties. Come to think of it, I&rsquo;ve seen <i>better</i> magic tricks at children&rsquo;s birthday parties. </p>
<p>And yet this stupid stunt that some of our brighter Kindergarteners could see through, was &#8220;clever&#8221; enough to fool Robert Mugabe and his entire government into handing over $2.7M. </p>
<p>Ian Smith and the Rhodesia whites had their country taken from them for <i>this</i>. <i>This</i> is why Africa is hopeless, and will never, ever achieve an acceptable level of civilization. <i>This</i> is why our &#8220;Africa policy&#8221; should be one purely of containment and avoidance; with zero attempts at uplift or modernization. </p>
<p>Just leave &#8216;em be. Best that way. Best for <i>everybody</i>.</p>
<p>But I gotta say, the article certainly gave me some laughs   &mdash;   and the final paragraph is hilarious!</p>

		<p>Come back Doctor Watson (Nobel prize winner for genetics research), you are right after all, even the black leaders in Africa lack intelligence.  Having lived in sub Saharan Africa for 24 years, I can believe people in the West not believing this news report that I read when it occurred.  Believe it as it is totally possible.</p>

		<p>The West, it should be remembered helped put Mugabe in power.  (Britain&rsquo;s Queen Elizabeth made Mugabe an honorary knight in 1994.)</p>
<p>A BBC report on the death in 2007 of Ian Smith, the last prime minister of white-ruled Rhodesia before it became black-ruled Zimbabwe describes the result: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Ian Smith believed Africans could never run their own countries. He went to his grave convinced he was right &hellip; President Mugabe has reduced Zimbabwe to ruin, its agricultural riches destroyed, food in desperately short supply, with hyper-inflation running out of control and any and all political opposition met by violence and repression. Ian Smith felt vindicated.&#8221;</p>

<p>No wonder their nation is in such dire straits, when their government is willing to believe pagan voodoo stories about gas beign siphoned from a rock.  This on top of the fact that they have long abused their productive white population.</p>
<p>The crazy old witch wannabe who made these claims certainly deserves punishment for her trickery, but my hatred for Robert Mugabe almost makes me wish she had gotten away with it.</p>

		<p>Following the court appearance and the affect her &#8216;trance&rsquo; had on the spectators, it should come as no surprise if Nomatter manages to dematerialize herself out of jail, especially if most of her $2.7 million cash gift is safely stashed for just such an eventually as it may come in very handy to assuage the &#8216;spirits&rsquo; and aid her flight. There is no mention as to whether or not the White farmer had his property and cattle returned but perhaps he could cultivate a small plot and grow magic beans to trade for a cow or two. Uncle Bob must be really miffed by all this as he obviously did all in his power to make Zimbabwe self-sufficient in diesel fuel but &ldquo;Her trickery brought despondency in the nation,&rdquo;.. poor nation, and it was so happy and prosperous under his rule before this spirit medium committed a blatant act of treason and ruined everything by supplying &ldquo;false information to the state&rdquo;.  In a few years time, the magic diesel rock will probably become a top tourist attraction and be named &#8216;Mount Gullible&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Another piece of evidence that the adult African mind functions at a 9 year old level by white standards, that even Africa&rsquo;s leaders have IQs in the 60 &amp; 70s. </p>
<p>Yet many lib whites will read this and find a reason to blame whits (we held back their development, stopped them from choosing leaders wisely, etc. etc.).</p>
<p>Not the breathtakingly limited mental powers of blacks is the issue, but the mass psychosis of whites who will regard them as our mental equals despite the weight of evidence - and will persecute their own for speaking out of turn. <br>

		<p>They should pardon Nomatter Tagarira and make her their Queen. She is apparently the smartest person in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, folks, but I am going to once again beat that old racial-differences-in-IQ horse. Could Nomatter have worked her magic in Poland, Germany, The Netherlands or any other nation ran by White people? Definitely not. Could she have pulled it off in Liberia, Angola, Somalia or any other nation ran by Blacks? Yeah, probably.</p>
<p>Those leaders of Zimbabwe are typical of the stock from which American Blacks that have been artificially elevated in our society descended. Is it any wonder we appear to be heading toward a future that resembles the movie &#8220;Idiocracy&#8221;?</p>

		<p>A funny article. This Tagarira woman was able to con Mugabe&rsquo;s regime out of almost $ 3 million (US). Her trickery reminds me of the James Bond movie &#8220;Live and Let Die (1973), where Dr. Kanaga tricked the islanders of &#8220;San Monique&#8221; into believing in Baron Samedi rising from the grave, via an underground platform. It&rsquo;s Mugabe, of course, not Tagarira who has led the Zimbabweans in misery.</p>
<p>Why, oh why, are American churches wasting financial resources sending white missionaries into Africa, when belief in black magic and voodoo are still so prevalent at all levels, there? They&rsquo;d have better luck making a silk purse out of a sow&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>Somewhere, the Chinese are laughing at Mugabe. They&rsquo;re taking his oil and other minerals, while his stooges clap at parlor tricks by the likes of Tagarira.</p>
<p>On the other hand, look at what an oily-tongued black did in the USA in 2008.</p>

<p>No, she could not have perpetrated the scheme wherein she promised definite (if impossible results) and failed to deliver. But suppose that Nomater promised great, if vague and unmeasurable results, like enhancing human rights in energy or bringing diversity to oil production. In the liberal western world, she would have received a larger grant with no danger of disappointing her white benefactors by the lack of petroleum.</p>

		<p>LOL!  </p>
<p>What a great line:</p>
<p><i>It was a miracle hailed by the authorities as a solution to Zimbabwe&rsquo;s problems.</i></p>
<p>I just received, as a gift, to add to my coin/stamp collection, from the &#8216;Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe&rsquo; a currency bill, legal Zimbabwean tender, that states <i> I promise to pay the bearer on demand!</i>.</p>
<p>The bill is for <b>One Hundred Trillion Dollars</b>: printed thusly:  </p>
<p>100000000000000</p>
<p>(no commas or other demarkations  in original)</p>
<p>My new prized bill from Zimbabwe&rsquo;s currency came with the following note:  &#8220;The Zambian dollar is the preeminent champion of recent inflationary implosions.  Inflation has varied between 150,000% to 8.5 million percent.  On the afternoon of July 4th at 5:00 a bottle of beer could be purchased for $100 billion.  A half hour later, the price tag was $150 billion!</p>
<p>In 1980, the Zimbabwean dollar commanded $1.47 in US currency.&#8221;</p>
<p>We may laugh about 100 trillion dollar bills, but it won&rsquo;t be funny when hyperinflation happens here and we are certainly on that path.</p>
<p>Dateline Oct. 19, 2010:</p>
<p>Time Magazine Warns of Bernanke&rsquo;s and Obama&rsquo;s Hyperinflation: <i>Will the Federal Reserve Cause a Civil War?</i></p>
<p><i>Time senior writer Stephen Gandel, poses the question of whether the Federal Reserve will actually destroy the nation&hellip; says that the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Nov. 3 could be the most important meeting in Fed history, and he points to a warning&hellip; that Bernanke&rsquo;s (and Obama&rsquo;s) hyperinflationary scheme could lead to armed conflict within the U.S.</i>  </p>
<p><i>Bank of America economist David Rosenberg believes that the Fed&rsquo;s &#8216;quantitative easing&rsquo; (QE2) strategy &#8216;positions U.S. society one step closer to civil war if not worse.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p><i>Bernanke&hellip; is literally threatening those at the lower end of the economic strata, along with all who are retired, with starvation and death, and in a just nation where the rule of law controlled, instead of being abused by the kleptocrats, he would be facing charges of Seditious Conspiracy, as his policies will inevitably lead to the destruction of our republic.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>This news is not new; many economists have been reporting this for years, only to be over-ruled and sneered at by krugman-types in the NY Times and government, the Keynesians that have had the upper hand in the media for decades (and believe they are right, when, in fact, they are not, as the above Times article states).</p>
<p>John Quincy Adams stated: &#8216;All the perplexities, confusion and distress in America arise&hellip; from downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Enough Said!</p>
<p>Time to put my 100 trillion dollar bill in my Garden Gopher&hellip;and check my ammo supply&hellip;.</p>

<p>Black Africans may have low IQs, but they have much more common sense than white Americans. The blacks of Zimbabwe have a clear sense of what their racial interests are, and they work hard to advance those interests. What about white Americans? Will they be able to preserve the future of America as a white nation?</p>
<p>I see no difference between the witch who conned Zimbabweans, and the black who conned his way to the American presidency in 2008. Do you really believe that white Americans have more common sense than blacks in Zimbabwe?<br>
