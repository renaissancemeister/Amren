<h1>NC Public College E-Mail Urges Help for Democrats</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>News &amp; Observer (Raleigh), October 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A public university in North Carolina is smarting after someone at the school sent an e-mail to students and employees urging them to vote early and help the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The university [Winston-Salem State University] told recipients to disregard the pro-Democrat e-mail after the chairman of the Forsyth County Republican Party complained.</p>
<p>The historically black university then sent an equal-time message inviting the same recipients to work for Republicans during early voting.</p>

		<p>I`ve always believed that witnessing someones humiliation is almost as uncomfortable as causing it. But I had my fill with this exact behavior at the age of 46 in night school and had to unleash a Tim Mc Hugh tirade. <br>
 The Humanities teacher would drop a dozen bombs a night, &#8220;I don`t know WHY anybody wouldn`t vote Democratic!!&#8221; or, &#8220;Are they soo stupid to believe the Republicans lies?!?&#8221; It went from annoying to frustrating to enraging&hellip; Like what does this have to do with Charlemagne?<br>
 So I planned my ambush in back door bartender style. It helped a lot that I was a good twelve years older than the teacher.<br>
 So I waited until she had dropped a tri-fecta of pointed comments then asked her in a quiet but determined voice, &#8220;Did you remember to bring me my money tonight?&#8221; Her response was a prattled and unsure but angry response, &#8220;What money?!? I don`t owe you any money!!&#8221;  I replied, &#8220;Yes maam, my eight hundred dollars&hellip;&#8221; Her voice rose in anger and indignation, &#8220;What are you talking about!! Eight hundred dollars!!&#8221; I then matched her tone and in my best command voice shouted aloud, &#8220;The @#$%* eight hundred buck tuition refund you owe me for using my class time for your political ads!!!&#8221; Her face turned scarlet, then there was a visible gulp of humiliation as another voice in the back of class pleaded, &#8220;Could you Puh-leeze just shut up and teach?!&#8221; <br>
  She stammered some repsonse that the class was over for the night and as she squealed out of the parking lot I realized I had an extra hour and forty minutes to hang out at the mall across campus before going home. Next Wednesday, neither teacher or students said a thing but we never heard another comment for the next six weeks. My buddy Henry guessed that she was used to bullying 19 year olds who didnt have to pay their own way and were fifteen years younger not older than her&hellip;</p>

		<p>This is similar to the story from Cincinnati yesterday plastered all over Drudge:</p>

<p>What got me was the part about their being taken for ice cream after they voted. What are they, 18 going on 8? Then again, I tried to look up Hughes HS&rsquo;s racial demographics  &mdash;  I could not find them, but I did find out that Hughes HS&rsquo;s campus is very close to the University of Cincinnati&rsquo;s campus, and I know for a fact that UC is in Cincinnati&rsquo;s ghetto. So I figure Hughes HS must almost entirely black in its student body. So maybe the 18-year olds are more like 8.</p>
<p>I, too, cast my first vote as an 18-year old while still a senior in high school, and I had to take the ten-toe express, and I certainly didn&rsquo;t expect ice cream as a reward. I figured voting was its own reward.</p>
