			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Marisol Bello, USA Today, October 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In this city&rsquo;s Greektown, home to generations of Greek families, you are just as likely to see Latino-owned bakeries, grocery stores and restaurants as Greek coffee houses.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese started its first bilingual English and Spanish program this year to attract more Hispanic families.</p>
<p>And City Hall set up a commission two years ago to determine the education, job, public health and social needs of the growing Hispanic population, which increased 45% to 16,000 in 2008 from 11,000 in 2000.</p>
<p>&#8220;They live in every community.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We&rsquo;re seeing more restaurants, stores and shops that are just sprouting up,&#8221; says Baltimore Councilman Jim Kraft. &#8220;It&rsquo;s creating a new identity.&#8221;</p>
<p>In cities like Baltimore across the USA, the impact of Hispanics is wide-reaching and growing. The number of Hispanics in the U.S. is expected to reach 133 million by 2050, when the group is projected to make up almost a third of the nation&rsquo;s population.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the first part of the decade, the gap in unemployment rates between Hispanic and non-Hispanics almost closed, Lopez says. Then came the recession. Now the unemployment rate is 9.6% for the nation and 12% for Hispanics.</p>
<p>In Baltimore, there have been other setbacks. This summer, a half-dozen Hispanic immigrant men were beaten and robbed in separate incidents, Kraft says. The most recent in August led to the death of Honduran immigrant Martin Reyes. A suspect told police he hated Mexicans, Kraft says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hispanics in Baltimore say the city has been welcoming. In Greektown, they have opened more than a half-dozen businesses in a two-block area.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;This could be Latino Town&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>In another 10 or 20 years, &#8220;This could be Latino Town,&#8221; says Jesus Romero, 35, owner of Charro Negro, a Mexican bar. &#8220;Some of the businesses closed down, and that&rsquo;s when the Latinos, we came and got those businesses. We&rsquo;re basically building up the economy in Greektown.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other entrepreneurs are pushing the Latino influence to the next step. Fernando Parada, head of the city&rsquo;s Hispanic Business Association, says his group is encouraging more Hispanics to apply for minority-owned business status so they can get contracts with the city. So far, of the 912 minority-owned businesses certified by the city, 92 are owned by Hispanics.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nationally, Hispanic-owned businesses are the fastest-growing segment of small businesses in the country, the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce says.</p>
<p>Nearly a third of Hispanic-owned businesses are in construction, repair and maintenance, and personal and laundry services, but they are making a mark in other industries, says Nina Vaca, chairwoman of the Hispanic Chamber and CEO of Pinnacle Technical Resources, a Dallas-based IT staffing company.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Making headway</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Baltimore, the Hispanic electorate hasn&rsquo;t affected any races, says Don Norris, professor of urban and metropolitan politics at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County. &#8220;They are not organized,&#8221; he says. New immigrants are still learning the language, and many are illegal and suspicious of government, he says, making them unlikely to get involved in civic life.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Education challenges</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A December survey by the Pew Hispanic Center found 17% of Latino youths 16 to 25 do not have high school diplomas, compared with 8% of all in that age group.</p>
<p>The Census finds 13% of Latinos 25 and older had bachelor&rsquo;s degrees or higher in 2008, up from 10.6% in 2000. Twenty-nine percent of the nation had college or advanced degrees in 2008.</p>
<p>Patricia Gandara, author of The Latino Education Crisis: The Consequences of Failed Social Policies, says Hispanic pupils often attend ill-equipped schools, live in poverty and have language barriers.</p>
<p>&#8220;These young people are not being set up for a 21st century economy,&#8221; she says, and it will cause problems as they make up more of the workforce.</p>
<p>Young Hispanics who are here illegally face more problems. Sylvia Rodriguez, 23, was accepted by Harvard this year to get her master&rsquo;s degree in education. Rodriguez&rsquo;s family illegally emigrated from Mexico when she was 2.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not eligible for government aid, and her mother, who cleans houses, can&rsquo;t afford to send her to school. Rodriguez&rsquo;s neighbors in Phoenix raised money to help her through her first semester. She doesn&rsquo;t have money for the second semester.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The school district estimates that 3,000 Hispanics will be among its 83,000 students this year. They are concentrated in the southeast part of the city, where schools have increased the number of English teachers and hired bilingual staff for the first time.</p>

		<p>Complete and utter madness.  It seems not one state is safe from becoming a Mexican colony.  Whites that have long not said a word about the invasion will start to care when it shows up in their own backyards.  I used to be a liberal white who thought whites who didnt accept immigrants were &#8216;racist&rsquo;, something real easy to say in blue state America when youre not around them yourself. </p>

		<p>&#8220;The number of Hispanics in the U.S. is expected to reach 133 million by 2050&#8221;: I can see where that number could be accurate, and that these people will be in the geographic zone that is currently called the United States, but I cannot see the nation itself holding together under that circumstance. Hispanics are already close to the point of epiphany in terms of having their own nation within the U.S., after which it will only be a matter of time to reach a point of political or conflict based separation. </p>

		<p>Little Greek towns, Italys, etc are vanishing slowly, not because Italians or Greeks are dying out or losing cultural pride, but simply because of the nature of neighborhoods. Greeks and Italians are for the most part, being absorbed into the general Euro-American community. In Chicago, you can see the diversity of Euro-Americans in the suburbs, where a protestant church amongst wood frame homes sits only blocks from a Greek orthodox one, both recently constructed. It is wonderful to see this growing unity for groups that once had very fratricidal attitudes towards one another. <br>
Baltimore, Boston, New York, you name it, the cities that were once centers of Euro-American culture and peoples are now becoming hubs of Africans, Amerindians, etc. If you believe these populations are interested in &ldquo;adding&rdquo; to the Euro-American communities, you are very wrong. Even in the article, the man claims &ldquo;this could be Latino town&rdquo; (as if that is exotic anymore) and shows little interest in Greek culture or the Greeks at all. <br>

		<p>In the populous suburbs near Dc, Montgomery and Pg, the Hispanics are numerous. They cost the schools and health systems plenty. The governing pols, many of whom are black in Pg and black and Jewish in Montgomery, do nothing, except sent the bill<br>
to the taxpayers. Baltimore, obsesed by the disfunctional majority black population, fails to see the real threat over the horizon. The primary victims of the Hispanic conquest will be blacks. The secondary victims will be the affluent Jews who surround Baltimore in suburbs they stupidly think are immune from the invasion.</p>

		<p>Poster #2 said something that I think about all the time.  Latinos have no loyalty towards keeping the &#8220;United&#8221; States together.  They have no vested interest in it, either.  I challenge anyone to give any convincing argument to the contrary.  </p>
<p>When they are the absolute majority in huge swaths of the land, they&rsquo;re just going to do what they want.  A big fear I have is what happens to the nukes when the country goes?  Can you imagine, Diego throwing his nukes at Shaqauanda?  What about all the other military hardware?  So many latinos are in the armed forces now.  They know how to use the stuff.</p>
<p>When the Civil War was just breaking out, both the north and the south scrambled for all the military assets.  Can you imagine what it will be like when it all melts down in 20-30 years?  Damn if I won&rsquo;t be too old then to really do anything about it.  I&rsquo;ll be some geezer with a cane!  I am already afraid for my descendants.  Famine, rape, murder, genocide - it&rsquo;s all in the cards and it&rsquo;s whites who will be on the receiving end with no where to go.  (What, can we flee to Eurabia?)</p>
<p>Buying land in a rural area won&rsquo;t help.  When a nation collapses, property rights go out the window.</p>

		<p>I have older family members that still live near the areas mentioned in this article and so I am down that way frequently. The transformation over the last 10 years has been unbelievable. It is an all out INVASION. Whenever I&rsquo;ve taken my elderly relative to the nearby hospital for appointments, the maternity/pediatric ward is filled to the brim with Hispanic women EXCLUSIVELY (the area is also very black yet I see very few pregnant black women). It is the norm to see a heavily pregnant Hispanic woman with three young children trailing behind her, all under 5. In Highlandtown, which is right next to Greektown, there is even a Baltimore &#8220;resettlement center&#8221;   &mdash;   so nice to know our government has failed at the federal, state and local levels to uphold the law; instead, the government is complicit in allowing these illegals to flood our country and spend our tax dollars for all kinds of social services, welfare, food stamps, healthcare, etc. </p>

What makes it worse is they don&rsquo;t like staying in their own communities.</p>
<p>Here in Buffalo, Hispanics have the west side (which was previously Italian). They have turned the west side into a gang, drug, violent community and now Hispanics are looking for new territory to parasites.</p>

<p>Umm&hellip;forgive me, but that doesn&rsquo;t sound like a call for diversity.  Liberals are always saying how much they love diversity, but when its obvious that most immigrants today (Hispanics) are displacing all the unique little pockets of real diversity in this nation, how can they still claim that our immigration policies encourage diversity?  There are not very many Greek Towns, few Little Italies, and only a handful of German-cultured communities in our nation, and yet the liberals seem content to wash away all this diversity and replace it with boring and homogenous barios and ghettos.  So much for the melting pot.  Ah well, it was great while it lasted.</p>

<p>Just their nature - to sponge off the bleeding heart of White at his expense.</p>
<p>I have read the statistic before about there being around 133 million Hispanics in the U.S. by 2050 (33% of projected population). If Hispanics are 33% of the entire nation by then, just think how dominant they will be in the Southwest United States. Think California, Arizona, New Mexico&hellip; Ever since the 60s and 70s there has been a prominent Hispanic prescense in California. But it&rsquo;s just in the last 5-10 years that jobs prefer or require Spanish speaking people and signage has to be in Spanish. Anyone living in the Southwest U.S. can see that Hispanics don&rsquo;t have an interest in keeping the U.S. &#8220;United&#8221;, and they don&rsquo;t really care about the interests of other races, just their own. If current trends persist, the Southwest could become a &#8220;Hispanic nation&#8221; within the U.S. Each year looking at the school-age population and babies being born - White folks are drying up.</p>

<p>  &mdash;  Scotsman</p>
<p>When the hispanic colonization was mostly confined to California and the Southwest, we Native Born Whites were called xenophobes and racists for resisting our own demise by displacement or over-taxation.  I&rsquo;m sure your media cheers this &#8216;transformation&rsquo;, ours on the Left Coast certainly did and does to this day.</p>
<p>You folks in Boston, Baltimore and other points east are experiencing what WE Californians experienced approximately 30 years ago  &mdash;  and it has destroyed our state  &mdash;  emergency rooms overflowing with pregnant latinas,  non-English speaking children flooding the schools, a huge rise in the food stamp class, and yes, displacing blacks in their historic rioting areas of LA.</p>
<p>The government, media, academia?  This is what they&rsquo;d like you to believe:  Resistance is Futile!</p>
<p>Good luck folks on the East Coast, and welcome to the world of your White displacement!</p>
<p>Oh  &mdash;  and start taking pictures of your historic areas, your beautiful parks, buildings, streets, beaches if you have them  &mdash;   before they are either destroyed by the new colonists or those areas become too dangerous for Whites to venture into.</p>
