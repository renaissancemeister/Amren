<p>Government data analyzed by The Associated Press show most Americans simply don&rsquo;t apply to harvest fruits and vegetables. And the few Americans who do usually don&rsquo;t stay in the fields.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s just not something that most Americans are going to pack up their bags and move here to do,&#8221; said farmer Steve Fortin, who pays $10.25 an hour to foreign workers to trim strawberry plants at his nursery near the Nevada border.</p>
<p>The AP analysis showed that, from January to June, California farmers posted ads for 1,160 farmworker positions open to U.S. citizens and legal residents. But only 233 people in those categories applied after learning of the jobs through unemployment offices in California, Texas, Nevada and Arizona.</p>
<p>One grower brought on 36. No one else hired any.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sometimes, U.S. workers also will turn down the jobs because they don&rsquo;t want their unemployment insurance claims to be affected, or because farm labor positions do not begin for several months, and applicants prefer to be hired immediately, Ruelas said.</p>
<p>Fortin spent $3,000 this year to make sure that domestic workers have first dibs on his jobs in the sparsely populated stretch of the state, advertising in newspapers and on an electronic job registry.</p>
<p>But he did not get any takers, even though he followed the requirements of a little-known, little-used program to bring in foreign farmworkers the legal way  &mdash;  by applying for guest worker visas.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The majority of farmers rely on illegal labor to harvest their crops, but they can also use the little-known H-2A visa to hire guest workers, as long as they request the workers months in advance of the harvest season and can show that no Americans want the job.</p>
<p>Of the estimated 40,900 full-time farmers and ranchers in California, just 34, including Fortin, petitioned to bring in foreign farmworkers on the visas, according to government data for the first eight months of the year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More than half of farmworkers in the United States are illegal immigrants, the Labor Department says. Proponents of tougher immigration laws  &mdash;  as well as the United Farm Workers of America  &mdash;  say farmers are used to a cheap, largely undocumented work force, and if growers raised wages and improved working conditions, the jobs would attract Americans.</p>
<p>So far, an effort by the UFW to get Americans to take farm jobs has been more effective in attracting applicants than the official channels.</p>
<p>The UFW in June launched the &#8220;Take Our Jobs Campaign,&#8221; inviting people to go online and apply. About 8,600 people filled out an application form, but only seven have been placed in farm jobs, UFW President Arturo Rodriguez said.</p>
<p>Some U.S. workers referred for jobs at Fortin&rsquo;s nursery couldn&rsquo;t do the grueling work.</p>
<p>&#8220;A few years ago when domestic workers were referred here, we saw absentee problems, and we had people asking for time off after they had just started,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Some were actually planting the plants upside down.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I am a White college professor who grew up in California.  From the age of 8 until 16 I worked every summer picking every type of crop.  I also spent summers thinning tomatoes with a short-handled hoe, and bucked bales.  The work was fun and valuable.  It taught me the value and honor in doing an honest day&rsquo;s work.  It taught me to get up before dawn.  It was much more healthy than watching TV or hanging out at the mall.  We kids had a blast, joking, telling stories, eating fruit, etc. Having spending money was great! The lessons I learned doing physical labor stayed with me my entire life.  Our kids need such work experiences, for a healthy America!  All of our kids need to be cleaning toilets, sweeping floors, mowing lawns, and picking fruit   &mdash;   it teaches humility and instills a work-ethic.</p>
<p> IT IS A LIE THAT AMERICANS WILL NOT DO AGRICULTURAL WORK.  What they really mean is that greedy businessmen prefer complacent low-salary, foreign, slave-labor to do the work.  </p>

		<p>Does the farmer really expect Americans to pack up and move to a remote part of the state for a mere 10 dollars an hour? They couldn&rsquo;t afford to. Furthermore, even if there is a shortage in agricultural work and there wouldn&rsquo;t be if it paid a good wage, you don&rsquo;t have to flood the country with foreign workers. You can simply get only the number of workers needed, they can be given a temporary legal visa, the farmer can pay their bus tickets to and fro and when the season is over, they are on the bus paid for by their employer that takes them back. </p>

		<p>I also picked fruit in the mid 60s as a young adolescent.  It used to be common that white kids and even young adults worked in the fields.  Of course, anyone who has read Steinbeck&rsquo;s &#8220;Grapes of Wrath,&#8221; or seen the movie knows that the original transient farm labor was white.  Conditions and treatment were terrible compared to what the Hispanics get today, or even in the 1960s.  But they unionized and marched, I remember the marches, I was there as a happenstance bystander.  But many us my friends and I signed up and picked.  We got up at 5:00am, got to the sign up station and rode a bus out to the fields.  We were never offered water, and got a short lunch break.  Work was done by 3:00pm.  I worked without a hat, just like the other kids, and it was boiling hot in the Sacramento Valley in August.  Our parents let us go off and pick that way.  We got $0.25 per 20lb box of tomatoes.  Later, machanized pickers arrived and I knew a girl on my block, white, who worked on one of those.  For a summer, when I was 21, I drove 18 wheelers full of fruit, including tomatoes to the processors in San Jose, and Oakland.  I also know and have known many older white people who grew up picking everything from grapes, to peaches, to prunes, in Sonoma, Mendocino, Lake, and Napa counties.  Summer vacation was originally for allowing the farm families to work and harvest their crops, when America was 90% farmers in 1900.</p>
<p>In about 2003, I met a nice couple, a couple of hippies, you might say.  They were in their 50s and told me about how they tried to get jobs in Washington State picking apples and other fruit.  &#8220;Not qualified,&#8221; they were told, by the Hispanic supervisor.  The only difference between now and then is that the Hispanic Unions don&rsquo;t let whites in, and most white kids are so spoiled that they won&rsquo;t work unless bribed, and then their work is often slip-shod.  </p>
<p>The first sentence of this article is very deceptive, as well as insulting.  Why do we always need more Mexican farm workers, do we have an ever expanding farm development program going that no one but they and the government know about?  Hispanics do two things once they land a farm job.  They take another job, such as driving or even dishwashing at a restaurant, or they make sure they get hurt so that they can get permanent disability.  YOU BETTER BELIEVE THIS, I SAW IT IN PERSON WORKING AT HEALTH CARE FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA IN THE LATE 1990s AND EARLY 2000s.  I quit once I discovered the massive fraud taking place.  I later found that it has been going on for a long time all over the country.  But I did not want to have anything to do with it.  I haven&rsquo;t worked in my profession for nearly four years now.  My wife and I barely get by, but I would rather this than participate in the many faceted fraud that healthcare is has become (long before Obama).</p>
<p>The myth of the Hispanic farm worker for life is just that, a myth. Most only do it as long as they must.</p>
<p>What we need is enough of a collapse that will get white Americans back on their own land working their own land.  We&rsquo;re way off the tracks folks, thinking that everyone can work in the compurter industry, or the professions.  American have to get over the idea that everyone can be the big boss.  My wife and I keep a garden, we can, and we also keep yard hens.  We do it so that we pay as little money for lousy produce grown by corporate farms who hire hispanics who are stealing our country from under us - assisted by our government, who sometime ago must have decided to replace a spoiled rotten, drug addled, complaining bunch of obese white people with immigrants.  That is all I can figure out for the moment.  But we could do something positive by fixing the problems about ourselves that we can.  One of those is spending less time on useless consumer activities and more in your own home, actually making it a home.  I have been doing this for a while with my wife and aside from the conditions of the world, we are very happy and in love as a result, even though we are both in our 50s.  We KNOW that we are in it together and we are joyful everytime we eat something we grew ourselves.  </p>
<p>The roots of any culture resides in the land they live on.  If they are not attached to that land, they drift into oblivion.  It is time for whites to stop drifting.</p>

<p>So we have government &#8220;data&#8221; (read: lies) &#8220;analyzed&#8221; (read: &#8220;we interpret this however we want to&#8221;) by the notoriously left-wing AP that supposedly proves the old cliche &#8220;illegal immigrants are just doing the work amerikans won&rsquo;t do.&#8221;  Uh-huh.  Sure.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&ldquo;A few years ago when domestic workers were referred here, we saw absentee problems, and we had people asking for time off after they had just started,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Some were actually planting the plants upside down.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Oh, those silly White people!  Goofing off and utterly incompetent!  Just try saying that about <i>any</i> nonWhite group and see how seriously you&rsquo;re taken by the governmedia.</p>
<p>As usual, no nonsense is too childish when Whites are the targets and nonWhites are being given all the excuses.</p>

		<p>Boy are we lazy!  Thank god we have an endless supply of latin americans so eager to come to our country to pick our food for a few years until they get amnestied and can just apply for welfare like normal minorities. </p>
<p>They will be easily replaced year after year by endless new waves of immigrants though! Don&rsquo;t fret the supply is endless!</p>

<p>You have a good point, but only to a certain &#8220;point.&#8221;  In WW2, people moved to the shipyards to build ships or work in other factory towns for the war effort.  Many farms are ajascent to subburbs.  Towns like Yamkima, Washing were once full of white people who either owned or worked on farms.  Now those home are occupied by Hispanics, with only a little expansion for the increased numbers of farms and the new trend of growning vineyards for pretentious wineries.  The one big differnece is not just the complexion of the entire region of Central and Eastern Washington, it is the crime rates, which are huge for the population densities.  There are &#8220;no go&#8221; areas in Yakima for whites, according to some local whites.  There is a town south of Yakima that no white should enter at all. </p>
<p>It may be that a huge catastrophe must occur before we reorder ourselves and our culture around our land and renew our bond with it.  But if a kid can go off to summer camp, he can also go off to the farm for a month or two.  They will certainly learn better values on a farm than playing around at a camp for spoiled kids, whose spoiled parents want to run off and forget them.<br>

		<p>A well-known Chinese mass murderer once said: &#8220;The integrity is in the worker, not in the work.&#8221; Although that statement was a propaganda sound bite designed to inspire millions of half-starved, semi-enslaved Chinamen to feel good about their daily drudgery, I don&rsquo;t think any truer words have ever been spoken. </p>
<p>In the small town where I live in South Central Kentucky there are hundreds of people who would trade a pinky finger for a $10.25 per hour job. They plant, cut and hang tobacco for a lot less, and they do it right and they do it fast.</p>
<p>Quit paying parasites not to work and they, too, will learn to earn a living doing any honest work that is available.They might even develop some integrity and conscientiousness as well.</p>

		<p>I might be interested in a bus ticket, if I weren&rsquo;t so old and weak. How else would I get to a farm job with no transportation? I bet it&rsquo;s something only provided foreign workers.</p>

		<p>The very same liberals who decry the steady decrease in real wages of working class Americans will use this story to argue in favor of bringing in more cheap foreign labor rather than to argue that farmers ought to raise their wages and the rest of use should get used to paying a bit more for fruit and vegetables (but less for bankrupted hospitals and ruined schools).</p>
<p>If we cut welfare, restrict unemployment benefits to one year, and raise wages for agricultural work this problem will sort itself out without any importation of foreign labor.<br>

		<p>Q: If Juan can pick 5 apples per minute, how many can he pick in an hour?</p>
<p>Answer: 5 apples X 60 mintues = 300 apples per hour.</p>
<p>Q: If Juan is paid $10.50 per hour, what is the cost per apple?</p>
<p>Answer: $10.50 per hour / 300 apples per hour = $.035 (or 3-1/2 cents per apple.</p>
<p>If you doubled the salary to $21.00 per hour, the cost of the apple would increase by 3-1/2 cents per apple.</p>
<p>Q: Does anyone believe that people will not work for $21 per hr. in this economy or that the entire apple industry would collapse if the price of apples were raised by 3-1/2 cents?</p>

		<p>The area of the country I live and grew up is a huge northeastern agricultural center. As recently as the early to mid 1980&rsquo;s the farm fields were filled with White workers, and only supplemented by non-whites! It was practically a rite of passage for young folks to spend some time toiling in the onion and lettuce fields. This idea that American agriculture cannot now survive without an army of non-white, primarily &#8220;illegal/illegitimate&#8221; labor is complete nonsense!</p>
<p>I also note that many of these farmers were among the wealthiest folks in my hometown! That they can&rsquo;t afford to pay better wages is an outright mendacity! </p>

		<p>Ten dollars an hour isn&rsquo;t all that bad, actually.  It&rsquo;s not that people here won&rsquo;t work for that.  The farmers and giant conglomerates don&rsquo;t want to treat workers with dignity and legal rights.  They like the slave laborers who cost them little and are easily replaceable.</p>

		<p>I applaud poster #1, the college professor. He is right.  I too worked various jobs, including picking strawberries during summers when in my teens.</p>
<p>However, I do remember that being down on your knees in the soil was backbreaking work, even for a teenager who was not used to it. It&rsquo;s a matter of conditioning. For a regular farm worker, who does this all the time and is in shape, no problem. </p>
<p>The problem, I think, is that people  on welfare who are used to sitting at home, gabbing on the phone, watching TV, eating potato chips and drinking beer, are in no shape to handle that sort of job. It&rsquo;s hard work for someone who&rsquo;s out of shape!  As long as they can stay at home and be comfortable with that steady check coming in, why sould they bother with a job like that?  There has to be some incentive, and that is what&rsquo;s lacking in our system. Otherwise, they will let the illegals do the work. Why should they, when we pay them as much to stay at home?</p>

		<p>I grow much of my own food.  Trust me that pulling weeds from my plot is downright fun compared to a day of handling vomit, poop, and blood in the ICU.  Of course, I would work on a farm if there wasn&rsquo;t a good market for my specialty at the hospitals.  I did not grow up in poverty either.  I was raised by my grandparents who were diplomats so I did have a fair amount of privilege in my childhood.  Don&rsquo;t tell me that U.S. teens wouldn&rsquo;t work the fields or the traditional fast food jobs if employers were open to them as workers.  I just don&rsquo;t believe it.  </p>

		<p>I spoke to a grower in North Carolina and he said that his workers can make well over $20./hr as he pays for quantity picked.   It seems that every other white I meet there is &#8220;on disability&#8221;.  They don&rsquo;t value their education, so they quit school and do physical labor and as soon as one little thing happens, they &#8220;can&rsquo;t&#8221; work and prefer  get the handout, but also work for cash on the side.   I recently moved back to New England and am working for the time at a wedding venue as waitstaff.  There is a young lady there who was born with only one leg and wears a prosthesis, AND WORKS!!  She is inspirational and makes me ever so more disgusted with the people I&rsquo;ve met down south.   My home there will be on the market in the spring.</p>

		<p>Like others, I remember when seasonal farm labor was done by white school students and housewives looking to make a little cash. Students became lazy slackers addicted to the latest electronic toy and housewives became liberated. Hispanics filled the void. Now we are paying the price for &#8220;social progress&#8221;.</p>

		<p><i>Government data analyzed by The Associated Press show most Americans simply don&rsquo;t apply to harvest fruits and vegetables. And the few Americans who do usually don&rsquo;t stay in the fields.</i></p>
<p>Lol, look at that wording.  &#8220;Most Americans simply don&rsquo;t apply&#8221; for farm work?  These people make a living writing, and that&rsquo;s the best they could come up with?  Is there a job in America that most Americans DO apply for?  I doubt it very much.</p>

		<p>I also worked in the citrus industry as a young man in Florida in the early 80s. True even then most harvesting was done by illegal migrants, but at the time they were still actually migrants. They came into an area and worked then moved on. All other jobs in the groves were still done by whites (mostly young people starting out and more elderly people without any marketable skills) and a few blacks. The work paid 9 dollars an hour for a 10 hour a day job, 5 days a week so you always got 10 hours of time and a half weekly. And this was in the early 80s. <br>
When the mexican tidal wave hit and we went from 1% to 30% mexican almost overnight all whites were fired and replaced with mexicans for 4 dollars an hour with no overtime,<br>
This was during the most profitable time for citrus growers in Florida as the Japanese were buying all the concentrate they could get at top dollar.<br>
With the increase in profits you would expect a drop in prices but that didnt happen, instead the grove owners went from wealthy to obscenely wealthy overnight and hundreds or possibly more American workers lost their jobs. And that was just in my county alone. So the fact that illegals get paid less now than Americans got 30 years ago for the same work kind of says it all.<br>
Saddest part is even before the illegals flooded in and took the jobs the grove owners were making large profits even while paying American workers a fair wage.  </p>

		<p>If a White Person wants a 60 dollar video game or a 350 dollar I-Phone, or 100, 1 dollar, downloads of digital music and they have a 180 dollar paycheck to apply to rent/food/transport/clothing or &#8216;other&rsquo; subsistence and work related costs then they are negatively incentivized to work for 10 dollars or even 15-20 dollars an hour.</p>
<p>Which is where you have to acknowledge that the more sophisticated the society and inhabitants, the more dependent they are on a given level of &#8216;privilege&rsquo; as buying power to sustain their more sophisticatd tastes within it.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not saying that blacks, hispanics or asians have less blingful wants and needs.  Be it gold teeth, chrome rims or the same video game.  But if you want to get particularly young whites who have NO wealth base to &#8216;buy into&rsquo; the concept of society while sustaining their sense of independent and up to the minute understanding of &#8216;culture&rsquo; (as their own time and place in the world), you need to stop talking in terms of dollars and start thinking in terms of credits.</p>
<p>We all know that retail pricing is massively over valued to leverage the distributionist capitalism system which literally pays for EVERY step from the ground to the factory to the sales outlet.  We know this because we see prices that are half or less what the MSRP is, online.</p>
<p>We also know that distributors get volume discounts for the sheer number of crates of X-product that they import.</p>
<p>If we could link up purchasing systems as combine level buying power so that &#8220;Okay, that game will cost you 35 farm credits and I&rsquo;ll make sure you stay housed, fed and watered until your next paycheck&hellip;&#8221; (because 500 copies of the game cost only 25 dollars to the combine store), we would see young people joining up, in the hundreds, simply to have the group purchasing power that their parents take for granted as a function of their high end, white collar, jobs.</p>
<p>Not every white is meant to be a doctor or an engineer or even a high volume paper pusher.  But even for those who are, there is a sense of needing to have a life to stay commited to pushing through a career.  And everyone starts small (and intimidated) on the social empowerment scale.</p>
<p>If whites would get together and offer these services only to other whites on a _private contract_ basis (not incorporated, not subject to AA quotas) we could start to build the &#8216;post racial&rsquo; enclave society that helps our people survive in a white minority environment.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>

		<p>Listing a temporary position that takes someone off of unemployment, and then makes them ineligible for it, many miles away from where they live, that pays (by the time expenses are factored in) less than their unemployment   &mdash;  - and tons of people didn&rsquo;t jump?  </p>
<p>Reminds me of our unemployment office offering up elections jobs (4 days max) to do the same. Or the companies that simply rehire a person for a temporary position to avoid paying benefits. (Though you can argue that one on appeal of benefits, and win.) </p>
<p><br>
In the 70&rsquo;s my parents, and grandparents still had a working farm. They grew mainly okra, pumpkins, rhubarb, sorghum, tomatoes (that only went to a cannery), and several varieties of beans, but did have spring crops like various berries, and radishes. They also raised roosters, and I still dislike roosters to this day because of it.  They loved 45 miles from the outskirt of the nearest major city. The only things around to recruit people from the immediate area were a local newspaper that came once a month, a flier at the gas station (we had 1),and recruiting at the local Indian reservation. We ended up with a mix of whites, Indians, a very few Mexicans, and a token black (mostly local) or two working for us. </p>
<p>How did they solve their labor problem? They posted ads in the major city over, recruited very heavily there (even setup interviews there), and posted that transportation was included. (Albeit from 3 pickup/drop off points.)  With the simple caveat that people could get to work if they could get to the pickup point, and not have to drive 500 miles a week to hold down a job we had plenty of labor. A lot of our help was from the city, but we had a few locals beyond the Indians who were almost entirely locals. They paid $8-16 an hour for the help, depending on experience, and what you did. They also got a referral bonus for anyone they brought on that worked out. Minimum wage was around $3/hr back then. Lunch, and some basic drinks were included with that. They didn&rsquo;t go broke paying those wages even back then.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not convinced of the superiority of the Mexican &#8216;migrant&rsquo; worker for this task. We didn&rsquo;t have shacks that were rented out, we didn&rsquo;t have immigration cards to deal with, or any of that non-sense. People returned home, to their own bed when they were done, and we paid in cash because the day ran longer than when the bank was open. We always had plenty of water, biscuits, and tea for people to drink.  </p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t the type of job you wanted to make a career out of, but it was cash (which is hard to find), and people were treated decently. I don&rsquo;t think it would have worked well without the bus to pick people up though.</p>
<p>If wages for this had even remotely kept up with inflation these would be $25-35/hr jobs.  The problem is, its a race to the bottom. If you can hire an illegal for $10, 6 of which you get back renting him a plywood box you call a room   &mdash;   you don&rsquo;t use alternatives because your neighbors are already doing the same. </p>
<p>What we need is vigorous enforcement of our laws, and the economics would correct themselves.  </p>
