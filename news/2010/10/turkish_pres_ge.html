<h1><a href="http://www.wtop.com/?nid=383&amp;sid=2084555">Turkish Pres: Germany Must Help Turks Integrate</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Suzan Fraser, WTOP-AM (Washington, DC), October 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Turkey&rsquo;s president on Tuesday urged politicians in Germany not to exploit the issue of immigration for political gain and said they should instead help Turks better integrate.</p>
<p>Abdullah Gul was speaking at a joint news conference with German President Christian Wulff who is paying a five-day visit to Turkey while his country is increasingly debating the integration of millions of foreigners.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of using the issue of integration politically, everyone must help reach a solution,&#8221; the Turkish president told reporters.</p>
<p>Gul said Turks living in Germany should learn to speak German &#8220;for their own sakes, for the sake of their families, and so that they may be of use for their environment and society.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Turkish president said however, both Germany and Turkey had failed to provide sufficient guidance to Turkish immigrants, many of whom went to Germany as &#8220;guest workers&#8221; in the 1960s to help rebuild postwar Germany.</p>
<p>&#8220;We should not blame them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Many went to German cities (from Turkish villages) without even having seen a (Turkish) city. Neither we nor you were able to provide the necessary leadership.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wulff said that many immigrants had successfully integrated in Germany but said Germans&rsquo; fears over &#8220;religious fundamentalism and terrorism&#8221; could not be ignored.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Germany is home to an estimated 5 million Muslims, including some 3 million Turks.</p>
<p>Many immigrants speak little or no German, work in low paying jobs or live off of government handouts at the same time the country faces an aging population and a shortage of highly skilled workers.</p>

		<p>Exactly how can Turks &#8220;assimilate&#8221;? Their religion<br>
commands Jihad, and commands Dhimmi status for all<br>
non believers. The very idea of &#8220;assimilation&#8221; is a<br>
fantasy.</p>

		<p>Why has the German government allowed 5,000,000+ Muslim immigrants to permanently reside in their country when so many people from eastern Europe could fill the labor demands?</p>
<p>Unemployment by eastern European country: Slovkia, 11.4%; Hungary, 10.8%; Ukraine, 8.8%; Russia, 8.4%; and Romania, 7.8%. Source: The CIA World Factbook.</p>
<p>Those statisics are from 2009, so the facts might be slightly different today. Nonetheless, there are many people from eastern Europe who are out of work and could work in Germany.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s examine the poverty rate in those same countries.</p>
<p>Population below the poverty line by eastern European country: Slovakia, 21%; Hungary, 12%; Ukraine, 35%; Russia, 15.8%; and Romania, 25%. Source: The CIA World Factbook.</p>
<p>Germany, which is Europe&rsquo;s largest economy and the fifth largest economy in the entire world in the context of purchasing power parity (PPP), is one of the best places in the world to live. Since many eastern Europeans are living below the poverty line, I&rsquo;m sure many dream of a better life abroad.</p>
<p>There you have it. There is an abundance of people who are either out of work and desire a better life abroad. These people are of European descent like us. They come from a similar culture and people and are therefore better able to integrate.</p>
<p>As someone who is descended from a wave of Czech immigration to Texas that took place in the late 1800s and early 1900s, I think immigration from eastern Europe isn&rsquo;t a bad thing. It&rsquo;s certainly better than taking in immigrants who aren&rsquo;t like us and cannot and will not adopt our culture and ways.</p>

		<p>The guy does not want his own people back.  Pushing responsiblity onto someone else.  You educate, house, &amp; feed them.  The whites being good people continues to do so.  Any realist statements concerning free loading is quickly beaten down by racist allegations, which is very effective.  How long will it continue, until the whites say no firmly and repeatly?  The Chinese would not have taken the route of supporting free loaders with no strings attached which is mutually beneficial to both sides.</p>

		<p>All I can imagine that really means is that Merkel is suggesting German women marry Muslims, imagining that this will produce offspring who will be more moderate.  What  gamble to take with the fate of Germany and the white race!  People who construct politics and pressure population groups this way are commiting crime.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s happening? Why is there a global transference of people at this time? The people of third world countries are swarming first world countries in untold numbers all over the planet. Do they not realize that once a first world country is swamped, there will be no help for them? When, once, the host country might have sent money and aid to these nations, there will be none to send if the third world descends and uses up the assets. Even the Bible says, &#8220;The poor are always with us.&#8221; Why not send teams of experts to these underdeveloped countries to instruct the governments/people on how to make their countries livable. We cannot continue to take care of the world financially. We have no money, but we do have talent and that can be used&hellip;much like the Peace Corp of years ago. Don&rsquo;t give handouts, give a hand up.</p>

<p>The people of Eastern Europe are the most racially healthy white people in the world. Why do you want to subject them to the political correctness and multi-culturalism of Western Europe? There is nothing wrong with living in poverty. Preserving the unique genotype of whites, is more important than giving every white a high standard of living. If Eastern Europe becomes prosperous, that will attract third world immigrants, and make the region as multi-racial as Western Europe.<br>

		<p>Wait a second&hellip;.. &#8220;5 million Turks in Germany&#8221;, which has about 82 million people? Ummm&hellip;that&rsquo;s 6% of the population, yet other news items cite a 2.5% Turkish population in Germany.  Which is the truth???</p>

		<p>How did all the other non-Turk Muslims get into Germany? What nation is going to urge they learn German and assimilate? The Germans, for allegedly rational people, are not so rational. </p>
<p>They fight navally-supreme Britain in WWI and ignore the potential friendship of the USA which had more Germans than any other nation outside Germany, fight the USSR and the USA in WWII, and then after they pick themselves up from massive bombing and population loss, invite the worst possible people in the world other than Africans to do their dirty work!</p>
<p>Part of me has no sympathy for the Germans. They pretend to be so rational, so civilized, but have acted irrationally since Napoleon made mince meat of their armies. Indeed, any well-organized army has beaten the stuffing out of the Germans since 1800.(The French never are well-organized). </p>
<p>On the other hand, a Muslim dominated Germany is either neutered as a civilized society, or at worst a security threat to the world.</p>
<p>I have little faith in the Germans. In the end, their herd mentality to go along with their leaders is a disaster: whether the ignorant buffoon Kaiser, the self-pitying paranoid narcissist Hitler, or the materialistic moneychangers who have run this ruined Reich since 1949. </p>
<p>I feel sorry for the folks in the former DDR; in the long-run they would have been better off in their own racially pure socialist state, with all its shortages and drab architecture. At least it survived on its own, without Turk &#8220;help&#8221;.</p>

<p>Good luck, one thing many Europeans do is try to distance themselves from their siblings across the pond as much as possible. I&rsquo;ve heard people even claim that Africans in Germany are more German than the Amish! It is insulting, but often these arguments are made by Africans in Europe who&rsquo;s interest lies in destroying the racial meaning of being European. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve even heard of Europeans resenting the term &ldquo;Euro-America&rdquo; because it too closely associates us with Europe, yet culturally and racially, they can&rsquo;t escape the truth. However, if they keep up their mindless 3rd world immigration, they won&rsquo;t have anything in common with us, the future of Western civilization will fall to Eastern Europe and Europeans outside of Europe.  <br>

There&rsquo;s much  talk above about  &#8220;free-loaders&#8221;, and about &#8220;integration&#8221;, and about  &#8220;assimilating&#8221;, and  about learning the language, and about economics, and about unemployment. </p>
<p>All of these are valid issues,  in themselves,  and not to be dismissed;   but  they are not  what it is really all about.  The basic, underlying  thing is that Turks SHOULD NOT BE IN GERMANY AT ALL!     Turks are Turks, not Germans, and they never will be   &mdash;   no matter whether they learn the language or not.   That&rsquo;s irrelevant.  Nor should anyone want them to assimilate or integrate with Germans  (i.e. miscegenate), as that would mean the destruction  (and Islamification) of the German population.   Of course, there are some elements that would love to see precisely that.  And that&rsquo;s their  long-term goal.  [And I don&rsquo;t mean those elements are necessarily Moslems, but Moslems would be delighted too.]    </p>
<p>The  <b>minoritizing of the German populace in their own country is what it&rsquo;s all about, </b> the &#8220;electing of a new people&#8221; by the government and by those unseen elements  in unelected positions of power.  Just as here (in the USA) and in  all other white countries,  they wish to see a disestablished, powerless  majority.   It will make them feel safer,  and more in control, when they are the leaders of a coalition of minorities with no clear majority to resist them.</p>
<p>They (the international, globalist elements behind this)  are promoting all of this under the  high-sounding and disingenuous claim of  &#8220;human rights&#8221; and  &#8220;fighting racism&#8221;,  whereas it is really a very racist, genocidal campaign that they are waging   &mdash;  -  it&rsquo;s a war against whites.<br>
