<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hispanic voters could have an outsize influence in a number of closely contested races next month, according to a report unveiled Tuesday by a nonpartisan Latino organization.</p>
<p>About 6.5 million Hispanic voters will likely cast their ballots this year, according to the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials  &mdash;  nearly 1 million more than in the last midterm elections in 2006. The group derived its estimate by looking at the increase in Hispanic voter turnout in the past three congressional elections.</p>
<p>The voting bloc could have an impact in close races from Texas to Colorado, said Arturo Vargas, executive director of the group.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never before have we had so many tight contests at the state and federal levels in states where the Latino vote can make a difference,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think it will make all the difference in 2010.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Recent studies have shown a lack of enthusiasm among Hispanics for the upcoming election. {snip}</p>
<p>But Vargas said his observations contradict the contention that the Latino vote will be less energized. {snip}</p>

		<p>All of this jabbering about isolated elections does not mean anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the long term that matters.</p>
<p>Very, very soon Texas and Florida (along with other states) will be blue states just like New York and California and it will be completely impossible for Whites to avoid the violent dispossesion and displacement that is coming&hellip;  </p>

		<p>There is a racial demographic that is even more key to key midterm races, and not just in a few states.  White people.</p>
<p>Nationally, if you lose nine Hispanic voters, you only need to gain one White voter to break even.  The ratio is lower in certain states, but far from insurmountable.</p>

		<p>There are many &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; ( a nebulous term, Puerto Ricans to Cuban, Brazilians to Mexicans) who are assimilated in the Anglo/white populace through intermarriage,  long-term residence in the US(more than one or two generations). These people vote to the extent any middle class persons vote. Under fifty percent in an off year, but more than a third. As for the rest, they are seperate from America, deliberately so, and in the case of an electon like the one on Nov 2 that&rsquo;s just as well. These newbies, even if legal, think of gvt as a giver to them. They expect to pay nothing for public services, and voting doesn&rsquo;t concern them because they don&rsquo;t consider themselves Americans.</p>
<p>This could change in the future. But for now, heavy white turnout will trump even this growing Hispanic so called group.</p>

		<p>In case you havn&rsquo;t figured it out yet, white people are not controlling things for much longer.  I suggest that you look into dual citizenship and understand why the possession of precious metals will be important for you.</p>

		<p>Here we go again. Is this the USA, or is it some nation south of the border? LATINO, LATINO, LATINO, LATINO, LATINO, LATINO. If you are eligible to vote you are an American, no matter what your<br>
heritage is. If you are proud to be an American, then BE one.<br>

		<p>And how many of those voters are here illegally? My city&rsquo;s supervisor of elections admitted to me that she doesn&rsquo;t check the voter registration rolls for citizenship; she relies on honesty on the part of the registrant! And of course there is more and more Hispandering for their votes, until we reach the point when only Hispanics can be elected (like California).</p>

		<p>More of you AmRen readers should look into becoming Election Inspectors, through your County&rsquo;s Board of Elections. This way to can actually participate in the Election process directly, while validating Voter identifications, and eligibility.</p>
<p>If there are any situations, like the now infamous one of the Black Panther in Philadelphia, Penn., waving a Nighstick around with his three Associates, in what is supposed to pass for a uniform, to threaten White voters away from the Polls, you would be there to call the Police on your cell phone, and take pictures, or videos, of the incident. </p>
<p>This is how we become more actively involved in the Election process, and to safeguard our right, and the right of others, to vote.</p>

<p>In just a few years, the most precious metal will be lead, if you know what I mean. Stockpile that first and worry about gold and silver afterward. All the gold and silver in the world will do you no good if you can&rsquo;t protect it.</p>
