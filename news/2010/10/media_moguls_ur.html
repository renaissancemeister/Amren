<h1><a href="https://www.wtop.com/?sid=2066532&amp;nid=111">Media Moguls Urge Congress to Reform Immigration</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Suzanne Gamboa, WTOP-FM (Washington, D.C.), September 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>They weren&rsquo;t as funny as television Comedy Central host Stephen Colbert, but media moguls Rupert Murdoch and Michael Bloomberg made a similar appeal to Congress: Do something about immigration.</p>
<p>Murdoch, the founder of News Corp., urged lawmakers during a hearing Thursday to match attempts to secure the border with efforts to ensure that employers can&rsquo;t hire people illegally.</p>
<p>For his part, Bloomberg, the mayor of New York as well as the founder of the financial news and information service bearing his name, told lawmakers that they should show some leadership on the issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need immigrants,&#8221; Bloomberg said. &#8220;That&rsquo;s the future of this country and whether the public understands that or not it&rsquo;s Congress&rsquo; job to lead.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Murdoch and Bloomberg lead a coalition of businesses and mayors to push for immigration reform. The group supports providing a path to legal status for those in the U.S. illegally. Murdoch himself was born in Australia and, while expanding his interests in U.S. media, became an American citizen in 1985. Citizenship allowed him to own U.S. television stations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Murdoch and Bloomberg said they believe Congress needs to help employers discern between workers authorized to work in the U.S and those who are not. The Obama administration has been auditing employers to find those hiring people illegally.</p>
<p>Rep. Maxine Waters, a Democrat, told Murdoch she thought his support for immigration reform did not match coverage of the immigration issue by Fox News, which is a large part of his News Corp. empire. She said his testimony was contradictory to Fox News &#8220;talking about anchor babies.&#8221; The term, considered derogatory by some, is a reference to children born to at least one illegal immigrant parent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&rsquo;t you use your power to help us to promote what you are talking about?&#8221; Waters asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would say that we do,&#8221; Murdoch said. &#8220;We certainly employ a lot of immigrants at Fox .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and we do not take any consistent anti-immigrant line.&#8221;<br>

		<p>For politicians that want amnesty, here&rsquo;s a proposal:  they have to be criminally and civilly for the problems that illegals will costs, they have to pay for their education, they have to pay for the social services for them (in Spanish), and they have to pay for their health care.  Oh, I think they should also be financially responsible for all the kids illegals have.  </p>

		<p>You might notice that it is the wealthy elite that promotes illegal and high levels of legal immigration because they have so mucho moolah that it will not affect them negatively at all. They can afford to send their kids to the few remaining majority white schools,and if us working class peos suffer from the negative  effects of it, so what?What matters to them is that they have theirs. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s always easier for the enemies of our people to go to the top - get the 1% heads of TV networks, mainline churches, labor unions, political parties to go their way, go against us - when you have most of the money and control the social ladder at elite colleges, social sets - that&rsquo;s the way it works.</p>
<p>We must be very firm and let it be known to the likes of Fox news that they can&rsquo;t betray us on this and keep us as viewers, supporters.</p>
<p>If Fox News goes Neo Conservative:</p>
<p>Open borders immigration - cheapest labor<br>
Endless foreign wars in the Middle East<br>
Endless borrowing to pay for 1 and 2 </p>
<p>We have to put the word out that Fox News is the same as the rest of the corrupt MSM.</p>

		<p>Thank you Mr. Murdoch. You have confirmed what American nationalists and patriots have known for a long time: Fox News and its neo-con lineup from Hannity to O&rsquo;Reilly, from the dopey Fox blondes pretending to be legal experts and news anchors on your channels, to the unctuous Ben Stein and Neil Cavuto, could care less if America is morphing into South Africa. </p>
<p>As long as Mr. Murdoch and Mr. Bloomberg&rsquo;s media empires&rsquo; garnish massive profits, who cares what happens to white people in the US or Europe?  Never seen one story on Fox, let alone Bloomberg News, about the discrimination whites face in hiring, in college admissions and in access to the levers of power.</p>

		<p>No we do not need any immigrants. NO country can allow massive immigration continuously and remain the country it was. We don&rsquo;t have the jobs or ecology to support immigration anymore. We take in 2 million legally a year, half of whom require some form of public assistance. That would total 20 million a decade and 10 million welfare recipients a decade. This needs to not only be halted but reversed. Illegals go home and most of those here legally shouldn&rsquo;t have their visas or whatever renewed. All Murdoch and Bloomberg want is cheap slave labor and they don&rsquo;t care if they destroy the country.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Murdoch and Bloomberg are calling for amnesty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neither of them know anything about the real geopolitical scene in this country today as it relates to ongoing societal factors that are causing a burden on benefits and the job market.</p>
<p>In other words, their opinions should be regarded as less influential than the average aware activist who follows the political and societal scenes pretty close.</p>
<p>But to get even more specific and right to the point:  Both of them should be completely ignored.  Playing a rigged stock market and making millions doesn&rsquo;t qualify them to offer pinions on other matters, especially those dealing with the make up of the population of this country.</p>
<p>They live in the same fantasy world as George Soros, who is a very sick man.</p>

		<p>Our southern border already looks like the blurry stuff they put over naked body parts on non-premium cable TV channels. If our politicians once again reward illegals with citizenship then we may as well just completely erase the border because in ten years we will have another 20 million illegals demanding amnesty.</p>
<p>The only thing we can count on federal government to do about illegal aliens is to sue the states who try to deal with the problem on their own. I think it needs to be dealt with on a local level. </p>
<p>If enough city and county governments pass their own ordinances to keep illegals out of their jurisdictions the justice department lawyers will end up looking like they are playing that carnival game in which the hammer-wielding contestant tries to hit the things that pop out the holes. </p>
<p>If enough county sheriffs follow in Sheriff Joe&rsquo;s footsteps the D.C. gang won&rsquo;t have enough hours in the day to treat all of them the way they try to treat that great Arizona lawman.</p>
<p>Those of us who don&rsquo;t live in the abstract world of Washington, D.C. have the megalomaniacs who do live in that skewed netherworld greatly outnumbered. We don&rsquo;t have to have to come up with anything earth-shattering or new to shut them down. All we have to do is keep starting tiny fires until they get tired of trying to put them all out. </p>

		<p>When you get right down to it, these are just two people.  Yes, two high people, but only two people.  Now contrast that with the 80% of the US population, or perhaps 200,000,000 + people who do not want more immigration.  It must be nice to own a TV network.  </p>

		<p>Murdoch doesn&rsquo;t want to lose the ratings Fox news gets, by having it take an editorial stance reflecting his true, pro-immigration opinions.</p>
<p>Fox&rsquo;s attacks on illegals are just a cynical marketing device. </p>
<p>The network throws a bone to its target audience, while avoiding saying anything substantive on the more important questions involving legal immigration. </p>
<p>Murdoch, Bloomberg, Gates, Soros and other billionaires know that immigration is the Ponzi scheme that is keeping them afloat. If white countries cut off mass immigration, they will see their fortunes decline immediately.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why this unprecedented use of the soapbox by the billionaire&rsquo;s club.</p>

		<p>When limousine liberals think of immigration, they think of the Statue of Liberty, &ldquo;huddled masses yearning to breathe free,&rdquo; and so on.<br>
 <br>
Rich Republicans think of becoming richer Republicans, because that is what a high rate of immigration enables them to become.<br>
 <br>
More immigrants mean more people.  More people mean more consumers and more job applicants.  By the law of supply and demand this means higher prices, lower wages, and consequently higher profits.<br>
 <br>
A high rate of immigration is good for those in the employer/investor class.  It is bad for their employees, and for those who cannot find a job.  </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know if anyone has read Roberto Saviano&rsquo;s book, Gomorrah.  It talks about how the Neopolitan mafia disposes of rivals in wells and poisons the land around it by dumping hazardous waste. The mafia bosses don&rsquo;t mind salting the earth and poisoning the wells because they make money and they&rsquo;re not personally affected. Same with Bloomberg and Murdoch.</p>

		<p>What does this tell you about how totally up the creek the US public really is?   Murdoch is one of the top corporate contributors to the GOP, and he wants blanket amnesty, just like the democrats want.   </p>
<p>Our ruling class wants to turn our entire nation into a coast to coast ghetto of cheap labor, cheap votes, and weak-willed dependent people with gullible lockstep minds, pretty much like the rest of the third world.   And they don&rsquo;t care about the slaughter that will ensue against whites as brown skinned racists with fascist agendas of their own get the run of the landscape.</p>

		<p>Elites pay 70% of the taxes in this nation, contrary to popular opinion.  Elites see a shrinking white base and a rising white age demographic and wonder who will pay for their life-out benefits with so few young, white, people entering into the job markets (and then only as the children of 30-40 somethings).</p>
<p>And finally, yes, Elites get massive kickbacks on profit ratio by hiring those who are &#8216;undocumented&rsquo; because they -don&rsquo;t- have to pay into the system which requires a fair minimum wage and full FICA accountability.</p>
<p>The real problem here is that conventional capitalism itself is what is broken.  A man cannot work hard enough to be worth the joules or calories or watts of consumeables he expends just in the annual process of driving to and from his middle class job.  And the Elites can never compete with Asian wage slavery of a dollar an hour or less (if it&rsquo;s piece work) in manufacturing goods here with U.S. wage levels.  Which means balance of trade and debt service payments are all whackadoodle &#8216;imaginary numbers&rsquo; driven based on functionless motion of currency as digital bits between major international banks, looking to maintain equity in a bankrupt nation by day to day shifts in currency values and (where they&rsquo;ll let you) optioned stock trades.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t massively, rapidly, IMMEDIATELY shift towards automation, this nation will be sunk by the very consumerist stupidity we used to debt leverage the world with.</p>
<p>And that kind of automation means the end of conventional white-vs.-X ethnic debates because it may well be that we are ALL living on a dole rather than employed by X to do Y as makework.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Elites have yet to figure out a way to tax robots and so they pretend the system still works by using human ethnic wage slaves as standins.</p>
<p>And only the rest of us know it is failing.</p>

  <br>
&#8220;A couple of elitist billionaires without any connection to the lives of millions of average Americans, advocating undermining American jobs and wages so they can increase their profits.&#8221;</i>  &mdash;  #6</p>
<p>Bloomberg and Murdoch are internationalists who haven&rsquo;t the slightest concern about &#8220;Americans&#8221; per se. Nor sensing any common  identity with us. This country is just a convenient base (read: wealth and power) for their operations. As soon as its convenience wanes, they will move elsewhere. </p>
<p>Murdoch was born abroad, has a Chinese wife, and only became a US citizen (at least nominally) so he could own American TV stations. He has citizenship &#8220;of convenience&#8221;, that&rsquo;s all. [I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if he has citizenship in several countries.]   He has no more loyalty to this country than he had to the country of his birth, which he dumped when he saw bigger fish to fry. </p>
<p>He and Bloomberg are both international opportunists who hold themselves above the serfs who labor on their many  plantations.  As always, down through history,  the concern of the Ruling Class is for <i>their own kind, </i> not for the serfs.  Serfs (or their modern equivalents)  are expected to keep their mouths shut, know their place,  respect their betters, and do as they are told. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the elites who are causing the White demographic to shrink in the face of wave after wave of third world immigration.  Their assaults on the middle class, their attacks on Christianity, our values, our morals, pushing abortion, militant feminism and homosexuality as norms, etc. has had the effect of reducing the birth rate of White America.  I agree that maybe there are flaws in the capitalist system but it sounds like your proposing communism.  I think a better model would be something similar to National Socialism.  Why does America even need to compete with Asia in the cheap labor market?  Asian goods are generally inferior to American products made a generation ago.  Sure they&rsquo;re cheaper but you&rsquo;ll end up buying some Asian product many times over whereas the American product would last for years.  I know this from experience.  Let&rsquo;s just produce what we need here and trade with other Western Nations who have similar wage levels. Wages go up, the middle class expands, people have children and we don&rsquo;t have to deal with that pesky ethnic element.  </p>

<p>And there are still people out there who believe we have a &#8216;free&rsquo; press with newsrooms that are free to express their consciences.  Fox News is just a cover to allow people to blow off steam, but it never goes any further than that.</p>
<p>The end game is near.  Our future IS South Africa or Brazil, and like in both countries, the liberal, wealthy elites will be fine in their gated fortress-communities, while we regular whites will be strangers in our lands.  The balance has shifted too far to do much about it now.</p>

<p>Murdoch (Bloomberg and their ilk) are not in businness to promote ethics, morality, patriotism, or to serve basic human needs, or worry about the public welfare. They are in business to make <i>money</i>, for themselves,   &mdash;   ANY WAY THEY CAN!   &mdash;   the public be damned.</p>

		<p>I read that Murdoch became (or pretended to become) liberal when he divorced his longtime wife to marry the present one, who is much younger.  However, this doesn&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;ll toss a major moneymaker like Fox News into the same leftist refuse bin where MSNBC now languishes.  <br>
These elitists can blather all they want, but they each have one vote apiece.  Their ideas, both on the left and right, are utterly loony if they support invasion by third-world hordes.  One of the One Nation rally speakers, Deepak Bhagarva, said on Washington Journal that we have a big enough heart to take in everyone!  But what about enough resources?  As an animal lover, I personally have enough heart to take in every stray dog and cat on the planet, but I know I couldn&rsquo;t feed or shelter them.   </p>
