<h1>Mexican Investigator in Falcon Lake Case Beheaded, Officials Say</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CNN, October 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The lead Mexican investigator in the Falcon Lake case, Rolando Armando Flores Villegas, has been killed, his severed head delivered Tuesday in a suitcase to the Mexican military, officials told CNN.</p>
<p>&#8220;His head was delivered to the army garrison this morning in a suitcase after he failed to report back home last night,&#8221; Zapata County, Texas, Sheriff Sigifredo Gonzalez Jr. said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Eva Rodriguez, Flores&rsquo; secretary, said the news of his death came as a surprise. &#8220;We saw [Rolando] last night,&#8221; she said. &#8220;After he came back [from the search for Hartley] we were all together here in the office. That was the last time any of us saw him.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said she was not aware that Flores  &mdash;  whom she described as &#8220;very dedicated to his job&#8221;  &mdash;  had received any threats from narcotraffickers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Sunday, the U.S. Border Patrol, the Coast Guard, and Parks and Wildlife officials were back on the U.S. side of the lake searching for new evidence in the case, said Zapata County Sheriff Sigifredo Gonzales.</p>
<p>Authorities from both nations have been conducting separate searches and holding regular meetings, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Virginia Staab said. But because the disappearance allegedly occurred on the Mexican side of the border, the United States cannot prosecute or make arrests in the case, the sheriff said.</p>
<p>Falcon Lake is a reservoir on the Rio Grande. The U.S.-Mexican border runs through the middle of the lake, with Zapata and Starr counties on the U.S. side.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t believe the level of denial there is in the US as to what is going on in mexico.</p>
<p>This was a direct message to American government, law enforcement and most importantly the American people (the mexican people understand already, quite clearly what they are saying).  The message is that this part of mexico is no longer part of the mexican government&hellip;.a drug warlord rules here.  Disagree?  Your head ends up in a suitcase while &#8220;authorities&#8221; stand by helplessly (or are directly involved under orders from those who are really in charge).  At least a third of mexico is no longer under control of the mexican government.  They have NO say whatsoever about anything.  Another third, their authority is being challenged&hellip;.leading to what is in actuality a civil war, far worse than anything that ever happened in Iraq.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s OUR fault, by the way.  These guys got their start under Reagan as part of his plan to inflict terror on any who had communist leanings.  Decades of neglect and incompetence later, the psychopaths are now in control.  Blowback from illegal and immoral methods of dealing with problems rather then being assertive with the rule of law.</p>
<p>Almost all of their money and power comes from American welfare, the vast majority of which is funneled into the drug trade.  End welfare and you cut these guys off at the knees.</p>
<p>An unwillingness to accept responsibility for what we have done and put a stop to it has this as a consequence.  We MUST learn to say no to drug users, illegal aliens and white liberals&hellip;..forcefully.</p>
<p>Until we do&hellip;&hellip;.</p>

		<p>My girl friend HATES how I relate everything to World War II, like some guys do football and the game of life. But I got her on this one. I tell her, &#8220;We`re 150 miles from the front and the recon teams and commandos are already across the river&hellip; And your friends in Laredo are like refugees!!.. As I wound into my theme I ended with  &#8220;Thank God they don`t have airpower&hellip; yet!!&#8221; To carry the ball one more play I think my &#8220;Propaganda&#8221; is finally getting to her&hellip;</p>

		<p>Interesting to note that in 1916-17 the U.S. Army under General Pershing invaded Mexico for less, and the U.S. Army had been assigned to guard the U.S. Mexico border previous to that.</p>

		<p>It had been suggested that the wife of the missing American man had somehow made up the whole story and there had not been the incident as she described it. NOW we have this. Seems to say that whatever transpired DID GO DOWN [can I use that term, &#8220;go down&#8221;?] as she said it did. Agreed?</p>
<p>This was a drug route used by the smugglers and they killed the Americano to scare off any other trespassers? &#8220;Stay away from ours!!&#8221;</p>

		<p>#3:  Back then, white men were in charge.  Back then, white men were expected to be strong and take care of their women and country.  Back then, white men weren&rsquo;t afraid of being called a racist or a sexist or a xenophobe or any of the other superficial, PC labels we have today.  </p>

		<p>I think the U.S. authorities knew what had occured as soon as it happened.</p>
<p>I think they probably have unattended ground sensors (or waterborne ones) which cover the whole lake area.  I doubt if it&rsquo;s considered high enough value to warrant constant satellite coverage but I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if we couldn&rsquo;t up the ante with 12-14 hour loitering surveillance from smaller UAVs like the Shadow/Hunter.  And _if they would task them_ the MQ-1 and MQ-9 could extend this to upwards of 32hrs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a question of whether the desire to non-enforce border security for the safety of our citizens is backed by a greater desire to be &#8216;incognizant&rsquo; of the drug trade in a way that could be compromising: &#8220;We know exactly how much is coming across the lake, here is the video from the month of August 2011&#8221;, politically.  Because someone somewhere is getting a cut of the action.  There is a lot of (billions with a B) money in narcotics and I have no doubt that, at some level, the USG is in on it.</p>
<p>One thing is certain in my eyes: When Obama chose the low road of forcing another minority influx on whites to empower his party; he became _directly_ responsible for any deaths on his watch which are the result of his political scheming.  </p>
<p>Culpability for negligence and conspiracy in the homocide of David Hartley can and should be squarely laid at his feet since, if there was hard border security, there would be no point in drug bandits being on their side of the lake because their poison would never get through.</p>

		<p>It was stated last week on a Fox News program that poppy production in Afghanistan has grown from 13% to 70% in the years since the U.S. has been there. That alone should make some things perfectl clear. These drugs are getting to the U.S. primarily through Mexico.</p>
<p>If some in the U.S. government and businesses buying their share of the U.S. government weren&rsquo;t deeply involved in receiving proceeds from this illicit business it would have wanted and been able to cut this down to a drip.</p>

		<p>I guess this gets the poor woman off the hook.  No way does some random housewife have enough pull to get a Mexican cop decapitated.  The drug route &#8220;stay away&#8221; theory seems the best one right now.</p>
