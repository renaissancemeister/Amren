<h1>Austria Accused of Violating Child Rights</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Veronika Oleksyn, Salon, October 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Austria should stop detaining children and halt the deportations of well-integrated foreign families that are denied asylum, Amnesty International and three other groups urged Thursday.</p>
<p>The country also should better protect the rights of non-Austrian minors and become more lenient about allowing young asylum seekers and their parents to stay on humanitarian grounds, the organizations, which include Caritas, SOS Kinderdorf and Diakonie, said in a letter to lawmakers.</p>
<p>The appeal comes just days after two 8-year-old twins were taken into custody with their father in an early morning raid and deported back to their native Kosovo. Their mother, who is in psychiatric care, stayed behind. The four had lived in Austria since 2004 but were expelled after being denied asylum and refusing to leave on their own.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&rsquo;t be necessary for the security of the republic to separate two children from their mother and to forcefully get them out of the country,&#8221; the groups wrote in their joint letter presented outside parliament in the Austrian capital, Vienna. {snip}</p>

		<p>&#8220;SOS Kinderdorf&#8221;<br>
 Reminds me of an incident in school for drama class. We were instructed to attend a play about The Holocaust and its affect on children. Started with the words Kinder&hellip; Anybody?!? But I quietly went up to the teacher and announced that I would refuse to attend because I planned to see a comedy in my  valueable spare time instead of an &#8220;in your face&#8221; tragedy or die trying. <br>
  To my great surprise she first told me it wans`t about all that, then suggested I attend a College perfomance of &#8220;The Importance of Being Earnest&#8221; without further critque or comment.<br>
 I returned the favor later when the class began to rise against her for her bruising and sarcastic demeanor toward the students.<br>
 I told the class that I had just realized that she was merely treating the class as a director would his actors in some sort of immersion thereapy for night school students. My classmates went hmmm and were a lot more gracious to her after that&hellip;</p>

		<p>This reminds me of the much-ballyhooed case of Arigona Zogaj, a nice teenage girl and by all accounts well-liked and a good student. Unfortunately, she was the ONLY one in her extended illegal Albanian family who wasn´t criminal.</p>
<p>- As in the US, illegals in Austria do not routinely face deportation unless they engage in other unseemly activities, and as &#8220;family reunification&#8221; is a priority, this includes the dependents. Those we call &#8220;Gutmenschen&#8221; (roughly: &#8220;do-gooders&#8221;) want to turn the children (as &#8220;innocent&#8221;) into a kind of anchor babies in these cases. But there HAS to be a line drawn somewhere.</p>
<p>So, cry me a Danube.</p>

&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be necessary for the security of the republic to separate two children from their mother and to forcefully get them out of the country,&rdquo; the groups wrote.* <br>
***************************<br>
Of course it isn&rsquo;t necessary to separate the children from their mother. The simple solution is to send the twins, their father AND their mother ALL back to their country of origin together. That way there is no family breakup attributable to the government of Austria. PLUS Austria doesn&rsquo;t have to continue paying for the mother&rsquo;s psychiatric care which she should be getting in her own country (if she really needs it.) Third world countries have long had a habit of trying to off-load their mentally troubled citizens on some other, presumably wealthier (read whiter) country.</p>

		<p>The parents are responsible for the fate of their children not the government. The parents of this child knew that their petition for asylum had been denied and they would have to return to their country of origin but they refused to leave. They put their children in a position to experience this trauma, not the government.</p>

		<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t Amnesty International seem to care about whites in their own countries?  I guess they believe that whites are created to serve all the others?</p>

		<p>I might disagree for once, If they are White Christian, ethnic Serbs from Kosovo, they can integrate very easily into Ausie society and become productive white nationalists, what was done to those poor people is truly tragic as a white South African, I understand. If they are Muslim Albanians from Kosovo well they just stole a large country from decent people why don&rsquo;t they want to stay in the utopia they created so load them in a rubber duck kick it unto the waves and shout &#8220;Good luck old chap and may the force be with you&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Hmmm&hellip;.Kosovo was stolen from Serbia so that Muslims could have a Muslim base/country in Europe.  So what is so bad about throwing Muslims out of Austria and returning them to Muslim Kosovo?  Because they need more Muslims in Austria for the final asault on Vienna!</p>

		<p>Poster #6 - I agree with the general sentiment of your post, but we have taken in enough ex-Yugoslavs on humanitarian grounds (and via normal migration) as is, as far as many Austrian nationalists are concerned. They do integrate reasonably well (despite being obviously proud of their own ethnic identity) but Austrians, while not strictly a homogenous people, are mostly of German ethnicity and many of us nationalists would like to keep it that way, even if none but the most extreme have no problem with moderate (which it has up to now been anything but) migration of most other (European) peoples to our country.</p>
<p>And as for the asylum &#8220;industry&#8221;, the whole thing is a farce. These &#8220;psychological problems&#8221; always come up sooner or later (obviously a known trick to draw out the process - don&rsquo;t get me wrong, if it is genuine they have my sympathy but I&rsquo;m doubtful in 90%+ cases it is). These asylum seekers often manage to draw out the process for many years, so obviously they are aware of the tricks, and/or well-advised by lefty-liberal humanitarian groups on how best to get residency. In the end it costs the taxpayer a fortune. </p>
<p>Sure, when there are kids involved it could be handled a little more delicately but most people want a tougher stance on the issue and I&rsquo;m not complaining when that&rsquo;s what we get. The parents, too, need to take responsibility - when they are asked by authorities to leave the country and do not, they should well be able to imagine the outcome may not be pleasant for them or their family. Ideally, though, we need a much quicker turnaround for unsuccesful applicants, where kids are not half-integrated and then removed, or where it drags on for years and costs tens, or even hundreds of thousands of Euros.</p>
