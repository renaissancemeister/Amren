			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hindustan Times (New Delhi), October 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel demanded on Monday that Muslims living in Germany conform to &#8220;fundamental German values&#8221;, saying there was no leeway on the issue. She spoke a day after Germany&rsquo;s largely ceremonial president, Christian Wulff, had reached out to Muslims in a speech marking 20 years of reunification, assuring them they belonged.</p>
<p>Wulff&rsquo;s remarks were welcomed by one of the country&rsquo;s main Islamic groups, the Central Council of Muslims.</p>
<p>The Christian Democrat chancellor, in remarks promoting a fiercely conservative book by one of her supporters, said Muslims in Germany must orient themselves without reservation to Germany&rsquo;s fundamental values and constitution.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no leeway on this,&#8221; she said, adding that Germans&rsquo; perceptions of Islam were dominated by Sharia (Islamic law), the lack of equality between men and women and honour killings.</p>
<p>The book by Roland Koch, a former premier of the state of Hesse who retired this year to go into business, is titled &#8220;Conservative. No State Can Be Built Without Values and Principles&#8221;.</p>
<p>Germany had freedom of religion, and Islam was welcome, &#8220;but it must be a form of Islam that feels devoted to our fundamental values&#8221;, Merkel said. If it were not, fears would develop among Germans, &#8220;and that is hardly something we want to happen&#8221;.</p>
<p>Merkel also criticised talks that have been under way for years between the federal interior ministry and leading Muslim groups in which both sides have tried to articulate concerns about the other.</p>
<p>The results had been &#8220;unsatisfactory&#8221;, said Merkel, adding, &#8220;extra work will have to be done&#8221;. She said she wanted German Muslim children to be taught their faith in public schools and she wanted imams at German mosques who spoke German.</p>
<p>President Wulff had spoken more embracingly the previous day, saying, &#8220;Christianity belongs in Germany. Judaism belongs in Germany. And by now, Islam also belongs in Germany.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was in Germany&rsquo;s national interest to prevent prejudice from festering and people being excluded, he said.</p>
<p>In remarks to the mass-circulation newspaper Bild, the Central Council of Muslims responded, &#8220;Wulff&rsquo;s speech was a sign that Muslims are not second-class citizens.&#8221;</p>
<p>The speech was a &#8220;clear, unambiguous and important signal to Muslims living in Germany&#8221;, Council president Aiman Mazyek said, adding, &#8220;Different conceptions of one&rsquo;s life and diversity are being welcomed.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Islam is is much more than a religion, it is a stern, no-compromise, all-controlling lifestyle incompatible with modern Western secularism and independent freedom.  Islam determines what you wear, what you eat, how you behave, how you think, what time you get up and go to sleep. Under Islam, all infidels (non-Muslims) must either be converted or killed.  It simply does not fit with our society.  </p>
<p>Bringing Muslims into Western societies is insane and must end immediately.  There are over 40 Islamic countries into which Muslims can immigrate.  They do not need to come here.  We gain nothing from their presence.  <br>

		<p>So Merkel demands that &#8220;Muslims Should Confirm to German Values&#8221;.</p>
<p>My counterquestion is: What if they won&rsquo;t?  <br>
Will they be deported, fined, or imprisoned by the German government in that case?  Will they face any consequences at all?</p>
<p>From the observation of past events, I&rsquo;m certain that none of the options will be applied, since either of them would be deemed racist. As much as I find the idea absurd that an increasing number of muslims will ever assimilate into German Society, one should at least place conditions and warnings as to what will happen if the demands are not met. If a violation of an agreement doesn&rsquo;t result in negative consequences, what is the purpose of the agreement in the first place?</p>

		<p>That some whites expect muslims to assimilate demonstrates just how naive, or idealistic they are. our leaders fail to understand that they are dealing with a people and religion that are so different than civilized western civilization that assimilation  is impossible. There is no way islam will take a submissive position to some western government.  </p>

<p>The problem with THIS statement by Angela Merkel&hellip;</p>
<p><br>
<i>German Chancellor Angela Merkel demanded on Monday that Muslims living in Germany conform to &ldquo;fundamental German values&rdquo;, saying there was no leeway on the issue.</i> </p>
<p><br>
&hellip;is that it can&rsquo;t be reconciled with THIS statement by Angela Merkel&hellip; </p>
<p><br>
<i>She said she wanted German Muslim children to be taught their faith in public schools and she wanted imams at German mosques who spoke German.</i></p>
<p><br>
Achtung, Frau Merkel: you can teach Muslims their faith OR  you can teach them to be Germans BUT NOT BOTH. What you are advising is a contradiction in terms: you want to promote Islamism and you simultaneously want to promote German identity. You are trying to &#8220;have it both ways&#8221;   &mdash;   but where Muslims are concerned that is quite simply NOT POSSIBLE. </p>

		<p>Religion makes slaves of these people; they are not capable of being German unless they abandon their insane beliefs (which we know they will not).</p>
<p>They love Allah and they will do anything he wants them to, no one will be able to convince them otherwise. If you have mass numbers of Muslims moving into your neighborhood, I suggest migrating elsewhere.<br>

		<p>Having been under the American thumb for so many years has had a corrosive effect on the Germans and these insane remarks are just one example. The multicult rubbish being exported to the world by us is toxic and destructive. It&rsquo;s not working here, it won&rsquo;t work there. Communism came and went and the Europeans survived.

		<p>This will continue until there is a major blood-letting.  The muslims will start to lopping heads off and the Germans will cower and hide.  They have no way to defend themselves and have been taught that they are evil.</p>

		<p>Merkel demands that all muslims conform to German values, but the reality is that they will not.  They want to change every thing as they see fit.  The only smart and sensible thing to do is to kick muslims out of Germany and out of Europe and Westernized countries altogether.</p>

		<p>Anon.#1 makes an essential point which cannot be stressed enough:</p>
<p> <i>&#8220;Islam is is much more than a religion. It is a stern, all-controlling lifestyle incompatible with modern Western secularism and freedom. Islam determines what you wear, what you eat,&#8221; etc, etc&hellip;</i></p>
<p>Exactly! This is precisely what so many naive people simply cannot understand. You will be accused of being prejudiced against the Moslem &#8220;religion&#8221;, or the government will prosecute you for spreading &#8220;racial&#8221; hate.   In neither case, is the objection  religious or racial.  It is their CULTURAL incompatibility that makes them objectionable.  And it is the ferocious TENACITY of that rigid culture that makes them unassimilable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Islam is determined to convert and assimilate YOU, not the reverse. It is dedicated to your (eventual) conquest and/or displacement   &mdash;    however long it takes.  That is another way of saying &#8220;your destruction&#8221;. Therefore, it is sheer madness to allow the importation of millions of immigrants who are dedicated to the destruction of your country, your culture, your people. </p>
<p>Those starry-eyed, idealistic lefties who are certain that Moslems will soften up  and come around after a few generations in the West, are playing a dangerous game. What if they are wrong?</p>

What this woman and too many others fail to believe is that being a devote Muslims trumps everything else. You can&rsquo;t be a Muslim and also adhere to German values. The two are mutually exclusive to Muslims.</p>
<p>Are these people deaf, dumb, and blind or do they really believe Muslims can be just like us?</p>

I disagree that multiracialism is an &#8220;Anglo-American&#8221; ideology, even though this &#8220;toxic rubbish&#8221; is exported and imposed under the American flag. </p>
<p>Other than that one detail, you are absolutely right; and I heartily agree with everything else that you say. <br>

It is not a question of religion but of race. Germany was founded on blood and soil - white blood and European soil.  </p>
<p>When someone says &#8216;Muslim&rsquo; they mean a national from North African or Asian civilization.</p>

		<p>I have been to Munich for the Oktoberfest, I have traveled to Berlin after the re-unification, and much of the rest of Germany  I have also traveled to Paris, much of the rest of France, Italy, and elsewhere in Europe.</p>
<p>Not all French people are nasty and snooty.  I have met friendly French people in France.</p>
<p>Germany, France, Italy and other European countries are much more liberal on beer, wine, and other alcoholic beverages, more so than America.  In many European countries, minors under 21 can even buy beer and wine in grocery stores.</p>
<p>The European countries are so liberal on nudity, that it is no big deal in France and Germany for there to be a nude woman on prime time television.</p>
<p>The city park in Munich, Germany has a section where both sexes of all ages can legally sunbathe in the nude.</p>
<p>Pork is a regular part of all of Europe&rsquo;s classic cuisine.</p>
<p>Classic art that offends Muslims as idolatry, is normally accepted art culture in Europe and America.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that Muslim culture and religion are incompatible threats to European cultures.  The European countries should curtail Muslim immigration to preserve their national heritage and culture.</p>
<p>It is good that today&rsquo;s Germany has taken responsibility for Nazi Holocaust.  But that does not mean that Germany should allow the Muslims to take over their culture and transform Germany into a Muslim country.  During WW11, there was a Muslim Waffen SS Legion.</p>
<p>Muslims are even willing to get killed in suicide missions to kill &#8220;infidels&#8221; and spread Islam, as can be seen with 9-11.  Is America, Australia, and are the European countries willing to fight to stop the Muslims from taking over and forcing the rest of us to either convert to Islam or have our heads chopped off!? </p>
<p>If Angela Merkel thinks that Muslims want to assimilate into German life and culture, she has never read the Koran!</p>

		<p>More lies from the elite,according to the agreement between the eussr and the &#8220;arab league of europe&#8221;muslims will NOT be forced to integrate,will have virtual autonomy over thier ghettos,and be able to practice thier culture without restraint,in return for this largesse they promise not to kill us.So every time you hear a nwo mouthpiece declaring a new drive towards &#8220;integration&#8221;remember that it is nothing but the manipulation of public sentiment,deciept and deception to prevent the people from opposing the islamification of enlightened western societies.</p>

		<p>Merkel is lying, lying, lying, because she knows perfectly well that among German (and all) Muslims, the penalty for &#8220;conforming to German/Christian/Jewish/European/modern values&#8221; is DEATH.  </p>
<p>the penalty for trying to leave the Muslim faith is DEATH.</p>
<p>the penalty for in any way &#8220;insulting or offending&#8221; Islam is DEATH.</p>
<p>and finally, the penalty for trying to get Muslims to conform to German values is DEATH.</p>
<p>secretly, the German political class is hoping that if enough pressure is put on Muslims to conform, a substantial number of them will leave.</p>
<p>let us hope they&rsquo;re right, because once Muslims have power in Europe, they are planning to create a society that makes Hitler&rsquo;s Germany looks soft, progressive, and permissive by comparison.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t blame Merkel&rsquo;s socialist ideology on the US.  Merkel is an EAST German.  She was brought up in Marxist schools and taught the universality of mankind.  Taught that the world is composed of workers and exploiters - and the workers no matter what nationality (or religion) were all cut from the same cloth.  She was taught such things as the New Soviet Man - wherein muslims from Turkistan and Chechnya were just as good Soviets as the Mongols from east USSR or the Georgians of Russia.  In short, she thinks IDEOLOGY is the binding glue, not ethnicity, not religion, not race.</p>

		<p>Finally, a European leader with a backbone&hellip;she is right to nip this growing threat in the bud before it gets way out of control. Anonymous #1 is correct: Islam is a mind- and life-controlling oppressive force that allows for no leeway. Muslims will not compromise when it comes to their religion and I predict this will lead to bloodshed. Muslims cannot and will not integrate into Western society and must be driven back to the gates of Vienna like in ancient times&hellip;</p>

<p>Moslems are tenacious, clannish, determined, proud of their culture, dedicated to a cause, and fanatical. Modern Germans are  <i>none</i> of those things.</p>
<p>Modern Germans have been brainwashed with tolerance, shame, guilt and self-hate. And especially with love for the Other.  Islam is a fanatical cult, swollen with arrogant pride,  which has no respect for tolerance and has contempt for all others.  </p>

Music is evil<br>
Movies are evil<br>
Magazines are evil<br>
Cartoons are evil<br>
Pictures of Mohammad are really, really evil<br>
Education for women is evil<br>
Science is evil<br>
Pork chops, bacon, and sausages are evil (they could be   correct on this one).<br>
Skirts are evil<br>
Blouses are evil<br>
Woman&rsquo;s hair, wrists, &amp; ankles are evil<br>
Women drivers are evil<br>
Christains are evil<br>
Jews are evil<br>
The Bible is Evil<br>
Buddha is evil<br>
Free speech is evil<br>
Freedom of the press is evil<br>
Freedom of Religion is evil<br>
Using logic and facts is evil<br>
Thinking for one&rsquo;s self is evil<br>
Personal (independent) freedom is evil<br>
Not killing your enemies is evil<br>
But, at least killing non-believers is good, including innocent women and children of non-believers who are on buses or planes or restaurants (i.e., anyone who is not a Muslim)<br>
Honor killings are good<br>
Stoning people to death is good<br>
Chopping off hands is good<br>
Beheading people and posting it on U-Tube is honorable and divine<br>

		<p>Interrogatories for Miss Merkel:</p>
<p>1.  Define &#8220;fundamental German values.&#8221;</p>
<p>2.  When did Germany become a proposition nation?</p>
<p>3.  How can you say that non-Germans can adhere to &#8220;fundamental German values&#8221; when &#8220;German&#8221; in the German language is &#8220;Deutsch,&#8221; the etymology of which is &#8220;the people?&#8221;  There is no such thing as a &#8220;fundamental German value,&#8221; because German/Deutsch isn&rsquo;t a value or a creed, it is a noun the represents a certain group of particular people.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the English word &#8220;German&#8221; ultimately comes from the Latin word which means &#8220;neighbor,&#8221; as they were the Roman&rsquo;s northern neighbors. </p>

<p>That <i>sounds</i> woefully naive. But its actually amounts to a public announcement by a mainstream politician that moslems living in Germany are <i>NOT</i> conforming to &#8220;fundamental German values&#8221;.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;There is no leeway on this,&rdquo; she said, adding that Germans&rsquo; perceptions of Islam were dominated by Sharia (Islamic law), the lack of equality between men and women and honour killings.</i></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s certainly a bold statement. Sentiments such as that, albeit true, had been taboo in public discourse. But she managed to get it out there in a very public and non controversial way. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where all this is leading but she wouldn&rsquo;t be saying this if it didn&rsquo;t represent majority opinion. She is a political, after all.</p>

		<p>What is happening in the European Union as well as what has been happening with our immigration since 1965 certainly has the appearance of the work of the Fabian Socialists.  This is the slow but sure approach to a global &#8220;soft dictatorship&#8221;.  The way that the leftist global cabal turned on South Africa is another example of how they operate.  They are also putting the hooks on us  &mdash;  just look at the Obama administration&rsquo;s attack on Arizona.  It is very much like the &#8220;ganging-up&#8221; tactic used against South Africa.  Obama has used the Democrat cities, then the Justice Department, then the United Nations and now most of the South American countries to gang-up on Arizona.  </p>

		<p>To #20, Merkle is not a brave leader, she is just talking out of both sides of her mouth like so many other politicians.  You have to pay close attention because they are always contradicting themselves  &mdash;  just like Obama.</p>
