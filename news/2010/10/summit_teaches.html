<h1>Summit Teaches Kids Anti-Prejudice Messages</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Katherine Dorsett and LaTrina White, CNN, October 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Each fall, the three-day event brings students together from private and public middle schools with a wide range of demographics to tackle issues of racism, stereotypes, prejudice and bullying.</p>
<p>Summit organizers said students often do not have the means or the vocabulary to address intolerance. The event helps students learn how to recognize their own biases and overcome prejudices, as well as tackle the issue of bullying in school, through various small group exercises and discussions.</p>
<p>More than 5,000 students and 400 school counselors throughout metro Atlanta have participated in the POP Summit since its inception in 1997.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see the summit as a starting point of discovery and we hope students will continue this exploration throughout the year and throughout their lives,&#8221; said Richard Welch, a POP facilitator. &#8220;One day can&rsquo;t change someone, but it&rsquo;s a start.&#8221;</p>
<p>Students selected to attend POP are pegged as top leaders and performers in their respective schools. They are encouraged to take the lessons they&rsquo;ve learned at POP and teach them to their peers.</p>

There is no wonder why schools are failing. They&rsquo;re not teaching, they&rsquo;re brainwashing.</p>
<p>The teachers, administrators, and the back-room manipulators are gushing over the idea they just saved the world from racism, sexism, homophobia, et.al.</p>
<p>The kids are left more confused than ever.<br>

		<p>And yet intolerance and hate increases (and that&rsquo;s not even counting slander of violence against whites as intolerance - whites don&rsquo;t normally count for them as people, whites only come into it when oppressor need named) as if the same folks in charge of sex education have now been been put in charge of sensitivity training. </p>

		<p>Making neat little pro-socialist egalitarians and diversity conformist Nazis out of one and all the ignorant little rich kids on the perceptual basis of personal reward rather than factual truth.</p>
<p>How DO YOU explain to children that X isn&rsquo;t worth Y becomes he comes from a poor background, can&rsquo;t speak the language, may not have the IQ to contribute and exists in a culture notorious for not even graduating high school (70% dropout rate of Hispanics in LA) before starting a TFR 3.2 family (50% unwed teenage pregnancy rates) to start the process all over again?</p>
<p>Oh, I know!  You send the little &#8216;Community Organizers&rsquo; down south to Mexico for a rite of passage: &#8220;He who makes it back to the border alive must show video of how people really live in the country they refuse to stop being loyal too.  But cannot get away from fast enough.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;students often do not have the means or the vocabulary to address intolerance&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would suggest that this summit will not provide the &ldquo;means or the vocabulary&rdquo; to address the weighty topic of interracial and inter-cultural competition, which underlies that which is dubbed &ldquo;intolerance&rdquo;.</p>
<p>On a positive note, children instinctively sense when adults are trying too hard to sell them baloney.</p>

		<p>Teach your children well, from birth, until they go to School, and you will have Racially aware children, for life. </p>
<p>It can be done, and it has been done, so do it. Do it every day, in everything that they do, and they will know the truth, which no one can undo.</p>
<p>The best part about this is that they go forward and teach the same thing to their peers, who get a good dose of truth, and then pass it on. </p>
<p>Keep your children separate in all things from other Races. At Parks, if any non-Whites showed up, we always left, to go to another Park. And we told our children why we were leaving, too. </p>
<p>Eventually, they get to resent being pushed out of what is rightfully theirs, by foreigners.</p>

		<p>Amen, poster #5!  We did it, too.  The kids are now adults and are glad they were raised the way they were.   If you&rsquo;re going to have children, teach them well.  </p>

		<p>My my. In the 19th century, when we educated farmers for a few cents a day to be far more literate and adept in math than in the twelve grand and above per year per student urban schools, we taught the Ten Commandments, The Golden Rule, the Sermon on the Mount, and enforced them with a switch or belt. The ACLU would have been laughed out of town.</p>
<p>Students had then the &#8220;language&#8221; not to bully folks, to read about the world in a newspaper(obsolete now) and to respect parents, teachers, country, and authority in general. Many of these hicks (as a NY Times columnist today would regard them)also played acoustic instruments, including piano, and played well. </p>
<p>But these kids were disadvantaged.They weren&rsquo;t black.</p>

		<p>I know that most Holier than Thou Teachers here are preaching<br>
Anti-Racism, Gay acceptance, Feminism, and Environmentalism,<br>
And, it is almost like a Religion with Them.<br>
I wonder how Our Teachers do when They<br>
come up against Socially Conservative<br>
(say South Asian) Cultures that are<br>
Anti-Gay, and disapprove of mixed Marriages.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s most amazing about this story is that an MSM outlet got through a whole story about teaching students the &#8220;anti-prejudice&#8221; messages without once mentioning certain poverty centers or defamation leagues.  Now, odds are, they&rsquo;re behind this pedagogy, and in fact, making money off of selling the materials to schools.</p>

		<p>My husband, a teacher, has kids come in at lunch for detention, and they must eat standing up against the wall instead of sitting and talking. An administrator came in today and said, &#8220;I&rsquo;m not comfortable with that.&#8221; My husband asked, &#8220;Why not?&#8221; The administrator said, &#8220;Because that&rsquo;s PUNISHMENT.&#8221;</p>
<p>Uh&hellip;.yeah..that&rsquo;s the point. </p>
<p>(Although my husband (15-yr teacher) calmly explained he was teaching that decisions have consequences just as in real life, the administrator (no teaching experience) said he was setting up a meeting for him with the school psych. </p>
<p>If they would just get out of the way&hellip;..<br>
