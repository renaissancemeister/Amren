			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jason DeParle, New York Times, October 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Even as officials rage at what they have called the &#8220;invasion&#8221; of illegal immigrants, mostly Mexicans, Arizona has welcomed thousands of legal immigrants from such grief-torn lands as Somalia, Myanmar and Iraq, and is known for treating them unusually well.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Arizona took in about 4,700 refugees last year, but is thought to have about 375,000 illegal immigrants. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last year, the federal government admitted about 75,000 refugees, out of 10.5 million worldwide, and it covers most resettlement costs. State officials administer the money and help decide how many refugees they can take; private agencies do the casework, helping find housing and jobs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Refugees seem slow to sympathize [with illegals]. The two groups often compete for jobs or housing, and some refugees say Latino gangs have preyed on them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have some problems with the Mexican people; they stole my goats,&#8221; [a Sudanese goat farmer] said. &#8220;If they don&rsquo;t have documents, they should go back to their country.&#8221;</p>

<p>These examples, like the black/Hispanic riots and fighting in the streets, is what this country will look like with or without whites.</p>
<p>If there are no whites, other whipping boys will be identified and targeted by all groups, aiming at those outside their own racial tribe.  The reasons for doing so will be some feeble excuse that is for the purpose of making the complainers victims. </p>
<p>All this anti-white hatred will be redirected at other groups in areas where there are no whites.</p>
<p>Not much promise of becoming a racially harmonious utopia is it?</p>

<p>Boy-O-Boy, that just warms my heart!</p>
<p>To think that I (of all people) might find a reason to tentatively like the illegal Mexican invaders, and here it is in black and brown. Of all the things the USA does not need, it is a Sudanese goat farmer. He complains that the Mexicans have stolen his goats, but how long will it be until he is saying that whites have &ldquo;deprived&rdquo; him of his &ldquo;rights,&rdquo; and then be seeking some form of governmental or legal lotto in compensation? How long will it be until he feels that the loss of the goats was nothing, when compared to the loss of his &ldquo;rights&rdquo; because of fantasized &ldquo;racism&rdquo; and redistributive multicultural realities, in other words?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Pray tell why we are letting in Sudanese goat farmers when at least 15 million people are out of work and the government is amassing a debt of titanic preportions? Has this country completely lost its mind?! </p>

		<p>An unforeseen consequence of America&rsquo;s endless wars is the displacement of thousands of people which our leadership then feel compelled to bring to the U. S.   &mdash;  - at the rate of about 75,000 a year (sometimes many thousands more than that), whatever the costs to local communities and effects on social cohesion in the U. S.</p>
<p>For a superb introduction to the federal government&rsquo;s &#8220;refugee resettlement&#8221; project, watch a short video (10 minutes) and for an equally superb introduction to how the Feds target local communities (10 minute video).  See both at this link:<br>

		<p>This doesn&rsquo;t even involve places where the U.S. was sticking its nose into; <i>any</i> place in the world which happens to have a war and displaced populations produces &#8220;refugees&#8221; that can be resettled in a White country. Which means, a free shipment of extra Africans that we can no longer afford.</p>
<p>This refugee racket should be shut down, worldwide, and ASAP.</p>

<p>Goats and sheep are why anywhere the muslims are has become a desert&hellip;.The muslim countries were not always desert, only since the inception of muslim ideaology did those countries become deserts. In the past, Iraq was fought over because of the arable land and now, FROM EXPERIENCE most of Iraq is a dusty wasteland with only the very small swath of land between the rivers being arable now. The Saudi experience is what America has to look forward to if the muslims get control and start goat and sheep herding all over America.</p>

		<p>We have Sudanese goat farmers?  In Arizona?  I hope refugees are forced to repatriate once the conflict in their native land is resolved.  I mena, it nmakes perfect sense, doesn&rsquo;t it?  We graciously allow them to hide out here while things are settled back home, so then, when everything&rsquo;s safe for them, they should have to go back.  However, knowing the liberal immigration laws our country is burdened with, I dought that is the case.  Lemme guess, the refugees may apply for and easily receive citizenship just like any long-term resident can.</p>

		<p>The pro-immigration lobby which controls Washington wanted that Sudanese goat farmer.</p>
<p>They know that he and his offspring will consume millions of dollars in goods and services in their lifetime.  All that economic activity will become units of money which will eventually trickle up to the elite shareholders of the economy.</p>
<p>Immigration is a Ponzi scheme which needs to be continuously fed, by illegal Mexicans, by Kenyan &#8216;refugees&rsquo;, or by Sudanese goat farmers - anyone will do.</p>

		<p>The obvious comment is that (from Arizona&rsquo;s perspective) 4,700 vs. 375,000 is an easy choice if the levels of transfer payment are at all similar.  Even if the Hispanics are better workers and generally more capable of -economically- integrating with our society, the smaller initial economic burden (30,000 a year in combined welfare and educational benefits plus Section 8 housing = 141 million for the smaller group vs. 11.25 billion for the larger one) is going to be an order of magnitude easier to take on as tax base &#8216;debt&rsquo;.</p>
<p>That said, the ultimate endgame must still be addressed: either this Sudanese will live single and die alone with no marriage opportunities as a &#8216;one generation American&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Or he will need to find a woman from his own _culture_ as much as skin color because it is highly likely that American blacks will turn up there noses at his &#8220;I&rsquo;m a happy goat herder!&#8221; SES and cultural innocence as much as any other racial group would.</p>
<p>And when you do bring these two wonderful Sudanese folks together, you should probably look at their indigenous TFRs and DOUBLE THEM as indeed happens in the U.S. for Mexican Women (2.4 south of the border, 3.2 to 4.4 in the States).</p>
<p>Will these 6-8 Sudanese American children be better able to participate in our culture?  In some ways.  They will likely speak &#8216;street english&rsquo; better than their parents.  And they will certainly be used to the ammenities of running water, electricity and XBox rather than burning dried goat dung to cook breakfast.</p>
<p>But if Hispanics are any indication, the children&rsquo;s work ethic will be lower, their luxury good expectations higher and their social mobility no better in terms of expectations of gainful employment outside the most menial of service industries.</p>
<p>As indeed, it is highly unlikely that, &#8216;welcomed warmly&rsquo; or otherwise, they will have the technical or social intelligence* to do more than subsistence survive in contemporary American society.  Not with a mean IQ in the range 75-80.</p>
<p>And if they can&rsquo;t succeed beyond their wildest dreams as the white person is (unfairly) television-depicted as doing, they will give up.  Because the ammenities of life are only wonderful it if you get to enjoy them, for free, as you did in your childhood.  And social welfare pays as much if not more -for the perception- of free time to enjoy life than minimum wage scut labor does at Burger King.</p>
<p>This is another hazard of importing a lifestyle as much as racial norm outside our own.  People in the 3rd world work to a much different, &#8216;as needed&rsquo;, labor schedule than we do.</p>
<p>And what then?  Will these young people be treated as &#8216;refugees one generation removed&rsquo;?  Or will they simply sink into the quagmire of a native population index to whom our social services offer less and less while &#8216;warmly greeting&rsquo; the next wave of their replacements?</p>

*Looking back, I _seriously_ doubt if WASP, Irish or Southern European immigrants of the 1700s or even 1890-1923 waves would do well here, either.  We live in an incredibly competitive world which is looking down the gun barrel of largely homogenous and industriously driven, East Asian, societies with a 105-108 (one half-MSD) IQ superiority leverage over us.  If you don&rsquo;t arrive in the world with -at least- a potential 110 IQ (i.e. lowend Jewish range), you are not going to be capable of competing with that in terms of -affording- a middle class lifestyle, anywhere.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s assuming that a 3rd World America can afford to pay a professional class the wages that a service and welfare dependent society can generate.</p>
