			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>DeForest B. Soaries Jr., Wall Street Journal, October 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} His [Bishop Eddie Long of Atlanta] fancy cars, expensive clothing and vast estate, all funded on a multimillion-dollar salary, are part of his act  &mdash;  pushing the so-called prosperity gospel on mostly African-Americans. Whatever Mr. Long has done in his personal life, his brand of theology has contributed to a troubling trend among black churches in America.</p>
<p>The prosperity gospel  &mdash;  the idea that God guarantees truly faithful believers physical health and financial wealth  &mdash;  is not new. But cable and satellite television broadcasting have turned prosperity preachers into celebrities that have followings similar to musicians and movies stars. A movement and a theology that once seemed like an aberration among black churches now appears to be mainstream.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Of course, it is much easier for clergy to preach this gospel when they are living proof that the &#8220;system&#8221; works. Hence the celebrity-like lifestyles of so many religious leaders. The fact that the people most likely to do well in the prosperity gospel movement are the people at the top suggests that it is all an ecclesiastical pyramid scheme.</p>
<p>Traditionally, black churches have emphasized spiritual renewal, social justice, educational uplift, community improvement and civic engagement in addition to individual achievement. The fact that the church was the locus for community and personal advancement was what made it such a powerful force for hope and survival. Leaders like the late Dr. Samuel DeWitt Proctor, the pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, emphasized religious and secular education as keys to economic progress for blacks. Proctor and others like him produced strong institutions, not just a few fabulously wealthy individuals.</p>
<p>In light of today&rsquo;s weak economy, perhaps the prosperity movement should consider focusing on financial literacy, personal discipline and saving for the long term, rather than emphasizing supernatural possibilities. Depending on miracles as a financial strategy is a dangerous way to live. Churches can be effective in teaching people how to convert from a culture of borrowing and spending to a culture of saving and investing. {snip}</p>

		<p>I was ordained by one of the more prominent &#8220;New Thought&#8221; groups (metaphysical), and prosperity has been taught in our denomination for 100 years and more.  The black prosperity churches have just figured it out, I suppose.  But they should know that the main metaphysical groups who were teaching Divine Law prosperity, namely Religious Science, Divine Science, Science of Mind, Unity - have all but disappeared from the planet.  Religious Science has metamorphosed into (X City) Center for Spiritual Living, both Divine Science and Science of Mind are gone, and Unity is fast going broke.  My guess is that the same thing will happen eventually to the black prosperity churches.  None of these folks ever figured out that focusing on prosperity is not exactly the divine intention for mankind; focusing on God alone through meditation IS   &mdash;   &#8220;Seek ye first the Kingdom of God, and all these things (i.e. prosperity) shall be added unto you.&#8221;  I&rsquo;m amazed that none of the black prosperity ministers bothered to look at the fate of their predecessors   &mdash;   maybe they figure they&rsquo;ll get rich enough and then get out of the biz before it&rsquo;s too late&hellip;.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Black&#8221; churches and most mainstream churches all spread a phoney gospel. Love everybody,(they never mention the hate part) turn the other cheek, God loves everybody, pray for your enemy, etc. etc.  It sure isn&rsquo;t the gospel of Christians many moons ago. The one verse charleys and the taken out of context phonies, not to mention the INTERPRETATIONS (done by who?) of the last 500 years leaves a lot to be desired. It almost makes one think that this was all an agenda to turn the White race into sheeple and fools. I am a Christian but most certainly not the kind of Christian we see on TV and hear on the radio or see in the pulpits and pews on Sundays.  </p>

<p><br>
Traditionally, that may have been so. But more recently black churches   &mdash;   like the one Obama went to for 20 years   &mdash;   have been emphasizing black entitlement, white guilt, &#8220;America&rsquo;s chickens have come home to roost&#8221;, &#8220;God damn America,&#8221; and other notions from the Radical Left. By contrast, this &#8220;prosperity gospel&#8221; sounds like an attempt to marry the black need for religion with the black desire for shiny objects (denoted in their culture with the wonderfully creative term &#8220;bling-bling&#8221;). </p>
<p>IOW just another ghetto hustle, albeit one with a Positive Social Message.  </p>
<p>But if that&rsquo;s the cynical interpretation of this Prosperity Gospel, the more charitable interpretation is that it&rsquo;s a black religion that&rsquo;s based more on capitalism/Americanism than communism/Alienism for a change. That alone makes it preferable to most current black churches, mosques, voodoo parlours, etc, with their relentlessly anti-Western bent. </p>
<p>Yes, I know Christianity traditionally teaches &#8220;humility and even poverty in this life so there may be riches in the next life,&#8221; but white churches also once taught believers how to handle money better (as part of living more responsible, less intoxicated lives). Done right, little lessons on home economics from someone who&rsquo;s been to school can be a worthy part of a church&rsquo;s &#8220;social uplift&#8221; mission. I know it was for my own Scots-Presbyterian forebears, for whom piety and miserliness went hand-in-hand. As poor white trash we learned to save, survive, and (eventually) thrive with the help of the only &#8220;financial advisors&#8221; we had access to: the village vicar. And for that, this Atheist is sincerely thankful to the Protestant branch of Christianity.  </p>
<p>So if Homey needs a taste of the long green to get him back on the churchy straight-n-narrow, I says &#8220;Hallelujah!&#8221; to da Prosperity Gospel!</p>

		<p>In continental Africa, the Christian church is associated with wealth, modernity, technology, celebrity, and having something in common with the &#8216;rich lifestyles&rsquo; of the white world.</p>
<p>Christian ecclesiastical fame is transferable into sexual and political currency, and access to charitable aid benevolence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise the prosperity gospel thrives in Africa.</p>

<p>You also have the preacher Rev. Wright in Chi who warned against whitey-way materialism but then &#8220;retires&#8221; to his $10 million 5,000 square foot house, or is it the $5 million 10,000 square foot house with option for indoor pool in an all-whitey gated golf course community.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that the people most likely to do well in the prosperity gospel movement are the people at the top suggests that it is all an ecclesiastical pyramid scheme&#8221;</p>
<p>I would have to think this observation is 100 % &#8220;right on the money&#8221;!</p>

		<p>Radical Rev yes metaphysical groups often promote the idea of thoughts creating your reality and being able to create prosperity but it is a bit different. Christian Prosperty Theologists teach if you GIVE THEM money God will return the favor by making you wealthy. Most metaphysical/new age groups that believe in prosperity principals don&rsquo;t demand that their followers give them large amounts of money in order to see a return. </p>
<p>While I have seen real creative manifestations in my own life age and wisdom (and rough times) have turned my metaphysical views much more towards the Buddhist teachings of acceptance.</p>

		<p>Adherants of the prosperity gospel seem to be very selective in their scripture reading. All of the disciples died cruel deaths. John the Baptist was beheaded after a short stint in prison. Paul was beaten with 39 lashes 5 times suffered ship wreck and oter maladies.He admonishes us to be content with food water and shelter.<br>
The old Christianity of Europe 500 years ago taught a man to do his daily labours as unto God. Education became important chiefly so one could read scripture&hellip;Funny thing..as people worked harder&hellip;studied harder..took risks like coming to the new World to worship as they pleased&hellip;.they got wealthier.<br>
This does not fit the mindset of Blacks (and a lot of Whites).<br>
We as a people do not understand how wealthy we are. Compare the average person in Ameica today to the average wealth of people anywhere at any time in history.</p>

		<p>Wearing flashy expensive watches, $1,000 dollar suits and driving expensive cars does not make one a &#8220;man of god&#8221;.<br>
Since I was a young boy I noticed the differance between my Catholic church&rsquo;s Clergy and the black church&rsquo;s preacher.</p>
