<h1><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/oct/15/mexican-assassins-headed-arizona/">Mexican Hit Men Stalk U.S.</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jerry Seper, Washington Times, October 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Drug-smuggling gangs in Mexico have sent well-armed assassins, or &#8220;sicarios,&#8221; into Arizona to locate and kill bandits who are ambushing and stealing loads of cocaine, marijuana and heroin headed to buyers in the U.S., the Department of Homeland Security has warned Arizona law enforcement authorities.</p>
<p>In a memo first sent in May but widely circulated since, the department said a group of &#8220;15, very well-equipped and armed&#8221; assassins complete with body armor had been sent into the state to identify, locate and kill the drug thieves, who are thought to be independent operators.</p>
<p>The memo said the assassins had been dispatched to the Vekol Valley, a well-established and widely travelled drug-smuggling corridor running north and south across Interstate 8 between the Arizona towns of Casa Grande and Gila Bend. The valley is a direct link to both the interstate and to Phoenix, giving drug smugglers the option of shipping their goods to California or to major cities both north and east.</p>
<p>Disguised as groups of backpackers but carrying empty boxes covered with burlap, the memo said the paid assassins would attempt to &#8220;draw out the bandits.&#8221; Once identified, it said, the assassins &#8220;will take out the bandits.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The federal government recently posted signs along Interstate 8 in the Vekol Valley warning travelers the area is unsafe because of drug and alien smugglers. The signs were posted by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) along a 60-mile stretch of Interstate 8 between Casa Grande and Gila Bend, warning travelers they are entering an &#8220;active drug- and human-smuggling area&#8221; and may encounter &#8220;armed criminals and smuggling vehicles traveling at high rates of speed.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The sheriff said he asked the Obama administration for 3,000 National Guard soldiers to patrol the border, but got 15 signs along Interstate 8 instead.<br>

		<p>THere are presently so many cartel controlled criminals in this country, along with sleeper cells of thousands of terrorists, and home-grown ones who have military bases here and mosques where imams preach anti-Wester hatred, a few thousand more hit men more or less won&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>They just add to the one million criminal street gangs comprised of black and mestizo thugs who are ready and willing to fight for their tribesmen.</p>
<p>YOu know, the &#8220;tribal&#8221; attitude his highness warned us about, preparing us for the coming riots by blacks.</p>

		<p>The military refers to such operations as pseudo-operations. Those assassins appear to be just ordinary drug smugglers but are drawing the &#8220;independents&#8221; out. Then the shoot-out occurs.</p>
<p>Sheriff Arpaio said it was a war out there. And guess what - - it is!!</p>

		<p>Politicians are getting rich from the sales of drugs, that is why nothing is being done by this corrupt government.</p>

		<p>If the Federal Coppers know this much about the Latino assassins, why do they pass the problem off to the state officials who have had their hands tied by that same federal government?  </p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t this the kind of thing our military snipers train for? Since this is all happening on our territory, what better way to get real, live-fire training experience for our SEALS, Delta Force, Special Ops, Green Berets and Rangers than to take out these assassins along with the drug couriers? Are these third-world drug cartels really better than our best? I&rsquo;m hoping some entrpreneurial Whites offer low-profile sniper safari trips to the desert southwest to hunt &#8220;the most dangerous game.&#8221; Sign me up&hellip;.</p>

		<p>And if one of these assassins was on my property, armed and threatening my family, and I dispatched him I would be brought up on hate crime charges.  Failing that I would be charged on the Housing Freedom Act violating his right to live where he chooses, a civil rights charge (even though an illegal has no civil rights)a charge that apparently carries a life sentence for me.  </p>
<p>This is truely becoming demented.</p>

		<p>Deputize the Minutemen, who are already there on the border, and have them respond with a rifle and ammunition. Have them arrest any Illegal border crossers, who are running drugs, or if it comes to a fire-fight, take the Illegals, and Drug Smugglers out.  </p>
<p>Many of these Minutemen are former U.S. Military Servicemen and women, who are willing to once again, step up, and serve their Country.</p>

		<p>Can anyone imagine this happening in the 1950s? I didn&rsquo;t think so. Well, Eisenhower might indeed have responded by posting highway signs&hellip; in English, throughout much of Mexico. </p>

		<p>When Pancho Villa made incursions into the United States the military was sent into Mexico without hesitation.A potentially even more murderous infiltration is growing in frequency every week,yet the liklihood of a justifiable martial response is probably less than zero.Times change </p>
