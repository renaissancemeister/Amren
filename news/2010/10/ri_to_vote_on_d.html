			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Eric Tucker, WTOP-FM (Washington, D.C.), October 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>This state&rsquo;s official name  &mdash;  The State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations  &mdash;  is more than just a mouthful. To many, it evokes stinging reminders of Rhode Island&rsquo;s prime role in the trans-Atlantic slave trade.</p>
<p>Voters next Tuesday will decide whether to change the name by dropping the words &#8220;and Providence Plantations.&#8221; The issue has been debated for years, but lawmakers last year authorized a ballot question for the first time following an impassioned debate over race relations, ancestry and history.</p>
<p>&#8220;You go anywhere and you mention plantations and what automatically comes to a person&rsquo;s mind is slavery,&#8221; said Nick Figueroa, 41, a member of a legislative minority advisory coalition that backs changing the name.</p>
<p>Supporters of the referendum see the ballot question as a chance to erase the state&rsquo;s links to slavery and remove a word they associate with human bondage and suffering. But opponents, including Gov. Don Carcieri, note that the state name actually has nothing to do with slavery and that, in any case, changing it will do nothing to alter history.</p>
<p>Michael Vorenberg, a Brown University history professor, said he understands the contemporary connotation of the word &#8220;plantations&#8221; but favors keeping the name because it provokes questions.</p>
<p>&#8220;People might naturally say, &#8216;What does that word mean and why is it in the state name?&rsquo; And that may lead to a discussion of the role of slavery in the history of Rhode Island, in the history of New England,&#8221; Vorenberg said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The phrase &#8220;Providence Plantations&#8221; appeared in the royal charter granted in 1663 by King Charles II to the colony of Rhode Island. At the time, &#8220;Plantation&#8221; was a general term for settlement or colony. In this case, it referred to the merger of the Providence settlement, which was founded by minister Roger Williams following his banishment from the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and nearby towns into a single colony.</p>
<p>Keith Stokes, who is multiracial and can trace his family&rsquo;s arrival to Newport back centuries, said the debate over the state name ignores Rhode Island&rsquo;s legacy as a colony founded on religious tolerance, where Jews, Quakers and other minorities settled in large numbers after being rejected elsewhere. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Proponents of the name change say they recognize the word &#8220;plantations&#8221; was not initially associated with slavery, but argue the original meaning is irrelevant  &mdash;  especially because 18th century Rhode Island emerged at the forefront of a thriving industry in which local merchants got rich off the exchange of slaves, rum, sugar and molasses among New England, the Caribbean and West Africa.</p>
<p>They say &#8220;plantations&#8221; is inextricably linked to slavery, just as the swastika  &mdash;  traditionally a harmonious symbol in Hinduism and Buddhism  &mdash;  has since been adopted as an emblem of Nazi Germany and is today associated with ethnic hatred.</p>
<p>The name change had previously been debated by the General Assembly but wasn&rsquo;t approved for a referendum until last year, when a group of primarily African-American lawmakers made a strong push and spoke of racial divisions and the lingering negative connotations of the word &#8220;plantations.&#8221; Even some legislators who said they were personally ambivalent agreed to put the issue to the voters after seeing how strongly their colleagues felt.</p>

<p>I will wait with bated breath to learn of soaring black test scores and graduation rates as well as a steep decline in black teen pregnancies and incarceration rates since the horror of the plantation will be eradicated from the little known or used official name of the State of Rhode Island.</p>

		<p>Good to see that black &#8220;leaders&#8221; have their priorities in order.</p>
<p>one would think black folk would like to remember a time when they actually worked</p>

		<p>Plantation really means &#8220;settlement.&#8221;  Before they immigrated here due to high rents imposed on them The British Crown had established the relatively empty regions of Northern Ireland for Border Scots and other &#8220;extra people&#8221; that they wanted to get a bit more at arms length, and the Ulster Plantation was established.  The owners rented land to the settlers, but when they raised the rent too high, the independent spirited Scotch/Irsih (yes, they used &#8220;Scotch&#8221;) crossed the Atlantic and set up housekeeping in the Appalachians, providing America with a rich cultural heritage that has influenced politics, music and was almost soley responsible for the success of the War of Independence because the majority of the Continental Army came from they population, because they had been at odds with The Crown since medeival times.  But Plantation means &#8220;settlement.&#8221;  If whites knew their own history and language better they could quickly shoot down all these power plays by blacks who really want to attempt to bully whites around at every opportunity.</p>

		<p>In the early 17th century weren&rsquo;t white slaves almost half of the arrivals? I would assume most of them were on plantations.</p>

		<p>Just like the non sense about how the phrase &#8220;black holes&#8221; is  racist, this is much ado about nothing. The smallest state in the union has the longest name, &#8220;The State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations&#8221;.Hopefully these hyper sensitive zealots will not succeed in chaninging this.  </p>

		<p>Apparently only blacks are allowed to remind us of slavery and any associated words and phrases.  And, goodness knows, they do it often enough.</p>

		<p>Good lord! That might imply that America had slavery at one point! =0<br>
Disgusting.<br>
While they are at it, let us destroy any relic of history that might be unfair, I get dibs on tearing down the Coliseum! Our history is being erased to be less offensive, and our descendents will pay the price when they walk about with no history. We will have about as much history as African Americans do. <br>

<p>What would be a less offensive scientific term for them, African American holes? Afro Holes? They will not be really happy until whites are not allowed to speak at all in their presence, which is soon forthcoming if present trends continue.</p>

		<p>I would hope that when people are having &#8216;stinging&rsquo; sensations from the &#8216;reminders&rsquo; of slavery inherent in the term &#8216;plantations&rsquo;, that they realize precisely what group of Rhode Islanders were ringleaders in the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade.  </p>
<p>&#8216;White People&rsquo; in general, are blamed for Slavery in America (despite the fact that Slavery, at the time, was a practice everywhere in the World, but in Scandinavia&hellip;the whitest place of all), when only a small and socially-marginalized subset of whites were particularly guilty of promoting the practice on these shores.  I happen to be a descendant of that group, and of members of that group who built an early and exceptionally fine house of worship in Rhode Island.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you a hint: Spanish Surnames were common among them.</p>
<p>WASPs, by contrast, are notable in regards to Slavery, only in that they eventually outlawed the practice, and caused it to be outlawed worldwide.</p>
<p>As a mentor frequently told me: &#8220;No one is guilty by blood.&#8221; Wasps, however, are especially&hellip;uniquely&hellip;NOT GUILTY.  In fact, they are the opposite of &#8216;guilty&rsquo;. </p>
