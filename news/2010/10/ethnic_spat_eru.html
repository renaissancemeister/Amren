<h1>Ethnic Spat Erupts in Changing OC District</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amy Taxin, San Francisco Chronicle, October 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The changing face of one of Southern California&rsquo;s wealthiest counties helped Democrat Loretta Sanchez win an upset election to Congress 14 years ago, as Latinos arrived as a political force. Now, a rising tide of Vietnamese political clout has her fighting to hang onto her seat.</p>
<p>To the surprise of many voters in California&rsquo;s gritty, urban 47th District  &mdash;  which shares little with the affluent beachfront communities that give Orange County its fame  &mdash;  Sanchez recently injected the thorny issue of race into the campaign. Speaking on Spanish-language network Univision, she said &#8220;the Vietnamese and Republicans&#8221; were trying &#8220;to take this seat from us .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and give it to this Van Tran who is very anti-immigrant and very anti-Hispanic&#8221;  &mdash;  words she later conceded were poorly chosen.</p>
<p>Vietnamese-American state Assemblyman Van Tran, Sanchez&rsquo;s first serious challenger, said he was offended by the remarks and called them a &#8220;racial rampage&#8221; against Vietnamese-Americans, who came to Southern California as refugees 35 years ago and built a bustling commercial hub in the heart of Orange County.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&rsquo;re seeing two emerging communities .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. seeing themselves not as potential allies in these kinds of head-to-head races but as foes in a zero sum game and that becomes dangerous,&#8221; said James Lai, a political science professor at Santa Clara University.</p>
<p>There is no other district with candidates hailing from two sizable ethnic communities in such a potentially close race, according to Democrat and Republican Congressional Campaign committees. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The district  &mdash;  which includes Santa Ana, Garden Grove, Anaheim and Fullerton  &mdash;  is no stranger to ethnic controversy. In 1996, Sanchez&rsquo;s conservative predecessor Bob Dornan, known as &#8220;B-1 Bob&#8221; for his support of military programs and his bombastic personality, claimed many who cast a ballot for his opponent were ineligible to vote. A decade later, the Republican candidate for Sanchez&rsquo;s seat, Tan Nguyen, sent a Spanish-language mailer to Latino Democrats warning them immigrants could not vote.</p>
<p>Political experts said Sanchez&rsquo;s recent remarks may have been a calculated risk to drive Latinos to the polls in November.</p>
<p>While the majority of the district is Hispanic and Democrat, Latinos have a lower turnout rate than Vietnamese-Americans and Democratic candidates will likely be hurt this year by the anti-incumbent sentiment sweeping a nation wracked by the recession.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The big question is whether Vietnamese-Americans who have long cast a ballot for Sanchez  &mdash;  even though many are Republicans  &mdash;  will continue to support her or vote along ethnic lines.</p>
<p>Sanchez has championed key issues for the Vietnamese community, such as denouncing Vietnam&rsquo;s record of religious persecution. But political scientists say voters tend to pick candidates from their own ethnic background.</p>
<p>Tran was the first Vietnamese-American elected to a state Legislature in 2004 and is a beloved leader in the community. He has helped groom dozens of Vietnamese-Americans to run for local offices in Orange County.</p>
<p>Puffing on a Marlboro outside his Vietnamese restaurant in Santa Ana, Duke Nguyen said he supports Tran because he&rsquo;s Republican, and also because he&rsquo;s Vietnamese and can speak for the community.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are proud to have another Vietnamese in Congress,&#8221; the 54-year old said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tan Nguyen, a 38-year old real estate agent from Garden Grove, said he has backed Sanchez even though he&rsquo;s a Republican because she stands up to the communist government in Vietnam on human rights. And he isn&rsquo;t wavering this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t have to vote for Vietnamese,&#8221; said Nguyen, no relation to the previous congressional candidate. &#8220;We vote for the one who works for us, who helps us, who fights for us.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Well, the good thing here is that if whites actually see that other ethnies play the same protectionist game and &#8216;political scientists say it&rsquo;s natural to vote for their own ethnic background over any other issue&rsquo; then perhaps we can also afford a big belly laugh when next we are accused of &#8216;racism&rsquo; for supporting our own interests.</p>
<p>The sad part however is the presumption that it matters for the OC itself.  Because Hispanics jumping Asians only means that there are now two lions fighting over the corpse of the great white beast and that much more of white economic and social power is collapsing on the basis of thinking these groups will EVER &#8216;work together&rsquo; as opposed to simply &#8216;going native in a new country&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Until Tribalism breaks down the nation state into a bunch of islanded minicultures, each one bowling alone.</p>
<p>Of the entire planet, only whites have developed the profound and culturally unique ability to use objective conceptualism to see a topic as separate from themselves.  And thus worthy of evaluating independent of their own interests.</p>
<p>While we were ethnically homogenous, this rational logic made us powerful and our power trickled down to other nations and cultures where the benefits belonged, in their homelands.</p>
<p>Now that we are ethnically heterogenous with absolutely no breed-across-think-across interest in a &#8216;melting pot propositional society&rsquo;, we cannot even summon the clinical detachment to &#8216;assess objectively&rsquo; our own position within our formerly owned culture.</p>
<p>Because we assume that when another group calls us racist for doing what they are doing, they are actually offended, rather than simply gaming-psychology manipulating our fear of being feared.</p>

<p> - This is why too much diversity is DANGEROUS.  Nations have split apart along ethnic lines for just this sort of thing.  It happens like every year somewhere in the world.  NYC has tons of racial fiefdoms now.</p>
<p>&#8220;political scientists say voters tend to pick candidates from their own ethnic background.&#8221;</p>
<p>- Wait a minute!  Isn&rsquo;t this the opposite of inclusion, social justice, race neutral policies and all the rest?  If people just vote for candidates based on race and not &#8220;the content of their character&#8221; then diversity-liberalism is an utter and complete failure.  We will pay a heavy price in the future.</p>
<p>After the United States disunites into several warring racially based states, what nation in the world would you trust to build a stable world order?  Zimbabwe?  China?  Brazil?  Etc&hellip;.</p>

<p>NO, not poorly chosen. Chosen exactly for a reason, that is her true sentiments and used specifically to address her group, her base, the hispanic voter.</p>

		<p>East Asians are here to take advantage of white people and what white people created.  They want &#8220;their&#8221; piece just as much as any other non-white.  Yet we continue to hear from white people that East Asians share our interests let alone care about us.  No, they don&rsquo;t.  Eskimos in Greenland used to pretend to be starving to get free food from Europeans there.  Eventually food sources became scarce and most Europeans left.  This pattern of non-white people wanting to take advantage of white people is very old and white people should know better.  The kind of society white people want can not happen with non-whtie people because they are there for their own self interest.</p>

		<p>Why are these &#8220;refugees&#8221; still here? We gave them temporary shelter, which they don&rsquo;t need anymore. It&rsquo;s time for them to go home. They don&rsquo;t even have to thank us; just leaving is thanks enough.</p>

During the end of the Vietnam war thousands of Vietnamese came to America by air or ship.<br>
Soldiers in Vietnam described the Vietnamese as a clannish and war-like people predisposed to petty infighting.<br>
After their illegal entry, the Vietnamese were slow and unwilling to assimilate.<br>
Today&rsquo;s Vietnamese share less in common with the values and ideals of white American&rsquo;s and closer relationships with other Asian groups who are defining themselves against<br>
the American people as America becomes less unified.<br>
Vietnamese are not only less willing to fully assimilate, but willing to form communities similar to other illegal aliens such as the Mexicans.<br>
So here we are stymied as we observe this bizarre spectacle between Vietnamese and Mexicans as they take office in Orange county California.<br>
If there is one thing we as American&rsquo;s owe our beloved country it is to educate and remind immigrant groups what America stands for. <br>
Have copies of&rsquo;An Overview of America&rsquo; by the John Burch Society played over your local television station.<br>
America will more than likely end up deporting illegal immigrants enmasse as we learn from this difficult error.</p>

		<p>Reminds me of that scene on Gran Torino where there was almost a shootout between some Hispanic gang and these Hmong gang.  The Hispanics were saying something like &#8220;leave our country.&#8221;  Was ironic, because Hispanics whine it&rsquo;s racist when others say that to them and, to be honest, I&rsquo;d prefer the Asians over Hispanics and certainly over blacks.  At least they don&rsquo;t hate whites or blame us for all their problems.</p>

		<p>I live in OC and from my personal experiences with the Vietnamese people, I consider them to be well-educated, politically conservative, and industrious. Mexicans are the opposite. I&rsquo;m white, but if I lived in that district, I would vote for the Asian.</p>

		<p>Now, I like Vietnamese even less than Hispanics (I&rsquo;m being brutally honest). But my dad, who could only find custodial jobs when he and my mom came out to So Cal. in the 1970&rsquo;s, watched his town turn SE Asian while he was working on the job in the local High School. </p>
<p>Not only did his duties increase (trash everywhere, incidents of entire rolls of TP causing toilets -full of excrement- to overflow, etc.) but he and the other WHITE members of the Custodial team, had to suffer under the increasing Vietnamese/Hmong ESL &#8216;teachers&rsquo;  utter condescension, and the diversicrats pandering to the non-Anglos in the school, before he retired.</p>
<p>When I was talking with him some years after he retired (and before he moved out of the area) I said to him, &#8220;How did these folks do with learning English as a Second Language?&rsquo; His response (without a heartbeat) was, &#8216;You know the first words they all learn, are?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8216;I sue, I sue.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As he is now dead, and was not a man to either lie, or mince words, I believe him. What a sorry state to see &#8216;Garbage Grove&rsquo; as we used to call it, sink even lower in the state of &#8220;Californication.&#8221;</p>
