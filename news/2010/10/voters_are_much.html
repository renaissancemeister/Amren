			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rasmussen Reports, October 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Perceptions about the state of black-white relations in America have fallen dramatically since the summer of 2009. But voters are still more optimistic about that relationship than they are about relations between whites and Hispanics and between blacks and Hispanics.</p>
<p>A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that just 36% of voters now say relations between blacks and whites are getting better. That&rsquo;s down from 62% in July of last year at the height of the controversy involving a black Harvard professor and a white policeman.  That number had fallen only slightly to 55% in April of this year.</p>
<p>Twenty-seven percent (27%) now say black-white relations are getting worse, up 10 points from July 2009, while 33% think they&rsquo;re staying about the same. {snip}</p>
<p>African-Americans are much more pessimistic than whites. Thirty-nine percent (39%) of whites think black-white race relations are getting better, but just 13% of blacks agree.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Only 21% of all voters now think race relations between whites and Hispanics are improving, down seven points from April and down 19 points from last December.  Fifty percent (50%) say they are getting worse, and 24% say they&rsquo;re remaining about the same.</p>
<p>Similarly, just 16% say race relations between blacks and Hispanics are getting better. Thirty-four percent (34%) say they are worsening and 24% staying the same. However, 26% are undecided. These findings are basically unchanged from December.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Interestingly, 59% of African-American voters continue to believe the country is moving in the right direction, a view shared by just 27% of whites.</p>
<p>Confidence in relations with Hispanics has undoubtedly been soured by the growing national concern with illegal immigration, which many view largely as a problem coming from Mexico. Support is high nationally for Arizona&rsquo;s new law cracking down on illegal immigration, a statute that has drawn loud protest from the Mexican government.</p>
<p>Most Americans don&rsquo;t believe Mexico wants to stop the illegal flow of its citizens into this country and think America&rsquo;s southern neighbor should be asked to compensate U.S. taxpayers for costs incurred by illegal immigration.</p>

		<p>This is what makes me laugh at people who claim minorities will unite against Euro-Americans. If anything, Euro-Americans and African-Americans would unite against Hispanics. The average African-American has more in common culturally with a Euro-American than he or she does with the average Hispanic or Asian American. Figures, we have been around each other for the past several centuries, while our exposure to Hispanics is recent. <br>
A lot of the racial optimism was due to the election of Obama and the assumption that race was no longer an issue but now, as things get worse, our social relations are doing the same. <br>

<p>This is exactly what I thought when I saw the headline, and before even reading the article. I live in upstate New York, where most &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; (still not sure exactly what they are, but assume) are Puerto Rican, and generally get along with white people. The alien flood coming from Mexico, the political cowardice and virtual treason of many of our politicians (including GW Bush), the criminal and anti-American antics and overt racism of the Mexican illegals has affected relationships and the way most whites view &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; in general. The problem comes from the other side also: even thought they are not the same racially, most Puerto Ricans, notably through the Puerto Rican Defense Fund, among other organizations, and the NYC P.R. politicians, all are openly in favor of increased (illegal) immigration, and amnesty.  It seems ethnicity, language and being of non-white race trumps patriotism.</p>

		<p>I think Mexico should compensate the U.S. taxpayer, but I won&rsquo;t hold my breath. Like our elitest ruling class would ever ask. And since this country&rsquo;s 9th Circuit Court of Appeals is going to also allow the other ten latin countries to file briefs challenging Arizona&rsquo;s SB 1070 law, they should be made to pay for that privilege.</p>
<p>Does the Rasmussen Reports show that maybe, just maybe, white America is waking up to all the abuses being heaped on our country, from inside and out? It will take the courage of our convictions to try and turn this increasingly crazy tide steam rolling over us. I only hope it&rsquo;s not too late.</p>

I want to like blacks.  Unfortunately, after being the victim of several violent black criminals, I am more wary than when I was younger. </p>

		<p>I wonder how much the movie, Machete, did to reduce &#8220;race relations&#8221; between the Hispanic and white groups. It certainly did in my case.</p>
<p>White men may worry about race relationships as something valuable per se. Other groups are concerned  with their own welfare, and relations with other groups matter only in so far as they affect their group.</p>

		<p>For me personally, the experience is fairly evenly split;  My home was burglarized twice by Hispanics (I am 99% certain), my office (self-employed) burglarized and ransacked by a Mexican gang (100% certain), my continued work in my field has been encumbered and limited by the treatment I received from fellow Hispanic employees, and white women).  Blacks have threatened my life on two occasions, yelled racial epithets more times than I can imagine, invaded my family through marriage to my niece (soon divorced after infidelity was discovered), while a cousin&rsquo;s daughter was first raped by two Mexicans, then later impregnated - willingly, by a black man who soon disappeared from her life.  The crimes committed by illegal (no doubt) gang members had the long term effect of financial limitation, due to my inability to raise enough money to go back into business, while the arrogance of the white women I have worked with (I was a relief doctor) eventually led to my withdrawal from the field and working altogether.  Luckily, I have a source of independently generated income through investments that while challenged, have averted my complete ruin so far.  But it is a great worry.  They want to raise the age of retirement, but discrimination against seniors is very difficult to prove.</p>
<p>Relations all around are terrible.  The television I see only adds to my contempt for the various forces that have combined to produce misrule in the post WW2 era.  That misrule was initiated by what has been called, The Greatest Generation.  That entire generation gets far too much credit for the bravery of a few men who stormed beaches and fought bloody engagements, while everyone else partied as hard as they worked, or even more.</p>

<p>I think you are wrong.  I feel safer around some Hispanics than I ever have around blacks, who are menacing with their presence, even with my listed history as I previously posted, if it gets approved.  I am content to see blacks and Hispanics engaged in warring.</p>
<p>For anyone who writes comments or essays;</p>
<p> I would like to suggest that the clunky, PC, phrase &#8220;his or her&#8221; be replaced with pronouns like &#8220;their, them, they, we, our, etc.  It is far less ugly, does not conjure up visions of feminazism, and also happens to be proper English usage. </p>

<p>What are we to make of this? 26% fewer blacks than whites think that black-white race relations are getting better, but 32% <i>more</i> blacks than whites believe the country is moving in the right direction??</p>
<p>How can the country be &#8220;moving in the right direction&#8221; if race relations are not getting better? </p>
<p>To understand this apparent contradiction, you have to understand how the black mind operates. </p>
<p>The country is moving in the right direction because of the election of Obama. Whites don&rsquo;t like Obama. So what? Tough luck for whitey! </p>
<p>Obviously, the country moving in the right direction has nothing to do with improved black-white race relations. It has to do with blacks getting their way <i>in spite of</i> what whites want! </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nothing but a power struggle between white and black. &#8220;We shall overcome&#8221;means not overcoming ones own problems, but getting the better of the white man! </p>
<p>Always has meant that, always will.</p>

<p>I beg your pardon? No! If anything, it&rsquo;s just the opposite from my point-of-view. I live and work with Hispanics and they have so much in common with Euro culture.

		<p>I agree totally with Whiteplight and Anon. poster #9 in that my experience too is just the opposite of what poster #1 claims. While a small minority of upper middle-class blacks may be more aligned with whites culturally, the vast majority remain far on the fringes. </p>

<p>What&rsquo;s all this jabber about  Asian-Americans,  African-Americans, Euro-Americans? </p>
<p>I have no argument with your logic, just with your language. </p>
<p>I grew up considering myself an American, and that&rsquo;s what I continue to be. I&rsquo;m an American, period!   &mdash;   just as George Washington was an American.  He didn&rsquo;t consider himself to be part of a certain sub-division of  various American ethnicities.  And neither do I. </p>
<p>We are the people who conceived this country, constructed it, and held it together.  We are the ones who invented, and built, and fought, and made it great.  Other races may have come along for the ride, in a minor role,  but they were on our horse. There was never any question about whose horse it was, or who was the rider.</p>
<p>Until recently, that is.</p>
<p>I refuse to be relegated to just another minority among minorities (the ultimate goal of those who rule the  Left, btw).   It has been their objective to create a nation of  rainbow minorities, none strong enough to wield the balance of power.   If you fall for their language consigning us to that minority status   &mdash;    just another ethnic group   &mdash;    then you have fallen for their ideology, realize it or not.</p>
<p>They want to turn us from the landlord of the property into just one of the tenants.  By accepting their terminology, you are accepting that status. </p>

<p>As others here have said, that&rsquo;s absurd. Africans and their descendents are more anomalous than typical of the rest of humanity. </p>
<p>How many times have you met someone from India or China and thought &#8220;Wow! Even though this person speaks broken English and comes from halfway around the world, I have more in common with him than the black guy across town who&rsquo;s ancestors came here 300 years ago?&#8221;</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t disagree with you there, I&rsquo;d take a typical Hispanic family next door any day over a typical black one. However, as far as culture goes, we do share more in common with African Americans and if became a thing of &ldquo;us vs. them&rdquo; African Americans would be far more likely to unite with us than they would Hispanics. That is, if we even want them. </p>
<p>As far as values go, I&rsquo;d say we share much more in common with Hispanics than we do blacks. </p>

		<p>White-Hispanic relations are better than White-Black relations and will remain so.  When the language barrier is removed, Whites and Hispanics find each other more desirable to associate with than either group does with Blacks.  Which is not to say further Hispanic immigration is desirable or even tolerable; but I would trade our Black minority in a heartbeat for more Hispanics.  </p>

		<p>Its a shame that relations between blacks and whites had to get so low.  If they hadn&rsquo;t pushed so hard for those silly &#8220;civil rights&#8221; and all that, then I think we would be getting along much better today.  I like a lot of black people, but it always irks me when they talk about &#8220;racist whites&#8221; and &#8220;civil rights&#8221; and how the white man stole from them and all that garbage.  Their own high ambitions are what strain our mutual relations most, in my humble opinion.</p>

		<p>My feeling is that on a personal level, black/white relations have never been better. Politically though, liberals are playing their favorite and most effective game- ginning up resentment amongst blacks and minorities to secure votes ahead of the latest election.</p>

		<p>I can take or leave Hispanics. Overall, we may getting a skewed picture of Hispanics in the US because of the many criminals and undesirables who slime across the border to reap mayhem. That being said, illegal Hispanics remain an acute destructive threat and will remain so until immigration is slammed shut and deportation (true deportation) is ramped up. On the whole, I do not see Hispanics as harboring the same rabid animosity against whites as blacks, who are a breed apart. </p>
<p>In my mind, surveys involving blacks are pointless - they&rsquo;ll say whatever sounds good or seems reasonable the day they are asked. However, they have no long term goal, unlike Hispanics, many of whom just want a better life and are wiling to work at it. Blacks just want an easy life in a society where they cannot function. Their failure as a people only fosters hatred of superior whites - an odd mindset since they are wholly dependent on the generosity of whites for their very existence.</p>
<p>Since blacks seem perpetually confused asking about white-black relations is ridiculous. Furthermore, the out-of-control black-on-black crime should lead first to the question of black-black relations. Common sense dictates that if they treat their own kind with such primitive, uncaring behavior why even bother asking what they think about non-blacks.</p>
<p>Lastly, the only true measure of a black survey would be linked to handouts and government giveaways. With the money disappearing and the debt exploding it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before whites close the wallet. Then relations will be classified as poor. The only way blacks can even relate to whites is in how much money, food stamps, and free services they receive.</p>

		<p>Hello Amren faithful,<br>
       A while back I replied to a news item here on on the 9th of June 2010  labelled   &#8220;Black Leaders Leaving DISD Along With Students&#8221; My comment was posted in the comments section. It was thus </p>
<p><br>
     &#8220;As someone who was raised in the inner city of Chicago I have experienced going to school in both Mexican, as well as black majority schools. When I attended the nearly all black school I was not even given the courtesy of being called by my birth name. My name basically became &ldquo;White Mother _ _ _ _ _ _&rdquo;. That is how they normally referred to me, and that is how I was addressed. I then transferred to a school that was mostly Mexican.(while having a handful of whites and blacks) To be fair, the Mexicans treated me quite well (in comparison to how the blacks treated me) for the most part. My name became James again. I played on the football team where I started at runningback for the Varsity team my junior and senior year. I ran track and would end up going down state in the 200 meter dash where I finished 7th in the State. I even took a rather attractive Panamanian girl to the senior prom. (No, I am not advocating mixing, my Australian wife is half Serbian and Half Greek)I say all this only to illustrate that while outnumbered by Mexicans, I atleast had some level of participation and was not despised for the color of my skin. When I went to the black school, I was lower than a dog in their eyes and their to be mistreated. I was fortunate in the sense that God has given me a strong body so actual physical abuse against me was a rarity (although I was jumped twice in the two years I went to that hell hole and bear the facial scars even today) Anyway, I know I went a bit off of the topic, however I read Amren almost daily and believe in their position on racial realism. The races are different. Very different. And those differences show themsleves every single day. Those who deny this are either ignorant,or lying.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was my post from a few months ago. Now, to add to that, I disagree 100% with anyone who says that Black Americans have more in common with European Americans than do Mexicans. In fact I would venture to say that Black Africans have little in common with ANY of the other races of man that I have been exposed to. The savagery I witnessed on a daily basis while attending that nearly all black school has no equal in violence, depravation, or cruelty. There are no words strong enough in the English language that can effectively describe the blind pathological like hatred the blacks had for me. I believe European/Americans(even  many racially conscious European/Americans) do not fully grasp the level of hatred that a large large number of African Americans have for them. This hatred runs deep, in many Blacks I truly believe it is part of their very being. Strong words I know. However, be at the mercy of the African in his world and I could almost guarantee that most people would come to the same conclusion. Now, I fully understand that there are differences between Europeans/Americans and Mexicans. As I stated in my previous post I believe ALL the races of man have atleast some genetic differences that manifest in behaviour and ability and such. But the vast majority of Mexicans(I would say mabye as high as 95% or higher) just did not have that seething psychotic hatred for me that was all too common with the blacks. Sure their were individual Mexicans that would throw racial slurs at me from time to time if  had a argument with one. But the virulent hate just was not present. Also, Black African achievement (whether measured current or historical) is FAR FAR below that of any other race of people (Except for mabye the Australian Aboriginals). In closing, I will say that all the races of man are different. That I believe to be a biological fact. However the African race is at one extreme end of the spectrum of humanity while the European race is at the other end. </p>

		<p>&#8220;A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that just 36% of voters now say relations between blacks and whites are getting better. That&rsquo;s down from 62% in July of last year at the height of the controversy involving a black Harvard professor and a white policeman. That number had fallen only slightly to 55% in April of this year.&#8221;</p>
<p>What have this 36% been smoking or injecting? Whites are being attacked and murdered by Blacks at an ever increasing rate. And to imagine that Whites and Blacks will make common cause against Hispanics is totally absurd. We have NOTHING in common with Blacks! The next time that one of you 36% percent is  being beaten, stomped, raped and stabbed by a group of Blacks please don&rsquo;t forget to remind them of how much you have in common with them.   They will most assuredly cease the assault and beg your forgiveness  for the misunderstanding. I wonder if poor misguided Eve Carson tried to reason with the two pongids who abducted her. They shot her in the face with a shotgun because she was beautiful and they were ugly. DId anyone notice how quickly that case disappeared from the radar screen? </p>
<p>Hispanic isn&rsquo;t a race. There are many Hispanics who hold the same views and values that we do and many of them are also of European origin, Argentina, Uruguay, Chile have predominantly Euro populations. Even Colonbia has a large White population. Unfortunately we&rsquo;re dealing with the lowest common denominator of Hispanics and it isn&rsquo;t realistic to catagorize all of them.</p>
<p>The main tie we have with Blacks is that we are the host upon which they feed and I mean that literally as well as figuratively. Of course the exception is the White women who actively seek out Black men. For the most part they learn a tragic lesson down the road. We have as much in common with them as the Jews had with the Nazis.</p>

<p>Ive told people for the past 15 years that blacks couldnt care less about becoming an American (hence the affffrican-American nickname they have given themselves) but choose to dominate Whites. They want to kill us off. Even the mild-mannered little black lady&hellip;.she too wants this land for her people.</p>
<p>Whites do not understand this concept because they themselves couldnt possibly believe like that, so, they feel that blacks cannot possibly feel that way.</p>
<p>But theyre wrong&hellip;.and one day, as they ignore, they will be faced with the reality they are so adamant about refusing to take notice.</p>
<p>I have no sympathy for them. They slobber at the first sight of a black that its sickening. These are the same Whites that would jump over 10 of their own dying Brothers or Sisters just to get to a black with a splinter in their finger.</p>

		<p>I beg your pardon? No! If anything, it&rsquo;s just the opposite from my point-of-view. I live and work with Hispanics and they have so much in common with Euro culture. They are a partiarchal culture, value faith, value hard work, treat women respectfully, share in the same holidays and festivals we do. Hispanics look up to whites as a model society, blacks resent us. </p>
<p>Poster #9, I beg to differ. Everything you listed that hispanics possess is absurd!  Neither blacks nor hispanics have anything in common with White people. I don&rsquo;t know which hispanics you claim to know, but they are none of the above. Sure there are INDIVIDUAL hispanics or blacks that may be what you claim, but as a whole they are all anti-White. </p>
<p>I suggest you watch a program called Gangland on Spike TV (cable) and then try to tell us that hispanics are any better than blacks are for our race. I watched an episode last night about the Los Zeta gangs in Mexico and the USA and they are spreading across America. See all their brutal savagery, torture they relish in and see all the weapons they have at their disposal. They recruit 13 year olds and have no problem getting them. Our police force is no match for these terroists and they admit it. They (the police) are outnumbered and outgunned according to the police themselves.</p>
<p>The same with the MS-13 and all their off-shoots. The mexican gangs in my city are just as bad. </p>

		<p>Many blacks and silly white liberals apparently thought that Obama&rsquo;s election would make racial relations hunky-dory.  Instead, blacks have generally become even more frustrated because white attitudes have not magically changed.  Moreover, Obama&rsquo;s racist words and actions have alienated many whites and helped strengthen the Tea Party, which many blacks view as the revival of Jim Crow.  </p>

		<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This is what makes me laugh at people who claim minorities will unite against Euro-Americans. If anything, Euro-Americans and African-Americans would unite against Hispanics. The average African-American has more in common culturally with a Euro-American than he or she does with the average Hispanic or Asian American. Figures, we have been around each other for the past several centuries, while our exposure to Hispanics is recent. <br>
A lot of the racial optimism was due to the election of Obama and the assumption that race was no longer an issue but now, as things get worse, our social relations are doing the same. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Uh, I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re smoking, but you&rsquo;re wrong.  Blacks try to side other non-whites against whites, there is a high amount of black on white violence, blacks-hispanic clashes have been raising everywhere, and I have been treated nicer being around large numbers of hispanics than I have large numbers of blacks.  Hispanics have better work and family ethics than do most blacks.  Hispanics have more white in them than blacks do.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tired of whites trying to kiss up to blacks and trying to always make them feel better when they hate us and are flat out making that apparent everyday</p>

		<p>The post by ghw states that he doesn&rsquo;t like the idea of hyphenated Americans, since this supposedly downplays the fact that those of European background founded this country and are responsible for the predominant culture.</p>
<p>I disagree, particularly since the youngest generation of those in the United States of European background is already minority status, and in the following decades this reality will catch up with the illusion that we are still a majority in the country we conquered and developed. At some point the term &#8220;European-American&#8221; is going to have to become the politically correct one in order for us to fight our way up from the lowly status we are now consigned to by today&rsquo;s culture masters.</p>
<p>A further point I want to make is that having lived in Buenos Aires, Argentina for many years, I can say that the term Hispanic definitely applies to a variety of racial backgrounds, including those of pure European origin. What has happened in the U.S. is that the lower class immigrants from Mexico and the rest of Latin America, that has become become a flood over the past few decades, are mostly heavily American Indian within a Mestizo background, or heavily black within a mulatto background. In these cases, the common meeting ground that Latin American culture provides becomes more problematic given the realities of the racial struggle developing rapidly in the United States and in which no group will be able to remain on the sidelines, as has been the case with the European-Americans so far.</p>

A while back I replied to a news item here on on the 9th of June 2010 labelled &ldquo;Black Leaders Leaving DISD Along With Students&rdquo; My comment was posted in the comments section. It was thus</p>
<p><br>
&ldquo;As someone who was raised in the inner city of Chicago I have experienced going to school in both Mexican, as well as black majority schools. When I attended the nearly all black school I was not even given the courtesy of being called by my birth name. My name basically became &ldquo;White Mother _ _ _ _ _ _&rdquo;.

 <br>
When blacks are in the minority most try to behave.  When they are in the majority, they behave the way they want to behave.  <br>
 <br>
White liberals rarely come in contact with many blacks.  The few they do come in contact with are usually exceptional, or they occupy subordinate roles that they accept without resentment.   <br>
 <br>
At some level of consciousness, James From Australia, many white liberals know that what you say is true.  Nevertheless, they try not to think about it, and they try to keep others from talking about it.  Then they claim to be in favor of free expression.  <br>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>I see that many posters above have addressed this issue, with much disagreement among them.</p>
<p>I think the problems centers on the word &#8220;Hispanic&#8221;. Just what is meant by a &#8220;Hispanic&#8221;?  Different parts of the country understand the word differently. In the West, Hispanics are mostly Mexicans. In the East, they are usually from the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Hispanics come in all races and colors. It&rsquo;s a cultural designation.   Racially, they can be divided into three groups:  white, mulatto, and mestizo. I personally find that I have never had any problem with white Hispanics. They are kindred spirits, friendly to us, with similar views and values. The non-white Hispanics, however, can be another story.  And the darker they are, the worse, generally speaking. So it depends on which of the three groups you mean.</p>

<p><br>
Actually&hellip;.you are both right.  The missing piece of information both of you don&rsquo;t know is that there is no such thing as a &#8220;hispanic&#8221;. The people lumped together under that term all speak spanish but so what.  Blacks and whites in the US both speak English (sort of&hellip;.hehehe).  But would lump them together as a racial group?  No&hellip;.that&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>In the same way, &#8220;hispanics&#8221; are not a racial group by any means.  There are white hispanics (usually you cannot tell a white hispanic from any other white person unless they happen to be speaking Spanish&hellip;&hellip;and many of us do not speak spanish).  And there are black &#8220;hispanics&#8221;.  They look like blacks and act like blacks, dress like africans, often, except they speak spanish.  Maybe they tend to be a more racially mixed black/white than other types of blacks, due to the slave trade in Brazil (which enslaved many white people as well as black).</p>
<p>Then there is a third racial group lumped in with &#8220;hispanic&#8221;.  The La Raza crowd&hellip;&hellip;who are mostly indian (feather not dot) in background.</p>
<p>These three racial groups HATE each other.  They behave vastly different from each other.  As a matter of fact, the immigration issue in the US, in a very real way, is the result of ethnic cleansing going on, south of our border.  Currently, Mexico is engaged in a racial civil war.  The racial aspect is covered up as &#8220;drug lords&#8221; (who are all, conveniently, of non-white racial stock) against the government (run by whites).</p>
<p>Things to think about.  What does La Raza REALLY mean in light of this information.  Why are mexicans (black and mestizos but NOT whites) really pouring over the border.</p>
<p>Also&hellip;.why is there such a term as &#8220;hispanic&#8221; (a leftist term).  I&rsquo;ll answer that.  In order to divide white people from other white people, by lumping them in together with blacks and mestizos via a language difference.  It&rsquo;s the old divide and conquer strategy.  But think.  Would you deny the whiteness of an Irishman, a Frenchman, someone from Iceland, etc. because they spoke different languages?  Would you deny there are white people in France just because a few black muslims were paraded in front of you, and you were told they were French.<br>

		<p>Debating whether we would get along more with &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; or Blacks is almost as pointless as debating whether the chicken or the egg came first. First, I use quotes on Hispanic because these people invading this land are not Hispanic, or even &#8220;Latino&#8221; for that matter. The only Hispanics, to be sure, are Spaniards. The whites in Latin America have more in common with Spaniards, Italians, and other Europeans. Our are the refuse of Latin America, neither accepted by whites or mestizos. Illiterates with neither a command of the Spanish language or a desire to properly learn the language of their &#8220;host&#8221; nation.</p>
<p>Blacks as a whole are no better. Having lived in a black neighborhood until I was 18 I can tell you that I&rsquo;ve learned to praise the individual and condemn the race. To this day there&rsquo;s a part of me that feels more comfortable communicating with blacks than whites, but I also know that black neighborhoods are crime ridden not because of poverty, but because they are black, and black destroys what is white, whether architecturally, culturally, or genetically.</p>
<p>Some people make the argument (perhaps not here) that Asians are a better ally. They are not. The white man who sleeps with the Asian woman is just as much at fault for destroying our race as the white woman sleeping with the black man. </p>
<p>Personally I&rsquo;m disgusted with the state of this country, and even though Western Europe is in just as bad a shape (perhaps worse), I&rsquo;m of the opinion that I would rather go back there, and at least take up in the defense of my racial and ancestral homeland.    </p>

		<p>If history is any indication of what the future holds, the white race is really going to be in for it. We do not have very much of the world to call our own what with some places in the Americas and Europe making up the bulk of the white race. For some, the hostility blacks throw at us is obvious enough to give one pause. The asians are a different matter. They are more adept at presenting a face to us that assuages our affable nature.</p>
<p>The hispanics (whom I consider to be the more rogue asians) excluding  Europeans have a mindset that is going to have long-term consequences for the white race. The arrogance I have witnessed a number of them display when they felt they had the power was stifling. Think Genghis Khan. Think of the atrocities asians have inflicted upon the world over the course of history. Think of the billions upon billions of asians who do not really like us.<br>

Does one really need an opinion poll to know the obvious?  This nation&rsquo;s bizzarre efforts to accommodate cultural antagonism by denigrating and destroying European culture and its values, and replace it with something else (I am not sure what)is a senseless, hopeless and remorseless exercise that can only result in reverse discrimination and an explosive backlash. Such accommodation did not answer the cultural antagonisms of twentieth century Europe and millions died. It obviously did not work in the former USSR, again despite millions of deaths. It is not working in &#8220;modern&#8221; Europe and has been discarded in modern Russia.  Unless our nation accepts the reality of racial distinction and the right (indeed the need) for segregation, we are doomed to failure, violence and catastrophy. To answer that media hero, Rodney King, no, &#8220;we can&rsquo;t all just get along&#8221;. It is unnatural to believe otherwise.   </p>

		<p> I think there are regional differences at work here. We&rsquo;ve lived with blacks for hundreds of years here in the South. We know them very well. Blacks have some positive qualities as well as negative ones. Rural and religious blacks are easier to get along with than their urban big city secular cousins. Nevertheless, even down in Dixie black misbehavior has been increasing due to family disintegration, welfare dependency, drug use and negative popular culture influences. However, blacks are generally less hostile in the South, outside big cities, than places like Chicago, Boston or New York. </p>
<p>  As for the Hispanics, the name itself is meaningless. I think the problem is more with the lower class peons/cholos from Central America, Andes and Mexico. I&rsquo;ve known more than a few white Cubans and have liked them. Many educated middle class Latin Americans are white and will assimilate into our culture. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s the impoverished, lower, mixed race peons that contribute to the bulk of our immigration both legal and illegal. They are turning this once great country into an inefficient, crime-ridden, bankrupt, banana republic.<br>

		<p> ghw states that he doesn&rsquo;t like the idea of hyphenated Americans, [which] downplays the fact that those of European background founded this country and are responsible for the predominant culture.</p>
<p>I disagree, particularly since the youngest generation of those in the United States of European background is already minority status, and in the following decades this reality will catch up with the illusion that we are still a majority in the country we conquered and developed. <br>
At some point the term &ldquo;European-American&rdquo; is going to have to become the politically correct one in order for us to fight our way up from the lowly status  to which we are now consigned by today&rsquo;s culture masters<br>
   &mdash;  Paul Jones<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Thanks for your insightful comment.   I am aware of your point, and I can respect it   &mdash;   though I am far from sold.  Yes, it does create a false illusion that we are still the ruling majority in &#8220;our&#8221; country   &mdash;     the country we founded and built  &#8220;for our posterity&#8221;.  That  delusion can be harmful to our cause, I agree.   Those now in control  (&#8220;today&rsquo;s culture masters&#8221;, as you aptly call them)  would doubtless prefer us to continue thinking  exactly in that way.  It gives us a mistaken self-confidence and makes us an easier target since we think we can afford to be magnanimous and turn the other cheek, being so powerful as we imagine we are.</p>
<p>But do you really believe that once we have accepted reduction to  the status of just another  &#8220;minority&#8221; among a scramble of minorities, we will then  be treated fairly by those in power, that the anti-white bashing will stop, or that we will be allowed to  &#8220;fight our way back up&#8221; from that  &#8220;lowly status&#8221; we have been consigned?   I&rsquo;m very dubious about that.  </p>
<p>As some savvy posters here suggest  (e.g. Bon), it will  then be open season on whites, with no pretenses and gloves off.    Look at Rhodesia and South Africa as warning examples.  Are the whites there,  who did accept minority status,  having a good time of it today?</p>
<p>As I see it,  it&rsquo;s like losing your health, or your looks, or your youth.  Much easier to take care of it and hang on to it while you&rsquo;ve got it,  than try  to recover it once it&rsquo;s gone.  </p>
<p>When you look at history, do you find any groups  in power   &mdash;   who once having lost power, ever returned to power again?    Well &hellip; very, very rarely!    Where are the Romanovs and the Bourbons today?</p>
<p>Some things when they&rsquo;re gone, they&rsquo;re gone forever.</p>

		<p>Poster #42 has got it.</p>
<p>White and mostly white latinos are not the problem.  They have been present in this country since the Mexican Cession.  They assimilate and inject only a few pleasant &#8216;hispanic&rsquo; things in our culture that are easily accepted, mostly related to some food items and some architectural styles.  Such latinos are almost never involved in gangs or low class behavior.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s those who are from the lowest classes in latin america (indian/very mestizo) who are currently flooding in in great numbers, and they are merely bringing their low class behavior here, and demanding our free social services to help them.  They are picking up the &#8216;victim&rsquo; game from inner city blacks and are sucking us dry.</p>
<p>Similarly, it&rsquo;s not the rural or religious blacks that are a big problem.  They hearken back to an older stlye when black folks had stable families and communities.  It&rsquo;s the migrant blacks who left the farms for factories in the north and city life.  They were cut off from their cultural and familial traditions and baser instincts came out.  Urban ghetto culture grew from that.</p>

		<p>People seem to think that short term gains indicate short term thinking.  I would state just the opposite.  Relatively few and far between are those opportunities where -both- sides can equally get something without hurting either side.</p>
<p>But someone who thinks that the future can change will make those &#8216;desperation needs, the devil drives&rsquo; bargains to reach the point where they can afford to alter the rules of barter. </p>
<p>In this, what we have to look at is political motivations.  Not of the liberals but -against- them.</p>
<p>Tell a man that a Democrat is going to naturalize anything north of 20 million Hispanics and -then- &#8216;think about&rsquo; closing the borders.  Tell him that that Hispanic is going to soak all the social welfare services for everything he and his six person family can take the system for.  Let that man know that they will take all the cheap, dirty, jobs which form the basis of his livelihood.  All while breeding at roughly twice the rate of the rest of us.  Then tell him that the -total number- of those jobs, thanks to poor economic management and frivolous domestic and foreign spending policies, is deteriorating so fast that as much as 20% of the national &#8216;service&rsquo; job market is going to dry up AND NEVER COME BACK anyway.</p>
<p>And that man will support border closings, zero gain halts to immigration and total nullification of any -attempt- at Amnesty.</p>
<p>If he&rsquo;s poor enough to think that the greater threat comes from X race and not Y.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s that last sentence you have to pay attention to.  Because Hispanics will soon number as much as 50% of this nation, while Blacks, after 150 years of trying, are still at around 12%.  Largely because they kill themselves off and isolate themselves behind bars to the extent that it effects their generational survivability and SES statistics for all races of women.  OTOH, anyone who dominates 50% of the economy will have a real chance of SES being able to &#8216;buy&rsquo; the woman of his choice.  Which means we (whites) shrink as a people commensurate to the rate we shrink in our influence within society and our wealth as individuals.</p>
<p>A &#8216;native&rsquo; Hispanic who sees another Hispanic competing with him for a job, can always look to social welfare to save himself while dreaming of the day when Hispanics can control the flow of dispensed tax base and job allocations &#8216;as equal opportunists&rsquo; to the whites (in 2042 or so).</p>
<p>While a white hating Black can only look forwards to being further displaced from second best to third and even fourth best alternate because Asians will take jobs from whites, whites will try to push down Hispanics and Hispanics will laugh at any &#8216;you enslaved me, respect my victimhood!&rsquo; nonsense excuses from Blacks.</p>
<p>Freed of racial guilt, and thanks to their prolific birth rates and short generational intervals, Hispanics will ALSO have the white edge in unified numbers.  And they will all be young with a long duration at the top.  Which may well encourage them to form separate and distinctly racial political groups with the idea of &#8216;going right on in for the win&rsquo; as a 60-80% majority population in their own right.</p>
<p>All of which racial unity outcomes provide a powerful incentive to NOT compromise their current position.</p>
<p>Whatever we do to bring blacks into the fold, it&rsquo;s the 12 vs. 68 percent total population base issue that is going to be determinant in deciding -where we are- as a result: power to power.</p>
<p>The Hispanics I know are highly insular and simply refuse to speak when you bring up immigration issues, even if they are themselves full citizens, 2nd or 3rd generation.  They will argue their right to be here, vociferously, but they will claim neither loyalty to the same &#8216;proposition nationality&rsquo; that we share with them.  Nor admit to the reality of feeling greater affinity among their own (though it certainly shows up, demographically, in Mexicali), even though it hurts them on a cheaper grade of labor (and no family to support) basis.</p>
<p>Try dealing, politically, with someone that faces nothing but  negatives from any attempt at a communal defense of resources with the white culture that currently has them running restaurants and cleaning offices.  But who, if they just hang on another 20-30 years can look forward to OWNING the place, by sheer dint of numbers.</p>
<p>You dump a black voter base after 20-30 years of kicking the Democrats in the face for trying to elect a new majority (and thinking they will remain loyal, after), even assuming the black population base doubles to 24% of the total voting voting group, and those blacks, KNOWING WHAT IS COMING have still lost nothing in the way of social welfare benefits as transfer payments (smaller group = thicker gravy).</p>
<p>While whites are still very much in control over the total voting base at 50-60% dominant population majority.  All becaue, together, we prevented mass immigration of a third competing ethnic group.</p>
<p>This is long term strategy in short term increments.</p>
<p>_You don&rsquo;t have to like&rsquo;em to do what&rsquo;s best for your own_.</p>

&#8220;[Blacks] main source of power is the claim they are mistreated by whites. White people have spent hundreds of billions  in the last few decades trying to appease blacks, and what do we have to show for it?   If anything the charges of &ldquo;racism&rdquo; are increasing.&#8221;</p>

<p>So it is with extortionists. <br>
(And, let&rsquo;s face it, that&rsquo;s exactly what this amounts to: Give us what we want or we&rsquo;ll riot, loot, and burn your cities down! This has the effete elites soiling their trousers; the one thing that terrifies them is violence, the peasants coming after them with torches and pitchforks.  That, along with seeing their stocks tumble, their real estate vanish, and their department stores go up in smoke.)  </p>
<p>When extortionists see their strategy is successful, they come back for more.   The more  they get, the more they want. </p>

		<p>The fundamental question underlying all of this is this:</p>
<p>What is a Hispanic?</p>
<p>I contend that there really is no such thing as a Hispanic.  There ARE people of various racial categories who live in the western Hemisphere and speak Spanish, or live in countries where Spanish is the dominant language (in case they don&rsquo;t speak Spanish themselves), or are descendants of such.</p>
<p>Here is an example.  Two different pictures.  Both men have the surname Sandoval:</p>

		<p> I dont think Hispanics will govern whites, it will be still whites who will be on the top like on other hispanics countries. At most they will mix with whites trying to reach top positions. Look at Mexico and see who is in charge.</p>

&ldquo;I would like to suggest that the clunky, PC, phrase &ldquo;his or her&rdquo; be replaced with pronouns like &ldquo;their, them, they, we, our, etc. It is far less ugly, does not conjure up visions of feminazism, and also happens to be proper English usage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Actually, you are suggesting that we replace a grammatically correct PC phrase with a grammatically incorrect PC phrase.</p>
<p>In proper English usage, singular pronouns replace singular proper nouns and plural pronouns replace plural proper nouns. </p>
