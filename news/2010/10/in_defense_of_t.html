<p><img src="/graphics/spacer.gif" width="550" height="1"><br>
Toledo, Ohio: Kyle Bristow  &mdash;  a second year law student at the University of Toledo College of Law, three-time elected Republican precinct delegate for the 29th precinct of Michigan&rsquo;s 12th congressional district, and former chairman of the infamous right-wing chapter of the Young Americans for Freedom at Michigan State University (MSU-YAF)  &mdash;  has written a novel about the persecution that white people have been subjected to by non-whites and leftists throughout world history. The 270-page book is available for purchase from Amazon.com for the price of $17.76.</p>
<p>In the novel, which is entitled <cite>White Apocalypse,</cite> a rogue anthropologist teams up with a proponent of the Solutrean Hypothesis and a fiery lawyer in order to reveal to the world the shocking truth that carries immense cultural, political, and racial significance: 17,000 years ago, white people immigrated to North and South America from Europe, and when the Amerindians arrived from the Orient by crossing the Bering Strait roughly 12,000 years ago, the latter subsequently and systematically murdered the former. As the reader soon realizes, the powers that be will do everything that they can to prevent this controversial theory from being espoused by the trio, and during this action-packed, semi-fictional thriller, the epic adventure will take the advocates of historical revisionism from the forests of southeastern Michigan to a federal courtroom in Ohio, from the busy streets of Washington, D.C. to an Amerindian reservation in Virginia.</p>
<p>The author holds a degree in international relations from MSU, and while he was an undergraduate student there and as the chairman of MSU-YAF he hosted as speakers at public events numerous prominent conservative politicians and activists including: Nick Griffin of the British National Party; then-Congressman Tom Tancredo; Chris Simcox of the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps; Jennifer Gratz, who sued the University of Michigan for its affirmative action policies and took her case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court; Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies; and many, many others. These public events were protested by violent left-wing agitators and were covered by a myriad of national newspapers and television news shows. Bristow has been interviewed by Bill O&rsquo;Reilly on <cite>The O&rsquo;Reilly Factor</cite> and has been quoted by Sean Hannity on <cite>Hannity &amp; Colmes.</cite> Due to the author&rsquo;s steadfast advocacy for immigration control and opposition to race-based preferential treatment for non-whites, he has needed an armed police escort on no less than six occasions.</p>
<p>Kyle Bristow said, &#8220;I wrote this book to bring attention to the persecution that white folk have faced over the years. After doing extensive research, I have come to the conclusion that liberals and non-whites believe that the White race and its civilization  &mdash;  Western culture  &mdash;  should die. The actions and words of the Culture-distorters overwhelmingly confirm this belief.&#8221; Bristow also said, &#8220;I chose the title <cite>White Apocalypse,</cite> because there are two meanings for apocalypse: (1) the revelation of divine truth and (2) annihilation. Both definitions apply to the subject matter of my novel.&#8221;</p>
<p>To date, no less than a half dozen articles have been posted by leftist websites to condemn the novel  &mdash;  even though not a single sentence of the text had been released and reviewed by them. One left-wing detractor went so far as to accuse Bristow of using literature to &#8220;foment White Power&#8221; and called his novel &#8220;White Power propaganda.&#8221; A far-left website posted the response of Dr. Dennis Stanford, the Head of the Archeology Division and Director of the Paleo-Indian Program at the National Museum of Natural History, to an inquiry regarding <cite>White Apocalypse:</cite> Dr. Stanford condemned the fictional work  &mdash;  even though he had yet to read any of it  &mdash;  on the basis that there are &#8220;several major problems&#8221; with the pro-white themes.</p>
<p>The who&rsquo;s who of the patriot movement who were given advance copies of the novel, on the other hand, have praised <cite>White Apocalypse.</cite> Said these people:</p>
<p><img src="/graphics/spacer.gif" width="550" height="7"><br>
 &#8220;Bristow&rsquo;s fast-paced story is laced with well-documented scientific and historical data, as the theory itself is Earth-shattering: imagine  &mdash;  if you can  &mdash;  a reality in which Whites are the historical victims  &mdash;  and not the perpetrators  &mdash;  of genocide. Could the System continue to peddle their daily, anti-White elixir uncontested without this Original Sin firmly in place to remind Whites of our alleged race-guilt? This evidence could be the jolt Whites need to awaken from our suicidal slumber! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I salute Kyle Bristow for his genuine courage.&#8221;<br>

 &#8220;<cite>White Apocalypse</cite> has all the characteristics of a Bildungsroman as it portrays a young white man coming of age and becoming aware of the Big Lie of the liberal System. The author keeps the reader in suspense by providing thrilling descriptions of his characters on the move: either hunting down their racial detractors or being hunted down themselves. The main thesis is well stated: Whites are being outbred, outnumbered, outsourced, and outsmarted everywhere due to their inborn sense of justice and their extraordinary naiveté in downplaying the conceptual world of the Others.&#8221;<br>

 &#8220;The central topic of <cite>White Apocalypse</cite> is ethnic conflict over the construction of culture  &mdash;  the central issue of our time. At its heart is an emotionally compelling account of Whites as historical victims of non-Whites  &mdash;  just the sort of thing we need to motivate a renaissance among our people.

 &#8220;Our friend Kyle Bristow has courageously written an astounding story based on a theory that will gall today&rsquo;s White-hating bigots  &mdash;  that White people are the real Native Americans and are the original victims of genocide. <cite>White Apocalypse</cite> is fascinating, tough, compelling, glowing with White pride, and sorely needed these days, for European Americans are subjected to non-stop insult, abuse, and bashing  &mdash;  like the undercard to a soon-to-come main event. Some of the scenes are eerily like events we see taking place every day. Bristow reinforces his story with science and tells it with a realism that makes it seem like something inevitable  &mdash;  in short, <cite>White Apocalypse</cite> is possible. I am pleased to welcome and recommend it.&#8221;<br>

 &#8220;Kyle Bristow&rsquo;s novel dedicated to North America&rsquo;s &#8216;real Native Americans&rsquo;  &mdash;  Europeans who have been here for more than 15,000 years  &mdash;  is a soaring inspirational dramatization of our people taking our continent back from the Third World invaders. From the very first cathartic scene in which the protagonist dispatches a gang of Hispanic thugs seeking to murder his family, I felt I was reading the actualization of Rudyard Kipling&rsquo;s insightful poem &#8216;The Wrath of the Awakened Saxon.&rsquo;&#8221;<br>

 &#8220;<cite>White Apocalypse</cite> is an excellent fictionalized novel that is well-written and very informative. I would not hesitate to recommend it to any White Nationalist who is unfamiliar with the Solutrean Theory, and it might even make significant inroads into the mainstream conservative movement. The action sequences kept me hungrily moving towards the dramatic conclusion as the evocative narrative unfolded; I didn&rsquo;t want to stop reading and found myself rearranging my set schedule in order to make time to read it. The character development is believable, and the principals were sympathetic and heroically drawn. I enjoyed it immensely!&#8221;<br>

 &#8220;Bristow&rsquo;s <cite>White Apocalypse</cite> is a first-rate fictional novel and a good book to give to beginners in the resistance movement.

		<p>The bulk of great literature doesn&rsquo;t have a &#8220;contemporary&#8221; political agenda. I will read this book before final judgement. But to be frank, the Iliad, the Odyssey, Aeneid, Beowulf and Shakespeare, let alone Yeats and Frost in our own era, demonstrate white cultural supremacy. The authors of these works are subtle, sometimes difficult, and they could care less about the average person, white, black, yellow or green. True conservatism is not about popularity, polls, or what the average person, regardless of political or religious views thinks, In other words, who cares what jerks like Palin or Hannity think?<br>
With the exception of George Will, there are very few if any Buckleys, Weavers, Tafts, Thurmonds or Calhouns in our world.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t care if whites were in America thousands of years ago and were massacred. Whites were massacred by the Huns and by the Muslims in the Late Antiquity and in the Middle Ages too, so what?</p>
<p>More relevantly, I do care that traditional white culture is today officially suppressed by our government, our schools and the corporate media.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be buying this book, but newcomers should understand that this isn&rsquo;t any fantasy scenario invented for the novel.  More and more, it&rsquo;s been looking like factual history, but when it&rsquo;s mentioned at all in public, it&rsquo;s pigeonholed and tucked away as &#8220;controversial&#8221;   &mdash;   if it gets any exposure at all.</p>
<p>The carpet bombing of Kennewick Man was no isolated incident.  Make no mistake about it, right or wrong, this hypothesis is downright dangerous to the powers that be.<br>

		<p>The book sounds like an interesting work of fiction.  Given that it&rsquo;s so hated by the left, it&rsquo;s no doubt a good read so I plan to buy it.  But its claim that white people were the first settlers of this continent is something I will leave in the fiction category unless and until I see substantial evidence for its truth.  Kennewick Man may or may not have been European, but in any case that skeleton is 9600 years old whereas there is ample evidence that people had settled the Americas well before 12,000 years ago.  The first unequivocally white people to settle in North America were the Norsemen, and they <i>were</i> wiped out by the Indians.</p>
<p>We should not fall into the trap of constructing a grand but false history that credits our people for accomplishments they didn&rsquo;t make, as all too many blacks do.  (Some blacks like to claim that blacks settled the Americas before whites did.  You don&rsquo;t take <i>them</i> seriously, do you?)<br>

<p>If it is a spectacular success, especially if it becomes a best seller, that provides valuable information about the status of what whites really think about race.</p>

		<p>I have a friend who has cherokee ancestors, he was and still is vehemently angered and ashamed at how certain elements of Tribal authorities acted in the Kennewick case. In his words &#8220;they are so afraid of losing their victim status that they literally buried the truth by denying a proper scientific study of the remains even after it was obvious they were not of the same racial group. These actions make us all look like cowards.&#8221; <br>
 Whitey was here first and got killed off by climate change and asiatic tribes. Even the last faux history channel special on the subject said as much but enferred the two groups simply intermingled peacefully when westward moving Euros met up with the newcomers, yeah right. At least the fact that Europeans were here first was presented as factual. </p>

		<p>The cover of the book certainly could be better, it will play into the hands of the SPLC and its ilk. Perhaps thats his plan to gain more media exposure. Personally I see no point in the use of an Odal rune and germanic wood block style lettering for this book. Neither has anything to do with the subject matter of the book. A Tom Clancy style cover would probably be a far wiser choice than useing such stereotypical images for a book of this genre</p>

		<p>Can&rsquo;t comment on the book, but this press release gives me a slightly queasy feeling.  An &#8220;account of Whites as historical victims&#8221;? This is supposed to inspire us? And phrases like &#8220;infamous right-wing&#8221; could have been written by any of those effeminate leftists who condemned the book without reading it.

		<p>Didactic, There has been great anti-collectivist literature like The Fountainhead and<br>
Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand. The Camp Of The Saints was a great <br>
anti-immigration novel. </p>
<p>George Will, like Buckley, was a half carat phony who accepted all the left cultural premises. See William F. Buckley, Pied Piper For The Establishment, by John McManus. To compare these two phonies to Weaver, Calhoun, etc., is obscene. <br>
This new novel sounds great and I&rsquo;m going to get it. </p>
<p>Comparisons with ancient authors is irrelevant.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a friend of Bristow&rsquo;s and was given an advance copy.  The book is really, really interesting.  The left is going to hate it because Bristow does a good job of assigning race-guilt to the other races.

		<p>&#8220;17,000 years ago, white people immigrated to North and South America from Europe&#8221;</p>
<p>The problem is that the people in Europe 17000 years ago were not white. The Indo-European migration INTO Europe occurred no earlier than 9000 years ago according to the Anatolian hypothesis, 7000 years ago according to the Kurgan hypothesis, and even more recently according to other theories. 17000(!) years ago Europe was populated only by Paleolithics, who were progressively displaced by many waves of subsequent, more advanced migrations into Europe, the last of which were the Indo-Europeans, and only AFTER which it makes anthropological sense to talk about white people.</p>
<p>Just as it would be dishonest for the Chinese to consider Amerindians as their ancestors, so it is equally dishonest for whites to consider Solutreans as their ancestors.</p>

Agreed. Like it or not, that cover and that lettering have certain, uh, connotations. Connotations of the sort that AR generally strives to avoid. Of the sort that will be used as evidence that the author is a Bad, Bad Man. You know what I&rsquo;m talking about. So my personal suggestion is, for future editions, to consider a cover design less open to misinterpretation. The title and the content of this novel will bring enough accusations of unsavory associations; you don&rsquo;t need to give your enemies ammo with an inflammatory cover.  </p>
<p>As for the work itself, it sounds refreshingly different. And based on the author&rsquo;s background, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s intelligent, hard-hitting and well written   &mdash;   even if the Kennewick Man, ancient-white-North-Americans angle places the book, for me, firmly on the Fiction shelf. <br>

		<p>Before the author of <i>White Apocalypse</i> there was a gentleman by the name of Barry Fell,who wrote a number of books (3 if I recall correctly) on pre-colombian <i>Celtic</i> migration and colonies in North America.</p>
<p>These books are backed up by some very plausible sounding language-based research,and some very plausible sounding research on some oddball structures in New England that were colloquially known as root cellars,and which seem to have been temples or calendar regulation structures,or a combination thereof.</p>
<p>His books are very readable,and while a certain amount of conjecture was used in writing them,they definitely don&rsquo;t fall into the category of fiction.</p>
<p>Anyone about to buy <i>White Apocalypse</i> should also seriously consider some of the books of B.Fell. Good stuff!</p>

		<p>There are some constructive criticisms above that I can relate to myself.  I applaud this man for what he is doing, and I hope he is successful.  But this sort of focus on his part really isn&rsquo;t my cup of tea.  </p>
<p>By focusing on &#8220;how whites were victims of other races&#8221; makes us no different from the weaker people on the planet who always remind us that they were on the disadvantaged side of world history.  White people are above that.  </p>
<p>I personally like focusing on all the white race&rsquo;s accomplishments (Greece, Rome, Persia, Byzantium, the Renaissance, modern science, industrialization&hellip;.many many things).  </p>
<p>Focusing on how we as white people &#8220;are victims just like everyone else&#8221; kind of stands in contradiction to how we like to pride ourselves on producing some of the most, if not THE most, remarkable civilizations the world has seen.</p>
<p>Were these early &#8220;whites&#8221; in America as high-IQed as the whites that came over later?  It doesn&rsquo;t sound like it to me, if they got wiped out so easily by the people that we now call &#8220;Native Americans&#8221; .  I think we need to examine this part of history a little better before we start calling these people &#8220;white&#8221;.</p>
<p>This reminds me of how there are people in this movement who insist that the creators of Chinese, Aztec, and Mayan civilization were white.  If so, why does it matter?  Our own civilizations are brilliant enough.  </p>
<p>We make ourselves look weak and inferior when we try to take credit for stuff other people did.  The Mayan civilization?  Really?  The heads on Easter Island?  Really?  What an insult to white people to even suggest or make a big deal about such things.</p>

		<p>As a sociologist, I find the premise of Bristow&rsquo;s novel to be great propaganda for our movement.  Identity is salient, and when people conceptualize an attack on one of their many identities (i.e., race, gender, nationality, religion, profession, etc., etc.), that identity comes to the forefront.  For example, make a disparaging comment about homosexuality and if a homosexual hears it, they will become most cognizant of their sexuality.  If one starts making fun of lawyers and a lawyer hears it, the saliency of the lawyer&rsquo;s chosen profession will increase.  This &ldquo;identity-saliency construct&rdquo; is why Jewish people are able to be united so very much along racial-cultural lines:  by claiming always that they are subject to persecution by anti-Semites, their people are reminded constantly that they must unite together along racial-cultural lines to survive.</p>
<p>This novel sounds like a literary version of the &ldquo;false flag&rdquo; operation.  Even if it is fictional, writing about purported conspiracies to persecute white people will foster white racial consciousness in our people.  Absolutely brilliant idea!</p>

<p>Very good words Courtney. While I agree with that point you make I disagree with the main argument of your post. Reality is, in America today, and for quite some time now, those who are the lowest are exalted the highest. At the very least, claims of white victims or victimhood or exclusion, offer a legitimate rationale for the existence of &#8216;white supremacist&rsquo; groups. If whites are unhappy about the way things are, with the biggest &#8216;losers&rsquo; being exalted the highest, etc, they should take solace in the fact the only way to change how &#8216;the system&rsquo; works IS to make whites out to be victims. Whether you agree with the tactic or not, I Personally feel that &#8216;whites as the major victim&rsquo; will make the current system collapse. Nothing else can end the madness?</p>

		<p>This novel is racial-political-cultural dynamite!  It is going to blow the System-perpetuated worldview  &mdash;  that &#8220;Whitey is evil&#8221;  &mdash;  to smithereens!</p>

		<p>I just bought it and can&rsquo;t wait to read it.  There is a lot of chatter about this book on left-wing websites and Facebook.  I wonder if they know something that we don&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>Although I agree that the idea of whites as victims is not what many people of our movement would like to think, there is still some truth to it.  Be sure to read the New Century Foundation&rsquo;s document about non-white-on-white crime in this country.  Calling out the evil, even if it is through the medium of fiction, is justified.</p>

		<p>This book sounds very interesting. White America needs a binding myth, for guilt-free unity is essential in saving White America. And there is even scientific evidence to back up the myth. Obviously, the Left is scared. Excellent.</p>

		<p>I refrained from making any  comments until I had received (hot off the presses!) my copy of this novel. All of the supposed &#8216;criticisms&rsquo; of this book are explained if you just READ it. ( Why the typefont, the symbol, etc.)</p>
<p>Already at only page 50, so far we have witnessed rapid-fire action, malic aforethought, academic obfuscation, lowlife murderous intent, and one of the best uses of sarcasm I have read in a long time. I was both engrossed, and laughing at the same paragraph.</p>
<p>The book musters a HUGE array of facts even in this first half-hundred pages- so much so, that ANY cavil about the &#8216;supposed science&rsquo; of the &#8220;Solutrean Hypothesis&#8221; becomes only so much disinformatia. The Author has done a STELLAR job of doing what novels of this type do best- grab you by the lapels, drag you into a conflict of international proportions, and keep you engrossed&hellip; THAT IS, if caring about Western Man, his future, and the LIES we have been told for over 80 YEARS matters one whit.</p>
<p>If such does NOT engross you, then no, you WON&rsquo;T like this book. But we already KNOW who doesn&rsquo;t like the book, and who tried to &#8216;shut it down&rsquo; before it even hit the mass market.</p>
<p>Read the book, talk about it, and think about the premise. That&rsquo;s all the author is asking, but how he DELIVERS on this information dissemination, is of a level I have not seen, since &#8216;Camp of the Saints.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>As per usual and not to be outdone in the <i>human achievements department</i>, apparently it were Africans who first happened upon the American continent - pre-Columbus era.</p>

		<p>As a conservative white person the problem lies only with white people- those who discriminate against fellow whites.  It is too late because half of whites hate whites and the other half are cowards.<br>
Everyone who has ever harmed me in life has been white.<br>
Most of the people who have helped me have been non-white.<br>
Something wrong here!<br>
I went into a sporting goods store today and the white teenager would not even make eye contact with me but spent all of his time sucking up to a black male customer.  His teachers probably taught him to hate older white males.  Good for him, because when he is my age he will be a minority in his own country and this white guy will not be around to give him a job or pay for his education.  I only regret that I will not be there to see him suffer.</p>
