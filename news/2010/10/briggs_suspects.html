			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Vaughn McClure, WGN-TV (Chicago), October 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Linebacker Lance Briggs said a Chicago nightclub&rsquo;s decision to deny entry to 20-plus Bears players Monday night might have had something to do with race.</p>
<p>Briggs confirmed a Sun-Times report stating a group of Bears, of varied races, was turned down at Angels and Kings nightclub, located at 710 N. Clark.</p>
<p>&#8220;It probably was,&#8221; Briggs, who is black, said Thursday when asked if he thought the snub was racially motivated. &#8220;I didn&rsquo;t get all the details and everything was hearsay, but there shouldn&rsquo;t have been a problem with any of us getting in.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Brian Urlacher&rsquo;s brother, Casey (who is white), set up the event as part of the team&rsquo;s &#8220;rookie night,&#8221; celebration. He reserved four tables at Angels and Kings that were supposed to be roped off in the V.I.P. section.</p>
<p>{snip} Casey Urlacher went to the door [of the club] and was told by the promoters he could not bring the group inside because there were too many men.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for a Chicago nightclub to keep a group of five or more men from entering a club without any women in their party.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><br>
Idonije [defensive linemen Israel Idonije, who was already inside the club] responded &#8220;absolutely not&#8221; when asked if thought the incident was racial.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The club released the following statement:</p>
<p>&#8220;Every Monday night, operations of the bar are turned over to an outside vendor who hosts special events. We understand that this Monday night, members of the Chicago Bears were not admitted to the venue. We have terminated our relationship with the outside vendor. We will continue to investigate the facts and have started to reach out and apologize to the various Bears players who were involved.&#8221;<br>

		<p>The only two times in bartending when I had to resort to &#8220;Nightstick Postition B&#8221; were for 1.) A rugby team and 2.) National Guard Pilots being called up for Iraq `91. In both cases it was to derail their plans for telling ME what to do for the rest of the night. <br>
  Better to keep them outside the door and if I had had that option I certanily would have. You cannot surrender control, ever!! It was for this reason I had to slam the phone down once on a women customer who was calling the police on another customer. I told her, &#8220;You have the right to tell me the ship is sinking, but not to order Abandon Ship!&#8221;  A bartender, the good ones that is, take it upon themselves to exercise authority somewhere between God and an Airline Captain. Twenty guys would have turned this club into the Chicago Bears locker room for the night, and frankly I`m not that into football, hero worship or stupid alcohol fueled antics of 300lb+ lineman&hellip;<br>
 It`s like when I corrected a nine year old boy who called me over thinking I was his waiter, when I told him I was the bartender he replied in a pre-pubescent sarcastic voice, &#8220;Whats the difference!?!&#8221;  I told him, &#8221; A waiter takes orders, and a bartender gives them&hellip;&#8221; He didn`t get it but his dad did, pronto!</p>

		<p>I like Tim&rsquo;s answer. </p>
<p>I still go to clubs to dance and to hot dog. I generally don&rsquo;t like clubs that have a preponderance of men looking for a woman for the night. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like loud, drunk customers sitting next to me.</p>
<p>In fact, I don&rsquo;t like drunks periods.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like violence or the potential for violence.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t having to have a lot of security constantly hanging around waiting&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like waitresses who are forever trying to get you to buy another drink,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like poor food quality.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like rude bartenders.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like giving a hundred dollar bill to the waitress for twenty dollars worth of drinks and not getting any change.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like rap music.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like a bunch of fat blacks simulating anal intercourse on the dance floor and then calling it &#8220;our dance&#8221;. In fact, I generally don&rsquo;t like blacks period much less spending my evening with them. When the D.J. plays a Bolero I prefer dancing with people who know the dance rather than with people who can&rsquo;t even spell the word!</p>
<p>I particularly don&rsquo;t like blacks who can&rsquo;t dance at all hustling my wife who can and does.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like ex football players who think that since they could play a game a one time they have priority. They don&rsquo;t. In my view nothing is more disgusting than a fat ex black football player. I don&rsquo;t care what you did, only what you can do. I live in the present, not the past!</p>
<p>Generally football players can&rsquo;t dance at all! They all seem to have the flexibility of an iron spike. If a person is morbidly obese the fact that he is a professional football player doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that he is a fat slob.</p>
<p>So of course, the club caves in, and fires the people who excluded the players. </p>
<p>Good, the Bears need to spend a lot more time in the weight room and doing aerobics, the team is fat, out of shape, weak, and slow. They certainly don&rsquo;t need to be partying!</p>

		<p>The bouncer was fired?!?  It is apparently a common club POLICY to not allow large groups of men in, and yet following this custom will apperently get you fired if those being thrown out are black!  I&rsquo;m sure there were other blacks in the club, and the article stated that the group of Cubs players consisted of &#8220;varied races,&#8221; one of which must have been white.  So, I don;t see why anyone would assume racism in this case.  But blacks these days always assume racism is at every corner.  For example, in my Physics class, when the teacher read a list of all the students the previous day&rsquo;s substitute had written down as misbehaving, and they all happened to be black, some black children yelled &#8220;Oh, she raciss!&#8221; and &#8220;She just bein&rsquo; raciss!&#8221;  In all fairness, she may have been, because one girl who had talked back to her and was repeatedly texting in class, she did not write down and simply told the teacher the next day that &#8220;One of the girls gave me some problems.  But it really wasen&rsquo;t that bad.&#8221;  But still, why would blacks assume the substitute was &#8220;racist?&#8221;  Haven&rsquo;t they realized yet that they tend to act in a manner which is most unsavory to teachers and adults in general?  And on another occasion, the teacher told us that the previous day, when he had asked another period who in the class had checked out textbooks, the only two students who raised their hands were also the only two whites in that class.  Can you guess the reaction?  &#8220;Racist!&#8221;  Simply for stating (and interpreting) a fact.  And on yet another occasion, when the teacher joked about how one black kid had a name which led his wife to inquire, &#8220;Is that even a real name?&#8221;.  The blacks, once again, found that to be a racist comment, for whatever reason (the boy&rsquo;s name was Arabic, not African or anything).</p>
<p>So yes, apparently blacks see racism in everything.  Hurt them in any way, and they conclude that it is not their individual actions which led to whatever consequence, but rather their race.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I don`t like giving a hundred dollar  bill to the waitress and not getting any change.&#8221;-MoMo</p>
<p>Ain`t that the truth!! Talk about New Orleans rules&hellip;</p>
<p>I`ve only been shortchanged intentionally twice or three times in my life. But lately, Ive been seeing &#8220;service failures&#8221; of clerks not following what I think would be mandatory rules for giving back change.</p>
<p> I was at a convenience store where the clerk took my twenty and owed me seventeen before he closed the cash drawer and moved from behind the counter to assist a customer. &#8220;Hey!! You owe me 17 dollars,&#8221; I shouted at him. He replied in an annoyed voice that he knew it and would be back in a moment to give me my money. &#8220;Well, give it to me now!!&#8221; I shrieked. He didn`t . So I gave him an earful about the time to give back change is when you have the drawer open to take mine. And&hellip; money aside he moved on to another customer before completing my transaction.</p>
<p>  Another girl at a fast food drive thru (I know! I know!) took my twenty and laid the change on top of the till instead of handing it to me. Then closed the window! I let it pass as their usual procedure is to hand back change when giving the drink thru the window. When she did THAT and still no change, I yelped at her. &#8220;I was was going to give it to you sir,&#8221; she said. I asked, &#8220;Well, when?!? You`ve already passed up two chances to do it!&#8221; AS I pulled off I remembered my un-kept promise to myself to start keeping exact change on me, cause I`m tired of asking for what`s mine. Maybe that`s their plan&hellip;</p>

		<p>It occurred to me that the obvious (if unstated) message here is that it&rsquo;s okay to discriminate against men due to their sex, but not okay to discriminate against blacks down to their race.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the particulars of the law here, but in my experience, it is indeed a-okay to discriminate against men, particularly white men, even though so-called &#8220;anti-discrimination&#8221; law (anti-freedom law) often forbids sex discrimination.</p>
<p>Nothing particularly new there.</p>
<p>But it also occurred to me that so-called &#8220;anti-discrimination&#8221; law (anti-freedom law) also often forbids discrimination on the basis of sexual <i>orientation</i> which, in terms of black letter law, leaves a huge chink in liberals&rsquo; armor, since, obviously, a white man&rsquo;s preference for white women is both a marker for ethnopatriotism <i>and</i> a protected status.</p>
<p>Food for thought, eh?</p>

		<p>While I&rsquo;m always leery of anything that smacks of initiation rites ala &#8216;Rookie Night&rsquo;, it looks to me more like a classic case of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing.  <br>
Which means you are talking to some schlub who mops the floor after everyone goes home.</p>
<p>This is one of those things where clearly someone has not bridged the generation gap with &#8216;the word&rsquo; on how this kind of thing is handled.  Talk to the head, not to the hands.</p>
<p>FIRST, you have the manager or one or two of the lead players find a club the team agrees they like and &#8216;make a donation&rsquo; to the club manager&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s college fund or ski condo in Vale or whatever.</p>
<p>And then, when the deal is set, he&rsquo;s on their speed dialer when they want a night out.</p>
<p>You deal with some middle man and it&rsquo;s a coin toss whether he knows his arse from his elbow, especially if it&rsquo;s an &#8216;outside vendor&rsquo; thing.</p>
<p>You call up da&rsquo; boss and da&rsquo; boss -tells- the middle man and says: &#8220;These gentlemen have reserved seats, you make their experience worthwhile.&#8221;  And if the middleman knows where his paycheck comes from, he responds &#8216;how hi on the fly, sir!&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And of course it works the other way too.</p>
<p>If some jackass gets drunk and decides to ski down the bar with a beer nut balanced on his nose, you call up the team manager and let HIM know that _The Chicago Bears_ are responsible for the damages and they had better stop sending 15 year olds to your establishment or the entire team will not be welcome anymore.  At which point junior gets &#8216;a suspension&rsquo; from club night or picks up everybody&rsquo;s tab for a year and the lesson is learned.</p>
<p>There is a lot to be said for the _privilege_ going both ways here.  You know that if you show up at the team bar after a hard loss, there won&rsquo;t be disappointed fans jamming you up for every mistake or nosey damn reporters wanting an exclusive.  Usually those nights are really quiet.  And on winning nights, the club makes money hand over fist.</p>
<p>That said, &#8216;the failure of communication&rsquo; comes from making team:club business public.  Read the comments section, it&rsquo;s clear that Chicago is split down the middle by race on this, and that just makes it harder for people to take care of business.</p>
<p>As much as some may not like to hear it here, there is only one color in business.</p>

A nice blond/blue eyed girl I am dating has a sister who was at first sleeping with a black guy now she is falling in &#8220;love&#8221; with him. She has already disclosed he &#8220;smokes&#8221; and does other things. I&rsquo;m disgusted, I let her know this is an issue. She thinks less so.
