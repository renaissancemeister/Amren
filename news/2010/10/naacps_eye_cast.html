<h1>NAACP&rsquo;s Eye Cast on W-B Area</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sherry Long, Times Leader (Wilkes-Barre), October 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>All children deserve to have teachers that look like them, said some Wilkes-Barre Area parents at a diversity forum Saturday.</p>
<p>The Wilkes-Barre branch of the NAACP has been waging this battle on and off for 15 years, demanding equality among the hiring practices at the Wilkes-Barre Area School District, and members said they don&rsquo;t plan to stop now.</p>
<p>Members of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and others discussed the need for more teachers of diversity and how to spur Wilkes-Barre Area into actively recruiting minority teachers by looking outside the immediate area during a Diversity Forum at Mt. Zion Baptist Church on Hill Street.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Minority children make up about 40 percent of the student population at Wilkes-Barre Area, Felton [NAACP Wilkes-Barre president, Ron Felton] said. That&rsquo;s up from the 25 percent of students enrolled in 2006, yet minority teachers are still less than 1 percent of the district&rsquo;s staff, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A small group of white Nationalists in attendance made a few remarks and asked some questions throughout the two-hour meeting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One woman in Smith&rsquo;s [Steve Smith, a member of American Third Position and Regional Coordinator of Keystone United] group, who did not give her name, asked if the NAACP had proof of any minority quality applicants seeking employment.</p>
<p>Robert McLeod taught for a decade at Heights Elementary in Wilkes-Barre until 2007, when he moved to Maryland. A former Teacher of the Month recipient, who possesses a master&rsquo;s degree from Bloomsburg University and is certified to teach in 27 states, McLeod moved back into the region recently to take care of family matters and has applied for another position with Wilkes-Barre Area.</p>
<p>He has not been hired and is substitute teaching in Scranton.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>McLeod explained how important it is for all students to have teachers that look like them as he told the story of how one of his students once gave him a letter stating that she didn&rsquo;t know that black men could be teachers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wilkes-Barre Area Multi-cultural Diversity Coordinator Julia Hoskins attended the forum and took notes to take back to share with Superintendent Jeff Namey.</p>

		<p>Hmmmm.  Wasn&rsquo;t this the same NAACP that told the Tea Party that they needed to get rid of the racist elements in their society, while these NAACP only champion for blacks?  Isn&rsquo;t this the same NAACP that called the Tea Party racist, yet they&rsquo;re silent in regards to the Black Panther Party?  Yet they&rsquo;re silent in regards to the numbers of black-on-white crimes?</p>

		<p>I do think black kids should have teachers who not only look like them but act like them, think like them and dress like them. The children will feel better. </p>
<p>Likewise, white children should have white teachers,not Filipino, Indian, African or Peruvian teachers. Diversity is good. The secretary of Education says so. Obama says so. It must then be so. </p>
<p>Divesity doesn&rsquo;t mean integration under the post-racial dogma. It means segregation. Doesn&rsquo;t all this make sense? It would if diversity = segregation, including different school systems for different groups, responsible for funding their own schools. </p>
<p>Since blacks tell us how important education is for them, they will forego weekend in clubs(200-300 bucks per weekend), clothes (thousand per month) cars (BMW/Audi 45,000) and trips to Bahamas(2,500). </p>
<p>Tuition for world class schools taught by those world class black teachers who look like the world class black students will be a breeze. </p>
<p>And bye bye Federal Dept of Education(shut it down, rebate money to TAXPAYERS, which does not include most blacks),</p>

<p>Oh, great! That means that we can demand that White students be taught by White teachers, now, right?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Minority children make up about 40 percent of the student population at Wilkes-Barre Area&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Having had the unpleasant experience of driving through that once-White city on many occasions, I can confirm this.  And the number of them who <i>aren&rsquo;t</i> in school is probably much higher.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;McLeod explained how important it is for all students to have teachers that look like them as he told the story of how one of his students once gave him a letter stating that she didn&rsquo;t know that black men could be teachers.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Assuming that this poor waif existed at all (I don&rsquo;t assume it), it seems that he never watched a minute of television in his entire life.  He&rsquo;d have seen all the black teachers he could ever wish for on the Propaganda Box.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;A small group of white Nationalists in attendance made a few remarks and asked some questions throughout the two-hour meeting.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>This was the line that jumped out at me.  Not &#8220;A tiny handful of hate-filled White racists made offensive remarks.&#8221;  Not &#8220;A minuscule skinhead rabble tried to disrupt the proceedings.&#8221; Just a simple nonjudgmental observation.</p>
<p>Granted, the description of a &#8220;small&#8221; group that &#8220;asked &#8216;some&rsquo; questions&#8221; (none of which are quoted) isn&rsquo;t exactly a ringing endorsement of White nationalism. But it at least shows that in a few places, at least, White nationalists are beginning to become a force to be reckoned with. </p>
<p>Progress comes in tiny steps.  But a few beams of light are finally beginning to show through the cracks.<br>

		<p>For once I have to agree 100% with the NAACP blacks do deserve teachers who look just like them because in my mind at least this would free up the white teachers who want to teach and the non black kids who go to school to learn,  Not Bully, Steal and Destroy school property.</p>
<p>I taught school for twenty years and out of hundreds of blacks I only found a very few who wanted to learn.<br>
They truly are a problem that might never be addressed? They love tearing up the most expensive and up to date books and computers acting the clown.</p>

		<p>Yes! I couldn&rsquo;t agree more!<br>
Blacks should teach blacks and whites should teach whites. In fact I would be for completely segregated schools. That way no screams of racism can be leveled. As long as exactly the same amount of money is spent per student why not?</p>

		<p>They are not looking for a &ldquo;raceless&rdquo; society, they simply want to benefit minorities. The only ones speaking of a &ldquo;raceless&rdquo; society are white elites.</p>
<p><br>
Do Euro-American children have a right to Euro-American teachers? I certainly would not want a non-European American teaching my children (which I plan to have plenty of). How will they be able to relate with them on European history, Colonialism, or race relations? <br>

		<p> The NAACP and the black community itself, by extension, are like a spoiled child: It&rsquo;s all about &#8220;me, me, ME!&#8221; If this reporter had wanted to really do a thorough and unbiased job, she would have contacted a school administrator after the meeting, and asked if there was a particular reason for so few black teachers   &mdash;   such as, &#8220;It&rsquo;s so hard to find any that are qualified!&#8221;   &mdash;   which is true. Too much of the story was taken up with the piling on of claims, and veiled threats, by the NAACP people in attendance.</p>
<p> As I&rsquo;ve said before on this website, and probably will again, this constant meddling and causing trouble by the NAACP could be crimped, or maybe halted altogether, if some organizations would start filing lawsuits against THEM! Good lawyers can always find a good excuse to sue. Maybe American Third Position and Keystone United should get the ball rolling.</p>

<p>By the logic of the civil rights movement, all children do. Except for white children, they need absolutely as many teachers of color as possible, to aid in &#8216;understanding&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>NAACP gets it right. Blacks can have Black Teachers, they can<br>
be taught Black Studies, including Black versions of history<br>
and, indeed, Black Mathematics. What they cannot do is<br>
force whites to attend their schools or force their version of<br>
education on anyone else. Finally whites are under no obligation<br>
to pay for any of this. Blacks will be free of white oppression<br>
and whites will be free of having to hear the endless complaints<br>
and excuses. Free at last, Free at last.</p>

		<p>Strangely the Chinese kids in my high school learned just fine even though none of the teachers looked like them.  I guess this is just a deficiency of black people that they can&rsquo;t learn from melanin challenged teachers.  I&rsquo;m shocked that the NAACP holds such racist views.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s good to see the term &#8216;White Nationalist&rsquo; in print in the mainstream media!  Usually they just use some false slur.  Hopefully this is a sign of slow progress on our part!!</p>
<p>Blacks are not very logical, have they though that the corollary to what they propose (White teachers for White students) is now on the table as well?  Are most low IQ Blacks even aware what the word &#8216;corollary&rsquo; means?  </p>

		<p>The NAACP is more like a loose organizations of clowns. Both incompetent and blindly racist, why anyone takes the NAACP seriously remains a mystery. It&rsquo;s as if 8 year olds are in charge.</p>
<p>The NAACP has no strategy - it changes its idea with the direction of the wind. If it had any brains or organization behind it then you wouldn&rsquo;t read about the ongoing nonsense coming out of the group. It is propped up with white, liberal money anyway. </p>
<p>Still, why exactly is it so important to have &#8220;teachers of color&#8221; for the students? The article never makes that clear. </p>
<p>In between the calls for firing (&#8220;The district board needs to be fired and replaced,&#8221; he said) and the arm-twisting (&#8220;forcing the district to expand the duties&hellip;&#8221;) I sense a brewing tantrum. </p>
<p>Terrible black performance in school can only be addressed if there are enough black teachers in place to manipulate the grades of black students. Also, blacks would like to get their hands on the pile of money known as the school budget and have it redistributed to blacks in the form of social aid.</p>
<p>With blacks at 1% of the district&rsquo;s staff I bet the 40% black students are forced to study rather than go on endless field trips or stage &#8220;cultural&#8221; pageants or draw pictures of MLK.</p>
<p>Black students are already way behind the curve - they should thank their lucky stars they have white teachers. Give them black teachers and they are doomed.</p>
<p>Lastly, for all the cries in the past about segregation this sure looks suspicious to me. It only goes to show that blacks and the NAACP have no idea what to do. </p>
<p>Blacks do poorly in school - must be segregation. Blacks still do poorly - must be integration. Blacks still fail - must have black teachers. No enough qualified black teachers - must be racism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 100% for black teachers working only with black students and white teachers only working with white students. In fact, if that&rsquo;s the case, I&rsquo;d support easing the standards for certifying black teachers (for teaching only black students) - that way, they&rsquo;ll be more black teachers. The extra time in some teaching college for blacks is wasted anyway - let them get out there and teach!</p>

<p>Let me get this straight   &mdash;   having teachers that &#8220;look like them&#8221; is diversity? It must be true since this was a &#8220;diversity forum&#8221;. I think there is a double standard hiding in there somewhere. Either way, works for me. Maybe students should have classmates that look like them, too?</p>

		<p>since the vast majority of black us teachers repeatedly fail the certification exam (which is so incredibly dumbed down a smart 6th grader could pass it in his sleep), this means blacks actually WANT their kids taught by illiterate ignoramuses. </p>
<p>if they want blacks to get smarter, they should be demanding QUALIFIED teachers, not fussing about skin tone.</p>
<p>the black power bloc cares nothing for knowledge or learning, they just want lifetime jobs &amp; pensions going to blacks, and seem to have no qualms about being laughably incompetent. </p>

		<p>Great job by our folks in the American Third Position and Regional Coordinator of Keystone United] group. These people are getting out there and speaking up for the legitimate fights of our people in local areas, not wasting their time on hopeless Presidential campaigns by race-less, 80 year old Libertarian, Constitutionalists who never win even 1%.</p>

		<p>I taught black students for two years, and this experience made me realize that I, as a white teacher, should be teaching white students so that the black students can have a black teacher who will inspire them.  </p>
<p>The black students, despite my best efforts, couldn&rsquo;t stop acting like fools on steroids.  ALL the boys were obsessed with sex and constantly touched the black girls, all the while shucking and jiving.  ALL the girls were LOOUUDD and always got headaches when asked to remember any fact at all. </p>
<p>So let the district assign me to a school with few blacks and send all the black teachers to the black majority schools.</p>
<p>Oh snap!  When that even appears to be the case, black teachers cry racism and ask why they get sent to the &#8216;struggling&rsquo; schools.</p>
<p>There is no way to win here, folks.  They demand capitulation, and then they still don&rsquo;t get any better.</p>

		<p>Ironically, about 500 miles to the south of Wilkes-Barre, PA, the NAACP wants to sue to prevent black children in Raleigh and Wake County, NC, from having the black teachers they say they need.</p>

		<p>I have been going to this area of PA for years, and lived nearby for a couple of years also. It is an old ex coal area settled by a majority of Poles &amp; other European descent. The NAACP working with a church began moving single black women (with kids) from Philly into section 8 housing around 20 years ago into the Wilkes-Barre area. Soon the thug fathers followed, then drugs, prostitutes, beatings,etc.. you get the idea. All in the name of diversity. Remove them from Philly &amp; put them in a more genteel environment, multicult is good, blah - blah&hellip;<br>
Whats happened? White flight to surrounding small towns or boroughs! The town is a mess &amp; not safe to walk the streets in many areas. You will not find many educated blacks living in this city qualified to teach. </p>

		<p>I agree totally with the sentiment of the article. Segregation is the only answer. White and Blacks will never be able to live in harmony. It doesn&rsquo;t work anywhere else in the world. We&rsquo;re simply different and vive la diferrence.  There are exceptions but not enough to warrant putting ourselves in jeopardy.<br>
If it eventually comes to a partitioning of the nation, bring it on. We&rsquo;re capable of surviving quite well without them; it fact we more assured of surviving without them.<br>
&#8220;Segregation today, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wow, THAT&rsquo;S really teaching the diversity chant they always fall back on, isn&rsquo;t it?? What the parents are really saying is &#8216;we don&rsquo;t much like people who aren&rsquo;t like us.&rsquo; </p>
<p>I agree. Give them teachers that look like them, and give us students and teachers that look like us. Quit demanding integration in every aspect of WHITES&rsquo; lives. Problem solved.</p>
