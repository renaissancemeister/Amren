			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dana Hughes, ABC News, Oct. 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Kenya&rsquo;s most prominent polygamist has died having married more than 100 women in his lifetime and fathered nearly 200 children. Nicknamed &#8220;Danger&#8221; because women were so attracted by his handsome looks, Ancentus Akuku was in his late 90&rsquo;s when he passed away of natural causes. </p>
<p>Akuku Danger was legendary in Kenya. He married his first wife in 1939 and became polygamist some 70 years ago at the age of 22. He&rsquo;s outlived 12 of his wives, marrying the last one in 1992. There were so many children in his family that Akuku established two elementary schools solely to educate his children, as well as a church for his growing family to attend. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>His death was the number one topic of Kenyan media today. Radio stations featured call-in shows of people, especially men, paying their respects. In many tribes having several wives was a sign of wealth and status for a man. Danger Akuku represented the ultimate symbol of traditional manhood  &mdash;  and of a time when gender relations seemed more simple than today. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While young Kenyans paid their respects to the man with over 100 wives, most said that lifestyle is not possible in today&rsquo;s environment. </p>
<p>&#8220;I had heard of Akuku Danger back in the day when I was a teen, and up to now I still wonder how he did this,&#8221; said Jeff Kilumi, a businessman in Nairobi. &#8220;Right now, even if I had a lot of money, &#8216;Bill Gates&rsquo; rich, I wouldn&rsquo;t even go for a second wife. The more the women, the more the headache and stress.&#8221; </p>
<p>While many Kenyan women had mothers and grandmothers who were part of polygamous households, most urban young women say a life like Akuku&rsquo;s with all his wives living together peacefully would be impossible to achieve today.</p>
<p>&#8220;We all understand that polygamy was allowed back then in some Kenyan communities, but Akuku is something else,&#8221; said Linet Wambui, a Nairobi saleswoman. &#8220;Personally, I would never be married to a man who has another wife let alone a hundred more. Those women were clearly different. Try having an Akuku at this day and age, the women would kill one another.&#8221; </p>
<p>The closest modern-day equivalent may be Swaziland&rsquo;s King Mswati III, who currently has 14 wives and 23 children. South Africa&rsquo;s President Jacob Zuma has been criticized for having married five women and siring over 20 children, which he defends as part of his Zulu culture. </p>

		<p>Blacks are genetically predisposed to polygamy because of the environment they evolved in. That being said, it is not surprising that blacks in both Africa and the USA are more tolerant of polygamy than whites.  The Indo-European have,since the beginning of recorded history, been monogamous.  This was recorded by the Roman historian Tacitus, who noted that the Germans were the only &#8220;barbarians&#8221; who practiced monogamy and even celebacy before marriage.</p>

<p>Hmm&hellip; that&rsquo;s 1.64 children per woman. Akuku&rsquo;s brood was also below replacement level. Now it&rsquo;s true that those women are now all suddenly on the market again and will undoubtedly have more children, but still, it&rsquo;s rather ironic.</p>

		<p>His name, Akuku, seems quite apt as Cuckoos are known for laying eggs in non-Cuckoo nests. Upon hatching the Cuckoo chicks push the non-Cuckoos out of the nest and consume all the resources once meant for parents&rsquo; own chicks.</p>

		<p>And the African women are probably just as promiscous.  </p>
<p>With this rich cultural tradition of multiple sexual partners and endless over-population I am surprised that Africa is not constantly in the throes of poverty, wars, disease, starvation, cannibalism, chaos and crime.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s because they are so diverse.</p>

		<p>This is a disgusting story.  Some blacks are worse than animals.  There are steadily more blacks from other countries let in to this country.  Don&rsquo;t we have enough problems with the blacks already here?</p>

		<p>Ken: It depends on what you mean by &#8220;monogamous&#8221;. The Romans had the idea of concubinage, which allowed married men to have multiple, legally recognised sexual partners (though the concubines were not allowed to reside with the husband). The advent of Christianity that brought polygamy to an end in Europe (though the Mormons are still fervent admirers of the practice).</p>

Milleniums before polygamy it was common for Africans to have 20 offspring or more.<br>
Africa&rsquo;s history of primitive tribalism and random violence produced a situation in which sexual desire surrendered to natural law.<br>
Rather than building customs of celebacy like Europe, and Asia, Africans built their customs around the procreative act as a symbol of productivity since abstinence was elusive to set forth as a custom of principle.</p>

		<p>Well if this isn&rsquo;t &#8220;R-strategy&#8221; at work then I don&rsquo;t know what is!Massive amounts of offspring fathered by this 1 black male by numerous females and he doesn&rsquo;t support anyone of them(despite bleatings to the contrary-apparent his harem supports him)-who knows maybe 1 of his sons might go to USA (on a scholarship no less!!!) and father the next US president &hellip;.sad really.</p>

		<p>Another candidate for multiple wives is the king of Morocco.  He has several wives but more concubines than wives as I understand it.  He is supposedly a direct descendant of Mohammid.</p>

He looks like any accused rapist or murdering gang banger that you&rsquo;d see in an arrest mug shot. I guess that&rsquo;s all African women have to choose from. If he were here he&rsquo;s probably have a bevy of White women at his beck and call (so to speak).</p>

		<p>This is yet another residual example of the advanced black African civilizations, characterized by powered flight, great medical advances, space travel, and great cities, that existed before the White Man arrived in Africa and destroyed it all.</p>

		<p>No mention of employment, income stream or means to support 200 children.  He probably lived off his wives and never had a job.  But that doesn&rsquo;t make him less of a man in Africa!  </p>

		<p>Ken wrote that &#8220;the Indo-Europeans, since the begining of recorded history have been monogamous&#8221;.</p>
<p>Ante-islam Iranians, and Hindus have not been monogamous, and they are, linguistically speaking, Indo-Europeans. Indeed, many (or most ?)&#8221;Barbarians&#8221; that Tacitus had heard about were Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>Monogamy is immemorial in Europe, it seems to me (I&rsquo;ve never read precisely on that) that Europe is the only place where monogamy is immemorial. Maybe it&rsquo;s an ante-Indo-European feature ?  Maybe it traces back to the times anterior to Neolithic ?  Maybe it was characteristic of the European hunter-gatherers ? Maybe it traces back to cooperative big game hunting, maybe it is linked with a society where foraging was a relatively secondary resource ? <br>
 <br>
Of course, all that is very tentative, but there is an extreme inertia of this kind of phenomenons. </p>
