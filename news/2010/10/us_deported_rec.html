			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brian Bennett, Los Angeles Times, October 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Obama administration deported a record number of illegal immigrants in the 2010 fiscal year, according to figures released Wednesday by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>
<p>Of the 392,862 deportations from October 2009 through September of this year, about half were illegal immigrants with criminal records. The total was about 3,000 more deportations than the record set in the previous year.</p>
<p>The second straight year of record deportations from the U.S. reflects the approach of ICE under the Obama administration to focus its efforts on removing criminal illegal immigrants &#8220;who pose a national security or public safety threat,&#8221; Homeland Security Deputy Press Secretary Matt Chandler said in a statement.</p>
<p>More than 195,000 criminals were deported in 2010, a 70% increase over 2008 in the forced removal of immigrant criminals. Officials credited the increase to programs such as Secure Communities, which focuses law enforcement resources on identifying illegal immigrants who have committed crimes and are being held in local and state jails.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The administration also has weathered criticism from liberals and conservatives over its deportation policy. Immigration reform advocates say President Obama has reneged on a campaign promise to overhaul the government&rsquo;s immigration policy and instead has favored increased enforcement.</p>
<p>Critics on the right say ICE is selectively enforcing the immigration laws by focusing on criminals. When the ICE employees union announced a vote of no confidence in Morton&rsquo;s leadership in June, it cited the agency&rsquo;s focus on immigrant criminals.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still unresolved is what to do about the millions of illegal immigrants living in the U.S.</p>

		<p>Self-Deportation would be the best answer. Cut off employment, benefits (except emergency care and basic human rights) and deport illegals who break the law. It is great that deportations are up, but we still have millions of people here illegally.  </p>

		<p>It is not stressed that at least 50 % of those deported involved individuals that had a CRIMINAL RECORD.</p>
<p>At least that number and probably higher. And that is only a small portion of the illegals in the country presently. What must the rest be like?</p>

		<p>A great many aliens who attempt to enter the country illegally are stopped at the border. In these cases, they are simply turned away and go back to Mexico, a procedure that the agency historically has called &ldquo;voluntary returns.&rdquo;  Many of these people will attempt to reenter later the same day or the following day.  Each time they are stopped by the Border Patrol, it is counted as a voluntary return. </p>
<p>Big Sis has ordered ICE to change the way voluntary returns are reported.  They are no longer counted as returns, but instead they are now being counted as &ldquo;deportations.&rdquo;   The purpose is to boost the regime&rsquo;s deportation numbers, in order to give the utterly false impression that the regime is effectively protecting the border, when in fact nothing could be further from the truth.</p>

		<p>There is reason to be skeptical of the deportation numbers.</p>
<p>A president who, during the 2008 campaign, bragged on Spanish-language TV station, Univision, that: &#8220;Nobody in the Senate, other than maybe Ted Kennedy, has been more consistent in saying we need to have a pathway to citizenship for those who are undocumented, already here &hellip;&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t suddenly get interested in enforcing immigration laws. </p>
<p>Dan Stein of the Federation for American Immigration Reform:</p>
<p>&#8220;The conflation of some? all? voluntary departures with actual deportations by the Obama administration is nothing more than an attempt to create the impression that real enforcement is occurring &hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>Why inflate the numbers? There is no way the Dems will get amnesty without some enforcement numbers, cooked or not.</p>

		<p>The BP says that for every one they catch as many as two more get away.  If they catch half a million a year, that means that as many as a million more get thru.</p>
<p>400K is thus bailing the ocean with a teaspoon as we aren&rsquo;t even keeping up with the flood while the government sit there in the seat of a bulldozer and _refuse_ to use it to build some serious dykes against the inundation.</p>
<p>Two fences.  Mines in between.  On the &#8216;sensitive&rsquo; (read not so far from civilization as to be nearly impassable in the terrain and heat) areas of borderr that run about 250 miles along the AZ/TX border area.</p>
<p>And we would have immigration more like what used to require balloon trips to bypass between the two Germany&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry but it has frankly come to that.  Because while a murderer or a rapist or a drunken hit and run driver may have crippled an individual (and I am completely in sympathy with that), THE CRIME of forcing this nation to it&rsquo;s knees in transfer payments to those we DO NOT want to associate with and WILL NOT assimilate with (no breeding = no melting pot) amounts to hundreds of billions of dollars of penalties levied against all of us.</p>
<p>And Obama, a &#8216;community organizer&rsquo; himself, knows this.  And still _will not do his job_ in enforcing the border security of this nation.  Preferring to act like a spoiled little child holding out behind a locked bathroom door for a go-to-bed treat as negotiating leverage, post November.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t politics.  It&rsquo;s national security.  If our resident CMIC (Chief Moron In Charge, a PC version of the older CNIC) cannot see this, then it&rsquo;s time he saw the inside of a jail cell to remind him what ILLEGALITY really looks like.</p>
<p>Fiduciary Responsibility.  Treason.  20 years to life.  Don&rsquo;tcha know.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a silver lining in Bush&rsquo;s disastrous Presidency. He exported 20 million middle-class jobs, bankrupted the U.S., destroyed half of our manufacturing base, and put us in a Depression. I say 3 cheers for G.W.Bush. He&rsquo;s the savior WNs have been waiting for. Because of him, we see the rise of the Tea Party and other patriot movements. WN is everywhere and not a moment too soon. The worse is better philosophy is paying off in spades. If we had great economic times right now, there wouldn&rsquo;t be so much noise coming from Americans about illegals and other injustices going on. The masses are starting to awake, finally. Everyone I know is talking about these problems. Let the games begin!</p>

		<p>I think the number of deportations are up because the Obama Admin. wants to have a record of being &#8220;tough on illegals&#8221; to give themselves credibility going into the debate over the Obama Amnesty, I mean, &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform.&#8221;</p>
<p>After all, the deal they&rsquo;re proposing is that in exchange for amnesty, now for real this time the Fed Govt is going to get serious about keeping out the next wave of illegals. AmRen readers know better than to believe them, but by having a couple of years of record deportation stats, I think they hope to persuade the public that they mean business this time.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see, once the Obama Amnesty is dead and buried (which I think is almost a sure thing at this point), whether the Obama admin will keep up even this paltry level of effort, or, perhaps as some sort of concession to the National Council of La Raza, they&rsquo;ll give up the charade and go back to minimal enforcement levels.</p>

		<p>It is my understanding that Mexicans are now leaving for a return to Southern Mexico in greater numbers than are going to Northern Mexico [i.e. Arizona, New Mexico, California, Texas etc.].Once we start getting into the depression for real there will be no more money to fund governmental social services. That may eventually even apply to transplanted Africans. </p>
<p>The simple fact is this: the current President along with the totally inept crooks he has on his team: Uncle Ben, Timid Timothy, Lying Larry, have not been right on the economy once in the last thirty years. This next quantitative easing QE2 which will be more pumping of computerized non existent fake money into the economy to keep the Democrats in power [not that it matters since both parties are exactly alike] will begin to wear off by January.</p>
<p>In March of 2011 all hell will then begin to hit with all of the teaser rate mortgages being readjusted upward so there will have to be QE3 to handle that problem. By March of next year gold will be over $ 2,000. an ounce. The REAL unemployment then will be over twenty five per cent. </p>
<p>There is a saying my grandmother used to tell me when I bitched about cleaning the kitchen at night.&#8221;If you leave food out at night expect unwanted guests in the morning.&#8221; We fund illegals. through social services and work.  Petronius is correct. The deportation show if a joke. I&rsquo;ve personally seen Mexicans along the Gulf Coast be deported and after spending a couple of weeks in Oakdale Mississippi before being taken back to Mexico they are back at work here with a different name in less than a month. If Obama really wanted to stop the illegals he would severely fine the businesses that hire them. IF he were to pursue the businesses with the passion that he ALLEGEDLY  does with this fake deportation scheme they would not come.</p>
<p>Want to stop illegal immigration? Fine. But be prepared for driving a lot of American businesses out of business. These businesses survive by paying low labor costs without insurance. Many of the jobs done by illegals most whites don&rsquo;t want to do [but will if desperate] compared to Blacks who won&rsquo;t do the jobs since their energy must be conserved to make more blacks, play games, dance and sing, sell drugs, and live off of the government [i.e. us].   </p>
<p>Finally a word about all of the politically correct diversity garbage constantly being water boarded down our throats to the effect that we somehow benefit greatly by a racial and cultural intermarriage. Catch the clip that Mr. Taylor had with Phil Donnahue about how great HE thought diversity enrichment was - every time I watch him on that clip it makes me want to put my fist though my computer screen!  </p>
<p>That argument assumes that everyone brings to the table an equal amount of assets that the others at the table do not already have AND that the others at the table would benefit by partaking of these assets whether they would want to or not. THAT IS NOT THE CASE!</p>

		<p>Only 400,000?  That&rsquo;s a drop in the bucket compared to how many are in the US at this very moment.  And how many have managed to re-enter our country, or will try to in the near future?  </p>
<p>This is nothing compared to the numbers that have made their way in and are continuing to do so.  The government is simply throwing anti-immigration activists a bone and pretending that this administration is serious (cough) about deportation. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t believe any statistics coming out of the federal government. They&rsquo;re lying about the number of deportations just like they&rsquo;re lying about inflation and progress in Afghanistan. I don&rsquo;t even need to know the details. If the numbers are coming from the feds, then they&rsquo;re bogus. You can count on it.</p>

Absconders from Deportation Orders surge on Obama&rsquo;s Watch</p>
<p><br>
The outrageously dishonest DHS spin on the deportation statistics James Fulford attacked yesterday also provoked an incisive analysis from our friend Federale: Obama Regime Fails To Meet Goal</p>
<p>&hellip;despite the fact that ICE&rsquo;s budget has increased dramatically&hellip;they were only able to increase deportations from the last Fiscal Year of the Bush Administration, 2009, by 3,862 illegal aliens.</p>
<p>Observing, along with Ed Rubenstein</p>
<p>The real reason that there was an increase in deportations was the Secure Communities program that was instituted under the Bush Administration and resisted by the Obama Regime.</p>
<p>Federale adds an important point: in one year of the Obama administration, the number of &ldquo;fugitive aliens&rdquo; – people who are evading a court-issued deportation order – has leapt 28.1% or 157,000 to 715,000.</p>

Deportation Figures: VDARE.com Didn&rsquo;t Wait For The Press Release</p>
<p><br>
The New York Times has a story on an announcement from Janet Napolitano that deportations are up.</p>
<p>Deportations From U.S. Hit a Record High,</p>
<p>By Julia Preston, October 6, 2010<br>
Immigration authorities deported a record 392,862 immigrants over the last year, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said Wednesday.</p>
<p>About half of those deported  &mdash;  195,772  &mdash;  were convicted criminals, also a record, Ms. Napolitano said, and an increase of more than 81,000 deportations of criminals over the final year of George W. Bush&rsquo;s presidency. [More]</p>
<p>Of course, the New York Times only covers this when either the Government makes an announcement, or a Treason Lobby group complains. Here at VDARE.com we watch this all the time, with Ed Rubenstein analyzing the figures–see National Data: Deportations Decreasing, NOT Increasing, Under Obama, August 9, 2010.</p>
<p>FAIR and NumbersUSA are protesting the report, partly because of the emphasis on the &ldquo;criminals&rdquo; being deported, whereas many, many, illegals are remaining in place stealing jobs and tax dollars.</p>
<p>Ed Rubenstein wrote in August that</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reality check: most of the rise in criminal deportations is attributable to the &ldquo;Secure Communities&rdquo; program, a Bush initiative inherited by Mr. Obama. While ICE takes full credit for expanding the program, the real impetus comes from state and local governments. They are sick and tired of footing the bill for holding illegal aliens in their lock ups.</p>
<p>But &ldquo;Non-criminal&rdquo; deportations fell to 142,100 in the first nine months of FY2010, from 188,000 in the same period last year &mdash; a 24% decline. This category includes illegals busted in workplace raids or identified by those employer audits that ICE claims are a more effective way to enforce immigration laws in the workplace.</p>
<p>Even in the Great Depression, there are far more illegal aliens working than in jail in the U.S. It is scandalous that their deportations are declining while American unemployment remains at such historic highs.&ldquo;</p>
<p>Speaking of &ldquo;historic highs,&rdquo; one reason this administration has deported more people in absolute numbers is that there is a larger population than ever before:307,006,550 estimated in the US, and a large illegal alien populations than ever before. 12 million? 20 million? Who knows for sure? But if it&rsquo;s 20 million, the Obama administration has deported less than 2 percent of them, and they don&rsquo;t even want to deport the rest.</p>

<p>GG:</p>
<p>I respectfully disagree.  While it has historically been the case that deportations with a porous border are basically a form of spitting in the wind, I think that in this economy people aren&rsquo;t willing to risk the trip back up to &#8220;El Norte&#8221;.  Yeah, they can exploit social services, but without jobs, life is tougher.  Add this 400k to those who are self-deporting already as jobs diminish and populist hostility toward illegals increase.  I think this is very, very good news.</p>

		<p>400,000 is only about 2% of the total.  It&rsquo;s a start, but not much of one.  To get deported an illegal alien pretty much has to commit a triple shotgun murder.  So I&rsquo;m not impressed with the amount of enforcement so far.</p>
