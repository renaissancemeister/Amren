<h1><a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20101029/D9J59RUG0.html">Arizona Beheading Raises Fears of Drug Violence</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amanda Lee Myers, My Way, October 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The gruesome case of a man who was stabbed and beheaded in a suburban Phoenix apartment has police investigating whether the killing is potentially the most extreme example of Mexican drug cartel violence spilling over the border.</p>
<p>Martin Alejandro Cota-Monroy&rsquo;s body was found Oct. 10 in a Chandler apartment  &mdash;  his severed head a couple feet away. One man suspected in the killing has been arrested, and a manhunt is under way for three others.</p>
<p>Detectives are focused on whether the men belong to a Mexican drug cartel, and they suspect that Cota-Monroy&rsquo;s killing was punishment for stealing drugs. The brutal nature of the killing could be designed to send a message to others within the cartel.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Decapitations are a regular part of the drug war in Mexico as cartels fight over territory. Headless bodies have been hanged from bridges by their feet, severed heads have been sent to victims&rsquo; family members and government officials, and bags of up to 12 heads have been dropped off in high-profile locations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If the suspects in the Arizona case belong to a cartel, the crime could be the only known beheading in the U.S. carried out by a drug cartel, said Tony Payan, a political science professor at the University of Texas at El Paso who has done extensive research about border violence.</p>
<p>The killing could also affect the immigration debate in Arizona. Supporters of the state&rsquo;s controversial immigration law frequently cite this type of violence as reason to crack down on illegal immigrants. The decapitation victim and the suspects were all illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The killing has unnerved residents in the neighborhood and apartment complex where Cota-Monroy was killed.</p>
<p>The tiny, run-down complex sits along a side street across from ramshackle trailer homes in a neighborhood not far from brand-new strip malls with big-box stores in the suburb of Chandler.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Moroyoqui was arrested and charged with second-degree murder and hindering prosecution. He pleaded not guilty on Wednesday and has refused to speak to police. He declined to speak with The Associated Press.</p>
<p>The other suspects have been identified as Jose David Castro Reyes, 25; Isai Aguilar Morales, 22, and a man between the ages of 20 and 27 only known by the nickname &#8220;El Joto,&#8221; a derogatory Spanish term for a gay man.</p>
<p>They are believed to have fled to Mexico, making it very difficult to locate them.</p>

		<p>&#8220;state&rsquo;s controversial immigration law&#8221;</p>
<p>pretty much the only thing of worth or note in the article.</p>
<p>That term &#8220;controversial&#8221; is tacked on by the media, over and over and over again.  Why?  Because it is not, in fact, controversial.  There is 100% consensus among Americans that we want the mestizos gone, by any means necessary.  I mean that last part.  We are close to war with mexico.  There are tons of murders, kidnappings, drugs, slaves, rapes, ethnic cleansing, etc. happening in the US, done by the mestizos.  The truth is, we are already at war.  And that war is escalating.</p>
<p>The media and the government have been covering it up.  But that won&rsquo;t be possible for very much longer.</p>
<p>Understand the implications of that.  The person who wrote this article.  Who used that term, even though its use is so forced that stands out as being odd to the average reader.  That writer KNOWS what I just said.  He is aiding and abetting it.</p>
<p>What should be done about that.</p>

		<p>Whether it&rsquo;s car bombings, beheadings or ambush killings against the federales, more and more these incidents point up the very real  liklihood that the cartels are working with elements of Al Queda, as has been suspected by the US CIA and Military Intelligence.</p>
<p>This is some of the worst news this country could receive right now, since it is militarily stretched so thin in the world, as it continues to economically spiral downward.</p>
<p>In addition to the possible threat of jihadists, consider that there have been 28,000 killings in Mexico since 2006, which is  far greater than any of the wars the US is now engaged in.  It&rsquo;s comparable to Iraq during some of the worst fighting, depending on which body count figures are used as a comparison.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering if the jihadists aligned with the cartels will soon be in a position to commit terrorists acts in this country, then return back to Mexico to be given safe haven by the drug gangs.  That would be a devastating development for this present administration.  </p>
<p>But even if that situation never occurs, the drug gang violence is creeping northward and could well amount to about the same thing as far as deaths and violence are concerned.</p>
<p>Add all that to the possibility of domestic upheaval against this present administration&rsquo;s efforts to drive us to bankruptcy, and we&rsquo;re probably as close to destruction as we&rsquo;ve ever been in our history.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll be shocked if it is ever disclosed to the public that this beheading was a drug cartel message.  Our government is intent on keeping us in the dark regarding all aspects of Mexico and Mexicans.</p>
<p>It appears the Mexicans have a lot in common with the Muslims.<br>

		<p>Ranger #2, you acknowledge a very important point. The fact is, as you say, Al Quaeda and other terrorist organizations HAVE infiltrated the Mexican drug trade and are well on the way to taking it over. There are brilliant - albeit demented - minds controlling Islamic terrorism. They learned many years ago the volume of greedy Americans&rsquo; use of illegal drugs, the huge cash potential and the ease with which Mexicans have invaded the U.S. to ply their wares here. If Americans could be rallied against the terrorist involvement using Mexico and Mexicans, it would change the entire country&rsquo;s attitude about illegal immigration.</p>
<p>The Big O, along with his corporate and foreign cronies don&rsquo;t want that. Our government wants desperately to keep Americans from realizing that connection because not only is it fashionable to &#8216;be against&rsquo; terrorism, wherever it comes from and in whatever form - even if it were Mexicans. Also, the desire to stop terrorism tends to bypass much of the racial brouhaha - it is commonly accepted that most terrorists are not white nor American. Attaching a terrorism connection to Mexico would would be very bad news for the pro-immigrant groups, including our Traitor In Chief.</p>

		<p>The problem here is that drug enforcement is a joke. Marijuana and cocaine are routinely shipped into this country over the border with drug dogs walking on top of it and not alerting.</p>
<p>I personally don&rsquo;t care if one Mexican dies or one million! If they knowingly become involved in the illegal drug trade death is a risk they assume.</p>
<p>The problem here is the drug market and the drug market is the only thing that we can control! One way of course is the legalization of illegal drugs. </p>
<p>We have been brain washed into thinking that making illegal drugs legal will be the ruination of this country! Maybe so. But we can&rsquo;t enforce drug laws as they now exist and we sure as hell can&rsquo;t protect people from themselves. Eventually all drugs will become legal. It is just a matter of time. I may not live to see it but some of the people here will. Furthermore, nicotine and alcohol are drugs! More people die from these two &#8220;legal&#8221; drugs in the U.S. every year than all of the illegal drugs combined! Tell me in the last ten years how many people have died from the abuse of anabolic steroids? Maybe a hundred. Last year how many people in the U.S. died from lung cancer as a direct result from smoking? 300,000? Get it? It&rsquo;s insane!</p>
<p>If you want to control the &#8220;Mexican Problem&#8221; there is only one way and that is to cut out the profit. Penalize Americans heavily who hire illegal Mexicans [or as far as I&rsquo;m concerned Mexicans period]. Make illegal drugs legal and inexpensive. Advertise constantly about drug addiction but lets be realistic - Marijuana,Ecstasy, GBL, or Zanex bars are NOT in the same ballpark as Cocaine, Meth, or Afghan Heroin! Kids today hate a lot of disingenuous nonsense.</p>
<p>Cutting a person&rsquo;s head off is no big deal- none of us will be getting out of here alive anyway. Dead is dead! It&rsquo;s the Russian Mafia and the terrorists who tend to like to play games before they kill you that I have a problem with! </p>

<p>The message they seem to be sending is &#8220;We like to cut off people&rsquo;s heads&#8221;.  This should perhaps not be unexpected from a people whose public ceremonies included ripping the beating hearts out of people&rsquo;s chests - by the scores or even hundreds at a time.</p>
<p>Sounds like a good reason to keep mexicans the hell out of our country.</p>

		<p>What does it take for the guv&rsquo;m&rsquo;t of THIS country to &#8220;get&#8221; that we need to train a bunch of Marines for guerilla &#8220;search and destroy&#8221;, and then let them invade Mexico and do their job?  The only thing the Mexican drug cartels respect is violence, especially killing; in this respect they are exactly the same as the Muslim jihadists.  So if we&rsquo;ve invaded Pakistan and Afghanistan, why not give our Marines some target practice nearer to home???  Then, of course, we&rsquo;d have to eliminate the oligarchy that currently controls Mexico, and set up a quasi-socialistic government; Mexico is far too backward for a real democracy.  But these are our next door neighbors, and if we don&rsquo;t stop them now, it&rsquo;s going to be OUR innocent citizens who get beheaded next.  IT WILL NOT STOP until WE stop it.</p>

		<p><i>If you want to control the &ldquo;Mexican Problem&rdquo; there is only one way and that is to cut out the profit</i></p>
<p>No the only way to control the &ldquo;Mexican Problem&rdquo; is for whites to become more racially aware.</p>
<p>There will always be some sneaky, underhanded way to profit from drug dealing, whether by tax evasion or killing off one&rsquo;s competitors.</p>
<p>Besides, we didn&rsquo;t seem to have this huge drug problem before, say, 1960. I wonder what the connection could be?</p>
<p>This &#8220;drug legalization&#8221; debate is just another diversion from the real issue: race.</p>

&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>See, now that makes no sense to me.</p>
<p>Mexico has a huge &#8216;color continuum&rsquo; issue where being a little lighter can make your life or end it, depending on where you&rsquo;re at in the country and how much they resent you for it (I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if half the killings of political targets were not in fact racism as envy with an easy attachable excuse of &#8216;Be aware, if we can get him, we can get anyone&hellip;&rsquo;).</p>
<p>Yet Mexico itself is -exceptionally- Nationalist when it comes to both allowing in and working for, foreign parties.  Their whole machismo thing is tied up in it.  If a SWA source party were to ever to be exposed as a &#8220;This is who you really work for&hellip;&#8221; traceable connection to their local drug trade, the cartel that sold out would never live it down, literally.</p>
<p>While the Federales would face the threat of U.S. intervention at a level that made Panama and Grenada both together look like National Guard exercises.</p>
<p>What I am worried about is the exact opposite.  The NAU is, at present, dead.  We are so deep in the hole, I find it amazing to think that -anyone- would want to partner up with us.</p>
<p>But what if this is a way to push us into Mexico for so called legitimate reasons?  What if this is building towards a Pancho Villa type &#8216;external&rsquo; (see South African armed forces running across the border against ANC and other insurgent militias in neighbor states) confrontation that just gets bigger and bigger?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s designed to?</p>
<p>We roll up Mexico and the immigration issue becomes moot.  We won&rsquo;t be hip deep in 20 million Mestizos, it&rsquo;ll be 106,380,000 (2008) of them.</p>
<p>Whoever is behind it, I just hope that, if this does go the way I think it might (look for massive terrorist incidents to run in strings of escalating violence along the border and then pop up deeper into the heartland) we manage to convince ourselves that &#8216;winning&rsquo; this wombat hunt means ending the threat of UBL in a very public and Pakistani humiliative fashion.  Rather than relighting the fire under GWOT/GSAVE, south of the border.</p>
<p>The Romans knew that armies are useless if they don&rsquo;t justify their existence with tribute and tax base.  And we don&rsquo;t have the men or the money to be getting into this at any bigger a level than we did down in Columbia, back in the 80s, with Escobar.</p>
<p>Nor should we have to, with the kinds of technology we have now.</p>
<p>But the best defense remains a good offense and we are not pushing an American COMINT/IMINT/hard target interdiction role hard enough, IMO.</p>

		<p>obama is obviously too afraid and politically correct to mobilize on the border, so Al Queda can and will walk in through the South OR the North. I hope the next president has the guts to mobilize the National Guard AND ARMY on the borders, to ENSURE they become and remain SAFE for all. Americans shouldn&rsquo;t have to stay away from borders, for fear of third world terrorism, but this is our current situation, America. we need to make something happen, since this gov has left us high and dry.</p>

		<p>One wonders how much farther this has to go before the US does anything about it.  With beheadings already making an appearance here, the deliberate targetting of reporters and judges and car-bombings of police stations can not be very far behind.  As much freaking out as the feds did over the Oklahoma City bombing, are they going to give Mexican narcos a free pass on that sort of behavior just because alien Mestizo criminals are a politically-approved group?</p>
