			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bruce Bower, Science News, November 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Attackers with a deadly plan climbed a knoll to a Pueblo village called Sacred Ridge around 1,200 years ago. What happened next was anything but sacred.</p>
<p>At least 35 people, roughly half of those living in the village, were brutalized, killed and sliced into thousands of small pieces. Fellow Pueblo from nearby villages battered victims&rsquo; feet hard enough to break toes and fracture heels. Blows delivered with blunt weapons crushed the faces and heads of men, women and children. Scalps, and possibly eyes and ears, were removed, perhaps as trophies.</p>
<p>Wielders of sharp stone implements chopped up victims&rsquo; bodies in at least four Sacred Ridge structures. Attackers removed the roof of a large house and threw in heaps of human body parts, some of which had been fished from burning hearths. Several village dogs met the same fate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After leading an analysis of Sacred Ridge&rsquo;s mutilated mass of bones, bioarchaeologist Ann Stodder of the Field Museum in Chicago has a controversial answer: genocide. An ethnically distinct Pueblo clan living at Sacred Ridge maintained tenuous authority over at least two other ethnic groups inhabiting Ridges Basin, Stodder contends. Dire food shortages and anger toward better-provisioned Sacred Ridge elites motivated a raid aimed at destroying an entire lineage and its collective identity, she proposed in April in Albuquerque at a meeting of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Potter [James Potter, the archaeologist who directed the excavations that uncovered this murder at Sacred Ridge], of SWCA Environmental Consultants&rsquo; branch in Broomfield, Colo., calls what happened at Sacred Ridge a one-off outburst of &#8220;ethnocide,&#8221; not a village-to-village genocidal campaign. Some researchers suspect that attackers attributed misfortunes in home communities to witchcraft practiced at Sacred Ridge; physically obliterating victims would drive evil spirits out and make bodies useless to malevolent forces. Others contend that the intentions of those who attacked Sacred Ridge are difficult to divine from piles of smashed bones.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Melting pot meltdown</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Similarly, early Pueblo sites elsewhere in the Four Corners region have revealed a few incidents of killing and possible cannibalism mainly involving just handfuls of people. And a cave in southeastern Utah yielded bones from at least 61 pre-Pueblo individuals who were beaten, mutilated and stabbed around 1,500 years ago, but the predominance of adult males among those victims suggests a warfare-related attack.</p>
<p>Though violent raids on Pueblo sites increased in size and frequency from 900 to 1300 (SN: 9/9/00, p. 164), with victims including men, women and children, Sacred Ridge was built during a relatively calm period and therefore seemed an unlikely venue for violence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Digs led by Potter in two Sacred Ridge pit houses in 2003 and 2004 uncovered clusters of broken and burned human bones. Chemical analyses identified blood residue on an ax, a jar and other artifacts found near the remains. The next year, thousands more pieces of bone turned up in another pit house that showed signs of having had its roof removed. Potter&rsquo;s team recovered a total of 14,882 human bone fragments from people of all ages.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Distinctive house styles, pottery designs, burial practices, tooth shapes and skull features demarcate at least three ethnic groups in the basin at that time, including one at Sacred Ridge, according to Potter.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Increasingly cold and dry weather, dwindling game herds and crop yields, and surpluses of stored deer and elk meat confined to Sacred Ridge inflamed ethnic tensions, Potter posits. The regional melting pot boiled over when members of one group eliminated the Sacred Ridge clan in a ferocious attack, he suggests.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Chacon [anthropologist Richard Chacon of Winthrop University] says, research at Sacred Ridge counters claims by some scholars that prehistoric Pueblo people never fought, instead living in harmony with nature and each other. &#8220;That stereotype robs Native American peoples of their humanity,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Every group I&rsquo;ve worked with has a long history of violent conflicts.&#8221;</p>

		<p><i>&ldquo;This extreme level of violence came as a complete surprise,&rdquo; says archaeologist James Potter, who directed the excavations that uncovered this murder at Sacred Ridge. &ldquo;I was blown away from the start at how many human remains we were finding.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>The only reason this is a complete surprise is because these archaeologists have a preconceived notion as to the behavior of Native Americans.</p>
<p>The noble, peaceful savage is a PC myth.</p>
<p>So is the notion the Native Americans killed only what they needed and used every part of an animal. Some tribes used to drive buffalo over cliffs killing far more than they needed or could use.</p>

<p>Congratulations Richard! You are catching on really fast.</p>
<p>They analyzed a number of these Pueblo dwellings from way back when, including those of the &#8220;Ancient One&#8221;, and found they had interlocking views, lines of sight and were able to communicate using fire and smoke. And situated in a manner for superb defense and making the task of the attacker very difficult. Also in an arid place making preparations for the storage of water in case of prolonged siege.</p>
<p>NO, the American Indian was not some sort of placid hunter gatherer living in peace with one another and in total harmony with nature. They were like all other folks found anywhere else in the world. </p>

		<p>There is nothing surprising here.  We all know Indian tribes fought with one another long before Columbus (or Leif Erickson) arrived.  We also know that various European tribes have been at war with each other for centuries.  And if you want to read about more war and genocide there&rsquo;s always the Old Testament.  It seems to be pretty much the human condition.  Contemporary Americans, long used to the idea that total war is something that happens someplace else, may yet live to experience this part of the human condition on more intimate terms than they&rsquo;d like.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m glad that another site containing evidence of genocidal massacres carried out by North American aborigines against other North American aborigines has been unearthed. There may be hundreds more such sites all over the country. No wonder many North American aborigines are opposed to such archaeological expeditions - they are afraid that with each site excavated, it will only hammer more nails into the old cannard that primitive peoples lived in peace, friendship and harmony with one another, before Christopher Columbus and his merry band of sea scamps landed in North America. So these North American aborigines( I refuse to refer to them as &#8220;Indians&#8221;, since they are not from the Indian subcontinent) protest, on the grounds that the white man is &#8220;disturbing sacred burial grounds&#8221; of their ancestors.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s garbage. These aborigines do not want the truth to come out. </p>

		<p>Wait wait, I thought liberals were trying to tell us that American Indians WERE peace loving nature folk. Now apparently they fought like the rest of us and saying otherwise &#8220;robs them of their humanity&#8221;. Is that the final line? We&rsquo;ll have to wait and see.</p>

		<p>Notice the great amount of&hellip;&hellip;rationalization, being engaged in by these undoubtedly leftist researchers.</p>
<p>With almost no evidence, they come up with all sorts of likely explanations for the behavior.  So what if, in the real world, such behavior is rarely engaged in for the reasons they cite.</p>
<p>For some reason, it is out of the question that those engaged in such heinous behavior might do it for the simple fact that they were evil.  They enjoyed killing.  Their neighbors got used to living in peace and let their guard down.  And, as what really is shown in history, that results in being attacked by evil people and then being slaughtered.  This is followed almost immediately by the death of those who did it.  Such behavior is anti-life and groups that engage in it cannot hold together civilization for long&hellip;.so it falls apart, killing those who relied on it.  This is the repeating pattern shown by historical and anthropological research.</p>
<p>When good people tolerate evil people, the evil people proliferate and then kill them.  Then the evil people die off because evil in anti-life and anti-civilization.</p>
<p>This is the lesson the white world needs to learn.</p>

<p>Sounds plausible to me, sounds like what goes on in Africa in places like Rwanda or Sudan with unchecked breeding and little arable land, sooner or later people reach for their machete or their AK-47 no matter how many UN aid cookie baskets we send them.</p>
<p>If I recall economics 101 Malthus would call such bloodlettings &#8220;positive  population checks&#8221;, i.e. correcting the population size so that it better fits with what the land can actually support.</p>
<p>Pleasant? No. But necessary, yes.</p>

Here&rsquo;s another little know history of Native American genocide:</p>
<p><i>However, Donohoe tells us, &ldquo;the Iroquois patiently waited till spring, when their entire army of warriors crossed the border and made a savage attack upon the Neuter towns. They completely routed the Neuters, burned their towns, and <b>destroyed the entire nation.</b> Many of the Neuters fled, like their Huron brethren, to the islands or bays of the west or south, to seek a new home among some friendly tribe, whilst many more meekly followed their captors to strengthen their army or replenish their numbers.&rdquo; </i></p>
<p><i>Thus ended the history of a peaceful nation of our own region.</i></p>

In &#8220;The Dawn Warriors,&#8221; Robert Bigelow argued that war has been a major reason for the evolution of the human brain.  He suggests that the more intelligent side in a conflict will have better weapons and strategies.  </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not really an &#8220;old canard&#8221;.  I can&rsquo;t remember just where or when it started, but it was not always so.  (Maybe when Robert Ardrey came out with his theory that early humans were descended from killer apes, a notion which outraged the lefties way back in the 60s, and they did everything to discredit him.) </p>
<p>But I am old enough to remember when history books had stories of Indian massacres, brave white resistance, the kidnapping of white children, etc.  I think that up  to the end of 2nd WW and the years immediately following it, it was still possible to speak/write frankly and realistically about such matters.  Probably by the 60s, the starry-eyed utopians were taking over academia and trying to impose their views of how they would LIKE the world to be, instead of how it really WAS. So we got &#8220;the gentle Tasaday&#8221;, and Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, the Beatles, gurus, peaceniks, and all of that.  But that &#8220;old canard&#8221; was not always so.</p>
<p>It has, however, warped our scientific thinking (and a couple of generations of young people) for the past half a century and, with the  propaganda help of such as the Disney Studios (after the take-over of Michael Eisner)- e.g. Pocahontas - millions have been indoctrinated with the notion of the peaceful, nature-loving native living in harmony with nature and each other - until corrupted by contact with greedy, evil whites and the introduction of capitalism and war. It&rsquo;s simply the Susan Sontag theory: that whites are the cancer of history who have spread misery everywhere we have gone.</p>
<p>Now, perhaps, the truth is finally beginning to come out.  Again.</p>
