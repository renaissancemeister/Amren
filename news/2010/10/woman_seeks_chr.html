<h1><a href="https://www.wnd.com/?pageId=218349">Woman Seeks &#8216;Christian Roommate,&rsquo; State Cites Her for Discrimination</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bob Unruh, WorldNetDaily, October 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A single, 31-year-old woman in Michigan who posted a note on her church bulletin board seeking a &#8220;Christian roommate&#8221; to share her residence has been cited by the state for violating the Fair Housing Act by discriminating against those of other faiths.</p>
<p>The complaint signed by Tyra Khan, a &#8220;Civil Rights Representative&#8221; of the state of Michigan Department of Civil Rights, surfaced when the Alliance Defense Fund announced today it was representing the woman.</p>
<p>ADF spokesman Joel Oster confirmed the organization sent a letter to the state explaining that such housing rules don&rsquo;t apply to people living in their own homes and wanting to share their resources.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>WND contacted the agency&rsquo;s spokesman, Harold Core, who said the case had been determined to be legitimate and the investigation was continuing.</p>
<p>He cited a regulation from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and explained the state of Michigan agrees to enforce federal regulations.</p>
<p>He said section 604C states it is a &#8220;violation to make, print or publish or cause to be made, printed or published any notice, statement or advertisement with respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference&#8221; for a list of nondiscrimination categories, including religious belief.</p>
<p>The complaint specifically alleges the woman&rsquo;s statement, &#8220;I am looking for a Christian roommate,&#8221; prevents people of &#8220;other faiths&#8221; from contacting the woman and making arrangements to share her home with her.</p>
<p>Core declined to respond to questions about the complications that could arise should a full range of nondiscrimination factors, such as race, age and sex, be applied.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Free speech isn&rsquo;t the same as .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a housing opportunity,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Christians shouldn&rsquo;t live in fear of being punished by the government for being Christians. It is completely absurd to try to penalize a single Christian woman for privately seeking a Christian roommate at church  &mdash;  an obviously legal and constitutionally protected activity,&#8221; said Oster, a senior legal counsel with the ADF.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The person who filed the complaint, whose identity was being protected by the state, complained about the &#8220;advertisement which contained the following sentence: &#8216;I am looking for a Christian roommate, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rsquo; The claimant believes the statement expresses an illegal preference for a Christian roommate, thus excluding people of other faiths.&#8221;</p>
<p>The state, which got the complaint from the Fair Housing Center of West Michigan, a private organization, ordered the defendant to provide information about her agent, the names and addresses of her management personnel, a copy of her anti-discrimination policy, addresses of her properties, tenants, witnesses and a copy of the advertisement.</p>

		<p>It angers me that these so called &#8220;civil rights&#8221; agencies are using are tax money to destroy what is left of our freedom.</p>
<p>Whites need to organize to counter the other ethnic groups are we are finished.  The &#8220;civil right&#8221; groups primarily attack white Christins.  Blacks organize along racial lines all the time, and they do so without a hint of hypocrisy as they attack whites for the slightest organization.</p>

		<p>When I post an advertisement online for a housemate, I refrain from mentioning anything about race, religion, ethnic background or age.  That way, when somebody of a non-preferred group inquires about the room, he must waste his time coming to visit, speaking with me and then waiting - so that I can tell him some bogus reason why he would not be a good fit.  In the eyes of the state, this helps protect people.  In reality, it would be a lot better for all parties if people could simply post their preferences up front and avoid wasting time.</p>

<p>This says it all.  These two idiot leftists thought they had a &#8220;gotcha moment&#8221;, but they are learning that our side has resources too.  With the state of Michigan near financial ruin why would they waste money on a redundant agency like the Michigan Division of Civil Rights?  It&rsquo;s existence is just to employ hateful leftist anti-whites I suppose.  </p>

		<p>This poor women must have missed Briget Fonda in Single White Female from 1992.The plot of the movie proves that wanting a room mate who is like yourself in dangerous. In the movie the new Room Mate turns out to be a murdering psychopath. Better she take a chance and have a Muslim women who likes to dress like Darth Vader. Better yet how about a muslim man who thinks that by choosing him as your room mate you do not mind being raped on a daily basis.</p>

		<p>Here is a perfect example of why I want to see this despicable empire go bankrupt and belly up.  If it did, it wouldn&rsquo;t have the resources to file frivolous claims like this.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, the feds will always have the ability to tax, but they won&rsquo;t have enough revenue for critical services during a severe depression, and they will have to reduce their free-loaders on the public dole to just a skeleton crew.</p>
<p>But, on second thought, how much power will they have to tax if the peasants are rioting from sea to shining sea, divided up into armed camps?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all for collapse and splitting up into racial enclaves.  And keep in mind, when the US goes under so will China, India and the rest of the world, so those who think we will be vulnerable to outside attack fear not.  The whole globe will be in utter turmoil.  It&rsquo;s close to that already.</p>

		<p>I am truly frightened. Never in my life did I think that something like this was possible in Western Society. But now I know better; discrimination simply means &#8220;making a distinction&#8221;. Not being able to make distinctions of our own (IE: a discrimination), gives us no other choice than to adopt the governments point of view in all business public and private.</p>
<p>Further it isn&rsquo;t possible to &#8220;deny&#8221; someone housing by simply defining parameters in am advertisement. Say for example a black muslim male applied and was rejected on three separate counts by the woman who made that advertisement; race, religion and sex. A true liberal would protest that the man has been denied housing. But has that really happened? The man was never within the scope of the homeowners intention to share her home. Nothing can be taken away or denied which was not first offered. Picture two men, one has glass of beer and the other does not. Can the man without beer claim that the man with beer unfairly denied him access to it? Does this change if the man with beer offers a portion to a third party? Some people would probably answer yes; I reckon those people are inflicted with a terrible case of moral weakness. One man does not owe another his beer, nor does any person owe another access to their residence or property.</p>
<p>This is all IMO, of course, but I sincerely believe it to be the right one.</p>

		<p>What I want to know is WHEN are the Christian Churches going to start protesting and demand the end of these so-called &#8220;discrimination&#8221; laws? Fair Housing, Civil Rights law, hate crime laws are all aimed at WHITE people and Christians, period. The churches should have thought about all this, before getting on board with the Civil Rights movement, affirmative action, nonwhite immigration, anti-discrimination laws knowing full well who they were going to target with these acts.</p>

		<p>I have a few questions.</p>
<p>If she had just said, &#8220;I am looking for a room-mate, preferably&hellip;.&#8221; and then listed her desired traits, would she still have gotten into trouble? And if it&rsquo;s now illegal to list preferred traits, what if she went through a group and asked questions, then chose the one who was a Christian? I wonder if someone (say, a Korean transvestite) could sue for discrimination? </p>
<p>How far does this type of politically-correct flaying go? Are we now at a point where we are being forced to live with people who are the exact opposite of our choices? I&rsquo;d really like a judge somewhere to explain personal choices. This is oddly reminding me of the white single woman who was berated for being racist because she didn&rsquo;t want to go out on a date set up by her girlfriends, (He was black.) She said she preferred not to date black men. For that, she was called racist.</p>
<p>You know, luckily we&rsquo;re not robots. (At least not yet.) We choose who we want to be friends with, who we date, and who we marry. I guess choosing who you live with is now off the table.</p>

		<p>I see no dicriminaion here. I&rsquo;m not a Christian so I can be totally objective about it. This lady merely expressed her desire to share her home with someone of similar faith or interest. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very common for people to search for roommates of similar sex, age and even interest.  She really didn&rsquo;t single any faith out for discrimination she only expressed a desire for a roommate of a certain religion. I would think that all groups would consider this as perfectly normal. </p>
<p>So I supose a Jew, a Muslim or even and Atheist couldn&rsquo;t question a potential roommate before bringing out the whiskey and ham sandwiches. </p>

		<p>&#8220;The complaint specifically alleges the woman&rsquo;s statement, &ldquo;I am looking for a Christian roommate,&rdquo; prevents people of &ldquo;other faiths&rdquo; from contacting the woman and making arrangements to share her home with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>As should be her right.  The problem with forcing people to abide by these oppressive guidelines is that it simply makes people do these things in a black market fashion where they still seek a Christian roommate, but keep that choice private.  Ultimately these laws are not only oppressive, but ineffective.  Not that I expect the multicult loons to follow any form of rationality.</p>

		<p>When it&rsquo;s muslims proud of their heritage, blacks &#8216;giving back&rsquo; or fighting-stereotypes, or gays celebrating their inclusiveness, it&rsquo;s always great to celebrate your preferences as long as you&rsquo;re not a white christian.

		<p>It&rsquo;s her house, she should be able to pick and choose who she wants in it! What happened to private property? I&rsquo;m a single female and if I was looking for a room mate, I&rsquo;d choose another female as well, because I wouldn&rsquo;t be comfortable living in close quarters with a strange man I didn&rsquo;t know. Is that being sexist? Do I deserve to be sued?</p>

		<p>I am stunned at this insane liberal development and think it should be an issue taken all the way to the Supreme Court. If it ever came to that and the court ruled against the defendant, we can all hang our heads and cry. When you let somebody live in your home, that is not like just renting out a house or apartment. This person would become an integral part of your life, sharing the housework, watching the same TV, preparing and eating meals and on and on. So then it truly becomes a matter of freedom of association. God help us if we can&rsquo;t choose the people who share our private space with us.</p>

<p>Probably so, and let&rsquo;s hope.   But in any case it constitutes legal harassment. The &#8220;complaint&#8221; should never have gotten to base one.</p>
<p>Most people don&rsquo;t know the difference  about the law and will be intimidated even so. Therefore, even if the case is  ultimately thrown out, it will have done its job   &mdash;   that of intimidating the citizenry not to make such requests in future.</p>
<p>I would hope the defendant in this case would turn around and sue for wrongful prosecution and legal harassment. Turn the tables on them!  Make them pay for misusing the law in this way.</p>

		<p>From time to time I encounter such news items (usually here at AmRen), showing the &#8216;last frontier&rsquo; (as it were) of the multiculti-PC war our treasonous elites and regime are waging against America&rsquo;s freedoms (a war even further along in W. Europe). The correct answer to such an assault is a Tea-Party-like grassroots movement   &mdash;  - which would, however, go far beyond the range of issues currently raised by the TP   &mdash;  - and without being shy about asserting the primacy of the White Euro-American heritage. Incidentally, such a strategy, if stridently championed by enough people, would garner support from among the more successful and peaceful of our existing ethnic minorities. (I believe over at VDARE this is known as the &#8216;Sailer Stategy&rsquo;: divide and conquer). Even apart from that, freedom of association can become a powerful rallying cry in this individualistic country of ours. It us actually gratifying, in a way, that the hard America-hating left is overreaching: it may be their undoing. </p>

		<p>All regular posters know my views on Christianity, but this is not merely a question of religion.  In a free country, association is a personal choice.  Have we fallen so far that our lawmakers will not allow free association?  What&rsquo;s next, forcing churches and mosques to combine?  Ridiculous notion, I know, but this is the logic of this issue.</p>
<p>But it is not an issue of being punished for being Christian, it is an issue of being told at any time, that you do not have the right to choose who lives in your house.  This is a result of Diversity.  The laws must appear to favor no one and we all must learn how to navigate the nonsense in order to follow the law.  The sense that freedom is lost comes because it makes everyone feel that they must &#8220;walk on eggshells.&#8221;  But this trend is nothing new.  Women have created impossible situatios for men in workplaces through these laws.  As a result of that, which I see as a kind of harassment in itself combined with AA laws, women now dominate the best jobs, government and private.  Just look around.  Men are largely in sales, construction, and truck driving.  The relatively smaller fields of the traditional professions is similarly weeding out men, especially white men.</p>
<p>It all begins with rules that make everyday life like this, an exercise in Political Correctness.  A Christian, or anyone seeking a room mate will have to keep her real feelings to herself.  But the spectre of lawsuits by the rejected applicants is still possible.  The lawyers are thrilled.</p>
<p>All I see in all of this is an increasing disfunction of society.  The weight of this disfunction will sooner or later cause a mass implosion.  It will be a really terrible event and plunge the entire world into a new dark age.</p>

I absolutely refuse to discuss many of my political, philosophical, and scientific views with people at my church because they will be the first to turn me for thought crimes. The Christian church in the United States for some reason thinks that it has to be on board with multiculturism and diversity and even encourages its members to betray each other. </p>

		<p>My understanding of the Fair Housing Act of 1968 is even landlords renting out properties in which they do not personally reside are exampt if they&rsquo;re renting out a small number of units (I think 15) and/or are not actually doing it as a business.</p>
<p>This means apartment complexes have to follow FHA rules, but someone renting out a guest room or the other half of their duplex, or a couple of single-family homes they bought as investment property do not have to obey the guidelines.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve seen Washington DC area college-age &#8220;roommate wanted&#8221; ads taken off bulletin boards (both on-line and physical bulletin boards) for the Fair Housing Violation of &#8220;no children&#8221; or &#8220;child-free&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Let that sink in for a minute, and consider the DC metro area: <br>
three college students who want to rent a 4th room are REQUIRED to &#8220;non-discriminate&#8221; in regards to local <b>black single mothers with children!</b>  Can you imagine if the state forces black mothers with a passel of kids on college students renting $400 rooms?  Luckily most ads are quietly rephrased and re-posted.   </p>
<p>I brought this up in class one time, and two feminists immediately insisted that college kids should be forced to room with strange single mothers, so the single mothers could have &#8220;affordable housing&#8221;.  They also strongly implied that my objection was racist.</p>
<p>FYI: Overcrowding objections are <b>useless</b> in most counties around here, unfortunately, as children of any age are exempted from crowding regulations if they&rsquo;re living with parents.  I know this because I complained about immigrant neighbors stuffing <b>11 people into a 2-bedroom apartment</b> in Fairfax County.  <br>

		<p>My email to the Fair Housing Center of West Michigan, the outfit that first received the complaint and passed it on to the &#8220;Civil Right&#8221; Division in Detroit:</p>
<p>I am astonished that you pursue a discrimination complaint against a woman seeking a roommate in her own home. Whether she wants a Christian, Hindu, or Muslim roommate, what business is it of the Federal Government&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>The Federal law you appeal to is clearly unconstitutional. Federal power is enumerated, that is, individually specified. There is no individually specified power given Congress to pass any law regulating whom she may room with in her private home.  The only power that mentions any constraint on homeowners is the 3rd Amendment, which expressly forbids the quartering of soldiers without the home owner&rsquo;s consent, EXCEPT in a manner to be prescribed by law. and that ONLY in wartime.</p>
<p>You should be defending citizens from Federal harassers, not aiding and abetting them.</p>
<p>According to your Vision Statement: &#8220;The Fair Housing of West Michigan recognizes the importance of &#8216;home&rsquo; as a component of the American dream&#8221;. What irony! You have turned this lady&rsquo;s &#8220;dream&#8221; for the use of her home into a nightmare. I suggest you promptly schedule a thorough course on the US Constitution, taught by someone who takes it seriously, with mandatory attendance for all staff and volunteers.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you might create another nightmare for someone else.</p>
<p>Very truly yours,</p>

<p>Jill they are allowed to choose whomever they want but they CANNOT state the preference in an ad. Discrmination is fair for roomates and landlords living near the dwelling but obviously if half the rent ads openly said &#8220;only whites&#8221; or &#8220;must be Christian&#8221; the PC crowd would get upset.</p>

		<p>This is no surprise because there is precedent.   </p>
<p>In the blog The Volokh Conspiracy, lawyer Eugene Volokh <a href="https://volokh.com/posts/1179259134.shtml" rel="nofollow"> writes about a woman seeking a roommate in 2002</a>:  &ldquo;The California Fair Employment &amp; Housing Commission penalized Melissa DeSantis $500 for inflicting &#8220;emotional distress&#8221; on a would-be roommate by allegedly telling him that &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t really like black guys. I try to be fair and all, but they scare me.&rsquo;&rdquo;   </p>
<p>In another case, in 1989, a woman who rented a house looked for a roommate to share expenses.  She refused to take a lesbian roommate, and ultimately the <a href="https://www.wisbar.org/res/capp/z1994/94-2983.html" rel="nofollow"> Wisconsin Supreme Court </a> in 1996 found &ldquo;Ann Hacklander-Ready liable for refusing to accept a lesbian as a housemate, and made Hacklander-Ready pay $300 in damages and $23,000 in attorneys&rsquo; fees.&rdquo;  See The Volokh Conspiracy, <a>&#8220;&gt;https://volokh.com/posts/1179259134.shtml&gt;</a> for a discussion  of this case.</p>
<p>So an elderly woman in a studio apartment, squeezing out a retirement on Social Security, might want a roommate for the other twin bed, but can&rsquo;t object if a black Muslim male wants to rent it?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s next?  The government will ask you to provide a list of those you date, to be sure you weren&rsquo;t discriminating on sex, race and religion?   Maybe check your Christmas card list to see if it is diverse?  <br>

		<p>As far as overcrowding goes I have read that most apartment complexes will not allow more than two children to share a single bedroom. Usually the stories of 11 or more people sharing a house or apartment are the result of illegal renting of additional bedrooms to people who are not on the lease. I will say that most people with kids would not be comfortable living with a group of college kids. As someone who has rented rooms it is pretty common to have people come to look at an advertised room that do not fit into the household so we would just take their information and not call them back. </p>

It&rsquo;s the same thing with &#8220;discrimination&#8221;.</p>
<p>A discriminating person used to be a person with refined tastes and good judgement. It was considered a compliment.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s a pejorative. It could almost get you arrested.  We&rsquo;re not supposed to discriminate between what&rsquo;s bad and what&rsquo;s good.  We&rsquo;re supposed to be non-judgemental, lest someone&rsquo;s feelings or cultural values might  be offended. That&rsquo;s why Mozart is no longer any better than Chubbie Checker or Little Richard.  And Shakespeare&rsquo;s English is no better than Ebonics. All cultures are equal, you know. There is no superior or inferior.  (So we&rsquo;re told.)</p>
