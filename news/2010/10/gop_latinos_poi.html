			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Philip Rucker, Washington Post, October 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Turn on the television in any state near the border with Mexico, and before long you&rsquo;ll see a Republican campaign ad that looks something like this one, which ran here earlier this year: &#8220;I&rsquo;m standing in New Mexico,&#8221; the candidate says, &#8220;and on the other side of that fence is the murder capital of the world.&#8221; A picture of armed police flashes across the screen. &#8220;When crime spills over, I prosecute.&#8221;</p>
<p>What makes this particular spot unusual is the name of the candidate who made it: Susana Martinez. Like many Republicans, New Mexico&rsquo;s candidate for governor is taking advantage of voters&rsquo; anger over illegal immigration. She has pledged to go after undocumented workers and make it illegal for them to obtain driver&rsquo;s licenses. She defends Arizona&rsquo;s right to pass its controversial new law targeting illegals, and she is a vocal supporter of ending sanctuary policies for illegal immigrants who are arrested for committing crimes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Martinez is one of a trio of Latino Republicans poised to win high office this year in part by running on an anti-immigration platform. In Florida, Senate candidate Marco Rubio is ahead of Democrat Kendrick Meek and independent Charlie Crist. And in Nevada, gubernatorial candidate Brian Sandoval is leading Democrat Rory Reid.</p>
<p>If they win, Martinez, Rubio and Sandoval would make up a high-profile triumvirate that Republicans hope will help the party woo increasingly influential Latino voters. The nation&rsquo;s fastest-growing voting bloc  &mdash;  nearly half the voters in New Mexico, for instance, are of Latino origin  &mdash;  has largely shunned the GOP in recent years.</p>
<p>Yet those Republican hopes may be difficult to realize, if only because the GOP&rsquo;s anti-immigration rhetoric is a primary reason Latinos have turned away from the party.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Republican strategists acknowledge that the tone of the immigration debate has hurt the party among many Hispanics. {snip}</p>
<p>For the GOP, the more discouraging finding may be that just 6 percent of those polled said they see the Republican Party as more concerned about Latinos than the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yet Democrats say Martinez, Rubio and Sandoval are trying to have it both ways  &mdash;  trumpeting their Hispanic heritage while embracing policies that work against fellow Latinos.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This is how Martinez hopes Latino voters will see her  &mdash;  not as a crusader against illegal immigration, but as an American success story.</p>

		<p>Let me take a wild guess&hellip;the author cites no polls to bolster this &#8220;hurdle&#8221; opinion.  Just a wild guess, based on the fact that &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; as a population are not really opposed to America having borders (one reason being newly arrived &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; immigrants compete for their jobs).</p>

<p>There you go.  A reference to polls with NO mention of &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; opinion on immigration control.  That&rsquo;s because &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; opinion (contra &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; racialist organizations) doesn&rsquo;t support WaPo&rsquo;s argument.</p>

		<p>It is EXTREMELY rare for any American politician, whether white, Jewish, Hispanic or black, to believe, let alone do, anything that is overtly in the best interests of America as whole.  There are some, Tom Tancredo for instance, who seem to honestly want what is best for America. There are others, Robert Menedez, the Senator for Latin America, who clearly do not. It is possible that one of these Hispanic candidates actualy sees himself/herself as an American first and wants America to survive not only for themselves but for their children and grandchildren as well.  Only time, and actions, will tell.</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;Republican strategists acknowledge that the tone of the immigration debate has hurt the party among many Hispanics.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>And how has the GOP&rsquo;s &#8220;tone&#8221; affected its image among <i>Whites?</i>  Is no one even asking?  Does anyone care?  Just exactly who <i>are</i> these unnamed &#8220;strategists,&#8221; and what are their motives?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;If they win, Martinez, Rubio and Sandoval would make up a high-profile triumvirate that Republicans hope will help the party woo increasingly influential Latino voters.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>And what will help the party woo <i>White</i> voters  &mdash;  who, by the way, just happen to be the vast majority of voters?  Is there anyone in the GOP who cares?  Or is their goal now simply to out-Democrat the Democrats?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;For the GOP, the more discouraging finding may be that just 6 percent of those polled said they see the Republican Party as more concerned about Latinos than the Democratic Party.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Have I missed something?  Is there some kind of legal obligation for the Republicans to become a mestizo advocacy group?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The nation&rsquo;s fastest-growing voting bloc &mdash; nearly half the voters in New Mexico, for instance, are of Latino origin &mdash; has largely shunned the GOP in recent years.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Then the most expedient course for the GOP would be to do everything in its power to <i>stop</i> &#8220;latinos&#8221; from becoming &#8220;the nation&rsquo;s fastest-growing voting bloc,&#8221; and concentrate on the <i>White</i> voters who make up their power base.</p>
<p>When the only &#8220;mainstream&#8221; opposition to the Obongo caliphate is doing everything in its power to become exactly like their opponents, we have a &#8220;two-party system&#8221; in name only.</p>
<p>The time is right for an explicitly pro-White party.  Yes, it&rsquo;ll be crucified by the controlled governmedia, but if it can simply survive from election to election, it will eventually gather enough influence to make it increasingly more difficult to ignore.  Where, O where, is our leadership?</p>

		<p>Had the Republicans not let in so many Hispanics in the first place they wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry now about capturing the Hispanic vote.  I can understand why the Democrats, not being electable by the existing electorate, decided to replace the electorate.  The Republicans were stupid to go along.  But the GOP has always been the Stupid Party.<br>

		<p>The GOP will never learn, will they?  They just keep pandering and pandering to any minority group they &#8220;think&#8221; will vote for them. What fools. &#8220;Latinos&#8221; are going to vote just like the blacks vote, for whoever gives them more stuff and more of Whitey&rsquo;s money. The GOP is worthless and clueless.</p>

		<p>Sure been a long time since Republicans or Democrats asked for a plain old white vote, hasn&rsquo;t it? Is anyone else tired of hearing about the value of the &#8220;Latino&#8221; vote as I am. This is still the United States of America, isn&rsquo;t it? And those who live here and vote here should be known as Americans. I&rsquo;m also sick of &#8220;mutlicutural&#8221; and &#8220;diversity&#8221; slogans. These are only means of dividing us as a nation, which I think is in the perverted plan for this nation.</p>

		<p>It may lure a couple mexicans to vote for the GOP, but in the process it will abandon everything sane. And millions of whites will refuse to vote for them due to pandering to minorities.</p>

		<p>This acticle repeats the same old talking points that the liberal news media likes to repeat over in over again, like a broken record. Hispanics continue to grow in numbers (it&rsquo;s inevitable and unstoppable, so get use to it!)&hellip; and unless the Republican party softens its stance on immigration (read amnesty) it&rsquo;ll never get their vote and thus will never be a majority party. The only problem with this thinking is that no matter how much Republicans pander by supporting amnesty and the like, mestizos will always vote for the party of more government handouts. And if the republicans decide to give in and support a liberal nanny state, we will be left with a one party socialist system with the veneer of a two party government. And it bears pointing out, Rubio is ethnically hispanic, but racially he a white Cuban. (pic of him en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Marco_Rubio.jpg ) And Ms. Martinez also looks to be a &#8216;Castellano&rsquo; and not of an Indian background.

		<p>This article is just another ploy by the Far Left.<br>
WaPo is trying to advance amnesty under the guise<br>
that it will contribute to a Republican victory.<br>
They know the victory is foregone..so they try this<br>
little game. Of course the Left is pathologically <br>
incapable of anything but waffling, and gibberish, they<br>
are incapable of understanding that we are not going<br>
to give the country away, no matter how &#8220;inevitable&#8221; or<br>
&#8220;progressive&#8221; it seems.</p>

		<p>Dear White Republicans,</p>
<p>The more you pander to blacks and latinos and basically anyone other than a straight, white heterosexual christian, the more of your original base you will turn off.  Notice how you turn off your base while the people you pander to hate you and usually never vote for you?  Are you starting to follow a pattern here?  What are you going to do for white voters?</p>

		<p>The GOP cannot do basic arithmetic, apparently. Support a policy that that will attract a few Hispanics, while bringing in millions more who will likely vote heavily against the GOP. The Democrats refer to the GOP as the &#8220;party for white males&#8221;. I disagree. If it were, they presumably wouldn&rsquo;t be destroying the interests of the white race based on bad arithmetic.</p>
