<p>A recent study done by the University of Chicago found that native English speakers view those with a foreign accent as being less trustworthy. The study found that the dialect distrust was not due to prejudice, but because those with accents were harder to understand. Participants in the study reported a small, yet definitive difference, between the believability of trivia statements read by native versus non-native English speakers.</p>
<p>On a believability scale of 1 to 10, the statements read by native English speakers were rated at a 7.5, while those read by speakers with a slight accent were rated at a 6.95, and speakers with a heavy accent were given a truthfulness rating of 6.84. It seems that the harder it is for us to understand someone, the less likely we are to trust what they&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to a University of Chicago press release on the study, &#8220;Accents might reduce the credibility of non-native job seekers.&#8221; Which in turn may make it more difficult for job-seekers with accents to land a job.</p>
<p>Though blatant accent discrimination is part of Title VII (the title of The Civil Rights Act that addresses equal opportunity employment) and is addressed in the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission compliance manual, it is also specified that there are legitimate, business-related reasons for companies to require workers to speak clear English. Meaning that while it is illegal for employers to discriminate against workers with accents, they can legally choose not to hire a worker with an accent if it will interfere with the person&rsquo;s ability to effectively do the job.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But what about the regional accents here in the U.S.? We have dozens of regional dialects, from the Southern drawl, to the Texas twang, to the &#8220;Joisey&#8221; accent, to MinneSOOHta and Boston&rsquo;s &#8220;pahk the cah in Hahvahd yahd.&#8221; Aren&rsquo;t these regional dialects just as difficult to understand? {snip}</p>

		<p>An accent that suggests that the speaker was not born to the English language, further suggests differences in perspective; whereby the speaker sees a thing or phenomenon differently than is customary for anglophone speakers to see it. Most benevolently, it is less a matter of &#8220;trust&#8221; (believing the speaker is telling the truth) than it is a matter of 
<p>Even among us born to the English language, assuming similar levels of education, there is that phenomenon of &#8220;&hellip; two peoples separated by a common language&hellip; &#8221; (Chuchill) For example, take the phrase &#8220;knock up:&#8221; In England it means knocking on someone&rsquo;s door cold, not necessarily knowing whether your intended host is at home or not. Here in the USA, it meand getting a girl or woman pregnant, with the connotation that the act of intercourse which engendered the pregnancy, was illicit.</p></p>

		<p>I detest talking to these people with foreign accents. You cannot understand a word they say. All our major corporations hire these people in India and Indonesia and no telling where else. I file a complaint with orgs. such as AT&T; when I get someone like that whenever I call. Even most American blacks are hard to understand . I remember the days when these people were all White! We all need to file complaints with any company that discriminates against English speaking Whites and tell them we will discontinue our service or not do business with them anylonger if they do not change their policies. </p>

<p>Well Mizz Kaitlin, you are obviously one of the new crop of Constitutional illiterates in this country. The full faith and credit clause of the Constitution applies only to issues between States. There is no &#8220;full faith and credit&#8221; that inures to that which is alien to the nation.</p>

		<p>As someone who has travelled extensively in the US I can say that 95% of the time I can clearly understand a native English speaker even if they have a regional accent. Over the phone it can be a different story, as a former customer service rep there were times that I had to listen very carefully to someone with such an accent. Some of the hardest accents to decipher over the phone were British accents- some of them were almost as hard to understand as a foreign accent. I have been appalled at people with very thick foreign accents who were hired to work with the public. At least in person you can deduce what the person is saying based on gestures and facial expressions. Over the phone it is murder, I have hung up and called back when I have gotten people I cannot understand and faced a hold time rather than not get my question understood. One thing I will say is as a Southerner a Northern accent sometimes comes across as &#8220;rude&#8221; when no rudeness was intended.</p>

		<p>Strange - I grew up around quite a few people who spoke with a foreign accent. Of course those were German, Italian, Dutch and similar accents. Never occurred to me that there were any trust issues there whatever. Wonder what&rsquo;s different now?? Hmmmm?</p>

		<p>If I&rsquo;m on the phone or running errands, having people wait on me with a southern drawl or new-england twang doesn&rsquo;t bother me in the least. Most of the time they&rsquo;re white and I am sooo thankful because whatever I am doing will go so much smoother, generally. If they&rsquo;re not from this country and have a heavy accent it usually means a poor understanding of the English language. And, oh my God, I know it&rsquo;s going to be a difficult time ahead. And it usually is. But interestingly, if they&rsquo;re black, which I can tell even if it&rsquo;s by phone, and I&rsquo;m sure they can tell I&rsquo;m white, I get just as hard a time. Maybe worse. Because at least the foreigners aren&rsquo;t rude or condescending. But the majority of blacks I have to deal with are.</p>

		<p>It is not only the accent. It is also the loudness.</p>
<p>I live in Germany so I don&rsquo;t know how you black ghettos look like. Where I live, we have only black students from Africa who study Mathematics and Engineering. So I can say, I see every day the elite of blacks.</p>
<p>There are many different and foreign cultures and languages if I drive with the bus. But without seeing it, I can 100% tell you with closed eyes just by the loudness if there are blacks in the bus or not. They are just so loud, and there are a lot of them, you can look in the faces of the other passengers and just see how confused they are because TV always tell us they would be the same.<br/>
That was really the first thing I noticed, when I moved into this city: That blacks are far louder than others.<br/>

<p>You are definitely correct.  And those that you experience are higher class blacks.  Imagine how much louder are lower class blacks.  Think:  American prison in a state with at least an average proportion of the black population, or an American ghetto high school.</p>

		<p>I once called a city dept. to lodge a request.  A black woman answered the line.  I had to ask her to repeat herself several times in the first two minutes of the phone conversation.  </p>
<p>She tried so hard to hold it together, speaking in as proper a way as she could, but it was too much for her and she kept garbling or mispronouncing words - words that she was obviously reading off a scripted paper.</p>
<p>The last three times I needed tech advice I was connected to India.  All three of the Indians identified themselves with very common American names.  Can you imagine a guy with an Indian accent saying, &#8220;Hi, my name is Bob&#8221;?  Yeah right, Singaram Krishnamanamon!</p>
<p>The worst is when you call to activate a credit card and you&rsquo;re shunted to a call center in India or wherever.  When they ask for your credit card and other personal info over the phone, it is just so unnerving!  I imagine them selling my info to their cousin in Bangalore after hours.</p>
<p>My question still stands: why is it only we whites who are asked to abandon our cultures, or nations, our very uniqueness - but no other culture or racial group is asked to abandon theirs?  We have to &#8216;celebrate diversity,&rsquo; but only theirs!</p>

		<p>Here in Canada when you phone for help you&rsquo;re asked if you want English or French service. If you want English you&rsquo;ll be talking to someone in India. Be prepared to ask the rep to repeat himself many times. So the trick is to ask for French service. The reps are all Canadians and they&rsquo;re also good with English. I&rsquo;m not sure if the USA is that way yet with Spanish.</p>

		<p>Several years ago, when internet and computer call service centers were relatively new, Indian call techs were using their legitimate names. You would be handed off to be helped by Roopnah, or Merkhat, etc. After overwhelming numbers of complaints by American consumers the corporations (mistakenly) believed that giving Roopnah and Merkhat American first names would instantly eradicate their unintelligible accents and the Americans would become happy campers again.</p>
<p>Before I wised up I made tons of calls to Earthlink, the worst possible internet provider on the planet. They had absolutely no compatibility with anything Macintosh, and until I dropped them it seemed I spent half my computer time on the phone with New Delhi or the like talking to Roopnah or her compatriots. On the last call I ever made to Earthlink I was assisted by &#8216;Brad&rsquo;. Complete with heavy Indian accent. Right. Uh huh. I started laughing out loud, and said, &#8220;Brad, huh? Ok, BRAD I don&rsquo;t think so. How about if I just call you Rajneesh?&#8221; </p>
<p>My biggest grudge against (particularly Indian) foreigners who are here in the U.S. is my (perhaps unfair) assumption that they are likely owners of a convenience store, hotel, dry cleaners or virtually any business in a tourist location, or their family members, who are operating under entirely different tax laws, interest rates, and other government perks that allow them the avenue to start up businesses that are not afforded to American citizens. Thus, they are able to operate with generous profits because of them. Meanwhile, those of us who bust our backsides to jump through the hoops of owning a business here are hamstrung with enormous government expenditures hanging over our heads. I resent this almost to the point of uncontrollable rage.</p>

<p>No, little miss communist, it is not the same.  I can understand George W. Bush, I could understand JFK, the policewoman from Fargo, the Guidos on Jersey Shore, and even the deepest the South has to offer.  But I can NOT understand hardly anyone from India, and few Mexicans for that matter.</p>
<p>I remember when I was booking a vacation last summer, Expedia connected me to a call center in Mexico (or maybe it was a Mexican immigrant, not sure).  It was a nightmare.  At first, my grandmother had tried to talk to her, but she gave up and handed me the phone.  It was pure hell, repeating everything five times, making her repeat everything five times, repeat, repeat, repeat.  I was terribly afraid she couldn&rsquo;t understand the credit card number, and would mess the whole process up.  I was also afraid I heard some vital piece of information wrong (such as the twenty-digit confirmation number), and the trip would be ruined.  In fact, we did wind up paying more than we should have, because there was a mis-understanding and she booked the flight and hotel separately, thus denying us Expedia&rsquo;s lowered fares for booking as a package.</p>
<p>I hope to live to see the day outsourcing is criminalized.  Or at least there is a stiff tariff set up to prevent it from happening.  Those greedy neo-cons will put up a nasty fight, but the overwhelming majority of Americans (including my aforementioned and very liberal grandmother) despise outsourced phone calls.</p>

		<p>German, I know what you mean.  I, too, thought blacks were like the blacks on television&hellip;wonderful, brilliant people who endured cruel racism with quiet dignity.  Then, when I was 13, my family moved to the city and I had to go to school with blacks for the first time.  They were incredibly loud, screaming at each other in the hallways, etc.  It was quite an awakening.</p>

<p>You mentioned the Indians that congregate around owning a certain business.  I might have mentioned this here before, but I read an article in a lawyers mag (not a lawyer, btw) more than a decade ago, detailing how Indians get away with it.  It&rsquo;s so complicated that I can&rsquo;t remember, and even if I could, it&rsquo;s too much to state here.  But the scam involved the Indian hotel owning class all having the same surname (Patel), and their manipulating Federal small business loan and private bank lending because of that.</p>

<p>The Federal government has the the power to make it happen.  Congress has the right to regulate trade with foreign countries.  If it were doing that instead of messing around with things it had no business involving itself with, i.e. forcing people to buy health care because Obama hearts Karen Ignagni, then we would be a lot better off.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example:  Foxconn is a Taiwanese company that manufactures iPhones and iPads for Apple.  They recently opened a new factory in central China which will soon have 400,000 employees/slaves.  My mouth fell to the floor when I read this figure.  Imagine how this country would go bonkers in a good way if a 400,000 employee factory opened in Ohio, and the jobs paid unionized wages and benefits comparable to that of automobile assembly lines.  My idea is to force Apple to force Foxconn to set aside a fraction of jobs for Americans (and by &#8220;Americans,&#8221; I mean unionized non-college educated middle-aged native born white Americans), as a price for Foxconn being able to profit from the American consumer market via Apple.  If just one percent   &mdash;   Such a 4,000 employee factory opening in Ohio would be great news.</p>

		<p>Some of the worst accents are the softest.  You look at a Hispanic trying to talk to you and they don&rsquo;t make eye contact as they zip through something with lip and facial movements that are very hard to read or worse, answer with 2-3 words that seem to occur at different points in the sentence each time so that you&rsquo;re not sure what they are reacting to or why.</p>
<p>And the more you try to rephrase the question, the more you try to encourage them to &#8216;Speak up, please?&rsquo; the less they say until you are left looking past each other.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re mad because you can hear the &#8216;R word&rsquo; zipping by so many different ways and yet you consider yourself to be fluent and rationale, capable of working out a difference in perception.  </p>
<p>If only you could connect at some level at all.</p>
<p>I will say this, among the decent Hispanics I know, almost all of them 40-50 years gone &#8216;first generation&rsquo; immigrants, every one of them made certain their kids spoke English at home (including bringing home english speaking friends to saturate with), even if they were virtual linguistic cripples themselves.  And through that, they gained competency.</p>
<p>The ones you have to watch out for are the old country grandma and grandpa, who take an evil joy in raising the kids as Spanish speakers and will try to make it dominate the household.</p>
<p>ESL is also very popular here with churches and libraries and community colleges all pushing it _hard_, with day and night classes, some of them free.  I&rsquo;m not quite sure whether I agree with it or not because a lot of it is rote phrase parroting and again, there is a sense of trying to gain acceptance for trying rather than because there is a reason they are here, displacing whites.</p>

		<p>Poster 13, please tell us more about these situation with the foreign teachers and the location or city at least. This should be told and with greater detail in an article here or Vdare.  It would be good to interview them. Make it an article/interview about their life and possibly watch how they teach. Then show it to all America and in unison millions of people with mouths opened and jaws dropped to the ground sound a thud that should awaken even the most comatose citizen to realize the depths we&rsquo;ve been buried in the foreigners. </p>

<p>I am writing about S. California, Los Angeles specifically.  We are on the &ldquo;cutting edge&rdquo; of the geopolitical/demographic changes sweeping this country.</p>
<p>California is deeply in debt.  WND reports:</p>
<p><i>California&rsquo;s cost of illegal immigration is $21.8 billion, or $8 billion more than the state&rsquo;s current budget deficit of $13.8 billion&hellip;The biggest fiscal cost to states, borne by state and local taxpayers, is $53 billion spend on education the children of illegal.</i></p>
<p>Something&rsquo;s &lsquo;gotta&rsquo; give in California&rsquo;s educational system as approximately 40% of the budget is mandated to educational spending via the complicated Prop 98 formula, enacted by ballot in 1988.</p>
<p>One of the ways to reduce educational expenses is to reduce payroll expenses, the largest portion of any district&rsquo;s educational budget.  This is being done by methodically replacing the most expensive, senior teachers (mostly White) <br/>
with  (lower paid and easily controlled) &lsquo;teachers&rsquo; from the Philippines, Nigeria and Mexico.  I personally see this, increasingly, expanding exponentially from what I can tell.  Most are unintelligible and poorly prepared.  But that matters little to the school district; these replacement teachers cost a lot less and (importantly) they are not White.  </p>
<p>A school nurse told me recently that the entire (heavily Filipina) nursing staff is being replace by nurses imported from Nigeria.  The Filipinas have been here awhile, now cost too much, so a new, cheaper cohort is being imported to replace them.</p>
<p>And you are correct that more needs to be exposed, more written about and that few writers do, especially about inherent and intractable differences in racial IQ as the cause of the achievement gap.</p>
<p>As for VDare:</p>
<p>I submitted a monograph to them (under &lsquo;not for publication&rsquo;) a few years ago which they asked to publish immediately.  I thought about it for a week before I agreed.  I cannot risk my career or pension, the SPLC notifying my employer that I am a hateful racist and Nazi.  I agreed as long as my identity were well hidden.  My essay was very heavily edited, the writing dissimilar to my own, a few key points deleted.  The responses I got called me &#8216;heartless&rsquo; and &#8216;uncaring.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As for California:</p>
<p>You can stick a fork in it.</p>

<p>I have experienced this too, and it struck me as extremely bizarre. I had to call for software support and knew it would be a nightmare of dealing with foreigners with a complex issue. I admit I was amused at the monikers they chose for themselves, &#8220;Troy&#8221; and &#8220;Lance&#8221;, which are somewhat uncommon, and for me brings up images of 1960&rsquo;s surfing movies.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve lived an traveled extensively abroad.  German accents, Scottish accents, Australian accents and Italian accents never engendered any trust issues.  Even Chinese and Japanese accents never raised problems.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the expectation here in the United States seems to be that I learn Spanish and Ebonics.  Does anyone suppose there&rsquo;s a racial issue to this phenomenon?<br/>

		<p>To all the posters, NPR had a story about 3 weeks ago about some Nueva York latino museum exhibit and they said that a placard hung inside said that America will be a Spanish speaking country by 2050, so we had better just get used to it.  </p>
<p>The reporter (white liberal female with a pretentious voice) said it in an approving way.  Then a white liberal &#8216;artist&rsquo; who was a guest speaker there was quoted on air saying the same thing.  (I encourage all to look up this audio file on the NPR website and give it a listen.)</p>
<p>So if this is the case, then there is no point at all in spending money on ESL, teaching latinos English in school, worrying about accents, etc.  We had all just enroll our kids and grandkids in spanish language classes.</p>
<p>I know it sounds horrible, but despite all our protestations, bravado and solemn vows to prevent it, the critical mass of latino population is already here and it&rsquo;s their babies (five-a-piece) who will outnumber ours in only 1-2 decades.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like it.  Not at all.  And I favor every draconian measure to try and prevent it, but I just don&rsquo;t realistically see a way to stop it short of becoming a dictatorship and forcibly deporting people, at which time half our white population would rise up in arms (right and left) against government &#8216;tyranny.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>Question Diversity: The Indian small business scam is not that complicated at all. In fact, it&rsquo;s pretty transparent. During my legal career, I&rsquo;ve seen numerous transactions like this:</p>
<p>Indian X purchases a dump of a concenience store/gas station, in a terrible neighborhood, for $100,000.00. The transaction is financed by an SBA loan that heavily back-loaded, with Indian X paying interest only or primarily interest for the first couple of years. Within 2 years, Indian X &#8220;sells&#8221; the business to Indian Y (who is usually a relative or close friend of Indian X) for $200,000.00. This purchase is also financed with an SBA loan. Keep in mind, the gas station is still a dump. Within 2 years, Indian Y sells the business to Indian Z for $350,000, also financed with an SBA loan. In less than 5 years, Indians X, Y, and Z collectively have put $250,000.00 in cold, hard cash into their pockets. (All family expenses, of course, as run through the business so the Indians pay little income tax).</p>
<p>These transactions can go on 7 or 8 times, until the loan amount gets too ridiculous. (I recall a roach motel - that averaged 27% occupancy - change hands 4 times in 6 years, somehow increasing in &#8220;value&#8221; from $400,000.00 to $2,000,000.00 through a series of transactions involving 2 brothers and a cousin.) Eventually, the number gets too large, and a family member &#8220;takes the bullet&#8221; by filing bankruptcy. No matter, though, because the family usually has taken at least $1 million dollars in cash, which can then be used to purchase decent real estate for cash on the barrelhead. Without producing anything, they now own outright a $1 million shopping center that will continue to produce income for them for decades. This is how Indians &#8220;make money,&#8221; by gaming a system that I have come to understand was set up to enrich them in ways that are not available to white Americans. </p>
<p>The Koreans have been doing this for years, as well, with the ubiquitous dry cleaners and nail shops that pollute every street corner I see. It angers me even to write about it.<br/>

<p>That kind of stuff is obviously going on.  But the article I read detailed a different scam.  It  was more complicated than the scam you just outlined.  It involved Patels being able to confound private bankers (whom they want loans from) because they have the same last name, and confound private bankers to the point where the Patels are guilty of fraud.</p>
