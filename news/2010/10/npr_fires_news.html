<h1><a href="http://www.wtop.com/?sid=2087729&amp;nid=114">NPR Fires News Analyst After Remarks About Muslims</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WTOP-FM (Washington, D.C.), October 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>NPR has fired longtime news analyst Juan Williams, also a commentator on the Fox News Channel, after he told Bill O&rsquo;Reilly that he gets nervous when he sees people in Muslim garb on an airplane.</p>
<p>In a statement late Wednesday, National Public Radio said it was terminating Williams&rsquo; contract as a senior news analyst over his comments on Fox&rsquo;s &#8220;The O&rsquo;Reilly Factor.&#8221;</p>
<p>NPR executives had previously complained about his remarks on Fox and asked him to stop using the NPR name when he appeared on O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s show.</p>
<p>The latest comments came Monday, when O&rsquo;Reilly brought on guests to discuss his own appearance last week on ABC&rsquo;s &#8220;The View,&#8221; during which Joy Behar and Whoopi Goldberg walked off the set to protest his views on Muslims.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where am I going wrong here, Juan?&#8221; O&rsquo;Reilly asked.</p>
<p>Williams, 56, responded that too much political correctness can get in the way of reality.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean, look, Bill, I&rsquo;m not a bigot. You know the kind of books I&rsquo;ve written about the civil rights movement in this country,&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;But when I get on a plane, I got to tell you, if I see people who are in Muslim garb and I think, you know, they are identifying themselves first and foremost as Muslims, I get worried. I get nervous.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went on to say that not everyone in a religious group  &mdash;  Christian or Muslim  &mdash;  should be lumped together with extremists.</p>
<p>NPR CEO Vivian Schiller said that controversial opinions should not come from NPR reporters or news analysts and that whatever feelings Williams has about Muslims should be between him and &#8220;his psychiatrist or his publicist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking Thursday at the Atlanta Press Club, Schiller also said Williams had veered from journalistic ethics several times before Monday&rsquo;s comments.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Before Williams was fired, the Council on American-Islamic Relations said such commentary from a journalist about other racial, ethnic or religious minority groups would not be tolerated.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Later Wednesday, NPR issued a statement saying Williams&rsquo; remarks &#8220;were inconsistent with our editorial standards and practices, and undermined his credibility as a news analyst with NPR.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Juan has been a valuable contributor to NPR and public radio for many years and we did not make this decision lightly or without regret,&#8221; NPR spokeswoman Dana Davis Rehm said in an e-mailed statement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Williams&rsquo; appearances on Fox have been an issue for NPR in the past, including his remarks about Michelle Obama on a 2009 episode of &#8220;The O&rsquo;Reilly Factor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Michelle Obama, you know, she&rsquo;s got this Stokely Carmichael in a designer dress thing going .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. her instinct is to start with this blame America, you know, I&rsquo;m the victim,&#8221; Williams said, according to an account by NPR&rsquo;s Ombudsman Alicia Shepard. Carmichael was a civil rights activist.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t stand Juan Williams.  I always hoped he would get fired for his liberal views, however, he should NOT have been fired for stating that he is nervous when on planes carrying muslims in their traditional garb.  That is his opinion and he should have the right to say it.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s liberalism and political correctness for you!</p>

		<p>Hypocritical Libs get nervous when they hear the truth and it is not PC. Mr. Williams is no bigot and tells it like it is. I always enjoyed hearing his fair, candid, and rational perspectives, and his comments on O&rsquo;Reilly were right on. He merely voiced what millions of Americans are too uptight to say out loud about the encroaching Muslim menace in the world.<br/>
Muslims did attack us on 9/11 and I, too, get nervous when I see them in close proximity!<br/>
Fox should hire him as an analyst like Miller, Stossel, and the blonde babes.</p>

		<p>Why should a man lose his job for merely having an opinion?</p>
<p>To quote Noam Chomsky, who is a man politically correct people on the left should be familiar with, &#8220;If you believe in freedom of speech, you believe in freedom of speech for views you don&rsquo;t like. Goebbels was in favor of freedom of speech for views he liked. So was Stalin. If you&rsquo;re in favor of freedom of speech, that means you&rsquo;re in favor of freedom of speech precisely for views you despise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe Juan Williams&rsquo; comments offended some Muslims. For NPR to fire him for merely speaking his opinion proves that free speech doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

		<p>The few black intellectuals who make sense are conservatives. Williams(Juan) is the ONLY liberal black who makes sense. I have followed him for twenty years in the Wash Post. He&rsquo;s the exception who proves the rule. The other liberal blacks are ill-read, narrow-minded bigots. He is not. Even when I disagree with him, I admit he used intellect to get where he ended. An Andrew Sullivan would be another example, here a gay white liberal who is smart and logical. Most black pols don&rsquo;t like Williams already; he criticizes black parents for not preparing their kids for the real world. But Juan Williams will do well. His credibility as a result of this clumsy move by NPR will be at an all-time high. Most important, he has illustrated the legitimate fear all Americans who are really Americans feel towards the creepy Muslim culture.  While their goal is to destroy all Christian, Jewish and secular aspects of America, their danger to blacks ought to be apparent to at least blacks who attended some college and consider themselves &#8220;white collar&#8221;. Many do. Williams speaks for those people. Muslims cannot and will not assimilate. The fear all Americans, who are really Americans, feel when next to a bearded, robed zealot cannot be denied. No one listens to NPR anyway except for a few frustrated losers. Let this be the end of that fey &#8220;public&#8221; network.</p>

		<p>Information Theory states the &#8220;Quantity of Information&#8221; is a function of its predictability, or Probability.</p>
<p>NPR hosts, like a stop sign, convey very predictable messages, and thus have programming equally lacking in Quantity of Information.</p>
<p>The big news I guess, is that NPR took that stop sign away<br/>
because one morning it said &#8220;go&#8221;.</p>

		<p>A few facts about CAIR.</p>
<p>1. It is part of the Muslim Brotherhood network, and has<br/>
been connected to numerous terrorist groups, Islamic Jihad,<br/>
Hamas, Hezbollah.<br/>
2. CAIR has one goal, the spread of Islam in the US and inclusion<br/>
of the USA  in the worldwide Ummah of Islam.<br/>
3. CAIR mission includes  promotion of Sharia Law, and separation of Sharia from any other legal structures, ie. US Constitutional law. CAIR uses the US Constitutions &#8220;Freedom of Religion&#8221; as a shield to basically overthrow the Constitution. Islam however is NOT A RELIGION in the same way Christianity is..Islam is a <br/>
military, poltical power structure that uses religion. <br/>
4. CAIR is a money laundering network that controls massive<br/>
infusions of Saudi money. When you see 50,000sf Mosques being<br/>
built in Murfreesboro Tennesee, Plainfield Indiana, Baltimore,<br/>
Los Angeles etc this is CAIR at work.<br/>
5. CAIR donates millions to US Polticians. A list of Polticians<br/>
accepting Saudi money will be listed on Oct 27 in time for the elections on the website: http://www.muslimmafiainternational.com/</p>

		<p>9 JG:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with you.  I don&rsquo;t know where all this Juan Williams love is coming from.  As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, he was just hoisted on his own petard.  Just this morning, he was on FNC essentially agreeing with the moronic Zeskind report on the Tea Party Movement.</p>
<p>As far as your link, I noticed the author mentioned Connie Chung.  Notice that she was a really big star at CBS News for awhile, but you haven&rsquo;t seen hide nor hair of her for almost 15 years.  OKC happened just months after CBS gave up on the experiment of having Dan Rather and Chung co-anchor the evening news, so she was sent back to field reporter.  CBS sent her to Oklahoma City after Ramzi Yousef had the Federal building bombed.  (That&rsquo;s right, I said it.)  About a year and a half after OKC, the late Bill Cooper and a co-author came out with a really long tome-ish book about what happened just on the day of April 19, 1995 in and around Oklahoma City.  One section describes how Connie Chung, at least a dozen times, asked questions along the lines of &#8220;can the Oklahoma City Fire Department handle this all?&#8221;  The way she asked those questions, combined with how often she asked them, gave the impression that she thought the OKCFD was nothing but a bunch of ignorant rubes who were just days removed from stumbling on the wheel and fire, and therefore really not competent to handle a disaster.  After all, people who don&rsquo;t live on a coast musn&rsquo;t know their business from a hole in the ground.</p>
<p>CBS showed her the door later that year.  Last I heard, she was mopping floors at the Kennedy School of Government, or something like that.</p>

		<p>Sorry.. no sympathy from me. While I disagree with the fact that he was fired for stating his feelings about Muslims, I consider it sheer karma after so many whites have had their lives and careers destroyed when speaking the truth about race.

		<p>This article is a bit misleading.  Fired, implies out of work.  Implies someone of little power, influence and money being marginalized by those with lots of power, influence and money.</p>
<p>NPR is a marginal entity at best.  It literally cannot stand on its own and is heavily subsidized.  Nobody cares what anyone from that forum has to say.  They are irrelevant&hellip;.and will soon dissolve as conservatives take over the purse strings of government and lose interest in funding such nonsense.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Fox news is number one in the news business.  Most people get their news from this forum.  Working for Fox means you&rsquo;ve made it, in this field.  Regularly showing up on shows like O&rsquo;Reilly factor means you are somebody (unlike anyone at NPR&hellip;.who are literal nobodies).</p>
<p>A much more realistic portrayal of what happened with Williams is that he sold out his radical beliefs so that he could finally move up as a legitimate news commentator.  Someone that people have actually heard of.</p>
<p>Sortof like losing your &#8220;job&#8221; donating your time for a leftist college newspaper, so as to take a staff position at The New York Times.  I&rsquo;m sure Williams tells people from NPR, every day, to get lost, as they seek him out as a reference for more legitimate (ie, paying) work.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s funny. Liberal black commentator Juan Williams says he gets nervous when he sees people in Muslim garb on planes (like any sane person should) and gets fired. It was fanatical Muslims who attacked us, right? No one blinks an eye if they see some nuns in habits or Hasidic Jews with long side burns and skull caps on planes because these people don&rsquo;t have a practice of flying planes full of passengers into buildings. Feeling uneasy when seeing Muslims is just a natural defence mechanism. Whether they&rsquo;re in planes, subways,  shopping malls, etc. </p>

		<p>Are Moslems that bothered by this? Do moslems really listen to NPR? Instead of firing him, they should had a learning experience moment where he would realize his mistake. It would make a nice Kimbyya moment.<br/>
   Williams could have then become the best friend Moslems ever had. Now he is embittered and demands vengence.  </p>

<p>Use the race card against the muslim card. Fight liberalism with liberalism.&#8221;</p>
<p>I saw Williams appear on the O&rsquo;Reilley Factor today to discuss his firing.  As far as I remember, he didn&rsquo;t pull out the race card a single time.  But O&rsquo;Reilley, on the other hand, did bring up the fact that Williams was the only black journalist on NPR, and implied that there was racism involved in his firing.  Now, I like O&rsquo;Reilley - in fact he&rsquo;s my favorite main-stream newsman by far - but he really was silly to suggest that NPR, of all organizations, fired a man partly because of his skin color.  Of course they both pointed out that Williams&rsquo; frequent appearances on FOX may have contributed to his firing, as if NPR was just looking for an excuse these past months to fire him.</p>
<p>Say what you will about Williams, but he seems like a nice, fair-minded man to me, and to be honest I really felt bad for him watching his interview on O&rsquo;Reilley.  He looked really depressed - crushed, even.  But having just about every single person on both the left and the right publically support you isn&rsquo;t too bad at all.  This kind of publicity and simpathy is something most politicians and media personalities dream of.</p>
<p>And all here on AmRen must be celebrating at the fact that now a second major personality in the media has publically stated views that, just a week ago, would be considered terribly bigoted towards Muslims.  When Bill O&rsquo;Reilley said on Monday (I think) that &#8220;Muslims attacked us on 9/11.  We have a Muslim problem in this world,&#8221; I jumped for joy.  He may ahve been stating the obvious, but people just don&rsquo;t say these things on national television.  When he firmly stated the next day that he stands firmly by his statement, I was further elated.  And when Juan Williams, a black liberal, then came out and said the even-more-obvious but also more controversial statement that he &#8220;feels uncomfortable when he sees a Muslim on a plane,&#8221; I felt like singing in the streets.</p>

		<p>More Juan Williams funnies:</p>
<p>Within a month of ObamaCare being signed into law, he called it a &#8220;c*** sandwich.&#8221;  Five months later, he calls the some 670,000 Missourians that voted for an interpositional state law against the individual mandate of ObamaCare &#8220;nothing but a bunch of old white people.&#8221;</p>

Excuse me.  Juan Williams is a political commentator.  He is paid to be controversial.  </p>

		<p>I think y&rsquo;all are missing the point. Whether a person is &#8216;African-American,&rsquo; or &#8216;Hispanic-American&rsquo; (the two divinely &#8216;elect&rsquo; castes of  AmeriKa&rsquo;s new  STATE religion- Multiculturalism) it all falls beyond the pale of the REAL elect- the movers and shakers of the Alinsky-themed PTB in our land.</p>
<p>When I worked for NPR, I saw overt homosexuality, lesbianism, and a colleague who was a card-carrying member of the Communist Party as the F/T, with benefits positions employees- I rarely [never] saw Evangelical Christians. Lockstep liberalism as the norm for &#8216;fair and balanced&rsquo; news reporting? Yeah, sure, whatever.</p>
<p>NPR is merely the intellectual&rsquo;s variant of the big three CBS, NBC, and ABC. They all (ALL) use the same wire services, and the news is repeated over and over and over again, like a cudgel to make conformity of thought, the norm&hellip; just like in Soviet Russia.</p>
<p>Twenty years after leaving that field, I don&rsquo;t call it &#8216;National Propaganda Radio&rsquo; [NPR] for nothing. What sickens me, is that they USE classical music, as if it were THEIR heritage, when it&rsquo;s not.</p>

		<p>Lauren #14, you&rsquo;re exactly right.  The Moslems are the new darlings of the left.  They provide members who are the most anti-West, anti-Anglo, Judophobic, illiberal people on the planet  &mdash;  just what the far-left elite needs for constant mental and emotional self-flagellation!  As has been often stated, the more antisocial and criminal a group is, the more the masocistic left loves it.  Juan Williams&rsquo;s ex-boss tossed off his firing as though he&rsquo;d worn a tux to an afternoon tea and needed instruction in etiquette, though her words  &mdash;  loosely &#8220;It&rsquo;s between him and his psychiatrist or publicist or whatever&#8221;  &mdash;  sounded as catty and classless as possible.  I first thought she was going to say &#8220;between him and his God&#8221; and even had a moment when she hesitated to wonder if a far-leftie would say &#8220;God&#8221;!  Well, of course not.  Apparently, the looming Tea Party/Republican right takeover is driving liberals off the cliff like lemmings.</p>

		<p>Has anyone ever considered that the muslims who flew the planes into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, were the so called &#8220;moderate&#8221; muslims? </p>
<p>And that perhaps Bin Laden approved of this versus the &#8220;radical&#8221; muslims who instead, wanted to use nukes or chemical / biological attacks against us?</p>
<p>Might not Bin Laden have been concerned about a massive US retaliation against Mecca or Medina ( after we found out the attackers were Saudi&rsquo;s, as Bin Laden is ) in response to the latter attack?</p>
<p>70% of Americans agree that Muslims are a significant problem not only in America&hellip;.but throughout the world&hellip;.western and muslim alike.<br/>
Not matter how you slice or parse it&hellip; it was Muslims who attacked us, period. </p>
<p>It matters not whether we fool ourselves into thinking there were / are different categories of Muslims. </p>
<p>Until a time comes when we see a million muslim march down in DC, with Muslims waving American flags and singing God Bless America&hellip;.I and millions of us will remain unconvinced of their fidelity to our values and peaceful co-existence.</p>
<p>( Then there is their acceptable use of taquiya?/ lies&hellip;to convince us otherwise. They know how naive many of us are. )</p>

		<p>As a regular viewer of Fox News I&rsquo;ve found myself in constant disagreement with Mr. Williams. The evening he made the statement in question I said to my wife that is the first sensible thing I&rsquo;ve heard him ever say. He gets fired for speaking the truth for once. Since he was the only black man in prominance at NPR, where is Sharpton and NAACP?</p>

		<p>&ldquo;How many millions of Middle Class White Americans were introduced to the existence of our White Nationalism thanks to Beck? &ldquo;</p>
<p>Not me. I&rsquo;m not a fan of Beck, and I won&rsquo;t go into detail, but what introduced me to the survival of the white race was not some nostalgia for when women were &ldquo;women&rdquo; and men were &ldquo;men&rdquo; and momma made apple pie, but because our race is dying and I will not take part in our genetic and cultural genocide. Glenn Beck is often speaking of &ldquo;What happened to our country?&rdquo; and how things &ldquo;used to be&rdquo; but that sort of thinking will only kill the white race. To survive, the white race must progress, adapt, and shed the ignorance of the past and our nostalgia.  We must be open to certain aspects of progress; we must tolerate all whites, whether they be atheist, Christian, Mormon, gay, straight, male, female, liberal (excluding racial issues), conservative, etc. <br/>
We are a culturally rich and diverse people, and nostalgia will destroy any unity we may have. <br/>

		<p>There have been calls to &#8220;de-fund&#8221; NPR. What would this do ?  Would this not just give PBS and NPR to George Soros and his gang ?  The Federal Government (the taxpayer) started and funded all this with the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967; signed into law by LBJ.  Why not just dissolve the entire Federal Program including the PBS and NPR names and logos ?  Why just &#8220;de-fund&#8221; it and let some non-government entity take it over as their own ?  Let George Soros and the Left Wing start up their own radio program. </p>

		<p>Juan Williams, like Rick Sanchez, thought the melanin in his skin or his membership in a protected minority status was enough to allow him to make a few obvious remarks. But don&rsquo;t worry FOX news has already offered Juan a two million dollar contract for something or the other. It&rsquo;s amazing how even the leftist are falling on their own swords, unintentionally.  </p>

		<p>I read this in the Rocky Mountain News while back so you know it has to be be PC.</p>
<p>In 2004-05, just a few months after the Breslan &#8216;incident&rsquo; in which a bunch of Muslims butchered 300 odd kids and teachers, the brother in law of the man who owns Al Jazeera (Arab News Network) wrote an article in his own major daily newspaper in which he said- &#8220;Look people, you&rsquo;d better get your boys in a huddle and tell them the straight skinny: we are called a terrorist religion because 90 odd percent of the terrorist acts of the last 3 decades have been done by or with the aid of, Islamic terrorists.  If we don&rsquo;t get our young people away from the Imams down at the local mosques and our reputation squared away with the rest of the planet, we will _never_ get out from under this&hellip;&#8221;.</p>
<p>I figure if an Arab and a Muslim of that stature can say that Islamic nutbars are giving the rest of them a bad name, _for terrorist associated acts_, there is no harm in our saying it&rsquo;s true too.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s the truth of the modern Muslim world.  Not the viciousness of Mohammed the Prophet, 1,100 years ago.  But the world as it now is.</p>
<p>That women like Behar and Goldberg can walk away from that truth, given what Islam does to dehumanize theur gender, deny them social empowerment via public travel, make them dress like walking tents and oh yes _beat and kill them when they disobey_, is particularly unamusing in it&rsquo;s hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Because they would be the first one&rsquo;s on a plane to anywhere if they were Islamic women in an Islamic country with &#8216;Western&rsquo; attitudes of holier than thou ethics.  Except, in an Islamic country, they wouldn&rsquo;t have any money nor be allowed to buy a plane ticket if a man wasn&rsquo;t along to give permission.</p>
<p>In this, you have to realize that the main reason that white male wisdom is despised these days is because conservatism and centuries of accumulated skills in The Way Of The World have taught us certain truths which are hard for other groups to acknowledge as joan-come-lately&rsquo;s.  It is an ethnic and gender driven territorialism we face here, trying to stake out it&rsquo;s own ground with a dogma of &#8216;If you don&rsquo;t own the guys&rsquo; truth, patent and franchise an opposed lie&rsquo;.  As social power base.</p>

		<p>Think about this. If these same words had been uttered by a white person, he/she would have been called a racist, a bigot and had their career destroyed. Since it was a minority who uttered these words, it&rsquo;s suddenly a freedom of speech issue and Fox gives him a contract and a raise. Double standard anyone?</p>

		<p>This is ridiculous.  Mr. Williams was simply stating what EVERYONE of EVERY RACE/ETHNICITY (probably even non-religious Arabs) thinks when they are on a plane and see someone who is dressed in traditional Islamic garb.  Hell, I don&rsquo;t even like to see that in the mall or at the grocery store, let alone on a plane, but at least in the mall or grocery store, I can choose to leave and shop somewhere else. That kind of dress IMMEDIATELY telegraphs the following regarding the wearers:  &#8220;Hi, I&rsquo;m a Muslim who hates the West, Jews, and women.  I may even have had my daughter&rsquo;s genitals mutilated so that she is good &#8216;marriage material&rsquo;. I also have no problem being a suicide bomber and killing innocents simply for being non-Muslim.&#8221;  With common beliefs such as those, it is a PERFECTLY RATIONAL response to people who dress that way.  What in the heck is wrong with people nowadays?!  </p>

<p>Yes, JG. Absolutely right. And it was 15 years ago. Now ask yourself this: is there any political or social opinion you held 15 years ago that you have changed since then? I cannot and will not speak for you because I do not know you, but I assure you there are plenty of Amren folks who have had such changes of view in that time. I am one of them.</p>

<p>Most infidels do not know that while the Koran proclaims &#8220;peace&#8221; in its early passages, conquest and war supersede it.  The way the Koran is set up, the later passages take precedence over (and nullify)the earlier passages.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s just human nature.  Most people want to be lead, and most of our people, who have no real political or media leadership, so desire actualization from &#8220;famous&#8221; people that they&rsquo;ll grasp at any tangent to think that someone is &#8220;secretly&#8221; on our side, just to justify themselves.</p>
<p>However, I feel no such need.  I&rsquo;m right, you&rsquo;re right, we&rsquo;re right.  And we don&rsquo;t need any phony wearing phony coke-bottle glasses scribbling on a chalkboard to justify ourselves.  This is why I&rsquo;m happy about the concept of the Tea Party Movement (but certainly not the political reality of certain factions, e.g. Dick Armey)   &mdash;   What makes me happy is the open source form of organization, i.e. people aren&rsquo;t waiting around for leaders, they&rsquo;re leading themselves.</p>

		<p>What is all this love affair with Juan Willimas? I never could stand that racist black &#8220;journalist&#8221;. I have seen him many times denounce Whites collectively as racists. He is your typical black racist. The only reason Fox and O&rsquo;Reilly are defending him is because he is a BLACK LIBERAL and got fired from the LIBERAL media! I have never seen Fox defend any White person who dares speaks the truths about blacks, mexicans,illegals, muslims or any other minority group. All they do is call them Nazis, White Supremacists, biots and racist!  Fox can shove it. Now they are giving ole Juan even more $$$?  </p>
<p>BTW, Juan there are many BLACK muslims in America. Guess he never thought about that one. </p>
