<h1><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/oct/11/black-prison-population-increase-england">More Black People Jailed in England and Wales Proportionally Than in US</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Randeep Ramesh, The Guardian (London), October 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The proportion of black people in prison in England and Wales is higher than in the United States, a landmark report released today by the Equality and Human Rights Commission reveals.</p>
<p>The commission&rsquo;s first triennial report into the subject, How Fair is Britain, shows that the proportion of people of African-Caribbean and African descent incarcerated here is almost seven times greater to their share of the population. In the United States, the proportion of black prisoners to population is about four times greater.</p>
<p>The report, which aims to set out how to measure &#8220;fairness&#8221; in Britain, says that ethnic minorities are &#8220;substantially over-represented in the custodial system&#8221;. It suggests many of those jailed have &#8220;mental health issues, learning disabilities, have been in care or experienced abuse&#8221;.</p>
<p>Experts and politicians said over-representation of black men was a result of decades of racial prejudice in the criminal justice system and an overly punitive approach to penal affairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;People will be and should be shocked by this data,&#8221; said Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust. &#8220;We have a tendency to say we are better than the US, but we have not got prison right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lyon said that although there had been &#8220;numerous efforts to address racism in the prison system &hellip; we have yet to get a better relationship between justice authorities and black communities. Instead we have ended up with mistrust breeding mistrust.&#8221;</p>
<p>Evidence of this damaged relationship can be found in the commission&rsquo;s report. On the streets, black people were subjected to what the report describes as an &#8220;excess&#8221; of 145,000 stop and searches in 2008. It notes that black people constitute less than 3% of the population, yet made up 15% of people stopped by police.</p>
<p>The commission found that five times more black people than white people per head of population in England and Wales are imprisoned. The ethnic minority prison population has doubled in a decade  &mdash;  from 11,332 in 1998 to 22,421 in 2008. Over a similar period, the overall number of prisoners rose by less than two thirds. The commission says that the total number of people behind bars accelerated in the last decade despite &#8220;a similar number of crimes being reported to the police as in the early 1990s .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the volume of indictable offences has fallen over this time&#8221;.</p>
<p>A quarter of the people in prison are from an ethnic minority. Muslims now make up 12% of the prison population in England and Wales.</p>
<p>Some on the left of the Labour party blame its policies while in power. Diane Abbott, who raised the alarm over the growing numbers of jailed black men as a backbencher, said she &#8220;very much regretted that the last Labour government swallowed [former home secretary] Michael Howard&rsquo;s line that &#8216;prison works&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was never a serious examination of the consequences of locking up a generation of young black men. The result is there are some prisons in the south east which are now virtually all black. Many are converting to Islam.&#8221;</p>
<p>The problems may start at school. The commission points out that black children are three times as likely to be permanently excluded from education.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are reaping the effects of criminalising a community in the 1970s,&#8221; says Ben Bowling, professor of criminal justice at Kings College London and a former adviser to the home affairs select committee.</p>
<p>&#8220;The question is how you break the cycle when young men experience custody. Three quarters simply re-offend. We have to intervene with families more effectively to stop kids going to prison. That means looking at school exclusions. You need to deal with issues like mental health and substance abuse. It is not enough to throw our hands in the air.&#8221;</p>
<p>The policies implemented in the last decade mean incarceration levels in Britain are now among the highest in western Europe. England and Wales have an imprisonment rate of 155 per 100,000 and Scotland of 149 per 100,000 of the population. This contrasts with rates of less than 100 per 100,000 for most of Britain&rsquo;s neighbours.</p>
<p>The commission also warns of the rising numbers of women in jails. It says that the &#8220;number of women prisoners has nearly doubled since 1995 in England and Wales, and since 2000 in Scotland  &mdash;  currently around 5% of prisoners are women&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Justice said that the government would not comment on individual portions of the report.<br>

		<p>Having spent many years in both the UK and USA I can honestly say that UK blacks are far worse than American blacks in terms of attitude and behaviour. That may come as a shock to Americans seeing as US blacks leave an awful lot to be desired, but I felt much safer walking in Harlem than I ever did in black infested parts of London. The high rate of incareration for UK blacks is solely due to their aggressive attitude and inability to excercise the slightest bit of self-control, either emotionally, physically, mentally or sexually. If racism is to blame then why are incarceration rates for Hindus, Sikhs, and Chinese so low??? Extreme Leftists like Diane Abbott dont have a leg to stand on!</p>

		<p>I think however the US jails people longer for the same offense than England. That accounts for the crime drop rate in the US, even as more blacks embrace hip hop culture and forego education for crime. The message is to lenghthen sentences for all violent crimes and major drug deals. That eliminates the worry of liberals that you are criminalizing  a population like blacks. Who cares? Let them criminalize all they want in prison. England seemed to treat the white Irish IRA fighters harshly; the immgirant thugs are imprisoned, quickly released, and quickly strike again.Prisons do pay for themselves if you put the truly violent away for good, saving society vast sums in economic and psychological damages.</p>

<p>This is absolutely not true. Reality is quite the reverse, at least in the USA. White criminals are much more likely to be caught and then punished. </p>

		<p>The differentce in incarceration rates between US and British blacks is not difficult to explain.</p>
<p>Blacks in the US have some white genes and their average IQ is 85 (the average white IQ is 100).<br>
 <br>
Blacks in Britain are from Africa and have few, if any, white genes, and their average IQ is 70.</p>

		<p>Having to house all of these colored criminals is another millstone around the neck of the white race.  But for the huge cost of dealing with the colored criminals, we could keep all of the bad white people in prison for the time they earned committing their crime(s). As it is, this expense contributes to denying the white race the much better world that we would create with it just being all white. </p>

<p>If you deported them, there would have been NO consquences.  If you kept them in jail, there would be NO consequences.  That you release them back into society when you KNOW that they will re-offend is a crime and whoever engineered and carries out these policies are CRIMINALS against the people of England and Wales.</p>
<p>And so for all governemnts that continue to abuse their populations with overwhelming immigration and lax solutions.</p>

		<p>I believe that a solution can be worked out.  As long as blacks only do crimes against other blacks, do not arrest them or send them to jail.  Just make a note of it in a file somewhere and forget about it.</p>
<p>This way you can avoid accusations of racism by police, the courts, etc.  </p>
<p>After all, many liberals assert that blacks are not really responsible for their behavior due to racism permeating every aspect of their lives from cradle to grave.</p>
<p>For that matter, if the blacks do crimes against self-identified white liberals, let them off also!  We&rsquo;ve seen enough white victims of crime making excuses after excuses for the criminals who robbed/raped/killed loved ones.</p>

		<p>The reason why blacks in the UK represent a greater percentage of the overall prison population isn&rsquo;t because the British authorities have &#8220;criminalized&#8221; the black community. There are no other minority groups making up a large enough chunk of the prison population (i.e. hispanics) to skew the percentages.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;Lyon said that although there had been &ldquo;numerous efforts to address racism in the prison system &hellip; we have yet to get a better relationship between justice authorities and black communities. Instead we have ended up with mistrust breeding mistrust.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Why do the British never show any kind of skepticism when this  hocus pocus is spit out by professors, politicians, and bureaucrats, especially when the U.S. has undergone all of this before? I know leftism has deeper roots in Europe than the US, but I thought recent American history was a pretty obvious warning to whites with any common sense. I think part of this naivity results from lack of experience with minorities. An arrogant attitude that a morally superior Britain could succede where the US failed seems to make up the other part.</p>

<p>There was never a serious examination of the consequences of bringing tens of thousands of young black men into Britain without asking the indigenes. Govts. only had to look at Kingston in Jamaica where the vast majority came from, or Africa from where they originated to see the unacceptable behavioural patterns.  Crime in these other places is rampant, murder, rape, robbery and promiscuity are undeniably higher. Africans traditionally were kept under control by Mugabe type thugs, called &#8216;chiefs&rsquo; back then; when Western behavioural standards were expected they failed to live up to them, and we were blamed. Its not a blame game, they are just different and the differences should be taken into account when deciding where they live. All peoples have different standards, but forcing vastly differing cultural groups to live together always necessitates one group&rsquo;s behaviour to become unacceptable.  When Britain is eventually fully ruled by Sharia Law, then current White British behaviour, binge drinking, promiscuity, homosexuality etc. will become criminal behaviour. Ironically it could well be the Blacks be doing the arresting, as according to this report they&rsquo;re the ones converting to Islam.<br>

		<p>I am old enough to remember a time in the UK when certain members of the chattering classes just loved to show their &#8216;moral superiority&rsquo; over Americans by regularly pontificating about &#8216;how badly America treats its blacks&rsquo; and the massive incarceration differential was regularly cited as &#8216;proof&rsquo;.Now these people can enjoy their own little race problem at their leisure.<br>
 On another point, it&rsquo;s all more grist to the mill of J. Phillipe Rushton and his theory that racial crime rates remain constant irrespective of the society.</p>

		<p>The Guardian is always telling us that multiracial Britain is a great thing. If this is a &#8216;success&rsquo; then what would a failure look like? Why is Britain better off for having a black criminal underclass when there wasn&rsquo;t one 50 years ago?</p>
<p>The Left seem to think that blaming black underachievement on &#8216;racism&rsquo; somehow shifts the blame onto the Right and insulates their multiracial policies from critism. They actually point to the failings of multiracialism as an argument for more multiracialism. It&rsquo;s like trying to cure lung cancer by smoking more cigarettes.</p>

		<p>An neighbor of mine&rsquo;s friend who is a casino worker in Atlantic City was leaving work at 5:30 a.m. three days ago and went up to the parking garage where he found himself surrounded by ten &#8220;youfs&#8221;, five on either side of him.  They began beating him severely. He said it was providential that his wallet fell out on the ground and the blacks broke off the attack and fled with it. He said that he felt as though this were the end for him.  ACPD managed to catch two of them and they in turn gave up the other eight. He said some of them looked to be no more than 14. They&rsquo;ll serve little to no time, probably at Harborfields Youth Correctional Facility in Atlantic County and they&rsquo;ll be back out on the streets. The man will not be able to return to work for at least a week and meanwhile the &#8220;youfs&#8221; have his ID, address etc.</p>
<p>Any South Jersey residents please contact State Senator Jeff Van Drew and support his bill to expand the access to Concealed Carry permit in New Jersey. AC has laid off some 40 policemen and things are going to get worse. This Bill requires applicants to have training in safe gun usage and in self defensive strategies including range time. <br>
Van Drew is a Democrat but he supports the 2nd and that all that we need to know. </p>

		<p>I reckon there are two types of liberals, the delusional, self-hating whites who eagerly quaff the kool-aid, and the cynical culture-distorters who serve it up. Given the militancy of Britain&rsquo;s race-traitors, I am surprised that they have not devised a scheme whereby their criminal blacks are given a &#8220;get-out-of-jail-free&#8221; card, or, alternately, a system by which large groups of random, but &#8220;implicitly racist,&#8221; whites are incarcerated to achieve &#8220;fairness.&#8221; Down the rabbit-hole, Blighty!

		<p>With slight variations the longer a racial group has practiced an urban based civilization the lower its crime rate will be.  This is because the criminal justice system of a civilized nation gradually removes those with a predisposition toward crime from the gene pool.   </p>

		<p>To Madison Grant (re post # 13):</p>
<p>Paisan, you took the words out of my mouth. I&rsquo;ll bet African Bantus in China, Japan, France, Russia, and Brazil are jailed at higher rates than the native, non-Bantu populations of those countries. Why? Because of the crimes they commit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that there are Bantus who engage in drug-dealing in China. Then, they have the cajones to cry &#8220;police repression&#8221;, and &#8220;racism&#8221;.</p>
<p>To Anonymous (re post # 10):</p>
<p>I think also, that Europeans&rsquo; views of Bantus have been largely shaped by the likes of &#8220;The Cosby Show&#8221;, &#8220;Good Times&#8221;, and NBA basketball. They still deny what we in the USA have known for a long time about Bantus and crime. </p>

		<p>Part of the reason might be that Hispanics and Whites are often combined in to one category, thereby lowering the difference between black - white crime in the US.  I would be willing to bet that should Hispanic be counted separately, the white - black difference in the US would be slightly greater than the UK.  </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because we ALSO have hispanics over-represented in our prisons.  If Britain imported a bunch of mestizos from Central America, they&rsquo;d have another crime wave; the black-proportion prison figures would adjust as the prisons expanded.  </p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t smugly assume that Americans are the only people who can see what&rsquo;s happening - you&rsquo;ll be speaking Spanish before Sharia takes over in Europe.</p>

		<p>Anonymous - &#8220;An arrogant attitude that a morally superior Britain could succede where the US failed seems to make up the other part.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget that your experience of Blacks is much longer. Britain had no Blacks to speak of until the &#8220;Empire Windrush&#8221; arrived from the Caribbean in 1948. Since they came here voluntarily, not as slaves, it was assumed that integration would follow. Naive maybe, but a very different historical background.</p>
