<h1>Black People :(</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert Lindsay, Robert Lindsay, October 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>There are certain things that White people just absolutely cannot stand about Black people. I suppose I mean a certain type of White person (like me), and of course I refer to a certain type of Black person. I realize that there are now &#8220;Whites&#8221; who think this kind of Black behavior is cool.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This morning, I had my windows open (bad idea).</p>
<p>I heard &#8220;kids fighting&#8221; outside my window. It went on and on for way too long. There was an unpleasant aura of menace about it. You don&rsquo;t hear this sort of vibe around here too much because Mexicans don&rsquo;t usually act like this unless it is groups of teens or young men (gang types) fighting or menacing each other. Believe it or not, that&rsquo;s a rather rare occurrence here. And that only happens at night anyway, usually around 8-10 PM.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I went to the window, and it was nothing. Two young Black women, apparently single Moms or babysitting for kids. One Black single Mom with an elementary school girl who was beating up on a much younger elementary school boy. Another Black woman holding the baby. The women yelling at and chasing the kids, on and on. Everyone was speaking in a very loud tone of voice, much too loud. {snip}</p>
<p>Later, I heard more &#8220;fighting.&#8221; It had the same vibe about it, an aura of menace combined with way too loud voices and the sound of people arguing or fighting. Once again, I was alarmed by the menacing vibes and went to check. I was surprised to find a young Black woman and a young Black man, both in their 20s. The man had a pit bull with him. From the sound of their way too loud voices and the tone, it seemed like an argument. It took just a bit for me to figure out that this was apparently just a pleasant conversation between friends! {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some of my Black commenters seem to hate Underclass Blacks more than I do. I don&rsquo;t necessarily hate them; they&rsquo;re just sort of repellent, and I want to avoid them. {snip}</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;m not sure about the usual Black rejoinder that plenty of Whites act this way too. But they don&rsquo;t, you see. Sure, there are Whites who act bad, but they act bad more or less in &#8220;White ways.&#8221; There are almost zero Whites who habitually act the way that these Blacks above do. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This is one of those things about Blacks that we really, really, really don&rsquo;t like!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if it&rsquo;s a direct refutation of everything that White culture is about.</p>
<p>I call this meaninglessly loud and menacing behavior &#8220;the casual violence of everyday life&#8221; among Underclass Blacks. It&rsquo;s part of their quotidian existence, like shaving or getting out of bed. So normal it&rsquo;s almost boring.<br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t even want to try to cope with this kind of an enviroment.  It can&rsquo;t be handled logically; this situation is like herding cats - impossible.  This is why I live in a nice quiet 95% white area.  The only answer to racial problems is segregation, at least partial segregation.  </p>

		<p>It is the number of what are called &#8220;senseless&#8221; crimes that most repels whites.</p>
<p>An argument over a cigarette, a quarter, a parking space, a &#8220;look&#8221; and someone is dead in the proverbial heartbeat.</p>
<p>&#8220;a direct refutation of everything that White culture is about&#8221;</p>
<p>And not necessarily unintentionally so. To what degree intentionally so is questionable, but it is just that intentionally, at least to some degree.</p>

		<p>I can remember growing up when we Whites used to whisper in each others ears&hellip;I remember when Whites hated loud noises and crowds. I remember when Whites loved to reflect and loved serenity. </p>
<p>We all know that blacks have never had any of these traits and never will. They love noise, chaos, confusion and everything Whites hate.</p>

		<p> Indeed. I&rsquo;ve noticed for many years that many (not all) blacks tend to talk, or rather yell, in stentorian tones when it&rsquo;s not at all necessary or appropriate.</p>
<p> I remember some type of a newspaper piece I read once, years ago, describing a poll of White students in some high school which revealed that it was accepted fact among them that blacks tended to (a) talk loud and (b) laugh a lot. For holding such &#8220;racist&#8221; views, the White students were condemned to some type of consciousness-raising training, or some such nonsense.</p>
<p> Here is something that all European and East Asian-descended peoples should keep in mind: Our remote ancestors &#8220;camd out&#8221; of Africa, and over the millennia, evolved in various ways. Black Africans &#8220;stayed in&#8221; Africa (excepting those that Arab and White slave traders foolishly foisted on the rest of the world), and thus have evolved little since the great &#8220;parting of the races.&#8221; That explains a lot, doesn&rsquo;t it? </p>

		<p>I used the screen name &#8220;FrankBD&#8221; on that site, so I&rsquo;ll repeat here the comment I posted there:</p>
<p>Probably the stupidest idea yet to gain common currency is that residential neighborhoods need diversity. I can see where public-contact employees might need to represent the community, like police officers or salesmen. But a residential neighborhood is supposed to consist of people with common expectations of community behavior. Diversity is not a strength if singles want to stay up partying at night while parent are putting kids to bed; or children want to ride bikes on the same sidewalks senior use.</p>
<p>Do you think the residents of a quiet residential street do or should value the diversity of rap music blaring from rolled-down car windows?  Why shouldn&rsquo;t everyone live in a setting of their cultural group: Mexicans, Koreans, Muslims, Jews can have their own neighborhoods where their expectations are dominant?<br>

		<p>Far to many interactive connections with Blacks have an undercurrent of violence. If one were to mix Blacks with Mexicans, and with an equal measure of cute hot girls and alcohol, there would be an explosion; guaranteed! That is just the way life is!</p>
<p>My personal opinion is that Black males have a higher level of testosterone than do their White counterparts and clearly their Asian counterparts. Low class Black females are content with the concept of recreational sex and disposable romances since the product from these liaisons are governmentally supported. </p>
<p>The standard is simply different. Whites feel an inordinate obligation to care and support these illegitimate children since &#8220;they are innocent&#8221;! These so called mothers drop out these kids annually and receive governmental support for the next eighteen years. This is reality. This also needs to stop!      </p>
<p>In my view the day that subsidies are no longer being paid to support these children is the day that these conflicts will begin to cease! </p>
<p>And, it will happen and soon. We are heading into the next great depression and irrespective of how liberals want the rest of us to spend our money there simply will not be enough money to spend. Eventually, blacks will have to fend for themselves. </p>
<p>Consequently, these arguing Blacks will soon be burning your neighbourhood!</p>

		<p>Blacks are just emotionally immature, period.  You can understand blacks more readily if you imagine what they&rsquo;re saying or doing emanating from a 13 or 14 year old white boy or girl.  When you see a black couple fighting loudly on the street, just think of junior high and it will seem almost normal.  Blacks and young teenagers share a lack of impulse control.</p>

		<p>This may be one of the most &#8216;racist&rsquo; articles to appear on AmRen. The irony being discovering negative traits to whites is considered &#8216;enlightenment&rsquo; and higher learning. That, and racial attacks against whites occur many times more often than the reverse. One might make the argument that discrimination travels only in one direction also.  </p>

<p>I have a similar opinion. I don&rsquo;t hate blacks I just hate being around them. These people were born to talk loud and make noise. They can&rsquo;t have a conversation between two people without everyone in a half-block radius turn their heads to see what the shouting is all about. These people can have extended &#8216;conversations&rsquo; shouting to each other from across the street. Of course, when you turn to look, they give you the &#8216;wha chew lookin at&rsquo; look.</p>
<p>I have little respect for people who don&rsquo;t respect personal or community standards. It&rsquo;s no surprise to me that it&rsquo;s common for arguments to escalate into fights in black neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Have any of you had the experience of being in a room with blacks or having them &#8216;conversing&rsquo; in a hallway? It&rsquo;s just a free for all shouting match. I don&rsquo;t know if they do it to tick off white people (though I strongly suspect they do it as a way of provoking confrontations) or if it reflects their natural communication skills.</p>
<p>Why they do it is inconsequential. It&rsquo;s just one of the reasons I make the effort to avoid blacks.</p>
<p>Like the author of this piece, I can get along with self-respecting blacks on an individual level but I keep such interactions pleasant but short. </p>

		<p>From my years of attending a mixed-race high school, I think I may know what this guy is talking about. I remember the &#8220;trash talk&#8221; among blacks to each other outside while waiting for the schoolbus or for the doors to open: &#8220;Cool up, mofo! I&rsquo;ma hit you upside yo&rsquo; head with a brick!&#8221; I don&rsquo;t remember it being extremely loud or menacing, but then, it wasn&rsquo;t exactly quiet either!</p>

From the sound of their way too loud voices and the tone, it seemed like an argument. It took just a bit for me to figure out that this was apparently just a pleasant conversation between friends!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laughably, this fellow seems to not really have a full grasp of just how common such behavior is among blacks, and the fact that they do not have to be members of the &ldquo;underclass&rdquo; to act in this manner. Loud and &ldquo;colorful&rdquo; self-expressions are the norm for them, regardless of having considerable expertise in street pharmaceutical sales or a PhD in economics from Harvard.</p>
<p>A good (and also humorous) example of this, was the young black couple that lived in an apartment next to mine about 5 years ago. Always pleasant to me and dressed like normal people for the most part when I saw them, one would never have suspected them to be the same foulmouthed and hideously raucous guttersnipes that they were when alone together at home and so lovingly &ldquo;communicating&rdquo; to each other. You see, I could hear them through the heating vents in my kitchen and laundry room; I have never thought that so much profanity and threats of violence, could be so amusing, but they were. The first time I heard their bombastically vocalized &ldquo;sweet nothings,&rdquo; I was sure that someone might be going to the hospital and almost called the police. However, as I had not heard anything indicating pain or suchlike, I figured it best to stay my hand; this was likely a good idea, since when next I saw them they were the same friendly and propitious black urban professionals that I always saw leaving for work in the morning daily. Indeed: no bruises, no gashes, no toe tags.</p>
<p>Long story short, I was glad that I stayed my hand regarding the above because this was the norm for about two months. You see the building was new and we were the only two tenants in that area for about half a year. Then, some new people came that summer, one of which was a very liberal looking (and given the bumper-stickers on her car, socially activist) young white harpy. Well, she must have heard the &ldquo;love talk&rdquo; between these two one night and did call the cops. He spent the night in jail from what I later learned and then they left the building shortly after that.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism at its finest and only for the price of rent in a reasonably &ldquo;good&rdquo; community environment!</p>

		<p>Actually, I believe that there is a class component to this. In fact, Mr. lindsay states this in his article. In almost every instance, whenever I have been in the presence of upscale Blacks, ( the sideny Poitier, Cliff and Claire Huxtable types),I have found them to be well behaved. </p>
<p>It is the lower income Blacks and working class Blacks that are almost nigthmarish to deal with! Loud, combative, suspicious, paranoid, in some cases, violent etc&hellip; However, I can say that I have has similar experiences with some lower income Whites and Hispancis as well.   </p>

<p>I post on Linday&rsquo;s site more often then here, partly because it&rsquo;s not moderated so the discussion flows more freely.  Lindsay, like me, calls himself a &#8220;liberal race realist&#8221; and I think that&rsquo;s my political inclination, too.</p>
<p>This comment could get too long, so let me summarize just a few points and being a liberal and pro-Amren:<br>
1) Liberal race realism was America&rsquo;s dominant philosophy from the mid 30s-mid 60s.  As Jared T sometimes points out, it was so implicit in American culture that there wasn&rsquo;t even a term for it.<br>
2) I consider race issues to have ruined liberalism.  A generous safety net can work in a culture in which everyone shares the same values, and it&rsquo;s possible to design a welfare system of which you can be confident people won&rsquo;t abuse.  <br>
3)  Minorities are not present in liberal causes that don&rsquo;t benefit them, like environmental protection or abortion rights.  </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an article in the Archives from April 2000 called &#8220;Don&rsquo;t write off the liberals&#8221; that&rsquo;s worth keeping in mind.</p>

		<p>Twice when I was the victim of a violent crime I was asked, &#8220;Were they black?&#8221;<br>
 <br>
The second person who asked was himself black.  Those reading this comment know what my answer was.  The second person told me that he would cross the street to avoid young black men he does not know.  So do I.<br>
 <br>
I like every black person I know, including him.  Nevertheless, I have learned that there was a lot of folk wisdom in stereotypes I was taught by my parents to reject when I was a child.  Stereotypes are over generalizations, but they are over generalizations of what is often true.  </p>

		<p>Actually, as some of our fellow Amren posters have mentioned in the past, there are two Black Americas. One that is prosperous, thriving and upwardly mobile. </p>
<p>Quite frankly, the same can be said on a smaller scale in regards to Whites. There are a number of Whites whose behavior, speech patterns, body size etc&hellip; is rapidly emulating that of lower income Blacks and Hispanics. By this I mean how are Whites like Dog The Bounty Hunter, Kid Rock etc&hellip; any different than a large number of lower income Blacks?</p>

<p>As for loud, self-centered, and overall odd behaviour, it is clearly a genetic trait of little value in an advanced society. Besides allowing no time for thought or reflection the vocal battles prevent any real communication. This might have some value in the jungle so, accordingly, that&rsquo;s why blacks turn their communities into jungles.</p>

		<p>All to true.  I know a lot of wonderful blacks, and sometimes I even enjoy their culture, but when they get into groups - oh my God, its scary.  About 95% of blacks act &#8220;ghetto&#8221; when they get into a big group with their fellow blacks.  Even if they normally act more &#8220;white&#8221; when around white people.  Its a strange phenomenon, I guess it has something to do with socialogical tendencies to conform to one&rsquo;s own group, or something.</p>

		<p>Yes, Blacks are loud.  There is a book called &#8220;Why Black People Tend to Shout&#8221;, by a Black named Ralph Wiley.  I&rsquo;m not recommending the book, just pointing out that Black noisemaking is commonly known to those who have spent time around them.  <br>

		<p>As a renter, I&rsquo;ve often lived in mixed neighborhoods throughout the years, having been neighbors with both blacks and whites here in So. Cal.</p>
<p>I agree with the comments above regarding the decibel levels exhibited by black neighbors, but have also experienced the same thing from Hispanic neighbors.  </p>
<p>Neither group seems to care about how much inconvenience they cause their neighbors. </p>
<p>When I go out to buffet restaurants (or to Wal-Marts), Hispanics in particular are rude, in that they allow their children to run around and scream like maniacs.</p>
<p>Although tonight I went to the mall on one of my rare trips to that part of town (looking for a decent haircut).  Some black guy was standing next to a double stroller with two little kids in it, and he didn&rsquo;t bother to shush either of the little maniacs while they screamed  &mdash;  especially a little boy who had really ear-piercing shrieks. </p>
<p>I usually try to do my shopping, when possible, at 3:00 a.m., because that is when most of these morons are asleep in bed (both the alleged adults and their offspring).</p>
<p>Makes me glad I have cats instead of children. </p>

		<p>I agree completely with the author. The all too common rejoinder to black violence is that &#8220;some whites also behave this way,&#8221; but I have never actually witnessed this  &mdash;  at least not to the extent that it is claimed. As somebody who grew up in a working class household, I can honestly state that &#8220;underclass&#8221; whites do not even remotely exhibit the same anti-social behavioural problems that blacks do. It is true that many poor white youths attempt to emulate black &#8220;culture,&#8221; but that is only on a superficial level, never to the extent of recurring violent criminal behaviour. </p>
<p>Black impropriety is far more comprehensive and ingrained within their culture, whereas white misconduct is usually individualistic. It is also possible to argue that blacks and whites differ in the conduct of criminal activities, since black tend to be much more aggressive and ruthless. How often do we read news headlines about a white male who was charged with throwing acid in his girlfriend&rsquo;s face, or a white mother who beat her infant child to death because she continued to cry, or prostituted her child, or placed her baby in a microwave, or a young white male who assaulted an elderly couple, or raping an elderly woman?</p>

		<p>Many of these traits can be positively valued: </p>
<p>impulsivity become &ldquo;spontaneity,&rdquo; speaking loudly with wild gestures becomes a more &ldquo;expressive&rdquo; way of talking, et cetera.</p>
<p>Beginning in the 1960s, white Americans began to consciously imitate black behavior.</p>
<p>This phenomenon has spread across the world: while blacks express their hatred of America by converting to Islam, European Muslims express their alienation toward European society by imitating the clothes, gestures, and language of hip-hop culture, and a lot of young white Europeans are following suit:</p>
<p>they seem to have no access to their own cultural heritage, apparently it is easier to pick up the flotsam and jetsam of other people&rsquo;s cultures from the mass media and mimic it.</p>
<p>The fact that blacks and white or different is not the problem.</p>
<p>The fact that whites would choose to imitate a less successful, less-developed, a dysfunctional culture is.</p>
<p>the topic of white imitating blacks should be the topic of a special AMREN issue.</p>

		<p>Being a white woman having retired and living in a mixed race community the &#8220;diversity&#8221; has been far from refreshing. Going out on my porch and having shouted at me by blacks &#8220;Kiss my a__, that&rsquo;s right, I said it!&#8221; or &#8220;I&rsquo;ll have to go on over there and visit her.&#8221; or &#8220;Hey, put on some clothes!&#8221; if I&rsquo;m in my house dress.</p>
<p>I agree with #8. Blacks are emotionally immature and demand everyone&rsquo;s attention. I do not give the idiots around me the pleasure of a response. That being said, with the bad treatment I have received from them, if they were in real trouble I would NOT lift a finger to help. Not even to dial 911. I don&rsquo;t believe in rewarding bad behavior.</p>
<p>THEY know they&rsquo;re ignorant, loud and obnoxious. They know when to turn it on and off. Like #14&rsquo;s story of the seemingly normal, professional black couple. The blacks living around me do not say things to me if other people are visibly around. And I&rsquo;m sure the cowards wouldn&rsquo;t be doing it if I were male. Which only goes to show they can control themselves and act properly, but choose not to. Or how else could they show their hatred for whitey? Oh, and their children are right there listening to them. So they are also carefully teaching them this bad behavior and hatred for white people.</p>

This passage is from the Comments section. The following comments are those of the author, Robert Lindsay&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Well, OK, then I&rsquo;m classist and racist, no problem. </i></p>
<p><i>I don&rsquo;t know about this &ldquo;culture of poverty&rdquo; stuff. We have Blacks, White and Hispanics (mostly Mexicans) around here. You can hear them outside my window all day long. They are all poor or low income. The Whites are almost silent. The Mexicans, well, you can hear them, but Mexicans are generally *quiet*. There is a quietness about them. Now these Whites and Mexicans are just as poor as those Blacks, but they don&rsquo;t act like that.</i></p>
<p><i>What&rsquo;s going on?</i></p>
<p><i>What&rsquo;s with the menacing undertone? When I get vibes like that from the Mexicans around here, I think there&rsquo;s going to be a gang fight, and I&rsquo;m afraid. With the Blacks, it&rsquo;s just normal quotidian existence.</i></p>
<p>This guy, like AR readers, does see the differences between blacks and whites and he freely admits being affected by them. He also doesn&rsquo;t seem to accept the politically correct explanations that black pathology is driven by poverty.</p>
<p>What is telling is that although he wants to understand why blacks and whites behave differently, he can&rsquo;t make the logical leap that blacks and whites might be inherently different.</p>

Many of us who admire European Social Democracy have noticed that it only seems to work in countries where the vast majority of the population is white.  I am confident that it would work for Orientals.<br>
 <br>
In the United States in the late 1960s, as welfare became more generous and easier to qualify for, millions of blacks went on welfare, even though unemployment was reaching historically low levels.  They knew they were incapable of achieving for themselves the good life, and opted for the easy life.  Whites and Orientals seldom think that way.  </p>

		<p>The author brings up a really good point.  I live on a fairly busy street in the city with lots of foot traffic.  I will often hear what instinctively sounds like a fight or confrontation and investigate.  It always turns out it&rsquo;s a group of blacks; sometimes fighting, sometimes just conversing as they walk by.  </p>
<p>The strange thing is that it is very difficult to tell whether it is a joyful or potentially violent confrontation.  That is never the case with other races that pass by.</p>

<p>The Whites who fled their old neighborhoods to get away from the disruptive and dangerous  behavior of invading Blacks know exactly why they don&rsquo;t want Blacks in their new neighborhoods. Their opinions are based upon their experiences with Blacks, not upon something they learned from a ranting racist.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s keep those Section 8 vouchers flowing. I want every White American to bathe in the joys of Black culture. I want the safety and comfort of every White American family to be dependent upon the assault rifle and  the stack of fully-loaded, high-capacity clips sitting next to dad&rsquo;s chair.

		<p>Re 25<br>
Blacks are stuck in the world of their oral tradition; for them, words are display. Since no written language evolved in Africa I think it is proper to conclude the mentality wasn&rsquo;t, and isn&rsquo;t, there.<br>
When I see a black urbanite waling down the street yapping into a cell phone, I don&rsquo;t get the feeling the human is connected to the culture in the sense of, say, a white person talking on one, or typing, or riding a motorcycle, or operating a combine in the fields. That is because there is an underlying feeling the operator of the device could understand the physics and chemistry behind the functioning of the device. There is a certain congruence between the operator and the instrument. There is a feeling of progress having been made.<br>
I have the uneasy feeling the black guy, if typical, has absolutely no idea what is powering the device he is talking into, nor even a very real connection to it. It is just another piece of magic.<br>
The electronics revolution seems to be a cause for regression in black America, with less civility and even less comprehension than before.</p>

		<p>As a young person just out of a bad marriage I rented an apartment in a cheap and slightly run down part of Oklahoma City. I was told that the one bedroom apartments were &#8220;all adult&#8221; but that did not stop my obnoxious black next door neighbors partying just about every weekend. As someone who worked a different schedule as just about everyone else, I needed my sleep. The partying would start about 5pm on Friday night- just as I would get to work. The noise was still at full tilt when I would get home some time around 3am. After a short lull the music would start at the same ear shattering volumn around noon. Often this would go on until midnight on Sunday night. This would often happen midweek too. After calling the police several times the noisy bunch was evicted. I have also had the unpleasant experiances of being at a work training session where the blacks began loudly and in chorus asking nuisance questions. I asked for more hours at my other job and quit. </p>

		<p>My experience is no different.<br>
I&rsquo;ve lived many places (renter here) and I have never lived around loud or obnoxious whites. They are just as poor as the blacks and Hispanics, but they maintain a certain amount of civility, they are quiet and typically maintain their yards, children, etc. <br>
I lived in a row house once and at first the next door row house was vacant, all of the residents on the street were quiet, peaceful, and white. A few months later, a black family moved in and unleashed havoc upon the street. They weren&rsquo;t capable of speaking in normal tones, they threw trash, dog feces, food, etc into my yard, fought at 3 in the morning, made racial slurs at us, and even confronted us (to their later regret) because we made noise putting a picture on the wall, if they even know what that is. <br>
They were just terrible people and I could go on and on about how horrible they were as neighbors, but I&rsquo;d be here forever. Finally, they were evicted and a nice white couple moved in. All of those problems that the former neighbors inflicted upon our neighborhood were finally gone and the remainder of my time at that house was peaceful. Now in my own neighborhood, all of our white neighbors (even the suspected drug dealers) are quiet, peaceful, and generally friendly. I cannot say the same for my black neighbors. <br>

		<p>Black people being loud, rude and obnoxious is a fact of life.  One time when I was in the hospital to visit a family member a group of black people came in.  They were very loud and menacing.  They had no respect for the patients.  We expected a fight to break out so we had to shut the door to our room.</p>
<p>William, if you want to talk about white men imitating black people you should look at the white men who claim to be pro-white yet date/marry non-white women.  You couldn&rsquo;t get more black than that.  It would be easier to count the black leaders who dated or married in their own race than those that didn&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>This is very true, I am black and I was raised in a predominatly white neighborhood and I am very quiet when I am in public as well as when I am at home. I made the mistake of attending college in Detroit and it is a culture shock for me. Everywhere I walk on campus there is screaming and yelling and I am constantly sexually harassed no matter how much clothing I layer on. It is even worse when I speak my mind in class. Today I was shouted down for speaking against dog fighting and Micheal Vick. It is impossible to have a discussion with low class blacks(especially about race and politics) without them screaming nonsense at you.</p>

		<p>I recently moved from a ghetto to a far better apartment building.  The ghetto was white, Hispanic, and black.  The Hispancs were generally a friendly lot.  Noisy? Once in a while, yes.  My next door neighbor would burst into song now and then, but it would last at most a few moments, then all would be quiet. </p>
<p>The blacks? If there were any nice ones, I did not see them. They were the ones who drove through the complex at dangerous speeds.  They were the noisy ones.  Their kids hung around the mailbox kiosks when working folks were returning home from work. They did all the shouting. And yes, there was gunfire.</p>
<p>Just as I was leaving there was an extensive renovation going on. I talked with one of the contractor supervisors and he said he saw the complex going virtually all-black within another year. </p>

		<p>From Wotan: &#8220;Put 190 people in a banquet hall. Add one table consisting of 10 blacks. Walk in blindfolded and tell me who you hear first.&#8221;  You bet.  Just ate at a restaurant this morning: all sorts of people, white, black, Puerto Rican.  The whites (and to a lesser extent, the Puerto Ricans) were quiet and whispered their conversations.  Could barely hear them at the next table.  The blacks - could hear them across the room, clearly, and undesirably.  One brief anecdote.  When I went to the Arizona memorial at pearl Harbor a few years back, the makeup of the tour group to the Memorial was about 1/3 blacks.  We were instructed over and over again to be quiet and respectful as this was a solemn place.  Guess what?  The entire experience was ruined (I have never forgotten it) by the rude, loud, laughing boisterous behavior of the blacks.  They were not told to be quiet by the people running the tour, either.</p>

		<p>Since Old White Jim brought it up, I thought I&rsquo;d chime in.  I always explained to anti-gun dingbats that a thirty-round banana clip for a rifle is a twenty-round clip that can be left loaded forever without ruining the internal spring.</p>
<p>The followup would be &#8220;Why do you need 20 rounds?&#8221;, and my reply is &#8220;That&rsquo;s 20 dead rioting arsonists before I have to reload.&#8221;</p>
<p>My favorites are the 75 round drums.  The version for the AK-47 can be completely loaded and the spring left relaxed; you just wind it up when you need it, or press the button that relaxes the spring when you don&rsquo;t.</p>
