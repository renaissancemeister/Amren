<h1><a href="https://www.thefire.org/article/12366.html">Tarrant County College Ordered to Pay $240,000 After Losing Battle Against the First Amendment</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>William Creeley, Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), October 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Attention, college administrators: Attempting to defend your institution&rsquo;s unconstitutional speech code in court is very, very expensive. Unfortunately for Texas taxpayers, Tarrant County College (TCC) is the latest school to learn this lesson the hard way. About 240,000 times harder than it needed to be, in fact.</p>
<p>Torch readers will remember that back in March, TCC&rsquo;s speech code was found unconstitutional as a result of litigation coordinated by FIRE and the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas (ACLU-TX). FIRE and the ACLU-TX worked with Fort Worth attorney Karin Cagle to bring a constitutional challenge to TCC&rsquo;s speech code on behalf of student Clayton Smith and John Schwertz, members of Students for Concealed Carry on Campus who had repeatedly been forbidden by TCC to hold an &#8220;empty holster&#8221; protest on campus. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Just two days after the complaint was filed in November 2009, a federal district court judge issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting TCC from quarantining protected speech to the school&rsquo;s tiny &#8220;free speech zone,&#8221; holding that continued operation of the free speech zone would result in &#8220;immediate and irreparable injury&#8221; to students&rsquo; free speech rights. In December, facing obvious defeat, TCC voluntarily dismantled its free speech zone, but also introduced an unconstitutional ban on &#8220;cosponsorship,&#8221; which forbade students and faculty from holding campus events in association with any &#8220;off-campus person or organization.&#8221; Smith&rsquo;s and Schwertz&rsquo;s suit was amended to challenge this new policy, and in a March 2010 ruling, the district court struck this restriction down, too, stating that &#8220;the Court cannot imagine how the provision could have been written more broadly.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} after extensive briefing, the court denied defendants&rsquo; motions for still lower rates and awarded Cagle, her fellow counsel David Broiles, and the ACLU-TX a total of over $240,000 in attorney&rsquo;s fees.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>We hope this pricey defeat prompts other institutions to think twice before they pick a fight with the First Amendment.<br>

		<p>Money is the only thing the left responds to? Unfortunately, even money cannot deter or seriously alter the direction of the leftists who run our institutions.  We could learn a thing or two from them. </p>

		<p>Its really sickening to those of us old enough to remember what the leftists preached in the mid 60s. When most college administrations were fairly conservative and the leftists views were generally looked down upon, the left said college students were young adults and should be exposed to all ideas even those that weren&rsquo;t favored. Of course that was when their ideas were considered the minority, when they became the majority all other ideas had to be suppressed as dangerous. Just shows what hypocrites they all are.</p>

		<p>This college will simply raise its tuition rates and other fees, to recoup its costs in the suit. Heck, if it carries insurance, the insurance company will pay.</p>

		<p>Gotta love the ACLU. They take on  a few conservative causes just to cloak themselves. Nice little trick to confuse the issue of what they really are, and what they really stand for.  </p>

<p>So the ACLU got paid as a result of the deal.  I hardly see that as a good outcome.  They&rsquo;ll probably use that money to defend illegal aliens.  And when has the ACLU ever defended 2nd amendment rights?  Gun owners, and conservatives in general, should never make common cause with the ACLU.  They are the enemy.</p>

<p>This is about the silliest thing I&rsquo;ve read all week   &mdash;   except it is at great personal risk that one lets these seemingly silly things pass unnoticed; our opposition never does.  If not stopped now, that &#8216;tiny&rsquo; free-speech zone will soon be gone completely   &mdash;   first on the campuses (campii??), then the streets, in parks, then anywhere in public, until there is government monitoring of speech as in Orwell&rsquo;s 1984.</p>
<p><i>There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time&hellip;. You had to live &mdash; did live, from habit that became instinct &mdash; in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized.</i></p>
<p>  &mdash;   from 1984&rsquo;s Top 10 Most Depressing Quotes</p>
<p>Remember how the cigarette smoking &#8216;bans&rsquo; started?  We are at the point now in California where entire cities are completely &#8216;smoke free&rsquo; (my own city has signs along public sidewalks, with the violation and code noted, warning of the consequences one faces if he choses to light up in prohibited spaces, what is, a legal product).  The lefties are busy trying to ram through legislation to prevent smoking in your own car (first only &#8216;if children are present&rsquo;), on your own balcony, in your own backyard (because the smoke may blow onto someone else&rsquo;s property) and in your own home.  If moonbeam is elected governor, he will sign these bills.</p>
<p>And lefties like behar and ron reiner have the nerve to call US Nazis?</p>
<p>But this surprised me, and I believe is the ONLY reason the court took notice (as FIRE is a small, grassroots organization):</p>
<p><i>litigation coordinated by&hellip;. the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas (ACLU-TX)</i></p>
<p>There is no doubt the ACLU has a hidden agenda behind this ruling.</p>

		<p>Anonymous is correct. This will not deter the leftisit because the award will be paid from our tax dollars!  Deterrance would only occur is the college president had to pay the award personally.</p>

		<p>@7 I, Bon,</p>
<p>Believe it or not, Hitler was one of the first (with his own money I believe) to start a Federal anti-smoking movement in Germany.  He also did much to ban sales of liquor to underage minors and made strict and sometimes severe examples of the men around him who engaged in alcohol abuse, which was rampant in wartime German forces, (sent a bodyguard who had saved his life back in the 30s to the Oste Front, he did&hellip;).</p>
<p>So, if there be Nazis in them thar Californayay hills, it could well indeed be that they are &#8216;working for the public health administration&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Having said this, what I think needs noting here is that these cash awards are going to the &#8216;guardians of truth and justice&rsquo; themselves.  Such is where the downhill slide on that slippery slope towards revolution for it&rsquo;s own sake really picks up speed because as soon as it&rsquo;s profitable, a movement tends to becomes an extortion racket, subject to all kinds of mercenary tricks and cheats (monitoring your enemy&rsquo;s EML and conversations for instance) as well as picked fights.</p>
<p>Because &#8216;the big win&rsquo; i$ exactly that and government can stand back from shameful abuse of public powers attacks on legitimiate legislation (Arizona SB 1070 for instance).</p>

<p>Giving the loss motive as a disincentive to fighting big-money civil rights groups can thus be equated to giving the Spanish Inquisition the right to issue Writs of Mandamus.  Because SPCL/ACLU/ADL are literally powerful enough to intimidate with name recognition alone.  And if they refuse to undertake a case, it can also be inferred that &#8216;they don&rsquo;t think there is any -money- in it&rsquo;.  Vs. &#8216;Win or Lose, it needs an advocate.&rsquo; which should be the attitude.</p>
<p>If I wanted to make something like this viable, I would begin by limiting the scope of damages to the immediate topic and location.  And then requiring any &#8216;reparations&rsquo; go to recuperating the injured or restricted activity.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to give way to a loony notion (twenty somethings with hidden carry will NOT stop with white girls shooting would be rapists&hellip;), only allow it to be considered on-merit.</p>
<p>Anything else becomes prejudicial.</p>

		<p>Correct, John.  This award is not &#8220;deterrance&#8221; of any sort, because the anticonstitutional criminals who made the decision are not out a cent.  We can only hope the college fires them over this; losing a $240,000 lawsuit will hardly make other learning institutions eager to hire them.</p>

		<p>Anon #3 and Soprano Fan #4: Someone will pay for the outcome of this Law Suit, and that&rsquo;s the point. Bloody the noses of the Liberal Socialists enough with Law Suits and maybe they will learn that it is not nice to fool with the Bill of Rights.</p>
<p>Or, as the song goes, &#8220;Don&rsquo;t Mess With Bill&#8221;. </p>
<p>Pass along to all parents who are entertaining sending their son or daughter to this College, what its Administration, and its Faculty, are really all about. In other words, dry up their sources of revenue, which are our people, as students. </p>
<p>As far as the ACLU getting involved in a case like this, that is just a side show act, or shell game move. We all know that the ACLU doesn&rsquo;t give a damn about the Bill of Rights, or anyone&rsquo;s Right to be left alone, or their Right of Association, the Right to Bear Arms, the Right to live in a crime-free Neighborhood,their Right to Practice their Religion without hinderance, whether in a public square, or not, etc..</p>
<p>Back the right horses in this race. The American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), and the United States Justice Foundation (USJF).<br>
