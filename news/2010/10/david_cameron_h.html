<h1><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/8086001/David-Cameron-hints-at-relaxing-immigration-cap.html">David Cameron Hints at Relaxing Immigration Cap</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Kirkup and Tom Whitehead, London Telegraph, October 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Prime Minister gave the reassurance following protests from major international firms and leading British universities that capping net immigration will stop them hiring the staff they need to compete internationally.</p>
<p>Mr Cameron&rsquo;s remarks came amid new warnings that a forthcoming European trade treaty with India will circumvent any British immigration cap by allowing multinational firms to transfer unlimited numbers of Indian employers to the UK.</p>
<p>The Coalition has pledged to introduce an annual cap on non-European immigration, reducing net immigration to the UK to &#8220;tens of thousands&#8221; of people each year. Final details of the cap are still being discussed in Whitehall.</p>
<p>The policy has drawn protests from business leaders and Vince Cable, the business secretary, has said it could be &#8220;hugely damaging&#8221; to British-based firms who want to transfer staff from overseas to work here.</p>
<p>Addressing the annual conference of the CBI, Britain&rsquo;s biggest business lobby, the Prime Minister appeared to signal concessions ahead.</p>
<p>Mr Cameron told the conference: &#8220;As we control our borders and bring immigration to a manageable level, we will not impede you from attracting the best talent from around the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Prime Minister left the conference to meet Jeff Immelt, the chief executive of General Electric, which has complained about the immigration cap.</p>
<p>Downing Street insisted that Mr Cameron&rsquo;s remarks did not constitute a retreat from the Coalition&rsquo;s policy.</p>
<p>But a spokesman for the Prime Minister said the final immigration rules would address business groups&rsquo; concerns.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;We will be looking at the level of that cap and at the way in which it operates and making sure that works in a way that allows business to bring the people that they need into the UK.&#8221;</p>
<p>Richard Lambert, the CBI&rsquo;s director general, said it was &#8220;encouraging&#8221; that Mr Cameron &#8220;made clear that access to immigration would not be a barrier to future growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Cameron&rsquo;s speech coincided with a fresh warning about the impact of a trade deal being negotiated between the European Union and India.</p>
<p>The pact could allow multinational companies operating in India and the EU an unlimited right to transfer employees between the two.</p>
<p>The trade deal&rsquo;s potential implications for UK immigration rules were first highlighted by the Daily Telegraph earlier this month.</p>
<p>Migrationwatch UK, a pressure group, yesterday said that the trade deal could &#8220;blast a hole in Britain&rsquo;s immigration controls&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sir Andrew Green of Migrationwatch said: &#8216;It looks as though the Indians are about to drive a bullock and cart through Britain&rsquo;s immigration system despite government talk about creating jobs in the private sector. There is no point in a limit on economic migration if specialists from India are excluded from the cap by a separate agreement.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said the treaty, expected to be agreed by the end of the year will have &#8220;considerable benefits to UK businesses&#8221;.</p>
<p>A spokesman said: &#8220;We will ensure that any commitments placed on the UK by this agreement will be consistent with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to reduce net migration.&#8221;<br>

		<p>This is why the Citizens United v Federal Election Commission is so devastating.  Corporations headed by white people have historically looked for cheap non-white labor.  The modern roots of this problem go back to the Atlantic slave trade.  Companies with the backing of their respective country brought gross numbers of Africans to the Americas as cheap labor.  The American South was 35-40% African.  White Southerners instead of rejecting the slave traders and taking action against them embraced them.  America influences the world particularly the white world.  White countries will follow America toward destruction.  It&rsquo;s not going to stop until their is a complete collapse of every white society, until white people are a minority everywhere.  British people will not put up a fight over this and even if they did the government would still implement it because corporations rule all in white countries.</p>

		<p>The immigration laws do not apply to European immigrants.  Europe has well over 700 million people, so what&rsquo;s the problem?  What, they can&rsquo;t find people from all over Europe to take vacant jobs???  Somehow I doubt that to be the case.</p>

<p>China will be Chinese, Japan will be Japanese, and Korea will be Korean. The torch of human knowledge will pass from what was the West to the East. There were once to great populations in the world, the Westerners, and the Easterners, soon it will be just the latter.<br>

		<p>Sure, this is mostly Corporate doing.<br>
Business Conservatives like Mass Immigration.<br>
I read other Forums and They bring up<br>
&#8220;Jews&#8221;, and Cultural Marxism etc, but<br>
there isn&rsquo;t anything less caring of<br>
Cultural Nationalism than Global Corporations.<br>
Even Unions are better in this regard,<br>
and even Communists. </p>

<p>This is sadly, only too true!</p>
<p>Once corporations went international, found how to evade national laws, avoid taxes, etc., they became entities without loyalty, that have no allegiance to anything but profits.  Profits are good, but at what eventual cost?  The sort of future this paints is one, arriving more quickly in places like England, due to being a commerce center and so small, is that Western culture, more outgoing than Eastern culture, combines with the worst elements of the human animal to produce this destructive trend.  The future will include more France like worker riots, but due to real oppression, rather than some spoiled brats who already have a 40 hour work week, and weeks of paid vacations every year, along with protections from being fired, a social medicine system that has worked very well up to now, etc.  The use of foreigners to bouy the tax base is not working out anywhere in the West.  What we are getting instead are lazy, hostile non-white groups that are increasingly violent toward their hosts.  Both Marxism and Capitalism have been naive in thinking that they could ignore cultural, social, and racial/ethnic differences, or make them disappear. That is because even if they destroyed races and cultures, as they seem to really seek to do, new, and far less civilized ones replace them.  History illustrates this all too well.  Marxists and Capitalists both share the conceit that greed and self-righteousness that comes with their different, but psychologically similar motivational ideologies.</p>

		<p>At the same, Queen Elizabeth ll is meeting with the leadership of Qatar, hoping to bring that nations wealth to Britain with investments in  Britain.  Qatar is a very small, but extremely wealthy nation, with no scruples when it comes to business practice.  Once a member of the British Commonwealth, it exit allowed it to skirt laws in banking and other practices that allowed the once nearly pirate state to come to represent the zenith of luxuious living, with everything that can be procured from non-desert regions, including sex slaves from Ukrain and Russia.  Where do they all disappear to?  Private homes of wealthy Arabs, largely.</p>

<p>Actually, capitalism has been racially destructive since the beginning.  Remember the that Virginia Company, which was a stock issuing corporation, was responsible for first importing Africans to what would become America.  Capitalists have repeatedly been involved in attempts to import non-white labor long before the globalist era. When slavery was outlawed, they brought coolies from Asia, then blacks to Northern Cities, then Puerto Ricans and Mexicans, then H1B coolies from India.  It&rsquo;s been an unbroken chain of this stuff since capitalism emerged.  </p>
