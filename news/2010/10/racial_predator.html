<h1>Racial Predatory Loans Fueled Housing Crisis: Study</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reuters, Oct. 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Predatory lending aimed at racially segregated minority neighborhoods led to mass foreclosures that fueled the U.S. housing crisis, according to a new study published in the American Sociological Review.</p>
<p>Predatory lending typically refers to loans that carry unreasonable fees, interest rates and payment requirements.</p>
<p>Poorer minority areas became a focus of these practices in the 1990s with the growth of mortgage-backed securities, which enabled lenders to pool low- and high-risk loans to sell on the secondary market, Professor Douglas Massey of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University and PhD candidate Jacob Rugh, said in their study.</p>
<p>The financial institutions likely to be found in minority areas tended to be predatory  &mdash;  pawn shops, payday lenders and check cashing services that &#8220;charge high fees and usurious rates of interest,&#8221; they said in the study.</p>
<p>&#8220;By definition, segregation creates minority dominant neighborhoods, which, given the legacy of redlining and institutional discrimination, continue to be underserved by mainstream financial institutions,&#8221; the study says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Subprime lending refers to loans made to consumers with poor credit and others considered higher risk. They tend to have a higher interest rate than traditional loans.</p>
<p>The study, which used data from the 100 largest U.S. metropolitan areas, found that living in a predominantly African-American area, and to a lesser extent Hispanic area, were &#8220;powerful predictors of foreclosures&#8221; in the nation.</p>
<p>{snip}.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a result, from 1993 to 2000, the share of subprime mortgages going to households in minority neighborhoods rose from 2 to 18 percent,&#8221; Massey and Rugh said.</p>
<p>They said the U.S. Civil Rights Act should be amended to create mechanisms that would uncover discrimination and penalize those who discriminated against minority borrowers.</p>

		<p>Predatory lending into racially segregated areas?  But the borrowers purchased housing in that segregated area and stayed.  Seems thy like it there.  If the issue is to cure segregation, then the credit offered did no good as the people stayed where they were.  If the issue is they paid too much and now can&rsquo;t support their homes, welcome to the joys of home ownership.  When the govt policies reduce down payments from 20% to zero, and allow first few years a low rates with the understanding the house will appreciate later and an equity withdrawal will fill the financing gap, this is a Ponzi scheme of the worst sort.  <br>
Not all people should own houses, as not all people are good credits with the stability in income and personal habits.  Often renting is a better alternative.  <br>
BTW in Switzerland 2/3s of the population rents, in the US 2/3s of the population owns.  Our policies have tried to defy financial and credit truisms and failed spectacularly. </p>

		<p> And here I thought the housing crisis was caused by the government&rsquo;s pressuring the financial industry to lend money to &#8220;people of color&#8221; who everybody knew couldn&rsquo;t, or wouldn&rsquo;t, pay it back! Great big silly me! Of course it had to be &#8220;predatory lending,&#8221; taking advantage of poor, disadvantaged black folk!</p>
<p> Of course, there were plenty of White people who were given mortgages they couldn&rsquo;t or wouldn&rsquo;t pay off, too. But to mention that, Reuters would have had to give up one of the Left&rsquo;s most cherished shibboleths, and the whole point the news agency is trying to make in this story: That dark-skinned people are always, without exception, &#8220;victims&#8221; of mean old racist Whites. Dark folk are never, EVER, conniving hustlers who saw a chance to get a house   &mdash;   for a while   &mdash;   that they knew they&rsquo;d never pay off. Oh, no; heaven forbid!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Racial predatory loans?&#8221;  Would those be the loans that financial institutions were forced to grant to mestizos and blacks because it would have been &#8220;racist&#8221; to do otherwise?</p>

		<p>If the banks did not give &#8220;predatory&#8221; loans to unqualified black and Hispanic borrowers, they would have been assured of losing money.  Of course, they probably lost money regardless.<br>

		<p>I hope everyone here has seen the 2004 CSPAN hearing where members of the congressional black caucus ridiculed and insulted the head regulator of fannie mae/freddie mac, they insisted everything was wonderful despite being told by the regulator that the country was standing on a house of cards. No one fought harder for the &#8220;ninja&#8221; loans than black members of congress, It was ACORN that sued Citibank to force them to make these loans. And today, barry obama&rsquo;s financial &#8220;reform&#8221; bill, in which the CBC&rsquo;s maxine waters (who starred in the &#8216;04 hearings) played a large role in writing, still does not address fannie mae/freddie mac, nor does it address the CRA, the cause of the housing bubble and subsequent financial/credit collapse, and again thanks to maxine waters, the bill gives special consideration to banks that cater to minorities (read black).  It makes me wonder just what reality black folks live in.</p>

		<p>I can add another strong predictor for foreclosure; whites who work for themselves. My wife and I have barely been able to avoid foreclosure ourselves.  The big difference I see are whites, people who have government jobs, or jobs with well established corporations.  Several white people in my suburb here in the Northwest have lost their homes.  All were contractor types of individuals.  One good friend of mine still does contracting in California, but the poor guy&rsquo;s health is endangered because all he does is get up early, work all day and fret all night, or sit and hope for work and fret.  </p>
<p>I see a great divide between those who have government jobs and all the others who work for private industry or self employed.  There is a growing resentment for those fat cats who are usually no more than bureaucrats, or gravy train workers, who take long lunches, nice vacations, good medical, great pensions, etc., while the rest of us will have to struggle to the very end.  These are incidentally, the jobs that are patently Affirmative Action and Diversity driven employers. Here in Washington State, I can SEE new immigrants arrive every week and get County or State jobs in a moment.  The proportion of non-white people I see around town driving Mercedes and the like, are obviously new arrivals.  I really wonder what the local, state, and federal government thinks it is doing?  I see them supporting this with news programs and articles that suggest whites who cannot accept these &#8220;positive changes&#8221; are radicalizing whites and must be &#8220;wathced.&#8221;  It is as if they are seeking to create a political climate for the eventual arrest of whites en masse, because they &#8220;refuse to fit in.&#8221;</p>

		<p>When a person buys a home with no money down and then lives in that house until he gets evicted for not making payments he has lost nothing.The banks had their arms twisted by community organizers and race hucksters like Jessie(million mortgage march)Jackson and Barack Obama.The banks recouped their loan repayments not from the black people who got the loans.The banks got bailed out by the white middle class tax payer.The only victims of predatory lending were the tax payers who had to foot the bill. People who bite off more than they can chew and the bankers that did not have the character or courage to refuse the loans in the first place lost nothing. </p>

		<p>We all know that if the banks didn&rsquo;t make those &#8220;predatory&#8221; loans, they&rsquo;d have been accused of redlining.  </p>
<p>But wait, say the liberals, the banks should have made mortgages with low rates and easy terms.  Well, if the blacks are such good credit risks, why doesn&rsquo;t a black owned bank lend them money?  There are plenty of rich black people in this country who could start a bank that lends to black people, if they thought that would be a profitable thing to do.  Thanks to all those &#8220;racist&#8221; white controlled banks they&rsquo;d have the market to themselves and would clean up.  But I notice that rich black people don&rsquo;t do this.  Maybe they understand other blacks better than liberal whites do.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Predatory lending aimed at racially segregated minority neighborhoods led to mass foreclosures that fueled the U.S. housing crisis.&#8221;</p>
<p>In my town, as in most larger towns and cities across the USA, &#8220;community organizers&#8221; actually got together groups of homeless and invaded banks and city council meetings and demanded that the racist banks stop red-lining and start giving loans to &#8220;People of Color&#8221;.  They were screaming things like &#8220;We want justice now!&#8221;  Using charges of racism, and bulling and threatening, they got the banks to loan and the real estate agents to sell to underemployed Miorities and immigrants.  Of course, these people could not possibly make the monthly payments, and this started the sub-prime mortgage crisis.  They demanded that banks make the loans, and now they call it &#8220;predatory lending.&#8221;  Are Americans really that stupid that they believe such blatant lying.  </p>

		<p>Seems to me it would be easier to just strengthen loan regulations so people who cant pay them back cant get them. If that had been done years ago we wouldnt be in the position were in now. Things like this just show our politicians dont care about the future of this country, only pandering to minorities and their personal power.</p>

		<p>Virtually everything regarding non-whites(blacks and hispanics in particular) is a bizarre inversion of White reality. When non-whites recklessly take advantage of pressure to give them homes/loans despite their high risk situation, it is &#8220;predatory&#8221; in nation. When blacks and hispanics lag in education this &#8220;achievement gap&#8221; is presumed to be the fault of the &#8220;system&#8221; and &#8220;institutional racism&#8221; never the non-whites themselves. When blacks and hispanics fill prisons as a result of their criminal malfeasance, it is &#8220;society&#8221; that has failed THEM!! All this is reason stood on its head - all this is life in a multiracial post-marxist country. </p>

<p>They needed a study to come to that conclusion? I could have told them that ten years ago for free. So could every AmRen reader.</p>
<p>I know there is enough blame to go around but ultimately it falls on the inherent idiocy of blacks and on a twisted government policy that only encouraged (read: allowed others to take advantage of) black ignorance.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if blacks with credit scores equaling their average IQs could get a mortgage - that&rsquo;s not the point. It is, however, their responsibility NOT to sign and buy a house they knew they could not afford and would default on in under five years. </p>
<p>The lenders are to blame insofar as they clearly knew the blacks would never repay the loans. Bankers may not be moral but they&rsquo;re not stupid - they knew exactly how long it would be before Darnell and Shaniqua started missing payments. But they didn&rsquo;t care - they just unloaded the loans into repackaged securities and kept the fees.</p>
<p>I also blame the usual suspects - the government and the liberal, guilt-ridden whites for this economic fiasco. Rubbing their hands with worry that not enough blacks owned homes (and hence were not part of some bogus American dream) they decided lenders should hand out cash to Darnell and Shaniqua. Based entirely on skin color. </p>
<p>Some people should not own homes. One BIG reason is that they can&rsquo;t afford them. But you now have an Alice in Wonderland situation. </p>
<p>Hey, I&rsquo;d like a big, fancy BMW. But I can&rsquo;t really afford it. Maybe the government will let me have one. That&rsquo;s what it was like. Worse, I could get a loan for a big, fancy BMW. But economically, it is a bad move for me. So I won&rsquo;t get it. But Darnell and Shaniqua do not think like that. Now multiply Darnell and Shaniqua by some 30 million plus. </p>
<p>Whites have become so concerned about saying &#8220;no&#8221; to the poor, aggrieved blacks we&rsquo;re not only committing cultural suicide but economic suicide. </p>

		<p>  I don&rsquo;t believe this &#8220;report&#8221; is accurate, especially coming from Princeton, CNBC and Reuters, all of which are notorious for making excuses for minorities.  Lending institutions have been under siege for years to lend to minorities including many illegal aliens.  Obama was an organizer for ACORN and threatened many banks and mortgage companies so they had lend to ghetto types without any means or income.  This practice was also required by federal authorities since the Klinton abomination, and increased 4 fold under Bush, and lenders probably sold off these loans as fast as possible.  When they were turned into junk bonds, all the dominoes were in place.  <br>
   It is noteworthy that this practice is unchanged to this day even in light of the $trillions it has cost to bail out the financial institutions that should have been allowed to go bankrupt.  Instead, Fannie and Freddie have been propped up and bureaucrats like Franklin Raines left with $80 million+ retirements instead of 30 years in prison which he deserved.  The foreclosures continue unabated, but no one talks anymore about how much it&rsquo;s costing now.  Banks are failing left and right, but this was only news when Bush was president.  It is likely the real collapse has yet to happen.  And how will all this debt be paid?  <br>

		<p>I love the term &#8220;predatory lending.&#8221;  Apparently the banking system has devised a new method of generating record earnings, consisting of making loans to various unqualified minorities on overvalued properties, which will result in foreclosures, with the properties accruing to the lenders with payoffs at several times the current appraisals.  </p>
<p>Yup, this certainly sounds like a brilliant scheme to shore up sagging balance sheets.  I&rsquo;m surprised nobody thought of it before.  </p>

<p>Well, yes!  That was the way it was back in the 1980&rsquo;s when to get a home loan, you had to be able to put 20% down and have a secure job that paid substantially more than the mortgage payment.  But Leftists thought that was &#8220;racist.&#8221;  They pushed hard for loans to Minorities, even if they could not come up with a down payment and even if they had sketchy or even no employment.  </p>

		<p>NONSENSE!</p>
<p>Making loans to high risk individuals is just a RED HERRING. </p>
<p>The loans were not the source of the Banking problem, it was that the banks flipped whole portfolios (bundles of hundreds of loans) over and over again, with each purchaser boosting the book value of those portfolios.</p>
<p>At the end of the musical chair game of pass the portfolio, the bank that ended up with the portfolio had to acknowledge that the damned things were booked at ten times their actual value.</p>
<p>The Republicans are trying as hard as possible to blame this on the citizens. &#8220;Oh you lazy, stupid citizens; you over-extended again!&#8221; But, the reality is that the bankers all gamed the system to pass along over-valued junk to the next sucker in line.</p>
<p>When the final holders of the portfolios realized that those portfolios of half-million dollar homes were actually termite infested townhouses that were stapled together with plastic and cheap wood, they realized that they had to absorb the loss, since everyone else knew, by then, that the portfolios were garbage.</p>
<p>When you hear them try to blame the citizen, THEY ARE LYING to you AGAIN!</p>

<p>That is not completely true.  In fact, for 100 years in the USA, local banks gave home home loans based on wise fiscal policy (20% down and a salary that could easily maintain the monthly payments).  Then both &#8220;community activists&#8221; and the Federal government forced banks to make unwise loans to Minorities and immigrants.  But, bankers aren&rsquo;t stupid.  They realized what would happen to these loans.  Hence, they worked with the Federal government to change banking policy to allow them to bundle the bad loans and move the risk to others.  BUT IT ALL STARTED WITH GOVERNMENT PRESSURE TO GIVE MORE LOANS TO PEOPLE OF COLOR.  Without that pressure, banks never would have given $500,000 loans to unmarried Hispanic hotel maids with 5 children.</p>

		<p>Geeeeee, and I wonder why banks never wanted to loan them money all these years.  I&rsquo;m sure it was plain ole&rsquo;, white racism.  Surely these white racist bankers knew blacks and hispanics would be just as responsible as whites to hold jobs and pay their loans back in full and on time. The lovely and enriching way they take care of their own neighborhoods is evident to all.  (sarcasm)</p>

		<p>There was in fact enormous federal pressure to lend to minorities.Where the pressure was not sufficient lenders like Countrywide,Wells Fargo,etc created it.Everyone knows mortgage brokers are unscrupulous but there was collusion at the highest,most hallowed levels of Wall St.Moody&rsquo;s in particular of which Warren Buffett owns 20%,of course this causes a conflict of interest and calls into question Moody&rsquo;s impartiality.Quite simply people got homes that did not deserve them.I remember reading about a migrant fruit picker in California who qualified for a $700,000 mortgage despite an annual income of $14,000.Redlining does make sound fiscal sense but a bank does so at its peril.And blacks do negatively affect property values.If they build a public housing complex nearby a homeowner can typically see a negative effect on equity.Likewise blockbusting is illegal but nobody is ever prosecuted.It was a bad situation where the most rapacious lenders pocketed billions,and the one that got the ball rolling was the federal government.</p>

		<p>Oddly enough, it seems that the vast majority of predatory lenders caught in the Atlanta area were black-owned (or run) banks or mortgage companies targeting blacks. By far, the primary mortgage fraud perpetrators were black individuals targeting black homeowners.</p>

		<p>I really must disagree with many of you blaming blacks and hispanics for &#8220;forcing&#8221; the banks to loan to them.  I really urge you to research this issue a little bit more in depth.  Yes, there was the community reinvestment act, but the CRA dates back to the 80s.  </p>
<p>This current crises is a different animal.  The reason blacks and hispanics are hardest hit by this is because they have the lowest financial literacy and they make less money.  The lending that went on during this time truly WAS predatory.  I lived in a black neighborhood in LA in 2005.  A very suave looking man in a BMW 7 series used to drive around the neighborhood and try and get people to &#8220;take out equity&#8221; from their homes.  ( i put that in quote marks just for those out there who don&rsquo;t get that this is just a loan).  </p>
<p>Now you may argue (and I might argue too) that these people still had a responsibility to read all the docs, pay back their loan, etc, etc.  Well, look, I am not here to make excuses, but you gotta see a little bit from their point of view.  Most of these loans were second loans for houses people already owned.  They bought the houses years ago when they were cheap.  These were homes they could afford!  </p>
<p>They have lived paycheck to paycheck their entire life (yes, probably because of their poor planning).  </p>
<p>Now suddenly someone is telling them they can have $50,000.  They are told that they can just &#8220;take out the equity&#8221; from their house.  At this point I could stand outside their home holding up a poster and screaming that the loan is junk and the terms are predatory.  It&rsquo;s not going to make a difference.  </p>
<p>It used to be that when the banks were stuck holding the paper, this would not happen.  Well, Clariese above is totally right.  The problem really lies with the financial institutions themselves more than the homeowner or the borrower.  </p>
<p>The average person really does not know what kind of a credit risk they are.  Many, many, MANY people just ASSUME that a bank would not lend them money they could not pay back.  (and that used to be true, pretty much).  Poor blacks and hispanics tend to have an extremely low level of financial literacy.  During those years, the system was perfectly set up to screw those people. During the bubble, an individual broker got an extra $1000 bucks if he could increase someones APR from 5.4% to 6.3%.  I hope you can see how someone with low math literacy could get screwed easily under this system.  Let me share one last anecdote:  the paperwork given to borrowers as mandated by the Truth in Lending Act is written on a 17th grade reading level.  That&rsquo;s right - the TRUTH about a loan is written for people with a graduate school level education when the average person reads at an 8th grade level.  <br>
