<h1><a href="https://www.politicsdaily.com/2010/10/19/obama-continues-outreach-with-message-to-black-newspapers/">Obama Continues Outreach With Message to Black Newspapers</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mary C. Curtis, AOL News, October 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} As Democrats in close races distance themselves from the president and policies such as health care and the stimulus bill that are unpopular among voters on the fence, they risk demoralizing voters who approve of those initiatives and want to see the government continue to address their concerns. Those same voters could make the difference in key contests but not if they stay home.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The president cited the money being spent on &#8220;negative ads from independent, undisclosed organizations run by Republican operatives,&#8221; a recent theme in campaign speeches. And, he said, &#8220;Democrats are going to be far less likely to cut education spending,&#8221; needed, for example, to improve low-performing schools.</p>
<p>The national unemployment rate of 9.6 percent rises to 16 percent for African-Americans and is even higher for teenagers. Yet black voters don&rsquo;t blame the president, and give him an approval rating double that of Americans overall. Not having the president on the ballot could hurt turnout, particularly if Democratic candidates are running as fast as they can away from economic policies that are seen as providing some relief in areas such as job creation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the end of the discussion, Obama urged the journalists to tell their readers &#8220;the president of United States specifically asked them to turn out to the polls.&#8221; It&rsquo;s not a &#8220;partisan&#8221; thing, he said. &#8220;Folks should make up their own mind.&#8221; Just &#8220;take a look at who they think best serves their interests.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though the majority of African-American voters don&rsquo;t seem to buy the GOP message, it&rsquo;s not certain that Democrats and the president have closed the deal.<br>

		<p>Of course Democrats have done &#8220;a lot&#8221; for Blacks..it has kept them in the condition they love best..servitude and dependance.<br>
Thats right, blacks LOVE slavery. The victim status, the handouts, the excuse from all real effort  Blacks seek out slavery, usually in the form of Black despotic leaders. </p>

		<p>&#8220;He hopes black newspapers will convince blacks that Democrats have done a lot for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Absolutely hilarious!</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s preaching to the choir when they&rsquo;re already 98% in back of him.  Wouldn&rsquo;t it be wiser to try to get the vote out from other groups?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it at the beginning of this guys presidency and I&rsquo;ll say it again now  &#8220;If this arrogant ego maniac is placed under tremendous pressure, we&rsquo;re all going to see him crack and revert to a ghetto attitude, and ghetto language.&#8221;  We&rsquo;re already seeing a bit of it with all these crazy looking facial expressions the media has taken of him lately.  </p>
<p>It looks like he&rsquo;s beginning to implode right now. His photo on the Drudge Report the other day had him looking like a character in &#8220;One flew over the cuckcoo&rsquo;s nest.&#8221;<br>

		<p><i>And, he said, &ldquo;Democrats are going to be far less likely to cut education spending,&rdquo; needed, for example, to improve low-performing schools.</i></p>
<p>It has been proven time and time again that actual academic performance has almost no correlation with school spending.  But the Democratic &#8220;solution&#8221; to failing schools is always to spend more money.  It is also well known to all that there is a very strong correlation between the quality of a school and the ratio of whites and Asians to blacks and Hispanics.  However anyone who states this fact out loud gets fired and is banned from polite society.<br>

		<p>What obama said in that certain code was, &#8220;We sent your chieftains boatloads of federal money, now you listen to your bosses and vote democrat&#8221;.  What he meant is all that stimulus money went to pay off democratic party apparatchiks and you better vote for us since the republicans will cut you off.</p>
<p>No where in our long history have we ever seen such corruption and thievery.  Our ancestors by now would have risen up, violently if necessary, to save the Republic.  Just how do you think we could explain a Barney Frank to our Founding Fathers?  Our shame is not in losing the Republic but in how it was all but handed away.</p>

		<p>Black newspapers??  I wonder how many Black newspapers are actually read with so much as a fourth grade reader&rsquo;s level of comprehension in this country.</p>

		<p>And of course &#8220;it&rsquo;s not a partisan thing&#8221; according to Obama.  Right.  That&rsquo;s why he is pandering to, and cajoling only, groups that are ENTIRELY partisan.  Such as blacks, college campuses, schools, union halls.  All places that vote lock step Democratic.  He appears nowhere else but places friendly to him and in his pocket.  That coward!<br>
He&rsquo;s the most partisan president ever.  He has brought this country to the brink of civil war.  He has stirred up a racial war, inciting minorities against whites in all manner of ways.  He is now feeling the backlash.  I predict he will be arrogantly using his executive powers to sign &#8220;legislation&#8221; more and more in the next two years.  If he goes far enough, and is impeached, he will plead to the black population in code that says &#8220;riot.  kill whitey.  For the Marxist Revolution!&#8221;</p>
