<h1><a href="https://www.americanthinker.com/2010/10/do_american_history_teachers_v.html">Do American History Teachers Value Feelings Over Knowledge?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert Holland and Don Soifer, American Thinker, October 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nearly half of American history teachers believe it is less important that their students understand the common history, ideas, rights, and responsibilities that tie the country together as Americans than that they learn to celebrate the unique identities and experiences of its different ethnic, religious, and immigrant groups.</p>
<p>Advocates of radical &#8220;social-justice&#8221; multiculturalism in many university schools of education  &mdash;  the places where most K-12 teachers are trained  &mdash;  continue to oppose assimilation with a common culture while instead seeking to radically transform an &#8220;oppressive&#8221; America.</p>
<p>A new survey of public high-school social-studies teachers done for the American Enterprise Institute indicates that they have gained a strong foothold in high schools.</p>
<p>Another sign of the indoctrination of this radical strain of multiculturalism was the finding that 37 percent of the history teachers believed it was &#8220;absolutely essential&#8221; that they teach their students &#8220;to be activists who challenge the status quo of our political system and seek to remedy injustices.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, only a little more than one-third of the teachers deemed it &#8220;absolutely essential&#8221; for their students to &#8220;know facts&#8221; (such as the location of the fifty states) or dates (such as the attack on Pearl Harbor). After all, why let facts get in the way of advocacy?</p>
<p>While only about six in ten teachers thought it imperative for their students to (1) understand such concepts as federalism, separation of powers, and checks and balances, and (2) know about the American Founding, the Civil War, and the Cold War, a whopping 76 percent deemed it critical for students &#8220;to be tolerant of people and groups who are different from themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Numerous studies have found that tiny minorities of history teachers have majored in the subject, and many have taken little more than a few survey courses.</p>
<p>A basic problem is that history commonly is fitted under the umbrella of social studies, a mishmash of everything from global studies to sociology. State certification requirements equate &#8220;social studies education&#8221; with knowledge of history, when in fact a would-be teacher may not even have studied any history, or may have very little formal preparation in the subject.</p>
<p>{snip} When teachers are guided by little background studying history themselves, and only fuzzy state standards to guide curriculum, a parent should wonder what precisely his or her children are learning in American history class.    </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Sacramento, CA school district explained that its students get only twelve instructional minutes per day in American history. So it is little wonder that only a third of their eleventh-graders score at a proficient level on the state history test.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the radical National Association for Multicultural Education, which exerts a strong influence on teacher training, receives a large chunk of its operating funding from taxpayer-funded contracts with schools and school districts in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.</p>

<p>As a an &#8216;old fashioned&rsquo; history teacher I see this from the 20 something social studies &#8216;teachers&rsquo; all the time.  It&rsquo;s endemic and widespread in a way that would nauseate the average American if they knew.</p>
<p>The social justice garbage flows in &#8216;history&rsquo; classes all the time and there&rsquo;s no check on it - only encouragement from the higher ups who are generally liberals too.</p>
<p>I am the only teacher I know who teaches straight up history: here&rsquo;s what happened, what happened next and here is the larger context and how it blends into these other events.  Names, dates and critical analysis, etc&hellip;</p>
<p>It is so comical that in my several years in a major urban area I have not met a single teacher who teaches actual history.  </p>
<p>The closest they get is this tomfoolery called &#8220;The 7 Lenses of History&#8221; which is like a disconnected sampling of an economic event, a political event, an environmental event, etc.</p>
<p>In general all the teachers I know are totally into a &#8216;white-man-is-bad-all-non-whites-are-perfect-and-vibrant&rsquo; kind of funk.</p>
<p>Everything is about oppression, exploitation and injustice with non-whites as victims and whites as bad and fiendish.  That&rsquo;s it nothing more.  It&rsquo;s sickening, but this is another way we&rsquo;ve lost out country - our youth have been brainwashed by racial marxists and now try to destroy the very civilization that provided them with everything they have and want in the future.</p>

		<p>School history texts written before 1965 tend to be much more unbiased and reliable.</p>
<p>Parents would do well to homeschool their children in the history of Western civilization.  Source material should avoid anything with a contemporary leftist slant.</p>

<p>This NEVER includes white men. In fact &#8216;tolerance&rsquo; training is normally an ATTACK on white men. Not blaming white men in an enthusiastic Enough manner is the definition of insensitivity.</p>

		<p>If I were a parent, I&rsquo;d probably have a fit if I really knew what kind of drivel my children were being taught in this day and age. What really makes me want to bite the heads off nails is that, given the dumbing-down of education in the USA over the past 45 years, many of these so-called history teachers don&rsquo;t know their er..ah..well, backsides from a hole in the ground.  &#8220;Social Studies,&#8221; like sociology, is a faux science that is some jumble of nonsense, not actual learning.  </p>
<p>It begins with the parents, as it always has, but many of today&rsquo;s parents rely on the schools (and maybe the churches) to raise their children, unlike our parents in days gone by.  Parents should monitor what their children are being taught and become &#8220;activists&#8221; when the schools are teaching them multiculturalism and feel-good stuff instead of facts and lessons to be learned from history. So, we failed some tests and didn&rsquo;t make the team back in the day - that was part of growing up - no one succeeds at everything he or she tries.  We just got past all that and moved on.  But I do have to say that, thanks to my teachers (God rest their souls), I do know why and when the Revolutionary War and the War Between the States were fought.  The only war that might even give them a clue is the War of 1812, but some may flip their lids when they discover that it actually extended beyond 1812.  Try asking them against whom was the War of 1812 fought, and then the fun would begin.</p>

The president of the Buffalo public school teachers union has been quoted as saying about race relations that &#8216;it&rsquo;s less important what kids learn in the classroom than what the kids learn about each other&rsquo; (paraphrased).</p>
<p>Apparently, the Buffalo public schools can churn out morons (which they do) so long as the races learn to love each other (which they don&rsquo;t).<br>

		<p>Sadly, this is nothing new and was well under way when I was in high school in the mid 1980&rsquo;s. I had a bellyfull of holocausts, apartheids, feminism, slavery and a host of &#8220;social-justice&#8221; clap-trap(though I don&rsquo;t know that they called it that then); yet I could hardly tell you who won the Civil War or why Thomas Edison was important when I graduated.   </p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a price for every folly. Someday we will get the bill.</p>
<p>All of this will one day hit the fan, as it inevitably must, when we someday wake up and find ourselves living in a backward, chaotic, crime-ridden,  poverty-stricken country, and that other  countries (upon which we once sneered) have passed us by, leaving  us in the dust. Then, when we finally wake up from this multi-cultural binge we&rsquo;ve been on, like an alcoholic after a drunk,  we will rub our eyes and wonder whatever happened to the once-great USA???</p>
<p>Of course, it will be too late then.  The multyculty fanatics will have had their party, and left us to pay the bill.</p>

		<p>In the mid 70&rsquo;s I went back to get a teaching credential with my degree.  During one lecture it was explained to the class that poverty, crime, etc had damaged youg Blacks minds, resulting in an ingrained sense of inferiority and subsequent poor performance in life.  Within a few more lectures the same Ph.D. (educ.) stated that testing had shown that Blacks youths had very high self esteem and consistently graded their own performance higher than it actually was.  I raised my hand and said &#8220;but you said earlier&hellip;&#8221;.  You could have heard a pin drop.  A quick glance at the rest of the class showed 20 White youg adults rigid in their seats, looking straight ahead, no eye contact at all.  The Professor mumbled some irrelevant sentences and did not address the question.  I did not pursue a teaching credential.</p>

		<p>I recall reading that most high school students actually believe Lincoln invaded the South to stop slavery and the US entered World War 2 to stop the Holocaust.</p>
<p>No surprise, given that these are the same ideologues who gave us the buffoonery known as Anti-Racist Math.<br>

<p>The multicultists of tomorrow will have the explanation for what happened: the intolerance of persons like ourselves prevented harmony and understanding and brought on the chaos.</p>
<p>A lot of us who hold the views expressed on Amren think that worsening circumstances will somehow lift the veil from people&rsquo;s eyes. I doubt it. The puppet masters will continue to manipulate opinion so that their central role remains hidden.</p>

		<p>I took AP American History during the 1982-83 school year. Our teacher was a flaming liberal, ex-nun, all-but-certain lesbian. YET, she was a patriot who had everyone memorize the National Anthem and write it out, without flaw, from memory (most common mistake: &#8220;Gave <i>proof</i> through the night&#8221; was commonly remembered as &#8220;Gave <i>truth.&#8221; </i></p>
<p>She taught a fact-based course that had little to do with the Zinn view of American history. Her &#8220;greatest president&#8221; was Andrew Jackson, while acknowledging the debt we all owe George Washington. She was a great teacher who made history real for us. My recollection is that most who took the AP test that year got 4&rsquo;s and 5&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>This despite the fact that she thought Ronald Reagan was going to ruin the country, and she thought Lyndon Johnson would be rehabilitated when memories of Vietnam faded and we realized how awesome the Great Society really was.</p>
<p>My point is that we all have our biases, but this gifted teacher, with her tangible affection for America, would have had that drummed out of her in the first year of today&rsquo;s ed schools. My nieces go to the same school system as I did, but I highly doubt that their American History courses will measure up. And that&rsquo;s a bloody shame.<br>

		<p>This is not area in which I have much knowledge, but here is an anecdote.</p>
<p> A few years ago at a funeral, a thirteen year old relative of a relative stated that she had received an A for her &#8220;presentation&#8221; on MLK. I then asked her when King was born: was it 1928 or 1929? She became  annoyed and told me that &#8220;dates are the old way of studying history&#8221;. </p>
<p>I think that this illustrates it&rsquo;s not just the choice of what is to be taught as history (i.e. MLK vs. Eisenhower), but the way that history is taught. The old questions of What? Where? When? and Who? that school history used to deal with, have been discarded and replaced with wall to wall liberal propaganda.</p>

<p>***************</p>
<p>I suspect the definition of &#8220;liberal&#8221; depends largely on the era.  </p>
<p>I took American History thirty years before you, in the early 1950s. Our teacher (dearly remembered) was also a &#8220;flaming liberal&#8221;   &mdash;   for her time, that is.   Today, she would be considered  a  far right-winger that would embarass anyone on Amren.</p>
<p>She would have been appalled at any of these lefties who are &#8220;teaching&#8221; today. <i>[I really should say &#8220;preaching&#8221;.] </i> They and their anti-American ideology would have been inconceivable then.<br>

		<p>This is just another bit of pseudo-Conservative fluff that pretends you can overcome the effects of making your people a hated minority in their own country by tweaking education, or the laws, or by bringing back the draft, or something.   The real problem isn&rsquo;t that they aren&rsquo;t teaching our country&rsquo;s history,  it&rsquo;s that our country no longer exists.   WE don&rsquo;t have a history because WE aren&rsquo;t WE.   The soon to be a majority of non-white students understand, and their teachers understand, that American history has nothing to do with them.   They&rsquo;re encouraged by the system to see pre &#8216;65 America as the moral equivalent of Nazi Germany,  but that merely aggravates and slightly accelerates the problem, the real problem is that teaching American history to these non-Americans is about as relevant as teaching them Mongolian history.    It&rsquo;s the destruction and replacement of the whites who made that history,  not what their replacements are taught that is important.     Conservatives need to deal with the real problem and demand a moratorium on immigration right now, and a vigorous policy of expulsion for illegals.   The standard conservative line about &#8220;let&rsquo;s all stop being hyphenated Americans&#8221;  is the moral equivalent of selling a quack nostrum to a cancer patient.  </p>

<p>To a large degree, this is what is going on today. And it is in no small part due to the inability to understand history. We might also look at how the sort of White people who once gave the country a modicum of leadership are being displaced by indoctrinated affirmative action hires and such, all to the detriment of realistic problem solving. </p>
<p>In the bigger picture, all this shows that a multicult society simply will not work. Radicalized minorities simply push their own version of history at the expense of traditional Western interests. </p>
