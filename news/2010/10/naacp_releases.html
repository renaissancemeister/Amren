<h1>NAACP Releases Report Accusing Tea Party Groups of Links to Bigots</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Judy L. Thomas, Kansas City Star, October 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Three months ago in Kansas City, the NAACP first raised charges of racism within the tea party movement. Today a report is being released accusing tea party groups of providing platforms to anti-Semites and other bigots.</p>
<p>&#8220;These groups and individuals are out there, and we ignore them at our own peril,&#8221; said NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous in a statement announcing the report. &#8220;They are speaking at tea party events, recruiting at rallies, and in some cases remain in the tea party leadership itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 94-page report is being released by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in a teleconference today.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Here we go again,&#8221; said Judson Phillips, founder of Tea Party Nation. &#8220;This is typical of this liberal group&rsquo;s smear tactics.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Not only have tea parties given platforms to extremists, the news release said, the movement is a recruiting ground for hard-core white nationalists who are &#8220;hoping to push these (white) protesters toward a more self-conscious and ideological white supremacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report, &#8220;Tea Party Nationalism: A Critical Examination of the Tea Party Movement and the Size, Scope, and Focus of Its National Factions,&#8221; was written by Leonard Zeskind and Devin Burghart of the Kansas City-based Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The report cites numerous examples of what it said were racism and extremism within the tea party movement. Some of them, according to the news releases:</p>
<p>* The St. Louis-based Council of Conservative Citizens, the largest white nationalist group in the country, has both led and promoted tea party protests. Roan Garcia-Quintana, a member of ResistNet who served as media spokesman for a 2010 Tax Day Tea Party in South Carolina, is on the national board of directors for the Council of Conservative Citizens.</p>
<p>* Clayton Douglas, a former information officer for the New Mexico Militia, is a member of the ResistNet tea party. He uses his profile on the ResistNet website to advertise his own &#8220;Free American&#8221; website, on which he promotes anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>* The Wood County Tea Party in Texas is led by a woman who used to be involved with the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.</p>
<p>* The 1776 Tea Party  &mdash;  also known as TeaParty.org  &mdash;  is led by Stephen Eichler, executive director of the Minuteman Project, an anti-immigrant border patrol group often referred to as vigilantes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Sal Russo, a California political consultant and chief strategist for the Tea Party Express, called the report ridiculous.</p>
<p>&#8220;To attack a grassroots movement of this magnitude with sundry isolated incidents only goes to show the NAACP has abandoned the cause of civil rights for the advancement of liberal Democrat politics,&#8221; Russo said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The report will be available online this morning at www.teapartynationalism.com.<br/>

		<p> How I wish, in this case, that the NAACP were right about White Nationalists and racial realists having a lot of clout in the Tea Party Movement. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not true, of course. This is just another attempt by the Left to change the subject, and to besmirch the Tea Partiers, for being extremely effective this election year.</p>
<p> Again, won&rsquo;t somebody please organize and start filing some lawsuits against the NAACP, instead of just cowering in fear that they&rsquo;ll file one against YOU? The organization could be bankrupted and run out of business, if people who oppose them would just get together and formulate a plan. Come on, folks; it&rsquo;s not rocket science, you know.</p>

		<p>This was not an NAACP report.  Notice the real authors are from this &#8220;Human Rights&#8221; (i.e. &#8220;human rights&#8221; only for minorities and white leftists; none for white conservatives) Center, that the NAACP just put its stamp on.  I pretty much guessed this was going to be the case, but I thought it would be an ADL or SPLC report with the NAACP stamp.  (It might still be, if it is found the authors were once SPLC/ADL staffers.)  CofCC has more info on Zeskind, including his formation of a leftist militia:</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/32bdhrg</p>
<p>Notice that in two of the four examples they give, those individuals are &#8220;former&#8221; or &#8220;used to be.&#8221;  Too, many of the organizations and potentates that the NAACP would like to think the TPM has many &#8220;links&#8221; to are themselves divided as we are about the Tea Party Movement, negative about its racial pandering as positive about its open-source method of organization.</p>

		<p>You know I read this and I think &#8220;who cares&#8221;?  Then I start wondering if this is targeted at black voters and if there&rsquo;s a general fear out there that blacks will defect in mass November 4? It seems unlikely given that the Democrat Party gives blacks everything they want in exchange for votes.   </p>

		<p>I wonder if the NAACP understands how important their role is in making sure that politically active whites understand that the real issue is race?</p>
<p>The &#8220;tea party&#8221; repeatedly has tried to veer off into the same old impotent conservativism that insists race doesn&rsquo;t exist while trying to deal with crime, poverty, the communist left, etc. and the obvious racial links to these things, while pretending it doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>And every time it seems like history will repeat itself, there is the NAACP reminding the tea party that it really is about race.  No matter how much they would like to ignore it, blacks and hispanics won&rsquo;t allow it&hellip;..will be in your face about it.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Not only have tea parties given platforms to extremists, the news release said, the movement is a recruiting ground for hard-core white nationalists who are &lsquo;hoping to push these (white) protesters toward a more self-conscious and ideological white supremacy.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And we of course who are both white and have brains, could only hope that the above is true and a harbinger of the next phase in the process. This next phase being, that about 65% to 70% of those whites that do regularly vote in elections, become even more militant on the subject of &ldquo;white supremacy&rdquo; and vote accordingly in 2012 and beyond.</p>
<p>Indeed, the NAACP should be worried then, simply because the black race will be in danger of losing its absurdly cherished position (by the current multicultural establishment) as an &ldquo;enriching&rdquo; and protected class of &ldquo;victims.&rdquo; Without the backing of the current self-destructive and genocidal band of rainbow Reds (Democrats) and Pinkos (Neo Con RINOS) protecting and promoting them, they are essentially doomed. Asians and Hispanics will turn on them, as they will no longer be in the fraudulent vanguard of redistribution politics, and whites will be ready to destroy that deranged concept altogether and not buttressing it instead. </p>
<p>In short, the Soul Train will not be volleying toward &ldquo;Da Dream&rdquo; any longer. </p>
<p>Oh, what a pity!</p>

		<p>This is the beginning of censorship. if you don&rsquo;t like what your opponent says and you have no counter argument than start the name calling (&#8220;Racist, phobic, bigot, intolerant, hate speech, etc&#8221;), the false accusations and have them silenced. Same stuff that happened in communist countries. Anybody not towing the party line must be an enemy of the state or a mental case so have them silenced and imprisoned.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a counter-example of &#8220;racism and extremism&#8221; within the NAACP.</p>
<p>The NC NAACP&rsquo;s performance during the Duke lacrosse rape hoax caught the attention of Stuart Taylor, a columnist for the National Journal, a contributing editor for Newsweek and author with K. C. Johnson of UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT: Political Correctness and the Shameful Injustices of the Duke Lacrosse Rape Case.  Here&rsquo;s Taylor, courtesy of the BOOKTV.org:</p>
<p>&#8220;The local [state level] NAACP and other local black leaders  &mdash; - enough to be a critical mass  &mdash;  basically crusaded to attack the lacrosse players.  They joined the mob. They misrepresented the truth regularly, repeatedly, and grossly.  They supported the rogue prosecutor long after he had been proven a rogue prosecutor &hellip; they threw away whatever shreds were left of their own credibility.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Conservative media outlets knew this was coming months ago. Why do they not have a report about the NAACP&rsquo;s ties to Black racist groups such as the New Black Panthers and Hispanic racist groups such as La Raza. The Tea party groups make a big show of purging their ranks of sacrificial race realists who are easy to mislabel as racists, but the NAACP makes no effort to denounce or distance themselves from rabid Black and Brown racists.</p>
<p>The appropriate response to accusations such as this one should be a resounding SO WHAT.</p>

		<p>10 Old White Jim:</p>
<p>There was the Breitbart/Sherrod piece.  The point of that piece was to show that the NAACP conference attendees cheered Ms Sherrod when she said that she didn&rsquo;t want to help a white person in her duties as a Federal bureaucrat.  Then after that, when she said she had her &#8220;epiphany,&#8221; and said how wrong she was, there was stone cold silence from the very same NAACP-ers in the same room that was boisterous just a few moments before.</p>
<p>But because Breitbart&rsquo;s first version cut off before the &#8220;epiphany&#8221; part, people kept making an issue about selective editing.  It was accidental editing, and if not for that accident, it would have looked even worse for the NAACP.</p>
<p>Point remains, that wasn&rsquo;t the cleanest hit against the NAACP.  Best response would have been to use James Edwards&rsquo;s words, &#8220;racism schmacism.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Too bad it isn&rsquo;t true about the Tea Party being bigots and racists!  They are too busy trying to recruit black candidates to run for office and bringing in all these minorities under the big tent just to prove they are tolerant and loving.</p>
<p> The Tea Party has denounced any White who knows what is really going on in this country and who has the guts to put the White race first and foremost. They are nothing but a little girl&rsquo;s tea party full of sweetness and light and ignorant about race.</p>
<p>Guess you can tell that they have turned me off completely to their cause. When it comes to racial issues, they are just like the libtards. Both sides trying to outdo the other in groveling.</p>

		<p>The NAACP needs to get more white advisors.  Blacks trying to play mind games is like starting a fire fight low on ammo.</p>
<p>Every time they try one of these childish stunts they lose a little bit of credibility.</p>
<p>I realize they also think that these constant moronic attacks will drive the Tea Party movement to take on more blacks, and the gullibles in the movement have responded, but just slightly.  Not enough to really matter.  Blacks are not going to be included in the Tea Party in anything but minimal numbers.</p>
<p>With funds to these leftist organizations starting to dry up due to hard economic times, it&rsquo;s just a matter of time before we read of them cutting back office locations and personnel.</p>
<p>Right now the expert opinion is talking about the collapse of university funding, calling it the next sector to be ravaged by lack of funds.  </p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a shame if blacks and feminists had their nonsense studies eliminated due to a lack of money?</p>

<p>Yeah Judson - here we go again. All that groveling you did last time these NAACP thugs yelled racism didn&rsquo;t earn you any points with them did it. I truly hope this was a learning experience for you.

		<p>The NAACP is a racist group themselves.  They go about the country pressuring small and medium cities to provide more governemnt jobs to blacks.  They send blacks, since they have pull with INS, and send the newcomers from Africa or wherever, right to majority white towns.  This should be illegal because it is not a natural population drift, but a planned socialist tactic for robbing citizens of their jobs, their families, their future.</p>
<p>The NAACP, La Raza, etc., are all engaged in a version of this.  Whites who organize against it will be called &#8220;racist.&#8221;  They rely on the power of that word and all the horror it can conjur up.  Whites are supposed to fear the loss of their jobs, their homes, their respect&hellip;  To all that I reply,  REPEAT AFTER ME;</p>
<p>RACISM - SCHACISM!</p>
<p>Since more and more whites have already lost their jobs due to affirmative action, or never even got to start if they are under 40, accusations of &#8220;racism&#8221; are not going to have that much power very soon.  They will have to pass a law that imprisons whites for being &#8220;racist,&#8221; and hold Stalinoid style show trials to condemn them.  Don&rsquo;t think that this won&rsquo;t be tried.  I&rsquo;ve seen that suggestion made by liberals in online posts many times, especially during the last presidential campaign.</p>

<p>The Minutemen are just doing the job the federal government is refusing to do.  God bless those &#8220;vigilantes&#8221;.  How many ties does the Obama movement have to haters in the Nation of Islam and MEChA?  Quite a few.  After all, Obama&rsquo;s preacher of 19 years is a good friend of Louis Farrakhan.  The SPLC, normally eager to smear a person by his &#8220;ties and connections&#8221;, is mighty coy about Obama&rsquo;s two degrees of separation.</p>
<p>As for the Council of Conservative Citizens, they are whites organized to promote the interests of whites, just as the NAACP consists of blacks organized to promote the interests of blacks. While the CoCC does oppose affirmative action (discrimination against whites) it does not promote government discrimination against non-whites.  By contrast, the NAACP does promote government discrimination against whites to the benefit of blacks.  But the CoCC is always labeled a hate group while the NAACP is labeled a civil rights group.  The hypocrisy stinks.</p>

		<p>Dont you find it rich that the NAACP is outraged by the &#8220;possibility&#8221; that anti-semitic groups &#8220;may&#8221; or &#8220;could possibly&#8221; be drawn to the tea parties when the same NAACP gave a lifetime image award to Louis Farrakhan  &mdash;   the biggest anti-semite this side of Islamabad.</p>
<p>  Jealous gets worked up at one or two signs out of tens of thousands that &#8220;could be interpeted as bigoted&#8221;. Yet he praises Farrahkhan who has given speech after speech filled with the most virulent hate-filled anti-jewish, anti-white, anti-gay anti-american screed that is the equal of anything out of Ahminijads stinking pie-hole.</p>
<p> Now mind you, Farrahkhan wasnt just in the back of the meeting, the guy didnt just &#8220;sneak in the back. The entire evening was a celebration of the hateful reptile Farrahkhan. And the tea-party gives a platform to bigots???</p>
<p>   RICH INDEED  </p>

		<p>Until whites stand up and declare this farce over, race politics, political correctness, and the way is clear for communists to continue their march.  I was talking to a local moderate office seeker who admitted to me that the black power structure, allied with a white socialist supervisor of elections, offered votes to him in return for influence in his decisions while seated on a local commission.  It&rsquo;s one thing for us to fight overwelming odds such as the mainstream media or the welfare cancer but how can we remain passive where these groups have stolen our birthright?  Frankly, while I support the constitutional quest of the Tea Party, I just laugh at their bootlicking to appear oh so correct.</p>

In other words, while this may make for red-meat &#8220;news&#8221; for the left-leaning media to spew, or for liberal cadidates and talking-heads to spout, it really doesn&rsquo;t honestly affect a thing.  </p>

		<p>Leonard Zeskind, the main author of the NAACP attack on the TEA Party movement, is not a &ldquo;colored person&rdquo; and only interested in advancing Marxism (and his own bank account).</p>
<p>The NAACP chose a hard-core Communist and Mo Dees style con artist to pen its expose.</p>
<p>Zeskind published a book on &ldquo;white racism&rdquo; in 2009, which was a flop. He makes a living charging money to give speeches about &ldquo;white racism,&rdquo; and is trying to build a rival SPLC-style left-wing fund-raising hustle. On his profile with his booking agent he is listed under &ldquo;Jewish Interest Speakers.&rdquo; He is listed as having written articles for left-wing publications in the US and extreme-leftwing publications in Europe and Britain. He has even written articles for the openly Marxist &ldquo;Searchlight&rdquo; magazine in Britain.</p>
<p>In 1973, Zeskind surfaces as the leader of a militant Marxist group in Kansas City, known as The Sojourner Truth Organization. Literature for the group quoted mass murderer Joseph Stalin and called for &ldquo;Revolution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1978, Zeskind penned an article for an openly Marxist Urgent Tasks, in which he calls for communist revolution.</p>
<p>In 1980, Zeskind is profiled in Kansas City Magazine. They called him a menace to &ldquo;non-violent groups&rdquo; on the left.</p>
<p>In 1986, Zeskind is listed as a leader in the National Anti-Klan Network[NAKN]. A heavily armed militant group closely connected to the American Communist Party. The Communist Party publication described the NAKN as &ldquo;pro-Peking Stalinist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sources.</p>
<p>In November 2009, Zeskind opened the IREHR, his own rival SPLC. His vice president is a former director of the Center for New Community, another wannabe SPLC  fund-raising hustle that never went anywhere.</p>
<p>The purpose of the IREHR is to solicit donations using outlandish shock articles that portray the majority of all Americans as &ldquo;racists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The IREHR is much more openly militant than the SPLC. It states that anyone who suggests that &ldquo;America is a Christian nation,&rdquo; is an &ldquo;Anti-Semite.&rdquo; It also says the &ldquo;overwhelming majority of white people continue to take for granted the relative privileges accruing to their skin color.&rdquo; Meaning that most whites are somehow, someway subtly abusing non-whites. </p>
<p>The IREHR also says it is dedicated to &ldquo;Native American Sovereignty Rights.&rdquo; A mission statement that is hypocritically in direct odds with their stated goals of a &ldquo;multi-racial, multicultural society.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Good. I&rsquo;m not completely thrilled by the Tea Party, as they worry too much about the &#8220;racist&#8221; name calling.  But finally, I think plenty of whites are tired of having to pay for the non-stop government gravy train that does nothing but continuously subsidize black social pathologies. If  the NAACP really lived up to it&rsquo;s name, it would be addressing these problems like the high percentage of babies being born out of wedlock, crime, health, the school drop out rate, etc.  But don&rsquo;t bet on it.</p>

		<p>   Yes, I&rsquo;m sure that some &#8220;bigots&#8221; support the Tea Party movement. In the same way, some Marxists support the Obama administration. What does that prove? I don&rsquo;t see how that discredits the Tea Party&rsquo;s desire for limited Constitutional government and a rational immigration policy.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure most &#8220;Tea Party&#8221; participants have been hearing this kind of drivel for a good while.  They&rsquo;ve also been watching the news enough to know that there are profound anti-white-people tendencies in the Obama administration.  This creates conversation opportunities.  Next time I&rsquo;m chatting with people I know who are involved in the TP, I just might mention, &#8220;You know, there really is a racial aspect to all of this&hellip;.&#8221;  Two years ago that kind of remark would have gotten nowhere.  Now, thanks to the NAACP, the Obama administration, and various over-the-top commentators like Steven Thrasher, white people who have become politically active due to the Tea Party movement might be receptive to a racial interpretation, in spite of grovelings of various TP &#8220;leaders.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Blacks are always showing that they are biggest hypocrites when it comes to racial issues.  They are more upset that this is a group of whites organizing to stop big government.  Blacks love big government because it gives them all their entitlement programs and they see taking tax dollars from whites as payback.  This is why they are scared of whites organizing for small government, even if we aren&rsquo;t calling for violence like the K or the Nazi groups.  Again, to most black people, racism equals white people.  To them, racists have no rights.  Which means white people should not have any rights.  Tell your white friends that it will wake more of them up.</p>

		<p> <i>the NAACP first raised charges of racism within the tea party movement. Today a report is being released accusing tea party groups of providing platforms to anti-Semites and other bigots.<br/>
 <br/>
&ldquo;These groups and individuals are out there, and we ignore them at our own peril,&rdquo; said NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous in a statement announcing the report. &ldquo;They are speaking at tea party events, recruiting at rallies, and in some cases remain in the tea party leadership itself.&rdquo;</i><br/>
____________________________</p>
<p>Why whould the National Association for Colored People be concerned about, uh, &#8220;anti-semites&#8221; when their specialty is (supposedly) &#8220;colored people&#8221;?</p>
<p><br/>
Furthermore, we see from these protests that they are not interested in maintaining an open political forum for ALL people and all views, but  rather with EXCLUDING certain people and views from any place in the political forum whatsoever.  Thus, they are not truly dedicated to democratic principles    &mdash;    only to getting their own way.</p>
<p><i>Not only have tea parties given platforms to extremists, the news release said, the movement is a recruiting ground for hard-core white nationalists who are &ldquo;hoping to push these (white) protesters toward a more self-conscious and ideological white supremacy.&rdquo; </i></p>
<p>Thus, &#8220;extremists&#8221;  (as they chhose to define them), and &#8220;white nationalists&#8221; are  not entitled to ANY voice, and must not be heard.  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s democracy?   In true democracy, you debate  your opposition and try to defeat it that way; you don&rsquo;t connive to silence it.  That&rsquo;s totalitarianism.<br/>

		<p>The hypocrisy of this sham organization is overwhelming.  When they promote their racial agenda of destroying white culture, it is tagged as &#8220;civil rights&#8221;.  White political activism, on the other hand, is &#8220;bigotry&#8221;.  The goal of white political activism is emancipation from the need to endure &#8220;minority&#8221; crime and freedom from the economic drain of unproductive racial groups that consider it their due to live off others.  They seek to enslave us to a cultural regimen that is totally abhorrent; we seek nothing more than economic, and social separation from that culture.  Where is the bigotry? </p>

		<p>This is another attempt to shut white people up and stop them from working on issues that have a direct impact on their self-interests. The blacks and MSM have overplayed the race card so many times that their shrieking now has almost no impact on even the mainline, &#8220;color-blind&#8221; conservatives.</p>
<p>As much as so many have complained about the Tea Party, I see them as a positive move for all whites and conservatives of all stripes because:</p>
<p>They are against high taxation, bailouts, and the welfare state.</p>
<p>They support smaller, decentralized government and have voiced strong sentiments about states rights and the overreach of the Federal Government.</p>
<p>They are reading the constitution. </p>
<p>They are actually working en masse against the goals of both the Establishment left and right.</p>
<p>They are more likely to be nationalists than globalists.</p>
<p>They are more likely anti-affirmative action and anti-hate crime legislation. </p>
<p>Just because they haven&rsquo;t had their awakening doesn&rsquo;t mean they aren&rsquo;t making a positive difference. The Further Right needs to be more patient. The Frankfurt School didn&rsquo;t take over every major US institution in two tears. Tea Parties are part of a creeping incrementalism on the right.      </p>

		<p>No doubt if the NAACP went looking for WN among Mothers Against Drunk Driving or the Salvation Army they might find a couple there, too. But it&rsquo;s not like Tea Party candidates have Nation of Islam members on the payroll or launched their campaigns in Bill Ayre&rsquo;s living room. Oh wait, that was Obama who did that.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been pretty surprised lately.  More young whites are expressing negative views of the future of this country and are getting less and less afraid to voice that opinion.</p>
<p>I work in an environment with 100% black and latino teens, and (of course) nearly all the teaching staff is white (though the support staff and administration is almost all non-white - things that don&rsquo;t require actual wide content knowledge).</p>
<p>I am so surprised to find young, white liberals, even women, who realize something has gone wrong in the country, and who acknowledge that no matter what they do, their students &#8220;just ain&rsquo;t learnin&rsquo; a gosh darned thing!&rsquo;&#8221;</p>

<p>&hellip;&#8221; There are probably a few baby-boomer tea partiers that sympathize, more or less, with our side, but they are not the sort with whom the establishment need concern themselves. &#8220;</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell what you are talking about.  But the white realist movement needs everyone - every white they can recruit, ESPECIALLY baby boomers.  Traditional conservative Christians have no hope at all if they cannot be tolerant of other whites with different outlooks, but the same desire to save the race.  Wise up, or fade out.<br/>

		<p>This isn&rsquo;t exactly on topic but there was a report on Philadelphia evening news about a rash of thefts on the Market- Frankford El line. Thieves have been snatching cell phones and other electronic devices from passengers. and apparently it&rsquo;s been going on for some time now. Anyone surprised. SEPTA (Southeast Pennsylvania Transit Authority) has made a video to instruct passengers on how to protect themselves from these thefts. The method used by the robbers is to snatch and run using accomplices to block the victim from pursuing the &#8220;snatcher&#8221;. The video uses actors to portray the people involved. Guess what? The &#8220;thieves&#8221; are all young White guys who are stealing from a Black passenger.<br/>
It&rsquo;s getting more and more insane by the day. </p>
