			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), October 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Her stunning looks won her a coveted title in New Zealand&rsquo;s Miss India contest.</p>
<p>But Jacinta Lal, 21, was today at the centre of a huge row after she was accused of not looking Indian enough.</p>
<p>The blue-eyed blonde, whose father is Fijian-Indian and mother a New Zealander, was booed by spectators when she won the Wellington leg of the MissIndiaNZ contest.</p>
<p>Organisers later confirmed that there had been &#8216;two or three&rsquo; complaints about Miss Lal&rsquo;s eligibility.</p>
<p>The row comes just days after the Indian government protested to New Zealand about alleged racial slurs by TV host Paul Henry.</p>
<p>Miss Lal told the New Zealand Herald she had heard people say that she was not &#8216;Indian-looking enough to win the pageant&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8216;But despite those small-minded people that made those comments, there were many Indians who encouraged me to enter.</p>
<p>&#8216;So just because some narrow-minded people make a comment like that we can&rsquo;t assume that all Indians think the same way.</p>
<p>&#8216;There is no difference between what Paul Henry is saying and what those select few Indians were saying. They are all wrong and should not say things like that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Miss Lal (left) is one of two runners-up in the Miss India contest: She branded her critics &#8216;narrow-minded&rsquo;</p>
<p>Organiser Dharmesh Parikh said that he had also had complaints when Miss Lal took part in the MissIndiaNZ finals in Auckland in August and became one of two runners-up.</p>
<p>&#8216;People said: &#8220;Oh my God look at this blonde girl coming to Miss IndiaNZ, what is she doing here?,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8216;Whoever these people are, they are a very small part of it.</p>
<p>&#8216;This event is called Miss IndiaNZ, with an N-Z, and I strongly emphasise that this event is not an Indian event, it is a Kiwi-Indian event, so you must have New Zealand residency, New Zealand citizenship and you must have some sort of Indian background.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8216;It is a little bit sad, but it is unfortunate for Jacinta as well because she should be accepted into this Indian world as well because she is a beautiful Indian girl.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>Hey this girl exemplifies what the Indo-Aryan Indians looked like before they entered into mixed marriages with the native peoples, who were darker skinned.  Remember brown eyes and dark features are dominant over blue eyes and fair features.  Yet, there are still a number of Indians (not huge), who could pass for European. </p>

		<p>I tend to agree with those who object.  Like other races/ethnicities, Indians have their own way they can look beautiful.  There is Indian beauty and there is North European Beauty.  Miss Lal does not have Indian beauty (and she is mixed) and I&rsquo;m sure there were plenty of very beautiful Indian girls whose appearance flatters the Indian people.  One of them should have been chosen.</p>

		<p>[Shrug]  One of my best friends in Australia is a 1/4 Aboriginee - the rest is Scottish and Russian.  He and his Chinese wife just had a little boy.  The kid has blond hair and blue eyes.  He&rsquo;s basically a white kid with epicanthic eyefolds.</p>
<p>My own daughter, half-Japanese and 3/32 northeast Amerind has grey eyes and light brown hair; if white features were completely recessive, there wouldn&rsquo;t be any whites left by now.</p>

		<p>Narrow-minded?  Because the contest is Miss India not Miss Wannabe White Woman.  At least Indians acknowledged she made herself look un-Indian meaning white.  East Asians don&rsquo;t even do that.  East Asians want us to believe they naturally have wide, round eyes and straight, pointy noses with defined bridges and oval shaped heads.  East Asian cartoons depict East Asians as tween looking white people.  Joanna Pitman wrote a book called On Blondes six years ago dealing with the history and fascination with blonde hair.</p>

		<p>God, how ridiculous!  There are plenty of Indian women who are drop-dead gorgeous by any standard.  Of course, most have dark eyes and hair.  So what&rsquo;s the big deal about a girl of partially Indian blood winning a beauty contest among Indians?</p>

		<p>Poster #7 is right.  There are some very, very fine looking women from India.  They have women who are as white as you and me with all the fine features we associate with European heritage.</p>
<p>Why?  Because the same ancestors of the Europeans (the Aryans) went to India also.  They conquered the darker races there and some intermixed, but the development of the caste system mitigated that with lighter skinned Indians lording it over the rest.</p>
<p>There are people in northern India, northern Pakistan and Afghanistan who are indistinguishable from Europeans and white Americans.  Don&rsquo;t forget too that Alexander the Great planted Greek colonies all over the region later on, reinforcing the white belt there.  There is more &#8216;white&rsquo; blood out there than most people realize.  It sometimes comes in different packages.</p>

		<p>And why, exactly, does New Zealand have a Miss India contest?  If Indians can have a contest where only they are allowed, in someone else&rsquo;s country, then why can&rsquo;t we have contests just for whites?  Anyway, regardless of what I think about this contest in general, I agree with the angry Indians that this woman does not look Indian enought o be in this silly contest.  In a beauty contest, isn&rsquo;t it how a person looks that matters?  Beauty contests are all about looks, and so if there is a contest for Indians, you must LOOK Indian to participate, in my opinion.</p>

		<p>Michael C. Scott (#4): I find your anecdote about the repressiveness of white traits rather amusing. Despite the results of your race-mixing experimentation, it is a scientific fact that white traits are completely recessive.</p>
<p>That being said, when breeding two heterozygotes (having one dominant allele and one recessive allele each) there is a 25% chance that each recessive allele will be inherited by the new offspring, making it homozygous recessive, and as a result exhibiting the recessive traits.</p>

		<p>I agree with Indian protestors, albeit for a wholly different reason. The most Indian looking of the three (the petite woman on the right) is by quite a wide margin in my opinion, the  prettiest. Pardon me ladies, but the blond in the middle and the brunette on the right look a little shall we say chunky,  </p>

		<p>It is well to note that Indians themselves regard Kashmiri women - ivory-skinned, delicate-featured, brunette and green eyes - as the most beautiful; and they have a point (g).<br>
Besides, the dame in question cannot very well deny Fijian ancestry :).<br>

what pops up in the F2 generation is largely a matter of chance. The genes for eye and hair colour are on the same chromosome, so absent a crossing-over things can happen. I wouldn´t regard that as falsification of the concept of &#8220;recessive&#8221;(which regards only the phenotype of the F1).</p>

		<p>I am a traditional Southern girl, and I despise feminism.  However, whenever a story about a beauty pageant comes up on this website, I am disgusted by most of the comments coming from male posters. And if you consider the type of person I am, that says a whole lot.</p>
<p>Before I go into my rant, I must admit that I am actually impressed with most of the comments under this article inparticular which usually isn&rsquo;t the case.</p>
<p>As has been pointed out, this competition took place in New Zealand, and NOT India. Indians in New Zealand can get over it. Some of you have missed the memo on that, and wish to discuss how beautiful Indian women are, which is beside the point.</p>
<p>Second, why are you so sympathetic with the Indians who are upset, when, on the other hand, at times when American Renaissance posts articles about dark ethnic women winning pageants in Western countries, most of you think it is fine and dandy?</p>
<p>All that matters to most men on here is whether the woman is hot or not.  If she is hot, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if she is from Saudi Arabia, India, or Uzbekhistan, she most certainly qualifies to represent any Western country.  Some of you will even say she is more beautiful and more feminine that most white women.</p>
<p>Why do white women waste their time with this website?</p>

<p>Any man who subordinates the hotness factor in a woman to racial consciousness is either gay or impotent. Harsh but true. Who would straight men prefer to sleep with, a hot Hindu Bollywood Goddess or a pale, fat Lancashire crumpet?</p>

		<p>Courtney has it right.  The topic is miscegenation between Indians and whites, not beauty.</p>
<p>Indians are a threat to white bloodlines, just like any other non-white. No matter how light-skinned they are, they are tens of thousands of years separated from us in history, culture, genetics and values.</p>
<p>When I look at the contestant, I see Indian features with blondish hair.  I do not see a white. </p>

This incident puts a spotlight on the contempt Indian immigrants have toward New Zealand in light of New Zealands interest to appease illegal ethnic groups.<br>
Since New Zealnd is one of the new white nations of earth, no one can claim to be a New Zealnder unless they are white and patriotic.</p>

<p>Jack replies:</p>
<p>OK Courtney, I understand your position. But many of us men here do not just care if a woman looks &#8220;hot&#8221;; we would like for women to be healthy, somewhat attractive and supportive of White men and not join the list of bitter enemies in the world that hate White men and accuse of all kinds of ridiculous things like being the most sexist, oppressive men in the world.</p>
<p>You say that you &#8220;despise feminism&#8221; - well let&rsquo;s see a little less talk and a lot more action in this area. Why do so many White American women waste their most productive, child bearing years pursuing worthless graduate education degrees or spend all their time in careers or push terrible, bad Leftist politics? There are healthy, good White men around you - notice them, give them some encouragement, you don&rsquo;t have to be some super &#8220;hot&#8221; international beauty contestant to warm up a bit from the cold, bitter no fun feminists we have to deal with every day.</p>

		<p>Until I read post #27 (Courtney), I thought, &#8216;These folk don&rsquo;t get it.&#8221; Then I read this sane Southern woman&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, if you are White, there should be NO &#8216;second look&rsquo; to a woman not of your race, or your ethnos. Historically, this is known as miscegenation, and it is the responsibility of the MALE to curb his lust, in obeying the law code of all Western Lands- i.e., the Ten Commandments.</p>
<p>But, even if you disagree with me on that one (and I am sure many do, so bad are the times and seasons of our decline) the fact that this woman is DENIED place, PRECISELY because she &#8216;seems white&rsquo; is the RAGING DOUBLE STANDARD being directed towards ALL Whites today.</p>
<p>As the article over at WVWN noted, this is a psychological attempt at GENOCIDE.<br>
<a href="http://wvwnews.net/story.php?id=9391" rel="nofollow">http://wvwnews.net/story.php?id=9391</a></p>
<p>And lusting after a &#8216;dark-skinned&rsquo; beauty is merely being an accessory to the above crime.</p>

		<p>Jack in Chicago,</p>
<p>You want less talk and more action from me on this topic?  Okay, I think it would help if first you knew more about me before judging me.</p>
<p>I am in my late twenties and I have dated a lot of men (ONLY WHITE MEN).  With some of them it didn&rsquo;t work out simply because of lack of chemistry.  For others, it was because I was &#8220;too conservative&#8221; or &#8220;too traditional&#8221; or &#8220;too racially conscious&#8221; for them.</p>
<p>I am from the Deep South and I have been spending a great deal of time working in a Northern state during most of my adult life.  I am doing whatever I can to move back South.  </p>
<p>Up here, I have either dated guys who share my same viewpoints, but due to the fact that we were from different regions of the country, there were cultural differences that were too big to ignore, and it just didn&rsquo;t work out.  The other scenario  has been that some of the guys I have dated have dumped me because my pride in my Southern heritage has turned them off.  Other times it is because I am too conservative and &#8220;old fashioned&#8221;.  Other times it was because the guy didn&rsquo;t really have any long term goals and he just didn&rsquo;t seem like the right guy to raise a family with.</p>
<p>When I get married I want to compliment my man and fill the role that I am supposed to fulfill to make him happy.  I am willing to stay home to raise the kids while he is at work.  When he comes home from work I want to look nice, have meals ready, and get him a beer while he watches TV. That is the kind of woman I am.</p>
<p>Due to my dating experience, I have come to the conclusion that it is best to find a guy back home where I am from.  In the office that I have worked in up here in the North, I had to spend the day around a bunch of whiney feminists who would flirt with men and then complain when they would hit on them back.  Believe me, in all those scenarios, I stood up for the men.</p>
<p>It disgusts me how, despite my viewpoints on how idiotic feminism is, and how white males are discriminated against, it is still hard for me to find white men who think the same way I do without getting turned off.  </p>
<p>So, obviously, before you, Jack, judge me, it is best you know more about me obviously.</p>
<p>In regards to my comments on this website, I am sorry, but I am just basing my attitude from what I have seen from men on here.  When articles on beauty pageants are put up that deal with a nonwhite girl winning in a Western country I see the same sorts of comments over and over again&hellip;..&#8221;oh she is prettier and more feminine that most white women&#8221;&hellip;.&#8221;oh she is hot enough so what does it matter&#8221;.</p>
<p>How do you expect me to react?</p>
<p>The fact that those are unfair generalizations, is beside the point.  Most white women are obviously more beautiful than most nonwhite women, at least that is the way it SHOULD be when assessed by the eyes of WHITE MEN.</p>
<p>However, the main point is that nonwhite women, no matter how beautiful, have no business representing white countries in beauty pageants.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any man who subordinates the hotness factor in a woman to racial consciousness is either gay or impotent. Harsh but true. Who would straight men prefer to sleep with, a hot Hindu Bollywood Goddess or a pale, fat Lancashire crumpet?&#8221;</p>
<p>As I was just now saying&hellip;&hellip;..</p>

<p>&#8220;All that matters to most men on here is whether the woman is hot or not. If she is hot, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if she is from Saudi Arabia, India, or Uzbekhistan, she most certainly qualifies to represent any Western country. Some of you will even say she is more beautiful and more feminine that most white women.</p>
<p>Why do white women waste their time with this website?&#8221;</p>
<p>Gee Courtney, I have been posting on this site since the time of Hurricane Katrina (an event that really activated me), and I can&rsquo;t say that all I see is men concerned with how hot a woman is when a beauty contest is the subject.  I notice a few, but most are centered around the real concerns.  Perhaps the ones that do this really stand out to you, but I wonder what the numbers really are because I just don&rsquo;t see the problem that upsets you enough to write your closing question above.</p>
<p>I was not brought up in the South, but I am married to a Southern Belle if there ever was one.  Such unions can exist.</p>
<p><br>
I always appreciate your comments and wish more women like you were out there.  Don&rsquo;t go away because there are a few immature, shallow, posters out there.<br>

		<p>I have to wonder why NZ or any country feels they must have a contest representing another country within its borders?  It must be an excuse for revenues - profits, because this is a bunch of nothing.</p>
<p>On the other hand, how can a woman from Lebanon, dark and Arabic looking, be Miss America if Miss India must &#8220;look Indian.&#8221;  Anyone sense any double standard hypocrisy here?</p>
<p>If we are going to have all these increased events, with promoters thinking up any category they can, there will eventually have to be some national and international rules that concern ethnic and racial identities or else they will become more meaningless than they already are, and those very promoters will loose their collective b^$$s.</p>
<p>Personally, I think the entire thing is a sham since every successful man(and unsuccessful man that can) in the world I can think of usually picks a blonde as their trophy wife.</p>

<p>Actually, I have had that choice, nearly.  I consciously select the white woman from Lancashire, however derisively and with whatever anti-white language you use to describe her.  I would help her where I could with her health and self-image and we would make several beautiful white children together.  That is my fantasy response to your arrogant question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yest Istvan, the Indians should be living in India and not New Zealand.</p>
<p>But what the heck are Europeans doing there also? Shouldn&rsquo;t Europeans be living in Europe and not New Zealand also? You bunch of hypocrites.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indians had thousands of years in the region and did not explore or expand because they were, 1. Not curious by nature, and 2. Given to inter-tribal warfare until the British came a civilized nearly that entire part of the world.  Since 1948, what progress India has made is entirely due to Western and specifically English influence.  Today&rsquo;s New Zealand is a civilization created by those people.  Indians and others come in and make accusations and arguments like yours, but they still haven&rsquo;t got the intelligence, or honor to create a casteless society in India, or even clean up the terrible problems of sanitation and poeverty in India.  Yet, they expand, due to their Bollywood enhanced obsession with sex.</p>

<p>Regarding your second sentence, I&rsquo;m sure you are right about most (non-black) men, but you&rsquo;ve set up a false choice here. </p>
<p>Your first sentence is just wrong. If Plato is right about anything, it is that love is the desire for immortal beauty, and as most can never hope to replicate the feats of Achilles, they procreate. If your desire, conscious or not, is to produce a &#8220;better you&#8221; for the next generation, it is not odd that people tend to marry people &#8220;like themselves.&#8221; This certainly applies to physical form too. I am not blind to the charms of the women of other races-I think that Indian women can be absolutely beautiful, that black and E. Asian women are not, but some tall and thin black women have sexy bodies and practically every third E. Asian girl is a cutie-but I am never literally attracted to them, and I think this is why.</p>

		<p>Whiteplight,</p>
<p>Thanks for the kind words.  You are one of the higher caliber posters on here as well.</p>
<p>As for my interpretations of the conversations that take place on this website,&hellip;yes, perhaps at times I tend to focus too much on the comments that are negative.</p>
<p>However, I can easily give you two different examples of articles that went up that MOSTLY generated comments representative of what I am saying.</p>
<p>The first was an article that went up a long time ago in the Fall of 2005.  It was an article about an Uzbek girl who won the Miss England pageant.  Most of the comments consisted of men saying things along the lines of &#8220;who cares&hellip;.she is hot&#8221;.  Other men were saying she was &#8220;white enough&#8221; when she clearly wasn&rsquo;t.  </p>
<p>The comments were skewed so far in the wrong direction that I felt obliged to go to the &#8220;Miss England&#8221; website and pull up pictures of beautiful blonde, red head, and brunette English women who were turned down for this Uzbek &#8220;beauty&#8221; that didn&rsquo;t even represent true English beauty.</p>
<p>Needless to say, after I did that, the tone of the comments changed.</p>
<p>Another article got put up recently dealing with the Lebanese woman who won the Miss U.S.A. pageant.  Again, the comments under that article were skewed very far in the wrong direction.  In fact, there was another article that was put up simultaneously about the white Miss Nebraska who was booed for speaking up about illegal immigration when asked a question by the judges.  The comments under that article were skewed more in the positive direction, which prompted me to post a compliment to the men posting.</p>
<p>You are right, that I could be over exaggerating, but those are two examples of articles that mostly generated comments along the lines of what I am saying.</p>
<p>In regards to my other comments, yes, I agree there are many nice men from up North.  I wasn&rsquo;t trying to stereotype them negatively.  I am just basing my opinions on my own dating experience.  They have just tended to not be compatible with me.  Even very conservative ones disagreed with me on the issue of guns, and that is just one example.</p>
<p>It is all about chemistry, and I think it would be foolish to just settle for anyone. I also want to eventually settle down close to family with a guy who wouldn&rsquo;t mind living with me in Alabama. That is another factor too.</p>

<p>With all due respect, I suspect you ended up the way you did precisely because you didn&rsquo;t have the choice. Boys will be boys as the old adage goes; so let&rsquo;s not be delusional.  Feminine beauty is a powerful aphrodisiac and  men have sought it out (often violently) since time immemorial. </p>

		<p>Jack in Chicago at 4:09 PM, white women have the lowest employment rate among racial groups in America.  That&rsquo;s because white women decide to stay home when they get married.  White men when they decide to marry interracially usually go for East Asian women who have the highest employment and highest education rate of any group.  So I don&rsquo;t buy the bull put forward that white men go for non-white women because of feminism.  I do think more white women need to be in shape and have softer personalities to attract white men.</p>
<p>Fr. John at 4:36 PM, I agree with you 100% on white bloodlines needing to stay white.  There are a lot of white people who claim to be pro-white yet date interracially or even have interracial children.  I look at the Miss India New Zealand a different way.  I see it as yet another attempt by a non-white person to take on a white appearance, to bask in the light of white beauty.  What I was saying in my earlier comment, Anonymous wrote at 7:42 PM, is get your own identity.  White appearance as well as anything white is not up for grabs.</p>

<p>Couldn&rsquo;t agree with you more. A lot of men who say they date unattractive white women out of racial loyalty simply cannot do any better. If you are less educated, unattractive and poor, a fat white hag is probably the only partner you will ever be able to muster. Hot women of any race will forever remain an unobtainable fantasy&hellip;.<br>

		<p>I am going to post a comment of similar nature to this one under another article, but has anyone on here watched the new sitcom &#8220;Outsourced&#8221;? I liked it at first, but after watching the third episode, I think I am finished with it. </p>
<p>The hot, attractive, young white male American character working in India, has suddenly developed an interest in the most &#8220;attractive&#8221; Indian woman in his office.  </p>
<p>The episode started where he and a bunch of his co-workers (both Western and Indian) went out to eat together.  The hot attractive American male character made it clear in one of the earlier episodes that he doesn&rsquo;t get emotionally attached to women too quickly (which is the way God made most men anyways).  </p>
<p>Despite all this, this American guy continues to flirt with the attractive Indian woman at the table, even though she made it clear that she can only date someone who her parents pick for her to marry.  The episode ends where this naive white man still continues to pursue her, when I personally think she really wasn&rsquo;t worth the bother.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, there was a blonde female Australian character in the episode who is trying to win this man&rsquo;s effection too.  Yet, he ignores her until the very end of the episode when the Indian woman makes it clear she isn&rsquo;t interested, and the white blonde Australian woman has to throw herself at him and tell him she is available for sex.</p>
<p>I am done watching this sitcom for a few reasons, but the main reason is that I see this as a slam against white women.  </p>
<p>First of all, the attractive Indian woman in this sitcom is hardly attractive by Western standards.  She is attractive by Indian standards. She has the stereotypical extra large eyes, and bird beaked nose.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the blonde Australian woman should be 10 times more appealing in the looks department from any sane white man&rsquo;s perspective.  So I don&rsquo;t understand why the white American didn&rsquo;t develop an interest in the Australian woman first before he knew anything about her personality.</p>
<p>Second, what white American male around the age of 30, would waste his time, while living in India, trying to pursue an Indian woman who has made it clear that she can only date a man her parents choose for her to marry?  In America, that statement would send any man running (which would be understandable), but that is beside the point.  And why do they make the hot Australian woman so desperate for his attention, that the only way she wins him over is by offering sex?</p>
<p>What a waste of time.  I think I am going to stick to watching &#8220;The Office&#8221; on Thursday nights.  That is another politically correct sitcom in some ways, but at least most of the characters are white.</p>

<p>I would also like to say that the white men I see with Asians, hispanic, and black women are hardly a prize themselves.  Looks to me like they had to settle as well.</p>
<p>The best looking and most successful white men always end up with white women, at least most of the time.</p>

		<p>Opinions about beauty and aesthetics are just that:  OPINIONS, and very very subjective and sometimes become embraced as part of Groups Dynamics, Morphic Fields until they become almost a rule instead of a freedom of expression.</p>
<p>Everyone the right to express themselves per the US First Amendment and the self-determined pursuit of their own joy and bliss, and that includes aesthetic expressions.  </p>
<p>In a group if part of the game of aesthetics is voting and winning the vote then the winner WINS and that is the complementary way to play the game of aesthetics and beauty.  Complementary games,  not ridgey, compulsive, counter-postulating deadly serious games.</p>
<p>Keep it lighthearted and everyone wins.  I flow my admiration and love to Indian Women of all aesthetic types.  They are ALL beautiful in my eyes and heart.</p>

Dear Miss Courtney,</p>
<p>First let me express my respect and admiration for your spirited responses and it does sound like you are a worthy traditional White woman from the South who could be a good mother and who could make some White man a good wife and not make his every waking moment a living hell on earth like so many of these sexless, manless, terrible White women I see here in Chicago.</p>
<p>Courtney writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;When I get married I want to compliment my man and fill the role that I am supposed to fulfill to make him happy. I am willing to stay home to raise the kids while he is at work. When he comes home from work I want to look nice, have meals ready, and get him a beer while he watches TV. That is the kind of woman I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack replies:</p>
<p>That was very well said Courtney - music to my ears.</p>
<p>But again, this is still &#8220;talk&#8221; of things that could be done in the future, we need more action in the here and now.</p>
<p>Courtney writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;You want less talk and more action from me on this topic? &#8220;</p>
<p>Jack replies:</p>
<p>Yes. As Elvis Presley (a great Southern boy) once sang:</p>
<p>&#8220;A little less conversation, a little more action please<br>
All this aggravation aint satisfactioning me<br>
A little more bite and a little less bark<br>
A little less fight and a little more spark<br>
Close your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me<br>
Satisfy me baby&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack clarifies what Elvis is saying:</p>
<p>Courtney, we can&rsquo;t rely on some stork to deliver White children or have some scientists create test tube babies - we have to get our White men and White woman to connect in the here and now - not in some far off, future, imagined world.</p>
<p>And the reality here in Chicago is that very sexy East Asian women in their 20s are very interested in me in the male/female way, while I seem to have to go through all sorts of ridiculous nonsense to connect with White American women, and these are women in their late 40s.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in my mid 40s, healthy, yes now wealthy, have a great 3 bedroom place all paid off, I&rsquo;m pretty smart, qualified for MENSA, am a good athlete, a good partner dancer - I&rsquo;m 6&rsquo;1, blued eyed, good genes, looking to procreate and it seems like I am cursed with the curse of non fun, mentally messed up White American women!</p>

		<p>Archaeologists have found &#8220;caucasian&#8221; people with red hair, blond hair, their mummies in the Chinese desert. Does that mean that non asians lived there at one time? Sure. Genetecists say that 50,000 years ago the genetic defect which created slanted eyes happened, creating a &#8220;chinese or oriental asian&#8221; group. I know Goans who are very indian looking and have Portuguese names. The girl&rsquo;s father is Indian, she has indian blood in her, so come on now, who cares? We are all humans and to start saying that someone is not indian enough or black, or white, that&rsquo;s totally stupid. They found a man I believe in Kazakhstan that looked white to me but had epicanthic folds in his eyes, and when they asked him what he thought about the fact that he was the link to what happened 50,000 years ago, guess what he said - in Russian? I could care less, pass me the vodka. Well said.</p>

I say this perhaps in defiance, since many who I respect here would hesitate even in calling Afghans white. That&rsquo;s a mistake my friends  &mdash;  spend some time with Afghans and you will soon realize that they are just a poverty-sharpened version of ourselves.</p>
