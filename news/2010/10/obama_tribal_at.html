			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brian Montopoli, CBS News, October 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Asked about what the questioner saw as an increase in racial tension Thursday, President Obama said a &#8220;tribal attitude&#8221; can come as a result of economic hardship.</p>
<p>&#8220;Historically, when you look at how America has evolved, typically we make progress on race relations in fits and starts,&#8221; he said at a town hall event with young Americans.</p>
<p>He then suggested that the recession has played a part in driving racial antagonism while he has been in office.</p>
<p>&#8220;Often times misunderstandings and antagonisms surface most strongly when times are tough. And that&rsquo;s not surprising,&#8221; Mr. Obama said, arguing that Americans are less worried when things are going well.</p>
<p>He added that anxiety over not being able to pay bills  &mdash;  or having lost a job or a home  &mdash;  sometimes &#8220;organizes itself around kind of a tribal attitude, and issues of race become more prominent.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also said, however, that &#8220;I think the trend lines are actually good.&#8221;</p>

Obama is correct on one count, that when people are contented they are complacent. This is not &#8220;progress&#8221; on race relations. This is the unnatural temporary suspension of overt, aggressive, interracial competion for territorial survival.  </p>

		<p> When Obama and those of his ilk say, &#8220;improvement in race relations&#8221; or words to that effect, what they really mean is, blacks get more jobs through affirmative action (that should have gone to Whites), more blacks get enrolled in college through race-norming of test scores and lowered standards; and more black men get to hook up with White women.</p>
<p> And as to his dismissive comment about &#8220;tribes,&#8221; I say, &#8220;Hey, sometimes tribes are good.&#8221; They help people of like race and culture support each other against the &#8220;Other.&#8221; And yes, every group has one or more &#8220;Others.&#8221; It&rsquo;s not a peculiarity of European-Americans. Of course, the blacks call their tribe &#8220;racial solidarity&#8221; or &#8220;black pride.&#8221; But when we feel that way, they say it&rsquo;s &#8220;White racism.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I would venture to say that it is only whites who lack a sense of tribal identity.  Rome, both the Pagan and later, the Christian one killed it off in what has to be seen as a two stage cultural, and sometimes ethnic genocide.  The result was a Europe embroiled in civil wars almost continually until 1945.</p>

		<p>This guy is endlessly flapping his mouth.  He has every excuse in the book why he cannot do his job.  This guy never created a single job while holding office in IL or in Congress.  He cannot magically do so now.  This country never ceases to amaze.  Each generation always wants a magic guru.  Because of he and his gang has done, it will take generations for this country to climb out of the hole.  But will it be possible when the white population is ever decreasing?  </p>

		<p>Funny - Obama and his ilk never seem concerned when non-white trial attitudes come to the fore. Nay, they are encouraged at every turn. Seems only the white tribe is an issue. Wow, what a surprise. </p>
<p>Of course, had anyone read his books, they would know well how he really feels on this matter, and with which tribe he identifies.</p>

		<p>#1 above has it down pat.  The &#8220;unnatural temporary suspension&#8221; is soon to disappear as we head into the worst depression of all time.  Over the past decade all my investments have been gold related because I worried about debasement of the dollar, and I moved to the North Carolina mountains for safety because I saw what was coming on a social level. It&rsquo;s still coming. It&rsquo;s very close. I&rsquo;m called an extremist.</p>
<p>Imagine placing 100 dogs in a very large fenced in yard and leaving them by themselves for 30 days with no food.  When you return there will be a few dogs remaining out of the original 100 because those few ate the other dogs.  This is dog nature (all dogs are not equal) and unfortunately it&rsquo;s also human nature.  In a situation like this, the most vicious, the ones with lower moral standards, those who are violence prone will attack.</p>

		<p>Just as many urbanites see the error of their ways after electing black mayors, the U.S. has seen a black President, in less than two years, bring the nation to the brink of economic ruin and social chaos.  And of course we&rsquo;re tribal, which he has acknowledged in every anti-white word and gesture he&rsquo;s poked at us.  <br>
The GOP leadership must have realized, upon Obama&rsquo;s win, that the Dems might threaten to run a non-white in every subsequent election and win with a combined black/brown vote.  No wonder they stiffened their will to see him fail!  Now, all bets appear to be off as they dust off the old Southern Strategy and ponder replacing RNC chairman Michael Steele with Mississippi good ole&rsquo; boy Haley Barbour.  </p>

		<p>Whenever you hear a politician talking about progress reach for your earplugs and start humming aloud. Such talk invites comparison so let&rsquo;s start comparing. First, we need to assess the state of the union. How are things going? Cities are safe hubs of enterprise? Industry is thriving? Schools are turning out creative, well-behaved, educated young people? The citizenry are happy with the nation&rsquo;s direction and the performance of the government? The nation&rsquo;s accounting books are in the black? Family life is stable? Prisons are half-empty? </p>
<p>A comparison with the recent past might help. Look at what the leading democrats said in the debate over the 1965 immigration law change. Promises were made that current immigration problems would never be allowed. The language of the promises would be considered intolerant by today&rsquo;s standards. I&rsquo;m struck by two aspects of those promises. Politicians never felt obligated to live up to the promises. The promises were broken immediately and no effort was made to rectify the situation. I also want to ask what progress has been made since then which shows the promises were misguided. It seems no progress has been made but instead a regime of intimidation and indoctrination has become established to bully the population into accepting demographic change.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at what racial progress looks like in Europe. When racial progress began in the U.S., Europe was all-white. It was proposed that the American style of racial healing would be brought over to Europe which would bring in other races via mass immigration. How has that been working out? An objective assessment of the evidence can only conclude that the racial progress progam in Europe has been a failure.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Obama: &ldquo;Tribal Attitude&rdquo; Surfaces in Tough Times&#8221;</p>
<p>His statement is no more than an admittance that multiculturalism is a failure.  Anybody that&rsquo;s not a mind-numbed PC robot is aware that the country has been permanently divided into tribal factions these last several years.  </p>
<p>In building a society that is harmonious and will last through the tough times it&rsquo;s absolutely vital to assure that no factors are introduced that will create a natural division among the population. It&rsquo;s my opinion that many of those who parrot the politically correct line have some half-baked idea, based in childish wishful thinking, that if we continue to pretend that diversity is good for us eventually it will be.  That&rsquo;s why they get hysterical when anybody tells the truth about the weaknesses of their fantasies.  </p>
<p>The one important assertion the community organizer left out in his statement is that such a society is destined for breakup and very likely civil conflict the first time severely hard economic times occur.</p>
<p>It is this &#8220;attitude&#8221; he speaks of which will eventually set people against each other, especially since a large segment of the population is black.  They fight with everybody, mostly due to jealousy, because they can&rsquo;t compete with other races.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Obama: &ldquo;Tribal Attitude&rdquo; Surfaces in Tough Times&#8221;</p>
<p>After 25 years in Wright&rsquo;s anti-white hate-filled church, where kooky, hateful black racist theology, is the norm who would know better than the community organizer about the anti-white jealousy, resentment and hatred in the black community.  Oh, yes, we here at Amren are fully aware that there exists a &#8220;tribal attitude.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obama knows from being around hate-filled black people nearly all his life that they will let their &#8220;attitudes&#8221; rule their thinking, and it is those same attitudes that have been encouraged by Wright and MANY OTHER BLACKS to hate whitey for all the things they have not succeeded at due to their incomnpetence.  Obama is fully aware this black &#8220;attitude&#8221; is likely to erupt into riots and violence as the economy continues to decline.  He&rsquo;s preparng us for it.</p>
<p>In essence, he is also recognizing the failure of multiracialism, but I doubt he is aware of it.  A tribal society is doomed to break apart in large scale conflict once it reaches a point where the third world hordes feel as if the money spigot has been turned off.</p>
<p>Germany&rsquo;s Merkel is finally admitting it openly.  Quite frankly I never thought I&rsquo;d hear ANY European leader admit to the truth until the hordes were in full insurgency.</p>
<p>The below link is quite a sensational admission.</p>

Merkel says German multicultural society has failed&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Attempts to build a multicultural society in Germany have &#8220;utterly failed&#8221;, Chancellor Angela Merkel says.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a speech in Potsdam, she said the so-called &#8220;multikulti&#8221; concept - where people would &#8220;live side-by-side&#8221; happily - did not work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs Merkel&rsquo;s comments come amid recent outpourings of strong anti-immigrant feeling from mainstream politicians.&#8221;</p>
<p>(snip)</p>
<p>Expert forecast from the most accurate trends analyst in the world, Gerald Celente, (Trendsresearch.com) maintained at least one year ago that there would be a reversal in the desire for immigration in the Western world beginning at the time of his forecast.  Shortly after that Italy began moving blacks out of towns where the towns&rsquo; people were ready to kill them.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s right on once again.  The man&rsquo;s forecasts have been 100% accurate so far.  Amazing.</p>
<p>Who is going to be next to admit to the failure of multiculturalism?  Any guesses?</p>

		<p>3 Whiteplight: You claim that Rome, both Pagan and Christian killed off European tribalism, and as a consequence Europe has been waging civil war up until 1945?  Are you suggesting that there was a pan-European, White tribal consciousness before Julius Caesar conquered Gaul?  And are you also saying that the wars between France and Germany or between Russia and Germany, and many other European wars were not tribal in nature?  What were the unification of Germany and Italy about?  Or the re-establishment of Poland and the Baltic states in 1919, if not tribalism?  </p>

<p>&ldquo;Obama: &ldquo;Tribal Attitude&rdquo; Surfaces in Tough Times&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
Hey, the Magic Mulatto gets one right for a change! Yes, Hussein, whites ARE getting more tribal in their thinking. Thanks to your mau-mau administration I&rsquo;m now whiter than I&rsquo;ve ever been. The ongoing disaster of Obamunism has driven me to identify with a tribe   &mdash;   MY tribe, the WHITE tribe   &mdash;   to an extent that would have shocked and appalled my younger, more liberal self. </p>
<p>Whites detribalized long, long ago. And at the time, it was a good thing that we did; and an enormous step forward in our collective development as a race. Now, however, whites are learning that if our tribe must live and work and interact with millions upon millions of other, NON-white peoples who remain VERY tribal in their thinking   &mdash;   up to and including even the President of the United States!   &mdash;   then our detribalization puts us at a distinct disadvantage. </p>
<p>And if those non-white tribes aren&rsquo;t going to detribalize   &mdash;   and it&rsquo;s painfully plain that they have no plans to do so   &mdash;   then whites have no choice but to RE-tribalize, if only to avoid extinction. </p>

<p>Our governments immigration policies and long term recession are desiged to force a demographic shift in non-whites from the third world far into the interior regions of America where big government and its corporations will leverage massive urban sprawl with low cost housing units.<br>
Last May I took a trip to Pittsburgh, PA stopping at University Park where Penn State students were trying to start an annual Cinco de Mayo festival in anticipation of illegal immgration in light of the counties refusal to investigate local farmers hiring illegal aliens from Mexico.<br>
The tribal atititude of non-whites apparently extends to whites in Universities like PSU as secular humanism allows racial and demographic transformations easier for government to implement.<br>
If American&rsquo;s do not stand up to defend Americanism, local government lemmings will continue to act against the interests of the American people until we are displaced and met with non-white non-whte hate crimes that can only be stopped by insurrection.</p>

		<p>To ranger (re post # 6):</p>
<p>I too, saw Merkel&rsquo;s comments on the Internet, and I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. The Head of Europe&rsquo;s largest economy finally admitting multiculturalism is a failure. Had it been the head of Macedonia that uttered this, nobody would care. But, it was the head of the German government. More people listened. I think the next step should be for Germany to withdraw from the European Union. If it did so now, it would be spared the coming collapse.</p>
<p>As to your question of who&rsquo;s next, I think it will be Italy&rsquo;s Silvio Berlusconi (sp.) who will acknowledge the failure of multiculturalism. In the meantime, France and Britain will stupidly soldier on down the path they have chosen.</p>

		<p>Obama was happy to attend a black nationalist church for 19 years.  So he has no little direct understanding of tribalism. There is only one group of people in America for which tribalism is forbidden   &mdash;   white people.  For all other groups it is encouraged.</p>
