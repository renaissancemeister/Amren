			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>E.J. Tamara, WTOP-FM (Washington, D.C.), October 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Peruvians are miffed over a &#8220;Modern Family&#8221; episode in which a character suggests that the Andean nation is full of backward, violent people.</p>
<p>The offending dialogue comes during an argument between Jay, played by Ed O&rsquo;Neill, and his Colombian wife Gloria, played by Sofia Vergara.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, maybe in Colombia .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; Jay begins.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, here we go,&#8221; Gloria interrupts. &#8220;Because, in Colombia, we trip over goats and we kill people in the street. Do you know how offensive that is? Like we&rsquo;re Peruvians!&#8221;</p>
<p>Peruvian cyberspace lit up with criticism of ABC, which airs &#8220;Modern Family,&#8221; and Vergara, who brushed aside a torrent of insulting tweets. After one Twitter user asked her to clarify what happened with the script, the actress responded in Spanish: &#8220;Get a life!!!!!!&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s incredible that in a country where everything is politically correct, ABC would have a line of this sort,&#8221; said Milagros Lizarraga, founder of Peru USA Southern Ca, an online community that communicates through social media.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Peru, Beatriz Merino, head of the People&rsquo;s Defender&rsquo;s Office, said she wants an explanation and will try to talk to the U.S. ambassador about the episode.</p>
<p>&#8220;No country should have to be offended,&#8221; Merino told broadcaster Radioprogramas.</p>

I chuckled at the punch line: &#8220;Like we&rsquo;re Peruvians!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know enough about Peruvians to know what to make of it. Are Peruvians violent? Is this a real perception by Colombians?</p>
<p>The only reason I could see that this joke isn&rsquo;t funny to Peruvians is because it&rsquo;s true (in the same way you can&rsquo;t tell jokes about blacks that reflect their true nature).</p>
<p>The world gets more complicated every day.<br>

		<p>Actually Peruvians do have a reputation for violence in South America. An Argentine businessman I know well has told me in the past that there is a Peruvian crime wave in Buenos Aires (in addition to their home-grown) that the current leftist regime has deliberately done nothing about, according to him. Just like those two judges who said it about black incarceration it seems Modern Family has it right. So Peruvians are slighted. Who cares?</p>

		<p>Actually, that is very realistic dialogue. In my experience, so-called &#8220;Latinos&#8221; of varying national origin tend to despise, or look down upon one another without apology. This is particularly notable in those from places like Columbia, Argentina, etc., where larger populations of mostly(often entirely Caucasoid)peoples reside. </p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t believe there are people in South America watching such crass programming in the first place.  Even alot of Americans don&rsquo;t watch it anymore.  The scripts are bad, the acting is bad and it&rsquo;s choked full of diversity so much it isn&rsquo;t worth watching. It seems like they get the least attractive White actors/actresses to stand next to blacks and other nonwhites so as not to make them stick out so obviously.  I&rsquo;d say 80 percent of Whites on TV have black hair or dyed black hair for obvious reasons.  They must use a different kind of film these days or less lighting on the sets because the whole show is darker, colors stand out less compared to shows that were on in the 70s and 80s.  I suppose it&rsquo;s all part of the plan to make everyone look the same including giving the sets that greyish look.  </p>

All right then, let&rsquo;s just ban all humor and comedy altogether. No more making fun of anybody, anywhere, anytime, under any circumstances. In fact, no more <i>fun</i>, period. </p>

<p>At least people recognize this out there.</p>
<p>On a side note, poster #4 is right.  I am around LOTS of latinos all the time due to my current employment, and let me tell you, Mexicans hate dominicans and viceversa.  South Americans have intense class and racial rivalries studded by nationalism, etc&hellip;  All of them from Mexico on down hate Puerto Ricans.  They are the least loved of all by other latinos.  Still haven&rsquo;t figured out why.</p>

<p>Sounds like some twisted statement right out of an Orwell novel.</p>
<p>When I went to Mexico last summer (its worth going to, but whatever you do, don&rsquo;t drink the tap water or eat an entire &#8220;Tampequena&#8221;), we hired a driver to give us a tour of Acapulco.  We conversed with him for the hour or two we were in the tour van, and one of the things he told us was how he felt about Argentineans.  We had asked him if he got a lot of foreign customers, and he said something along the lines of &#8220;Yes, yes.  Japanesem English, Argentinean.  Lots of Argentineans.  I don&rsquo;t like them.  They are very mean people, very stuck-up.&#8221;  So, apparently Mexicans aren&rsquo;t fond of Argentineans.  I would think it may have to do with the fact that they tend to be white, but then again he said Americans are much better than Argentineans, and we also tend to be white, so that mustn&rsquo;t be it.</p>

		<p>#7, everyone hates Mexicans for their chauvinistic, racist views on everyone else.  No one can stand them.  I wouldn&rsquo;t lose sleep over a Mexican saying something about me since they are very opinionated based on their perpetual inferiority complex.  They hate us Argentineans because of our European heritage which they hate so much in us and in North Americans.  In fact, they will always tell a gullible American that Argentineans are Latin American &#8220;brothers&#8221; like them but don&rsquo;t realy mean it.  They will lump us in with them in order to degrade us and make people look equivalent to them because they know that people look down on them but that is their nature.  Ask any psychologist why people act out on their inferiority complex.</p>

		<p>I just did a GIS on &#8220;peruvians&#8221;. They are exactly as I suspected, and I feel as though I am missing NOTHING by never hearing from them again. </p>
<p>Needless to say, all the Peruvians in those photos are bound for the US border in spite of this alleged slight. </p>

<p>Well stated. One who doesn&rsquo;t have his head where the sun doesn&rsquo;t shine can see the changes. I just saw an American t.v. show recently and noticed the women were all latin-looking. One can&rsquo;t help but loudly wonder: where are the blondes? <br>

		<p>To poster #9, I know a lot of South Americans and they are generally as civilized as any white north americans.  Even some of the more Indian-like among them like some ecuadorians, peruvians, etc are way better mannered than other latinos.  It&rsquo;s the caribbean and mesoamericans who seem tough to handle for everyone.</p>

<p>If you were Argentinean, he would have been telling you that he dislikes Americans.</p>
<p>A Mexican in Mexico isn&rsquo;t likely to tell you to your face that he doesn&rsquo;t like whites (unless he can do it with some sly double-entendre). They&rsquo;re too polite for that.</p>

		<p>Why do people come to America just to hate it?  If I moved to China I wouldn&rsquo;t hate the Chinese, or to Mexico to hate Mexicans. Why do these people come here to hate this once great country?</p>
<p>Go back to the hell hole you crawled out of, get off our system of gratuities, and stop hating my country.  As one of the Hispanics said to his buddy at our golf course Sunday, &#8220;are you going to treat me like a white man today?&#8221;  What does that mean? As a white man what if I said, &#8220;are you going to treat me like a Mexican today?&#8221;  You know the rest&hellip;.</p>

Yes, that is absolutely true.  Mexico and Argentina are the two major countries of &#8220;Latin&#8221; America and there is a strong rivalry between them.  But, furthermore, Argentina is a white country, and the Mexicans don&rsquo;t like that one bit.  It&rsquo;s pure jealousy, basically.</p>

<p>Huh? Maybe if they are Latin men like Ricky Martin, Lorenzo Lamas or Antonio Banderas, who are 6 foot tall men of European ancestry.</p>

		<p>Mexicans are very racist. Despite the fact that they have resentment against Whites, they treasure lighter skin in their own society. The lighter-skinned Mexicans are held in higher esteem in Mexico than their dark-skinned counterparts though Mexicans are quick to scream that Americans are racist.</p>

		<p>What I despise most in Mexicans and other similar peoples who live in the USA like to lump certain other nationalities in with them when they are trying to lie to gullible American whites into thinking that every person who originates from Latin America is in solidarity with one another but they base their ideas on race so naturally Argentineans, Uruguayans, some Brazilians, and others would be their equals, but they don&rsquo;t consider anyone their equals in reality.  They only do it to get sympathy for potential lawsuits set up in this country to win money and support for potential political candidates who in return will not give them anything for their votes.  A lot of these Chicano activists don&rsquo;t seem to get that. They don&rsquo;t seem to have enough intelligence or education to know that.  Ask any educated person from Latin America and they will tell you exactly what I said.  </p>
<p>For the moment they will dominate in numbers since they breed like maggots but that will change when the economy starts affecting the upper middle class and even the rich when they have to start building walls around their communities like they do in South Africa. Don&rsquo;t believe what Mexicans or Central Americans or least of all Chicano ignoramuses say about equality.  They think THEY are superior and will say that an Argentinean is a &#8216;snob&rsquo;, &#8216;racist&rsquo;, &#8216;classist&rsquo; whatever.  Trust me when I say that this is their typical bait and switch.  It is designed only to get one over on you whitey.  That will change when the tables turn when this economy tanks.  Just give it time.</p>
