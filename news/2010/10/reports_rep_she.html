<h1><a href="https://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2612603/posts">Reports: Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee Broke Laws at Polling Place, Harassed Poll Watchers</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>"kristinn," Free Republic, October 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>There are two reports that Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX) violated electioneering laws inside a polling place and harassed poll watchers at the Acres Home Multiservice Community Center on October 18th.</p>
<p>Liberty Pundits has two eyewitness anonymous sources, a poll watcher and an election clerk, who describe Rep. Jackson Lee speaking with and shaking hands of voters inside a polling place located in the same building as her district office and getting in the faces of poll watchers</p>
<p>KPRC 950 host Michael Berry (@28:45) interviewed Houston poll watcher Catherine Engelbrecht of King Street Patriots/True The Vote on October 19th about what was relayed to her by poll watcher Marcia Ferguson.</p>
<p>Engelbrecht said that the poll watcher complained to the election judge that Jackson Lee was violating the law by campaigning inside the polling place by shaking hands with voters waiting in line to vote.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Liberty Pundits had a fuller account from their sources who asked for anonymity for their safety:<blockquote>So the source, a poll watcher, went into the room housing the voting booths and there stood Congresswoman Lee shaking hands with voters and greeting others  &mdash;  clearly electioneering. The poll watcher then went to one of the clerks and asked the presiding judge to take care of it.</p>
<p>While this occurred, the poll watcher heard Lee loudly say to the crowd in the voting area, &#8220;I&rsquo;ve heard a lot of complaints about voter intimidation by poll watchers. I am not going to allow voter intimidation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The poll watcher started writing the incident down.</p>
<p>Lee then went to the poll watcher and asked, &#8220;What&rsquo;s your name? Who do you represent?&#8221;</p>
<p>A poll watcher is not allowed to speak in the polling area, so directed Congresswoman Lee to the presiding judge. The poll watcher said that Congresswoman Lee indicated that she wanted names to report to the Department of Justice for voter intimidation.</p>
<p>The presiding judge asked Congresswoman Lee to leave.</p>
<p> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This account is backed up by another worker there, an election clerk, who also wished to remain anonymous for fear of retribution. He relayed concern for his safety.</p>
<p>{snip}<br>
</blockquote>There have been no reports in the media about this reported egregious violation of the law by by a U.S. Congresswoman.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t lie, I&rsquo;d be tempted to vote for a Sowell or Williams for president were one of them to run, especially if it were against yet another leftist-loon pinko &#8220;Democrat.&#8221;  These guys have a far better grasp of econ and the workings of our government than many Whites out there.</p>
<p>But I cannot stand such people as Castro-loving Marxist Sheila Jackson Lee who assume to be somehow important or noteworthy because they&rsquo;ve benefitted from gerrymandered districts designed to lump enough ignorant Africans together to effect elections, who would vote Adolf Hitler into office in perpetuity were he the correct shading.</p>
<p>If there were any justice in America she&rsquo;d go to jail for this and would share a cell with police-assaulting Cynthia McKinney and &#8220;Freezer&#8221; William Jefferson, two other impersonators of serious people.</p>

		<p>This is the one who thought the Apollo astronauts landed on Mars, who said it was racist that hurricanes weren&rsquo;t given black names, who was banned from Continental Airlines due to her constant in-flight misbehavior. Only with the combination of gerrymandering and Bantus-in-our-midst could such a sorry excuse for a human being ever get elected to office.</p>
<p>I must say, however, that her hurricane idea isn&rsquo;t too bad. Giving a black name to something violent and destructive would be quite fitting.</p>

		<p>This is a direct consequence of the failure to prosecute the New Black Panthers for their outrageous conduct at the polling place.  Blacks know that they can conduct themselves in any outrageous fashion they wish and remain free from any consequence.</p>

Black daily life is non stop bullying and attempts<br>

<p>Youve got to be kidding me. </p>
<p>Id vote for them too. To stay right where they are and out of the White House. I dont want these people to check my mail for me&hellip;..much less ruling me.</p>
<p>They need their own place/space away from us Evil and Oppressive White Devils. That way they can &#8216;prosper&rsquo; and &#8216;flourish&rsquo; together&hellip;.without (RACISM!!!) and discrimination from (RACISTS!!!) &#8216;holding them back&rsquo; from their god-like destiny.</p>

<p>Because of their inability to understand this simple truth, and because of their absolute adherence to tribalism, blacks<br>
do not deserve the right to vote in America.<br>

<p>And Jackson Lee outdid herself when she showed up to speak at Michael Jackson&rsquo;s memorial service. In her speech, she held up a framed copy of her congressional resolution honoring Jackson as a &#8220;Global Humanitarian.&#8221;</p>
<p>When she got back from her L.A. trip, Jackson Lee introduced HR 600 &#8220;Honoring an American Legend and Musical Icon&#8221; in the House Foreign Affairs Committee.</p>

		<p><i>There are two reports that Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX) violated electioneering laws inside a polling place and harassed poll watchers.</i></p>
<p>Jackson Lee is black so the law doesn&rsquo;t apply, ask AG Holder.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really disgusting that mindless blacks, with just enough intelligence to remove a government check from a mailbox, continue to vote in jackson lee, mckinney, rangel and watson  &mdash;    while being ethnically cleansed from their &#8216;historic&rsquo; areas by violent hispanics.</p>
<p>Blacks continue to believe and support politicians that tell them their greatest enemy is The Great White Bigot; black politicians arrogance and corruption seen as Putting One Over On The Man.</p>
<p>Meanwhile&hellip;</p>
<p>According to NumberUSA&rsquo;s immigration-reduction report card:</p>
<p>Jackson Lee:  F-</p>
<p>Rangel:  F-</p>
<p>Watson:  F</p>
<p>McKinney:  F</p>
<p>We continue to laugh at and mock these politicians, but they are untouchable. </p>
<p>And they know it.</p>
<p>But I can&rsquo;t resist adding one more jackson lee story to this thread from Discover the Network:</p>
<p><i> [Jackson-Lee] was accustomed to having an aide drive her daily, in a government-leased car, back and forth between her Capitol Hill apartment and her congressional office one block away. One day she told a staffer who had failed to reserve a limousine: &#8216;You don&rsquo;t understand. I am a queen, and I demand to be treated like a queen!&rsquo; </i></p>

		<p>Bon #10, very well written post. Although, Cynthia McKinney was finally and soundly defeated in her last bid for Congress by her virtually all black district. She was beaten by none other than Obama-endorsed Hank Johnson, who is famously of the belief that placing troops on Guam will cause the island to tip over. However, it is an monumental improvment. Johnson is simply dimwitted, whereas McKinney was racist, dishonest, malicious, foul-mouthed and violent.</p>
<p>After losing the election, Ms. McKinney moved to the San Francisco area of California (lucky you) to establish residency, enroll in a PhD program at UC Berkeley, switch to the Green Party and run for President. (Please forgive any typos - it&rsquo;s hard for me to type that between hysterical laughter.)</p>

		<p>Lee is typical, elected from a black district of low IQ quota blacks&hellip;look at all of the elected blacks how many aren&rsquo;t from such a district?</p>
<p>Qualifed? Only to inflict harm on America and to assume preferential treatment, because they are empowered by stupidity. By stupidity I mean the people who elected them and the people who tolerate them.</p>
<p>Read the statistics, without government jobs the unemployment rate among blacks would be astonomical.  In chicage alone the blacks represent 70% of postal workers (think some white person might have been passed over due to race?).  </p>
<p>Get real, get it straight, and take some positive action.</p>

		<p> Dear old Sheila. The woman just gives us someone to laugh at down here. She&rsquo;s an idiot but is absoulutely unfireable in her district. I feel that gentle ridicule and asking her embarassing questions at press conferences just to get a rise out of her is all she&rsquo;s good for.<br>
 She does give the hard core racists someone to stereotype though.</p>
