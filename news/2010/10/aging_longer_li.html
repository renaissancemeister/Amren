<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/19/health/research/19aging.html?_r=1">Aging: Longer Life Expectancy Seen for Hispanics</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Roni Caryn Rabin, New York Times, October 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Scientists call it the &#8220;Hispanic paradox&#8221;: despite high rates of poverty and relatively low rates of health insurance, Hispanics in the United States tend to outlive African-Americans and non-Hispanic whites.</p>
<p>A government report {snip} found that as of 2006, the life expectancy for Hispanics at birth was 80.6 years, 2.5 years more than for non-Hispanic whites and almost 8 years longer than for blacks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So what accounts for the paradox? The report&rsquo;s author, Elizabeth Arias of the National Center for Health Statistics, speculated that the longer life expectancy might have to do with cultural factors, including close social and family networks and low rates of smoking.</p>

<p>This may be false.  The death rate among Hispanics in motor vehicles accidents is higher than any other group.  This tends to bring the life expectancy down somewhat.  I&rsquo;d be surprised to hear that their life expectancy is longer than ours now, although considering the damage to White society with crime, drugs, stress, dumbing-down, etc. it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if they did eventually pass our life expectancy.</p>

		<p>I have a different theory. When people choose to immigrate/invade another country those people would normally be the stronger ones and not the weak and sickly. You don&rsquo;t see many of them rolling across the border in wheel chairs or on crutches do you. The weak and the sick stay home and those that are strong enough for a long trip and hard labor make the journey. </p>

		<p>I thought that blacks were supposed to have &#8220;close social and family networks&#8221; too. Also, I thought that their rate of smoking (of cigarettes, at least) was supposed to be lower than that of whites. So what gives? Oh yeah, &#8220;racism&#8221; makes them unhappy. But don&rsquo;t Hispanics face racism too? Ah, such a mystery.</p>

		<p>Who comes up with all these so-called studies??  I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it. Hispanics have a high rate of obesity, diabetes, drug use, alcoholism/drug use. Happy families?  How so? You mean their drug cartel infested, unwed mother, families?  Living off the White taxpayers for all their free health care and subsidies?  Maybe White families would be happier if we were not surrounded with these minorities all around us and sucking up our tax dollars.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s not a bad theory, Daniel, but I would be surprised if that were enough to prove decisive; the sickly are a small percentage and those same immigrants led pretty unhealthy lives. </p>

Well, there goes the idea that more immigrants are going to save social security. Hispanics themselves are now going to overwhelm the system.</p>

		<p>Hmm. Don&rsquo;t know what is going on here, but social &#8220;scientists&#8221; socioligists, political &#8220;sceintists&#8221;, have very little understanding of the actual scientific method, and very little clue how to actually conduct serious research.</p>
<p>I live in a very ghetto Mexican/central american area of Brooklyn but the Hispanic female population looks pretty unhealthy. Short, fat, way too many children, lots of public alchohol consumption, way to much McDonalds and Burger king gorging  &mdash;  causing I assume astronomical diabetes rates.</p>
<p>I have a very hard time believing any of them actually make it anywhere north of 60 let alone 80.</p>
<p>My guess is that there is some kind of statical flaw, perhaps young children who die in childbirth or shortly thereafter drag the black and white life expectancy aveages down as most latinos sneak into this country in their 20s or 30s. </p>
<p>Perhaps the sample size was too small and only included grandmothers of people who got green cards and imported their elderly relatives and whatnot.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason I find it pretty hard to asume most hispanics have such fantatistic moral fortitute that they live so long due to their virtuous lifestyles.</p>

		<p>Strong families and a general collectivist mentality lead to a proud culture That individuals are happy to be a part of. Contrast that with belonging to a masochistic cultureless mass of individualistic individuals. Who can be happy being a part of that?  </p>

<p>Yeah, well, I&rsquo;d be real happy, too, if I escaped poverty to a new country that rewarded me with every possible thing I could want, subsidized my life with freebies, burdened me with no responsibilities, and raised, educated and fed my children for free. Yep, a free ticket to the good life would make me really happy, too. Instead, I&rsquo;m the one having to finance THEIR good life.</p>

<p>Daniel:</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think the weak and sickly aren&rsquo;t coming across the border, they are, in droves, most likely on visas that are ripped up upon arrival.  </p>
<p>I know this because I see them in the schools, and clinics and hospitals their relatives openly bragging in the LA Times that they brought the child here specifically to seek medical help  &mdash;  without a clue that these services are not &#8216;free&rsquo; (the LA Times acting clueless as well, ever refusing to do an expose as to what it costs us California taxpayers to educate and medicate foreign nationals, claiming &#8216;the economy depends on these immigrants!&rsquo;).</p>
<p>The schools is compelled to enroll these students as district policy clearly states (and we teachers are constantly reminded) to &#8216;take all commers&rsquo; No Questions Asked.</p>
<p>Once enrolled, these immigrant children receive benefits you can only dream about for your own White Child, benefits you pay for, of course  &mdash;  special adapted buses to ferry the kid round-trip doorstep to school each day, full-time nurses, extremely small &#8216;class&rsquo; size, special, expensive medically-trained aides and school psychologists.  </p>
<p>The costs are unimaginable.</p>
<p>Complaints from Native Born White Taxpayers?  You are a Heartless, Evil Nazi, according to the LA Times. Pay-up, you worthless Kulak!  Foreign Nationals are depending on you to finance their medical care, education (and housing, and food, and&hellip;.).</p>
<p>And the LA Times wonders why productive Whites are fleeing in droves to friendlier terrain, the politicians (Moonbeam and Nutmeg especially) completely mum about the costs of illegal immigration).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for the children, of course children &#8216;of color&rsquo;, that is, never for your White Child because (according to the LA Times) you White Child was born into a life of privilege, not one of White Oppression.</p>

		<p>  I&rsquo;ve known a lot of white Cuban-Americans who lived to an advanced old age. I suspect that these people and other white &#8220;Spanish&#8221; Hispanics have skewed the results of this survey. I can&rsquo;t see everyday Mestisos being among the long-lived groups. Their health habits, as &#8220;aj&#8221; remarked, are normally abominable.</p>

		<p>Wikipedia: &#8220;&hellip;life expectancy generally quoted is the at birth number which is an average that includes all the babies that die before their first year of life as well people that die from disease and war.&#8221;  Blacks have higher infant morality as well as higher death rates in teen through early adulthood. Whereas many US Hispanics come over here when they are ambulatory enough to jump a wall and cross the desert.  Hispanics are far less likely to kill each other than Blacks.  Adverse selection.</p>
