<h1><a href="http://www.wtop.com/?sid=2090592&amp;nid=213">Portland, Maine, Weighs Letting Noncitizens Vote</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Clarke Canfield, WTOP-FM (Washington, D.C.), October 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Portland residents will vote Nov. 2 on a proposal to give legal residents who are not U.S. citizens the right to vote in local elections, joining places like San Francisco and Chicago that have already loosened the rules or are considering it.</p>
<p>Noncitizens hold down jobs, pay taxes, own businesses, volunteer in the community and serve in the military, and it&rsquo;s only fair they be allowed to vote, Rwaganje said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have immigrants who are playing key roles in different issues of this country, but they don&rsquo;t get the right to vote,&#8221; said Rwaganje, 40, who moved to the U.S. because of political strife in his native Congo and runs a nonprofit that offers financial advice to immigrants.</p>
<p>Opponents of the measure say immigrants already have an avenue to cast ballots  &mdash;  by becoming citizens. Allowing noncitizens to vote dilutes the meaning of citizenship, they say, adding that it could lead to fraud and unfairly sway elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;My primary objection is I don&rsquo;t think it is right, I don&rsquo;t think it is just, I don&rsquo;t think it is fair,&#8221; Portland resident Barbara Campbell Harvey said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Maine ballot questions asks whether legal immigrants who are city residents but not U.S. citizens should be allowed to vote in municipal elections. If the measure passes, noncitizens would be able to cast ballots in school board, city council and school budget elections, as well as other local issues, but not on federal or statewide matters.</p>
<p>The Maine League of Young Voters, which spearheaded the drive to force the question on the ballot, estimates there are 5,000 to 7,500 immigrants in Portland, roughly half of whom are not U.S. citizens. They come from more than 100 countries, with the two largest groups from Somalia and Latin America.</p>
<p>On a recent day in a small lunchroom at the Al-Amin Halal Market, a group of Somali men ate lunch and talked in their native language. A sign advertised the day&rsquo;s offerings, including hilib ari (goat), bariis (rice) and baasto (spaghetti).</p>
<p>Abdirizak Daud, 40, moved to Minneapolis 18 years ago before coming to Portland in 2006. He hasn&rsquo;t been able to find a job. Some of his nine children have attended Portland schools, and he&rsquo;d like to have a say in who&rsquo;s looking over the school system and the city, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I like the Democrats. I want to vote for Democrats, but I don&rsquo;t have citizenship,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>What is the point of citizenship anymore? We used to encourage people to gain citizenship because of the benefits one got. You got to vote, you got more say, and finally, you were American, but now? No. Citizenship is nothing. In the eyes of the government and utopians your American child has as much rights (if not less) than the illegal alien or immigrant. </p>
<p>No one will seek citizenship if there is no prize. The federal government should stop all voting of non-citizens. </p>
<p>What is our country now? We don&rsquo;t have borders, value in citizenship, heck, there isn&rsquo;t even an idea of what American is anymore. Our nation is dying. </p>
<p><br>
I have no loyalty to this government, and I have no loyalty to this country, simply because, this isn&rsquo;t a country anymore. My loyalty lies in Euro-America, which is dying and depends on Euro-Americans to continue. <br>

		<p>well, that&rsquo;s a great idea&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>
and since we can do that, letting anyone vote, why just one vote?<br>
let everyone vote as many times as they want to.<br>

		<p>Why not have all the people of the Congo vote in USA elections?  And for that matter all the people of Mexico too.  After all, according the the multiculturalists, we are all the same and borders are just artificial lines drawn in the dirt.</p>
<p>It is hateful to prevent the disadvantaged from having a place at the table.  Why even have countries?  </p>

		<p>The whole point of citizenship is vanishing. The melting pot has been swiped. The traditional and nationalist right needs a counter-offense to the dilution of citizenship.Not only should illegals be promptly deported, if we have to bring back every soldier overseas to do it, but green cards have to be slashed if they can&rsquo;t be totally eliminated. &#8220;Temporary&#8221; visas, student or work, must be reserved only for the exceptional(example, Einstein and the German scientists who came to the US in the &#8216;30&rsquo;s). Computer jockeys, taxi cab drivers, and warm bodies for our greedy community and four yr colleges are not essential to anyone but to the bureaucrats in education institutions trying to expand budgets. When the McCains and Chamber of Commerce, Gates and Soros, and the defense industry wails where will we get qualified people, we reply, &#8221; from US citizens or from nowhere. And if our standard of living goes down, if it does, so what&#8221;. You know, we can train our kids to return to the land. Believe it or not, most people once were farmers. And Americans had common sense and knew right from wrong.</p>

<p>And the &ldquo;key roles&rdquo; in this country being nonprofits, &ldquo;that offer financial advice to immigrants?&rdquo; I think not!</p>
<p>What do I get out of that Comrade Rwaganje, aside from the depth and circumference of the shaft? </p>
<p>The answer is nothing, as is so eloquently demonstrated by the words of the invader Comrade Daud who whines: &ldquo;I like the Democrats. I want to vote for Democrats, but I don&rsquo;t have citizenship.&rdquo; And he should never get it, for that very reason; we are not a handout country for Third World hand-to-mouth entitlement zombies and the political witchdoctors that foster them. We are a country, or at least attempt to remain a country, that fosters rugged individualism and meritocracy.</p>
<p>That is why the USA is not the Congo yet, and hopefully never will be!</p>

<p>After being in the United States for 18 years, why hasn&rsquo;t he either become a naturalized citizen or gone back to his homeland?<br>
In any event, if this country starts letting non-citizens vote, why even bother continuing the charade that it is any sort of sovereign country any more?</p>

		<p>No, non-citizens shouldn&rsquo;t have the right to vote. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if they work or pay taxes. They chose to come here, nobody forced or asked them too. Unless they become citizens, they are still to be considered temporary residents and as non-citizens who should not be allowed to intervene in our nation&rsquo;s politics.</p>

		<p>It would be beyond stupid letting non-citizens vote in our elections. So what if they hold jobs and pay taxes - it doesn&rsquo;t mean we should give them access to our ballot boxes.</p>
<p>These stupid &#8220;Young Voters&#8221; haven&rsquo;t thought things through. If non-citizens were allowed to vote in our elections, can you imagine the stampede of aliens from all corners of the globe flooding their way into this country? I don&rsquo;t even know why Maine, of all places, would even consider putting this question on the ballot.</p>

What should the time limit be to be eligible? Could an illegal come in a week prior to an election and make a few purchases to pay taxes to the state or local government and then be given a provisional ballot on election day?</p>
<p>Democracy is a doomed political system. The only question is how long it&rsquo;s going to take before it does away with all standards and self-destructs.</p>

		<p>Years ago while in Portland on vacation I remember seeing an astonishing sight while entering a diner for breakfast. In front of the diner was a bicycle rack with dozens of bicycles and not a single one of them had a lock on it. For someone who lived in a city blessed with the benefits of multiculturalism this was unthinkable as they would have been stolen in no time in my home town. They won&rsquo;t realize how good they had it till they don&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>The whole concept of &#8216;citizenship&rsquo; - and the rights and duties attending to it are exceedingly ancient going back to Greek and Roman times.<br>
 Basically, the idea is that, in a Republic, the attributes of worthiness and dignity are conferred upon those who actually had a stake in building and maintaining the polity.<br>
  Clearly an alien who neither helped to build or uphold the polity and whose ancestors likewise failed to do so, cannot in all fairness be called a &#8216;citizen&rsquo;.That is why all nations worthy of the name have elaborate &#8216;naturalization&rsquo; procedures to confer this status.<br>

		<p>Mr.Daud(from Somalia?) is a symbol of why anchor babies(and grown children of illegals) should not be citizens. Daud may have been granted refugee status if from Somalia. The US as usual could have stayed out Somalia&rsquo;s civil wars, or simply exterminated from the air the Islamist rebel population areas, but didn&rsquo;t. We&rsquo;re for human rights, of course, except for our own troops.</p>
<p>But Mr. Prolific Daud produces nine, nine, kids in the US, doesn&rsquo;t work after 20 years to assimilate, moves to a seaside city in Maine(which has become a liberal Boston-NYC influenced haven for extravagant second homes and college Boston grads looking for a low-cost version of Massachusetts). </p>
<p>Daud wants the vote and I&rsquo;m sure lots of &#8220;free&#8221; money from the white rulers. What exactly about US colonial and Revolutionary tradition does Mr. Daud know that impels his urge to vote? Limited government or &#8220;free&#8221; housing, education for his kids in public colleges, and a nice cushy state or federal job? You know, all those entitlements spelled out in the 1787 Constitution Mr. Daud reads till its threadbare. </p>

		<p>From the original story:</p>
<p>
<p>But between his limited English and the financial demands, Daud hasn&rsquo;t been able to become a citizen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like the Democrats. I want to vote for Democrats, but I don&rsquo;t have citizenship,&#8221; he said.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p><br>
What should be noted from this story: 18 years here and no job.(Anyone willing to say how he and family are managing to survive?)  Nine children. (Anyone fed up with supporting nine more dependents? Limited English. (In 18 years??? Yet he&rsquo;s managed to have his entire life supported by us for those 18 years. I think we see the root of the reason why he is not/should not be a citizen.) </p>
<p>And Maine is wanting these cretins to have control in their cities&rsquo; governments.</p>
<p>Added note: Many of these Africans now residing in Maine were originally located in Clarkston, GA. While there, apartments were cntinually burned down, with the repeated causes being determined to be cooking over open fires on the floors. Word spread among the Africans in Clarkston that Portland, Maine had a welcoming program offering insane benefits to African immigrants. Husbands in Clarkston fled to Portland and other Maine cities to establish residency to sign up for the much more lucrative benefits, and sent for their families as quickly as they were accepted in the system.</p>
<p>Odd, about that time the number of fire calls in Clarkston, GA dropped dramatically.</p></p>

		<p>Citizenship is the threshold for voting, not the payment of taxes.  I pay sales tax in the adjacent state, should I have voting rights because I paid sales tax there?  Nearly 50% of families don&rsquo;t pay Federal income tax, should they be denied the right to vote?   By extension, a person who is a citizen in another country pays a tax in the US, should they vote?  This is more akin to buying the right to vote.  Citizenship is the issue.  Become a citizen and certain rights come with that.</p>

<p>actually, it would make more sense to allow educated 10 year olds with average or above IQs to vote than people who just stepped out of the stone age - and are now wards of the state in the US. </p>
<p>why would we allow someone to vote who is </p>
<p>a) an alien</p>
<p>b) a non tax payer</p>
<p>c) illiterate</p>
<p>d) w/ an IQ below 80??</p>
<p><br>
the guy who has never had a job but has 9 kids in public school &#8220;wants to have a say about how the schools are run.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to have a say about whether he is allowed to be in my country, to have 9 kids supported by the taypayer.  </p>

		<p>I think all non-citizens, including illegal aliens, should get two votes per individual to offset the unfair circumstances into which they were borne, through no fault of theirs.  </p>
<p>They should also get to exercise shop-lifting privileges of up to $500/week, occupy private homes of their choosing, be eligible for food stamps and proposed gas stamps, clothing stamps, and car stamps programs.</p>
<p>Only through recognition of these rights can non-citizens enjoy and live the American dream.</p>

<p>Possibly, I think many would love to deny America her identity, and I think they would love even more to destroy our Western identity but unfortunately for them, places like Amren exist and at least some Europeans aren&rsquo;t willing to give up what makes them European. </p>
<p>It is racist that European Americans have such a rich and strong heritage and African Americans don&rsquo;t. How unfair of us.</p>
