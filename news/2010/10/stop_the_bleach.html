			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dr. Benjamin F. Chavis, Jr., Washington Informer, October 17, 2010 </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Will the jubilance of the election of the first African American President of the United States, two years ago, give way this year to the forces of bigotry and reactionary politics? Will the majority of all Americans be too quick to forget the shameful and disastrous economic condition that President George W. Bush left the country in when he departed the White House in January 2009?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One the leading national research bodies, the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies in Washington, D.C., just released a study on the power of the Black vote in America in advance of the fast approaching mid-term elections. Dr. David A. Bositis led the study for the Joint Center. He concluded that if there will be a strong turnout of the African American vote, the results of who will be in control of the U.S. Senate and House, as well as 14 different state governorships will be determined.</p>
<p>Millions of dollars, however, are now being spent to confuse African American voters. One such deceptive ploy is going on once again in the state of Florida with the so-called &#8220;Fair Districts&#8221; Constitutional Amendments 5 and 6 that will re-determine how voting districts are to be drawn across that state. There are similar measures on the ballot is the state of California.</p>
<p>These proposals are unfair and will lead to the &#8220;bleaching&#8221; of voting districts in those states and later in all states. Of course, this will be a undermining disaster to the Voting Rights Act. The proposed &#8220;whitening&#8221; of voting districts has a lot of Black people confused and we when we are confused, it can cause a low voter turnout.</p>
<p>In Florida, more than four million dollars has already been spent to promote the &#8220;bleaching&#8221; of Black and Latino voting districts. Some of my colleagues in the Civil Rights Movement have been unfortunately sucked into supporting these latest tactics of voter suppression and disempowerment of black political interests and progress.</p>
<p>I stand firmly with Congresswoman Corrine Brown, Congressman John Lewis, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, Congressman James Clyburn, and many other members of the Congressional Black Caucus who have publicly spoken out against these regressive and backward ballot initiatives that are designed to undermine and replace the Voting Rights Act with State&rsquo;s Rights Constitutional Amendments.</p>

		<p>&#8220;If districts with black or Hispanic majorities are redrawn, whites will get elected!&#8221;</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t one single black in Congress I can recall at the moment who is qualified to be there, nor are there any black lawmakers who do not first and foremost concern themselves with black only cause, even outside this country.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the least intelligent, most bigotted people in this country today&hellip;.bar none.</p>

		<p>&#8220;when we are confused, it can cause a low voter turnout.&#8221;  Well I say bring on the confusion!  Drawing compact voting districts that incorporate exisitng political boundries sounds sensible to me although I  think that creating safe districts for whites is a good thing.  Can&rsquo;t we find another way to confuse blacks?</p>

		<p>It didnt explain exactly what the &#8220;bleaching of black and Hispanic voting districts&#8221; means.  How are the voting districts being re-drawn, and how will this change the amount of political power minorities will have?  Of course I do hope he&rsquo;s right about thuis, which is why I&rsquo;m dissapointed he ddin;t elaborate.</p>

		<p>I am almost 57 years old, yet I find myself astounded time after time. I guess I just haven&rsquo;t seen, heard, or read it all yet.</p>
<p>Here we have a black leader. He states that black voters are confused. Well, I&rsquo;m a white voter. And if I&rsquo;m confused, I do some reading, ask some questions, and become less confused - at least I hope so.</p>
<p>But apparently it doesn&rsquo;t occur to blacks to do what I do, and what every white person I know does. Instead, we read this:&#8221;&hellip;when we are confused,it can cause a low voter turnout.&#8221;</p>
<p>Am I the only one who has read this who is struck by the insanity of the remark? Or is it, finally, an admission by a black leader that blacks are inferior to whites?</p>
<p>If blacks were not so violent and didn&rsquo;t cost so much to support, they would be really entertaining.</p>

<p>Interesting thing about this election is that the various identity groups that make up the unholy alliance that is the democratic party, are not willing to work together anymore.</p>
<p>Blacks recently forced some extreme loser to be a candidate over a well qualified white, because he was black.  He obviously can&rsquo;t win but that didn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Now mestizos are making it known that they will no longer vote democrat because they haven&rsquo;t passed amnesty.</p>
<p>I think the democrats are in for a surprise in a couple of weeks.  Of course, they are going to lose big.  But I think they aren&rsquo;t prepared for just how big.</p>

		<p>America is like the show The Biggest Loser. All across the country districts have been gerrymanded, redrawn, and juryrigged so as to maximize the minority vote and get non-whites into office. And yet the COVERAGE of this turns into, instead, another article about how things are unfair, to non-whites.</p>

<p>This is what I expect from a left wing black man.  The economic mess was caused by actions of both parties over many years.  George W. Bush was a disaster, but so is Obama.</p>
<p>Note that anybody who complained about the blackening of white districts would be labeled a racist.  But blacks must have their segregated districts all to their own.</p>

		<p>This article is actually funny as hell.  I recently moved to Florida  &mdash;  moved too late to vote, unfortunately  &mdash;  and I&rsquo;m seeing ads about these propositions on television quite a few times per day.  What amuses me the most is that the NAACP apparently supports these amendments  &mdash;  at least they are shown in the ads as being supportive.  Legal gerrymandering, at least in the post Civil Rights era, was not only an attempt to make sure that minorie i.e. black candidates would be elected, but to deliberately dilute the white vote in non black majority districts.  If district lines were drawn logically, then blacks would not have to worry about &#8220;fairy&#8221; representation  &mdash;  since racial and ethnic groups tend to self-segregate, a black district would have no problem electing black representatives.  However  &mdash;  without gerrymandering, white districts will do the same, and I imagine that&rsquo;s where the libs are concerned.</p>

		<p>What is all this &#8220;bleaching&#8221; hate speech?  This guy should be publicly denounced as a racist both for comparing European-Americans to &#8220;bleach&#8221;, and whining about &#8220;whitening&#8221; of districts.  As usual, a media double-standard seems to apply here.</p>

		<p>If Ben Chavis fears that black Floridians will be confused by ballot amendments, he should get someone to write a column for him that is at least not confusing itself!  But, like many black writers, he produces a piece that has to be read and reread before comprehension is even possible.  <br>
If it weren&rsquo;t for racial gerrymandering, few black legislators would be elected to Congress.  After the election of Obama and his subsequent anti-white words and actions, is it any wonder that whites feel that they have to act against black power in any form?  </p>

		<p>Black votes would put Democrats over the top in many districts that are majority white.  How many races are lost by 1 or 2 or 5%?  Let them have their districts. </p>

		<p>Actually, the &#8220;bleaching&#8221; occurs when minorities have their own gerrymandered districts.  This ghettoizes them (or barrioizes them) into their own little playgrounds, where they can&rsquo;t affect the outcomes of races in the &#8220;bleached&#8221; districts.</p>
