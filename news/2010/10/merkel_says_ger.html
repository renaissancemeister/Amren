<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Attempts to build a multicultural society in Germany have &#8220;utterly failed&#8221;, Chancellor Angela Merkel says.</p>
<p>She said the so-called &#8220;multikulti&#8221; concept  &mdash;  where people would &#8220;live side-by-side&#8221; happily  &mdash;  did not work, and immigrants needed to do more to integrate  &mdash;  including learning German.</p>
<p>The comments come amid rising anti-immigration feeling in Germany.</p>
<p>A recent survey suggested more than 30% of people believed the country was &#8220;overrun by foreigners&#8221;.</p>
<p>The study  &mdash;  by the Friedrich Ebert Foundation think-tank  &mdash;  also showed that roughly the same number thought that some 16 million of Germany&rsquo;s immigrants or people with foreign origins had come to the country for its social benefits.</p>
<p><b>Foreign workers</b></p>
<p>Mrs Merkel told a gathering of younger members of her conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party on Saturday that at &#8220;the beginning of the 60s our country called the foreign workers to come to Germany and now they live in our country.&#8221;</p>
<p>She added: &#8220;We kidded ourselves a while, we said: &#8216;They won&rsquo;t stay, sometime they will be gone&rsquo;, but this isn&rsquo;t reality.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And of course, the approach [to build] a multicultural [society] and to live side-by-side and to enjoy each other .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. has failed, utterly failed.&#8221;</p>
<p>In her speech in Potsdam, however, the chancellor made clear that immigrants were welcome in Germany.</p>
<p>She specifically referred to recent comments by German President Christian Wulff who said that Islam was &#8220;part of Germany&#8221;, like Christianity and Judaism.</p>
<p>Mrs Merkel said: &#8220;We should not be a country either which gives the impression to the outside world that those who don&rsquo;t speak German immediately or who were not raised speaking German are not welcome here.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Mounting debate</b></p>
<p>There has been intense debate about multiculturalism in Germany in recent months.</p>
<p>Correspondents say Mrs Merkel faces pressure from within her CDU and its allies to take a tougher stance and require immigrants to do more to adapt to German society.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Horst Seehofer, the leader of the CDU&rsquo;s Bavarian sister party, the CSU, said it was &#8220;obvious that immigrants from different cultures like Turkey and Arab countries, all in all, find it harder&#8221; to integrate.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Multikulti&rsquo; is dead,&#8221; Mr Seehofer said.</p>
<p>Earlier this month the chancellor held talks with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in which the two leaders pledged to do more to improve the often poor integration record of Germany&rsquo;s estimated 2.5 million-strong Turkish community.</p>
<p>The debate first heated up in August when Thilo Sarrazin, a senior official at Germany&rsquo;s central bank, said that &#8220;no immigrant group other than Muslims is so strongly connected with claims on the welfare state and crime&#8221;. Mr Sarrazin has since resigned.</p>
<p>Such recent strong anti-immigration feelings from mainstream politicians come amid an anger in Germany about high unemployment, even if the economy is growing faster than those of its rivals, our correspondent says.</p>
<p>He adds that there also seems to be a new strident tone in the country, perhaps leading to less reticence about no-go-areas of the past.<br/>

								<h2>Merkel Negative on Multiculturalism: Vanishing American Negative on Merkel</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Patrick Cleburne, VDARE.com, October 17, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p><cite>The Drudge Report,</cite> that highly sensitive weather-vane for what interests Americans  &mdash;  as opposed to what the <em>MSM</em> wants them interested in  &mdash;  has seen fit today to  carry not one but two different reports on German Chancellor Merkel&rsquo;s negative remarks on multiculturalism, both with the same headline:</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11559451" target="merkel1">Merkel says German multicultural society has failed</a> BBC News Europe</em> 17 October 2010</p>
<p><em><a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE69F19T20101016" target="merkel2">Merkel says German multiculturalism has failed</a></em> by Sabine Siebold <em>Reuters</em> Sun Oct 17 2010</p>
<p>(Note that <cite>Drudge,</cite> seeking to supply its readers&rsquo; appetite, had to use U.K. sources.)</p>
<p>Sounds good  &mdash;  but not good enough to trick <em>The Vanishing American</em>:<blockquote><strong>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. let&rsquo;s remember that she has said things like this over the years. I specifically remember a time a few years ago when a number of the Western leaders made remarks along the same lines, almost in unison. And <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4056109.stm" target="merkel3">here is a piece</a> from almost six years ago, wherein Merkel said almost the same thing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>this was just after the murder of Theo van Gogh, at a time when the peoples of Western countries raised a loud alarm about the Islamic presence.</p>
<p>So following these 2004 pronouncements on the &#8216;death of multiculturalism,&rsquo; here we are, <em>six years later,</em> still at square one  &mdash;  no, we are not where we were six years ago. We are much farther along the road to the loss of our countries and our culture. If multiculturalism was dead back in 2004, why is it still lurching along?</strong><br/>
</blockquote><em><p>Reports of its demise are greatly exaggerated</em> Saturday October 16, 2010</p>
<p>Citing similar speeches from the UK&rsquo;s Tony Blair and Australia&rsquo;s John Howard, <em>TVA</em> answers:<blockquote><strong>The same pattern is there in all these remarks by Western leaders: they claim that &#8216;multiculturalism is dead&rsquo;  &mdash;  which is just a way of offering a sop to their citizens who are now vociferously questioning mass immigration  &mdash;  but then they qualify their words by saying that &#8220;we have to have integration; the immigrants (who will, of course, keep coming) must learn to integrate and become part of our way of life,&#8221; etc.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>These &#8216;leaders&rsquo; are just trying to pacify the restless natives of their countries by throwing out a few deceptive words to quell the discontent.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They are just trying to gull and lull their easily-fooled constituencies. Let&rsquo;s not be among those easily fooled.</strong><br/>
</blockquote><p>There is no doubt that <em>TVA</em> is correct about this, as an attentive reading of the news reports here shows  &mdash;  for instance the Reuters version:<blockquote><strong>Merkel .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. said on Saturday that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Germany could not get by without skilled foreign workers.</strong><br/>
</blockquote><p>But reflexive pessimism is misplaced: that Merkel, just like John McCain or David Cameron, feels the need to make these noises reflects the perception that they cannot entirely ignore what their electorate thinks, much though they wish to. For this, heroes like Germany&rsquo;s Thilo Sarrazin and the patriotic blogosphere  &mdash;  including <em>The Vanishing American</em>  &mdash;  deserve much credit.</p>
<p>But as yet, no rest.<br/>

		<p>Finally a EU leader has acknowledged the major problem The Muslims haven&rsquo;t assimilated. Unfortunately for Frau Merkl, most Muslims won&rsquo;t assimilate or accept the Christian values she would have them live. You see, that&rsquo;s why Germany, Austria and most of white Europe spent 1,000 years of vicious battles to prevent Islamic armies from conquering Europe and eliminating Christianity.  Now however, Europeans themselves have already destroyed Christianity. So, is it too late to stem the tide?</p>

I believe Chancellor Merkel is confused.</p>
<p>While she says multiculturalism in Germany has failed, she then goes on to say she believes everyone should speak German.</p>
<p>I believe Merkel is not trying to end multiculturalism in Germany but attempting to make it work in her misguided belief that language could be the unifying agent.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe Merkel believes multiculturalism has failed. I believe she&rsquo;s just trying to force people to make it work through a common language.</p>

		<p>I might be wrong, but I get the sneaking suspicion that it&rsquo;s almost election time in Germany.</p>
<p>I can see right through Merkel&rsquo;s empty words.  Her only stated solution thus far is to make non-whites in Germany speak German.  Of course, making non-whites in America speak English has worked out so well for the cause of integration here.</p>

<p>Her statements can be denied and/or minimized ad nauseum, but the fact remains what she says is having a devestating affect in the minds of Europeans who are experiencing periodic non-white riots and aggressions from time to time.  They will soon be out in full force protesting cuts totheir freebies, but, unlike the Frence public, they won&rsquo;t have what amoujnts to rodyism, they&rsquo;ll be involved in full-fledged violence.</p>
<p>I look for assault rifles to be shipped to the Muslims, if they haven&rsquo;t arrived already.</p>
<p>Europe is closer to rejecting immigration and degenerating into racial conflicts than the US at this point in time.  Thast may change.</p>
<p>But the hundreds of thousands of skinheads in Germany and elsewhere are going to gain tens of thousands of new recruits on the weight of Merkel&rsquo;s statements alone.</p>
<p>Such anti-immigrant statements are devestating and should not be taken lightly. </p>

		<p>She needs to deport them all and quit asking for &#8220;assimilation&#8221;. I am so sick of hearing politicians, radio/TV talk shows saying &#8220;they&#8221; need to &#8220;assimilate&#8221; ie: nonwhites. </p>
<p>That myth of assimilating is not possible for other races, other religions to embrace. They will never make Germany a better place just as they don&rsquo;t make America a better place. In fact the 3rd world immigrants have made both places(America and Germany) close to hell to live in if you are White and paying the majority of the taxes. </p>

		<p>She&rsquo;s said controversial stuff before so I wouldn&rsquo;t get too excited, although this is nothing to sneeze at either. She&rsquo;s trying to avoid a Rightist comeback like in Holland, Sweden and soon in Austria but it&rsquo;s all talk on her part. Change won&rsquo;t come from Merkel, not that the Euro-Right is an end to itself either but a stage on the way to something better</p>

		<p>Merkel states that &#8220;our country called the foreign workers to come to Germany.&#8221;  I disagree.  First of all, the importation of hundreds of thousands from the third-world to fuel the &#8220;economic miracle&#8221; of West Germany was not the result of a grassroots campaign by the German people.  Secondly, the government of the FRG was firmly under the thumb of the United States during this era, every bit as much as East Germany was under the control of Moscow.  The only difference was the Russians used tanks to dictate events and we used American dollars.  </p>

		<p>All Merkel has said is that the Muslims are trying hard enough.  She still imagines that they can be pursuaded to &#8220;try harder.&#8221;  This means that she is not serious about the problem the growing numbers of Muslims in Germany and Europe present.  Until all countries in Europe decided that a 10% population limit is the law, and send 90% of Muslims back to their NON-DIVERSIFIED countries of origin, the eventual Islamification of Europe is certain.  The same goes for ANY Western nation regarding ANY problematic population group or groups. More than 10% of non- cultural and ethnic natives will change any country, and for the worse.</p>
<p>I have no problem with a world full of different races and cultures.  It would be nice to visit them all, if they could tolerate me there.  But I don&rsquo;t want to see ANY people destroyed for the sake of an IMPOSSIBLE Marxist ideal.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s as simple as ever:</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to breed with X because they are ugly or socially uncouth to you (which is to say Islam in general is a vicious and &#8216;unintegrateable&rsquo; religion and every cultural value deriving from it is thus suspect), you have to look at their TFRs and realize that _for every slice of the economic pie you give them_ you are also DOUBLING that slice of pie for each new immigrant that comes in to marry their kid.</p>
<p>Because your&rsquo;s isn&rsquo;t interested in taking a step down the SES ladder to become someone&rsquo;s sex slave and burqa wearing step-on for the rest of their life.</p>
<p>Not that these people -want- outsiders among them.</p>
<p>Not that Turkey is sending us &#8216;their best and brightest&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Not that they aren&rsquo;t getting on welfare and sitting there, with no intention of moving up as &#8216;skilled workers&rsquo; or trash collectors.</p>
<p>But really, keep it simple: If race/nationality-X imported to your nation as wage slaves is unappealing to you, don&rsquo;t be suprised if it is to others like you.  And at that point, you have an instant fertility rate war as to who owns the country in 5 generations.</p>

		<p>Whiteplight, your engaging in the same kind of double talk that Merkel is.  Ten percent ceiling limit on non-cultural minorities?  Let&rsquo;s shoot for 0 percent and let&rsquo;s not focus solely on muslims either.  There&rsquo;s all sorts of other trash that needs to be placed on the curb.  With high birthrates, that ten percent will double and triple within decades.  I&rsquo;m surprised that Germany even calls itself multicultural.  The population is more than 91 percent German and also consisting of immigrants with German ancestry.  You have the Turks and a scattering of other nonwhites but the rest are Europeans.</p>

		<p>Since the end of World War Two, the German people have been taught to hate themselves. The American occupation army took control of the German schools and German media, and began pumping a relentless flow of propaganda, which told the Germans that they are a horrible people. Germans were taught to hate their history and their patriots, and were reduced to a cringing and grovelling people.</p>
<p>The crime that America committed against the German people, is more horrible than the Reconstruction policies that the federal government imposed on the American South in 1865. At least, the children of Confederate veterans were not taught how horrible their fathers were, for fighting for their country.</p>
<p>The intense self-hate of the Germans is something that most Americans cannot even begin to imagine. America destroyed the Germans spiritually, and the Germans are now destroying themselves physically, given that their white population is declining.</p>
<p>In about a decade&rsquo;s time, white Americans may end up losing their right to free speech, and live under censorship, just like the Germans. If America wants to save itself, white Americans need to apologize to the Germans, for the Orwellian system they imposed on the German people in 1945. </p>

<p>I kind of find the phrase &#8216;blood and soil&rsquo; distasteful. I read it on the internet now and then. Maybe it&rsquo;s just a little new to me. White-Europe or something would sound better, at least to me. I am kind of a nationalist actually so I feel that each country should have their own. Maybe, White-Canada.  </p>

		<p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel&rsquo;s comment that multiculturalism in Germany has &ldquo;utterly failed&rdquo; has once again highlighted the dangerous ignorance of the &ldquo;adapt or integrate&rdquo; mentality which pervades civic nationalist thinking.</p>
<p>Ms Merkel&rsquo;s remarks, made to a meeting of her Christian Democrats Union (CDU) party, were widely misinterpreted by the controlled media as some type of &ldquo;anti-immigration&rdquo; outburst.</p>
<p>In reality, it is nothing of the sort. Ms Merkel&rsquo;s comments are actually is a call for even greater integration of immigrants from the Third World, not less.</p>
<p>Ms Merkel has in essence endorsed the &ldquo;become like us and do not form separate societies&rdquo; philosophy, which is prevalent in Britain in UKIP and other civic nationalist circles.</p>
<p>This belief, that Third World immigrants can &ldquo;become&rdquo; German (or &ldquo;British&rdquo;) simply by learning the language and not forming separate cultural ghettoes inside European countries, is of course as much of a disaster as the &ldquo;multi-cultural&rdquo; approach, and just as deadly.</p>
<p>Both approaches fail to account for the reality that all ethnicities are linked to a specific people, and cannot be &ldquo;transplanted&rdquo; like clothes or language by checking through an airport terminal.</p>
<p>It is for example, the uniqueness of the British people, their originating population and their ancestry going back tens of thousands of years which make the people of these islands unique.</p>
<p>In the same way, it is the ancestry, heritage and history of the German people which make them unique. Any attempts to deny this uniqueness by pretending that Third World immigrants can &ldquo;become&rdquo; British or German just by learning a language and dressing in a bowler hat or lederhosen, is nonsense, born out of ignorance or maliciousness.</p>
<p>To explain this in a simple way: </p>
<p>- Would an African who learned Mandarin and dressed in Oriental clothes become Chinese?</p>
<p>- Would an Englishman who learned Ngaanyatjarra and who dressed in animal skins become an Australian Aborigine?</p>
<p>- Would a Chinese person who learned Yoruba and dressed in African garb become a Nigerian?</p>
<p>- Would an African who learned Iroquoian and dressed in deerskin and wore a feather hat become a North American Indian?</p>
<p>The answer to all these questions is a resounding no, and only an idiot would even contemplate otherwise.</p>
<p>Yet, the very same people who would deride any of the concepts outlined above, would have the rest of the world believe that Africans, Asians, Chinese and all manner of Third Worlders can suddenly &ldquo;become&rdquo; European simply by learning the language and dressing like Europeans.</p>
<p>It is this civic nationalist ideology, also known as &ldquo;cultural nationalism,&rdquo; which is far more insidious and dangerous to the existence of the native people of Europe than even the obviously failed &ldquo;multiculturalism&rdquo; to which Ms Merkel referred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Multiculturalism&rdquo; implied the creation of a society in which each culture was allowed to flourish and exist, supposedly &ldquo;side-by-side,&rdquo; so that the benefits of diversity&rdquo; would be enjoyed by all.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism, and its twin ideology of &ldquo;cultural nationalism&rdquo; ignores the demographic reality of a higher Third world immigrant birth rate. This will inevitably lead to the overwhelming and destruction of the native peoples of Europe, irrelevant of the language and dress of the conquerors.</p>
<p>The fake &ldquo;multiculturalism&rdquo; and &ldquo;cultural nationalism&rdquo; ideologies, both rooted in civic nationalism, are the collective death knell of our people.<br/>

		<p>I recently worked with two young Germans and was appalled at how Americanized they were, i.e., dumbed-down, and how utterly uninformed they were about their own history. They had no clue about WWII other than that they were the bad guys and preferred not to talk about Germany&rsquo;s past. They wre more interested in ipods and quoting Homer Simpson and having the latest Playstation games. Pathetic, an entire generation mentally and spiritually brainwashed. Embracing diversity has not enriched their country any more than it has ours.</p>

		<p>Having been to Turkey and knowing a few Turk&rsquo;s in this counrty it is a little hard to understand the problem of Turk&rsquo;s in Germany, as it is they who I beleive make up the bulk of the immigrant population of Germany. For the most part they seem like rather pleasant people. As far as appearance and race they certainly look like most White European&rsquo;s. It would seem that after a generation or two in Germany or any Western European country there should not be much of a problem, having learned the language and custom&rsquo;s of the country. The Turk&rsquo;s seem to observe Islam rather quietly and don&rsquo;t try to shove it down the throat&rsquo;s of other&rsquo;s, as the Arab&rsquo;s, Iranian&rsquo;s, African&rsquo;s, and people from the Sub Continent do. I have also been told they they do not practice or believe in Sharia Law as Turkey is a secular nation. </p>

		<p>The population is more than 91 percent German and also consisting of immigrants with German ancestry. You have the Turks and a scattering of other nonwhites but the rest are Europeans. says poster #13.</p>
<p><br/>
91% German? I hardly doubt that. Have you seen all these muslims, turks, africans, etc. in Germany? They are loaded with them!</p>

<p>The crime that America committed against the German people, is more horrible than the Reconstruction policies that the federal government imposed on the American South in 1865.

<p>Very true. This is exactly what our enemies within this country are doing to Whites in the USA as we speak. Shame on White Americans for having a part in what they did to the German people. They are our racial brothers and sisters. Look back into history and find out who the real culprits are. </p>

		<p><i>Attempts to build a multicultural society in Germany have &#8216;utterly failed&rsquo;&hellip;similar speeches from the UK&rsquo;s Tony Blair and Australia&rsquo;s John Howard</i></p>
<p>Blair, Howard and Merkle are despicable hypocrites, selfishly, proactively  working for either themselves or their paymasters to destroy the countries and native-born peoples they were elected to &#8216;lead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The <b>only</b>way a multicultural society is able to be &#8216;successful&rsquo; is via a totalitarian/police-state government, lorded over by a strong arm Stalin-type dictator or via a morass of laws imposed and enforced by bureaucrats, as is happening in Britain, Germany, Australia and increasingly the US.</p>
<p>Either way, the government&rsquo;s boot is on the neck of the people.</p>
<p>Dr. Sean Grabb writes (about the blair government&rsquo;s proactive transformation of Britain into a Police State, beholden to the &#8216;laws&rsquo; of the EU):</p>
<p><i>Since 1997, Britain has been turned from a reasonably free country into a police state.  We have had a bewildering 5,000 new criminal offences created. In the name of &#8216;equality&rsquo; and &#8216;anti-racism&rsquo;, government power has been imposed into every area of private life. Call someone a &#8216;bloody immigrant&rsquo;, and go to prison.</i></p>
<p>Against whom were these laws directed?  Against whom are they enforced?</p>
<p>And Andrew Neather, blair&rsquo;s speechwriter, reports the following:</p>
<p><i>Labour ministers deliberately encouraged mass immigration to diversify Britain over the past decade&hellip;.a policy the party preferred,  was intended&hellip;to make the UK more multicultural, at the same time as scoring political points against the Opposition.</i></p>
<p>According to the Daily Mail online: Two million immigrants from have settled in Britain since Labour came to power andemployment rose from around 25.7 million in 1997 to 27.4 million at the end of last year (2009), but immigrants took 98.5% of those new jobs.</p>
<p>This is not about multi-cultuarlism or diversity or equality, it is a deliberate, concerted effort to destroy the Native Born White Populations of Britain, Germany and Australia.  </p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s working.</p>
<p>If you want to see what the United States will look like in 2050, come to California.  If you want to know what happens when Whites are lorded over by non-Whites, see here: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/3429wng" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/3429wng</a>   (but don&rsquo;t visit SA, it is far too dangerous).</p>
<p>I was hoping to travel to SA, it is exceptionally beautiful, but my SA friends tell me it is far too dangerous, especially for White tourists, who are frequently robbed, if not killed.  How long before England and Germany (and the US) are in the same condition?</p>
<p>Bon</p>

		<p>         Escape Velocity, maybe you should overcome your squeamishness. If we can&rsquo;t get beyond our feelings about phrases and how we look to other ethnes or to Liberal Whites, then we have no hope. We are in a battle for our survival. It&rsquo;s too late for all this self analysis. How do we win? By adopting some of the succesful strategies of the Left to begin with. And the basic one, the foundation, is that of &#8220;no enemies to the Left or in our case, the Right. Don&rsquo;t condemn the Fascist and the Skinhead. Work with them and when we have won our freedom, we can work our our differences or go our separate ways like family members sometimes have to do. For decades, the Right has been eating itself alive by throwing out people who were more radical than themselves. One has to contemplate here the idea of paid opposition. It certainly makes the job of the Elite very easy in any case. It has to stop.</p>

<p>She tried anything, she tried really really hard to destroy everyone saying the truth, but the people started to hate her. Now she tries to make a 180° round and goes the very other way.</p>

		<p>Great analysis from BNP News.  Merkel was praising Muslims just a few weeks ago.  This is a pathetically transparent attempt to score political points after several other politicians criticized immigration.  </p>
<p>Civic nationalism is worse than useless in preserving our people and civilization.  </p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t that what&rsquo;s being done to Whites in the US? Our children have been educated in self-hatred for slavery that was practiced 200 years ago by a small fraction of the Southern population. The majority of White Americans alive today have no blood relationship to the above mentioned people.  We have become so mired in undeserved guilt that we&rsquo;ve surrendered our future to the Left and their Black acolytes who live off us and commit violence against us.</p>

		<p>Regarding &#8220;Civic Nationalism&#8221;, France and Quebec engaged in this behavior, encouraging all comers to France and Quebec, to learn the French language. It didn&rsquo;t matter if they came from England or Zimbabwe, just learn French, and you are part of the Culture.</p>
<p>We all know that it doesn&rsquo;t work that way, and no matter how much French an African or Arab speaks, they are still Africans and Arabs, to their core. </p>
<p>Merkel is probably facing an Election year, and seeing other Right Wing Parties doing well in Europe, most recently in Sweden, she is trying to play both sides against the middle. </p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s too late Angie, because just a few short weeks ago, you said that &#8220;Islam belongs to Germany&#8221;, and that the Germans must get used to seeing Mosques across their Country. Now this?</p>
<p>This woman really is pathetic.   </p>
