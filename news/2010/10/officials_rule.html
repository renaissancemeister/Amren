<h1><a href="https://news.blogs.cnn.com/2010/10/07/officials-france-burqa-ban-legal-law-goes-into-effect-immediately/">Officials Rule France Burqa Ban Legal</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CNN, October 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>France&rsquo;s plan to ban the burqa and other Islamic face coverings in public places is legal, top constitutional authorities in France ruled Thursday, clearing the final hurdle before the ban becomes law.</p>
<p>In September the French senate approved the law  &mdash;  making France the first European country to nationally impose such a measure. {snip}</p>
<p>French people back the ban by a margin of more than four to one, the Pew Global Attitudes Project found in a survey earlier this year.</p>

		<p>I will not criticize this new measure, as anything is at least something.  So that&rsquo;s good news.  But it&rsquo;s hardly enough. It&rsquo;s only a sop to mollify the French right and take votes from the Front National.</p>
<p>There are less than a couple of thousand women in France who wear the burka, so this is a nominal gesture, almost meaningless, and those women probably aren&rsquo;t allowed out much anyway   &mdash;   if at all. </p>
<p>After this ban goes into effect, they&rsquo;ll not be going out at all. So how are they being helped? </p>

		<p>Lip service to some Frenchies is all this is, I DARE the French authorities to go tell the muslims to leave the streets that they are blocking by praying in them by their tens of thousands. The French should, and will, confine themselves to deporting relatively simple gypsies and DARE not attempt to deport or &#8220;outrage&#8221; the black African muslims, there would be blood, LOTS of French blood on the streets and in French homes and the French government knows it.</p>

		<p>Skip - Don&rsquo;t you think there would be blood here if we also tried to return blacks to Africa or Mexicans to Mexico via legislation, as if such a fantasy could manifest in reality?</p>
<p>As little as it is, I don&rsquo;t see anyone but France, Italy, and a couple Scandinavian countries taking the meagerist of steps to turn the tide.  Could it be that the habit of criticizing the French is so ingrained that we can&rsquo;t give them some credit and encouragement?</p>
<p>Good for France, keep going!</p>

<p>Well, let&rsquo;s see if they get away with passing that law without terrorist strikes and rioting.  It will be interesting to keep track of.</p>
<p>Let me just say I don&rsquo;t expect the laws to go any further in restricting sharia law, like preventing honor killings, wife beating and stoning women to death because they might have been alone with a non-relative male or wore lipstick.</p>
<p>And what if parts of Europe erupt in violence because of these restrictions?</p>
<p>Well, that laughing you might hear will be me amused that the elitist fools in Europe would actually be so stupid as to believe they could integrate radical fundamentalists into the general population.</p>

		<p>I think its likely that the Muslims in France will be instructed by their Imams, husbands and Brothers that they must all start to wear the Burkah. Is it realistic to suppose that tens of thousands of women are going to be arrested, fined or locked up? I&rsquo;m just wondering if there isn&rsquo;t going to be just a massive civil disobedience campaign.  Time will tell I guess.<br>
 I agree with others, this is a milquetoast action, they need to crack down on these street blockings, Imams rabble rousers, deportation of illegals crims, honor killers, anti-patriotic speechmakers &amp; have French police attend mosques on a regular weekly/daily basis so as to come to a better understanding of Islam - suitably attired of course, to avoid causing any offense!.</p>

		<p>Doug, as far as I know, it has been illegal since the days of Fascism to go out in public in Italy with your face covered.  I don&rsquo;t believe that the law is really that well enforced, but from what I been told, in Italy it is against the law to anyway make yourself unidentifiable.  </p>
<p>Anyway, I really, really hate the idea of any government telling people what they can or cannot wear. I hope everyone can look passed their dislike of Muslims and see how creepy this is.  Imagine if Congress passed a law would forbid every single American person from wearing one specific article of clothing.  Sorry but I find legislation like this to be horribly disturbing.   </p>

I agree. I don&rsquo;t think it is (or should be) the business of government to dictate how you dress.</p>
<p>For instance, the current &#8220;fashion&#8221; of many young blacks (and wannabe young whites too) to wear their pants hanging down below their behinds is ludicrous.  But I don&rsquo;t think it should be a matter of law to regulate it   &mdash;   just a matter of sense.  I don&rsquo;t find it offensive, merely laughable. </p>

		<p>The issue is of course terrorism!</p>
<p>Any rational person should be aware of the possibility of a terrorist male, posing as a woman, hiding behind a veil, and blowing people apart.</p>
<p>It needs to be done and it long over due. Skip is correct. France, as well as Europe in general, has become inundated by Muslims.  Why should Muslims enjoy the benefits of a country without trying to assimilate? If wearing a veil is so important return to Africa.</p>
<p>If you cower before a dog you will be bitten! The French are for the most part cowards. They do not understand that Muslims do not understand political correctness - look at how they treat their own women. It&rsquo;s disgusting!</p>
<p>It is true that all Muslims are not terrorists. But it also seems to be true that all terrorists seem to be Muslims. Outside of the legionaries, who for the most part are not French, the French have become so flexible that they are now totally limp.</p>
<p>The thing for the French to do is to say good bye to the Muslim Africans and immediately deport them back to their country of origin so that they can all then wear their veils to their heart&rsquo;s content!</p>
