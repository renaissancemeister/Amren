<h1>Staten Island Teens Charged With Hate Crime for Attacking Muslim Classmate Over Faith</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Lauinger, New York Daily News, October 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Four Staten Island teens are facing hate-crime charges for taunting a Muslim classmate because of his faith, calling him a &#8220;terrorist&#8221; and repeatedly punching him in the genitals, cops said Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;They took advantage of me because I was quiet,&#8221; the 16-year-old-victim, whose first name is Kristian, told the Staten Island Advance, which first reported the story of the abuse.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police said the four Staten Island boys  &mdash;  three 14-year-olds who are Latino and a 15-year-old who is black  &mdash;  were collared Sunday night on charges of assault and aggravated harassment, both as hate crimes. They are being charged as minors, and police did not release their names.</p>
<p>The teens tormented Kristian, whose family is from Trinidad, over a months-long period while they were classmates at Intermediate School 51 on Staten Island, police said.</p>

		<p>From what I gather many so-called hate crimes are committed on minorities by members of other minorities. That is certainly the case in Australia where conflicts between Vietnamese and Lebanese were common. And some migrants seem visibly afraid of Aborigines for some reason.</p>

		<p>Right, they will count this as an anti-Muslim hate crime BUT not count it as a hate crime &#8220;done did&#8221; by minorities.</p>
<p>Contrary to what Holder[ZANU-PF] says, minorities not only CAN commit hate crimes, but commit MOST of them. </p>

		<p>Watch for a fascinating dynamic in the reporting and responding to these Diversity vs. Diversity clashes.  The point of Diversity is to make White Humanity suffer, so when Whites see the Diversity fighting against the Diversity, we realize that they aren&rsquo;t so sweet and angelic after all, and are indeed as  dangerous and brutal as our biases, intolerance, prejudices tell us instinctively that they are.</p>
<p>The Diversity is always supposed to the victimized minority whom Whites must embrace in order to atone for our sins of segregation and exclusion.   Seeing the Diversity not act the victim, but act the aggressor, does wonders for White Humanity&rsquo;s perceptions of reality and of the progressive race mixing liberals (they don&rsquo;t really mix themselves,  but they insist that we do).   </p>
<p>As White Humanity becomes minoritized, the Diversities will not step in with compassion and community building, which is always a shakedown racket against Whites.  Once the White funding starts to shrink, then it will be back to nature and outright tribal warfare. </p>
<p>In other words, when Whites don&rsquo;t show up to rescue the third worlders in our cities, our cities will quickly descend into more third world chaos.  Good. We need to see that, and then hold White Liberal Elites accountable by demanding that they go in there in person and &#8220;do the right thing&#8221; to solve the problem. They will run the other way, being greedy btards that they are.  They will never take a position or action that costs them personally.<br>

		<p>Doesn&rsquo;t it seem very odd that a Moslem is named Kristian?  <br>
Anyway, as Moslems become more numerous in the West, attacks on any minority they dislike will of course increase.  I&rsquo;ve read that Amsterdam has trouble with Moslem attacks on gays.  This should present a real quandary for liberals, who pay extreme homage to both groups and defend their every action.<br>
I don&rsquo;t know if it would be worse to live in the dhimmi or in a secular society unguided by Judeo-Christian values.  But one thing is for sure  &mdash;  there&rsquo;ll be no gay pride parades in a caliphate.</p>

		<p>Many of us gays are often far more racially aware than you think.We white gays, anyway.  Some of the most racially aware folk I know are fellow white gay folk. This is because we have always been on the receiving end of so much nasty treatment and demonization by ethnic and minorities for so long.They treat us worse. We are usually the first to move into urban areas to fix up property, re-colonize, re-civilize, if you will. Why we have the rainbow as our symbol, I don&rsquo;t know. </p>

		<p>The NYC left must be besides themselves. A month ago in Staten Island there was an assault on a Hispanic that was called a Hate Crime. It turned out the perp was a black and the charge had to be dropped because it was a drug deal gone bad, so no more Hate Crime. Next up in The Bronx a gay teen was assaulted by a gang of street thug&rsquo;s, so we have another Hate Crime. Not so fast the gang is totally minority, so that makes it not so hateful. Last but not least we have a Muslim attacked, again another Hate Crime, but the same problem keeps popping up, it seems the bad guy&rsquo;s are all non white. What does the left have to do to get a good old fashioned dyed in the wool Hate Crime committed by a few White Christian&rsquo;s? It is just not fair.</p>

<p>I highly doubt what you say. I have seen MANY &#8220;White&#8221; gays with nonwhite men! As for them being racially aware, I have serious doubts about that claim. They work with nonwhite gays all the time in their line of work such as decorating, the movie industry, dance, cooking shows, etc. Watch these &#8220;gay pride parades&#8221; and they promote interracial mixing to the max. </p>

Yet again, homosexuality is sexuality, what you are talking about is flamboyant stereotypical gays. Many of us would never associate with people of other ethnicities and would not even think about dating someone from another race. Not all homosexuals are hairdressers and ultra liberals. I am gay and I cannot stand &ldquo;gay pride&rdquo; parades, gay people on TV (the stereotypical ones), etc. <br>
The reason that you don&rsquo;t notice gay conservatives is because we are normal people. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Many of us gays are often far more racially aware than you think.We white gays, anyway. Some of the most racially aware folk I know are fellow white gay folk.

Many of the great urban neighborhoods of today that are mostly white are due to the urban pioneers (mostly white gay men) who went in and made the areas habitable and functioning communities again, rather than the ethnic ghettoes they were before. I&rsquo;ve seen neighborhoods that look like warzones completely restored to beautiful Victorian Euro-American communities after white gay men got a hold of them. First, the gay whites come in who restore and rebuild the community, then young white singles and families move in and gay white men often move onto another neighborhood to make habitable again. <br>

		<p>Thanks for speaking up, Mr. White Gay. We all need to stick together on this issue, and I, for one, am on your side on this one. Think about it, doubters. The gays you see on TV are LIBS, just like the rest of the media. Don&rsquo;t throw out a good part of the population who would help Fight the Good Fight, not only racially, but also (and especially) concerning all we have to deal with now and in the future with the Jihadist crazies and their leftist sympathizers.</p>

		<p>i saw this in the post, saw no pictures of white kids and also read no mention of the race of the attackers, and deduced immediately that this hate crime was committed by minorities. looks like i was right.</p>
