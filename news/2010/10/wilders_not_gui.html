<h1>Wilders Not Guilty on All Counts</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>DutchNews (Netherlands), October 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The public prosecution department on Friday afternoon stated that Geert Wilders is not guilty of discriminating against Muslims. Earlier on Friday it announced he should also be found not guilty of inciting hatred.</p>
<p>Prosecutors Birgit van Roessel and Paul Velleman reached their conclusions after a careful reading of interviews with and articles by the anti-Islam politician and a viewing of his anti-Koran film Fitna.</p>
<p>They said comments about banning the Koran can be discriminatory, but because Wilders wants to pursue a ban on democratic lines, there is no question of incitement to discrimination &#8216;as laid down in law&rsquo;.</p>
<p>On the comparison of the Koran with Mein Kampf, the prosecutors said the comparison was &#8216;crude but that did not make it punishable&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Dealing earlier on Friday with incitement to hatred, Van Roessel and Velleman said some comments could incite hatred against Muslims if taken out of context, but if the complete text is considered, it can be seen that Wilders is against the growing influence of Islam and not against Muslims per s√©.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the prosecutors said the MP should not be found guilty of group insult.</p>
<p>The public prosecution department was forced to take the case by the high court after anti-racism campaigners protested at its refusal to prosecute Wilders.<br>

<p>Well, this is the problem, isn&rsquo;t it? The Muslim takes EVERYTHING out of context and is just so easily offended by almost anything. It is not so much that Gert is implying but that the Muslim is wrongheadedly inferring? </p>

		<p>This man is guilty of nothing but warning his country about the dangers Islam presents to every nation in the world.  Their stated agenda is to take over every single country on earth, and to impose shariah law on all those countries.  And they are willing to do it by any means they deem necessary.  I believe all Americans better WAKE UP to the Wilder message   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s just as valid here as it is in the Netherlands.  Islam IS the enemy; it&rsquo;s no religion, it&rsquo;s a political system masquerading as a religion.  The sooner we get rid of it and all of its practitioners, the better.  I support Wilder 100% and hope that our people here start developing the same kind of huevos he has.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m very impressed with European courts.  They always seem to make fair and non-biased judgments, even when dealing with nationalists whom they disagree with vehemently in the political realm.</p>

<p><br>
That&rsquo;s absolutely true, and it cannot be said enough. It&rsquo;s not purely a &#8220;religion&#8221;, as we understand the term. It&rsquo;s much more, and it&rsquo;s intentions on non-moslems are sinister.<br>
Furthermore, how can quoting from the Koran be considered anti-Islamic?  Absurd!</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve got to understand the psychology behind the so called &#8216;incitement&rsquo; laws. For most  people  busy and working or with a career, a court case like this could ruin them before   any verdict was reached, especially if they hang it out for months (as often they will).  Over here one of our  nationalists,John Tyndal, an old friend of Nick Griffin of the BNP (both of whom were  prosecuted under a similar act) was  driven to a heart attack and an early grave by such an action. <br>
If they cant get you one way they will get you another. I have a nasty feeling something unfortunate will befall Geert Wilders before too long. I hope I&rsquo;m wrong though. </p>

		<p>The man in the street will feel intimidated by the legalities. Most will feel it&rsquo;s best to keep one&rsquo;s mouth shut. This is no way to run a democracy. It&rsquo;s now been established that the speech of Geert Wilders is legal so in the interests of democracy an effort should be made to enable regular folks to express their opinions. I suggest a booklet be prepared which addresses various topics associated with mass immigration and demographic change. Topics might include Muslim integration, the growing black underclass, Gypsy fecundity, ethnic identity of Europe&rsquo;s indigenous people, or the future of Christianity in Europe. For each topic provide examples of legal speech and illegal speech. The government could take this on as a social obligation much like it takes on driver education.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m usually deaf to appeals for defense funds and such but I ponied up for Wilder. Now this was over a year ago and he was back in the news with the trial. I was prepared for the worst and delighted the result. Maybe, just maybe our European authorities are not quite so sure of their &#8220;Weltanschauung&#8221;any more. (Sounds weightier than &#8220;world view&#8221;)the best news for European whites in a long time!</p>

		<p>Glorious!  This was a politically-motivated prosecution intended to stifle free speech in what is - or was - nominally an open, democratic society, and the statist, anti-European, anti-white thugs got their hands slapped.  I don&rsquo;t know how the rules on legal precedents work in the Netherlands, but if they&rsquo;re anything like US case law, this whole farce just backfired on the &#8220;anti-racism&#8221; racists who brought the case to court, because the next time they try a stunt like this, the court will be able to point to this decision.<br>

<p>Right, the intimidation factor becomes foremost. You have to spend a lot of money and your time in court fighting charges that are mostly baseless, but must be fought. The noteriety too is causing a lot of problems, folks whisper and stare in your presence, etc. NO GOOD even when winning.</p>
<p>You begin to say to yourself: &#8220;I don&rsquo;t want to go through with that again!&#8221;</p>

		<p>Worth noting that Wilders has not been found not guilty by the court. The prosecutors have said from the beginning that there was no case against him. They declined to prosecute, but were ordered by the court to proceed. The court has not yet given its judgment. It&rsquo;s still possible that he could be convicted (though not likely).</p>

<p>Maybe not. Wilders seems to have influential backing that Tyndal did not have. So maybe it  won&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, government action like that is deplorable and downright unprincipled.  It constitutes a form of legal harassment and malicious prosecution  which should, in itself, be illegal.</p>
