			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), October 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Oxford University has come under fire after it was revealed that it only admitted one black Caribbean student last year.</p>
<p>The elite university recruited more than 3,000 students last year and almost 90 per cent of them were white.</p>
<p>Trevor Philips, chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission described the record of recruiting ethnic students to the country&rsquo;s top universities as &#8216;dire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Suggestions have now been made that ethnic quotas should be introduced to ensure more black and Pakistani students are given the chance to attend some of the best universities in the country.</p>
<p>But Oxford have dismissed the idea and said they would continue to work to recruit more undergraduates from diverse backgrounds.</p>
<p>Mr Phillips told The Daily Telegraph: &#8216;I personally can&rsquo;t see that quotas are the answer but I am reluctant to rule out any possibility given that the situation is so dire and in some cases we appear to be going backwards.&rsquo;</p>
<p>According to the newspaper just five black Caribbean students were given places at Oxford in 2008.</p>
<p>Mr Phillips said he believed more work needed to be to convince teenagers in state comprehensives to apply.</p>
<p>&#8216;Universities have to get themselves out of their comfort zones and look in directions that they are not used  &mdash;  look past the independent schools,&rsquo; Mr Phillips added.</p>
<p>Black Caribbean school pupils have some of the worst GCSE results of any ethnic group in England.</p>
<p>Concerns have also been raised over ethnic segregation, after the Equality and Human Rights Commission found that less than 10 per cent of black students were enrolled at Russell Group universities, including Oxford.<br>

		<p>There have been numerous articles of American blacks complaining of foreign blacks of African and Caribbean descent pushing them out of their affirmative action quotas in colleges and universities supposedly because they score higher on college entrance exams and make better students.  As lousy as these foreign blacks are on tests they must still score better than the homegrown variety. </p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s another case of Trevor Philips using his race card once again. He&rsquo;s Britains very own Jesse Jackson. Now it&rsquo;s apparently White people&rsquo;s fault that Black caribbeans do badly at school and can&rsquo;t make it into top Universities. If this is the case, can someone please tell why Black African students achieved HIGHER GCSE results this year than White English students? Are they going to accuse us of favouring other groups over others? </p>
<p>As far as the Equality and Human Rights Commission  are concerned, Whites are at fault for anything that is wrong in the non-White community. </p>

		<p>Build your own universities in the Caribbean.  Black Africans in the Caribbean wanted white people out of the Caribbean and now they are crawling to any white area they can get into because life is better near white people.  They&rsquo;ll never say that though.  They will bash white people while taking advantage wof white people.  Non-white people follow white people like zombies trying to bring us down.</p>

		<p>Oxford could set aside an off campus classroom in Jamaica where the students could earn PhDs in spliff engineering science, with a seperate program for PhDs in Rastafarian religious and cultural studies.  It could be funded by ganga sales.  Neatly seen to, I would say!</p>

I didn&rsquo;t know Oxford was under a quota mandate. Oh, that&rsquo;s right. According to the article, they aren&rsquo;t; at least not yet.</p>
<p>Once again, the golden rule of multiculturalism: There Shall Be No Objective Standards&#8221;.</p>
<p>I would suggest that they simply let in any Caribbean black or other and let them pass or fail but they would fail and their own failure would be further proof of racism.</p>

		<p>This is outrageous. Their entrance requirements are clearly racist. They must admit all Caribbeans immediately!</p>

<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s awful, terrible. I&rsquo;d bet a lot of young black Caribbeans would be dying to get in. A dire situation indeed!</p>
<p>&#8220;Black Caribbean school pupils have some of the worst GCSE results of any ethnic group in England.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh well, there&rsquo;s the solution to that &#8216;dire&rsquo; problem. And here was me, thinking the &#8216;system&rsquo; was giving them a rough deal and treating them unfairly.</p>
