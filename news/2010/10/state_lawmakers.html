			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Davenport and Amanda Lee Myers, San Francisco Chronicle, October 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Lawmakers in at least 14 states are collaborating on proposed legislation to deny U.S. citizenship to children of illegal immigrants, according to lawmakers, including the sponsor of Arizona&rsquo;s 2010 law targeting illegal immigration.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re taking a leadership role on things that need to be fixed in America. We can&rsquo;t get Congress to do it,&#8221; Republican state Sen. Russell Pearce, of Mesa, said Tuesday. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a national work group so that we have model legislation that we know will be successful, that meets the constitutional criteria.&#8221;</p>
<p>The efforts by the state legislators come amid calls to change the U.S. Constitution&rsquo;s 14th Amendment, which grants automatic citizenship to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants. Supporters cite costs to taxpayers for services provided to illegal immigrants and their children.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania state Rep. Daryl Metcalfe, the founder of a national group of legislators critical of illegal immigration, said the 14th Amendment &#8220;greatly incentives foreign invaders to violate our border and our laws.&#8221; He had a news conference Tuesday in Harrisburg, Pa., on the multistate endeavor.</p>
<p>The effort could run afoul of the language in the 14th Amendment and lead to a court battle over the constitutionality of the law. But Metcalfe said providing birthright citizenship to children of illegal immigrants is an &#8220;ongoing distortion and twisting&#8221; of the amendment.</p>
<p>Metcalfe&rsquo;s office said lawmakers in at least 12 other states besides Arizona and Pennsylvania said they were making their own announcements about working on the citizenship legislation. Those other states: Alabama, Delaware, Idaho, Indiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Texas and Utah. Legislators from a total of 41 states are involved in a Metcalfe-founded group concerned with immigration issues.</p>

		<p>They better pass something like this before it&rsquo;s too late.  I heard on the radio that by 2050, one third of all people in this country will be latino.  130 million.  If that milestone is reached, we will be able to do nothing to save our old country.</p>
<p>Everywhere I go, I see zero white women with babies, an odd black woman with a baby here and there and tons of latinas, each with 2-3 little kids in tow, even while she&rsquo;s pregnant.</p>

		<p>What a perversion of justice: the idea that if you break the law, the USA will reward you by granting citizenship (and free education, food stamps, medical care, Section 8 housing, special college admissions, and affirmative action jobs and opportunities) to your children.</p>
<p>Where else on the planet can one be so richly rewarded for intentially breaking the law?  It needs to stop, now! </p>

		<p>It only matters if these laws pass and are enforced.  Talk doesn&rsquo;t matter.  I am very, very pessimistic about America&rsquo;s direction.  And because America is so influential I think other white countries will foolishly follow in America&rsquo;s direction as they have with loosening immigration laws.  The Supreme Court ruled in favor of corporations in the Citizens United v Federal Election Commission, 558 U.S. 50 (2010) case.  Now foreign corporations can donate money to political campaigns anonymously.  China has a ton of money and you know they will flood the US with political donations to get politicians in favor of China in to office.  You know foreign countries through corporations will donate money to candidates who favor open borders in America.  Mexico will be at the top of the list because they want to take the Western half of the lower 48 states.</p>

		<p>Giving citizenship to the whelp of law breakers who snuck into our country is an insane outrage and surely anyone who cares about our country would agree that it is. But one can bet some court or judge will rule against the will of the people, since that is all judges have been doing lately. Judges run our country and anyone who thinks they don&rsquo;t hasn&rsquo;t been paying attention. At one time it was &#8220;government of the people, etc.&#8221; Now is it government by the judges, etc. And this makes millions of us sick, but nothing is ever done. We roll over. Judges at every level have far too much power, and everyone of them, including at lease five members of the Supremes, should be subject to recall by a simple popular vote, but that will happen when pigs fly. </p>

		<p>When American born children are deported or otherwise leave the country with their parents, I don&rsquo;t think it is unduly unfair to them. Up to a certain age the children have often benefitted from their years in the US. They won&rsquo;t be suffer in the future because of their stay. To say otherwise is a smoke screen thrown up by people who don&rsquo;t want to change the law for other reasons.</p>

		<p>About bloody time.  AS we all know, the 14th Amendment was added to the Consitution to give citizenship status to the 3.5 million recently-freed blacks whose ancestors had lived here for hundreds of years in most cases.  Suggusting that illegal immigrant welfare babies be given American citizenship due to this law is pure idiocy and would make the original drafters roll over in their grave sif they knew how their amendment is being insanely misused.</p>

		<p>What you are witnessing here is the de facto break up of the United States.  LARGE chunks of the US nullifying federal law and banding together to make their own law in DIRECT OPPOSITION to federal law.</p>
<p>In this case, about a third of the US, who is a citizen will be different than in the other 2/3.  That is some pretty serious and basic issues of law involved here.</p>
<p>So serious and so basic that differences like this make the two areas different countries.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately I live in the People&rsquo;s Republic of New York   &mdash;   where the Republicans are Democrats and the Democrats are Socialists.  So there&rsquo;s no real possibility of the state of New York joining in on that necessary fix to the 14th Amendment.</p>

		<p>This insane law as well as the lure of jobs constitutes the largest magnet for illegals to &#8220;break and enter.&#8221; If the citizenship law could be changed and E-verify made mandatory, we would see a huge drop in those breeching our borders. The rest need to be told to go home. Give them 30 days without penalty to leave. If they don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s jail time. We have 8 guest worker programs on the books now. How many more people do we need? Let&rsquo;s have a 5-10 year moratorium on all immigration to get our country back on an even keel. Then reduce the numbers of those addmitted drastically. We might then be able to survive as a nation.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Birth tourism&rdquo; is a special category of foreign abuse of the 14th Amendment&rsquo;s &ldquo;Citizenship Clause.&rdquo; Here are brief glimpses: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Korean moms want &#8216;born in USA&rsquo; babies,&rdquo; Los Angeles Times, May 2002: <br>
https://tinyurl.com/365qsg4 </p>
<p>&#8220;SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA: &#8220;In a few weeks, Kim Jeong Yeon will put on her baggiest overalls to disguise her bulging belly and board a flight for Los Angeles. She will spend three months in the United States, staying on a tourist visa, after which she will return to South Korea with a newly minted U.S. citizen in tow&hellip; </p>

<p>&ldquo;For many pregnant Chinese, a U.S. passport for baby remains a powerful lure,&rdquo; Washington Post, July 18, 2010: <br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/2a3vnod" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2a3vnod</a> </p>
<p>&#8220;SHANGHAI   &mdash;   What can $1,475 buy you in modern China? Not a Tiffany diamond or a mini-sedan, say Robert Zhou and Daisy Chao. But for that price, they guarantee you something more lasting, with unquestioned future benefits: a U.S. passport and citizenship for your new baby.&#8221; </p>

<p>&#8220;ISTANBUL - With more Turkish parents wanting their child to be born in the US, tourism companies are starting to offer &lsquo;birth tourism&rsquo; packages to US cities. Many women say giving birth in the US has benefits including cheaper education and fewer visa worries&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

		<p>For those commenters who are pessimistic about the outcome of such actions:  the federal government can indeed file suits, but even if it wins, how is it going to enforce a court decision against numerous states?  Send in  thousands of federal marshals?  These states realize that they&rsquo;re flauting federal law, so governors can be expected to resist even presidential edicts.  Right now, states are fighting Obamacare and marijuana laws as well, and, if they lose their suits, they&rsquo;ll look for legislative ways to chop the federal laws to pieces.  Obama has created a monster that&rsquo;s growing every day.  He&rsquo;s no doubt plotting to give illegals amnesty and thus create legions of new non-white voters.  As he sees his presidency sinking, he&rsquo;ll probably flail out to injure whitey any way he can manage, and citizens must be prepared to stand WITH THEIR STATES against federal powers!  European countries are passing law after law to thwart the third-world invasion that threatens them, despite the weak will of the EU.  Steel your spines, and VOTE to save our nation!!</p>

		<p>&#8220;The efforts by the state legislators come amid calls to change the U.S. Constitution&rsquo;s 14th Amendment, <b>which grants automatic citizenship</b> to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t these writers bother to do even a speck of research? The 14th says, &#8220;All persons born or naturalized in the United States, <i>and subject to the jurisdiction thereof</i>.&#8221; The debates at the time of adoption show this to have meant the 14th was intended to apply only to permanent residents, not travelers. </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a good discussion of the issue here:<br>

		<p>Advocates of citizenship sanity are confronting the same dilemma as the Southern States in 1860. The Federal govt usurpts the rights of the states. Today, the federal govt does it with court activism not even dreamed of in 1860. The &#8220;law&#8221; is against the state reformers: the Feds preempt who is a citizen, and the answer shortly will be anyone who steps foot in the nation, or born in the nation. The courts aren&rsquo;t going to bail out the states here, the judges generally come from liberal law schools with adamant pro-Fed power views that the FDR- and- after Supreme Courts fashioned, and which are dogma in law schools.<br>
Don&rsquo;t tell me what the literal language of the Constitution says; it&rsquo;s been years since most federal judges cared about that, whether appointed by Dems or by the GOP.</p>
<p>So,like in 1860, the choice is secession or obedience. IMO, no state is going nowhere.</p>

		<p>In one of my wifes college classes a couple years ago there was an in-class discussion about the number of children some of the students had. A mexican woman in the class said she had four and she and her husband planned on having at least one more. When some of the other (all caucasian) women in the class expressed shock that she would want to be &#8220;burdened&#8221; with so many kids she smiled and told them matter of factly that that was how they would take over the country. And this is in a state with a relatively small number of illegals.</p>

		<p>To Jay #1: I don&rsquo;t know where people are that they see that Whites are not having children. Where I live, I routineley see White families, or just White mothers, walking with at least two to four children. Most of these children, by the way, are blondes. </p>
<p>I do what I can, and offer these White parents coupons to Stores for infant and toddler clothes, and other items, that my children are now too old for. This aids in taking the finacial burden off of White families, if they can save 20% on needed baby clothes, or $5.00 on diapers or baby formula.</p>
<p>As far as the States are concerned, I believe that they should establish their own State Departments of Immigration. Any person stopped by a Police Officer, for a Traffic violation may be asked to produce a Driver&rsquo;s license. If he cannot produce one, and is suspected of being an Illegal Aliens, he can be detained, until he produces his Citizenship documents. </p>
<p>If it later turns out that the person is not born in the State of Texas, for instance, nor is a Citizen resident of any other of the 49 States, or Protectorates, such as Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, then these people are immediately Deported back to their Country of origin, compliments of the State of Texas. This will stop the Illegal Alien problem.</p>

		<p>To poster #20, those of us who are stuck in east coast urban areas (due to job situations) routinely go entire days without seeing any white people at all!  </p>
<p>Of course all these areas used to be 100% white 40, 50, 60 years ago.  Now I live in a 95% oriental neighborhood, work in an 80% latino/20% Chinese area and sometimes pass through 100% black areas when I have to go to the mall or something.</p>
