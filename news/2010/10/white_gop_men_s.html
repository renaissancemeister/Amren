<h1>White GOP Men Stand Out in Early Voting</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rob Christensen and Jane Stancill, News &amp; Observer (Raleigh), October 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The largest group of early voters in North Carolina is made up of white Republican men, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Democracy North Carolina, a campaign watchdog group.</p>
<p>During the 2008 Democratic sweep, black Democratic women led all groups during the 17 days of early voting. But during the first three days of early voting this year, it is white Republican men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Early voting doesn&rsquo;t favor one party or another, but reveals who&rsquo;s most organized and enthusiastic about making their voices heard,&#8221; said Bob Hall, director of Democracy North Carolina.</p>
<p>So far early voting has been especially heavy for a midterm election. In the first three days of voting, 72,173 people across the state have cast early ballots.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more than the 70,645 votes that had been cast at this point in the 2004 presidential elections. At the same point in 2006, 35,728 votes had been cast. By comparison 266,649 votes were cast during the first three days of 2008.</p>
<p>So far this year, registered Democrats are edging out Republicans, 31,910 to 27,623.</p>

		<p>For decades society has been brainwashed into thinking that white men will just roll over every time.  It appears the push-back is underway.  Time for America to get a little dose of racial reality.<br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know how it works in North Carolina but absentee ballots in NJ are not counted unless the vote in a district is closer than the number of ballots mailed out, if they are counted at all.  Once again YT may not be as smart as he thinks.</p>

<p>Sadly, you are wrong about that.  Notice that, despite everything, the overwhelming anti-white racism of the democratic party, white males (I won&rsquo;t dignify these people by calling them men&hellip;..because they are not) are lining up to vote democrat.</p>
<p>Now, the democrats are going to lost big time, in November, but that is not the issue.  The issue is that, because of what they have done, not a single white person should vote for them.  Yet the majority of those who vote democrat, are white.</p>
<p>What does this say about the nature of democracy itself?  Is this situation better or worse than if we had a pro-white dictatorship (with a vote that was only for show) instead?  Under which system would YOUR rights be respected.  Which system would you enjoy more freedoms under.  More security for you and your family.</p>

		<p>America is at a breaking point. There are so many hopes<br>
riding on this election. If white Conservative America<br>
is stripped of anymore power we will enter an entirely <br>
new phase and mindset in the country. Once faith in<br>
the election process is lost things will get very very <br>
ugly very fast.</p>

		<p>#7  Yes you are right.  It can happen here.  As we stumble to our death as a Republic, many of us that have served this country before will stand ready to do so again.  Maybe one final time to serve but for our children&rsquo;s future we will not go quietly.</p>

		<p>To Anon. #6: A &#8220;pro-White Dictatorship&#8221;? We had that. It was called National Socialist Germany. Looking back, I wonder why we fought Germany, and Italy, in the first place. They were at war with international Communism, and were defeating this world-wide menace, until the U.S. got involved in the war, despite Charles Lindbergh&rsquo;s best efforts to stop it, along with other real Americans.</p>
<p>No, what the U.S. needs to do is to return to its founding principles, and practices, at the beginning of this great Nation. </p>
<p>After the Constitution was ratified, only White men,who were  American Citizens, 21 years old, and land/property owners could vote. That would put this Country back on track, and as it was intended, in the first place.</p>
