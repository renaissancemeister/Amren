<h1>Tempers Flare at Anti-Diversity Speech by Richard Spencer</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kyle Blaine, Inside Vandy (Vanderbilt Unviersity), October 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Conservative speaker Richard Spencer presented his case against affirmative action policies to Vanderbilt students last night in Furman Hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would say the biggest lie at the heart of our society is affirmative action and civil rights enforcement legislation,&#8221; Spencer said. &#8220;Affirmative action is anti-white discrimination, period.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Spencer, the executive editor of AlternativeRight.com, adherence to affirmative action policies decreases institutional standards, threatens national security and weakens the economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Institutions have ceased to perform their functions,&#8221; Spencer said. &#8220;University systems have become sites of social engineering. Most people don&rsquo;t go to undergraduate universities to learn.&#8221;</p>
<p>During his presentation, Spencer illustrated his point with charts displaying the achievement disparities between whites and blacks of different economic backgrounds. The figures indicated that whites in the poorest income bracket perform as well as blacks in the highest income bracket on standardized tests.</p>
<p>Graduate student Sandy Skeen asked Spencer to explain the differences in achievement between the races.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not a scientist, but I would say that genetics has something to do with it,&#8221; Spencer said.</p>
<p>Those in attendance used the question and answer period to challenge Spencer&rsquo;s arguments and credentials.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In response, Spencer said that it is typical of students of leftist institutions to take an elitist approach and demand his degree in the subject.</p>
<p>Freshman Itoro Udoko asked Spencer how he would correct 300 years of social injustice against black in America.</p>
<p>&#8220;Should we also go after the descendants of the Africans who originally enslaved the blacks that were sent to America,&#8221; Spencer asked. &#8220;How does slavery make you not able to take a test?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I am shocked at the racism that is coming from the speaker and his lack of credentials,&#8221; said sophomore Arthurine Zakama.</p>
<p>The event was sponsored by Youth for Western Civilization, an activist group committed to restoring Western culture on college campuses, according to the organization&rsquo;s website.</p>

		<p>The marxist knee-jerk outrage is no more than could be expected.  The truly amazing thing is that this Richard Spencer was permitted to give his speech at all.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&ldquo;I am shocked at the racism that is coming from the speaker and his lack of credentials,&rdquo; said sophomore Arthurine Zakama.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Er&hellip;what a surprise.  How many students were <i>not</i> outraged?  How many were supportive of Spencer&rsquo;s views?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that I smell in the air?  Why, it&rsquo;s the winds of change.</p>

		<p>Some alleged student named &#8220;Arthurine Zakama&#8221; questioned Spencer&rsquo;s views on race, declaiming them as racist? I on the other hand, question Arthurine&rsquo;s rightful presence in this nation. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if she&rsquo;s Japanese or African. Go home. No wonder people want anchor babies to be considered illegal and to be deported. Does she think Vanderbuilt&rsquo;s academic reputation was built by African-descended or Asian scholars and thinkers? Does she think Cornelius Vanderbilt would have given to a penny to the University of today, filled with intellectual foreign born airheads with unintelligible accents?  </p>
<p>Of course Vanderbilt&rsquo;s greatest days were between 1925-1940 when it was home to the conservative, race-conscious group of proud Confederate descendents known as the Fugitives.These consisted of some of our greatest writers and poets, like John Crowe Ransom. Most of these current PC-afflicted students sound like their greatgrandparents were bathing in the sewage-filled Ganges or tending cows in Kenya at the same time whites created the once-great University. Vanderbilt&rsquo;s days may be numbered.</p>

		<p>I support affirmative action.  I rather have an artificially made 8-13% black student body than an artifcially made 50% Asian student body.  Asian manipulation of the education system is far, far worse than having a 8-13% black student body where most will leave before getting a degree anyway.  Asians as we have seen with California after removing affirmative action will dedicate their lives to test taking to get the scores elite colleges want.  Asians will stack their high school schedules with advanced classes, will enroll in seven week summer enrichment courses and will enter SAT boot camps years before actually taking the test.  We are going to hear white people say in generations to come &#8220;I spent my childhood in school&#8221; courtesy of Asians&rsquo; year-round preparation by way of programs to help black students close the achievement gap with white students.  More and more majority black schools are on a almost year-round schedule and I am sure it will spread to majority white schools.  Asians are not white or honorary white.  Asians are taking spots away from white students more than black people are.  Affirmative action is not a white and black issue.  The United States is no longer 86% white and 13% black.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The figures indicated that whites in the poorest income bracket perform as well as blacks in the highest income bracket on standardized tests.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just those stats would have been enough to send the little brainwashed bigots into ballistic mode, after having the lie that all races are equal pounded into their heads throughout their lives.</p>
<p>&#8220;Freshman Itoro Udoko asked Spencer how he would correct 300 years of social injustice against black (sic) in America.&#8221;</p>
<p>By giving them the same opportunities as everybody else, which they have had now for forty plus years, plus a racist affirmative action program that allows them privileges no white has.  Yet they still fail in spite of it all.</p>
<p>Obviously this little bigot, Udoko, can&rsquo;t even ask a question that isn&rsquo;t based on his years of mental conditioning.  Why is it necessary to give blacks anything based on alleged injustices when classism in this country has made many victims.  The white ones advance in spite of the injustice, as do dirt poor immigrants.  Only blacks are incapable of advancing themselves, and, as Mr. Spencer so aptly pointed out, the reasons have nothing to due with slavery.  </p>
<p>How about citing the real reasons like lack of ability and intelligence, so we can put an end to blacks blaming their failures on whites?</p>
<p>If these brainwashed zombies can&rsquo;t understand any of it, then let them live in ignorance.</p>
<p>We should just continue planning our parallel societies, preparing for secession or violent break up, because the hour is late and the situation is heading towards us like an out-of-control freight train.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Richard Spencer&#8221;, as a leader of the Faux Right, is merely a diversionary distraction, and is no real help to our cause.</p>
<p>What he says in the article above is absolutely true, and I can agree with it. How could I not?  But, like Michael Savage and a number of others, he provides more distraction than help, more complaints than solutions.</p>
<p>While he attacks the symptoms (which we all know anyway), he ignores the disease. He is the embodiment of the proverbial &#8220;red herring&#8221;.</p>

That question is based on an unexamined assumption. It&rsquo;s a non sequitur presumes guilt, like &#8220;When did you stop beating your wife?&#8221;</p>
<p>I would  ask Mr. Itoro Udoko just what Japan is doing to correct centuries of prejudice and discrimination against Koreans.</p>

		<p>Whenever a liberal starts bloviating about Diversity, I simply ask, &#8220;Diversity of what?&#8221; </p>
<p>This usually disorients the liberal, who tries to define diversity by telling me how wonderful it is, or engages in recursive definitions. When I continue to politely press the liberal for a definition, the exasperated liberal calls me an ignorant racist. I shrug and say, &#8220;Whatever!&#8221;.</p>
<p>I noted that in Spencer&rsquo;s address, he did not mention diversity. Rather, he dealt with affirmative action, and discussed its negative effects. I guess that liberals are no longer concerned with affirmative action (It&rsquo;s so sixties!), rather diversity has become their new weapon.</p>

		<p>If the same message is repeatedly given to blacks/hispanics that the free ride is over, what are they going to do?  They might just try harder to succeed!  Who is paying for this free ride, taxpayers?  This free ride would immediately stop, if money was taken from the people supporting this cult like (mindless) thinking to support the wasteful endless social programs.  The blacks will keep playing this shakedown of &#8220;300 years of social injustice against black in America&#8221; into infinity if a firm no is not given.  Blacks today are no better than the start of the so called &#8220;civil rights&#8221; movement.  The apparent success of blacks would all melt away if they were not artificially supported.  Just as in Africa, if left to their innate abilities, regression would occur immediately.   </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a low-blow to have nation wide affirmative action, and then say those opposing affirmative action must have certain credentials, like those bestowed by the very institutions that administer affirmative action. I guess only sometimes does &#8216;street cred&rsquo; trump all else.  </p>
<p>If they want a speaker with more credentials perhaps they should invite Jared Taylor of David Horowitz.</p>

		<p>How is the speaker &#8220;anti-diversity&#8221;?  Colleges can be as diverse as blacks want them to be.  All blacks have to do is do well in school, and presto, colleges will be racially diverse WITHOUT affirmative action.  A.A. is an admission that blacks don&rsquo;t have the smarts.  So the diversity ends up being between less intelligent blacks and smarter Asians and Whites, with Hispanics falling somewhere in bewteen.</p>
<p>And then we have the matter of &#8220;black colleges&#8221;.</p>

<p>What does this mean, &#8220;correct?&#8221;</p>
<p>As a democratically run country with equal protection under the law for minorities of all types, all anyone should be guaranteed is the right to not be unjustly discriminated against. </p>
<p>This idea of &#8220;correcting&#8221; implies some brand of social engineering which is inherently unjust to groups of people who had nothing to do with past injustices and who don&rsquo;t currently benefit from them. All government should try to do is level the playing field at this moment in history, and then step out of the way and let people rise or fall based on their own efforts. Anything more than that is to unfairly create new winners and new losers.</p>

		<p>Anonymous #3:  If you are a white person who favors affirmative action you&rsquo;re out of your mind.  Do you really want you or your children discriminated against?  Your complaint is that Asians study too hard so get too many of the slots in the universities (you may as well add Jews to the list).  My suggestion:  Quit complaining and crack the books yourself.</p>

		<p>I think it&rsquo;s encouraging that some of the indoctrinated masses actually heard Spencer&rsquo;s speech.  They can be as shocked as they want and object all they want - but the seed of Truth is now planted in their heads.  Within some of them, in time it will blossom.</p>

<p>(Oh, by the way, it&rsquo;s odd, isn&rsquo;t it, that even when internationally recognized authorities with advanced degrees, honors, titles, and Nobel prizes, have spoken out on this subject, they have been reviled anyway!

<p>Questioning someone&rsquo;s credentials is increasingly being used to silence people. Only people with the correct credentials are now allowed to hold opinions. I remember how this was used against Australian professor Andrew Fraser. I believe his field was economics so he was crucified for speaking outside of his certified field.</p>
<p>If anyone ever challenges you on your credentials to speak about race, ask them what credentials they have to ask such a question. </p>

		<p>Watch, soon they&rsquo;ll have to change the phrase &#8220;Affirmative Action&#8221; to something else. I don&rsquo;t believe there are really any liberals left who can defend it as a way to &#8220;make up for past injustices&#8221; - whatever that lie means anyway. </p>
<p>In essence, affirmative action has come to be defined as: &#8220;Genetically inferior (dumb) blacks who are unable to compete in school or in the workplace are given preference for college admissions and jobs based on the fact they are inferior (dumb) blacks.&#8221; </p>
<p>Whoever came up with this insane, distorted idea should go back on their medication. </p>
<p>Hey, it&rsquo;s not my fault blacks have an average IQ of around 80 and the logical reasoning skills of 10 year old whites. I&rsquo;m not in charge of evolution. But AfAc goes against basically every American notion of common sense and fairness.</p>
<p>Worse, it has sadly made blacks appear to be even more stupid and suspect than they already are. EVERY white person, on SOME level, believes that a black in a good college or a good job is nothing but an ignorant AA placement, whether it is true or not.</p>
<p>A black doctor, a black pilot, a black banker - would you trust any of the above. No. You think to yourself, why take a chance?</p>

		<p>It is far easier to argue against affirmative action by turning around the liberal&rsquo;s favorite line &#8220;that race does not exist&#8221;.  If this is so, then there is no logic in discriminating for, or against anyone.  Everyone must be judged on their merits alone and have equal protection of the law.</p>
<p>A potential nuclear weapon in the war against racial preferences is there is NO firm legal definition of race.  Consider, for legal purposes, a person&rsquo;s age, nationality, sex, marital status, veterans status, criminal record, credit rating, etc. can be readily established.  </p>
<p>Now even try doing this with race!!!  Is the United States Government going to write in the United States Code the legal definition of race by skin color, anatomical ratios, hair color, hair texture, eye color, or perhaps DNA sequences!!!!  The last nation to attempt such definitions was Nazi Germany!!!</p>
<p>If there are enterprising attorneys out there this legal challenge may go very far.  Think about it.<br>

		<p>It just now occurred to me that affirmative action needs to be expanded exponentially so that it affects Whites in the upper echelons of American society as much as it has long affected poor and middle-class Whites.</p>
<p>The Bozos in D.C. are going to waste vast amounts of our tax dollars on one thing or another anyway, so why don&rsquo;t we encourage them to fund massive programs that will make it possible for Blacks from the lowest rung of the ghetto ladder to attend the finest colleges and live in the very best neighborhoods. </p>
<p>The first order of business will have to be funding for the sky&rsquo;s-the-limit Section 8 vouchers that will make it possible for America&rsquo;s underprivileged Blacks to bypass our middle-class neighborhoods and spread their diversity, culture and joy to the exclusive areas.</p>
<p>Next we will need to push for funding for tuition and expenses for tens or even hundreds of thousands of our young Black countrymen. In this land where everyone has been deemed equal, it is shocking that in so many expensive bastions of higher learning Blacks are only allowed entrance in token numbers. Blacks should be as well-represented in America&rsquo;s best colleges as they are in the Post Offices of any major city. </p>
<p>Money alone cannot open the doors of exclusive colleges to our downtrodden Blacks. We must expand Affirmative Action to greatly lower the entrance standards for our greatest institutions. Any descendant of American slaves who puts out the effort to get a barely-passing score on a G.E.D. test should not be denied an opportunity for a top flight education.</p>
<p>Also under the new rules, a serious felony record could not be considered in the admission process of any college.</p>
<p>Introducing these enhancements to Affirmative Action in a bill before congress would force everybody to put their cards on the table. Socialist or Libertarian, Liberal or Conservative, the extremely well-off Americans who make the people who make the rules would finally have to admit their true feelings about forced integration.</p>

		<p><i>Tempers flare at anti-diversity speech by Richard Spencer</i></p>
<p><br>
The way Hustler titled this story demonstrates their bias. They say Spencer gave an &#8220;anti-diversity&#8221; speech. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, Spencer gave an <i>anti-discrimination</i> speech.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s unlikely that anyone could have credentials in this field simply because universities won&rsquo;t allow research into racial differences. Anyone discovering behavioral differences between the races would be exiled with their career in tatters.</p>
<p>When James Watson, co-discoverer of DNA, said that African intelligence was different to ours (whites) he was still vilified by an mob of unqualified leftists and social commentators, none of whom provided any evidence of intellectual equality.</p>
<p>If black failure had just been observed in the USA then MAYBE I&rsquo;d be a bit more believing of the discrimination thing. But blacks fail in EVERY Western country they&rsquo;re dropped into. What&rsquo;s their excuse for failing in London, Paris or Sydney? If they can&rsquo;t succeed in the richest, most liberal cities of the Western world then where CAN they succeed?</p>

		<p>Anonymous #5, what I find more to be the proverbial red herring when it comes to &#8220;our cause&#8221; (I put that in quotes because I wonder whether we&rsquo;re all in agreement here as to what, exactly that is  &mdash;  not to mention whether that might also be a sly way of begging of the question) are those amongst us who turn away (often rabidly) anyone who does not share their view that &#8220;jews&#8221; are the source of all of the West&rsquo;s miseries.</p>
<p>While I can understand the rationale for taking this position (aptly expressed in your analogy of fighting the underlying disease instead of just the symptoms), to say that those who work daily to counter the sundry &#8220;symptoms&#8221; of decades of an aggressive anti-white/anti-Western agenda are counter-productive diversions because they differ on the &#8220;diagnosis&#8221; is, to my mind, much more counter-productive and diversionary.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be suspicious of any medical professional telling me that there&rsquo;s a single root cause to all cancers  &mdash;  and even more so were he to be so obstinate as to be hostile to anyone who claimed otherwise (and inevitably spicing up the diatribes with crude references to them engaging in homosexual fellatio with said &#8220;root cause&#8221;)  &mdash;  especially when the targets of his condemnations are themselves aggressively treating said cancers.</p>
<p>Likewise, despite always being willing to entertain anti-&#8220;international bankers/Jewish/etc.&#8221; arguments, I remain wholly unconvinced.  Things are seldom so simple, and silver bullets are far more often fantasy than fact  &mdash;  the product of lazy minds desperate for an easy answer.</p>

		<p>Spencer asked, &ldquo;How does slavery make you not able to take a test?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is well known that slave owners practiced selective breeding on slaves. Intelligent slaves capable of leading an uprising would not have been desirable to slave owners, therefore it would have been expedient to breed slaves for low intelligence. This follows the standard pattern of colonial subjugation in which the subjugators begin by exterminating the intellectuals among the subjugated population (as was practiced on Africans by the British Empire and others), which has a long-lasting dysgenic effect.</p>
<p>Spencer said, &#8220;I would say that genetics has something to do with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just because genetics has something to do with it does not mean whites are off the hook, when whites were responsible for the genetics in question. To say that affirmative action is unjustified because black intelligence has a genetic explanation is equivalent to you smashing me over the head until I get brain damage, and then when I try to sue you for compensation because I can no longer work, you tell me I shouldn&rsquo;t be suing because my disability has a neurological explanation.</p>

		<p>I understand why some of you may consider Mr.Spencer to be a Faux-Right person or whatever the term is that some of you apply to an individual who compromises on racial issues. But I still think people like Spencer and even people like Mark Steyn and Geert Wilders (two random examples who are much more mild than we&rsquo;d like) are truly doing what they can, for the most part. I purpose that we not &#8220;throw the baby out with the bathwater&#8221; so to speak even if we all agree that they don&rsquo;t go far enough in their otherwise brilliant critiques of Islamic civilization. Hell, even Mr. Taylor, a man whom I admire, has wisely taken the approach that you win more flies with honey when he is allowed to express his views in the mainstream media.</p>
<p>With that being said, the following needs to be addressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Freshman Itoro Udoko asked Spencer how he would correct 300 years of social injustice against black (sic) in America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uh, okay, Mr. Udoko. You, being a predictable NAM, are playing the white Christian guilt card. Why not also consider the millennium long (and then some) Arab-African slave trade before wasting Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s time with your ill-conceived, historically myopic question? And though I greatly admire the Japanese for many reasons, why not consider what your Japanese ancestors did to people all across the Pacific islands and in Southeast Asia and Manchuria during WWII before asking your rather obtuse, ill-conceived query? Why not consider how racist all of Asia is TO THIS VERY DAY compared to white Christian societies? Why not consider how your race has basically wiped out the Ainu in order to secure your motherland which I assume you take for granted to be a Japanese birthright? Why is it always whitey, the most tolerant of all the world&rsquo;s races, that has to explain himself to the other 93% of the world that wants him extinguished out of sheer jealously? Why is it that Western civilization has to be held to this ideal standard that exists within the minds of leftists while every other culture from gets a free pass despite the fact that everyone prefers whitey land and moves to whitey land when given the opportunity? Answer that please, Mr. Udoko, you Marxist ingrate.   </p>

		<p>How is this guy Spencer building his career as some type of authority in these issues? When he used to edit takimag, I routinely contributed AR-style blog comments, which many readers encouraged and found useful, but which Spencer routinely deleted. Why is his career being built up by WNs when he is not particularly intelligent or knowledgeable, and was somewhat PC (and explicitly anti-WN) when it suited him? </p>
<p>Spencer is a phony, an ill-educated nobody, and should not be listened to. These student conservative groups should be inviting Jared Taylor to speak.</p>

		<p>When reading about the bizarre rituals of politically correct antiracism on US campuses, one would do well to recall at all times that we are talking about an archaic, formalized kabuki theatre which takes place on some other planet.</p>
<p>When I was earning my Ph.D. at an ivy league campus in the 90s, there were virtually no academically competitive blacks anywhere in the dozens of departments of the school of arts and sciences – despite aggressive and uncompromising affirmative-action policies. (There were quite a few blacks working as staff, many of them competent and courteous, many of them rude and comically incompetent.)</p>
<p>By way of compensation, a small group of incredibly privileged high caste Indians were elevated to the status of &ldquo;people of color&rdquo; – although in their own countries, they lived more or less like the aristocracy in old Europe, and regarded everyone outside of their caste and group as being essentially subhuman barbarians, including white people.</p>
<p>The campus itself was under perpetual siege by psychotic, drug-crazed blacks – referred to in the kabuki diction of my university as &ldquo;troubled youths.&rdquo; <br>
If you actually noticed that almost all of the crime plaguing our campus was committed by blacks, then you were unquestionably on the same moral plane with Adolf Hitler, Jeffrey Dahmer, and your average child sex trade trafficker. <br>
 <br>
Since everyone spoke in standardized kabuki code, one never knew whether one&rsquo;s interlocutor was completely out of touch with reality, or else simply conforming to Newspeak in order to avoid losing their funding/ job/ etc..</p>
<p>The vast majority of white academics and students are simply mouthing the lies which are expected of them, and most are terribly confused about how to relate ordinary observable reality to the exotic, breathtakingly unreal fantasy of racial equality in academic ability.</p>
<p>Rather than thinking of white people who are in denial about racial difference as ideological enemies, we should perhaps think of each as temporarily mentally disabled individuals who are located somewhere along a continuum from total denial to realism.</p>
<p>Our job is to coax them along the natural progression from delusion to reality. </p>
<p>Always remember: deep down, all whites – all humans – are aware of reality, but psychological denial is an incredibly powerful force - specially when reinforced by political cohesion.</p>
<p>in this economy, what college professor wants to be pounding the pavement looking for menial, low-wage work?? which University  student wants to lose a scholarship?<br>

		<p>Look guys these students are just children. So for a view from a [chronologically not physically] old man of sixty two let me not so gently point out how damn hypocritical these schools are [and I have been to both Ivy League and the S.E.C.].</p>
<p>IF, those at Vanderbilt were so damn smart then why haven&rsquo;t they produced a winning football team? Answer because they expect Black Players to be on the same level intellectually as White Players. It&rsquo;s this liberal nonsense that they continue to buy into in the face of reality. Know why Notre Dame can&rsquo;t have a wining football team? It&rsquo;s because every student [or at one time was] is expected to pass Calculus. {I know there is probably someone here from Notre Dame who will correct me}. IF you expect Black Football players to be competent students you are setting yourself up for failure.There are football players at Alabama who have never had an Algebra course, and who can&rsquo;t even spell the word Calculus, much less have a clue as to what a function is. </p>
<p>But you see the two schools policies [although I certainly respect it] give undeniable proof that at least intellectually, there are fundamental differences between the races.</p>
<p>The reason I have so much respect for Jared Taylor here is because he refuses to accept and promote a lie.  You can call us racist, you can call us Nazis, but I prefer to call us honest.</p>
<p>Not all Asians are smart. But America is going to have to deal with China and relatively speaking, soon! Rather than lamenting the fact that we have to compete with Asians we should relish the challenge. We can do it! I routinely run 10k&rsquo;s do you think that at 62, 6&rsquo;3&#8221;, and 210 pounds I have a chance in hell of beating someone 22, 6;3&#8221;, and 130 pounds? No, but the challenge will help make ME better. And today, we have no choice.</p>
<p>In my major at school eventually I was having Asian professors teach primarily Asian students. I thought, O.K. that&rsquo;s fine now lets see if you guys can beat me. Let&rsquo;s get it on. When class was over I would hit the gym or throw the piggy around with the guys the Asians would go into the library and study with their study buddy. My study buddy was Korean and she taught me Real Analysis Part III and I taught her how to throw a football. Was I &#8220;as smart&#8221; as this tiny little Asian girl? No! Did I work harder and improve because I wanted to score higher than she did? Yes.{When I finally beat did her by two points on the Mid Term she quit talking to me for a week} It&rsquo;s competitive! We can do it in this country.       </p>
<p>The bottom line to my little rant is this: Like it or not we are in a world wide competition with everyone. You may not like competing with Asians who study hard every day and are competitive but you are. They may live five thousand miles away from you but today five thousand miles is right next door.</p>
<p>We are Americans. We can compete. We can straighten out this country economically and we will because we are now going to have to - it&rsquo;s coming and it&rsquo;s called DEPRESSION!</p>
<p>I hate to talk about football and stuff but that&rsquo;s the way I am because the game in a sporting event particularly college football is a microcosm of life. In Alabama there are two parts to one season. One part is all of the games leading up to the Auburn game. The next part, the important part, is the Auburn game itself. Make no mistake the Auburn game is not a game it is a war! </p>
<p>Disclaimer: The following video is about football at Alabama. It involves rap &#8220;music&#8221;. It involves a substantial number of Blacks including number 25 Rolando McClain a two hundred sixty pound linebacker who now plays for the Raiders. The point of the video is this IT&rsquo;S REAL it&rsquo;s the way to live your life -</p>
<p>Nick Saban was a walk on player at Kent State. He became the premier head coach at the premier college football factory in the country. Do you think he made it this far by feeling sorry for himself since he is only 5&rsquo;9&#8221; one hundred 160 pounds weak and slow? He could have given up he could have quit. Yeah right! Just listen.</p>

Besides, the Veterans Affairs program I&rsquo;m using wouldn&rsquo;t pay for it anyway.  But besides this, whites are not going to look racial realities in the face until they have to deal with it.  And,that time is coming. That&rsquo;s the real tragedy of this mess our country has to deal with. I would dearly love to pack off those dumb kids to lovely black-run places like Memphis, Birmingham, and of course Detroit.  Anyone who lived in one of those garden spots like myself, discovered first hand what a majority of blacks are like.</p>

<p>In fact. when you get right down to it, if we&rsquo;re going to put society under a miscroscope to search for injustices and micromanage how everything should work ideally, then the fact is that ALMOST EVERYBODY,  or every group, has been the victim of some sort of &#8220;social injustice&#8221; at some time somewhere. </p>
<p>This applies not just here, but in every country and society everywhere.  Show me any country in the world that has had perfect &#8220;social justice&#8221; over the last 300 hundred years! That utopia doesn&rsquo;t exist! </p>
<p>That is why so many immigrants came to America  (and still are)  &mdash;   fleeing &#8220;social injustice&#8221; at home. They obviously thought that &#8220;here&#8221; was better than &#8220;there&#8221;.  So we weren&rsquo;t that bad, after all,  even though they encountered more &#8220;injustice&#8221; here.  But a sweatshop job and a tenement slum, plus some personal freedom and social mobility,  were better here than a peasant&rsquo;s  wretched lot back there. </p>
<p>Aside from a tiny percentage of the social cream on the top, a great many of our families from the common people - the vast majority - have come up from poor or less-than-privileged backgrounds. Nonetheless, aside from the blacks, we have coped, buried our grudges, and made the best of life, without dwelling on the past and making a living off old resentments against an imperfect society that our ancestors once lived in.</p>
<p>Oh, and finally, I would have liked to ask Mr. Itoro Udoko just why he is here,  wasting his time in this terrible racist country that oppresses its minorities so horribly. That does seem strangely contradictory, doesn&rsquo;t it? </p>

<p></p>
<p>Exactly!  Affirmative Action constitutes an admission that blacks can&rsquo;t make it on their own and need extra help. If they were smarter, one might think they would find this admission embarrassing. Of course, that thing about &#8220;300 years of oppression&#8221; provides the necessary face-saving excuse. But what person, in his lifetime, has been oppressed for 300 years? </p>
<p>Many of us always suspected (and many said it) that the supposedly temporary measure of Affirmative Action would become a permanent institution. And so it has! It&rsquo;s dug its roots in deeper with every year, and has become a whole &#8220;industry&#8221; by now.<br>
But, as MA says above, people are growing weary of it, so the manipulators may have to change its name to something better sounding   &mdash;   just as they change so much of their terminology every so many years, when euphemistic words take on a negative connotation (as they always seem to do).</p>

<p>The first order of business will have to be funding for the sky&rsquo;s-the-limit Section 8 vouchers that will make it possible for America&rsquo;s underprivileged Blacks to bypass our middle-class neighborhoods and spread their diversity, culture and joy to the exclusive areas.</p>
<p>Next we will need to push for funding for tuition and expenses for tens or even hundreds of thousands of our young Black countrymen.  In this land where everyone has been deemed equal &hellip;. Blacks should be as well-represented in America&rsquo;s best colleges as they are in the Post Office. <br>

_____________________________</p>
<p>I fully agree with Jim.  But we must go further still!   </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not sufficient to see to it that blacks flood the most elite colleges;  we must also see to it that the offices of deans, university presidents, and the entire faculty must be made as  representative as the post office.  Kick out the whites and put in the blacks!   Diversity now!  That must be our cry.</p>
<p>And private industry must not escape!  Executive committees, boards of directors, and CEO&rsquo;s must all be made  representative.  Quotas must be set, and a   required goal of 13% black  as the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM must be set, and  even more more if possible. (This does not account for other minority set-asides, which must <i>also </i> be provided.) </p>
<p>Blacks  (and other racial minorities) must be aided to claim their full birthright as American citizens.  On the other hand, those ethnicities who are found to be over-represented, must be ejected.  Full equality  at whatever cost must be the goal!  Until blacks and other non-white minorities are sitting in the boardrooms and living in the exclusive neighborhoods, social justice will never be achieved.  </p>
<p>Diversity now!</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re entire argument isn&rsquo;t based in fact either.  Do you expect anyone to believe that plantation owners studied their slaves and made determinations of intelligence and based a breeding policy on that?  How was intelligence determined?  </p>
<p>Your premise is nonsense.  Are you completely unaware that African blacks have an even lower average group intelligence than American ones?  Who was responsible for coordinating their breeding?</p>
<p>Were you also aware that blacks don&rsquo;t just display a lower intelligence in the US and Africa?  Blacks are at the lower end of the scale of intelligence than any other race, with the POSSIBLE exception of Australian aborigines, in every country in the world they have migrated to.  Were all their ancestors slaves also who were laboring under an intense breeding program by plantation owners?</p>
<p>Nobody did anything to blacks to make them less intelligent, my illogical friend.  But mother nature did.  They&rsquo;re hundreds&hellip;maybe thousands&hellip;.of years behind most other racial groups in the world today.</p>
<p>I would ask you to examine your motives and try to come up with an answer as to why it is so important to you to want to make excuses for blacks, especially since your excuses lack any validity and are obviously illogical.</p>

		<p>Many people beat me to it with the comments from our &#8220;selective breeding&#8221; expert. I only have one thing to add.</p>
<p>The flaw in your argument comes with thinking of humans in collectivist terms. Too many variables within the groups. </p>
<p>&#8220;White are not off the hook,&#8221; you say. Which Whites are you referring to? The Slavs who were ripped from their families and traded by Arab slave traders? Whites from the Civil War era, who gave their lives to help end slavery? Whites whose ancestors suffered short, brutish lives as indentured servants or whose forefathers were subsistence farmers and share-croppers? Whites who now suffer from black-on-white crime and those who have been kept out of schools/jobs by affirmative action?</p>
<p>You cannot classify an entire race as victims and another as victimizers. The &#8220;black&#8221; category contains many who were wealthy and never enslaved, as well as those who enslaved others. The &#8220;whites&#8221; category includes those in &#8220;victimized&#8221; sub-groups mentioned above.</p>
<p>Only be seeing human beings as individuals and not as members of a collectivist group can we stop the endless bickering over &#8220;who owes who&#8221; that leads to social engineering.</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;It is well known that slave owners practiced selective breeding on slaves. Intelligent slaves capable of leading an uprising would not have been desirable to slave owners, therefore it would have been expedient to breed slaves for low intelligence.&#8221;</i></p>

<p>* Despite decades of blacks denying the truth, IQ is genetic.</p>
<p>* African-Americans who claim to be descendants of slaves have lower IQs.</p>

<p>Right again.  But allow me to correct just one  word.  Blacks didn&rsquo;t &#8220;migrate&#8221; here.  They were BROUGHT here, by whites. They owe their presence on this continent, and South America and the Caribbean too, entirely to whites.  Without whites, they never would have made it on their own. </p>

		<p>Lets talk a bit about real discrimination. Blacks have essentially the monopoly on section 8 welfare slum mom tactics to produce incredible incomes and lives of luxury on the white mans back. </p>
<p>When we changed from public housing to section 8 housing we effectively added another half million people the the apartment competition in California. The prices of rent for low income and starting out WHITES become obscene. In LA, SF, and San Diego, the cost of what would be considered a basic apartment with a real kitchen, normal sized living room, and garage is now around 2500 a month. This is all because of section 8 housing, a huge give away to black welfare moms. </p>
<p>Who is suffering the burden, the welfare mom or the countless whites who are each supporting 8 people who dont work?</p>

		<p>28 Anon: How is it well-known that slave owners practiced selective breeding of slaves?  I have never seen any such thing demonstrated.  I just re-read the section of Kenneth Stampp&rsquo;s book &#8220;The Peculiar Institution&#8221; on slave breeding, and there&rsquo;s no mention of selecting at all.  Owners valued fecundity, plain and simple.  <br>
     Furthermore, if American slave owners selected for stupidity, why do Africans do so much worse on IQ tests?  Shouldn&rsquo;t those unaffected by deliberate dysgenic breeding be smarter than American Blacks?  <br>
     The British exterminated the African intellectuals?  What African intellectuals?  Did the Redcoats march in and massacre the faculty at Timbuktu University?  You really just pulled this one out of a hole somewhere.<br>
     Lastly, do you really imagine that slaveowners were controlling the sexual activities of their slaves?  Did they perhaps do DNA testing to ensure that women were not bearing children by some Black poindexter, and abort any children he may have fathered?  Or since they could not do such testing, do you suppose that they did the only thing they could to prevent such couplings, castrate the smart Blacks?  <br>
     Perhaps, # 28, you ought re-assess what your professors have been telling you. </p>

		<p>My mother recently told me a story about a family friend, an eminent geneticist, now over 80,  who emigrated from Nazi-occupied Austria in the 30s and fought in the American army in Europe during World War II (he is Jewish). </p>
<p>In the late 1940s, after being discharged from the US military, he applied to medical school. He was turned down by one Ivy League university, was told bluntly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We already have 2 Jews this year – that&rsquo;s plenty!&rdquo;<br>
The university was later sued successfully for having negative quotas designed to exclude Jews (all of the Ivy League universities have been until around 1950).</p>
<p>The individual in question studied at another prestigious university, where he is still on the faculty.</p>
<p>Negative quotas – to say nothing of having most of your people exterminated – do not seem to have prevented the Jews from achieving success as a people.</p>
<p>Positive quotas for blacks do not seem to help them achieve genuine success.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Freshman Itoro Udoko asked Spencer how he would correct 300 years of social injustice against black in America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Personally, I could care less about whether there was 300 years of social injustice or not.  I am concerned with the plight and troubles of my people (European Americans/Europeans).  Itoro Udoko comes to our country for its education and, then, criticizes our past countrymen.  The Founding Fathers established this nation as a mother country for European Americans/Europeans (this is reality).  For whom would build a home for people other than his or her own?   </p>
<p>It seems every university, in America and Europe, happens to be concerned with social justice and critical thinking.  To establish critical thinking, something must be put under negative scrutiny and criticized: thus, our history, our philosophy, our religion, etc.  The university system has been a &ldquo;hotbed&rdquo; of this type anti-European American/European thought for many years.  </p>
<p>&ldquo;I am shocked at the racism that is coming from the speaker and his lack of credentials,&rdquo; said sophomore Arthurine Zakama.  </p>
<p>Where do they get these names?  </p>
<p>Suggestion: Itoro Udoko, please go back to your country and take Arthurine Zakama and the rest of such like-minded thinkers with you.  America was not established for you and is not your country.      <br>

		<p>Anonymous 3: your thoughts on Asian students sounds the same as when the blacks complaint about those awful [non-black] folk taking &#8220;their&#8221; school slots.</p>
<p>Stereotypes are based on elements of truth, so follow along with me here.</p>
<p>Walk down to the local shopping center and watch the various families prepare for the next school sessions.  The black kids are picking out the latest bling and below-the-waist fashions. (Is FUBU stil around?). </p>
<p>The white parents are looking at supporters and shoulder pads for the boys, and a lovely new pink mobile phone with built-in FaceBook app for their daughters to gossip and say &#8220;ohmigod!&#8221; and &#8220;whatever&#8221; into. </p>
<p>Now look at the Asian families. They are hemming and hawing between getting the TI-89 or HP48gII calculator instead of the Casio FX9750.  Do they get the optional physics text, or the optional calculus text?  Heck, why not both; they&rsquo;ll just work a few extra hours to cover it; it will pay back soon enough.</p>
<p>And it should be noted that California&rsquo;s universities tried amending their admissions policies to DENY entry to qualified Asians in order to bring &#8220;balance&#8221; to the &#8220;diversity&#8221; they were aiming for.</p>
<p>Full disclosure: I live in Alabama; I love the South. But I find it shamefull that the overriding concern among the whites here remains who beats who at throwing a ball around a striped lawn rather than who brings in the post-doc scholarships, who creates the Next Big Invention, or Cures The Next Disease. Different priorities I guess. </p>

<p>Well True, so do I. But, it is possible to have a passion for more than one thing.To follow more than one road if you will, with no pun intended toward Mr. Frost. The issue here is to have a passion! I have much more respect for those red necked Alabama whites who have never set foot on the campus in Tuscaloosa [who at least have a passion for something] then I do for all of those intellectuals who have no passion for anything other than twirling their Phi Beta Kappa Keys! To some it&rsquo;s perfectly normal to have a passion for the arts but not for sports O.K. so how about having a passion for both? </p>
<p>I will never sing as well as Andrea Bocelli but did HE give up just because he lost what little eye sight he had at twelve? Listen to him  sing to Elizabeth Taylor. Watch her reaction when he goes above high C at the end [ to an &#8220;E&#8221;] - probably having feelings that she hadn&rsquo;t felt since those nights in Burton&rsquo;s mobile home on the Mediterranean during the filming of Cleopatra.      </p>

<p>This country has turned into a country of passive individuals who tend to give up and quit at the slightest sign of adversity. As you&rsquo;ve probably heard by now, Alabama lost it&rsquo;s last football game - but losing is a part of life - you think that Saban is just going to throw his hands up and say that&rsquo;s it - we can&rsquo;t win the National Championship so lets just quit? We can&rsquo;t get into M. I. T. or Cal Tech because of all of those darn Asians so let&rsquo;s just quit? We can&rsquo;t stop giving free handouts to Blacks because people would call us psst r-a-c-i-s-t so we just genuflect to every black? </p>
<p>Those blacks at Vandy were probably there because of Affirmative Action/Affirmative Discrimination and now they want to continually change the game because they can&rsquo;t compete in the academic game as it now exists.It&rsquo;s all fake.It&rsquo;s all disingenuous B.S. It seems very hypocritical to me to take the position that you are just as good as your classmates when you had a different selection criteria to get you there in the first place. And, you are allowed to stay in school too because your test papers are graded differently by so called liberal Black professors.I absolutely guarantee you that nearly everyone here could win the Boston Marathon; if, he or she only had say a twenty five mile head start!  </p>
<p>How much subjectivity is involved in grading a Math problem as compared to a sociology paper? Guess where the vast majority of the Blacks are? And the Asians? And the Whites?          </p>
<p>I can understand falling in love with Asia and I have myself, but not all Japanese are intelligent, although as a whole they perform significantly better on intelligence tests than do we. That said, Japan is not doing great economically either. Without a doubt Asians study hard, they also tend to be artistic albeit not particularly creative. Moreover, they are consummate thieves. If they can steal an idea without working for it they will -  and without any conscience or recourse in the process whatsoever!  </p>
<p>We complain  about affirmative action for Blacks yet expect it for Whites against Asians. No! Compete! If you want to go to a good school make good grades. Academics first, electives {i. e. sports,music, art, dance,} second  - we do what we have to do first - then we get to do what we want to do - but the secret is falling in love with learning period - then it&rsquo;s all good. The goal for all of us should be to continually try to improve!  </p>
<p>We are in competition for survival. China is rising! We need a return to the passion, intensity, desire, drive, commitment, integrity etc. etc. etc. that those guys had who signed the Declaration of Independence all had in the first place! If America had lost the war they would have all lost their heads - literally! That&rsquo;s called faith! That&rsquo;s called believing in a cause! That&rsquo;s called being an American!</p>
<p>If I were to have my way all of the so called African - Americans would be returned to Africa instantly. Mexicans would be returned to Southern Mexico. In my view, Africans, and to a lesser extent Mexicans are cancers that are absolutely destroying this country. </p>
<p>If I were to have my way there would be no more federally funded support for any woman who had more than one child by some derelict father. I would give financial rewards for children who did well in school. There would all kinds of reward incentives available for innovation and going green and absolutely none for bailing out Wall Street brokerage house. You think that the hedge fund managers would get a sympathetic ear by coming to me for a bailout out - at my country&rsquo;s taxpayer&rsquo;s expense? That would be tantamount to them asking for it from Max Keiser! <br>
     .      <br>
Max Keiser is a former Wall Street broker who went to New York University, not Harvard.  In the following clip Max takes on a prominent world renowned economist with all kinds of letters after his name [and who was probably bought and paid for in the process]. They have a little   &#8220;discussion&#8221; about one Wall Street brokerage house in particular. You would think that Max would know his place and be humbled and intimidated by his opponent who is a world renowned economist with all kinds of letters after his name?  You really don&rsquo;t have to know what a derivative is to appreciate the intensity and passion of this little clip. Jared, Max, and most of the people here have one thing in common: dealing in the truth!</p>

Alternatively, I ask the court to produce a black population without &#8220;brain damage,&#8221; as a control group, to assess whether this &#8220;brain damage&#8221; actually exists, or is in fact inherent to blackness.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I have copied and posted this earlier post here, because it fits the subject more succinctly.  It speaks to the requests from students at the event who demanded proof.  I only wish Spencer was aware of this, or if he was, had used it. - Whiteplight</p>
<p>Along the same vein of thought, or subject, this might be a good column to mention a book I have read lately titled, &ldquo;Before the Dawn.&rdquo; It is the latest book (that I know of) on the subject of genetic origins and is reviewed by E.O. Watson, the British Professor who got fired for saying that blacks were impossible to work with - some long time Amren readers and posters might remember that incident.</p>
<p>IN the book, a careful explanation of the studies made of dna since the latest techniques have been devised to demonstrate the movement and development of peoples planet wide. One reason the book is not an international best seller is because it makes the very dry, labratory observation that Africans, that is, those peoples who did not migrate out of Africa are uniformly of a lower average intelligence than Asians, Indo-Europeans. Special cases of for example Australian Aboriginals are discussed.</p>
<p>I highly recommend the book. It is of great use in defending not so much a white superiority claim, but an African inferiority assertion.</p>
<p>Anyone to miscegenates with Africans is absolutely stepping backward genetically speaking.<br>

<p>Are you native to the South or did you move in from elsewhere?  Judging from your name I am assuming you did.</p>
<p>I am from Alabama.  My ancestors have been there since before the Confederacy.  If someone doesn&rsquo;t like how we do things, then they shouldn&rsquo;t live here.  This is what I don&rsquo;t like about most Northerners who move South.  Don&rsquo;t complain if you choose to stay.  Obviously, where you came from wasn&rsquo;t much better.</p>
