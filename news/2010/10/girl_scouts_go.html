			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Edward L. Kenney, News Journal (Wilmington, Delaware), October 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Girl Scouts of America has been increasingly focusing on attracting Hispanics nationwide. The number of Hispanic Girl Scouts increased by about 20,000 from 2006 through 2009, with the total last year of about 291,000 representing about 12% of the nation&rsquo;s 2.4 million Girl Scouts, according to Liz Farrell, spokeswoman for the Chesapeake Bay Council.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re making up a large percentage of our population now, and our numbers don&rsquo;t reflect that, and we have to do something about it,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Across the USA, Girl Scout volunteers have been going into schools with high Hispanic populations, into Latin American Community Centers and other facilities to talk about what they offer. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A national survey by the Girl Scout Research Institute last year revealed that 50% of Hispanic girls have a desire to be leaders.</p>
<p>&#8220;They found that the main barrier for them in their aspirations was their self-confidence,&#8221; Farrell said. &#8220;Girl Scouts provides that. Girls lose their self-esteem around boys. We want them to know that they can test their skills and have that confidence to go on to be leaders.&#8221;<br>

		<p>This is the problem, rather than letting the girl scouts naturally become diverse (if they can), they would rather artificially diversify it. If I remember correctly, they did the same thing with African American girls.<br>
&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s too white it is a problem!&rdquo;  </p>
<p>If you want your children to be in an organization without being fed all the diversity nonsense, your best bet is to start your own group.   </p>

		<p>Everything whites do is being bent towards addressing the unsolvable and ever-growing social problems of non-whites.</p>
<p>Does any of it get better?  Ever?</p>
<p>The liars manipulate the statistics and say that the achievement &#8216;gap&rsquo; is closing, but then the next year we hear we need to spend even more money because Deshawn and Diego still can&rsquo;t read.</p>
<p>We are forced to see images of happy diversity in every ad and movie out there (the wise black doctor, the smart and sassy latino detective, etc) and yet in real life we see the opposite, so we&rsquo;re told we need more affirmative action to give those deserving non-whites a leg up without having them work for it like we must.</p>
<p>When the Obama appointed head of NASA said that Obama told him Nasa will now make middle easterners feel good about themselves, (something Obama denied, of course) I was speechless.</p>
<p>So the girl scouts will now just be an extension of ACORN or child welfare services?  Oh well, it was good while it lasted.</p>
<p>Lucky thing that the Boy Scouts seems so uncool to non-white (and even most white) boys.  I can hardly see any black or latino boys wanting to wear the little kerchiefs and memorize the oaths.</p>
<p>By the way, I see (every day) firsthand how blacks and latinos treat their girls, and it is horrible beyond belief, but the white liberal feminists won&rsquo;t touch this with a ten foot pole.  It&rsquo;s easier to keep beating on cowed white males.</p>

		<p>12% isn&rsquo;t fair and equal?  Hispanics only make up about, what, 15% of our total population?  That seems almost perfectly fair to me.  In most institutions, fracial inequality is magnitudes greater.  Just look at any political convention, Democrat or Republican.  Almost everyone there will be white.  Most non-whites would be black.  And yet, a disparity of just a few percentage points is apparently too great for the Girl Scouts.</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t this just define the insanity of the diversity cult?<br>
If they come to you with honest interest, great! Sign &#8216;em up. I guess.<br>
But only a mentally disturbed guilt-ridden white liberal will panic and go out recruiting kids that DO NOT want to be there in the first place.  All because of numbers on a page and unfounded guilt.  Insanity.</p>

		<p>Scouting is supposed to be a safe, positive organization for youth. If they start promoting it among populations with high rates of crime and gangs they will just chase the good kids away and destroy the organization. I figure that&rsquo;s their goal.</p>

<p>Do notice the put-down of boys.  Ah, yes, those wicked males are the source of all the world&rsquo;s problems, aren&rsquo;t they?  It&rsquo;s all their fault. If only we could do away with &#8216;em!</p>
<p>The Girl Scouts have been very lefty for a long time. They were taken over by the militants long ago. I think they&rsquo;re further left than the Boy Scouts. </p>
<p>At the &#8220;YW&#8221; in Boston, their two announced goals are: a) &#8220;Empowering women&#8221;, and  b) &#8220;Fighting racism.&#8221;.   That pretty much sums them all  up.  <br>
 -  Powerful, self-sufficient women who don&rsquo;t need men<br>
 -  Fight wicked racists (i.e. whites, by definition)<br>
 -  Men are evil (boys too).</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m actually most worried about Boy Scouts, which is still mostly white in my area. Diversity won&rsquo;t have much effect on my son&rsquo;s Scouting experience due to current racial demographics, but I&rsquo;m very concerned about future generations. </p>
<p>It seems minorities only like to get into a uniform when they&rsquo;re paid to, as with the police or the military. If general white tendencies over the last 50 years are any indication, however, whites will bend over backwards and change Scouting to accomodate the tastes, needs and whims of fatherless or violence prone &#8220;at risk kids,&#8221; all in a self-destructive attempt to attain &#8220;diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Scouting will be ruined forever.</p>

#11.  This slogan is on the YWCA buildings here too here in North Carolina.  Blatant sexism and racism from an organization that is losing its credibilty.  Why?</p>

		<p>I was a Brownie and then a Girl Scout growing up (this was in the late 70s and 80s) and I remember it being pretty diverse. There was always a sprinkling of a black girl here and there, a hispanic girl, some asian girls. </p>
<p>I think getting more hispanic girls could be a good thing   &mdash;   to get them away from that hispanic culture of women are slaves to be dominated by their men (whether father, brother, boyfriend or husband), to only have babies. Plus, it could help them assimiliate with AMERICAN culture whether they&rsquo;re a native born American or not. Unfortunately, I think what the Girl Scouts mean to do is make it more Hispanic rather than encouraging hispanics to embrace the American ideals of what the Girl Scouts originally intended.</p>
