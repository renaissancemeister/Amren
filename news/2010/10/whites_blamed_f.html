<h1>Whites Blamed for 85% Nonwhite Juvenile Incarceration Rate in NY</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>American Third Position, October 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A U.S. States Governor-appointed advisory group on juvenile justice has blamed whites for the fact that 66 percent of all incarcerated juveniles nationally are nonwhite, a figure which rises to 85 percent in the state of New York.</p>
<p>The Coalition for Juvenile Justice (CJJ), which claims it is a national nonprofit association, but which has nice offices and a large staff, says in a policy position paper on its website entitled &#8220;Unequal Treatment of Minority Youth in the Juvenile Justice System&#8221; that &#8220;youth of color receive harsher sanctions than their white counterparts at every stage of the juvenile court system, from the point of surveillance (including racial profiling) to disposition/trial, sentencing, and incarceration.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The CJJ paper goes on to inform its readers that &#8220;youth of color comprise more than two-thirds of the juveniles held in confinement, but less than one-third of the U.S. youth population.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite this statistic probably being inaccurate (primarily because the U.S. Census counts all people from Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East as white) the CJJ adds that &#8220;Latino youth represent approximately 12 percent of the U.S. population, yet 15 percent of the youth population sentenced to adult prisons.&#8221;</p>
<p>The CJJ demands that police, officers of the court, and correctional providers &#8220;ensure unbiased and rehabilitative treatment of all youth who come into contact with the justice system,&#8221; plainly implying that this is not currently the case, obviously due to the evil white racists who seem to lurk everywhere, putting nonwhite people down all the time.</p>
<p>At a recent conference organized by the CJJ, with the grand title &#8220;Fundamental Fairness: Working to Eliminate Racial Disparities in Juvenile Justice,&#8221; guest speaker Gladys Carrion, New York commissioner of children and family services, {snip} cited several reforms her administration has pursued, including eliminating status offenders in the system, investing in alternatives to detention, working with counties to develop risk assessment instruments, supporting home-based interventions, and introducing legislation to limit youth placement in state facilities to those who commit serious, dangerous felonies.</p>
<p>In other words, the way New York has addressed the embarrassing statistic which shows the amount of crime nonwhite youth commit, is to simply rearrange detention systems so that the figures are disguised.</p>

		<p>I think this report overstates the percentage of white juveniles and understates the percentage of non-white (and Latino) juveniles in the general population.  It is obvious that the juvenile population is less white than the population in general, so how can the juvenile white population be 2/3 when the overall white fraction is said to be less than that?  How can &#8220;Latino&#8221; youth be 12% when they&rsquo;re about that in the overall population?</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Unequal Treatment of Minority Youth in the Juvenile Justice System&rdquo;<br>
Roughly translated this means the occasionally the system works, and they dont like it. </p>
<p>Johnny gets in a fight (with one other white boy) and is paroled to his 2 parent home as a first offender.<br>
De Juan gets in a fight (actually he and 5 of his &#8220;homies&#8221; beat down a lone kid, putting him in a hospital) and the judge decides that sending him home to his single momma with 9 other kids she can&rsquo;t keep track of is not quite rehabilitative. </p>

<p>Just read this. See how ridiculous their thinking is, almost like going in circles. What do they hope to accomplish by ignoring the long rap sheets; hoping someone will squeal or testing them to see if they feel bad and need to kill someone today; sending a head-shrink to the house to hold their hands while they clean their weapons and ship their cocaine orders; and where do they plan to put these young hoodlums? Bottom line? More crime by minorities, making future statistics for them look even worse. What a waste of time and resources.<br>

I read the local black weekly and I listen to local black talk radio.</p>
<p>Blacks are absolutely convinced that whites commit far more crime than blacks but that whites are given a pass. One way by which this is allegedly done is white police officers don&rsquo;t arrest white youth. Instead, they take them to the parents and let the parents deal with the kids. Black youth, on the otherhand, are given a free ride to a police lockup.</p>
<p>Of course, I don&rsquo;t know how the police can hide the high numbers of murders in white neighborhoods committed by white youth. This is truly the conspiracy of conspiracies.</p>
<p>Also, blacks equate minor crimes and pranks committed by whites as equal to the crimes committed by black youth.</p>
<p>An example of this occurred when the Buffalo News reported that some white teens in a white suburb &#8216;stole&rsquo; a garden gnome. They then took a trip and photographed the gnome on the trip and sent the family the photos. This is a common prank (though I don&rsquo;t know why anyone would want to lug a garden gnome around with them on vacation). When they got back from the trip, they returned the gnome. Everyone had a chuckle; except blacks. They wanted to know why the white teens weren&rsquo;t arrested for stealing the gnome. </p>
<p>Blacks try to quate a prank with drive-by and revenge shootings and end up looking foolish.</p>

<p>Then why is the incarceration and crime rates for blacks the world over higher thanm any other group?</p>
<p>The study is the usual nonsense.  Any kind of study that has blacks or mentally disturbed leftist radicals on it is going to be a complete lie and totally worthless.</p>
<p>Why a study is needed to understand that blacks are incarcerated in greater numbers, because they commit far more crimes shows how absurd this governor is for ordering it.  He needs voted out of office.</p>

		<p>The only solution to the racial disparity in American lockups is for White people to start committing a lot more crimes, preferably hate crimes. They will also have to either leave a lot of forensic evidence at the crime scene or brag to underage girlfriends or a bunch of strangers about what they just did. Those are the tried and true methods that Blacks use to get caught, so those time-honored tricks of the trade should work for Whites also.</p>

		<p>Discrimination against minorities is only unjust if it is based exclusively on minority status.  Because blacks and Hispanics have higher crime rates than whites, a higher percentage of them ought to be incarcerated.  <br>
 <br>
This is so obvious that only an apologist for black and Hispanic social pathology would have difficulty understanding it.  </p>

<p>I can add to it, from having listened to black talk radio in St. Louis.</p>
<p>Its hosts and callers are convinced that every car accident involving white people is really a secret mafia hit, involving planted &#8220;devices&#8221; underneath the car.  So while it appears to the world that it was a car accident, &#8220;in reality,&#8221; it is all that covered up &#8220;white crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>Where they&rsquo;re getting that from is that in the late 1970s and early 1980s, there were a spate of such incidents in St. Louis, after a powerful mob boss went away to meet his Eternal Justice.  The remnants of the mob scene in St. Louis took out after each other, and some of those hits involved planted explosives underneath cars.  However, it&rsquo;s pretty easy for investigators to discern a planted car bomb from a plain ole accident.</p>

		<p>More blacks are in jail or juvie because their crimes are always more horrific.  A white kid stealing a candy bar or a DVD is not the same as a black teen robbing a quick mart at gunpoint, or shooting at a house while driving by.  A white kid pestering a girl for a date incessantly bordering stalking is NOT the same as a black teen raping a white girl impulsively when seeing her alone as an opportunity.  In these examples white kids get probation, the blacks rightfully get put away.  What don&rsquo;t these liberals  get?  Why would the ratio of juveniles in juvie hall NOT be the same ratio as black adults in prison?  The ratio is not the problem.  The fact that black felons, often violent felons or those in for sexual assault are getting out early IS THE PROBLEM.  </p>

		<p>Articles like this make me so mad.</p>
<p>I live on the east coast.  You hardly ever even see a white young person.  I&rsquo;m not kidding.  But you see black and latino youths ALL OVER THE PLACE!</p>
<p>The same is true for most major population centers.</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t it just last year or the year before when we were told that now white kids are less than 50% of all kids now?  So our people are decreasing yearly.  Why wouldn&rsquo;t there be a majority of non-whites in jail?  </p>
<p>And are those saps incapable of recognizing that in white neighborhoods you tend not to have stabbings, shootings, drug gang-banging, etc?</p>

		<p>Blacks are locked into failure mode in every single first world area the live in.  </p>
<p>They refuse to face up to the truth that they have incredibly high crime rates, mostly because they have incredibly high numbers of people who are just plain stupid and easy to manipulate.  I&rsquo;m sorry, but there&rsquo;s just no nice way to speak the truth. </p>
<p>Blacks belong in African societies, not first world nations.   I think it would be too much to ask them to migrate to &#8220;Mother Africa,&#8221; as Jeremiah Wright&rsquo;s church calls it, but they should be given the option of moving to two states right here in the US.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re never going to fit in no matter how much they are assisted or given outright.</p>
<p>They not only show no gratitude but they spit on our ancestors&rsquo; graves and straight into our faces.</p>
<p>Blacks are so unintelligent they can&rsquo;t see that reducing their prison populations will only put more criminals in their own neighborhoods to prey on them.</p>
<p>But, if that&rsquo;s what they want, I&rsquo;m all for giving it to them.  In fact I&rsquo;d go so far as to refuse to investigate or prosecute their crimes so long as they were committed against other blacks.</p>

		<p>Stealing a garden gnome to take pictures and posting on Facebook is not the same as armed robbery or car-jacking. Two white kids in a fist fight is not the same as 5 overgrown teenagers using baseball bats for a beat down. I&rsquo;m still waiting for Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton to blame Youtube for that kid that was beaten to death in Chicago with 2 x 4&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>In 2001 after the riots in Cincinnati, the police pretty much went on a work slowdown to show to local black population what happens when crime is not checked. As usual with blacks, damned if you do, damned if you don&rsquo;t. Granted, the Cincinnati Police Department has had more than a few run-ins with the Justice Department. I do not know if they are still under any sort of consent decree to hire minorities. Below is a description of the work slowdown from Wikipedia.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shortly after the riots, the police embarked on a &#8220;work slowdown&#8221;, where they reduced their efforts in an attempt to demonstrate their frustration with the additional scrutiny and lack of support from other city entities. This meant they did not go out of their way for discretionary or self-related work, but they still did respond to emergencies. The FOP (Fraternal Order of Police) president, Keith Fangman, said: &#8220;If you want to make 20 traffic stops a shift and chase every dope dealer you see, you go right ahead&#8221;, he wrote. &#8220;Just remember that if something goes wrong, or you make the slightest mistake in that split second, it could result in having your worst nightmare come true for you and your family, and City Hall will sell you out.&#8221; It is important to note that Fangman repeatedly denied there was an organized effort for a slowdown, but many of his various statements discouraged pro-active policing repeatedly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, city hall will sell you down the river!!</p>

		<p> Some years ago I had a freind who was a Phoenix Az police officer (now deceased). He worked a precinct near Phoenix&rsquo;s Sky Harbor airport that at that time was heavily gang infested. I had the oppertunity (twice) to ride along as a CO (citezen observer-I highly suggest it to everyone!). We conversed quite a bit about the nature of his police work..One thing that I remember clearly til this day is when he told me that the demographic of his precint was 17% white (officers are givin demographic breakdowns of their applicable precints). Therefore if we were all &#8220;equal&#8221;, one would expect that then 17% of the &#8220;gang bangers&#8221; in that precint would also be white. He told me that in the more than FIVE years in that precint he never arrested, seen or even heard of a white &#8220;banger&#8221; (even from other officers) in that precinct!!. Hmmmm??!!, we are NOT all the same folks!!&hellip;.I also remember him saying that if you where not a racist when you went into the force, spend about five years on the beat &amp; you surely would be!!..The randomness &amp; senselessness of black brutality jaded even the most hardened officers!.</p>

<p>This is ABSOLUTELY correct.  Blacks think they commit LESS crime, but Whites cover up our huge unreported crime rate.  I&rsquo;ve had blacks tell me to &#8220;stop lying&#8221; about the phantom crime wave that must sweep my white neighborhood every day.  </p>
<p>Blacks also routinely refuse to see the difference between the following two situations:</p>
<p>A)  White teenage girl, with no criminal record, steals $4 lipstick from drugstore: sentenced to community service.</p>
<p>B)  Black teenage boy, with <b>lengthy</b> arrest record and prior convictions, steals $45,000 SUV and leads police on 110 mile-per-hour chase through town: sentenced to 2 years in prison.</p>
<p>Blacks then scream, &#8220;Whites get community service for stealing while blacks get prison!!  Look at White girl A walking around town while black guy B is locked up!&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also heard black radio shows where the host and call-in listeners all agree that the litter in their &#8216;hood comes from white suburbanites <i>driving into the ghetto after dark</i> for the express purpose of dumping their household garbage on the sidewalks.  No, I&rsquo;m not kidding.  They will actually report that their sister&rsquo;s-friend&rsquo;s-mother&rsquo;s-boyfriend saw a line of Soccer Moms from 30 miles away drive to crackville to dump McDonalds wrappers.  </p>
<p>See, blacks have too much PRIDE to litter in their neighborhoods, but whites do it for them just to make them look bad!  </p>

<p><i>What does &ldquo;eliminating status offenders in the system&rdquo; mean?</i><br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>I think a &#8220;status offender&#8221; is a parole violator.  &#8220;Eliminating them in the system&#8221; means not locking them up.  In other words, they are actually advocating that we let black juveniles violate their parole without getting locked up for it!</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s an admission that blacks felons violate parole more often than white felons.  Not surprising, considering blacks re-offend more often than whites convicted of the same crimes.  </p>
<p>Blacks commit more crime, but that&rsquo;s not all.  Blacks commit more serious crimes, earlier in life, and their crimes get more serious <i>faster</i> with every new crime.  They get worse and worse and worse.  The most horrible juvenile sex-crimes and murders are usually committed by blacks - see Florida&rsquo;s list of life-sentenced criminals under 16.  </p>
<p>Whites are more likely to get &#8220;scared straight&#8221; after their first juvenile court contact, and White petty criminals are less likely to &#8220;graduate&#8221; to severe felonies.  Racial &#8220;sentencing disparities&#8221; disappear once you take repeat-offending and crime severity into account.  <br>

		<p>@7 Status Offenders<br>
Are those who commit a crime applicable only to a certain group, usually underage minors.  Drinking, Smoking, Truancy, Running away from home and of course: driving and firearms possession.</p>
<p>None of which would be considered an offense if an adult did it.  A &#8216;Juvenile Status Offense&rsquo; is the opposite of a &#8216;Juvenile Delinquent Offense&rsquo; in that the crime would have no age limit.  In Britain, these are termed &#8216;regulatory&rsquo; offenses.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
&hellip;supporting home-based interventions, and introducing legislation to limit youth placement in state facilities to those who commit serious, dangerous felonies.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Believe it or not, this might work and would at least solve the problem of hardened criminals teaching youth criminals how to be more brutal and/or efficient in their illegality.</p>
<p>Strap a GPS monitor to Leshaun&rsquo;s ankle and let him sit at home watching the kids and cartoons all day while mom actually goes to work.  About four days of that and I&rsquo;d be ready to join the Marines or a Priesthood.</p>
<p>I do not believe in the efficacy of our punitive incarceration system as a means to &#8216;convince people otherwise&rsquo; once they have started down a road to criminality.  An epigenetic switch has been thrown and together with the native abuses of incarceration itself, particularly if they are of a certain borderline IQ/social conformity group to begin with, they&rsquo;re a writeoff.  </p>
<p>And society is set up to treat them that way, correctly, with all the &#8216;must admit to felony incarceration&rsquo; limits.  Black + Prior Crimes is a one way ticket back to the ghettos.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also pretty much of the belief that if you can&rsquo;t get people&rsquo;s IQ up and delay puberty in blacks in particular so that they have a decent chance at getting that prefrontal cortex to inhibit some of their more feral notions, they are unsaveable by the time they reach adulthood.  Regardless.</p>
<p>I think we are dealing with genetic optimizations that are tens if not hundreds of thousands of years old relating to a fast track physical maturity that naturally robs the brain of development time and until we admit that, and allow the genetic science to prove it in finding a &#8216;cure&rsquo;, blacks will have a very hard time finding themselves a place in this society.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a pretty thing to say, but the sooner said, the sooner we can all benefit from a specific quest to find the long sequence DNA hap groups that seem to &#8216;switch on&rsquo; brilliance and social behavior limits for some, singular, generations, in all of us.</p>

		<p>Many juvenile offenders now get a pass because they are juveniles. If a serious rape, assault or homicide hasn&rsquo;t occurred, the kid, black or white, usually doesn&rsquo;t go to a juvenile institution, let alone an adult facility. </p>
<p>The problem is that juvenile probation or supervision is either poor in quality(who are the counselors in black areas?) or the staff truly is understaffed. Also, kids, all kids, do have emotional issues. When they get out of hand, bad behavior happens. </p>
<p>Psychologists, psychiatrists in particular, and even quality social workers want to work with: nice, nonviolent, non-defiant white middle class or upper class kids. You know who they don&rsquo;t want to work with. Can you blame them? </p>
<p>The few decent black mentalhealth professionals, and certainly the Asian MH pros, are not interested in clients like hip hop wannabes or their emotional troubles, which by definition, hip hoppers don&rsquo;t have, because lack of remorse is an essential part of that culture.</p>
<p>But even if you staffed up properly for juveniles, you&rsquo;d have more blacks,many more, than white kids, if the population is troubled youth who commit violent acts. There are many depressed white youth and black youth. But the blacks feel entitled to hit, shoot and cut their way to feeling bettter. Until that sociological fact is changed, by the blacks themselves, the prisons and juvenile facilities will be nearly all black or Third World populated. Are we going to send white young shoplifters, first-time auto thieves or pot possessors to prison just to increase the white percent of incarceration? </p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think this &#8220;nonprofit&#8221; professional black excuse group or the ACLU would sit still if you applied ECT or direct brain modification methods to the &#8220;youth&#8221;. </p>

		<p>The problem with liberals is they see criminals, especially non-white criminals as potential movie of the week material with themselves as the saintly savior in the starring role. Liberals have to be the most selfish people on the planet. </p>

		<p>Perhaps the concerned administrators can arrest and imprison random white kids proportionate to the number of minorities imprisoned. That way they can say, by their standards, that the justice system is fair.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m surprised the juvenile wardens haven&rsquo;t quietly taken the 1/2 black kids and re-coded them as &#8220;white&#8221; - that would solve their statistical problem.  There are tons of mulattoes in New York, unfortunately.  </p>
