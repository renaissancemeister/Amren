<h1><a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2010/10/transcript-of-president-barack-obama-with-univision.html">Transcript of President Barack Obama with Univision</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Malcolm, Los Angeles Times, Oct. 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Barack Obama was interviewed by Eddie &#8220;Piolin&#8221; Sotelo last week in Los Angeles for a Univision radio program that aired Monday.</p>
<p>Sotelo asked the president to focus on immigration. When the Spanish-language radio giant suggested that the Obama administration was more dedicated to fixing issues like healthcare than immigration, the president disagreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;My cabinet has been working very hard on trying to get it done, but ultimately, I think somebody said the other day, I am president, I am not king. I can&rsquo;t do these things just by myself. We have a system of government that requires the Congress to work with the executive branch to make it happen. I&rsquo;m committed to making it happen, but I&rsquo;ve gotta have some partners to do it,&#8221; Obama said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><strong>From the transcript:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Eddie &#8220;Piolin&#8221; Sotelo (EPS):</strong> Many Hispanics feel disappointed with you because comprehensive immigration reform has not been passed. What can you tell them?</p>
<p><strong>President Barack Obama (POTUS):</strong> Well, I&rsquo;m disappointed, too. As you heard in the introduction, this is something that I&rsquo;ve been committed to for many years. I committed to it when I was a U.S. Senator, I committed to it when I was a state senator. It&rsquo;s something that I deeply believe that we&rsquo;ve got to solve our immigration problem so that we&rsquo;re both a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws so that people can come out of the shadows, that people who are productive and otherwise law-abiding are able to get on a pathway to citizenship. They pay a fine, pay back taxes, learn English, become part of this beautiful American community of ours. And the fact that we have not got it done is something that frustrates me and I know that it frustrates many people in the community. But I think it&rsquo;s important for people to understand why it hasn&rsquo;t gotten done. In the United States Senate, over the last two years, many Republicans who used to support Comprehensive Immigration Reform, like John McCain, decided not to support it and in the Senate, you&rsquo;ve got a rule that says 50 votes is not enough. That you can&rsquo;t just pass a law with 50 or 51 votes, you have to have a super majority of 60 votes. We have the majority of Democrats supporting us, so I could easily get 50 votes, Democratic votes, but I&rsquo;d need some help from our Republican friends. And what happened was we still have 11 Republicans in the United States Senate who voted for Comprehensive Immigration Reform four years ago, but now are not willing to step up. And so the problem that we have is, is that until I can get some cooperation from the other side, then people who are anti-immigration reform can continue to block it. And that&rsquo;s why this election coming up is so important because we essentially have to say that those who are politicizing the issue, who are supportive of the Arizona law, who talk only about border security but aren&rsquo;t willing to talk about the other aspects of this, who don&rsquo;t support the Dream Act, who are out there engaging in rhetoric that is divisive and damaging that   &mdash;   those aren&rsquo;t the kinds of folks who represent our core American values.</p>
<p>(snip)</p>
<p><strong>EPS:</strong> When is [amnesty] going to happen?</p>
<p><strong>POTUS:</strong> Well, here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re gonna do. We&rsquo;re gonna see how well we do in this election and I think a lot of it is gonna depend on whether we still have some support not only from Democrats, but also Republicans, but they&rsquo;re gonna be paying attention to this election. And if Latinos sit out the election instead of saying, we&rsquo;re gonna punish our enemies and we&rsquo;re gonna reward our friends who stand with us on issues that are important to us, if they don&rsquo;t see that kind of upsurge in voting in this election, then I think it&rsquo;s gonna be harder and that&rsquo;s why I think it&rsquo;s so important that people focus on voting on November 2.</p>

<p>This coming from the same President whose new cause celebre is anti-bullying.  Then again, he&rsquo;s only &#8220;anti-bullying&#8221; if gays are being bullied.  When IMHO, young gays aren&rsquo;t really being bullied (by mostly non-whites, BTW) because they&rsquo;re gay, they&rsquo;re being bullied because they&rsquo;re white, and the media and law enforcement are taking the occasion of anti-gay slurs uttered in the assaults to portray them as &#8220;anti-gay&#8221; hate crimes, as a fan dance to distract from the anti-White nature of the crimes.</p>

<p>What ever happened to the post-racial General Secretary, that was &ldquo;gonna&rdquo; unite us and end this sort of divisiveness?</p>
<p>Well, the mulatto majesty&rsquo;s true colors come out here, and they are clearly and viciously Red and anti-white. It is all about these &ldquo;undocumented&rdquo; enrichments&rsquo; sense of vengeance and entitlement, along with his own idiotically cherished hatreds, that is really being determined in this election. He says so himself; however, the fool either doesn&rsquo;t realize, or is so arrogant as not to care here, that he misses a crucial point of demarcation. </p>
<p>If these Latino invaders and Reds like himself see majority white America as their enemies to be punished, then how should we view them and react in response?</p>
<p>I think the answer is obvious,</p>
<p>John PM!</p>

		<p>Obama&rsquo;s true colors seem to be coming out, describing Americans who disagree with him as &#8220;enemies&#8221;, thus heightening the increasing sense of division and antagonism in this country. He&rsquo;s an incompetent, verbose phony who conned millions of people last time around and, should he be reelected, would probably feel less restrained in attacking the welfare of the average person. One term and out, I hope.    </p>

<p> It&rsquo;s all too plain who he means when he says, &#8220;our enemies.&#8221; He means all us nasty ole White folks who don&rsquo;t want this country overrun by Mexicans, as it&rsquo;s in the process of being. What is Obama&rsquo;s statement but xenophobia in reverse? We&rsquo;re &#8220;the enemy&#8221; because we&rsquo;re lighter skinned than him and his Latino buddies   &mdash;   that&rsquo;s what it boils down to.</p>
<p> I never cease being amazed, and appalled, at this man&rsquo;s arrogance and thinly-veiled anti-White racism.</p>

<p>Nope, he sounds more like good old Uncle Joe talking about the Kulaks if you ask me. And make no mistakes, if he could (and he is trying like crazy,) he would starve us all to death. Comrade BO makes President Nixon look like a schoolboy in comparison; he is the perfect personification of the multicultural revolution in both this country, and the West as a whole.</p>

		<p>Talk like this coming from the Obamination merely proves a lot of whites perceptions that blacks and Hispanics are their enemies, and that we will have to kill or drive them out. Watch sales of guns, ammunition and body armor go to new heights. When government officials describe entire segments of a nation&rsquo;s population as enemies, civil war is inevitable. Knowing how blacks and Hispanics already have committed what I call genocidal atrocities against whites, this promises to be an incredibly brutal, decades long bloodletting that will end with whites carving out a homeland by force. Once that happens, anyone with brown skin will have two choices, flee or die at the hands of vengeful whites. AS for Obama, only a sociopath would call the majority of the population enemies because they do not want to be pushed out then killed in their own country by invaders from Mexico.</p>

Nixon? We should be so lucky. Reminded me more of Stalin, Mao, Castro, or some other, high-body-count mass-murderer of the Marxist-Leninist school. You know: &#8220;Comrade, we must punish the enemies of the glorious people&rsquo;s revolution,&#8221; etc. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve always known I was an enemy of the president.  It&rsquo;s good to hear him speak in such candid terms.  The Bolsheviks often used the term &#8220;enemy&#8221; or &#8220;class enemy&#8221; to describe the hated bourgeoisie.  Lenin referred to those who opposed him as &#8220;insects.&#8221;  As far as I&rsquo;m aware, Obama at least hasn&rsquo;t called me an insect.      </p>

		<p>A powerful illustration of what&rsquo;s at stake in these endless battles over immigration policy between the American governing and media elite and the American people is a piece by Harvard-educated veteran foreign service officer, David Timmins, now retired.</p>
<p>The article is &ldquo;Mexicans migrate to &lsquo;their land,&rsquo;&rdquo; (Deseret Morning News, Salt Lake City, April 19, 2006)<br>
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/2695q6w" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2695q6w</a></p>
<p>HIGHLIGHTS BELOW:</p>
<p>TIMMINS: &ldquo;RECONQUISTA&rdquo; IS MEXICAN GOVERNMENT POLICY:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mexicans see the Western U.S. as part of Mexico that was stolen from them 150 years ago. They believe this with all their heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>WHILE POSTED IN MEXICO, TIMMINS WARNED WASHINGTON:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lived in Mexico 20 years ago, and during that time I reported without much attention being paid in Washington on the evolving Mexican government policy of passively promoting illegal immigration as part of a deliberate and long-range strategy to regain control of the border and mountain states it lost during the Mexican War of 1847-48.&rdquo; </p>
<p>CHILDREN ARE TAUGHT THAT THE U. S. SOUTHWEST IS MEXICO&rsquo;S:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was visiting the Museum of National History in Mexico City where I observed a class of perhaps 40 10-year-old school kids sitting on the ground in front of a huge mosaic map that was labeled &ldquo;Mexico Integral,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Greater Mexico.&rdquo; Their teacher expounded on how the Norteamericanos stole half of Mexico in 1847. The map showed Mexico to include Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Arizona, Nevada, California, most of Idaho, and Oregon and Washington up to the Alaska panhandle.&rdquo; </p>
<p>MEXICO&rsquo;S OBJECTIVE: DO WHAT AMERICANS DID TO THEM 150 YEARS AGO: Referring to the large numbers of Mexicans streaming into the United States and to the Anglos who once streamed into Texas, California, and the rest of the Southwest:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have an undeclared policy to retake by infiltration what they lost by infiltration.&rdquo; </p>
<p>PART OF THE INFILTRATION POLICY IS TO KEEP EMIGRANTS IN THE U. S.  &mdash;  AMERICAN CITIZENS OR NOT  &mdash;  LOYAL TO MEXICAN CULTURE: MUSIC, FOOD, AND ESPECIALLY LANGUAGE:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their object is to not shift the border on the maps but shift the border in people&rsquo;s minds.&rdquo; </p>
<p>WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO THWART MEXICAN INFILTRATION? Denial of all benefits to illegals including the ability to send money home and serious penalties for those who hire illegals:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only going to corrupt our system if we don&rsquo;t get control of our borders and control of our assimilation process. The notion that all that is needed is enforcement of existing law plus a guest worker program is simplistic beyond description.&rdquo;<br>

		<p>Obama and the &#8220;Latinos&#8221; speaks for 95% of all nonwhites in this country. They hate and envy White people at the same time. Until Whites fully awaken to the &#8220;enemy within&#8221; this will only get worse. I am so tired of the White talk show hosts, the media, etc constantly promoting nonwhites as being something WE should strive for.  They will only point out any &#8220;good&#8221; thing they have done while pointing out the &#8220;bad&#8221; things Whites have done or said. If a White states the facts of nonwhite crimes we are told that it is only a &#8220;few&#8221; in their community that commit these crimes and that Whites commit crimes too&hellip;same ole lies over and again. That goes for these neo-con talk show hosts also. Sometimes I think they are even worse, while their White audiences eat it all up.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s standard election rhetoric to say you must punish your enemies at the polls (by getting out and voting), but when it&rsquo;s a call to arms for La Raza, and the opposition to amnesty are the whites, then it is not just an innocent phrase.</p>

		<p>Like the rest of our President&rsquo;s speeches this is nothing but hot air puffery. How is this to be done. How are we to incorporate twenty five or thirty million illegal Mexican aliens into citizenship. </p>
<p>While it is true that that there are some very hard working illegal Mexicans it is also true that there are very hard working illegal Mexicans working hard in crime and feeding off of the government. How are we expected to separate the two. What is your solution Mr. President?</p>
<p>His solution is of course to promise the illegals as much as possible without offending White America. And make no mistake, this question, the war question, the oil question, the race question, the economic question, all have one common core nexus: making money for Wall Street; and gang, this party is now about over! This country is functionally broke and this President is substantially responsible!</p>
<p>To put it very mildly, Howard Davidowitz is not a Goldwater Republican. Howard is neither young, physically attractive, nor charismatic. What he does of course is to tell the truth and tell it with passion. That I appreciate.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hySkSxRjR50" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hySkSxRjR50</a></p>
<p>The mid term elections are a week away.</p>
<p>Remember:</p>
<p>No more bailouts for Wall Street and big corporations if they fail they fail. No more money.</p>
<p>No more toleration for illegals, punish the American Corporations severely who hire them. I would re write the Constitution that if one or more of the parents of children born in this country are illegal then so are the children.</p>
<p>No more handouts to well fare mothers. Fathers who father illegitimate children either furnish support for their children or go to jail immediately. And I mean substantial support not some hundred dollar a month thing.   </p>
<p>No more Affirmative Action / Negative Discrimination. If you are going to beat me the playing field must be level!</p>
<p>Encourage mothers who have illegitimate children to be paid more initially for sterilization then for an illegitimate child.   </p>
<p>Encourage investment by not spending. Raise the interest rates! .</p>
<p>And no more shipping manufacturing overseas. That is killing America and it has to end and end soon! </p>

		<p> John PM, you have a good point there. I hadn&rsquo;t thought about Stalin and the Kulaks, but it&rsquo;s a pretty apt comparison. In other words, &#8220;You&rsquo;ve been successful, so you&rsquo;re the enemy!&#8221;<br>
That&rsquo;s essentially the point of view Obama takes.</p>
<p> No, I don&rsquo;t think he wants to slaughter us as Stalin did the Kulaks. But I think he has an ongoing, unreasoning grudge against his mother&rsquo;s race. It sticks out in some of his writings, in various actions he&rsquo;s taken, or NOT taken, in office, and in unguarded statements like the ones he made in the interview above.</p>

<p>This is a Nixon quote from a famous interview he did a few years before he died.  That he said that then, and that a Republican said it, rather tends to take the nasty implications out of the interpretation - unless one knows better.</p>
<p>And you and I do!</p>
<p>HIspanic immigrants, legal and illegal have been a scourge on American society, me directly and consequentially, as well as many I know, and relatives.  What this pronoucement means to me is that once they get their hands on dominant power, whites will be made criminals in their own country.  Everything will be taken from them legally and the jails will fill up with whites.</p>
<p>Sound too bizarre to be possible, think again!  Hispanics haven&rsquo;t nearly the scruples of a white liberal.</p>

		<p>I truly feel that the big O was absolutely convinced he was the Savior when he won the election; that the entire country was in the palm of his hand and would fall at his feet with every desire, whim and command he set forth. After two years he is realizing that surprising numbers of people were not affected by the magical Obama dust. He has now past the shock and awe stage of that realization and has entered the anger and retribution stage. The big O is a vile man with an enormous temper and an agenda for destruction of the American Republic and its majority white population. His spite, anger and true feelings about this country and its people are beginning to escape through the cracks in his facade.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure this and other choice extreme anti-white racist comments by Obama recently will come as a surprise to whites who voted for him.</p>
<p>They should not.  Obama did a terrible job of keeping the sicker aspects of his agenda under wraps.  Anyone with ten minutes and an internet connection could have seen dramatic examples of why he should not have been anything but a joke, not taken seriously at all.  Jeremiah Wright comes to mind.  Then there is Bill Ayers (with that Youtube clip of an FBI infiltrator letting people know that Ayer&rsquo;s group planned GENOCIDE against whites, as part of their agenda&hellip;..re-education camps&hellip;.then extermination camps&hellip;.serious stuff).  Oh yeah&hellip;.then there is the naked picture of Obama&rsquo;s mother, for all to see what HER character was like.</p>
<p>The problem is the nature of whites and politics.  This is what a typical democratic party function looks like.</p>

<p>Why should ILLEGAL ALIENS be supported by US taxpayers when most ILLEGALS are being paid under the table in cash.</p>
<p>A Dr. stops the bleeding first before beginning treatment!<br>
Secure our borders first THEN immigration reform.  By &#8220;reform&#8221; i mean get rid of anchor babies, protect US Citizens, NO welfare for ILLEGALS, no voting for ILLEGALS, no drivers licenses for ILLEGALS.</p>
<p>Anyone who wants to provide all these freebies to the ILLEGALS should be forced to form a collective pool for all those in favor.   </p>
<p>Bertha Lewis, CEO of ACORN in a speech ( see video on net ) tells exactly why immigration reform is needed&hellip;she says b/c there is a wave of MINORITIES becoming the MAJORITY and that&rsquo;s why reform is needed.  She&rsquo;s a racist and so is our President Obama.</p>

		<p>What bothers me the most, even though everything he does upsets me, is the fact he has not proven his eligibility for the office. As all know, he has not shown a long form birth certificate and has spent well over a million to conceal any type of personal information. This should boggle anyone&rsquo;s mind and set off alarm bells nationwide. We have a president changing the very nature of our society who has not proven he is qualified for the office. This is insane and illustrates the near treason of not only the Democrats but Republicans as well. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned this is the darkest period in our nation&rsquo;s history. God bless Josepth Farah for all he is doing to get at the truth about Obama, but Farah has so little help. Has there been any time in our nation&rsquo;s history when so-called leaders refuse to explore a president&rsquo;s egibility. What is going on? What has this country come to? Maybe someone can tell me. My guess is widespread corruption on a scale never before seen.<br>

		<p>From the article:</p>
<p><i>Sotelo asked the president to focus on immigration.</i></p>
<p>This idiot and former illegal alien preaches <i>amnesty for illegals</i> on his extremely popular, all-Spanish radio show every morning of every day.  He commands the attention and mau-mauing of POTUS, major political figures and the media who file into his Glendale station like lemmings to kiss his ring and vow support of amnesty for all.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the Al Sharpton of the Left Coast.</p>
<p><i>Sotelo is also one of the most televised radio personalities in the nation with regular appearances on national shows, and interviews on CNN, Fox News Channel, Larry King, MSNBC, Anderson Cooper, and Good Morning America, to name a few.</i></p>
<p>Neither POTUS nor any media outlet (especially the bolshevik LA Times) <b>ever</b> bother to ask us productive Californians how WE feel about granting &#8216;amnesty&rsquo; to millions of hispanics, who will immediately be (legally) eligible for an entire panoply of entitlements and services, including affirmative action, and the instant &#8216;right&rsquo; to import millions more of their uneducated, unskilled family members into the US in the name of &#8216;reunification.&rsquo;</p>
<p>According to ShadowStats.com, California&rsquo;s unemployment rate is NOT 12.5% as the government and media blast, but closer to 22% - 25%.</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/mg6z5" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/mg6z5</a></p>
<p>Yeah, great time to amnesty millions of unskilled illegals.</p>
<p>According to Wiki:</p>
<p><i>Eddie &#8216;Piolin&rsquo; Sotelo, with memories of crossing the border illegally in a car trunk two decades ago&hellip;  called for half a million people to march in Los Angeles in defense of immigrant rights in 2006.</i></p>
<p><i>It is very important to show people who may have doubts that we are very grateful to this great country because it is a blessing to be here in the United States.</i></p>
<p>Sure you&rsquo;re grateful, as you lead Los Angeles and California to bankruptcy and ruin.</p>

		<p>This coming out of Obama&rsquo;s mouth does not surprise me. #24.Shawn(the female), very eloquently, voiced my very thoughts. Hopefully, this comment he made might wake up some more white people.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because of the impending elections that I&rsquo;ve noticed a marked increase in the media&rsquo;s hate rhetoric against white people. I know this digresses a little, but I tuned into the Joy Behar show and could only take about five minutes of her and her guests (all three were white). They sat around talking about people like they do, and in that five minutes they must have called at least three to four people they were discussing &#8220;racists&#8221;. All white, of course! The minute you don&rsquo;t agree with these liberals (more like socialists) points of view, well, you must be a racist! I am so tired of that word. I really think people with her mentality would find it a lesser insult to be called murderers. I swear they sound psychotic to me. And acted so smug, you just wanted to drop kick them. You know, I never cared much for her. Now I can&rsquo;t stand her. I won&rsquo;t be tuning in again.<br>

		<p>If Obama is going to talk like Nixon, then hopefully he will walk like Nixon  &mdash;  right out of the White House!  While the latter probably thought of punishment as coming from his select circle, the former tries to enlist all Hispanics in his quest for revenge.  Obama is much more dangerously unstable than Nixon, whom my mother once feared might completely lose it on national television!  I can&rsquo;t imagine Nixon or any other former President siding with foreign nations against the United States.  Two more years of Obama is a truly disquieting situation to contemplate.</p>

		<p>I was actually an Obama supporter prior to the immigration debate. I thought he would be honest and keep the law and interest of the citizenry at the top of his list, boy was I wrong. Now he is forcing is ideological views upon our country where the majority simply want their borders secured. He acts as if they are just poor law abiding people that never did anything wrong, except, you know, invade. In the long term, an armed invasion and an unarmed invasion start to look similar, and this is exactly the case. He acts as if illegal aliens share our values of democracy, individualism, etc. No, they will simply vote in the same fashion they did in their home nation and wonder why their society keeps failing. This is simply political; democrats want votes, even if it means killing our nation in the process. Without strong assimilation, any chance of that populace not turning your country into a third world is gone.</p>
<p><br>
To this day, even my own friends hold on to the sweet lie that immigrants (both legal and illegal) of non-western background will embrace western culture and civilization, it is the same lie they use about blacks to help themselves sleep at night. Now, the only ones embracing Western culture and civilization are those who descend from it. The villages of my region, once the home of little Europes, are now suffering the same fate as the cities. </p>
<p> Though at Amren we have our disagreements, we are usually here because we conclude that though lies feel good, only the truth will save us. </p>
<p><br>
I actually used to be very liberal (in many ways I still am), I believed that amnesty was the way, that racism was &ldquo;evil&rdquo; and the only reason minorities were so terrible was because of the evil white man, and then, I grew a brain. I realized that what I stood for also stood for the destruction of our people, culture, and posterity and decided that my interest lies in our future, not a doomed utopian dream.</p>
<p><br>
Nothing has made me more disillusioned about our government and race relations than illegal immigration. <br>

Poster Bon #31 is correct to point out that   &mdash;   on top of all the objectionable things that the Dreamer in Chief said in this interview   &mdash;   the interviewer himself, is a Spanish-only speaker on a Spanish-only radio station.  &#8220;Piolin La Manana&#8221; (which translates as &#8220;Piolin in the Morning&#8221; and not, as you might expect, &#8220;Piolin might finally get around to doing it tomorrow&#8221;) is a chicano version of a &#8220;morning zoo&#8221; type shock jock. His goofy face is on goofy billboards all over LA. He&rsquo;s sort of  real-life version of The Simpsons&rsquo; &#8220;Bumblebee Man from Channel Ocho.&#8221; </p>
<p>Piolin not only doesn&rsquo;t speak English, he has boasted on-air that he has become a big success in Estados Unidos despite knowing only a handful of English words   &mdash;   like, according to him, &#8220;hamburger&#8221; and &#8220;McDonalds.&#8221; So in addition to actively promoting &#8220;amnistia&#8221;, Piolin also promotes the idea that Mexicans in El Norte have ABSOLUTELY NO NEED to learn El Ingles.</p>
<p>AmRen readers may recall that in the run-up to the Half-Million Mexican March on LA on May 1, 2006, there were two Spanish-radio DJs in LA who were telling their listeners different   &mdash;   well, slightly different   &mdash;   things about whether or not they should attend that May Day rally. One of them, who is Piolin&rsquo;s morning-drive rival (forget his name) was at least somewhat responsible about it, telling his listeners that yes, they should attend the demo   &mdash;   but not if they have to take the day off work as they might lose their jobs. The other DJ   &mdash;   that would be Piolin La Bumblee Man   &mdash;   was telling them yes, they should attend the demo EVEN IF it meant skipping work. Because, of course, the grand cause of La Reconquista is far more important than cleaning some gringo&rsquo;s swimming pool or ironing some gringa&rsquo;s clothes. </p>
<p>So, to sum up: Not only did a POTUS grant an interview to a shameless promoter of illegal immigration, of all the various Spanish-radio personalities to choose, he chose the one who is both the most radically anti-American, and also the most clownish. </p>

		<p>Four ways to look at this-</p>
<p>1.  Shove a bully&rsquo;s teeth down his throat and he is suddenly afraid to mouth off about &#8216;enemies&rsquo; when his _friends_ aren&rsquo;t strong enough to save him from looking like a fool.  This is particularly true for blacks who are very aggressive, when they are winning.  It may also apply to hispanics who begin to consider whether backing the wrong horse has exposed their agenda, dangerously.  We should exploit this, relentlessly, ruthlessly, tactfully and democratically.</p>
<p>2.  Fail to get what we want as a NATION of whites, secure in our southern borders as Mexico is increasingly becoming in hers.  And the sense of having defeated the white menace &#8216;where they live&rsquo; will grow to a point where nothing will hold back the pre-built inertia in a wave of intolerance driven hate crimes and group egotism.  Pushing the agenda even farther in the other direction.</p>
<p>3.  Fail to decisively either win or lose and racial emnity will rise to such levels (along with carefully timed external threats which we cannot defeat, economically if not militarily) that the literal business of America may simply stop.  People will be on the streets everywhere, blaming their &#8216;enemies&rsquo; for the weakness and inability to do anything in a descending economica crash dive.  It will be a very accurate illustration of &#8216;multiculturalism&rsquo; in action a a house not divided, but in competitive ownerships between squatters and natives.</p>
<p>4.  What can the President do, like a pouting child, to &#8216;backlash the issue&rsquo;??  How much can he block, obstruct, prolong or postpone to effectively destroy any execution of nationalist protectionism, not simply on immigration itself but in relation to everything from debt burden to social security payments (15 of the past 25 months, made with _borrowed cash_) to active defense in case of troubles with Iran or AfG?</p>
<p>What will happen in this election, barring a massive outbreak of &#8216;white racism&rsquo; or ethnic rioting against the perception of same, is already set.  What we need to be doing is looking ahead to the aftermath.</p>
<p>To the next step.</p>
<p>A.  Who do you call when you have &#8216;won&rsquo; and want the corrective measures to become a bipartisan group activity, so that _sealing the border_ is not only at the top of the to-do list but also has the least political barter corrupting it?  There has to be an &#8216;A-List&rsquo; of politicians who deserve a call or a commendation to plow through the red tape with.</p>
<p>B.  Who do you call in case social order breaks down and you need an affinity group to report crimes to and possibly seek shelter with in your state/district/county/precinct?  It could come to that people.  We should not be such rugged individualists that we fail to be a social network with our kin.  Fail to mark down the crimes lest they be &#8216;forgottent&rsquo; by official versions of events.</p>
<p>C.  What are the statistical breakdowns of States which have exceptionally liberal leanings in enforcing law and order on large ethnic demographics in their boundaries (or/and large sanctuary enclaves?).  Are their islands of honesty in those states?  Again, who do you hold up to a spotlight of higher dutied truth so that they both KNOW you expect this of them and have confidence that they will indeed, do their jobs?</p>
<p>B.  If it all fails, who can you put a word in with to &#8216;take the next step anyway&rsquo;.  To put the word out to local governors, mayors and the like so that the vocal MAJORITY of this nation&rsquo;s population do not lose their voice in furthering anti-immigrant legislation, locally, in a worst-case Federal abandonment of their duty to secure our borders?</p>
<p>IMO, the most dangerous time will come -after- the elections.  That is when the American people will learn exactly how united we stand with those whom we elect to rule over us.</p>
<p>I have a feeling, it will be an embarrassing and perhaps bloody disappointment when we see how little activist politics at the national level really does shift the viewpoint and what is done with it.</p>

<p><i>He is active in encouraging Latinos to take part in activism against anti-illegal immigrant legislation and sentiment, such as the 2006 Great American Boycott.</i></p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t you take him with you to the East Coast, Negroponte?  We already have enough &#8216;piolin&rsquo; and &#8216;cucuy&rsquo; types here on the Left Coast  &mdash;   foreign nationals who bleat out demands over the airwaves that the US open up its borders and welfare rolls to the entire Third World.</p>
<p>Oh, and one more thing about this &#8216;el cucuy&rsquo;:</p>
<p><i>El Cucuy, was booked Wednesday for investigation of making criminal threats during a New Year&rsquo;s Day dispute at his home.</i></p>
<p><i>When officers arrived, they found traces of blood in the house and on Almendares&rsquo; wife&hellip;. El Cucuy made threats against his wife and a police officer, and his 28-year-old son was bleeding from his chest. Officers also say they found a knife at the scene.</i></p>
<p>El Cucuy has moved to Albuquerque: &#8220;We are thrilled to welcome El Cucuy, one of the most popular and accomplished Spanish-language radio personalities ever, to the Albuquerque community!&#8221;</p>
