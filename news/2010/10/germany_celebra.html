<h1><a href="https://www.wtop.com/?sid=2040796&amp;nid=383">Germany Celebrates 20 Years of Reunification</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WTOP-FM (Washington, D.C.), October 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Germany&rsquo;s president celebrated the country&rsquo;s new-found national pride but also stressed that more needs to be done to integrate Muslim and other immigrants as he marked the 20th anniversary of reunification on Sunday.</p>
<p>Germany&rsquo;s post&#150;World War II division ended with reunification on Oct.&nbsp;3, 1990  &mdash;  less than 11 months after communist East Germany opened the Berlin Wall amid pressure from massive demonstrations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, a new self-confidence has grown in all of Germany, an uninhibited patriotism, an open commitment to our country, which is aware of its great responsibility for the past,&#8221; Wulff said in a speech in the western city of Bremen, which hosted this year&rsquo;s main anniversary event.</p>
<p>Germans have become more comfortable with displays of patriotism in recent years  &mdash;  illustrated notably by their enthusiastic flag-waving during the 2006 football World Cup, which Germany hosted.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Referring to a recent debate over difficulties in integrating immigrants, he [Wulff] said that Germany &#8220;must be open to those who come to us from all parts of the world  &mdash;  Germany needs them.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We need a clear position: an understanding of Germany that isn&rsquo;t confined to a passport, a family history or a belief,&#8221; he added. &#8220;There is no doubt that Christianity belongs to Germany; there is no doubt that Judaism belongs to Germany .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but Islam now also belongs to Germany.&#8221;</p>
<p>Germany has long been home to a large Turkish community.</p>

<p>Reducing Germany to a geographical location&hellip;. that is until the name is changed into something less white.  Where do these people think nations come from? <br>
A nation based on racial unity? No.<br>
A nation based on political unity? No.<br>
A nation based on cultural unity? No.<br>
A nation based on anything? No.<br>

<p>I am always amazed how these politicians and pundits screw around history and even the English language in projecting their Newspeak politics.  Using &#8220;belongs&#8221; in that context implies a founding ownership, which is ridiculous.  But even more subtle, but important is the idea that there were Jews in the Rhineland before there were even Christians, who actually did invade.  Muslims have no history in Europe, except for in Spain as conquerers/occupiers, France, where they were soon defeated, and during the long seige of Europe by the Turkish, Ottoman Empire (500 years long).  The way German and Europe capitualtes now and makes it seem virtuous and wise amazes and confounds me.  It is as if they WANT to die - right now.</p>

<p>I was expecting a dig at family history/ethnicity, but belief and passports as well, which are the basis for civic nationalists and cultural nationalists? If it&rsquo;s wrong to even be a civic nationalist in Germany, then what is Germany supposed to be? A void? </p>

Didn&rsquo;t the Obama say something similar the other day about us Americans?  That we don&rsquo;t need no stinkin borders and Mexico is our friend, blah blah blah&hellip;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The way German and Europe capitualtes now and makes it seem virtuous and wise amazes and confounds me. It is as if they WANT to die - right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could not agree more!</p>
<p>I know that we do not always see eye-to-eye on things all of the time, but here you are hitting the nail right on the head. Or put another way, what was the point of reuniting Germany at all? It is only a landmass after all, and could not both the east and west portions of the area in question have embraced Islam equally and independently of each other? If all the unified Germany is, is a collection of humanity corralled between the Rhein and Oder rivers it would all seem an expensive exercise and a folly as well.</p>
<p>Oddly, that was so important for nearly a half century on both sides, and now colonization by Muslims and every other crayon in the box is seen as optimal and fostering patriotism.</p>
<p>Insanity, thy name is diversity and of course, as always, God help us all!!!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m glad Europe is speaking out, but seems too late.  They aren&rsquo;t enough able-bodies white men (willing) to fight back.  The population of the non-whites and non-Christians is too sizeable a number to just kick them all out now.  Again, this fear of being called &#8216;racists&rsquo; has damaged us to oblivion.</p>

Who is &#8220;they&#8221;?  The white populations that live there?  Or the elites making those decisions.</p>
<p>This is an important question that has strong meaning rooted in what you just said.  It IS as if they want to die&hellip;.right now.</p>
<p>They means the elites.  They have lost the will to live and are taking the populations they lead over the cliff with themselves.  With the loss of that will, they have lost the right to lead.  Soon they won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Or put another way, after they commit suicide, someone else will make the decisions.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Muslims have no history in Europe, except for &hellip;the long seige of Europe by the Turkish, Ottoman Empire (500 years long).&#8221;<br>
   &mdash;   Whitplight<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>And it seems <i>that siege is not over yet,</i> &#8216;though we had mistakenly thought it was. It just went into a period of abeyance for a while.  For them, it was just a matter of time; Allah is patient, he could wait.   Now, the Turks are back at it again, reinforced with all their Moslem brethren, battering at the gates of Christendom [Sorry, Whiteplight; I had to say that]. And this time   &mdash;   much as I hate to admit it   &mdash;   they are making  startling headway by employing a demographic rather than military assault. They are farther into Europe than they ever got with armies. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same form of assault being used against us in North America, btw, and with equally effective results in both places. It seems to be the new, 21at century form of warfare and conquest   &mdash;   infiltration by cooks, nannies, gardners, maids, and laborers   &mdash;   while our bumbling old-fashioned military and politicians still count our strength in numbers of tanks, missiles, and battleships&hellip; all of which are totally ineffective as the Third World hordes slip across our borders nightly and give birth to anchor-babies in our hospitals <i>at our expense(!) </i> </p>
<p>We have truly become a nation of cuckoo birds. Oh, no   &mdash;   sorry, we are the foolish, trusting victims and THEY are the cuckoo birds laying their eggs in our nest. We are neglecting our own young (or failing to have any) while struggling to raise theirs. Meanwhile, our tratorious elites tell us that we should &#8220;celebrate&#8221; all this glorious diversity.  </p>
<p>Yeah. Sure we should!</p>

		<p>First Hitler, historical ignoramus, is the CEO of Germany. The man couldn&rsquo; count: Lot more Russians than Germans, Lot more US resources than Germany. Result? Germany destroyed,and tens of millions of dead and maimed Germans.</p>
<p>Now Germany has another genius President. Judaism is part of Germany so Islam is part of Germany? Which part and for how long?<br>
Jews were in Germany since Roman Empire. Turks in Germany since &#8216;50&rsquo;s, most later. Why? Because Germans, despite the lack of work opportunities until the sixties boom, didn&rsquo;t want to do manual labor. Maybe they were too used to enslaved Poles and Jews doing the work under the ever-efficient Nazis who brilliantly wiped out the most educated parts of their empire.<br>
The Muslims aren&rsquo;t the Jews and I don&rsquo;t think there is a Mahler or Mendelsohn, an Einstein or Nils Bohr among them. </p>
<p>All the Muslims will bequeath the Germans are a bunch of ugly mosques, destroyed art museums, universities and cathedrals which the Muslims won&rsquo;t tolerate, and millions of brown half-breed Germans whose alleigance will be to the Caliphate and  not to either the mythic Volk of Wagner or to the rational scientific acheivements of Germans from the seventeenth century to the beginning of the Nazi era.</p>
<p>I hope Germans who like classical music, jazz or even rock hide their flash drives and CDs.  The Muslim culture police will be on the prowl. Goebbels would actually smirk in admiration.</p>

		<p>I met two German men installing an expensive piece of equipment at a factory.  They were like sheep, afraid of their own shadow, afraid to say anything.  When I told them that everyone here was allowed to own a firearm and most of us had them, I thought the younger one was going to get up and run out of the room.  He looked terrified.   The Germans were beaten into submission and every year, the schoolchildren are marched through the holocaust museums and told how bad they are.  Do you think for one second that the muslims will allow the jews in that country to remain there once they have taken over?  More like they will have a great party beheading every infidel.  I&rsquo;m waiting for this to happen any day now.</p>

		<p>All Germany needs to do, along with Britain and France, is turn their Military on these foreign invaders, as in the days of Colonial conquest. These desert rats will run, as they ran when faced with overwhelming Military firepower in the Persian Gulf War.</p>
<p>Let these &#8220;people&#8221; know that the gloves are off, and they are going to be made short work of, and they will volunteer to leave as fast as possible. Let&rsquo;s face it, unless they are facing off with unarmed men, and women, children, or the elderly, they don&rsquo;t have a spine among them. They are a pack of cowards.</p>
<p>Germany&rsquo;s next step is to arrest all the traitors in Political Office.</p>

		<p>To John PM;</p>
<p>I appreciate your comments, even if, as you say, we do not see eye to eye.  I sincerely wish I could endorse the idea of ANY god coming to our aid, but gods, in particular, the Christian, Jewish one, is unreliably fickle, which makes me - along with other reasons, doubt the existence of such entities at all.  I sincerely believe that we are dooming ourselves outright if all we can do is pray to this God for his help.</p>
<p>But one thing I am sure that we are unitied, and strongly on, is the desire to see the white race preserved and strengthended in a way that retains our dignity and underlying cultural values.  The debate of how best to do that is partically what I am interested in here on the Amren posting board.  That is because I am certain that we cannot make the same tragic errors of the past.  Insisting on the same old, same old, will not work and as we know, repeating things that don&rsquo;t work again and again is a cardinal sign of insanity.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s to our mutual desires.  Let work on them intelligently.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>Whiteplight</p>

		<p>I am reading Carroll Quigley&rsquo;s &#8220;Tragedy and Hope&#8221; and in it he discusses the Turkish-German relationship -dating from before WW1- which was feared by Britain and Russia for geopolitical reasons. Britain wanted clear and total trade access to India and Iraq. Russia wanted a weak Turkey so as to allow it to expand southwards to the Black Sea, and for religious reasons wanted to remain strong as a protector of the Christians in the Caliphate. Anyway, the point is the diplomatic powers in Germany seem to have no problem with importing Turks today, either. A Muslim presence in Germany is deemed desirable, perhaps as a bartering chip for a stronger German presence in central Asia.<br>
Business as usual; the Great Game goes on.</p>

  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>So now the Germans are being demonized &#8220;because they didn&rsquo;t want to do manual labor&#8221;, so Jews and Poles had to do it for them?? Sounds like the garbage that is being thrown at us in this country, right? Now they say us Whites won&rsquo;t work in the fields so that is why the illegals are here &#8220;to do the job Americans won&rsquo;t do&#8221;  HOGWASH!   </p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s all this talk about Europe being dead? And what, exactly, is the US doing about the Mexican invasion? Not much as far as I can tell. Quite a few right-wing political groups over here are doing well - it&rsquo;s early days yet and still plenty of white people around.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Germans, despite the lack of work opportunities until the sixties boom, didn&rsquo;t want to do manual labor. Maybe they were too used to enslaved Poles and Jews doing the work&#8221; - Feller<br>

Such  ridiculous rubbish!  I am amazed that uninformed nonsense like  this gets printed here under the guise of intelligent discourse.<br>
 <br>
Has it occurrred to the writer of this drivel that Germany lost millions of its men, plus many civilians, in that terrible war?&hellip; Germany was left in ruins, and  (for the still living) there was a tremendous amount of rebuilding to be done.  Has anybody here seen pictures of Hamburg, Berlin, Frankfurt, Munich and many other Germany cities after the war?<br>
 <br>
As far as demonizing the Germans, and calling them weak, spineless, surrenderers, and virtually dead   &mdash;   Barry (UK) hits the mark in asking us just  what exactly is the US doing about our own Mexican invasion.   (Good point, Barry!) <br>
 <br>
At least we Americans are not a conquered, occupied people which the Germans can&rsquo;t claim to be; and we still have our guaranteed Freedom of Speech, which the Germans are not allowed.  What are we doing with all that freedom? Are we any better off?  Or are we going down the same hole that they are?  Whites are  now less than 50% in many large American cities and we have a black (and Moslem [?])  president. Germans are nowhere near 50% in any German city and they do not have a black or  Moslem president.  Who is actually worse off? <br>
