<h1>Civic, Community Leaders Tell How to Get a Black Mayor</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Wendell Hutson, Chicago Defender, October 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As several potential Black candidates ponder whether to run for mayor of Chicago, community activists, clergy and elected officials offer key ingredients needed for a Black candidate to win.</p>
<p>Facing the best shot in decades to push an agenda  &mdash;  including better solutions to violence, foreclosures and unemployment plaguing underserved Black neighborhoods  &mdash;  Black clergy, politicians and others have been meeting to try to throw their collective weight behind just one person, hoping the rest of the Black community follows their lead.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is important to get behind one candidate .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. who has a sense of urban reconstruction,&#8221; said the Rev. Jesse Jackson, one of several community leaders arranging meetings.</p>
<p>But others put less stock in the effort. At least one candidate has expressed impatience with the notion of waiting to be anointed. And there is no guarantee such a coalition can unite a community that is more independent than ever  &mdash;  or persuade other candidates to bow out after making its pick.</p>
<p>Chicago&rsquo;s Black community, 35 percent of the city&rsquo;s population, is increasingly diverse and not as tied to racial politics as in the past.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The top vote-getters in a straw poll of about 100 ministers taken Sept. 17 were state Sen. James Meeks, D-15th, also a prominent Black minister, and U.S. Rep. Danny Davis, D-7th, who also is Black, said the Rev. Ira Acree, pastor of Greater St. John Bible Church.</p>
<p>Runners-up included former U.S. Sen. Carol Moseley Braun and U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D-2nd, despite recent revelations of an affair and allegations he wanted a group of Indian businessmen to raise millions for ousted Gov. Rod Blagojevich in exchange for Jackson&rsquo;s appointment to Obama&rsquo;s old Senate seat.</p>
<p>But nobody is ruling out Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart, who is white and has made a name for himself with several actions viewed favorably in Black communities, including his prosecuting several people in a burial scandal at a historically Black cemetery. He came in fifth in the ministers&rsquo; poll, Acree said.</p>
<p>Acree acknowledged Emanuel could benefit in the Black community from his connection to Obama, who once worked as a community activist on the South Side and remains immensely popular there. But the former presidential aide isn&rsquo;t as popular among the city&rsquo;s Black leaders, who hope his entry in the race could help unify the community around someone else.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our job is to educate (voters) that Rahm is not the second coming of Barack Obama, that what they&rsquo;re thinking is based on irrational logic,&#8221; Acree said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Beyond money and registering voters, White [Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White] added that to launch a successful mayoral bid a Black candidate should have currently or previously held an elected office. By doing so it provides much needed experience to manage a large government such as Chicago, White said.</p>
<p>Additionally, a strong Black candidate should have unquestionable credibility and should have a track record as an effective community leader, he added.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And equally important for the next Black mayor is the ability to connect with churches.</p>
<p>&#8220;Precinct captains play an important role in who gets elected mayor because they are the ones who help register voters and serve as a liaison to churches,&#8221; the secretary of state explained.</p>
<p>Rev. Leon Finney, pastor of Metropolitan Apostolic Community Church on the South Side, has worked on several campaigns for Blacks  &mdash;  including Washington  &mdash;  and insists the number one ingredient for a Black to win the mayoral race is receiving a wide spectrum of ethnic votes.</p>
<p>&#8220;To win, a Black candidate would need to command a decent amount of votes from three of the four groups: organized labor, lakefront liberals, southwest voters (voters living in Southwest Side communities, such as Beverly), Catholics or Hispanics,&#8221; explained Finney.</p>

		<p> So what makes these people think that a black mayor is going to fix anything? The race of the mayor doesn&rsquo;t matter. Until blacks make major cultural changes nothing will get better.<br>
And the record of black mayors around the nation is not good. More than likely Chicago will become the next Detroit.</p>

Squadrista:</p>
<p>You are correct.</p>
<p>I listen to a local black talk show here in Buffalo. The host goes on and on about the need for more black elected officials. At the same time, he goes and and on about how inept and incompetent their black leadership is. </p>
<p>The host knows black leaders are inept and incompetent but their blackness trumps their abilities. Black communities might actually thrive under white leadership but as Milton said, &#8216;better to rule in Hell than to serve in Heaven&rsquo;.<br>

<p>Oh, but wait.  That&rsquo;d be Evil Racism, wouldn&rsquo;t it?<br>

		<p>Here in Philadelphia, former black Mayor John Street has come out against current black Mayor Michael Nutter for not being &#8220;black enough&#8221;. It&rsquo;s the Adrian Fenty treatment. As I mentioned in another post, ANY politician who does not explicitly glorify and provide aid to blacks or other minorities are racists. And if they&rsquo;re minorities themselves, they are traitors to the race.</p>

		<p>Chicago needs a Black mayor, an all Black City Counsel, an all Black police department, an all Black fire department and a big black wall around the whole place to keep them from being vandalized by those malicious White people who always sneak into Black neighborhoods and tear up the buildings and paint gang signs all over the place.</p>
<p>East St. Louis didn&rsquo;t have a wall around it and look what those sneaky Whites did to it.  </p>

<p>____________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Because these gullible Whites are of the belief that &#8216;salvation&rsquo; ONLY comes from blacks.<br>
My uncle is like that. My Mother is like that. My Sisters used to be like that until they become part of the &#8216;working world&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Whites today are attempting to enter the Heavens through acts mandated by their God projected to/for blacks.</p>
<p>For years the blacks have been calling us &#8216;Devils&rsquo;, so, in the White mind he/she must go to great lengths to &#8216;show&rsquo; that they are not.</p>
<p>They have no idea that they are embolding a Satanic Gene.</p>
<p>Their God wouldnt be very happy with them. And I would love to be in front of them as they are getting judged for their work. Their God is going to tell them &#8216;You fool! Get thee hence away from me, you evil doer&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Whites today (some) will fall down and lick the hands of their &#8216;chosen earthly gods&rsquo; in an all-out attempt to be accepted&hellip;.by the same very ones that seek their destruction and eradication.</p>
<p>How Gutless!!</p>

		<p>I live in Chicago and area described here as &#8220;Lakefront Liberal&#8221; - 2/3 of a mile away are areas that rival Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>The worst, most low life candidate in the bunch is Sen. James Meeks - certainly a &#8220;man of the people&#8221;, but his &#8220;people&#8221; are the lowest of the low, Black underclass. James Meeks would rival Marion Barry for the crown of the lowest, low life Black to ever be a big city mayor. So far, the media has treated him with kid gloves, the same as they did to crazy, hate Whitey Rev. Jeremiah Wright. The worst that has been written so far is that James Meeks has some issues with &#8220;gays&#8221;. It&rsquo;s often the case that the lowest, low life Black hate whitey &#8220;preachers&#8221; tend to shout out that White gays should be killed put in concentration camps, that sort of thing and then their &#8220;lakefront liberal&#8221; advisors like David Axelrod have to be called upon to make some spin that the Black &#8220;reverend&#8221; didn&rsquo;t really mean it and thinks gays are another oppressed minority like Blacks, Hispanics, Muslims and Jews.</p>
<p>:-)</p>
<p>Check out this video of James Meeks ranting and raving that White Mayor Daley is a slavemaster preventing Black children from getting a good education:</p>

		<p>  During the nineteen eighties black Democratic candidate Harold Washington ran against Republican Bernard Epton for Mayor of Chicago. I remember that one of Epton&rsquo;s campaign slogans was: &#8220;Epton before it&rsquo;s too late.&#8221; No one ever bothered to explain what this campaign slogan meant, and yet everyone in Chicago seemed to know exactly what it meant. Epton lost by only about 40,000 votes, and the scandal plagued administration of Harold Washington (who didn&rsquo;t file income tax returns for some years) was an unmitigated disaster for Chicago. Will it be &#8220;too late&#8221; again?</p>

<p>Epton ran a good campaign for someone who was not even given a chance and did come close. The man made some very telling points, was a good orator and had Washington on the defensive.</p>
<p>Sadly Epton passed away just a few years later. He was a good man.</p>
<p>And I recall too how the entire city was gearing up for riot IF WASHINGTON HAD NOT WON!</p>
<p>The Reverend Meeks wants to run too. He lives in South Holland and they have the one year residency rule in Chi. Well, the Rev says that his father does live in the city. That must make it OK then.</p>
<p>OH, who cares about dem dar&rsquo; rules!</p>
