<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>If current trends continue, some time in the middle of the next century the majority of this nation&rsquo;s inhabitants will be nonwhites. As has been shown repeatedly in the pages of American Renaissance, the presence of large numbers of nonwhites irrevocably changes the character of a school, neighborhood, city or state. Most whites find these changes so disagreeable that they simply move away. However, they can do this only because there are still many areas of the country that are overwhelmingly white. What will happen if whites become a minority?</p>
<p>Even before whites are reduced to a minority, the shift towards a largely nonwhite population will be felt in all areas of life. Taxes, crime, and disease will rise. &#8220;Reverse discrimination&#8221; will become the norm. Ever larger parts of the country will be essentially off limits to whites, even as government resorts to ever more draconian measures to enforce integration. Legislatures and schools dominated by nonwhites will rewrite our history, belittle our heritage, overturn our monuments, and abandon the cultural norms of our civilization. This is the great crisis of our times.</p>
<p>As the demographic tide shifts, it will be futile to defend &#8220;the canon&#8221; of Western literature or, in the South, to try to keep the Confederate flag flying over state houses. A faculty that is largely black and Hispanic will not teach Melville; nor will nonwhite legislators assemble beneath a banner they see as a symbol of white consciousness.</p>

</div><p>Although they indicate a mood of uneasiness in the country, Republican political victories will do nothing but reduce taxes in the short run  &mdash;  if that. In the long run, Republicans show no desire to stop the change in America&rsquo;s population. Of course, this great change renders mainstream political activity as we now know it virtually irrelevant, but to speak about race openly is to be banished from public discourse as a &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>

</table><p>On one point I do not wish to be misunderstood. Obviously, large numbers of blacks and Hispanics are not violent, of low IQ, or disinclined to work. The question is not whether all members of a racial group behave in a certain way, but whether enough do so to make the societies they create undesirable for whites. To answer this question in the affirmative is not, as leftist moralists would have us believe, an ethical flaw. At the simplest level, it is no more than the desire to secure an orderly and safe life for oneself and one&rsquo;s descendants.</p>
<p><b>Will Nonwhites Change?</b></p>
<p>The prevailing wisdom is that demographic change is not a problem because, with enough time and effort, nonwhites will become more like whites. Liberals, despite the clear evidence of the past forty years, still insist that if we give more money to minorities, discriminate against a few more whites, and suppress the cultural and historical memories of Euro-Americans, the races can be made interchangeable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Respectable&#8221; conservatives seem to think that the solution is to abolish welfare and establish more &#8220;enterprise zones,&#8221; where minorities can start businesses. The free market will then prevail and Republicans can find out whether shopping malls really do transform the soul of a people. (Perhaps they do, but certainly not for the better.)</p>
<p>It may be that the Christian Right and the &#8220;paleo-conservatives&#8221; have the least fanciful plan for minorities: A revival of religion, values, and manners from pre-1960s America  &mdash;  that is, from before the triumph of liberal decadence  &mdash;  will improve minority behavior. This is not completely wrong-headed. If our schools still used McGuffey Readers and taught virtue and discipline as they used to, all Americans would be very different.</p>
<p>However, there are three practical considerations that render this dream illusory. First, there is virtually no chance that inner-city schools will adopt the beliefs and practices of Middle America of the 1950s. Indeed, there is little reason to think that whites themselves have much interest in the ways of their ancestors. Second, how quickly could this revolution in values come about? What is the chance of a spiritual and moral reawakening in Harlem before nonwhites become a majority? Third, even if a return to traditional values radically reduced crime and poverty among nonwhites, it would not bridge the IQ gap. America would still face the prospect of entering the 21st century as a nation in which many people were incapable of functioning in a modern society.</p>

</table><p>At an even more fundamental level, are the symbols, myths, songs, memories, manners, and dreams of white America relevant to large numbers of blacks and Hispanics? <em>Should</em> they be? If not, we are back where we started; as the number of whites dwindles, Western Civilization disappears with them.</p>
<p><b>Minority Conservatives</b></p>
<p>It is important to note that there are black and Hispanic conservatives who are struggling to persuade their people to behave responsibly. They deserve the support of all fair-minded people. Their writings and movements should interest <cite>AR</cite> readers because they raise the question that all who believe in racial differences  &mdash;  be they genetic or deeply cultural  &mdash;  must answer honestly: How are we to approach those minorities who live and advocate lives of civility, who even acknowledge the European nature of our nation and live in deference to it?</p>
<p>We should support minority efforts at self-help. We should welcome black and Hispanic spokesmen who advocate self-reliance, religion, and the virtues of our civilization. Much could be accomplished if theirs were the dominant minority voices.</p>
<p>But even in the unlikely event of a triumph by minority conservatives, our attitude towards them should be no different from that toward Asian immigrants (who often show lower levels of crime and poverty than whites). We can welcome a small number of people of different races into this nation if they embrace our civilization, but we cannot allow the nation to lose its European identity. No people is obligated to abandon its national identity  &mdash;  in which race plays a significant part.</p>
<p>Any large group of nonwhites, no matter how well-intentioned, will eventually change our society in permanent ways. A nation dominated by blacks, Asians, or Hispanics, or one that is a majority-less farrago of races cannot help but be different from one that is dominated by whites. We have every right to prefer to live in a society of our own making, and we should not be compelled to open our nation and culture to the changes that large-scale racial incursion inevitably bring. For this reason, long-run demographic change demands a solution beyond anything that can be offered by minority conservatives.</p>
<p><b>Emigration or Separation?</b></p>
<p>What, then, are whites to do?</p>
<p>One undesirable possibility would be to abandon an increasingly third-world United States and return, <i>en masse</i> to Europe. This would assume that Europe had solved its own racial problems by strictly limiting nonwhite immigration. But would Europe want another 100 million citizens? In the waning days of white rule, the governments of Rhodesia and South Africa tried to prevent mass exodus by making it illegal to take assets out of the country. A black-Hispanic American government would probably do the same thing, turning most whites into penniless refugees.</p>

</div><p>Another possibility, which is nothing more than an extension of what most whites do now, is enclave existence. Today, whites pay a substantial premium to live in their own neighborhoods, free of blacks and Hispanics. They are also willing to pay for private schools for their children, in addition to the taxes they pay for public schools. For most whites, this is an acceptable exchange.</p>
<p>However, as the population shifts, as crime increases, and the government resorts to ever more ingenious methods of forced integration, enclaves will become precarious refuges. In South Africa, ever since the breakdown of apartheid, white neighborhoods have started hiring private security patrols. This is already happening in some American suburbs, and may become the norm in the future. Whites will develop various ways to barricade their neighborhoods against the &#8220;rising tide of color,&#8221; but will a nonwhite government allow whites to live separately and to protect themselves by private means? It is more likely that government will force &#8220;low-income housing&#8221; into all white areas; even if it does not, whites in their enclaves will still face oppressive taxation and systematic &#8220;affirmative&#8221; persecution.</p>
<p>What then remains? Separation. Whites should enter into serious dialogue with black and Hispanic nationalists who seek to establish racially based nations within the territory of the United States.</p>
<p>Opposition to this idea is most likely to come from whites. Many blacks and Hispanics already have a firmly developed racial consciousness, whether instinctual or sophisticated. Many have no interest in the study or practice of European culture, and this is neither wrong nor surprising. What remains to be achieved is a large-scale awakening of racial consciousness among whites, without which no serious dialogue can begin about the mechanics of separation.</p>
<p>Those who are daunted by the prospect of separation should once again consider the alternatives. Current trends will ineluctably reduce whites to minority status, and there is every sign that hostility to whites and to their culture only grows as nonwhites gain numbers and influence. Aside from emigration, the probable outcomes are some kind of violent resolution of racial conflicts or the reduction of whites to a persecuted minority in an increasingly lawless, third-world society. The former would be horrible for all people and the latter would be intolerable for the people whose ancestors built this nation.</p>
<p>At present, the idea of dividing the nation into racial zones seems impossible. (For fairness sake, in the interests of those who wish to continue the grand experiment, there could be a multiracial area. It would be interesting to see how many white liberals would want to live there.) However, there are still large parts of the country that are predominantly white. They could secede. This seems a wild prospect today, but as we move into the next century the burden of racial redistribution of wealth will become increasingly unbearable, and the spectacle of city after city following the path of Detroit and Washington will continue. Who is to say what the citizens of Montana or North Dakota may decide to do?</p>
<p>Indeed, it need not be whole states that secede. Groups of counties could declare independence from Washington. If these efforts were coordinated to occur at the same time their effect could be very powerful. How would the central government react? Given the size of the country and the notorious mismanagement of third world governments, it may not matter how it reacts.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this can happen without profound change in the hearts of whites and this does not now seem likely. Nevertheless, there is simmering unrest in the land. Given clear thinking and courageous leaders we may be able to move beyond the clichés that now govern us.</p>
<p><b>Cultural Secession Comes First</b></p>
<p>In order to lay the groundwork for political separation there must first be a recognition that the present government, media, schools and courts are at war with the beliefs and values of this civilization  &mdash;  indeed, with its very identity. Many Americans already feel this way, though not many have an articulate sense of the racial dimension of the problem. Some see the problem primarily in religious or cultural terms. They are nevertheless allies of any American who wishes for the survival of Western Civilization on this continent.</p>
<p>Taken all together, Americans who feel that the nation derailed after the 1950s are a significant percentage. They may even be a majority. Only for so long will they fail to see the racial aspect of the crisis. They may soon awake  &mdash;  but for now they sleep.</p>
<p>Furthermore, so much of our civilization&rsquo;s crisis goes beyond race. As Fr.&nbsp;Tacelli wondered in the previous issue of <cite>American Renaissance,</cite> even if whites were to separate from nonwhites would their culture then consist of the likes of Madonna?</p>
<p>In fact, our unwillingness to defend racial identity is linked to a severing of ties to our total civilizational identity as it manifests itself in religion, culture, family, and the norms and manners that Russell Kirk aptly termed, &#8220;the unbought graces of life.&#8221; These graces once imbued us with a sense of honor, dignity, courtesy, and piety. As these were abandoned in post World War II America, we lost a clear sense of who we are and how we should live. It was this breakdown that led to a weakening of racial awareness.</p>

</table><p>Until Western Man recovers his ability courageously to assert his own identity, with all that this affirmation would entail, there will be no racial defense. This will involve a personal, familial and eventually communal immersion in the faiths, culture, rituals and manners of the West. It will demand that we shun the vast cultural apparatus of our decadent times in all its manifestations. The first stage of a counter-revolution then, is to believe, live, and teach as men of the West.</p>
<p>As one who has long felt a deep attachment to the various forms of Western faith, culture, and race, the need for a program of peaceful, dignified racial separation seems axiomatic. At the very least one must secede personally from the current chaos of mind and soul, while encouraging communal and eventually political secession as well.</p>
<p><b>A Mature Racial Awareness</b></p>
<p>Moreover, any serious attempt at Euro-American advocacy must be divorced from the thuggish image so dear to the media. We must constantly affirm the moral foundations of racialism and emphasize that all races have the same right to self-determination.</p>
<p>It is vitally necessary that Euro-Americans leave behind the hierarchical racial forms of the past. Neither colonialism, segregation, apartheid or repatriation to Liberia are in our future. Whether these systems were evil, as the common wisdom has it, or merely attempts to cope with racial realities is now an academic question.</p>
<p>We must convey the message in word and deed that it is not those who seek the survival of all races who are &#8220;haters.&#8221; The haters are, instead, the multiracialists who would deny men the consolation and joy of freely expressing their racial and cultural identities. They are working to destroy those identities, physically and spiritually.</p>
<p>Separation is the only way to preserve the uniqueness of all races. Blacks and Hispanics would be free to govern, educate, and live according to their own standards rather than those of another race. They might also be more capable of lifting themselves up once the psychological crutch of &#8220;white racism&#8221; were removed.</p>
<p>Finally, if whites are to have a future, it lies only in the direction of amicable disengagement. This may seem fanciful today, but events will ensure that it is the only path to dignified survival.1</p>
<p>Religious men may believe that the great crisis of Western Man is his loss of faith. This is true insofar as loss of faith affects our prospects for Eternity and undermines morality. However, the decline of civility, the eclipse of white culture, and the dwindling numbers of Euro-Americans represent threats that, unlike loss of faith, cannot be reversed through repentance.2</p>
<p>I am, nevertheless, haunted by the image of nonwhite conservatives. I feel constrained to add that racial separation need not be absolute, but might allow exceptions according to exacting standards.</p>

		<p>Writing in 1995 Rabbi Mayer Schiller assumes that the crime rate will increase.  According to FBI, Uniform Crime Reports, in 1995 the crime rate was 5,274.9 offenses per 100,000 inhabitants.  This was a decline from 1980, when it was 5,950.0 per 100,000 inhabitants.  In 2009 it was a much lower 3,465.5 per 100,000 inhabitants.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm</a> <br>
 <br>
A major reason for the decline has been the increase in the prison population.  According to the Justice Policy Institute of U.S. Department of Justice Data, in 1980 there were 315,974 convicts in American prisons.  By 2000 that had grown to 1,428,187.  Contrary to liberal dogma, punishment works.<br>
 <br>
Also, in their book Freakonomics, Stephen Dubner and Steven Levitt argue that the Roe v. Wade decision of 1973 began to reduce the crime rate in the early 1990s because potential criminals were disproportionately destroyed in the womb.<br>
 <br>
Because the crime rate is declining, Rabbi Mayer Schiller&rsquo;s plans for &#8220;dividing the nation into racial zones,&#8221; are unnecessary.  All we need to do is to keep doing what we have been doing since 1980.  First, we should continue to expand the prison population.  Second, we should do more to restrict immigration.  Third we should phase out affirmative action, forced school busing, and Aid to Families with Dependent Children.  Fourth, we should keep abortion legal.  <br>
 <br>
I used to oppose Roe v. Wade.  After reading Freakonomics, I wish the blacks who mugged me had been aborted.   </p>

Neither colonialism, segregation, apartheid or repatriation to Liberia are in our future. Whether these systems were evil, as the common wisdom has it, or merely attempts to cope with racial realities is now an academic question.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;ve always regarded a strict hierarchy as the best solution to racial problems.  Africa under imperialism was so much better than it is now, the South with segregation was better.  Blacks just seem to be better off when they are under the authority of whites.  Of course abuses can occur under this system but they are not the norm, and overall it is much better for everyone.  I strongly object to this idea of &#8220;separation.&#8221;  I don&rsquo;t see a dis-United States, with a section for each race, as being much better than a United States where whites are a plurality.  It just doesn&rsquo;t appeal to me.  Technically speaking, I suppose it would be better for us, and certainly much easier, but it just seems so defeatist to me.  We still make up around two-thirds of America&rsquo;s population, so why are we giving up now?  I sense some great change about to happen in our nation;s way of thinking, and a lot of white people all over the world seem to be waking up.  If non-white immigration is stopped, non-citizen minorities are repatriated, and something is done about the appalling minority birthrates, our nation will be saved, without any need for complete separation of the races on a geographic basis.</p>
<p>What exactly are you suggesting, anyway?  That our great cities like New York and Chicago go to multiculturalists?  The proud South goes to blacks?  The great state of Arizona, which has lead the fight against liberalism these past few months, becomes part of a new Hispanic nation of Aztlan?  I don&rsquo;t want whites to have to make a mass exodus out of some of our nation&rsquo;s greatest regions.  There&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m moving to Kansas just so some minority can take my (theoretical) apartment in Manhattan, or my stately Southern manor in Charleston.  There&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;d abandon a sprawling fruit orchard in the San Joaquin Valley so I can go live with a bunch of Mormons in Utah.  No way I&rsquo;d leave a beautiful Victorian in San Francisco for a beet farm in North Dakota.</p>
<p>It is true, and we all acknowledge it here, that a nation is more than just a set of boundaries.  Race is part of what makes a nation what it is.  But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that our borders are meaningless, that the land our ancestors fought and died for should be given away gleefully, simply to solve the demographic problem that is sweeping our nation without any real effort into it.</p>

		<p>In my earlier comment, #1 I neglected to document my assertion that the prison population has grown exponentially. Here is my source:<br>
<a href="/issues/lawenforcement/punishment.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.jacksonprogressive.com/issues/lawenforcement/punishment.pdf</a> <br>
 <br>
Between 1960 and 1970 the prison population declined from 212,953 to 196,429. During this time the crime rate per 100,000 inhabitants grew from 1,887.2 to 3,984.5.  <br>
 <br>
During the 1960&rsquo;s liberals had their chance to demonstrate the truth of their theories about &#8220;root causes of crime,&#8221; and all that. Poverty declined because of a broadly based economic expansion and War on Poverty programs. Nevertheless, the United States suffered a crime wave and five years of black ghetto rioting.  <br>
 <br>
Since 1980 the crime rate has declined despite an increase in the degree and severity of poverty. Poverty has increased because of the decline in the manufacturing sector, and reductions in welfare spending. The decline in crime has continued during our economic downturn.<br>
 <br>
This is worth pointing out because those on the left continue to maintain that the growth in the prison population has failed to deter crime.<br>
 <br>
It is also worth pointing out because those on the right often seem to have forgotten nothing and learned nothing since the 1970s. Yes the economy is a mess. No, I don&rsquo;t think the Republicans would be better stewards. Nevertheless, the crime rate is declining because of Republican policies regarding the criminal justice system.  </p>

		<p>This sounds defeatist to me.  Don&rsquo;t people realize that this non-white population is growing because of legal and illegal immigration?  I still think a political solution is possible without breaking up the US into different regions.  We make up 75 percent of the electorate and the White electorate will probably expand to 80 percent after this election with so many people not voting the past few elections.  Do you know there&rsquo;s a dirty little secret out there that there&rsquo;s millions of green card holders in this country that don&rsquo;t have US citizenship and that their green cards don&rsquo;t have to be renewed?  You take these people out of the population and start enforcing the deportation of illegals and the White demographic is restored to early 1980s percentages. That only leaves the pesky dysfunctional black population to deal with.  We have the upper hand seeing is how most of them are dependent on White tax dollars in one form or another. </p>

		<p>Countries never last forever.  Racial, religious and cultural factors always lead to breakup sooner or later.  There is no one who can dispute this and I challenge anyone to try.</p>
<p>I do believe this once great nation will fragment into warring states not unlike the three kingdoms era of warring states in ancient china.</p>
<p>My worry is the nukes.  Who will control them, will a <br>
&#8216;la raza&rsquo; homeland have nukes?  Can you imagine?  Will a voodoo kingdom have them?  At the least they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to maintain them properly and will probably accidentally detonate them on themselves.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not worried about other military hardware like jets, tanks, ships, etc, because only whites will be able to maintain them and keep them running.</p>
<p>How would you divide the nation?  Can you imagine mexican gangs as full fledged militias or armies, invading and pillaging?  What about the pathetic refugee blacks who will constantly be sneaking in?  Latinos are everywhere now.  How would you make contiguous nations?  </p>
<p>Would you have 50 new countries?  China will be the next superpower then, and they WILL invade this continent.  How would you keep the liberals out, because even if you made a white state, inner liberals will ruin that in time, and I wouldn&rsquo;t want to see a dictatorship. So many issues.  </p>

		<p>From the original article: &#8220;I am, nevertheless, haunted by the image of nonwhite conservatives. I feel constrained to add that racial separation need not be absolute, but might allow exceptions according to exacting standards.&#8221; This is where the author and those who think like him fail. The end result of non-absolute separation leads to conditional immigration which overtime, leads to the exact same issues we are facing now.  Otherwise, why not leave the nonwhite conservatives in their own nations where they can build up their own conservative values?</p>

		<p>2-rjf101: In response to some of your comments and questions:</p>
<p>As for a Disunited States seeming to be defeatist in nature: I would agree, in that I believe the White culture and racial dominance of America has been defeated. It will take time for the final result to occur, but I believe it is now inevitable.</p>
<p>&#8220;If non-white immigration is stopped, non-citizen minorities are repatriated, and something is done about the appalling minority birthrates, our nation will be saved&hellip;&#8221; - I guess my question here would be, when? I just do not see White America as having the will to enforce such policy.  Even in the event of racial separation, liberal Whites and many non-racially sensitive Whites will not join a new White Nation.</p>
<p>&#8220;No way I&rsquo;d leave a beautiful Victorian in San Francisco for a beet farm in North Dakota.&#8221; (and other statements): You won&rsquo;t have to. If there is a geographical racial separation, only those who -want- to join such a Nation will move. Whites left in the South or Southwest (or wherever) will eventually die out, be murdered out, or otherwise be disposessed over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;that the land our ancestors fought and died for should be given away gleefully&hellip;&#8221;: But it was. Not by all, but by the few in power who were not racially aware.  At this point, it now becomes a matter of survival.  I can see a future where our descendants are using The Alamo, California, and the entire South as examples of reasons for not allowing non-similiar immigration (or importation of labor).  In fact, these same areas are used now for the exact same reason, but by the other cultures that were displaced by Whites.</p>

		<p>I read of a distasteful but more likely outcome in a book that can no longer be mentioned in our timid society. </p>
<p>If the people with whom we would have to negotiate a peaceful separation were intelligent and reasonable enough to accomplish that end, then there would be no reason to separate from them. The reality is that those who speak for Blacks and Hispanics are neither intelligent nor reasonable, and I cannot envision a peaceful divide from the selfish, lazy and criminal element of the populations they represent.</p>
<p>Another great obstacle to peaceful separation is that many Americans feel as I do in that there will be no consensus in any decision to give away any neighborhood, city, county or state that was fought for and created by men of the bloodlines from which we descended. Much of what was once ours has already been handed over to the undeserving by the unauthorized. </p>
<p>If there are to be Black and Hispanic homelands, they must be carved out of wild, unpopulated areas as our White forefathers carved out theirs. Blacks and Hispanics will not march off into rough country to create a land of their own unless they are strongly encouraged by Whites, so many terrible battles will be recorded in the history books which the generations who come after us will read.</p>
<p>Whether Whites want it or not, we are headed to a time of great social upheaval and much bleeding and dying. There will be no peace for those who would choose to remain uninvolved. If you are getting punched in the head, you are in a fight even if you don&rsquo;t fight back. Eventually you WILL fight back.</p>
<p>I too am worried about the civilized, hard-working Blacks and Hispanics who would remain with the majority of Whites if the nation were to peacefully divide along idealogical rather than racial lines. I can only hope that accommodations and exceptions can be made for those good people on a regional or local level. </p>

		<p>Its tragic to hear the possible future of America for<br>
European Americans and the &#8220;liberal&#8221; government they now have to pretend to support .Most of the problems you face as a group now are slowly creeping into European society which as usual seems to be covered up due to political correctness.</p>
<p>The Nationalist groups in Europe for example although extreme seem to be constantly persecuted and threatened by government depatments at taxpayers expense.<br>
Which of course is entirely undemocratic.</p>
<p>One interesting point is that most Europeans, given the chance would emigrate to the USA en masse.<br>
It seems very difficult for Europeans to obtain a green card or visa or any other type of entry requirement to the US.</p>
<p>European settlers and then independence helped to shape America into a great country given a equal chance with other US immigrants they could give it much needed boost .</p>

		<p>Excellent analysis of the situation for whites in America.</p>
<p>Oh, and what are white people hearing come out of the mouths of greasy rats like Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin?  Well, at the recent &#8216;rally&rsquo; where a couple hundred thousand white people showed up to listen to these two Judas Goats speak, both Beck and Palin spoke not a single word of intellectually savvy wisdom to their doting, toe kissing crowd of clueless white people.   No, instead - they both used the occasion to tell those clueless white sheep that they needed to genuflect at the feet of a known Communist, a known plagiarist, a known Marxist-Socialist subversive, and a known fornicator and abuser of white prostitutes - Martin Luther King, Jr.   That&rsquo;s right.   A subversive black communist - who&rsquo;s FBI file was so filled with hard evidence of this man&rsquo;s lack of any moral character whatsoever, so filled with hard evidence of his intimate ties to a known Communist subversive by the name of Stanley David Levinson (just google this fellow&rsquo;s name, and peruse the links that document his Communist activities) - that his FBI file had to be &#8216;sealed&rsquo; for 25 or so years, in order for the hostile ruling elites who&rsquo;ve hijacked this nation to be able to prop him up as some sort of moral paragon?   </p>
<p>Oh, but wait a minute!   Doesn&rsquo;t this Judas Goat named Glenn Beck rant all the time about the evils of Communism?  Yes, I&rsquo;ve heard he does - so, isn&rsquo;t it curious that this overpaid Judas Goat would turn around and tell his 99.99% WHITE audience that MLK was who they ought to worship, instead of say, another far more qualified White hero who was astronomically more deserving, say a man like General Robert E. Lee?     Strange, is it not?   Smells really fishy to me.  What exactly are Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin really up to?   </p>
<p>Well, whatever it is - it isn&rsquo;t good for White European people in this nation.   In fact, I think it would be safe to say that those two creatures are peddling Hemlock for our race of humans.     And, anyone who&rsquo;s white who drinks the hemlock that Beck and Palin are serving up to them - isn&rsquo;t a very bright or educated individual.</p>
<p>Message to white people:   Heads out of your hind-parts.   Knock the rust off your brains, kill your televisions, engage your brains and start using your critical thinking skills again.  Stop allowing Judas Goats to snooker you into following them to your slaughter!       <br>

		<p>Separation-<i>ism</i> will be the way going forward.  It will be a process, not an event.  Long-term it&rsquo;s simply imperative:  Without separation the races will merge (they already <i>are</i>) and whites will become extinct (just because you won&rsquo;t mix doesn&rsquo;t mean other whites won&rsquo;t   &mdash;   they are and will, rapidly).  </p>

<p>Yes, there are many issues.  But by placing race front and center most (but not all) of those issues essentially (but not completely) resolve themselves.  As for &#8220;China will invade!&#8221; hysteria, that&rsquo;s totally alarmist. Plenty of larger countries exist side-by-side with small, weak neighbors without invading them. </p>

		<p>And just as bad is the voting trends. Whites now are the minority (white women, in many cases, are enticed to vote for Affirmative Action and other bribes the democrooks offer).  So whites are already feeling the effects of a majority that votes against white interest.  ONce the transition is complete those enticements for white women will be removed and by the Democrooks.</p>

		<p>Peaceful disengagement will not work.  Whites have been trying such a concept for 40 years  &mdash;  we move, disengage from black culture, but inevitiably blacks follow.  Whites, unlike Hispanics, have no resistance to this trend.  </p>
<p>Blacks could have segregation if they want it.  They could have a de facto separate nation if they wanted it.  Whites wouldn&rsquo;t mind that.  But for all their bluster they do not want that.  Because they have too much to gain by moving into white neighborhoods and then harrassing whites and cajoling them into offering them special privileges (ie jobs, welfare, better schools, unlimited sympathy, Affirmative Action, etc).  </p>
<p>Hispanics kicked blacks out of South Central LA.  They did it with force and violence, and they now dominate much of LA and Southern California.  Where did those blacks relocate to?  My guess is they moved to cities with white population.  They certainly did not move to other Hispanic Neighborhoods and they most likely did not move to Detroit.</p>
<p>Anyone that is realistic  in their outlook knows we are no longer living in a melting pot (that only worked with integrating Europeans) today we live in a pressure cooker.</p>

<p>I always keep reading things about whites are on the edge. The Angry White Male of the 80s, how whites were having enough of it in the 90s and now we&rsquo;re once again &#8220;on the brink&#8221;. I&rsquo;m not sure whites en masse will do it.

		<p>Self-segregation or de-facto segregation already exists. At least as far as blacks are concerned. Most whites live in &#8216;covenant&rsquo; communities. Blacks dont live in those neighbourhoods by choice (obviously im referring to those who could otherwise afford to as opposed to the section 8 ghetto blacks) because all the rules (some of which although well meaning are quite petty) remind them of the &#8216;Jim Crow&rsquo; south. Latinos and Asians however do live alongside whites. Many Whites along with Latinos and Asians live in Private Gated communities. Those Blacks (who could otherwise afford to) dont live in those neighbourhoods because as mentioned before such neighbourhoods remind them of the south. Lastly in terms of schooling de-facto segregation exists because the public schools are predominantly black and Latino in neighbourhoods with large numbers of blacks. Whites and Asians have fled to private schools where their children will get an education (as opposed to learning about gangs, riots, stabbing, rapes, and shooting &#8216;hoops&rsquo;).</p>
<p>So for all the Segregationists (Segregation forever! brigade) at least as far as Housing and Schools are concerned, Segregation between blacks and whites is the norm. Although not between Whites and Asians and Latinos. If any posters here disagree and rush to tell me that have black neighbours then you must live in a poor neighbourhood, and that is YOUR problem!</p>
<p>I think segregation sucks. I want Seperation. The trouble is that segregationists are too comfortable with the de facto situation and too cowardly to change it. They pretend to be white nationalists but in reality undermine everything white nationalism stands for.</p>

		<p>   My elderly dad just had to move out of his house he had lived in for nearly 40 years . I wouldn&rsquo;t classify it as a poor neighborhood . It was a nice working class neighborhood . The blacks have taken over the neighborhood . What isn&rsquo;t section 8 is relatively well heeled blacks who now get all of the jobs, corporate and government . They rule, it&rsquo;s taken them 50 years to get there but they now rule . White CEOs just turn a blind eye to the plight of their struggling brethren . Perhaps they have to, I do not know but that is the lay of the land in the south . His house is now on the market for half of what it is worth . He&rsquo;s moved into a gated neighborhood . Of course I dare not say anything because he had to do something, but that neighborhood is also doomed . There&rsquo;s a black neighborhood right across the street from it . It&rsquo;s hopeless . I predicted several years ago on Amren that eventually the Feds would try to prevent Southerners especially, from leaving their home states or even counties . At the time I received a certain amount of chastisement for my theories . I still stand by what I said then . I believe it is coming, possibly for other regions of the U.S. Moving across state lines or even county lines will become as complicated as crossing international borders . You hear liberals refer to state lines as &#8220;borders&#8221; all the time now . This was unheard of when I was growing up . It would have gotten you a D minus in high school . If our current President is re-elected, I believe he will be - by whatever means necessary, I look for him to institute marshal law . I hope I am wrong but I just have a gut feeling . There&rsquo;s something big coming our way and it is not going to be pleasant . Perhaps at the very least, an American version of Nottingham ? </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a very callous comment.  Gee, thanks.  Face it, more and more whites will be having that problem. </p>
<p>So far, the only thing you have used to separate yourself from blacks is money. That situation won&rsquo;t last. As Affirmative Action progresses, and scholarships and diplomas are handed out indiscriminately to undeserving &#8220;minorities&#8221;, and employment quotas are enforced, those same &#8220;minorities&#8221; will in another generation have all the good jobs, the well-paying jobs, and you  (or your grandchildren) will be the ones left living in a poor neighborhood and unable to escape from it (except by marrying a black).  </p>
<p>So then that will be YOUR problem!  (Let&rsquo;s see how YOU like it.) And don&rsquo;t expect any more sympathy than you gave to poor whites now. You&rsquo;ll have what you deserve.</p>

The lack of racial solidarity and selfish indifference of well-off  whites to the plight of other whites is largely the reason why we have this problem to begin with. Our self-serving &#8220;elites&#8221; have been abandoning us and selling us out for decades   &mdash;   in order to save themselves from the integration that they push on the rest of us.

		<p>@#20, no actually on the contrary rugged Individualism is what built America and makes the white race strong and different from the others. Your collectivist mindset by contrast belongs in Communist China, Vietnam and North Korea.</p>
<p>The &#8216;elites&rsquo; you speak of existed in the South and also in South Africa. They were very happy with segregation. Blacks raised their children, cleaned inside and outside their houses, cooked and served their meals and tended to their gardens. I oppose this laziness and call for complete seperation. We dont need pampering by blacks. We dont need physical contact with them. Segregationists on the other hand do, for some strange &#8216;paternal&rsquo; reason. </p>
<p>Oh and by the way, im not the welfare officer. I dont see why my income should be redistributed to &#8216;help&rsquo; anyone, black or white. Thats why im a Conservative white nationalist as opposed to a National Socialist. </p>

		<p>     My Franklin dictionary defines elitism as &#8221; rule or advocacy of by an elite .&#8221; My Oxford Dictionary defines elitism as &#8221; dominance by a select group .&#8221; And elite as,&#8221;choice part of a body or group.&#8221; In that respect, Southerners and South Africans are elitist . Both groups left their homes in Europe and cut working governments and economies out of pure wilderness and made their homes there in the 1600s . In the case of Southerners, they had been there a good while before Plymouth Rock . I would hardly define either group as lazy .  That they both utilized the workforce at hand, was a phase that the pre-industrialized world just about had to pass through . In the case of Southerners-bondsmen who were brought here first by Europeans (especially the British) and then New Englanders, and in the case of the South Africans, aborigines- many who migrated there because even the African understood where the European was, there would also be prosperity . The elitist the other posters are referring to are the liberals in their ivory towers who want to control ever facet of our lives right down the food we eat and the air we breath . A big difference there . And it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt for us to do a case study of Red China and her careful blend of socialism and capitalism that seems to be kicking our collective derrieres right now . Only in the interest of trying to get our nation back on top . Take defeat and learn from it . The much vaulted &#8220;service based economy,&#8221; first hawked by liberals in the early eighties has been a miserable failure . We&rsquo;ve got to get our manufacturing base back . I agree with separation, perhaps even total separation . But I do not think it is imperative or wise that it be malicious and vindictive .   </p>
