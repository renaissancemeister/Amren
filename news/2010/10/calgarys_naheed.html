<h1>Calgary&rsquo;s Naheed Nenshi Becomes Canada&rsquo;s First Muslim Mayor</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Josh Wingrove, Globe and Mail (Toronto), October 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>If you don&rsquo;t know the name Naheed Nenshi, take note.</p>
<p>A grassroots campaign driven by volunteers has delivered Canada its first Muslim mayor  &mdash;  Mr. Nenshi, who scored a staggering win in Calgary&rsquo;s mayor&rsquo;s race Monday.</p>
<p>He defeated two better-funded candidates, including one backed by Stephen Harper&rsquo;s campaign team, and saw his support surge in the final few weeks. To say Mr. Nenshi&rsquo;s campaign was austere is understatement  &mdash;  he delivered his speech in a basement that was donated by a supporter at the last second.</p>
<p>The 38-year-old Mr. Nenshi survived a smear campaign and a telephone failure in the crucial final days and hours, before running away with what was to be a close vote. His candidacy was branded the &#8220;Purple Revolution,&#8221; named for his campaign colour and driven by a broad demographic that included strong youth support. He achieved what many observers thought impossible  &mdash;  a wonkish, even dorky, academic and visible minority elected to the helm of what is often called Canada&rsquo;s most conservative city after a campaign driven by charisma and sheer determination.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today Calgary is a different place than it was yesterday. A better place,&#8221; Mr. Nenshi said in a speech to his supporters.</p>
<p>Shortly after 10 p.m. local time, CTV declared him the winner. Global News followed suit an hour later.</p>
<p>When returns finally showed him in the lead  &mdash;  one he would not relinquish  &mdash;  a bar where Mr. Nenshi was watching results erupted in a deafening cheer.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bar was amazing,&#8221; a grinning Mr. Nenshi told The Globe and Mail as he walked into his campaign office. &#8220;If you have never heard the sound of a city collectively losing its mind, you needed to be in that bar.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said his win &#8220;means we&rsquo;ve got a lot of work to do, starting tomorrow [Tuesday],&#8221; and that he was &#8220;a little&#8221; surprised with how many votes he received.</p>
<p>&#8220;It means people heard my message,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>His win also proves that the Internet is a key tool in politics and does indeed deliver support  &mdash;  Mr. Nenshi had far more Facebook friends than either of his main competitors, who themselves dismissed that support, saying it wouldn&rsquo;t translate into actual votes.</p>
<p>But Mr. Nenshi had 39 per cent of the vote with 229 of 241 polls reporting, followed closely by alderman Ric McIver with 32 per cent and former CTV anchor Barb Higgins with 26 per cent. Ms. Higgins raced to an early lead before her numbers collapsed, while Mr. Nenshi started slow and then spiked.</p>
<p>Mr. McIver, meanwhile, had campaigned essentially since the last election in 2007, preparing to challenge outgoing Mayor Dave Bronconnier, a bitter rival. When Mr. Bronconnier elected not to run, Mr. McIver became the race&rsquo;s de facto front-runner, with a significant war-chest and plenty of backing among Calgary&rsquo;s conservatives.</p>
<p>Ms. Higgins entered the race late with little experience but significant name recognition, and tried to position herself as a moderate able to build consensus on city council, which has been bitterly divided for the past three-year term largely because of Mr. Bronconnier and Mr. McIver. Had Ms. Higgins won, she would have been Calgary&rsquo;s first female mayor. However, critics insisted that she didn&rsquo;t have the experience to take the top job, unlike Mr. McIver the alderman and Mr. Nenshi, a veteran observer of city hall.</p>
<p>Voter turnout was high, with early returns suggesting it could reach 50 per cent, well higher than the 33 per cent turnout in 2007.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But no race was as compelling as Calgary&rsquo;s. The prospect of Mr. Nenshi as mayor signalled a shift in the province, observers said. &#8220;Calgary is often misperceived. It&rsquo;s no longer a ranching and oil community only. It&rsquo;s young, it&rsquo;s vibrant, it&rsquo;s cosmopolitan and global,&#8221; said David Taras, a veteran political observer in the city and the Ralph Klein Chair in Media Studies at Mount Royal University.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s almost a movement, which is incredible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lisa Young, a political scientist at the University of Calgary, said the race was supposed to be between Ms. Higgins and Mr. McIver, but Mr. Nenshi&rsquo;s &#8220;dogged&#8221; work drove his support.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has stolen this campaign. He&rsquo;s gone from being an interesting also-ran to the guy setting the agenda in this campaign,&rsquo;&#8221; Prof. Young said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s just had this exceptional momentum to it. It&rsquo;s gone from being the campaign that people who are maybe to the centre-left, and are a bit more of the urbanist types are supporting, to having mainstream appeal. He was endorsed by the Calgary Sun of all things, which is exceptional.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Nenshi was joined by his family  &mdash;  a sister, her husband, two children and his parents  &mdash;  with whom he is very close. He is a success story for new Canadians. Mr. Nenshi&rsquo;s parents emigrated to Canada from Tanzania when his mother, Nury Nenshi, was pregnant with Naheed. They settled in Toronto before moving to Calgary, where Naheed grew up. He attended Harvard University, and at the tender age of 22 was hired by McKinsey and Company, one of the world&rsquo;s top consulting firms. After about eight years at the company, he returned to Calgary to be with his ailing father. He has since worked for the United Nations, started his own business, and became a professor at Mount Royal University. He was a frequent commentator and columnist with a keen eye on civic affairs; this spring, he decided to throw his hat in.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, the Purple Army was never about winning an election  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s a good thing. It was about revitalizing the level of conversation in the city. It was about talking to the person next to you on the bus, it was about taking an extra minute with the cashier at Safeway, and now it is about doing the work to build a better Calgary that we all dream of,&#8221; Mr. Nenshi told his supporters Monday night.</p>
<p>Several pundits quietly predicted a Nenshi win early Monday, though many stuck to traditional views that Mr. McIver would win. Nevertheless, Prof. Taras praised Mr. Nenshi&rsquo;s campaign.</p>
<p>&#8220;His ability to connect and win volunteers, I mean, his ranking on the charisma index is probably 10 out of 10. He&rsquo;s very articulate, he showed a deep knowledge of policy, and he had a vision for the city,&#8221; Prof. Taras said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think this is a city of change, but it&rsquo;s a cosmopolitan city. It&rsquo;s a younger, more cosmopolitan, more progressive face than people are used to thinking about Calgary. When people think about Calgary they don&rsquo;t tend to think of it as a cosmopolitan city.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Calgary is my hometown, and I must admit, I&rsquo;m shocked that this happened. Calgary is known for beef steaks, western redneck pride, the largest outdoor rodeo on earth (The Calgary Stampede), the 1988 Winter Olympics, and conversatism in general - it&rsquo;s been decades since Calgarians elected a left-wing federal politician. And now this happens?</p>
<p>Well, when I grew up in Calgary in the 1980s, when I rode the LRT (light rail transit), everybody around me spoke English. When I visited Calgary a couple of years ago and rode the LRT, nobody was speaking English. It came as quite a shock. I guess that&rsquo;s what a booming economy can do - it might result in increased profits, but it also results in increased third world immigration. Maybe a stagnant economy might be better? Whoops, I forgot about Lewiston, Maine, and the Somali influx there. I guess there&rsquo;s no magic economic formula that&rsquo;ll truly work in this regard.</p>

		<p>Calgary is riding a wave of prosperity due to oil deposits in the province.  The population doesn&rsquo;t have a history of non-whites, who only began arriving in the last couple of decades in significant numbers.</p>
<p>Racial awareness in Calgary is still very backward and inarticulate, with inept neo-nazis disgracing themselves with embarrassing public displays.  In may be a while before urban whites in Canada cool to the novelty of supporting a young, hip brown candidate. </p>

		<p>The name Naheed Nenshi has a ring tone similar to the name of Barack Hussein Obama, which is disconcerting in itself, should Calgary&rsquo;s newly-elected mayor decide to enter Canadian federal politics with the notion of becoming our Prime Minister at some future date.</p>
<p>President Obama reportedly received some 96% of the black vote based on the fact that his skin color was similar to their own. </p>
<p>Similarly, I&rsquo;m sure a record voter turnout of Calgary&rsquo;s <i>visible-minorities</i> were helpful in electing <i>anybody</i>, but a White candidate, and assisted by those brainwashed White Calgarians who know absolutely nothing of how racial and block-voting operates in the real world.</p>
<p>Canadians are still &#8220;babes-in-the-woods&#8221; when confronted with those realities.</p>

		<p>Every city in the developed world is becoming more cosmopolitan, from Western Europe to North America to Australia. This is all being done in the name of diversity - to make all our cities equally cosmopolitan. I liked the old Calgary better. It was a real cowboy city. It had a different feel to it than Vancouver or Toronto. </p>

I&rsquo;m sure plenty of vacant-headed White Canadian semi-left-wing-trendies voted this Black Muslim into office.</p>

		<p>this cosmopolitan wanderer from Harvard U, a increasingly annoying incublator of greedy wannabes from Obama to Zuckerberg, has never held a real job in his life. Read his resume in the article. </p>
<p>The UN? Is that a job or paid vacation? </p>
<p>He says he spent an extra &#8220;minute&#8221; with a clerk from Safeway as part of his tactics. How fortunate the working class is!</p>
<p> I see the problem of &#8220;young people&#8221; and their mindless endorsement of &#8216;we&rsquo;re all the same&rsquo; thinking spreading: Obama, now this empty robe. </p>
<p>Well,like Obama (see the similarities?)he can&rsquo;t be much of a Muslim; he hangs in bars(a good mark on his behalf). He&rsquo;d better be careful however: His co-religionists aren&rsquo;t so tolerant of diversity. If this guy drinks he could find his head on the bar, as an appetizer.</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;a wonkish, even dorky, academic and visible minority elected to the helm of what is often called Canada&rsquo;s most conservative city after a campaign driven by charisma and sheer determination&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p><br>
Lamestream media outlets like the Globe and Mail   &mdash;   once a dignified and conservative financial publication; now merely yet another cheerleader for white dispossession and Radical Egalitarianism   &mdash;   are so drunk from the multiculti kool-aid that they don&rsquo;t even notice that they constantly contradict themselves with illogical, impossible. Here we have one such lamestreamer contradicting himself <i>within the same sentence</i>: How on earth can this new Muslim mayor be a &#8220;wonkish, even dorky academic&#8221; and yet win the race by &#8220;charisma&#8221;? </p>
<p>The answer, of course, is that this wonkish, dorky academic has skin that&rsquo;s some color other than White, a religion other than Christianity, and a name other than Jones or Smith. His &#8220;charisma&#8221; is his pigmentation and his exoticism. Same as a certain US President who is hailed as &#8220;charismatic&#8221; (and more) despite his monotonous, humorless, lecturing oratory style reminiscent of a Sociology professor at some third-rate regional college. </p>
<p>Question: Will the Prairie Oysters at the next Calgary Stampede be cooked <i>halal</i> style? </p>

It had a different feel to it than Vancouver or Toronto.&#8221; </p>
<p>You forgot to note that this &#8220;cosmopolitan&#8221; goal for cities, is exclusively a Western phenomenae.  It exists because both corporate capitalists and Marxists socialists, have found common ground;  The capitalists see value in replacing a large middle class of whites with expectations with third worlders who will allow for bigger profits (at least for a couple generations), and the Marxists think that they will win because the increase in &#8220;Diversity&#8221; really means NO Culture, no national feeling, and certainly NO more racial identity.  So the Marxist think that they will produce a more just world with equality all around IF they succeed in blending the races and destroying national identity for those who feel indigenous identities like ethnic, racial British, or Germans, etc., while the Capitalists will go along as long as they get cheaper labor, because they think (as well as many who have still have cushy jobs and lifestyles), that it may change life for others, but not THEM.  </p>
<p>Of course, this is a tragic miscalculation and blunder.  Niether will acheive their aims.  All that will result will be a more chaotic world with the competition between Captialists and Marxists up a big notch or two.  All that will result is that the individual will loose more personal freedom as they are herded along into these futures.  Once they are there, they will have lost their roots becuase they will no longer be able to recognize themselves as anything but a human being on an increasingly crowded and polluted planet.  But the struggle between the rich and poor through these rotten political competitions will go on to the last gasp.</p>
<p>Unless enough people are intelligent enough to avoid this inevitability.</p>

<p>The area I live in in the deep South is also horse country.  When I relocated here from California, I was surprised to note how easily some of these rednecks can be fooled by MSM propganda and the schools.  They&rsquo;re as rabidly pro-multicult as they were anti-black 100 years ago.</p>
<p>Now, instead of wanting to denigrate blacks, their greatest desires are to &#8220;pertek the envarment&#8221; and elect some mentally challenged black class president.</p>
<p>Mentioning anything that has to do with the concepts of the unfairness of affirmative action will only draw blank stares.  </p>

  Sorry, I cannot agree with your assumptions, friend. There are a great many  &#8220;rural Canadians&#8221;, just waiting for the starting gun. It is a common topic on the oilfield. Men here working from all over my Canada, feel the same of thier home cities. Everyone has had dealings with lazy, racist non-whites. Our cities are eating themselves alive. Those like us, will clean up when the free ride ends. 350,000+ rufnecks. All with rod wrenches. Proud Canadian Whites, and getting frustrated with our governments fast. Our concern is as yours, our childrens future. All White children. Even in Calgary. </p>

<p>One reason is because the South has been bashed by the rest of the USA for so many years and accused of being &#8220;racist&#8221;, many Southerners  will go out of there way to make sure they are not being &#8220;racist&#8221;, more so than other parts of the country and can be the biggest supporters of affirmative action because of this.</p>

		<p>johnny from N. Alberta - I am heartened to hear your words and views.  I hope, and it does seem so reading the comments section of the CBC&rsquo;s website, that more and more real Canadians are waking up to the deadly juggernaut of mass immigration.  Most often, however, living in a major eastern Canadian city, it feels almost hopeless.  The average white Canadian seems apathetically resigned, even joyous, at rapidly becoming a minority in their own lands.  A minority to low IQ, anti-white primitives.  What a fate to wish on your descendants&hellip;may it not be so.</p>

<p>Third place woman Higgins could not get the female vote and only helped to elect the muslim mayor.</p>
<p>More proof that democracy works well for the foreigners and not so well for the majority white populace.</p>
<p>I also remember a Calgary not that many years ago that was 99.9 percent white.</p>
<p>If you drive through the north east part of Calgary now, you would think you are in India or Pakistan.  The airport also gives the perception of being in a foreign country.</p>
<p>At least I have the good old days to remember, but they will not return and that is a trajedy.</p>

		<p>I saw this coming a mile away. It was all too predictable with so many Whites splitting any potential &#8220;White vote&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Shame on Calgary  &mdash;  -My Toronto is now a third world city, congested, violent, and dirty with many whites who have move out of the city. I respect Japan, China, Saudi Arabia and many other countries for protecting their race and culture. We white European Canadian also have a duty to protect our race as noted in the United Nations Charter We must respect other nations and races, but, not let them flood into Canada at this alarming rate. We will end up as 2nd. class citizens in our own country-wake up Canada.</p>
