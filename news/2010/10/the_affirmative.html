<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Exhaustive, well-documented, and hard-hitting, Professor Steven Farron&rsquo;s powerful critique of racial preferences, <cite>The Affirmative Action Hoax,</cite> is now available in a greatly expanded, revised second edition from New Century Books.</p>
<p>Since the 1980s, there has been increasing criticism of so-called affirmative action, but no other book matches <cite>The Affirmative Action Hoax</cite> in its scope and incisiveness. This book does not mince words like other critiques of racial preferences; it unmasks the defenses of preferences as the &#8220;shameless frauds and deliberate lies that they are.&#8221; It shows that elevating non-academic admissions criteria, such as &#8220;diversity&#8221; and character assessments, to the same level as objective criteria has no purpose other than to justify the anti-white discrimination that has taken hold of American universities since the 1960s.</p>
<p>Prof. Farron demonstrates how racial preferences have moved from admissions to grading and even graduation, and shows how the lies necessary to justify preferences corrupt our academic institutions and the people who run them. He shows  &mdash;  with irrefutable numeric evidence  &mdash;  that the true victims are not blacks and Hispanics or even Asians, all of whom enjoy undiluted advantages. The victims are whites.</p>
<p>Prof. Farron argues that if we must have racial preferences, explicit quotas are the most efficient, honest, and fair way to practice them.</p>
<p>Praise for <cite>The Affirmative Action Hoax:</cite></p>
<p>&#8220;There are entire libraries of books and articles on affirmative action, but if I had to choose a single one, it would be Steven Farron&rsquo;s <cite>The Affirmative Action Hoax.</cite> It is clearly written, carefully documented, and brutally honest.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I consider <cite>The Affirmative Action Hoax</cite> the authoritative reference book on this complicated subject.&Nbps;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is a stellar scholarly performance.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>  &mdash;  Prof. (Emeritus) Robert Weissberg, University of Illinois</b></p>
<p>&#8220;Prof. Farron&rsquo;s carefully documented brief leads us to believe that modern egalitarian politics is at war with Nature itself. Affirmative action therefore rewards the less talented at the expense of the better qualified. Its proponents appeal to the socially victimized or to &#8216;diversity&rsquo; in order to justify disadvantaging people or groups whose only crime is to be intelligent.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>  &mdash;  Prof. Paul Gottfried, Elizabethtown College</b></p>

		<p>My first exposure to Affirmative Action was in the early 70&rsquo;s and I didn&rsquo;t even realize it then, when I was still in high school. I had never heard the phrase Affirmative Action until years later, and being older and wiser, I was able to put two and two together.</p>
<p>My first year of high school,(1971),was the first year they intergrated schools in my area. I was forced to attend what had been an all black school with a racial mixture 70/30-seventy percent black and thirty percent white. </p>
<p>When I went to talk to my counseler about scholarships to college, she was very abrupt and dismissive. Even though I was making excellent grades. She was black. And I was much too young and naive to understand why. Besides maybe a natural inclination to blow me off because I was white, when I got older I realized she had probably been instructed by the upper echelon to discourage white students from applying for scholarships. Because the black student next in line to talk to her, who I knew was not college material,(lazy with bad grades), she encouraged to apply and couldn&rsquo;t do enough for.</p>
<p>Affirmative Action a hoax? You bet. Which has wasted more money and done more damage to this country than we will ever know. And the liberals who designed it? They will never admit they were wrong. This is just one example. College educating people of low mentality with no drive over intelligent people who want to learn. The architects of Affirmative Action should be hung by their thumbs. </p>

		<p>the government and mass media carefully cover up two damnning facts about white unemployment in the current crisis:</p>
<p>1. constant reference to the uninformative &#8220;official&#8221; unemployment rate under 10%. The better rate is the U6 rate that measures those out of work and looking, out of work and stopped looking(discouraged, impossible) and those working part-time or in jobs below skills but would like to work fulltime in their skill. U6 rate is approximately 18% of work force.</p>
<p>2. While media focuses on black &#8220;youth&#8221; and then black adult unemployment, it never touches the numbers,in the  millions I would think, of unemployed or underemplyed whites, particularly men, who are in a dire situation because they have been bumped out of their skill or academic path to success because of affirmative action. </p>
<p>Part of this damage extends prior to the late  &#8216;08 financial crash, part of this damage has occurred since. Combined with outsource of jobs, including white collar,to India and China plus various Asian and African ministates, white labor increasingly declines in value. </p>
<p>This stresses and then destroys the white family, white values, and further dilutes the qualtiy of US education, goods and services, causing further loss of wealth in the long-term to non-Western cultures.</p>

		<p>Those who advocate affirmative action policies necessarily lie about them.  They say that they do not lower mental standards for blacks and Hispanics and physical standards for women, but they do.  They say they do not require quotas, but they do.  They say they do not discriminate against white men, but they do.<br>
 <br>
Affirmative action policies do not harm rich white men.  They already have it made.  They harm working class white men.  This harm is a major reason the white working class became a Republican constituency.  </p>

		<p>Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not a hoax. And it&rsquo;s constantly expanding. Reagan, in his senility, was talked into extending it to Hindus (the richest group in the US after the Jews) and Hasidic Jews. Muslims are currently lobbying for it. East Asians still get it, though not for college admissions since they are the majority in many colleges now.</p>

		<p>A man on Washington Journal recently talked about the post-first-year dropout rate at four-year colleges.  He stated that about a million students begin college, but only about 300,000 return for a second year.  When questioned by a caller, he insisted that these return rates were not broken down by race, but finally surrendered the fact that black graduation rates (in six years) are &#8220;about 20 points lower&#8221;  &mdash;  which would put them, I assume, at 40% since the overall rate was 60% graduation.  He, like all apologists for black underachievement, placed the blame on the institutions of learning and said that state funding should be tied to how many students graduate.  So, I guess all the colleges need to do is instruct professors to give higher grades!  The man was on the CSPAN program to discuss how much federal and state expenditure, including grants to the poor, is wasted because of all this.  Though he avoided speaking of race, another caller stated that Obama is pouring money into historically black colleges.  It was pretty obvious that the listeners got the message that one could hear between the lines.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t have time for all 37 minutes, at least listen to the fist bit about the Harvard Medical School&rsquo;s graduation rate. The stats Farron presents will shock even the most informed of Affirmative Action critics. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t have to read this &#8216;exhaustive&rsquo;, &#8216;hard-hitting&rsquo; and &#8216;well-documented&rsquo; tome to understand AA  &mdash;  I live it.  Every day. I am forced, against my will, to live within its racist, ugly, anti-White parameters.</p>
<p><i>Prof. Farron argues that if we must have racial preferences, explicit quotas are the most efficient, honest, and fair way to practice them</i>.</p>
<p>No, Professor.  The most efficient, fair, honest way to practice &#8216;explicit quotas&rsquo; are to eliminate them, effective <i>immediately</i> and make sure they are <i>never imposed again</i>.</p>
<p>I am about to enter the college admissions game with my 17-year old son and I am dreading it with all of my being.  When I went through this horrible dance with my daughter a few years ago it damn near killed me. </p>
<p>Real people are involved  &mdash;  real young people, Whites, who are denied entrance because of their race, forced to  stand aside and watch as non-Whites/Asians with inferior grades and test scores are fawned over, offered college admissions and full rides.  </p>
<p>How is that fair?  How is that possibly fair?</p>
<p>Some on this board have scolded me, told me to &#8216;get over myself&rsquo; and to you I say this:  I hope you <b>never</b> have the experience I did, watching the anguish in your child&rsquo;s face as she receives rejection after rejection, asking what she did wrong, what was the purpose of working so hard, was all of her sacrifice for naught, why did she bother going to interviews if she were only going to be rejected?  </p>
<p>I told her, bluntly, the rejections are because of her skin color.</p>
<p>My son is currently ranked in the top five of his class, his test scores ranging between 95-100% in all areas.  If he were non-White, we know that major universities, nation-wide, public and private, one after another, would be beating down our front door, offering to fly him free to their respective campuses, offering him full scholarships, our phone ringing off the hook.</p>
<p>As it is, there is very little interest from colleges or universities in a top-rated student.</p>
<p>Because he is White, forced to bow to the altar of PC, set aside his own dreams and aspirations as &#8216;people of color&rsquo;  displace him in the &#8216;Land of Freedom.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>My grandfather and my father worked at Chrysler and both had outstanding work records. My dad missed about 4 days of work in 30 years. He held the record at his plant for not missing a days work or being late in 16 years. We lived in a suburb of Detroit and most of my friends had a parent who worked for the Big 3. I can&rsquo;t think of one person among my friends who could get a job at the Big 3. Most Whites were locked out and couldn&rsquo;t get a job there. Blacks and other minorities got most of the jobs. From what I&rsquo;ve heard, the Federal Government used high pressure and tax incentives to get the Big 3 to hire minorities. Sub contractors of the Big 3 had to hire minorities or lose contracts. And once they&rsquo;re in the union, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to get rid of them no matter what they do.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t buy a car from a company that wouldn&rsquo;t hire me so I pretty much stick with Toyota. Toyota would hire me before the Big 3 would so I have no loyalty to any American car company. If you buy a car from the Big 3 you&rsquo;re supporting a job held by a minority. Half of the Big 3 engineering jobs are held by Indians and Chinese.</p>
<p>In a Detroit News article from 10 years ago:</p>
<p>Blacks are 52% of Chrysler employees<br>
Blacks are 38% of Ford employees<br>
Blacks are 28% of GM employees</p>
<p>If you add in all the other minorities, you can add 20% to the above totals. The plant my dad worked at was about 95% black.</p>
<p>Now you know why the Big 3 will never be able to compete with the Japanese on quality.</p>

<p>   When you consider that none of the groups you named were victims of &ldquo;historic discrimination&rdquo;, affirmative action is revealed as a huge hoax, a racial spoils system. Why are recent African and Hindu immigrants considered eligible for hiring quotas? Were they victims of American racism and the &#8220;legacy of slavery&rsquo; ?</p>

<p>They can never admit whites are giving up something for the &#8216;greater good&rsquo;. The more any organization practices affirmative action, the more the outward face presented must be that it is whites who are discriminating and that this is wrong and evil. It&rsquo;s part of the campaign to fight &#8216;stereotypes&rsquo; and to be &#8216;sensitive&rsquo;. As long as you don&rsquo;t really consider white men people - blaming all evil in history, and evils continuation in the present, on whites is considering being sensitive.</p>

<p>While I was a grad student, I worked for a major &#8216;Christian bookstore&rsquo; of a &#8216;big three&rsquo; Denomination. (not my own)  We carried books from their own denominational Publishing house, but we also ordered  from the major two book distribution houses in the USA. That&rsquo;s right, there are/were really only two houses from which ALL book houses order their materials.</p>
<p>Not only that, but we would get flyers from one publishing house on an almost weekly basis. What was odd was that this one publishing house would send their bills with inserts advertising their &#8216;hot new releases.&rsquo; Once, their publishing house touted the latest &#8216;Gay World Travel guide&rsquo;, and how &#8216;having this in your store will help sales, etc.&rsquo; We got this, mailed to a Christian bookstore! It did not even cause my Mgr. to blink, when I mentioned it to her. My point? Hourly employees of such bookstores could care less what books come into the shop&hellip; especially those which are never going to be &#8216;best sellers&rsquo; like &#8216;theology&rsquo; books by Spong, Gene Robinson, or Shuessler-Fiorenza, et al. (that last was a joke, btw)</p>

<p>They may be the only ones left buying American cars. Those in the upper half and upper 3rd of the income bracket rarely buy American cars.</p>
<p>Interesting whites are such a small part of Chrysler&rsquo;s workforce. I always imagined it would be Chrysler that would go to the white part of the country. It&rsquo;s a wonder that whites never learn. Even Sweden will fall too, aparently.</p>
