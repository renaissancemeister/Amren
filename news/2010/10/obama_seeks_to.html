<h1>Obama Seeks to Boost Hispanic Achievement</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Forbes, October 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Barack Obama signed an executive order Tuesday intended to boost Hispanic education achievement, a priority for a key voting bloc two weeks ahead of critical midterm elections.</p>
<p>The measure is intended to widen the scope of a long-standing White House initiative on Latino education by increasing partnerships with the private sector and soliciting more input from the community. {snip}</p>
<p>In a ceremony in the East Room, Obama noted that Latinos make up the largest minority group in the country&rsquo;s public schools, accounting for more than 1 in 5 students, but are likelier to attend low-performing schools and drop out.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tuesday&rsquo;s announcement broke little new policy ground but allowed the White House to showcase an issue important to the Hispanic community ahead of midterm elections that will determine whether Democrats maintain control of Congress. Hispanic leaders and educators were invited, and were greeted by a mariachi band in the Grand Foyer outside the East Room.</p>
<p>Hispanics were 9 percent of all voters in 2008  &mdash;  similar to the 8 percent they represented in 2006 and 2004  &mdash;  and account for an even larger share of the electorate in several states where key Senate races are under way, including California and Nevada.</p>
<p>And, Hispanics put a higher premium on education than Americans overall do, according to an Associated Press-Univision Poll conducted earlier this year. Eighty-seven percent of Hispanics said a college education is extremely or very important, compared with 78 percent of the overall U.S. population.<br>

		<p>Two things:</p>
<p>&#8220;Obama noted that Latinos make up the largest minority group in the country&rsquo;s public schools&hellip;but are likelier to attend low-performing schools and drop out.&#8221;</p>
<p>-  What is making each of those schools &#8216;low-performing&rsquo;?  THE STUDENTS.  Many, many Latino &#8216;students&rsquo; are so behind educationally that you would not believe it.  Add to that the lack of interest in education among the fiesta-all-day crowd!  </p>
<p>They drop out because they DO NOT LIKE something that is hard to do, like reading, writing, &#8216;rithmatic.  Heck, many people of all races drop out for the same reasons, latinos just do it more.  </p>
<p>The reqs. in education are insane.  A latino can show up speaking no English and not having attended school since grade 3, and then he&rsquo;s put in 11th grade and asked to perform like everyone else.  &#8220;All children can learn,&#8221; the leftist smiles. Insane.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Hispanics put a higher premium on education than Americans overall do&#8221;</p>
<p>- This is a damn lie!  A lie!  A lie!  A lie!  I work among latinos from all latino nations, the teenagers in general DO NOT CARE AT ALL about anything related to study, book-work or learning.  </p>
<p>MANY parents I have contacted WILL SAY they value education, but then they make every excuse for their kids&rsquo; lack of progress and then let their kids drop out to &#8216;support&rsquo; the family, gang-bang, etc.</p>
<p>A poll is not the truth, it&rsquo;s just opinions and people will never say they do not support something good, like education.</p>

		<p>Do these people even bother to read their nonsense before they publish it? In their rush for PC, did they notice this article is one big condtradiction? According to Obama, Latinos are more likely to drop out of school and need a boost in education achievement, yet we are to believe they place a higher premium on education than Americans? Give me a break. They really do think we&rsquo;re stupid don&rsquo;t they?</p>

		<p>Why couldn&rsquo;t President Obama sign an executive order boosting white achievement?  Why leave us out on all the goodies?</p>
<p>Then again, I&rsquo;m not dumb enough to believe that a Presidential edict can boost academic achievement, because it can&rsquo;t raise IQ.  Therefore, I don&rsquo;t feel the need for any Presidential executive orders.</p>
<p>BTW, how does he expect his EO to boost Hispanic achievement in all of 13 days?</p>

<p>Again they have it backwards. The schools are low-performing BECAUSE the students are Hispanic.</p>

<p>More money wasted for the usual zero results.  </p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s intent as is the intent of most all so-called black leaders is to pretend to be for brown interests as much as for blacks.  </p>
<p>If they get their brown society of blacks and HIspanics it will be constant war from day one.</p>
<p>Both groups hate each other&hellip;generally&hellip;.and they don&rsquo;t care one whit what Obama or their brown leaders tell them about getting along with blacks.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as a happy, peaceful, multicult utopia.  Diversity is a dangerous weakness.</p>

		<p>The proof is in the pudding and the Hispanic drop out rates prove that they do not value education higher than other American.  Just because some telephone survey says they do doesn&rsquo;t make it so.  Action, not words, are what counts.  Jews, and certain Asian groups might place a higher value on education than the generic white person but not Hispanics.  Kind of like all the hoopla over blacks being more conservative than whites while running around having random sex and illegitimate children and catching AIDS left and right.  Phooey!</p>

		<p>Anyone who believes that hispanics value education more than those who are not plagued by rampant underachievement must be in the education industry.  I think Steve Sailer referred to this as &#8220;revealed preference&#8221;.  They claim something is a priority but every measure points to that thing not being a priority.</p>

		<p>Obama is doing all he can to try and keep Democrats in power, and it sickens me to say he might do it. I don&rsquo;t think there will be the Republican landslide expected, and if not our country is simply lost. Democrats will ram through more of Obama&rsquo;s anti-American agenda, turning the U.S. into another overcrowded hell hole. And Obama is surely not even qualified as president, this is the most sickening part. Obama is campaigning hard and gives a persuasive speech but it is full of lies and half truths. And sadly, because of immigration of largely dumb people the Democrats may pull if off. God help us. </p>

<p>&hellip;And of course this article just swallows this claim unchallenged, despite the fact that Hispanics&rsquo; actions don&rsquo;t match the claims of &#8220;valuing education&#8221; they make  in the surveys.</p>

		<p>This obama character all he has been doing since taking office is using taxpayers&rsquo; money to buy votes = staying in power and going on vacations.  The Hispanics/blacks may want to graduate from high school/college BUT it is a different story from actually doing it.  There was earlier article concerning this.  These power hungry people close their eyes shut tight when it comes to wasting of money.  For anyone to say otherwise, the hollering of racism starts.  Why is it that no special effort is given to whites/Asians, where the money is put to better use?  For sure, it will get us back up to the top in international testing.  <br>
Obama has a hidden agenda, look at Dinesh D&rsquo;Souza&rsquo;s The Root of Obama&rsquo;s Rage.  Obama&rsquo;s vision is NOT what the Founding Fathers envisioned.  We are steadily heading toward a third world country once the whites are no longer the majority.  The invading hordes from third world countries cannot sustain this country.  Obama needs to go back to his father&rsquo;s country, Kenya.  He can better help Kenya but then it is not the same glory.  The blacks can easily turn this country similar to South Africa, if they could.  Whites are regularly murdered in Africa with the rest of the world ignoring it.  The technological advances that we are enjoying came from white brain power.  This planet will regress if the white gene pool is diluted.  Stop being brainwashed by the *** (fill in the blank) media.  Diversity in this country = third world = crime, poverty, corruption.  It is easy to fall into the fallacy of thinking one is racist if this country is not allowed to be invaded by third worlders, that&rsquo;s what brainwashing is all about.<br>

		<p><i>President Barack Obama signed an executive order Tuesday intended to boost Hispanic education achievement</i></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s started already.</p>
<p>I spent part of today in a captive audience, remanded to attend a hated teachers&rsquo; professional development where I was forced to listen to a reading of the many, various and lucrative scholarships that are available <i>only to hispanics</i>, how easy it is to apply for and receive said scholarships, even multiple scholarships, with few to no questions asked and little or no follow-up as to how the &#8216;scholarship&rsquo; money was spent.</p>
<p>The hispanic presenters bragged at how they used their college scholarship money to go to Disneyland, pay for gas, rent and food, pay for concert tickets, clothing, take vacations, buy furniture, purchase cars and help out needy family members.</p>
<p>With this &#8216;new&rsquo; executive order, you can be sure there will be more &#8216;scholarship&rsquo; monies available, directed at and wasted on middling to mediocre hispanic students with no questions asked later as to what the money was used for.</p>
<p>But here remains the problem:  Hispanics average an IQ of 89 on the Lynn-Vanhanen scale. The average Hispanic falls at the 24th percentile of the white IQ distribution. </p>
<p>Got that?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the conundrum, as explained by Charles Murray in <i>Education and Intelligence </i> :</p>
<p><i>There is no magic point at which a genuine college-level education becomes an option, but anything below an IQ of 110 is problematic. If you want to do well, you should have an IQ of 115 or higher. Put another way, it makes sense for only about 15% of the population to attend college.</i></p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/2ahxkua" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2ahxkua</a></p>
<p>But we teachers are expected to be alchemists, to turn lead into gold, because in the upside down world of the educational complex, there are no differences in IQ.</p>
<p>Got that?</p>

		<p>Largest minority group, eh?  I&rsquo;ll just bet that makes the blacks feel all warm and fuzzy.<br>
Especially since perhaps HALF or that &#8220;largest minority&#8221; don&rsquo;t have a right to even be here in the first place.  And, from the black point of view, where&rsquo;s THEIR preferential executive order?<br>
What about THEM?  they must be thinking.  Hey, if Obama makes them mad enough to stay home and not vote, I&rsquo;m for it!  From the mood in some of those border states, it is very likely there will be far more scrutiny of hispanic eligibility to vote at the polls, too.<br>
One can hope, anyway.  </p>

		<p>Achievement comes from within a person/group. The reasoning in trying to &#8220;boost&#8221; it via additional financial/legislative means, is similar to thinking that if one man can cause a pregnancy term to run 9 months, then 9 men will cause it to run only a single month. In South Africa we see the fruits of this fallacy in the current demise of what once was the only first world country in Africa. Obama&rsquo;s wasteful endeavor will have no dissimilar end result. In South Africa the process just took much less time, as there are far less white European descendants still trying to keep it together, compared to the USA.</p>

		<p>I agree with I Bon&rsquo;s post. As one who worked for the past three years educating mostly Hispanic students at the high school level in a big city public school, I can say that the I.Q. issue is the main drawback for doing college prep work. While I worked with some good Hispanic students, the overall average I.Q. just doesn&rsquo;t allow the majority of them in the U.S. to prepare for university work in any realistic way. But as an educator, one must always pretend that these facts don&rsquo;t exist in order to maintain a teaching job.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s the point of SAT, LSAT, MCAT and all the other -professional- occupational entry tests designed to &#8216;thresh the wheat&rsquo; and winnow the chaff if they are consistently ignored and overridden by ethnic quota or privilege driven SIMOs (scholarships in name only)?</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s another question: Whatever&rsquo;s gonna happen in the midterms is probably gonna happen, regardless.  Let&rsquo;s look beyond them.  Let&rsquo;s say that the inevitable is that we either get the representation we deserve: a switchout between labels while maintaining the same, non racially conscious, knuckle-under, timids.</p>
<p>Or that the democrats, by hook or by crook, succeed in staying in office.</p>
<p>If the U.S. fragmented, ethnically, right now into a midwest nation and coastal hinterlands (thus helpless in the face of necessary imports for which a troll&rsquo;s worth of &#8216;levy&rsquo; would have to be paid for safe delivery) where everything from Kansas to Utah and Colorado to Canada was ethnically re homogenized, how many teachers and professors could we count on to &#8216;transfer&rsquo;?  </p>
<p>Not just their expertise but the _knowledge base and equipment_ of the university system to a new lifestyle and location where they could once again concentrate on the impartation of knowledge and the cultivation of minds rather than playing Archimedes, levering the ethnic earth?</p>
<p>I want to know, how much of Academia is mentally crippled by socialist libtardism.  And how rapidly we could stand up a new country, currency and loan status based on the accomplishments of an R&D; base which the university campus&rsquo; have traditionally resource represented for this nation?</p>
<p>Even more bluntly: Is there any point in trying to rescue our educational system, for whites, or is it best to just start over?</p>

		<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree with NBJ more. Dead on. They really do think we&rsquo;re all that stupid! An incredible contradiction! They need the wonderful Obama to give them a boost, but they care so much about education! It&rsquo;s beyond laughable! Of course people are going to say they care about education when the&rsquo;re asked. It&rsquo;s a shame that more people don&rsquo;t realize what a demented society we live in. God help us all!</p>

<p>Mestizo drop out rate in high school is AT LEAST 50% according to most all analysts.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t sound to me like they value education above anybody.  Even blacks stay in school longer.  </p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that they&rsquo;re not dropping out due to course difficulty, because ALL HIGH SCHOOLS now pass non-whites just for showing up, especially blacks.</p>
<p>So, the importance of an education to mestizos is very, very low.</p>
<p>Obviously they say one thing and do another.  <br>
