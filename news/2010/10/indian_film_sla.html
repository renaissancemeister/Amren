<h1>Indian Film Slammed for Stereotyping Aussies</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ninemsn (Australia), October 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new Bollywood blockbuster about an Indian who is caught up in race-related violence in Melbourne has been labelled &#8220;insensitive&#8221; by India&rsquo;s own film critics.</p>
<p>The film, called Crook: it&rsquo;s Good to be Bad, reportedly depicts Melbourne as a city plagued by racial attacks and full of promiscuous women.</p>
<p>Reviews in Indian media have slammed the film for its sensational and stereotypical presentation of Australia, the Herald Sun reports.</p>
<p>&#8220;The film tries to pack in every sensational aspect of racism that is possible. There&rsquo;s a white woman who pole dances and sleeps with (the male lead) with equal fervour,&#8221; a review in India Today reads.</p>
<p>&#8220;Naturally she is blonde and has big you-know-whats. There is a Australian man, her brother, Russell, who goes around hitting and bullying Indians. There is no other word for it. It&rsquo;s terrible. More than that, it is badly directed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The review said that the film, which was released this week in India, spews &#8220;venom&#8221; against Australians.</p>
<p>&#8220;A country of ex-convicts. A country where they sleep with each other without marrying. A country where they don&rsquo;t take care of their families. Yes, that&rsquo;s the sort of venom that&rsquo;s spewed against the Australians in Crook,&#8221; the reviewer wrote.</p>
<p>Film website bollyspice.com also slammed the film, calling it &#8220;far too insensitive&#8221;.</p>
<p>Crook was inspired by a spate of attacks against Indian students in Melbourne, including a number of stabbings in June last year.</p>
<p>The racial tension culminated in a protest by the Indian community during which Flinders Street in the CBD was blockaded.</p>
<p>The film has also been criticised for a topless scene, which although shot from the back, is considered very racy for a Bollywood film.</p>
<p>Director Mohit Suri said he got the idea for the film when he was in a convenience store in Melbourne.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the news flashed &#8216;Over 20 incidents of curry bashing have taken place in Sydney and Melbourne in the past 30 days&rsquo;, I found myself standing outside a 24-hour convenient store in the Sunshine district of Melbourne city in search of a story,&#8221; he told an Indian entertainment website.</p>
<p>&#8220;Inside the very same store one of the most brutal racist attacks had taken place just a few months back. The events as told to me were horrifying, about how an Indian was brutally beaten up only because of his colour and religion.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Suri said a poster on the wall made him realise racism exists in all societies.<br>

		<p>Whites are ignorant about how Asians talk about them around the kitchen table.  We are stereo-typed by them in our sexual and work habits.  </p>
<p>Generally, they are jealous of us, they think we have it too easy, they think we &#8216;stole&rsquo; North America and Australia, and their males see sexual conquest of white women as the consolation prize for being second to white success.</p>
<p>This movie is a breakthrough in candor. Unlike whites, Asians don&rsquo;t beat themselves up about their racism, and usually don&rsquo;t air it in public. </p>
<p>Whites should pay close attention. <br>

		<p>First of all, I guess, even if it shows ignorance on the part of Indians, they DO have a right to portray Westerners as they wish in their movies. </p>
<p>That being said, aren&rsquo;t most of the crimes commited against Indians in Australia commited by blacks and arabs, as opposed to white Australians?  American Renaissance has posted articles before that deal with how ill informed Indian newspapers are on this topic.</p>
<p>This is how Indians are.  I have been around enough of them.  The richer Indians, whether in India or abroad, have an arrogance about their country that hasn&rsquo;t even been earned.  Simultaneously, they look down on white people and only seem to focus on the bad in us.</p>
<p>I went to college with quite a few of them at a major university in the South.  All these Indians did was poke fun at white Southern rednecks as if they were representative of whites everywhere.</p>
<p>I think Indians should focus more on the imperfections of their own people.  When polls come out that rank countries by the prevalance of certain diseases as well as malnourishment and illiteracy, India always seems to do worse than many black countries.  A lot of this has to do with its large population compared to many black countries.  </p>
<p>Having said that, Indians have no business labeling whites and stereotyping whites the way they do.  Well, sure they can do it in their own countries as much as they want, but as the saying goes &#8220;pride comes before a fall&#8221;.  When will India have another Nobel Prize winner in one of the sciences?</p>
<p>It would do Indians a lot of good to start portraying MOST whites as they really are: civil, welcoming, clean, moral, high IQed etc&hellip;.. Why don&rsquo;t they start focusing on the fact that whenever the global rankings of universities come out, the top 100 slots are still dominated by universities in white countries.  And that right there is just one example.</p>
<p>In the mean time, white people need to recognize that we are responsible for many of our negative stereotypes.  </p>
<p>We need to stop electing idiotic presidents like George Bush who enjoy going to India and telling Indians how much the science and engineering industry in the West needs them. People like Tony Blair need to stop telling the Indian community in Britain that they are &#8220;Britain&rsquo;s future&#8221;.  It is time for white countries to stop allowing Hollywood and our own media to portray whites as a bunch of inbreds, racists, and sexual deviants.</p>
<p>Enough is enough.</p>

<p>Virtually all of the attacks on Indians in Australia that have happened recently were perpetrated by Lebanese, Sudanese and other non-whites.  The Australian media of course went out of it&rsquo;s way to cover this up make it sound like Indians were being attacked by real Australians, as did the Indian media.  </p>

		<p>Who cares how these little brown people think of us.  Half a billion women in that country and not a pretty one amongst them.  Although I believe it is Muslims doing the assaulting of Indians in Australia, if it is white Australians, good.  As we don&rsquo;t belong in India, they do not belong in the West.  You come and invade my country with your toxic presence, expect a downside.</p>

<p>As an American, I agree with you that Europeans and Australians go too far with their liberal attitudes on nudity.  However, most of the nudity in these Western countries is confined only to certain beaches, and that is enforced by law.</p>
<p>If we wish to discuss which culture is more modest (Indian or Western), I recently saw a documentary where an American went to India, filming the filth of that country.  Men were openly defecating in fields, not even caring that they were exposing themselves (and a whole lot more) to the Western camera crew. </p>
<p>And what about these mystics that enjoy walking around India with no clothes?  Even in Europe and Australia, by doing such a thing in public streets, you would get thrown in jail.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Reviews in Indian media have slammed the film for its sensational and stereotypical presentation of Australia, the Herald Sun reports.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Actually, I must admit that I am a bit pleased and surprised with this story. Posters like Courtney and ATBOTL who I normally agree with, need to look at the silver lining in the cloud here. Indian media is not praising this bit of Bollywood trash, but instead is denouncing it for what it is, anti-white hate propaganda. I wonder if the Australian media (or that of the West in general) is doing the same; or are our &ldquo;elites&rdquo; praising it as a thought-provoking exposé on Australian &ldquo;racism?&rdquo; </p>
<p>That is just something to think about.</p>
<p>Now as for Surya Shree Rajneesh and his nonsense, regarding nudity on Australian beaches, I believe it is hogwash and made up. While I have never been to Australia, I did do a Google search and found that only specific beaches are classified as nude, just like most other countries in the world. If he and his family found their way onto one, they probably went there on purpose to ogle and gawk about like fools. </p>
<p>That is Surya Shree Rajneesh is telling the truth, and is not just some white agent provocateur for the SPLC or some other pack of Reds just trying to cause trouble?</p>

		<p>The reason Australia gets a &#8220;racist&#8221; rap is because Asians want MASS non-white immigration into the country especially East Asians.  The &#8220;Australia is racist&#8221; meme is played regularly on East Asia media.  Non-white people know that if you guilt and shame white people long enough eventually white people will give in.  This meme that non-white people should have access to everything of white people&rsquo;s and anything less is &#8220;racist&#8221; is a global meme.  It started with black slaves in America wanting total access to white society.  Through the power of American media those ideas born from black slaves has traveled the world.  Don&rsquo;t give in.</p>

<p>Different countries have different views on nudity and what is acceptable in public. Some tribes in South America for example live almost completely nude.</p>

		<p>Courtney-I have news for any of those Indians ridiculing any so-called &#8220;redneck&#8221;. The biggest redneck in the country lives 20 times better than the average Indian. I&rsquo;ve known some Indians who have an arrogance about them and I think why???? My father has been to India and he says much of it is a hellhole. Indians have no right to ridicule anyone!!!!!!</p>

		<p>This movie could never be banned in a multi cultural society like France. See the difference?<br>
The more whites are somewhere and the higher percentage of them is, the more they are able to make politics for themselves. </p>
<p>Yesterday I read a very interesting article about the money in a German left-wing newspaper. One sentence was great: <br>
&#8220;&hellip; and more and more they (politicians) come to realize that multiculturalism doesn&rsquo;t work.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a left-wing newspaper!</p>
<p>The point is, we have to keep some white places white. The problem of multiculturalism is a matter of time. A friend told me how there are big conflicts between wealthy whites in Argentina and poor Indians around them in the slums. Fact is: More and more people and young people realize double standards and race differences because they grow up with them. The point is what will be faster: The realization of race difference and anti-white politics of their hippie parents or the ongoing process of none-whites going into every place where whites are.</p>
<p>In France, virtually every young man and women knows it because they have to deal with black people every day and can&rsquo;t get out at night -only because of blacks. </p>

		<p>Hopefully this will discourage Indians from going to Australia.  I hope they make a Bollywood movie about how horrible and racist Canada is too.  Canada doesn&rsquo;t need any more immigrants, and I&rsquo;m sure Australia doesn&rsquo;t either.  </p>

<p>Yes John, our friend Surya is making this up. There are classified nude beaches here (I don&rsquo;t even know where they are, but they are designated areas for nudists) but there is no nudity on the big &#8216;holiday&rsquo; beaches. I even read about a &#8216;peeping-tom&rsquo; that was arrested on the outskirts of a &#8216;nudist beach&rsquo;, with a pair of binoculars. So there are defined rules in place.</p>
<p>There has been a large influx of Indians, Africans and muslims in my neighbourhood in recent years and the way they all strut about like they own the joint they don&rsquo;t look like they are having it tough.<br>
As a side note, I was waiting at a traffic light recently and an African man in trck-gear stopped right in the middle of the footpath on a main road and urinated right there. Didn&rsquo;t even bother to make an effort to conceal himself. </p>

		<p>The stereotype of an Indian in Australia, usually in a major city is something like this:</p>
<p>Illegal immigrant, often student or tourist visa overstayer, lives with up to 10 or 12 other Indians in a small rented house in a poorer suburb. They are here taking university places and jobs that should go to Australian young people. They are present here in Australia in seemingly excesive numbers. They come from a country which is little better than a filthy cesspit. They get work here as taxi drivers, but you wouldn&rsquo;t want your wife, sister or daughter to take a ride with them.In other words not the most likeable people in town.</p>
<p>While I will never agree with Indian ( or any other) bashing this is yet another example of official immigration policy out of touch with the public&rsquo;s wishes as well as another example of multiculturalism that does not, and will not, ever work.</p>
<p>As for the film&rsquo;s view of Australia, good for a bit of a laugh while some Aussies may just say &#8220;great mate!&#8221;</p>
<p>AND having said all of this I do congratulate India on it&rsquo;s successful staging of the recent Commonwealth Games.Well done.<br>

		<p>In all probability an Australian made film dealing with the same subject would be just as white-hating.This is certainly the case in the mother country where every screen mugger is a white skinhead,and locally born asians like Meera Syall are allowed to depict their English neighbours as uniformly stupid and violent(&#8220;Anita and Me&#8221;).</p>

		<p>Has anyone on here watched the new sitcom &#8220;Outsourced&#8221;? I liked it at first, but after watching the third episode, I think I am finished with it. </p>
<p>The hot, attractive, young white male American character working in India, has suddenly developed an interest in the most &#8220;attractive&#8221; Indian woman in his office.  </p>
<p>The episode started where he and a bunch of his co-workers (both Western and Indian) went out to eat together.  The hot attractive American male character made it clear in one of the earlier episodes that he doesn&rsquo;t get emotionally attached to women too quickly (which is the way God made most men anyways).  </p>
<p>Despite all this, this American guy continues to flirt with the attractive Indian woman at the table, even though she made it clear that she can only date someone who her parents pick for her to marry.  The episode ends where this naive white man still continues to pursue her, when I personally think she really wasn&rsquo;t worth the bother.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, there was a blonde female Australian character in the episode who is trying to win this man&rsquo;s effection too.  Yet, he ignores her until the very end of the episode when the Indian woman makes it clear she isn&rsquo;t interested, and the white blonde Australian woman has to throw herself at him and tell him she is available for sex.</p>
<p>I am done watching this sitcom for a few reasons, but the main reason is that I see this as a slam against white women.  </p>
<p>First of all, the attractive Indian woman in this sitcom is hardly attractive by Western standards.  She is attractive by Indian standards. She has the stereotypical extra large eyes, and bird beaked nose.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the blonde Australian woman should be 10 times more appealing in the looks department from any sane white man&rsquo;s perspective.  So I don&rsquo;t understand why the white American didn&rsquo;t develop an interest in the Australian woman first before he knew anything about her personality.</p>
<p>Second, what white American male around the age of 30, would waste his time, while living in India, trying to pursue an Indian woman who has made it clear that she can only date a man her parents choose for her to marry?  In America, that statement would send any man running (which would be understandable), but that is beside the point.  And why do they make the hot Australian woman so desperate for his attention, that the only way she wins him over is by offering sex?</p>
<p>What a waste of time.  I think I am going to stick to watching &#8220;The Office&#8221; on Thursday nights.  That is another politically correct sitcom in some ways, but at least most of the characters are white.</p>

If these stereotypes discourage Indians from moving to Australia, I&rsquo;m all for it.</p>

		<p>There should be more awareness about goes on<br>
in Asian Media (and Circles) as regards Asians<br>
criticizing White People. I really notice Asians have adopted Black American Slander, or insult terms for White People like &#8220;White trash&#8221;. &#8220;Redneck&#8221;, &#8220;Inbred&#8221;. </p>
<p>I also notice some Asians particular hostility towards Anglo Whites, and Northern Europeans in general. Some Asians <br>
like the Southern European Cultures, and Jewish culture, etc.<br>
Also, I&rsquo;ve  noticed Asian Women can be quite jealous of Blonde White Women.</p>

		<p>Yes, it is true that the majority of attacks on Indians in Australia are from Arabs and Africans.  I feel bad for Indians because their culture is, by and large, a bit on the feminine side with regards to males, and most Indians being either short or less than burly doesn&rsquo;t help.</p>
<p>But it works the same there as it does in America.  Here in America, it&rsquo;s latinos who are ethnically cleansing blacks from so many areas, and it is blacks who are attacking whites far, far more than the other way around, yet everything you hear in the media or in public is skewed to make it seem as if evil white racists are prowling around everywhere hurting minorities.</p>
<p>This is just how it&rsquo;s all rolling and it&rsquo;s controlled and promoted by white liberals who have some bizarre fixation with non-whites as something like little helpless natives in need of protecting.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Yes, it is true that the majority of attacks on Indians in Australia are from Arabs and Africans&#8221;.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s incredible about that is that whites are still something like 85% of the population in Australia, with East Asians (Orientals) being the next most populous group. At least incredible for those who get their information from the mainstream media and the nations teacher unions. Even in a nation where, if everything were equal, well over 90% of the attacks would be from Whites or Asians, still the greater number of total attacks are from Arabs and Africans. Or course this information (and all figures) will be used to show that whites )and their societies) are the bad guys. Asians get an honorary pass even though they are the least violent group. </p>
