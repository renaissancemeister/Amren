<h1><a href="http://www.wtop.com/?sid=2085844&amp;nid=213">Hispanic Media Influence Grows in Election Year</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Laura Wides-Munoz, WTOP-FM (Washington, D.C.), October 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Spanish-language networks and publications are taking on a more prominent role this election season, nabbing debates with major candidates and increasingly seeing their political coverage spin out into mainstream English-language media.</p>
<p>The attention highlights not only the growing influence of Hispanics, the nation&rsquo;s largest and fastest-growing minority group, but also the power of the companies that provide much of their news.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Even those who toe a hard line on immigration are seeking to make their case in Spanish-language media, recognizing that they need some Hispanic votes to win and that Hispanics  &mdash;  who account for 9 percent of registered voters nationwide  &mdash;  are concerned about more than that one issue.</p>
<p>During Florida&rsquo;s primary season, for example, Republican gubernatorial candidates Rick Scott and Bill McCollum had their first debate on Univision, even as they competed to see who could stake out the harshest stance against illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tighter the race  &mdash;  and there are many this year  &mdash;  the more you reach out to niche constituents, and Latinos are niche constituents,&#8221; said Texas State University Professor Federico Subervi and author of the &#8220;The Mass Media and Latino Politics.</p>
<p>Subervi believes the interest in Hispanic media is particularly high for a midterm election because the Arizona immigration law has become such a hot topic.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also the result of a concerted effort by companies like Univision to &#8220;plant the flag and reach out to mainstream political figures,&#8221; said Jose Cancela, head of the Miami-based marketing firm Hispanic USA.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Univision Networks President Cesar Conde has made political coverage a top priority, beginning with the company&rsquo;s first presidential debate in 2008. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to step up our efforts to ensure that the Hispanic swing vote is best equipped to make responsible and informed decisions,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company will also run a get out the vote effort across all its shows Tuesday and has declined to air Republican-backed ads urging Hispanics not to vote for any congressional representatives in response to Washington&rsquo;s failure to pass any immigration reform.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Spanish-language media, particularly TV, holds sway among so many Hispanics in part because mainstream media has often ignored them, except when it came to crime or immigration. For years, it was the only place where Hispanics, even those who prefer to communicate in English, could see themselves reflected.</p>
<p>Still, when it comes to Hispanic media, immigration remains a top draw both for its core audience and for those looking to take the pulse of the Hispanic electorate.</p>

		<p>I think this is great. We left a country where we were barely able to survive and where human life had zero value to come to the United States, now they want us to turn the USA into the country we left, if we do where can we run to then. This is the end of the line. Vote conservative unless you miss the good old days in Mexico.</p>

		<p>These articles always raise that most obvious of all questions - exactly which &#8220;American&#8221; VOTERS need to be catered to in a foreign language? That this seems not to strike either the media or the various candidates themselves as problematic or odd, is evidence enough of how far down the tubes this county is.  </p>

		<p>What is curious is how the Puerto Rican community is incited to support the Mexican amnesty issue.  Puerto Ricans are all US citizens whether born in the states or Puerto Rico.  Further the Mexicans are displacing the Puerto Ricans in the lower echelon jobs.  And the communities tolerate each other but do not integrate.  Yet amnesty is a rallying cry for Puerto Ricans a group not known for promoting generalize civil rights issues.  This is ethno-centric to an extreme and contrary to both self-interest or higher moral issues.  <br>
One wonders if the Puerto Rican population was not the beneficiary of cash social programs, whether they would be so supportive.</p>

<p> You make a good point Jose. Most legal immigrants from Latin America left to get away from the chronic corruption, poverty, environmental degradation, ethnic/racial conflicts (particularly in the Andean region) and ramped crime. It seems like in the near future, due to uncontrolled immigration; immigrants will leave Latin America only to come to Latin America. We need a time out on immigration to assimilate the people who are here already. Parts of the South West are already beginning to resemble Mexico. </p>

		<p>If a politician is speaking Spanish and trying to &#8216;reach out to hispanics&rsquo;, then he/she is not in favor of stopping illegal immigration.  Picture a president in the 40s speaking against Hitler and Japan, yet trying to &#8216;reach out&rsquo; to the German and Japanese citizens in the US.  People would have called them traitors back then.  That is exactly what you have today with politicians catering to illegal immigrants.  Don&rsquo;t sit here and tell me you are against illegal immigration, yet you are telling me to learn Spanish and be their friend. Uh-uh.  Ain&rsquo;t gonna happen, amigo.</p>

		<p>Last night I saw another very offensive &#8220;inclusive&#8221; TV commercial.  It was all about remembering how delicious Mom&rsquo;s American pot roast was, but the &#8220;family&#8221; was Hispanic. </p>
<p>Shrewd ploy, that, combining messages of Americanism with the invasion of non Whites.  Purpose is to dilute our White Awareness of our differences from non American non Whites.</p>
<p>The people behind it should keep their feelings to themselves or only share their anti white hatred with their psychiatrists or public relations hack.<br>
