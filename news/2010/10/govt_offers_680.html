<h1>Gov&rsquo;t Offers $680 Million for Indian Farmers</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mary Clare Jalonick, Seattle Post-Intelligencer, October 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The government is offering American Indian farmers who say they were denied farm loans a $680 million settlement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The agreement also includes $80 million in farm debt forgiveness for the Indian plaintiffs and a series of initiatives to try and alleviate racism against American Indians and other minorities in rural farm loan offices. Individuals who can prove discrimination could receive up to $250,000.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The lawsuit filed in 1999 contends Indian farmers and ranchers lost hundreds of millions of dollars over several decades because they were denied USDA loans that instead went to their white neighbors. The government settled a similar lawsuit filed by black farmers more than a decade ago.</p>
<p>Unlike a second round of the black farmers suit that is now pending in Congress, the American Indian money would not need legislative action to be awarded.</p>
<p>The Obama administration has said settling the American Indian case is a priority. Hispanics and women farmers also have pending cases.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today&rsquo;s settlement can never undo wrongs that Native Americans may have experienced in past decades, but combined with the actions we at USDA are taking to address such wrongs, the settlement will provide some measure of relief to those who have been discriminated against,&#8221; Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement.</p>
<p>Claryca Mandan of North Dakota&rsquo;s Three Affiliated Tribes, a plaintiff in the case, stopped ranching after she and her husband were denied loans in the early 1980s. She said she was pleased with the settlement.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a culmination of 30 years of struggle,&#8221; she said.<br>

		<p>What about reparations for all those who THOUGHT about becoming farmers but who were afraid they MIGHT be denied loans?  Weren&rsquo;t their feelings hurt?</p>
<p>Seriously, does this mean every white farmer who was denied a loan can get compensation? </p>
<p>Since when is a loan a golden right?  A loan is a temporary gift based on certain financial criteria that must be repaid.  If you don&rsquo;t get it, it must be something wrong with your finances or ability to pay.</p>
<p>I wonder how many Indian millionaires are going to be created with this?  How many blacks were made millionaires before?  </p>
<p>How many women farmers are there out there?  How many Latinos own farms?  Don&rsquo;t worry, the millions will flow!</p>

		<p>There is an election coming, and no amount of your money is too much to spend in the quest to get more people to vote Democratic.   Obama is literally tossing truckloads of your money out in every direction.  </p>
<p>I wonder where else he might be able to buy some votes?  How about Social Security recipients, that might work.</p>

		<p>When are we Whites going to sue the government for taking our money and giving it to nonwhites that WE supported (taxes) for most of our lives? I will bet most of these cases are full of fraud just like the black &#8220;farmers&#8221; cases were. Our own government is stealing us blind to hand over hundreds of  thousands to each of these &#8220;farmers&#8221; and we do NOTHING about it?</p>
<p>Cannot most Whites see what is really happening to our race in our own country?  Obviously not, or they are so beaten down with &#8221; false guilt&#8221; that they think they deserve to be fleeced. Just like what they did to the German people after the war. Beat them down into submission through force. </p>

		<p>This present administration contains more bigots, kooks, flakes and oddballs than Moveon.org.</p>
<p>They begin with the premise that all non-whites have been descriminated against and all whites have been given all life has to offer on a silver platter, and they act accordingly.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the evilist bunch of misfits that ever slithered the face of the earth.</p>

		<p>And of course, the denial of the loans had NOTHING  to do with the credit-worthiness of the applicants, right?  Nah, nothing at all, I&rsquo;m sure.  So here we go&hellip;.another payoff to minorities involving real estate loans without taking into account that maybe they don&rsquo;t deserve the loans in the first place, or are committing fraud, or never intended to farm.  Farming is hard work.  Evokes memories of blacks forced to work in the fields.  Requires getting up early, and often working after sundown.  I seriously doubt there are all that many blacks (or native americans) who wanted to truly farm and were denied the opportunity.  </p>

		<p>I think 1-Jay is onto something. I once thought about farming as a livelihood (for about four minutes) but was put off by the required investment.  The government hadn&rsquo;t even bothered to notify we aspiring farmers of the availability of low interest loans, which would have made my (admittedly short-lived) dream a reality.  </p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m owed that loan with automatic forgiveness by way of compensation for our government&rsquo;s cruel heartlessness in denying me the opportunity of fulfilling my agricultural dream.</p>

		<p>Well, after we go down the almost endless list of discriminated-against minorities, where&rsquo;s the concern for the would be/failed farmers, whoever,who will be left out because of their sexual orientation.  Where are those obnoxious, pathetic, always babbling spokesmen for the Lesbian, gays, bisexual, transgendered, gender confused, ad nauseaum, when we really need them?  This is blatant discrimination on the part of those bigots and homophobes in the Obama administration.</p>

White males. you know the ones who actually farmed and produced food. They are still struggling and having their farms seized by agribusineses colluding with the FDA .</p>

		<p>Whenever some black gets on tv and whines about discrimination or needing more government help, remember what Booker T. Washington said back over 100 years ago, &#8220;There is a class of colored people who make a business of keeping the troubles, the wrongs, and the hardships of the Negro race before the public. Some of these people do not want the Negro to lose his grievances, because they do not want to lose their jobs. There is a certain class of race-problem solvers who don&rsquo;t want the patient to get well.&#8221; </p>
