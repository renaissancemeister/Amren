<h1><a href="https://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sports/2013159379_apusolemissmascot.html">And the Winner Is: The Ole Miss &#8216;Rebel Black Bear&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Shelia Byrd and David Brandt, Seattle Times, October 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It has been more than a decade since the University of Mississippi began stripping away its images of the Old South. Confederate battle flags  &mdash;  the &#8220;Stars and Bars&#8221;  &mdash;  were first to go. Next was mascot &#8220;Colonel Reb,&#8221; the goateed Southern planter who cheered on the Rebels from the sidelines since 1979.</p>
<p>After seven years and plenty of bickering, his successor was named Thursday: &#8220;Rebel Black Bear&#8221; won 62 percent of the vote in a final poll and will become the new face of the school&rsquo;s athletic programs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the end, the smiling black bear inspired in part by longtime Oxford resident William Faulkner won out, defeating two other nominees: the &#8220;Rebel Land Shark,&#8221; based on the &#8220;fins up&#8221; hand motion started by late Rebel football player Tony Fein; and the &#8220;Hotty Toddy,&#8221; a gray human-like character that aimed to personify a school cheer.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&rsquo;s hypocrisy. I think the fans of Ole Miss still want Colonel Reb. We have a petition with 3,500 signatures of students who still want Colonel Reb as their mascot and that&rsquo;s the way it should be,&#8221; said Brian Ferguson, a 2007 graduate who is also a member of the Colonel Reb Foundation.</p>
<p>Brittany Garth, a student from Dallas, said she wished the school didn&rsquo;t have a mascot.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just think it&rsquo;s kind of dumb. Why is our mascot a bear when we&rsquo;re the Rebels? It doesn&rsquo;t make a lot of sense to me. That&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t vote. None of the three choices made any sense,&#8221; Garth said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The black bear is connected to Ole Miss through one of the state&rsquo;s famous sons, Nobel Prize-winning novelist William Faulkner, who penned &#8220;The Bear.&#8221; In it, Old Ben stands as a symbol of pride, strength and toughness. The tale of the &#8220;teddy bear&#8221; originated with the story that President Teddy Roosevelt refused to shoot a bear on a Mississippi hunt in 1902.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Though licensing of Colonel Reb&rsquo;s image ended this summer, he can still be found on bumper stickers, lapel pins and other merchandise on display at Rebel games. A variation of the colonel first appeared in the 1930s in a yearbook. The image of the white character in a red wide-brimmed hat and tuxedo, leaning on a cane, is believed to have been based on a black man named Blind Jim Ivy, who attended most of the school&rsquo;s athletic events, according to school historian David Sansing. The colonel made the official transition to the field in 1979.</p>
<p>Renderings of the new mascot show the burly black bear wearing a blue sports jacket for appearances on the campus and a dressed in a football jersey or a basketball uniform for games.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Roy Yarbrough, a professor at California University of Pennsylvania who consults with schools on choosing new mascots and symbols, said Ole Miss could spend $100,000 or more for costumes, letterhead and marketing fees.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;If no one accepts the new mascot, Colonel Reb could make a comeback,&#8221; he said.<br>

		<p>Pretty soon anything Southern or even vaguely Confederate will be banned. One little mistake by the writers of the article- the &#8220;stars and bars&#8221; is NOT the Confederate Battle Flag but the first national flag. It was mistaken for the Stars and Stripes in the heat of battle so it was replaces by the second national flag. </p>
<p>If you google &#8220;censored Loony Toons&#8221; you will see just how &#8220;offensive&#8221; Southern themes were to Ted Turner. Also Disney still hasnt released &#8220;Song of the South&#8221; to the US market- you can find the film on Ebay from overseas suppliers. </p>

		<p>I just put the first comment up at the original article.  Of course I had to church it up a little, but my point is valid.  No one cares when whites are upset.  Only blacks, hispanics, etc. can be offended.  And we all know that we cannot upset them.  I hate the double standards and hope to see some positive feedback at the original article.  I know how we all think here.  But people in Seattle (I know a few that moved there) are extremely liberal, which is explained by my favorite quote ever.</p>

		<p>A bear? For Ole Miss? Why don&rsquo;t they just burn to the ground all state universities South of Washington D.C.? It was bad enough to have my fraternity KA being forced into becoming P.C. But a bear at Ole Miss? There is only one word to describe this treatment of a great university - disgusting!</p>

I&rsquo;d love to see a thriving black (is that racist?) market for Colonel Reb wear.</p>
<p>At the first game with the new official mascot, I&rsquo;d love to see the stadium filled with fans wearing Colonel Reb wear.</p>
<p>What I would most like to see is everyone boycotting the games. Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s not going to happen. <br>

		<p>While a Yankee, I find this Southern-style, PC on campus nonsense to be obnoxious. The Rebel moniker is about one thing: the Confederacy. Despite significant migration from the West and North, and from overseas, the South still contains large numbers of people of Confederate descent.And that is a recognized group to all but black nationalists and Lincolnesqe Nazis who endorse the mass murder the US govt launched against eleven sovereign states. The faults of the Confederacy are fair game; its honorable side is not. Look at where we are today! How would it have turned out if the Union had sought an amicable seperation the South? Couldn&rsquo;t have been much worse than the current racial and cultural anarchy we suffer in the warm glow of &#8220;Union&#8221;.</p>
<p>Faulkner, by the way, would have been appalled by the tasteless rejection of Mississippi&rsquo;s past shown by the gutless administration and State govt. What a nerve,to use his &#8220;Bear&#8221; symbol as a way to make the Rebel mascot palatable to blacks and whites incapable of reading a daily newspaper let alone Absolam Absolam or Sound and the Fury. He had mixed feelings about the South&rsquo;s traditions; he never rejected them.</p>

		<p>Spartan24: I like to watch the old classic film, &#8220;This is the Army&#8221;, which has a fabulous Minstrel Show number, as part of the &#8220;Soldiers&rsquo; Show&#8221;, which was put on during World War II, as relief. </p>
<p>My kids loved this movie, especially the Minstrel Show, with the giant banjo in the background. Their cousins loved it, as did the Neighbors&rsquo; kids, which showed these young minds how exactly Blacks were viewed in our Country, not so long ago. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important that our youth have a good foundation on the truth, and the old Classic films do that in spades.  </p>

<p>Oh it&rsquo;s even worse than that. The criteria is slavery and racism. After they finish with the Confederate symbols and the South I wonder what they might go after next? Hmmmm slavery? racism? Wasn&rsquo;t George Washington and most of the other founders slave holders? What else in American history is &#8216;tainted&rsquo; with the &#8216;stains&rsquo; slavery and/or racism? I am sorry but white people are naive and stupid if they think it will stop with the Confederacy or even be limited to just the South.</p>

		<p>Back before &#8216;diversity&rsquo; encouraged us to divest ourselves of residential rental property, we used to have a number of Gay tenants (they were better than the alternatives, believe me).  The more low-end among them seemed to consider Teddy Bears as ideal accessories for their homes.  And there is a movement among them to appreciate plump, hairy men.  Those men are called &#8216;Bears&rsquo;  Gay coffee table literature included a &#8216;Bear&rsquo; magazine.  The cover I saw heralded &#8220;Black Bears!&#8221; oh boy&hellip;</p>
<p>Now, when I hear &#8220;The Ole Miss Black Bears&#8221;, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll be seeing.  A friend from my old Investment Club just called, laughing about the news.  That&rsquo;s the first thing she thought of, too.  If that school weren&rsquo;t already a joke, their new mascot would make them into one.</p>
<p>That school just keeps on getting more pitiful.</p>
<p>If they absolutely have to have a mascot, why can&rsquo;t it be a stylized &#8220;Ole Miss&#8221;?  Maybe Playboy would license their old &#8216;Granny&rsquo; cartoon character to be adapted as a mascot. I think she&rsquo;s be just precious, dancing and jiggling all over the field.</p>
<p>So what is the &#8216;Black Bears&rsquo; new theme tune going to be?  The title song from the 1936 movie SAN FRANCISCO?  </p>

		<p> As long as they are contorting themselves to appease the PC crowd, they should have stuck with the shark.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a matter of time until someone will question why the bear has to be BLACK.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll soon hear the howls.</p>

		<p>The first I heard of this travesty was on Fox News a while ago.  Shepard Smith, an alumnus of Ole Miss, approvingly reported there would be a mascot change and added that it was past time to retire Colonel Reb.  I notifed Fox News that Smith would be retired from from his 3pm and 7pm time slots at my home.</p>
<p>At one time Ole Miss was proudly steeped in Southern tradition and boasted the world&rsquo;s largest Confederate battle flag; brought out onto the football field at half-time to a rousing rendition of &#8220;Dixie.&#8221;  Now fans are discouraged from bringing the small flags individuals used to wave enthusiastically from their seats; those short wooden dowel rods to which they were stapled have been determined to be hazards at sporting events.  And I believe the school band&rsquo;s playing of &#8220;Dixie&#8221; has been similarly declared off-limits.</p>
<p>Since the affectionate nickname &#8220;Ole Miss&#8221; is the term black slaves used in referring  &mdash;  respectfully if not endearingly  &mdash;  to the senior white lady on every antebellum plantation, we can pretty well predict the fate of this tradition as well.  </p>
<p>Piece by precious piece our culture is being dismantled before our very eyes; seemingly with our consent. </p>

		<p>Another small piece of Southern White culture and history wiped from existence because of PC.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for us all, the process is relentless and not limited to the elimination of cartoonish sports mascots.  Whites and their culture are slowly being wiped away from the world scene.  Every success emboldens our opponents, and even trivial exercises in feel-goodery like eliminating Colonel Reb, help make the next milestone easier to achieve.  </p>
<p>Out of morbid curiosity I checked out some images of &#8220;Rebel Black Bear&#8221;, and he is doubtless one of the most vapidly idiotic and pointless characters in all of American pop culture.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as the much-maligned White alumni of Ole Miss breathe a sigh of relief and hope that their sordid past is now behind them, they&rsquo;ll go home and watch their TV set and happily ignore the incredible anti-White propaganda campaign that saturates every program they watch.  Their young daughters will eagerly watch the commercials for the particularly egregious &#8220;DJ Hero&#8221; and it&rsquo;s &#8220;Mix2Gether&#8221; campaign, and many of those White folks will happily buy that product for their children as a Christmas &#8220;gift&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to wake up, folks.  There&rsquo;s a lot more to this than the elimination of cartoon characters.  You and your children are being deliberately targeted for elimination.  Why, WHY do you continue to support it with acquiescence and dollars?</p>
