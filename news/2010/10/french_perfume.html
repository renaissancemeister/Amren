<h1>French Perfume Designer Under Fire for Racial Slur</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CNN, October 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>French anti-racism group SOS-Racisme plans to file a legal complaint against perfume designer Jean-Paul Guerlain following a racist remark he made on French television.</p>
<p>Guerlain  &mdash;  who is no longer connected with the perfume company that bears his name  &mdash;  made the remarks during an interview with France 2 on Friday about his career and the making of Samsara, one of his famous perfumes he created to impress a woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;One day I told her  &mdash;  and I still called her Madame  &mdash;  &#8216;What would seduce you if one was to make a perfume for you?&rsquo; and she told me, &#8216;I love jasmine, rose and sandalwood,&rsquo;&#8221; Guerlain recalled.</p>
<p>&#8220;And for once I started working like a [racial epithet]. I don&rsquo;t know if [racial epithet] ever worked that hard,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Guerlain issued an apology following the interview&rsquo;s broadcast, which a France 2 anchor read during the network&rsquo;s evening newscast.</p>
<p>&#8220;My words do not reflect in any way my profound thoughts but are due to an inopportune misspeaking which I vividly regret,&#8221; the apology read.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>SOS-Racisme said it is not satisfied with Guerlain&rsquo;s apology and will bring action against him. Guerlain could be issued a fine if the complaint goes before a magistrate.</p>
<p>Louis-Georges Tin, a spokesman for the Council Representative of Black Associations, told French radio RTL that his group also will join in the complaint.</p>
<p>&#8220;{snip} These comments are racist, of course, which harken back to the colonial period and it seems unacceptable. For now, we are planning to file a complaint,&#8221; he [Tin] said.</p>

		<p>Simple resolution, find out if [racial epithet] had ever worked that hard. If, in fact, they hadn&rsquo;t worked that hard then he was simply stating a fact &amp; not an opinion. But, if we were to find out they had worked as hard or possibly harder, then he absolutely owes [racial epithet] an apology.</p>

		<p>Never apologize!  You just make matters worse for yourself.  Say nothing- let them wear themselves out demanding your apology.  Just stand pat, and some other smuck will violate the taboo and start getting all the attention sooner or later.</p>

		<p>Anti-racists believe they are constantly under attack, and anyone that might so much as whisper anything &ldquo;racist&rdquo; will be made example of. European nations like to claim they have &ldquo;free speech&rdquo; and are tolerant societies, but they only tolerate what they like and anything else is unacceptable. The beauty of freedom is that it is for everyone, even those you disagree with, but European nations don&rsquo;t get this.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not as if she&rsquo;s burned out cars all over town and called for killings or the overthrow of the government. If she&rsquo;d done that, the &#8216;anti-racists&rsquo; would say we need to show her more tolerance. </p>

		<p>This stuff will be here soon.  Will everyone PLEASE promise never again to vote for a democrat/liberal/socialist/marxist (they are all the same thing).  It&rsquo;s the only way to possibly get this country back on track before it&rsquo;s too late, and it might be too late very soon.  Please, please, please, please.</p>

		<p>What would motivate someone to say this on national TV with the fear of criminal prosecution and civil lawsuits hanging over them?  We&rsquo;ve heard plenty of similar stories like this where someone says something racial and then backs down in the face of overwhelmingly opposition.  Isn&rsquo;t it likely that many of these events are staged?  Perhaps they&rsquo;re trying to portray the right as weak and ineffectual or incite other people to say such things and swoop in for the kill. Nothing is as it seems.</p>

		<p>Racial epithets are inappropriate. And I&rsquo;ve had plenty thrown at me. But none of these Anti Racist TM groups ever protested on my behalf. Still, if one finds himself the victim of a witch hunt it&rsquo;s best not to admit to being a witch by groveling. They&rsquo;ll just burn you anyway. It&rsquo;s better to show some cajones.</p>

		<p>How does a person (in authority) ascertain what penalty has to be applied (financial or otherwise) when someone says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for once I started working like a [racial epithet]. I don&rsquo;t know if [racial epithet] ever worked that hard,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The chap who uttered this statement has already apologised. Therefore, that should be the end of it, yes?<br>
Even if a few shrinking-violets have had their feelings hurt and lodge a complaint, after the apology, it&rsquo;s not worth a half of a franc!<br>
The judge should hear their silly complaint, band his (or her) gavel very hard and throw them out of the courtroom!</p>

		<p>Well, the term comes from the days that {racial epithet}s USED to work very hard.<br>
You know, back in the days when they were made to, were afraid not to, and no such thing as welfare existed.  Back in the days when we all &#8220;had our minds right&#8221; as the warden in Cool Hand Luke liked to say.  Oh!  Horrible racist to say such a thing! somebody will say.  Okay, let me ask you&hellip;..WHEN were blacks in America productive, stayed family oriented, unlikely to commit crimes especially murder of themselves or others, absolutely NOT committing rapes of white women, and dying to have ANY kind of educational opportunities?  Back then?  Or now?  Has there been ANY evidence of any of that in the black communities since 1960?  If blacks show ANY inclination toward academic achievement today, it&rsquo;s for one of two reasons largely - either hoping college football will lead to lucrative pro football, or because college campuses are target rich environments of silly liberal white girls susceptible to black advances.</p>

		<p>Funny.  The nuts over at CNN are such sensitive, politically-correct maniacs they couldn&rsquo;t even tell us exactly what [racial epithet] was used.  The N-word, I&rsquo;m guessing?  Or maybe kaffir (because the black man at the end mentioned something about the colonial period - and I know kaffir was a common word for blacks in Africa back then).</p>
