<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Backstage.com listing:<blockquote>PRESIDENT OBAMA TOWN HALL, MTV</p>
<p>MTV, BET and CMT are casting the audience for town hall meeting with President Obama. Shooting Oct. 14, 4 p.m. in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>{snip}<br>
</blockquote>Kelly McAndrew, a spokeswoman for Viacom, which owns MTV, said the screening was aimed at attracting a diverse audience.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re just trying to get the broadest, most diverse audience possible,&#8221; she said, {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re going to have a very diverse looking audience,&#8221; McAndrew said. &#8220;We want gender diversity, we want ethnicity diversity, we want religious diversity, we want political view diversity. We want diversity of all kinds.&#8221;<br>

<p>Why am I skeptical of this one?</p>
<p>Marxists&rsquo; &#8220;tolerance&#8221; of &#8220;Diversity&#8221; somehow never extends as far as people who don&rsquo;t share their faith in the religion of Multicult.</p>

		<p>So what, I assume that having a &#8216;I voted for Obama&rsquo; bumper sticker won&rsquo;t be enough to crash this &lsquo;identity politics&rsquo; private party.<br>
Unless you are able to pass the brown paper bag test (circa 2010), are perhaps wearing a Catholic Cardinal&rsquo;s hat or Burqa (MTV VJ shouts out &#8220;give it up for Viacom and Obama Muslim Americans!&#8221;) or you belong within the diverse political spectrum ranging between being a registered ACORN supporter to being the type of person who believes Karl Marx was a moderate.<br>
 <br>
I suppose they call this subversive &#8216;positive&rsquo; profiling exercise a marketing strategy.<br>
Did Chairman Mao&rsquo;s or Joseph Stalin&rsquo;s propaganda producers blatantly advertise for casting calls like this in their productions? Maybe they did, I don&rsquo;t know. But sometimes the older I get, the more naïve I feel I must be.<br>

		<p>MTV and BET are involved, yet they say they want all kinds of diversity   &mdash;   &#8220;gender diversity, we want ethnicity diversity, we want religious diversity, we want political view diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>But not diversity of IQ.  All two-digit.  Lower half of the bell curve, por favor.</p>

Does anyone believe that the people standing behind the president when he gives speeches is an unstaged cross section of America?</p>
<p>When it comes to multiCULTuralism, we don&rsquo;t see objective reality, we see the reality they want us to believe.</p>

		<p>The important thing about this is that Obama doesn&rsquo;t dare give an actual town hall meeting.  He has to hire actors.</p>
<p>There will come a time when he can&rsquo;t even get people to pretend to support him in exchange for money anymore.</p>

		<p>Poor Kelly. How can you be such an invariant in the multicult-matrix?<br>
Political view diversity? That&rsquo;s ignoble sarcasm without even knowing it. <br>
When people like us speak our mind we face hysteria and violence.<br>
When we gather, we don&rsquo;t need an Orwellian fabrication of the crowd. <br>
I bet you support miscegenation. What about diversity? Miscegenation reduces diversity - it goes from two colors to one.</p>

		<p>Wow what a bunch of nothing. The tragedy is that these folks are united by nothing but diversity. Blacks supporting black interests, gays supporting gay interests, liberals of every ilk from environmentalism to abortion. </p>
<p>There is no common thread uniting any of these people they are not bound by anything common among them. This is identity politics at its worst. These people don&rsquo;t realize how helpless they are with their selfish interests and no real common ground. </p>

		<p>MTV is now known as &#8220;trash TV&#8221; and for the President of the United States to even show up on MTV to have a Town Hall type meeting shows how desperate he is and how low he has sunk, not to mention having no class whatsoever.  <br>
   MTV used to actually play music videos at one time but then Sumner Redstone ( head of Viacom ) got his liberal politically correct dirty hands on it and turned MTV into a circus act. MTV is now used as a tool to destroy the brains of our youth with liberal Marxist ideology and this fits right in with Obama.      </p>

		<p>Unfortunately, this is done with every American President and candidate for the office. Audiences are hand-selected to appear near the Enlightened One depending on what the issue, location and desired message is.</p>

<p>I agree with you.  Maybe the first signs of this was Michelle Obama giving the Queen a hug, and The Enlightened One himself bowing to the Japanese emperor.  These people got into the White House without really knowing what sort of world they were entering.  But wouldn&rsquo;t you agree as well that giving much creedence to Rolling Stone magazine articles is a pretty good sign of the demise of image in journalism?  </p>
<p>Image is what it is all about - and ratings.  That is why the two big ones, CNN and Fox are competing so obviously, playing all the cards, especially race cards and the sex angles.</p>

		<p>Does anyone remember those people from the election campaign they&rsquo;d zero in on and you&rsquo;d see their glassy eyed stares of wonder as they were listening to one of Obama&rsquo;s speeches?  Or the people that would faint on que at a pivotal moment in his oratory?  It&rsquo;s nothing more than a Hollywood choreographed production.</p>

		<p>This is nothing new.  Many audiences are screened for the correct balance of ethnic diversity before the TV cameras roll.  It creates the illusion that all is well in our multi-ethnic empire.  This is 21st century America&rsquo;s Potemkin Village.   </p>
