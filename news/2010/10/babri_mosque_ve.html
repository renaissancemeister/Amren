<h1>Babri Mosque Verdict Displays Real Face of India</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Times of Kabul, October 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Religious leaders on Thursday condemned the decision of the Babri Mosque case by an Indian court, saying that the verdict has disclosed the real face of India.</p>
<p>&#8220;We condemn this verdict. We reject this as well. This will create resentment on an international level,&#8221; said Sahibzada Fazle Karim, who is a senior member of Jamiat Ulema-e-Pakistan (JUP). Talking to a private news channel, he said that the Organization of International Conference (OIC) should take serious steps.</p>
<p>He said that it is an international conspiracy and added that such a decision was not expected. Religious and sacred places are not safe in India.</p>
<p>Allama Abbas Kumaili said that the decision is unjustified. &#8220;We condemn the court&rsquo;s verdict.&#8221; He said that the court is under the influence of the majority (Hindus).</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a diplomatic decision,&#8221; said Chairman Ruet-e-Hilal Committee, Mufti Muneeb-ur-Rehman. He said that Indian Muslims should keep peace. &#8220;I appeal to Indian Muslims not to take to violence. The way of protests should be peaceful.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said India is a secular country and it had to respect the rights of minorities. Mufti Muneeb-ur-Rehman said that Muslims cannot worship where idols are placed.</p>
<p>And, Minister for Religious Affairs Hamid Saeed Kazmi said on Thursday that the Indian Court has issued a political verdict over Babri Mosque issue and termed it &#8220;totally in favour of the Hindu community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Muslims in India have been deprived of their right due to the one-sided decision on the Mosque, he told Pakistan Television. Kazmi said &#8220;the court cited Babri Mosque as a birth place of Ram and recommended a little piece of place for Muslims like a donation.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said the decision to equally distribute the land of mosque among Muslims, Hindus and state is quite complicated which would create problems for the faithful in offering prayers.</p>
<p>He asked the Indian Muslims to file an appeal against the decision in the Supreme Court, urging them to make more efforts for their rights.</p>
<p>The Minister said, &#8220;in Pakistan we have always raised voice against any injustice with the minority communities while in India the state is not showing solidarity with the Muslims&#8221;. Kazmi asked the people from all walks of life to raise their voice against the unjust decision.</p>
<p><b>Kaira on Minorities&rsquo; Security</b></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Qamar Zaman Kaira has said that minorities have full protection under Pakistan&rsquo;s constitution and the government was committed to ensure their security.</p>
<p>In a brief telephonic interview with a private television channel telecast Thursday the Minister said that the verdict of Indian court on Babri Mosque case would have no impact whatsoever on the minorities in Pakistan.</p>
<p>In Pakistan the minorities have equal rights and they are fully allowed to perform their religious rituals at their worship places he said adding it is the duty of government to protect their worship places.</p>
<p>Kaira said that the Indian judiciary would hopefully keep the sensitive nature of issue in mind while deciding the case on Babri Mosque.</p>
<p>To a question he said that security of Pakistani contingent participating in the Commonwealth Games in New Delhi is the responsibility of Indian authorities and they would hopefully ensure it.</p>
<p><b>The Verdict</b></p>
<p>An Indian court ruled Thursday that a disputed holy site in Ayodhya with a history of triggering Hindu-Muslim clashes should be divided  &mdash;  a judgement seen as favouring the Hindu litigants.</p>
<p>&#8220;All three sets of parties, i.e. Muslims, Hindus and (Hindu religious organisation) Nirmhoi Akhara are declared joint holders of the property in dispute,&#8221; Justice S.U. Khan said in a ruling on the website of the Allahabad High Court.</p>
<p>Several of the litigants in the case said they would appeal the judgement to the Supreme Court, meaning the already 60-year dispute will continue in India&rsquo;s notoriously slow justice system.</p>
<p>Some 200,000 police and paramilitary forces had been deployed ahead of the court verdict to pre-empt any violent reaction.</p>
<p>In 1992 the demolition of a 16th-century mosque on the Ayodhya site by Hindu activists sparked riots that killed more than 2,000 people, mostly Muslims, in some of the worst sectarian violence since partition of the Indian sub-continent in 1947.</p>
<p>The process to divide the site would begin in three months, the court said. A third will go to Muslims, a second part will become a temple for Hindus, while another third will go to the Ayodhya-based Nirmhoi Akhara.<br>

		<p>Is there anything that doesn&rsquo;t enrage Muslims? Just watched Hitchcock&rsquo;s own remake of &#8220;The Man Who Knew Too Much&#8221; w/James Stewart &amp; Doris Day. Stewart tells an Egyptian character that he doesn&rsquo;t want to offend; the guy tells Stewart that Muslims are easily offended.  </p>

		<p>India is, and always has been, for more than 5,000 years, a HINDU country.  The Muslims got their state when they took Pakistan from India, and they should be concentrated there.  Muslims do not belong in India; India and its Hinduism comprise the oldest system of religion on the planet, and in my view should be allowed to remain so.  There are no holy books that can even remotely compare to the Hindu Vedas, The Yoga-Sutra of Patanjali, the Upanishads, or the Bhaghavad Gita.  Allowing Muslims into India destroys the ancient traditions, which I see as criminal.  Muslims, go home - get out of India and leave it to the Hindus, its rightful owners!!</p>

		<p>Trying to keep the religion of peace from exploding into violence is pretty much a constant concern for many people around the world. Islam has been like that since it&rsquo;s early days right up into the present time. Note the threat of violence always being implied whenever they don&rsquo;t get a hundred percent of what they want, no compromise for them.   </p>

		<p> It&rsquo;s obvious that Muslims&rsquo; motto in such situations is the same as blacks&rsquo;: &#8220;Our way or the highway!&#8221; The writer also does not mention that Hindu activists demolished the mosque because they believe the site is the birthplace of one of the Hindu gods.</p>
<p> The kind of Hindu activism which has arisen in India in the last few decades stems directly from the aggressive pushing of the minority Muslims. Hindus haven&rsquo;t forgotten that the Muslim &#8220;Great Moguls&#8221; ruled their country for upwards of 200 years   &mdash;   sometimes with fairness toward the majority Hindus, but sometimes not.</p>

		<p>If anything, it&rsquo;s an insult to the Hindus who dont get to keep all of what was stolen by Muslims who in turn get to keep a huge chunk of what they stole because the Modernizing of Hindu society by Bollywood has firmly brought the Leftist non-Hindu-dominated Congress Party to power (the Indian equivalent to the Donkey-Democrats) at the expense of the Hindu nationalist BJP. Muslims are mentally just Africans with more discipline but every bit as banal &amp; spiritually toxic.</p>

		<p>What almost all muslims in the sub-continent never stop to consider for a moment is that their ancestors were Hindus who hated Islam and only &#8220;cpnverted&#8221; to it under conquest, enslavement and threat of death. The Pakistanis, Bengals and others have essentially been &#8216;colonized&rsquo; twice. Once by the Arabs and later by the British. The Hindus were only colonized once.</p>
<p>Also completely agree with GG at #1.</p>
<p>Muslims are VERY easily offended. In my experience people and cultures like this usually have an underlying inferiority complex and are over-compensating. Since all muslims are taught to believe the Koran is quite litterally the word of god and there is no &#8216;true&rsquo; religion but Islam they must act this way. If any self-doubt were to creep in the whole enormous edifice of Islam - which is their culture and lifestyle - would crumble. They must believe that they are &#8220;right&#8221; in their beliefs because the consequences of them being wrong (that Islam is an invented Arab cult) are to great to accept.</p>

		<p>So this decision is not pleasing to everyone?</p>
<p>There were two Hindu judges on the court and one Muslim. A compromise was struck that will please NO ONE!</p>
<p>When you try to please everyone, you end up pleasing NO ONE. Very simple.</p>
<p>The last war fought with primitive weapons was between the Muslim and Hindu during the partition of the British Raj. The creation of Pakistan and India. About one to two million persons killed with knives, shovels, axes, etc. As in so many places, the spark is ready to ignite at a moments notice for just the most trivial of reasons, even if just perceived but not really there.</p>

		<p>I love how these Indian Muslims proclaim &#8220;India is a secular state, and the rights of minorities should be respected&#8221;.</p>
<p>Like Saudi Arabia protects its non-Muslim minority population? Like Iran protects its Bahai and Zoroasterian practioners? Yeah, right.</p>

		<p>The Muslim invaders built a mosque at Ayodhya precisely because it was already a Hindu holy site, just the way they turned the Church of St. Sofia into a mosque and why they built a mosque on the Jews&rsquo; Temple Mount (though it was the Romans, and not Muslims who demolished the Second Temple).  One of the main aspects of Islam is expropriation of others&rsquo; religious property.</p>

		<p>  Historically, India&rsquo;s Islam was permeated by mystical, moderate, tolerant Sufism. However, a more extreme fundamentalist Islam from Arabia has been gaining ground this century. A radical intolerant form of Hindu nationalism has risen to challenge the militant Islamists. Our immigration policy imports these sectarian religious conflicts to the West. Don&rsquo;t we have enough disunity and internal conflict already?  Why is mass immigration from the crowded, conflicted, and polluted Indian subcontinent good for the West?</p>

		<p>Subcontinental sectarian violence has already reached North America, Sardonicus.  A group of Sikhs, at least one with British ctizenship, blew up Air India flight 182, a 747 outbound from Montreal in 1985 killing all aboard.  (That same day they killed two baggage handlers at Narita airport in Japan in an attempt to bomb Air India flight 301, the attempt failing only because Japan does not use daylight savings time, thus the bomb detonated an hour early).<br>

<p>This is no more &#8220;radical&#8221; and &#8220;intolerant&#8221; than the White European nationalism sweeping that continent as a reaction to Islamisation my friend.</p>
