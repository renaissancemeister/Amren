		<p>I&rsquo;ve seen this guy on TV before.  THe UFC is heavily promoting him.  My guess is that they are trying hard to attract new latino viewers that specifically want to see one of their own win.  The irony is that the Ultimate White Boy, Brock Lesner is not promoted as some caucasoid phenom but as a MN farm boy.  </p>

		<p>Believe me, the UFC do want want Velasquez to win. Outside of Georges St Pierre, Lesnar is their only marketable champion.</p>
<p>Lesnar, for all his character faults, is a charismatic crowd pleaser who can sell a fight. Cain Velasquez has the charisma of a dishrag,is incredibly shy and cannot do interviews or hype fights well and will be a box office bust as world champion.</p>
<p>Latinos will not pay money to buy tickets to see a boring charisma free wrestler just because he is Latino.</p>

		<p>Lesnar is juggernaut, I don&rsquo;t think it is likely to lose. The video is pretty funny at one point Brock says &#8220;when I get done whooping your a_ _ I will drink a corona and eat a burrito for your Hispanic heritage.&#8221; The fact that he is blond haired nordic looking type really has to rub salt in the wounds of &#8220;brown supremacists&#8221;.</p>
<p>The UFC at least is able to resist the forces of political correctness for now to some extent explaining it sky rocketing popularity, as opposed to Boxing which is loathed to promote any white fighter and is hellbent in promoting black superiority. <br>

		<p>In the same show where Rachel Maddow was sneering at the Political Cesspool she also knocked the Caste Football website, for &#8220;counting how many whites are on football teams.&#8221;  You can be sure that every other race counts how many of their own are on a team, and roots for them.  If there was a highly publicized heavyweight title fight between a black Nigerian and a white American, you can be sure that the great majority of American blacks would be rooting for the Nigerian.  Needless to say I hope Lesnar wins.  I&rsquo;d root for him more if he got a &#8220;White Pride&#8221; tattoo to match Valesquez&rsquo; &#8220;Brown Pride&#8221; tattoo.  </p>

UFC fights will soon be viewed as a way for fans of each racial distribution to promote themselves and leverage power on the street once Mexican&rsquo;s like Valasquez monkey wrench the UFC with racism.<br>
Mexican&rsquo;s are on record for the ethnic cleansing of blacks in<br>
Southern California and the killings of thousands across the Southwest.<br>
The UFC is a commercial side show due to the money involved.<br>
However, it does not enforce a racial caste system against white American&rsquo;s like pro sports.<br>
Whites are the world&rsquo;s greatest fighters and are appropriately the champions of the fight world with the Klitschko&rsquo;s domination of heavyweight boxing and Brock Lesnar in the UFC.<br>
Once Valasquez enters the arena American&rsquo;s  and the rest of the world will expect Valasquez to be pounded down by Lesnar with diligence and peinciple.<br>
America cannot afford to gve any more or any less. </p>

<p>This sport is Mixed Martial Arts, not boxing.  You are correct, most whites don&rsquo;t seem to be interested in boxing any more (Although I think at the moment whites hold around 75-80 percent of the championship belts, mostly Eastern European guys).</p>
<p>MMA is hugely popular with whites, I and all of my white friends gravitated toward this sport in lieu of boxing many years ago as fans.  Pull up a fight on you tube, you&rsquo;ll see the audience is mostly white.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not a fan of this kind of staged fighting. But, it is ironic that race-conscious conflict is promoted by major media, that a large segment of the public, especially young adult white males like the approach, and that there is little the NPR/PC crowd can do about it. If enough people demand a &#8220;quality&#8221; white product, even a performer like these guys, the corporate world will find a way to evade PC censors.  If the brown, socalled,Latinos,who arent even a cohesive, culturally-consistent group, can rally around a &#8216;champion&rsquo;, why not Caucasians?</p>
<p> Caucasians have fewer cultural differences these days than African or Spanish-mestizo identity groups. The PC Elite urges us to forget our similarities and only respect Afro/Latin diversity. Why would we listen to our treasonous leaders?</p>
<p>Exploit, not disavow, our group strengths, based on better physical health and mental dexterity than our competitors.</p>

		<p>It was insinuated by one sports writer that Lesnar&rsquo;s assertion about burritos in response to Velasquez&rsquo;s racist claim that he was fighting for Hispanics was a bit over the line, completely ignoring&hellip;or too dimwitted to understand&hellip;.that the only racist utterances was from the so-called Mexican.</p>
<p>Since Mexicans are packaged small, I&rsquo;d like to look into this character&rsquo;s family history to see what ethnicity he is mostly.</p>
<p>I understand he&rsquo;s born in the US, yet he sees fit to regard Mexicans as &#8220;his people.&#8221;  Is there any greater example of mestizo racist loyalty than that?</p>
<p>I think not.</p>
<p>The fact that Lesnar has blond hair and blue eyes must drive most Mexicans crazy.  I can tell you from experience it does just that to most blacks.  They consider those characteristics as their polar opposites, because they&rsquo;re mostly a stupid people who can&rsquo;t understand much anyway. They just love to hate whitey.</p>
<p>Many are so ignorant they believe Hitler had blond hair and blue eyes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really follow spectator sports, but from the little I&rsquo;ve seen on youtube when I&rsquo;ve stumbled across it from time to time almost anything can happen in MMA fighting.  It&rsquo;s pretty unpredictable.</p>
<p>But, win or lose, Lesnar is a tremendous force to be reckoned with.  I have no doubt he could totally annhilate Ali in his youth, Joe Louis or any other black boxing thug under MMA.  MMA IS true fighting.  </p>

		<p>I have been a boxing fan for over 40 years now, there are so many world class white boxers now, that it is hard to keep up with them. The reason is that the fighters from the former Soviet Union have been allowed to turn pro for almost 20 years now. After the 1950&rsquo;s the best white fighters, the Irish and Italians, left the sport for other things. Now, the fighters from eastern Europe are dominating the sport from middleweight to heavyweight. Ali, Frazer, Holmes, Norton and others black fighters never had to fight the eastern euro fighters except perhaps in the amateurs, they should all have an asterisk next to their names on their boxing records to indicate they didn&rsquo;t fight the Eastern Europeans in the professional ranks.</p>

<p>In MMA they use what works.  In practice, that means mostly boxing with an occasional kick, and wrestling once somebody is on the ground.  They don&rsquo;t do flying kicks and other Hollywood stunts because in real life that isn&rsquo;t what works.  MMA is the closest thing you&rsquo;ll see to a street fight in a legal sport.</p>

		<p>Besides this racist Mexican with the brown pride tattoo, there&rsquo;s one that plays football in this country that has a tooth with a Mexican flag on it.  Both were born in this country to the best of my knowledge.</p>
<p>Taking this adoration they have of Mexico into account, does anybody have any doubt that if we were to go to war with Mexico the majority of Mexicans in this country would be fighting us and the US government on the side of Mexico?</p>
<p>Both the aforementioned athletes are traitorous, but worse they tell us that their main desire is to resist assimilation and maintain loyalty to Mexico, not this country.</p>
<p>So, if effect, what the should be regarded as are Mexicans not Americans.  Americans don&rsquo;t root for other countries in all respects.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism, as Chancellor Merkel of Germany said, is a failure.  We have seditious elements within this country that should be driven out by any means necessary. </p>

It is a long thread but it is interesting in that at least some (young) whites are getting it-the in your face anti-white double standards, while some revel in their racial self loathing.</p>

Since he IS presently a U S citizen, the final act bestowed upon him by our country is the removal of said citizenship, and a one-way trip to his preferred &#8220;homeland&#8221;. The same for all the rest of these 14th amendment American citizens of Mexican ancestry.

<p>How does this work again?  A white man (in all essence) born in America with a Spanish surname and ancestral roots in Mexico beats a white man born in America with an English-sounding surname, and overweight swarthy Chicanos who just recently hailed from south of Mexico City feel some sort of racial pride.  It makes about as much sense for me to have &#8220;Brown Pride&#8221; tattooed across my chest as it does Velazquez. <br>
