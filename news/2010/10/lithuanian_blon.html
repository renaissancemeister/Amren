			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Damien McGuinness, BBC News, Oct. 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Lithuanian company plans to set up a holiday island in the Maldives run entirely by blondes  &mdash;  the latest project in a growing blonde movement in the Baltics. But how legitimate is this latest sign of Baltic blonde ambition? </p>
<p>What do you call a blonde who runs a business? A dab hand at marketing, if she comes from Lithuania. </p>
<p>Blondes in the Baltics have had enough of the jokes about being dumb. Now they want to show they are smarter than the gags make out, with a growing blonde business empire. </p>
<p>The Lithuanian company Olialia, pronounced &#8220;ooh-la-la&#8221;, is planning a holiday resort in the Maldive islands. </p>
<p>The firm hopes to pull in the tourists by employing only blonde staff, and offering direct flights to the island crewed entirely by blondes, including the pilots. </p>
<p>Olialia is run and staffed by blonde women, and already operates in 75 different business sectors, making products from computer software and food products to pop music. </p>
<p>&#8216;Racist&rsquo; idea? </p>
<p>When women with dark hair work here, they are surrounded by all these beautiful blondes, so eventually they end up going blonde too&#8221;</p>
<p>End Quote Giedre Pukiene Managing director, Olialia </p>
<p>Olialia&rsquo;s blonde managing director, Giedre Pukiene, says she wants to break the stereotype that blonde women are less intelligent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our girls are very smart and they have degrees,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>&#8220;All of them want to do something with their lives. They have lots of business ideas.&#8221;</p>
<p>The island project was officially unveiled this weekend at a party with a blonde dress code, in a new nightclub in Vilnius opened by Olialia. But the resort, which is meant to be opened in 2015, has been heavily criticised. </p>
<p>When it was announced on the Maldivian news website &#8220;Minivan&#8221; in September, many readers condemned it as discriminatory by potentially excluding non-white Maldivians. </p>
<p>&#8220;This is racist and should not be allowed in the Maldives,&#8221; wrote one reader identified as Ablo. </p>
<p>Local laws could make things difficult as resorts in the Maldives are required to hire at least 50% local staff. </p>
<p>In Lithuania itself, which is a member of the EU, there is the question about whether stipulating blonde hair as a criterion for a job applicant contravenes EU employment laws. Would older women with grey hair or men be eligible for a job? </p>
<p>&#8216;Selling sex&rsquo; </p>
<p>Giedre Pukiene says her company does not discriminate and welcomes all applicants, no matter what their gender, age, ethnicity or hair colour.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we find that when women with dark hair work here, they are surrounded by all these beautiful blondes, so eventually they end up going blonde too,&#8221; she said. </p>
<p>Other critics call the company&rsquo;s entire marketing strategy sexist. They fear that using cliched sexual images of blondes to sell products simply confirms negative stereotypes. </p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s clear they are not selling the idea that blondes are clever,&#8221; says Latvian journalist Sanita Jemberga, herself brunette. </p>
<p>&#8220;They are selling the idea that blondes are sexy, because sex sells. They have found their unique selling point, which is Baltic women and sex.&#8221; </p>
<p>Stag party culture </p>
<p>All the company&rsquo;s products are advertised using images of sexy blonde women in improbably intellectual situations. </p>
<p>An ad for Olialia&rsquo;s own-brand cola, for example, shows glamorous high-heeled blonde scientists concocting rather unlikely-looking laboratory experiments to make the drink.</p>
<p>Another ad shows a board meeting of blondes, who are applying make-up while discussing corporate strategy. </p>
<p>Whether the PR campaign is offensive or simply cheekily ironic, it does appear to be working. </p>
<p>Olialia says it expects to double its annual net profit to $10m (Â£6m) this year, and claims that over 80% of Lithuanians recognise the brand. </p>
<p>Olialia&rsquo;s growing business is just one sign of a bizarre blonde movement in the Baltics which describes itself as liberation from stereotypes for blonde women.</p>
<p>In May, a two-day blonde festival was held in the Latvian capital Riga to cheer up a country hit hard by the economic crisis. </p>
<p>The event&rsquo;s organiser, Marike Gederte, who is CEO of a business and president of the Latvian Association of Blondes, told the BBC that the annual festival, which includes parties, a concert and a march of blonde women through Riga, is meant to prove that blondes can be independent and show initiative. </p>
<p>But judging from the over-excited reaction of some male tourists in Riga, female emancipation wasn&rsquo;t necessarily the first thing that sprang to mind. </p>
<p>One young man visiting on a stag weekend was detained by police after drunkenly stripping at a concert of blonde women in the Old Town. </p>
<p>The Baltic blonde movement is certainly attracting attention. But it may also end up undermining the region&rsquo;s attempts to pull in more sedate tourists and shake off its rowdy stag party image. <br>

		<p>I have very dark hair but even I am fed up with the denigration of blondes and &#8220;gingers&#8221;. It&rsquo;s gone way past the cute little joke stage   &mdash;   as have the redneck jokes. It&rsquo;s time to call it what it is: <i>politically correct racism.</i></p>

		<p>Unless they restrict visitors to naturally blonde men, at least white men - Nordics, they have only set up a nice shooting barrel for rapists, and other racial exploiters that still believe that blondes are easy and there for their sexual satiation.  A real blonde island would be for insuring only blondes are born to blondes.  Racist, perhaps, but necessary if we want to keep real blondes in the world.  I suggest another island for redheads, who are even more endangered of extinction.  We&rsquo;d do the same for an insect or a lizard.</p>

		<p>How dare Lithuanians declare their own women to be beautiful! That&rsquo;s sexist.</p>
<p>And since only whites can have natural blonde hair, it&rsquo;s racist.</p>
<p>And since elderly women only have naturally gray hair it&rsquo;s ageist, as the article brilliantly points out.</p>
<p>And since gay men aren&rsquo;t attracted to blonde women, it&rsquo;s also homophobic.</p>
<p>And since some blondes eat at McDonalds it&rsquo;s also anti-vegetarian!</p>

		<p>This blonde girl is getting sick and tired of blonde jokes.  How did they originate anyways?  Maybe an older person can enlighten me.  </p>
<p>It appears to me that they came about due to the idea that blonde women have traditionally been considered a sex symbol in Western countries and therefore can rely souly on their looks instead of their brains to get a man.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I am baffled as to why this stereotype even exists.  When people say &#8220;dark haired women are more intelligent&#8221; does that include Third World women to?  What is it that drives these ridiculous jokes?  </p>
<p>The last time I checked, it was blonde countries that had some of the highest IQs in the world.  So I hope these jokes are only meant to be taken in the context of only pertaining to within the white world, excluding minorities.</p>
<p>I have also noticed that it is usually fake blondes who act dumb.  Neither Brittany Spears nor Jessica Simpson are natural blondes, for example.  So it is obvious that &#8220;blonde=dumb&#8221; is hardly a reality, but more or less a persona that women with blonde hair (usually fake) enjoy putting on about themselves in order to attract men.</p>

		<p>So on the premise of proving that they can run a resort without non-blondes, natural blondes I assume, they will create a resort where they can be hunted on an island by any who will pay the fee to come aboard.  It sounds as if they are just raising the level of the blonde joke up a few notches.</p>

		<p>Blonde is feminine and blond is masculine, therefore blonde woman and blond man.</p>
<p>One aspect of blondness is light-colored eyes, e.g. blue eyes. I&rsquo;ve read that around 1900 approximately half the people in the U.S. had blue eyes. Sadly, now the percentage is in the low teens. I&rsquo;ve forgotten where I read this, so I couldn&rsquo;t check to verify these numbers. Please correct me if my memory has failed. </p>

<p>If you are referring to Tat C allele as some sort of &#8220;mongoloid&#8221; DNA you are grossly misguided. It is true that a population in Baltic states have high frequency of haplogroup N (around 35%). But even if Tat-C originated in Siberia, according to skeletal evidence found in the central and western Siberia, the population of that region before expansion of Mongoloid races were not Mongoloid at all.<br>
Most likely Tat C is original Caucasian Paleolithic marker of a Ice Age or Pre-Ice Age population and it spread west not east.</p>

<p>Balts DO NOT have 50% Mongoloid DNA, the Russians have 50% Mongoloid DNA.</p>
<p>Ethnic Balts (Latvians, Lithuanians) are just as pure whites as Scandinavians or Germans.</p>

		<p>Courtney-one theory that I have heard regarding the &#8220;dumb blonde&#8221;-jokes is that it might be related to the fact that most men find blonde women more attractive. As a result, blonde women have simply relied on their appearance, instead of their intelligence, creating the impression that they might not be so intelligent.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this theory is true, but it&rsquo;s the only explanation that I&rsquo;ve heard that isn&rsquo;t obviously false. This stereotype clearly isn&rsquo;t the result of it being true as I know of no scientific study that has indicated that blondes have lower intelligence than brunettes or redheads.</p>
<p>At the same time, it should be noted that despite, or perhaps because it is true, similar stereotypes or jokes about blacks having lower intelligence are considered unacceptable to people that are politically correct. Make a joke about dumb blondes, many at cocktail parties will laugh. Make a joke about dumb blacks, many at most cocktail parties will be horrified, despite or again perhaps because of the far stronger evidence of blacks having low intelligence.</p>

		<p>Chem:  I think you&rsquo;re right that blue eyes are going away.  Even when I watch old TV shows from the 1960s, I&rsquo;m always struck by how many of the actors have blue eyes.  (Prior to that, with black-and-white TV, you couldn&rsquo;t tell.)  I&rsquo;ve also read somewhere that people who work in old folks&rsquo; homes have noticed how many of the elderly clients have blue eyes, whereas among younger people, it&rsquo;s much more rare. </p>
<p>Of course, if some rat or fish were going extinct, it would be alarming and there&rsquo;d be cries to save it.  But blondes, redheads and/or blue-eyed people will probably disappear without a whimper.  In fact, many will cheer.</p>

They have found their unique selling point, which is Baltic women and sex.&rdquo;<br>
__  __  __  __  </p>
<p>They are just capitalizing on this idea (that blondes are sexy). Blondes themselves did not invent it.  I think they&rsquo;re actually a bit embarassed about it. But as long as it exists, they might as make the best of it and turn it to an advantage. </p>
<p>In fact, it is the rest of the world that has this obsession with blondes, not the Baltic peoples (who couldn&rsquo;t care less).  Just look at Mexicans, Brazilians, Philipinos, Arabs.  The darker they are, the crazier they are for blondes!  And in America, how many black sports stars or swarthy Hollywood moguls have a blonde trophy wife to show off?   Blondes certainly didn&rsquo;t sell them that notion. Where did they get it?</p>
<p><br>
Oh, incidentally: The scorching Maldives, under that blazing equatorial sun,  would not seem a good place for Baltic blondes evolved to live under the weak nordic rays. Not a good idea! For a brief vacation, maybe, but not for long-term employment. I wouldn&rsquo;t advise it.</p>

This (naturally) blond gal agrees with you 100%.<br>
I was educated in some of the finest schools and I am quite competent and capable. Also, I do have some talents thay I&rsquo;m sure alot of brunettes, grays, red heads and baldies lack. I&rsquo;m sure these people have many talents that I lack.<br>
I&rsquo;m not sure how long &#8220;blond joke&#8221; have been around. It seems to me that they probably originated back in the late 40&rsquo;s early 50&rsquo;s when we had a host of breathy voiced, doe-eyed helpless blondes, the most well known being Marily Moroe, but we also had Jane Mansfield (often called &#8220;the poor man&rsquo;s Marilym Monroe), Mamie Van Duren, Lana Turner (the sweater girl), Betty Grable. This is opposed to the brunettes of the day: Elizabeth Taylor, Katherin Hepburn, Audrey Hepburn, Bette Davis, Natalie Wood, etc. </p>
<p>When you thik of all the blond actresses you think of pin-ups, sexiness, damsel in distress, and face it, blond dingbat.<br>
When you think of the non-blondes I listed you think of their movies, roles, how sweet they are. They exude goodness. You could trust your husband around these ladies. We love these gals&rsquo; movies. We think of them as good and wholesome. When we see these other ladies we don&rsquo;t thnk of their movies. We think of playboy models and pin-ups. The blonds exhude sex, as far as they could back in the 40&rsquo;sand 50&rsquo;s. <br>
Naturally, but wrongly, we put the &#8220;dumb blond&#8221; label on them. The movies these blondes made have plots that revolve around that blond sexuality. The movies that the other ladie&rsquo;s made are remembered as wholesome films that mean something. These nonblonde ladies played heroic, brave, wholesome, clever.</p>
<p>The world over, blond was considered the standard of beauty. Us blond hair is coveted. Women will go to extreme lenghts and spend ridiculous amounts of money making their hair blond. Blond hair has long been a standard of beauty. And when people are jealous of something, they often villify it.</p>
<p>So I believe that Hollywoods portrayals of blondes as dumb bimbos good only for being sexy bombshells.</p>
<p>Hollywood had created (and brainwashed with) the archetype dumb, helpless blond and most importantly, a SEX SYMBOL, while you have hundreds of thousands of women who are not blond wanting to be. Hence, the &#8220;dumb blond&#8221; jokes. </p>
<p>This is basically what I think and I hope I was able to understandably relate my theory to you all. I&rsquo;m extremely tired at the moment and not thinking well.</p>
<p>Also, I wonder where all the &#8220;dumb Pollock&#8221; jokes come from. I know a lot of Polish people and none of them seemes particular dumb to me. Can someonw explain this?</p>

<p>I was vaguely aware that tourism (mainly from Europe, and now from the rich Arab countries and elsewhere in newly-rich Asia)  has become a very big business in the formerly  off-the-track Maldives. </p>
<p>On  checking with Wiki, I learn that:   <i>&#8220;In just three and a half decades,    tourism has transformed the Economy of the Maldives,  replacing fishing, and making it the main source of income and livelihood of the people, and  the country&rsquo;s biggest foreign currency earner.&#8221; </i></p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s another point (which Skip already made above):</p>
<p> <i>Islam is the only official religion of The Maldives. The open practice of all other religions is forbidden, and such actions are liable to prosecution under the law.  According to the revised constitution,  the republic &#8220;is based on the principles of Islam.&#8221;   Article nine says that &#8220;a non-Muslim may not become a citizen of the Maldives&#8221;;  number ten says that &#8220;no law contrary to any principle of Islam can be applied in the Maldives.&#8221;  Article nineteen states that &#8220;citizens are free to participate in any activity not expressly prohibited by Sharia or by the law.&#8221;<br>
  <br>
In May 2010, during a question period after a speech,  an audience member, Mohamed Nazim, declared he was &#8220;Maldivian and not Muslim.&#8221;   Others in the audience attempted to attack Nazim, who was removed under police protection and detained.   Other reports stated that Nazim was attacked, and arrested.   Local newspapers called for him to return to Islam or be put to death.<br>
  <br>
In 2010, Ismail Didi, a Maldivian atheist being investigated for &#8220;lack of belief&#8221; and  who sought asylum in Britain, allegedly committed suicide. </i></p>
<p>Nice place for a carefree vacation?   I don&rsquo;t think so!   </p>
<p>Not unless you&rsquo;re a rich Moslem from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, or Pakistan.   But those &#8220;sexy&#8221; blonde infidels  from the Baltic  should certainly  spice up your vacation quite  bit!   To the Moslem mind,  they&rsquo;re just meat  for the taking,  </p>
