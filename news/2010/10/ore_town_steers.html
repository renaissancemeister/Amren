<h1>Ore. Town Steers Clear of Detroit</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>George Hunter and RoNeisha Mullen, Detroit News, October 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Some folks out West don&rsquo;t think Detroit sounds like a nice place to visit. They&rsquo;d rather stand up and tell &#8216;em they&rsquo;re from Detroit Lake.</p>
<p>Voters in the tourist town of Detroit, Ore., will decide Tuesday whether to change its name. The village of about 300 residents, nestled in the Cascades foothills, is known for its boating and skiing  &mdash;  not crime, failing schools or a shaky auto industry.</p>
<p>Builder Doug DeGeorge, who was instrumental in putting the proposal on the ballot, said the name &#8220;Detroit&#8221; carries an unsavory image.</p>
<p>{snip} The business of changing the name of a city to sever perceived links to Detroit isn&rsquo;t new. East Detroit voters in 1992 changed their city&rsquo;s name to Eastpointe.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The country has a very poor image of Detroit, and if you want to get away from that, it makes sense to look into changing the name.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alabama, Maine and Texas all have towns named Detroit, and there&rsquo;s a Detroit Lakes in Minnesota.</p>
<p>DeGeorge said he expects the measure to pass.</p>

		<p>East Newark, Hudson County, NJ a number of years back wanted to change its name because the name, the residents felt, depressed property values due to people thinking that it was a section of Newark, Essex County, NJ which is the next city over.  Convicted former Mayor of Newark Sharp James denounced the move as racist and the state put an end to that.  Perhaps the NAACP should march on Detroit, Oregon and put an end to this obviously bigoted name change.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t blame these people for wanting to change the name of their little burg.  After all, some Somali refugees might just show up and want to move in, thinking they were arriving in the big Detroit.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely beautiful country around Detroit Lake.  I trained for my first  Portland Marathon in the foothills around the lake while attending grad school in Salem, Ore.  It&rsquo;s the antithesis of Detroit there.  Peaceful, uncrowded, scenic, and crime free.  </p>

		<p>Detroit isn&rsquo;t the only city name that is evocative of unpleasantness.  Try Gary, Philly, Watts, New Orleans, Compton, Chicago, Bronx, Brooklyn, Newark, Trenton, Baltimore, etc.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s pretty sad when a city is so synonymous with crime, failure and corruption that a town a thousand miles away or so wants to have nothing to do with it. Of course, not as sad as people wanting to dig up their dead relatives and move them someplace else (which is also happening). This is what occurs when an urban area collapses, and it is happening in a hundred places around this country. Detroit is just the most prominent example.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a small town in northeast Texas called Detroit. No word on whether they&rsquo;re planning a name change. Of course, some towns in those parts are mostly black, in which case the residents would <i>like</i> the current name.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t blame the residents of Detroit, OR for wanting to change their name. Let them. If they feel that it conjures up bad images of Detroit, MI, then good. It will give pause to the Bantus in Detroit, MI. It&rsquo;s saying that a predominantly white town wants nothing to do with Detroit, Michigan&rsquo;s image.</p>
<p>After all, aren&rsquo;t Bantus the ones screaming about things like the Confederate flag, Mississippi Rebel mascots, blackface skits and &#8220;boy&#8221;, being &#8220;racist&#8221; images and connotations? Now, the situation is reversed.</p>
<p>Several years ago, the town of South Waukegan (IL) changed its name to North Chicago, for the same reason. Likewise, East Gary (IN) changed its name to Lake Station.</p>
<p>Then, there&rsquo;s the town of Ford Heights (IL). It was f/k/a East Chicago Heights. However, that didn&rsquo;t work out so well, because Ford Heights, IL is a 99.9% Bantu suburb, poor, corrupt and blighted. It was like trying to put lipstick on a pig, or perfume on a skunk.</p>
<p>I note in the original article that a Detroit (MI) city councilman, actually thinks his city will be &#8220;great&#8221; again, in the future, and that Detroit, OR will regret that decision. How exactly will that happen, councilman? By holding your hands out for federal largesse? Been there, done that already.    </p>

		<p>I grew up in a suburb of Portland and used to go camping at Detroit Lake.  In fact, I think camping is its raison d&rsquo;etre.  Biggest building there, if memory serves, was the post office, but that&rsquo;s partly due to the shape of its roof.  I hardly think they&rsquo;re hurting for visitors.</p>

		<p>At every opportunity the white society should distance itself from the black regressive enclaves.  Allow the black enclaves to be all they can be (black and useless), and the white groups to excel and proceed.</p>

<p>John -sadly, it is not to majority black enclaves that the Somali Muslim Vanguard is being settled, but in majority White/ Christian areas- places like Maine, and Minnesota, largely thanks to[sic] Christian &#8216;refugee agencies&rsquo; (like the TEC&rsquo;s &#8220;Episcopal Migration Ministries&#8221; and the ELCA&rsquo;s &#8216;Lutheran Social Service,&#8221; that seem to have taken their methodology from the SPLC or Saul Alinsky&rsquo;s Rules for Radicals, rather than the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and the &#8216;set apart nation status&rsquo; that forbade miscegenation in the O.

T.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ridiculous rationalizing&hellip;  The OT was speaking to Jews, not everyone, and it doesn&rsquo;t say anywhere that the various &#8220;nations&#8221; of the world are to remain as they are - nowhere.  The myth of Moses does proclalim freedome to all people, which is a liberating, not restrictive tome.  And of course, we have the logistical problems of Genesis and the Garden of Eden, with family members appearing out of nowhere for marriage, (ceremony and all, we presume).  We have Solomon who says &#8220;I am black.&#8221; In pre-Christian times, we have Ethiopian Jews, as well as others not strictly Hebrew, with no evidence that they were ever rejected.  Judaism may not seek converts, but it does not turn away converts, either. Roman historians write about Jews and note some of the conversions that took place in the Mediterrainean world and among Romans. </p>
<p>As for the &#8220;Gospel of Jesus Christ,&#8221; it is full of inclusive, submissive, provided socialistic style religious example and function, advised believers to submit to God and the state simultaneously, love and embrace enemies, etc.  Everything that the Lutherans, Catholics, Baptists, etc., do in missionary and immigration work is undeniably favored in the Gospels as well as Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, and Acts.  In fact, the last two are all about the spread of Christianity through including a myriad of ethnic, and likely racial groups.  All was fine for centuries as military and economic interests supported missionary work as a foot in the door world wide.  There was always the excuse of rescuing missionaries or religious pilgrims when land and wealth was to be gained.  Today, it is not only hypocritical, but scriptually impossible to now claim that formerly &#8220;Christian acts&#8221; (as if no one else ever did it) like taking in refugees and providing succor to the needy convert is not sanctioned by the same text, and even forbidden.  Relying on the Bible or Christianity to save the white race is going to fail, as there is no deep culture within it, let alone is it in the teachings.  Aside from a few cases of relatively modern xenophobic Christians, there is not tradition for banishing others from inclusion and inclusion infers genetic intermixing.  After, all &#8220;We are all God&rsquo;s children.&#8221;  How many  times has phrase been used?  Gibbon wrote about the recorded incidence that was widespread in early Christianity concerning the methods of gaining converts.  As the wealthy converted, they were so feverent (as all were) that they would donate all their wealth to the church.  Following earlier Jewish sect practices, that wealth was redistributed to the poor converts.  So the early churches growth was due to a clever expansion of the Jewish religious commune, and provides the first example of actual communism, which Marx cites in his work, quoting from other extant sources.  Marx was a Jew who converted to Christianity.  </p>
<p>It is no longer possible for either the Catholic Church or the Protestant Movement to sally forth into the world and claim lands and converts by sword and fire,  but like Islam, it seeks converts as it always has.  It never cared about nations, but only in how well they could serve their purposes, allying throughout history with despotic kings, fascists, even Muslims and others when it seems advantageous to its own designs.  Ironically, only socialist communism sees through the ruse of religion.  But any who think it is the hope of the white race is trafically deluded and a montrous barrier to any hope for our race.  it is going to require inter-white cooperation, very socialist like, combined with the determination to accept one another at least, rather than endlessly insist on this really dubious use of the Gospels as a source of racial validation.  The attempt to do so creates for one thing, endless angles of attack for leftists.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </p>

		<p>I heard that back in the 1950s, Salem, Oregon had a sign at the city limits stating, &#8216;Welcome to Salem. 98% white and proud of it.&rsquo; Ah, the good old days. Of course I wasn&rsquo;t born back then, but my father&rsquo;s told me stories.</p>
<p>Now, Salem has problems with black and Mexican gangbangers. Nowhere near as bad as big-city problems, of course, but problems nonetheless. Ah, the joys of diversity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Detroit&#8221; is originally a French name. So if the proposal for changing the name of this Oregon town doesn&rsquo;t go through, and they&rsquo;re stuck with &#8220;Detroit,&#8221; the locals could start pronouncing it the French way   &mdash;   roughly, &#8220;De Twah.&#8221;</p>
