			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chicago Sun-Times, October 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Munster, Ind. condominium association has agreed to pay $120,000 to settle a federal racial discrimination case, according to court records.</p>
<p>U.S. attorneys filed a settlement agreement Friday in the U.S. District Court in Hammond, Ind. which also detailed other steps that Autumn Ridge Condominium Association must take including the resignation of the board president.</p>
<p>The federal government filed the lawsuit against the association and three board members in 2008, claiming that a black couple  &mdash;  David Haddox and Kourtney Valentine  &mdash;  and their children had attempted to buy a condo in the association. According to the lawsuit, the condo board gave initial approval but then rejected the family only after learning they were black. The government also charged that the association&rsquo;s bylaws said no children were allowed, which breaks federal law.</p>
<p>The condo ended up selling for a lower price, and the prospective buyers, former owner and real estate agents for both complained, saying they lost out on money and a home.</p>
<p>The three board members  &mdash;  Richard Archie, Ronald Patterson and James Reed  &mdash;  denied in an earlier hearing of objecting to the family&rsquo;s purchase at all.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The agreement also calls for the association to pay $106,500 into an escrow account that will be paid to all the victims. Autumn Ridge must also pay a fine to the federal government of $13,500.</p>
<p>Autumn Ridge also agrees to adopt non-discriminatory policies, to post fair-housing signs and to have board members take training on the Fair Housing Act, according to the settlement agreement.</p>

		<p>Nobody wants to live with black people. Not even blacks, as they move away to live with caucasians when they can afford it. The disingenuous white liberals who will call me a racist for saying that also don&rsquo;t want to live with black people.</p>
<p>If people wanted to live with blacks, there would be no need for an Orwellian &#8220;Department of Housing and Urban Development Assistant Secretary for Housing and Equal Opportunity John Trasvina&#8221;. This guy would have to find an honest job.<br>
 <br>
Think of all the tax dollars we could save if the government would stop trying to force people to live with the blacks no one wants to live with.</p>

		<p>The rights of private property are paramount.  The right to hold and sell your property as you wish is inalienable right. Yet, we have been robbed of these rights.</p>
<p>Also, how were these alleged victims harmed?  How were they damaged?  This government stinks to high heaven.  Where are our liberties?  We had more freedom under British rule than today.  Bring back King George III, back then our taxes were much lower (no direct income tax) and we had many more liberties than we do today. King George III never in his wildest dreams would ever think stripping Americans of their rights to freely alienate property and associate with those of their choosing. </p>
<p>The Revolutionary War was about taxation without representation, today I would gladly do without our current representation. </p>

		<p>In English, &#8220;fair housing&#8221; would mean not only the right to choose where to live but the right to choose amongst whom you live.  So-called &#8220;fair housing&#8221; denies people the right to choose amongst whom they live.  Not only is &#8220;fair housing&#8221; not fair, but it destroys communities.  If the people of a community prefer that their community remain white, this is their right.  The same applies to other groups.</p>

		<p>When I travel around, I note the subsidized apartment complexes, usually at the outskirts of small towns. They are identifiable by architecture usually, and the fair housing sign (actually a symbol  &mdash;  house drawing with an &#8220;=&#8221; in the middle) confirms it every time.</p>
<p>Watch out for this complex to start attracting a lot more &#8220;fair housing&#8221; types in the future.</p>

		<p>Where is the freedom to freely associate in personal, social and economic matters?  Why must one individual&rsquo;s freedom be taken away via government coercion in favor of another?  Fundamental freedom must never be comprised by government policy&hellip; but that train left the station long ago.</p>

		<p>I saw this in the local paper. It shows just how far the concept of freedom of association has fallen. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe for a moment that the condo banned children, or that that had anything to do with it. </p>
<p>Munster is an upscale community bordering the mixed-population city of Hammond. The area MSM newspaper that was once headquartered in Hammond moved to Munster decades ago.</p>

		<p>Who is to say that the HOA denied them for having children?  Why does the author assume that the denial was based on race?  Was there a stipulation to the fact?</p>
<p>The FHA was garbage legislation but I think it&rsquo;s equally plausible the HOA wanted to keep it a &#8220;retirement&#8221; community which is why they included a &#8220;no children&#8221; clause.</p>

		<p>Blacks getting more free money. WE have no freedom in this country if you are White and want to live among your own kind and sell to your own kind. What happened to freedom of association? Notice we NEVER hear about that freedom anymore, do we? The reasons for all the anti-White laws being passed is that they want to make sure that White folks are FORCED to mix with people of &#8220;color&#8221; and even have them living in your own home if need be. Until Whites get a backbone and make a stand for their own people, then this will only worsen to where Whites will be FORCED to cohabitate with people of color and bring only mixed race children into the world. Impossible, you say?  Nope. My parents would have said what has happened to America and Whites in the last 50 years could never happen and yet it has.</p>

		<p>I really have no idea why anyone chooses to live in a condo. Condo associations are mini-dictator regimes, if you ask me. Everything, and I mean just about <i>everything</i>, has to be approved. Want to paint your house? Install a small statue in the front yard? You need permission.</p>
<p>My brother lives in some subdivision that has such rules. One poor guy had a service truck that, according to the rules, was not allowed to be parked in the driveway. The van had to be housed in a garage. </p>
<p>Except his garage was too low to accommodate the van. </p>
<p>So he had to tear out the opening, and rebuild a larger entryway to the garage. Yay for &#8220;norms!&#8221;</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with the condo association&rsquo; actions because they cost the owners money. But neither do I think it is the government&rsquo;s business to tell private citizens to whom they must sell their private property. I strongly disagree with the Fair Housing Act because it&rsquo;s unconstitutional. And the fact that the supreme court ruled it constitutional doesn&rsquo;t make it so. This is just another opportunity for the justice department to engage in social engineering. In a perfect world the case would have been a CIVIL suit.</p>

		<p>We used to enjoy freedom of association.  We used to have a meritocracy.  We used to&hellip;.  You get the idea.  The Marxists who run the country changed all that in the name of making blacks equal.  It&rsquo;s an impossible goal since their collective IQs are 20 points lower.  Don&rsquo;t confuse political equality with the leftist narrative that blacks are eqivalent to whites in ability.</p>

		<p>We have to be smarter, &#8220;our America&#8221; is dead and gone.  It is not unheard of in Chicago for houses to just transfer between people without a for sale sign ever appearing, therefor neighborhoods remain much more tightknit.  Even the big box stores exclude people from employment using their &#8220;Emotional Intelligence&#8221; application process which by my guess excludes 40% of Obama&rsquo;s voting bloc. My gym plays it smart, it has a no obscenities clause strictly enforced which keeps out the trash.</p>

		<p>There has got to be more to this story than this article states. No condo or apartment complex would deny a family based on having children. This is strictly illegal unless the complex is clearly labled &#8220;55 or 62 and older&#8221;. It&rsquo;s possible that they wanted a smaller unit than acceptable due to family size. As far as the HOA not allowing them to buy based on race there was probably a background issue or maybe even a credit problem. Nobody is crazy enough to deny housing based on race in the attitudes today. </p>

<p>EXACTLY!!!!  Whenever even ONE black or Mexican family moves in then we can expect that will open the door for even more. I have seen it time and again where I live. Every apartment complex I used to live in over the years, I drive by them now and EVERY single one has turned black and brown. The complexes are in disrepair with broken down blinds/drapes in the windows, trash everywhere, kids running all over the place, people milling about looking like gangsters, broken down cars in the lots, and the list goes on.</p>

		<p>Anon #13: There are ways around this forced intergration. Sell your house without the use of a Real Estate Agent or Broker. </p>
<p>If your house is for sale, mention it only to family and close friends, who are the same page as you are. You could mention it to the members of a Fraternal Organization that you belong to, or at Church. </p>
<p>Selling your home on your own lets you decide who get the house, and for the amount that you want, or will take, to know that it goes to a good family. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s odd how we have complete freedom to sell our cars and other property to whomever we want, but the Government needs to stick its nose where it doesn&rsquo;t belong, only to ruin traditional White ethnic Neighborhoods, by importing, and infusing, Blacks into our areas.</p>
<p>My Grandparents&rsquo; generation would never have allowed this to happen to them.</p>

That is an EXCELLENT idea!  That is a splendid way for sorting out the trash.  I never thought of that before, yet it is so obvious! </p>
<p>And they can&rsquo;t claim it is anything &#8220;racist&#8221;, because it applies equally to anyone.  All they have to do is mind their manners, watch their mouths and behave, and they&rsquo;re OK   &mdash;   yet so many of them just can&rsquo;t manage to do that. </p>
<p>But they can&rsquo;t claim it&rsquo;s &#8220;racist&#8221;   &mdash;  - without admitting that most of them have filthy mouths and can&rsquo;t behave.</p>

		<p>The Association has no right to decide who gets to buy the condo. That is up to the owner. The owner wanted to sell the condo to this black family.  I am glad that the association members had got sued.  But I wish the money come out of their pockets and not of the insurance companies.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m suprised an association would be foolish enough to try to do this, because prosecutions under the Fair Housing Act in cases exactly like this have been an ongoing part of the US political landscape for four decades.</p>
<p>It would have been far easier for a savvy HOA board to let the sale proceed and then mercilessly enforce every single HOA covenant violation these interloping blacks would have predictably committed.  Once the unpaid violation fines reach a certain level, the HOA can file a lien on the property and eventually forclose it.  That&rsquo;s what we do in my neighborhood.<br>

		<p>I guess the condo pres hadn&rsquo;t yet read the good news in &#8220;Transcultural Healthcare: Culturally Competent Approach- be prepared for the culturally rich and ethnically diverse world in which you will practice&#8221;.</p>
<p>Jolly good reading:</p>
<p>&#8220;Given African Americans&rsquo; strong work and achievement orientation, they value self-reliance and education for their children. A dichotomy might exist here, because many parents do not expect to get full benefit from their efforts because of discrimination.&#8221; </p>
<p>If only the condo pres had &#8220;done the right thing,&#8221; the blacks wouldn&rsquo;t be victims of the man who keep them from staying in school.</p>
<p>Are textbook writers now paid by Comedy Central?</p>
<p>Their take on Ebonics was also a sure laugh line, saying that African American English is misperceived because of White prejudice that stereotypes blacks as uneducated, when in fact, Ebonics &#8220;communicates unique cultural ideas and serves to symbolize racial pride and identity.&#8221;</p>
<p>We agree and applaud.  If they want to speak intelligibly as a symbol of their identity, then let that be their identity.  We wouldn&rsquo;t try to change a thing.  As God made them, so we will let them be.</p>
<p>I pledge to my White brothers and sisters that I will never deplete our White Humanity by wasting it trying to share anything with blacks or uplift them so they can act less black and more White.  I actively seek out small and subtle ways to discriminate in favor of Whites.  Blacks have the entire apparatus of government and philantrophy behind them as an army to promote their unearned privileges over my earned White privileges. Why would I ever voluntarily offer to help them?  They&rsquo;ve already got more than we ever will again have.   </p>
<p>You know that a black wrote the glossary in Transcultural, because a White would never be allowed to say this definition. </p>
<p>&#8220;Race: having to do with genetic differences such as blood type, skin color, and other physical characteristics.&#8221;</p>
<p>We agree with that, also.</p>
<p>White Humanity often fails to understand just how significant race is to the blacks. For them, it is an asset without having to work.  </p>
<p>We must reinforce the old adage, &#8220;If their race is significant to them, then shouldn&rsquo;t their race be significant to you, as in, if their race gives them some moral claim to your resources, shouldn&rsquo;t you be willing to acknowledge that fact and decide whether or not you will just hand over your own race treasure so it can become theirs?&#8221;<br>

		<p>The problem is&hellip; Every one wants to be white!&hellip; But if you mix them all together they&rsquo;ll be brown! Black people want to live with whites&hellip; just as less intelligent want to associate with others of higher intelligence&hellip; hoping some will &#8216;rub off&rsquo;&hellip;The dark man&hellip;&hellip;. &#8216;secretly&hellip;&rsquo; hopes his children&hellip;. will mix blood&hellip; with a white person&hellip;therefor he follows whitey&hellip; everywhere he goes&hellip; and sues him if whitey wants his offspring&hellip; to remain white&hellip;.&rsquo;How Clever&rsquo;&hellip;.Black pride does exist with some dignified black people&hellip; but unfortunately as so many costly law settlements have shown&hellip;.many blacks constantly scheme to enter the white genenome just as vultures&hellip; follow a pride of lions..for unguarded morsals&hellip;</p>

<p>and how about the store that had a problem with &#8220;loitering&#8221;. the manager started playing Mozart as background music, voila, problem solved. </p>
