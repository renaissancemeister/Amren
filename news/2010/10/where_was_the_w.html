			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Alexander, Washington Post, October 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8220;Non Sequitur&#8221; is a popular comic that runs daily in about 800 newspapers, including this one. But the &#8220;Non Sequitur&#8221; cartoon that appeared in last Sunday&rsquo;s Post was not the one creator Wiley Miller drew for that day.</p>
<p>Editors at The Post and many other papers pulled the cartoon and replaced it with one that had appeared previously. They were concerned it might offend and provoke some Post readers, especially Muslims.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>What is clever about last Sunday&rsquo;s &#8220;Where&rsquo;s Muhammad?&#8221; comic is that the prophet does not appear in it.</p>
<p>Still, Style editor Ned Martel said he decided to yank it, after conferring with others, including Executive Editor Marcus W. Brauchli, because &#8220;it seemed a deliberate provocation without a clear message.&#8221; He added that &#8220;the point of the joke was not immediately clear&#8221; and that readers might think that Muhammad was somewhere in the drawing.</p>
<p>Some readers accused The Post of censorship. &#8220;Cowards,&#8221; e-mailed John D. Stackpole of Fort Washington, one of several who used that word.</p>
<p>Miller is fuming. The award-winning cartoonist, who lives in Maine, told me the cartoon was meant to satirize &#8220;the insanity of an entire group of people rioting and putting out a hit list over cartoons,&#8221; as well as &#8220;media cowering in fear of printing any cartoon that contains the word &#8216;Muhammad.&rsquo; &#8220;</p>
<p>&#8220;The wonderful irony [is that] great newspapers like The Washington Post, that took on Nixon .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. run in fear of this very tame cartoon, thus validating the accuracy of the satire,&#8221; he said by e-mail.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Surely some may be displeased by &#8220;Where&rsquo;s Muhammad?&#8221; But unlike with the Danish cartoons, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine it would incite protests. Miller intentionally did not depict Muhammad, and the cartoon is not a blasphemous attack on the prophet. If anything, it&rsquo;s a powerful and witty endorsement of freedom of expression.</p>
<p>Post editors believe their decision was prudent, given the past cartoon controversies and heightened sensitivities surrounding Islam. But it also can be seen as timid. And it sets an awfully low threshold for decisions on whether to withhold words or images that might offend.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Cartoonist: Washington Post does not dare offend Muslims&#8221;</p>
<p>The Washington POst and all its look-a-likes in far left field are terrified to offend Muslims, because Muslims, unlike Christians, will kill or maim over a perceived insult.  It plainly reveals that only violence is respected by radical leftists.</p>
<p>The will demonize Christians all day long for their anti-gay beliefs; their staunch religionist activities, even going so far as to ridicule them for believing in a creator, but they wouldn&rsquo;t dare criticize Muslims for doing EXACTLY the same and believing EXACTLY the same.</p>
<p>Lefties are cowards of the highest order.</p>

		<p>I do not personally believe in offending people for no reason, but that is my personal belief.<br>
This is a nation where we are supposed to have freedom of speech! People constantly say that Islam is a &ldquo;religion of peace&rdquo; and that Muslims are a peaceful group, yet they warn us against drawing their prophet because they might kill us.  We should be able to draw whatever we please, if Muslims have a problem with it, they can get over it. <br>

		<p>Someone with a lot of skill should paint an accurate portrait of Mohammed as he personally &#8216;tried&rsquo; and ordered executed some 600-900 Jews after &#8216;a revelation&rsquo; had caused him to believe they would fall on his forces from behind as he fought another force of &#8216;pagans&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Of course these &#8216;Qurayza&rsquo; were totally neutral and scared to death of doing anything wrong (after the preceding two Jewish groups were also slaughtered).  And as they were just about the last money source left in Medina, he ordered every clansman he could to kill at least two of them before handing out their property.</p>
<p>So went &#8216;The Battle Of The Trench&rsquo; as I recall.  Men leaned over and were beheaded, their corpses falling into one.</p>
<p>I want this artwork not to be made light of in a comic strip.  Rather I would see it tastefully done in line with what is known of the man&rsquo;s actual appearance (a sweaty, swarthy, epileptic who suddened from sudden siezures and bizarre appetites).</p>
<p>And opposite this image, I want another painting of 10,000 sweaty, swarthy, Muslims, circling the Kaaba shrine of The Black Rock and pointing their fingers inwards or kissing the stone itself, seven times, if they are close enough.</p>
<p>And underneath these two juxtaposed images I would like to see a caption which reads: &#8220;Wherein the idolatry for a mass murderer?&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the whole thing about &#8216;no images of The Prophet&rsquo; you see.  Islam _knows_ that it&rsquo;s a religion of hypocrisy which is built on blood, not brotherhood.  The profane, not peace.</p>
<p>It _knows_ that it would be instantly repudiated if it&rsquo;s Messiah equivalent was shown to be a blood thirsty murderer who did everything for prophet as a highwayman and bandit thief.  And so they use the idolatry and &#8216;insult to Islam&rsquo; rules to protect themselves from well deserved infamy.</p>
<p>Someone with a lot of cash and/or a lot of bombs should make the counterpoint.  Hard.  And the resulting information campaign should be public, explicit and unrelenting until the religion of Allah is discredited for what it has done and continues to do to women, to non-believers and to all who are it&rsquo;s victims.</p>
<p>Until it is broken, forever.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not religious, so I don&rsquo;t really have a dog in this fight, but I&rsquo;m struck by the difference in how the Post treats Christianity, and Islam. They would not hesitate to post a picture of &#8220;artwork&#8221; depicting a crucifix an a jar of urine, or encourage the National Endowment for the Arts to fund such nonsense.</p>
<p>It seems nothing must offend Islam. Is it because they threaten violence at even the slightest offence? If so, that demolishes the argument that violence, or the threat to use it, is not effective.</p>

<p>If they were just honest and said they were scared of physical retribution then I&rsquo;d have more respect for them. But that would be admitting that their anti-white multiculti ideology wasn&rsquo;t working out.   </p>
<p>Ironically, the white, liberal Left will be the first victims of the Muslim overthrow of the West, especially in Europe. Hardline Muslims despise liberals even more than we do. And you can bet that they&rsquo;ll run to white, straight males for protection.</p>

<p>It does indeed, and the only thing rabid leftist radicals respect is violence and/or a threatening tone by a force willing and powerful enough to administer it at their whim.</p>
<p>Muslims stone homosexuals to death, as they do adulterous women and they beat women who might be alone in the presence of a male non-relative.  They refuse to let them drive or go to school, plus they deny them any kind of privileges and freedoms at all.  </p>
<p>Too, the penalty for dropping Islam for another religion is death.  Adultery&hellip;for women only&hellip;is punished by burying the female participant upright in a hole and stoning her to death.</p>
<p>Thefts are punished by cutting off hands and feet. Christians&hellip;or any other religion&hellip;who want to practice their religions in Muslim areas are set upon, beaten and/or killed.</p>
<p>There is so much barbaric practice within Muslim societies it more closely reflects a cruelly controlled sect than a religion.</p>
<p>Yet the radical leftists utter not a peep about the intolerance of any of it and instead screech hysterically denigrating Christians for holding mild beliefs that are in opposition to their own.  </p>
<p>Look at the video clips of The View wherein Bill O&rsquo;Reilly said that Muslims are &#8220;insensitive&#8221; to the feelings of people who lost loved ones in the 9-11 plane bombings of the Trade Center and Joy Behar and the incredibly ugly Whoopie Goldberg walked off stage protesting O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s lack of tolerance.</p>
<p>Keep in mind it is Behar who says Christian are stupid for praying, because praying is illogical, but she never mentions the five prayer sessions per day required of Muslims or the praying by Jews.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s the typical radical leftist bigot who is so full of hate for Christians and Anglo Americans who are not left wing crazies, she is blind to her own stupidity.  Behar and all other extremists are unaware that everything they criticize Christians for is found in most all religions, including the the Koran and Talmud, yet no mention of anything but her hatred of Christians.</p>

		<p>And you know what?  Nearly every other group is fair game for satire.<br>
Muslims need to get used to it without having a hissy fit and threatening to riot.<br>
Humor is always at someone&rsquo;s expense, when you think about it. Where is the exemption clause for Islam?</p>

		<p>The &#8220;Where&rsquo;s Muhammad?&#8221; cartoon is a hilarious satire and take-off &#8220;Where&rsquo;s Waldo?&#8221; that Muslims should get a kick out of. Are the newspaper editors insinuating that Muslims don&rsquo;t have a sense of humor? Shame on them!</p>
