<h1><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/06/china-crackdown-african-immigration">China Cracks Down on African Immigrants and Traders</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tania Branigan, Guardian (London), October 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The red vinyl banner hanging from the front of Canaan market, a multi-storey wholesale emporium of cheap jeans and hair extensions, begins promisingly &#8220;Welcome to Guangzhou&#8221; and concludes, less warmly, &#8220;Please have your passport ready for checks by police&#8221;.</p>
<p>This southern city in China&rsquo;s Guangdong province has drawn hundreds of thousands of immigrants from across Africa in the last decade: from Burkina Faso and Somalia, Ivory Coast and Ghana, Tanzania and Angola. The banner and the dwindling numbers of traders here attest to an immigration crackdown that has alienated many and left young men injured and languishing in detention, community leaders say.</p>
<p>&#8220;You go home: the police are knocking on your door. You are on the street: police will hold you. You are on the bus, inside a restaurant  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s everywhere,&#8221; says Ojukwu Emma, president of the Association of the Nigerian Community, whose compatriots account for almost half the migrants.</p>
<p>It has not always been this way. Between 30,000 and 100,000 Africans, mainly young men, are living here. Most are traders lured by the cheapness and variety of goods made in the surrounding Pearl River Delta. In complexes such as Canaan, they purchase nappies, tractor parts, luxuriantly floral shirts, stock cubes, mobile phones, air conditioners, and pirate DVDs. In the Chinese-run cafes around the buildings they eat plantains and fufu as well as rice.</p>
<p>Some buyers stay for a few weeks. Others, such as Eric Rufito, make it their home. The 55-year-old businessman arrived 10 years ago from Bukavu in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on, he says, the instructions of the Holy Spirit, with one suitcase and his Bible. He had never met a Chinese person. &#8220;I knew about Mao only,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I didn&rsquo;t know they were like they are now. I was surprised when I found it was so capitalist.&#8221;</p>
<p>His family embraced the new China; his 12-year-old daughter speaks Chinese and English but not his mother tongue, French. Beneath a list of machinery, &#8220;mineral processing  &mdash;  forestry  &mdash;  livestock&#8221;, his green and yellow business card promises: &#8220;We help you to produce, to turn the Democratic Republic of Congo into Africa&rsquo;s China.&#8221; Rufito remains positive about his adopted homeland. &#8220;China is moving. Europe is not,&#8221; he says. &#8220;European people should also learn from China  &mdash;  to co-operate and be friendly, not be a big fish eating a small fish.&#8221;</p>
<p>But for Nkiruka Obi  &mdash;  not his real name  &mdash;  it is a different story. The Nigerian would have come to Europe, but knew visas were hard to get. So he came here to buy clothes and computer parts with money saved from jobs in Gabon, South Africa and Libya. &#8220;My friend told me there was hustling here, but you know? He deceived me.&#8221; The man took him &#8220;home&#8221; to a flat to recover from his flight. When Obi emerged from the shower, his friend had vanished; so had his money. Now he is stuck. It is easy to get here, hard to stay and often hard to leave.</p>
<p>China tightened immigration controls ahead of the Olympics, ending the routine renewal of short-term visas. Recently, with the approach of November&rsquo;s Asian Games in Guangzhou, restrictions have tightened again.</p>
<p>Africans here say students and those with established businesses are usually fine, but others struggle to get renewals either on the mainland or in Hong Kong or Macau. Some fly home to reapply. But Obi, whose visa expired two weeks ago, cannot afford a ticket or the 5,000 yuan fine for overstaying.</p>
<p>It is common for China to restrict visas in the run-up to big events. But Africans allege they are bearing the brunt. They believe it is harder to gain renewal and complain they are targeted in random raids, with police demanding passports from any black faces present.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are many Chinese people in my country  &mdash;  working there, selling there. Nobody is pursuing them,&#8221; said Obi. He is restless; reluctant to loiter in a restaurant, on the street or even at a friend&rsquo;s home, lest the police come. &#8220;If I see them, I run,&#8221; he says. &#8220;That&rsquo;s how I live.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those seized are detained for 21 days if they cannot pay the fine; longer if they cannot afford a plane fare. Sometimes officers will let overstayers slip away for a bribe of 2,000-10,000 yuan (£188-£940), they say. Many risk their lives to escape, leaping from buildings to escape raids and paying with broken limbs.</p>
<p>Emma, the community leader, had just returned from telling a Nigerian family their son had died. He jumped from the sixth floor as he fled police and the hospital had concluded there was no point keeping him on life support. &#8220;He was 30. If not for the police he might be alive today,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Guangzhou public security bureau did not respond to queries. But Emma argued the raids merely pushed people underground and into crime, when the city should be benefiting from them.</p>
<p>Business has fallen by a third to a half, say Chinese vendors who depend on African clients. Migrants are already leaving Guangzhou for cities with more sympathetic officials.</p>
<p>Mary Ngum  &mdash;  not her real name  &mdash;  is here legitimately but says she would rather return to west Africa than endure police raids and wider discrimination.</p>
<p>Elegant and well-spoken, she sighs over the headmaster who refused to hire her to teach &#8220;because you are black&#8221;; the strangers who hold their noses when she sits beside them on the bus; the derogatory remarks she overhears. Many blame ignorance, not malice, but she thinks Guangzhou worse than other cities she has lived in: &#8220;They are always talking about colour,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Some fear popular prejudice is growing, and fuelling the crackdown.</p>
<p>&#8220;African people should obey the Chinese government&rsquo;s laws, because some are doing drugs and are criminals,&#8221; says Ah Ling, who runs a T-shirt stall in Canaan market. But she is careful to add that others are law-abiding.</p>
<p>When Professor Barry Sautman of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology surveyed residents recently, about half had a neutral impression of the African community, he says, and far more had a good or excellent impression than a negative one. Traders often rely on Chinese staff. Friendships have developed. About 500 Nigerians are in mixed marriages and many more couples cohabit, say residents.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s easier than with Europeans,&#8221; adds Rufito. &#8220;In China we live like in Africa. You have your bottle  &mdash;  you share it with others. In Europe? They do not share the bottle.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Africa&rsquo;s links to China</b></p>
<p>Sino-African links developed during the Cold War and trade was one beneficiary, rising from $177m in 1970 to $765m in 1978. China&rsquo;s spectacular development saw that figure soar to $6.48bn in 1999. It is now the continent&rsquo;s second largest partner, with trade worth $91.7bn last year.</p>
<p>According to state news agency Xinhua, there are around 1m Chinese people in Africa, of whom the largest number (around 300,000) are in South Africa. Others put the overall figure at perhaps double that.</p>
<p>The Guangzhou Academy of Social Sciences has estimated that there are around 30,000 legal migrants from Africa in the city. Its senior researcher Dr Peng Peng said the number of Africans arriving grew by around 30% to 40% annually between 2003 and 2008, but now appeared to have peaked. Local media have suggested there could be 100,000 African residents in total.<br>

		<p>Sounds like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson better get over there right away and teach the chinese about guilt and their racist culture which needs reform.  Affirmative action, mass migration from Africa - it must happen because how dare those Chinese become successful before Africans had the chance to do so.  Redistribute the wealth!</p>

<p>They do not realize that they can be &#8216;relocated&rsquo; to the Interior just like that. And that all the UN resolutions on racism won&rsquo;t save a single one of them. They should get out. If they&rsquo;re smart. </p>

		<p>China only tolerates blacks because it is interested in using Africa as a dumping ground for its surplus exports.</p>
<p>If they didn&rsquo;t need them, China would have no hesitation about deporting all Africans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the few positive things that can be said about the one-party state. </p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t believe it.  I know many Chinese from Guangzhou and other places, too.  Believe me, in private and to their friends they immensely dislike black Africans.  Chinese take prejudice to new levels.</p>

Good heavens. Where to begin?</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;I knew about Mao only,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know they were like they are now. I was surprised when I found it was so capitalist.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>He moved there because he thought it would be a communist paradise where he could live off the collective.</p>
<p><i>In complexes such as Canaan, they purchase nappies, tractor parts, luxuriantly floral shirts, stock cubes, mobile phones, air conditioners, and pirate DVDs. In the Chinese-run cafes around the buildings they eat plantains and fufu as well as rice.</i></p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t these people provide these things for themselves in Nigeria?</p>
<p><i>Rufito remains positive about his adopted homeland. &ldquo;China is moving. Europe is not,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;European people should also learn from China &mdash; to co-operate and be friendly, not be a big fish eating a small fish.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>These people are incapable of seeing reality even as the walls are caving in.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;There are many Chinese people in my country &mdash; working there, selling there. Nobody is pursuing them,&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because the Chinese are in the drivers seat and he doesn&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;African people should obey the Chinese government&rsquo;s laws, because some are doing drugs and are criminals,&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>African behavior is universal. The same stereotypes apply in China as in America because the behavior is identical. The stereotypes persist because they&rsquo;re true.</p>
<p>China was foolish to admit Africans but they have learned from the experience which is something the west will never do.</p>

		<p>I think this article contains a lot of psychobabble.  Unless we see a black community activist from Guangzhou get Hu Jintao&rsquo;s job at some point in the near future, then China won&rsquo;t have the correct attitude about diversity.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of the time when I was eating in a Chinese buffet near my home and there was this black guy hitting on the two waitresses working in the place. The two waiters could barely speak English, of course, but I found it amusing that they were trying to speak eubonics to the black guy. They were saying such things as &#8220;Bra&#8221;, &#8220;Dog&#8221;, &#8220;Chill&#8221;, &#8220;Eeeh&#8221;, along with various other slang terms that black people use.

		<p>China will eventually ask most foreigners to leave, I think. I think that is one of their end goals, once their internal infrastructure is built up sufficiently. All of this is being tolerated for now to somewhat play along with the West but I would only give it 5, at the most 10 years before you start to see foreigners have their visas yanked. They are not under the same illusions of sharing their country with incompatible outsiders the same way we are.  </p>

<p>Kept apart from the Chinese Han people in a purposeful manner. You could live there, but not mix with the locals, strictly regulated and of course NEVER become a Chinese. That is not possible. ONLY a Chinese can be a Chinese.</p>

<i>The Nigerian would have come to Europe, but knew visas were hard to get.</i></p>
<p><br>
That&rsquo;s certainly not the impression you get walking around Europe these days   &mdash;   it <i>seems</i> more like the Europeans must be flying over Africa in cargo planes and dropping those visas by the millions over every city, village, jungle, and war zone they can find. </p>
<p><br>
<i>&ldquo;My friend told me there was hustling here, but you know? He deceived me.&rdquo; The man took him &ldquo;home&rdquo; to a flat to recover from his flight. When Obi emerged from the shower, his friend had vanished; so had his money.</i> </p>
<p><br>
An African took advantage of another African? Say it ain&rsquo;t so, <i>Guardian</i>! &#8220;A hustle here and a hustle there, Guangzhou City&rsquo;s the place where, they say Hey Obi, take a walk on the wild side&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
<i>Now he is stuck. It is easy to get here, hard to stay and often hard to leave.</i></p>
<p><br>
Nonsense, Obi   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s EASY to leave! Just turn yourself in to the nearest police station. I assure you the Chinese officials there will be HAPPY to help you find your way back to where you belong. The truth is, Obi and the rest of these invaders don&rsquo;t WANT to leave, because life as a fugitive in China is still several civilizational levels better than their &#8220;normal&#8221; existence back in The Dark Continent. </p>
<p>What this typical female bleedingheart <i>Guardianista</i> is missing here is that China is merely doing what any sensible, self-respecting nation does: making strict, ethnically-based immigrations laws, and <i>enforcing</i> those laws. This is what Western countries like US, UK, Canada, and all of W.Europe USED to do&hellip; back in Olden Tymes when WE were sensible, self-respecting nations. </p>

		<p>Actually, massive black immigration to China can be a good thing - for us!  If China is the new rising superpower, then the more Africans and even Mexicans who go in, the weaker the nation will be.  We might have a chance in the future in our own Brazil-like funk!</p>

		<p>The Chinese aren&rsquo;t prone to sentimentalism like whites, so they won&rsquo;t wave the white flag of surrender when called &#8220;racists&#8221;.  I don&rsquo;t see the fiercely racially conscious Chinese tolerating a growing number of Africans for very long.  They certainly won&rsquo;t put up with violent crime and allow Africans to rape and attack native Chinese with impunity like they can do in America and Europe.   </p>

<p><i>Elegant and well-spoken, she sighs over the headmaster who refused to hire her to teach &ldquo;because you are black&rdquo;; the strangers who hold their noses when she sits beside them on the bus; the derogatory remarks she overhears.</i></p>
<p><br>
Of course it never occurs to an African   &mdash;   nor to their enablers in the Western press   &mdash;   that those Chinese who hold their noses when she sits beside them on the bus might do so because (at least to <i>their</i> nostrils) Africans <i>actually do smell bad.</i> An ethnic group&rsquo;s body odors have a lot to do with diet, of course   &mdash;   which, as this article admits, is different from the Chinese diet. Do they really expect us to believe that Africans actually smell like lovely gardens of tropical flowers; and the Chinese are holding their noses merely to be mean? </p>
<p>But, needless to say, in a pro-black propaganda piece like this, the possibility of ANY sort of African imperfection or undesirability   &mdash;   even at the olfactory level   &mdash;   cannot even be suggested. The ONLY acceptable explanation therefore MUST be dat ol&rsquo; debbil &#8220;racism&#8221; on the part of the host population. </p>
<p>So the sole difference between this article and the thousands of others that AmRen runs every year, is that on this occasion the nasty, vicious, intolerant host population being accused of &#8220;racism&#8221; isn&rsquo;t White but Asian. As a previous poster said, &#8220;Hey, China, welcome to our world.&#8221;</p>

<p>That is absolutely true. The Chinese complain about the odor of Westerners, so I imagine the odor of Africans [stench, really]  is much, much stronger to sensitive Oriental noses. </p>
<p>In Africa, where many don&rsquo;t ever bathe at all, you can often smell someone from across the street.  Some of them are covered with swarms of flies buzzing all around.  And I have been in planes where you could smell Africans from a distance across the plane - I mean a wide-bodied plane! Sabena used to be full of reeking Africas in business suits, which is why I stopped using it. I&rsquo;ll never forget a transatlantic flight that was sheer misery because a well-dressed young African woman  seated next to me, regardless of being <i>&#8220;elegant and well spoken&#8221;,</i>  positively reeked. She was enough to make me nearly ill and I had to keep my face turned away from her for the entire flight. There were no other seats available and nowhere I could escape.</p>

		<p>The mention of the young man who&rsquo;d been killed jumping out of a six floor window brought back a bizarre memory from my time in the 7th Special Forces Group at Ft. Bragg, NC.  We were instructing a small group of (if memory serves) Nigerian Army officers on rappelling out of helicopters.  After teaching them the techniques of tying themselves into their Swiss seats and properly looping the rope through the snap-link, we started them rappelling town a thirty foot wall.  When they seemed to have gotten that straight we ordered the waiting Huey crew to get aloft with a couple of the Nigerians, one SF NCO, and me. Hovering at about seventy feet, I started to loop the rope through the snap-link for one of the Nigerians, who began to protest.  At first I thought he was afraid to fall backwards out the side of the Huey, but finally realized he was saying he saw no reason to rappel down and preferred to just jump at such a height, shaking his head and shouting &#8220;No need, I just jump.&#8221;</p>
<p>I ordered the pilot to get us on helipad immediately for some further orientation.  </p>

<p>Oh, and here i thought it was just White peoples&rsquo; noses that were racist picking up on that particular Black B.O.</p>
