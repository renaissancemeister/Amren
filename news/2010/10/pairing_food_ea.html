<h1>Pairing Food, Early-Vote Rallies Raises Legal Risks</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jonathan Ellis, Argus Leader (Sioux Falls, South Dakota), October 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Democrats in South Dakota are holding three early-vote rallies on reservations this week that will feature &#8220;feeds&#8221; to attract potential voters.</p>
<p>That activity continues a long tradition of pairing food with voter rallies in areas of the state where Democrats garner as much as 95 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>Strong Native American turnout has been the difference in statewide races in past years, and it could be critical in upcoming races. The emergence of early voting has only intensified efforts to get out the vote in Indian Country.</p>
<p>The practice of offering food at voting rallies can come close to violating the law.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of it depends on the context of how it&rsquo;s being done,&#8221; Secretary of State Chris Nelson said. State law forbids candidates and campaigns from &#8220;offering anything of value&#8221; to get people to vote  &mdash;  not just to vote for a particular candidate or issue, but to vote in general.</p>
<p>In 1998, then-Attorney General Mark Barnett and then-U.S. Attorney Karen Schreier issued a written warning to political parties about offering &#8220;a meal, money, gifts or whatever&#8221; in exchange for voting. Barnett followed that with another letter five months later that said under state law, &#8220;any giveaways or incentives offered as an encouragement for people to vote are prohibited. The statute is very broad and should be so construed.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The reservations have been key voting centers for decades. The Native American vote helped propel Robert F. Kennedy to victory in his 1968 primary in South Dakota.</p>

		<p>There is an American Indian tradition from the pacific northwest called &#8220;Potlatch&#8221;! This is similar. You give away something and in return you are owed a debt that must be paid later in SOME way.</p>
<p>And I am against this early voting too. Makes the process seem less noble and important. I have heard others say the same thing I feel, vote only on election day. The experience is quasi-religious in our society, or at least used to be, and should be. Don&rsquo;t demean in any way.</p>

		<p>I thought we already have been feeding the Indians for eons now? Not only that, we pay for everything they have, including their reservations, housing, hospitals, education, welfare, police force, and everything else one can think of.</p>

		<p>This should give one second thoughts. From the ethologistÂ´s point of view, sharing food is one of the oldest, most primitive and most universal of bonding rituals known to humankind. As per Eybl-Eibesfeldt it evolved from brood care.<br>
So, in this context it is akin to drugging the electorate - but no doubt the comrades are aware of the science.</p>

		<p>Obama may say things are improving but reading about the conquest of America just reminds me of the modern times we face today. Whites trying to get along, perform their work on their little part of the system, trying not to rock the boat, and hoping to have a &#8216;family&rsquo;, while non-whites fleece off them and wait for a chance to attack. Then the white authorities skip to ignore/appease mode and tell the new settlers everything is going great. The only difference is we&rsquo;re shrinking now while they are expanding. Everything else remains virtually the same.</p>
<p>Oh, pioneers </p>

		<p>Be very aware of this:</p>
<p>Latino politicians in the southwest - CA, NM, AZ - have been doing this for years. These politicians are relatives of Mexican politicians and are using the same voting techniques.<br>
Vote for us and we&rsquo;ll give you a blanket, a tamale, a burrito. </p>
<p>This may be a new thing in the north, but this has been endemic in the southwest of the US for years. The Mexican politicians&rsquo; relatives are becoming mayors and councilmen using these same tactics.</p>
<p>Be aware.</p>

		<p>My question is this:  The indian nations consider themselves sovereign, and govern themselves, have their own police force, schools, etc.  They pretty much determine what happens on their reservations.  Why are they allowed to vote at all?  They seem to have it both ways.  Sovereign, but getting federal tax dollars.  In some cases they are exempt from other federal and local laws, in other cases not.  They have the right to eject anybody from their sovereign territory, but not federal police or agencies.  They can determine WHO is a member of their tribe by blood, and deny membership or citizenship on reservations, or recognition on their own authority.  We need to clear this mess up.  They get to have it both ways.  Time to make them completely sovereign, or completely under our laws.</p>

		<p>Why is this such a problem?  There is a reason it only skirts up to the edge of illegally offering something in return for voting.</p>
<p>The main difference between whites and non-whites is the level of cohesion created in our societies.  There are many elements to that but for this issue it means that this technique could work far, FAR better for whites than it ever did for non-whites.</p>
<p>And we could go them one better, in such a way that the idea would spread far and wide with almost no cost to those organizing it.</p>
<p>You see, non-whites go to such functions for a free meal.  Depending on the race, they may or may not feel an obligation.</p>
<p>However, WHITES, go to such functions to BOND WITH OTHER PEOPLE.  They do not expect a free meal.  If you advertise a function, where people are going to get together and talk about what they want politically, and who supports what they want, you can simply say, hey, bring something (pie, cake, soda, casserole, whatever) to share with everyone.  Most of the people will bring something.  In fact, most of the people who bring food of the highest quality to show off stuff like how good they can cook, or how much they care about others.</p>
<p>The end result goes far more than getting votes for that specific election.  It instills patterns of who is on our side and who is not.  It spreads rationals and consensus for why support should be given to specific groups of politicians.  Most importantly of all, it builds what the non-whites will never have&hellip;..community.</p>

		<p>Even if they flagrantly violate the law in this fashion, Holder&rsquo;s &#8220;Justice&#8221; Department will refuse to do anything, stonewall congressional inquiries, and sweep the case under the rug.<br>

<p>American Indians have a legal status unique among all peoples of the entire world. They are both citizens of their respective Indian nations AND American citizens at the same time. Have all the rights of being a member of their Indian nation and also at the same time the rights of being an American citizen.</p>
<p>THEY do have it BOTH ways.</p>
<p>And YOU, the whitey, cannot not now or EVER be a member of an American Indian nation. </p>
<p>Well, I guess they were here first. That is what we are told.</p>
