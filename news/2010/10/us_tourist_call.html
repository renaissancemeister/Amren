<h1>US Tourist Calls on Obama to Step Up Search for Husband&rsquo;s Body in Alleged Mexican Pirate Attack</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News, Oct. 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An American woman who says her husband was gunned down by Mexican pirates called on the Obama administration Tuesday to step up the search for his body, as Mexican authorities begin to question her account.</p>
<p>Search terms scouring the U.S. side of Falcon Lake have turned up no sign of David Michael Hartley, 30, five days after his wife said he was shot in the head by Mexican bandits marauding on the U.S.-Mexican border lake. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hartley told a dispatcher in her 911 call that she was forced to leave her husband behind because pirates in three boats were firing shots and chasing her. </p>
<p>Hartley was then helped on shore by an unidentified man who reportedly witnessed the boats chasing her as she made her way back into U.S. waters. </p>
<p>The Texas Department of Public Safety said Friday that Hartley was believed to be killed, but nearly five days after the shooting, there was still no word whether the oil industry worker had been found.</p>
<p>Hartley denied any suggestions from Mexican authorities that her account was not truthful, saying, &#8220;I loved him and there&rsquo;s no way I would do anything like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mexican authorities investigating the alleged shooting reportedly say they have not yet found any evidence of the crime.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Marco Antonio Guerrero Carrizales, the district attorney in Miguel Aleman whose area also covers the Mexican side of Falcon Lake, told the newspaper that they can&rsquo;t figure out why neither Hartley&rsquo;s watercraft or his body  &mdash;  investigators were told he was wearing a life vest  &mdash;  have been found.</p>
<p>Hartley has accused Mexican authorities of &#8220;not looking&#8221; for her husband&rsquo;s body. She is calling on President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to pressure the Mexican government into allowing U.S. authorities to search the Mexican side of the lake. </p>
<p>Officials at the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) told FoxNews.com that Hartley&rsquo;s alleged death marked the fifth incident since April 30 in which U.S. residents ventured into Mexican waters and encountered pirates on the 60-miles-long Falcon Lake. </p>
<p>Prior to last week, the most recent occurred on Aug. 31, when authorities say pirates aboard a small boat with &#8220;Game Wardin&#8221; written on its side, in duct-tape lettering, tried to intercept a Texas fisherman. The fisherman, aware of warnings about pirates on the lake and recognizing the misspelling of the word &#8220;warden,&#8221; managed to outrun the Mexican vessel to safety, officials said.</p>
<p>On May 16, five armed men boarded a boat on the U.S. side of Falcon Lake. Investigators have no additional information in that incident. Only 10 days earlier, two armed men approached a boat on the lake&rsquo;s northern side and demanded money, which the fisherman handed over, DPS officials say.<br>

To think that less than a century ago an incident like this would have seen troops crossing the border on a punitive expedition! Now our feckless leaders do not even complain to Mexico&hellip;</p>

		<p>Years ago I kind of wondered.&#8221;what if American citizens start getting murdered by mexicans from across the border then I know the U.S. will do something about securing. Well two white americans have been killed by mexicans from across the border. But it seems the Obama administration would rather ban americans from going too close to the border than secure them. Good thing the administration is run by a black man. All of Obongos bungling on the Border will wake people up more than John Amnesty Mccain would do. This incident could make a great  basis for a fictional movie about how an american ex-navy seal gets revenge on the Corrupt mexican and american politicians responsible for the death of a spouse by mexican drug smugglers.</p>

		<p>The only kind of &#8220;border incidents&#8221; that rate any notice from the Obongo caliphate are the ones in which poor, persecuted mestizos are inconvenienced while illegally sneaking into our country.</p>
<p>White amerikans being killed at the border?  Who cares?  They&rsquo;re only taxpayers; plenty more where they came from.  Can&rsquo;t be Racism if mere Whites are the victims, right?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Hartley has accused Mexican authorities of &ldquo;not looking&rdquo; for her husband&rsquo;s body. She is calling on President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to pressure the Mexican government into allowing U.S. authorities to search the Mexican side of the lake.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I wish her good luck in getting any satisfaction from those two White-hating reds.  </p>
<p>Had enough Hope and Change yet, White amerika?<br>

		<p>Apparently, the Mexicans are not allowing the Americans on their side of the lake to look. Well, Mexicans have no respect for our borders or laws so we should go to the Mexican side of the lake anyway and search whether they like it or not.</p>

		<p>Seems to me we should send down the Navy Seals or some other appropriate military group dressed as bass fisherman. </p>
<p>Lyndon Johnson started the Vietnam war over an incident similar to this except no Americans were killed in the Gulf of Tonkin.</p>
<p>I hope General Patton&rsquo;s ghost helps us out and sends us a worthy candidate in 2012. Wouldn&rsquo;t you just love to see the next President faced with a situation like this and his first words are &#8220;Send in the Marines, take no prisoners, shoot first and ask questions later&#8221;.

		<p>When I first skimmed over this report in the news, I thought it was Somalia, then I read it was Mexico! Just one more reason to put troops and Coast Guard on the border, as a wall would not work in this location, obviously. But still, there seems something fishy about this story&hellip;</p>

		<p>Just a few hundred of the many thousands of troops America deploys guarding the border between North and South Korea would stop this lawlessness. It baffles me that America maintains hundreds of military bases all around the world stationed by hundreds of thousands of troops while its own borders are crumbling away. Dumb. Very, very DUMB. America - the worlds&rsquo; chump!</p>

case of two US Border Patrol agents, Compean and Ramos, who were sentenced to prison for 11 and 12 years for shooting a mexican drug smuggler.  Frankly,I don&rsquo;t expect anything from this administration&hellip;.except appeasement</p>

		<p>If the wife is lying, or covering something up, she is a great actor, worthy of an Academy Award.  What strikes me is how naive they had to be, playing on jet skis in Mexican territory when we all know that the borders, espeically Texas, is very dangerous.  Nosing around old ruins on the Mexican side seems really foolhardy, unless you were looking for something someone might have just left there.  But perhaps they were just naive Americans.  I meet such naive people all the time, and they are white every time.  They have good jobs, nice benefits, etc., so they just don&rsquo;t think that any of the problems out there really include them and their plans.</p>

		<p>Several possibilities need to be explored here&hellip;could the bandidos have removed the lifevest after shooting him? Bodies sink in fresh water, unlike in salt water. They become floaters after a while when decomposition gasses build up, making the body buoyant. Maybe they wanted to ransom the body to his wife. Could these two have been trying to score some dope on the lake and the deal went south? What&rsquo;s the life insurance situation?</p>

		<p>If the wife were hiding something, why would she being going all out to try and get American authorities to search the Mexican side?? A  witness on the American side saw a boat following the woman as she frantically jet skied to shore to get help.</p>
