<h1>Black Preachers Who &#8216;Whoop&rsquo;  &mdash;  Minstrels or Ministers?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Blake, CNN, October 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Whooping is a celebratory style of black preaching that pastors typically use to close a sermon. Some church scholars compare it to opera; it&rsquo;s that moment the sermon segues into song.</p>
<p>Whooping pastors use chanting, melody and call-and-response preaching to reach parishioners in a place where abstract preaching cannot penetrate, scholars say.</p>
<p>Whooping preachers aim &#8220;to wreck&#8221; a congregation by making people feel the sermon, not just hear it, says the Rev. Henry Mitchell, a scholar who identified the link between whooping and African oral traditions.</p>
<p>&#8220;The old folks used to say, &#8216;If you ain&rsquo;t felt nothing, you ain&rsquo;t got nothing,&#8221;&rsquo; Mitchell says.</p>
<p>Yet the black church has long been ambivalent about whooping. Some scholars say contemporary black churches are abandoning whooping because they think it&rsquo;s crass. But more white preachers are discovering it through YouTube and by sharing the pulpit with black preachers.</p>
<p>The most persistent debate over whooping revolves around its legitimacy. Is it fair to call it an art form? What&rsquo;s so hard about a preacher screaming and sweating in the pulpit?</p>
<p>Those are the critics who say whoopers are minstrels, not ministers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Simmons says the best whoopers use their voices like instruments. They&rsquo;re following rules of rhythm, tone and melody. All good whoppers have some &#8220;music&#8221; in their throat, says Simmons, editor of &#8220;Preaching with Sacred Fire,&#8221; an anthology of black sermons dating back to 1750.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Earning the right to whoop</b></p>
<p>Whooping isn&rsquo;t confined to vocal gymnastics. The greatest whoopers combined &#8220;learning and burning.&#8221; They are theologically sound, well-read and excellent storytellers, scholars say.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Those whooping legends that blended theology with &#8220;whoopology&#8221; are people like the Rev. Caesar Arthur Walker Clark Sr., a diminutive man with a powerful voice that could sound like God&rsquo;s trombone.</p>
<p>Contemporary whooping legends include the Rev. Charles Adams, dubbed the &#8220;Harvard Hooper&#8221; because of his Ivy League education, and the Rev. Jasper Williams, who teaches &#8220;whoopology&#8221; classes through a DVD series.</p>
<p>But the Rev. C.L. Franklin, the father of singer Aretha Franklin, is widely considered the greatest whooper. Many of Franklin&rsquo;s sermons, like the classic, &#8220;The Eagle Stirreth Her Nest,&#8221; and &#8220;Dry Bones in the Valley,&#8221; were sold as popular records during his lifetime.</p>
<p>Whoopers not only sound different; they preach different, says Mitchell, the preaching scholar and author of &#8220;Black Preaching: The Recovery of a Powerful Art.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mitchell says European culture tends to distrust emotion. That instinct, he says, goes as far back as the Greeks who frowned upon the exuberant worship of pagan religions.</p>
<p>Scholars quibble over the origin of whooping.</p>
<p>Most trace it back to West Africa griots, the dramatic storytellers who preserved a people&rsquo;s oral tradition. Some trace it to the &#8220;tonal&#8221; nature of African languages, the drums of Africa; the need for the slave preacher to rouse the battered spirits of enslaved Africans.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s in the DNA of our people,&#8221; Smith [The Rev. E. Dewey Smith Jr., whooping pastor of Greater Travelers Rest Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia] says. &#8220;When people were beaten and bruised, the slave preacher, with the intonation of the voice, was able to lift the spirits of the people.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Can white people whoop?</b></p>
<p>If whooping is the soundtrack for the black church experience, some want to change the record.</p>
<p>More black megachurch pastors are classifying themselves as &#8220;teaching&#8221; or &#8220;word&#8221; ministers. Their sermons resemble lectures, complete with studious congregations taking notes.</p>
<p>Smith, the Atlanta pastor, says some of the discomfort blacks have with whooping springs from &#8220;self-hate.&#8221; They&rsquo;re ashamed of an authentic expression of black culture.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Rev. Patrick Clayborn, an assistant professor of homiletics at Methodist Theological School in Ohio, says some preachers treat whooping as mere entertainment.</p>
<p>Clayborn says he was once accompanying his brother-in-law, a church organist, to a Sunday morning service when the visiting preacher slipped in a quiet request before the service.</p>
<p>&#8220;He said make sure you&rsquo;re in D-flat when I get to the end of my sermon,&#8221; Clayborn recalls.</p>
<p>Teresa L. Fry Brown, director of black church studies at Emory University in Atlanta, says people use to scoff at the itinerant &#8220;jackleg&#8221; preachers in the 1940s and 1950s who whooped their way through empty sermons, making up texts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another debate in the whooping world revolves around race: Can white preachers whoop?</p>
<p>Some black preachers say yes, and point to white pastors such as the Rev. Paula White.</p>
<p>Featured at many of Bishop T.D. Jakes&rsquo; events, White says she doesn&rsquo;t try to whoop. It&rsquo;s simply an &#8220;authentic&#8221; expression of her preaching passion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I whoop? Yes,&#8221; White says. &#8220;It&rsquo;s very natural for me. But I don&rsquo;t try to be black. I don&rsquo;t try to be white. All I know is to be me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet Clayborn, the homiletics professor in Ohio, says the fuel for the whoop grows out of the black perspective, the experience of being among &#8220;the least, the last and lost.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I see a white preacher do it, it feels like they went and learned it, just like a parrot can imitate the human voice,&#8221; he says. &#8220;They&rsquo;re like spiritual parrots.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The way I see it. Most black preachers do not really know the bible.  So they must use emotional, loud, attention getting tactics to impress their congregations.</p>
<p>Actually knowing and explaining the bible like a white preacher is beyond them. All the great preachers have been white. How many black preachers actually know what they are talking about tho? </p>

		<p>Having had the occasion to attend a funeral for a black lady many years ago, I was appalled at the conduct of 90% of the attendees. (My dad was the executor of this woman&rsquo;s estate - long story behind this). This was definitely not like any white funeral I have attended and the first and last time I set foot inside a black church. </p>
<p>Black ministers certainly have a different style than the typical white preacher. If the hooping and hollering are what blacks like, they are free to enjoy it. </p>

		<p>In Alabama before the war between the states, Blacks and whites were members of the same church in the community.Some churches had pews that were purchased by the family members and all sat together. Other churches had balconies for the slaves and many can be seen today in older churches. But believe it or not Black ministers were preferred before the war.I do not know if it was due to whooping or not. After the war the Black members withdrew from these churches and started their own churches.</p>

<p>I suppose that means, if you don&rsquo;t worship their way, you&rsquo;re not a &#8220;true&#8221; believer.</p>

		<p> No, &#8220;whooping&#8221; is not an art form. Black militants and idiot bleeding-heart Whites try to make every peculiarity of African culture into some kind of marvelous &#8220;creation.&#8221; Better yet, one that Whites then proceed to &#8220;steal from the black man.&#8221;</p>
<p> You say that Europeans tend to distrust emotion? That&rsquo;s a good habit to get into. Emotion can lead to riots, wars, genocide. All things common in Africa. Coincidence? I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p> And as to saying that White preachers can&rsquo;t &#8220;whoop,&#8221; or that if they can, they learned it like a parrot learns to imitate human speech, that is as laughable as a lot of things blacks and their subservient White liberal friends say. &#8220;The least, the last and the lost&#8221;? What a joke! Blacks in this country have been in the news, in our face, and in our pocketbooks for decades.</p>

		<p>If it is accurate to say &#8220;Whooping pastors use chanting, melody and call-and-response preaching to reach parishioners in a place where abstract preaching cannot penetrate&#8221;, maybe this &#8220;place where abstract preaching cannot penetrate&#8221; is between the parishioner&rsquo;s ears.  The displays of this sort of thing I have observed were very undignified, IMO, and are very questionable conduct taking place in a church.</p>
<p>Another little gem in this article I saw is &#8220;Teresa L. Fry Brown, director of black church studies at Emory University in Atlanta&#8221;. Director of black church studies?  Sounds like another created position, filled by an AA quota-satisfying minority.  And being &#8220;director&#8221; she is probably pulling down about $100 G&rsquo;s per year.</p>

<p>I had to look this one up.  It&rsquo;s another race-based PC graduate level degree program offering of questionable value from a top 20 national research university. Of course these types of programs are always offered at the best universities to make them &#8220;credible&#8221;.  The web page for the program: http://tiny.cc/otjpe4sblr</p>

		<p>Stop the whooping and hollering?   Deny black children the method and means to succeed and not be suspended from school?</p>
<p>According to California State Superintendent Jack O&rsquo;Connell, black children, educated in an oppressive White system, by White teachers who &#8216;do not understand them&rsquo;, need the &#8216;raucousness&rsquo; to close the suspension and achievement gap.</p>
<p><i>O&rsquo;Connell now believes that widespread cultural ignorance within the California school system is responsible for the poor academic performance of many black and Latino students in school.</i></p>
<p><i>[O&rsquo;Connell] offered the example of black children who learn at church that it&rsquo;s good to clap, speak loudly and be a bit raucous. But doing the same thing at school, where 72 percent of teachers are white and may be unfamiliar with such customs, will get them in trouble, he said.</i></p>
<p>I have a sinking feeling &#8216;whoopology&rsquo; may be the next pedagogical &#8216;break-through&rsquo; introduced into the schools, because as the State Superintendent explained at the &#8216;achievement summit&rsquo;:  </p>
<p><i>The achievement gap is &#8216;absolutely, positively not genetic&hellip;All kids can learn!</i></p>

		<p>Black preachers &#8220;whooping&#8221; like Little Richard is not exactly a major issue.</p>
<p>A bigger problem is the scam called The Prosperity Gospel (&#8220;Give me your money and I&rsquo;ll ask God to help you win the lottery&#8221;). </p>

		<p>I showed a clip from a black church to some people I know.  They were speechless at its craziness - people gyrating, the preacher making these strange, dramatic noises, the audience calling out randomly.  </p>
<p>To be fair, I have seen white pentecostals acting like drunken idiots in their services and in ways that make me feel as if they belong in a funny farm.</p>

		<p>In Africa, tens of thousands of years of environmental factors shaped a human being who is distinct from other races. </p>
<p>Fleeting opportunities, sexual and otherwise, caused the African to be loud and primally aggressive in his displays, both in appearance and behaviour.</p>

		<p>Loudness characterizes their culture. When my husband and I walk down the street and hear loud laughter (no words), and of us will say, &#8220;Black people.&#8221; Sure enough, when we get a glimpse of the laughing ones, they&rsquo;re black. <br>
Black and loud, no matter what, no matter where.</p>

		<p>Universally, primitive cultures are very physical and loud. You won&rsquo;t find pious modesty and respect for the sanctity of a house of worship anywhere in Africa, so why expect it here from blacks? To them sermons are just another reason to party, like they do in Nawlins at funerals. In the movie &#8220;Blues Brothers&#8221; Jake and Elwood stood out like sore thumbs in a black church where the parishioners were whooping and hollering and doing backflips in the aisles. It&rsquo;s a black thing&hellip;</p>
