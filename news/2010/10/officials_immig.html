<h1>Officials: Immigrants Who Left Returning</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Olson, Press-Enterprise (Riverside, California), October 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With signs of economic recovery growing, some immigrants who left the Inland area for their homelands after losing their jobs are returning to the United States, Mexican officials and leaders of local immigrant-assistance groups said.</p>
<p>U.S. unemployment is still high, but hope is rising, said José Mendoza Morfin, municipal president of Cotija, Mexico, the hometown of an estimated 2,000 Inland immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But migrants are cautious, Mendoza said. Some are returning to different regions than those they left, choosing to bypass high-unemployment states like California for places with more jobs, he said. Others are returning alone, leaving families behind in Mexico until the economy improves further, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nationally, the number of people who illegally crossed the border plummeted from an estimated 850,000 each year in the first half of the decade to about 300,000 annually from March 2007 to March 2009, according to a September report by the nonpartisan Pew Hispanic Center. The number of illegal  &mdash;  undocumented  &mdash;  immigrants living in the United States declined from its 2007 peak of 11.8 million to 10.8 million in 2009, according to U.S. Department of Homeland Security estimates.</p>
<p>FEWER PEOPLE HEADED SOUTH</p>
<p>But Inland immigrant-rights advocates said it has been months since they heard of families returning to Mexico for economic reasons.</p>
<p>Some Riverside County schools saw an unusually high number of Latin American and Asian immigrant parents pull their children out of school during the 2007-08 and 2008-09 academic years to return to their homelands, said county schools Superintendent Kenn Young. Last academic year, relatively few parents did so.</p>
<p>&#8220;The exodus appears to have stopped,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some immigrants may be moving to other states. Undocumented immigrants are more likely to relocate  &mdash;  whether abroad or within the United States  &mdash;  to look for work because they are ineligible for unemployment and other government benefits and because they are less likely to have strong roots in an area, said Karthick Ramakrishnan, an associate professor of political science at UC Riverside and an expert on immigration.</p>
<p>Even before the recession, illegal immigrants were increasingly settling outside California and other traditionally immigrant-heavy states, opting for states that previously had few immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} [One] reason more undocumented immigrants did not return to their homelands during the recession is because increased border security would have made it more expensive and difficult for them to cross back into the United States later.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also why some migrants who returned to Mexico aren&rsquo;t coming back to the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>PLANNING TO STAY IN MEXICO</p>
<p>Some immigrants who returned to Mexico because of the U.S. economic crisis say they have no desire to go back to the United States.</p>
<p>Albertano Hernández Castro, mayor of the small Michoacán town of Juárez, said jobs in the guava fields surrounding his town are plentiful and, even though they pay much less than U.S. positions, the cost of living  &mdash;  including often-rent-free housing  &mdash;  is lower.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s just because of the so-called &#8220;recovery&#8221; caused by Obama&rsquo;s stimulus, which anyone should know is bogus (or, at best, temporary) and fizzling out as we speak. 2010 is just a breather; the 2008-09 collapse in the brown population growth will start again next year. Who says there isn&rsquo;t any good news?</p>

		<p>Two things come to my mind.  (1) They smell amnesty in the air.  Either by legislation if Democrats don&rsquo;t do as poorly as expected, or by executive order, if they do.  Or, bitter Dems voted out of office then feel free to pass a hateful amnesty law in vindictive reprisal.  (2)  they are going to &#8220;other states&#8221; than what they left because those states who best know them are passing Arizona type laws or talking about doing so.  Which means if States are smart, they also will pass Arizona type laws so there is NO place left for illegals to invade, AND to send a clear message to Washington and the Supreme(ly arrogant) Court that they create a real Constitutional crisis if they vote that such laws are put aside when in fact they ARE consitutional and the majority of States will nullify by defiance if need be.<br>

<p>There are no signs of recovery, only signs of greater inflation, a falling dollar, more foreclosures, fewer jobs, and a promise of far greater debt, with countries ready to abandon the dollar.  That&rsquo;s why gold and silver are climbing to record levels everyday.</p>
<p>This is just another published lie by yellow journalists who think by pretending everything is o.k. it will be o.k. and they desperately want to see the migration of unskilled, uneducated hordes continue to water down the white population.</p>
<p>Case closed.</p>

		<p>How many times do I have to say it, they are not immigrants, they are illegals. As far as them leaving, I say good, let them ALL leave and not come back. Except for those that hire them for slave labor, they are not only of no benefit to Americans but greatly hurt us.</p>

		<p>Nothing ever really changes about the Mestizo-Peasant mentality.<br>
It does not belong in the USA and will find its basic<br>
requirements fufilled in Mexico. There is such a thing as race<br>
and it is deeper than all the rationalized egalitarian<br>
gibberish of the Left. The Mestizo will not change..the only way he can be accomodated fully is to change America permanently.<br>
Whites are now politically awake and are saying No More.<br>
We will not give up one more iota of our culture to suit<br>
those who dont belong here.</p>

		<p>The powers that be &#8216;outsourced&rsquo; most of our good jobs, in nearly all sectors, over the last 30 years, especially jobs in manufacturing.  </p>
<p>You would think that since the only jobs you can get these days are service ones or ones that require college, that there would be few jobs for foreigners to take.</p>
<p>But most white (and now Asian) businesses have thrown blacks off the bus in favor of more docile and cooperative latinos who also work for less.  Do black people even realize this?  I am amazed they have little clue that invading latino hordes are the reason for such high unemployment among blacks.</p>

<p>Watch the lame duck session of Congress very closely -they will ram an amnesty down our throats within six weeks of the elections. </p>
<p>We should have an ammendment to the Constitution that calls for a special vote to be cast the very day Any political figure leaves office -one that allows his constituents to decide if he gets <br>
A) Paid and given the thanks of a grateful populace.<br>
B) Nothing at all<br>
C) Stripped of every asset his family owns -to be put in the general fund- and then jailed for a term of no less than the time he or she served in office.<br>
We would have Responsible government for the very first time on this planet, and the likes of Pelosi and Obummer would never risk their lives and fortunes to run for office in the first place.</p>
