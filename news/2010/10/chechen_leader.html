<h1><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE69H3CV20101018">Chechen Leader Urges End to Bride Kidnapping</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reuters, October 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The head of Russia&rsquo;s Muslim Chechnya region Monday urged followers to &#8220;eradicate&#8221; the age-old practice of bride kidnapping, a tradition outlawed by Russian law, but still practiced in the region.</p>
<p>Analysts say the region&rsquo;s powerful leader Ramzan Kadyrov is facing increased pressure from his backers in the Kremlin to curb local traditions that violate federal laws, including what critics say are moves to introduce religious-based rules.</p>
<p>&#8220;I declare .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that we will root out once and for all from our society the kidnapping of young women,&#8221; Kadyrov said, according to Russian state-run news web site Vesti.ru.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The ancient practice of bride kidnapping, although now widely associated in Russia with Islam, was taking place in the Caucasus prior to its conversion to Islam, some 250 years ago.</p>
<p>The tradition is also practiced in post-Soviet central Asia.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kadyrov&rsquo;s condemnation of bride kidnapping, which is already outlawed in Russia, demonstrates the autonomy which Chechnya already enjoys.</p>
<p>&#8220;We follow Islam, which unequivocally condemns such a practice and which does not recognize marriage without the true consent of the girl,&#8221; Kadyrov was quoted as saying.</p>

		<p>Such a practice would have been adaptive in an area of sparse population, as in the pre-modern steppes. But it&rsquo;s time to move on. </p>

		<p>This has not been practiced by the Christians of the region for centuries. In modern times, it is practiced only by the Muslims.</p>

		<p>This is not a Muslim practice.  It was very common all over Eastern Europe and had a similar counter point in Western Europe.  I was married in a former Yugoslav country.  I asked about local customs while my bride and I were formulating our wedding plans.  A Serb friend told me that many villages would barricade the exists to prevent a man from another village from taking a bride out of town.  But if that man could bribe the brothers of his intended well enough, he would be allowed to take her away.  Dowrys were common all over Europe, as well.  In pre-Christian times, &#8220;stealing the bride&#8221; was a ritual that must go far back into prehistory.  Never-the-less, when I was married, about midnight, my landlord and a friend who his, who happened to be my receptionist&rsquo;s father (and lived very close to us), stole my bride away.  A car chase ensued.  We searched in the ruins of a castle, some trailheads of alpine paths, then some gostilnas in a few villages.  We finally ran the culprits down, and after I stole the keys out of the car the kidnappers had used, we ended the ordeal with bribes of schnapps at the gostilna.  It was a great deal of fun.  My Balkan wedding was the greatest day of my life, and lasted a day and a half.  Three day weddings are not uncommon.  Christians unsurprisingly, redily practice these quaint old rituals, regardless of the church, which can no longer burn them for it anyway.</p>
<p>Of course, this case is more extreme.  It goes back very far, I am sure.  For some reason (oh, let&rsquo;s guess), Muslim areas seem to retain the more brutish practices that have long been ritualized in much of Europe, even before the arrival of Christianity.  But I have to laugh when I see these female FOX News reporters sounding so alarmed over this story.  Like they will go over there and teach them some U.S. style Feminism.  Ha!</p>
<p>Those young Chechen women would do better for themselves if they didn&rsquo;t hang around on streets, dressed in skin tight jeans, etc.  Especially when they know that a matchmaking just failed.  I agree that it is over the top, and a primative act, but how can you live there and not know about it?  </p>
<p>Match-making is not such a dumb thing.  It sustained some old cultures, including European and very clearly Jewish culture, which would have long ago disapated without it.  IN FACT, WHITES NEED to revive matchmaking so that the WHITE RACE CAN BE SAVED.  When were young people ever wise enough to pick the best mates?  Certainly NOT TODAY!</p>

<p>Now, just a minute.  Isn&rsquo;t this going a bit too far?  First they want them to stop stoning women to death for adultry, then they want them to stop honor killings, and then to top it all off they&rsquo;re wanting to stop wife beatings.</p>
<p>This has got to stop somewhere. Enough is enough.  Pretty soon they won&rsquo;t even be able take a hatchet to their daughters for wearing lipstick.<br>
