<h1>Robeson&rsquo;s Legacy Should Be Celebrated, Not Attacked</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Courier News (Somerville, New Jersey), October 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Erick Opczynski, president of the Rutgers-Camden College Republicans, has started a campaign to rename the Paul Robeson Library on his campus because of the namesake&rsquo;s &#8220;radical socialism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Opczynski told the Philadelphia Daily News that Robeson was a &#8220;personal admirer of Josef Stalin&#8221; and had an &#8220;unsavory, almost disgraceful past.&#8221;</p>
<p>Opczynski seems to be channeling the blighted spirit of Joseph McCarthy, one of the most disgraced American politicians of the 20th century who smeared those suspected of being sympathetic of Communism. McCarthy was content to blacklist the living; Opczynski wants to blacklist the dead.</p>
<p>Robeson, a black man who was born in Princeton in 1898 and raised in Somerville, was a 20th Century Renaissance man. Robeson, whose father was a slave, was an exceptional athlete at Rutgers and a world-famous actor and singer. A civil rights pioneer, he was celebrated internationally not only for his enormous talents but for his courageous battles for social justice and equality.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Robeson&rsquo;s passion for justice never died and his struggle for justice never ended. In 1958, Robeson told the members of the House Committee on Un-American Activities, who led the paranoid persecution, &#8220;you are the un-Americans, and you ought to be ashamed of yourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those same words apply to Opczynski and his fellow travellers in the growing culture of hatred and intolerance that&rsquo;s poisoning American culture.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Opczynski is a poster child for those who shoot off their mouths first, then examine the facts. His wrong-headed campaign is characteristic of the depths to which political and cultural discourse has descended in this country. In a political and cultural climate dominated by vitriol, the rant has replaced the voice of reason.</p>
<p>Robeson deserves to be revered and respected. At a time when black people were treated in this country like second-class citizens, Robeson was a pioneer for civil rights. It&rsquo;s hard for today&rsquo;s college students to imagine that not so long ago, Robeson lived in a country in which blacks were subjected to segregation and institutionalized racism.</p>
<p>Robeson fought a brave battle against intolerance. {snip}<br>

		<p>This writer&rsquo;s problem seems that he or she can&rsquo;t seem to think that one can be a hard core admirer of Stalin and Marxism and an advocate for black civil rights, at the same time.  It is my contention that Robeson believed in civil rights because he believed in Marxism, and he believed in Marxism because he believed in civil rights.  Karl Marx himself not only advocated civil rights, he called the concept &#8220;a revolution in permanence,&#8221; because, as history has plainly shown, racism, sexism, and every other &#8220;ism&#8221; and &#8220;phobia&#8221; the left combats will never be cured, and therefore, the civil rights struggle will always exist.</p>

		<p>Robeson was a Communist. He worshiped Stalin and betrayed his own friends in the Soviet Union by being silent on their murder and imprisonment. As his own friends were being slaughtered by Stalin, Robeson kept alive the lie that everything was wonderful under communism; even when he knew it wasn&rsquo;t true. He was a liar &amp; a coward who hated everything about America and Western Civilization. It is way past time that Robeson be condemned for the traitor he was. </p>

		<p>Rutgers has a number of things named after Robeson in New Brunswick as well.  Doesn&rsquo;t deserve it.  More interesting is the fact that the article has no by-line and doesn&rsquo;t sight any facts about Robeson that deserve praise.  And calling someone a McCarthyite is bogus because McCarthy was right and we know he was right based on the East German and Russian files that became available after the fall of the Berlin Wall.</p>

		<p>Robeson was an avowed blatant communist.  Communism&rsquo;s goal was to destroy democracy/capitalism and achieve world domination.  Was this to be tolerated? In America a communist party can exist. Do you think there was ever a Capitalistic party in the Soviet Union? So while allowing freedom of speech, the FBI rightly questioned and watched the known and suspected communists in America and Robeson was one of them. He should have stuck with singing and acting and having affairs with loose women.</p>

		<p>If Paul Robeson was against intolerance, then why did he lick the boots and sing the praises of one of the most intolerant men who walked the face of the earth, Josef Stalin? The millions of Russians, Poles, Ukrainians and others slaughtered by Stalin&rsquo;s goons, because they resisted his programs and policies; might not have agreed that Stalin was &#8220;tolerant&#8221;. Stalin also remarked, &#8220;We do not give them ideas. Why would we give them guns?&#8221; This was referring to the average Soviet Ivan and Tatiana.</p>
<p>Amrenners may know that there&rsquo;s a video on YouTube of Paul Robeson singing the Soviet national anthem. More than anything else, this confirms he was a &#8220;useful idiot&#8221; for the USSR. This is similar to the Bantu U.S. Congress members who sing Castro&rsquo;s praises. Robeson sucked up to the Soviets, because he was enamored with their communist ideology, which promised to give free welfare benefits to the &#8220;downtroden&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Robeson was a supporter of Stalin; that much seems to be a fact. Opczynski is just raising a valid point. This move to rename various places seems to have originated with the black and PC crowd. However, it should work both ways. You usually get screams of indignation from this crowd if one wants to actually examine one of their sacred cows. The more you look into the actual nature of most of their heros the more you see how shabby they actually were.  </p>

		<p><i>Robeson deserves to be revered and respected.</i></p>
<p>Sure he does  &mdash;  by any/all modern-day Soviet Bosses  &mdash;   because for them, Robeson served as the <i>ultimate useful idiot.</i></p>
<p>Discover the Networks reports:</p>
<p><i>In 1935 Robeson.. visited the Soviet Union and said:  &#8220;Here, for the first time, I walk in human dignity.&#8221;  He soon became a dedicated Stalinist.</i></p>
<p>During a concert tour of the USSR in 1949, Robeson learned of Stalin&rsquo;s planned liquidation of Soviet Jews [but] chose not to tell anyone&hellip; since to do so would have hurt the Soviet cause in the Cold War. Upon returning to America, he told the press&hellip; that he had seen &#8216;Jewish people [living freely] all over the place&rsquo;; that he had heard &#8216;not one word about&rsquo; Soviet anti-Semitism; and that the rumors of Yiddish writers being executed were utterly false. He did not even tell his comrades in the American Communist Party what he knew of the USSR&rsquo;s treatment of Jews. </p>
<p>Stalin recognized Robeson&rsquo;s loyalty and thus awarded him the Stalin Peace Prize in 1953. After the dictator died later that year, Robeson wrote him a tribute entitled &#8216;To You, Beloved Comrade.&rsquo; </p>
<p>So, yes, to blacks and other useful idiots, those striving for Communist diktat over liberty, Robeson represents Civil Rights and Social Justice and any White who says otherwise is &#8216;growing a culture of hatred and intolerance that is poisoning American Culture.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Old Soviet Bosses would indeed be proud  &mdash;  proud of the useful idiots that continue to defend them and their indefensible, murderous government.</p>

		<p>There have been a few articles written about this issue and this republican student. Many of them seem inaccurate or completely inverted. Robeson became a celebrated hero for his beliefs and not just among black teachers and school children, and of course those who named so many schools after him. </p>

		<p>Why do they want to defend him, because he&rsquo;s black or because he was a communist who actually did go to Russia?</p>
<p>Whats &#8216;funny&rsquo; is that universities and even employers have graveyards filled with the deposed careers of conservatives, or those deemed by the left as &#8216;insensitive&rsquo;. Most Whites are afraid to even speak. I guess your words and thoughts are only free if you are a communist. Certainly not if you are a racist, and definitely not if you oppose a program like affirmative action on campus. That makes you about 10 levels below Paul Robeson.</p>

		<p>McCarthy was an opportunist (but then, aren&rsquo;t all politicians?).  However, that does NOT make McCarthy wrong in his assertion that Government and State Dept were riddled with Marxists, communists, and homosexuals (who were very likely black mailed into providing aid to the Soviet Union through &#8220;honey traps&#8221;).   They hate McCarthy because he was a Republican.  They adore Jack and Bobby Kennedy because they were democrats, and one served on McCarthy&rsquo;s committee, and the other hated communists and approved a plot to kill Castro.  However they are NOT vilified, called evil, or taken to task for THEIR belief that our government was (and still is) riddled with socialists and marxists.  Funny how that always works out that way with the liberals and their propaganda arm, the MSM, huh?</p>

		<p>Hey, no liberal bias in this article, huh?  Say what you will about Robeson&rsquo;s talents, athletic or artistic, but he was not only a Communist, but a hard-line Stalinist.  That is fact.   The documentary evidence is overhwelming and has been available for years.  The article of course ignores such uncomfortable truths in favor of ad hominem attacks on this young critic, whom they judge while knowing nothing about him.  Robeson openly stated that anyone who lifted a hand against the Soviet government ought to be shot, educated his son in Moscow, argued that Stalin was a great humanitarian, and as a Stalin worshipper, he had NO problems with socialists being persecuted, or even Reds if they were Trotskyites or deviated from the Stalinist line in any way.  Simply put, Robeson hated the country from which he came and that in fact allowed him to flourish as a creative personality, a meritocratic nation in which determined blacks could at least endeavor to petition their government.  Where even blacks could travel, write, sing, speak, earn a living, keep their wealth, distinguish themselves personally and professionally, and vote, even at the height of the Jim Crow era. Did any of that apply to ANYONE in the Worker&rsquo;s Paradise, however white he/she may have been?  This hypocrite accepted a Peace Medal from Stalin and entertained the Bolshevik-led International Brigades in Spain on behalf of the the &#8220;Republic&#8221; that tortured, carried out a mini-Holocaust against Catholic clergy, and callously shipped the Spanish people&rsquo;s gold reserves to Odessa in exchange for Russian arms and military personnel. He actually had the gall to state that there was &#8220;no racism&#8221; in Russia, as Uncle Joe slaughtered, starved and purged every ethnic and racial minority in the USSR, devoured half of Poland, raped the Baltic States, invaded innocent Finland (got a rude little singe to his mustache in that instance) and broke his own people to terrified obedience.  Tim Tzoulidias&rsquo; gut wrenching and masterful book &#8220;The Forsaken&#8221;, published in 2008 about Americans who were daft enough to emigrate to the Soviet Union during the Depression, gives consderable detail about this wonderful lover of mankind and his fool ravings in praise of the Communist Hell.  And this charge of intolerance coming from the left is the height of hilarity and brazen gall anyway  &mdash;  aren&rsquo;t THEY the ones obsessed with renaming and Bowdlerizing everything, from schools named after Columbus, Washington, Jefferson, Jackson, etc. to decades-old children&rsquo;s books, to teams named for Indians or Confederates?  But don&rsquo;t suggest revoking anything named for one of THEIR sacred cows, &#8216;cause they don&rsquo;t like the shoe to be slipped onto the other foot, not once, not ever. Wait until they launch their next maniac jihad  &mdash;  that will be the mad quest to rename everything for Obama.  I give it five years tops before they commence, even if the narcissist fiend is a one-termer.  I&rsquo;d accept naming a block of public toilets for the vicious little stick-figure fop, but not much else. </p>

		<p>One way to understand how we have lost our culture is that Paul Robeson High School in New York City was Alexander Hamilton High School before being re-named.  A visit to the current high school&rsquo;s website has the the usual statements about cultural heritage, global warming, empowerment, etc. </p>

<p>In all fairness, plenty of white leftists gave Stalin a pass, especially around the time of World War II when we made an alliance with one evil mass murderer to defeat another evil mass murderer.  And I&rsquo;m sure that many of those white leftists still have their names gracing various buildings and institutions.</p>

		<p>I am not an admirer  of Robeson, but I question the tactics of these Republicans. Robeson is dead and gone; few Americans under 75 even recognize his name. Why waste effort on yesterday&rsquo;s issues? The time to protest was when the library was being named, not now. Communism is also a yesterday issue with Rutger&rsquo;s students. They should focus on today&rsquo;s issues: immigration, fedgov insolvency, and persecution of non-wealthy white males. Oh, I forgot, these are republicans, and republicans don&rsquo;t care about serious issues.  </p>

		<p>There is no proof anywhere to this day that Paul Robeson was ever a member of the Communist Party, in any country, had he been he would have been jailed under the Smith Act. The fact that his passport was confiscated under The McCarran act shows how far the US government really did go to attack anyone they chose. His options as a black man searching for tolerance were limited. He achieved more in education, film and art than most people ever will, despite what you may have felt about his views. Robeson was now different than millions of other who foolishly thought the USSR, with all its defects might be an alternative to Jim Crow and imperialism. To view his life from a white hindsight preceptive in the 21st century not only shows how little most know of him but is just sour grapes. </p>

<p>Even if what you purport is true, it still doesn&rsquo;t erase Paul Robeson being a useful idiot of the Soviet Union. OK, so he had an ability to sing, so what? So did many others. It&rsquo;s not sour grapes, it&rsquo;s the TRUTH. Robeson should not be made into some sort of demi-god, just because he starred in &#8220;The Emperor Jones&#8221; and sang &#8220;Old Man River&#8221;. Nor should every public building or park in New Jersey or elsewhere be named after him. </p>
