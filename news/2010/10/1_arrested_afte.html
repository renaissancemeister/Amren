<h1>1 Arrested After Man Found Decapitated in Chandler</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KNXV-TV (Phoenix), October 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After discovering the slain man, detectives began an investigation and eventually arrested 36-year-old Crisantos Moroyoqui. He was arrested on suspicion of second-degree murder and hindering prosecution.</p>
<p>The victim is a man in his 30s. His name is being withheld until his family is notified.</p>
<p>Police are now asking for the public&rsquo;s help to locate three men, Juan Campos Morales Aguilar, Jose David Castro Reyes, and a man known only as &#8220;El Joto&#8221;, also suspected in the attack.</p>
<p>Aguilar is described as a Hispanic male, 5 feet 10 inches tall, 220 pounds, with short dark hair and a thin mustache. He was seen wearing a black shirt, white t-shirt and jeans.</p>
<p>Reyes is also a Hispanic male, 5 feet 10 inches tall, 180 pounds with short hair and a clean-shaven face. He was last seen wearing a white shirt, white t-shirt and blue jeans.</p>
<p>The third suspect is a Hispanic male, between 5 feet 2 inches and 5 feet 4 inches tall, thin build with short spiked black hair and a goatee.  He was last seen wearing a white t-shirt with a black pattern shirt and Levis.</p>

		<p>If anyone had any doubt that these criminal invaders would behead white women, children as well as white men, they should be disabused of them right now. Then arm themselves, teach their children to how to use guns and avoid Hispanics. We should demand illegals who commit violent crimes here be executed as enemy combatants by the state. If Muslim terrorists can be eliminated this way, so can criminal illegal aliens. That is precisely what they are, and whites should at every opportunity kill them when these illegal aliens attempt to rob, assault, rape or murder them.</p>

		<p>Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer took some heat a few months ago for stating that there were beheadings in the Arizona desert near the &#8220;border.&#8221;  She backtracked, but it appears now that she should have waited.  I suppose when it comes to certain groups of people, you&rsquo;re either right, or you will eventually be right.</p>

<p>Ha!  You have to love their colorful nicknames, this one is derogatory slang for a homosexual male.  What a nice culture we&rsquo;re importing.</p>

		<p>Actually Brewer corrected herself after the media jumped on her with all 4 paws saying &#8220;there could be beheadings&#8221; and she was correct as clearly this will help her now politically and silence her opponents. </p>

		<p>Would you like another helping of Shrubya&rsquo;s &#8220;family values&#8221; with your greasy bowl of menudo?</p>
<p>Phoenix is already the kidnap capitol of the US, and it isn&rsquo;t us &#8220;racist Anglos who need to go back to Europe&#8221; who are committing these abductions.  Brewer should have stuck to her guns and told the MSM to eff themselves.</p>
<p>If I were POTUS, I would have Predator and Reaper drones patrolling the border, with orders that &#8220;accidental&#8221; incursions by the Mexican military receive the same AGM-114N Hellfire greeting as the narcos.  They&rsquo;re only $68,000, which is cheaper than locking folks up.  I think with this plan implemented, Mexico would go back to being an acceptable neighbor.</p>
