<h1>Promote Hispanics Above Whites at College</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>American Third Position, October 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Major corporations such as FedEx, Lowe&rsquo;s, McDonald&rsquo;s, Wells Fargo, Verizon, the Wachovia Foundation, and dozens of others, have all lined up to financially support a private organization dedicated to ensuring that Hispanics get to college ahead of white American kids.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Hispanic Scholarship Fund&#8221; (HSF) says that it &#8220;aims to put a degree in every Latino household by 2025&#8221; through its affirmative action program in college recruitment.</p>
<p>Funding for the HSF comes from a large number of corporations, which, according to that organization&rsquo;s website, include the FedEx Corporation; the Mazda Foundation; KLASS Time; GMAC Financial Services; Lowe&rsquo;s; the McNamara Family Foundation, Inc.; Goldman Sachs; Procter &amp; Gamble; Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., Inc.; the Verizon Foundation; McDonald&rsquo;s; Target; the Morgan Stanley Foundation; Nissan North America, Inc.; the Sallie Mae Fund; Wells Fargo; the Draper Family Foundation; the Shell Oil Company; the Wachovia Foundation and the UPS Foundation, amongst many others.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It obviously does not concern these corporations in the slightest that their money is used specifically to exclude white Americans from support.</p>
<p>On the HSF&rsquo;s website, under their &#8220;Frequently Asked Questions&#8221; section, the policy is spelled out in no uncertain terms:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I have to be Hispanic/Latino to apply?&#8221; is the question the website asks.</p>
<p>The answer is equally frank: &#8220;Yes. You or your family must be descended from at least one of the following countries: Spain, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Uruguay, Paraguay, Cuba, Puerto Rico, or the Dominican Republic. Students from Brazil are eligible to apply. However, students from Belize, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana are not considered Hispanic.&#8221;</p>
<p>The HSF says that it aims to &#8220;raise the rate of degree achievement [amongst Hispanics] from 19 percent to 60 percent.&#8221;</p>

		<p>In an inner city high school I worked at for three years, which had about 70% Hispanic population and the rest blacks, the college guidance counselor bragged at graduation ceremononies about the amount of scholarship money, totalling in the millions of dollars, the school had arranged for the graduates.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in the public schools of southwest Virginia which I visited recently, near coal mining country in the Appalachians, I&rsquo;m sure that the relatively impoverished students of European descent, some of whose ancestors fought in the Revolutionary War, received only a small fraction of scholarship money that goes to black and Hispanic students each year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time whites began to think of themselves as the largest minority group in a nation of minorities and begin to push back socially and politically in ways similar to what the other minorities already do in this country.  </p>

 With a nation wide rate of graduation being about 33%* for all races this seems to be the case here&hellip;<br/>

		<p>&#8220;FedEx, Lowe&rsquo;s, McDonald&rsquo;s, Wells Fargo, Verizon, the Wachovia Foundation, and dozens of others [corporation] are merely following the lead of America&rsquo;s elite universities. There the bias against lower-income whites is profound:<br/>
  <br/>
&ldquo;When lower-class whites are matched with lower-class blacks and other non-whites the degree of the non-white advantage becomes astronomical: lower-class Asian applicants are seven times as likely to be accepted to the competitive private institutions as similarly qualified whites, lower-class Hispanic applicants eight times as likely, and lower-class blacks ten times as likely. These are enormous differences and reflect the fact that lower-class whites were rarely accepted to the private institutions Espenshade and Radford surveyed. Their diversity-enhancement value was obviously rated very low.&rdquo; </p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s a nice list of corporations for Americans to boycott. </p>
<p>Send them a quick email politely letting them no that you will no longer do business with corporations that do direct harm to the educational prospects of your family and loved ones.</p>
<p>University admissions is a zero sum game where a spot offered to a (often less qualified) hispanic comes at the expense of a position denied to an often better qualified white. </p>
<p>Let them know that their politically opportunistic support of institutionalized racism will ultimately fail because there are a lot more white Americans than any other kind and we are getting VERY tired of the corporate sponsored anti-white discrimination. </p>

		<p>Even some Catholic High Schools are doing this.  My daughter heard an lunch room announcement about a Summer Science Program that was being offered at the local State University and those interested should visit the Guidence Office.  My daughter was interested and when she got to the Guidence Office she was told that its was a mistake and that only Blacks and Hispanics could qualify for this summer program. She called me at work crying and when I called the school, I got brushed off.  White people in America do not have any future so we better plan to break away an form our own homeland here in North America.</p>

		<p>We must recognize the fact that a lot of these corporations are no longer lily-white at the top.  Ditto with the government (i.e., government regulators, EEOC, Justice Department, etc.).  Of course, there&rsquo;s plenty of traitorous whites in them, too!<br/>

<p>I doubt this, but there is a very simple way to accomplish this without the appearance of any form of racism.  Simply set up a private scholarship fund and make it available to black and white students only, the way that these scholarships are available to only hispanics.  Since it&rsquo;s available to blacks as well as whites, no one could conceivably cry &#8220;racism,&#8221; now could they?  Also, make the scholarships &#8220;needs based&#8221; but only to a certain, directly stated threshold  &mdash;  if your family is below a certain yearly income, you are considered, but considered only  &mdash;  your family&rsquo;s economic situation is not a determining factor in being awarded a scholarship, only in being considered for one.  Oh, and the kicker  &mdash;  award the scholarships entirely on academic merit.  Well, I&rsquo;m sure they could find something racist about that if they choose.</p>

		<p>Many if not most of the scholarship recipients will be white people from the middle or ruling classes of nations like El Salvador. There are college grads from these nations today; the top grads at the top schools, there and here, are white. Race trumps liberal waste of resources every time. But since the shareholders of these firms don&rsquo;t or can&rsquo;t object, let the corporate waste begin. </p>
<p>Are these firms going to guarantee jobs to recipients, BTW, especially if they realize who really will qualify? In other words, once La Raza or someone screams that white Nicaraguans,Chileans, and not mestizos, Peruvian Incas or Brazilian blacks, are going to Harvard on corporate scholarships, will the foundation managing the program conduct color coded tests, language tests(the heavier the accent, the more you qualify?)</p>

		<p>Just on the TV last night on minorities in higher education: A black high school youth was seen as having college potential, even though he had a C average! They were desperate to get him scholarship aid to help with the $50,000 tuition bill! Would they do the same for a white student? Of course not. The sense of drama and urgency for this budding genius was absolutely ridiculous! You would have thought they had the next Einstein. I believe his major was performing arts or something similiar.</p>
<p> Wow, I had similiar grades back in high school. I was told to attend a community college. I am glad I did. I paid for it myself, learned a darn good lesson in responsibility and setting goals, saved tons of money, and received some excellent instruction. My GPA? 4.0!!! </p>

		<p>Many people fantasize about what they&rsquo;d do if they were rich.  Some dream about big mansions and yachts, others just about how many pretty women they&rsquo;d be able to bed.  If I were rich I&rsquo;d set up a scholarship only for whites.  There would be a media mania about it as everyone from Glenn Beck to Rachel Maddow condemns me.  I would calmly point out the numerous scholarships only available to non-whites, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Millennium Scholarship that is available to all races <i>except</i> whites.  That wouldn&rsquo;t stop them from labeling me a Nazi though.<br/>

		<p>So they want a degree in every latino household by 2025?  </p>
<p>There has never been a degree in every white household.  Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better and more &#8216;post-racial&rsquo; to say they want a degree in every AMERICAN household by&hellip;?</p>
<p>I worked in a school that was 70% latino and 30% black.  It was still one of those schools where all the benefits were focused on blacks (because the latino explosion had happened only in the last 2-3 years).</p>
<p>The latino students used to get mad, and the black students used to gloat, about all the &#8216;black-only&rsquo; scholarships, free programs and such that were always pushed.</p>
<p>Now I work in a full-up latino school.  When the outside latino activists come in and explain all the latino-only scholarships, I secretly fume inside at the racism of it all.  My kids probably won&rsquo;t get any scholarships, especially since they&rsquo;re not black or latino.</p>

		<p>On the face of it, boycotts sound like a great idea. The back story may be, however, that if these companies do NOT knuckle under and cough-up, they will be pilloried in the press, have demonstrators yelling outside their corporate offices, and the (alleged) Justice Department conducting investigations.  And let&rsquo;s not leave out the most useful tool the politicians have: the IRS and their ability to shut down a business or tie it up in knots for years with audits.</p>
<p>In short: these companies are paying &#8220;go away&#8221; money, just like insurance companies pay $10,000 to an auto accident sue-er to drop their $500K claim.</p>

		<p>Corporations have been very active behind the scenes in shaping  America.</p>
<p>They spend enormous sums of money on figuring out who spends, how much they spend, and on what. With this information, they influence media, law-makers, private and public institutions, and society, to promote consumption of their products. </p>
<p>This strategy to socially elevate Hispanics is to ensure that, in the future, they will be more politically and economically competitive with whites.  </p>
<p>Once the U.S. is fractured into a multiplicity of competing minority races, it will be politically weak and divided. </p>
<p>The corporate elites, safe behind laws which rival those of the state, will then have more power than ever.<br/>

		<p>To Had Enough:<br/>
You don&rsquo;t have to be rich to start a scholarship! A couple of years ago it was featured on one of the weekly news shows about an elderly African-American woman who had been either a laundry worker or did cleaning her entire life. She had still managed to save enough by the end of her life to start a scholarship available to black females only. Her reason, I believe, was that if she had such a scholarship available to her when she was young, she could have gone to college herself. So, she wanted to make the scholarhip for black females only, no white could apply. This received attention in the news, but I did not follow it.Perhaps someone out there has some information.<br/>
 <br/>
I will say it again: let&rsquo;s start a scholarship for whites only, preferably who speak English as their primary language. </p>

		<p>bill gates of microsoft fame set up a scholarship program that specifically excluded whites.<br/>
We whites could run with this idea to preserve the white areas of our society.  When you sell your house, set it up as a &#8220;scholarship&#8221; with very strict criteria.  One is having the money or conditional mortgage approval to purchase the house.  Those of different races could be summarily excluded because they do not meet the &#8220;criteria&#8221;.</p>

		<p>same as the university of iowa, if you&rsquo;re black foreign, you go for free, while whites pay. they even have a division called - international studies department. feminazis have seen to getting this garbage setup - legal reverse discrimination. AND OUR Us tax dollars PAY for it, at this state funded institution.<br/>
worst money I ever spent- to get a degree there. <br/>
foreigners, blacks and those with &#8216;low intellect&rsquo; also get a full pass, if they happen to be non-white. more discrimination.</p>
