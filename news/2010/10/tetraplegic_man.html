<h1><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wiltshire-11595485">Tetraplegic Man&rsquo;s Life Support &#8216;Turned Off by Mistake&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, October 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An agency nurse working for the NHS was filmed switching off her patient&rsquo;s life support machine by mistake.</p>
<p>Tetraplegic Jamie Merrett, 37, had a bedside camera set up at his home in Wiltshire, after becoming concerned about the care he was receiving.</p>
<p>Within days, it captured the moment Violetta Aylward switched off the ventilator, leaving him brain-damaged.</p>
<p>Ambition 24hours, which supplied her, said it could not comment as an internal investigation was continuing.</p>
<p>A confidential report by Wiltshire social services into the incident  &mdash;  leaked to the BBC&rsquo;s Inside Out programme  &mdash;  concluded the agency was fully aware it was required to supply a nurse with training in the use of a ventilator, but the company did not have adequate systems in place to check what training their staff had received.</p>
<p>Mr Merrett, from Devizes, has been cared for at home on a life-support machine since 2002 after being left paralysed from the neck downwards following a road accident.</p>
<p>Despite his disabilities, he was able to talk, use a wheelchair and operate a computer using voice-activated technology.</p>
<p>His sister Karren Reynolds said he had become increasingly worried about serious errors involving nurses operating his ventilator, but claimed that health bosses did not act on e-mails of concern which he sent them.</p>
<p>In January 2009, he arranged to have a camera installed in his room. A few days later, the ventilator was switched off.</p>
<p>After 21 minutes, the machine was eventually restarted by paramedics but by then Mr Merrett had suffered serious brain damage.</p>
<p><b>Legal action</b></p>
<p>Ms Reynolds, who is considering legal action, said his level of understanding had dropped to that of a young child.</p>
<p>&#8220;His life is completely changed. He doesn&rsquo;t have a life now,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has an existence but it&rsquo;s nowhere near what it was before. He is very brain damaged compared to what he was before. He was a highly intelligent man and you could have long in-depth conversations with him and now it tends to be more simplistic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Violetta Aylward A review found the firm that supplied Ms Aylward did not have adequate systems to check staff training</p>
<p>The solicitor acting for Mr Merrett, Seamus Edney of SJ Edney in Swindon, said: &#8220;In my experience, this is the worst case of negligence on the part of a nurse.</p>
<p>&#8220;No-one has come forward to make any admission, so now almost two years after the event we are trying to get someone to admit liability for what has happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>The NHS Wiltshire Primary Care Trust said in a statement: &#8220;[We have] put in place a series of actions to ensure that such an event will not occur again either for this patient or others. The incident is the subject of likely litigation so the PCT is restricted in what further it may say in public.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ms Aylward has been suspended while the incident is investigated by the Nursing and Midwifery Council.</p>
<p>Their guidelines say a nurse should work within their level of competence and have the skills to undertake whatever care they are delivering.</p>
<p>Ms Aylward, who is from Reading, has not responded to requests for an interview.</p>

		<p>With our aging (predominately white) population, the need for these types of nursing, hospice and special care facilities will skyrocket in the next few decades.</p>
<p>The number of non whites working in these facilities to care for our aging White population will also skyrocket.</p>
<p>Factor in affirmative action and we have a future with these types of incidents occurring often&hellip;not to mention deliberate abuse and bad treatment.     </p>

This should serve as a warning to any Englishman or American who believes that multicultural hospitals with a backward foreign staff will serve at the same high standard as hospitals used to decades ago.<br>
If you are termially ill and cannot find a superior white hospital remember to save the last bullet for yourself.</p>

		<p>An act of East Asian&rsquo;s cruelty and passive-aggressiveness.  Don&rsquo;t be fooled by the placid facade of East Asians.  I&rsquo;m sure if the BBC didn&rsquo;t put up a picture of &#8220;Violetta Aylward&#8221; people would assume she was white because it&rsquo;s a white name.</p>

		<p>Aylward is a Welsh name. Funny, but she doesn&rsquo;t look Welsh.</p>
<p>Interestingly, two &#8220;youths&#8221; are being questioned by police today in the death of a 15 year old Welsh girl named Aylward:<br>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what race this woman is, but I know for a fact the greed mongers are doing their best to include as many non-whites as they can in every aspect of health care.  Qualifications mean nothing to them.  </p>
<p>Also big chain pharmacies have been pushing black pharmacists on us more and more here lately, and it CANNOT be denied that these people are unqualified affirmative action gimme&rsquo;s who have been passed and certified to meet a black quota.  They&rsquo;re going to get many people killed with their incompetence.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a typical case.  One of them wrote on a mouthhwash for a man who had his jaw wired shut after an assault, &#8220;Gargle and swallow.&#8221;  Luckily the patient checked the directions in his medical book and discovered that there was a severe warning:  Do not swallow! If he had done so, he would have been subjected to uncontrollable vomiting and would have likely suffocated since his jaw was locked in place.  She thought nothing of it when it was brought to her attention via telephone.  &#8220;It was a typo, she said.  Bring it back and I&rsquo;ll correct it.&#8221;</p>
<p>A typo?  Absurd.  The patient is bringing legal action against the pharmacy.  I&rsquo;d like to see thousands of such cases occur, as well as others in medical care.</p>
<p>I could cite another dozen incidents just from my neighborhood area, but the aforementioned is typical.  But I might add this one:  A prescription for a blood thinner was filled with pills from the drawer to the left of the right one, by one black.  They were a kind of diet pill, which accelerates the heartbeat and could well have cost the patient his life if he had not noticed there was a slight difference in the shape which prompted him to go back to the store asking if he had the right prescription. </p>
<p>The only way to put a halt to this nonsense is to sue, sue sue.  When these greedy corporate types pay out enough in claims they might be able to figure out what they&rsquo;re doing is wrong.<br>

		<p>What frightens me about this is the question should they have hired a more expensive care taker, like a registered nurse?  An actual medically trained person who has been around medical devises, and can see that a human was attached to the machine with wires and/or tubes or hoses.  She was working within her competencies, she knows how to turn off a light switch and a ventilator.  </p>
<p>Where was the agency in the beginning?  &#8220;And this devise must stay on at all times.&#8221;  Was there a supervisor to introduce her to the patient?  And they had enough concerns to begin with to install a camera to observe him and the level of care her got.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s bad enough the man was paralyzed but now he&rsquo;s brain damaged as well. In my opinion, the nurse and agency are more concerned about how it will affect <i>them</i> than in how it destroyed what was left of this man&rsquo;s life.</p>

		<p>This is coming to pass, and that is the fact that non-White Doctors, nurses, caretakers and other health &#8220;professionals&#8221; are not only nowhere near as competent as Whites are, but their innate hostility towards Whites will assist and does assist them in not caring properly for any Whites under their so-called care.  At the very least even if they were as competent, their natural racial and ethnic loyalties make them form bonds with people of their own kind.  They&rsquo;re more likely to do better or their best for their own kind rather than for Whites.  If it&rsquo;s a choice between a White and one of their own they naturally as a matter of course will do better for one of their own.  This is only common sense.  Couple this innate loyalty to their own with a lower level of competence and their anger towards Whites because they themselves weren&rsquo;t born White - and Whites are going to die off faster than we thought.  This is of course what they want.  They want our money, our neighborhoods, our way of life - and our political power.  They don&rsquo;t have to be PhD&rsquo;s in psychology to know that we are a dying race of people.  We refuse to stand up and fight for our rights and we&rsquo;ve let this worldwide negative conditioning program of collective White guilt interfere with our reasoning.  If we don&rsquo;t come to our senses soon we are going to dissappear and leave Europe, Australia, and North America to these brown-skinned races.</p>

		<p>Reminds me of my dearly departed aunt:<br>
When she was dying in a Denver hospital, she looked around at the hatians, philipinos, etc., which were making an abomination of healthcare or respect for the dying, my Aunt said:<br>
&#8220;Take me home; these are not my people, this is not my country.&#8221; She was taken home to die in dignity and peace, away from third world incompotents and malcontents.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Gnome Chompski&#8221; is mistaken; the name Aylward is not Welsh but English. It comes from the Anglo-Saxon &#8220;Aethelweard&#8221; - literally Noble Guard.</p>

<p>My grown children already know NOT to put me in any of those places. I will die at home. Problem is there are no White doctors, etc. where I live any longer. What few there are, are already taken. Most of us without the money for private insurance have to settle for 3rd world &#8220;doctors&#8221; and nurses. America is a land that isn&rsquo;t fit to live in, let alone die in, if you are White.</p>
<p> How could we have allowed this nation to become what it is today? And to think that we will leave our children and grandchildren in this 3rd world hellhole that we helped create. </p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it time that WE did something to reverse it, before we all die off? </p>
