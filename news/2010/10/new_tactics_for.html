<h1><a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2010/10/04/prsa1004.htm">New Tactics for Diversity: Creating Doctors From All Racial, Ethnic Groups</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carolyne Krupa, American Medical News, October 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This summer, [Rhoda] Asimeng completed a program at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, N.Y., designed to encourage black, Hispanic and American Indian high school and college students to pursue a medical career. Asimeng, who is black, and other interns spent the summer attending lectures, doing research, learning medical techniques, and following physicians and other health care professionals.</p>
<p>Montefiore&rsquo;s program is one example of efforts taking place nationwide to increase the diversity of the physician work force by attracting more racial and ethnic minorities to medical schools.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the same time, the Assn. of American Medical Colleges&rsquo; Holistic Review Project is encouraging schools to re-evaluate admissions policies to ensure that they graduate physicians who can serve an increasingly diverse population.</p>
<p>U.S. Surgeon General Regina Benjamin, MD, has challenged health leaders to increase the number of minority physicians, a figure that has remained about the same as it was a century ago.</p>
<p>In 2006, Hispanics made up 5% of the nation&rsquo;s physicians, while 3.5% of doctors were black and fewer than 1% were American Indians or Alaskan Natives, according to the latest data from the American Medical Association. However, these minority groups combined make up 30% of the U.S. population, according to 2009 U.S. Census Bureau figures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having a diverse physician work force is key to making health care reform, as well as eliminating health care disparities, a reality,&#8221; said Charles P. Mouton, MD, dean and senior vice president for health affairs at Meharry Medical College in Tennessee.</p>
<p>Medical schools have worked to increase diversity in the classroom for decades but with limited success, said Marc Nivet, EdD, the AAMC&rsquo;s chief diversity officer.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sometimes the efforts start earlier than college. The American Medical Association is working to increase the number of minority physicians through programs such as Doctors Back to School. Launched in 2002 by the AMA&rsquo;s Minority Affairs Consortium, the program sends minority physicians and medical students to schools to share their stories, raise awareness about the need for more minorities in medicine and serve as professional role models for children.</p>
<p><b>Overcoming barriers</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nationwide, high school dropout rates are higher among blacks and Hispanics, and fewer minorities go to college, said Lauree Thomas, MD, associate dean for student affairs and admissions at the University of Texas Medical Branch School of Medicine at Galveston. &#8220;Our educational system doesn&rsquo;t support minorities and first-generation [college] students going on to higher education. It is a tremendous uphill battle,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Minorities today have more encouragement to become tomorrow&rsquo;s physicians.</p>
<p>For example, UTMB&rsquo;s Early Medical School Acceptance Program identifies college freshmen with an interest in the field and guarantees admission if they maintain a certain grade point average, make at least a 24 on the Medical College Admission Test and attend summer science courses.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>One-year booster program</b></p>
<p>Drexel University College of Medicine in Pennsylvania admits about 25 socioeconomically disadvantaged students annually who have a four-year degree but don&rsquo;t have all of the prerequisites for medical school. The one-year program helps students get the scientific foundation they need and guarantees medical school admission upon completion.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s for students who have personality, experience, passion, drive and all the other attributes that would make them excellent physicians  &mdash;  they just don&rsquo;t have the metrics,&#8221; said Anthony Rodriguez, MD, Drexel&rsquo;s associate dean for student affairs and diversity.</p>
<p>Drexel participated in a pilot of the AAMC&rsquo;s Holistic Review Project that is getting medical schools to look beyond GPAs and MCAT scores. The goal is to ensure that schools capture a &#8220;broader picture of an applicant,&#8221; including life experiences and what they bring to their classes, Nivet said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Before it opens in 2011, Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine in Michigan will consider factors in admissions, such as a student&rsquo;s desire to practice in underserved communities and where geographically they are likely to serve.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are working on developing a focus and a framework for who we think would make a good medical student that goes way beyond test scores and grades,&#8221; said Linda Gillum, PhD, the school&rsquo;s associate dean for academic affairs, faculty development and diversity.</p>
<p>In addition to attracting more minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged students, medical schools must learn to retain those students, Dr. Mouton said. Students must feel they have mentors and peers they can relate to, and the school is committed to serving communities.</p>

<p>When I let someone cut me open or prescribe me medication, I&rsquo;m VERY interested in test scores and grades, as these are the most accurate assessment of ability.</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition to attracting more minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged students, medical schools must learn to retain those students.&#8221;</p>
<p>By passing them regardless of how incompetant they are, exactly the way our high schools have been doing for 30 years?  No thanks; I&rsquo;ll stick with that old &#8220;ability&#8221; thing again.<br>

		<p>This action will result in a fearful bias against any black and Hispanic medical personnel.  Even blacks and Hispanics don&rsquo;t want to be treated by an unqualified staff.  This is especially true of blacks and Hispanics, who want to live another week. </p>

<p>Really? Who would have guessed it?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;re-evaluate admissions policies to ensure that they graduate physicians who can serve an increasingly diverse population.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Proposals to broaden the criteria for any and every skilled and unskilled profession have been going on for years. It&rsquo;s all done to eliminate all standards.</p>
<p>The Golden Rule of Multiculturalism: There shall be no objective standards.</p>
<p>&#8216;Why should I need a college degree to be a doctor? Why should I need a high school diploma to get into college? Why can&rsquo;t I be a doctor if I get a recommendation letter from my junior high school phys-ed instructor?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I say you can have all the academic degrees they want. You can remove all the blacks from prison if they like. Just keep them in your community.<br>

		<p>The MCAT scores for whites entering medical school is 32; for entering blacks it is 14.  I respectfully disagree with Dr. Gillum.  I DO care what my doctor&rsquo;s IQ is.  If you&rsquo;re looking up from a gurney and see a black face, God help you.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Minorities make up a small proportion of medical students compared with the overall population.&#8221; Well, just add in the Asian American minority (at 5% of the population) and you get 34% of the medical students compared with 35% of the population. Diversity problem solved! </p>

		<p>The people compiling the numbers don&rsquo;t include the Asians, who now keep hospitals and medical pracitces alive, as minorities!  While highly intelligent, many, not all, Asian professionals are as far from European values and culture as Latinos or blacks. But they can do the science without lowering scores or going to &#8220;summer school&#8221;. So they are de facto whites. In other words, they are competent, even if most of them don&rsquo;t have exactly scintillating personalities or bedside manner.  The blacks don&rsquo;t have the bedside manner though, or the competence. I hope the recruited minorites are off serving minorities, but what will happen is that after a minimum period of service they will appear in the suburbs and demand admission to hospital staffs and suburban medical practices. And sue if they aren&rsquo;t admitted, qualifications be damned.</p>

<p>Hello Dr. Mouton-</p>
<p>On October 11, 2010 Carolyne Krupa quoted you in an American Medical News article. You stated: &ldquo;Having a diverse physician work force is key to making health care reform, as well as eliminating health care disparities, a reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Please explain how a diverse physician work force is key to making health care reform. What do you consider health care reform to be? What health care disparities are you claiming exist? How will health care reform eliminate those so-called disparities?</p>
<p>And finally, why do you want to give special advantages to students who have failed?</p>

		<p>This is one of the most frighting aspects of diversity.  It grants further life and death decision making authority to affirmative action recipients or incompetents &#8220;passed&#8221; through the system in the name of &#8220;equality&#8221;.  Think how this works out when the time comes where you can no longer choose your own doctors.</p>

To prove that we aren&rsquo;t racists, Whites must accept doctors from racial groups that have low cognitive skills.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter whether a doctor can tell a kidney from a lung. What counts is that we make it appear as though all races are equal. </p>

		<p>While I&rsquo;m not all that fond of discriminatory AA bias in who gets taken into medical school, I think you folks are missing the point.</p>
<p>Right now, there are a HUGE number of Indians and other minority foreign born medical students that effectively are paying off their tuition by serving their internship at inner city hospitals, dealing with the worst of the least.</p>
<p>Some actually find it quite stimulating as they get a huge variety of quite serious (drug overdose, multiple stabbings/beatings, child abuse/neglect, gunshots, hit and run, infectious diseases etc. etc.) illness&rsquo; but the point is that, without these &#8216;volunteers&rsquo;, the medical system would likely go into default because whites with enough wealth to make it through medical school &#8216;on merit&rsquo; DO NOT want to die in a crack addict&rsquo;s gunsights serving in some urban charity hospital in downtown Detroit.</p>
<p>And guess what is happening now that the American teaching curriculum is losing ground, qualitatively, and Asian societies in particular are standing up their own teaching infrastructures as replacements?  That&rsquo;s right, this free supply of dice tosser tuitioned students are choosing to learn at home where the language and attitudes are knowns.</p>
<p>So &#8216;someone has to look ahead and undersign the replacements.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Which is why this-</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Before it opens in 2011, Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine in Michigan will consider factors in admissions, such as a student&rsquo;s desire to practice in underserved communities and where geographically they are likely to serve.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Is the most important paragraph in the article.</p>
<p>You see, it&rsquo;s not whether or not white doctors are going to be serving whites, because when this genocide-for-caucasians UHC plan nosedives on a shortage of money or obvious racially driven corruption, whites will go out and buy the best private insurance they can, just like they always have.</p>
<p>And white doctors will be right there with open hands ready to take it.</p>
<p>What this story is saying is: &#8220;Look, we&rsquo;ve imported these useless, dangerous, unpleasant-to-be-around people in veritable hordes, so now we have to find -someone who looks like them- to help make this egalitarian nightmare of &#8216;equal care for everyone&rsquo; happen.</p>
<p>And so long as they are blacks serving blacks, hispanics serving hispanics, yadda de yadda yadda, then _they cannot complain_ and suggest that they are not getting the best medical care &#8216;available&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Since they are being served by members of their own race, near where they live, and if all blacks/hispanics/SWA&rsquo;sians are the mental equals of the mighty whitey, why then, to suggest a black should want to be treated by white doctors would be, you know, /racist/.</p>
<p>If you wanna be pissed, be pissed about paying for UHC.  Be pissed with whomever decided ethnic poverty should be imported for it&rsquo;s own sake.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t be mad at the medical community for doing the obvious: creating a leveraged racial quota -in training- that effectively keeps white doctors out of the inner city.  And you paying for their second Ferrari.</p>
<p>This is, in it&rsquo;s own way, just another form of legal segregation.</p>

<p>After over 50 years of tweaking our educational system to the point that it now does everything but educate anyone, they&rsquo;re telling us that these minorities still cannot make it.  This is very damning of the minorities.  I, for one, do not want dumb doctors.  I would like to think that most people do not want to see physicians who have been passed just for the sake of some medical school&rsquo;s &#8220;student retention.&#8221;  Do you want dumb lawyers, nurses, and airline pilots?  Let&rsquo;s try some AA architects, and see how quickly their buildings fall.  All this yammering about diversity is going to be the death of the USA and the rest of the Western World.</p>

		<p>This country is on a suicide mission.  How about we let each race doctored their own?  Of course, this is not going to happen, a black will purposely be assigned to treat whites.  They know full well, blacks cannot handle what it takes.  The medical field was the last area to be touched by this racial cult craziness.  The AMA and medical boards will protect these imbeciles in their butchering and mayhem.  Alot of people are going to get hurt.  Look no further than some of these MD&rsquo;s that are from India with third world training.  One recent example is Jay Patel, Sick to Death a book about this MD butcher from India that authorities kept protecting.   </p>

		<p>What Medical College Admission tests show:</p>
<p>&#8220;From the American Association of Medical Colleges, here are the 2007 MCAT scores and GPAs for both applicants and matriculants (i.e., people who were accepted and enrolled). I spent some time converting them from raw mean scores &hellip; to where each group would fall on the white percentile ranking. In other words, the mean score for whites is set to always be the 50th percentile. So, the mean score of the Mexican-American applicants on the MCAT&rsquo;s Verbal Reasoning subtest would fall at the 21st percentile of white applicants, the African-American mean would fall at the 10th percentile, and the Asian-American at the 36th percentile. (This is based on the means and the standard deviations, so it assumes normality. Your mileage may vary, but this should be close enough.)&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously, there&rsquo;s a lot of affirmative action in the med school racket: the acceptance rate (43%) for Mexican-Americans is virtually the same as for non-Hispanic Whites (44%) even though Mexican Americans average around the 26th percentile of the white distribution in MCATs and college GPA. And 36% of blacks get accepted compared to 44% of whites even though blacks scores and grades are down around the 17th percentile of the white distribution.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I can tell you one item that is heavily affected by this &#8220;Diversity&#8221; and that is record keeping.  Up to now, medical transcribing doctor&rsquo;s recorded notes, has been the way legal medical records are created and maintained.  This requires medical transcriptionists.  Non-institutional transcription companies do a great deal of the transcribing using individuals who work on site and even at home offices.  I recently heard a cd of typical transcriptions.  There were all sorts of accents, notably black African doctors of whom I could barely make out non-medical speech, let alone medical and pharmaceutical terms, and I have practiced 25 years, and in a European country, in a slavic language, Spanish, and French.  Transcribed records are legal records and MUST be accurate.  It is an impossible situation.  The bottleneck that this is creating in the daily business of health care delivery has not been accessed by anyone I have heard of, but the problem is a looming threat that could collapse the entire system.  The expense of accomodating all these doctors from all over the world into one nations system will be more than equal to the recent bank bailout, and may not end for decades.  The solution is for docs to create their own notes via medically programmed smart pads, but an entire class of employees and business with be eliminated, and transcription problems will remain because voice copy is not really good enough and programmed language is always going to be incomplete.  All this because corporations want to capture every last dollar possible from exploiting the sick and injured and our government wants to force nearly baboons into positions of responsibility and authority because it is PC.  I can imagine that the malpractice insurance crisis is going to become so pronounced that a law will likely end up creating a safe zone for incompetitents because profits will be at risk.  Meantime, the patients will just suffer and die more.</p>
<p>What an insane future we are creating.  The tax burdon I always hear conservatives moan about their children and grandchildren being saddled with (funny, I never heard so much concern for the future from conservatives otherwise), is NOTHING compared to the actual tortures they will face (and are facing via pychiatric drug proliferation).  Between that and the increased obesity of the young, NO ONE will be around to pay for anything in 20-30 years.  There will just be a bunch of third world people huddled at the governments doorstep, demanding and begging for more stuff.  But there won&rsquo;t be anyone to pay for it. If you are not 70 or over, you better prepare for a rough ride for the next 30-40 years.</p>
<p>I have read recently that the incidence of sexual misconduct among employees in hospitals has greatly increased.  Any connected, ya think?</p>

		<p><i>The one-year program helps students get the scientific foundation they need and <b>guarantees medical school admission upon completion</b> &hellip; Drexel participated in a pilot of the AAMC&rsquo;s Holistic Review Project that is getting medical schools to look beyond GPAs and MCAT scores. The goal is to ensure that schools capture a &ldquo;broader picture of an applicant,&rdquo; including life experiences and what they bring to their classes, Nivet said.</i></p>
<p>This drivel is actually less troubling than you might think.  The reality is that people admitted to med school in this way will not be able to pass the rigorous tests necessary to become board certified.  Medical schools can lower their standards, but the American Board of Medical Specialties need not follow suit.  Just make sure your physician is board certified.</p>
<p>The result is that many of these minority med school graduates will accumulate a mountain of debt but will not be able to practice medicine.  Or they will not be able to find a practice that earns enough money to repay the debt.  Earlier this summer Amren featured an article from National Jurist that reported 95% of whites pass the bar exam on their first try compared to 61% of blacks.  Law schools have been admitting less qualified minorities for years, and it is beginning to show.  It will be the same thing with board certification if affirmative action takes root in medical schools.  </p>
<p>These bleeding-heart liberals need to understand they aren&rsquo;t helping minorities who are unqualified by admitting them to med school, saddling them with debt, and then turning them out into the professional world without the ability to practice. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Medical schools have worked to increase diversity in the classroom for decades but with limited success, said Marc Nivet, EdD, the AAMC&rsquo;s chief diversity officer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Medical schools should TEACH MEDICINE&hellip;..NOT DIVERSITY.  Their ineptness and bungling to edge into social engineering has caused too many non-white incompetents to enter the field.</p>
<p>Of the blacks FORCED through pharmacy school, I&rsquo;m already hearing ACCURATE reports of mislabelled prescriptions, prescriptions filled with the wrong drug, etc., Example, my sister received a prescription mouthwash for her son, which was labelled &#8220;Gargle and swallow.&#8221;  Checking the internet on the mouthwash it stipulated very clearly:  &#8220;Warning, do not swallow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Presented with the obvious error, the black declared it was a typographical error.  How utterly dumb to claim a wrong key or two was hit creating an entire sentence that was in error.</p>
<p>My recent experiences:  An antibiotic script for the flu, which contained 2 refills was filled and indicated as having 1 refill by another female black pharmacist.  </p>
<p>Both worked at different Walgreen locations. I&rsquo;ve not heard anything similar about other pharmacies, so I&rsquo;m concluding it is only that chain store that is hiring unqualified blacks.</p>
<p>The professors who passed these people should be tried in criminal court for foisting them on the suspecting public.</p>
<p>We will have serious errors from the black AA doctors also, and, like the pharmacists, they&rsquo;re going to kill people with their incompetence.  </p>
<p>I advised my sister to get a lawyer.  She is doing just that.  I would advise everyone to save everything they get that might provide evidence of black professional incompetence, because, with this healthcare bill, there will be a flood of non-white professionals in the medical field. </p>

		<p>I am a physician (Internal Medicine) and have been in practice since the late 1980s. This diversity idea is insane. First, it is not fair to the many hard-working, intelligent (white) students who will be rejected so a barely qualified, and probably unqualified, black student gets preference for a spot in the class. What happened to the best and the brightest? Now it&rsquo;s the black and the blacker.</p>
<p>The vague and subjective &#8220;life experience&#8221; and &#8220;personality&#8221; qualities the admissions committees claim they are looking for is just a cover for skin color. The Obamacare law also has strict regulations pushing and actually mandating the enrollment of blacks in medical schools - brains and ability be damned.</p>
<p>This nation has become Obama in Wonderland. Medicine will be dumbed down to the point where you dare not get sick. If the health care bill is not repealed then by 2020, in my estimation, the government will require all physicians to accept Medicare/Medicaid or whatever health care plan the Feds offer as a requirement for licensure. </p>
<p>Then patients will be assigned a preferred primary care doctor. Going outside the system for basic care will be nearly impossible. You might soon hear something like, &#8220;Hello, I be Doctah Shaniqua. I beez yo&rsquo; new doctah.&#8221;  </p>
<p>The article states, &#8220;UTMB&rsquo;s Early Medical School Acceptance Program identifies college freshmen with an interest in the field and guarantees admission if they maintain a certain grade point average, make at least a 24 on the Medical College Admission Test and attend summer science courses.&#8221; </p>
<p>First, what exactly is a &#8220;certain&#8221; grade point average? </p>
<p>Next, getting a 24 on the MCAT (scores run from 15 to a high of 45) will not get you anywhere near a medical school. Essentially, a 24 means certain rejection - unless your skin tone is not white. The average medical school applicant scores close to 28. Nearly all medical schools in the US accept students only with an MCAT of 30 or better.</p>
<p>Do you want a doctor who HAD to go summer school for remedial work? </p>
<p>Medicine is destroying itself for the false notion of diversity.</p>
<p>This is a high crime to society and proof of a nation actually going backwards and regressing. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Our educational system doesn&rsquo;t support minorities and first-generation [college] students going on to higher education. It is a tremendous uphill battle,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p><br>
Our educational system bends over backwards to give everybody   &mdash;   whites and minorities alike   &mdash;   about as fair and equal a shot at succeeding in life as any educational system could possibly be expected to do. So if minorities STILL find the world of higher ed like med school to be &#8220;a tremendous uphill battle,&rdquo; then maybe the thing the minorities are fighting their uphill battle against isn&rsquo;t some imaginary White Skin Privilege, it&rsquo;s their own intellectual inadequacies. Maybe the problem (if that&rsquo;s really the word) of not enough minorities in elite medical jobs   &mdash;   and in most other elite, big-brain, high-status occupations as well   &mdash;   is that most minorities <i>simply aren&rsquo;t smart enough</i>. </p>

		<p>In Tennessee, in 1988, there was a statewide program of encouraging minoritiy students to get into the medical sciences.  Student just had to have a 2.0, and be a minority.  Student was then placed into a special summer program where they got free room, board, and $800.00 per summmer session to be in the pre-med program.  Wallah.  </p>
<p>That was over twenty years ago.  UT also had special studies classes only for minority students at the law school in knoxville.  Non-special students, found out about this in a regular class one day, after the professor was discussing Civil Procedure II.  A black student said, &#8220;that&rsquo;s not what you said in the class&#8221;.  What class many wondered?  It came out right there in the CPII class that UT had special classes to give the black students not only the test questions, but the answers as well.  Just could not download the concepts many could only guess.</p>
<p>One year ealier, in 1987, the BLSA, the racist Black Law Sudents Association, protested the university, with cameras from the local media broadcasting the accusations, that there were not enough black students on the Tennessee Law Review.  </p>
<p>This affirmative action, which is modern day Jim Crow, has been going on for decades with no results except growing an entitlement mentality, and with no positvie overall results.</p>
<p>While your sons and daughters are in the library working their asses off, many others will protest or lobby, instead of study, for their spots, and get them.</p>
<p>Unfortunatley, no special grade or accolade exemptiom will be available to anyone, including minorities, while on the operating table. </p>

		<p>it would be a good idea to single out economically disadvantaged but unusually bright students of all races and to encourage and foster their development.</p>
<p>but once - after all the fostering an encouragement - they have scored low on the MCAT, they should be excluded from medical school.</p>
<p>the article implies that these minority medical students are intellectually superior but came from inferior school systems, had chaotic home lives, et cetera.</p>
<p>but how many affirmative-action medical students actually come from disadvantaged backgrounds - as opposed to privileged ones?</p>
<p>this program is based on two gigantic LIES:</p>
<p>it pretends that minority medical students come from disadvantaged backgrounds in any significant numbers (prove it!!).</p>
<p>it pretends that once you have done badly on the MCAT, remedial help can catch you up in time to graduate medical school as a first-rate doctor.</p>
<p>the elephant in the room is low black and Hispanic IQ:</p>
<p>first-rate doctor has an IQ of of 120 plus, circa 1% of blacks in America.</p>
<p>blacks are not underrepresented as a proportion of American physicians.</p>

My husband was admitted to the hospital several years ago for a gallstone that passed.  We soon discovered the majority of the patients in the hospital were on Medicaid.  My husband was one of the few who had health insurance.  The hospital quickly scheduled him for gallstone surgery without thorough testing.  They saw $$$$.  The surgeon who was to perform the surgery, was from Nigeria.  My husband walked out of that hospital and got an appointment with a white gastroenterologist.  After several tests, this white doctor told my husband he did the right thing walking out of that hospital. </p>

		<p>What absolute garbage!  Blacks all ready have to achieve less of a score on the Medical College Aptitude Test (MCAT) than whites.  Last time I checked, the required MCAT composite score for whites was 28, and for our endlessly abused and oppressed blacks, 21. After having a bad experience with a black doctor at the Department of Veterans Affairs,and some fussing, I got a doctor who is from the Middle East. But who cares, he is very competent and caring, and has all ready identified some things that the other doctor had missed. I will never trust a black doctor again.</p>

		<p>One problem I see with this plan is the new institution of hospitalists, docs that oversee at least part of a patient&rsquo;s care in the hospital.  My very elderly aunt, who lives in a semi-rural area, broke her hip and was admitted to a medium-sized facility.  After very successful surgery, she told me that the hospitalist, an African, had told her pre-op that she would likely die due to her advanced age.  Luckily, the orthopedic surgeon told her the opposite.  As I left the day of that visit, I noticed a poster with photos and bios of all the hospitalists on staff.  None were Anglos, all were foreign-born, and only one had attended an American university.  </p>

		<p><i>&#8220;I am not kidding, the last five or six advertisements for health care plans and hospitals I saw had a prominent black doctor in the middle of the people presented with all the others standing behind him.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>In the mid 90&rsquo;s, I worked in a serials department of a university medical library.</p>
<p>One day, I had to catalog a cart of graduate school catalogers. Of the appoximately 100 catalogs which had photos of people on the cover, not one showed a photo of a white male. They were black female, black male, hispanic, asian, middle eastern, but no whites.</p>

		<p>Michael Jackson was &#8220;treated&#8221; by one of these Affirmative Action donkeys, and look where it put him; in an early grave. </p>
<p>If Doctors and Dentists need &#8220;Diversity&#8221; in their Medical Offices, let them hire another Black Receptionist, who will never get any information correct, anyway, or another Mexican Janitor. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want a non-White Doctor, or Dentist, and will not go to a non-White Doctor, or Dentist. That may beez raciss, but it beez my body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how test scores don&rsquo;t seem to be of any improtance to these Medical Schools, much the same way that the Naval Academy is bending over backwards to attract and maintain their share of Blacks, etc.. I look forward to many Navy Ships being run aground, due to this idiotic policy. </p>
<p>Who among us wants a Doctor to treat them, who barely could read the Medical texts in School? That would be like hiring a Lawyer that finally got pushed through on the Bar exam. </p>
<p>We are loaded with third rate Lawyers; many of whom work as Public Defenders. Their clients normally get the Orange Jump Suit, whether they are guilty or not.</p>

		<p>I just had a brillant idea. Let&rsquo;s have all these new graduates of these Diversity programs of these Medical Schools, be assigned to treat all the Members of Congress, and their families, as well as serve on all the Military bases, here, and overseas. </p>
<p>We can also make sure that these Diversity devils get to Medically treat the Goverors of all 50 States, and all State Legislatures, as well as our County, City, and Town Supervisors, Executives, and Mayors, and all of their families. </p>
<p>If Diversity is what these creatures want, then let them step up to the plate, and use the services of these less qualified Medical personnel, that they would quickly push on us.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how long that would last, and how great &#8220;Diversity&#8221; would be, when it&rsquo;s their own health, and the health of their families, on the line.</p>

		<p>A friend of mine works as a medical transcriptionist.  She listens to tapes of doctors all day and transcribes them.  Her job has gotten much more difficult in recent years since almost every doctor now either has a foreign accent or a heavy black accent.  She transcribed one tape from a black doctor where he talked about making an incision in a patient.  He said, &#8220;I made a cut wif da knife.&#8221;  Now, who would want HIM operating on them?

		<p>In my 1st year class of pharmacy school we had 125 students of whom 12 were black (2 Nigerians).  Despite every effort from the administration (free tutoring and &#8220;mentoring&#8221;, remedial work, teacher conferences, etc.) six of the twelve failed the first year as well as six of the 100+ whites.  Five of the original 12 managed to graduate, though not all in 4 years, and only one was really on par with his classmates.<br>
Our third year was no longer traditional lecture format like the first two and we were split into smaller groups of eight students and then reshuffled for each of four segments.  It was supposed to be random, but I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice that the strongest students always had a black in their group and that the all white groups were mostly average students (average doctoral candidate students that is).  Anything to get them through despite their glaring deficiencies.<br>
I would never trust any aspect of my health care to a black as they were probably &#8220;facilitated&#8221; through school and simply have a license but lack understanding.</p>

		<p>So I guess when a high school student with a 3rd grade reading level tells me he wants to be a &#8216;pediatrician&rsquo; I should &#8216;respect his dream&rsquo; as qualifications for a medical degree (if one is non-White/Asian)  depend on  &#8220;personality, experience, passion, drive and all the other attributes that make excellent physicians.&#8221;</p>
<p>And from Anon #41:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Our educational system bends over backwards to give everybody  &mdash;  whites and minorities alike  &mdash;  about as fair and equal a shot at succeeding in life as any educational system could possibly be expected to do&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>O, how I wish this were true! (but it isn&rsquo;t).</p>
<p>Your statement should read:  &#8220;Our educational system bends over backwards to give non-Whites, at the expense of Whites, a fair and equal a shot in life&hellip;..&#8221;</p>
<p>White students continue to be denied admission to universities in favor of lower scoring non-White/Asian students.  It is not only not fair it is obscene.</p>
<p>And that this unfairness is openly practiced against Whites is not in dispute.</p>

<p>We talk about things like this subject; it spreads among whites like news of the underground railroad during the War Between the States, and we learn very quickly which doctors offices [not] to use. Ditto for dentists. Without any reminders our primary care group knows to refer my family to white American doctors.</p>

At that point an announcer interrupts and says, &#8220;I guess your going to die then&#8221;.  The announcer then goes on about discrimination, racism, blah blah blah.  </p>

		<p>Hmm! I thought that you had two very serious crimes in America, 1, getting caught for not paying your taxes and 2, Practising medicine without a license. Looks like Mr BHO has solved both of these problems. Don&rsquo;t worry about taxes, print money instead and issue medical qualifications to all comers! (As long as they are diverse)</p>
<p>And more seriously, we have similar problems here with an influx of 3rd world Drs. Not only can you not understand their poor English, you simply can not relate to them. It is all so totally wrong. Good to see so many postings on this issue, it is a very serious matter.</p>

 Learned my lesson on that one.</p>

		<p>My sister had a bad accident when her horse reared unexpectedly and her fingers got twisted and broken by the reins. An Indian doctor at the local clinc set them so they looked totally crooked and mangled and said that was all that could be done. Not satisfied with that, she went to the hospital where a White doctor fixed them correctly and cursed the quack who set it earlier. Moral of the story: insist on seeing a White doctor.</p>

		<p>I had to take my wife to the medical center once.  While in the waiting room, we saw something amazing.  An old white lady was asking her Indian female doctor a question about her medication, and the &#8220;doctor&#8221; was clearly annoyed and impatient with this slow old lady.</p>
<p>She turned her back on the old lady, and then when the old lady was persistent, this &#8220;doctor&#8221; yelled at the old lady saying, and I will never forget this, &#8220;Stop wasting my time!  You go now!&#8221;</p>
<p>The old white lady looked shocked and turned slowly and walked away.  I saw that female Indian doctor for about 20 minutes after that, wandering in and out of the waiting area, barking orders like a Hindu princess to the nurses and other orderlies.  She was really full of herself.</p>
<p>I was once assigned a Chinese man as my doctor through my HMO.  My God!  Not only was he incoherent when he spoke, when you told him your symptoms, he seemed to be not listening, would not tell you anything, and would just write a prescription for the same antibiotic every time, regardless.  </p>
<p>After three visits in about 2 years, I changed my doc to the only black guy there, and he was excellent.  Too bad he was canned a year later by the HMO for spending too much time with each patient.  Go figure.</p>
