			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Hugo Lopez, Pew Hispanic Center, October 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In a year when support for Democratic candidates has eroded, the party&rsquo;s standing among one key voting group  &mdash;  Latinos-appears as strong as ever. Two-thirds (65%) of Latino registered voters say they plan to support the Democratic candidate in their local congressional district, while just 22% support the Republican candidate, according to a nationwide survey of Latinos.</p>
<p>If this pro-Democratic margin holds up on Election Day next month, it would be about as wide as in 2008, when Latinos supported Barack Obama for president over John McCain by 67% to 31%.</p>
<p>However, Hispanic registered voters appear to be less motivated than other voters to go to the polls. Just one-third (32%) of all Latino registered voters say they have given this year&rsquo;s election &#8220;quite a lot&#8221; of thought. In contrast, half (50%) of all registered voters say the same. And when it comes to their intent to vote, half (51%) of Latino registered voters say they are absolutely certain they will vote in this year&rsquo;s midterm election, while seven-in-ten (70%) of all registered voters say the same.</p>
<p>The survey finds that among Latino registered voters, Republicans may be more likely to turn out and vote than Democrats. Some 44% of Latino Republicans say they have given the election quite a lot of thought compared with 28% of Latino Democrats. This partisan gap is consistent with survey findings of the full population of registered voters.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In recent elections, Latinos have also represented a growing share of the electorate. According to a Pew Hispanic Center analysis of Census Bureau data, in 2008 Latino voters were 7.4% of all voters nationwide, up from 6% in 2004.</p>
<p>When it comes to opinions of President Barack Obama, a greater share of Latino registered voters approve of his job performance than do all U.S. registered voters  &mdash;  63% versus 47%.</p>
<p>Yet when asked about the effect of his administration&rsquo;s policies on Hispanics, Latino registered voters are divided. More than half (51%) say his policies have had no effect on Latinos, while one-in-four (26%) say they have been helpful to Latinos and 13% say they have been harmful.</p>
<p>The new survey also reveals that the Democratic Party continues to hold a large advantage in party identification among Latino registered voters. More than six-in-ten (62%) Latino registered voters say they identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party, while one-quarter (25%) say the same for the Republican Party  &mdash;  a Democratic advantage of 37 percentage points.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>The Immigration Issue</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip}Nearly six-in-ten (58%) Latino registered voters who have discussed the immigration debate say they are absolutely certain they will vote in November, compared with just four-in-ten (39%) of those who have not talked about the immigration debate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among the report&rsquo;s other findings:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>* Fewer than four-in-ten (38%) of Latino registered voters who are Spanish dominant say they are absolutely certain to vote this year. This is lower than any other demographic group of Latino registered voters.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Strong support for Democrats; fewer likely to vote.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
Fewer Hispanics to vote, but those who will are strongly for Democrats.</p>
<p>Gosh, what an absolute surprise.</p>
<p>After just reading the MSM print media and wartching the left wing cable news networks, I thought most of the Hispanics in this country wanted to assimilate and be a part of American culture.  I mean, when they weren&rsquo;t flying flags from their failed countries and declaring whites racist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering if this news isn&rsquo;t based in some right wing plot designed to fool everybody.</p>

		<p>If we enforced voter ID laws, the number of hispanic votes going to the democrats would be cut by more than half.</p>
<p>The article makes it sound as if legitimate hispanic voters are a key voting block for the dems.  The truth is quite different. It&rsquo;s illegal voting that makes this a voting block that matters.</p>
<p>The republicans should not court the hispanic vote.  Instead, their strategy should be to cut off these illegal votes through voter ID laws.  THAT is a strategy that will win elections.</p>

		<p>Not at all surprised that few Hispanics are expected to vote in the upcoming midterm elections. I live in an area with quite a few hispanic folks, and they, along with East Asians, are typically VERY non-politically motivated. Someone (I think it may have been Steve Sailer) noted that these two groups tend to vote far less than their percentages in the overall population, in large part because East Asians find politics a distraction and Hispanics find politics uninteresting.</p>

		<p>There is only one sure-fire method for increasing the Latino vote: ramp up resentment of whites.<br>
It is only in my last few race-aware years that I have come to understand that the &#8216;Communist&rsquo; movements in South America were largely driven by anti-white rhetoric. How could it not happen in America?<br>
Oh yeah. You&rsquo;ve got a Constitution and cultural values that protect against that sort of thing. Silly me.</p>

		<p>I wonder how many Mexican illegals and Mexican-Americans thought Obama would give aliens amnesty.  Now, that the messiah didn&rsquo;t deliver, there&rsquo;s probably much less interest.<br>
The GOP should run a Latino VP candidate next time  &mdash;  some white person like Cuban-American Mario Rubio.  The Dems wouldn&rsquo;t dare run a black Prez with another non-Anglo, and the Repubs would own the Hispanic vote.</p>

		<p>I think the real story for race-realis whites is: <br>
We have almost no candidates who even remotely support us, and the idea of voting for republicans is repulsive and lame. Here in Colorad- save for Tom Tancredo, I see NO ONE on the R-side who even touches immigration in their flyers or stumps. That says it all. <br>
I want the Obamaites thrown out, but do I want McCains to take their place?<br>
I can hardly believe it, but even after two vomitous years under a black socialist, I still want to SPANK the RINOs hard. I want them to know, as they hate me, I despise them, and they will NOT get a cushy life of perks while blowing their horn on my behalf.<br>
Let the system rot.</p>

		<p>I hate to sound cruel but in my debates with people over illegal immigration issues like Arizona&rsquo;s SB 1070, a constant refrain from liberals is that the GOP is digging its own grave by alienating Hispanic voters. When I reply that Hispanics don&rsquo;t vote and back it up with stats that prove it, this always seems to demoralize them, followed by the response that <i>this time</i> around is the time when Hispanics are finally going to vote. </p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>On a somewhat more serious note, what can you say about a racial/ethnic group that has a great deal of self-awareness as a distinct identity group with its own particular set of interests, yet which refuses to get up off the couch and go vote? For some reason it reminds me of how growing up and going to school with Hispanics there was almost a kind of pathological hostility towards education and doing well in school, and a constant running down of fellow Hispanic kids who did try. A culture that seems to value being second rate. </p>
