<h1>Obama Wants $1.25 B to Compensate up to 66,000 African American Farmers for USDA Discrimination in 1981-96; Census Says African American Farmers Peaked at 33,000 in Those Years</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nicholas Ballasy, Cybercast News Service, October 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Barack Obama is requesting $1.15 billion from Congress  &mdash;  to add to a $100-million earmark he pushed through Congress in 2008 when he was a senator  &mdash;  to create a $1.25 billion federal fund to settle discrimination claims by what the Justice Department says is 66,000 African Americans who &#8220;farmed or attempted to farm&#8221; and were allegedly the victims of discrimination committed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) during the period from Jan. 1, 1981 to Dec. 31, 1996.</p>
<p>During that 16-year period, however, the number of African American farm operators in the United States peaked at 33,000 in 1982, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. By 1992, says the Census Bureau, the number of African American farmers had fallen as low as 19,000. (There were 2.24 million total farmers in the United States in 1982 and 1.93 million in 1992.)</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A Department of Justice spokeswoman told CNSNews.com that the $1.15 billion the administration is requesting from Congress to settle what is called the Pigford II case is based on complaints of discrimination from 66,000 individual African American farmers who allege the Department of Agriculture wrongfully denied them federal farm loans or benefits between the beginning of 1981 and the end of 1996.</p>
<p>Back in 1997, lawyers brought a class-action suit, Pigford v. Glickman, against the USDA on behalf of African American farmers who allegedly were discriminated against because of their race when they tried to secure federally-backed farm loans or benefit payments.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ultimately, a Justice Department spokeswoman told CNSNews.com, a total of 66,000 individual African American farmers came forward after the original 1999 Pigford deadline seeking to make a claim against the USDA for discriminating against them on the basis of race in the period of 1981 through 1996.</p>
<p>Counting the original 20,000 who met the 1999 deadline and the 66,000 who did not, there are a total of 86,000 African Americans who &#8220;farmed or attempted to farm&#8221; from 1981 through 1996 made a claim of discrimination or are seeking to make one against the U.S. government.</p>
<p>Yet, the alleged discrimination against these 86,000 African American farmers occurred during a period when the peak African American farm-operator population was 33,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>CNSNews.com asked the Department of Justice what process it went through to verify the claims of the 66,000 individuals deemed eligible to file for compensation under the Pigford II settlement. A department spokesperson said these individuals in fact have not yet submitted their claims under Pigford II.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once the funds are appropriated by Congress and the settlement is approved, the $1.25 billion will be distributed among those members of the 66,000 eligible claimants whom a third-party neutral claims administrator determines to be eligible for funds, in an effort to keep the process fair and void of politics,&#8221; said the spokesperson.</p>
<p>When asked why there are 66,000 eligible claimants  &mdash;  while the Census Bureau says the number of African American farmers in the United States peaked at 33,000 during the period in question  &mdash;  a Justice Department spokesperson said since the alleged discrimination took place over a 16-year period when different individuals were moving in and out of farming that using a single year, such as 1982, as a reference point &#8220;doesn&rsquo;t work.&#8221;</p>

		<p>More money grabs.</p>
<p>So it seems any black man who decided to label himself a &#8216;farmer&rsquo; for a few months gets to share in this bonanza.  Regardless of whether he stuck with it or not, he&rsquo;s now a plaintiff.</p>
<p>And is the implication that the USDA actively discriminated against ALL black &#8216;farmers&rsquo; during the 1980s?</p>
<p>I find it hard to believe that every single solitary black farmer was discriminated against - in the 1980s?  The government was &#8216;enlightened&rsquo; by then.  It&rsquo;s not like 25 years ago was Jim Crow!</p>
<p>Ahhh, just more &#8216;redistributing&rsquo; the wealth, as Obama said.</p>

		<p>What precious little political experience Obama obtained prior to his election as president was received courtesy of Chicago&rsquo;s corrupt political machine.  This is how they do business.  It&rsquo;s called a shakedown.  The $13.5 Trillion national debt is someone else&rsquo;s problem.  Obama is playing with house money.</p>

		<p>I will wager there were no more than 100 black &#8220;farmers&#8221;&hellip;I will also wager they were NEVER discriminated against, either. Furthermore I will wager there were many Whites who didn&rsquo;t get loans, either. </p>
<p>Blacks didn&rsquo;t get loans because they were not trustworthy just as they aren&rsquo;t today. Just another scam to get Whitey&rsquo;s money.</p>

		<p>I am pretty sure that we still don&rsquo;t have a legal definition of &#8220;Black&#8221; in America. That being the case, I am pretty sure that I am one of those Black farmers who were victims of discrimination. </p>
<p>I am going to see about that, and I think others should do the same. A government that will send stimulus checks to convicts and dead people will send a check to anybody.</p>

		<p>In the original proceedings it was agreed by all parties that there was no more than between 1000 to 4000 possible litigants, even if this nonsense was a legitimate grievance.  Now the latest number of individual filings has exceeded 94,000.  As noted in the story, all of existing black farmers, as admitted by the government&rsquo;s own statistics only reach a high of 33,000.</p>
<p>Of course as we are well aware, there is no more common sense or justice in America.  Now is it evident what the end game of open borders, an Eric Holder Justice Department, the radicalization of teachers, librarians and other &#8220;social workers&#8221;, the corruption of our clergy, the mind numbing Hollywood productions, the globalization of power, and on and on and on?  Well, I know this is a choir that we preach to here but I still hold out that I am having a nightmare from whence I will awaken, still in my old America but now with a wonderful plot line that even Arthur Clarke would be proud of.</p>

<p>1) How many Whites were also turned down?</p>
<p>2) Given the fact that ANY federal handout would require a form/application to be filled out, just how did the gov&rsquo;t know which applicant was of what race?  Hand writing analysis?</p>

		<p>And of course, the USDA numbers for -actual- black farmers is different from the &#8216;single operator&rsquo; Census count by over a third.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
During that 16-year period, however, the number of African American farm operators in the United States peaked at 33,000 in 1982, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. By 1992, says the Census Bureau, the number of African American farmers had fallen as low as 19,000. (There were 2.24 million total farmers in the United States in 1982 and 1.93 million in 1992.)<br>

<p>&gt;<br>
At least one source who is extremely familiar with the issue and who asked to remain anonymous because of potential retribution, says there are a number of legitimate cases who have long been denied their payments and will benefit from the additional funding. But many more appear to have been solicited in an attempt to &ldquo;game&rdquo; the Pigford system. For example, our<br>
www.Agri-Pulse.com source said a large number of late filers had similar zip codes in large Ohio cities, suggesting a<br>
door to door effort might have taken place to find likely candidates.<br>

<p>Disagree with the USDA-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
The authors noted that &#8220;establishing direct comparisons<br>
between the 1997 Census of Agriculture numbers and those<br>
from earlier years is problematic due to a change in the<br>
enumeration technique. In 1997, for the first time, the USDA<br>
conducted the count rather than the Census Bureau and found<br>
26,785 Black farmers rather than 18,451 identified by the U.S.<br>
Census. &ldquo;The farm numbers appear to be more accurate than<br>
they have been previously. Thus, while the numbers are more<br>
accurate, we cannot determine if the rate of decline has<br>
improved. ***The Census only identified one operator per farm.***&rdquo;<br>
&gt;</p>

<p>So what it looks like to me is you have people who are not and likely -were not- farmers, now claiming to have worked on X location (often in a different state) in the time period &#8216;81-&#8216;96 looking to get rich on anywhere from 50,000 to 625,000 dollar payouts as well as 12,500 dollars in tax credits and debt forgiveness.</p>
<p>Something which legitimate black farmers have been mad about because the USG was playing fast and loose with the payment scheduling, looking at mortality tables on some elderly people (the black farmers association ended up filing a 20.4 billion class action at one point and their lawyer wanted 2.5 billion for the settlement but said half his clients would be dead if he pushed).</p>
<p>At which point, you have to ask: is the USDA liable for a &#8216;bought the farm&rsquo; total loss or only the value of the loan?  Because the black farm losses in the period were enormous compared to the white equivalents, especially in the poorer south.</p>
<p>And there is a legitimate case that as the USDA has forced crop norms on the farmers of America, they have also legislated debt financing as the requirement to also buy specialist equipment for these &#8216;play the game or get out&rsquo; crops which farmers on their own would never have persisted in or picked up to begin with.</p>
<p>Yet white farmers were able to stay up with that process of change.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where to stand on this.  I think there was a miscarriage of justice but I don&rsquo;t believe it has a thing to do with &#8216;being raciss&rsquo;.  And I think, if it is true, the benefits should apply equally to whites who were held over the same barrel and lost -their- farms.  There were a lot more of them.</p>

		<p>I think Old White Jim has a good idea.  Every white person, urban dweller or not, should apply for this giveaway as a &#8220;Black&#8221;.  In fact, we should list ourselves as Black on any form where race is required.  Just think what this would do to Census figures.  Think what this would do to election figures.  Think what this would do to every AA effort in the country!</p>
<p>If people can claim to be black when they&rsquo;re only half black, or one quarter black, why not just a little bit black?  Are you absolutely, positively, sure there&rsquo;s not even one drop of black blood in your line?  Even if you are, can you prove it beyond all doubt?  Or, can anyone absolutely prove there is none?  Shouldn&rsquo;t we all be eligible for those benefits reserved only for blacks?</p>
<p>Perhaps we could destroy this whole AA plot by simply claiming membership in the favored race.<br>

		<p>According to the predominate view of most liberal intellectuals in this country that I encountered in endless graduate seminars in english literature, most of the whites in this country are hypocrites for two major reasons (among others, of course):  the &#8220;fact&#8221; that nearly all whites in this country have at least a drop of black blood coursing through their veins, and the &#8220;fact&#8221; that &#8220;blacks&#8221; were suppressed, oppressed, and forced into slavery even if they had only one drop of white blood coursing through their veins.  I vote we go back to the &#8220;one drop&#8221; rule  &mdash;  by that definition, nearly all whites in the country are eligible for all of these affirmative action giveaways by the state.  On a different note  &mdash;  notice that these &#8220;loans&#8221; have suddenly metastasized into payments from the government.  Originally, they were (nominally at least) supposed to be paid back.  Not any more  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s money &#8220;owed&#8221; the poor helpless blacks who were cheated by the International Anglo Capitalist Conspiracy.</p>

		<p>Funny how blacks are claiming they were farmers and they were discrimininated against. Where is their proof?  oh, wait.  never mind.  I forgot, blacks don&rsquo;t need to prove a case or accusation against someone, especially if they&rsquo;re white.  All they have to do is say &#8220;racist&#8221; and a white person goes to jail or owes them money.  End of story.  period.  No argument.</p>
<p>As another person said, most blacks that scream racism aren&rsquo;t really the victims they want everyone to feel sorry for.   They make up these lies for sympathy and money, exactly what Booker T. Washington said abut blacks in 1901.</p>
