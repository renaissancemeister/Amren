<h1>Feds: Hotel Discriminated Against Black Employees</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WRTV-TV (Indianapolis), September 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on Thursday filed a lawsuit against an Indianapolis Hampton Inn hotel, alleging that the business discriminated against black housekeeping employees.</p>
<p>According to the complaint, the general manager of the Hampton Inn at 2311 N. Shadeland Ave., told employees that she wanted Mexican workers instead of blacks because they would clean better and complain less.</p>
<p>EEOC claims that the hotel paid black employees less and fired black housekeepers who complained. The suit also charges that the hotel destroyed employment records going back at least two years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The EEOC said it wants compensatory and punitive damages, along with back pay for the employees. It also seeks a permanent injunction to bar the hotel from perpetuating racial discrimination or retaliation, the same practices the agency alleged took place.</p>

		<p>A private employer should be allowed to hire and fire as per his own internal policies without interference from the state unless health and safety are endangered.  The only intereference that should be permitted is when the employer enters into a contract with the employee, either individually or through collective bargaining.  There should be no EEOC nor any mandates as regards race, sex or ethnicity.  Most employers, in order to be efficient, will hire employees that work up to the standards needed regardless of race, sex or ethnicity in order to get the job done most efficiently.</p>

		<p>Mexicans are only half as violent, slightly more intelligent, and they do not (yet) regard actually working as &#8220;acting white&#8221;.<br>
What employer in his right mind would NOT prefer them ?<br>
Of course there are problems, chief among them that the blacks won´t just go away; in other words, it´s a classical case of &#8220;socializing the cost&#8221;.</p>
<p>- I cannot say I have a solution.</p>

		<p>Granted, this supervisor should&rsquo;nt have made that remark, but the reality is that blacks are the laziest race on the face of the earth!  I worked for years in the construction industry and watched how blacks were pushed out due to their poor attendance records, lack of a work ethic with an accompanying lack of pride in their craftsmanship, and their general bad attitudes and sense of entitlement.  I only saw ONE lazy Mexican worker who eventually was fired by an electrical contractor I worked for at one point, but the lazy, worthless black workers were too numerous to count.  Now I see a repeat of those problems at the public college I attend.  The Asians, Middle Easterners, and the whites here generally work hard, while too many of the black students who don&rsquo;t realize that education is a privelege, not a right, could care less.</p>

		<p>Why don&rsquo;t they hire WHITES? </p>
<p>Everywhere I go it is Mexicans or blacks that work in these hotels/motels! The same is true for these fast food dives and restaurants.  Neither group is &#8220;clean&#8221;. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to stay/eat where either group are employees. </p>
<p>The reason mexicans do not &#8220;complain&#8221; is because most are illegals! Blacks complain all the time, no matter what and I am sure they are caught stealing, taking/selling drugs on the job, and being just plain lazy. </p>

<p>Soon welfare will be the only source of income for most blacks. Social service jobs are now being given to those with bi-lingual skills.</p>

		<p>funny that after so many suits brought by blacks and their enablers, companies still have not learned the lessons when it comes to dealing with their black employees. To protect your company from the likes of jesse and al, you must document document document! every incident, every missed day, every groping of a white female employee, every theft. #2, you must be brutally honest in your evaluation of your black employees, no more PC performance reviews,  you must explain that the reason they are not getting a raise/promotion is because they do not meet the standards set by other employees, saying their performance is lacking is not enough, you have to detail their failings, and you must have 3 other HR staff in attendance to pile on the evidence and to support the decisions. lastly, companies must fire black employees as soon as it is clear they are not suitable, it is hard to defend the firing of a black employee who has been doing the same job for the last 10 years.<br>
time to put an end to the black lottery</p>

		<p>Well, however one feels about Hispanic immigration, legal and illegal, there&rsquo;s no question that there&rsquo;s a broad concensus by employers that Hispanics work harder and complain less than blacks, and in fact that they&rsquo;re better employees in every respect. That&rsquo;s simply a fact, however much blacks might want to challenge it in court.</p>
<p>Every employer in America who employs entry level types, be they hoteliers, farmers, landscape architects, airline baggage handlers, individuals with domestic help, or any others will confirm that they&rsquo;d prefer Hispanics in general to blacks.</p>

		<p>Where I&rsquo;m at, it&rsquo;s unbelievable how many latinos are working everywhere in every business where manual labor is required.  </p>
<p>At the same time, except for gov&rsquo;t jobs and the occassional cashier, I just don&rsquo;t see any black workers anywhere, and there is a huge black population here.</p>
<p>Any blacks I have seen working are #1 usually female, #2 not working with concentration or interest and #3 loud and rude.  (I could tell you stories but I&rsquo;m sure many of you could tell more.)</p>
<p>Immigration is the WORST thing for blacks and their chance to improve, yet they say next to nothing as they are pushed out and marginalized everywhere.  Amazing, isn&rsquo;t it?  </p>

		<p>I wonder if the general manager has some kind of beef with the owner or was planning to move on to another job, and this stunt is designed to &#8216;uplift&rsquo; downtrodden african americans or cause the owners to lose a bit of money.</p>

		<p>Anyone familiar with the Indianapolis area will recognize that the address is not in a great part of town. It is on the East side of Indianapolis and is a little better off than Gary, Indiana. Yes, there are some whites in that part of town, but they tend to be retirees who were too poor or too late to bail out of there. Fifty years ago, Shadeland Avenue was a much better place to live and work. However, a lot of those factory jobs are long gone to places like Mexico. </p>
<p>If I were running a service business, and 90+% of my applicants were either black or Mexican, I would take the Mexicans first. They can learn English, for the most part, they have a work ethic already. In high school, I flipped burgers and this was before we were flooded by illegals. Even then, I was appalled at the laziness of most of the blacks who worked there. One of the managers was a black man who grew up in poverty and this position was a stepping stone to better things. However, the lazy blacks regarded this guy as worse than Simon Legree. As far as I was concerned, this manager was superior to the white managers. </p>
<p>Years ago, I had an immigration officer tell me that a lot of the Mexican gang bangers hold regular employment during the day and deal drugs or do whatever after hours and off season. </p>

		<p>I complain about illegal aliens on this site just about every day, but I have to admit that the hotel manager&rsquo;s assessment of Black employee performance versus Latino employee is completely accurate.</p>
<p>Five or six years ago I moved from Macon, GA to the Ft. Worth area of Texas. In Macon nearly everybody you dealt with in fast food joints and stores were Black. Their counterparts in Texas were nearly all Mexicans.</p>
<p>If you went to a Wal-mart in Macon there was a good chance that you would see customers abandon their carts and leave empty-handed after waiting 30 minutes for the ONE smart employee to come out and fix whatever it was that the Black cashiers did to their cash registers. If there were seven checkout lanes open, five of them had their lights flashing to warn everybody that the person pushing the keys messed up again for the 5th time in the past two hours.</p>
<p>If you went to a McDonalds in Macon it would take 25 minutes to get your incomplete order from the employees who were living Hubert H. Humphrey&rsquo;s dream even if you were the only customer in the place.</p>
<p>In a Texas McDonalds those Mexicans would often have most of your order on your tray before you even got your change put away.</p>
<p>Same story in the stores. Checkout was easy.</p>
<p>The EEOC needs to be dismantled, and we need to dig up Hubert H. Humphrey and make him eat that damn Civil Rights bill like he said he would.</p>

		<p>My employer hired a mexican immigrant as a dishwasher in the restaraunt I work at. The day after the mexican started, the black kitchen workers had already realized that they could stop doing their after hours cleanup and wait until their el hombre nuevo had finished scrubbing the kitchen top to bottom. To pass the time, they would watch the NBA playoffs and clock out once Ricardo had finished.</p>
<p><br>
If every story has two sides, why do we only read about the claims of the descriminated parties? I wish that for once, journalists would ponder out loud in one of their discrimination pieces, why exactly do people avoid associating with blacks. Blaming it on something as obscure as racism isn&rsquo;t good enough, we need hard evidence: testimony from the people who deal with them. Surely those smart, antiracist Americans,stunned that people like us exist in this day and age, would like to have a clearer understanding of what motivates us.</p>

		<p>While over in Saudi, I had the chance to spend time in Saudi homes and speak with them on various topics.  The Saudis are so rich, NO Saudi needs to work.  Many are in government positions or managerial positions if they hold any position at all.  ALL middle class work and low grade work is done by immigrants.  The point is, they spoke of trying various ethnic immigrants to do their work for them - blacks, Philipinos, Indians, Palestinians, Pakistanis, etc.  Of them all, they said the blacks (even muslim blacks) were the WORST.  They expelled ALL blacks from the country.  Laziest of them all, the most untrustworthy, the most likely to rape and ogle women and chase after them, the most likely to steal (in a country that cuts off your hands if you steal).  Indians, they say, are the best workers and the most honest.  Palestinians were nothing but trouble and malcontents.  Philipinos were also lazy.<br>
The Pakis are okay for some engineering and other tech jobs.  But the blacks?  They will have NOTHING to do with them and ONLY let them in to do Haj, after which they MUST leave.</p>
<p>They hate and despise blacks.  Isn&rsquo;t it funny that so many American blacks then turn to Islam?  Especially when the history is that blacks were sold into slavery by muslim slave traders.  Forget Roots.  Ship captains did NOT troll the jungle looking for blacks to chain up.  They pulled up to the docks, and the arabs and muslims had them all chained and waiting for them.  And the ignorant blacks turn to Islam?  The only explanation is that (1) they are ignorant of history and (2) they hate ANYTHING white including religion.  Judaism and Christianity being seen as white religions.</p>
<p>Somebody needs to tell them Muslims hate blacks, and only use them while despising them.  And most of them would lose hands or heads in Saudi, the home of Islam, due to their innate behavior and inability to control their impulses.  </p>

		<p>Before Liberals gained control of America, Blacks were decent workers for the most part. They knew if they weren&rsquo;t, management (white or black) would fire them. Also, blacks had the capacity to do their job. Blacks with a 93 IQ did not go to college, they became taxi drivers, warehousemen, construction workers, etc.: In other words occupations for which they were qualified. Thanks to Liberals, as you well know, the situation is much different today.</p>

		<p>Mexicans do shoddy work also. In the construction industry it is very well known. Blacks are even worse. The gardners where I live are all non-english speaking mexicans and as I watch them, they sure do take short cuts.</p>
<p>  I will not eat anywhere when I see nothing but Mexican or black employees. There have been many articles about the lack of hygiene on the part of blacks/hispanics. I also would not stay in any hotel/motel where they are employees as they have access to the rooms. They steal just like blacks do.</p>

		<p>To the posters who think Mexicans are better workers, etc&hellip;<br>
Mexicans are just as bad as blacks. They do shoddy work in the construction industry as has been reported many times. In the motel/hotel business they steal just like blacks do. As gardeners, I have watched them here where I live and see the &#8220;short cuts&#8221; they take every time. We have also read articles here on Amren about their lack of hygeine in the restaurant/fast food places. Give me back the days when Whites were the employees doing the &#8220;jobs &#8220;Americans&#8221; won&rsquo;t do&#8221;&hellip;..As for the GSA caving into the diversity is necessary jargon, they are as weak/condecending as most organizations in America today.<br>

You have to be grateful if they don&rsquo;t do things behind your back to spite you, like spitting in food and stealing stuff. With hispanics, you have to be concerned about petty theft and lack of cleanliness, but at least they work hard and if they gripe it&rsquo;s in Spanish&hellip;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m the manager with a company that involves technical work. There were serious problems in our division with damages to company property and work performed incorrectly. The manager before me was fired and when I took his place, I implemented an aptitude test for all incoming employees and forced all employees beneath me to take a knowledge based test related to our industry if their work performance was questionable. Needless to say, almost every single Black employee that worked for me was eventually let go; they did not understand some of the most basic fundamentals of the job and no amount of additional training could get them up to snuff. </p>
<p>After two years of being manager, there is only one Black guy working beneath me and no Hispanics. Since basic scientific knowledge is a requirement for the work that we do, it automatically eliminates a large segment of applicants and I&rsquo;m able to avoid any claims of discrimination by the EEOC. It&rsquo;s ridiculous that other companies can&rsquo;t also take basic measures to weed out undesirable applicants as well thanks to the disparate impact ruling. Being a reliable worker should be a requirement for any job, but the EEOC will claim that disproportionately targets Blacks.</p>

		<p>I had an instructor years ago, real old school type from the pre-WW2 era and he liked to say that necessity was the great motivator. </p>
<p>The reason Mexicans work hard is because they have to. Most were brough up in a culture that didn&rsquo;t have a real welfare system with rewards for not working. </p>
<p>Believe it or not I worked with blacks many years ago and they would work hard to. These were older blacks even back in the day but somewhere around the 1960s our government started letting blacks live without working and for many that was all that was needed. </p>
<p>If these hard working Mexicans become citizens with all the rights and privileges that minorities have just give it a couple of generations and see what happens. </p>

		<p>Just an observation:</p>
<p>If I see a large group of Mexicans at Home Depot or on a street corner I know they are looking for work..any work, hard labor included.</p>
<p>If I see a large group of blacks on the corner, they are looking to sell drugs or cause problems. If the roads are clear, I don&rsquo;t even stop at red lights.</p>

<p>So, these corporations who own most of the wealth in the US and can afford the most expensive lobbying and strong arm tactics to get what they want politically, can&rsquo;t deal with the EEOC?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you believe it.  The truth is that these corporations hired closet marxists who then hired only other closet marxist and took over leadership of the company.  Now, their policies are about &#8220;social justice&#8221; (while lining their own pockets), especially anti-white racism.  The last thing they care about are profits, costs, etc.  When the company goes bankrupt, they activate their golden parachutes and either move on or retire.</p>
<p>A pretty strong argument for laws that forcibly dissolve corporations when the person who made them dies.</p>

		<p>I am not sure that articles like this are helpful to White Americans. It seems that a good number of the responses here agree with the hotel manager that Hispanics are somehow superior workers and employees. <br>
Those who express approval of Hispanics&rsquo; supposed work ethic are in fact giving indirect approval to the illegal invasion, and I worry that all this praise, however tepid it may be, of Latino workers is just another sign that the illegal invasion is being accepted by even race-realists.</p>
<p>When, incidentally, did the now-popular stereotype of the &#8216;hard-working Latino&rsquo; get started? The very opposite was the popular perception a few decades ago. Remember the popular image of the Mexican taking a siesta under a cactus? How did they suddenly become examples of a superior work ethic?</p>
<p>Comparing blacks to Hispanics is not helpful. We should not be siding with one over the other, or saying we prefer anybody except our own people, who, I thought, were supposed to be the focus here.</p>

		<p>Several years ago I had a new roof put on my home/office. Since I speak Spanish and wanted the work done fast, correct, and cheap, I hired a Spanish company.</p>
<p>The business across the street from me - a politically correct political organization hired a well you guessed it, the other politically correct minority company. </p>
<p>At four o&rsquo;clock in the morning I was awakened by yelling in Spanish and banging on my roof. In two days I had a new roof on a five thousand square foot building and the team had completely cleaned the area and was gone. Across the street, and on a building half my size, ten days later, the blacks were still &#8220;working&#8221;.</p>
<p>And I can guarantee you that they paid a great deal more than I did. </p>
<p>While I do speak Spanish the owner of the roofing does not and although he is an American all of his workers are Hispanic. Oh, I forgot to mention one more thing-  the owner of the company is also BLACK!!!  </p>
