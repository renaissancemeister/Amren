<h1>Beauty Queen Loses Crown Over Scuffle</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WBLT-TV (Jackson, Mississippi), October 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The first &#8220;Miss Kentucky Latina&#8221; has been stripped of her title and is facing felony charges after she allegedly assaulted two people in Madison County, KY.</p>
<p>Daniela Gaskie, 22, is the reigning Miss Kentucky Latina, a first for the state.</p>
<p>She was arrested last Wednesday in Richmond and is charged with two counts of assault after two separate attacks.</p>
<p>Police say Gaskie first stabbed Swifty employee Jonathan Carpenter in the neck with a pen after he didn&rsquo;t let her into the gas station.</p>
<p>Police say Gaskie apparently then ran across the street and got into a fight with pharmacist Mary Ann McKinley in the parking lot of M&M; drugs.</p>
<p>The 59-year old pharmacist says Gaskie punched her in the stomach, kicked her and tried to bite her.</p>
<p>Police say they believe alcohol was a factor in the alleged attacks.</p>

<p>[Daniela] Gaskie was Miss Kentucky Latina until pageant officials learned about her arrest last week after police said she stabbed a gas station attendant and beat up a pharmacist in Richmond, south of Lexington.</p>
<p>Mary Ann McKinney, a pharmacist at M&M; Drug, reportedly saw a woman beating on McKinney&rsquo;s car. She walked outside and approached the woman, who started beating her.</p>
<p>&#8220;She immediately kicked me with her knee into my abdomen and ripped at me and tore my glasses off and ripped my neck and scratched me and busted my lip. Had a knot on my head. She was quite wild,&#8221; McKinney told CBS affiliate WLKY.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police said Gaskie also stabbed an attendant at a gas station across the street from the drugstore.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police charged Gaskie with assault, disorderly conduct and criminal mischief. Her arrest report stated officers detected alcohol on her breath and that she told them she was being profiled for being &#8220;Mexican.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Miss Latina U.S. organization {snip} stripped her of her title Tuesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>McKinney said she first learned about the title Gaskie held when her friends looked into her car and saw a Miss Kentucky Latina sash.</p>
<p>The Miss U.S. Latina organization also learned that Gaskie was married and said they would have taken away her crown sooner had they known that information.</p>

<p>Hahahahaha.  Hillarious!</p>
<p>They and the multicults talk about unity, one nation of everyman, the melting pot, the rainbow utopia, and every single tribe in the US but whites separates along lines of tribal factions and withdraw unto themselves rejecting the culture, language and history of this country.</p>
<p>These are indeed Orwellian times.</p>
<p>As Glenn Beck so rightly warns us:  &#8220;I pray to God I&rsquo;m wrong, but be prepared for the horror that is coming upon us, for these shall be the most trying times in our short history.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beck KNOWS much more than he is telling us on t.v. and radio.  His political connections and expert advisors are of higher caliber than what the White House has access to.</p>
<p>But anyone who stays current can pick up enough information to know the horror that Beck alludes to.  He knows this country&hellip;.and the entire West&hellip;is going to erupt into more chaos than most people could ever imagine, in the near future.</p>

		<p>As we sink further and further into the 3rd World, events like this are going to be commonplace.  As we become more like South American countries like Brazil and the White population dwindles, Whites will become more and more passive, more and more demoralized.  I&rsquo;m convinced now is the time.  If large segments of the White population don&rsquo;t wake up sometime in the next 10 years with a collective willingness to fight to retain our national identity, culture, heritage, and heroes, then they never will.  <br/>

		<p>I read an article on V-Dare a few years ago where it quoted an MSM article that quoted a Hispanic woman who moved her and all her children from L.A. to Lexington, Kentucky.  She told the MSM outlet that the reason she left L.A. was:</p>
<p>&#8220;Too many Mexicans.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Lexington&rsquo;s fate in about 10-20 years maybe sooner.</p>

		<p>A Miss Kentucky Latina? This would be hilarious if it weren&rsquo;t such a pathetic example of how far down the tubes our society has gone.  Looks like the Miss Kentucky Latina pageant (if there is such a thing) could conveniently be held at at a state girls reformatory, and scores of superbly qualified contestants could be rounded up quickly. I&rsquo;m sure we all look forward to Miss Latina contests in many states in the near future.</p>

		<p>While many latinos are nice people, they have a lot of baggage that comes along with them.  Most that I have seen have a devil-may-care attitude about life, even the nice, respectful ones.</p>
<p>White nations have learned to look towards the future and make long range plans.  Many white families do this also and go so far as to &#8216;set up&rsquo; their unborn grandkids with trust funds and such.</p>
<p>I just have not seen anything more from latinos other than what&rsquo;s happening right now.  And I know A LOT of latinos from all over latin america.</p>
<p>Substance abuse is part of that live-it-up mentality.</p>
<p>Also, this girl&rsquo;s last name sounds white.  So perhaps she was married to a white dude. (I&rsquo;ve heard and thought that white latinos are sometimes marriage material, so it&rsquo;s not unusual.) How could the latino organizers, looking at her last name, NOT know she was married.</p>

		<p>Is it just the photos or my eyesight, but she looks whiter than most white people I know.<br/>
   How does one qualify as a &#8220;Latino&#8221; any way. Do one or more parents have to speak spanish? Do you have to be born in a spanish country? </p>

		<p>Maybe this article might make a point to those who think Hispanic or Latinos are more non violent and accepting of white people than blacks. The sad fact is that this kind of behavior is becoming all too common place and being made light of by the media. As they try to force multi-culturalism down our throat. With garbarge on TV like Glee, it is more important than ever that parents use these as examples of how not to behave. Yes, America has, not is becoming, a third world country. </p>

		<p>Lovely, but then the reputation of beauty queens went down the toilet when the first black Miss America (Vanessa Williams) was caught having posed for nude and lesbian sex photos which stripped her of her crown as well. Is this really news to anyone? Latina women, especially the young ones tend to be very hot-headed are often hostile and prone to violence. Brown behavior at it&rsquo;s best. </p>

<p>I believe that whites will wake up. It&rsquo;s already happening. It&rsquo;s a slow process, but I think that increased diversity will cause it to speed up. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction, to misapply physics, and people are already noticing their dispossession. From that to political action is but a small step. In 30 years, if we do indeed become a minority, we will be the biggest, smartest, best organized, best funded minority in the land. </p>
<p>But we need to do more than inform our people of the problems caused by too much diversity; we need to advocate for and participate in Western culture. Our culture is richer and more varied than any other, precisely because of its participatory, dynamic nature. Don&rsquo;t just bash ghetto rap; play Bach. Read Kipling. Learn higher math. Write poetry. Dare I even suggest, compose music? </p>

		<p>I, too, hope whites will take action soon as I can see more and more of us are waking up.  Buy guns, keep ammo on hand, exercise often, keep your bodies in good physical strength, eat healthy, learn some self-defense moves, always carry a weapon on you or in your car of some type (at least carry a taser and a thing of mace).  Protect yourself and your family at all costs.  I&rsquo;m prepared.  Are you?</p>
