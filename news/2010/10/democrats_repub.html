<h1><a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1010/43211.html">Democrats: Republicans Would &#8216;Turn Back Clock&rsquo; on Minorities</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Simmi Aujla, Politico, October 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The highest-ranking black and Hispanic Democrats in the House said Wednesday that a Republican majority will &#8220;turn the clock back&#8221; with an agenda that hurts minorities.</p>
<p>House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn of South Carolina and Democratic Caucus Vice Chairman Xavier Becerra of California told reporters Wednesday that minorities will lose ground on health care and education, and Republicans will prevent any progress on immigration if the GOP takes control of Congress Nov. 2.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Clyburn promised that Democrats will aggressively push for minorities on issues like health care reform.</p>
<p>&#8220;Next year, we may even get the public option,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is important for future generations that we do everything we can to energize the vote.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The Senate, because of the Republican filibuster, became a graveyard for good ideas, including immigration reform, including further reforms to the health care system,&#8221; Becerra said.</p>
<p>Just a third of Latino registered voters said they have given the November election &#8220;quite a lot&#8221; of thought, according to a Pew Hispanic Center poll released yesterday. But half of registered voters overall expressed the same sentiment. The numbers are bad for Democrats, since Hispanics overwhelmingly vote for them.</p>
<p>Lack of progress on comprehensive immigration reform has left some Latino voters disenchanted with Democrats, but the poll also found that Latinos are more worried about jobs and the economy.</p>

		<p>Okay - maybe we can turn back the clock to 1787. </p>
<p>Barring that, this just shows how blacks, and to a lesser extent Hispanics, do not see government as something for all the people but only how it will affects handouts and giveaways for a specfic group.</p>
<p>This is also fear-mongering. The phrase &#8220;turning back the clock&#8221; is meant to evoke - in guilty whites - images of lynchings and plantations and segregated lunch counters. It has nothing to do with reduced government spending or personal responsibility. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all for turning back the clock if it means working for a living, not having my tax money support 5 children of an unwed mother, and long prison sentences for repeat felons. </p>

		<p>A black judge in western Pennsylvania turned down a plea on the basis of the defendant&rsquo;s skin color, stating that it was &ldquo;a ridiculous plea that only goes to white boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Judge, Joseph Williams, later recused himself but amazingly still has his job.</p>
<p>The case involved a 24-year-old man who got into an altercation with police during a traffic stop. The man, Jeffery McGowan, entered a plea of disorderly conduct in exchange for a sentence of three months&rsquo; probation, but the judge wasn&rsquo;t having any.</p>
<p>From the bench, Williams told Assistant District Attorney Brian Catanzarite, who was standing in for the prosecutor who had brokered the deal, that he &ldquo;comes up with I think ridiculous pleas whenever it&rsquo;s a young white guy. I&rsquo;m just telling you what my observation is. If this had been a black kid who did the same thing, we wouldn&rsquo;t be talking about three months&rsquo; probation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The defendant, who was facing more serious charges, including aggravated assault, had no criminal record. Under such circumstances, it is not uncommon for a defendant to be permitted to plead out to a lesser charge, especially in view of the fact that the officer involved in the scuffle was not injured and assented to the bargain.<br>

		<p>Well, I for one certainly hope that a Republican congress would turn back the clock on the current racial spoils system.  It has rendered blacks and Hispanics a permanent underclass and made any genuine black or Hispanic achievement suspect, at least outside the realm of athletics, which is notoriously objective.</p>
<p>Perhaps blacks and Hispanics would have remained more or less a permanent underclass in a majority Caucasian and a growing East Asian environment, but absent affirmative action they&rsquo;d not have become a net burden to society.</p>

		<p>How to stop the race card.<br>
When they use &#8220;Minority&#8221; vs. &#8220;Majority&#8221; claim, point out that<br>
whites are 7% of the worlds population. 93% of the world is<br>
non white. There are only 180 million whites in North America.<br>
There are 1 Billion non whites in this hemisphere alone.<br>
They all want to displace whites in the USA. We are the persecuted minority. We are the ones suffering genocide. The world population  is 7 Billion..by 2050 it will be 12 Billion..almost all the growth will be non European, non white. We are the group hanging on by our<br>
fingernails. Enough of the white &#8220;majority&#8221; lies.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s how I beat the EEOC at their own game of mandatory minority hiring:  I have large glass framed American flags in every office, not to be removed under any condition, photos of the founding fathers in the lobby and throughout the entire 170,000 sq ft building, and numerous quotes about such scary things as personal responsibility, effort and persistence.  Minorities come in to interview, and then somehow never seem to return after everything is completely documented about the interview(s) and the follow up phone calls.  Once they see it&rsquo;s an actual place of business and WORK, they never seem to pursue the positions.  I&rsquo;ve been investigated 8 times over 10 years and my documentation is absolutely flawless.  I maintain a 100% WHITE American workforce and sales/production are off the charts.  No need to drug test, no employee conflicts, no blacks constantly hitting on the professional White female employees.  It&rsquo;s pure Heaven and the EEOC hates me for it.  I&rsquo;m on their radar because I personally employ 1103 White employees.  Not workers&hellip;employees, without any unionization either.  It can be done if you plan it to the subatomic particle level of detail.  Every Shawtika and Durrell and Keela that visits me with stern looks and language always leave totally defeated.  The clock has been turned back to a more normal time and we&rsquo;re all hated for it.</p>

		<p>Regrettably the Bushes, Gingriches, Hannitys and Becks don&rsquo;t want to turn back the clock. When Trent Lott stated several years ago that the nation would have been better off with Strom Thurmond as President, as opposed to St Harry Truman, the outrage from the GOP and the Dems drove Trent, no adventurous defender of European rights, back to private life.</p>
<p>Until the Tea Party or a new independent movement comes out fully against affirmative action, all immigration from nonEurope sources, all trade with Asia/Africa/Latin America, and against a public school system that pretends that all kids are equal, we are whistling Dixie, but we aren&rsquo;t in Dixie. And I&rsquo;m from the New England area! </p>
<p>Boy, did we make a mistake to support Lincoln and not Jefferson Davis!</p>

		<p>Turn back the clock to that nasty time, that nasty time as recent as 1950, when more blacks had jobs than whites, when more than half of African Americans graduated from HS, when the most dangerous drug that could be found was marijuana, and it was the drug itself that posed the greater danger, and when less than 80% of black, and less than 30% of white children were being born outside of marriage and that terrible time when most things in the store were made in the USA as opposed to now where virtually nothing is.  </p>

		<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not necessary to go all the way back to 1787.  Back to 1950 would suit me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s strange, but for some reason, I do not feel guilty about anything at all, and I&rsquo;m a Southerner and proud of it. </p>
<p>Didactic sounds like the kind of guy I&rsquo;d want fighting by my side if it comes to fighting to survive here in the good ole&rsquo; USA.  I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll understand why I&rsquo;m somewhat partial to Jefferson Davis.  I&rsquo;m one of those who doesn&rsquo;t think that we have &#8220;unearned white privilege.&#8221;  We may have the privileges that accrue to those who are among (and descend from) those who built this country, but that is hardly &#8220;unearned,&#8221; and I&rsquo;ve never considered myself to be all that privileged.  I&rsquo;m just one of the &#8220;hard workin&rsquo; Po folks.&#8221; </p>

		<p>I still say, it&rsquo;s well past time to get everyone who -can- pay on the same side of the roller as we push this freakin&rsquo; pyramid capstone upslope.</p>
<p>How many, of any color or class, are never going to amount to a hill of beans on the &#8216;lifetime charge&rsquo; scale?</p>
<p>Fifty million?</p>
<p>One Hundred?</p>
<p>_More_?</p>
<p>How much -can we- afford to give them, per year, without condition as rent, food and basic cable package entertainment.</p>
<p>All those who sign up are permanently sterilized and lose forever the right to migrate out of their tax bracket.</p>
<p>As soon as we tabulate the transfer payment values for supporting the permanent social welfare class we -have right now-, in a cross racial appeal: &#8220;You like being in the middle class?  This is what it&rsquo;s gonna cost you, thanks to lackadaisical government immigration policies and prior attempts to buy out poverty&hellip;&#8221;.  The sooner we can get some kind of effective, restrictionist, zero immigration replacement policy rammed through as a Constitutional modification.</p>
<p>One which gives everyone legally here incentive to clap as we start kicking out the illegals who shouldn&rsquo;t be.  While putting the ones who turn around and try to come back on the other side of a mined border.</p>
<p>It is that simple.  I don&rsquo;t like you.  You don&rsquo;t like me.  But we have some interests in common.</p>
<p>Political compromise is an ugly, ugly, thing.  But without a party willing to take the huge risk in representing our interests, exclusively as whites, we face a condition whereby America will become the third world and NOBODY will be able to live or certainly prosper here.</p>

		<p>This whole mess with massive immigration from the third world and affirmative action, etc., etc. for blacks all started with the Kennedys.  Rich boys looking for a cause but extremely short sighted.  Johnson continued their policies so as not to be outdone.  Ignorant fools. This country is set on a path of self-destruction with endless hordes of third worlders coming for the spoils.  Can the white race save itself?  First it has to overcome the brainwashing from the media.  Europe and this country is breaking down as in past civilizations built by white brain power due to demographic shifts toward the undesirable.</p>

		<p>Amen, #1!</p>
<p>I truly wish we could turn back the clock a few hundred years.  On just about everything, in fact; race, religion, morality, nationalism, youth culture, the list goes on and on.  In the modern day, we are taught to disdain and laugh at everything that is antiquated.  This is dangerous thinking, as it assumed that we know more than our ancestors did.  And clearly we do not.</p>

		<p>Didn&rsquo;t everyone get the memo that&rsquo;s been going around for the last few decades? To leftists ANY political movement, legislation, or politician that does not explicitly glorify minorities and provide race based handouts is bigoted, troglodytic, and evil.</p>
<p>Rep. Clyburn certainly knows the images that &#8220;turning back the clock&#8221; conjures: Colored only drinking fountains, Emmitt Till style Jim Crow etiquette, fire hoses, lynchings, etc. To ME, and I&rsquo;m sure many here, the phrase is beautiful thing. Let&rsquo;s turn back the clock, shall we? Let&rsquo;s use 1955 as a benchmark since I just watched Back to the Future.</p>
<p>In 1955:</p>
<p>Euro-Americans comprise 85-90 percent of the US population while Afro-Americans and very tiny numbers of Asians and Hispanics comprise the remaining 10-15 percent.</p>
<p>American cities are clean, safe, and majority Euro-American</p>
<p>Immigration is (still) largely European</p>
<p>Afro-American music is listenable, and can still be called music with a straight face</p>
<p>Minority families are intact, as there is no welfare to promote paternal abandonment or maternal irresponsibility</p>
<p>Affirmative action? What the heck is that?</p>
<p>Simply being called a &#8220;racist&#8221; by a minority couldn&rsquo;t get you fired, expelled, or worse</p>
<p>Black on white crime is not yet endemic</p>
<p>The billion dollar race hustling industry is still a few years on the horizon</p>
<p> Just think- What if just ONE of these things were still applicable? To quote Sam Cooke, &#8220;What a wonderful world this could be.&#8221;</p>

BRAVO!<br>
This is THE point, THE reality that will seal the fate of the white race, and as the white race dies, the world tumbles into hellish entropy.  In fact, white save self- segregation, it&rsquo;s a done deal. Make no mistake.<br>
And worse yet, consider that perhaps HALF of that meagre 7% is non diversitard/libtard. <br>
Now consider that less than half of that 3.5% is under the age of sixty. <br>
Now consider that perhaps half of that 1.75% is inclined and able to act vigorously to defend the white world.<br>
Well, that .87% is worth more genetically, physically, mentally and philosophically/spiritually (in terms of will and fortitude) than the whole rest of the world, but&hellip;this is beyond bleak. Great things from great men are required. Greater than anything yet achieved in the history of humanity. Perhaps a sea change will awaken dormant traits in the dwindling white population at large&hellip;perhaps libtards will wake up. But I think not.I think libtards are nature&rsquo;s lemming, designed to auto-destruct, and pull the world&rsquo;s population down with them. It is ironic that race traitors and self haters like Susan Sontag say things like &#8220;The white race is the cancer of humanity&#8221; when in fact, Sontag and her ilk are the disease, the death itself. They are the grim reaper, and they don&rsquo;t even know it, so narccisistic  as they are!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not wasting my life in hopes that the libtards are going to awaken. They&rsquo;re programmed to go to sleep. I&rsquo;m going to live my life with blinders, as much as I can, in the whitest, most pristine place I can find. I will not stand up to the tidal wave of sewage. That wave is not worth my blood, sweat or tears. I&rsquo;ll not waste  a moment lammenting the death of a white world that brought this on itself.<br>
Old world, R.I.P. <br>
Come what may&hellip;</p>

		<p>By &#8220;turning back the clock&#8221;, do they mean bringing us back to a time when blacks didn&rsquo;t feel safe and comfortable to randomly attack whites for the amusement of the blacks, leaving many of the white victims dead or permanently disabled/damaged?  Do they mean turning back the clock to a time when anybody trying to intimidate anybody else in front of a polling place was prosecuted regardless of their race?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the GOP will do that.   They&rsquo;re all talk.  That&rsquo;s something that I hoped whites with raised consciousness would finally come around to doing collectively on their own. </p>

		<p>I would like to turn back the clock to August 28, 1963.  That is when Martin Luther King, Jr. gave his &#8220;I have a dream&#8221; speech in front of the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington.<br>
 <br>
The delivery of that speech was the high water mark of the civil rights movement.  The five years of black ghetto rioting, and the more enduring increases in black social pathology came later.  They were not anticipated by integrationists.  <br>
 <br>
In August 28, 1963 it was still possible for an intelligent, well informed person to believe that blacks were unoffensive victims of irrational color prejudice who would prove that they were equal to whites as soon they were given equal rights. <br>
 <br>
As a child I thought that way.  It felt good to think that way.  I would like to turn the clock back to August 28, 1963.  Then I would like to stop the clock. </p>

		<p>Mr. Englelman (#18), I too in &#8216;63 thought it was quite patriotic to back King&rsquo;s inclusive sounding speech. But now I don&rsquo;t want to go back to those disastrous years.  </p>
<p>Affirmative Action is what these people wanted all along. Subsidized equality, not real equality. And King we now know was a Soviet agent, surrounded and guided by Communist Party officials at all times. </p>
<p>The King/Kennedy/Johnson clique then passed the Civil Rights laws and the Immigration Law of &#8216;65, which, along with the Emancipation Proclamation, the Reconstruction Constitutional Amendments, the Supreme Court decision in Brown v Board of Education (based on sociological theories that aren&rsquo;t true) and W. Bush&rsquo;s Patriot Act, are the most destructive documents in American History.</p>

<p>So amnesty for illegal aliens (&#8220;immigration reform&#8221;) is somehow a good idea?  I hope the Senate remains a graveyard for all of the leftists idiotic &#8220;good ideas&#8221;.</p>

<p>Except the Republicans didn&rsquo;t have 41 votes until Scott Brown won.  And he&rsquo;s nothing to write home about.  Before that, you had the Bobsey Twins in Maine, plus Flimsey Grahamnesty and Juan McAmnesty.  Not to mention Samnesty Brownback, and a few others.</p>
<p>The Democrats are what blocked a lot of these &#8220;good&#8221; (read: rotten) ideas.</p>

Like you I am opposed to affirmative action.  I do not think blacks should be discriminated in favor of.  I do not think they should be discriminated against either.<br>
 <br>
Do you think blacks should be discriminated against?  Do you think they should still be slaves?  What would you write in your new constitution?   <br>
 <br>
The American Communist Party supported Martin Luther King, Jr.  This would bother me if he passed classified information to the Soviet Union.  I do not believe he did.  Do you?  <br>
 <br>
Let&rsquo;s keep it civil. You raised some interesting issues. I suspect more posters on this forum agree with you than with me. <br>
 <br>
BTW, I have been the victim of several violent black criminals. I also have black friends.  One may have saved my life during an attack, at the risk of her own.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what the democrats are talking about. While the Republicans were the majority, there was no collective stand against affirmative action and illegal immigration. George Bush and John McCain wholeheartedly supported amnesty and open borders. They could have fought the anchor baby law, and the immigration reform bill of 1965. They could have fought hate crimes against whites. They did nothing. They did absolutely nothing except fill their pockets fight and wars for Israel. The Republicans were so PC and spineless, they didn&rsquo;t even try to save our country. They supported most liberal entitlement and agendas for the sole purpose of staying in power. They of course did not. A slim Republican majority will protest the health care bill, and that&rsquo;s it. They will not be successful. Amnesty will be accomplished either passively by not enforcing the law or by an executive order. The Republican party neutered itself decades ago. The democrats can comfortably sip their lattes or cheap booze bought with food stamps&hellip;.until there is no one left to steal from.</p>
