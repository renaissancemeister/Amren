<h1>Ethnic Divide in Guinea Widens, Threatens Election</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rukmini Callimachi, Yahoo News, Oct. 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ibrahima Diallo spends his days in Bed No. 7 of the municipal hospital here, waiting for the bones in his face to glue themselves back together. His teeth are tied shut, so it is hard for him to talk  &mdash;  but even if he could, he&rsquo;d have little to say to the patient in Bed No. 8.</p>
<p>That man also has a broken cheekbone. And like Diallo, he too was injured in the spasm of pre-election violence that swept Conakry last month. Yet the gulf between the two hospital beds is a mirror of the ethnic divide at the heart of Guinea&rsquo;s political life, which is threatening to derail what was supposed to be the country&rsquo;s first democratic election since independence in 1958.</p>
<p>Mory Keita, 25, was rushed into surgery after being slammed in the face by a rock. The rocks started raining down on the party headquarters of presidential candidate Alpha Conde, a Malinke politician, whose supporters, like Keita, are overwhelmingly from his ethnic group. Keita says the last thing he heard before he was knocked unconscious was the screams of people speaking the Peul language.</p>
<p>On the same day, the last thing Diallo, 46  &mdash;  a Peul  &mdash;  heard before passing out was the Malinke dialect. He was on his way to a soccer tournament in support of Peul candidate Cellou Dalein Diallo, whose Union for the Democratic Forces of Guinea, or UFDG, has the nearly unanimous support of Guinea&rsquo;s Peul population. The men who surrounded him insulted him in Malinke, telling him they would never accept a Peul president. They punched him until he spit up his own teeth.</p>
<p>Only four months ago, journalists flocked for a rare &#8216;good news&rsquo; story to this African capital ranked as one of the world&rsquo;s poorest, where black mold coats buildings and the smell of the sea mixes with that of the sewer. For the first time in Guinea&rsquo;s history, there was no incumbent to rig the election, and the army that had installed two of the country&rsquo;s three dictators had vowed not to meddle. A successful election was also expected to open the door to billions of dollars in planned mining investments.</p>
<p>But the mood of celebration fizzled when none of the 24 candidates won a majority, forcing a run-off between the No. 1 and No. 2 finishers, who are from the two largest ethnic groups, with a history of animosity. A shadow has since fallen over Guinea and the surrounding region, as the country&rsquo;s exercise in democracy degenerated into a contest along racial lines.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;People are no longer voting for a political platform. They are voting for an ethnicity,&#8221; says Lama Bangoura, a youth leader in the violence-prone Enco-5 neighborhood. &#8220;You go into the neighborhoods and ask who people are voting for. And you&rsquo;ll immediately see that all the Peul are voting for the UFDG, and all the Malinke are voting for the RPG.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Of the country&rsquo;s four major groups, the Peul are the largest, representing around 40 percent of the population of 10 million, and yet they are the only ones not to have had one of their own in power. Last year, they were singled out in an army-led massacre of protesters calling for an end to army rule. Peul women  &mdash;  identifiable by their lighter skin and Semitic features  &mdash;  were gang raped by soldiers chanting anti-Peul slurs.</p>

		<p>Stories like this upset the left&rsquo;s racial paradigm. Only the White ones can be so ignorant as to fight over ethnic power. So the self-hating &#8216;white&rsquo; liberal will say that somehow the former imperial powers are to blame for inter-tribal warfare. </p>

<p>Bingo.  Blacks <i>always</i> vote for ethnicity, as witness the Big Chief&rsquo;s near-divine status among amerikan black voters.</p>
<p>As in Guinea, so in amerika.  Wherever there are blacks, there will be tribal factionalism and violence.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Only four months ago, journalists flocked for a rare &lsquo;good news&rsquo; story to this African capital&hellip;</i></p>
<p>And where are those &#8220;journalists&#8221; (read: propagandists) today?  Out looking for stories about Evil White Racists to splash across the front pages, I have no doubt.<br>

<p>This <i>always</i> happens in a multicultural society.  Do you think that 91% of blacks favor Obama because they want illegal alien amnesty, or banker bailouts?  Nope, they favor Obama because he&rsquo;s black.  Multiculturalism kills democracy because political programs become irrelevant, people just vote for their own.</p>

		<p>The U.S. needs to send permanent peace-keeping forces to Guinea before this situation escalates into another Rwanda. So as not to alienate the Guinea people, the troops should all be Black. 40 million proud, Black, conscripted military men, women and children should be able to control the violence.</p>

		<p>I think that this is where Stokely Carmichael went to spend thirty or so years of his life. An agitator who was part and parcel fo the black power movement in the 1960&rsquo;s. Stokely called himself Kwame Toure when he resided there. Toure was the dictator that ruled for a period of over three decades with brute force. Stokely had not a problem with a black man oppressing other blacks. Suppression of any human rights, outright dictatorship was not a problem for the &#8220;civi rights&#8221; agitator when it was done by a black to other blacks.</p>
<p>Now the chickens are coming home to roost. I am not a country boy but I can see it happening when it is happening.</p>
<p>Good old Stokely.</p>

		<p>Problems like these are caused by colonial borders which put rival ethnicities together in the same colony.  The same kind of problem exists in Iraq with the rivalry between the Kurds, the Sunnis, the Shiites, the Assyrians, and the Chaldeans.  </p>

		<p>Seriously, why is this news? Does it matter who wins? The article acts as if the Union for the Democratic Forces of Guinea (what a name!) came up with a new take on Jeffersonian democracy.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that about the only difference in who takes power is the length of time before certain subsets of people get raped, shot, or beaten up.</p>
<p>Sooner or later they&rsquo;ll be a grab for the mineral wealth (China will likely win). In the meantime we&rsquo;re talking about a pointless, sub-4th world country that is a showcase for black incompetence.</p>

		<p>Think, Pennsylvania during the 2008 presidental election. </p>
<p>Only one of the tribes differs!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already <i>come to a town near you</i> and is, almost certainly, just the beginning unless the vast majority of White people permanently direct their voting preferences towards parties more concerned with their ethnic survival and pronto.</p>
<p>Multi-ethnic co-existence within one living space has been proven thoughout anthropological history, to be completely unnatural and unworkable leading eventually to genocide yet Marxist machinators are fanatically imposing this very policy which they call multiculturalism upon indigenous White nations, in full knowledge of the consequences.</p>
<p>This can only mean one thing which is that they&rsquo;ve been deliberately engineering conditions of the kind for at least thirty years so as to lead to the said genocide of indigenous White peoples throughout the West which has, in actual fact, been continuously going on under the radar for decades now. </p>
<p>They must be stopped by every and all means necessary.  </p>
<p><b>By every and all means, by every and all means, by every and all means.</b></p>

<p>More &#8216;blame the White man&rsquo; nonsense. If the borders are unsatisfactory and cause conflict, then why not adjust them on their own? The Czechs and Slovaks, all the Baltic republics, Ukrain, Belarus, and all the _-stans managed to disolve the old Soviet empire with minimal bloodshed. The main violent breakup was Yugoslavia because the rival religious sects quite mixed together in Bosnia especially. </p>

		<p>Having actually &#8220;lived&#8221; in this lovely peace of the planet called conakry, i can say if anything the author understated what its acually like there.  The funniest thing?  All<br>
the local singers and musicians on the radio who were begging the white man to come<br>
back and take care of things, so they can go back to their simple lives.  Amazing a country that provides almost a 1/3 of the aluminum ore for the entire world, yet can&rsquo;t seem to manage to get things like electricity and running water.</p>

		<p>If the UN was worth anything at all, it would organize and supervise plebiscite elections so countries like this one could be partitioned.  Of course the UN isn&rsquo;t worth anything at all, and partition would also require recognition on the part of our self-appointed &#8220;elites&#8221; that multiethnic nations are inherently unviable.</p>
