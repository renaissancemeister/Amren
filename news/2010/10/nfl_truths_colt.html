			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jason Whitlock, Fox Sports, September 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It&rsquo;s just Week 4 and I&rsquo;m already in midseason NFL Truths form. Buckle up and open your minds for the Truth:</p>
<p>10. From the we&rsquo;re-not-supposed-to-mention-this file: It was fascinating watching Peyton Manning and his BYU offense destroy the Denver Broncos.</p>
<p>The unwritten rule in sports writing/journalism is we&rsquo;re only supposed to mention racial progress when it involves dark-skin minorities. Obviously, I don&rsquo;t care about rules.</p>
<p>With receiver Pierre Garcon sidelined with an injury, the Colts started and played nine white guys on offense pretty much all day. NFL rosters are nearly 70 percent comprised of African-Americans. What the Colts did was significant.</p>
<p>For a day, the best offense in football was 82 percent white. Austin Collie, Garcon&rsquo;s replacement, put a clown suit on the Denver secondary with precise route running and nifty moves after the catch. Some practice-squad kid, Blair White, performed a Collie impersonation when Collie was tired.</p>
<p>Peyton Manning is the Larry Bird of this era. I mean that as high, high praise. I&rsquo;m not accusing Manning or the Colts of any kind of racism. Bill Polian, Jim Caldwell (and Tony Dungy) have surrounded Manning with players who mirror his approach to the game. Race is not the determining factor.</p>
<p>A willingness to prepare and shared values, I believe, are the determining factors.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to get back into it today, but I&rsquo;ve been writing for three years that baby-mama culture (no father in a child&rsquo;s life) is going to cost African-Americans jobs in professional team sports. This summer, Ron English, the black head coach at Eastern Michigan, came under fire for admitting he&rsquo;d prefer to recruit players who have fathers in their lives.</p>
<p>If Michael Vick had a stable/traditional upbringing, he might be on pace to be the greatest quarterback in the history of the league.</p>

		<p>Can somebody explain to me how during each of the 4 last super bowls, at least one of the teams has had a black coach? Doesn&rsquo;t this go against what we usually talk about on these websites in regards to black coaches?  Can somebody who knows more about the NFL explain what is going on here?  Is there something I don&rsquo;t know?</p>

		<p>Let me just say again that if Michael Vick hadn&rsquo;t taken a &#8220;sabbatical&#8221; from football he&rsquo;d be battered and on his way out, as most running backs are after 5 seasons.  Michael Vick is a running back with a strong arm.  The NFL isn&rsquo;t college, the linebackers are much too fast for this.  </p>
<p>Whitlock isn&rsquo;t witnessing &#8220;progress.&#8221;  What&rsquo;s happening is the world is rediscovering that white athletes never stopped being able to run, throw, and catch.  They were just ignored for decades and that&rsquo;s all going away now because major sports franchises are sick and tired of the dog-and-pony show that comes with every blue-chip black athlete.  </p>
<p>They&rsquo;re rediscovering values.  They&rsquo;re realizing that it pays to have players that don&rsquo;t bring tens of thousands of dollars into a strip club in a garbage bag, don&rsquo;t run drugs in the off-season, don&rsquo;t abuse women (except for Roethlisberger, but who knows between all the concussions and motorcycle accidents he&rsquo;s probably got a screw loose by now).</p>

<p>The simplest explanation can be summed up in a four-word phrase used in a 2006 CasteFootball.us article:</p>
<p>&#8220;Football isn&rsquo;t rocket science.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why there are a lot of great black football coaches.  Because it&rsquo;s not as complicated as football coaches would have you think.</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t Racist:</p>
<p>The last two games have created this new all of a sudden Vick mythology.  Yet, he&rsquo;s faced defenses (Detroit, Jacksonville) that are in the bottom six in the NFL thus far.  And he&rsquo;s facing another soft one in Washington this Sunday, and their D is even worse than the stats (statistically, they&rsquo;re about in the lower one-third) indicate   &mdash;   the awful RAMS laid 30 on em last Sunday.</p>
<p>He did face a serviceable D in Green Bay in Week 1, and had good numbers.  But GB&rsquo;s no Pittsburgh or Baltimore.</p>

		<p>There is rampant anti-white racism in the NFL. White high school football teams routinely defeat black teams yet the college recruiters offer the scholarships to the blacks. This discrimination gets even worse in the NFL, which is now almost 70% black.</p>

<p>Jason Whitlock doesn&rsquo;t &#8220;Care about rules&#8221; because he is black - thus he is above persecution by the PC Gestapo for saying something regarding race and football that isn&rsquo;t, in his words, extolling the &#8220;progress&#8221; of dark skinned athletes.  A white journalist would have been excoriated, regardless of whether he &#8220;cared about the rules&#8221; or not.</p>

		<p>Coaching football at a high level is more like being a corporate executive than the traditional &#8220;coach&#8221; of highschool and youth sports. An NFL headcoach has dozens of assistants and coordinators working under him; Coordinators who lay out strategy for the offence and defence and then position coaches who work with the individual players.</p>
<p>The role of the headcoach varies from organization to organization, with some being more involved in day to day operations and game day play calling than others. Many coaches don&rsquo;t call a single play on gameday.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible for a headcoach to be not much more than a figurehead within an organization. </p>

		<p>I just read the article and wasn&rsquo;t going to comment.  I saw that it was written by a &#8220;Jason Whitlock&#8221; of Fox Sports.  I thought it very surprising that he had anything positive to say about the Colts with 9 starting &#8220;White boys&#8221; on offense.  Then I went back to the amren homepage and realized Mr. Jason is Black.  If he was White we know what would have happened, and of course, if only Michael Vick had had a good upbringing then he would have shown that dopey old privileged White boy Peyton Manning a thing or two.  Why if only more Black football players would have had at-home fathers I bet the whole NFL would be Black right now.  Wouldn&rsquo;t you?</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;He (Vick) did face a serviceable D in Green Bay in Week 1, and had good numbers. But GB&rsquo;s no Pittsburgh or Baltimore&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Please note what white RB Peyton Hillis did against the vaunted Baltimore defense in Week 3.  The same Peyton Hillis who was released by the Broncos after being drafted 227th in 2008.  22 rushes for 144 yards and a 6.5 average.  1 TD.  7 receptions for 36 yards. </p>
<p>New England has a chance to equal the unbearable whiteness of the Colt&rsquo;s offense.  In Week 3 RB Danny Woodhead, as unwanted by the Jets as Hillis was by the Broncos, rushed 3 times for 42 yards and a 14.0 average.  1 TD.  </p>
<p>TE Rob Gronkowski and WR Julian Edelman (Jewish father, if wondering) add to an all-white OL, WR Wes Welker and QB Tom Brady.  91%, dare we dream?</p>
<p>&#8216;Athletic&rsquo; Colt&rsquo;s WR Pierre Garcon has the habit of dropping passes as shown by last year&rsquo;s Super Bowl.  But never mind, he has unlimited potential to go with his room-brightening smile.  Colt&rsquo;s WR Anthony Gonzalez (white Cuban father and white American mother, if wondering) has the habit of catching whatever is thrown his way.  Needs to work on smile.   </p>
<p>Since the best DE in the NFL is Viking&rsquo;s Jared Allen (72 sacks in 6 years) teams are now looking to draft white DEs with Allen-like attributes.  But not looking too hard.  All DEs in this year&rsquo;s college draft were black.  </p>

		<p>Its interesting he calls Peyton Manning the Larry Bird of his era.  K.C. Jones, the black former head coach of the Celtics, started mostly white players and dominated the NBA for years.  The Colts have a black head coach and he apparently has no problem with fielding a white team.  More numerous are black coaches, (and far too many white ones) that prefer black players. But the black coaches committed to winning and not racial nepotism have always had success. As a former football player myself, some of the absolute worst teams I ever saw were either entirely black or had one token white or hispanic.  The toughest teams were always the ones with a white offensive line, white quarterback, and white fullback.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been interested in and supportive of the Colts in the past couple of years, even though I am a die-hard Browns fan.  I had no conscious reason to do so, except that I found the Manning-run offense fascinating.  Now I have made conscious my subconscious reason.</p>

<p>&#8220;NFL rosters are nearly 70 percent comprised of African-Americans.&#8221;</p>
<p>The roster maybe is 70 % but the starting line ups are nearly across the board 100 %. </p>

		<p>It is an increasingly obvious, and increasingly cited, frustrating truth in the white nationalist community, that one of the #1 most fatal faults that the average &#8216;white male&rsquo; possesses, is his childish fascination with sitting on his hind parts in front of his television - glued (and totally distracted away from the far more important issues, such as the survival of his race and the survival and preservation of Western civilization) to his Big Screen TV, watching sports contests between various sporting teams consisting of mostly blacks.   Some have even pointed to this childish preoccupation and commented that our white women and white daughters and white sons observe &#8216;dad&rsquo; worshiping these blacks, a large percentage of whom are repeat criminals and the sorriest role models one could possibly imagine, and this is probably why our white daughters think its &#8216;cool&rsquo; and &#8216;trendy&rsquo; to date and sleep with blacks, and why so many of our white sons are aping the black look and behavior, wishing they were black, and driving around town in the cars that their white father bought for them, blasting black ghetto rap music out their car windows. </p>
<p>Correspondingly, it should be equally obvious that the enemies of White Western people - who also own and control the mainstream media - do not want White men or women to wean themselves off of their childish preoccupation with TV sports,  because keeping white men distracted by such foolishness and unimportant entertainment is a critical component of &#8216;boiling the frog slow&rsquo;.  Should the white male suddenly recognize that his TV is nothing more than a pacifier and a weapon to keep his focus and attention and energies away from working for the survival of his race and nation, and therefore decide to kill his TV - he might be able to devote those freed up energies to the far more important battle to save his people and the civilization created by his race.   My advice:  Kill those TVs, white man.    Reorder your priorities and realize it is time to give up childish things and start focusing on defeating the Cultural Marxist forces who seek your destruction.  </p>
<p>Oh, for those who wonder where and when this insane fad of &#8216;worshiping blacks and black culture&rsquo; originated, I would point back to the Clinton years in the White House.   One of the most disgusting aspects to the Clinton years, I always thought, was his propensity for rushing to the scene of any potential photo-op where he could surround himself with dozens of blacks, and then play his sickening role as &#8216;The Great White Savior&rsquo; who hates his own race and who promises to betray his own people in order to appease his black flock.    This is standard white liberal behavior, i.e., adopting this nauseating &#8216;air of moral superiority&rsquo; by working against the interests of the white race and kissing the toes and other less hygenic body parts of every non-white within strategic range of a set of white liberal lips.    </p>
<p>In less civilized times in history, such behavior would be seen as race treason and betrayal of ones own tribe and extended family and probably result in total ostracism from the tribe in the most lenient of circumstances, and in the most severe of circumstances - could be deemed a sin worthy of some form of extremely gruesome capital punishment.       In my view, there is no crime or offense that is more despicable than betraying one&rsquo;s own tribe and extended family of genetic kin - and I would like to see a resurgence in the old traditions as cited previously.  </p>

		<p>Whites have been discriminated in sports for a long time.  </p>
<p>Whites dominate boxing now but the media won&rsquo;t report it.</p>
<p>Everyones heard of Lawrence Taylor and Michael Strahan but few know that Kevin Greene has more lifetime sacks than either of them.  Greene was all but ignored by the liberal media.</p>
<p>White running backs play well and never get another chance.  Brock Forsey and Peyton Hilis are examples. Both played well and then were benched because they were white.</p>
<p>A white can run a faster 40 time than a black and the white will be called slow and the black fast.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a good site dealing with this - Caste Football.</p>

		<p>#1 Courtney - What is going on are the results of diversity and AA. I can only imagine the uproar had Dungy been replaced with a white coach in Indy. Had even an accomplished coach such as Mike Shanahan been given the reins - I can assure you there would have been controversy coming from somewhere. As it is, IMHO &hellip;. Jim Caldwell was out coached by Sean Payton in the last Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Week 2 of this season again saw Payton as the more astute coach as Mike Singletary&rsquo;s 49ers tied the game with around a minute to go. Problem is Singletary did not contemplate running off any time and depriving the Saints the chance to win in regulation - it just did not seem to occur to him. &#8216;Chess-play&rsquo; on this instance in particular does not appear to be one of his strengths. </p>
<p>A few years back I crunched the numbers quite religiously in regards to the NFL. One interesting stat at that time was the average age of a starting QB being 30. I dont believe that number has changed much since then. Normally around that age, either through injuries or nature, players in the so called &#8216;skill positions&rsquo; begin to retire. I would venture to say that if you took the average age of a starting black QB vs that of a white QB - you would find that the black starting QB to be younger. It is rare to see a starting black QB as deep in his career such as Donovan McNabb, while it is commonplace for whites. </p>
<p>Does anyone on this site have any questions as to why this may be so?<br>

		<p>You&rsquo;d think that just by chance alone there&rsquo;d occasionally be a majority white football team given that every team in the NFL still has SOME white players.  But then, if you pay close attention you realize that the NFL has a &#8220;caste system&#8221; in which chance does not factor in.</p>
<p>If the Colts, just one team, actually became a majority white team, Jesse Jackson would drop all the vitally important WORK he does and head down to Indianapolis right away. As would Sharpton.  He&rsquo;d have to likewise excuse himself from his important JOB DUTIES and also head down to Indianapolis to start a &#8220;civil rights&#8221; protest march or something. Jackson would simply go into strong-arm extortion mode an meet with the team owners.  The lamestream media would pick up on this situation  instantly, and all of the commentary would be along the lines of whether &#8220;racism&#8221; is returning to the NFL or if the &#8220;clock&#8221; of racial &#8220;progress&#8221; is being turned back, etc.</p>
<p>Humbled, and properly shamed, but also taking behind the scenes cues and orders from the office of the Commissioner of the NFL, the Colts would soon quickly find ways of trading away or even just cutting white players from the roster. Within a year, if not sooner, the norm would be re-established. Of course, the Colts might go 7-9 under a newly normalized roster, but hey, at least the specter of white racism would have been reversed!</p>
<p>Ever notice, though, in amidst all of the celebration of diversity in the NFL that Hispanic players and Chinese players and other players whose families are of Asian origin, and players whose ethnic origins are Indian (from India) are almost or totally unrepresented in the NFL?  Diversity means African-Americans. Diversity does not mean diversity.<br>

Race is not the determining factor.</p>
<p>A willingness to prepare and shared values, I believe, are the determining factors.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t it be?  The appearance of something is inherent to a trust of common thoughts from common genes.  It can be completely tribal and completely genetics driven at the same time.  &#8220;These guys are me, we want the same thing because we come from the same deep-in-the-blood instinctively trained background.  I will _fight harder_ for them!&#8221;</p>
<p>Just like the myth that more blacks served and died in line positions in Vietnam-</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/34o5vyt" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/34o5vyt</a></p>
<p>The reality is that people who are alike, be it by ethny, class or gender, band together to do the tough jobs because they think that if they can hack it and others look like them, then -together- they should have a really good chance of &#8216;same is as same can-do&rsquo;.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t mix for the purpose of losing as little as possible of the least valuable members.</p>
<p>Thus, in destroying any society built on ethnic homogeny as a confidence of ability to DO something, the first thing you must achieve is make that culture believe the they don&rsquo;t deserve to be doing something (such as winning a necessary war) and the second you must achieve is isolating like from like so that their confidence in a group hierarchy and synergy is lost.</p>
<p>Which is of course what a certain &#8216;culture of critique&rsquo; and their backing of civil rights and AA as a road to disenfranchisement quotas is all about.</p>
<p>And it is also one of the most dangerous reasons why racial differences as a statistical norm of &#8216;average individual&rsquo; (ain&rsquo;t no such thing) performance are ultimately so deceptive, dangerous and destructive.  Because in a world of lies, damn lies and statistics, any single number can be warped to make either side&rsquo;s case look flawed.</p>
<p>It then becomes -essential- to present an alternative argument that the totality of the people is stronger than the sum of it&rsquo;s constituent elements.  And this is highly proveable because it is a straight sum rather than an averaged mean.</p>
<p>And it is such a powerfully resonant thing, both emotionally and &#8216;by the numbers&rsquo; that the egalitarians and diversicrats cannot afford to allow such comparisons because they support the idea that population groups who think and look and act together _for each other&rsquo;s benefit_ derive a bonus from, gasp, being racist.</p>
<p>It is a struggle of races.  And we are being played, one off the other, by a third, weaker than either of those it victimizes.  And in this struggle, if you want to be strong as an individual, you have to be strongly bonded to Your Own Group.  A group which wins because it does NOT make way for others.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s the crux of the problem.  People of a similar background work together better.  Probably most of those white guys grew up playing football in their neighborhoods with mostly/all white kids.</p>
<p>The theory should hold true for a mostly/all black team also but the problem is that baby-momma culture that was mentioned.  Blacks are taught to be the big playa&rsquo; and they can only seem to work together for a short time before they all break out into individualistic jigs.</p>
<p>I stopped watching the NFL, the NBA and baseball many years ago because I got tired tired of seeing the childish black chest bumping, fist pumping, gawdy end zone dances, etc&hellip;.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll still watch hockey and tennis and sometimes golf because &#8216;inclusiveness&rsquo; has still not fully corrupted those sports.</p>

		<p>Can somebody explain to me how during each of the 4 last super bowls, at least one of the teams has had a black coach? Doesn&rsquo;t this go against what we usually talk about on these websites in regards to black coaches? Can somebody who knows more about the NFL explain what is going on here? Is there something I don&rsquo;t know?</p>
<p><br>
Yes&hellip;..what you don&rsquo;t know is that football is staged&hellip;.completely, play by play.  Its purpose (its ONLY purpose) is to get you to identify blacks as alpha males&hellip;..either to see yourself as less than them or, preferably, to see them as desirable leaders YOU submit to.</p>
<p>There are sophisticated brainwashing techniques being used on all television broadcasts but especially sports, ESPECIALLY football.  High tech stuff that makes you feel pain, when an example of what they don&rsquo;t want you to think is up on the screen, and pleasure when a command is given.</p>
<p>If you are watching football (and most other TV but ESPECIALLY football) you have been brainwashed and don&rsquo;t know it.  The only way to undo it is to go an extended period of time (years) without watching.  The world will be alot different to you after a time.  The brainwashing in others will become painfully (and I mean PAINFULLY) obvious.  You will wonder how you ever allowed yourself to get that way.</p>
<p>If you start watching again, you will simply forget what the big deal was or (like you are probably doing right now) rationalize how other people are brainwashed but not you.</p>
<p>Hehe&hellip;.not you.  That&rsquo;s funny to people who study mind control.</p>
<p>Yeah&hellip;no it&rsquo;s not.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Black columnist: For one day, the best offense in the NFL was 82 percent white.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, this black columnist is speaking up for whites.  However, if a white writer did the same, he&rsquo;s be demonized to the ends of the earth.  Really pitiful.</p>
<p>The posters on here who think white players are highly underrated are right, but nothing will change so far as recruitment is concerned.</p>
<p>To get a fair representation of whites on all sports team it is an absolute must that whites boycott all spectator sports until the unjust policies change.  Only then will we see white players enter these leagues that are top notch stars that do as well or better than the blacks on the team.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t watched spectator sports for 15 years, and I don&rsquo;t intend to until the anti-white practices are put to an end.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pitiful that more whites don&rsquo;t do the same.</p>

		<p>Can somebody explain to me how during each of the 4 last super bowls, at least one of the teams has had a black coach?</p>
<p>_________</p>
<p>The answer is quite simple:</p>
<p>The Rooney Rule, established in 2003,requires National Football League teams to interview minority candidates for head coaching and senior football operations opportunities. The rule is named for Dan Rooney, the owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers and the chairman of the league&rsquo;s diversity committee, and indirectly the Rooney family in general, due to the Steelers&rsquo; long history of giving African Americans opportunities to serve in team leadership roles. It is often cited as an example of affirmative action.</p>

		<p>Jay, you bring up an interesting problem.  I am from the South and I love my Alabama college football team(s)  (yes, both of them, as odd as that may be).  But unlike other Southerners, I don&rsquo;t make it my top priority.  </p>
<p>My priorities are Jesus Christ  first, my family second, my people (whites) third, and my Southern heritage after that, and then many other things come in line before my obsession with football (if you can call it an obsession).</p>
<p>I sometimes go online to see what is being discussed in football chat rooms.  I notice a lot of fans of Northern football teams such as Penn State love to belittle Southern football as much as they can.  They go into how &#8220;now that the South has taken over football, we see more criminals as football players, we see more personal fouls, more sideline dancing, and more touchdown celebrating and jumping around&hellip;&hellip;.&#8221;&hellip;blah blah blah.</p>
<p>I get irritated when Northerners turn everything negative about the South into a &#8220;Southern&#8221; issue, as if it is Scotch-Irish Southern bred whites such as myself who are responsible for the high crime rates and low test scores down here etc&hellip;..  White Northerners love putting the South down without recognizing or admitting that most of the South&rsquo;s problems are due to our high black population that most of the North lacks.</p>
<p>It would do these Northern football fans who love to sit and discuss these issues in their chat rooms, a lot of good, if they would watch how the black players on the West Coast teams act as well&hellip;&hellip;.this aint hardly a &#8220;Southern thang&#8221; yunno.</p>

<p>Easy. If you have a black figurehead coach, you are allowed to have more white assistant coaches, players and (most importantly) a white owner. Look for the guy talking into a stiff sheet of paper. He&rsquo;s the real coach.<br>

		<p>Look what happened to Vick today, just like I said.  Blacks blame the &#8220;racists&#8221; for the failure of black quarterbacks to win the big one.  They made every excuse for McNabb, not enough players around him, Terrell Owens was too much of a prima donna, etc.  When the Limbaugh comments about the establishment wanting blacks to succeed caused the big flap McNabb said &#8220;I thought we were supposed to be past all this.&#8221;  Then when the media came down hard on him for not playing to his level in the past couple years it was because he&rsquo;s black.   They only want to discuss race on their own terms.</p>
<p>No mention though of the vomiting on the field when the chips are down.  McNabb&rsquo;s Pro Bowl-level statistical numbers mean nothing in the face of the fact that he isn&rsquo;t clutch.  He&rsquo;s no Peyton Manning, that&rsquo;s for sure.  McNabb is a spectacular athlete with a strong arm who can take to his feet when he&rsquo;s unable to sort out pass coverages.  Manning is THE offensive genius of his generation who happens to have servicable athletic ability.  He&rsquo;ll be a spectacular coach one day when McNabb is living off his Campbell Soup money.  </p>
<p>The real problem is the fact that there are no black &#8220;quarterbacks,&#8221; just halfbacks with above-average arm strength.  McNabb is the closest thing there is, and that&rsquo;s mainly because he&rsquo;s approaching old-man status in the NFL.  He&rsquo;s spent plenty of time on the sidelines during games as a result of learning the hard way that you want your quarterback to take as few hits as possible and not barrel through the front seven to gain two yards.  That&rsquo;s what the halfback is for.</p>
<p>Michael Vick, Vince Young the Wonderlic wizard, these guys don&rsquo;t read defenses too well.  They&rsquo;re impatient and always run when receivers don&rsquo;t get open immediately.  This works for awhile, but then eventually you get crushed between two gigantic men while diving for the goal line.  Whether or not they have the ability to do so, they just don&rsquo;t last long enough in the league to progress to the point they can win championships, and won&rsquo;t until they learn to stay in the pocket and throw the ball away when there&rsquo;s nothing downfield.  NFL quarterbacks shouldn&rsquo;t rush for 100 yards per game.   </p>

		<p>Of the 70% African Americans who play for the NFL,50% of   those have felony records for violence or domestic violence. When two sides line up and all are black, 8 are criminals. Decent white and black people cheer them, buy their ball caps, patronize their sponsers, and waste their Sundays watching them sturt and dance in the end zones. It is enough to make a buzzard puke.<br>

		<p>In football there is a premium on speed, quickness, strength, intelligence, and leadership. Few whites have the speed of blacks. With anabolic assistance the strength issue balances out. Few blacks are as intelligent as whites. Few blacks are as disciplined either mentally, emotionally, or physically as are whites. Few blacks are capable of leading themselves much less anyone else [and that goes for black politicians as well]!</p>
<p>This year in college the premier team once again is the University of Alabama. The team is primarily black but in the positions which require intelligence it has it in abundance - expecially in the center and quaterback. The quarterback will probably opt out of professional football for either a Rhodes scholarship or a trip  to Harvard Law.</p>
<p>That said, there is absolutely no more physical football team in college than is Alabama. I had a sideline pass at the last game and I am absolutely convinced of that one fact. This team hits hard. And I mean hard! In an era with the premier head coach and nationwide recruiting this team recruits exactly who it wants irrespective of how the player may be ranked by some rating agency like the so called RIVALS. com Last years Heiseman winner was a four star recruit.</p>
<p>Some blacks are intelligent some whites are fast.Vick has got enormous talent but he has a tendency not to learn the play book and stay emotionally balanced. He can and will have great games. Can he take his team to the Superbowl? No. Never. </p>
<p>I was once throwing the old piggy around with a former University of Alabama quarterback when he made the comment that although we are now both past sixty we can still each throw the football farther than can the current quarterback for New Orleans.Although I am four inches taller at the same weight as Drew and can still probably lift more weight my life expectancy in the NFL would be just about three plays, maybe? </p>
<p>There are a lot of intangibles in the game of football. It&rsquo;s the little things that count. No one has ever explained it all better than did the late Paul Bear Bryant in the YouTube video speech to incoming freshman at Alabama.</p>

<p>In a lawsuit the facts are worth about 75% and the lawyer 25% in football the coach [over the long term] is worth about 75% and the players 25%. That said, Peyton is real coach for the colts. He just happens to play as well. </p>

		<p>Colts defense is the exact opposite of their offense.<br>
Preening, strutting and posing for the random ok play.<br>
A few bit players are serviceable but the Colts owners have not appreciated what they have with Peyton.  If they did, they would spend a little extra and give him an adequate defense.<br>
Had Peyton had an average defense he would have at least 4 superbowl wins.</p>
