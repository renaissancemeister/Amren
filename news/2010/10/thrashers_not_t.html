			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Greg Wyshynski, Yahoo! Sports, October 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fact is that the Atlanta Thrashers have an unusually high number of black players in their system: Defensemen Dustin Byfuglien and Johnny Oduya, and forwards Evander Kane and Anthony Stewart, on the NHL roster; with Nigel Dawes and Akim Aliu playing with the AHL Chicago Wolves. Sebastian Owuya, drafted last summer, is playing in the WHL; him and Kane are the only players not acquired by the team via trades or signings.</p>
<p>The trend is made more unusual because of geography: The City of Atlanta is more than 50 percent black and is the second largest in the U.S. behind New York; and it&rsquo;s a population that, traditionally, isn&rsquo;t watching the Stanley Cup Finals every season.</p>
<p>So the speculation began that this roster was being put together by design, in order for a team struggling to fill seats to reach an untapped audience for hockey. Pass It To Bulis (Mainstream Media: &#8220;The blogosphere&#8221;) published a well-received post about the trend, noting that by having six players hovering near the NHL level, the Thrashers had roughly 20 percent of the active black players in the NHL.</p>
<p>Was this on purpose? Was this a coincidence? In either case, are the Thrashers taking advantage of it? {snip}</p>
<p>The Pass It To Bulis piece is explicit in its claim that the Thrashers&rsquo; acquisition of these players was premeditated for marketing reasons:</p>
<p>From a business perspective, I support their strategy of acquiring black players. It is imperative to their success that they engage their community in the same way that Vancouver, Montreal, Indiana, and many other sporting communities do. As we&rsquo;ve seen, the way to do this (short of winning, which isn&rsquo;t an option for Atlanta) is to give your team a local connection. A Georgian birth certificate is a rarity in the NHL, but black players are beginning not to be. In Atlanta, this needs to be apparent in order for hockey to gain any momentum there.</p>
<p>GM Rick Dudley, speaking with NHL.com&rsquo;s Dan Rosen, denied these moves were made for demographic reasons:</p>
<p>Atlanta may be heading in that direction, but as GM Rick Dudley adamantly pointed out, it&rsquo;s not on purpose, as some bloggers and journalists have been suggesting. &#8220;If it happens to work in Atlanta because there&rsquo;s a large black population, that&rsquo;s great. But to do it purposely? That would be ludicrous to me,&#8221; Dudley told NHL.com.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t ever remember making a deal and saying this guy&rsquo;s white or black or whatever. I just really don&rsquo;t care.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to Jim Pfeifer, the vice president for marketing for the Thrashers and the Atlanta Hawks, the hockey team has placed ads in The Atlanta Tribune, the city&rsquo;s weekly black newspaper, as well as on V103, Hot 107, WAMJ and other stations classified as urban. Digital billboards throughout the area &#8220;focus more on Evander Kane, Dustin Byfuglien and Johnny Oduya,&#8221; Pfeifer said, &#8220;and we&rsquo;re definitely reaching a more diverse audience in all of Atlanta.&#8221;</p>
<p>Waddell told the Times that broadening the team&rsquo;s marketing scope was out of necessity, and that the Thrashers &#8220;don&rsquo;t have enough fans&#8221; in Atlanta:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Good players, but not a great team. And despite the interesting social marketing experiment playing out in the A.T.L., it all comes back to success on the ice. Tiger Woods doesn&rsquo;t have a large number of African-American sports fans tuning into golf for the first time if he were an over-par duffer. Boxing has seen more great white hypes than it can count through the years.</p>
<p>Winning, playoff appearances, championships .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. these are still the easiest way to market a pro sports team to the non-believers. But perhaps the Thrashers&rsquo; approach, incidental as they claim it to be, opens new doors when that success arrives.</p>

Thrashers were doing. They can never admit<br>

		<p>As I see the Sports ads become more and more shrill and over the top in glorifying the culture, I think they`ve turned a corner. Or we have. I just don`t see White American men buying the whole bill of goods anymore. <br>
 Maybe their cheerleader daughters have asked Dad to give up demeaning programming like he did smoking&hellip;</p>

		<p>Of course they are exploiting it, but the NHL itself is doing so to an even greater extent. If you watch many games on TV or on NHL Gamecenter Live, like I do, then you will notice that on nearly every NHL self-promotion advertisement all the black players are prominent. This is especially the case during &#8220;Hockey is for everyone month&#8221; (February, I think). The NHL is the only professional sport I watch anymore because it is the only one dominated by law-abiding and articulate human beings. The NHL doesn&rsquo;t seem to realize that with &#8220;diversity&#8221; they get everything else that has turned the NFL and the NBA into thugfests full of punks strutting their stuff.</p>

<i>&#8220;Good players, but not a great team.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Your classic multicultural, feel-good, self-esteem rising excuse.</p>
<p>&#8216;They may not be a winning team but they&rsquo;re all winners in their own special way&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t really figure out this piece. Is the author cynical that blacks are being &#8216;used&rsquo; to market the team in Atlanta? If so, it&rsquo;s your standard &#8216;damned if you do, damned if you don&rsquo;t&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t hire black hockey players, you&rsquo;re guilty of ignoring blacks. Hire black hockey players and you&rsquo;re guilty of exploiting the black population for profits.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s hardly a rare sentiment expressed here, but I am happy and proud that I don&rsquo;t watch spectator sports. I AM NOT A SPECTATOR.<br>
I played them.<br>
Sitting on your butt drinking beer, watching criminal thugs showboat is beneath the dignity of a slug. I mean it.<br>
And big sports ( I am subjected to hearing their shrill commentators on the TVs when I&rsquo;m in the gym locker room) is just a sickening multicultural idiotfest.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d throw a shoe through those TV screens, if I wasn&rsquo;t probably on hidden camera.</p>
<p>WHITES! ABANDON WATCHING ANY SPORTS. PLAY THEM. HUNT. FISH. PLANT CROPS. RACE CARS.<br>
Ditch the sick, dying mass media multicult horror, and take back your brains, your dignity, and DO SOMETHING!</p>

		<p>Black Canadian goalie Ray Emery would be a logical choice, if he could keep his nose out of trouble, that is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying he was tardy and got in fights because he was black, but it was definitely his character which got him released from the Ottawa Sens.</p>

		<p>I must admit, I&rsquo;ve never considered the NHL a gentleman&rsquo;s sport before&hellip;  :-)</p>
<p>That said, hockey does demand a great deal of team coordination, with rapid decision making in very fluid conditions and more than a little ability to be humble.  Whether routinely sending the puck up-ice for a better positioned stick to shoot with in a low probability scoring environment.  Or being on the receiving end of some cheapshots without getting mixed up in a fight because you know they other team are desperate enough to want you boxed, whatever the cost.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see if these fellahs contribute to the Thrasher&rsquo;s or not.</p>
<p>The sad part being that this is the future of 21st century sports with multicult leagues an economic as much as political reality across the board as an alternative to losing franchises in every city.  Welcome to a shrinking white base.</p>

		<p>You dont need more black players to attract black fans.<br>
You need more black hockey players that beat their girlfriends,<br>
and shoot and stab other blacks in night clubs at 3:00 am, you need  more blacks with tribal tattoos..preferably across their face, more black hockey players who assault their white coaches,<br>
with folding chairs on national TV and, of course, more white<br>
coaches that apologize for &#8220;cultural&#8221; insensitivity that led<br>
to said assault. And above all more smart Jewish owners to orchestrate it all and feel not a twinge of remorse for dragging the USA further into the gutter. Gather  those elements..and then Look Out Black Atlanta&hellip;Hockey has Arrived! </p>
<p>P.S. Reserve the front row seats for black &#8220;dignitaries&#8221;, <br>
edumacators and of course extended members of  the King family.</p>

		<p>They might want to  adopt the strategy of trying to please the people who actually buy the tickets, and attend the sporting events.  I&rsquo;ve been to NFL games and NBA games (both in Indianapolis). There are a fair amount of blacks living there.<br>
  Yet, look around the arena-95% of the fans attending are white.<br>

<p>Stupidity, &amp; nonsense.  Poor &#8220;article&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Atlanta area has the fastest-rising white population of any US city by far, as I just saw on Wikipedia.  The &#8220;city limits&#8221; population is about a tenth of the overall population of the metro area.</p>
<p>I go to a few Predators games in Nashville every year.  Percentage of the fans in the arena who are &#8220;black&#8221;:  I would guess 0.25%.  Maybe less.</p>

		<p>Personally, I think Black Canadian Players are better<br>
off in Canada than in say Atlanta or Chicago because of<br>
the Racial Climate. I remember Jarome Iginla was traded<br>
to Calgary from Dallas, and I think it was in His interests.</p>

<p>This guy must not have seen a boxing match since the 1970s. Whites dominate boxing from middleweight to heavyweight.</p>
<p>Of course, let a young white boxer like Kelly Pavlik lose one match and he is immediately labelled a &#8220;great white hype.&#8221; But blacks like Zab Judah can lose every major fight they are in and still be called a great athlete.</p>

		<p>One of the (unwritten) reasons the Baltimore Orioles traded for Frank Robinson in 1965, was to increase the percentage of Bantus attending Oriole games. It was estimated that about 1% of Oriole fans were black.</p>
<p>Guess what? The Orioles did a survey of their fan base several years later, and the percentage of Bantu fans was 1%.</p>
<p>So much for trying to increase the fan base of Bantus. </p>
