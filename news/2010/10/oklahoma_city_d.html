			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Megan Rolland, The Oklahoman, Oct. 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Concern over a new hip-hop curriculum that refers to the founding fathers as &#8220;old dead white men&#8221; has delayed the program&rsquo;s rollout for at-risk students, Oklahoma City Public Schools Superintendent Karl Springer said. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Known as Flocabulary, the program is a music-based educational tool that uses raps, rhythms and rhymes to help students learn and memorize everything from vocabulary and English to math and social studies. </p>
<p>About 15 teachers have complained or expressed concern about the rap song lyrics, said Ed Allen, president of the Oklahoma City American Federation of Teachers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just don&rsquo;t think we were real careful where we deployed it,&#8221; Allen said. &#8220;Not all parts of it are real affective for the more troubled youth.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is the U.S. history curriculum that has raised concern. </p>
<p>One of the rap songs  &mdash;  &#8220;Old Dead White Men&#8221;  &mdash;  chronicles the shortcomings of the early leaders in the United States.</p>
<p>Of President James Monroe&rsquo;s tenure, the rap says: &#8220;White men getting richer than Enron./ They stepping on Indians, women and blacks./ Era of Good Feeling doesn&rsquo;t come with the facts.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s followed up by an assessment of President Andrew Jackson&rsquo;s checkered dealings with American Indians.</p>
<p>&#8220;Andrew Jackson, thinks he&rsquo;s a tough guy./ Killing more Indians than there are stars in the sky./ Evil wars of Florida killing the Seminoles./ Saying hello, putting Creek in the hell holes./ Like Adolf Hitler he had the final solution./ &#8216;No, Indians, I don&rsquo;t want you to live here anymore.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Flocabulary CEO and co-founder Alex Rappaport said the lyrics are made intentionally provocative and sometimes humorous to create student engagement among some of the toughest-to-reach students in the nation. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Flocabulary is not used as a core textbook but rather as supplemental material that highlights certain academic standards and background knowledge. The rap songs also come with a corresponding guidebook that breaks down the lyrics line by line to explain what they mean.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Oklahoma City School District has spent about $10,000 so far on the music and corresponding textbooks, Springer said. The Oklahoma City School Board authorized the district to spend up to $97,000 in federal funds on the program.</p>

		<p>Speaking from the perspective of a man over fifty, the two biggest failures (Vietnam being the yardstick)I have ever seen are the war on drugs and the various &#8220;Headstart&#8221; programs if you will&hellip;<br>
Just the other day I was at a dinner where the speaker told of a &#8220;pioneer&#8221; in the wealthy community who finally &#8220;got it.&#8221; By got it he meant theat they finally turned their charity millions away from the arts and toward the poor. And I sat think fuming thinking she didn`t get it, she blew it!! To turn your efforts toward something that would last generations to  something that fails within sight of a semester or two. You think these people would spend it with the same acumen they had getting it&hellip;</p>

		<p>The hip hop curriculum stuff gets worse.  I work around it and it is no more than dressed up dancing and gym class for ADD voodoos.</p>
<p>Seriously, if it were such a good program, shouldn&rsquo;t they be doing this in white suburban schools?  But you could never, ever, in your life imagine white parents, even liberal multiculturalists, sending their kids to classrooms where they rap and dance their algebra and world history.</p>
<p>This is another in a long line of &#8216;silver bullets&rsquo; that i supposed to bring &#8216;the light and love of learning; to those who come from traditions not known for high intellectual achievement.</p>
<p>Go on youtube and look up some of these rap &#8216;educational&rsquo; songs.  It is so sad you&rsquo;ll have to laugh.</p>

		<p>Just another reason to get your kids out of public school NOW! Just because this dubious program is used for &#8220;at risk&#8221; students does not mean they will not use it for kids who are not &#8220;at risk&#8221; sometime in the near future. Public schools are really good at sneaking garbage in the back door (in this case conservative Oklahoma caught them in the act) At first this sort of thing is relegated to kids whose parents are either not terribly interested in what is being taught to them or simply just dont care. As soon as there are no or relatively few complaints the garbage gets transferred to the regular classrooms. It is also shocking to find out which kid gets labled &#8220;at risk&#8221;- instead of the kids that immediatly come to mind- behavior problems, single parent homes, poverty ect- a child can be labled &#8220;at risk&#8221; if he or she comes from certain neigborhoods or just merely performs in a lackluster manner. </p>

		<p>Bottom line, how much public money is being wasted on this toxic program? Rappaport is really cashing in on stupidity, both on the part of the so-called &#8220;students&#8221; and the alleged &#8220;educators&#8221; buying in to this approach. There&rsquo;s a lot of money to be made in the industry of stupidity, just look around at popular culture, media, public discourse, etc. This story shows how new lows are being plumbed by people who supposedly went to college. If I&rsquo;d only known what a gravy train society&rsquo;s half-wits represented I could have gotten in on the action and become a millionaire by now.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;The rap songs also come with a corresponding guidebook that breaks down the lyrics line by line to explain what they mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>When you have to provide materials that explain material that only exists because it supposedly makes the core material easier to understand, a thinking person should come to the conclusion that perhaps the difficulty of the core material isn&rsquo;t the problem.</p>
<p>And aside from that, do you want surgeons that have to crip walk to remember what to do in an open heart surgery anyway?  I&rsquo;d rather he/she were able to absorb material from a book.</p>

		<p>Someone in the St. Louis Public Schools got the bright idea to tie mathematics education to rap (as &#8220;hip hop&#8221; was called in the late 1980s and early 1990s).  It was a huge flop.  Mainly because math is largely a cerebral and abstract discipline that doesn&rsquo;t fit well in a world of grammatical rhyme to the tune of heavy bass lines.</p>

		<p>Hmm, funny, none of those rap lyrics mention the fact that blacks kept slaves in Africa, that Indians waged war with each other here in America, that women were treated far better here than in, say, the Middle East, etc. When it comes to &#8220;creating student engagement,&#8221; it seems to be all about, &#8220;Whitey, he be so evil.&#8221;</p>

		<p>It is entirely logical and reasonable to see the teaching of such a bizarre and extreme curriculum as leading directly to the sort of race-based attacks on white people that we read about so often here on AmRen. When you teach that white people are the source of evil, then it&rsquo;s no surprise when these black kids act out.</p>
<p>This is an appalling example of multiculturalism at its worst. Personally, in principle, I have no hostility or animus towards black people - what I despise is this ideology which is in essence anti-white, anti-white civilization, anti-white families. Kudos to AmRen for continuing to expose the ongoing absurdities of the multicultural social engineering going on in Western countries. Sadly, I have the feeling that there are far more stories that we don&rsquo;t even hear about.</p>

		<p>Actually, I&rsquo;ve seen white women singing to their stroller babies in a public park I go to (albeit somewhat embarrassedly, one wonders what kind of criticism they face at home), exactly as the three stooges video above illustrates.</p>
<p>Once they get over themselves, the women are luminously beautiful and from the waving hands and smiling faces, I get the impression that the brats are really engaged by mom singing to them too.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the problem you see.</p>
<p>Mom singing self ordering phoneme combinants as precursors to what will become true, syllabic, understandings of basic ennunciation and vocabulary are the actions of PRE EDUCATIONAL learning.  Essentially opening very young children&rsquo;s minds with &#8216;driver&rsquo; level operating system compatibilities to actual speech.</p>
<p>But if X-ethnic doesn&rsquo;t sing to their kids because they aren&rsquo;t terribly articulate themselves, then it&rsquo;s likely too late for that kind of therapy to mean much by the time their youngsers reach proper school.  And certainly by the time they are learning about &#8216;Dead old white men&rsquo; as social studies driven history.</p>
<p>It may in fact be too late before they are even born.</p>
<p>Which is sadly ironic, particularly in the case of blacks whose rhythm ennunciation, memorization and improvisation skills are not inhibited at all.</p>
<p>But is still something that must be acknowledged in a pre-GE world that depends on a certain societal mass IQ effect to sustain itself and continue to advance.</p>
<p>Their group needs.  Or ours.  That&rsquo;s what it will always come down to in a world of shrinking resources and less empathy of attention.</p>

		<p>You folks are nicely indignant over the adoption and misapplication of this dubious teaching tool.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one more straw on the camel&rsquo;s load however.<br>
These &#8220;educational programs can cost a school system tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>I once worked at a long-term vegetable storage facility where the highest IQ was about 12 and the minimum, 2. (I think you get one point for a heartbeat and one for unassisted breathing.)<br>
This type of institution can get much more federal monies by calling itself a school as well as a medical facility.</p>
<p>There was a tape played almost continuously saying,&#8221;Lay-lay-lay, lee-lee-lee&#8221; and so on down through most long vowel sounds.<br>
The slugs were divided into 4 groups for this &#8220;education.&#8221; Some times the aids would argue about their turn to use the tape (in order to appear busy for the roaming supervisors who prowled in fairly predicatable patterns)</p>
<p>I asked them why they didn&rsquo;t make copies of the stupid tape. Incredibly they told me that making copies would be a copyright infringement which the facility would take no responsibility for, and that the employee would be charged with the crimes that VCR and DVD threaten you with at the beginnings of movies.</p>
<p>Simply buying another copy would cost tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>Oh, and I never once heard one of the &#8220;students&#8221; singing Lu-lu-lu.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;This new project should have about the same laughable results&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Tim:</p>
<p>Although it seems laughable, everyone needs to take this seriously, and deadly seriously.  The government likes to get &#8216;em young, start the brainwashing as early as possible, to make the Hate-White message hard, if not impossible to overturn.</p>
<p>I did not laugh when I read this: &#8220;One of the rap songs &mdash; &rsquo;Old Dead White Men&rsquo; &mdash; chronicles the shortcomings of the early leaders in the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a part of the current, blatant, overt, anti/hate-White curriculum, disseminated specifically to non-Whites, conditioning them to not only hate us but dehumanize us.</p>
<p>Dehumanizing us makes us easier to eliminate, which I believe is THE Prime Objective of our NWO leaders  &mdash;  as they allow the Rule of Law to breakdown, creating conditions to introduce more Government Force. </p>
<p>This does not bode well for us as our numbers continue to fall and non-White numbers continue to rise.</p>
<p>And, this type of curriculum IS seeping into government schools everywhere, little by little, drop by drop as the demographics of the schools change and any resistance from Whites is met with threats and name-calling.</p>
<p>For example: Last week, I wrote about part 1 of the new mandated textbooks I received for this school year.  Here is a little about Part 2, from your non-statist educator, I, Bon:</p>
<p>On the cover of Part II of Perspectives in Multicultural Literature, are three photos,   of Sandra Cisneros, Dr. Martin Luther King (I&rsquo;m writing it exactly as it appears on the book) and Amy Tan, as a &#8216;shot out&rsquo; to our growing Asian population in California.  On the inside cover is a photo of an angry black member of the armed forces in full military dress (implied message?  Yes, I believe).</p>
<p>The first selection is an essay on &#8216;persuasion&rsquo; written by none other than Gloria Allred, who is busy at the moment working for Moonbeam Brown by parading around Netmeg Whitman&rsquo;s hysterical Illegal Alien nanny all over the media.  I heard this morning that Moonbeam has shot ahead in the polls by 24 points over Nutmeg&hellip;.but I digress.</p>
<p>Other selections include:   MLK&rsquo;s &#8220;Declaration of Independence from the War on Vietnam&#8221;, about how monies used to fund the &#8216;problem&rsquo; in Vietnam should have been used to &#8216;lift poor blacks out of poverty.&rsquo; And that &#8216;more blacks were sent to die in Vietnam relative to their proportion of the population.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Wonder who wrote this for him, you can be sure that he didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Following that are  selections about Sojourner Truth and Susan B Anthony (to appease Feminazis), another entry (of three) by MLK, an article entitled &#8220;What the Future Holds for Farm Workers and Hispanics&#8221; by Cesar Chavez, &#8220;Latino Style&#8221;, and an interview with Alice Walker, from &#8220;A Communion of the Spirits:  African American Quilters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, you get the idea  &mdash;  the rest of the book contains literary &#8216;selections&rsquo; from other non-Whites such as Malcolm X, Langston Hughes, Amy Tan, Nikki Giovanni (see </p>
<p>There IS one selection from a White Male (some would say a Dead White Male):  William J. Clinton (as so listed):  &#8220;Remarks to the Convocation of the Church of Christ in God&#8221;, delivered &#8216;emotionally&rsquo; according to the preface, &#8216;to a group of African American bishops and ministers from the &#8216;pulpit where MLK jr. made his final speech.&rsquo;</p>
<p>LOL, what a fitting selection for Old Bill!  Crocodile tears and all!</p>
<p>This is the anti-White, victim message delivered to the mostly non-White students in the Late Great State of California.</p>
<p>Soon to come your way, </p>
<p>Bon</p>

		<p>Speaking of the &#8220;rap generation&#8221;</p>
<p>I came in contact with the rap generation recently while walking down town at lunch in my South Alabama city. I was approached by five young &#8220;gentlemen de colour&#8221; who wanted me to give them each a ten dollar bill, allegedly for food. </p>
<p>But well if you want MY money you have to earn it. The conversation went something like this.</p>
<p>GdC- Hey man, man, man, wait up ****, we gotta ask you a question. </p>
<p>Me. What question could you possibly have for me? I bet it involves money somehow?  </p>
<p>GdC- **** man we been caught a little short know what I&rsquo;m saying how about letting the man hold a Ham man ****.[Hamilton i.e. ten dollar bill]</p>
<p>Me. You want me to give you ten dollars?</p>
<p>GdC- Hell yeah man see be all be hongary man sh*t man you got plenty of money let the man hold a Ham man ****</p>
<p>Me. I&rsquo;ll tell you what you guys I will give each of you a ten dollar bill but first I&rsquo;m going to ask you three questions about who is on the bill and if any of you only get one of the questions correct each of you get a bill and if you get the bonus question you will get a fifty dollar bonus -But I&rsquo;m warning you now five minutes of my time no more get it?</p>
<p>GdC, Go ahead and ask the questions we all been to school we know what time it be ****</p>
<p>Me. Question number one. Who was Alexander Hamilton?</p>
<p>GdC After a brief huddle. &#8220;**** man he be a dead President man he wouldn&rsquo;t be on no G.D. bill man iffin he wasn&rsquo;t no dead President man now give us our money.</p>
<p>Me. Wrongo Bongo. He wasn&rsquo;t a President.</p>
<p>GdC. Look man **** don&rsquo;t you know **** man don&rsquo;t you listen to Dogg man [Snoop Doggy Dog] he wouldn&rsquo;t be on no G.D. bill ifin he wasn&rsquo;t no damn dead white President fool.</p>
<p>Me. Wrongo Bongo He was the First Secretary of the Treasury. Question two. Where was he born?</p>
<p>GdC. **** man we don&rsquo;t know what state he be from he probably from Philly man **** he was just born in the good old U.S. of A. now give us our G.D. money. </p>
<p>Me. Wrongo Bongo number two he wasn&rsquo;t born in the U.S.A.</p>
<p>GdC. What the f*** man he had to be born in the U.S.A. or he couldn&rsquo;t be elected man **** don&rsquo;t you know anything?</p>
<p>Me. [without getting into a discussion about the birthplace of our current President] He was born in the West Indies and his mother was a prostitute.</p>
<p>More huddling took place to see if the West Indies was somehow a part of Florida.</p>
<p>GdC. O.K. asks us another G.D. question feel me - we are starting to feel like you be playing us and we ain&rsquo;t liking it one bit know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>Me. Final question. How did he die?</p>
<p>GdC. **** man that&rsquo;s easy. He just got old and died man ****. Now you better give us our G.D. money.</p>
<p>Me. Sorry. No money for you he was killed in a duel with a gentleman by the name of Burr.</p>
<p>GdC. What&rsquo;s the damn bonus question then.</p>
<p>Me. What is different about the picture of Alexander Hamilton  from every other bill in circulation today other than the fact of course that Alexander Hamilton is the only one on the ten dollar bill? </p>
<p>GdC. This is some kind of trick question man **** there ain&rsquo;t no difference **** man now give us our G.D. money.</p>
<p>Me. Wrongo bongo number four. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed our conversation but I&rsquo;m late for lunch. Bye. </p>
<p>GdC. Wait up man what&rsquo;s the G.D. difference man ****.</p>
<p>Me. You had five minutes of my time no more. Bye.</p>
<p>MoMo</p>
<p><br>
{yes O.K. I know that some of you guys would want to kill me at the next convention if I didn&rsquo;t tell you - pull out your ten dollar bill - which way is Alexander facing? - The only other bill where the person faced to the left was Woodrow Wilson on a one hundred thousand dollar bill - circa 1933}         </p>

		<p>This goes far beyond sickening.  I remember seeing this whole thing on TV a while back, actually.  Strangely enough, Rappaport (ironic name, isn&rsquo;t it?) and the other guys who made this &#8220;Flocabulary,&#8221; where all white.  And they weren&rsquo;t Eminem white, no, they were middle class, educated white gentlemen.  Now, this makes one wonder, what in God&rsquo;s name were they doing making rap songs for school children, that defame our earliest presidents as &#8220;old dead white men&#8221; who went around killing Indians all day?  Motivated by greed, I suppose.  They saw an opportunity to make a quick buck, at the expense of black children who will be forced to digest this garbage, and those of us who must attend school with them.  Just imagine what this will do to the poor black community.  As if they haven&rsquo;t been exposed to enough radicalism, now they will taught, in SCHOOL, that our nation&rsquo;s history is a long, sad tale of the white man&rsquo;s greed.</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;Flocabulary CEO and co-founder Alex Rappaport said the lyrics are made intentionally provocative &hellip;to create student engagement&#8221; &hellip;</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure they are! And I&rsquo;m sure Mr. Rappaport knows exactly what he&rsquo;s doing. </p>
<p><i>&#8220;The Oklahoma City School Board authorized the district to spend up to $97,000 in federal funds on the program.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I wonder how much of that will go to Mr. Rappaport?</p>
