<h1>Now It&rsquo;s Halal Hairdressing: A Snip for Scottish Muslims</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Helen McArdle, The Herald (Glasgow), October 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With its frosted windows, CCTV cameras, and tightly monitored security entrance, it is going to be one of Aberdeen&rsquo;s most secretive business enterprises.</p>
<p>So, you could be forgiven for wondering if the shop has something to hide.</p>
<p>Well, it does  &mdash;  its customers. Or rather it is the customers who want to remain hidden. For this is Scotland&rsquo;s first &#8216;halal hairdressers&rsquo;  &mdash;  a beauty salon which conforms to the strict rules of Islam; a place were Muslim women who wear the veil or headscarf can be seen uncovered without the risk of the gaze of men.</p>
<p>Discreet Creative Hairdressing, scheduled to open in three weeks, is the brainchild of 21-year-old Mahida Iqbal and her husband of nine months, Fueb Mieh.</p>
<p>The salon will be a &#8216;man-free zone&rsquo;. The frosted windows will stop any inquisitive men passing by from gawping at the clients. No-one can get in without passing through a secure buzzer entry system with CCTV. All this means that the Muslim ladies who have come for a new hair-do can remove their headscarves safe in the knowledge that only other women can see them.</p>
<p>Iqbal hit on the idea when she began wearing the headscarf for the first time last year, although she credits her husband  &mdash;  a fellow entrepreneur who runs Indian takeaways  &mdash;  for coming up with the proposal.</p>
<p>&#8220;At first I was just going to open up a hair salon that was going to be ladies-only,&#8221; said Iqbal. &#8220;But then my husband suggested I should target the Muslim community because there isn&rsquo;t a salon yet in Aberdeen that provides these services.&#8221; She spoke to Muslim women who wanted a &#8216;halal&rsquo; service, but had nowhere to go. &#8220;So I used to go and do homers for the ladies, or they would come to my house.&#8221;</p>
<p>While there are other salons in Scotland which offer a ladies-only service, Iqbal wants to offer something geared to the needs of the Muslim community.</p>
<p>She said: &#8220;There are hair salons in Glasgow that are ladies-only, but not like our salon. Our salon is completely discreet, completely hidden from the public, from men, whereas the salons here, men still walk past and they can still see in or come in. Ours has a buzzer entry system, and we&rsquo;ve got CCTV so that we can see who&rsquo;s actually approaching the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can allow people in and if there is a man there then we won&rsquo;t let him in. And there&rsquo;s the window frosting as well. There&rsquo;s a big population in Aberdeen that are Muslim. There&rsquo;s Pakistani, Bengali, African, black American, Arabic  &mdash;  there&rsquo;s a very large Muslim community. And me myself, attending mosque and attending Muslim events, I&rsquo;ve got to know a lot of the Muslim ladies, so I&rsquo;m hoping to generate a lot of business by word of mouth.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, Iqbal is not content to stop at hair-styling alone. Her salon will be a haven to a whole range of the pampering needs for Muslim women, with a variety of specialist beauty techniques such as henna tattooing and facial threading  &mdash;  an ancient hair-removal technique  &mdash;  also on offer.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve got an African hair stylist because afro hair is different from European hair, so she&rsquo;s going to be doing braiding and taking care of African clients. We&rsquo;re going to have a make-up artist, a beautician, a nail technician, a henna artist, a threading specialist, and teeth whitening as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is somewhere where customers can feel comfortable, feel pampered and relaxed, knowing that no-one is going to come in and disturb them,&#8221; Iqbal added. &#8220;Muslim husbands can feel relaxed knowing that their wife is safe, where no man is going to be able to see them, and then they can come home and show their beauty. Muslim clients have never experienced this ever. It&rsquo;s a great feeling.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Entrepreneurship is a noble activity.  Serving the needs of one&rsquo;s community is a good thing.  Showing the West that women actually have different needs than men needs to be done.  The only thing wrong here is that muslims are in Scotland.  They should return to their countries of origin and uplift their own kind.  Why are they in Scotland?  Because Whites invited them.</p>

		<p>Actually this by no means a new idea. Everywhere in the Middle East there are salons, often Ladies and Men side by side, different doors but obviously part of the same establishment. Men have no need to avail themselves of a trim as the shop doubles as a waiting room for those collecting their wives. An excellent idea, especially when the summer temperature hovers around 40C (104F) and the humidity is 99%, that would ruin any new hairdo in seconds! As for waiting.. we&rsquo;ve all done it. &#8216;Darling, I&rsquo;ll be ready in 20 minutes, please pick me up outside&rsquo; Yeah&hellip; right!</p>

		<p>This is sort of funny. They said the salon would be &#8220;discreet&#8221; so men would not look in or come in. I thought, with the male dominated Muslim society, that&rsquo;s the last place they&rsquo;d want to be. Or is this concept all smoke and mirrors? I&rsquo;m sure that if they had the chance, these men(?) who demand women cover up from head to toe, would take the opportunity to peek if they could. <br>

		<p>A Scots Muslim is a contradiction in terms.  To be Scot is by nature to resist invasion by those pledging fealty to Allah.  Hell, it&rsquo;s to resist invasion.  The Romans under emperor Hadrian found out nearly 2,000 years ago how hard Scotty fights to defend his castle.  </p>

		<p>I agree with you flamethrower, however since they are in Scotland (and everywhere else for that matter) this is a good idea since it keeps the Muslims away from our women and beauty salons. Case in point- as a former Muslim I had Muslim friends of course and one lady wanted to get her hair fixed for Eid after Ramadan and her husband agreed- with stipulations. He had her call all the salons at the malls and ask if they could accomodate her &#8220;needs&#8221; as a covering Muslim woman. The demands were pretty tall and the layout of most of the salons did not lend themselves to helping her. She had to be kept in the back room of the salon so that passing men could not see her, only the girl working on her hair could see her without her hijab and niqab and her husband had to approve the hairstyle before she was allowed to have it done. Finally one salon that was part of a larger department store agreed to the ridiculous requests. They were inside the store and you would really have to look to find them so this was perfect for her. All went well until the husband came back to collect his wife. Her hair did not EXACTLY resemble the picture and he became very angry. The poor girls tried to explain that everyone&rsquo;s hair is different and the texture and thickness of hair make styles look slightly different. He began to rant and rave while his wife cried in embarassment. The hapless girls finally asked them to leave and he did so with his tearful wife in tow. To Muslims, beauty salons are somewhat on the par with adult bookstores or other sex related businesses and they rate anywhere from slightly naughty to downright raunchy. In other words, any place where women congregate is not suitable for decent people. </p>

		<p>I have a better idea: throw them all out of the USA and Europe, and they can have whatever types of hair salons they please back in their homelands. </p>
<p>Another thought: imagine the outcry if Christian whites ever had such a salon. Imagine the lawsuits, the nonsense. </p>
<p>Let the Muslims be Muslim, back where they belong, in their country of origin. </p>

		<p>Anonymous@ 11.35 is absolutely correct to assert that a &#8220;Scottish Muslim&#8221; is a contradiction in terms,He/She is wrong however to refer to the resistance of the Scots to the Emperor Hadrian.The Scots did not start settle in Britain until around 400AD,about the same time the English arrived from south Jutland.<br>
Hadrian&rsquo;s Wall was a barrier between two groups of Britons,or Welsh as we now call them.</p>
