			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Diane Macedo, Fox News, September 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A coalition of Mexican mayors has asked the United States to stop deporting illegal immigrants who have been convicted of serious crimes in the U.S. to Mexican border cities, saying the deportations are contributing to Mexican border violence.</p>
<p>The request was made at a recent San Diego conference in which the mayors of four Mexican border cities and one U.S. mayor, San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders, gathered to discuss cross-border issues.</p>
<p>Ciudad Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes blamed U.S. deportation policy for contributing to his city&rsquo;s violence, saying that of the 80,000 people deported to Juarez in the past three years, 28,000 had U.S. criminal records  &mdash;  including 7,000 convicted rapists and 2,000 convicted murderers.</p>
<p>Those criminal deportees, he said, have contributed to the violence in Juarez, which has reported more than 2,200 murders this year. Reyes and the other Mexican mayors said that when the U.S. deports criminals back to Mexico, it should fly them to their hometowns, not just bus them to the border.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement transports a majority of Mexican criminal aliens back to Mexico on buses. Since they&rsquo;re often held in U.S. detention centers near the border prior to deportation, busing them to Mexican border cities is much less expensive than flying them to the interior of the country.</p>
<p>Those convicted of crimes in the U.S. are required first to fulfill &#8220;any sentence imposed by the U.S. courts,&#8221; ICE spokeswoman Virginia Kice told FoxNews.com.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But if they don&rsquo;t have charges pending against them in Mexico, they are free men and women once they cross the border regardless of what they have done in the U.S.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And while criminal aliens continue to be repatriated to Mexico at other locations along the border, Kice said, &#8220;those removals are coordinated closely with Mexican authorities and advance notification is provided prior to the return of convicted violent offenders.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Critics of the Mexican lawmakers say the U.S. is prosecuting the criminals in question, and if Mexico wants to keep them out of its border towns, then it should be up to Mexico to lock them up or transport them elsewhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s almost perverse that foreign officials would blame us for sending their criminals back to their country. Sovereignty entails responsibility. This country needs to take responsibility for its own criminals, and other countries  &mdash;  Mexico included  &mdash;  need to take responsibility for their own criminals and deal with them,&#8221; Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, told FoxNews.com.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m so sorry, Mexican Mayors. I&rsquo;ve been moaning and complaining and writing letters to my elected officials for many years about sending illegals back home and I never once considered the burden that deporting criminals would put on you guys. How thoughtless of me. From now on I will advocate that we keep all of your criminals here in America where they can rape, pillage and murder without causing any inconvenience for you. </p>

These peaceful Mexicans come to America in search of a better life but once they cross the border, they&rsquo;re transformed into violent criminals.</p>
<p>Mexico should be the one demanding the border be closed to protect their own people from violent American culture.</p>

		<p>If this weren&rsquo;t so serious, it would be hilarious. If they&rsquo;re good at nothing else, Mexican officials are great at blaming others for their problems. I&rsquo;m sure the recent storms and mud slides are our fault too. It&rsquo;s comical to see what they&rsquo;ll come up with next. I&rsquo;m sure if the US weren&rsquo;t so close and caused so much inconvenience to that lovely country, all their citizens would be wealthy, college-educated home owners with no corruption or violence in their country. Sorry we&rsquo;re such a poor neighbor. Perhaps you&rsquo;d all better stay home and not mingle with us. We&rsquo;re such a poor influence.</p>

		<p>What these Mexican mayors are saying is: &#8220;When a Mexican criminal commits a crime in Mexico, it is America&rsquo;s fault and not Mexico&rsquo;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps these Mexican mayors could display some responsibility for the first time in their lives by asking the Mexican Federales to transport the Mexican criminals farther into Mexico in Mexican buses.</p>

		<p>The solution is simple. The government of the 14th wealtiest nation of the world (Mexico) should pay to transport these people home. </p>

		<p>&#8220;A coalition of Mexican mayors has asked the United States to stop deporting illegal immigrants who have been convicted of serious crimes in the U.S. to Mexican border cities, saying the deportations are contributing to Mexican border violence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, adding criminals to a population will obviously increase the crime and violence factor, however, the amount of crime these people add to the border regions is almost insignificant compared to the amount of drug violence that is rampant from Tijuana all the way across to the border with Brownsville, Texas.</p>
<p>Since the Border Patrol estimates that 10% of all illegal entries into the US are criminals&hellip;&hellip;and the rest economic refugees who migrate in order to live as parasites off our social programs&hellip;..I&rsquo;m wondering why the Mexicans and the corrupt UN&hellip;.. scream about our concerns over illegal immigration into our country.</p>
<p>That Mexico offers no benefits or jobs for their people, encouraging them to migrate to other countries, reveals the corruption rampant within that country.  Since Mexico is the richest nation of all the Latin countries, and there is a huge  division between the middle class and wealthy, and the poor, the world should repeatedly condemn them for refusing to take care of their own people.  Immigrants are the shame of Mexico that is never highlighted by the world press, as it should be.  </p>
<p>Too, have we heard much from the corrupt UN about Mexican social injustices?  We haven&rsquo;t, of course.  They would much rather cite the US for racism for not wanting to overburden its failing economy by taking on murderers, thieves, and economic parasites, to say nothing of their EXTREMELY high incidents of drunkenness and drunk driving.  </p>
<p>The UN seems to be ignorant of the fact that the people are being pushed out of their own country as a sort of pressure valve release in order to stem what would obviously develop into a revolution if they were forced to stay.  That&rsquo;s true of most of Latin America also.</p>
<p>Ironically, the revolutioin that is most likely to occur is the one that will be initiated by the drug cartels.  And that one is most likely less than a decade away.</p>
<p>As the economic situation in this country continues to worsen, which includes a currency crisis on top of everything else, there will be fewer and fewer peon jobs available.  If the illegal flow isn&rsquo;t stopped, will these millions of people turn to crime and overwhelm the systemn further by overcrowding the jails, courts and prisons to the point where only the most heinous crimes are prosecuted because of an overburden of the entire system?</p>
<p>Will the cartels soon move their operations and influence further than they are right now into the US?  How many of the illegals will they employ as &#8220;soldiers&#8221; as they do in Mexico right now where those like the Sinaloa Cartel control almost its entire state?</p>

		<p>This is one of the worst absurdities that the &#8220;Liberals&#8221; and their apprencices are perpetuating.</p>
<p>We are being invaded by Mexican bandits whom we did not invite here, yet we are supposed to be somehow responsible for their crimes.</p>
<p>One more reson why we need to seal the border with Mexico and deport every Mexican back to this incubator of criime, corruption, and insolvency. (Unless, we would like our country to become corrupt, crim-driven, and unslovent like them, or if you  wish that the U.S. falls apart or becomes a second-tier nation with no economic or military power.)</p>
<p>It has been a prevailing legal doctrine in the U.S. that a lawbreaker must never profit from his crime. Well, if the &#8220;Liberals&#8221; have their way, the Mexican bandits will profit from their crimes. They will, evenually, be offerd &#8220;path to citizenship&#8221; as deporting them back would be detrimental to Mexico, and, according to &#8220;Liberal&#8221; religion, one must not let people live &#8220;in the shadows&#8221;.</p>
<p>If, before deporting Mexicans, we coulddeport all these naturally-born &#8220;Liberals&#8221; somewhere then the future of the U.S. would be as bright as it was before LBJ drove the first nail to America&rsquo;s coffin.<br>

		<p>I agree with the Mexican officials that dumping their criminals  just across the border causes trouble  &mdash;  they are frequently back in the United States before the officials that dropped them off in Mexico are. I say let&rsquo;s save everybody the trouble by taking them out over international waters and dropping them, sans parachute, into the water from 1000 feet in the air. They will not commit crimes in the Mexican border states, nor will they re-enter the US illegally again. Problem solved. </p>
