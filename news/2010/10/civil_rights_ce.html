<h1>Civil Rights Center Apologizes to Scholar Over Armenian Genocide Charges</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Doylem, Sacramento Bee, September 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The storied Southern Poverty Law Center has agreed to formally apologize to a scholar it accused of being a Turkish agent because of his views on the long-ago slaughter of Armenians.</p>
<p>The public apology by the civil rights group ends a multimillion-dollar libel lawsuit filed by historian Guenter Lewy, author of the book &#8220;The Armenian Massacres in Ottoman Turkey: A Disputed Genocide.&#8221; The settlement does not, however, end a debate that still entangles lawmakers from regions with large Armenian-American populations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The settlement of the 2-year-old lawsuit includes a confidential financial payment to Lewy as well as a three-paragraph apology and retraction that the Southern Poverty Law Center will be making public within a week.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In its negotiated statement, the Alabama-based group said it &#8220;misunderstood&#8221; Lewy&rsquo;s scholarship and admitted it was &#8220;wrong to assume that any scholar who challenges the Armenian genocide narrative necessarily has been financially compromised by the government of Turkey.&#8221;</p>
<p>The organization further stated that it was &#8220;wrong to assert&#8221; that Lewy was part of a genocide-denying network financed by Turkey.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re very pleased with this,&#8221; David Saltzman, one of Lewy&rsquo;s attorneys, said in an interview Wednesday. &#8220;This shows it&rsquo;s possible for people like Guenter Lewy to research controversial topics and reach their conclusions.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An 87-year-old emeritus political science professor from the University of Massachusetts, Lewy concluded through his research that the murders and deportations of Armenians between 1915 and 1923 did not amount to a genocide. Lewy said in his extensively footnoted book that while many died, the Ottoman Empire&rsquo;s actions were not a premeditated effort to wipe out the Armenians.</p>
<p>Following 2005 publication of his book, Lewy was criticized sharply by Armenian-American activists. This was not unexpected. For years, questions of motivation and assertions of Turkish influence have shaped the Armenian genocide debate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Founded in 1971 and subsequently made famous by its work researching hate groups, the Southern Poverty Law Center entered the debate in 2008 with its Intelligence Report magazine. An article titled &#8220;State of Denial&#8221; enumerated Turkish lobbying and investment in academic think tanks, among other efforts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lewy is one of the most active members of a network of American scholars, influence peddlers and website operators, financed by hundreds of thousands of dollars each year from the government of Turkey, who promote the denial of the Armenian genocide,&#8221; the periodical stated.</p>
<p>Lewy said the assertions distressed him.</p>

		<p>Gunter Lewy is a distinguished scholar who has made it his task to investigate controversial historical issues and try to sort them out without choosing sides.  He does not go looking for monsters, so people who have are emotionally (or financially) committed to seeing things entirely as a matter of good guys and bad guys don&rsquo;t like his work.  </p>

		<p> It&rsquo;s good to see the Southern Poverty Law Center get its noggin handed to it for a change. It deserves many more such lawsuits, and here&rsquo;s hoping some of the other individuals and organizations it has maligned over the years will line up in lawyers&rsquo; offices to file them.</p>
<p> I personally believe that the Turkish massacres of Armenians do indeed amount to attempted genocide. Interesting, isn&rsquo;t it, that we can debate that matter until the cows come home, but if anyone expresses any doubts about Germany&rsquo;s massacres of Jews, they are immediately branded a &#8220;hater&#8221; and an &#8220;anti-Semite.&#8221;</p>
<p> Here&rsquo;s one other thing, while we&rsquo;re on the subject of genocide. The most heinous, and unreported, genocide attempted in the 20th Century was that of the Soviet Union under Stalin in 1932-33 when anywhere from 7 million to 11 million Ukrainians were deliberately starved to death, or massacred in their villages by the Red Army and the KGB, for resisting Stalin&rsquo;s attempts to collectivize the Ukraine&rsquo;s farms. Many people nowadays have never even heard of that one, and I&rsquo;ve never heard of a single Soviet official who was punished in any way for it. </p>

		<p>What is really telling here is that by involving itself in the Turkey-Armenia genocide question, the SPLC, by showing its hand that it thinks that there was a genocide, is putting itself into the direct line of fire of one of its competitors in the paranoia-industrial complex, the ADL.  The ADL thinks it wasn&rsquo;t genocide, mainly because they don&rsquo;t want to weaken the &#8220;value&#8221; of the particular act of genocide about which they most worry.</p>
<p>I predict open warfare between the ADL and SPLC starting sometime next year.  The pool of money available to all paranoia-industrial complex groups has been drying up in the aftermath of the Madoff scandal, and too many people with too few lifeboats on a sinking ship results in fighting over the lifeboats.</p>

		<p>When you have the photos and other tangible evidences, you have fairly good proof.  I have known a few Armenians in my life.  They certainly relate the experience of their people the way for example, Jewish victims of the Holocaust do.  I had a few concentration camp survivors as patients in Slovenia in the late 1990s.  These experiences have long lasting effects on a people.  Which is one reason why people who fake victimhood are rightly called out and villainized, like Palestinians, who choose their victimhood.</p>

		<p>I have to agree with both Wayne Eagle and Question Diversity on this topic.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Armenian and Ukrainian holocausts are far too marginalized, while what happened in the Third Reich is far too overly fixated on in this country and the West in general. In part, I think this is due to the fact that what the Nazis did to their victims was an intensely organized and industrialized act of genocide, thus a certain shock value is there. After all: sieges, deliberate famines, and the mass slaughter of human beings with conventional weapons, is as old as recorded history itself. However, with that said, it makes the other genocides no less atrocities; it also is a foreshadowing of what the Nazis would do in their camps that had not been seen in this century beforehand. Moreover, the chilling indifference toward the Turks&rsquo; and Stalin&rsquo;s victims by the West compounds this issue, and gave Hitler and his henchmen the idea that a similar artic apathy would apply to what they were planning and eventually did. </p>
<p>Remember, Hitler once observed: &ldquo;Who, after all, today speaks of the annihilation of the Armenians?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that said, I too am glad to see the sanctimonious advocates of a worldwide white genocide in the SPLC, finally get their behinds handed to them. And if as QD speculates, this leads to open warfare between them and the equally Red swine who makeup the ADL, so much the better  &mdash;  John PM!</p>

<p>So what it comes down to is the ADL vs. the SPLC slugged it out; and the ADL won. <br>
  <br>
But why this fuss anyway? One could ask:  Cui bono?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m drawn to this quote: &#8220;while many died, the Ottoman Empire&rsquo;s actions were not a premeditated effort to wipe out the Armenians&#8221;</p>
<p>As an aside, if &#8216;genocide&rsquo; is defined as an effort to wipe out a people down to the last man, then by that definition, no genocide occured in Europe during World War II either.  As far as I know, the Germans had no plans to extend their policies extra-territorially beyond Europe&rsquo;s boundaries.</p>
<p>It makes one think that the word genocide is used much like &#8216;racism&rsquo; - it&rsquo;s hard to pin down a genuine use.  </p>
<p>That said, anyone who hopes to see miscegenation turn the whole world into shades of brown is, in my opinion, an advocate of genocide against whites. </p>

In the late 1970&rsquo;s Armenians began to immigrate to the state of California.                                                  Some Armenian immigrants declared that the Southern California mountains reminded them of home.</p>
<p>The news sent fear down the necks of many law abiding local American citizens and home owners over the notion of having Communist immigrants set up enclaves in local areas already established as American communities where American&rsquo;s raised<br>
their children.</p>
<p>The statements made by Armenians regarding the supposed genocide was in actuallity a bluff made by Armenians and their sons<br>
who feared being assaulted by American locals over the ethnic cliques and gangs they were starting which at the time were at their infancy, their culture they intended to maintain, and the failed Communist political beliefs they still retained.</p>
<p>After Armenian immigrants began to grow in number in the quiet neighborhoods of Los Angeles which gave classic style to television shows like as Ozzy and Harriet and My Three Sons, Armenian men gained a reputation for knife fighting in small crowds and random car chases at noon.</p>
<p>These events, and the Central American immigration problem that followed compelled the middle class American family to leave their communities to areas within the state as well as to adjoining communities outside.</p>

		<p>Even though this is a win for the good guys and a loss for the SPLC, isn&rsquo;t the underlying message a bit anti-establishment? Lets say the scholar was an American who was accused of being a government agent. How could you sue for defamation? Aren&rsquo;t government agents the good guys?</p>

		<p>Turks hate everything Orthodox, rest assured. Rest assured. Even if a genocide didn&rsquo;t happen, depending on your definition, it was definitely attempted, desired by the people and no tears would be be shed by Turks for non-Muslims, even for non-Turk Muslims, just ask the Kurds. </p>

		<p>I guess the $PLC didn&rsquo;t know who they were dealing with when they tangled with the extremely ethno-centric, well-funded Armenian community.</p>
<p>Believe me, they are intelligent enough to use &#8216;victim status&rsquo; to get their way with the government and make sure they are not in any way associated with or labeled as White.</p>
<p>I should know, I am surrounded by Armenians in my area  &mdash;  they live, eat and breathe the Armenian genocide.  So much so that the local school district has now declared a &#8216;holiday&rsquo; in honor of the &#8216;millions of Armenians who perished at Turkish hands&rsquo;  &mdash;  replete with the usual school assemblies, special dances, songs and cultural events to honor this non-American group.  The local paper is full of breast-beating, denouncements of Turks, calls for recognition from the American and Turkish governments, and&hellip;&hellip;demands for reparations (which they&rsquo;ve received, but, like the blacks, it&rsquo;s never enough).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, try putting up a Christmas tree  or a string of lights at school and watch the fallout  &mdash;  you may be labeled a White Supremacist Nazi by the end of the school day  &mdash;  and you certainly will be remanded, in no uncertain terms, to remove (if not destroy) the offensive decor forthwith. </p>
<p>The Armenians are another hegemonic ethno-centric group (one of many, unfortunately) who believe we Americans should adapt to their culture and honor their traditions and culture in our schools and communities.</p>

<p>For outward consumption, the ADL and SPLC get along, going so far as to collaborate on a project every once in awhile.  But internally, they despise each other, the ADL despises the SPLC far more than the other way around.  The ADL has been around longer, and its leadership is fuming mad that this young Southern gentile pup in the person of Morris Dees comes along and hustles money from their people.  A dollar given to the SPLC is not a dollar given to the ADL, and vice versa.  So the ADL had to join the same hustle just to keep up.  That is, of course, not counting smaller analogues on a national and regional basis (e.g. Center for New Community) that have sprung up like weeds based on Dees&rsquo;s success.</p>
<p>Over the years, they&rsquo;ve been trying to one-up each other under the radar screen.  I think this Turkey-Armenia thing is a clue that the competition is about to go above ground.  Perhaps it will go so far as both groups adding the other to their list of extremist hate groups.</p>

		<p>The $PLC function has evolved right out of lefty liberal &#8220;good<br>
intentions&#8221; by such figures as the late Sen. Frank Church in the<br>
wake of Cointelpro revelations in the 70&rsquo;s.   FOIA was amended<br>
to permit excessive access by persons to their personal files in<br>
the FBI and other national security agencies.  Accordingly, information compiled by or &#8220;rat holed&#8221; with $PLC is immune to such disclosure.  $PLC, however, amounts to a huge corporate &#8220;informant&#8221; without effective handlers ( at least within the USA).Law enforcement will be seen historically as having been made the monkey inasmuch as any informant  &mdash;  whether a two bit hustler or a near billion dollar entity like $PLC  &mdash;  that dominates law enforcement is a professional insult.</p>

		<p>One question that has never been satisfactorily answered, but deserves honest discussion is this:<br>
Why would the Nazis go through the trouble of recording names, ethnicity, cultural affiliations and race of those they supposedly killed?  Why would they ship them to work camps?  Would it not have been easier just to round them up and perform the (evil)deed??<br>
This question is not intended to evoke any racial or cultural hatred.  It is asked in the spirit of scholarly discussion and deserves an honest answer.</p>

More than once I saw in the (now defunct ) Spotlight  conjectures<br>
that both organizations might be to a significant extent &#8220;shells&#8221; within which Mossad interests could be carried forth on American soil??  That there may be points of friction does not suggest the absence of a much more basic commonality. Dee$, however, may well be viewed within ADL (and $PLC??)  as having big time &#8220;loose cannon&#8221; potentials, as he doesn&rsquo;t seem to reckon long term consequences very well.  RICO fits $PLC like a tailored suit, as<br>
plenty of the members of the Society of Former FBI Agents keenly<br>
realize.  </p>

There were stories of young children and infants dying of starvation and in some cases their families were forced to cannibalize them in order to stay alive. </p>

<p>You might be on to something.  I&rsquo;ve always thought all along (or rather, dreamed in the plasma-heavy sense) of Morris Dees being led out of the Poverty Palace in handcuffs by FBI agents, because a U.S. Attorney filed charges of Federal wire and mail fraud.  I&rsquo;ve always thought those were the easiest sitting ducks on which to nail the SPLC.  However, if you have three &#8220;bad acts&#8221; within ten years, and some sort of demonstrable evidence of central coordination, then you have what you need for RICO.  Three provable acts of wire/mail fraud would fill the bill.  And an organization is almost sure not to survive a RICO conviction.</p>
