	<p>U.S. Hispanics outlive whites by more than two years and blacks by more than seven, according to the government&rsquo;s first calculation of Hispanic life expectancy.</p>
<p>The startling report released Wednesday is the strongest evidence yet of the &#8220;Hispanic paradox&#8221;  &mdash;  long life expectancy for a population that has a large share of poor, undereducated members. {snip}</p>
<p>A Hispanic born in 2006 could expect to live about 80 years and seven months, the government estimates. Life expectancy for a white is about 78, and for a black, just shy of 73 years.</p>
<p>Until recently, federal researchers didn&rsquo;t calculate life expectancy for Hispanics as a separate group; they were included among the black and white populations. The report is based on death certificates.</p>
<p>By breaking out the longer-living Hispanics, the life expectancies for non-Hispanic whites and blacks both declined slightly, said the report&rsquo;s author, Elizabeth Arias of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>

		<p>Our Government says that we need to import Mexicans because they will &#8220;save Social Security.&#8221;  But let&rsquo;s think about this a bit: First of all, most Mexican immigrants have little education and will work at low-paying jobs their entire lives.  Hence, they will pay little in Social Security taxes.  </p>
<p>When these millions of Mexican immigrants retire, not only will they suck up far, far more money than they paid into the system (further bankrupting it), but because they live longer, they will be an even greater burden on the system.</p>
<p>Notice that for 2 years now, there has been no cost-of-living increase for your grandparents or parents who are on Social Security.  </p>

<p>Well, this is a paradox that counfound all the cherished beliefs of the liberal, the lefty, the progressive, the &#8220;activist&#8221;, etc.</p>
<p>For the most part these are &#8220;poor&#8221; [whatever poor is] persons and are not supposed to live as long, much live longer, than the much pampered and privilged whitey. Whitey is not doing as well in this category as the &#8220;hispanic&#8221; and this is because of?</p>
<p>More health care for whitey, more hospitals and clinics for whitey, etc.</p>

		<p>Well, it&rsquo;s long been obvious that, pound for pound, there&rsquo;s nothing tougher than a Mexican.  I served with a lot of them on my first tour in Vietnam, and you&rsquo;d have a hard time killing one with a double-bitted axe.</p>

		<p> This study is worthless since Hispanic is not a race. What would really be nice is if they could break it down by country of origin. Like comparing the average life span of Haitians born here as opposed to Dominicans.From what I have read eighty five percent of  Dominicans are Mulatto. They do not consider them selves to be Black.</p>

<p>Blacks are famous for their poor diet and other unhealthy choices they make. Whites, arent much better, eating fast food, refined foods, sugared soft drinks, etc. Hispanics for the most part came from poverty and ate a simple whole foods diet, at least until they got here. It isnt hard to figure out why the numbers are what they are. Check out the life expectancy of future generations of hispanics, who will be much more inclined to eat at McDonalds and KFC on a regular basis than their parents and grandparents, who were more likely to eat bean products, whole grain tortilla&rsquo;s, etc.</p>

		<p>I find this article suspicious. Sorry, but I don&rsquo;t buy it, and I am surprised about all the commenters who are buying into it.</p>
<p>Since when do hispanics live longer than whites?  If the countries that they come from have lower life expectancies, don&rsquo;t more of you see this as suspect?  If they were saying Asians have the highest life expectancies, I would believe it.  But I just think that there is something really odd about this &#8220;research&#8221;.</p>
<p>There has to be a fork in all of this somewhere.</p>

		<p>If these statistics are accurate, just off the top of my head, I&rsquo;d say it has something to do with the benefits of eating lots of beans.  &#8220;Benefits&#8221; for those who eat them - not those around those who eat them!</p>

		<p>This could be because quite a few older immigrants put earlier dates of birth when getting their legal papers. This is a known trick in immigrant communities. Add to your age and get retired earlier. Same works for kids. Not uncommon to see 16 year old Asians claimed to be 11 years old to get benefits for parents and free schooling.</p>

		<p>The traditional Mexican diet de-emphasizes animal protein in favor of corn, beans, and rice.  <br>
 <br>
The &#8220;soul food&#8221; diet of blacks also does this.  Nevertheless, many blacks have become addicted to fast food, and empty calories. <br>
 <br>
In addition, homicide is a leading cause of death among young black men.   </p>

		<p>Fresh-off boat immigrants from third world countries stand to benefit from the cleanliness and quality of healthcare available in Western countries. By force of habit since childhood, it is unlikely they will gorge on junk food as much as natively born Americans.</p>
<p>All that will change within a generation or two. Already one finds Hispanic teenagers quite obese compared to their grandparents and also their white peers.</p>

<p>This is a very naive comment, as are many of the other comments on here.  I thought that people who posted on Amren would know better, but I guess not.</p>
<p>Seriously, it should be obvious that there is a fork in all of this research somewhere.  I think we need to think more along the lines of what &#8220;In Balto&#8221; proposes in his comment.  There was also something in the article about the possibility of hispanic immigrants going back home when they get ready to die.</p>
<p>Some of these ideas that some of you are coming up with are absurd.  Hispanics eat better than whites?  Okay, perhaps, but that is moot when you look at the fact that they have low life expectancies in their mother countries.  </p>
<p>And now someone is saying they have longer lifespans because they are related to Asians.  They are very very distantly related to Asians, as are Amerindians, and their societies are hardly at the same level of advancement.</p>
<p>Seriously people, the level of intellect has gone down a lot on here.  If someone did research stating that hispanics have higher IQs than whites, sure enough a good portion of you would believe that as well all of a sudden.</p>
<p>Please start educating yourselves and start having more pride in white people (your people).  The praising of Asians in place of whites on this website goes on a little too far as it is, and now more and more, I am seeing people praise hispanics, arabs, and Indians over whites.</p>
<p>Get a clue people.  But since this article says hispanics live longer than whites, I guess I should just let some of you attribute it to better genes and eating habits the way you are doing.  Why should I be surprised?  Nothing on this website surprises me anymore.<br>

		<p>Assuming the data is reliable, I wonder if any of the extended lifespan correlates to greater Vitamin D levels. </p>
<p>If Hispanics are working outdoors a lot (crop harvesting, roofing, etc.), they may have higher Vitamin D levels.  </p>
<p>Also, there is the &#8220;Latin factor&#8221; to take into account (Google &#8220;The Happy Planet Index.&#8221;) If it is true that some Hispanics maintain strong social ties (thus creating social capital for themselves), it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if they live a little longer.  (The Blue Zones also touches upon this concept.)  </p>

<p><br>
Asians live longer not because of their genes, but because they eat healthier, and they have a different way of live and a different view of the world; they deal with stress differently.<br>

<p>  &mdash;  Centers for Disease Control, 2010</p>
<p>Despite their youth, Hispanics are in relatively poor health&hellip;. are three times more likely than whites to die of AIDS, and four times more likely to die of tuberculosis.. a high rate of death from cirrhosis of the liver is an indicator of alcohol problems. Mexican adults ages 18-64 are 90 percent more likely than whites to have untreated cavities.</p>

<p>The risk of diabetes for Mexican Americans is almost twice that for Whites&hellip;.Diabetes tends to strike Hispanics at younger ages than the non-Hispanic white population. California had the highest rate</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</p>
<p>Hispanic women&rsquo;s heart disease risk is comparable to the heart disease risk level of Caucasian women who are about a decade older.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Medical News Today</p>
<p>Mexican Americans, who make up the largest share of the U.S. Hispanic population, suffer in greater percentages than Whites from overweight and obesity, two of the leading risk factors for heart disease. Premature death was higher for Hispanics (23.5%) than non-Hispanics (16.5%).</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Office of Minority Health</p>
<p>I too am extremely suspicious of the figures in the above article.</p>
<p>When I drive through the hispanic community, I notice bill boards for Ramen Noodles, which I understand have replaced rice, beans and corn in the hispanic diet.  I also notice that (at least in the schools) hispanics eat copious amounts of fast food, salty chips, candy and drink gallons of soda and sugar-blasted energy drinks.  Many many hispanic children, including very young children are morbidly obese.</p>
<p>The school lunches are often thrown in the trash, especially the milk, fruit and vegetables.</p>

Don&rsquo;t play the &#8220;bigotry&#8221; card with me. To me, being hateful to other races, consists of wishing for their extermination or stating that they shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to practice their cultures in their own countries etc&hellip;.That is hardly who I am, so don&rsquo;t you dare accuse me of that.</p>
<p>I believe God made all races, and that the diversity of the world is beautiful.  But I also think white people deserve their own countries so they can thrive just like everyone else.</p>
<p>Having said that, I am also a person of facts.  If the facts show that hispanic countries overall are less healthy compared to white countries when it comes to life expectancy, of course I am going to question an article like this.  </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you dare accuse me of bigotry, when white people are constantly ridiculed by the media in our own countries, which is all the more reason for me to question an article of this nature.</p>

<p>I used to believe the makeup of human species on this planet was hispanic, white, black and yellow. I was corrected by a PHD caliber person who informed me that the human race was made up of white, yellow and black. Anyone who is not Caucasian, African or Asian is a mixture of one or more of the three. <br>

		<p> Hispanics are more overweight than whites in the U.S.-and by the way, Mexico is the second fattest country in the world (U.S.A, U.S.A!). They smoke at about the same rates as us, and must be far less likely to have health insurance; this is quite a mystery. </p>
<p>I very, very tentatively suggest that they may just be a hearty people based on the fact that average lifespans in Mexico are almost exactly the same as those in the much-richer and less-violent U.S.</p>

		<p>This is nothing but a crock.</p>
<p>Hispanics have the HIGHEST DEATH RATES - even higher than Blacks - from motor vehicles in the under 35 years of age class.  This brings the overall average lifespan of an average Hispanic way down.  They drive recklessly and they have the statistics to prove it.  These stats are obviously meant to &#8220;uplift&#8221; Hispanics into a role previously held by Whites.  I think it&rsquo;s an attempt to make their light brown skin - &#8220;The New White&#8221;.</p>

		<p>From Tony Soprano: &#8220;This study is worthless since Hispanic is not a race.&#8221;  Good for you.  I have always questioned the designation &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; as I did when I sent back my uncompleted census form with a handwritten note, and when the poor census worker had to come to my home and listen to my rant.  If I change my name to a Spanish (or Spanish-sounding) one, does that make me &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; or &#8220;Latino?&#8221;  Or, if I say I speak Spanish, does that make me either?  Doesn&rsquo;t change my DNA, my lifestyle or my neighborhood, each of which have an effect on my longevity.</p>
