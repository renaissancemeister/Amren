<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The homecoming pep rally Friday at Kewaunee High School will have extra drama this year: Everyone in town will learn whether they&rsquo;ll be rooting for the River Bandits or the Storm to beat the Valders Vikings in the big football game.</p>
<p>The selection of a new nickname is the culmination of a sometimes painful few months in this town of 2,745. Under a new state law meant to eliminate race-based nicknames, logos and mascots, a complaint prompted the Kewaunee School District to drop the &#8220;Indians&#8221; name that had been in use here since 1936.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Law first of its kind</b></p>
<p>A state law that took effect in May allows school district residents to lodge complaints against race-based names. The Department of Public Instruction holds a hearing before the state superintendent decides whether to bar the usage. Districts can argue that a name isn&rsquo;t discriminatory if they have a tribe&rsquo;s approval.</p>
<p>In June, retired Kewaunee teacher Marsha Beggs Brown filed a complaint. The Kewaunee School Board intended to fight it, says President Brian Vogeltanz, but changed its mind on the eve of the hearing and decided to voluntarily drop the name. The district has a year to remove Indians signs from school premises.</p>
<p>&#8220;Respect for all people  &mdash;  that was my motivation,&#8221; says Beggs Brown. &#8220;There&rsquo;s just no refuting that these names harm children.&#8221; Some people here support her decision, she says, but &#8220;I&rsquo;ve also gotten a couple of anonymous letters and anonymous phone calls, and there are people who don&rsquo;t speak to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} Wisconsin&rsquo;s law is the first of its kind.</p>
<p>Department of Public Instruction spokesman Patrick Gaspar says it has received three complaints. Osseo-Fairchild schools were ordered to drop their Chieftains nickname. A complaint against the Mukwonago Chieftains is pending. There&rsquo;s been no complaint in Auburndale, but it is forming a committee to look into changing its Apache nickname.</p>
<p>Last week Kewaunee defeated the Mishicot Indians. Mishicot has permission from Michigan&rsquo;s Hannahville Potawatomi to use the name because the town is named for a chief from that tribe.</p>
<p>Barbara Munson, chair of a Wisconsin Indian Education Association task force on mascots and logos, says about 30 school districts use Indian names and about 30 dropped them voluntarily. The issue, she says, &#8220;is a failure of mainstream American culture to deal with stereotyping.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Mixed reaction</b></p>
<p>Jesse Steinfeldt, an Indiana University psychology professor who has studied the effects of the nicknames and mascots, says they create &#8220;a racially hostile education environment that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. can affect the self-esteem of Native American kids.&#8221;</p>
<p>Councilman Brandon Stevens of the Oneida Nation, the tribe closest to Kewaunee, wishes the Legislature had banned all Indian nicknames. But, he says, &#8220;as long as there&rsquo;s debate, there&rsquo;s an avenue for education.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Ignorant people. Retired spinster school teachers are the worst. Still looking to discipline the public by shoving their misplaced morals down your throat. Given democratic concensus, I don&rsquo;t understand why &#8220;one&#8221; can over rule all.</p>

		<p>As a direct descendant of Vikings, I for one am glad to see this; as I am sick of seeing the &#8216;ethnic&rsquo; crowd having the effontry to call themselves by that venerated title. Someone in Valders Wisconcin could do us all a favor and turn the tables on this kind of thing; it is time to start playing the &#8216;race card&rsquo; ourselves.<br>
How much does it cost for a school system to repaint and acquire new signage, not to mention uniforms, book covers and the countless other wastes of taxpayer money?</p>
<p>Or would our case simply be laughed at and thrown out because we do not qualify for &#8216;protected&rsquo; status within the nation our forefathers fought and died to create.</p>

		<p>Perhaps someone should complain about the Valder&rsquo;s Vikings. There are probably more people in Wisconsin with Scandinavian blood than Native Americans. But then, I doubt that a single white resident of the state ever thought to be offended by it. Something about having a sense of humor, a job, better things to do, etc.</p>

		<p>At last, those white bigots in Madison are willing to hear the grievances of Wisconsinites intimidated by offensive imagery!</p>
<p>Look, Amrenners. I&rsquo;m one quarter badger. They are good, clean, and decent creatures looking for nothing but to thrive in the upper midwestern wilderness without being reduced to an offensive caricature by the racist University of Wisconsin at Madison. </p>

		<p>we have another school up this way whose nickname is the nimrods(which means mighty warrior by the way) but nobody complaining about that one yet. I guess indans are the only people that had chiefs,tribes and warriors. I could see if the mascots were being shown as weak,bumbling fools but that is hardly the case. They are portrayed as strong,not as weak and that is hardly derogatory. And how about those damn fighting Irish, I&rsquo;m soooo hurt.</p>

		<p>Once upon a time the flagship station of the Kansas City Chiefs asked American Indian listeners to stop by their booth located in the Arrowhead Stadium parking lot before a game to voice their opinion on the Chiefs nickname.  One guy stopped by who said he was an American Indian.  He said it did no bother him at all that the Kansas City football franchise was nicknamed the Chiefs.  He was the only American Indian to stop by.  </p>
<p>By the way, the Kansas City Chiefs are not named after American Indians. The mayor who was a key player in getting the franchise moved to Kansas City was named Roe Bartle.  His nickname was &#8220;The Chief&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Oh, ignorant me. I thought that naming a team after someone/something was actually a way of respecting what was supposed to be noble, capable and good. Would you name a team after a skunk or a maggot? Not an image anyone holds in high esteem. But what do I know&hellip; I operate on the old fashioned common sense philosophy.</p>

		<p>Eastern Michigan used to be known as the Hurons.  Some liberals decided the nickname was offensive to American Indians. They insisted the nickname needed to be changed.  Hearing about the coming nickname change the chief of the Huron tribe traveled to Michigan to tell Eastern Michigan the tribe liked the school using the tribe&rsquo;s name as a nickname. The chief&rsquo;s and tribe&rsquo;s wishes were ignored and Eastern Michigan became known as the Eagles.</p>

		<p>10  &mdash;  MS wrote at 10:00 AM on October 8 Is 100% correct.  I would dare say this is the case a majority of the time.  The culture represented by the mascot is rarely offended, but the pathetic guilt ridden white liberal is.</p>
<p>This has been an on going issue in WI for decades.  For the most part schools refused to cave citing history and tradition.  Only recently has the selfish liberal ignored the wishes of the majority (typical) and forced compliance through bully legislation.  </p>
<p>All Scandinavian decendants of the area must INSIST that the MN Vikings must change their nickname.  Afterall, don&rsquo;t the football Vikings portray ALL Scandinavians as brutal barbarians?<br>
Irish decendants must isist the same of Norte Dame!</p>
<p>BTW, as a lifelong resisdent of the WI northwoods (and dern proud of it) WI is not a blue state!  What makes it blue?  Ultra-liberal Madison and ghetto Milwaukee.  Not the bulk of it&rsquo;s proud blue collar citizens!</p>

		<p>How can the word killjoys cry foul when the root word isn&rsquo;t even an Indian (no PC for me!) word. Chief derives from French and Latin.</p>
<p>From Dictionary.com&hellip;</p>
<p>Word Origin &amp; History </p>
<p>chief </p>
<p>c.1300 (n. and adj.), from O.Fr. chief  &#8220;leader, ruler, head&#8221; (of something), from L.L. capum,  from L. caput  &#8220;head&#8221; (see head). Online Etymology Dictionary, © 2010 Douglas Harper <br>
Cite This Source.</p>
<p>The word &#8220;chef&#8221; derives from the same root, because a &#8220;chef&#8221; is the &#8220;chief&#8221; of the cooks/kitchen.<br>
Warrior too.</p>
<p>Word Origin &amp; History </p>
<p>warrior </p>
<p>c.1300, from O.N.Fr. werreieor  (O.Fr. guerreor ) &#8220;a warrior, one who wages war,&#8221; from werreier  &#8220;wage war,&#8221; from werre  (see war). Online Etymology Dictionary, © 2010 Douglas Harper </p>

Etymologies aside, how can Native Americans claim to have the only legitimate emotional connections to Indian names?<br>
I grew up in the Midwest where arrowheads can be found lying on the ground waiting for a sharp eye. Much of my time was spent daydreaming about the lives, habits and hardships of these vanished peoples. This became part of MY life and heritage. Homage, NOT ridicule, was reflected in the choice of local teams&rsquo; names. Many of our cities and geographic areas have names based on historic Indian words. The spirit of such words helps  us retain a conscious bond toward those people. Eliminating these words strangles our.thoughts and connections.<br>
Do they(activists) really wish that people stifle their thoughts of the Natives?<br>
In time, our outlooks will be so sanitized that no one thinks about Indians at all!<br>
Ironically, these groups are, in effect, promoting the very same genocide that Whites are accused of.</p>
<p>I lived nearby the famous Dickson Mounds in Illinois I often think of a particular grave. A man and woman were buried together, indicating some type of contagion, with the man and woman face up man on bottom with his arms crossed over the ribcage of the woman. (If you&rsquo;re sentimental you can sniffle here.)<br>
Now the display is closed due to an Indian activist named Haney. No one will wax romantic over this grave ever again. In fact, they may never think of the Indians at all. Way to go Michael!</p>
