<h1><a href="http://www.numbersusa.com/content/news/october-6-2010/mexico-build-southern-border-fence.html">Mexico to Build Southern Border Fence</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>NumbersUSA, October 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mexico, which often criticizes the American government for putting up barriers which restrict the flow of illegal immigrants across the U.S.-Mexico border is building a fence of its own along its southern border with Guatemala.</p>
<p>It has been reported that the head of the Mexican Superintendency of Tax Administration, Raul Diaz, confirmed that the Mexican government is building a wall along the Mexican-Guatemalan border. Diaz stated the official reason for building the border wall is to stop illegal drugs from coming into Mexico, but Diaz did admit that it could also prevent the free passage of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>The hypocrisy of Mexico&rsquo;s actions has not been lost on American politicians. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} &#8220;While the hypocrisy of the Mexican government is offensive,&#8221; said NumbersUSA President Roy Beck, &#8220;Americans can cheer the Mexican fence which should greatly reduce the number of non-Mexicans illegally crossing the U.S. southern border.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I fully support Mexico building a fence.  The fence will reduce the number of Central and South Americans going through Mexico to get the United States and Canada.  The place where I worked replaced the white cleaning staff with a Central American cleaning staff in one day.</p>

		<p>Actually I can feel some sympathy for illegal aliens from Central America. In the historical/political sense of the word, a plausible argument can be advanced that they in their current situation are the byproduct of the ongoing US Chamber of Commerce intervention in Central American affairs since the days of Teddy Roosevelt. How do you think that the term &#8220;Banana Republic&#8221; came about anyway?? </p>
<p>No so however in the case of Mexico, a country that has vigorously defended its sovereignty against Yanqui Capitalist intervention since the post War of Northern Aggresion era of this country.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a difference - Mexicans aren&rsquo;t worried about Guatemalans from voting in their elections. Here, politicians have to pander to Mexico because a large % of their people that vote here.They vote mainly on &#8220;if you are for amnesty, I&rsquo;ll vote for you&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mexico is a sovern country just like ours used to be some years back. There are so many of them here now, they control this issue within our country (if you can call it so). </p>
<p>Oh, you white people in lily white states who vote democratic, your day is going to come - they will swarm into your neighborhoods in the coming years. Stay tuned. </p>

		<p>Mexico building a fence to keep illegal drugs from being brought INTO their country? That is certainly laughable on so many levels, I won&rsquo;t waste the space on AmRen. I hope they do! Only as a barrier to keep THEM out of OUR country!</p>

		<p>Jay - not only can we send money to Mexico to help them build it, we could also send a ton of day laborers down there to give them a hand.   This plan is beginning to look up!</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re more Mexican than you think! Guatemala actually used to be part of Mexico. In the colonial period it was part of New Spain (mexico),then after independence became part of the mexican &#8220;empire&#8221; during the short reign of &#8220;emperor&#8221; Agustin de Iturbide. Guatemala broke away in 1823, but Mexico doesn&rsquo;t see too anxious to reclaim it. </p>

<p>  &mdash;  underdog</p>
<p>Underdog:</p>
<p>I thought you might like this quote from General Smedley Butler, USMC, two time Medal of honor recipient (as quoted in &#8220;War is a Racket&#8221;):</p>
<p><i>I do not believe that the purpose of the military  is to make the world safe for United Fruit!</i> </p>
<p><br>
Gen Smedley also stated (in 1935):  &#8220;I helped make Mexico, especially Tampico, safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefits of Wall Street. The  I helped purify Nicaragua for the international banking house of Brown Brothers in 1909-1912 . I brought light to the Dominican Republic for American sugar interests in 1916. In China I helped to see to it that Standard Oil went its way unmolested.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, most importantly, The General stated this: &#8220;There are only two things we should fight for. One is the defense of our homes and the other is the Bill of Rights. War for any other reason is simply a racket .&#8221; </p>

<p>Amen.</p>
<p>And Godspeed to the Mexicans to build the Southern Fence, because as #3 Anon writes: &#8220;The fence will reduce the number of Central and South Americans going through Mexico to get the United States and Canada.&#8221;</p>
<p>We are flooded with Central Americans here in California, many of whom do not know how how to read or write in Spanish, English or any known language  &mdash;  and then there is that &#8216;brain worm&rsquo; that they&rsquo;re importing as well&hellip;</p>

		<p>The fence is nothing more than an attempt to prevent competition in the drug and illegals trade. Mexico wants a complete monopoly on these commodities going into the US&hellip;</p>

		<p>We should look upon double standards as demonstrated by Mexico&rsquo;s government in this matter as an opportunity to constructively reduce our nuclear arsenal.</p>
