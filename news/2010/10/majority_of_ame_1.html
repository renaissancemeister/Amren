<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A recent Rasmussen poll found that 62 percent (up six points from October 2009) of likely U.S. voters believe that federal policies are actually encouraging illegal immigration, only 23 percent disagree, with another 16 percent not sure.</p>
<p>That same poll found that 63 percent (up four points from July 2010) of voters favor passage of an immigration law similar to Arizona&rsquo;s SB1070 in their own state, while only 26 percent would oppose such a law.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s see:  In ten years we placed a man on the moon.  In 4 years we built 2,000 ships and submarines, 50,000 airplanes, &amp; 30,000 tanks and beat both Japan and Germany.  In 5 years we built the interstate highway system.</p>
<p>Yet in 20 years the USA is incapable of either building a simple border fence or enforcing immigrating laws?</p>
<p>And you expect me to believe that our government is serious about controlling illegal immigration?</p>

		<p>Is it not obvious that the federal government is encouraging illegal immigration? Is the treasonous behaviour of our statesmen not readily apparent?</p>
<p>To begin with, one need only have observed the Arizona affair to witness the animosity the federal government has for any state which attempts to enforce the illegal immigration laws already in effect, whose duty to enforce SHOULD belong to the federal government. The fact that the government threatened to sue Arizona and any state which attempted to follow it only alluded to the fact that our political leadership plans to legally abolish immigration enforcement (from the third world, at least) at some future date.</p>
<p>If that is not enough to convince the average individual, then we may listen to our immigration enforcement agencies, namely ICE, whose agents have repeatedly complained (for years) about the lack of support from their leadership in terms of enforcing illegal immigration laws.</p>
<p>Lastly, the demographic trends in this country did not originate by chance, but by concerted effort. The eagerly anticipated &#8220;white minority&#8221; status would not be possible without the aid and support of the federal government.</p>

<p>As I always like to play this numbers game, I say split that undecided 16% for what the real total might be. That would mean that about 70% of the country&rsquo;s population sees the truth, while 30% is living in some hallucinatory mind-gutter of utopian fantasy. Not bad, when you really think about it in conjunction with our current racial demographics.</p>
<p>Moreover, this majority is rejecting the dictated multicultural paradigm, that the deranged elites cling to along with their copies of Das Kapital. </p>
<p>Interesting times, to say the very least!</p>

		<p>With numbers like this, I have a feeling a future presidential campaign is going to be very interesting indeed! </p>
<p>Maybe not the next one, but it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before candidates start capitalizing on numbers like this. </p>
<p>I know the republican party is the stupid party, but there&rsquo;s got to be some smart candidates (or sufficiently desperate ones) who see that the way to differentiate themselves from the pack is by appealing to the majority of voters who want immigration brought under control. </p>
<p>Once one or two candidates work up the courage to face this issue squarely it could open up the floodgates  &mdash;  not of immigration but of honest opposition to it. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a matter of time.</p>

		<p>If most Americans think that the Feds are encouraging illegal immigration with a de facto amnesty and open border policy by means of non-enforcement, then it stands to reason that most Arizona legislators who passed SB 1070 also know this.</p>
<p>A regular poster here at AR made the contention that I now agree with, because I read SB 1070 a second time and did some internet research   &mdash;   The contention is that 1070 wasn&rsquo;t meant to haul in every ole Juan and Jose and Carlos that happens to be here illegally.  AZ legislators know full well that ICE wouldn&rsquo;t process any ole Juan or Jose or Carlos that their state&rsquo;s cops would catch.  That is because amnesty via non-enforcement has been going on since LBJ, (Reagan&rsquo;s first term was the only time period when it wasn&rsquo;t as bad.  But then his second term and the 1986 legal amnesty, and it returned), and AZ&rsquo;s politicians know it.  </p>
<p>1070 was designed for cops to catch illegals with 100 kilos of weed in the trunk, 20 underage girls kidnapped from Central America cram jammed in the van, or boxes full of terrorist-style ordinance and fake IDs hidden in the truck.  ICE might not care about the regular ole Juan or Carlos, but DEA is interested in the weed, HHS in the underage girls, and HLS in the terrorist material.</p>

<p>That is really funny, considering that almost 20% of the USA population consists of immigrants.  Hence, even immigrants believe that the government is encouraging illegal immigration!</p>

		<p>What the government needs to say to all of the families that were here in 1968 is this:</p>
<p>Thanks for fighting our wars and building our country.  We are going to reward you by displacing you with a bunch of immigrants from all over the world.  If you happen to be white, we will further reward you by legally discriminating against you with our Affirmative Action programs.</p>
<p>If you want to keep you super majority status of 90% (1970), or 80% (1990), or 67% (2010), then you need to have a lot of kids to offset our immigration on steriods policy.  (Of course then the country will become an overpopulated hell hole! (lol))&hellip;.So either way you lose:  (1) Get displaced, or (2) Over populate the country. (lol..lol&hellip;lol)</p>
<p>Thanks for your votes all these years, suckers&hellip;.</p>
