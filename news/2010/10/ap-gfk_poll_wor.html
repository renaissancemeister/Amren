<h1><a href="https://apnews.myway.com/article/20101006/D9IM5PT80.html">AP-GfK Poll: Working-Class Whites Shun Dems</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alan Fram, My Way News, October 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Desperate for jobs and cool toward President Barack Obama, working-class whites are flocking to Republicans, turning a group long wary of Democrats into an even bigger impediment to the party&rsquo;s drive to keep control of Congress.</p>
<p>An Associated Press-GfK poll shows whites without four-year college degrees preferring GOP candidates by twice the margin of the last two elections, when Democrats made significant gains in the House and Senate. The poll, conducted last month, found this group favoring GOP hopefuls 58 percent to 36 percent  &mdash;  a whopping 22 percentage-point gap.</p>
<p>In 2008, when Obama won the presidency, they favored GOP congressional candidates by 11 percentage points, according to exit polls of voters. When Democrats won the House and Senate in 2006, the Republican edge was 9 percentage points.</p>
<p>Compared with better-educated whites, working-class whites tend to be older and more conservative  &mdash;  groups that traditionally lean Republican and are uneasy with the young president&rsquo;s activist governing. Their wariness is reinforced by a prolonged economic funk that has disproportionately hurt the working class and shown scant signs of improvement under Obama and Congress&rsquo; majority Democrats.</p>
<p>Though accustomed to trailing among working-class whites, Democrats can hardly afford further erosion from a group that accounts for about 4 in 10 voters nationally. Their GOP preference is in contrast to whites with college degrees, who the AP-GfK Poll shows are split evenly between the two parties&rsquo; candidates, and to minorities, who decisively back Democrats.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>They are likelier than better-educated whites to dislike Obama personally and are more negative about his leadership. Over half say he doesn&rsquo;t understand ordinary Americans&rsquo; problems. They are also likelier to disapprove of Obama&rsquo;s performance as president, including more than two-thirds who are unhappy with his stewardship of the economy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To appeal to them, Obama has used nationally televised chats in people&rsquo;s backyards to emphasize his efforts to lift the economy. {snip}</p>

		<p>Though I do not agree with either political parties (both are heavily corrupted IMO), this has always been a weak point for democrats. Though they may appeal to minorities and a handful of whites, they are quickly losing ground amongst the general Euro-American population as they stray farther and farther away from being blue-dog, to being San Francisco liberal to who the interests of a utopian global ideology trump those of the needs of the working class. <br>
How can they appeal to working class whites in villages and small towns when they are constantly supporting moves that would destroy their livelihoods?<br>

The white majority has bent over backward accommodating blacks on their every demand. Every proposed solution (integrated schools, integrated neighborhoods, affirmative action, ad. infinitum) were supposed to be the silver bullet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s becoming painfully (and expensively) obvious that no amount of liberal theories, time, effort, and money have worked. The white middle class has been squeezed to pay the bills. Hopefully, whites are waking up to the strong smell of espresso.</p>
<p>Whatever flaws there may be with the Tea Party movement, it&rsquo;s given whites an outlet to publicly say, &#8216;enough is enough&rsquo;. </p>

		<p>The good news is that whites are fleeing the Democratic Party in droves.  The bad news is the Republicans are only marginally better.  George W. Bush won a solid majority of the white vote in the elections of 2000 and 2004.  What was our reward?  A skyrocketing national debt, US troops marauding around the Middle East while the Mexican border lies undefended, the exportation of our manufacturing base, and the greatest number of non-white immigrants in the history of the republic.  I&rsquo;m afraid the &#8220;conservative&#8221; elected in 2012 will follow the same script.     </p>

		<p>Well, alot of working class whites who bought into the nonsense that Obama was &#8220;post-racial&#8221; now realize they were sold a lie. Like I wrote in this forum and other forums before he was elected, race relations would be worse under Obama because any time you disagreed with him and his policies the &#8220;race card&#8221; would be played hot and heavy. Not only by him but mostly by his leftwingnut supporters who wanted him in office precisely because they knew they could use him and the color of his skin to get the things they wanted, like socialized medicine. I have been proven correct as were alot of Amren readers who also saw this coming. And now the whites that voted for him in the hopes race relations would be better in this country have realized it was all a sham as well.</p>

		<p>The Democratic Party abandoned the white working class decades ago.  I mark it from the time forced busing ravaged working class neighborhoods in Boston and other cities back in the 70s.  The problem for the white working class is that the Republican Party never cared about them and still doesn&rsquo;t.  (How many Republicans oppose outsourcing?)  The white working class has nowhere to go.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the best we can expect is that enough Republicans get elected to impose gridlock on the federal government.  I have abandoned any hope that congress will pass good new laws, so I&rsquo;ll have to settle for no new laws.</p>

		<p>The real issue is not Republican or Democrat but the quality of people running for office.  Unfortunately, the quality of leaders has been steadily decreasing which accounts for the decaying of this country.  In reality, only 1% of the population are true leaders.  This country elected a smooth black operator as president.  Very, very foolish.  A democratic country must chose WISELY its leaders in order to survive.  This country is too obssessed with racial issues letting it overshadow everthing else.  Too much wasted money and effort trying to cater to the needs of blacks.<br>
A country that does not control its borders does not control its destiny, another major issue this country is losing on.  Too many hispanics, this country will just be another failed nation.  Rule of Law is important but it has been twisted to eventually create a third world country.  Very foolish.  </p>

		<p>To Commenter #1:  It hasn&rsquo;t always been the case.  Remember that it was the Democrats who supported slavery until the end, who fought tooth and nail against &#8220;civil rights&#8221; laws, and who held most of the white working-class vote until at least the sixties.  But yes, Democrats today have become a strongly Marxist (rather than simply being liberal, which is a different course of thought than socialism and Marxism) group of ignorant thugs, bent on &#8220;change&#8221; and modernism.</p>
<p>If only Andrew Jackson, the first &#8220;man of the people&#8221; to become president, and a staunchly pro-white politician by today&rsquo;s standards, could see what his party has become!</p>

<p>As the night follows the day&hellip;</p>
<p>Republicans could stay in office for life if they simply did what they promised the people who voted for them.</p>
<p>Lower taxes on the middle class. Cut social programs. Sharply curtail who&rsquo;s entitled to what and to those who put into they system. Enforce federal immigration laws.</p>
<p>None of this is rocket science and yet they manage to screw it up every time. Once they get into office, it&rsquo;s like the people who elected them don&rsquo;t exist.</p>

		<p>The liberal chattering class now seems to have made WV their poster state for the representation of working-class folks who have turned against Obama.  Of course, WV has been nationally trending Republican for a couple of decades, went for Hillary in the Dem primary, and for McCain in the general.  The state has a small percentage of blacks, so was naturally seen as a racist and even dangerous place during the presidential campaign.  Just like the Tea Party, the state is to blame because there are few blacks present.  Worse than Mississippi, apparently!  </p>

		<p>Whites who switch from one party to the other and then back again are like flies trapped in a killing jar. Both parties are controlled by the ruling elite. Both support the same policies despite all their rhetoric. The Obama Regime, despite all of its superficial differences in rhetoric and style, is just a continuation of the Bush Regime which was just a continuation of the Clinton Regime and so on down the line. Personally, I&rsquo;m amazed that anyone would see the Republicans as a viable alternative to Obama. The Republicans lost all credibility years ago. Hopefully, the GOP will win just enough seats to cause total gridlock and keep any of them from doing anything at all. It&rsquo;s our only hope.</p>

<p><br>
This isn&rsquo;t true.  The breaking point you are talking about has already taken place.  Most of the states have prepared to basically separate themselves from the federal system and nullify all federal law.  A few of those states have strong, open secessionist movements.  A majority of the states are working together toward common goals (white goals) and against the federal government.</p>
<p>Basically, everyone is holding their breath to see what happens in November.  The very legitimacy of the federal government itself is under scrutiny by state and local governments&hellip;.not some of them&hellip;.MOST of them.</p>
<p>The republicans will come into power, federally, in a few weeks.  They will immediately come under tremendous pressure to make dramatic changes on the federal level.</p>
<p>If they refuse, they will be defunded, and marginalized.  We will still have a federal government but it will become irrelevant in the lives of the vast majority of people.</p>
<p>Instead, where you live will become extremely important as to what the rule of law (and what those laws are) means.  I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough that this agenda is already well advanced.  You just don&rsquo;t hear about it on our communist controlled media.  There are A LOT of political changes happening you don&rsquo;t hear of because of our communist controlled media.</p>
<p>Soon, this won&rsquo;t matter.</p>

		<p>I agree 100% with Charles Marlow, #3 above, on the failure of the Republicans to represent the interests of the white  middle class. I noted yesterday that even Obama has taken more steps to correct our economic woes than did Bush and also noted he has done more in the middle east.  For the later observation I was called anti-semitic: duh? So typical of right wing thinking and exactly the reason Republicans are unable to ahieve anything meaningful. Name calling rather than reasoning.   Fact is Bush only engaged the issue in his last year, way to late to achieve anything.  Instead the experts say a President has to engage the issue from the gitgo and stick with it for years through ups ands downs to make any progress. Even though I consider myself a conservative who believes Obama is doing better than Bush I will still vote straight Republican due to their position on illegal immigrantion.  My theory is although Obama may be better economically in the short run, in the long run the most serious economic problem we face in this country is uncontrolled illegal immigration.  Even left wing noble prize winning economist Paul Krugman concedes that you cannot have a safety net society such as ours and allow all comers into the country because it is economically unsustainable. But it is a painful decision to reward the Republicans for their utter incompetence and indifference to middle class whites just because they got one thing right, maybe.  And I say maybe because who knows if they are going to turn on us again like McCain did with Kennedy on immigration once they are in office.  Remember the only reason illegals are here is because somebody is hiring them and not being prosecuted and that is not the middle class and as much as I am a race realist it also isn&rsquo;t blacks.</p>

		<p>I believe there is no need to demand or press for &#8220;pro-white&#8221; leadership. It&rsquo;s enough to demand a pro-truth and pro-reality American leadership and the cessation of a pro-Coloreds, pro-Muz, pro-Third World leadership. </p>
<p>In a country that&rsquo;s been multi-racial from the beginning, and is now dizzyingly multi-ethnic too, the only way to prosperity, stability and power   &mdash;   for the country, rather than for one of its factions or another   &mdash;   is to have a strict meritocratic system and a non-demented leadership that understands social reality&rsquo;s principle: the more color, the more dolor. Which means doing whatever necessary and humanely possible to restore the racial and cultural balance to what it was in 1965. It&rsquo;s not in order to do something &#8220;pro-White&#8221; but to do something pro-survival. Survival as a 1st rate country with prosperity, justice and pre-eminence.</p>
<p>As for the rest, let the best reap their just rewards, color- blind and gender neutral. 60% of positions in science and medicine occupied by Orientals and Indians? Tough luck. If you have a problem with it, Mister, raise your children to study as hard as those folks do. No affirmative action either at the NBA or at Yale. No ludicrous twisting of physical standards in the military, police or fire depts   &mdash;   and so on.</p>
<p>That is by the way the ruthlessly meritocratic system by which the North-Asian industrial powers (and China a military one too) beat us at our own game.</p>

		<p>Takuan Seiyo,</p>
<p>I am sorry but I have quite a few question marks illuminating in my head after reading your post.  </p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know much about American history if you want to claim that this country was multi-racial from the start.  And even if you are only including blacks and Native Americans, it is not as if they played a significant role in this country&rsquo;s early greatness.  You make it sound as if the United Nations were involved in this nation&rsquo;s founding.</p>
<p>And sorry, but your beloved Asians played an even more minor role than blacks did.</p>
<p>Second, it sounds to me like you want to take a pro-Asian stance to your argument.  Don&rsquo;t come on here and lecture us about how &#8220;oh we just can&rsquo;t be pro-white&#8221;.  Asians are pro-Asian in their own countries.  It is time for whites to be pro-white in our countries.</p>
<p>I have no respect whatsoever for your defeatist attitude.  I also think you are giving Asians more credit than they deserve. This country was the most successful in the world before &#8220;Asians were dominating 60% of our science positions&#8221;.</p>
<p>We did things just fine without Asians before, and we will do things just fine without them once again in the future.</p>

		<p>In his book &#8220;Chain Reaction: The Impact of Race, Rights, and Taxes on American Politics,&#8221; published in 1992,  Thomas Edsall wrote that the Democratic Party lost its status as the majority party because it lost the loyalty of the white working class, that it lost the loyalty of the white working class because it became associated with the defense of black interests, and that this is a problem because blacks are associated with social pathology.  <br>
 <br>
The Republican Party has served the white working class well by reducing the crime rate by in turn increasing the prison population.  Since 1980 the crime rate per 100,000 inhabitants has declined from 5,950.0 to 3,465.5 in 2009.  The prison population has grown from 315,974 in 1980 to 1,428,187 in 2000. <br>
