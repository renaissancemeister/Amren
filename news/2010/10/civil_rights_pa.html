			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jerry Markon, Washington Post, October 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A federal commission had to postpone a vote on a report that criticizes the Justice Department&rsquo;s handling of a voter-intimidation lawsuit Friday after a Democratic panelist walked out of the meeting in protest.</p>
<p>The draft of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights report says that Justice tried to hide the extensive involvement of high-level political officials in the dismissal of the suit against members of the New Black Panther Party. The move, the report says, indicates that Justice&rsquo;s Civil Rights Division is failing to protect white voters and is &#8220;at war with its core mission of guaranteeing equal protection (under) the laws for all Americans.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Justice Department has strongly denied the allegations in the report, which follows the commission&rsquo;s year-long investigation into the Obama administration&rsquo;s handling of the 2008 incident. The Bush administration had filed the lawsuit against the New Black Panther Party members, but the Justice Department under the Obama administration dismissed most of the case.</p>
<p>The commission, which is controlled by a bloc of conservative and liberterian members, was scheduled to vote on the report Friday morning. But it could not reach a quorum because commissioner Michael Yaki, a Democratic appointee, refused to participate.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has been a procedural and partisan farce from the beginning,&#8221; Yaki said in an impromptu news conference. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not my responsibility to make a quorum for this kangaroo court .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they want to score political points against the Obama Justice Department.&#8221;</p>
<p>Members of the commission&rsquo;s majority, who drafted the report, denied they were motivated by politics and accused Justice Department officials of blocking their investigation, failing to turn over key documents and instructing witnessnes not to testify.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The accusations illustrate the partisan nature of the debate over the New Black Panther Party case, which triggered outrage from conservatives and congressional Republicans, two internal Justice Department inquiries and the civil rights commission investigation. {snip}</p>
<p>Justice officials have said the case&rsquo;s dismissal was based on a legal analysis and insufficient evidence. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The commission&rsquo;s draft report said the department&rsquo;s &#8220;repeated attempts to obscure&#8221; the involvement of political appointees in the dismissal &#8220;raise questions about what the Department is trying to hide. &#8220;</p>
<p>The commission&rsquo;s findings are based mostly on the testimony of two Justice Department attorneys involved in the case, as well as media reports, including a recent article in The Washington Post. {snip}<br>

		<p>I think the way this is shaping up is great.  There&rsquo;s not a soul around who is objective who would deny the injustice of the biased, white-hating Justice Dept. of the United States of America, so every black who openly opposes efforts to reform the corrupt department is telling the naive whites in this country a little bit more about the extent of black racist hatred.  It&rsquo;s very real and it&rsquo;s widespread.</p>
<p>This is just one example of how far a department can deteriorate if it is transferred into the hands of blacks and their disturbed self-hating white supporters and every non-white who has a deep-seated hatred for whites.</p>
<p>We truly need an economic collapse so most of these departments can be cut back to skeleton crews with so much work to do they won&rsquo;t have time to spew their hatred.</p>
<p>Blacks, as a group, are easily the worst haters on the planet.</p>

<p>About 10 years ago an Asian woman wrote an essay on black racism for The American Enterprise Institutes&rsquo;s magazine. In it she noted the cowardice of Asian civil rights leaders. Regular Asians do complain to them about black racism and hate crimes but the Asian &#8220;leaders&#8221; are too weak and cowardly to stand up to blacks.</p>
<p>These same race activists know that whites do not organize around race so they feel free to attack a white for telling a stupid joke about Asians. But they won&rsquo;t say boo about blacks killing and/or gang raping an elderly Asian while pelting them with racial slurs. That is because blacks do organize around race and will just start accusing the Asians of racism.</p>
<p>Michael Yaki is a perfect specimen of such cowardice, weakness and hypocrisy.</p>

		<p>What do you think concerning adding some more illustrations?  No offence, page is really great. Just according to the scientists humans acquire information much more efficient when there are some useful illustrations.</p>

		<p>Well the goat in the sheep pen is no doubt this-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
The accusations illustrate the partisan nature of the debate over the New Black Panther Party case, which triggered outrage from conservatives and congressional Republicans, two internal Justice Department inquiries and the civil rights commission investigation. The commission, which studies federal enforcement of civil rights laws, has eight members   &mdash;   four presidential appointees and four appointed by Congress.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>If a true majority of the Commission has bought into the case as presented, that means that it is no longer an &#8216;all the President&rsquo;s men&rsquo; condition which in turn begs the question of how Yaki and the other two holdouts are holding up the parade through this denial of quorum tactic.</p>
<p>And why would any responsible governing body let a Presidential Appointee sit in on something which could have personal ties to the White House like this?  It calls for an independent investigator/special prosecutor.  Maybe that&rsquo;s the next step.</p>
<p>Of course, the easiest way to deny someone evidence is to bury altered copies of it in among 4,000 other documents but I must say while the presence of two thugs outside a polling station is obscene to me, I am not impressed with the two Justice hacks who have effectively made themselves celebrities after the fact in a manner that begs the perception of axe-grinding.</p>
<p>Not having seen -anything- concrete, from either side, I sure hope these to attorney&rsquo;s took some cell photos, raided some trash cans and taped a lot of conversations before they left.</p>
<p>Otherwise, this is going to come down to he said/she said and the tie breaker will be exactly how much Obama knew, when.  This isn&rsquo;t Nixon.  Someone will be cut loose as cover and the delay of game in running this country will be ruinous.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need another meltdown in the White House with Biden holding the reins.</p>
<p>What we _need_ is a solution in SWA, a new budget that kills all this unaffordable social program beneficence and a secure border followed by exodus of the illegals.  Anything else is just cheap theatrical distraction.</p>

		<p>Divide and conquer!  That&rsquo;s the plan of the elites, toward a One World Order. Play ethnic politics, swamp us w/mass Third World immigration, say assimilation is racist, gerry-mander etc., etc.</p>

		<p>From another view and as the choir, we are in the same hymnal, what say our beloved Fourth Estate?  We all will agree that there is a lot of work to do to return our country to a free and courageous press but just how much danger will we face in the meantime even if that distant goal is met?  I really feel as if I am an East German in the 1950&rsquo;s searching for some shred of real news truth in my daily newspaper.  The communists have done an outstanding job in fleecing the American public of journalists.  Now in their place we have generations of anti-American fervor and disgust for the brilliance of our founders in handing us the freedoms of thought, speech, and writing.  So perhaps the obama goons will get away with this behavior and we have another joke in definition, &#8220;as he was DOJed&#8221;.  In the end, even the &#8220;minorities&#8221; will realize how wrong the turn we have taken.  I am afraid, as you all are, there will be no way back and America will have been that candle that burns brightest for a time but for so short of time.  </p>

		<p>What Yaki ought to consider is that since blacks are notorious for racially-motivated attacks on East Asians, the thugs he is protecting would be just as happy beating up Chinese outside a polling station as they would whites.</p>
