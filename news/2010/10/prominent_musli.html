			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matea Gold, Los Angeles Times, October 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>NPR&rsquo;s decision to fire news analyst Juan Williams for remarks he made about Muslims on airliners was not only roundly criticized by conservatives Thursday, but also was viewed with alarm by some Muslim American activists and scholars.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some prominent Muslims expressed concern Thursday that his firing would widen a gulf between Muslims and non-Muslims in the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;The greater American public remains unsure about Islam and very often hostile about Islam,&#8221; said Akbar Ahmed, chair of Islamic Studies at American University, who examines the divide in his new film and book, &#8220;Journey into America: The Challenge of Islam.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ahmed said he was disappointed by Williams&rsquo; comments. But he added that NPR&rsquo;s abrupt firing &#8220;does not bring the temperature down against Muslims.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now the debate is, are we being oversensitive to Muslims?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We as a country are engaged in a very wild and wooly conversation about Islam and Muslim Americans,&#8221; said Suhail Khan, a conservative activist who is a Muslim American, noting that minorities such as Catholics, Jews and Japanese Americans have faced similar hostility throughout U.S. history. &#8220;Sometimes the conversation is thoughtful and sometimes it&rsquo;s ugly.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Khan said NPR overreacted in letting Williams go. &#8220;While Juan&rsquo;s comments may have been a little rough around the edges, he was voicing an honest opinion and trying to articulate his personal questions and struggles with perceptions in regards to Muslims,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The decision drew an avalanche of complaints against the media organization. By Thursday evening, more than 5,400 comments had been posted on NPR.org, many of them angrily accusing the organization of political correctness. Conservative leaders such as Newt Gingrich and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee called for cuts to NPR&rsquo;s funding.</p>
<p>NPR receives no direct federal money for its operations, but between 1% and 3% of its $160 million budget comes from competitive grants awarded by publicly funded entities such as the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the National Endowment for the Arts</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a piece for FoxNews.com, Williams called his firing &#8220;an outrageous violation of journalistic standards and ethics by management that has no use for a diversity of opinion, ideas or a diversity of staff.&#8221; He said his discussion with O&rsquo;Reilly included &#8220;no support for anti-Muslim sentiments of any kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fox News moved aggressively to turn the controversy to its advantage, signing Williams to an expanded role at the cable news network.<br>

<p>Akbar - - what you say is garbage, plain, pure and simple.</p>
<p>Since 9/11 the FBI has investigated eighteen claims of discrimination against your folks. And nine of those complaints were only made THIS YEAR. Complaints not actually proven, but merely MADE!</p>
<p>Akbar - - in a nation of 300 million, you ought to concentrate on rather HOW LITTLE the discrimination seems to be against your folks.</p>
<p>Persons in this country, perhaps with the connivance of the White House, are wrongly trying to stir up trouble where there is none? I fear it is so. Something is being made out of nothing that will only bring NO GOOD.</p>

Had Mr. Williams been a conservative, his firing would have been spearheaded and openly cheered by the Muslim community. Attacking a liberal on this issue has made it a &#8216;man bites dog&rsquo; news story with legs.</p>
<p>Certainly the Muslim community is now concerned. After all, black liberals are now admitting they stereotype and profile Muslims.</p>
<p>Love him or hate him, Mr. Williams has done us a favor. He told the truth that the Muslims don&rsquo;t want Americans to hear or be permitted to say.    </p>
<p>The cat is out of the bag. Even liberals fear Muslims.</p>

		<p>Muslims are not African-Americans  &mdash;  -they are not demanding special treatment as redress for mistreatment in the past. They are willing to work and to obey the law, and should do well in a free society that gives everyone space to be their own peculiar brand of person. I&rsquo;m not worried about Muslims  &mdash;  except for the few deluded ones who seem to be at war with free societies. </p>

		<p>CAIR, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, is said to be the pressure group that asked NPR to take action against Juan Williams.</p>
<p>Minority pressure groups exercise a kind of veto power over much the content available over the airways   &mdash;  - and in schools. For example, here is how Islamic and ethnocentric pressure groups censor American public school textbooks according to NYU research professor professor Diane Ravitch in THE LANGUAGE POLICE: How Pressure Groups Restrict What Students Learn (2003): </p>
<p>&ldquo;The world history textbooks consistently shade or omit facts that might offend any racial, ethnic, or religious group.  This does not occur by happenstance.  Most of the books prominently identify an advisory board that includes representatives of religious and ethnic groups.  Three [of the four major textbook] publishers  &mdash;  Glencoe, Houghton-Mifflin, and Prentice-Hall  &mdash;  rely on the same individual from the Council on Islamic Education to review their Islamic content.  This may account for the similarity of their material on Islam as well as their omission of anything that would enable students to understand conflicts between Islamic fundamentalism and Western liberalism.&#8221;p147</p>
<p>Why do American textbook publishers bow to ethnocentric pressure groups?  To NOT bow the pressure groups would be to risk losing a multi-million dollar sale to a large state where textbooks are approved for by state level textbook adoption committees.</p>

		<p>Muslims are making themselves a nuisance all over the world. Everywhere they interface with other religions and cultures   &mdash;  - Middle East, South Asia, Western China, North Africa, and in recent decades in the homelands of the White race   &mdash;  - they are overbearing, hostile, separatist, atavistic, violent and seek to stifle any criticism of themselves. Regardless of how numerous they are at present, through high birthrates and conversion, and how bellicose, the writing is on the wall for them:  China and Russia will eventually put their own interests above their glee in spiting the West; colonized Europe is getting fed up; and between the combined hostility of North Asians, Hindus, and Whites, and their own backwardness and tribalism, the Muslims haven&rsquo;t much of a future. All of which does not mean, of course, they cannot cause much damage in the short term. Mosques are command and control centers for Islam&rsquo;s  international subjugation agenda; these are not merely religious worship sites as in other religions, and therefore should be banned in all White countries. Also, the Muslims are more and more brazenly attempting to dictate to us what we may say and think in our own homelands; this is completely unacceptable. <br>
  A little Saxon wrath, anyone? Or should we just wait until the Resurgent Chinese do our dirty work for us?</p>

		<p>#4 &#8220;C&#8221; above. Wrong. Islam has a 1500 year track record to prove its real nature. The fundamental tenets of Islam, ie. Jihad,<br>
Hiraj (immigrate to takeover) and Sharia (Religion and Politics<br>
and Law are one) make it absolutely incompatible with The West.<br>
You might check out the history of India, Kashmir, Lebanon, the<br>
Balkans, Thailand, Philippines, England, France, Spain, Singapor<br>
as examples of what happens when Islam is brought in close<br>
proximity with the non-Islamic. Allowing Islam into the USA <br>
is suicide. The bombings and hijackings and secret societies have<br>
already begun..in case you dont read the newspaper.</p>

		<p>The lady at NPR who fired Williams was talking about it at a press conference. She said, &#8220;(williams issue with Muslims) is something he should talk about with his psychiatrist&#8221;.</p>

<p>Listen to Sanchez&rsquo; mild remark that got him fired:</p>

<p>The firing of both Williams and Sanchez show that our media think it&rsquo;s part of their job to protect us from things it&rsquo;s not safe for us to hear.</p>

<p>Native American, Circa 1700: I&#8221;m not worried about White Europeans-except for the few deluded ones who seem to be at war with our societies.</p>
<p>Black African, 1652: I&rsquo;m not worried about Dutch settlers-except for the few deluded ones who seem to be at war with our society.</p>
<p>White South African, Circa 1900: I&rsquo;m not worried about African immigrants-except for the few deluded ones who seem to be at war with our society.</p>
<p>United States, Circa 1970: I&rsquo;m not worried about Mexican immigrants-expect for the few deluded ones who seem to still be at war with our society.</p>
<p>  My thoughts are that we should worry about any level of immigration, as it inevitably leads to the destruction of the previously dominant culture and/or racial group. The only difference between societies is in terms of time, not result.</p>

		<p>4 C: If you don&rsquo;t think the Moslems are a problem, give them time and numbers.  In Europe, they ARE the problem.  And if you have appreciable numbers of them in your town, you already know it.  West Los Angeles is full of Middle Easterners, and it&rsquo;s not good, even if they are mostly wealthy.  </p>

		<p>Aren&rsquo;t there even African Americans that are Muslims? Bet ole Juan never thought about that one. The only reason Juan Williams is the pet of the day for all these stupid &#8220;conservatives&#8221; is to show that they aren&rsquo;t racists&hellip;Juan will make out like a bandit now. More $$$$&hellip;</p>
<p>He also seemed to whine quite a bit because he was fired yet, we would never see that liberal hack defend any White man that dares speaks the truth about blacks, mexicans, or muslims!  How many Whites have been fired for that over the eyars and I don&rsquo;t recall Fox News offering them any money and to join the Fox Network!  Look at Rush, for example and how he was fired from being a sports commentator because he dare say something about blacks and quarterbacks or something to that effect. Did ole Juan defend Rush? NOPE.. Juan is also anti-White if you didn&rsquo;t know it already.</p>

		<p>11  &mdash;  Exiled From Eden: Yes, Muslims are the problem in Europe, where it appears that Latin Americans (who can come in through Spain and then are Schengen-enabled to go wherever they want) are much more assimilable. But here&rsquo;s the big difference: the US gets 8th grade dropouts from Mexico, but PhDs from Turkey, whereas Europe gets college graduates from Ecuador, but illiterate villagers from Turkey. The problem is not that the immigrant is Muslim, it is that the immigrant is a backwards villager  &mdash;  and that is not the case for Muslim immigrants to the US (except for refugees).</p>

The question for us: How do we handle this in a peaceful way? My answer is that of Hayek and Voltaire: with enough liberty, we can all be who we want to be. I think immigrants who want liberty to create their own spaces should be welcomed, while immigrants who want to restrict liberty in order to create special privileges should be avoided.<br>

<p>I don&rsquo;t even know where to begin with your comment. Immigration of 3rd worlders IS the problem and the enemy within has helped that along. We allowed communists to pour in here by the millions from the old Soviet Union to our detriment. The importation of African slaves was what sealed our fate also, not to mention allowing them to stay in this country and making them citizens. We see the fine results on that big mistake. This nation was founded by Whites FOR Whites, period. Until that truth is repeated over and again nothing will change, it will only worsen as we have seen in the last two centuries.</p>

		<p>Yes Muslim immigration will end in &#8220;clash of civilizations&#8221; but it will come in the form of a centuries long civil war, much like in the Balkans<br>
or Lebanon &hellip;and the result of it will be the destruction of the<br>
any shred of stability or peace here in the USA, much like the Balkans or Lebanon. The winner will inherit a wasteland.<br>
To prevent it..we need to just say NO to muslim immigration.<br>
No explanations, no animosity..just NO. </p>

		<p>Response to 13-C: I believe our discussion here concerns two different ideas, in that I am looking at it more in terms of racial survivability as compared to maintaining any strict existence of the culture of a specific time in history.</p>
<p>&#8220;13-C: Immigration is just part of the reason for the erosion of our culture. Could just as well blame affluence, or the internet, or Facebook&hellip; We can&rsquo;t stop everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>- You are correct, and I would not propose to curb affluence, technology, nor human interaction, and certainly understand that culture changes over time. My concern is that the long term affects of non-White immigration into historically White nations will lead to the eventual extinction or severe reduction of the numbers of White people and a likely destruction of White culture in general. </p>
<p>&#8220;13-C: At this point, we all need to face what&rsquo;s happened: the scope of our nation has grown so wide that it includes all kinds of people who would not have received approval from our ancestors. The question for us: How do we handle this in a peaceful way?&#8221;</p>
<p>- The growth in &#8220;all kinds of people&#8221; hasn&rsquo;t received approval from many of our current population, let alone what our ancestors would have thought.  We have been able to handle this in a peaceful manner through the use of techniques such as &#8220;White Flight&#8221;.  Additionally, your question itself truly outlines the threat; if non-similar immigration were a positive thing, we wouldn&rsquo;t need to even ask how to handle it in a peaceful manner as it would peaceful to begin with. Your question alludes directly to the inherent negatives (any manner of non-peacefullness to include population displacement) associated with non-similar immigration.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;13-C: My answer is that of Hayek and Voltaire: with enough liberty, we can all be who we want to be. I think immigrants who want liberty to create their own spaces should be welcomed, while immigrants who want to restrict liberty in order to create special privileges should be avoided.&#8221;</p>
<p>- I would say this is the belief of a utopian.  Certainly, such beliefs hold to the high ideas of a civilized society, but I find in the overwhelming majority of human societies throughout history, that mixing non-similar races and cultures eventually leads to devastating bloodshed as well as race and culture displacment or eradication.  Again, your comments outline the danger: &#8220;immigrants who..create their own spaces&hellip;&#8221;.  Just where are they creating these spaces and just who is it that they are displacing?  Additionally to this, just how is it that we are to differentiate between the various good and bad immigrants you describe? In my view, we do not have any such methods for such distinction, with the end result being the admittance of those who wish our destruction.</p>
<p>- In the end, it is the policies of liberalism that will, once again as it has over and over in history, lead to the rise of the far right.  The result is always racial discourse, human bloodshed and the destruction of nations. America is but one of the next areas on our planet where this is taking shape.</p>

		<p>13 C: Those immigrants who want the liberty to create their own spaces will be taking OUR space for themselves.  They don&rsquo;t come here for our benefit, but for their own.  Since I was young, SoCal has acquired a number of Middle Eastern and Oriental enclaves, where Whites can&rsquo;t buy property because, somehow, the immigrants can always come up with another $5000 to outbid you. They are racially conscious and we are the foreigners to them.  They&rsquo;re here to claim territory and get rich, without paying back into the system.  Colonists,in other words.<br>
     And the Moslems who come here may not be peasants, but they are by no means a bunch of rocket scientists.  More like slippery shopkeepers the most of them.  </p>

		<p>In response to C, you need to wake up to the fact that Muslims all over the world are at war with Western Civilization.  That includes us.  They may not all be soldiers in that war, but they&rsquo;re all on the same side.  I don&rsquo;t know when any Blacks have driven planes into buildings killing thousands of Americans. Blacks are a problem, but not nearly as dangerous a problem as radical Muslims.  I don&rsquo;t agree with anything Jaun Williams has to say on Fox, but at least he has the balls to go on there and make his case, however wrong his case may be.  On being nervous about Muslims riding on the same plane as me, I agree with him 100%.  We have enough of a problem in America with political correctness stifling our ability to criticise anyone who&rsquo;s Black or Gay, or any other catagory of protected class.  We don&rsquo;t need political correctness tying our hands and bridling our tungs when it comes to fighting this group that has killed thousands of us.</p>

<p>If that&rsquo;s the case, I wish they&rsquo;d fire him a few more times.</p>

#4 C: African Americans (I detest that term) may no be Muslim, but many Africans are:</p>
<p>According to TheLastCrusade.net and freerepublic.com:<br>
&#8220;President Barack Hussein Obama, in a determination letter to Congress, has announced that he will allow an additional 80,000 immigrants – - mostly from Islamic countries – - to resettle in the United States during fiscal year 2011.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama says that the increase in Muslim immigrants &ldquo;is justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following &ldquo;goals&rdquo; for new immigrants has been set as follows:</p>
<p>Africa &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.15,000<br>
East Asia &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.19,000<br>
Europe and Central Asia &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;2,000<br>
Latin America/Caribbean&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.5,500<br>
Near East/South Asia&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.35,500<br>
Unallocated Reserve&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.3,000</p>
<p>Refugee Resettlement Watch and other organizations have expressed grave concern that Mr. Obama is allowing some many immigrants into the country while so many Americans remain out of work and living in poverty.</p>
<p>According to the US Department of Labor, 14.8 million Americans remain unemployed. 6.1 million have been out of work for 27 weeks or over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Currently, the state of Washington, being pressured by Nigerian Muslim residents, is considering allowing non-citizens to vote in local elections. These Nigerian Muslim immigrants, who have lived in the U.S. many years, have children who were educated in American schools, but &#8220;are left out of having a say about local policies that have affected them for years due to the fact that they are not do have American citizenship.&#8221;</p>
<p>The same rules apply to even those Nigerians who are legal immigrants (not all of which are) as apply to Hispanics: become a citizen legally and you can vote. Demanding we change our laws to accommodate them is not obeying our laws in my book.</p>

<p>Actually I think there was likely quite a bit of discrimination but Muslims are less likely to report it. I know after 9/11 the Iranian family that ran a cafeteria (separate business) in the office complex I worked at were severely harrassed (a tenant was putting up petitions in all the restrooms asking others to support getting them throw out of the complex). Fortunately one of the other more prominent tenants (Jewish) used their clout to get nix the harrassment and they stayed.</p>
<p>A lot of that went on but most went unreported to the Feds.</p>

		<p>Muslims do not want to move to the US or to Europe to assimilate they want to come here to make it a clone of the hole they crawled out of. They also make outrageous demands of us to conform to their culture rather than trying to fit in with ours. Muslims will also outbreed us if we do not cut back on our extragant lifestyles and have more than 1-2 children each. Muslims have 4-6 children each and even at that rate they will outbreed native Whites very quickly as they have already done in parts of Europe. Blacks who convert to Islam have no idea that Arab Muslims think of them as slaves and inferior people not worthy of much more than manual labor. </p>
