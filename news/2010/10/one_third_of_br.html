			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brendan Carlin, Daily Mail (London), October 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Labour laws designed to bring highly-qualified foreign workers such as brain surgeons into the UK were used by immigrants to get jobs as shop assistants and security guards, the Coalition claimed last night.</p>
<p>Immigration Minister Damian Green unveiled research showing that nearly one in three immigrants in the Labour Government&rsquo;s &#8216;tier one&rsquo; category for top-level applicants last year ended up doing ordinary unskilled jobs.</p>
<p>Tier one immigrants are categorised as doctors, scientists and entrepreneurs so skilled they could enter the UK without a job offer, said Mr Green</p>
<p>&#8216;These are meant to be absolutely the brightest and the best,&rsquo; he said in a BBC interview.</p>
<p>But the anomalies had been revealed after a sample was analysed. &#8216;We have discovered that of the visas we issued last year 29 per cent are doing unskilled jobs,&rsquo; he said. &#8216;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re shop assistants, security guards, supermarket cashiers  &mdash;  all absolutely essential jobs we need for our economy.</p>
<p>&#8216;But at a time when we have a couple of million unemployed people in this country and we have 300,000 unemployed graduates, it seems to me pretty perverse if we say we&rsquo;ve got to keep bringing in unlimited people because we think they are very highly skilled.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The full research, based on a sample of 1,184 tier one immigrants out of more than 18,000 given visas in 2009 is to be published this week by the UK Border Agency. It was the first detailed look at how Labour&rsquo;s policies had operated, Mr Green added.</p>
<p>However, the revelations come amid concerns that the Coalition&rsquo;s interim cap on non-EU immmigration, introduced in July, is hurting British businesses and scientific research capability.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Chris Mawtus, chief operating officer of oil service company Expro which employs 1,000 people in the UK, warned: &#8216;We may have to start thinking of relocating some of our operations overseas.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Former Tory Minister Lord Ryder, chairman of the Institute of Cancer Research, warned a House of Lords debate last week that the cap jeopardised its work and ability to &#8216;bring in the right people at the right time&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Mr Green insisted yesterday that the Government was being flexible and responding to concerns over the cap. He told The Mail on Sunday: &#8216;It&rsquo;s a new system and there will be difficulties along the way but serious cases can be resolved.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The current cap level would be reviewed and set at a permanent level next April after consultations, Mr Green added. But he stressed that the country could not go on with Labour&rsquo;s old &#8216;unlimited immigration policy&rsquo;.<br/>

		<p>We need to rid ourselves of capitalism if it requires wave after wave of non-white immigrants to sustain itself.  Of course this is just the excuse that the insane white hating left and the corrupt corporations use to turn the US and Europe into non-white plantations and we know it to be a lie.  </p>

		<p>Poster #1 is right.  Where I&rsquo;m at the Asians, for example, are buying up every plot, house and business in sight.  You know they&rsquo;re getting ft loans to do it.  In the end they rake in the rents and fees.  There are so many BMWs and Mercedes around here being driven by guys who look like they used to work in rice paddies.  It&rsquo;s amazing.  Maybe I&rsquo;m doing something wrong and should try me some of that!</p>

		<p>It seems it would be an asset for a country to keep its &#8220;best and brightest&#8221; rather than shipping them off to other countries. Or perhaps we just didn&rsquo;t realize that those sneaking across our southern borders are rocket scientists.</p>

		<p>Response to poster #3:  Many of the Asians and Arabs running around in BMWs and Mercedes luxury cars are heavily leveraged by mortgage debt.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re heavily dependent on mass immigration, generous welfare, and easy loans to keep the rental markets firm. </p>
<p>They think they&rsquo;re going to establish family dynastys here by way of ownership of our land. It makes one wish for a strong market correction to sort them out.  </p>

<p>I heard a spot on some radio station, NPR - I think, where one reviewer said that many of the Asians that got hired in Silicon Valley and elsewhere, all over the country got hired on &#8220;reputation.&#8221;  That is, they were hired because it was assumed that they were whizes at computer and high tech applications.  Many were no more than third rate certified techs, who always had to refer to manuals, printed in English! The U.S. citizens they replaced were more experienced and knowledgeable than most of them.  That PC generated assumption of superiority of the Asian in computer engineering, has led to the present one that posters #3 and #5 are illustrating.  They got in through a lax,, PC inspired INS that accepted their credentials for H1B visas and naive, WHITE owned businesses, like Microsoft.  But as pointed out, they never intended to remain in the tech help pools they usually ended up in.  The Chinese are simply using agents to spend Chinese owned USD in buying up tracts of homes.  </p>
<p>I am predicting here that one day soon we will learn that the Chinese government is behind a great deal of real estate purchasing and these guys running around in BMWs and Mercedes word for the Chinese governemnt.  It is too easy for them do do, so I think they are doing it.  Our government is only lately showing that it is slightly alarmed at the way mortgages are being foreclosed upon.  When the rest of the iceberg is revealed, it may cause a national panic.   But things like this have occured before, if on a smaller scale.  It is also a great way to render the U.S. a nonthreat militarily.  It&rsquo;s a good scenario for a book or movie, anyway. But this is China we are taling about here.<br/>
