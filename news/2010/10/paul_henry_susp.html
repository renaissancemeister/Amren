			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>New Zealand Herald, Oct. 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Paul Henry has been suspended by TVNZ for comments he made yesterday about the Governor-General Sir Anand Satyanand. </p>
<p>Henry asked Prime Minister John Key during his morning Breakfast show, &#8220;Are you going to choose a New Zealander who looks and sounds like a New Zealander this time &hellip; Are we going to go for someone who is more like a New Zealander this time?&#8221; </p>
<p>In a statement today TVNZ CEO Rick Ellis said Henry&rsquo;s remarks were inappropriate for anyone in the company to make. </p>
<p>&#8220;I have met with Paul and told him that while his apologies were the right thing to do and that I believe he is sincere in his regret, I still consider his remarks unacceptable for any employee of TVNZ to make,&#8221; Mr Ellis said. </p>
<p>&#8220;TVNZ is a multi-cultural company that is representative of modern New Zealand&rsquo;s rich ethnic diversity. </p>
<p>&#8220;We give Paul a lot of freedom with the Breakfast programme and he does a magnificent job. But as we have said before, with that freedom comes responsibility. </p>
<p>&#8220;Paul is one of New Zealand&rsquo;s best broadcasters. He is a provocative host who speaks his mind and that is what many New Zealanders like about him. He often pushes the boundaries and that&rsquo;s important in a country that values freedom of speech. But I consider his latest remarks to have well and truly crossed that line. </p>
<p>&#8220;When Sir Anand returns from the Commonwealth Games I will be personally apologising to him.&#8221; </p>
<p>Henry has been suspended effective immediately without pay until October 18. </p>
<p>TVNZ spokeswoman Megan Richards said TVOne presenter Rawdon Christie would be filling in for Henry for the next week, and then the fill-in hosting role would be &#8220;reviewed&#8221;. </p>
<p>Henry is also due to host This Is Your Life this weekend. Ms Richards said the broadcaster is &#8220;investigating alternative options&#8221; for his replacement. </p>
<p>Henry&rsquo;s apologies </p>
<p>Henry apologised yesterday if he caused any offence but did not say sorry for the substance. This morning he went a little further. &#8220;I am sincerely sorry if I seemed disrespectful to him (Sir Anand), that was not what I intended and I certainly didn&rsquo;t intend to sound racist. It was wrong for me to ask the questions that I did.&#8221; Henry said Sir Anand&rsquo;s background was far more &#8220;dignified&#8221; than his own. &#8220;Most people think that I am British but the truth is much much worse than that, like the Governor-General I was born in New Zealand but, however, I am at least half what they colloquially call in Europe a gippo (gypsy). &#8220;So let me make it quite clear I will never apologise for causing outrage, however, I will, and do apologise for causing real hurt and upset to anyone, no matter what their background, who works to make this country a better country. &#8220;So in that spirit I apologise unreservedly to Sir Anand and his family, he is a very distinguished man I am a gippo television presenter.&#8221; Earlier, TVNZ spokeswoman Andi Brotherston had put out a statement defending Henry&rsquo;s remarks. </p>
<p>&#8220;The audience tell us over and over again that one of the things they love about Paul Henry is that he&rsquo;s prepared to say the things we quietly think but are scared to say out loud,&#8221; said the statement. </p>
<p>Protest at TVNZ </p>
<p>The Unite union said today that suspending Henry, &#8220;the poster boy for bigotry&#8221;, was not enough and called for his sacking. </p>
<p>Unite and Global Peace and Justice Auckland (GPJA) will join a protest outside TVNZ&rsquo;s Auckland offices at 5pm today. </p>
<p>&#8220;It is a case of &#8216;three strikes and you&rsquo;re out&rsquo;. Paul Henry is a serial offender. He has abused women, people of colour, gay people, people with disabilities and all migrant Kiwis who don&rsquo;t look like him,&#8221; GPJA spokesperson John Minto said. </p>
<p>It was not a case of a broadcaster exercising free speech, he said. </p>
<p>Unite Union national director Mike Treen also said he did not call for someone&rsquo;s dismissal lightly. </p>
<p>&#8220;However Paul Henry legitimises racism and bigotry in the workplace. I deal every day with problems associated with managers and even co-workers abusing staff because the look or sound different,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>Workers could end up &#8220;tormented and bullied out of their jobs by the so-called humour being practised by Paul Henry&#8221;. </p>
<p>&#8220;When we try to protect the workers, the inevitable response is &#8216;well, Paul Henry is allowed to use this language on national TV why can&rsquo;t I?&rsquo; Paul Henry has become the poster boy for bigotry.&#8221; </p>
<p>Henry had &#8220;no place on a national broadcaster paid for by taxpayers&#8221;. <br>

								<h2><a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10678220">Ethnic Mix Changing Rapidly</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Simon Collins, New Zealand Herald, Oct. 5, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>What it means to be a New Zealander has changed dramatically in the 50 years since Paul Henry was born and is projected to change even more. </p>
<p>In the March 1961 Census, seven months after Henry was born in Auckland, 99 per cent of the resident population was classified as either European (92 per cent) or Maori (7 per cent), with the latter required to show at least half &#8220;Maori blood&#8221;. </p>
<p>Long-established Chinese, Indian and Pacific minorities shared the remaining 1 per cent. </p>
<p>Official ideas about ethnicity have changed and Statistics NZ now lets people claim multiple ethnicities with no official &#8220;blood&#8221; requirements, so the figures add up to more than 100 per cent. </p>
<p>Public attitudes have changed too and at the last Census in 2006, 11 per cent of the population refused any ethnic label and claimed to be plain &#8220;New Zealanders&#8221;. Researchers found that about 90 per cent of them had previously been classified as European. </p>
<p>But even adding in all the self-described New Zealanders, only 77 per cent of the population now claim &#8220;European&#8221; or &#8220;New Zealander&#8221; as either their sole ethnicity or one of their ethnicities. In contrast, in the 45 years since 1961: </p>
<p>* Those claiming Maori ethnicity doubled to 15 per cent. </p>
<p>* Those claiming Pacific ethnicity multiplied 12-fold to 7 per cent. </p>
<p>* Those claiming Asian ethnicity multiplied 18-fold to 10 per cent. </p>
<p>By 2026 Asians are expected to equal the Maori population with about 16 per cent each, Pacific people will be up to 10 per cent, and Europeans will be down to 70 per cent. </p>
<p>Waikato University researcher Dr Tahu Kukutai, who has a $300,000 Marsden grant to investigate the treatment of ethnicity in censuses around the world, said Henry&rsquo;s comments illustrated &#8220;a disconnect between this rapidly changing demography and this Eurocentric analysis of what being a New Zealander is. What he is saying is clearly out of step with the demographic realities.&#8221;</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s better not to put onself in that situation. But if one should slip, the key phrase is to say that one&rsquo;s critics are &#8220;entitled to their opinion&#8221;. Which, of course, is just a high brow way of telling them to pound sand. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been said before but bears repeating. Grovelling is like blood in the water. It doesn&rsquo;t get you out of anything. It just makes things worse. Never apologize. Ever.</p>

		<p> And pray what ethnicity IS Governor General Sir Anand Satyanand? That seems to have gotten lost in the shuffle of ginned-up Leftist outrage and the scurrying of scared Whites to apologize.</p>
<p> Everyone knows exactly what Paul Henry meant by his remark, and there was no logical reason that New Zealand had to start letting in large numbers of non-Whites, as Australia has done. They were brow-beaten and shamed into it.</p>
<p> As I&rsquo;ve said before, the most long-range damaging thing that Adolf Hitler did was to make White people afraid to stand up for their own &#8220;side,&#8221; to defend their values and their lands. We&rsquo;ve developed a permanent flinch when it comes to racial and ethnic accusations like those against Henry, and if we don&rsquo;t snap out of it soon, it&rsquo;s going to mean the eventual extinction of the Caucasian race.</p>

		<p>To begin with, one should ask just why New Zealand&rsquo;s Governor-General Sir Anand Satyanand was chosen over other qualified candidates either White or Maori. Was it because of his Non-white ethnicity as was blatantly done in Canada with our last two female G-G&rsquo;s who were born in Hong Kong and Haiti respectively, or was it a patronage appointment?</p>
<p>Paul Henry&rsquo;s question was quite legitimate, if a little un-p.c. for today&rsquo;s times, but he still has the right to ask, as could any New Zealander around their own kitchen table. Perhaps he was &#8220;pushing the envelope&#8221; to increase ratings, and his bosses fell further into the trap by suspending him. Who knows?</p>
<p>Anyhow, here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWtfbN5af4c" rel="nofollow">short video clip</a> of Paul Henry in one of his laughing fits on public television. </p>

		<p>What the TV presenter said was &#8220;out of step with demographic realities&#8221;. True, but these new demographic realities are totally out of step with what the mainstream NZ population wants.</p>
<p>What is wrong when a TV presenter speaks out loud what &#8220;most people think&#8221;?</p>
<p>Can someone out there please tell me and other Amren readers exactly WHO or WHAT is behind this insane &amp; unwanted 3rd world, Asian &amp; Islamic immigration to soveriegn western nations everywhere from Iceland to NZ and all places in between including USA &amp; Canada?</p>

		<p>Right. NOT so long ago, the policy, at least even unto the mid 1970&rsquo;s, was that to become an immigrant to NZ, you had to:</p>
<p>* Be white.<br>
* Possess a skill or know a trade that was in demand in NZ.<br>
* Deposit $5,000 American cash in a NZ bank account.</p>
<p>Then you would be allowed in the nation of NZ as an immigrant.</p>
<p>And within a certain period of time you HAD to become a NZ citizen AND if you left within that first year, you forfeited that money you had deposited in a NZ bank account.</p>
<p>NZ wanted new folks that WERE serious!</p>
<p>NZ is a small nation with a small population that for a long time has seemed to get by pretty darn well as it was.</p>
<p>NOW NZ must change. NZ MUST change. And for what?</p>

		<p>In the &#8216;Baltic Blondes Want Sex Slave Island&rsquo; article, someone wanted to know why blondes are the constant butt of jokes.  It&rsquo;s because admitting the obvious: that we can be coldly rational to the point of unsympathetic is unsettling to brunette concepts of garrulous superiority.</p>

<p>That smile is fixed on her face because she is disgusted with his childishly attention seeking behavior in a nominally adult male (and knows he probably is paid better than she is for it).</p>
<p>There is nothing funny in his obsession with animal excretia and no matter how hard he tries, he cannot get her to laugh at his stupid fixation as either an indirect come-on or &#8216;shared cultural joke&rsquo; of men&rsquo;s room level bonding.</p>
<p>The idiot fails to notice, in her reaction, that she is NOT &#8216;one of the boys&rsquo; and never will accept being demeaned to his raucious level as he acts so primitively in his uninhibited lack of social grace.</p>
<p>Instead, she clearly waits for him to recover and then, realizing he is her inferior and someone who can only be successfully excluded from disrupting the day&rsquo;s business by a &#8216;one shot&rsquo; (close up on her alone), gets on with her job: announcing the days&rsquo; news in a manner that he is clearly too immature to even comprehend.</p>

		<p>Immigrants to New Zealand, of any ethnicity, often find Paul Henry&rsquo;s puerile and sneering brand of commentary not to their taste. His humour is of the immature &#8220;middle school boy in the back of the classroom&#8221; sort and he is not of a national calibre if New Zealand wishes itself to be taken seriously.  He belongs on shock jock radio.  He is a Beavis or Butthead of the Antipodes.  He is not a morning national TV figure.  He is not some sort of hero of free speech, nor is he a defender of Western civilisation.  He spouts dumb watermelon jokes like a 13-year-old smoking weed with his mates in the sleepout.<br>
There&rsquo;s intelligent racial commentary and there&rsquo;s&hellip;..Paul Henry:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/282uzps" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/282uzps</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Self-editing for class&#8221; is just something everyone does in civilised societies, regardless of racial tensions, so that in the street at least we can all look one another in the face until better migration policy is shaped. He isn&rsquo;t some mascot for Western awakening. He is not worthy of any outrage. He just doesn&rsquo;t think he needs to self-edit even the stupidest things that come to his tiny mind. </p>
<p>That said, immigration flows into NZ have been too high, and the Kiwis on the street don&rsquo;t like it. Migration, however, is big business for the NZ Government, and it isn&rsquo;t going to change its come-hither policies anytime soon as long as migrant coins continue to drop into the coffers of their hungry welfare state.</p>

<p><br>
&gt; I wathced the clip you linked.  I don&rsquo;t see all that you conjured up here.  And unless you are a Victorian school marm, I didn&rsquo;t detect &#8220;cretinish&#8221; behavior.  That term usually infers some sort of sexist, crude, advance or verbal disgrace.  He got silly, yes, but I see newscasters become silly and joke on local stations all the time and they are just as often females.  He looked as if he got a little case of the giggles.  I have seen this happen to female newscasters.  In fact, some satellite comedy program recently aired a long clip of newscasters loosing it to giggle attacks.  There is something funny to the average human about an animal that is contantly grooming, yet using its own urine.  But perhaps some humans do too, eh?  </p>
<p>And as for some of you extrapolations here, you obviously have a problem with the male sex in general.  And yes, she is pretty, with her low top, cleavage exposing atire - not so unusal, as the just a usual suited up to the neck male counterparts fighting high blood pressure inducing necties - but she is NOT exceptionally beautiful.  Come on, you are really over-doing it.</p>

They are into drugs, hip hop, self-destructive behavior.  This is widely documented.</p>
<p>They also have delusions about being some kind of &#8216;warrior&rsquo; people and they get those outlandish tattoos to promote that idea.  Imagine when whites fall to under 50% and the Maoris feel emboldened to conquer again, with the usual brutish violence of low IQ peoples.</p>

<p>Yes, but, they are the natives of New Zealand, and deserve to retain some sort of demographic significance in that country.  Just as many of us here aren&rsquo;t worried at all about the  Indians - they were here first (don&rsquo;t mean to sound like a liberal but its still true) and their numbers are so pathetically low we need not ever fear a demographic takeover by them.  The same is true of the Maoris - they are the native people of their country, and should be respected as such, and they are not the source of the racial problem in New Zealand - Asian and other non-European immigrants are.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to make of this Henry fellow.  He sounds a bit immature, but it also sounds like he is the face of opposition to political correctness in New Zealand, and I respect him for that.  His bold and entirely agreeable remarks about Mr. Satyanand (God knows what race he is&hellip;) are encouraging to myself and, I&rsquo;m sure, many other whites who wish more were brave enough to say these things out loud. </p>
