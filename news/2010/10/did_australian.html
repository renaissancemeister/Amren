<h1>Did Australian Aborigines Reach America First?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jacqui Hayes, Cosmos Magazine (Sydney), September 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Cranial features distinctive to Australian Aborigines are present in hundreds of skulls that have been uncovered in Central and South America, some dating back to over 11,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Evolutionary biologist Walter Neves of the University of São Paulo, whose findings are reported in a cover story in the latest issue of Cosmos magazine, has examined these skeletons and recovered others, and argues that there is now a mass of evidence indicating that at least two different populations colonised the Americas.</p>
<p>He and colleagues in the United States, Germany and Chile argue that first population was closely related to the Australian Aborigines and arrived more than 11,000 years ago.</p>
<p><b>Cranial morphology</b></p>
<p>The second population to arrive was of humans of &#8216;Mongoloid&rsquo; appearance  &mdash;  a cranial morphology distinctive of people of East and North Asian origin  &mdash;  who entered the Americas from Siberia and founded most (if not all) modern Native American populations, he argues.</p>
<p>&#8220;The results suggest a clear biological affinity between the early South Americans and the South Pacific population. This association allowed for the conclusion that the Americas were occupied before the spreading of the classical Mongoloid morphology in Asia,&#8221; Neves says.</p>
<p>Until about a decade ago, the dominant theory in American archaeology circles was that the &#8216;Clovis people&rsquo;  &mdash;  whose culture is defined by the stone tools they used to kill megafauna such as mammoths  &mdash;  was the first population to arrive in the Americas.</p>
<p><b>Clovis culture</b></p>
<p>They were thought to have crossed the Bering Strait from Siberia into Alaska at the end of the last Ice Age, some 10,000 or so years ago, following herds of megafauna across a land bridge created as water was locked up in glaciers and ice sheets.</p>
<p>But in the late 1990s, Neves and his colleagues re-examined a female skeleton that had been excavated in the 1970s in an extensive cave system in Central Brazil known as Lapa Vermelha.</p>
<p>The skeleton  &mdash;  along with a treasure trove of other finds  &mdash;  had been first unearthed by a Brazilian-French archaeological team that disbanded shortly after its leader, Annette Laming-Emperare, died suddenly. A dispute between participants kept the find barely examined for more than a decade.</p>
<p>The oldest female skeleton, dubbed Luzia, is between 11,000 and 11,400 years old. The dating is not exact because the material in the bones used for dating  &mdash;  collagen  &mdash;  has long since degraded; hence, only the layers of charcoal or sediment above and below the skeleton could be dated.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe she is the oldest skeleton in the Americas,&#8221; Neves said.</p>
<p>Luzia has a very projected face; her chin sits out further than her forehead, and she has a long, narrow brain case, measured from the eyes to the back of the skull; as well as a low nose and low orbits, the space where the eyes sit.</p>
<p>These facial features are indicative of what Neves calls the &#8216;generalised cranial morphology&rsquo;  &mdash;  the morphology of anatomically modern humans, who first migrated out of Africa more than 100,000 years ago, and made it as far as Australia some 50,000 years ago, and Melanesia 40,000 years ago.</p>
<p><b>New finds in seven sites</b></p>
<p>When Neves first announced his discovery of Luzia in the late 1990s, he faced criticism from a number of archaeologists, who claimed the dating was not accurate. He has since returned to excavate four other sites, and is still cataloguing skeletons from the most recent dig.</p>
<p>In total, there are now hundreds of skeletons with the cranial morphology similar to Australian Aborigines, found in seven sites  &mdash;  as far north as Florida in the United States to Palli Aike in southern Chile.</p>
<p>In 2005, he published a paper in the U.S journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, analysing the characteristics of a further 81 skeletons he recovered from one of four sites, in which he said strengthened his argument that there were migrations to the Americas from at least two major populations.</p>
<p><b>Not related to Native Americans</b></p>
<p>In June 2010 in the journal PLoS ONE, Neves and colleagues Mark Hubbe of Chile&rsquo;s Northern Catholic University and Katerina Harvati from Germany&rsquo;s University of Tübingen, showed that it was not possible for the Aborigine-like skeletons to be the direct ancestors of the Native Americans.</p>
<p>Nor was it possible for the two populations to share a last common ancestor at the time of the first entrance into the continent, they argued, based on the 57 cranial measurements that can be made on a skull.</p>
<p>So far, almost all DNA studies of Native Americans points to a single entry from Siberia. This may mean that the original population died out, or simply that DNA studies have been too narrow, argue a number of archaeologists.</p>
<p><b>Genetic evidence needed</b></p>
<p>&#8220;The lack of a perfect match between morphological and molecular information can be easily explained by a very frequent event in molecular evolution: loss of DNA lineages throughout time,&#8221; Neves says.</p>
<p>&#8220;At first, I thought there had been a complete replacement of the population [in South America],&#8221; just as there was a replacement of a similar population in East Asia during the Pleistocene/Holocene boundary.</p>
<p>However, he now thinks that the original people were, at least partly, absorbed into the colonising groups. &#8220;I have not detected anything that could say they interbred [such as skulls exhibiting mixed cranial features].</p>
<p>&#8220;But I think we will. It would be unlikely if these people lived side-by-side for 10,000 years and did not interbreed,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Neves is now calling on molecular archaeologists  &mdash;  experts in the recovery and analysis of DNA  &mdash;  to turn their focus to the question of who Luzia&rsquo;s Aborigine-like people were.<br>

		<p>Very interesting article. Thanks for posting it. The very first wave out of Africa, and the wave that initially colonized Asia and some pacific islands such as Taiwan and the Philippines, were the race known as Negritos. They bear some relationship to South African bushman, and some say they are related to the now extinct Tasmanian aborigines. From a genetic standpoint they are very far removed from current African populations, perhaps the furthest removed of ANY human population. They are jet black, peppercorn hair and generally are very small. There are only a few existing populations, notably the Andaman Islands and most notably North Sentinel Island, where a band of about 500 have vigorously and successfully resisted all attempts at communication.</p>
<p>I suppose they could have made their way along the same route taken by later mongoloid populations. If back then they had the same character traits they now have, which is a very hostile stance toward invading and neighboring tribes, its possible they could have remained a cohesive genetic unit during their migration south from Alaska. I really don&rsquo;t think its possible that they could have sailed across the Pacific, landed on the West coast of South America, and made their way across the Andes to Brazil. That doesn&rsquo;t seem likely.</p>
<p>The Negritos can teach us a lesson. That lesson is all ethnic groups have a right to remain a cohesive and well defined unit. There&rsquo;s a place in the world for every ethnic group. The Negritos on Sentinel Island know who they are, and who they want to continue being, and where they want to be.</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;d better be careful.  The reader could determine from this article that race is not a social construct.</p>
<p>&#8220;So far, almost all DNA studies of Native Americans points to a single entry from Siberia.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because our all-powerful tribes here in WA leaned on Clinton to let them lock up the remains of Kennewick Man before any meaningful studies could be done.  Oh excuse me, I meant they were very anxious to provide a proper burial for their distant ancestor in honor with their customs, which are apparently rather flexible and by law are whatever the natives say they are on any given day.</p>

		<p>I am in agreement with most of Lonely Jews post, but I would like to add that the Negritos possibly did head far North in Asia, as I have read sometime ago that they may be the possible ancestors of the Ainu people in Hokkaido, Northern Japan. While they are largely diluted now, there are apparent close links between their art and culture. Maybe someone on here more knowledgeable can confirm or refute this?</p>

		<p>I remember a documentary I watched a few years ago on this topic. They showed generational cave drawings done by the &#8220;aborigines&#8221; - all of these painting were of hunting and drawings of their surroundings. Eventually the drawings depicticted warfare between them (Black) and another group (distinguished by painting them in a reddish/brown hue).<br>
Eventually the paintings stopped - it was surmised that the new group was victorious and commited genocide. It would seem evil white people are&rsquo;nt the only ones capable of genocide.</p>

		<p>Until they extract DNA from these &#8220;Australian&#8221; remains I refuse to believe that Australoid populations could have made their way across the Pacific - if they did why are there no modern Australoid populations in Polynesia as there are further west in Papua and elsewhere? Nor am I convinced by Lonely Jew&rsquo;s suggestion that they might have used the Alaskan route as there is no trace anywhere of Australoids outside the tropics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more likely that they came from Africa as the Atlantic is narrower than the Pacific and African morphology may, perhaps, be closer to Australoid than to Mongoloid. The snag with that idea is that Africans were so ignorant of the sea that they never discovered even the islands closest to Africa (such as Bioco, Sao Thome, Cape Verdes) until Europeans took them there as slaves.</p>
<p>So I suspect that the real origin of these ancient Brazilians is likely to remain a mystery until DNA is found.</p>

		<p>According to John R. Baker&rsquo;s excellent and scholarly book <i>Race</i>, the Australids have more primitive features than any other existing human racial group.  (Baker&rsquo;s book is of course considered hate speech today, pick up a used copy while you still can.)  The skull Neves describes, &#8220;&hellip;a very projected face; her chin sits out further than her forehead, and she has a long, narrow brain case, measured from the eyes to the back of the skull; as well as a low nose and low orbits, the space where the eyes sit,&#8221; would actually serve as a description of primitive human skulls generally.  So all he has really determined as that <i>some</i> primitive form of human settled the Americas long ago, not that they were Australids.<br>

		<p>I apologize for posting twice, but this is a subject that greatly interests me. John Bell is absolutely right&hellip; we have learned as much as we can from the skull and need DNA to help find the real truth. However, I would like point out that Negritos, and their supposed relatives the Tasmanians, could and did indeed live outside the tropics, in Taiwan which straddles the tropic of cancer and so is technically outside the tropics, and in Tasmania, which is a large and cold island south of 40 degrees south, well outside the tropics. Most Negritos, however, did and do live in the tropics. </p>
<p>I frankly have serious doubts myself that they could have migrated along the Alaskan route, mostly because it really was DAMN cold, but that&rsquo;s still MORE possible than sailing across the Pacific and crossing the Andes, which seems an impossibility. Then again, without the DNA, who knows who they really are. But its fun to speculate!</p>

		<p>It was not Australian Aborigines; rather, it was generalized humans related to the ancestors of modern Mongoloids, who did not adapt to the Siberian climate yet. Paleogenetic studies of these &#8220;Paleoamerican&#8221; skeletons found the same mtDNA haplogroups that are present both in Native Americans and Altaic Mongoloids (C, D). Furthermore, the current picture indicates that there were more than only two migration waves. This especially concerns North America, where we can find mtDNA lineages typical for Southeast Asians (B4) and even Near Eastern Caucasoids (X2). </p>

<p>We have to be really careful when we observe how folks represented themselves in these cave art. Those drawings and the coloration are often symbolic and not literal.</p>
<p>The ancient Egyptians often painted in their tombs a figure as BLACK in color. That was not a literal representation but figurative meaning the person as depicted was DEAD!</p>

		<p>Some of these comments are just wrong.</p>
<p>The early skulls are Australoid. They resemble not just Aborigines but also plot with the Ainu, Melanesians, Papuans and Negritos. </p>
<p>Those who came to the Americas were probably Ainuids. Keep in mind that at this time (11,000 YBP), all populations in NE Asia, ancestors of the Japanese, Koreans and Chinese, were Australoid types who resembled the Ainu, Melanesians, Papuans and Negritos. The Ainu are the remnants of this group. It&rsquo;s clear that they came across from Alaska. The Ainu say that when they settled Japan, there was a race of very small and darker people there. The Ainu exterminated these people, possibly some Negrito type.</p>
<p>The Ainuids were one of the progenitors of modern Aborigines. They were the Murrayans, who came to Australia 15-20,000 YBP.</p>
<p>The ancient Americans in Brazil were not Africans who came across the Atlantic. African skulls look different from Australoid skulls. These folks are Australoids.</p>
<p>Kennewick Man is not Caucasoid. His skull was extensively studied. He is part of a race that no longer exists, but he looks closest to the Moriori Polynesians and the Ainu.</p>
<p>Polynesians are 1/2 Melanesian. Melanesians are Australoids.</p>

		<p>These remains have been known about for some time. A few years ago a group of Australian fishermen in a small boat got caught in a storm and inadvertently wound up in Chile. So it&rsquo;s possible that a small band of Australian Abos made their way to South America, though it&rsquo;s doubtful it was intentional. We know they used rafts because they made it to Australia and Papua New Guinea. </p>
<p>Of course, it doesn&rsquo;t need to be pointed out to Amrenners that the fact that they can see distinct morphological features in the Abo skulls is yet another proof of the validity of race. </p>

		<p>The Aborigines are a bit of a puzzle&hellip;no one can definitively account for their presence in Australia.</p>
<p>1. We know they are an ancient people, inhabiting Oz for tens of thousands of years.</p>
<p>2. Australia separated from the mainland hundreds of millions of years ago.</p>
<p>3. The Aborigines have no history  &mdash;  oral, written, or graphic  &mdash;  of boatbuilding in their culture.</p>
<p>So the dilemma is: If they crossed over when Australia broke off and drifted away from Pangea, their history is millions of years old, which is unlikely. But if they didn&rsquo;t get there by boat, and they didn&rsquo;t evolve independently from native marsupials or lemurs over the eons, how did they get there? By raft? Aliens? The Great Spirit? Think about that riddle while you toke on your didgeridoo&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Zarathustra #3, aren&rsquo;t the Ainu caucasoid?<br>
As to the Australoid-looking immigrants to America:  Australoids seem to be, in appearance, a more primitive example of homo sapiens sapiens.  Their average IQ at 60 is higher only than African pygmies.  Any group of people who were physically more primitive than most modern ethnic groups might resemble the Australoids of today.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the novel, which is entitled White Apocalypse, a rogue anthropologist teams up with a proponent of the Solutrean Hypothesis and a fiery lawyer in order to reveal to the world the shocking truth that carries immense cultural, political, and racial significance: 17,000 years ago, white people immigrated to North and South America from Europe, and when the Amerindians arrived from the Orient by crossing the Bering Strait roughly 12,000 years ago, the latter subsequently and systematically murdered the former.&#8221; </p>

		<p>The Australoids were able to walk from New Guinea to Australia and Tasmania, because the Arafura Sea and Bass Straight were dry land during the last ice age (and islands in what is now Indonesia would have been closer together, since sea levels were lower).  They made it down the Solomons chain, but the trips over the water would have been quite short and the islands are visibile from each other as you move down the chain, which makes the next destination pretty obvious.  Australoids never reached New Zealand, however, which one would have expected had they been the sort of sailors that could reach the Americas.  Barring DNA evidence, I&rsquo;m going to call this claim baloney.  The cranial features in question could have evolved separately.  Genetic drift occurs the most rapidly in small, geographically isolated populations.</p>
<p>Where the negritos are concerned, while today there is deep water between the Andaman and Nicobar islands, during the ice age the Andamans would have been either connected to India by dry land or else only separated by a very narrow strait.</p>

1° Mongoloids came into America 11 000 Y ago.<br>
  2° Luzia is 11 000 to 11 400 Y old.<br>
 <br>
 It seems bizarre that they did not find any non-Mongoloid in America older than Luzia. So, maybe, during Ice Age 11 000 or 12 000 Y ago came simultaneously, out of NE Asia, non-Mongoloids and Mongoloids ?</p>
<p>II <br>
1° Austalian Aborigines are supposed to be a little more related to non-African humans than to Africans.<br>
2° They are supposed to be more primitive than Africans, which are supposed to be more primitive than non-Africans.</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t the two wiews slighly conflicting ?</p>

		<p>I think Robert Lindsay is on the right track here.  By the way, happy birthday Mr. Lindsay!</p>
<p>On another note, the article clearly admits that &#8220;race&#8221; is a very ancient phenomenon among humans - though it fails to stress the fact that 11,000 years is easily enough time for structural changes to have taken place so that the &#8220;evidence&#8221; of an Australian connection is weak at best.</p>

<p>mtDNA halotype X, not found in Asian populations, albeit in low levels among White European populations, is present in &#8216;Native&rsquo; American populations  &mdash;  how is that possible?&hellip;unless&hellip;..White Europeans were among the original indigenous peoples of North America.</p>
<p>Dr. Douglas Wallace, Center for Molecular Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA. reports the following:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;On the basis of comprehensive RFLP analysis, it has been inferred that approximately 97% of Native American mtDNAs belong to one of four major founding mtDNA lineages, designated haplogroups &#8220;A&#8221;-&#8220;D.&#8221; It has been proposed that a fifth mtDNA haplogroup (haplogroup X) represents a minor founding lineage in Native Americans. Unlike haplogroups A-D, haplogroup X is also found at low frequencies in modern European populations&hellip;.Among Native Americans, haplogroup X appears to be essentially restricted to northern Amerindian groups, including&hellip;.although we also observed this haplogroup in the Navajo. Median network analysis indicated that European and Native American haplogroup X mtDNAs, although distinct, nevertheless are distantly related to each other. Time estimates for the arrival of X in North America are 12,000-36,000 years ago, depending on the number of assumed founders, thus supporting the conclusion that the peoples harboring haplogroup X were among the original founders of Native American populations&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>And this, especially this:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;To date, haplogroup X has NOT been unambiguously identified in Asia, raising the possibility that some Native American founders were of Caucasian ancestry (emphasis mine)&hellip;&#8221;</p>

Unlike haplogroups A-D, haplogroup X is also found at low frequencies in modern European populations. To investigate the origins, diversity, and continental relationships of this haplogroup, we performed mtDNA high-resolution RFLP and complete control region (CR) sequence analysis on 22 putative Native American haplogroup X and 14 putative European haplogroup X mtDNAs. The results identified a consensus haplogroup X motif that characterizes our European and Native American samples. Among Native Americans, haplogroup X appears to be essentially restricted to northern Amerindian groups, including the Ojibwa, the Nuu-Chah-Nulth, the Sioux, and the Yakima, although we also observed this haplogroup in the Na-Dene-speaking Navajo. Median network analysis indicated that European and Native American haplogroup X mtDNAs, although distinct, nevertheless are distantly related to each other. Time estimates for the arrival of X in North America are 12,000-36,000 years ago, depending on the number of assumed founders, thus supporting the conclusion that the peoples harboring haplogroup X were among the original founders of Native American populations.

		<p>I&rsquo;ve always thought the Australian Aborigines were brought there by some other people, for the purpose of exiling them.  I have nothing to back that up, it just seems the evidence in their story points that direction.<br>
Ancient people engaged in war, genocide, forms of criminal justice- why not exile?</p>

		<p>Yes&hellip;.because australian aborigines are such a high functioning group today with enhanced survival value, skills and even technological advancement they can call their own.</p>
<p>Please&hellip;.the article is ludicrous even upon the simplest and most direct observation and inquiry.  If aborigines were CAPABLE of doing as the article suggests, not only would they have spread far and wide, like the europeans (instead of the europeans) they would be the obvious ancestors of peoples in these parts of the world and many other parts of the world.  They would have an advanced civilization of their own, independent of australian whites not just there, but in many other places in the world as well.</p>
<p>That has NOT happened, OBVIOUSLY.  Because they do not have the genetic &#8220;right stuff&#8221; to do as the article suggests.  Not today, not thousands of years ago.</p>
<p>For the same reason african blacks never were able to leave africa until the white man&rsquo;s civilization paved the way for them, aborigines never left australia.  if anything, other genetic lines came to them.</p>

I&rsquo;m not advocating this theory. But I could understand it as the (improbable) result of a violent storm, for instance. In that case, it would not be due to their IQ&rsquo;s but simply to weather patterns and ocean currents.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still hard to buy.</p>

		<p>Post#6 refers to the excellent book by the late Oxford professor<br>
John Randall Baker, RACE.  Essentially &#8220;depublished&#8221; after excellent sales in 1974, the book was rescued by Americans close to the Pioneer Fund and republished without revision in 1981 in the US in an ad hoc effort .  What is called for now is for a collaborate internet effort to update the text simply by annotations that reference the existing text pages and can be made reference to by current campus &#8220;thought criminals&#8221;who if merely depending upon the 1974 text will find themselves needlessly vulnerable deep in enemy territory.      </p>

		<p>Still a lot of silly comments on here.</p>
<p>First of all, these people were not necessarily Aborigines. They were most surely &#8220;Australoids.&#8221; Aborigines are part of the Australoid group, but not all of them. </p>
<p>Australoids were indeed the ancestors of many present day groups. For instance, nearly all of Asia was originally Australoid. The following groups have ancestors who were Australoids:</p>
<p>N Chinese: Ainuid type.<br>
Korean: Ainuid type<br>
Mongolian: Ainuid type<br>
Japanese: Ainuid type<br>
S Chinese: Probably Melanesian type. <br>
Filipinos: Negrito and probably Ainuid type.<br>
Thai: Negrito and Ainuid type.<br>
Other SE Asians: Melanesian type.<br>
India and Sri Lanka: Aborigine type and Veddoid type.<br>
Indonesia: Melanesian type.<br>
Polynesian and Micronesian: Melanesian type.</p>
<p>So you see, Australoids did indeed spread out over much of the world. Much of Asia that is. And it appears that Australoid Ainuid types crossed the Bering Straight to become some of the first Americans.</p>
<p>As far as IQ&rsquo;s go, I doubt if anyone had a very high IQ back then, but apparently low IQ humans managed to spread all over the globe nevertheless. </p>
<p>Africans left Africa via boat 70,000 YBP. No White men were required, and none existed anyway. Caucasoids don&rsquo;t begin until 42,000 YBP.</p>
<p>Aborigines proper were smart enough to build boats to cross to Australia 50-60,0000 YBP. They needed to cross 50 miles of open water near Timor to get to Australia, and they did so. They made it to Tasmania via boat too. Primitive people are not as stupid as you think.</p>
