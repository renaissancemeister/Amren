<h1>Tancredo&rsquo;s Giddy-Up Draws 1,300 GOP Riders</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Leslie Jorgensen, Colorado Statesman, October 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Tom Tancredo faced a rocky ride in late July when he switched political saddle brands  &mdash;  from Republican Party to American Constitution Party  &mdash;  and tossed his hat into the governor&rsquo;s race. Judging by recent polls and a record-breaking turnout at the &#8220;Tancredo Republican Round-up&#8221; on Saturday, Oct. 18, the former 6th District Congressman is leaving GOP contender Dan Maes in the dust.</p>
<p>During the ACP candidate&rsquo;s rally at The Stampede Country Dance Hall, more than 1,300 Republican revelers celebrated a Rasmussen poll showing Tancredo within four points of Democratic candidate John Hickenlooper. According to the survey conducted Oct. 14 of most likely voters, Denver Mayor Hickenlooper has 42 percent and Tancredo, 38 percent. The crowd also cheered erosion of support for Maes  &mdash;  reportedly 12 percent of voters surveyed.</p>
<p>Recalling the fallout on his decision to enter the race, Tancredo said that he needed to win an estimated 65 percent of Republican votes to win the General Election. The campaign also sought 44 percent of independent voters and 8 percent of Democrats, both goals have been surpassed according to the Rasmussen poll.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Looper and Lambert, a recent convert to Tancredo from Maes, implored folks to call their friends in El Paso County and convince them to support &#8220;the only conservative candidate&#8221; for governor  &mdash;  Tancredo. A major stumbling block in the county populated with Republicans and conservatives, Lambert said, has been the influence of The Constitutionalist Today publication that devoted most of its recent monthly issues to bolstering Maes and bashing Wadhams and the so-called Republican Party elite.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tancredo appears to be galloping to the finish line like a Pony Express rider speeding past wagon trains and stage coaches in the once Wild West. But folks at The Stampede characterized this race for governor as the &#8220;wildest&#8221; they&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>

								<h2><a href="http://www.denverpost.com/localpolitics/ci_16402747">Tancredo Ups Pressure on Maes to Quit Colorado Governor&rsquo;s Race</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Jessica Fender, Denver Post, October 22, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Would-be governor Tom Tancredo and his surrogates have run a full-court press on GOP rival Dan Maes in recent weeks, snaking supporters out from under the struggling candidate and upping pressure for Maes to exit the three-way race.</p>
<p>With the former Republican congressman within single digits of Democrat John Hickenlooper in a few public polls, some of the pressure has been overt.</p>
<p>Tancredo campaign manager Bay Buchanan recently called a Maes supporter insisting &#8220;the time is absolutely now&#8221; for Maes to give up. Others make poll-backed claims that Tancredo is the only electable conservative.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Political analysts once bearish on Tancredo&rsquo;s chances in a three-way race now say a win appears a real possibility if Maes slips into the single digits. A Maes exit would set Hickenlooper  &mdash;  the front-runner tracking in the low to mid-40s in polls  &mdash;  back on his heels, said Denver pollster Floyd Ciruli.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An Oct. 15 Rasmussen Reports poll that showed Tancredo was 4 points behind Hickenlooper, which prompted the call from Buchanan to Maes supporter Joe Harrington. The two talked several times that week about a possible Maes exit, both said.</p>
<p>Harrington proposed Maes drop out and join a hypothetical Tancredo administration, if public opinion favored it. Buchanan said any promise of that kind would violate state laws against paying political candidates to drop their election bids.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Buchanan said she was referring to planning a news conference announcing Maes&rsquo; resignation from the race, not a deal for future employment.</p>
<p>Tancredo, in the meantime, continues to pick up high-profile Republican endorsements, most recently U.S. Rep. Doug Lamborn on Thursday.</p>
<p>State Sen. Ted Harvey, one of Tancredo&rsquo;s surrogates in the legislature, said he has been on the phone every day with fellow Republicans trying to secure endorsements for Tancredo. His most effective message can be boiled down to one word: redistricting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tancredo has made a concerted effort to reach out to Tea Party-type activists as well, Buchanan said.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think Tancredo needs to pressure Maes himself to drop out.  It&rsquo;s perfectly obvious now that Maes is going nowhere, so as it gets closer to election day, his few remaining supporters will come to the realization that a vote for Maes is essentially a vote for the amnesty and open borders hack Hickenlooper, who is essentially a drop-in replacement for the failed Bill Ritter.  All Tancredo needs to do is what he has been doing, acting like a major party candidate and thumping Hickenlooper really hard.</p>
<p>Tancredo would have run as a Republican for Governor as late a a year ago, but yielded when former Congressman Scott McInnis seemed too strong.  But McInnis got beaten in the primary by Maes, who looked great at first, but eventually got hurt by scandals relating ot his business career.  Tancredo got back in on the Constitution Party ticket when it became obvious that Maes couldnt&rsquo; win, even though the conventional wisdom that Tancredo-Maes split would guarantee a Hickenlooper win.</p>
<p>This kind of thing usually happens when a RINO Republican type faces off with both a standard Democrat and a conservative third party   &mdash;   the RINOs all call the conservative third party a wasted vote and an effective vote for the Democrat.  Instead this time it&rsquo;s the other way around.</p>

		<p>A tancredo win in Colorado would be as sweet as if J.D. Hayworth had won in Arizona.  Karl Rove banned him from the White House, because he was against amnesty for illegals.</p>
<p>Many non-establishment candidates are favored for Congress also.</p>
<p>If Tancredo could win the Governorship, it just might be that the Constitution Party will be the third party that might come out of this fray.  It&rsquo;s the same party that Pat Buchanan should have joined after losing the Republican primaries years ago.  He missed the boat. </p>
<p>The Tea Party has more clout as a power to the people group, influencing races and setting the narrative for political discussion than they would if they WERE a third party.  They&rsquo;re more effective just as they are now, if they can keep the Dick Armey type Republicans from trying to hijack the party.  </p>

		<p>If were lucky, we may end up with at least three governors who aren&rsquo;t afraid to put a halt to the illegal invasion of the country. We&rsquo;ll have Brewer in AZ, Nathan Deal in GA and if we keep our fingers crossed, Tancredo in CO. Mr Tancredo has had an A+ record on immigration. He supported a moratorium on legal immigration way back in 2003, supports an end to birthright citizenship, introduced a constitutional amendment that would make English the official language, wants to defund sanctuary cities and says we need to reject the &#8220;siren song of multiculturalism.&#8221; I wish he could be governor in my state. Or better yet, the president.</p>

		<p>I wanted Tancredo to run in 2008, as well as the other strong, conservative white men that were running that year.   Plus, he was the first white republican man to make a stance against the invasion from south of the border.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s outstanding!  Just goes to show that sticking to the principles of traditional white America (a historically white nation) still can win.  </p>
<p>One thing about the prior comment that lauded a stand &#8220;against birthright citizenship&#8221;  I certainly hope you mean:  &#8221; against birthright citizenship for the children of illegal aliens&#8221;, and hope those who mean that will start saying so.  </p>
<p>I say so because I am also an American by birth, in America to American parents,  as were both of my parents, and their parents, and their parents before ~  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve changed my mind about the whole Mayes/Tancredo thing, and am hoping Mayes will drop out.  I was afraid Tancredo would end up being nothing but a spoiler, but it looks now like Mayes has that title.<br>

		<p>TANCREDO FOR PRESIDENT IN 2012</p>
<p>In modern times there have only been four types of people elected to run for President: Senators, Governors, War Heroes, and sitting VP&rsquo;s.  Tancredo&rsquo;s efforts in 2008 were impeded by him being a member of the House and not the above. His aborted campaign and endorsement of Romney was a disappointment, but time may heal some wounds, especially if he is elected to be governor in Colorado.</p>
<p>If elected Governor, he will draw full support from the immigration crowd, and possibly oppose Sarah Palin.  Palin&rsquo;s endorsement of John McCain may come back to haunt her. She has shown little appreciation of the problems of immigration and publicly campaigned for McCain. </p>
<p>Immigration, Muslims, the border are not going away in the next two years, and Tancredo&rsquo;s hard line on immigration will be only more appealing. <br>

		<p> Maes is still making the rounds of the Tea Party gatherings and such as of today, and doesn&rsquo;t seem to be at all inclined to bow out yet. I suppose he&rsquo;s a decent enough guy as politicians go, but Tancredo has shown that he is committed to his principles and has taken the heat without backing down. He&rsquo;s got my vote, and I hope enough Colorado Republicans will recognize that he is electable and Maes isn&rsquo;t.  We most certainly do not want Hickenlooper in there.</p>

		<p>I looked up the last three major polls for CO-GOV.</p>
<p>Least recent was Hick 44, Tanc 34, Maes 15.</p>
<p>Second least was Hick 42, Tanc 38, Maes 12.</p>
<p>Most recent is Hick 44, Tanc 43, Maes 9.</p>
<p>Notice that Hickenlooper can&rsquo;t get above 44.  (Once his recent foot-in-mouth gets out, see this:  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2uyawdy" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2uyawdy</a>  Then he&rsquo;ll be lucky to have 40.)  In all three polls, Tanc plus Maes is greater than Hick, and in the latest polls, Tanc plus Maes is over 50.  </p>
<p>My analysis here is that some time before the least recent poll was taken, Maes fell under critical mass, meaning his drop (and Tanc&rsquo;s rise) since then (and continuing into the future) was inevitable.  But even if the final poll before election day is something along the lines of Hick 46, Tanc 46, Maes 8, most Maes voters will vote Tanc once the rubber hits the road and their vote counts for real behind the curtains.  Happens all the time with &#8220;third party&#8221; candidates   &mdash;   Most of their support in the polls is ethereal   &mdash;   It rarely translates into real votes.  Only exception in my lifetime is Perot 1992, whose 19% of the real vote nationally was bigger than the final polls suggested.</p>
<p>What is helping Tom Tancredo in a year like this, when both major parties are unpopular, is that he&rsquo;s running as a non-Republican non-Democrat, even after a Congressional career as an &#8220;elected Republican.&#8221;  However, that&rsquo;s not a negative for him this year because everyone knows the Bush White House treated him like an enemy when they both had power, and an enemy of Bush, an opponent of liberalism and a non-R/D candidate is a really good combination of things to be in 2010.</p>

<p>She had to support McCain, because to not do so would have people calling her ungrateful.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure she would have rather seen J.D. Hayworth in as senator.</p>
<p>Why?  Because she&rsquo;s in lockstep with his views, not McCain&rsquo;s. </p>
<p>When asked by Bill O&rsquo;Reilly what she would do with illegals if she were president&hellip;&hellip;about two weeks ago&hellip;.she said flatly and to the point:  DEPORT THEM!</p>

		<p>7 Anon and 10 ice:</p>
<p>The conventional wisdom is that Palin endorse McCain over Hayworth in AZ-SEN-R because she &#8220;had to,&#8221; or that she was in a sort of check mate.  For two months in 2008, she went around the country telling everyone who great a President John McCain would have been, but &#8220;then you don&rsquo;t even think he can be a good Senator?&#8221; if she endorses Hayworth in 2010.  </p>
<p>Maybe she would have gotten such flack, but I don&rsquo;t care.  These aren&rsquo;t games to me, public offices aren&rsquo;t toys to me.  They are real life with real consequences to real people who will never care a second about politics or donate a penny to politicians.  Palin throwing in with McCain over Hayworth, very likely because of the conventional wisdom, proves that she&rsquo;s only in the game to be in the game.  She only wants to acquire power for the power itself, not because of any real principles, especially not immigration.  Therefore, she doesn&rsquo;t deserve any power.</p>
<p>Prediction:  You can count the seconds on one hand that it will take McCain to start calling for amnesty and open borders after the media declare him the winner of another Senate term.  </p>

<p>It isn&rsquo;t possible to stand entirely on principle alone in order to achieve the results a person wants.  Diplomacy and discretion are what are necessary to enter into a type of guerilla warfare regarding politics.</p>
<p>The libs are masters at it.  Nothing that comes across their lips is what they really think unless they inadvertently reveal what they&rsquo;re really all about.</p>
<p>Guerilla fighting isn&rsquo;t just for successful military situations, it has to be employed in a world where a true statesman is eaten alive by lies from his opponents for uttering simple elements of truth.</p>
<p>Sarah Palin is a very valuable spokesperson, who is FAR more intelligent than a lot of people give her credit for.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be surprised if the evolving situation doesn&rsquo;t alter the views of McCain substantially.  Too, he would have been re-elected with or without Sarah Palin&rsquo;s endorsement.  He&rsquo;s just too firmly entrenched in Ariz.  I can guarantee you that forces are at work to pressure him to drop his alliances with Democrats like Leiberman.</p>
<p>In the last analysis, I don&rsquo;t really believe anything will change the collapse of this country.  My efforts are directed toward building unity among whites, and Sarah Palin is instrumental in doing that.  You&rsquo;ll see what I mean as we get into 2011 and especially 2012, about the time our austerity riots occur like France, Spain, Greece and Britain are having right now.  </p>

<p>I am sorry to say the Tea Party has way too much clout among Whites in this country. The blind leading the blind. Their &#8220;influence&#8221; seems to be promoting nothing but BLACK candidates! They trot them out at all their rallies as proof they are not &#8220;racists&#8221;. They will kill this country as much as the libtards. To them, a White racist is the most evil person on earth. To them, race has nothing to do with the America the Founder&rsquo;s envisioned. They can talk about the Constitution all they want, yet they haven&rsquo;t a clue that Constitution was set up for WHITES only.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a sort of cross between a paleoconservative and White Nationalist and I will readily admit that I don&rsquo;t like Sarah Palin politically.  I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s a nice lady and I like her Christian background and her views on abortion and gun rights. Other issues she&rsquo;s not been so clear on like immigration.  In fact she said during the election campaign two years ago she didn&rsquo;t think that illegals should be deported.  I&rsquo;m also fearful she would get us involved in another war in the Middle East.  Sources say she voted for Pat Buchanan when he was running for President but only Sarah Palin herself would know how she really voted and this could have been leaked to the press to give her non-existant credentials with the traditional right.  She didn&rsquo;t have to campaign for John McCain out of loyalty since he hasn&rsquo;t endorsed her for President.  She has the foul stench of neoconservatism about her and I fear if she ran for President she&rsquo;d turn out to be George Bush in a skirt.  Surely there are better candidates out there like Ron Paul.</p>

		<p>I hope Amren readers understand the implication of this election.</p>
<p>You have here a VERY clear threat to the GOP.  Basically, the threat (not message&hellip;.threat) from the &#8220;new republicans&#8221; to the GOP old guard is &#8220;we are taking over&#8221; and our agenda, not yours is what the republican party will be focused on for now on.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t cooperate, we will split off as a third party.  Initially, the communists will have an advantage as a significant minority still vote republican&hellip;.until they realize the third party is for real and plans to do what they want instead of what the old guard GOP has done in the past&hellip;..then the republican party will cease to exist.  And maybe that&rsquo;s a good thing.  Maybe the majority of &#8220;republican&#8221; voters think that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>In other words&hellip;.we don&rsquo;t need you to win&hellip;.eventually.  And we are going to prove it right here, right now, in this election.  By 2012, we WILL be running the show.  And the agenda will be far more radical and out in the open, by then.</p>
<p>Why is that important to race realists?  Because the opportunity is now.  If we get on board, that agenda could be made a white nationalist agenda&hellip;..or something pretty close to it.</p>
<p>At the very least, a major step toward white empowerment could be taken&hellip;&hellip;by a nation willing to use any means necessary to round up and expel foreign invaders.</p>
<p>Think about.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t worry too much about McCain. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wish death upon anyone, but I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll see the end of his next six year term. I think he&rsquo;ll go the Ted Kennedy and Robert Byrd way before then, and guess who will be making the appointment to his post after his age, his time in Vietnam, and his battles with melanoma catch up with him: Governor Jan Brewer.</p>
<p>Not to mention, McCain is a politician (and a half) before anything else, and he&rsquo;ll sail where ever the political winds are blowing including into the arms of the Tea Party and support against &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The Tea Party does not need to become race-oriented.  All the Tea Party needs to do is to adopt fair and good (economically efficient and productive) policies, such as basing all advancement not on skin color, but on merit, requiring virtually everyone to work and to pay taxes (people who pay no taxes, have no incentive to control government spending), closing open borders, putting America first, bringing back jobs to America, hiring American citizens instead of foreigners, ending out-sourcing, dramatically lowering the size and costs of all governments, reducing taxes, stop meddling around the word, and ending all deficit spending. </p>
<p>This is just a short list, but all of these items lead to a better economy, which makes life better for all USA Citizens. We can never end deficit spending if we continue to import poverty from Mexico, and reward poverty by paying the poor to remain poor.  </p>

		<p>Tancredo does not have any charisma whatsoever. He cannot even speak properly and bumbles all over the place. It&rsquo;s like he is even afraid to say the truths in many instances. I saw him on TV yesterday and I was embarrassed for him as he tried to put his sentences together.</p>
<p> If I remember correctly he kind of backed down on illegal immigration and deportation. Then he makes sure he says that the Mexican citizens are great people and contribute much to our society. HOGWASH! He doesn&rsquo;t have a clue.</p>
<p> He is too weak and we need someone who is strong and stands up for the White race, you know, the ones this nation was founded for. Tancredo also voted for TARP!  Let us get a STRONG, intelligent White racialist and support him for once. </p>

		<p>I wish Sara Palin weren&rsquo;t so divisive, but it seems that nowadays in this country opinions on everything from A - Z are automatically disagreed with by a 50 to 50 margin. I&rsquo;ve never in my life seen the country so split on every possible thing that passes our paths. </p>
<p>That said, I believe that virtually anyone who resonates with a large group of Americans  - and Palin does - and who touts defeat of the Democrats, can be useful to race realists. Regardless of why people like Palin - even if it is air-headed women who just love her glasses, or men who love her looks - a vote against democrats is the most useful for whites. I know the Republicans are little better and most of them need voted out, as well, but Democrats spell absolute death to this country, if it isn&rsquo;t already too late. Perhaps - PERHAPS - the best we can do in this particular election is to keep the left at bay until more Americans become aware of the dangers facing them under Obama&rsquo;s administration; when more Americans will have been educated as to the ultimate danger facing them if they don&rsquo;t change their direction. If Sara Palin is a part of that, I welcome her.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I will readily admit that I don&rsquo;t like Sarah Palin politically. I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s a nice lady and I like her Christian background and her views on abortion and gun rights. Other issues she&rsquo;s not been so clear on like immigration. In fact she said during the election campaign two years ago she didn&rsquo;t think that illegals should be deported.&#8221; </p>
<p>About a month ago, via a one on one interview, Oreilly asked her what she would do with the illegals in this country and she EMPHATICALLY STATED without hesitation:  DEPORT THEM! </p>
<p>Too, consider that the prevailing knowledge among insiders is that Sarah Palin&rsquo;s main goal right now is to unite conservatives against the left.  She is working toward that end without modifying her positions.  </p>
<p>There will be a third party probably by 2012, but it won&rsquo;t be the Tea Party, and Sarah Palin ISN&rsquo;T planning on running right now.  If the party stays true to its goals, it would rather act as an influencing force, which it has done remarkable well so far.</p>
<p>And as far as blacks are concerned, does anybody really believe they&rsquo;ll stick around in anything but minimal numbers if the agenda remains based in traditional American values?</p>
