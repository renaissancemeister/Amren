<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Buried in the annual Coast Guard authorization act passed this week by Congress is wording that would strike from the U.S. Code the statement that all appointments to the Coast Guard Academy &#8220;shall be made without regard to the sex, race, color or religious beliefs of an applicant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under current federal law the academy is &#8220;race neutral,&#8221; but the change would put it on the same footing as other colleges and universities in balancing its enrollment by admitting students from specific groups.</p>
<p>The other military service academies admit students by congressional nomination, while the Coast Guard Academy has traditionally admitted students on the basis of academic merit, like civilian colleges and universities.</p>
<p>Lawmakers, often critical of the lack of diversity at the academy, were attempting to increase the diversity of the student body by bringing the school&rsquo;s admissions process in line with those of the other service academies. But they backed off that proposal, and it was not included in the compromise version of the act.</p>
<p>Now it appears they are giving the academy some latitude to diversify its student body and meet their expectations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Students from racial and ethnic minority groups made up 24 percent of the class of 2014 at the start of this summer. But the percentage of minorities in each class has traditionally hovered around 15 percent. The school has fared better with women, who typically make up about 30 percent of each class.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the percent of Asians at the CG Academy is. I would think for many Asians, the academics would be a breeze. Whether they are into the strenous water survival and combat readiness, I don&rsquo;t know. I do know that blacks aren&rsquo;t going to swim any more in the Atlantic Ocean than they do in the local Martin Luther King swimming pool.</p>
<p>As for the genius legal manipulation &#8220;&hellip;[b]uried in the annual Coast Guard authorization act passed this week by Congress is wording that would strike from the U.S. Code the statement that all appointments to the Coast Guard Academy &#8216;&ldquo;shall be made without regard to the sex, race, color or religious beliefs of an applicant.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>A normal person would think this bans affirmative action. But look at the misnamed Civil Rights Act of 1964. A person who has observed liberal courts, bureaucrats and colleges since 1964 would say that unqualified blacks who can&rsquo;t swim and don&rsquo;t want to fight Columbian drug thugs will find they are CG cadets.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether many Asians attend the Coast Guard Academy either.  But as an FYI, Asians no longer count as &#8220;diversity&#8221; in an increasing number of institutions of higher learning; so a lack of &#8220;diversity&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t necessarily imply a lack of Asians.  You&rsquo;ll hear multicults complain of a lack of &#8220;diversity&#8221; or &#8220;minority enrollment&#8221; at places like UCLA, where Asians actually outnumber Whites.  I kid you not.  &#8220;Diversity&#8221; now describes the  the size of enrollment of under-talented minorities  &mdash;  not the degree of difference  &mdash;  cultural, religious, linguistic, ect.  &mdash;  between the students who earned their spots.</p>

		<p>I have mentioned this before. These &#8220;minority&#8221; Congressmen and women are not filling their quotas for appointments to the service academies. For whatever combination of reasons, they see the U.S. and the U.S. military as a pernicious influence and are steering able young persons away from military service. That is what I perceive. That would include Coast Guard.</p>

		<p>Not to be rude or nothin&rsquo; but between the sheer -machismo- of the cultures in many likely deployment areas (if not the Carribean then certainly the Med and PG) and the fact that this is not easy stuff to do-</p>
<p>CG 47ft rescue boat go through big surf</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/27tpw5t" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/27tpw5t</a></p>
<p>I would really rather have a white, male, face staring down the barrel of a .50 at the threat or tossing the line to a victim than a black/female one.</p>
<p>As the video illustrates, you need to be pretty deft in the brains department to read into the oncoming wave states &#8216;a hole&rsquo; sufficient to get someone aboard in.  You also have to have enough strength that you are not just a rag doll on the safety line when the boat is going through 60+ degrees of up and down pitch in just a few seconds.</p>
<p>Blacks have the strength but I question whether a large proportion of them have the intelligence to run a boat and if they don&rsquo;t (or if they don&rsquo;t -want- to, as a function of personal drive) why are they there?</p>
<p>Women on their period, pregnant or just plain small framed are also not fit for sea duty (remember the &#8216;Loveboat&rsquo; auxilliary that came back from Desert Storm with something like 30% of the crew pregnant?) and instantly create gender issues in a tight crew.</p>
<p>I am reminded of &#8216;Police Academy&rsquo; where the little, mouse voiced, black woman turned into a tiny tyrant when she got mad.  Unfortunately, this isn&rsquo;t a fight or flight condition and if you don&rsquo;t have the reserves of willpower and physical strength, on a day in and day out basis, to do the job; you will wear yourself out trying to pretend and then the CG is down a man that should never have been there to begin with and was taken on solely to (dis)prove a non existent debate point.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the other threat: whites that aren&rsquo;t comfortable or see no future in their profession because unqualified minorities or genders are &#8216;promoted out&rsquo; to desk jobs ashore which the whites might otherwise have treated as an mid/end phase career upgrade once they were no longer part of the sea going fleet.</p>
<p>There are a lot fewer of these positions in the CG which means that if you want the full retention from your veteran CG force of _white males_, you need to leave a career track open that keeps them in the uniform and a visible symbol to those below them as to what is achievable &#8216;within the system&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Point Blank: Once quality cedes to quotas, we know &#8216;the next step&rsquo; is lowering the physical or mental aptitude requirements to ensure a given outcome.  But as the sea is a constant which brooks neither weakness nor fools, diversity = stupidity as it&rsquo;s own justification becomes a disaster waiting to happen.  Let the candidates earn their anchors or let them fail on their own, as always.</p>

		<p>Minorities vs. the Coast Guard Academy has been going on nearly half a century now, since John F. Kennedy saw the cadets parading at his inaugural in 1961 and objected that they were too white.</p>
<p>Most of my antecedents were Irish-Catholics like Kennedy&rsquo;s and his thinking makes my flesh crawl.  Apparently the motive power of his life and that of his family was to &#8220;get even&#8221; and to supplant the very Anglo-Saxon Protestants who had been generous to him and provided him with the means to succeed.  Many &#8220;minorities&#8221; have the same attitude:  not gratitude or appreciation, but revenge for perceived slights. </p>
<p>White Anglo-Saxon Protestants wrote the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and established our national and state Governments,industries, and institutions.  They welcomed all peoples to the great nation they created.  Now the beneficiaries of their good-will want to replace them.</p>
<p>The decline of white people in the U.S. can be traced to the inauguration of JFK. </p>

<p>I think that JFK and his immediate family saw themselves as onetime recipients of discrimination and had a &#8220;soft-spot&#8221; for the downtrodden, whoever they at any moment felt were downtrodden. Since JFK had power, he was attempting to make amends, etc. That was the mindset the whole family had.</p>

		<p>THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOW THE MORTAL ENEMY OF ALL WHITE PEOPLE.</p>
<p>Jobs, education, housing, etc., white people are slowly being excluded.  I know of 20 young white men with BS and MS degrees who cannot find any kind of job, yet my daughter&rsquo;s black friends from college did not have any problem finding jobs.  My son cannot find an accounting job after being laid off from his job four years ago.  I was laid off to make way for a minoriety worker who I was forced to train.  Its is time to Partition America into two seperate nations.  We have the right to our own homeland here in North America like other minorieties do.  Its our destiny.</p>

		<p>#7: Most Degrees today aren&rsquo;t worth the paper they&rsquo;re printed on. </p>
<p>Why would anyone College Student today go for Liberal Arts, Communications, and other useless Degrees, which just put money into the pockets of Colleges, while burdening these Students with crippling Student Loans?</p>
<p>I believe that all Middle and High School students should get a Classical Education, which features the learning of Latin, as well as English Literature, Math, Sciences, actual History as it happened, a second European Language, such as French, Italian, Spanish, German, or Greek. </p>
<p>Along with these subjects they should be intructed in Basic Plumbing, Carpentry, Electricity, and Masonry work, to either get a skilled job in the Trades, which cannot be outsourced, or at least, be able to maintain their homes. </p>
<p>All people should start form social networks to trade skills as forms of payment, and must start thinking on relying on each other, instead of profitting from one another. This allows people to maintain their independence from Government, while still keeping their social bonds in tact.</p>
