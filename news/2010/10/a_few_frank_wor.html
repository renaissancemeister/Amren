<h1>A Few Frank Words About Immigration</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Margaret Wente, Globe and Mail (Toronto), October 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Of all the issues of concern to the future of Toronto, there&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s off limits during this mayoral election. It&rsquo;s so taboo that nobody will even say the word. It&rsquo;s I-M-M-I-G-R-A-T-I-O-N.</p>
<p>Immigration has helped make Toronto one of the most successful and diverse cities in the world. That&rsquo;s the good news. The bad news is, a lot of immigrants aren&rsquo;t doing well. Many of them live in what are known as &#8220;priority neighbourhoods,&#8221; where unemployment is high and incomes are low. The number of people receiving social assistance has gone up. Although the city has no say in immigration policy, it pays the bills. Meantime, another 100,000 immigrants are arriving in the city every year.</p>
<p>This is not a rant. It&rsquo;s a plea for honest conversation. And that&rsquo;s sometimes hard to have. Just ask the people who launched the Centre for Immigration Policy Reform last week. They think our immigration policies could be better. The NDP immediately attacked them for being &#8220;un-Canadian.&#8221; One immigration lawyer called the group a bunch of grumpy old white men who&rsquo;d be hard to take seriously &#8220;were it not for their ability to fan the flames of intolerance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Who are these intolerant un-Canadians? One is James Bissett, who used to head the Canadian Immigration Service. Another is Martin Collacott, a former ambassador to Sri Lanka, Syria, Lebanon and Cambodia. A third is Derek Burney, Canada&rsquo;s ambassador to the U.S. during the free-trade talks.</p>
<p>I asked Mr. Burney why he got involved. &#8220;I fully agree that the system is broken,&#8221; he says. &#8220;There&rsquo;s too much abuse, too much fraud, and no rhyme or reason about what we&rsquo;re doing. It&rsquo;s just a numbers game.&#8221;</p>
<p>Canada admits 250,000 immigrants a year, a higher rate than any other country. Why? No one can say. It&rsquo;s not to raise the birth rate or replace our aging workers  &mdash;  the numbers don&rsquo;t work out that way. Is it to create wealth and improve our productivity? If so, it isn&rsquo;t working.</p>
<p>Mr. Burney argues that current immigration policies are dragging down our productivity, not increasing it. The two fastest-growing groups in our population are aboriginals and new immigrants. &#8220;They&rsquo;re also the ones with the fewest skills to perform in our economy,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Our system is supposed to select for success. But only 17 per cent of new arrivals are fully assessed on the basis of their employment and language skills. Half never meet a visa officer at all. Most of the people we bring in are &#8220;family class&#8221; immigrants, including parents and grandparents. The Centre for Immigration Policy Reform estimates that recent immigrants receive billions of dollars a year more in benefits than they pay in taxes. &#8220;We&rsquo;re building a problem of enormous proportions,&#8221; Mr. Burney says.</p>
<p>The prevailing narrative is that if immigrants are doing badly, the fault must be ours. They&rsquo;re held back by subtle discrimination, we don&rsquo;t recognize their credentials and so on. No doubt there&rsquo;s some truth in this. But the greater truth is that making a go of it in a postindustrial knowledge-based economy isn&rsquo;t easy. Success depends on sophisticated language and communication skills  &mdash;  along with knowledge of local networks  &mdash;  that many newer immigrants never acquire. And their kids? Their success depends largely on &#8220;ethnic capital,&#8221; a culture that values education and expects kids to excel. Kids from cultures with lots of ethnic capital do vastly better than kids from cultures that have little.</p>
<p>No political parties, not even the Conservatives, are in any hurry to debate how many, and who, we bring in. After all, they need the ethnic votes. So the debate has been largely ceded to the immigration industry  &mdash;  an army of lawyers and consultants who try to shut it down by calling people nasty names.</p>
<p>&#8220;That doesn&rsquo;t bother me,&#8221; Mr. Burney says with a laugh. &#8220;During the free-trade debate, they called me a traitor.&#8221; A number of people have also quietly thanked him for opening his mouth. Politicians may not welcome this debate. But plenty of Canadians think it&rsquo;s long overdue.<br>

		<p>This isn&rsquo;t about votes. Both left and right parties court immigrants, but neither can predict the long-term ballot choices of immigrants or their children.</p>
<p>Immigration is about consumerism and speculative investing. International finance wants Europe and North America flooded with millions of Third World consumers of globally-traded commodities. Political parties are steered into compliance by incentives and disincentives exerted by powerful unelected elites.</p>
<p>It is a global Ponzi scheme unparalleled in human history. </p>

<p>Does Canada even <i>have</i> White immigrants any more?</p>
<p><i>After all, they need the ethnic votes.</i></p>
<p>The usual tripe, just like amerika.  The rationale supplied by the political powers that be for their unshakable Marxism is that without &#8220;the ethnic vote,&#8221; they just can&rsquo;t possibly get elected.  As though White people aren&rsquo;t even allowed to vote any more.</p>
<p>Oh, wait   &mdash;   that&rsquo;s next, isn&rsquo;t it?<br>

<p>Immigration is a policy of genocide against white people,  it has little to do with economics or votes or even politics.  It&rsquo;s an irrational policy of a fanatical religious nature,  that seeks to eliminate the sin of racism, by which is meant the existence of white people.   The victims of this genocidal racism are either too beaten down or have absorbed too much the hatred of their masters to even object to their elimination,  they have to couch their objections in economic or political terms (and just how many ethnic votes do immigration supporting  Conservatives get in Canada, anyway?).  Pure fear.  Nothing will change until immigration policy is openly opposed as genocidal racism, not as bad economics.   What is needed in Canada is equivalent of a draw Mohamed day about the real nature of immigration policy and what&rsquo;s really objectionable about it:  they can&rsquo;t put everybody in jail. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s hard to talk frankly about immigration when we are afraid and ashamed to talk frankly about Canada or ourselves as individuals. Who can handle the blunt honesty of personal exposure? How many like being called cowards, small-minded, jealous etc. even though we all possess these traits in good measure. For centuries it was a strength of Christendom in the West to remind people of our fallen state. We seem to have lost this honesty. And what is Canada after all? We don&rsquo;t have to live by our wits because we are a resource economy. We export oil. When we need money we dig up or pump up some stuff and sell it. Canada lives off royalty money. The employment of we puny human Canadians is mostly to squabble amongst each other over who is going to get the bigger share of this unearned wealth.</p>
<p>How does it feel after the myths have been stripped away? Now - what is it that immigrants are supposed to be adding to our country?</p>

		<p>If we had a law that only people BORN in the country had a right to vote it would make a HUGE difference. Anyone not born in Canada - even if they subsequently become citizens - should never be allowed to vote. This simple measure would keep vote chasing politicians from pandering to these ethnic foreigners.</p>

		<p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper is as much a traitor as the ones before him.</p>
<p>Courting the minority vote and continuing the mass immigration.</p>
<p>The boatload of Tamils was admitted.</p>
<p>The boat should have been escorted back out to sea by the Canadian Navy.</p>
<p>There is not much hope for the white race in Canada so long as there are traitor leaders like Stephen Harper, Michale Ignatief and Jack Layton.</p>
<p>The media controls the minds of those that cannot think for themselves and we see the result.</p>

<p>No, America admits more immigrants than any nation on earth. To our detriment. Some say one million a year but it is more like TWO million a year! That doesn&rsquo;t even count the millions of illegals and refugees we admit to our country!</p>

<p>I think the reference was to percent.  I think Canada admits about 250,000 to a small population of 34 million</p>
<p>The USA admits numberically more but in terms of percent of the population a much smaller amount.  USA has a population of ten times that of Canada.  But not ten times the immigration, at least not legal.</p>

		<p>Toronto has 43% of poor people, mostly brown and black immigrants with few or no skills. The unemployment rate is over 10% in Canada and the subemployment rate likely 15-20%. The municipalities spend tons of money on welfare, rent subsidies and food banks. The crime stats by the Toronto Police show easily 80-90% of coloured criminals but the polticians of all parties pretend to not see the problems. Immigration by white Europeans made Canada great and the third world flood will do the excact opposite.</p>

		<p>The &#8216;ethnic vote&rsquo; is obviously not the reason. They often don&rsquo;t even have very high rates of voting. Even if there were one or two parties going after their vote, there would clearly be room for a party in Canada that appealed to white Canadians, just as there are different kinds of the same product aimed at different types of market. <br>
There are several reasons why third-world immigration has to remain high. Some of them, like reducing labour costs, can just about be discussed. But there are other more sinister reasons that are still a long way from getting into the public domain.</p>
