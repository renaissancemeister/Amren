<h1>Racism Seen in Move to Close Charlotte Schools</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ann Doss Helms, Charlotte Observer, October 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A proposal by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools [CMS] to close eight urban schools, where less than 10 percent of the total enrollment is white, has sparked bitter debate and action by state and local NAACP leaders accusing CMS of racism.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t know how widespread it is, but the people who are angry about it are extremely angry,&#8221; said county commissioners&rsquo; Chairwoman Jennifer Roberts, who attended a recent NAACP meeting where leaders urged about 200 people to fight school-closing plans, going to jail if necessary.</p>
<p><b>Targeted for closure</b></p>
<p>Hundreds of parents, including many from the suburbs and affluent in-town neighborhoods, have protested recent changes in boundaries and magnet programs.</p>
<p>But talk of closings takes anxiety to a new level. Superintendent Peter Gorman has suggested closing eight of CMS&rsquo; 176 schools. They&rsquo;re home to about 4,000 students  &mdash;  mostly black, Hispanic and low-income.</p>
<p>Gorman said the schools were tagged because they have empty classrooms or academic failings. And with budget cuts looming, he said, it&rsquo;s better to sacrifice buildings than teachers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&rsquo;t target any one group,&#8221; Gorman said last week. &#8220;What we&rsquo;re doing is targeting problems, and our problem is the financial challenge.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Historic echoes</b></p>
<p>But to some, it&rsquo;s the latest twist in a cycle of discrimination that dates back to Jim Crow schools, continued with urban renewal projects that razed black neighborhoods, and gathered new force when courts dismantled CMS&rsquo; desegregation plan about 10 years ago.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Rev. William Barber, president of the N.C. conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, came to Charlotte last week to help plan follow-up action. He says Charlotte&rsquo;s national prominence and historic position as a leader in the quest for desegregation makes it the ideal place for a long-term fight against neighborhood schools isolated by race and income.</p>
<p>&#8220;Resegregation of schools is the enemy of educational excellence,&#8221; he said Friday.</p>

		<p>Interesting article, but the black people don&rsquo;t/won&rsquo;t understand the problems because those problems are far too difficult for them to handle. They have no concept of budgets or how things work. Their whole concept of life revolves around them getting what they want and thwarting White people who they believe are out to do them wrong. So to argue points rationally with them and show them charts with figures on them is a fools errand to say the least. Shut the schools and lock up the blacks who make trouble about it and that&rsquo;ll take care of the situation. Soon afterwards, the blacks will loose interest and they&rsquo;ll settle down until the next crisis in their childlike minds.</p>

		<p>while I find Brown v Board of Ed to be sociological,Marxist nonsense, if the NAACP wants to continue to believe that having blacks physically view whites in the classroom helps blacks learn, fine. But my black brothers, demand for a product commands a price in our capitalist system, as fine captains of industry like &#8220;Jay Z&#8221; and &#8220;Diddy&#8221; would attest. (If they could spell attest).</p>
<p>So pony up My Man. Twenty grand, per year, for prime white beef in your classroom. You&rsquo;ll have lots of steers to choose from at that price. You can get Uncle Barry to pay the freight; or at least he can get the &#8220;congress&#8221;,no matter who wins in November to pay. Cause we&rsquo;re all for diversity, and diversity,which the NAACP is for,and for, and for, can&rsquo;t also mean segregation, Right?</p>
<p>Just pay up. At twenty grand/per annum for 12 years invested wisely, a white family could move out of this &#8220;diverse&#8221; country and leave the brothers (and their ever-multitudinous brown brothers) to look at each other in what&rsquo;s left of the classrooms. Find some &#8220;self-esteem&#8221;, you know what I mean? </p>
<p>This all makes sense, huh?</p>

<p>The irony of this statement is that the closing of these ten schools will very likely result in other Charlotte schools becoming more &#8220;racially diverse.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is an ambiguous statement but I think the reporter is attempting to impart emotion and moralism into her opening sentence. What she seems to be saying is that if you are a minority, at 10 percent of the enrollment, you shouldn&rsquo;t really count. Or really, perhaps what she is saying is that whites never really count no matter what. Unless of course she was trying to be wickedly ironic. In which case shouldn&rsquo;t the NAACP be calling for her job? </p>

		<p>The NC NAACP&rsquo;s memorable performance during the Duke lacrosse rape hoax fiasco is revealing as to the core values of the organization. These values we can expect to be expressed in this latest quest.</p>
<p>Stuart Taylor is a columnist for the National Journal and a contributing editor for Newsweek. Taylor co-authored &#8220;Until Proven Innocent: Political Correctness and the Shameful Injustices of the Duke Lacrosse Rape Case&#8221; with K.C. Johnson.  Here is Taylor&rsquo;s assessment of the the NC NAACP:</p>
<p>&#8220;The local [state-level] NAACP and other local black leaders  &mdash;  enough to be a critical mass  &mdash;  basically crusaded to attack the lacrosse players.  They joined the mob. They misrepresented the truth regularly, repeatedly, and grossly.  They supported the rogue prosecutor long after he had been proven a rogue prosecutor &hellip; they threw away whatever shreds were left of their own credibility.&#8221;  (BookTV.org presentation on Until Proven Innocent, Sept. 11, 2007.  Click on &ldquo;Watch&rdquo; in the upper right corner; NAACP material is 3/4&rsquo;s into presentation):<br>

		<p>What no one wants to say is that the black students will learn about the same amount whether they attend those schools or stay home and watch TV.  The purpose of keeping the schools open has nothing to do with educating students.  Blacks want to keep the schools open so as to employ affirmative action black teachers and staff.  Whites want to keep them open so the black kids don&rsquo;t wind up ruining the white schools.  Unfortunately budgetary realities are preventing both groups from getting what they want.<br>

		<p>If this Barber thinks that &#8220;resegregation of schools is the enemy of educational excellence&#8221;, then how can he explain the fact that in integrated schools, Bantus and Latinos have lower test scores than Caucasians and Orientals? This is true in all 50 states.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve NEVER understood how a black student sitting next to a Caucasian or Oriental student, is supposed to make him/her smarter.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not just the voodoos, but the latinos too who have no concept about budgets and where money comes from.  I was having a conversation today with some latinos I know (mostly nice people btw) who boasted they get &#8216;free&rsquo; checks from the government to pay for their food.</p>
<p>I pointed out that it wasn&rsquo;t free and that it was being paid for by my tax dollars.  You know what one of them said?  He thought for a second and then said, &#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wow.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because proper folks would say white schools have greater funding. And that, even sending white students, to black schools, will increase there funding.</p>
<p>This ignores the fact that during segregation black schools had as much money per pupil as white schools, sometimes slightly more. And it ignores the fact that most schools in the inner city/major cities (where blacks are more likely to attend) have had way higher levels of funding per pupil than suburban school for the last 30 years or more. The media and researchers and school teachers (especially those training other teachers) themselves will never tell you this, using any fact to most profusely tell you quite the opposite tale, whenever possible. Really, it&rsquo;s black victimology total submersion. It might even be said to be the science of black male victimology. Is it designed for blacks or for the ears of whites, so we look away and feel quite the opposite feelings, we apologize as our country is stolen? </p>

		<p>They only way out of this is to look at two issues:</p>
<p>1.  How many kids per classroom (and bussing fees) will there be if these eight schools are closed?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s more than 20, it&rsquo;s not a workable solution.  I grew up in a world of temp buildings out back the main school (damn cold in a Colorado winter) and 40-50 kid classrooms.  I wouldn&rsquo;t wish that on any child or teacher, even all-white.</p>
<p>2.  How much money could be saved if state tax credits could be issued to privatize education altogether?  </p>
<p>As by keeping education a block-by-block driven local affair.  If you outright REMOVE the hateful stigma of institutionalized day care and instead make a stay-at-home mother&rsquo;s mortgage payment a little easier as you convert her basement to a classroom and put a respectable 10-20 kids it it, twice a day.  </p>
<p>Give these kids school days that are roughly equal to their attention spans: 3-4hrs with _immersive_ learning that doesn&rsquo;t follow a rote-spiral technique of reteaching what you have forgotten from last month, last week or last Monday.</p>
<p>Really smart kids who use this system can get YEARS ahead of conventional school system grade leveling.  And then the next day you do Math.  Then History and Science and Arts and Languages.  As block segments with hill climb and plateau competency phases.</p>
<p>All with the highest accredited teachers you can find, who rotate between these private classes on a daily or weekly basis (why it&rsquo;s important to concentrate on single-study classes every day).</p>
<p>There is no &#8216;vacation&rsquo; time.  Kids don&rsquo;t effectively vegetate for 3 months every summer.  But nor are they chained to their desks as with modern school systems for 8-9 hours a day but could instead have 4 day weeks with floating 2 week vacation every month or two, when it was convenient to their families.</p>
<p>When they reach a certain age, you shift to college prep and outright adult level business/vocational/tech courses based on personal evaluations, using internet relay of campus based professors.  Even if it&rsquo;s just an audited course.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s VERY important that we start putting a lot more emphasis on early SAT and Collegiate preparation thru deep subject immersion so that when our kids hit highschool, they can test out early and get a leap on colleges where AA may be a restricting factor and multiple applications are necessary.  IOW: we have to go Asian.</p>
<p>And of course, if it&rsquo;s private, it&rsquo;s not paying for an overhead of expensive buildings and district level bureaucracy which just vacuums funds for idiots.  It&rsquo;s also not subject to racial engineering as a function of quotas in class rooms.  i.e. Segregation can be defacto complete within a community driven shielded environment where our kids can be students first.</p>
<p>Since our States haven&rsquo;t the authority to override Federal law in creating such a voucher system and Federal law is destroying our futures by LCD dumb down, we must be ready to do this on our own.</p>
<p>Speaking of which: @8 Soprano Fan.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about learning better through osmosis of white ideals.  It&rsquo;s about isolating blacks from each other so that they feel intimidated to the point that they don&rsquo;t &#8216;act out&rsquo; and so -can- learn something.  As others here have said before: you put a bunch of blacks together and it&rsquo;s 6-of-1 whether it will be a fight or a singalong that breaks out, 10 minutes later.</p>
<p>Neither of which are conducive to learning anything at all (well, maybe that&rsquo;s an overstatement but certainly not anything positive&hellip;).</p>
<p>The more you pull away from big government, the less call big government will have to stick their hand out to you.  And that kind of disempowerment strategy is always a good thing.</p>

		<p>When I was growing up in the 60s and 70s, I attended a number of different schools, from all white and middle-class, to heavily black and rural poor (with 38 kids and a teacher stuffed into a metal portable building.)  The all-white school was a lot better than the rural Easy-Bake oven classroom, but in all of the schools the curriculum was third-rate.  Foreign languages introduced too late, and taught by non-native speakers, English classes that never got around to Shakespeare or grammar, etc.  When ability-grouping of students was classified as racist, the schools completely dropped any standards that they might once have had, and instead devoted themselves to Making Learning Fun, and Learning How to Learn (instead of learning.)</p>
<p>When my children were growing up, it was much the same.  The elementary school required that the children turn in assignments typed on the computer   &mdash;   after several years of this in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade, they finally offered a cheesy typing class to help the kids try to overcome their now deeply-ingrained hunting and pecking technique.</p>
<p>A number of my cousins are public school teachers, but I resent spending a nickel of tax money on any public school, white, black or otherwise.  The school district where I attended high school attempted to pass a bond issue to build a Taj Mahal high school KNOWING that the school district enrollment was about to take a nosedive.  I&rsquo;ve seen other school districts completely remodel aging buildings, replacing all of the electrical, heating, plumbing, etc., and then shut the school down a year after it has reopened due to declining enrollment.  People who don&rsquo;t have the brains to plan five to ten years ahead should NOT be running a school district.    </p>
