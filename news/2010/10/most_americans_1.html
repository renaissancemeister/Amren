			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rasmussen Reports, October 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Fifty-one percent (51%) of Americans believe the U.S. government is too sensitive to the concerns of racial, ethnic and social minorities in the country.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Perhaps not surprisingly, 56% of African-Americans say the government is not sensitive enough to minority concerns, while 61% of whites think the government is overly concerned. Those of other ethnicities are narrowly divided on the question.</p>
<p>Most Americans (69%) also think it is better to allow free speech without government interference rather than let the government decide what types of so-called &#8220;hate speech&#8221; should be banned. {snip}</p>
<p>Just 17% think it is better to let the government decide what types of hate speech should be banned. Fourteen percent (14%) are undecided. {snip} Critics argue that hate speech legislation is largely politically motivated and violates the U.S. Constitution&rsquo;s guarantee of freedom of speech.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A plurality (47%) of adults continue to think criminals should be prosecuted more severely if it can be proven that their crime was motivated by the victim&rsquo;s race, color, religion, national origin or sexual orientation. This view has held steady from last November.</p>
<p>Thirty-eight percent (38%) disagree and do not think a criminal should be prosecuted any more severely for this reason. Another 15% are not sure.</p>
<p>In June 2009, half of Americans (50%) felt hate was growing in the country, but 35% disagreed and 15% more weren&rsquo;t sure. {snip}</p>
<p>Still, 59% say factors such as race and ethnicity should be used to determine which boarding passengers to search at airports, and many believe profiling is a necessary part of today&rsquo;s society.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m disheartened to know only 51% feel that way.<br>
What continually stuns and confuses me is that in virtually all polls, the minority percentage seems to be in control of those with the majority opinion.</p>

I do think it is important that people like Charles Murray be allowed to publish their books and articles, and that is important that others be able to agree with them without being afraid that they may be fired.  </p>

		<p>Government is too racial.   And much of that racialism is based on a totally false paradigm that whites are bad and non-whites are victims of bad whites.  It&rsquo;s utterly criminal how racialism has infected most every aspect of our laws and public administration. </p>

		<p>The problem with prosecuting &#8220;crude racial stereotypes&#8221; as a separate CRIME or a crime enhancer is this:  a black thug holds you up, pistol whips your wife, you draw your legal concealed weapon and smoke his butt while impulsively calling him the &#8220;N&#8221; word.  YOU get prosecuted for a hate crime, while HE becomes the victim, simply and only because you had poor shot placement.  THAT&rsquo;S why freedom of speech was meant to cover all speech including &#8220;crude racial stereotypes&#8221;.  ALL speech.  Otherwise you have Government determining what is allowed speech, and what is not.  Today it&rsquo;s any derogatory remark about &#8220;protected classes&#8221;.  (note, whites are NOT a protected class).  Tomorrow it is anything derogatory about our ruler elites and their policies.  I have NO problem with an atheist calling me a crude name as a Christian, IF in return I have the freedom to call a black thug the N word.  Etc.</p>

Of course.  Hardly surprising, considering that the <i>Liberal-Minority Coalition</i>  has been ruling America since FDR. They promote their own interests and are accustomed to getting their own way. They have come to take the righteousness of their anti-majority cause so much for granted that anything else is denounced as outrageous, bigoted, reactionary,  racist, and not to be tolerated.  &#8220;Majority&#8221; has become practically a bad word; the majority  [automatically bad] has to be fought and defeated to bring about &#8220;change&#8221;. Change means distablishment of the majority and more minority rule. Importing ever more minorities assists in this project.  Their heroes have become elevated to national saints (MLK), while their opponents are denounced as devils (McCarthy).  They are True Believers in the new state religion of Multiculturalism and everything else is heresy.</p>

Sounds like the report itself is contrived a lie. The real figures should be more like 75% since the other 25% are you know who. </p>

		<p>This is simply it, blacks will never have &ldquo;enough&rdquo; because they believe every single one of their shortcomings is caused by the white man, we have an infinite debt in their eyes that can only be paid by handing everything over to them, whether it is money, women, land, rights, etc.</p>

		<p>Please note, &#8220;John Engelman,&#8221; speech is either free or it is not. Also note that racial stereotypes, crude or otherwise, are generally accurate, and often amusing. My day is wasted if I cannot offend at least one Cultural Marxist&hellip;and nothing does it better than a &#8220;crude racial stereotype!&#8221; Man-up!</p>

		<p>People have learned to lie to pollsters much like Russians and Germans in the bad old days. This may explain the 51%. Also it is not in the interest of the powers that be to ever permit it to appear that a majority of White Americans  are sick and tired of the nonsense going on. The MSM etc. need to make any  White dissent to be a marginal &#8220;uneducated &#8221; or bigoted minority. How about a poll questioning the existence of Group specific organizations and competitions &#8220;White Miss U.S.A.&#8221; etc. Might be astounding real data there.</p>

		<p>Yes, hate is definitely building in this country. The policies which favor minorities over Whites have turned a major segment of the White population into misanthropes.<br>
Every White person who has been paying attention is aware that there is an enemy state in every major city of America. For two generations Whites have watched their home values evaporate to nothing as the government thrust into their neighborhoods hordes of uncivilized Blacks who rapidly destroyed both the houses and the fabric of our communities.</p>
<p>Whites have spent their retirement savings and their kid&rsquo;s college funds to stay ahead of the government-encouraged tsunami of Black spoilers.</p>
<p>I can personally point to three neighborhoods in which I dumped houses at great financial loss to keep my children away from the unruly sons and daughters of crack heads, beggars and criminals.</p>
<p>All three of those neighborhoods are presently worse than anyplace in America&rsquo;s Wild West days, but the government is still working feverishly to turn yet more of our White-populated areas into crime-ridden ghettos. </p>
<p>What is the government doing? Are they just trying to keep a lid on things until Blacks evolve into a people with cognitive abilities equal to those of Whites? That will likely take 30 or 40 thousand years and I don&rsquo;t think White people have that much patience.</p>

		<p>John Engelmann says:  <i>&#8220;I am not opposed to legal and extra legal sanctions against crude racial stereotypes.  I do think it is important that people like Charles Murray be allowed to publish their books and articles, and that is important that others be able to agree with them&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I would like to ask exactly where Mr. Engelmann would draw the line as to what is acceptable and what is not? That&rsquo;s where the trouble lies.    And WHO is to decide where to draw that dividing line? (Hint: It won&rsquo;t be Mr. Engelmann! It will be those with special interests to serve.)  </p>
<p>I find &#8220;black holes&#8221; perfectly acceptable; while some find the term quite outrageous. And blacks who use the N-word constantly would be incensed if I presumed to use it. Should only some people be allowed to use some words, Mr Englemann?  And what about all the other ugly terms blacks use so casually, such as M-F, which offends my ears terribly? Should the government draw up a list of forbidden words, and a scale of fines according to their offensiveness? (And offensiveness according to WHOM?) </p>
<p>THAT&rsquo;S why freedom of speech is necessary and undivisible, not compromisable   &mdash;    not according to what somebody decides it is, nor to the shifting tastes of the decade or a specific community, but absolutely and without restriction. </p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like what someone else says, you always have the freedom not to listen.</p>
<p>Granted, a lot of stupidity and even tastelessness will slip by, but there is (and can be)  no law suppressing stupidity or tastelessness.</p>
<p>As Bill R. said, <i>&#8220;otherwise you have Government determining what is allowed speech, and what is not&#8221;.</i>.. Exactly!  And that is where we leave a free society and enter the twilight zone. </p>

		<p>When I wrote, &#8220;I am not opposed to legal and extra legal sanctions against crude racial stereotypes,&#8221; I did not mean I was particularly in favor of them; I implied more critical concerns.  <br>
   <br>
It is often dangerous to argue publically that there are important connections between genes, IQ, success in life, crime, race, and similar factors.  That is what needs to change before I worry about a sitcom that is taken off the air because it features a skinny Jewish financial swindler with a big nose and a huge, powerful and stupid black street criminal.  <br>
 <br>
A sitcom like that would be offensive to me. I would be alarmed if it was popular.  I would not agitate to get it off the airwaves.   <br>
 <br>
Finally, I wonder how many people who are protective about the depiction of crude racial stereotypes on presumed First Amendment grounds would feel the same way about a Hollywood movie portraying American soldiers in Iraq as rapacious and cowardly war criminals. </p>

That would seem like actual racial balance to me, since the stock villain in every TV show is a middle-aged or elderly WASP male. You&rsquo;d think that given their concern for &#8220;diversity&#8221;, they could add a little of it to cast of villains.</p>
