<h1>Black GOP Candidates Accuse Party of Ignoring Them</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Anna Palmer, Congressional Quarterly, October 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Three long-shot African-American Republican House candidates are fuming at national party leaders for not doing enough to help get them elected.</p>
<p>Campaign managers for Chuck Smith in Virginia, Charlotte Bergmann in Tennessee and Marvin Scott in Indiana all said the support they&rsquo;ve received from GOP leaders this cycle has been dismal. They added that there could be consequences for the party if they are elected to Congress next year.</p>
<p>Smith&rsquo;s campaign manager, Lisa Creeden, said she wishes her boss could count on the party&rsquo;s help; no Republican has held Virginia&rsquo;s 3rd district in 18 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the Republican Party is going to damage themselves with the African-American community,&#8221; Creeden said. &#8220;I understand part of it is they are focused on races they can win easily, but our point is we couldn&rsquo;t necessarily win this easily, but we can still win it. The effort to reach out to the African-American community will pay out in future elections.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Smith is running against nine-term Rep. Robert C. Scott (D). Scott won the 2008 election with 97 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re looking at pastors who have stepped away from the Democratic Party machine to say we can&rsquo;t support this man anymore and we want the Republican,&#8221; Creeden said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We have repeatedly asked them for support,&#8221; Creeden said. &#8220;It would have been nice if we could have counted on the Republican Party to deliver the voters.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jerry Alexander, campaign manager for Marvin Scott, who is challenging Rep. Andre Carson (D), said the Scott campaign has received virtually no help from state or national GOP leaders.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Alexander said that he has talked with the other 14 African-American Republican candidates&rsquo; campaigns, and each has similar complaints.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s been a bunch of guys grumbling that they are getting no support,&#8221; Alexander said of a slew of e-mails that were sent back and forth this week.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Bergmann&rsquo;s political director, Howie Morgan, isn&rsquo;t sold, and he said the lack of interest in African-American candidates&rsquo; races could cause problems for the leadership down the road.</p>

<p>Yes, the Republican&rsquo;s black voter might defect.</p>

		<p>First, if local Republican parties are like those in Central Florida, they are quite corrupt and entrenched in a George Bush mindset. But that is a bit beside the point. </p>
<p>Second, I&rsquo;m sorry to the few blacks who might support traditional conservatism, but due to my experience with a majority of their kind, and knowing how blacks as a group act, plus knowing that blood is thicker than most anything else, I cannot support black Republicans, or Hispanics either, for that matter.  History has shown that when the rubber meets the road they will always revert to their racial nature.</p>

I don&rsquo;t know these guys well enough to know their positions and records and I don&rsquo;t know how much or how little the GOP has invested in them but does it matter which party they align themselves with? It&rsquo;s the same, &#8216;the man ain&rsquo;t doin&rsquo; enough for me&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Anyone who believes anything the GOP does is going to appeal to black voters is living in a fantasy. Any outreach will be seen as &#8216;too little, too late&rsquo; and viewed as a crude and cynical attempt to use blacks only to win elections, not help blacks.</p>

		<p>This was their plan all along, they&rsquo;re useing the same playbook they used to take over the Dem. party. Plus in the Dem. party they have to share the White guilt &#8220;goodies&#8221; with thousands of other blacks, whereas in the Rep. party they have thousands of White rinos fawning over relatively few blacks. Look at the tea party for example, always pushing the few blacks there on stage or into background shots. If I ever go to a tea party, I would be guaranteed to appear on national T.V. if I stand next to a black. I&rsquo;ve always said that if I were black I&rsquo;d live in the Whitest part of the country I could find -  would&rsquo;nt want to share my &#8220;booty&#8221; with thousands of other &#8220;brothas&#8221;. Give me a year and I&rsquo;d be living there totally free without working since everything I needed - food,housing,transportation,spending money, sex etc. - would be given to me by the local White folks trying to prove they&rsquo;re not &#8220;racisss&#8221;.  </p>

		<p>I think that we have seen quite well with Obama, and with Africa, and other   black areas, what happens when blacks get elected to be in charge. Whites pay the price, the country pays the price. When have blacks EVER run something smoothly? No thanks.</p>

		<p>I would support a truly conservative black candidate who was worthy and had a chance to win. But I would actively campaign against a RINO who played the race card.</p>

		<p>Oh, I think it is MUCH simpler than we think.  I think this is just another &#8220;black farmers&#8221; scam.  During the campaign, candidates have to account as to where the money was spent.  AFTER the campaign, the money donated still remaining in their coffers belong to the candidate to do with what he wants.  Get it?  No chance to win, but support me with big bucks.  It&rsquo;s how Ron Paul keeps himself in beans.  And he&rsquo;s white.  Blacks are always, always looking for ways to snooker whites and white organizations into providing them bucks for no return, and for no reason other than they are black.  Same deal here.  Nothing new here in the black scam playbook folks.  Move along.</p>

		<p>Even if these Bantu Republican candidates win their races, what&rsquo;s to stop them from turning Democrat in the next Congress? I can see scenarios where they&rsquo;ll threaten to join the Democrats, unless they get copious amounts of pork-barrel spending to control, or legislation they want passed. They could also threaten to leave the Republicans by saying the GOP senior leadership is &#8220;holding them down&#8221;.</p>

		<p>These &#8220;longshot&#8221; candidates are a longshot for a good reason:  Few voters have any reason to vote for them other than indulging in a feel-good exercise in racial &#8220;breakthroughs.&#8221;  I&rsquo;m glad many GOP rank and file (though not GOP leaders) are beyond that Jack Kemp nonsense. </p>

		<p>They shouldn&rsquo;t take it too hard; most of us are sick of white, neo-con RINOs, too.  With white &#8220;Republicans&#8221; like Juan McShamnesty likely to remain in power, why do we need to add some black clones to their ranks?</p>
<p>The daily spam emails Michael Steele&rsquo;s GOP has sent me - despite repeated efforts to make them stop, lately in terms so insultingly vitriolic they resemble some twisted, literary version of Tourette&rsquo;s Syndrome - has me loathing the GOP almost as much as I do the Democratic party.  Adding more empty suits to an already obnoxiously ineffective party is going to accelerate the flight of genuinely conservative white voters, while attracting zero black votes.</p>

		<p>Black conservatives are as rare as Bigfoot.  The term is an oxymoron.  What you have here is a bunch of Michael Steele token blacks who think Lyndon Johnson&rsquo;s great society was the best thing since sliced bread.  I agree with Bill R, they are just running to enrich themselves by telling whites something like &#8220;if you give me money, people won&rsquo;t call you a racist.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The black GOP candidates being cut loose were all running in ghetto areas with no chance of winning in the first place.  While I admire them for making the effort, they should have known the score right from the start.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, the GOP is strongly backing several that have a good shot at winning, including Ryan Frazier in Colorado, Col. Allen West in Florida, and Tim Scott in South Carolina.  </p>

<p>Well, I pray not poster #13. The GOP and the Tea Party hasn&rsquo;t learned a thing about race or human behavior. </p>
<p>The GOP is sounding like the Demonrat party when they put up Obama. I do not want any black in positions of power, period. As for them being conservative, we have seen this before with Condi, Powell and JC Watts, haven&rsquo;t we? I will pick a true WHITE conservative before any black. Blacks were never meant to become voters, citizens or on juries and now we have those who embrace them to become our politicians, judges, police, doctors, etc? </p>

		<p>The political and judicial setup of North America like its European counterpart, is that of a one-party state.  All of the supposedly distinct political parties have long-since morphed into one.  It&rsquo;s high time <b>all</b> White people recognise this and commence accordingly, the necessary collective counter-action.</p>
<p>Judging from the present state of affairs America finds herself in, only secessation will put an end to the founding European-American race being forced to endure what has long since become relentless and never-ending invasion, colonisation, usurpation and resultant victimisation by countless breeds of non-White parasites into their living spaces.</p>
<p>In order to save themselves, European-Americans <b>must</b> set the wheels of secessation in motion whilst they&rsquo;re still in the majority albeit a fast-decreasing majority, but it means regaining overall power once again and speedily at that. </p>
<p>Attempts at trying to recapture majority control of American politics and the judicial system, are going to prove futile due to those ever-increasing non-White demographics as mentioned above along with a seditious Communist policy of ongoing conference of amnesty, citizenship and voting rights to all invaders. </p>
<p>Apparently, a recent 2010 research article calculates the White population of North America to be around 66% at this juncture in time.  Therefore, there&rsquo;s absolutely no time to waste.<br>

<p>Unfortunately, most whites in this country are of the conceit that if we just &#8220;reached out&#8221; to blacks more, they would start to act like whites. And then there&rsquo;s a significant minority who believe that blacks shouldn&rsquo;t act white, period. Those of us who think that genetics explains, at least in part, why blacks and Latinos will never act like whites are an even tinier minority. Integration is the order of the day, even among the so-called &#8220;conservatives&#8221;.</p>
