			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News, October 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A black judge from western Pennsylvania rejected a plea agreement for a man accused of fighting with police during a traffic stop, saying it was &#8220;a ridiculous plea that only goes to white boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>Allegheny County Judge Joseph Williams said on Tuesday that a black defendant in that situation would not have been treated as leniently.</p>
<p>Williams recused himself after making the comments, and a white judge accepted the plea agreement for 24-year-old Jeffery McGowan, who had faced charges including aggravated assault.</p>

		<p><i>Allegheny County Judge Joseph Williams said on Tuesday that a black defendant in that situation would not have been treated as leniently.</i></p>
<p>First off, Judge, he&rsquo;s 24 years old.  He&rsquo;s a man, not a boy.  I know this because there is no such thing as a black &#8220;boy,&#8221; we are told over and over again.</p>
<p>Second, he had a clean prior sheet.  The reason so many black men circa 24 years old who are brought in on fighting with cops might not get the same kind of deals is that their sheets are dirtier, usually.</p>

		<p>I am a practicing litigator of some almost four decades experience.  Unless this judge has specific empirical proof, independent of anecdotes or his own observations, that these types of pleas &#8220;only goes to white boys,&rdquo;  he should be removed from the bench.  He is imparting his own version of &#8220;nullification,&#8221; except that here is is to punish whites, rather than to excuse blacks.<br>
Of course, if a white judge made a similar comment about a black defendant, he&rsquo;d be hung in effigy by the press and all the pandering politicians.</p>

		<p>If a white judge ever used the phrase &#8220;black boys&#8221; he would not only have to recuse himself from the case but would also probably have to resign from the bench and then go on a grovelling tour begging the forgiveness of the likes of Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Acquittal after acquittal after acquittal until the stench of it reaches so far upon into Heaven, it chokes the whole thing off.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the score, fellow whiteys.  Our judicial system if full of judges who were put there specifically to make life miserable for White Humanity, a victory otherwise known as Integration and Civil Rights.</p>
<p>If you are miserable because you can no longer pursue White Happiness due to the expanding and ever more powerful Diversity Curse, then you become an exhibit in the National Civil Rights Museum-  The Success of Liberty!</p>
<p>Black success is White misery.  White Liberty is White Privilege is Racism. Black Equality is Liberty through White Dispossession.</p>
<p>Blacks know it. You and I know it. Why don&rsquo;t your do-gooder White neighbors know it? They will eventually know it, but too late to do any of us any good.</p>
<p>Next time you hear somebody complain about unqualified judges being appointed to the bench, say, &#8220;Oh, you must have read Rosalie Gordon&rsquo;s Nine Men Against America,&#8221; which they hadn&rsquo;t.  They only talk like that because they listen to Limbaugh and Beck, neither of whom would mention this book.  </p>
<p>The tradition of appointing unqualified judges goes way, way back, and it&rsquo;s a proven and effective tactic in the War Against White Privilege.  Except for the White Elites- they get to keep and increase their power, profit, perks, and privilege, all the while destroying us.</p>
<p>As far as black judges go, no matter how educated or how many conservative White women they marry (look up Clarence Thomas&rsquo; current blue eyed wife), none are qualified to judge over White Humanity.  </p>

		<p>It is my observation that black criminals are given a great deal of leniency by our justice system. blacks who have been arrested 20 times are walking the streets, then they kill a cop and finally get a real &#8220;white man&#8221; sentence. black minors are especially treated with kid gloves, given every opportunity to &#8220;turn their lives around&#8221;, there is a whole industry devoted to keeping black kids out of jail. And look at black rap stars, they have to get arrested 10 times before they spend a day in jail, with &#8220;charges dismissed&#8221; being the standard disposition of their cases.  if i didn&rsquo;t know better, I would say there is a program in place to release black criminals in order for them to commit more &#8220;black-on-black&#8221; crime. </p>

		<p>Poster #5 is right.  Black teens out here commit crime after crime and are let off by liberal judges time after time.  The schools are full of black &#8220;boys&#8221; with parole officers, and I know this first hand from working in them and having such &#8216;students&rsquo; in my classes, year after year!</p>

<p>Every time I&rsquo;m in court 9 out of 10 judges I see are black or women. I suppose noticing that puts me in the same league as this black judge in Pennsylvania who makes his statement here. The difference is I&rsquo;m a racist and bigot unless I make the claim in an oh-so-careful manner and in just the perfect context, while the rude here judge is just an &#8216;activist&rsquo;. I also agree with the other poster. I think this judge could not be more wrong. Whites with the exact same record are given tougher sentences.  </p>

		<p>Blacks:  if you want the system to not be &#8216;against&rsquo; you, here&rsquo;s a secret: act civilized and stop committing crimes.  Oh, and when a cop pulls you over, shut up, say sir/ma&rsquo;am, keep your hands on the wheel, sit in your car (unless the cop wants you out of the car, in which case you do it slowly), dress like a human being instead of a thug, don&rsquo;t yell, don&rsquo;t cuss, etc.  Do these things and you will get treated better.  Oh, stop playing the victim card when they laws are written against whites and in favor of you today.  Is that clear?</p>

		<p>The sword of racial preferences cuts both ways. Let&rsquo;s not forget that being granted the title of &#8220;judge&#8221; to creatures that barely finished high school and were shuffled through college on race-based quotas is uniquely the province of colored boys.<br>

		<p>Hispanic newsman Rick Sanchez was involved in a hit and run accident and apparently nothing happened to him. This is what Wikipedia says about it:</p>
<p>&#8220;On December 10, 1990, Sanchez was in a neighborhood in the vicinity of Joe Robbie Stadium, driving home with his father from a football game when he struck Jeffrey Smuzinick, a pedestrian who was reportedly inebriated. Sanchez fled from the location at which the accident occurred, but returned a few hours later. Whereas statements by witnesses say that Sanchez protested in a shrill tone against having his blood alcohol content checked, (because he believed that his reputation would thereby be damaged), and that he gave no help to Smuzinick, Sanchez asserted that he attempted to attract the notice of passing drivers and to render medical assistance. Smuzinick was paralyzed and, on November 2, 1995, died in an assisted living facility. A blood test by police determined that Sanchez&rsquo;s blood alcohol level was .15%, thus above the legal limit of .10%. Sanchez was charged with driving under the influence (DUI) and pleaded No Contest&#8221;.</p>

<p>Jay, the first high school I worked for (majority black) had a full-time PO officer on site!  Others visited the school daily  &mdash;  showing attendance and grades to PO officers became part of my daily routine and I got to know most of them by name  &mdash;  there was even a judge that would stop by about once a month.</p>
<p>None of it helped.  Most ended up in prison.</p>

		<p>Judge Williams has a point, but he&rsquo;s unwilling to face the reasons why white &#8220;boys&#8221; are probably offered more plea agreements than blacks.</p>
<p>1.) White boys usually do not have the sheer amount of previous arrests and convictions that black boys have and<br>
2.) White boys show something a lot more often than you ever see from blacks: REMORSE.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Aggravated Assault&rsquo; should only apply as a weapons charge or a fight involving some form of premeditation involving what it sounds like: serious injury.  Instead, it is a catchall crime, which, despite the hype, most &#8216;angry&rsquo; drunks can&rsquo;t summon the coordination to fulfill.</p>
<p>If this McGowan character was anything but .16 on the BAC, he would have been in the hospital with a crushed cheekbone, broke-back fingers, a dislocated knee or hip, crushed instep, stripped Achilles tendon or even the victim of a highly illegal &#8216;wood shampoo&rsquo; or choke injuries.</p>
<p>All of which cops apply, rigorously, to drunks whom they think are too buzzed to feel ordinary pain and/or as a disablement mechanism to keep &#8216;enraged&rsquo; ones from getting back up.</p>
<p>Because a bullet wouldn&rsquo;t be as much fun and tazing is harder to write off to &#8216;a struggle&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If he had actually made a fight of it, Mr. McGowan would also be facing a mandatory APO (Assault On A Peace Officer) which is one of those &#8216;blue privileges&rsquo; by which cops get to pretend they are better than mere mortals when it comes to their _chosen_ line of work.  This does carry mandatory sentencing requirements in most states.</p>
<p>What likely really happened here was McGowan was sluggish, stubborn or unresponsive in his actions, and when Trooper Dening pulled him over, his &#8216;resistance&rsquo; to being put in a control position automatically qualified him for an eggregious sounding add-on crime.</p>
<p>In this case, AgA$$ is -designed to induce- &#8216;remorse&rsquo; as an either/or choice to being judicially hung by your nipples or giving into whatever sweetheart sounding deal the DA feels like offering a plea to in order to avoid wasting state money on a trial case.  Color doesn&rsquo;t typically enter into it.</p>
<p>Submit to the blackmail and whatever Damocletian Sword they have hanging over you gets put back in it&rsquo;s scabbard.</p>
<p>And no, I don&rsquo;t like the policy very much because it can all too easily become a facilitating mechanism for both LEO and judicial abuse.  And because I&rsquo;ve seen one too many cases where a repeat offender DWI who _should_ have gotten serious time for the crime they DID do (&#8216;steering into the lights&rsquo; and using your car like a bowling ball, even if it&rsquo;s not obviously against people, is a common drunk psychopathology, IMO, all DUI/DWI offenders should have permanent license removal, for life), didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Until it was too late.</p>
<p>And in case you were wondering, here&rsquo;s the bright boy himself:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/24gr9g7" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/24gr9g7</a></p>

		<p>A plea offer of &#8220;disorderly conduct&#8221; in this case is really an admission by the prosecutor that the case for &#8220;aggravated assault&#8221; is weak or nonexistent.</p>

		<p>In San Francisco many years ago, a black 14 year old was let free after he had done TWO armed robberies because the black head of Juvenile Court,appointed by the White Liberal Mayor Art Agnos had instituted an affirmative action program because &#8220;too many&#8221; blacks were being incarcerated, more than other ethnictites.  Never mind that blacks COMMITTED that many more crimes.So afterward, he tried to sell drugs to a naive white who was parked near a mostly black housing project.  The guy refused to buy from him, so he pulled a gun, shot him in the eye, and now he has only one eye left.</p>
