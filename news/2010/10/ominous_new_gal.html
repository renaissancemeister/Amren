<h1><a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2010/10/obama-approval-gallup-blacks.html">Ominous New Gallup Findings for Democrats: Blacks Still Love Obama, Others Not So Much</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Malcolm, Los Angeles Times, October 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The good news for President Obama is his popular support among blacks is holding steady at 91%.</p>
<p>The bad news is no other group of potential voters likes him that much.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A new Gallup Poll this morning finds his approval rating for September was 45%, almost the same as August&rsquo;s 44%. Obama&rsquo;s not exceeded the crucial 50% level in a single month so far this year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Democrats (79%) and liberals (75%) still like Obama a lot.</p>
<p>But after that, his approval percentage goes to the deep south. Support among even young people is down: 57%. Hispanics: 55%. Moderates: 54%. Unmarrieds: 53%. Easterners: 52%. Women: 47%. Midwesterners and Westerners: 45%.</p>
<p>Men: 43%. Southerners: 41%. Independents: 40%. Marrieds: 39%. Seniors: 38%. Whites: 36%. Conservatives: 23%.</p>
<p>Amazingly, among Republicans Obama still manages to hold the support of 12%.<br>

		<p>So if I&rsquo;m a white conservative republican&hellip;  Does that mean I hate him so much I officially undermine the confidence of two liberals?  Whaddya  mean &#8216;No!&rsquo;??</p>
<p>Actually, this was bound to happen.</p>
<p>Obama can&rsquo;t enact legislation likely to make sufficient minority groups (as disparate elements of a suck-America-dry &#8216;post-racial coalition&rsquo;) all happy and the people he&rsquo;s giving the goose to are the voter base which still has the largest commonality of multi-demographic electorate loyalty.</p>
<p>Since it&rsquo;s likely that even the most pro-Obama voters are in fact scattered across a demographic skew like a bell curve by whatever they are &#8216;for&rsquo; as individual or &#8216;inclusive&rsquo; agendas as much as group membership and thus subject to disappointment when their particular cause doesn&rsquo;t come up.</p>
<p>That said, the Republicans are looking at a similar issue in that the TP&rsquo;ers could very well end up splitting the GOP vote just to -prove- they are different.  And this could factionalize a pretty uniform cadre` at the moment.  Pitting white conservatives against white GOPers at a moment when we are already weak.</p>
<p>Yet there is something to be said for the simple power of &#8220;NO!&#8221; and if a good number of true conservatives are voted into national legislature in November, there are a lot of sacred cows they can point their fingers at and pull the trigger on.</p>
<p>Whether the flurry of &#8220;Look at the new sheriffs in town!&#8221; legislation they recommend is sufficient to encourage current GOP and maybe marginal-centrist democrats away from a party line of &#8216;wait and see&rsquo; (what handouts are given in conference committee) on things like Amnesty remains to be seen.</p>
<p>But maybe a more realistic reflection of the American Polities&rsquo; actual stated preferences could be achieved another way.</p>
<p>IMO, it all has to start much more fundamentally, with defunding of these specific, high ticket, programs as razed earth here at home and minimalist interventionism on the strategic front.</p>
<p>Obamacare has to be defunded.  The pointless wars in SWA have to be defunded.  And social welfare for non-citizens has to be defunded (no welfare and maybe &#8216;amnesty&rsquo; as working visas if not citizenship won&rsquo;t hurt as bad, provided they pay taxes before going home).</p>
<p>If the TP&rsquo;ers and whatever internal coalition they can muster can break up -that- logjam, no matter how much loyalty they nominally maintain to their individual supergroups, they can  sway things like illegal immigration and border control, indirectly (more troops come home, more training rotations through the area&hellip;).</p>
<p>And insodoing, they will have accomplished something of major benefit for this nation.</p>
<p>Such actions will also go a long ways towards creating a historical basis for judgment of the overall lack of effectiveness of the Obama administration itself.  Not simply that he made more promises than he could keep but the things he stood for ended up being repealed by the adults in the room as &#8216;accomplishments&rsquo; that didn&rsquo;t need doing and were quickly reversed.</p>
<p>If Obama is sunk as reactionary as much as racial neutralist president in his first term, then we can work on deeper social issues with a new president whose agenda is not so vote-shopping blatant.  For himself.  Or for his party.</p>

		<p>What growing numbers of our White Community are coming to realize is that the blacks do not hold the same definitions of Life, Liberty, Property, and the Pursuit of Happiness that we do.</p>
<p>I am conflicted about Glenn Beck. On balance, he does more good for us than harm.  I credit him with the White Communities&rsquo; increasing disenchantment with the blacks&rsquo; hero Obama.   </p>
<p>Beck probably doesn&rsquo;t really believe all he says about Michael King Fake Reverend.</p>
<p>This poll is good for Whites.  More of them are members of a victim group and will be less willing to say &#8220;Diversity is our strength, and we need to do more to atone for the sins of segregation by holding ourselves accountable to people of color for our unearned White privileges.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obama is divisive, and so is Race Reality.  Let&rsquo;s hope for more Obama afrothuggery between now and 2012.  The worse he gets, the better things get for our movement.</p>

		<p>Not much has changed, really.  Blacks won&rsquo;t waver in their racial allegiance.  Whites, except true liberals, don&rsquo;t like Obama.  Maybe some gullible whites have been converted away from him, but that&rsquo;s it.</p>

		<p>Buyer&rsquo;s remorse is setting in&hellip;only blacks are deluded enough to think &#8220;da brotha&#8221; is going to give them free stuff, i.e., Whitey&rsquo;s stuff. In just about every category things have gotten worse under his tenure in office. Electing him was a well-intentioned &#8220;feel-good&#8221; social experimemt by guilt-ridden White liberals to attone for generations of &#8220;racism.&#8221; It has turned out to be an unmitigated disaster.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Obama approval rating among blacks, 91 percent; among whites, 36 percent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Could there be a long explanation with all the attendant supporting points that could equal just exactly where blacks are in this country than the above brief statistical statement?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>Whites, generally, are for America and whatever they think will insure its survival.  But they&rsquo;re alone, as a group.</p>
<p>Blacks are for blacks first, last, and always, over and above any loyalty they might have for this nation and it&rsquo;s non-black population.  Nothing could reveal that prejudice any better than the above stats.</p>
<p>Likewise, Hispanic preference to crowd illegal aliens into the Southwest by any means necessary tells us they prefer their own  customs, language and people above all other non-Hispanics.  Their true loyalties are usually always to their people and various countries south of the border, as their many displays of foreign flags plainly show.</p>
<p>Muslims would never think of giving loyalty over to the US or to a European country if either area went to war with their countries of origin.  And if US customs, laws or culture in any way conflicts with their peculiar sharia laws, then everything else is secondary. Their loylties obviously lie only to their own group.</p>
<p>In the final analysis, the fools who were so silly as to expect that a multicultural paradise was possible will go down with all the rest.  Their weak-spined baffoonery should never have been allowed.</p>
<p>And, &#8220;no&#8221; I don&rsquo;t think this manipulation was the work of clever seditionists, although there can be found a lot of it within our recent history.  They could never do it without willing accomplices.</p>
<p>What this nation&hellip;and Europe&hellip;has become is no more than the work of naive fools who should have been singled out and jailed long ago.  </p>
<p>This nation will break apart into many territories because of it all.</p>

<p>Actually I think it&rsquo;s more of a battle between neoconservatives and the old right which has teamed up with the Tea Party in an attempt to marginalize them.  I can&rsquo;t speak for anyone else but I&rsquo;m tired of neocon control of the Republican Party.  The right needs to shift to a more traditional eurocentric brand of politics, scale down the empire, bring the troops home and put them on the border.  If I see more of the status quo then I wash my hands of them forever. </p>

<p>I believe Beck is a mouthpiece for the GOP.  That so-called conservative rally they held in DC was nothing more than a neocon woodstock, a parade of world religions conveying the idea we all worship the same God whether it&rsquo;s Islam, Voodoo or Christian, a Martin Luther King love fest to get out the black vote for the GOP by throwing conservative values under the bus.  I just hope the dialogue woke up some of those conservatives in the crowd as to what was really going on. </p>

		<p>With only 36% of whites currently in support of this excruciatingly disastrous attempt at &ldquo;proving&rdquo; multicultural Marxism as our new national &ldquo;manifest destiny,&rdquo; I expect the media to go into a never before witnessed spasmodic apoplexy of genocidal anti-white hatred. Indeed, this will only be compounded if election results in 2010 and 2012, see this totalitarian absurdity not only rejected, but also being slowly dismantled as a result of logical policy and legislative actions. </p>
<p>It will be nothing short of a chattering class induced civil war!</p>
<p>Always remember, they hate our guts and love Comrade Obama because he is an action oriented embodiment of that hatred&rsquo;s logical outcome, the total annihilation of the white race in this country and on this planet.</p>
<p>I once read that a German general remarked when questioned by his British and US interrogators, as to why he thought the war in the Soviet Union had gone so badly, that the reason was: &lsquo;We started treating them badly too soon&hellip;&rsquo; or something like that.</p>
<p>I believe the same has happened with Comrade Obama and Co., and the not yet established nonwhite majority utopia that they foreshadow. </p>
<p>Well at least, may God let it be so!</p>

		<p>What sticks out to me, and is the crux of our problem, is the 36% of whites who like Obama. They are the deluded folk who are bringing us down. Whites need to be 91% for a candidate because no one else is for us. Other nonwhites and ethnicities voted Obama, maybe not quite at black levels but still a majority. </p>

		<p>This article lies by making an assumption that is not reasonable nor true&hellip;..that the same groups that support Obama will support the rest of the democrats.</p>
<p>Blacks support Obama because they are racist and he is black.  But blacks are also angry that they haven&rsquo;t gotten lots and lots of free goodies under Obama.  A contradiction&hellip;..or is it.  Obama is NOT up for re-election this year.  Many dems are.  I think the best they can hope for from identity groups&hellip;..blacks, other non-whites, gays, whorish women, is ambivalence.  However, I suspect they will be surprised at the amount of open hostility that will directed towards them from former supporters.  I am sure, the dems would just love to scapegoat Obama while avoiding the tremendous levels of anti-leftist sentiment and, let&rsquo;s face it, creeping anti-government militancy festering in the US.  However, they have failed.  </p>
<p>Obama may be toxic politically, at the moment, but he is a beloved leader compared to how the US feels about the rest of the democratic party.  They will be voted out, in November, of course (out of EVERYWHERE)&hellip;.they will be lucky not to be tarred and feathered on the way out.</p>
<p>And here is an interesting rumor going around&hellip;..that Obama has actually broken with the communist left.  That&rsquo;s what it means that Rahm Emmanual and the rest of the rats are abondoning ship.  Obama was SELECTED before he was elected&hellip;.but he may have gotten tired of being these peoples&rsquo; Stepan Fetchit.</p>
<p>That presents interesting possibilities&hellip;..especially if the &#8220;tea party&#8221; breaks the hold the neocons have on the GOP.  The two groups (communists and neocons) really are the same people, once you scratch the surface.  Lip service to vastly different ideals&hellip;.but EXACTLY the same behaviors and policies when they get it.</p>
<p>What a monkey wrench a minion like Obama could be, if he decides to bite the hand that feeds him.</p>

<p>If blacks such as Thomas Sowell or Walter Williams were running for president they&rsquo;d be derided among blacks as racial turncoats and likely be supported by less than three percent of them.</p>

		<p>All you have to remember is that these are the people(blacks), who enthusiastically defend murderers, rapists, criminals of every conceivable stripe on a regular basis&hellip;so long as they are fellow Africans! What wrong can Obama do that would put such people off? Sure they gripe that he &#8220;hasn&rsquo;t done enough&#8221; for the &#8220;black community&#8221;(translation - hasn&rsquo;t given over enough of whitey&rsquo;s money). But when all is said and done, they protect their own, even the most odious, unflinchingly.  </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also quite evident to anyone with even a scintilla of cerebral activity that Blacks also feel that they have Presidential Nihil Obstat to attack White people anytime they have an impulse seizure.<br>
The only solution is that Whites have got to respond in kind and make it extemely costly in every aspect to attacks Whites. <br>

		<p>&#8220;&#8221;We whites are judging him on merit and they are judging him on race.&#8221;&#8220;</p>
<p>And that is a problem. IMO way too many whites &#8216;don&rsquo;t care about race&rsquo; but all other races do and act accordingly which puts us at a huge disadvantage in a multicultural/multiracial landscape.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8221;That said, the Republicans are looking at a similar issue in that the TP&rsquo;ers could very well end up splitting the GOP vote just to -prove- they are different. And this could factionalize a pretty uniform cadre` at the moment. Pitting white conservatives against white GOPers at a moment when we are already weak.&#8221;&#8220;</p>
<p>I agree there is a split. That said following the GOPers/Neocons is the path we have been on for decades now and a pathway to our destruction. If they want to join us, please do, but we can no longer follow them.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8221;What growing numbers of our White Community are coming to realize is that the blacks do not hold the same definitions of Life, Liberty, Property, and the Pursuit of Happiness that we do.&#8221;&#8220;</p>
<p>That is so true. In fact in my observations generally speaking all races hold different ideas about what those mean.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8221;Whites, generally, are for America and whatever they think will insure its survival. But they&rsquo;re alone, as a group.&#8221;&#8220;</p>
<p>Indeed, many whites have a very skewed idea that all peoples are for the very same America. It just isn&rsquo;t true. I think though that more and more whites are coming to realize that many/most non-whites only view America in racial terms and their accompanying culture. That only works as long as whites don&rsquo;t. How long would the facade last if we did away with every race group out there? No more Black Caucus, no more NAACP, no more African American studies, no more race groups at all. Many whites would be in for a very rude awakening if we really let the racial chips fall where they may. </p>

		<p>Any thinking white person who watched even part of the One Nation rally had to have felt disconcerted by a production that sported a rabble that looked at least 1/2 black and a stream of black musicians and speakers.  The whole affair looked more like a Black Panther rally than anything else.  It even concluded with a band dressed in camo!  Any of the 36% white who still support Obama should watch it.  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s tribalism.  Many blacks still believe that Obama becoming POTUS somehow equates to blacks &#8220;taking over&#8221;.   They think this because they have little or no idea on how our government actually works. </p>

		<p>Forget the Tea Party.  The whole operation was a religious conservative verison of multiculturalism.  Everyone there probably was saying, &#8220;See, there isn&rsquo;t a racist bone in our bodies.&#8221;  As if the blacks are impressed and will reciprocate.  </p>

		<p>Barack Obama was not elected president because the electorate moved to the left.  He was elected because George W. Bush started two expensive wars he could not win, and because most Americans did not benefit from the Bush economy.<br>
 <br>
The President should have spent his first term ending the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq in ways that did not look like American defeats, while pursuing policies that put Americans back to work.  Instead, he passed a health care plan that most Americans do not like.  Meanwhile the unemployment rate has increased.  </p>

<p>Does it matter?  Using MLK&rsquo;s race-blind rhetoric (which King himself did not believe) against liberal race-hustlers is a good move.  Ceteris paribus, any time you can use your opponent&rsquo;s own (ostensible) values against him, it&rsquo;s a good idea to do so.</p>

		<p>This article has generated more right wing political rant than I think a lot of us care to hear, so to put a different oar in the water I will make a few comments in Obama&rsquo;s favor in the cause of &#8220;political reality&#8221;.  First the vast consensus of the economists is that the fiscal stimulus did in fact help the economy turn around. Next it is rather obvious that Obama has certainly done no worse than Bush on foreign policy and has not only pushed harder for peace in the middle east but is actually putting the bite on the Chinese to generate some much needed manufacturing base in this country.  His major mistake has been using up his political capital to pass a healthcare bill that the country as a whole somewhat, but not overwhelmingly,  disapproves as revealed by the polls. But to assume based on his performance to date that the public has somehow seen the light and really wants a return to the kind of policies Bush dished out for 8 years is to to completely misunderstand that the only thing really happening is the public is simply angry and it takes its anger out on the party in power.  In short the Republicans big wins this fall are going to be about as rewarding as the dog catching the car.</p>

		<p>16 Observer:</p>
<p>There are a lot of worries about ACORN/SEIU/Obama voter fraud.  If it happens to a big extent, it might affect a few Senate races, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be effective in precluding the GOP from taking the House, because this voter fraud tends to happen in very blue (and very black and tan) Congressional districts that elect Democrats no matter what.  The House is where all the action is   &mdash;   Power of apportionment.</p>
<p>31:  </p>
<p>A &#8220;vast consensus&#8221; of scientists said there was global warming, too.  All based on fake data.  Of course a &#8220;vast consensus&#8221; of economists will say that TARP &#8220;turned the economy around&#8221; (I&rsquo;d like to know where), because said economists work for institutions that directly or indirectly benefited from TARP.</p>
<p>As for &#8220;putting the bite on China,&#8221; I don&rsquo;t know where you&rsquo;re getting that from.  We are not in a position to put anything on China, bite or bark, because China is our deficit sugar daddy, funding that TARP you love so much.  BTW, peace in the Middle East is not possible.  I think there&rsquo;s some loaded anti-Semitism in your assumptions.</p>
<p>However, I sorta agree with the rest of what you said.  The Republicans will make big gains, but mainly on the backs of moderate and independent voters.  Obama&rsquo;s last ditch effort to head off losses is to say that GOP wants to return to Bush.  I think most mods and Indies agree with that statement, and most people in general do.  But it doesn&rsquo;t matter   &mdash;   They won&rsquo;t be voting Republican because they like Bush or want him back, they&rsquo;re voting Republican to balance out Obama.  They want to try to see if the formula of the late 1990s successes, i.e. a Democrat President and a Republican Congress canceling out each other&rsquo;s bad sides to wind up with some fairly decent (albeit far from perfect) policies, can replicate itself now.  (What I mean by that is that Clinton would have never countenanced an expensive ground occupation of a country for human rights concerns, even though he did tragically bomb Serbia, but only from the air.  Meanwhile, the Republican Congress was having no part of any major tax increases or welfare spending increases, especially if a Democrat got credit for it.)  Should Republicans make these huge gains, they shouldn&rsquo;t misinterpret what just happened.  And don&rsquo;t think they have hold of Congress for a Generation   &mdash;   I think we&rsquo;re in a period of very fast changes in which party runs Congress.  We could see partisan shifts in control of one or both chambers every four years, give or take.  If the Tea Party Movement can marginalize flakes like Dick Armey, then it might have a chance of morphing into a credible third (or is that second?) party if need be.</p>

		<p>If the black polulation in the U.S. is &#8220;only&#8221; 10-12% and if ALL of them voted for the same person, it should not matter! BUT! if, as I suspect, the percentage is closer to 40% along with stOOpid Whites that vote for blacks, it could indeed make a difference which would mean the Obamaster would be re-elected!</p>

		<p>Obama did deliver on his promise of change. I drive around my neighborhood, and I see all of the boarded up car dealerships that were successful businesses even during the Bush recession. I see all of the boarded up grocery stores, and other businesses. <br>
I think of his change as I drive past the empty strip malls, the now dead shopping plaza, the restaurants that have gone out of business, and the ever growing hispanicization of my neighborhood. </p>
<p>About the only thing that hasn&rsquo;t changed hands, or gone out of business are the banks, and the investment houses. They&rsquo;ve simply gotten greedier, but at least the pace of mergers has slowed down, and they mostly have the same names as when he came into office. </p>
<p>By the time his health care plan would actually help me, I&rsquo;ll be done with graduate school. As it is, not only can I not get affordable insurance, I&rsquo;m likely going to get fined for not being able to do it. (They created a special &#8220;high risk pool&#8221; &hellip;which refuses to cover the experimental treatments I need to stay alive. Its actually cheaper for me to pay the Obama care fine, and go without than it is to pay the insurance companies for no return. ) </p>
<p>The only good things I&rsquo;ve seen come out of his administration is that they did increase financial aid amounts for tuition. The bad is that most of the people going are surviving on that increase, and on student loans that are drawing interest for jobs that may not be there when they get done. </p>
