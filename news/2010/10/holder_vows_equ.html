<h1>Holder Vows Equal Enforcement, Calls Allegations to Contrary &#8220;Simply False&#8221;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Levine, Fox News, Oct. 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Attorney General Eric Holder on Monday pushed backed against those who accuse the Justice Department of enforcing civil rights laws based on race, saying people need to just &#8220;look at the facts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The notion that we are enforcing any civil rights laws  &mdash;  voting or others  &mdash;  on the basis of race, ethnicity or gender is simply false,&#8221; Holder said.</p>
<p>For more than a year, Republicans and others have been questioning why the Obama administration reversed course on a federal lawsuit against two members of the New Black Panther Party, who were videotaped outside a Philadelphia polling station on Election Day 2008. The two were dressed in military-style uniforms, and one was holding a nightstick. The issue escalated after a former Justice Department attorney and, more recently, a current Justice Department attorney alleged it was all part of an Obama administration policy to avoid prosecuting minorities, an allegation the Justice Department has repeatedly denied.</p>
<p>Asked why a current Justice Department attorney would make such a claim about his own employer, Holder said, &#8220;I have no idea, but there&rsquo;s no basis in fact for that charge.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking during an unrelated press conference in Washington, Holder said he&rsquo;s trying to fix the Justice Department, not politicize it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Holder said previous politicization of the Justice Department is &#8220;documented in inspector general reports from the past.&#8221; In fact, a 2008 report by the Justice Department&rsquo;s inspector general said a top Civil Rights Division official &#8220;inappropriately considered political and ideological affiliations in hiring experienced attorneys&#8221; and &#8220;considered political and ideological affiliations in transferring and assigning cases to career attorneys.&#8221;</p>
<p>Three weeks ago, the Justice Department&rsquo;s inspector general announced he would launch an investigation into &#8220;more broadly the overall enforcement of civil rights laws by the Voting Section&#8221; of the Civil Rights Division, including &#8220;information about cases such as the New Black Panther Party matter and others.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Justice Department&rsquo;s Office of Professional Responsibility and the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, led by a conservative majority, are also looking into the matter.</p>
<p>In July, the former Justice Department attorney, current conservative blogger J. Christian Adams, told the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights there was an &#8220;open hostility toward equal enforcement in a colorblind way of the voting rights laws.&#8221;</p>
<p>Three weeks ago, Christopher Coates, a current Justice Department attorney who was heavily involved in the initial filing of the New Black Panther Party case, echoed that allegation, telling the commission there has been a &#8220;hostile atmosphere&#8221; within the Civil Rights Division &#8220;against race-neutral enforcement&#8221; of voting rights laws. Coates also said he attended a lunch meeting in September 2009, during which a top Justice Department official told those gathered that the Obama administration was only interested in prosecuting voting rights cases that would help minorities.</p>
<p>The Justice Department tried to block his testimony, citing &#8220;longstanding Department of Justice policy&#8221; to avoid disclosing &#8220;confidential internal deliberations.&#8221;</p>
<p>After Coates&rsquo; testimony, a Justice Department spokeswoman said the commission&rsquo;s &#8220;so-called investigation is thin on facts and evidence and thick on rhetoric.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She called the Bush administration&rsquo;s politicization of the Justice Department &#8220;a disgrace to the great history of the [Civil Rights] division,&#8221; adding, &#8220;We have changed that.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a letter sent to the commission in August, the head of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Civil Rights Division, Tom Perez, pointed to &#8220;our ongoing work in Mississippi,&#8221; where the Justice Department recently filed a motion to stop Democratic officials from discriminating against white voters.</p>
<p>But in his testimony to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, Coates said he believes the New Black Panther Party case was &#8220;gutted&#8221; because &#8220;the people calling the shots&#8221; at the time &#8220;were angry&#8221; at the filing of the Mississippi case and the New Black Panther Party case.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s cut out the neocon hot air. The issue isn&rsquo;t the vulgar Panthers and their voter thuggery. The issue isn&rsquo;t Holder&rsquo;s anachronistic hug for the Voting Rights Act. The real issue is the validity of the Civil Rights Acts, all of them, the 14th and 15th Amendments of the Constitution, and every Presidential executive order concerning civil rights and hiring since 1948. </p>
<p>Until the &#8220;opposition&#8221; rejects all &#8220;civil rights&#8221; government intrusion, that is, if I have to spell it out for you, which I do, since most of you are obsessed with whatever happens in 2010 or with the irrelevant Hussein Obama, madness will reign. Morons will rule. And take what the productive, what the intelligent, what the creative, earn and produce.</p>
<p>Holder, another AA baby, along with Barack Hussein.</p>
<p>Time for a new constitution. The old has been bastardized beyond belief.</p>

		<p>This matter should be a wake-up call for those who cling to the wrongful belief that a &#8220;multi cultural democratic&#8221; society is possible. Whenever one or another racial group gain political advantage, that racial group acts to advance its own interest. </p>
<p>That is only human nature. It is not good and it is not bad. Government force or lulling the target race into an acceptance of defeat will not change that human nature we all possess. After all that is part of what makes us human.  Perhaps we should face reality and begin acting accordingly.  </p>

		<p>Yeah I&rsquo;m sure one lawyer quit his job and the other facing horrific hostility, just to make false accusations against the DOJ. Nobody believes your lies Mr. Holder. All the other white lawyers at the DOJ that know these things to be true should have the backbone to step forward also.</p>

Also they dont talk about white house visitor logs that show Samir Shabazz had a meeting there the night the charges were dropped. Of course its all above board as the whitehouse spokesman said it wasnt the same Samir Shabazz. Like there could actually be 2 people with a name like that in the US. I hope they all burn.</p>

<p>Holder [ZANU-PF] is a damned liar and not even a good one at that.</p>
<p>Of course Holder [ZANU-PF] DOES NOT BELIEVE THE CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS APPLY TO WHITE FOLKS. ONLY apply to THEM! The man has said so himself.</p>
<p>There is nothing complicated about this. In the fevered mind of Holder [ZANU-PF], whitey cannot be a subject of a civil rights complaint as the laws do not apply to whitey.</p>

		<p>To anyone paying attention, Holder suing Arizona for trying to protect its citizens from massive foreign invasion and Holder failing to prosecute the black panthers for voter intimidation illustrates what Holder is all about, not matter what comes out of his mouth.

		<p>Holder and Obama are anti-White, therefore anti-America, as are most in this administration. They will do everything in their power to destroy Whites and America. Most Whites cannot see the truths and don&rsquo;t even want to. They are accomplices in their own demise.</p>

		<p>This has been going on for years. Hence, the number of Whites charged with hate crimes compared to the sheer number of crimes committed by blacks  &mdash;  notably against Whites. Local police are reluctant to charge minorities with hate crimes or the Knoxville Horror and the Witchita Massacre would rank at the top. Now no one, absolutely no one, would believe AG Holder if he said the sun was gonna set tonite. <br>

<p>This statement exemplies one reason blacks are recognized as being less intelligent than the rest of humanity.</p>
<p>There have been no less than a half dozen quotes from people in the justce department who specifically instructed their employers to disregard bias laws where whites are the victims.</p>
<p>No matter how strong the proof might be of black bias and/or misconduct they always seem to think that all they have to do is lie, keep repeating it, and the situation is resolved.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite plain why blacks, as a race, never evolved beyond a stone-age existence in Africa.</p>

<p>The politicization of the &#8220;Justice&#8221; Department WAS a disgrace under the Bush Mob, just like it was a disgrace under Clinton and Bush Senior, and just like it&rsquo;s a disgrace under the Black Messiah. The so-called Justice Department has always been politicized and corrupt and it always will be because the &#8220;law&#8221; is nothing but a tool the ruling elite uses to control the masses, reward their supporters and screw their opposition. Holder can deny it all he wants, but I don&rsquo;t need a whistleblower to tell me that blacks will use the Injustice Department to make themselves rich and protect other blacks at the expense of whites. That&rsquo;s just the way blacks are.</p>

		<p>In New Jersey State Senator Jeff Van Drew is proposing changes that will make it easier for law abiding citizens to acquire Concealed Carry Permits. He&rsquo;s encountering considerable resistance. New Jersey is one of the toughest states in the US in which to obtain a permit.<br>
 <br>
The number of physical assaults on innocent people of European descent and Asian descent is reaching an alarming rate; most recently a rash of &#8220;Polar Bear&#8221; punching  ie. random punching of  White people has occurred in several large cities. This is sometimes called Flash Mobbing. Two of these incidents occurred in Philadelphia.  This is minor compared with the number of murders, individual rapes, gang rapes (average of 30,000 annually non-White on White) and carjackings  (many of which end in rape, murder or both.  Just recently a young woman was stopped at a traffic light at an Atlantic City intersection and was carjacked at gunpoint by two &#8220;youths&#8221; . They forced her to drive to a secluded area where they both sexually assaulted and robbed her. Fortunately she survived. The &#8220;youths&#8221; could not be named due to their age. They&rsquo;re old enough to commit violence but not old enough to be identified.  Had that young lady had a legal carry permit she may have been able to put an end to the incident. <br>
 <br>
The case of the home invasion in Connecticut and the horrible atrocities and murder perpetrated against two adult women and an 11 year old girl got serious media attention as well it should have. However the carjacking, atrocious sexual torture and horrific murders of Channon Christian and Christopher Newsome in Knoxville TN two years ago went largely unreported as did the sexual atrocities and murders of four of five young White people in Wichita KS several years ago. Then there were the murders of Eve Carson, Anne Pressley, Lauren Burke, Aimee Willard and a host of others too numerous to list here. The difference between the latter incidents and the first one in Connecticut is that the perpetrators in the first one were White and in all the others they were non- Whites. So much for our having entered the &#8220;Post Racial Era&#8221;. <br>
 <br>
So many of our cities have become places of fear. Our students are not safe on the campuses of many of our finest Universities.  Our urban public schools are a shambles where a successful day for a teacher and/or a serious student is one in which he/she is not beaten, sexually assaulted or murdered. In South Philadelphia High School there have been two periods in which there were numerous cases of non- White teenagers assaulting Asian students.<br>
 <br>
Senator Van Drew&rsquo;s proposal requires intensive training in the use of firearms for defense, a stringent background check and a hefty fee for the permit. Van Drew has stated that he would like to see the fee reduced from $500. in order not to price people of modest income out of being able to defend themselves.<br>
No one would support a law that permits everyone regardless of their history to carry a firearm but that&rsquo;s the de facto situation today in many states such as NJ that have Draconian firearms regulations. Most of those civilians carrying guns are criminals.<br>
 <br>
History taught us that when the Nazis entered the Warsaw Ghetto, many of it&rsquo;s Jewish residents had concealed firearms from the initial gun confiscation program.  The first thing the Nazis did was to disarm everyone. When the SS troops entered the Ghetto the paid a high price in casualties. What they thought would be an easy operation turned into something they hadn&rsquo;t anticipated. Sadly in the end they prevailed due to overwhelming force.<br>
 <br>
All NJ law abiding citizens must support the  Van Drew proposal.<br>
