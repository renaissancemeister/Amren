			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kevin Sieff, Washington Post, October 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A textbook distributed to Virginia fourth-graders says that thousands of African Americans fought for the South during the Civil War  &mdash;  a claim rejected by most historians but often made by groups seeking to play down slavery&rsquo;s role as a cause of the conflict.</p>
<p>The passage appears in &#8220;Our Virginia: Past and Present,&#8221; which was distributed in the state&rsquo;s public elementary schools for the first time last month. The author, Joy Masoff, who is not a trained historian but has written several books, said she found the information about black Confederate soldiers primarily through Internet research, which turned up work by members of the Sons of Confederate Veterans.</p>
<p>Scholars are nearly unanimous in calling these accounts of black Confederate soldiers a misrepresentation of history. Virginia education officials, after being told by The Washington Post of the issues related to the textbook, said that the vetting of the book was flawed and that they will contact school districts across the state to caution them against teaching the passage.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Masoff defended her work. &#8220;As controversial as it is, I stand by what I write,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I am a fairly respected writer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The issues first came to light after College of William &amp; Mary historian Carol Sheriff opened her daughter&rsquo;s copy of &#8220;Our Virginia&#8221; and saw the reference to black Confederate soldiers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s disconcerting that the next generation is being taught history based on an unfounded claim instead of accepted scholarship,&#8221; Sheriff said. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Sons of Confederate Veterans, a group of male descendants of Confederate soldiers based in Columbia, Tenn., has long maintained that substantial numbers of black soldiers fought for the South The group&rsquo;s historian-in-chief, Charles Kelly Barrow, has written the book &#8220;Black Confederates.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s curriculum requires textbook publishers and educators to explore the role African Americans played in the Confederacy, including their work on plantations and on the sidelines of battle. Those standards have evolved in recent years to make lessons on the Civil War more inclusive in a state that is growing increasingly diverse.</p>
<p>When Masoff began work on the textbook, she said she consulted a variety of sources  &mdash;  history books, experts and the Internet. But when it came to one of the Civil War&rsquo;s most controversial themes  &mdash;  the role of African Americans in the Confederacy  &mdash;  she relied primarily on an Internet search.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In its short lesson on the roles that whites, African Americans and Indians played in the Civil War, &#8220;Our Virginia&#8221; says, &#8220;Thousands of Southern blacks fought in the Confederate ranks, including two black battalions under the command of Stonewall Jackson.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She [Masoff] added that the book was reviewed by a publisher&rsquo;s advisory council of educators and that none of the advisers objected to the textbook&rsquo;s assertion.</p>
<p>Historians from across the country, however, said the sentence about Confederate soldiers was wrong or, at the least, overdrawn. They expressed concerns not only over its accuracy but over the implications of publishing an assertion so closely linked to revisionist Confederate history.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s more than just an arcane, off-the-wall problem,&#8221; said David Blight, a professor at Yale University. &#8220;This isn&rsquo;t just about the legitimacy of the Confederacy, it&rsquo;s about the legitimacy of the emancipation itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Masoff said one of her sources was Ervin Jordan, a University of Virginia historian who said he has documented evidence  &mdash;  in the form of 19th-century newspapers and personal letters  &mdash;  of some African Americans fighting for the Confederacy. But in an interview, Jordan said the account in the fourth-grade textbook went far beyond what his research can support.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s no way of knowing that there were thousands,&#8221; Jordan said. &#8220;And the claim about Jackson is totally false. I don&rsquo;t know where that came from.&#8221;</p>

		<p>As in most other spheres, as our nation becomes &#8220;increasingly diverse&#8221;, our history is revised to accommodate the new reality. Still, one should not put too much faith into the &#8220;new versions&#8221; of history when it belies common sense.</p>
<p>Unlike northern dreamers - most of whom had little, if any, contact with the &#8220;Blacks&#8221; - the Southerners of the day had intimate knowledge of both their behavioral propensity as well as their potential. It is unlikely they would have given the &#8220;Blacks&#8221; arms or disciplined them into a fighting force, thus jeopardizing their own safety on two fronts.</p>
<p>One only needs see today&rsquo;s reality of escalating &#8220;Black&#8221; violence to understand the wisdom Southerners gained through close association with them. Today, no one is safe from armed &#8220;Blacks&#8221;, not even the &#8220;Blacks&#8221; themselves.  </p>

		<p>As far as I know there were a couple of early black units in La.<br>
Near the end of the war, there were a couple of black companes in training around Richmond that never were actually committed to fighting before the end of the war.</p>
<p>Another subject that sends liberals screaming into the night is black slave owners in the ante bellum south. They don&rsquo;t like it too much to be told that the beloved &#8220;Native Americans&#8221; owned black slaves as well. The Cherokee nation sided with the Confederacy during the Civil War.</p>
<p>Another interesting point is reading the accounts of slavery from the actual slaves, not all of whom were in any way unhappy as slaves and many had loved their masters. These were interviews of former slaves still alive in the 1930&rsquo;s. It was a FDR make work project during the great depression era (&#8220;Slave Narratives&#8221;- very interesting readings).   </p>

		<p>What would happen if a major filmmaker, like Oliver Stone or Steven Spielberg, were to make a movie about black Confederate soldiers, Southern blacks who supported the Confederacy, and free blacks, who themselves owned slaves?</p>
<p>Would a white person who made such a film be accused of being a racist?  Would a black filmmaker who made such a movie, be called an &#8220;Uncle Tom&#8221; by other blacks?</p>
<p>I wonder how such different organizations like the N.A.A.C.P, the Black Panthers, and the K would react to such a movie being shown in mainstream theaters!?</p>

		<p>   The quoted sources in the article talk of revisionism in history, but they are the revisionists that teach the entire scope of the War of Northern Aggression was solely about slavery.  There was black involvement on all sides.  One of the largest slave owners in Louisiana was black. </p>
<p>   If you read the excellent memoirs of General Longstreet, he described the union movements in the Battle of the Crater in Petersburg.  The union command put a company of black soldiers on point on the charge into the crater against Confederate lines.  They had to get them drunk so they would agree to attack the Confederates.  Of course, most were killed in the ensuing action along with many others.  Certainly the union command had little regard for their welfare, just an expendable unit. </p>
<p>   If anyone wants to take a critical look at the morality of the Union&rsquo;s conduct, they should immediately convict Sherman and Sheridan for conducting genocide against southern civilians.  Most of the Marxist academics and most of the &#8220;conservative&#8221; talk shows, especially Beck and Hannity, condemn southern white people as bigotted rednecks.<br>

		<p>I wouldnt doubt that Jackson had large numbers of Blacks under his command in separate groups, he was very active in Bible schools for Black children and lead classes personally. I would guess this treatment would have brought about a fair degree of loyalty from Blacks who had benefited from his actions or seen his manner. </p>

		<p> The Post&rsquo;s treatment of this story is typical of the liberal media&rsquo;s attempt to silence anyone who doesn&rsquo;t agree with their agenda.</p>
<p> Yes, there were perhaps as many as 60,000 black men who fought for the Confederacy   &mdash;   although I think the statement about &#8220;two black brigades&#8221; fighting under Stonewall Jackson is inaccurate. The reason for that? Blacks who volunteered to fight for the South were typically integrated into existing Confederate regiments, a few here, a few there, rather than being organized into separate, all-black regiments as they were in the Union Army. Ironic, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p> This talk of &#8220;revisionist Confederate historians&#8221; is nonsense. The history of each war is written predominantly by the victors   &mdash;   with the losers painted in the blackest (no pun intended) hues possible. The &#8220;revisionist&#8221; history was written by Northerners, in the years just after the Civil War   &mdash;   or the War Between the States, as Southerners prefer to call it.</p>
<p> The black Confederates that the liberal historians have tried to hide all these years, are finally coming back to haunt them.</p>

		<p>In the fall of 1864 until the end of the war there were extensive discussions among the Confederate elite   &mdash;  - and some &#8220;tardy and grudging legislative approval&#8221;   &mdash;  - of the idea of incorporating slaves into the Confederate forces as soldiers.  Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee were proponents, but for most in the South the idea was unthinkable. Essentially nothing came of it.</p>
<p>4th Grade textbook author Joy Masoff claims of &#8220;thousands of African-Americans&#8221; fighting for the Confederacy indeed appears to be &#8220;far beyond what his [one of her sources&rsquo;] research can support.&#8221; </p>

<p>Slavery is wrong, but only Christian Western Europeans believed this and they were the ones to outlaw slavery.</p>
<p>The Yankee invaders destroyed the economy of the South, which impoverished blacks as well as whites.</p>
<p>It took a long time for the South to forget. I remember when my family moved to the South in 1953; I was walking a 3rd-grade girl home from school when she said &#8220;We won&rsquo;t talk about the war.&#8221; I had to ask my parents what war she was referring to.

		<p>In all honesty, blacks did serve in the Confederacy but usually followed or were forced by their their masters into war as personal valets and servants or they were assigned to labor or service details such as cooks, stable workers, digging breastworks, graves and tunnels or as stretcher bearers.</p>
<p>I sincerely doubt that the Confederates would have armed them in any great numbers and allow them in combat units unless as a last desperate resort.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know about &#8220;thousands&#8221; and I don&rsquo;t know in which capacity they served but there were indeed quite a few blacks in the service of the Confederacy. And unlike the Union, Confederate soldiers were ALL volunteer.</p>

I did an internet search and it comes down to two camps.</p>
<p>One reports on blacks Confederate troops in a straightforward manner. The second admits there were black Confederate troops but claims there were few and that they essentially suffered from Stockholm Syndrome (a catch-all excuse to explain black behavior that doesn&rsquo;t toe the official PC line). </p>

		<p>There was nothing to prevent free blacks from enlisting. I believe that only a few thousand enlisted and they fought in existing regiments. There were not separate black regiments as in the north.<br>
   A good example of someone who would have fought for the confederacy is our Barrack Obama. There were slave owners on both sides of his family tree. As an east African, he would have no sympathy with the west African slaves.</p>

<p>Absolutely correct.  It was Europeans, primarily the British, who pioneered the idea of abolition of slavery.  Africans and Arabs have had a more historical role in the black slave trade than whites, who arrived after slave routes had already been established, and the darker to this day continue to practice slavery in some areas (such as Mauritania, for example).</p>
<p>Its funny that we always get blamed for slavery, but no-one (in the mainstream media dn education, at least) ever acknowledges that it was whites who ended slavery in most of the world.  Had it not been for imperialism, slavery would probably still be a huge business in Africa and the Moslem world.</p>

		<p>  Mores have changed on both sides of the Mason-Dixon line . That needs to be remembered . Jefferson, Washington and Madison were all slave owners . All thirteen colonies allowed slavery and all thirteen colonies had slaves in 1776 . There were African/American slave owners in the south . Lincoln, just like Stephens, was a man of his time . Stephens&rsquo; quotes pale somewhat once you start quoting Lincoln . It&rsquo;s nearly impossible for us to see it through 19th century eyes . But it didn&rsquo;t become a war of emancipation until three years into the conflict when Lincoln, who did not want black troops finally had to concede to the fact that without them the North just might lose the war . The institution of slavery was brought here by the major European powers and was stoked by New English shipping after American independence . ( I didn&rsquo;t say New English slave traders because the slaves were only part of their cargo) Looking at the big picture, not only has today&rsquo;s African/American been blessed for what his ancestors endured, but those brought here were better off than they would have been in Africa . Admittedly the passage was brutal but it was for the European settlers also . On the whole, Liberia was a failure because most of them did not want to return to Africa . We have no apologies to make and we do not owe them reparations . And liberal, revisionist history is only going to hasten the descent of our nation into dissoloution . The black Confederates were there, we have photographs . But to understand it from a 21st century perspective is very, very hard to do .     </p>

  One day the talk turned to New Orleans. The bearded old guy told me, &#8220;Tim, the last time I was in New Orleans was before the war&hellip;&#8221; Then he grabbed my forearm in a suprisngly strong grip and announced, &#8220;Not the Civil War!!&#8221;<br>

		<p>The SCV would have us to believe that legions of blacks, Indians and Chinese fought for the Confederacy. It&rsquo;s amazing to me that this was only recently &#8220;discovered&#8221; within the past 20 years. Isn&rsquo;t it odd that only a handful of articles mention isolated cases of blacks fighting for the South? I would think that Lincoln and the Union Army would have used this in their propaganda, had large numbers of non-Whites been captured.</p>
<p>Perhaps in about 150 years some &#8220;historian&#8221; will write in a book that Himmler had 2 divisions of Jewish solders in the Waffen SS.</p>

		<p>A number of Confederate generals, notably Patrick Cleburne, advocated the enlistment of black troops early in the War. As blacks constituted about 3,000,000 of the South&rsquo;s 9,000,000 population, this would have resulted in a considerably greater pool of manpower.<br>
Later in the War, it became a popular position and came to be advocated by Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee, among many others. As usual, the Confederate Congress dragged its feet and did not approve the enlistment of blacks until March 1865  &mdash;  too late to do any good.<br>
At the time of Lee&rsquo;s surrender, there were no more than two companies of black soldiers in the Confederate armies. Neither saw action. </p>

Jonathan Jackson, aka Stonewall,has a monument on the hallowed grounds. It has four soldiers engraved in it on all sides guarding his statue down the ages. They are African Americans from cap to shoes,complete with a Springfield 58 cal,rifled muskets. Of all the Civil War generals on both sides,he was the most anti-slavery .He thought the war was God`s punishment on all America, even the rich Yankee slavers who endowed Yale.

		<p>The author of the textbook is acknowledged to not be a trained historian.  As a very well-trained historian myself, I can tell you that many of our school books written for the last 20 years have been essentially written by laymen who regurgitate whatever &#8216;facts&rsquo; they wish.</p>

		<p>At age 16, my great grandfather ran away from home and enlisted in the Confederate Army. A young family slave named Clark ran away with him. Clark helped my great grandfather with his equipment and foraged for food for both of them. Ultimately my great grandfather lost a leg outside Atlanta. Clark was rounded up by Federal troops, but later walked over 200 miles to return home.</p>
<p>After the War, Clark was never able to get his &#8220;40 acres and a mule&#8221; from the Freedman&rsquo;s Bureau. The family gave him 40 acres and a mule. Since that time there has always been a male member of the family named in remembrance and honor of Clark. </p>

<p>Another interesting point is reading the accounts of slavery from the actual slaves, not all of whom were in any way unhappy as slaves and many had loved their masters. These were interviews of former slaves still alive in the 1930&rsquo;s. It was a FDR make work project during the great depression era (&ldquo;Slave Narratives&rdquo;- very interesting readings).  <br>

		<p>When I was somewhat younger I was a voracious readon of Civil War literature, particularly from the Confederate vantage point. I focused, wherever possible, on personnel narratives written by actual soldiers, regimental histories and the day to day minutiae and experiences of the Southern Soldier. In all I read - which was a considerable undertaking - I came upon virtually NO mention of black Condeferates anywhere! </p>
<p>This whole topic seems to have taken on a life of its own in the past two decades. Yes, there were blacks among the Confederate ranks in some capacity(ie. cooks, teamsters, manservants, etc.). Were they common, or does their participation really carry some special meaning? Not really&hellip;</p>

		<p>#19, Tim Hatley, obviously an uninformed Yankee!  Only knows of the revisionist history forced on a defeated south by northerners.  #20 English Tony is correct about Gen. Patrick Cleburne&rsquo;s voice to the Confederate government to mass-enlist slaves.  After the Confederate Congress did finally pass the law, about 800,000 volunteered, yet only 300,000 was approved.  English Tony is correct, that there were only about 2 companies of black soldiers drilling in the streets of Richmond at Lee&rsquo;s surrender.  The emancipation proclamation was a war measure, and Lincoln admitted it was.  He thought the southern slaves would mass revolt against the women left in charge of family farms, but this never happened.<br>
  Aside all this, we whites really need to stand shoulder to shoulder and take back our nation.  Yet again, I would prefer to stand shoulder to shoulder with a great southern black man, H.K. Edgerton, than to a typical yankee like #19!  Mr. Edgerton&rsquo;s site, www.southernheritage411.com is perhaps the best history on Black Confederates in the War for Southern Independence.  And unlike today&rsquo;s yankees, we in the south are doing something about our future!<br>

  President Lincoln once queried General Winfield Scott, &#8220;General, why is it that Mexico City was taken with only 5,000 men and we cannot take Richmond with 100,000 men?&#8221;  The great General Scott replied, &#8220;those men who got us into Mexico City are the same men keeping us out of Richmond.&#8221;  For me and a considerably large number of Southerners, a southern black man who knows true history is a greater compatriot than any white yankee.  &#8216;Nuff said, DEO VINDICE!!!  </p>

		<p>The underlying cause of the Civil War was the North&rsquo;s desire to dominate the South.  Quibbling over the minute number of blacks within the Southern army does nothing to change this very basic fact. </p>

		<p>        I would certainly stand shoulder to shoulder with a level headed black, say like Thomas Sowell or Walter Williams, any day of the week than with a white liberal with whom I share no common ground at all . Especially those white liberals now in charge of the nation . However, it is all a moot subject as there are many black politicians and pundits in my state who are working overtime to disfranchise whites, especially white males,  in every conceivable way . I am talking Southern blacks here . I could name names but that probably would not be the thing to do, these black men and women do wield a certain amount of power . I am afraid it might leave this website somewhat vulnerable . But I do believe there is something big developing here and a lot of otherwise good blacks when forced to choose, will look after their own . I graduated nearly 40 years ago from an 87% black high school, grew up in a 72% black town  and now live in a 60% black town and county . So I do have a little experience here . The county to our south and to our north have over the last 35 years become essentially white enclaves . I believe my county will eventually be nearly 100% black . When the chips are down, we almost always choose our own tribe . That has never changed in the history of the world . I could also cite you a horrific murder case in which an all black jury acquitted the black trigger man on the most ridiculous, absolutely silly logic you have ever seen . Like I said, they tend to look after their own . Wisdom should dictate that we do the same . Our egalitarian nature threatens to destroy us . I also have the Charles Lunsford tape of a local show in S.C., hosted by a transplanted Yank and the man says up front that Northerners are literally fed a diet of pure propaganda about the Civil War. So you can&rsquo;t really blame Northerners when their views on the subject differ greatly from a Southerner&rsquo;s . We can sit back and carry on this debate till Miami is a 100 ft deep in a glacier, or we can reconcile our differences and move forward (which is what we had done from the Spanish/American War till after the Vietnam War) in a way that will perpetuate and preserve European culture and aid our white brethren .   </p>

		<p>Tim Hatley #19: Well, whether you believe it or not, there were Jews in the German Army, many were half Jewish, which made them subjects, instead of Citizens of Germany. Oddly enough, several were Officers, as well. </p>
<p>I recently saw a video of General von Boch reveiwing a Waffen SS Division made up of Asiatics from Turkmenistan. </p>
<p>There were also Indonesian volunteers from the Dutch Colony, for the Waffen SS, along with an Indian Legion, Arab Legion, Cossack Divison, White Russian Divisions, Ukrainian Divisions, etc.. </p>
<p>To the Germans, it was a war against International Communism, which was enbodied in the Soviet Union.</p>

		<p>Toussaint L&rsquo;Ouverture is a prominent slave in the history of the slave trade.  He rose up and fought the French oppressors.
