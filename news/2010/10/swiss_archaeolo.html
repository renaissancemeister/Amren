<h1>Swiss Archaeologists Find Door Into History</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FoxNews, October 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Archaeologists in the Swiss city of Zurich have unearthed a 5,000-year-old door that may be one of the oldest ever found in Europe.</p>
<p>The ancient poplar wood door is &#8220;solid and elegant&#8221; with well-preserved hinges and a &#8220;remarkable&#8221; design for holding the boards together, chief archaeologist Niels Bleicher said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Using tree rings to determine its age, Bleicher believes the door could have been made in the year 3,063 B.C.  &mdash;  around the time that construction on Britain&rsquo;s world famous Stonehenge monument began.</p>
<p>&#8220;The door is very remarkable because of the way the planks were held together,&#8221; Bleicher told The Associated Press.</p>
<p>Harsh climatic conditions at the time meant people had to build solid wood houses that would keep out much of the cold wind blowing across Lake Zurich, and the door would have helped, he said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a clever design that even looks good.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Helmut Schlichtherle, an archaeologist for the conservation department in the German state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, said finding an intact door was very rare, as usually only the foundations of stilt houses are preserved because they are submerged in water for millennia. Without air, the bacteria and fungi that usually destroy wood in a matter of years can&rsquo;t grow, meaning many lakes and moorlands in Europe are considered archaeological treasure troves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some might say it&rsquo;s only a door, but this is really a great find because it helps us better understand how people built their houses, and what technology they had,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Schlichtherle, who wasn&rsquo;t part of the Zurich dig, said over 200 stilt houses have been discovered in southern Germany alone, but to date no doors.</p>

		<p>Interesting article, but frustrating in that doesn&rsquo;t say what the &#8220;remarkable&#8221; design was for holding the planks together.</p>
<p>Go to the original article and see the picture. Note that the door was constructed of vertical planks with horizontal straps that went underneath a part of the vertical planks that was chiseled out.</p>

		<p>From the photo it looks like they have several large planks side by side with some holes cut in the planks to allow for a number of wooden &#8220;staples&#8221;. The staples apparently have holes drilled in each of the ends on the other side. By driving smaller planks through the large end of the staple and each of the smaller ends on the other side they could sandwich the planks together.</p>

		<p>Those folks at that time HAD to be inventive and innovative. Otherwise you would have froze. Europe at that time was felt to be primitive by the standards of the Middle East. However, the OLDEST building in the world is found at New Grange Ireland. Older than the pyramids and still in good shape. Astronomically and acoustically perfect. So what does that say?</p>

Horizon Project researcher Brent Miller disclosed and confirmed the fact that the ancient Egyptians made lightbulbs and that lighthouse style lanterns were used to light the Pharaos temple.<br>
So this information is not very surprising.<br>
Nonetheless, the discovery gives suggestions that the white race may have produced advancements in technology milleniums before stonehenge as evidenced in photographs of the worlds lost white undersea civilizations.</p>

		<p>Interesting to hear that our ancestors 5,000 years ago had the ability to make such aesthetically-apealling and practical devices.  I wonder if anything of the sort has ever been found in the Americas or Sub-Saharan Africa?</p>

		<p>Gosh, you mean the Swiss were making nice doors over 5k years ago. There are large parts of the world even today where the very concept of a door does not exist. But hey, they can&rsquo;t make watches in these parts of the world either because the concept of an &#8220;hour&#8221; or a &#8220;minute&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t exist. That&rsquo;s because the concept of &#8220;counting&#8221; beyond &#8220;one&#8221; and &#8220;many&#8221; is all they can manage. But wait, &#8220;race&#8221; is just a &#8220;social construct&#8221;. Right.</p>

		<p>In global studies classes, beyond a brief mention of Stonehedge, there is really nothing more mentioned about Europeans until the Greeks and Romans thousands of years later.</p>
<p>By contrast, the prehistoric culture of the Indus River valley will get a whole chapter, the Olmes, Toltecs and other primitves will invite entire projects and the voodoo cultures of Africa will be presented as vibrant wonderlands - based on one stone cattle corral known as &#8220;Great Zimbabwe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Funny thing is that pre Greco/Roman Europe (the Celts, early Germans, etc) had, according to the evidence, one heck of an advanced preliterate culture with huge trade networks, elaborate religions, craftsmanship, etc.</p>

		<p>With the inter-plank gaps as shown, that&rsquo;s not a mortise and tenise joint and I can&rsquo;t tell if the crosswise straps are set in or just achieved that state after such a long period under tension.</p>
<p>So instead, I&rsquo;m going to go with the old tried and true &#8216;get leather/rope/reeds wet, anchor them securely using wrap arounds and wait for tension to set in as they dry&rsquo; technique.  I think the Egyptians first used that one on some of their early ships.</p>
<p>If there is something advanced here, might it be that these straps (which also run vertically btw.) are securing each other as much as the wood, are metal and are perhaps -riveted- instead of tied?</p>
<p>Doors whose tension wrapping goes around both panel-sides don&rsquo;t do much good if the animals they are meant to keep out are in fact bipedal.</p>

		<p>Fascinating! I assume the hinges were made with bronze?</p>
