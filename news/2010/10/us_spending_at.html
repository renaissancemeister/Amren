<h1>U.S. Spending at Least $18.6&nbsp;Million Per Day to Incarcerate Illegal Aliens</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Edwin Mora, Cybercast News Service, October 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>U.S. taxpayers are spending at least $18.6 million per day to house an estimated 300,000 to 450,000 illegal immigrants who are incarcerated and eligible for deportation from the United States, according to data from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ).</p>
<p>The cost per day for these prisoners is based on Justice Department incarceration cost estimates from 2001 and on the lower-end figure of 300,000 incarcerated deportable aliens, which means the actual expense today could be substantially higher than $18.6 million per day.</p>
<p>The prisones involved here are foreign national who have come into the United States, committed a crime, been captured, and imprisoned.</p>
<p>Half of the undocumented aliens who were removed from the United States in fiscal 2010 (which ended on Sept. 30) had been convicted of a crime in the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In its March 2010 report, &#8220;Immigration Enforcement Actions: 2009,&#8221; the DHS defines removal as &#8220;the compulsory and confirmed movement of an inadmissible or deportable alien out of the United States based on an order of removal. An alien who is removed has administrative or criminal consequences placed on subsequent reentry owing to the fact of the removal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kara McCarthy, a spokeswoman at the DOJ, told CNSNews.com that the latest data available show that &#8220;average annual operating costs per state inmate for Fiscal Year 2001 was $22,650; in the Federal Bureau of Prisons it was $22,632.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The cost of $22,650 per year to house just one inmate at the state level equals about $62 a day ($22,650 divided by 365 days). In the Federal Bureau of Prisons, it also averages out to $62 per day ($22,632 divided by 365 days).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When CNSNews.com asked why incarcerated aliens who are eligible for removal have not been deported, a DHS spokesperson said, &#8220;It is because they are still serving their criminal sentence. ICE does not receive criminal aliens from state criminal justice systems until after they have completed their sentences.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the same day the IG&rsquo;s office released its performance plan report, DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano and ICE Director John Morton announced that half of the undocumented aliens who were removed from the United States in fiscal year 2010, which ended on Sept. 30, were convicted criminals.</p>

		<p>Imagine what $18.6 Million could do if instead of being spent on illegals, it was used to fix your local school or streets, or simply to lower your taxes.   </p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s an extra $6.8 billion a year, or enough for five Galileo-type unmanned space probe missions every year.  Note that we&rsquo;d only really need three: one each for Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, so in the first year alone, we&rsquo;d have 2.8 billion left over, which would get the air force 15 more of the discontinued Lockheed F-22 Raptors.</p>
<p>Alternately, that $6.8 billion would buy a whole lot of pizza and beer; we could have a really big party to celebrate the departure of our criminal alien invaders.</p>

		<p>If these illegal alien criminals knew with a certainty that they would NOT be sitting around the yard trading war stories, working in the laundry, watching TV, and getting free high quality medical care on the tax payer dollar, but instead were being made to WORK on chain gangs rejuvenating our county and State highways and infrastructure or working in the fields&hellip;.I wonder how many would remain here?  That would serve pretty well for our other largely ethnic groups presently incarcerated.  At the very least, if it didn&rsquo;t keep them from re-offending, it might at least defray tax payer expense for their upkeep and make jail that much more unattractive.  I like the cool hand Luke approach.  Escape once, a week in the box.  Escape twice, shot while trying to evade - no deportation required.  Otherwise, pave roads, weed whack, make gravel for roads, shovel said gravel, etc.  </p>

		<p>If I recall from my days working in a correctional facility, states get money from the fed (us taxpayers that is) for each prisoner in each facility&hellip;therefore, it is worth the effort for respective states to keep inmates as long as legally possible, legal or illegal and if legal citizens aren&rsquo;t breaking enough laws, ILLEGALS will do just as well&hellip;.keep inmates, get fed check, simple math! </p>

		<p>We need to charge the the country of origin for the arrest, keeping and deportation of their criminal citizens. If they refuse to pay, we close the border. Illegals from these countries will be considered spies and serve 20 years.    </p>

		<p>Bill R (#3), you work idea has merit, though it might provide escape opportunities. Besides, are these really workers? </p>
<p>Perhaps the best deterrent, which I would apply to our very own Grade A US citizen violent felons of all races, is solitary 23 hrs per day in an unairconditione, 10 x8 cell, and a continuous walk around the yard 30 minutes. (Stop walking, you just might be trying to escape.)</p>
<p>The other 30 minutes they would have all have to watch, every single day, Obama on a big screen in the Yard eating Five Guys Burgers (no sound, just chomping). I doubt you will see them or the US citizen criminals back in prison again. An Alternative would be for them to hear the entire Wagner Ring Cycle 24 hrs a day in their solitary cells, 365 days per yr (no translation in spanish or english). </p>
<p>I will bet one or two will like Wagner. Perhaps we can give that felon of good taste some hot sauerkraut on the side of his bologna sandwich as a reward.  </p>
<p>And the solitary cuts down on gangs, fights, and romance on the Block. Sigh.</p>

		<p>The common sense that oozes from these posters is more than exists in the whole of Washington D.C. Too many people are making obscene amounts of money off the status quo for it to change to anything containing an ounce of common sense.</p>
