<h1>Wake Schools Toss Out Zone Assignment Plan</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thomas Goldsmith, News &amp; Observer (Raleigh), October 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In a surprise reversal, the Wake County school board threw out its controversial, 16-zone student assignment plan Tuesday night on a motion by vice chairwoman Debra Goldman, who spent much of the meeting complaining about being shut out of the development of the plan.</p>
<p>Months of work by a Republican board majority elected last fall were cast aside in moments as Goldman, also one of those Republican newcomers, broke away and joined the former minority members, all Democrats, in a 5-3 vote to scrap the plan.</p>
<p>A directive passed out by Keith Sutton, a member of the minority who supported the board&rsquo;s old assignment policy, called for the following action: &#8220;Any and all efforts to create a zone-based assignment model will cease effective immediately.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} The motion means that the board will go back to the drawing board and proceed at a more deliberate pace, with more community input, as it crafts a new plan, Goldman said.</p>
<p>But on a night where she was the target of insults and accusations from her fellow Republican board members, Goldman stressed that the vote doesn&rsquo;t mean a return to the old student assignment policy that gave weight to diversity and reaffirmed her commitment to community-based schools.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tedesco, offering a handshake, approached Goldman before they left dais, saying, &#8220;I&rsquo;ve enjoyed our friendship while it lasted.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Goldman&rsquo;s pledge</b></p>
<p>Goldman was one of four new members elected last fall on a campaign to end the socioeconomic diversity policy in favor of moving to neighborhood schools. Despite Goldman&rsquo;s rejection of the plan that was being developed to divide the county into 16 zones, Goldman said Wake will still move toward community-based schools.</p>
<p>Shortly after she broke ranks with the majority, Tedesco angrily accused Goldman of trying to get more publicity for herself rather than trying to change the assignment plan.</p>

		<p>When White Humanity elects a Republican, all they get is someone who lies a little less betrays a little more slowly, but we eventually always get sold out by the progressives.  Didn&rsquo;t Reagan give amnesty to 3 million non citizens?  Didn&rsquo;t Bush agree that Katrina&rsquo;s suffering was caused by White racism?</p>

		<p>Commenter #1:  That&rsquo;s true, Republicans usually aren&rsquo;t much better than Democrats in the long run - Reagan&rsquo;s granting of amnesty beign the perfect example of this - but, in this case, remember that she does not object to the end of race-based busing.  She simply wishes to do it in a different way than what the plan proposed.</p>

		<p>Only the liberal media could refer to the idea of letting children attend nearby schools in their own neighborhoods as &#8220;a controversial plan&#8221;. </p>

		<p>Interesting that a plurality of the comments posted to the linked Newsobserver.com website have been deleted by the site and replaced with: &#8220;This comment violated our policy and has been removed.&#8221; </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d hazard to guess, though, that the comments weren&rsquo;t in the same vein as this gem of blindness: &#8220;Celebrate one of the greatest schools systems around and be grateful you do not live in the land of neighborhood school districts. I have seen them, they are very bad. A lot of people here left those areas on purpose.&#8221; Uh&hellip; and why would people move from a neighhood school if &#8220;they are very bad&#8221;? </p>
<p>We once lived in a city that bused and every three years my daughter&rsquo;s class would have been split up into fifths with each fifth being sent to a different school based on a random drawing. In other words, the parents&rsquo; choices of educational environment were completely negated. As can easily be guessed, the median income of that city has dropped over the years, and is now 2/3 of the county as a whole and 1/2 of that of the rest of our mostly rural state. And while the black population of the city is 15%, blacks comprise 45% of the public-school population. The city has nearly as many parochial school, of all denominations, as it has public schools. </p>
<p>When my child reached age 5, we moved. How does any of this help the citizens of that city?</p>

		<p>I live nowhere near Wake County but I&rsquo;ve previously read a couple of articles concerning the controversy. I remember being surprised when Goldman voted to end the busing because of some of the comments she had made. But it all makes sense now. She was a manchurian candidate.</p>
