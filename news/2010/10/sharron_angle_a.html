			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Grier, Christian Science Monitor, October 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sharron Angle has a new ad up that features Hispanic-appearing men carrying weapons and appearing in police mug shots. In the ad, she alleges that her opponent, incumbent Sen. Harry Reid (D) of Nevada, is soft on illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Has the Republican Senate candidate gone too far? {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hispanic and pro-immigration groups are furious. They say they will launch a Spanish-language ad blitz to try to counteract the effect of an ad which, they say, depicts Hispanics as criminals and thugs.</p>
<p>The groups  &mdash;  America&rsquo;s Voice, Mi Familia Vota, and Campaign for Community Change  &mdash;  said Tuesday that this campaign will try to convince Hispanics of the need to vote to counteract rising anti-immigrant sentiment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sharron Angle has decided to run one of the ugliest anti-illegal immigrants ad campaigns in history,&#8221; said Frank Sharry, executive director of America&rsquo;s Voice.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The producers of those ads defended them, saying that Democrats take the Hispanic vote for granted.</p>
<p>Ms. Angle&rsquo;s newest spot begins with quick cuts of a border crossing in El Paso, Texas, followed by a blurry image of swarthy, large men striding towards the camera. Then it shows a still photo of what appears to be a gang, with at least one man holding an assault rifle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Millions of illegal aliens, swarming across our border, joining violent gangs, forcing families to live in fear,&#8221; says the ad.</p>
<p>It then goes on to say that Senator Reid has voted to give illegal aliens Social Security numbers, among other things, and sided with President Obama and the President of Mexico to &#8220;block Arizona&rsquo;s tough new immigration law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whatever the harshness of the ad, it does address a real policy difference between the two Nevada Senate opponents. Reid supports policies that would allow illegal immigrants to become legal residents. Angle does not.</p>

		<p>Mi Familia Vota is implicated in voter fraud in Colorado and at least one other state.</p>
<p>Some are comparing this to Jesse Helms&rsquo;s 1990 &#8220;Hands&#8221; ad.  The comparison is apt   &mdash;   Both will help their candidates win, in spite of the odds.  Both will put their candidates over the top, IMHO.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Mi Familia Vota,?&#8221; Are they an organization of AMERICAN  voters?  While they&rsquo;re at it, why don&rsquo;t they enlist &#8220;La Raza,&#8221; the open, pro-actively racist tribal promoters? Been to Nevada about 30 times in the past few decades: started seeing a BIG change in the early 90s, a flood (especially in the Vegas area) from about 2002 on. Stopped to going to Vegas a few years ago, partially because of the numbers of tattooed gangsters, illegal immigrant porn-pushers on street corners (you tourists know what I&rsquo;m talking about), and surly, drunken Mexicans everywhere.  The police apparently do nothing.  Even in northern Nevada, there are numerous all-Spanish TV and radio stations, and much of the construction was done by Spanish-speakers, probably illegal. </p>

		<p>Hundreds of square miles of Arizona have been converted into a war zone by Mexican drug lords.  Our federal government does nothing but put up signs warning American citizens to stay away.  But Sharron Angle is labeled a racist for telling the truth about Harry Reid&rsquo;s advocacy for the invaders.<br>

		<p>Harry Reid has been comfortable with the Mafia in Las Vegas for years. Why should he feel discomfort about Mexican thugs? The cartels will reward him handsomely. They are ready to make the same move the Mafia made years ago: buy up the Congress and the state governments. This time the FBI won&rsquo;t do anything. The White House itself is in cahoots with the Mexican conspiracy to seize the Southwest and turn in into their base from which the rest of North America will be seized.</p>

		<p>Of course the liberal wing nut media will call Ms. Angle&rsquo;s ad racist. Why, anything that portrays the poor, downtrodden brown masses in a bad light simply cannot be allowed! Even if it is the truth! How else can they brainwash our children unless they attack anything that smacks of the truth. They work so hard at it, downplaying or outright eliminating any disparaging news items, changing factual school curriculum and textbooks to reflect their own version of historical events, and refusing to categorize and prosecute black on white crime as &#8220;hate crime&#8221;, not even extending to white people the same protection under the law that brown people enjoy.                                </p>
<p>I hope Sharron Angle wins. Her ad made me laugh and cheer. About time. I just wish there were more ads and candidates like her.</p>

<p>I think proof that she is going to win is that obnoxious frontrunner John McCain is going to NV to &#8220;help&#8221; her.  First off, as 2008 proved, he can&rsquo;t help you any.  So this proves that the only reason he&rsquo;s going is that it&rsquo;s obvious she&rsquo;s going to win, and he wants in on some of the credit.  Of course, she would win without him going in on this last weekend of the campaign, and I hope that&rsquo;s a fact not lost on many people.</p>

		<p>The sad fact is - the ad is true. How come no one will face this on the left?</p>
<p>There are not a whole lot of white gangs terrorizing America. </p>
<p>America will NOT deal with the face of the crime or criminals that do 90% of ALL crime. Sdly. Can;t even have the dialog. If one attempts too? Attacks and name calling are the only thing the left knows. And they attack all races that speak the truth. Ask Cosby. </p>
<p>And truly those that benefit and take advantage of this &#8220;not dealing with&#8221;? The criminals. Laughing as people do not talk or open their mouth. Or confront the criminals. </p>
<p>Angle is to be commended.</p>

		<p>Politcal correctness makes it a thought crime to portray and non-whites as criminals in any public forum.  Only white people can be depicted as criminals.  Then no one will say anything.</p>
<p>It dawned on me one day after watching all those CSI and other cop shows for the last ten years.  (Also the Mentalist, Special Victims Unit, you name it.)</p>
<p>Basically, all the criminals are white.  Very rarely they show a non-white criminal, and usually then mitigating circumstances are given to show &#8216;why&rsquo; they had to resort to a life of crime.  (To feed my blind, handicapped daughter!)</p>
<p>So this candidate in Nevada broke that rule and the wrath of the liberals is coming down on her.  Even in the media they only say the race of the criminal if he is white.</p>

		<p>  Whatever anyone thinks of George W. Bush, I don&rsquo;t recall the media or the race-fixated Democrat leadership going into their standard hyperbolic faux-outrage routine back when a Democratic commercial accused Bush of &#8220;murdering James Byrd again&#8221; or some such nonsense in 2000.  An utterly tasteless, ruthless, callous exploitation ad, complete with a pickup truck dragging chains behind it. And Bush had done what, exactly, to merit that?  He didn&rsquo;t brutalize James Byrd.  Moreover, weren&rsquo;t the men who murdered Mr. Byrd sentenced to death?  What more could have been done to punish them? </p>
<p>   And well do many of us know the radio ad of, I think, 1998, which I seem to remember aired in Missouri, that if the GOP were elected, black churches would burn and &#8220;sisters and brothers&#8221; would be shot. If memory serves black liberal columnist Clarence Page was then on TV  &mdash;  probably the McLaughlin show  &mdash;  saying that during election season &#8220;you use fear, you use love, use whatever you have to.&#8221;  Not a whisper of outrage from the same Propaganda Ministry hacks whose needles are STILL stuck on the Willie Horton ad of twenty-two years ago, and on the fact that Ronald Reagan may have said &#8220;welfare queen&#8221; nearly thirty years ago.  </p>
<p>   Someone ought to ask that toad-like race agitator Menendez of NJ another question. It&rsquo;s something about which I&rsquo;ve been wondering since I first saw this spot: are any of the Hispanics in the ad actors, and if the ad is &#8220;racist&#8221; &#8220;xenophobic&#8221; or any of the usual speech-suppressing weasel words, why did the actors choose to participate in it?  Evidently that aspect didn&rsquo;t bother them very much.<br>
  <br>
   The multi-cultis will follow their standard script in the wake of this.  They shall invariably invoke comparisons to earlier negative stereotypes about previous generations of immigrants; I.E., Germans, Irish, Poles, Jews, Czechs, Slovaks, Greeks, and of course my own salt-of-the-Earth Italian ancestors.  (Although disparagement of Italians didn&rsquo;t trouble them when done by Rev. Wright, Leonard Jeffries or Hollywood.) They will blather that they are &#8220;just like the immigrants before them were.&#8221;</p>
<p>   How dare they, for shame, to draw such a parallel? The old mostly-European immigrants put more into this society than they ever took out of it, they contributed infinitely more than they absorbed.  They died for this republic by the thousands. (I enjoy telling historically ignorant people that there were Italians in the Civil War, both sides, from Beauregard on his mother&rsquo;s side to the 39th New York, Garibaldi Guard, a Foreign Legion if ever there was.  And some have looked at me like I had sprouted two extra heads.  They can&rsquo;t seem to grasp that some Italians came before the Great Wave.  And when I follow up and inform them them that there were Italians in the Revolution too, and that two signers of the Declaration  &mdash;  Paca and Rodney  &mdash;   possessed Italian heritage, smelling salts are often in order.)  <br>
 <br>
   The immigrants of yesteryear imposed nothing resembling the social welfare or cultural burdens many of the newcomers do today.  They pushed their children to assimilate and be better than they themselves were, and they tried to take care of their own.  They had their own charities and philanthropic movements.  Many who failed here went back home, which is all but forgotten today.  There wasn&rsquo;t much of a welfare state and no one was going to pamper the lazy, the unlucky, the unassimilable or the screw-ups.  Whereas today, there is no incentive to leave as Uncle Sucker will attend to all the Earthly needs and wants of our invading hordes, or rather will force us at gunpoint to indulge same. All while citizens have to beg and crawl to be allowed to earn enough just to live.  Hopefully the begging and crawling days are nearing their end, and some, shall we say, &#8220;old attitudes&#8221; will become new again in our lifetimes.</p>
<p>   Furthermore, one of the chief sources of resentment toward many of today&rsquo;s immigrants  &mdash;  legal AND illegal  &mdash;  is that all manner of accommodations are made for them that were NEVER made for the earlier arrivals. Nor did most of those earlier immigrants expect it&hellip;wheedling and demanding wasn&rsquo;t in their DNA, not for the majority of them. But working and striving and pride were.  We had our miscreants, criminals, socialists, etc.  and some even attained a kind of celebrity, but most of our ancestors had little time or use for them. They just wanted to succeed and live in peace.  <br>
 <br>
   Yet the media have the unmitigated gall to ignore the difference between how much was expected of predominatly WHITE immigrants as late as the 1950s, and how little is expected of non-white immigrants  &mdash;  especially those who are egregious law breakers by virute of their very means and methods of ingress  &mdash;  today. <br>

		<p>Well, duh, most of the illegals and the criminals in Las Vegas  &mdash;  as well as every other city and town blacks turn into ghettos when they get a sizable number  &mdash;  are Hispanic. Blacks and hispanics can outright lie about things we do to them (and never talk about what they do to us), yet they can&rsquo;t deal with facts.  They always say, &#8220;Well, white folks duz em&rsquo;, yo&#8221;  Look at how that Queen Latifah reacted when Jared got on her show and presented facts.</p>

<p>Feller, I agree. I finally came to the conclusion that the only reason the government won&rsquo;t do anything about the Southern border is because too many of the politicians are in bed with the cartels. <br>

<p>Jay, you need to start watching the true crime shows and documentaries. Almost all the perps are Black. There&rsquo;s even a documentary out there about the Witchita Massacre. I guess with the documentaries they can&rsquo;t hide the race because it would be so easy to look it up and find out.    </p>

		<p>Uh, yeah, I think the reason she chose to feature Hispanics in her anti-illegal immigrant ad is simply because - wait for it - illegal immigrants are Hispanic!  It&rsquo;s so obvious, I can&rsquo;t believe some Hispanics are actually offended by this.  It&rsquo;s like if they made a World War II film and showed all the Nazis as Germans.  I am part German, but would I be offended?  Absolutely not.  After all there weren&rsquo;t many Pollacks, Russians, or Jews running around saluting Hitler.  The same thing with illegal immigrants - they are OVER-WHELMINGLY Hispanic, so show them as such.</p>

		<p>If you say you like them, you&rsquo;re pandering, condescending and patronizing. If you say you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re an ignorant bigot. If you say you have lots of them as friends or as a good friend, this is a sure sign of your inherent racism. If you imitate them you&rsquo;re cheaply stealing from their culture. In many of the most enlightened courses in our nation, they teach that if you are white, it&rsquo;s not whether you are a racist or not, you simply are. It would actually make sense if they could only get the races in their proper role. I guess that&rsquo;s too much to ask for people who study race for a living 24/7&hellip;</p>

		<p>The big news here is the reaction. After the ad ran, the usual people said the usual things. Joy Behar in particular assailed Angle as a b*tch and, yes, racist on the air. All the rest of the liberal jackdaws starting squawking in unison. </p>
<p>At that point, the script called for Angle to assume the position,apologize, beg for mercy, and kiss the Right Reverend Jesse Jackson&rsquo;s ass on national TV. And, of course, her political support would disappear. She had been officially labelled a racist, hadn&rsquo;t she?</p>
<p>The day after Behar trashed Angle as a racist, she broke a record by raising $150,000 in one day. She *gained* support during the attack. And she cocked a snook at the PC overlords by sending Behar a bouquet and a saucy note &#8220;thanking&#8221; her for her &#8220;help&#8221;. </p>
<p>Sharron Angle has not apologized, and she is still in the race. </p>
<p>The R-bomb is losing it&rsquo;s sting. That&rsquo;s progress. </p>

How many of those swarthy men are Paks or Arabs who&rsquo;ve come here to kill us? </p>
<p>There was an Ad. against a local politician in the Philly area accusing him of being insensitive to people&rsquo;s safety due to his support for Second Amendment rights. The ad talked about the numerous gun crimes committed in America and showed a parade of White men being led out in handcuffs by law enforcement officers.These were shirt film clips; all from different places.  There was no evidence of what these particular guys where charged with but they were ALL WHITE. It shows the utter lack of respect for the intelligence of the American voter. In spite of the irrefutable evidence of the role of Blacks in gun violence they still continue with this lie.</p>

		<p>For anyone in the AR community who likes to read, I will highly recommend a book by Jeff Gates, &#8216;Guilt By Association&rsquo;.   Gates devotes several chapters to outlining the history of unbelievable corruption that permeates the US political landscape, going back decades - and John McCain&rsquo;s associations with some of the seediest and most notorious high-profile criminal figures and heavy hitters involved organized crime are featured in several eye-opening chapters.  </p>
<p>When I stop to reflect on how close this guy came to being installed into the White House, it makes me stop to think just how ill-informed, uneducated, and downright lazy so many millions of White Americans are who voted for this sleazy character.   White Americans need to do a far better job in the future and start doing their homework on these politicians who are being &#8216;held up in front of them&rsquo; and presented to them as their only choice on election day.  </p>
<p>Actually, Obama has been good for us one very important respect.  He has managed to awaken a seed of white racial consciousness in an otherwise pathetically deracinated and self-hating, racially timid white majority.  Had this guy McCain been elected - none of this would have happened, and he would have crammed amnesty down the throats of the very people who voted for him by this time.  </p>
<p>Conclusion:  Our mortal enemy made a huge tactical blunder when they foisted Obama on us, while whites are still a majority in America.   And, Sharon Angle is giving the rest of these neo-con, RINO GOP traitors a classroom lesson on what tactics will determine the future for energizing the white conservative base.   <br>

		<p>Is it racist to automatically take the side of Hispanics because of racial politics?  I have wondered why they are never attacked as racists and traitors vs. being fetted like heros.  </p>

		<p>My problem is that these are election tactics and they are working, as one poster noted, in one particular area -inundated- with &#8216;the problem&rsquo;.</p>
<p>You take this back East and you see how well it sells.  Not just in the liberal media.  But in Congress.  Where a Senator or Congress person has to be able to wheel and deal with other Congressional delegates who may make it their business to make her a racist pariah.</p>
<p>People with Hispanic connections they depend on to get reelected.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not enough to make an inroad to &#8216;meh-level&rsquo; ineffectuality of the R-bomb.  We need a FORCEFUL and large body of people that can turn to each other to get jobs done.  We need what the other races already have in the forms of the Black Caucus and the like.  It needs to be bipartisan and it needs to be from states with powerful presence on key committees, states whose business interests will be &#8216;anti-racist&rsquo; for all the usual reasons.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the biggest fear I have is that half or more of the country isn&rsquo;t ready for that mutual threat = total commitment level reversal at the JQ Public level and so this rise in race consciousness in nominally &#8216;front line&rsquo; states could lose it&rsquo;s momentum on the simple basis of political negation of those whose candidacy is deemed &#8216;extreme right&rsquo; enough to mess with business as usual.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s my take on this &#8220;political&#8221; situation we&rsquo;re in. Even if Sharon Angle is the real McCoy, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. This nation is heading full speed ahead towards it&rsquo;s destiny. Individuals, parties, churches, ideas are all passee now. Nobody can get in front of what&rsquo;s going to happen without getting run diwn now. Things have gone too far. This is all going to end up violently. The die is cast. There&rsquo;s no turning back now. Accept that, don&rsquo;t get caught flat footed when everything comes apart. </p>
<p>Not to get too religious (I do believe in God though), but &#8220;praise the Lord and pass the ammunition!!!&#8221;</p>

		<p>One more day to November 2nd. then we will all know the truth. Is America ready to return to being America or are we still on that rocky road to socialism? We will most certainly get what we ask for..</p>

		<p>At the same time, evidently it&rsquo;s of no significance that virtually all mass media routinely portray violent criminals, the generally clueless portions of the population but especially the technologically befuddled, the most incompetent participant in any field of endeavor, and of course racists as white, white, white. </p>
