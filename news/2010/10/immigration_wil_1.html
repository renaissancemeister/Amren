			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeanette Moses, Time, October 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With an eye to the example of Arizona, Utah, which may have upwards of 110,000 undocumented aliens, may be taking the issue of illegal immigration into its own hands. Earlier this week, a group of 12 Utah legislators from the house and senate (three Democrats and nine Republicans) traveled to their controversial neighbor to the south to learn more about the impact of passing statewide immigration reforms.</p>
<p>The two-day trip, which the lawmakers paid for themselves, consisted of meetings with Arizona officials, business leaders, religious communities, heads of the public school system and, unsurprisingly, border-patrol agents. According to senate president Michael Waddoups, who was among the group, Utah legislators took note of the popular support for Arizona&rsquo;s controversial legislation. &#8220;They&rsquo;re trying to represent what the people want them to,&#8221; says Waddoups. &#8220;That&rsquo;s American politics at its best  &mdash;  representing the constituents.&#8221;</p>
<p>The trip comes approximately a month after Utah Representative Stephen Sandstrom released a draft of his Illegal Immigration Enforcement Act. The bill, likely to be just the first of many immigration bills headed for the January legislative session, is modeled on the Arizona law. {snip}</p>
<p>While Sandstrom says his bill has widespread support, it is already proving to be divisive, even within his party. Michael Clara, the state chair of the Utah Republican Hispanic Assembly, says the bill is part of a witch hunt and takes issue with it on a variety of grounds: for violating the Fourth Amendment guarantees against unreasonable searches, for its negative economic impact and for the fact that it punishes a single group of people and not the many others who are complicit in creating the current problem with undocumented workers. &#8220;We put the &#8216;No Trespassing&rsquo; sign at the border, and right behind, we put the &#8216;Help Wanted&rsquo; sign,&#8221; Clara says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other Utah legislators worry that the bill will be too costly. {snip}</p>

		<p>Um, how about have the law enforcement and our miltary knock on their houses and deport them at the barrell of a gun?  Just a thought.  We did it in the 1950s and it seemed to work. Then again, we didn&rsquo;t have as many illegals then, we were proud of our race, and we weren&rsquo;t afraid of offending blacks, hispanics, etc</p>

&hellip;says the bill is part of a witch hunt and takes issue with it on a variety of grounds: for violating the Fourth Amendment guarantees against unreasonable searches, for its negative economic impact and for the fact that it punishes a single group of people and not the many others who are complicit in creating the current problem with undocumented workers.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>So you admit you are working for the other side.  You admit there is &#8216;a problem&rsquo; with undocumented workers.  And yet you feel persecuted &#8216;as a single group&rsquo; because you are not part of OUR group yet you want the benefits we accrue to ourselves?</p>
<p>Hypocrisy in action, given Mexican&rsquo;s _have a homeland_ and none of them would be here if it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that ours is better.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
&ldquo;We put the &lsquo;No Trespassing&rsquo; sign at the border, and right behind, we put the &lsquo;Help Wanted&rsquo; sign,&rdquo; Clara says.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s &#8216;we&rsquo;?  I don&rsquo;t see any flagging in the majority opinion of American Whites who don&rsquo;t want to lose the European heritage of this nation to a bunch of illegal immigrants who blew up their own country and now wish to come ruin ours.</p>
<p>Now maybe it was an Elite that put up this second sign without our knowing it.  Or maybe you&rsquo;re just erecting a little straw man of your own.</p>
<p>But the fact is the current economic climate does not support further immigration of -any- kind and history would suggest heterogenous cultures throughout history have only succeeded in factionalizing and isolating the resources by which societies are built.</p>
<p>The demographic nation which does not breed together falls apart as each ethny cuts their own slice of the state and market share pie.  And always tries to cut more based on population growth and rival political access to social benefits as transfer payments that ONLY the tax payers pay into.  Taxes the corporations who hire without documentation are not subject to.  Payments the political elites looking to corner a voter bloc and thus &#8216;elect a new people&rsquo; ini refurbishing their entirely ineffective political strategy, don&rsquo;t care about.</p>
<p>Homogeny of culture is inherent to a validity of opinion as a sharaeable belief system based on success of breeding into a new generation and one only needs look at the childish rivalries in our government to understand that spoiling tactics and divisive refusal to participate, politically, along the lines of opinion of those who _voted you into office_ can do to a nation&rsquo;s ability to achieve ANYTHING without that homogenous sense of a shared outcome as breedable common benefit.</p>
<p>American&rsquo;s know that it will do them no good to import poverty.  Perhaps if Mr. Clara wasn&rsquo;t such a racist as to put being Hispanic ahead of being an American, he too could achieve something of worth.</p>

		<p>Billy Arppp is right on the money with his comment. All that those Utah politicians are going to do is make useless gestures and tough statements that might inspire gullible voters to keep them in office, but will do nothing to get rid of the invaders.</p>
<p>They will pass an unenforcible law, then they will play talking heads on the evening news as the typical lawsuits work their way through courts that are controlled by the people who have long perpetuated and facilitated illegal immigration. </p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that the illegals are here by design. The foxes are guarding the chickens and the lunatics are running the asylum. The people that everyone is looking to for a solution ARE THE PROBLEM. </p>
<p>If the PEOPLE of Utah clearly demonstrate that they want the illegals to leave, the illegals will leave in great haste.</p>
<p>Stop waiting for Claire to tell you what time it is. </p>

<p>The empire is deteriorating rapidly.</p>
<p>What proper immigration control could have done in the past, the economy will do for us in the next couple of years, beginning right now.</p>
<p>The D word is no longer being denied as coming about in the next few months.  Full fledged, I mean.  We&rsquo;ve been into a mini-depression of sorts for months now.</p>
<p>When the greatest depression is at its height&hellip;..before and after for a long time to come&hellip;&hellip;.aliens will be leaving this sinking ship like rats desperate to get away before it goes down all the way.</p>
<p>By that time, I&rsquo;m pretty sure we&rsquo;ll be in an irreversible trend toward complete break up, via secessation, peaceful and violent both.<br>

		<p>I live in Utah and I will say that we do have a serious illegal problem. I partially blame the LDS church since they do have a very welcoming attitude toward anyone coming from foriegn countries. It was incredibly frustrating to me a couple of years ago when fuel costs had decreased loads for truck drivers and we were hurting financially to see obvious illegals with one and sometimes two overflowing carts of groceries and paying with a food stamps card. We were struggling to buy baby formula and groceries with around 40.00 a week and with the prices of formula you can imagine what kind of groceries we were getting. We finally had to apply for WIC to keep our from going broke. Meanwhile the illegals were working under the table and getting rent assistance, free food and free medical care. It was all I could do to keep from blowing up. </p>

		<p>Old White Jim was spot-on when he said the foxes are guarding the henhouse.  By way of example, for all his tough talk on illegal immigration Tom Tancredo had his basement here in Colorado finished by a crew of whom only two spoke any English at all.  Did he ask for identification from any of the others to see whether they were entitled to work in this country?  No, he did not.</p>
<p>Tancredo is now running as an independant &#8220;spoiler&#8221; in the state gubernatorial election, an act that will virtually guarantee that democrat incumbant John Hickenlooper will be reelected instead of Dan Maes.  Guys like Tancredo are the problem, not the solution.  Maybe Maes will turn out to be just another neo-con shill, but we already know where we stand with Hickenlooper.<br>

		<p>10-MCS: I have to take issue with this statement.  Just what was the Congressman supposed to do? Ask all of them for their Social Security cards, and then have them all wait around while he calls Social Security to verify the numbers?  What if they had produced fake Green Cards?  How would he, or anyone else for that matter, be able to verify the cards validity? Then of course, these are the same people (people he just accused of possible illegal activity) he is to let into his house for days or weeks while they do (hopefully) a profession job? And where prayfully the home doesn&rsquo;t mysteriously catch fire and burn to the ground they day after the workers leave?  We all should have a sense that everyone who is working in the U.S. is doing so legally.  That we have such discourse and continuing problems over the issue of illegal immigration shows the abject failure of our Government in this regard. Otherwise, as I see it, Tancredo is one of the few politicians we have who might actually do something about the situation and bring some common sense to immigration policy; he is not the problem. And yes, we know where we stand with the illegal-employing, sanctuary-city leader we have in Hickenlooper, and I for one would rather stand with Tancredo.</p>

		<p>I did exactly that, BannerRWB when I had new carpet installed.  I told the salesman at Lowes that I would not tolerate noncitizens working in my home and that I would be checking drivers&rsquo; licenses.  And when the crew showed up, I did exactly that after informing them that anyone who didn&rsquo;t like it was free to leave.</p>

		<p>13-MCS: I applaud your efforts, but I believe the points of my original post remain, in that 1) It&rsquo;s easy to get fake documents, including a drivers license, 2) The average citizen isn&rsquo;t able to verify the validity of such documents, and 3) Tancredo, moreso than anyone else in politics today, may actually do something about it.  In any case, it shouldn&rsquo;t be up to the average citizen to validate a worker&rsquo;s legality.</p>
<p>The following, from an initial search on &#8220;how to get a fake driver&rsquo;s license&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3078924" rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3078924</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;The findings showed me that there isn&rsquo;t a state in the nation geared up to being concerned about fake IDs before giving a drivers license.&rdquo;</p>

Tancredo once hired a business to do work on his house.  It was not his responsibility to ask the workers whether they were legal, that was the business owner&rsquo;s responsibility.  I think you are being too harsh one him since Tancredo was the leader of the house immigration caucas.  He was the one who drove the whole resistance to illegal immigration.  As a result, he was persona non grata with the Bush White House.  Tancredo represents that faction of the Republican party that is fighting the establishment, the Tea Party is also part of that rebellion.  As far as Tancredo being a spoiler, I don&rsquo;t think that is so, rather I think that he had to run outside of the two established parties because neither wanted anything to do with Tancredo&rsquo;s anti-illegal immigration agenda.</p>

		<p>Notice how anything the liberal media dislikes is tarred as &#8220;controversial&#8221;, even if 70% or more of the population supports it. Immigration control is about as &#8220;controversial&#8221; as the proposition that the sky is blue, yet most articles I read on it refer to it as &#8220;controversial&#8221; because the very same media disapproves. The media liberals and their allies in academia are masters at language manipulation and creating impressions about things that just ain&rsquo;t so. Bias can be more subtle than mere stated propositions: indeed, it&rsquo;s this capturing of the language that has so helped the left. Once you start using their language (&#8220;homophobia&#8221;, &#8220;hate crime&#8221;, &#8220;gender&#8221;, on and on) or stop identifying its disingenuous usage and intent, they&rsquo;ve already won half the battle.</p>
