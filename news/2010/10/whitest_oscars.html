<h1>Whitest Oscars in 10 Years?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gregg Kilday and Matthew Belloni, Hollywood Reporter, September 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Will white be the only color on the red carpet at the 83rd Academy Awards?</p>
<p>Although Oscar contenders are just lining up at the starting gate for the annual run for the gold, there&rsquo;s a real possibility that for the first time since the 73rd Oscars 10 years ago, there will be no black nominees in any of the acting categories at the February ceremony. In fact, there are virtually no minorities in any of the major categories among the early lists of awards hopefuls.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s more difficult than ever to get a picture made with any serious subject matter  &mdash;  let alone an ethnic-themed one,&#8221; John Singleton, an Academy member and two-time Oscar nominee for 1991&rsquo;s &#8220;Boyz N the Hood,&#8221; said of the current filmmaking environment, which has in turn narrowed Oscar&rsquo;s choices.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This year, the early lineup, in a review of contenders by THR, is striking for its near-total absence of actors of color.</p>
<p>&#8220;The King&rsquo;s Speech&#8221; focuses on the very proper British royal family; &#8220;Black Swan&#8221; is set among pale-skinned New York ballerinas; &#8220;127 Hours&#8221; details the survival saga of one (white) dude; &#8220;The Social Network,&#8221; &#8220;The Kids Are All Right,&#8221; &#8220;Hereafter&#8221; and &#8220;The Town&#8221; all feature fairly homogeneously Caucasian casts and key creative talent.</p>
<p>Belgian actress Cecile de France, an early contender for &#8220;Hereafter,&#8221; and Spaniard Javier Bardem, Cannes&rsquo; best actor winner for &#8220;Biutiful,&#8221; are in the mix, at least lending a couple of foreign accents. And it&rsquo;s still possible, of course, that a yet un-hyped movie could surface that will change the complexion of the race.</p>
<p>But several awards consultants said they can&rsquo;t figure out exactly where it would come from.</p>
<p>Tyler Perry&rsquo;s &#8220;For Colored Girls,&#8221; an adaptation of Ntozake Shange&rsquo;s 1975 play &#8220;For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow is Enuf,&#8221; is one of the few remaining question marks, since Lionsgate has not yet begun screening the movie, which opens Nov. 5. The cast includes one past Oscar winner in Whoopi Goldberg along with Thandie Newton, Anika Noni Rose, Kerry Washington, Kimberly Elise, Loretta Devine, Phylicia Rashad and Janet Jackson.</p>
<p>But while it marks a serious turn for Perry, who&rsquo;s known for his commercial comedies, it&rsquo;s unclear whether any of the individual performances could emerge from the ensemble to claim a nomination. (Jackson&rsquo;s best shot at a nom may be in the song category, since she&rsquo;s also co-writer of the tune &#8220;Nothing,&#8221; which is on the soundtrack of Perry&rsquo;s &#8220;Why Did I Get Married Too?&#8221;)</p>
<p>&#8220;Perry is currently the only African-American with an ongoing concern at a studio, and he continues to, as black people say, &#8216;Hold it down&rsquo; with pictures that draw a core black audience as well as others,&#8221; Singleton observed. &#8220;But, sadly, this is a sector that most of the rest of the industry has neglected as of late with middling comedies.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the Oscar nominations, which will be revealed Jan. 25, do go to an all-white cast of actors, that&rsquo;s sure to put the Academy in an uncomfortable position since it&rsquo;s been making real efforts to ensure its own membership is more diverse.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But when it comes to bestowing Oscars, the Academy is at the mercy of whatever films are available.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It feels kind of circumstantial,&#8221; one member of Hollywood&rsquo;s black community said about this year&rsquo;s lack of black contenders. &#8220;Maybe you could get some studio people to address it, but then there are no black studio executives, which is another story.&#8221;</p>
<p>The last time the Academy was forced to confront the issue was the 68th Academy Awards, which took place in 1996. Although Quincy Jones served as the show&rsquo;s producer that year and Goldberg was host, the Rev. Jesse Jackson used the awards to protest &#8220;the paucity of nominations of people of color [which] is directly related to the lack of films featuring the talents of people of color.&#8221; While he didn&rsquo;t target the actual ceremony at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, he called for a viewer boycott and protests at ABC affiliates.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Over the past decade, the issue has subsided, although the number of minority nominees has often depended on just one or two releases that changed the face of the noms dramatically. For example, 2006&rsquo;s globe-trotting &#8220;Babel&#8221; secured supporting actress noms for Mexico&rsquo;s Barraza and Japan&rsquo;s Rinko Kikuchi. They became part of one of Oscar&rsquo;s most diverse group of acting nominees, joining Forest Whitaker (&#8220;The Last King of Scotland&#8221;), Will Smith (&#8220;The Pursuit of Happyness&#8221;), Penelope Cruz (&#8220;Volver&#8221;), Djimon Honsou (&#8220;Blood Diamond&#8221;) and both Jennifer Hudson and Eddie Murphy from &#8220;Dreamgirls.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Minority actors certainly are finding work: They are featured prominently in nearly half of 2010&rsquo;s top 20 domestic-grossers, whether it&rsquo;s Don Cheadle and Samuel L. Jackson lending their muscle to &#8220;Iron Man 2,&#8221; Eddie Murphy voicing Donkey in &#8220;Shrek Forever After,&#8221; young Jaden Smith following in his dad Will&rsquo;s shoes in &#8220;Karate Kid&#8221; with the help of Jackie Chan or Jamie Foxx and Queen Latifah popping up in &#8220;Valentine&rsquo;s Day.&#8221; But those aren&rsquo;t the kind of movies that generally win the Academy&rsquo;s respect.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Diverse films are being made, but they are not necessarily being picked up for distribution,&#8221; said Rebecca Yee, SAG national director and senior EEO counsel for affirmative action and diversity. Under SAG&rsquo;s low budget agreements, producers are allowed to increase overall budgets if they demonstrate they are achieving diversity goals. &#8220;A lot of producers come to us to use those incentives,&#8221; Yee explained, but if their completed films don&rsquo;t attract the interest of distributors, &#8220;it&rsquo;s hard for them to get their movies seen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;African-American-themed projects are now being relegated to specialty pictures  &mdash;  as they were in the &rsquo;80s before Spike Lee,&#8221; Singleton said.</p>
<p>Hollywood might not be taking full advantage of the potential audience: According to the MPAA, Hispanics comprise 15% of the U.S. population, but they buy 21% of the movie tickets; blacks, 12% of the population, buy another 11%.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Those percentages are not likely to be reflected at this year&rsquo;s Oscars. Right now, barring a surprise entry in the race, the major categories are in danger of looking like a whites-only club.<br>

<p>You have got to be kidding me. Cheadle put out the blandest performance of his career and Jackson plays the exact same character he plays in every film he&rsquo;s in.</p>
<p>This article is another nice reminder of the liberal mantra : Anything white is a problem. A problem that must be fixed.</p>

		<p>Notice how many anti-white slurs in this article: &#8220;pale-skinned&#8221; (sounds sickly), &#8220;fairly homogeneously Caucasian casts,&#8221; &#8220;people of color&#8221; (as opposed to people of no color, I guess), etc.</p>
<p>And now we have to worry not only about there being nonwhites in every picture out of Hollywood, but we also have to obsess over how many win awards too? I guess racial head counting has become the new national obsession.</p>
<p>Welcome to the new &#8220;color blind&#8221; America, where everything is determined by quotas.</p>

		<p>I will enjoy the oscars this year.  By the way, reading this reminds me of the 1997 film &#8220;Titanic.&#8221;  It was, in my opinion, one of the best movies ever made.  And it is also notable for featuring just THREE minorities, in a cast of hundreds (including the extras).  And they were Egyptian, and only appeared for a few seconds as Rose and Jack run down a hallway to get to the lifeboats.  And what&rsquo;s funny is that, historically, there was a fairly prominent mixed-race Haitian family that could have been featured in at least a minor role, in order to increase the amount of diversity in the movie.  But the makers of the movie made the right choice and didn&rsquo;t include them at all, leaving Titanic a beautiful display of opulence, romance, and tragedy, whereas including them for the purpose of diversity would have just made me angry.  It also gave the movie a truly early-twentieth-century feel to it, due in no small part to the overwhelmingly-white makeup of the cast.</p>

		<p> Oh, heavens to Murgatroyd, call out the P.C. Police! Start a congressional investigation! There are no blacks included in the Oscar nominations!</p>
<p> Hollywood&rsquo;s being totally out of touch with the concerns of most Americans is well illustrated by the above column. Looks like that post-racial millennium that Obamaism was going to usher in was just a chimera. Whenever the liberal bleeding hearts can find a situation they can torture into a case of &#8220;White racism,&#8221; they still jump on it with both feet.</p>
<p> And isn&rsquo;t it interesting how, despite such code words as &#8220;people of color,&#8221; &#8220;ethnic diversity,&#8221; and the like, it&rsquo;s painfully obvious that what the writer really means in each case is &#8220;black.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Well, now, ever since B.O. got elected, I&rsquo;ve noticed an approximate doubling of the number of blacks I see in commercials.  My 91 year old mother said, &#8220;I&rsquo;m damn sick of it!!&#8221;  Well, I stand with her.  And if there&rsquo;s no blacks tripping up the red carpet at the Oscars, so what?  They&rsquo;ve made more than their share in commercials; at least one of them is bound to win a Clio.</p>

<p>How utterly and abjectly laughable!</p>
<p>Hollywood, like every other socioeconomic and political institution in this country, is starting to figure out that diversity and multiculturalism has limits. Once anything becomes saturated with these two pernicious concepts and the realities that they harbor, the selling of them becomes most unprofitable. In a fantasy film world that is 75% white or greater, nonwhites can thrive by feeding off the larger entity and having their &ldquo;work&rdquo; being seen as &ldquo;unique&rdquo; and &ldquo;original.&rdquo; When they begin to become overextended into that world and start to saturate it beyond 25%, their poor: acting, directing, stories, and humor, simply become a mindless and degrading experience for mainstream audiences. </p>
<p>A good example is Eddie Murphy; when he burst onto the scene in the 80s, he was a fresh and unusual talent. This was despite his forced acting persona and even more contrived style of laughing. But he was what he was, a &ldquo;special talent.&rdquo; Now, his unusual anti-white bombasts and childish black oriented humor have been outpaced by the likes of Chris Rock and Jamie Foxx, just to name a few. Moreover, as the promised reality of multiculturalism seeps into everyday horrors, the Hollywood nonwhite archetypes do tend to fade into an almost morbidly surreal comedy of revolted angst.</p>
<p>Oh Eddie, how unfortunate for a &ldquo;king&rdquo; like you: </p>

<p>In short and put another way, it is odd that since Comrade BO has been elected there hasn&rsquo;t been a film with Morgan Freeman as the President of the USA and depicted as saving us all from asteroids or some other Armageddon with a deep impact!</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;ve got the white house. Isn&rsquo;t that enough?  Apparently not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simple: Blacks need us.  We don&rsquo;t need them.  If there were only a dozen black people living in the US, our culture would do just fine, &amp; probably be richer for their absence.  Do they sense that, deep down, I wonder? </p>

<p>How is it &#8220;circumstantial&#8221;? You mean to tell me that all the rich blacks in the entertainment industry can&rsquo;t pool their resources to create THEIR OWN studios with THEIR OWN studio executives! Don&rsquo;t they already have their own awards shows anyway - BET, NAACP awards and such? They have a Miss black America but at the same time want in on The Miss America Pageant. Same old story - what&rsquo;s theirs is theirs and what&rsquo;s YOURS is theirs also. </p>

		<p>I guess all the Oscars have been handed out for the movies where the black has three scenes, at the first of the movie where the black enters the tense mission scene to deliver a few lines about how important this mission is and he is counting on Harrison Ford or Tom Cruise, or Van Diesel to get the job done, then about mid movie the black&rsquo;s next scene of &#8220;Come on you people, get the job done.&#8221;, then the last scene where the black passes out the handshakes and job well done, and lets everyone know who is really in charge here. </p>

		<p>It says a lot about this country and how far it has sunk that  such a story would even make it in print. The PC fascists will look for a racial angle in everything and anything. I suppose there are some talented black actors, but in my opinion I find many (like Samuel Jackson and Morgan Freeman) play the same role over and over and are limited in range. </p>

&#8220;&hellip;Rebecca Yee, SAG national director and senior EEO counsel for affirmative action and diversity&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
The plum job of &#8220;national director for the Screen Actors Guild AND their senior Equal Employment Opportunities counsel for affirmative action and diversity&#8221;   &mdash;   now THERE&rsquo;S a position you just KNOW that SAG would&rsquo;ve preferred to fill with an Af-Am. But apparently there weren&rsquo;t any qualified Af-Am applicants, and the closest they could find was an oriental* female. </p>
<p>If a rich, powerful org like SAG can&rsquo;t find ONE talented black to hire, why would anybody expect the Academy to find a whole slew of Oscar-worthy blacks to give their trophies to, EVERY YEAR WITHOUT FAIL? </p>
<p>Some years there&rsquo;s a &#8220;quality&#8221; film (or maybe even two) made by blacks that might   &mdash;   MIGHT   &mdash;   be worthy of an Academy Award nomination. And some years there&rsquo;s not. If 2010 happens to be one of those &#8220;not&#8221; years, blacks will just have to deal with it. And vow to try to do better in 2011. </p>
<p>Maybe the question the Hollywood Reporter should have been asking here was not &#8220;Is lack of black Oscar winners due to the Academy&rsquo;s racism?&#8221; but rather &#8220;Why do blacks mostly make junk movies like escapist action flicks and vulgar comedies of the type that the Academy routinely ignores REGARDLESS OF RACE? Why would blacks EXPECT their cheap, trashy, low-brow entertainments to be rewarded with prestigious statuettes?&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
* Yes, I know you&rsquo;re not supposed to say &#8220;oriental&#8221; any more. That&rsquo;s why I said it. <br>

		<p>Have you guys noticed that every commercial on TV now features a black female with puffy nappy hair? It is true just watch any commercial segment while watching your favorite show and there&rsquo;s bound to be a commercial in which there is a black woman acting confident either eating yogurt, sporting some brand name clothes or selling insurance. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve just been arguing with my children and son in law over this sort of thing. The TV  was showing the original Karate Kid with Ralph  Machio, and I said what is the mattter with this version that they had to remake it for a black audience. Why do blacks need to suddenly afrocentrist everything before they feel can enjoy it. Recently in London they put on a Tennessee Ernie play with an all black cast, and of course the white liberal spreadsheet Guardian  gave it a five star rating. Even though its star performer, Adrian Lester, is probably the most over rated piece of wood going. At least in the states your blacks act well. Anyway the kids started giving out like I was complaining over nothing. Hard to make them understand, it&rsquo;s not going to stop at movies and television. Soon there will not be an art form left  that isnt  dumbed down by some race complaining white liberal or aggrieved black to suit an afrocentric perspective.  No other ethnic group in the world  whines like blacks about being left out of things. Hell, why cant they write and produce their own movies. Some of their  stars must be amongst the  richest performers in America. Will Smith, Denzil Washington, Don Cheadle, Morgan Freeman, Samuel Jackson, Jamie Fox&hellip;.  And you still have a few of the old  timers kicking around like  Sidney Potier and James Earl Jones. Just get on it  and leave us whites alone.   </p>

		<p>The movie industry sees one color- green.  Making a movie is an expensive and risky venture.  They make what they think will sell, or at least be received well.<br>
Perhaps they noticed that &#8220;people of color&#8221; have an effect on their bottom line.  The effect is very positive for goofy black comedies, so they make them, but these aren&rsquo;t the films that make the awards circuit.</p>
<p>Hollywood employs expensive market analysts.  Even a lower budget independent company does quite a bit of research and market testing.  It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me at all if in the last two years, test audiences have given the impression that they are tired of looking at blacks.  We certainly have been beaten over the head with them relentlessly, particularly in the last two years.  I could figure out that America is &#8220;blacked out&#8221; before even doing any testing.</p>
<p>People are just sick of looking at them and sick of hearing them speak.  Yet another charming trait of black people- they never have been able to gauge when they&rsquo;ve worn out their welcome.</p>

		<p>The black community is attracted to and spends its money on celluloid drivel.  Just look at Tyler Perry&rsquo;s movies involving cross-dressers in fat suits.  Any &#8220;serious&#8221; movie about race is viewed mostly by guilty white liberals.  But the guilty white liberal is becoming a smaller contingent of the overall white community, thankfully.  In fact, most Whites avoid going to the movies entirely because they are fed up with blacks and other minorities talking on their cell phones, to each other or at the screen through the whole movie.  Almost everything that comes out of Hollywood is low brow garbage aimed at the disposable spending of minorities, because that&rsquo;s who sees movies these days, having pushed away White moviegoers.  Occasionally, Hollywood will produce a movie of quality and substance that will entice whites back to the theaters and will be sufficiently engaging on an intellectual level as to be of no interest to blacks and other minorities.  Those are the few movies that are worthy of the best picture and acting nominations.  But this puts the Oscar folks in a bind: either maintain standards but end up rewarding those few high quality movies that are made by and for Whites, or lower the standards and start to reward the lower quality garbage aimed as the minority population.  I think we&rsquo;ll see the latter occur   &mdash;   especially as the Oscars now nominate 10 movies for Best Picture.</p>

&#8220;Have you guys noticed that every commercial on TV now features a black female with puffy nappy hair? It is true just watch any commercial segment while watching your favorite show and there&rsquo;s bound to be a commercial in which there is a black woman acting confident either eating yogurt, sporting some brand name clothes or selling insurance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Have you also noticed that in every commercial featuring Blacks and Whites, the White usually males are portrayed as nerdy, whimpy, incompetent; displaying bizzare behavior to the dismay of onlooking blacks.<br>
The Friendly&rsquo;s commercial is one of the most annoying. <br>
One of the most recent Progressive commercials shows a whimpy, middle aged &#8220;mama&rsquo;s boy&#8221; asking &#8220;What if Mother won&rsquo;t let me drive?&#8221;. The girl in white gives him a patronizing and condescending response while a Black woman looks at the man with an expression of total incredulity on her face. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time that we single out these obnoxious and degading commercials and innundate the networks and sponsors with emails. <br>
Maybe a Jesse Jackson style boycott would work.</p>

		<p>I once read that blacks make up 30% of the movie theater audience.  This, of course, with bad economic times, could have gone down to the 11% the article claims.<br>
Anyway, any time blacks make up a large percentage of a group, whites tend to start avoiding it because of the attendant noise and crime.  Moviemakers will thus be forced to make more black-friendly films, or they can make those usually repellent to blacks  &mdash;  such as period pieces about European nobility.  <br>
I once worked with a black guy who told me he would pay to see one feature and then sneak into others free.  Of course, the theaters make most of their money on concessions, and I would bet that blacks spend way too much money on food.  (But whether they just sneak in KFC in huge purses or buy popcorn, I have no idea.)  <br>
Apparently, more white-friendly films are being produced.  I pay little attention to first-run movies anymore, but I do watch  new British-made TV series like Inspector Lewis.  Like other British contributions such as Inspector Lindley, until the last season of Lewis, there were way too many non-Anglo characters and pro-gay situations.  One episode even dabbled with the possibility that one main character was gay, but then the writers settled for him merely going on a date with a male-to-female tranny.  In the latest episodes I&rsquo;ve seen, however, there&rsquo;s been no talk of gays and only a few minor non-Anglo roles.  My guess is that viewers complained about having multicult shoved down their throats  &mdash;  and there is a right-wing wave sweeping over Europe.</p>

<p>Usually, I&rsquo;m not a defender of RIAA/MPAA type groups, due to all their fanaticism and copywrong extremism, and their opposition to anything that resembles a new technology, file sharing being just the latest.  But, if I have my facts right, (I need help here, and I&rsquo;m not talking just in the general sense of the phrase), but the copyright holder of a movie that is released in theaters only gets a cut of the ticket price of the movie, not on any of the concessions.  AMAF, I think almost all of a movie theater&rsquo;s profit margins come from the concessions.  </p>
<p>Now, it may not actually be the case that the studio that made the movies that the individuals aformentioned are sneaking into after having paid to see another movie, because the person probably would have only ever paid to see that movie to begin with.  So if &#8220;Shaniqua&#8221; pays the $11 to see Movie A, then sneaks into Movie B then Movie C after A is done, the studio that made A gets money, but not the studio that made B or C.  However, Shaniqua might have never bought a ticket for B or C anyway.  And if her sneaking into see B or C compels her to buy or rent B or C on on DVD, then the studio gets a cut of that and they benefit in the long run.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to relate a true experience of mine. I have tried to reproduce the dialog as it was spoken and have made every attempt to present it judiciously while preserving the &#8220;flavor&#8221; if you will. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s virtually impossible to share a movie theater with Blacks. Years ago before I escaped Philly, one Saturday afternoon I went to see The Exorcist at what was then the Midtown theater on Chestnut Street. THere are now no movie theaters in Center City anymore. I went with my sister since my wife was pregnant at the time and a film about demonic posession was the last thing that she wanted to see. No sooner had the movie started when the Black &#8220;we need to be noticed&#8221; interaction began. Screams of &#8220;Oh My GOD&#8221;, &#8220;UUUUUHHHUUUH&#8221;, NUUUHUUUH&#8221;, periodically punctuated with &#8220;G-damm&#8221;, Mothuf  &mdash;  -ah&#8221; and of course &#8220;Sheeeeit&#8221; made it impossible to hear or concentrate. At one point a young White couple tried to sit down in the row behind us. A BLack guy and a woman were occupying the first two seats in the row. The Whites politely excused themselves and asked if they could get in. The Black &#8220;female&#8221; turned to the male and asked &#8220;You wanna git up Baby?&#8221; He responded, &#8221; If dey wants to sit down dey gone haff tuh clahm ovuh MAH a  &mdash;  .&#8221; The White couple,intimidated,thanked them ( I wanted to slap the couple just for that) and moved on.  </p>
<p>To digress for a moment, at the time I was a part time Grad. Student at Temple University and was just beginning the new semester. The day of registration in one of my classes, the professor was not there and in his stead had sent in his secretary who was a young Black woman with two inch eyelashes, at least five inch fingernails and a condescending attitude. SHe distributed the registration forms to the predominantly White class. There were periodic questions from the class and she handled them in the most obnoxious manner as she looked down her eyelashes at them but never making full eye contact. She was a poster child for Affirmative Action.</p>
<p>Anyway back to the movie. There was a large contingent of Blacks standing in the back of the theater ( there is an attraction to the rear of something) and the ushers were too intimidated to admonish them to sit. The volume was so low that coupled with the Black noise made dialog impossible to hear. As a nerdy White usher passed our seat my sister always outspoken, requested that the usher have the audio turned up, a request that I also supported. His response was &#8220;Listen you two, if you&rsquo;re going to cause a scene here we&rsquo;re going to have to ask you to leave.&#8221; Unbelievable!!! This was the 70s and the whites were already doing the armadillo routine. He got tough with US because he was confident that he wouldn&rsquo;t be assaulted and left for dead. Toward the blessed end of the film, from the Black contigent in the rear I heard this classic 5 million decible, ear drum shattering Afro female voice,&#8221;G  &mdash;  damm, AH am so muthaf  &mdash;  -in&rsquo; scayd ahm gawn sh-t mah paynts&#8221;. I turned around to see the source of the outburst and guess who it was? You guessed it, The professor&rsquo;s secretary.  The one who was acting as though she were so superior to the honkey students of the graduate class. You can&rsquo;t make this stuff up!!I considered this a message from the true God of White people. It had to be. What were the odds of being in the same theater with this sow the day after registration?<br>
On the way out of theater there was police barricades (it was a very popular film) to contain the people waiting in line for the next showing. The demographics were the same. As I passed the few White people they asked &#8220;How was it?&#8221; to which I discreetly replied &#8220;If you want to witness demonic posession forget the film and concentrate on the audience or leave now and wait for it to hit TV.&#8221;<br>
I made a vow that day that I would never again subject myself to another Black experience.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed the same thing and also noticed there seems to be a clear pecking order.</p>
<p>A White male will be the idiot or butt of the joke most of the time.</p>
<p>A White woman can only play this role if there are minorities in the commercial and no White male.  If it&rsquo;s an all-White cast only the male can be the idiot.</p>
<p>If there are no Whites then they throw in an Asian to make a fool of his/her self.  Hispanic used to be OK but since they&rsquo;re the new blacks it&rsquo;s all but over.</p>
<p>And of course any black has to be the wisest or the leader of the group.  NEVER will you see fun poked at blacks in TV advertising.</p>
<p>All this is out the window though if the White male is gay.  Then he moves to the top of the pecking order, because the gays are the darlings of the leftist establishment that controls most mass media.  This is the only possible scenario that could find a black in a goofy context.</p>
<p>Funny how it all mirrors the multiculturalist hierarchy perfectly.  </p>

		<p>Every day I wake up to the History Channel (the Hitler Channel). I agree that Hitler was bad, but I see Hitler every day, all day. He is long dead, so we can get on with things. I think we should enforce forms of affirmative action on liberal media. In doing this,   we can focus on horrors that are actually happening right now. Force liberal news to actually report hate crimes against whites. Imagine?  These crimes happen every few seconds, I&rsquo;m not sure how they could fit all that in one hour. They would need the guy from the 80&rsquo;s fedex commercial to announce the news.  Also, force this policy on  movie studios. They can only make 1% of their movies about Hilter, the rest have to be about  white genocides and Palestinian genocide that are currently happening. Imagine how bizarre that would be? To actually see the truth?</p>

<p>Apparently, when it comes to the films of 2010, there has been a tragic absence of roles featuring strong but kind, firm but flexible, serious but twinkle-in-the-eye, God-like but humble Presidents of the United States, bosses of all groups of white people, role-model mentors, take-your-troubles-to best friends, computer hacker geniuses, Sir Lancelot protectors of white leading ladies, and beloved partners that are unfailingly willing to suicidally &#8220;watch your back.&#8221; </p>

		<p>#24, yes, I&rsquo;ve noticed how Midsummer Murders has almost nil non-whites in all the many episodes I&rsquo;ve watched. (I think I saw one mixed-race face in an audience that was watching an outdoor rock concert). I&rsquo;ve even caught myself ignoring the story and trying to spot blacks instead.</p>
<p>It HAS to be deliberate - there&rsquo;s no way in this day and age it could be coincidental. The show is relatively light-hearted (despite there being a murder in every episode) and is basically an hour-long tourism commercial for the English countryside. My guess is that the producers have aimed it at the overseas expat audience in America, Australia, Canada etc who watch it on TV and buy it on DVD for that very reason.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a HUGE potential audience for people who simply want to be entertained without having &#8216;diversity&rsquo; and anti-white propaganda shoved down their throats.</p>

		<p>Interesting observations about blacks always being the hero and showing feckless whites how to do things in the moves and on the idiot box. Here was one surprising scene from an excellent film, The Deep Blue Sea, where Samuel L. Jackson pontificates to a group of whites about how to survive a disaster in an undersea laboratory. It has a rather interesting and humorous twist at the end, enjoy:</p>
