<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Seventy percent of students seeking degrees at California&rsquo;s community colleges did not manage to attain them or transfer to four-year universities within six years, according to a new study that suggests that many two-year colleges are failing to prepare the state&rsquo;s future workforce.</p>
<p>Conducted by the Institute for Higher Education Leadership &amp; Policy at Cal State Sacramento, the report, released Tuesday, found that most students who failed to obtain a degree or transfer in six years eventually dropped out; only 15% were still enrolled.</p>
<p>In addition, only about 40% of the 250,000 students the researchers tracked between 2003 and 2009 had earned at least 30 college credits, the minimum needed to provide an economic boost in jobs that require some college experience.</p>
<p>There were also significant disparities in the outcomes of black and Latino students. Only 26% of black students and 22% of Latino students had completed a degree or certificate or transferred after six years, compared to 37% of whites and 35% of Asian Pacific Islanders.</p>
<p>Latino students were half as likely as white students to transfer to a four-year university  &mdash;  14% versus 29%  &mdash;  and black students were more likely than others to transfer to private, for-profit institutions without obtaining the credits needed for admission to the University of California or Cal State.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Students face many barriers, including not being prepared for college-level study, as well as financial, work and family constraints. Black and Latino students, the study notes, are more likely to have attended segregated and overcrowded elementary and high schools and to have had less access to highly qualified teachers and counselors. {snip}</p>

		<p>The beat goes on&hellip; We are talking OPEN ADMISSIONS here, i.e. anybody  &mdash;  no matter how dumb or unqualified  &mdash;  can enroll. There&rsquo;s only so much room to place people in the UC or CSU systems, and not everybody is college material.</p>
<p>A few smart people of all races are late bloomers, or perhaps they figure  &mdash;  correctly  &mdash;  that they can save money as well as get a better education for the first two years in a community college. The focus there is on students and teaching. You don&rsquo;t find snooty research-focused professors who think teaching students is a waste of their time, and who fob off as many teaching duties as possible onto graduate assistants. You can actually learn a lot, from motivated instructors who genuinely want to help you, if you apply yourself there.</p>
<p>Face Realitysville, though: The majority of non-vocational students enrolled in community colleges regard the experience as an extension of high school, a place to goof around while delaying adulthood for as long as possible while, perhaps, finding a direction in life. Some people are smarter than others. The smarter ones are probably already in UC and CSU, and not coincidentally they are predominantly white and Asian rather than black and Latino.</p>

		<p>More incomplete journalism. How many blacks and hispanics drop out due to pregnancy? How many were over their heads academically? How many were lazy and never had any intention of finishing?  When I attended Community colleges the classes started out as &#8220;standing room only&#8221; and each week more and more were dropping out. Seemed like a lot of them would rather party and then when the grades were dropping they would drop the class to avoid bad marks.</p>
<p>And what is this nonsense about attending &#8220;segregated&#8221; schools? They are segregated by choice and design of the people who create the demographics of these communities.  No sane white or Asian person would live in these ghettos and barrios and even if they did they would be driven out by crime and reverse racism.</p>
<p>Same old propaganda, it&rsquo;s not their fault, they are perpetual victims of the &#8220;white&#8221; system and we will never be able to do enough for them.</p>

<p>Good observations in your post.</p>
<p>BUT</p>
<p>&#8220;Reverse Racism&#8221;</p>
<p>This phrase needs to be purged from your vocabulary.  The concept behind &#8220;reverse racism&#8221; and &#8220;reverse discrimination&#8221; is that the Evil White Man invented racism and discrimination and therefore these two things are his babies alone, and when practiced by &#8220;minorities&#8221; is simply something they picked up from the Evil White Society.</p>
<p>Call it what it is when you see it.  Using a qualifier like &#8220;reverse&#8221; lessens the very real bigotry of the so-called oppressed among us.</p>

		<p>Clearly a Jewish, Asian and white plot to ill-prepare the studious youth of La Raza and the West Coast of Africa when they are in high school. Despite their pleas for more challenging work, they are given ipods, pot and potato chips. How else do they have them in school?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Community Colleges Not Preparing California&rsquo;s Future Workforce.&#8221;</p>
<p>When has any college properly prepared any workforce involving AA gimme&rsquo;s?  </p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been graduating unqualified non-whites, especially blacks, for decades now, and it will be getting even worse if these health care mandates become law.</p>
<p>The degeneration is continuing on schedule, and it will get far worse.  There is no future for this country even if we were to miraculously escape break up and war.</p>
<p>THe empire hasn&rsquo;t struck back as the community organizer claims.  It is imploding, and he&rsquo;s helping it along nicely and right on schedule too. <br/>

		<p>It would be helpful were &#8220;investigative reports&#8221; such as this to address the primary reason many minority &#8220;students&#8221; drop out of post secondary schools. Many Government entities require attending such schools as a condition of receiving direct welfare payments and other taxpayer provided benefits. It shouldn&rsquo;t take a rocket scientist to figure out that these &#8220;scholars&#8221; will have a very high drop-out rate once the time allotted runs out. </p>

		<p>I am puzzled by what motivates this liberal obsession to force higher education on minorities. Are the liberals ignorant? </p>
<p>If they believe that college will benefit someone with an I.Q. less than 105, they are ignorant. Even if all races were equal in potential intelligence and the racial I.Q. disparities were due to Racism, the fact remains that I.Q. increase little in adults. These people need and, if they have any sense, want vocational training, not academic enrichment.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not liberal ignorance, perhaps it is a plot to increase the number of slots for college teaching and college administation. I give up, I cannot comprehend the liberal mind.</p>

		<p>There are virtually no colleges of any type anywhere in this country that are actually preparing any future workforce. They are, however, proudly producing a large number of lazy, liberalized, touchy-feely airheads with a &#8216;We Are The World&rsquo; attitude who will take a minimum of 20 years to realize they have been screwed.</p>

Most of the &#8220;special&#8221; people attending the community college I am attending get financial aid. A lot of them get money not only for tuition and books, but also for room and board. This is the main reason these &#8220;special&#8221; people are going to school.</p>
<p>Last week I overheard a &#8220;special-person&#8221; trying to convince the dean that he needed financial-aid money for an $800 laptop so he would not fail the class. He said he didn&rsquo;t have enough time to do his computer work in school, and needed the laptop so he could do it at home. 50% of the time, he didn&rsquo;t show up for class. The other 50% of the time he just hung around outside and talked to his friends on his cell phone. The school has 3 different computer labs and the library computer to do work. It&rsquo;s a 3 hour class and most people finish their assignment in 1 hour and leave. The semester is half over and this guy has not turned in 1 assignment. </p>
<p>These &#8220;special&#8221; people think that all they have to do is show up 1 or 2 days a semester and they will learn by osmosis. These are the same types of people that would steal shelves from a grocery store, put them in their home, then wonder why the food was not magically appearing on those shelves. </p>

		<p>So much to comment on&hellip;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just tackle this long and meaningless sentence:  </p>
<p>&#8220;Students face many barriers, including not being prepared for college-level study, as well as financial, work and family constraints. Black and Latino students, the study notes, are more likely to have attended segregated and overcrowded elementary and high schools and to have had less access to highly qualified teachers and counselors.&#8221; </p>
<p>1 - I think the biggie is not being able to do college level work.  Most blacks and latinos (and a fair share of whites) were not cut out for college.  Doing poster board projects with glitter, glue and printouts from the internet - IN GRADE 12 - just won&rsquo;t get you ready for 20 page papers.  Who designed that &#8216;project-based learning&rsquo; baloney?  Liberals did it to pretend-pass those who could barely read as teenagers, all in the name of social justice!</p>
<p>2 - Financial constraints are not an excuse.  There is a scholarship for everything, especially merely being non-white.  Family constraints?  Stop having babies at 15.  Oh, liberals say social justice demands we clean up other peoples&rsquo; messes!</p>
<p>3 - Black and latino students don&rsquo;t have access to quality teachers?  I got news for you folks.  Teachers are mostly the same everywhere.  What makes a school bad IS THE STUDENTS who, if they are gangbanging and disrupting all the time, will get no benefit from being there. It will also ruin it for any students who really want to learn.  Who keeps the gangbangers there?  Liberals do, in the name of social justice.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, soon they will dumb down the college curriculum, attack the instructors as &#8216;ineffective&rsquo;, break the professor&rsquo;s union and replace the geezers with Teach for America, dime-a-dozen teaching temps.  </p>
<p>Oh, and they will offer free childcare, counseling, medical care, etc, on campus for the helpless minorities who will be the majority on all our campuses in 20 years.  Gangbangers, mindless minions of ghetto rap and illiterate latinos from the highlands of wherever will all be made to feel &#8216;inclusive&rsquo; in the classes as hip hop culture and la raza studies will be incorporated into every subject from physics to psychology and everything in between.  </p>

		<p>The financial situation in California is partially responsible for the fact that it is taking a lot longer for students to graduate or transfer. Budget cuts have cut off sections of classes that are required courses for transfer to a UC or a CSU campus. Students often show up at so called full classes to see if someone will drop out and some professors will add students to the class roll even though the class is officially closed. As a result, students may have to attend community colleges for three years or more to get the classes they need to transfer.</p>

		<p>We might ask what jobs are in the future for Californians. The state&rsquo;s demographic has changed markedly over the last several decades. It&rsquo;s moving to extremes of high-tech and infotainment on one end, and unskilled labor and service on the other. </p>
<p>Behind this are the deliberate decisions of American elites to open the frontiers and outsource jobs. We might also note the general degeneration of infrastructure, which means less capability to support an industrial economy. </p>
<p>California is leading the USA in being turned into a third world country. So even if minorities graduate from college in large numbers, then what jobs can they apply for?  </p>
<p><i>Black and Latino students, the study notes, are more likely to have attended segregated and overcrowded elementary and high schools and to have had less access to highly qualified teachers and counselors. </i></p>
<p>Segregated schools? After over five decades of desegregation, civil rights, affirmative action, and minority studies programs? How can this be? </p>
<p>Is this report then stating that the liberal programs of the last two generations have been miserable failures? If so, then why do we allow liberals to run the show? Of course, liberals will not admit that they are responsible for their own disastrous policies. </p>

<p>Great Rant Comrade!</p>
<p>You write:</p>
<p><i>Oh, and they will offer free childcare, counseling, medical care, etc, on campus for the helpless minorities who will be the majority on all our campuses in 20 years.</i></p>
<p>These things are <i>already</i> available on &#8216;jr.&rsquo; college campuses (or is it campii?).  I had the displeasure of visiting one of these campuses in S. California last spring, on a school trip (for which a large bus was sent by the &#8216;college&rsquo;)  &mdash;  a campus which is majority &#8216;minority&rsquo;, as I&rsquo;m sure is the case of most, if not all community colleges in S. California. </p>
<p>I had to listen to the directors of said jr. college reel off the myriad services offered to Minority students (who make up the Majority in reality)  &mdash;  including various &#8216;outreaches&rsquo;, transportation vouchers, free 12-hour babysitting, full tuition including books, a medical clinic, a beautiful, new, state-of-the art gym, a beautiful, new, retrofitted swimming pool, on-site psychological counseling and social services, on-site tutoring services, and, an entire plethora of race-based grievance organizations students could join.  </p>
<p>&#8216;Minority&rsquo; students receive &#8216;scholarships&rsquo; to attend CCs   &mdash;  no-questions asked   &mdash;   scholarships where checks are freely handed out and there is no follow up as to how the money is spent.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how it works in other states, but in California young adults may attend Community Colleges without having finished high school, without having received a high school diploma, without having passed the high school exit exam.</p>
<p>In this upside down, PC world, where the prevailing wisdom states that ALL non-Whites MUST attend college, extremely incompetent students, those who are at the very bottom of their class with 2nd or 3rd grade reading writing and computing skills are often referred by high schools straight to CCs. </p>
<p>So when I read, <i>Seventy percent of students seeking degrees at California&rsquo;s community colleges did not manage to attain them.</i>, the only thing that surprised me was 70% figure.  From the students I&rsquo;ve seen go on to CCs, I would have guessed more like 90% never attain degrees. </p>
<p>But of course, to Carla Rivera and the LA Times, the huge &#8216;minority&rsquo; failure rate  is the fault of the Community Colleges, never the fault of the unprepared, low IQd, disinterested students.</p>

		<p>I attended a community college in California for my first two years of undergraduate study, and it changed my life.  Thanks to my old baby-boomer philosophy professor, I first became a believer in race-realism, and then a little later, in outright white nationalism.  My old professor was a specialist in ancient Greek thought, and it was from him that I learned of the role of white people and white ideas in world history. Last I knew, my old prof is still teaching.  If you carefully select your classes and professors, community college is more than a great financial bargain.  You can learn what even so-called elite institutions won&rsquo;t dare teach you.</p>

		<p>When I immediately read the title for this article I KNEW what it would be about and generally what the statistics would show. </p>
<p>It states that &#8220;minority&#8221; failure is due to lesser-quality teachers in Black and Mestizo areas. - NEWS FLASH: Teachers are basically the same in every school. In all schools there are different teachers with different teaching styles. Of course, certain teachers work better for certain individuals. </p>
<p>I guess the liberals think that there is an evil conspiracy that unqualified teachers are sent to predominately Black or Mestizo schools to &#8220;dumb them down&#8221;.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, college would be beneficial to everyone. However, there are some people who don&rsquo;t have the capacity to handle college. Whether it be there IQ, or upbringing.</p>
<p>Since there is a marked IQ potential among racial groups it makes since why there is marked differences in educational persistence. Although, in all racial groups even with normal IQ+ people, there are some people who just don&rsquo;t feel the need to go to college.</p>
<p>I do think it&rsquo;s liberal arrogance to PUSH Blacks and Latinos to go to CC via race-based funding, minority perks on campus. </p>
<p>Even though I&rsquo;m just 22, I am aware that in the last half-century or so, California&rsquo;s demographics have gone through a rapid change - especially in the last couple decades. In a lot of people&rsquo;s minds (but of course not spoken) the most pressing issue in California in the next decade or so, is the shrinking percentage of white-collar, educated people to do careers. And the growing percentage of blue-collar, unskilled, service people.<br/>
Of course, we NEED both, but the shrinking career-population of California will NOT BE GOOD for the entirety of California&rsquo;s population.</p>
