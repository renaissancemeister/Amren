<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In papers filed in Manhattan Supreme Court, African-Americans Christopher White, Abdul Rasuul and Leroy Johnson say they were told they had to buy food if they wanted to use the restroom at the 480 Third Ave. outlet [of McDonald&rsquo;s], while a nonpaying white woman didn&rsquo;t have to buy anything.</p>
<p>They say they suffered &#8220;shock, pain, emotional, psychiatric, psychological and mental injuries&#8221; as a result of the incident last year.</p>

		<p>I have walked into various McDonalds while traveling.  I have walked right in and directly into the rest room without stopping to buy anything and have never been questioned.  How does the McDonalds staff know whether or not you are going to the rest room first to wash your hands or spend a penny before placing your order?  And once you have used the rest room how can they make you buy somehting?  This sounds totaly bogus but if true the employees/management of the location in question were probably Hindus, Pakastanis or Arabs.</p>
<p>By the way I always buy at least a drink after using the washroom.  Although whether I do it out of white guilt or a sense of fairness I really can not say.</p>

		<p>Most restaurants and other businesses that provide public restrooms usually require a person to make some sort of purchase to use the bathroom. Quite possibly the White woman the men saw had already eaten her food and used the restroom before leaving and they did not see her buy anything. If they really were denied a restroom usage AFTER making a purchase then they would have a complaint. </p>

		<p>In their defense, Messrs. White, Rasuul and Johnson could say, (and with a straight face), that they&rsquo;ve provided that particular McDs, and McDs in general, with a lot of business over the years.  Blacks seem to love McDs for some reason   &mdash;   I&rsquo;ve actually known a few that do McDonalds as their Thanksgiving tradition.</p>
<p>When McDs started their &#8220;I&rsquo;m Lovin&rsquo; It&#8221; ad campaign, aimed at the ghetto crowd, BTW, one of their very first ads with such a tag line featured a young black man singing, &#8220;I&rsquo;m lovin&rsquo; it, it&rsquo;s the real McCoy, it&rsquo;s the taste I was raised on from a little boy.&#8221;  (He must have forgotten that there are no black &#8220;boys.&#8221;  Too derogatory.  But I digress.)  </p>
<p>Funny, I kinda enjoy McD&rsquo;s fries, but McDs don&rsquo;t comprise my fondest childhood memories, culinary or otherwise.  My mother&rsquo;s stuffed peppers and pork chops rank WAY higher.</p>

		<p>This sounds like a gimmick.  The blacks in question are probably the &#8220;whitey owes me&#8221; type of black people.  For some reason people assume all blacks are like this and its people like these who give the entire race a negative image among white people.  My guess is this: they walked into McDonalds, tried to use the bathroom, were told they would have to purchase something, got mad, left, and made up some ruse about a white woman being allowed to use the restroom without purchasing food.  If a white woman DID use the bathroom without being stopped, I&rsquo;m sure she either a.) did buy food first, but the black customers came after she had purchased her food, or b.) the employees simply didn&rsquo;t notice her.  99.9% chance racism has nothing to do with it.  I mean, can you imagine any fast food employee denying black people the right to use a bathroom, just because he/she is &#8220;racist&#8221;?  Come on, their too busy taking food orders to make discriminatory decisions regarding the restroom facilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;They say they suffered &ldquo;shock, pain, emotional, psychiatric, psychological and mental injuries&rdquo; as a result of the incident last year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Okay, and even if racism WAS a factor in all this, three black guys (one a Muslim) claiming they received &#8220;shock, pain, emotional, psychiatric, psychological, and mental injuries&#8221; is just plain laughable.  I bet they don&rsquo;t know what half those words mean.  Hell, they probably can&rsquo;t pronounce them.  If they were so deeply offended by being denied access to a vathroom, then their psychological problems go much deeper tahn this incident.</p>

		<p> Sounds to me like a ginned-up attempt to get into some deep pockets by three deadbeat welfare cases. Either there is precious little evidence proving any of this, or the Post didn&rsquo;t bother to quote enough of the meat of the lawsuit for one to draw a conclusion.</p>
<p> Regardless, it was so typical of such &#8220;We been discriminated against&#8221; lawsuits filed by blacks over the years that one suspects a &#8220;copy-cat&#8221; aspect to this action.</p>

		<p>.. or, you know, it could truly be that the &#8216;nice, white&rsquo; woman who was &#8216;like me&rsquo; (the manager) was allowed to use it and, a bunch of less-nice seeming black and colored people weren&rsquo;t. And the manager felt kind of protective of the bathroom, and didn&rsquo;t identify with the people-of-color. I wonder if there&rsquo;s actually any law around it - is providing free bathroom service part of &#8216;public accommodation&rsquo; or is it at the discretion of the manager? Regardless, you know McD&rsquo;s policy will become to allow /everyone/ to use it (or none), without paying, for fear of &#8216;suits and the bad PR. </p>

		<p>Many  fast-food establishments will require a customer to purchase food or beverage to offset the price of repairing the toilets after the junkies have flushed their works down the john.<br>
Plus, they must use a key to get in.</p>
<p>For several years, I worked as a cashier at a gas station. We always gave our customers free use of the toilets. Then the community began to change. We had to charge twenty-five cents for customers to use it, because their works and condoms would stop up the toilets.<br>

_____ </p>
<p>I have too.  But in some cases, they give you a token to unlock the bathroom door  &mdash;   a token which you must get at the counter from the clerk. This is somewhat rare, but I think it would apply in cases like Midtown Manhattan where real estate is extremely pricey and they are not in the business of running a public bathroom for the general public.</p>
<p>Some McD&rsquo;s in Manhattan don&rsquo;t have any bathroom at all, and that will be the result if this lawsuit succeeds. It will be easier (and cheaper) just to close them all and avoid the trouble.  Most restaurants, bars, and  hotels have a sign plainly stating that their restrooms are for patrons only. McD&rsquo;s has had a generous policy about this, but that generous policy may have to end. A shame!</p>

		<p>Growing up I had to put up with that as well.  As a white teenager, I remember one day walking into a Burger King, needing the toilet desperately, and being yelled at that the facilities were only for paying customers.</p>
<p>I quickly order a sandwich to go, pay, and dash into the restroom&hellip; to urinate into a urinal with the paper bag in my teeth, hey, I needed my hands free.  The manager (who was probably gay) actually followed me in.  I yelled back at him, DO YOU MIND, I&rsquo;M BUSY!</p>

		<p>In San Freak Sicko some years ago, some asian man wouldn&rsquo;t stop banging on the bathroom door of a Burger King (where I was on the stool.) The door was locked, and I shouted several times;&#8221; There&rsquo;s someone in here; I&rsquo;ll be out in a minute.&#8221;<br>
The Asian idiot kept pounding on the door, like he would break it down.<br>
A minute later, he returned with another non english speaking Latino, who&hellip;can you believe it? OPENED THE BATHROOM DOOR WITH A KEY, even though I was shouting loudly at that time:The restroom (a one person restroom) is occupied! Don&rsquo;t come in!&#8221;</p>
<p>So there I am, pants down, some raving Asian and a clueless, uncaring south American standing there, looking at me, with the door open to the restaraunt behind them. <br>
I yelled GET THE **** OUT!<br>
They did not. Latino illegal simply walked away, and Chinese Illegal just stayed. <br>
I went to an employee and demanded the manager&hellip;the central American girl did not speak a word of English.<br>
I tried again and again to get ANYONE in that joint to produce a manager. No one would speak to me. <br>
I grabbed (an Asian) cop outside. He blew it off.<br>
Screw that city!<br>
Where&rsquo;s MY million dollars?</p>

		<p>Who says this so-called &#8220;white woman&#8221; even exists?  Other than themselves and their hired lawyer?  But if she does, there are certain gender realities that make it more urgent for females to have immediate access to a restroom.  That all three of these guys had an immediate and dire need for a restroom at the exact same moment is suspicious at best (unless they DID, in fact, eat from McDonald&rsquo;s menu).  Still, most McDonald&rsquo;s restaurants would not have been able to accommodate three people simultaneously in their time of instant need.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir, you will have to buy something to use the restroom&#8221;</p>

		<p>McDonald&rsquo;s is stalked by one attorney that checks out EVERY new restaurant just to measure all the wheel chair acceptable doorways and facilities, he makes his living by finding any tiny irregularity and sueing.  They supposedly have a standard policy of settling most lawsuits that have a prayer of going to court with a flat fee.</p>

		<p>My guess is that these three characters were hanging around in the parking lot making drug deals, trying to pick up white women, etc. on a regular basis and were using the McD restroom to smoke pot or just as their own regular toilet.  Why were they noticing white WOMEN as opposed to white MEN using the restroom?  <br>
I&rsquo;ve stopped while traveling and used McD&rsquo;s restrooms and bought nothing.  They&rsquo;re always situated just inside the outer doors, where a patron doesn&rsquo;t even have to enter the dining area.  For the staff to notice the three complaining men, the latter were doing something to make themselves noticed.  </p>

		<p>This shows the basic difference in the mentality of the two groups we are dealing with.</p>
<p>For most of us buying a drink or food at McD is simply part of the &#8220;toilet stop&#8221;</p>
<p>For certain ethnic minorities it is part of the culture of getting everything for nothing.</p>
<p>AND, Insults, rejections etc are part of life and as much as we hate this sort of thing it is part of our eventual personal development, hopefully for the better.</p>

		<p>Da, da, da, dat, da&hellip;I&rsquo;m lovin&rsquo; it. Just the same, any reasonable person would head for the Restroom first, to wash their hands, prior to eating. It wouldn&rsquo;t be wise to order your food, and leave it unattended, while you went to the Restroom after your purchase. </p>
<p>Also, any place that is open to the Public, means that its Restrooms are open to the public, as well, whether you are buying something or not. </p>
<p>Normally, I never saw Restroom use as a priority with Blacks, as they will, from personal eyewitness experience, go anywhere the mood strikes them.</p>
<p>McDonald&rsquo;s should just give them a Happy Meal to go away. </p>

		<p>When ever I say a &#8220;Restroom Out of Order&#8221; sign I go in and close the door behind me. When The Iranian clerk starts yelling out me that I`m not allowed, I tell him I`m a plumber and fixing his toilet for free. Then I flush, walk out and tell him &#8221; Fixed! No Charge!&#8221; <br>
Also, don`t even get me started on other &#8220;Pit stop&#8221; stratagies. I had commented on the article detailing the rise of roadside urine bombs that it is due mostly to clerks who sidestep the customers and law by keeping bathrooms inaccessable, and therefore clean&hellip;</p>

		<p>This sounds like one of those shakedown schemes promoted by  behind-the-scene parasitic lawyers. I&rsquo;m not convinced these lovable people of color are creative enough to think up something like this all by themselves. Then again, we white folks often sell the minority ghetto types short when we seriously underestimate their ability to shake us down for mega bucks. Sooner or later, McDs and other such fawning,spineless enterprises will pay a dear price for seeking and embracing such worthless customers.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m delighted that two Africans are going after McDonald&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Night after night, the television blares McDonald&rsquo;s ads which SUCCINCTLY encourage Africans to trade at their stores.</p>
<p>Their product is nothing to brag about to start with, but when I notice that they don&rsquo;t market their trade toward me, I stay away.</p>
<p>Let all the other Africans who buy fast food at McDonald&rsquo;s help to pay the costs of placating these two horribly aggrieved people.</p>

		<p>Some of the McDonald&rsquo;s/Burger Kings I&rsquo;ve seen have had security guards because the local drug dealers turn the restaurant into a hangout and the bathrooms into an impromptu office.  This sounds similar to the signs, also in some McDonald&rsquo;s, that say that the maximum seating time is twenty minutes.  I&rsquo;ve also never seen these signs enforced, as they are merely there to give the staff a basis upon which to throw out undesirables. Other places, stores just permanently keep an &#8220;out of order&#8221; sign on the bathrooom for the same reason.  If  you ask, they&rsquo;ll often tell you to go right in and you&rsquo;ll find that nothing is wrong with the bathroom.</p>

		<p>I have to respectfully disagree with tryclosan saying that they will let you breeze past their &#8220;Out of Order&#8221; sign, if only you ask. I come up against juggle heads every day who can`t or don`t care about the difference between a business man in his fifties, or a thug in his teens. I refuse to ask a third worlder for permission to use his restroom, which is why I don`t. Better to ask forgiveness than permission. Come to think of it why would I ask or buy anything after I`ve run the bathroom blockade&hellip;Put the burden of confrontation on them, not yourself!</p>

		<p>I will admit I&rsquo;m totally jaded by today&rsquo;s world&hellip;very little shocks or surprises me. But I am totally flabbergasted every time I go by a McDonald&rsquo;s and see the parking lot full and the drive-thru window backed up all the way around the parking lot. And by whites! Do this many people have small children that they are buying &#8216;happy meals&rsquo; for, because I can&rsquo;t imagine that white adults voluntarily eat that swill.</p>

		<p>Some Micky D&rsquo;s have the door locked to keep drug addicts from getting high in there and bums sleeping in there. They probably had to ask for the key, if they have a sign posted must buy food they&rsquo;re in the clear, maybe the woman was a regular customer.</p>

		<p>&#8220;They say they suffered &ldquo;shock, pain, emotional, psychiatric, psychological and mental injuries&rdquo; as a result of the incident last year.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true you know. I&rsquo;ve read about a black fella that has many times suffered from &#8220;shock, pain, emotional, psychiatric, psychological and mental injuries&rdquo; as a result of trauma. He often has fits in restaurants and shakes covulsively on the floor. His name&rsquo;s just coming back to me &hellip; I think it&rsquo;s the &hellip; Rev Al Sharpton, and yes he&rsquo;s a holy man &amp; preacher.  </p>
