<h1><a href="http://www.chicagobreakingnews.com/2010/10/nu-students-told-not-to-wear-offensive-halloween-costumes.html">NU to Students: No Offensive Halloween Costumes</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stacy St. Clair, WGN-TV (Chicago), October 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Despite their lofty SAT scores and sterling academic credentials, some Northwestern University students apparently need remedial instruction when it comes to selecting appropriate Halloween costumes.</p>
<p>In an e-mail sent to the campus late Monday, Dean of Students Burgwell Howard warned against wearing racially or culturally insensitive costumes this weekend. He also discouraged &#8220;ghetto,&#8221; &#8220;pimps and hos&#8221; and &#8220;gangsta&#8221; parties at the esteemed Evanston university.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The directive follows a 2009 incident in which two students attended a Halloween party in black face and pictures of their costumes appeared on Facebook. The photos sparked outrage at the university and prompted a public forum to discuss racism on the predominately white campus.</p>
<p>In a similar 2007 episode, two Ph. D. students posted pictures of themselves in blackface around Halloween.</p>
<p>&#8220;In many cases the student wearing the costume has not intended to offend, but their actions or lack of forethought have sent a far greater message than any apology could after the fact,&#8221; Howard wrote.</p>
<p>And lest there be any confusion, Howard provided students with a list of questions to ask before selecting one&rsquo;s Halloween attire: Is the costume based on making fun of real people or cultures? Does the costume promote cultural myths? Could someone take offense to it?</p>
<p>Students who answered &#8220;yes&#8221; to any of these questions were urged to rethink their choices.</p>

		<p>I just returned from a Bronx store where Halloween costumes were being sold. They had &#8220;pimp&#8221; and &#8220;hoe&#8221; outfits along with sections devoted to Asian and Mexican costumes (the latter included a sombrero, pancho and a bushy &#8220;Pancho Villa&#8221; mustache).</p>
<p>Though 95% of the customers were black and hispanic they had no complaints and if anything commented on how funny the outfits were. I guess minorities have better senses of humor than bedwetting white liberals.</p>

		<p>This is a &#8220;chilling effect&#8221; on First Amendment rights.  Where is the ACLU?  <br>
Let me get this right.  Are burkas prohibited for all but the Muslim women?  Are Pope costumes prohibited?  Are Dracula vampire costumes offensive to Romanians?  Are American Indian costumes offensive?  Are witch costumes offensive to my ex-wife or by extension me? (-:  <br>
Its ok for a real thug to be a real gansta, but not ok to mimic a gansta for fear of offending the thugs?<br>
Its Halloween, get over it.  And satire is a great and healthy American tradition.  And did I mention the freedom of expression and the First Amendment?</p>

		<p>And yet every black comedian on TV has speaking in the voice of a white figure an important part of their routine and Northwestern itself sponsers endless minority race promotion groups on campus, for non-whites and non-whites only, most of them straight out anti-white as they champion &#8216;diversity&rsquo;. </p>

		<p>I am dressing up in black and white stripes this year, as a prison inmate  &mdash;  complete with a ball and chain, prison #, handcuffs and leg irons.</p>
<p>Although blacks make up approximately 12-13%  of the US population, 55% of the prison population is black, according to the Urban League (due to a Racist, White Judicial System, they claim).</p>
<p>According to the article, we Whites must be &#8216;sensitive&rsquo; and ask ourselves the following questions viz. Halloween costumes:</p>
<p>Is it culturally or racially insensitive to blacks for a White to dress as a member of the prison population?  (possibly yes)</p>
<p>Is the costume based on making fun of real black people or black culture? (yes)</p>
<p> Does the costume promote black cultural myths? (conventional/media wisdom or reality?)</p>
<p>Uh&hellip; maybe I should get out my Viking, Hippie or Cavewoman costumes and review the questions again&hellip;</p>
<p>I need my job and pension.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Does the costume promote cultural myths?&#8221;</p>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t mythological carictures! This is the black reality -a trip to any urban wasteland will open your eyes!(or just watch the evening news if you live anywhere near one) In urban America, blacks on the whole are a living stereotype.   <br>

		<p>All these white skeletons are offensive and racist so must be illegal! Where are all the others? Why do Haitian voodoo africans paint their faces white? It must be to frighten one-another as no white would be scared of such an &#8216;apparition&rsquo;. I, for one, am not offended by this as it&rsquo;s obvious that a black african has &#8216;whited-up&rsquo; and it looks so ridiculous that it&rsquo;s actually funny. &#8220;Does the costume promote cultural myths?&#8221; What a stupid question. Halloween IS a cultural myth and simply announces that All Saints day will follow after midnight. Of course, one could always sit on a grave during the hours of darkness and wait to be grabbed by a muddy rotting hand emerging from the depths! If this has actually happened to you, please let us all know how you escaped the slimy clutches!</p>

		<p>My question is the same as when I am discussing with a liberal looney tune the Ten Commandments in a courthouse: Are you seriously afraid that a plaque of the Ten Commandments will turn you into a flaming Christian zealot just by walking past it? Does it have that much power? Same to be said for costumes. As I&rsquo;ve said before, this is the most thin-skinned country in existence. I swear that much of the population walks around every day looking for opportunities to be &#8216;offended&rsquo;. Geeze, someone needs to slip some laughing gas in the offices of the ACLU and every EEOC controlled institution.</p>
