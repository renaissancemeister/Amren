<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Hampden Township couple was attacked early Saturday in the River Street Garage in Harrisburg.</p>
<p>The 19-year-old Hampden Township woman thought nothing of the three men standing outside a parked car as she drove her friends out of the River Street Garage in downtown Harrisburg early Saturday.</p>
<p>But suddenly the car jerked backward, trapping her on the second floor. The men dragged her husband and a friend from the car and began pummeling them, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I jumped out and tried to stop it, thinking, &#8216;I&rsquo;m a girl, they&rsquo;re not going to hit me,&rsquo;&#8221; said the woman, who fears retaliation and didn&rsquo;t want her name used. &#8220;Then a fist came at me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next thing the petite, 5-foot 3-inch brunette remembers is waking up face down on the cement, with blood dripping from her eye. She&rsquo;d find out later she had a concussion and broken nose.</p>
<p>Harrisburg police told the woman she might have been the victim of a gang-initiation ritual, since she and her friends were randomly jumped by the group, and nothing  &mdash;  not even their wallets in plain sight inside her car  &mdash;  were taken.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the second violent act in the past two months at the garage, located off Second Street. On Sept. 3, a 30-year-old woman was mugged and choked until she was unconscious.</p>
<p>And in January at the South Street Garage, a woman and her male friend were severely beaten and mugged as they were leaving on an early Saturday. The woman&rsquo;s friend had a broken nose and needed 20 stitches to close a large gash between his eyes and one across his forehead.</p>
<p>In the most recent beating, the woman and her 21-year-old husband, newlyweds with a 6-month-old daughter, counted at least a dozen teens and young men who viciously jumped them and their two friends as they were leaving after a night on Restaurant Row.</p>

						<p>
							<i>Kourtney Geers, Patriot-News (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania), October 14, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Harrisburg police say they are looking for information about an attack that occurred at the River Street Garage in downtown Harrisburg early Saturday.</p>
<p>Police say that a 19-year-old woman called Harrisburg Police the morning of Oct. 9 to report that she and her 21-year-old husband, both of Mechanicsburg, were beaten and robbed the night before in the parking garage when they went back to their car at about 1:30 a.m.</p>
<p>Police say the woman told them that as they were driving out they stopped on the third floor to let a car back out of a space and were confronted by about 10 young black males and attacked for no reason. {snip} The woman&rsquo;s husband lost his wedding ring in the attack.</p>

		<p>&#8216;I never thought I&rsquo;d be a victim,&rsquo; Hampden Township woman says of attack in Harrisburg parking garage</p>
<p>This response is not unusual. Its likely most victims of this kind of violence never thought they would be victims. If the &#8220;mainstream&#8221; &#8220;news&#8221; media were doing its job by alerting the public to the danger, though, few victims would be surprised.</p>

		<p>When I think of Penna I think of the land of my German immigrant forbears.  I think of Gettysburg or coal miners.</p>
<p>It sickens my mind to think that now it is all becoming a voodoo ghetto.  I just cannot wrap my mind around it.  Liberal whites in Penna pat themselves on the back as they bring in more &#8216;diversity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They never consider that the many all-black (and latino) areas around the country used to be white, and that those whites who used to live there welcomed &#8216;diversity&rsquo; also.  Where are the whites now?  It seems &#8216;diversity&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t include them.</p>
<p>It grows and spreads and the children and grandchildren of white liberals will curse their memory as they are being beaten and robbed daily in their ghetto towns that used to be so safe and orderly before.</p>

<p>And of course, all of of those kindly, chivalrous, brave blacks she sees on TeeVee and the movies are the reason she believed this nonsense.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this really <i>is</i> what it takes to wake White people up to reality&hellip;</p>
<p>Second thought, I&rsquo;m not so sure.  Let&rsquo;s see if this woman is ostentatiously &#8220;forgiving&#8221; her attackers a week from now.  After all, it&rsquo;s better to be beaten to the dirt than to be a Racist, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

Harrisburg is a potentially dangerous area even for folks who are just traveling through.<br>
Most people may not realize they are in danger because the city is mostly silent during the day.<br>
Black and Puerto Rican hoodlums and gangmembers will sniff out an area for selection before loitering in that area and single out or size someone up for robbery or assault.<br>
Many of the hoodlums in Harrisburg are carpetbaggers from Bronx New York and are irritated by their inability to form a strong ethnic enclave and satisfactorily sponge the welfare system.<br>
The local train station is used to place convicted criminals to work sometimes before they are paroled placing people waiting for their trains in a state of alertness and fear when going to the restrooms.<br>
Employees working for local utility companies in Harrisburg are a mixed lot of Secular Humanists, Socialists, and Marxists, <br>
9-5 er&rsquo;s.<br>
It has been said that these employees are known for defrauding their companies and the public.</p>

		<p>I hope that this young couple has learned their lesson. First of all- avoid parking garages, especially at night- at all costs. Second- if you see a large group of blacks (more than two) avoid them even if you have to request a security escort. Third, if you can possibly do so get some sort of weapon- even if it is just pepper spray it will get you enough time to get away from the group of miscreants. Fourth- STAY OUT of black or other minority dominated neighborhoods, one breakdown or possibly even traffic light stop could mean an attack. This poor young lady was about as naive as they come- thinking she was immune to attack. </p>

		<p>On this subject, I&rsquo;m sure most of you have noticed that there has been a big spate of &#8220;anti-gay&#8221; hate crimes in and around New York City recently.  Virtually all of the perpetrators have been either black Americans or black (-ish) Hispanics.  I&rsquo;m starting to wonder if the media and law enforcement aren&rsquo;t trying to pull one over on us, making these hate crimes to to be anti-gay, when they are really anti-white.</p>
<p>Sure, there is probably plentiful proof that the perps used anti-gay invective, but I get the feeling that orientation wasn&rsquo;t really the motivation for the bias-motivated attacks as much as race.  Of course, I&rsquo;m going out on a limb and thinking most of the victims are white.</p>

		<p>Gee, another &#8220;random&#8221; attack; nothing racial, just garden variety crime, that&rsquo;s all. Be careful being out in public while white lest some one of these &#8220;random&#8221; events just drop out of the sky and strike you. What it all really is is a nationwide campaign of low intensity warfare that&rsquo;s been conducted over a period of very many years. Although seemingly carried out on an ad hoc basis by groups of individuals a pattern emerges; just connect the dots. There&rsquo;s a method behind the &#8220;randomness&#8221;. </p>

		<p>How could this possibly happen? On tv all the criminals are white. Blacks are always nice and respectful and only downtrodden because of racism. No black would ever attack a decent white person&hellip;.</p>
<p>they seem like the nicest people on TV. All those tv shows where rich white kids date and marry blacks - kardashians, kendra, etc</p>
<p>how can blacks possibly hit a woman?</p>

		<p>There is a site called city-data.com. There you will find the racial, religious and other info on the population of just about any city or town in the USA. Amazing. Gives all sorts of in-depth data on what is available in town regarding religion, income, crime rate, etc. Also,very important,there is a discussion forum that goes into depth about an area. Of particular interest is the info and discussion forums for Harrisburg.The discussion went into racial changes in that area by page 2. This provides far more info on the changes happening to whites in this lovely area than could ever be said here, and it is being said by folks who live there. What a shame. Is there any hope for the white race? The links to the discussion forums are toward the bottom right at the end of the page for the city in question. <br>
I don&rsquo;t represent the site,but felt it should be mentioned here for the very important info it provides us. I found it through a search when I wanted definate, accurate demographic information on a city I was considering moving to. When I saw the percentage of non-white, esp. blacks, I didn&rsquo;t even bother to search on-line for housing in that particular city at all. I found another with a very slim population of non-whites. </p>

<p>Back in the early &rsquo;60s some Brooklyn neighborhoods, like mine,  which now are considered war zones were actually quite nice, even for lower income areas. By the mid &rsquo;70s pretty much everyone I knew either had been assaulted, burglarized, car stolen or any other numerous run-ins with blacks or hispanics or knew someone who had. What an education we got and that&rsquo;s when the white-flight began  (Queens looked pretty good to my dad). Now it&rsquo;s reaching people that don&rsquo;t have a clue about this reality and they are predictably shocked. Let&rsquo;s hope they go from the shock to the wising-up as fast as possible.</p>

		<p>If one is in or near a black neighborhood one should avoid young black men, especially groups of young black men, and especially after dark.  Avoid deserted areas.  Carry a legal weapon, like pepper spray, a stun gun, or a concealed hand gun, if you can get a permit.  <br>
 <br>
The first time you are attacked, you will think, &#8220;This can&rsquo;t really be happening.&#8221;  After the second time, you will think, &#8220;It may happen at any time.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>One night at about 2:00 AM in the morning I couldn&rsquo;t sleep so I&rsquo;m up with the light on in my office and there is a knock at the door. I pick up a small pistol and go to see who is at the door and it&rsquo;s two policemen. I asked them to excuse me a minute and I go to lay the gun back on a table in the living room.</p>
<p>One of the cops ask if I always answer the door with a gun and I told them that when it&rsquo;s two in the morning and I have no idea just who is at the door it seems like a good idea. </p>
<p>The problem in America is that we have no protection. The government doesn&rsquo;t want you to protect yourself and they sure as heck can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t do it. </p>
<p>If you just look at the number of crimes committed against persons we are in more danger today than our ancestors were and yet people feel it&rsquo;s safe to go around unarmed. </p>
<p>A gun may not have saved my ancestors from an Indian attack but they would never have thought of leaving the house without it. </p>

According to FBI, Uniform Crime Reports, the crime rate in New York city peaked in 1980 at 6,911.6 offenses per 100,000 inhabitants.  Now it is 2,320.7.  That is lower than in 1965 when it was 3,065.6.<br>
<a href="https://www.disastercenter.com/crime/nycrime.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.disastercenter.com/crime/nycrime.htm</a><br>
 <br>
Crime is still a serious problem, and it is certainly true that when blacks move into a neighborhood the crime rate goes up, but let&rsquo;s not exaggerate things.     </p>

 <br>
Most white liberals, like the kind who produce television programs, come in contact with few blacks.  They few they know personally are usually exceptional, or they are in subordinate positions they occupy without resentment.  <br>
 <br>
Consequently, it is easy for white liberals to believe that most blacks in prison are there for &#8220;non violent drug offenses,&#8221; that the real problem is not crime in the streets, it is white racism, and so on.  <br>
 <br>
Nevertheless, white liberals are not completely delusional.  They rarely send their children to predominately black public schools.  </p>

		<p>How many times do we have to read this reality and the White victim always ends up &#8220;forgiving&#8221; the nonwhite perp. Many even have family that have married these nonwhites, so they &#8220;think&#8221; they are okay.  We never hear of them promoting segregation/separation or joining WN groups or even dare mentioning the out of control black on white crime data. In fact, I will bet they are the first to call Whites racists, who dare defend our race. Seems we have been talking for decades now and nothing is getting any better, only worse, for the White race. More action and education is needed for Whites to ever awaken to their genocide.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Police say the woman told them that as they were driving out they stopped on the third floor to let a car back out of a space and were confronted by about 10 young black males and attacked for no reason. She told police that some of the men pulled her husband out of the car and beat him and some of the men jumped on the car and knocked the front bumper off the car.&#8221;</p>
<p>So as she was pulling out she was courteous enough to stop and let a car back out of the space.  They were confronted by 10 young black males? Ok, so they didn&rsquo;t see these blacks hanging around? Or, if they weren&rsquo;t by the other car, they didn&rsquo;t notice them approaching her car? Some of the men pulled her husband out of the car.  Um&hellip;why weren&rsquo;t the doors locked? Some of the men jumped on the car and knocked the front bumper off.  Ok, put the car in reverse and put your foot on the gas.  How fast would they go flying off the car? If the pack of 10 then started to approach the car, put it in drive and head straight for them.  With 10 black males attaching your car without knowing what their final intent is going to be or whether or not they are armed, a case for &#8220;fear for your life&#8221; and &#8220;self defense&#8221; could probably be made if a few were run over.</p>
<p>Common sense should have had this situation turn out very differently.  Over the summer I took my 10 year old son to the museum in Harrisburg.  As soon as we got off the interstate and started entering the city I made certain the car doors were locked.  As we were walking around downtown, I made certain he was right by my side and made certain I knew who was walking in front of us and, more importantly, who was walking behind us.  I payed careful attention to any groups of young black and/or Hispanic males and whenever I saw them was more in a heightened state of alert.  While it was a beautiful summer day with the downtown filled mostly with government office workers, it certainly was a lesson to my son because I explained to him what I was doing and most importantly WHY.  Already at his age he&rsquo;s aware young black males are the most dangerous people and to avoid them at all costs.  Hopefully this young lady will have now learned her lesson that apparently her parents did not teach her.  <br>

<p>We DO have protection. It&rsquo;s called the Second Amendment. I don&rsquo;t know what state you live in, but SCOTUS has incorporated the Second Amendment against every state, city and township in the USA, thanks to McDonald v. Chicago. </p>
<p>If you have a gun, learn how to use it proficiently. If you don&rsquo;t have a gun, get one. Don&rsquo;t let anyone tell you it&rsquo;s wrong to own a gun, or, you don&rsquo;t need a gun, as the cops will protect you..</p>

		<p>Liberals who support the replacement of white populations with non-white populations deserve to have such things happen to them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, innocent people who do not support the ethnic cleansing of whites are victims too.</p>
<p>Oppose immigration, Affirmative Action and the ethnic cleansing of whites.</p>

		<p>blaize you are correct however a 19 year old female is more of a girl than a woman these days. </p>
<p>When I lived outside of Atlanta I would lecture my naieve 20 something niece about keeping her car doors locked, she would respond with &#8220;No one will bother me, they don&rsquo;t want to steal this junky car, I don&rsquo;t have anything they want&#8221;. In fact her car had been broken into twice so she should have smartened up.</p>
<p>Explaining that some people would rape and beat her for fun just didn&rsquo;t sink in; some people won&rsquo;t get it until something awful happens to them.</p>

		<p>What we need to start reading are reports of Whites turning the tables on Black attackers and leaving them injured and if necessary dead. They&rsquo;ll begin to think (as far as these knuckle dragging thugs are capable of thinking) twice before assuming that Whites are an easy target.<br>
Be it gun, knife, chemical.</p>

		<p>&#8220;According to FBI, Uniform Crime Reports, the crime rate in New York city peaked in 1980 at 6,911.6 offenses per 100,000 inhabitants. Now it is 2,320.7. That is lower than in 1965 when it was 3,065.6.<br>
<a href="https://www.disastercenter.com/crime/nycrime.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.disastercenter.com/crime/nycrime.htm</a></p>
<p>Crime is still a serious problem, and it is certainly true that when blacks move into a neighborhood the crime rate goes up, but let&rsquo;s not exaggerate things&#8221;</p>
<p>Exxagerate things? You google up some numbers and then tell me our personal experience back then was somehow &#8220;exaggerated&#8221;?! All seeing eye, huh? Leaving aside the delusional arrogance of your facile dismissal I&rsquo;ll bring up a few points.</p>
<p>First, you are comparing apples to oranges. You are talking the entire city and I am talking about one neighborhood. I grew up in East New York, which despite its blue-collar character was still pretty safe until the mid/late 1960&rsquo;s. Like the old saying goes you could sleep with your windows open at night. By the mid &rsquo;70s it was one of the homocide leaders of the city (I think it was no. 1 in &#8216;75), all concurrent with a rise in the black population. So, according to your statistics everything peaked and my old block is once again at its past leafy quiet. Right.</p>
<p>Second, crime statistics do not tell the whole story by a long shot. With Giuliani, Bratton and Compstat the police became much more professional (they we&rsquo;re a disaster in the &rsquo;70s) and to this day maintain that high level. Since every martial arts studio is filled with cops I knew plenty of them as well as the ones in my local precinct and I can tell you that it&rsquo;s true. The broken windows theory and subsequent zero tolerance has proven very effective. What that means in reality though is not a true civic peace but instead a lid on a cauldron (worse now with all these ethnic groups here). By contrast to ENY close-by Richmond Hill, when it was all white, maintained itself clean, quiet and safe even throughout the horrible Dinkins years. Somehow we did quite well over there even without Compstat. I wonder why? </p>
<p>Third, the point of the above story is not crime per se but to highlight the reality that these anecdotes here including my own confirm in spades. The root of our problem is the naivete of far too many whites out there who vote unconsciously and from the safety of their neighborhoods never give the issue of race any thought. And now they are being confronted with it in the most brutal ways and have to come to terms with that. How they do determines how this will all turn out. No statistic will ever tell us that.</p>

<p>Thank you very much.<br>
Those sites are very interesting for people out of the USA reading this page. If you only talk about a city like Philadelphia, we don&rsquo;t know that in the city mosts are black.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s pretty simple, folks: pack heat.  </p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be Dirty Harry and carry a gun that&rsquo;s longer than your forearm.  </p>
<p>Even a .32 Kel-Tec would sen the most brazen Africans fleeing for their monthly checks.</p>
<p>Make sure, however, that you know what the state laws are on your firearm.  You could have every moral and self-preservational right to cap off a few rounds, but some Hebraic, allegedly Caucasian state&rsquo;s attorney will indict your rear end if you should you unjustly frightened a few of America&rsquo;s protected class.</p>
<p>Get heat but get legal advice, too.  Ammo is cheaop but lawsuits and bail aren&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>There is a new series on NYPD called Blue Bloods starring Tom Selleck.<br>
I&rsquo;ve seen 4 episodes thus far. I&rsquo;m still waiting to see a Black Criminal portrayed. I suspect that my wait will be protracted.<br>
Law And Order SVU deals with sex crimes in NYC<br>
I Still haven&rsquo;t seen a Black rapist. It&rsquo;s all too apparent that Whites really commit all the rapes in NY and cleverly get Blacks arrested for them. They probably make themselves up just as Robert Downey did in that film.</p>

		<p>I was watching a documentary on TV this last week and it was about the L.A. Riots. <br>
One of the blacks being interviewed said that after the Police backed down to the black rioters who were breaking into stores they knew they were in control.Then he said something to the effect of &hellip;when we saw the police would do nothing we beat and robbed every white who went through there.<br>
I looked at my wife and said that pretty much sums it up doesn&rsquo;t it.</p>
<p>P.S. I do not think that random attacks happen as much in the south.Far too many whites have guns (permit or not). To try and make a Reinal Denny out of a southern man is a very risky proposition.   </p>

		<p>&#8220;Attacked for no reason&#8221; by a group of 10 blacks, so reads the article. A question:  Since when do blacks need a reason to attack?  Their blackness in and of itself is the rationale.  </p>

Use roof parking. <br>
