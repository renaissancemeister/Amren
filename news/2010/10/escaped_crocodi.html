<h1><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/22/escaped-crocodile-congo-plane-crash">Escaped Crocodile May Have Caused Congo Plane Crash</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Guardian (London), October 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A plane crash which killed a British pilot and 19 others could have been caused by an escaped crocodile, it was reported today.</p>
<p>The aircraft plummeted to the ground in the Democratic Republic of Congo when the reptile, which had been smuggled into the cabin, sparked panic among passengers, the unnamed sole survivor told magazine Jeune Afrique.</p>
<p>A British expert, who is investigating the crash for the Department for Transport (DfT), said he could not rule out a crocodile as the cause, but added it would be &#8220;extremely unlikely&#8221;.</p>
<p>First Officer Chris Wilson, from Gloucestershire, was among those killed when the Let-410 plane crashed on 25 August.</p>
<p>It was travelling from Kinshasa to Bandundu when the plane went down, not far from its destination in an area of straw-covered huts.</p>
<p>According to reports, the accident followed a stampede of terrified passengers fleeing the crocodile after it freed itself from a sports bag in which it had been carried on board.</p>
<p>Tim Atkinson, of the Air Accidents Investigations branch of the DfT, dealing with the accident from the UK, said: &#8220;If this were the cause of the accident it is truly extraordinary.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would say it&rsquo;s extremely unlikely this story holds water but I wouldn&rsquo;t rule it out completely.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that there had been reports of passengers making their way to the front of the aircraft prior to landing, which may have led to the crash.<br>

		<p>No pilot should fly any commercial aircraft that does not have a reinforced bulkhead between the passenger and flight crew compartments.  The airline security protocols in the Congo are no doubt as well run as anything else in the Congo and I have no reason to doubt that a crocodile was brought aboard.  Perhaps as a snack or magic potion?</p>

		<p>If the passengers crowded to one end of the cabin or the other fleeing from the croc, they could have thrown the aircraft seriously outside its weight and balance specs, rendering it effectively unflyable.</p>
<p>My guess is that this is what happened.  Depending on the level of sophistication of the flight data recorder, it may be able to confirm this.</p>

Was the crocodile (presumably small) to serve as lunch?   &mdash;    but it had different intentions?</p>

		<p>US Federal Aviation regs require a dangerous animal on a flight to be contained in an approved container and escorted by a person trained in controlling the animal. I would assume that European, most Asian or Austrailian regulations would be the same. Long story short, this incident would probably not happen here. </p>

Tim, this is AFRICA we&rsquo;re dealing with here. Your white European notions of &#8220;ordinary&#8221; and &#8220;extraordinary&#8221; don&rsquo;t apply. In black Africa, the extraordinary is ordinary; and the ordinary is extraordinary. </p>
<p>Extraordinarily STUPID, that is. </p>
<p>You know: like packing a live crocodile into you carry-on luggage. </p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right but remember about whom we&rsquo;re talking. We&rsquo;re talkin&rsquo; Congolese ovah heaah!<br>

<p>1.  If the aircraft crashed close to it&rsquo;s destination, that means it was likely in a gear down, high-lift surfaces deployed, flight condition which means that you don&rsquo;t have literally thousands of pounds of high speed air acting as a lever to keep the nose up when the CG shifted.  That said, the first thing most aircraft do when the high lifts are deployed is adopt a slight nose-up pitch state (depending on how they are trimmed among other things).  So you are likely looking at an uphill lemming run anyway&hellip;</p>
<p>2.  Why would people, experienced with the wildlife of that part of the world, be afraid of a crocodile small enough to fit into a gym bag?  Yes, it could give you a nasty bite.  No, it&rsquo;s not going to kill you.  OTOH, a plane crash at 120-150 knots will need snow shovels and glad bags to pick up all the pieces&hellip;</p>
<p>And now, the rest of the story:</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
&hellip;seemed to believe a &ldquo;lack of fuel&rdquo; caused the plane crash, the survivor contended otherwise.</p>
<p>The survivor alleged another passenger smuggled a crocodile on board. However, just as the propeller plane was on its final approach, the reptile managed to escape. The survivor, whose identity was withheld, stated, &ldquo;The terrified air hostess hurried towards the cockpit, followed by the passengers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny Philemotte, a 62-year-old Belgian pilot, was at the controls of the Czech-made L-410 Turbolet when the panicked passengers threw it off balance. </p>
<p>According to airplane safety consultant John Cox, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible. It&rsquo;s remote&hellip; You could run the center of gravity forward where it wouldn&rsquo;t be controllable. Twenty people at 200 pounds each, it&rsquo;s possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nineteen people were killed when the plane crashed into a house in close proximity to Bandundu Airport. The crocodile survived the wreck but was executed by authorities shortly after. The extent of the survivor&rsquo;s injuries was not specified. </p>
<p>Data provided by the International Air Transport Association indicated the number of major aviation accidents per million takeoffs in Africa was 4.3 just a few years ago. The worldwide average, on the other hand, is 0.65. <br>

<p>Anonymous,have you ever worked around Black people? I used to work 3rd shift at a place that employed a lot of Blacks. One girl refused to go out for a smoke break in the front of the building. She would only go out the back door to a little patio area. Why? If you went out the front door and looked way across the parking you would sometimes see a fox in the distance. Another Black girl once let out an ear-splitting scream and jumped up on her chair in a panic when she saw some kind of insect flying around.</p>
<p>Most Blacks are terrified of animals and of nature.   </p>

		<p>Are we absolutely sure the crocodile wasn&rsquo;t a Muslim terrorist reptile attempting to hijack said aircraft to protest the USA&rsquo;s /Europe&rsquo;s treatment of Muslims or whatever?</p>

<p>You have a good point.  A black woman I once worked with had a bat fly in her window at home.  (It just flapped around, then flew out again.) She was utterly terrified.  The next day, she was still in a panic and afraid to return home. It was all she could talk about.  She was respirating heavily and was practically swooning with fright. (Maybe she thought it was a vampire???) The most horrible thing that ever happened to her!</p>
<p>Another occasion (and another black woman), somebody said they thought there was a mouse in the office. She was instantly standing up on her chair, shreiking. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why blacks don&rsquo;t go hiking in the woods and don&rsquo;t like national parks.  There might be animals, god forbid!<br>
