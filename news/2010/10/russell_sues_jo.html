<h1>Russell Sues Journalists, GOP Leaders</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gerald McKinstry, Journal News (White Plains, New York), October 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A congressional candidate whose writings on race and religion gained national attention is suing nine people, claiming they smeared his name and undermined his candidacy in the press and on television.</p>
<p>Republican Jim Russell, 56, is seeking $9 million in damages, or $1 million from each person named in the lawsuit.</p>
<p>He claimed various members of The Journal News, News 12, Regional News Network and the state and local GOP defamed his character, ruined his reputation and caused him emotional distress.</p>
<p>Russell, who has run for Congress five times, including his latest candidacy, last month lost the GOP&rsquo;s backing in his race against Democratic Rep. Nita Lowey.</p>
<p>The Republican Party dropped its support of Russell after it was reported that some of his past works included racist and anti-Semitic themes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will not tolerate this,&#8221; Russell said Tuesday, standing outside Westchester County Court in White Plains. &#8220;We will not tolerate political correctness being imposed upon us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the party&rsquo;s withdrawal of support, Russell still will appear on the Republican line on the Nov. 2 ballot in his bid to win the 18th Congressional District, which covers most of Westchester and part of Rockland counties. Russell also still has the Conservative line.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit filed in state Supreme Court, Russell challenged a variety of news accounts that called his views and writings racist. He accused the media, which he labeled the &#8220;liberal media,&#8221; of attacking and undermining the campaigns of &#8220;patriotic candidates.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The lawsuit stems from reports and articles on Russell&rsquo;s 16-page essay, &#8220;The Western Contribution to World History.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In addition to quoting authors critical of racial and religious integration, it warned against racial mixing.</p>
<p>Russell has repeatedly denied that he is racist and said that he does not subscribe to hatred or animosity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Intimidated individuals do not express themselves freely out of fear of being labeled by the media,&#8221; according to a release issued Tuesday by Russell. &#8220;This unhealthy and un-American situation can and will be corrected only when enough of us decide that we will fight back against the enforcers of political correctness.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I sympathize with the thrust of Russell&rsquo;s views and salute his poltical courage. However he&rsquo;s a public figure. A hard category to be part of when you want to sue political opponents. The courts anywhere would be tough for Russell;in suburban New York City, an impossibility. I&rsquo;m amazed he still is on the ballot. </p>
<p>Most of the voters who will show up on November 2 where he&rsquo;s running are either black or Jewish, or affluent Protestants with liberal consciences they can afford, since they live in districts far from Brooklyn, Bronx or Harlem.</p>
<p>Regardless of how the GOP does in November, the road currently is very hard for honest race conscious white candidates regardless of location. </p>
<p>The fight of ideas needs to be fought in the schools and colleges, and in the media, to educate a new barely born generation. The current 18-30 year olds (love gays,Obama, black music, and race mixing)  are hopeless, and most of the older generation are polluted by the PC education and media originating in the Sixties and Seventies. </p>
<p>It will take another generation if people stand fast and try to tell the truth. Thanks anyway, Mr. Russell.</p>

		<p>Although I admire him for his willingness to fight openly, I question the wisdom of this.  Not only the party, but the courts are infiltrated with communists who will advance their agenda no matter what the law says.</p>
<p>What is needed here is power&hellip;..leverage.  In order to get it, people of right mind need to be willing to go underground to infiltrate BOTH parties.  Pretend to be radical communists and neo-cons, respectively.  Once in, bring in those of like mind, who hide what they think&hellip;..until you take over.</p>
<p>THEN reveal your real agenda and pull in populist support around it.</p>
<p>Saul Alinsky (literally) wrote the book on this.  Nothing says that communists are the only ones who can use those techniques&hellip;..and do it better.</p>

<p>BINGO!!! That&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;ve been saying here on Amren for a long time now. I ALWAYS speak up - loudly - at parties\get togethers when someone tries to feed us the &#8220;diversity is our strength&#8221; nonsense during conversations. My wife always says &#8220;please try not to cause a scene tonight&#8221; whenever we go someplace. I used to be timid about speaking up, but now I actually get a rush when I&rsquo;m able to make a White liberal look foolish. But I&rsquo;m smart enough to use FACTS - to which I owe Amren and the Amren posters many thanks. This site gives me the &#8220;ammo&#8221; to fight my battles.   </p>

		<p>I once read in a forbidden book that we can have a free press again, but we will have to cut a lot of editors throats to get it. This article reveals that those words are even more true today than they were in the late 1970&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I predict that the court will agree with the propagandist press. They will throw out this man&rsquo;s case because they are afraid of being portrayed in the progressive-controlled media as racist-sympathizers for protecting the rights of a man who pointed out obvious but unpopular facts.</p>
<p>If advocates for the rights of the historical majority of America cannot freely express their thoughts without being smeared by journalists with an un-American agenda who operate with the clear permission of our judicial system, then I fear that we are frighteningly close to a lawless time of violent purges.</p>
<p>I am curious as to why the historical majority is still looking to the Republican party to fix our problems when that party has been complicit in creating every problem that is presently impacting our lives. </p>
<p>Am I the only one who is disheartened and disappointed every time the spineless Republicans  bend over frontwards and sacrifice one of their own to please any social engineer with a degree in journalism and a knack for blackmail?</p>
<p>I am personally in favor of grooming and electing county and state leaders who are willing to start well-armed state militias and form allegiances with other states populated and led by like-minded citizens who desire to impose limits on federal power.</p>

<p>Well, you can sit around for 20 years and wait on the next generation to grow up but I&rsquo;m going to vote for racially conscious candidates which seem to be trickling into the mainstream.  All the taboos are falling to the wayside and the dam is breaking, now is the fight!</p>

		<p>he will get the support of Italians ( none of their tribe is in the race). Wasps( the remnant)Poles( forgotten bloc)and Irish(most conservative). He just needs to get his message out. The phony press will,of course be no help.But stunts like the one described above will help. He has a shot.</p>

		<p>#%: By all means vote for those few Whites who have the stones to say what they believe, and are not afraid of saying what is true, in public. </p>
<p>So then, I can count on your vote? I would never get elected, because I don&rsquo;t give a damn about what anyone thinks, and I am only too happy to put it in those terms. </p>
<p>Just the same,Didactic is right. Only a few Baby Boomers have opened their eyes to see what their precious &#8220;Peace&#8221; and &#8220;Civil Rights&#8221; protests have actually brought this Country; which is complete ruin, on a people with a unique culture. </p>
<p>And the children, and now the grandchildren, of these pot-smoking Liberal Hippies are now jumping around to Rap &#8220;music&#8221;. So, now there are three lost generations of dead wood.</p>
<p>No, we have to do a much better job of reaching our youth, today, many who feel alienated by this putrid Society their parents, and grandparents, helped to create. These kids need a group which will help lead them and support them, in and out of School.</p>
<p>AmRen should step up and form a social and political group for disenfranchised White Youth. The current organizations, such as Young Americans for Liberty are wonderful, as far as they go, but they fail to include the one key factor to all of this, which is Race pride, and real American Cultural identity.</p>

		<p>Political free speech is considered the most sacrosanct of all, and thus press opinion will never be quelched in the U.S., at least at the present time.  Russell most likely knows this full well, but he can at least get publicity for his cause by suing. <br/>
This nation&rsquo;s liberal elites apparently don&rsquo;t realize just how race-realist most Americans are.  The former accuse Republicans, Tea Partiers, and conservative Democrats of being racists, yet if we&rsquo;re as they say, then why would we care about such an accusation?  Blacks, both pundit and common person, are all over TV now wailing about the coming right-wing takeover, calling the opposition everything from Satan worshippers to Nazis, reminding whites just why the tsunami is coming.</p>

		<p>Frankly this defeatist propaganda that a few of you posters like to indulge in is just a little too transparent.  This is a positive story and it just goes to show that pro-White candidates are seeping into the political mainstream.  I wonder how many of these people have slipped past the net and are operating covertly in our nation&rsquo;s capitol?  What some of you don&rsquo;t understand is that there is a political earthquake happening that will shift the discourse in politics for at least the next half century.  Nothing like this has been seen since the 1960s counter culture of flag and bra burning hippies, flower power, getting high on pot and marching for &#8220;civil rights&#8221;.  Only this time the wind is blowing in another direction and your reign is living on borrowed time. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m glad to see white conservative men acting like white conservative men, but I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s too late.  Why weren&rsquo;t they like this, say, 20 or 30 years ago?  Why weren&rsquo;t they like this when there were more able-bodied, youthful white conservative men than there were angry, hateful, anti-white males taking our women, stealing from us, and displacing us?</p>

		<p>As for the baby boomers, I couldn&rsquo;t agree more with some of the comments posted above but I believe some clarification is needed. I went to Vietnam for the first time in august 1966 and then again in 1968 for another tour. The difference between the troops morale and temperment was astounding in just that 2 1/2 year period. It seems the media had done it&rsquo;s job well but I was too young at that time too understand what had happened to cause such a change. I was 18 years old the first time I went and 20 years old the second time. It wasn&rsquo;t actually until I got out of the army in 1969 that I began to see things that I had never been aware of while I had been in. Protestors on college campuses were carrying North Vietnamese and Viet Cong flags, had no respect at all for the military, disrespected totally returning troops calling us all sorts of vile names which I will never forget or forgive and took every opportunity to run down the country I loved and had bled for. I could not believe what I was seeing and hearing. These privileged people were openly supporting an enemy of the U.S. and desired her defeat in this war. I was stunned. I thought I had landed on another planet, so alien was all that was going on to me. My point is this, on the whole there is a unbridgeable divide between those who went to Vietnam and those who didn&rsquo;t. Our thinking is very different. Most of us were and still are patriots and love our country and want to see her rid of all the marxist influences that are destroying her. Those who sat out the war on college campuses largely became increasingly affected by these marxist tendencies of anti-white and anti-western sentiments. I can tell you truly, the war affected me deeply and I still have bad dreams from time to time but I was more traumitized by what I saw when I came back to the U.S. because I knew that the country I had left had disappeared forever.</p>

		<p>Whether he wins or loses, the one thing you have to remember is that leftists are, at base, cowards: they want not to work to become wealthy, but to covertly take (read, steal) from another, and say they are being compassionate. It&rsquo;s all about how they APPEAR, not how they ARE. Liberals are the nebbish nerds you pushed aside in grade school, whose resentment of those of us with brains, talent, and good looks, is now given free reign in the era of &#8216;perpetual victimhood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If enough Whites sued journalists every time they get a directive from the Marxist Multicultural Mafia, as to who&rsquo;s on their &#8216;hit list&rsquo; this week, soon we&rsquo;d actually see journalists with no spine leave the profession. And like Rick Sanchez, less people would get fired from their jobs for telling the truth.</p>
<p>Which is a good thing.</p>
<p>Bravo to this man. I hope he turns everyone on their ear.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is an un-winnable case.  Nationalists in Britain, fore example, have won a number of court cases.  A recent example is the case in which a BNP member who taught school in central Birmingham (majority non-British by now, I&rsquo;m sure) was taken to court,and WON the case, even though we can assume the judge and jury were ideologically against him.  Many in the court system truly do make decisions based on what is right in the law, and not just their own political views.  So, if Mr. Russell&rsquo;s case is a good one, and I pray that it is, then he may very well win it.</p>

		<p>Along the same vein of thought, or subject, this might be a good column to mention a book I have read lately titled, &#8220;Before the Dawn.&#8221;  It is the latest book (that I know of) on the subject of genetic origins and is reviewed by E.O. Watson, the British Professor who got fired for saying that blacks were impossible to work with - some long time Amren readers and posters might remember that incident.</p>
<p>IN the book, a careful explanation of the studies made of dna since the latest techniques have been devised to demonstrate the movement and development of peoples planet wide.  One reason the book is not an international best seller is because it makes the very dry, labratory observation that Africans, that is, those peoples who did not migrate out of Africa are uniformly of a lower average intelligence than Asians, Indo-Europeans.  Special cases of for example Australian Aboriginals are discussed.</p>
<p>I highly recommend the book.  It is of great use in defending not so much a white superiority claim, but an African inferiority assertion.</p>
<p>Anyone to miscegenates with Africans is absolutely stepping backward genetically speaking.</p>

<p>Poster #12&hellip;..I was very ashamed of our people at that time. I am so sorry for what many did to you Vietnam vets! I, for one, want to apologize to you all for what so many did to you young men! Over 50,000 of our men died in that awful war and for what? Did it protect us and our freedoms?  Nope, it made America worse and the politicians who got us there need to be hung. The same thing goes for Iraq and Afghanistan &#8220;wars&#8221;.</p>
<p> I was in my 20&rsquo;s and raising my kids and did not know too much about that war or politics. But, I did often wonder why the USA was fighting for those nonwhite peoples over there and then bringing them into America as &#8220;refugees&#8221;. Many on here have defended the Hmongs/Vietnamese in the past, but I have lived here among them for all these years and they are not what I would call, &#8220;Americans&#8221;, and I often wondered why do we fight and lose our best men in wars to &#8220;save&#8221; these people? </p>
<p> Shouldn&rsquo;t those people be fighting their own wars and leave us out of it? We have gained nothing from these wars, only more deaths and misery brought upon us is all I can see.</p>
<p>Anyway, thank you and hope you and others like you know that many of us did care and would never protest against our own soldiers. It was the politicians (and their string pullers) that were responsible for it all.</p>
