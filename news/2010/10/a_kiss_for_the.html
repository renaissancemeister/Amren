			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jaya Narain, Daily Mail (London), October 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When the happy couple could barely communicate with each other because they didn&rsquo;t share a common language, it was a little suspicious.</p>
<p>But when the groom couldn&rsquo;t even recall the name of his bride, the couple could be fairly sure the game was up.</p>
<p>Yesterday Portuguese-born Jorge Mouchinho and his Trinidadian bride Falana McKenzie were jailed for a year after she paid him Â£2,000 to go through a sham marriage with her.</p>
<p>The couple had booked to marry at Nottingham Register Office in August.</p>
<p>But staff became suspicious when they appeared nervous and hesitant at a meeting prior to the wedding.</p>
<p>They had difficulty communicating with each other without an interpreter and Mouchinho was unable to give his prospective wife&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>So staff alerted police and, just when they were about to say &#8216;I do&rsquo; at the wedding ceremony, they were interrupted by the UK Border Agency.</p>
<p>Nottingham Crown Court was told that as an EU citizen, Mouchinho, 33, had a legal right to be in the UK.</p>
<p>But his bride-to-be did not. McKenzie, 30, from Trinidad, had previously been in the UK legitimately on student and working visas, but her most recent student visa expired in April this year.</p>
<p>When McKenzie&rsquo;s home was searched, photos were found of her with a boyfriend who was not Mouchinho.</p>
<p>It also emerged that the couple had lived more than 140 miles apart  &mdash;  Mouchinho&rsquo;s last address was in Arnold, Nottinghamshire, while McKenzie had previously lived in Dulwich in South London.</p>
<p>Yesterday they were both given 12-month sentences after McKenzie admitted entering the UK without leave while Mouchinho pleaded guilty at the same court to assisting unlawful immigration. Judge Michael Stokes QC said: &#8216;It is a very serious offence to seek to circumvent the immigration laws of this country.</p>
<p>&#8216;This sort of activity simply has to be stamped out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>McKenzie will be deported at the end of her sentence.</p>
<p>The case comes after a series of raids on wedding ceremonies across the UK.</p>
<p>In Sheffield a 21-year-old woman was led across a city centre street in a full-length white dress and handcuffs after the UK Border Agency targeted a suspected sham marriage. They swooped on the ceremony as a 36-year-old Afghan &#8216;groom&rsquo; and his Slovak &#8216;bride&rsquo; were preparing to tie the knot in Sheffield Register Office.</p>
<p>They were arrested by the waiting officers along with two guests.</p>
<p>All four were marched out past stunned shoppers and onlookers and into waiting police vans.</p>
<p>Since July, there have been 53 sham marriage swoops across the country, resulting in 126 arrests.</p>

		<p>The second most significant effect of the communizing of western Europe is that it degrades the identity of each nation it swallows.  </p>
<p>The most significant effect is it&rsquo;s contribution to white genocide.  </p>

		<p>Sometimes feeling that Canadian immigration is hopeless, and adding cynicism, I have considered the financial remuneration possible from a sham marriage in a moral capitalist manner e.g. auctioning my bachelor status to a white South African female. But 2000 quid? Are you nuts? I was thinking more of &lsquo;everything you have, discussions start at 100,000 after consummation, gays require top dollar (consummation unthinkable)&rsquo;. Any ideas on a reasonable contract framework/ $ figure?</p>

		<p>just because he is listed as being from portugal doesnt mean he is a a native portugese, he could be  an immigrant to portugal or the off spring of a white portugese and some other race.</p>

		<p>Portuguese are a white race, but from what I have read in the past few years, due to a constant influx from former colonies (Angola, Mozambique, Cape Verde, etc.), about 10% of the population of Portugal is now black.   Maybe someone has more specific stats.</p>

<p>No, Portuguese are Whites.  But because the Brazilian population speaks Portuguese, many Brazilians emigrate to Portugal.  That is most likely how this guy came to be Portuguese.</p>

		<p>Jorge looks like an African just like she is&hellip;..He sure does not look Greek. He was born there the article states, so I imagine he is a black born in Greece. Just like a black who is born in Germany is then called a &#8220;German&#8221;&hellip;</p>

<p>Several hundred years ago the Portuguese were blond haired and blue eyed. They were world leader then, with a large colonial empire.</p>

		<p>This is how we should do marriage in the USA. </p>
<p>Just pay cash up front for &#8220;services to be rendered.&#8221;</p>
<p>That way, at the end of the contract (now typically less than five years in America) then there would be no cause for support payments, or other forms of state-sponsored extortion of money from the men.</p>
<p>On an open and honest market, that girl probably would never have fetched 2,000. A more likely price would be $20, plus the cost of curing her multiple STDs.</p>

		<p>I am surprised by the large number of Amren commenters here who appear to be so uninformed abut the history of Portugal. </p>
<p>In a nutshell, here&rsquo;s why the Portuguese man from this story is so dark skinned, for those of you who are clueless about the history of Portugal : </p>
<p>Portugal was indeed an all-white European nation once. At one point, Portugal was the uncontested Master of the World, with an empire larger than the Spanish or British Empires. </p>
<p>Unlike the British however, and to a lesser degree the Spanish, the Portuguese did not shun the notion of intermarriage with the natives of her colonies. </p>
<p>Portugal was one of the first European countries to be super-friendly to her African slaves, and to not look down at all upon white/black miscegenation. </p>
<p>That is why, to quote Dennis Hopper (aka Mr. Worsley), blond hair, blue eyes, became black hair, dark skin. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XR8WjPEjpVg] [I highly recommend viewing this clip and saving it, as it likely will be scrubbed from YouTube when enough people find out about it. As it is both Google and YouTube display it less readily, when searching, than they did a mere three months ago. Interesting.]. </p>
<p>Today Portugal is one of the poorest countries of Europe. However, as the EU grows, this distinction will surely be claimed in the future by her more backwards south-easterly neighbours, such as (God forbid that she is admitted) Turkey. I have lived in Portugal, so I can attest to the backward nature of the place. I have also lived in Paris, so I can also confirm with supreme confidence that the Portuguese are regarded there in the same way that Latinos are regarded in the United States. In fact, in Paris, one finds two types of people in the ground-floor &#8220;concierge&#8221; apartments of fancy buildings: those from Portugal and those from Brittany.</p>
<p>Up until a few years ago, just about every decent apartment building in Paris had a &#8220;concierge&#8221;: a little lady in a white apron who lived in a ground-floor apartment whose laced-curtained windows overlooked the grand entry foyer. Often, before the advent of &#8220;digicodes&#8221; (the electronic keypad that opens a building&rsquo;s front door with a code), the concierge were the ones who opened the door for residents and guests alike, after one rang the doorbell. </p>
<p>I lived in a magnificent apartment building in the rue de Grenelle in central Paris, on the 7th floor, in a small &#8220;chambre de bonne,&#8221; while attending classes at the same Political Science Institute from which the founder of this web site graduated. The building&rsquo;s concierge was named Maria, she and her family were from Portugal, she was strict but delightful, and naturally at the time (mid-80s) I thought nothing of it (the fact that she was from Portugal, as were 60% of all other Paris concierges). </p>
