<h1><a href="https://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=2758198">White &amp; Guilty: &#8216;Whiteness&rsquo; Workshop Helps Expose Your Inner Racist</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Johnathan Kay, National Post (Toronto), April 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sandy, Jim and Karen work at a downtown community centre where they help low-income residents apply for rental housing. Sandy has a bad feeling about Jim: She notices that when black clients come in, he tends to drift to the back of the office. Sandy suspects racism (she and Jim are both white). On the other hand, she also notices that Jim seems to get along well with Karen, who is black. As the weeks go by, Sandy becomes more uncomfortable with the situation. But she feels uncertain about how to handle it. Test question: What should Sandy do?</p>
<p>If you answered that Sandy&rsquo;s first move should be to talk to Karen, and ask how Jim&rsquo;s behaviour made her feel, you are apparently a better anti-racist than me.</p>
<p>That, for what it&rsquo;s worth, was the preferred solution offered by my instructor at &#8220;Thinking About Whiteness and Doing Anti-Racism,&#8221; a four-part evening workshop for community activists, presented earlier this year at the Toronto Women&rsquo;s Bookstore.</p>
<p>My own answer, announced in class, was that Sandy should approach Jim discreetly, explaining to him how others in the office might perceive his actions. Or perhaps the manager of the community centre could give a generic presentation about the need to treat clients in a colour-blind manner, on a no-names basis.</p>
<p>The problem with my approach, the instructor indicated, lay in the fact that I was primarily concerned with the feelings of my fellow Caucasian, Jim. I wasn&rsquo;t treating Karen like a &#8220;full human being&#8221; who might have thoughts and worries at variance with the superficially friendly workplace attitude.</p>
<p>Moreover, I was guilty of &#8220;democratic racism&#8221;  &mdash;  by which we apply ostensibly race-neutral principles such as &#8220;due process,&#8221; constantly demanding clear &#8220;evidence&#8221; of wrongdoing, rather than confronting prima facie instances of racism head-on. &#8220;It seems we&rsquo;re always looking for more proof,&#8221; said the instructor, an energetic left-wing activist who&rsquo;s been teaching this course for several years. &#8220;When it comes to racism, you have to trust your gut.&#8221;</p>
<p>I felt the urge to pipe up at this. Racism is either a serious charge or it&rsquo;s not. And if it is, as everyone in this room clearly believed, then it cannot be flung around casually without giving the accused a chance to explain his actions. But I said nothing, and nodded my head along with everyone else. I&rsquo;d come to this class not to impose my democratic racism on people, but to observe.</p>
<p>Most of the other 13 students were earnest, grad-student types in their 20s  &mdash;  too young to remember the late 1980s and early 1990s, when political correctness first took root on college campuses. The jargon I heard at the bookstore took me back to that age  &mdash;  albeit with a few odd variations. &#8220;Allyship&#8221; has replaced &#8220;solidarity&#8221; in the anti-racist lexicon, for instance, when speaking about inter-racial activist partnerships. I also heard one student say she rejected the term &#8220;gender-neutral&#8221; as sexist, and instead preferred &#8220;gender-fluid.&#8221; One did not &#8220;have&#8221; a gender or sexual orientation; the operative word is &#8220;perform&#8221;  &mdash;  as in, &#8220;Sally performs her queerness in a very femme way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The instructor&rsquo;s Cold War-era Marxist jargon added to the retro intellectual vibe. Like just about everyone in the class, she took it for granted that racism is an outgrowth of capitalism, and that fighting one necessarily means fighting the other. At one point, she asked us to critique a case study about &#8220;Cecilia,&#8221; a community activist who spread a message of tolerance and mutual respect in her neighbourhood. Cecilia&rsquo;s approach was incomplete, the instructor informed us, because she neglected to sound the message that &#8220;classism is a form of oppression.&#8221; The real problem faced by visible minorities in our capitalist society isn&rsquo;t a lack of understanding, &#8220;it&rsquo;s the fundamentally inequitable nature of wage labour.&#8221;</p>
<p>The central theme of the course was that this twinned combination of capitalism and racism has produced a cult of &#8220;white privilege,&#8221; which permeates every aspect of our lives. &#8220;Canada is a white supremacist country, so I assume that I&rsquo;m racist,&#8221; one of the students said matter-of-factly during our first session. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not about not being racist. Because I know I am. It&rsquo;s about becoming less racist.&#8221; At this, another student told the class: &#8220;I hate when people tell me they&rsquo;re colour-blind. That is the most overt kind of racism. When people say &#8216;I don&rsquo;t see your race,&rsquo; I know that&rsquo;s wrong. To ignore race is to be more racist than to acknowledge race. I call it neo-racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>All of the students were white (to my eyes, anyway). And most were involved in what might broadly be termed the anti-racism industry  &mdash;  an overlapping hodgepodge of community-outreach activists, equity officers, women&rsquo;s studies instructors and the like. Most said they&rsquo;d come so they could integrate anti-racism into their work. Yet a good deal of the course consisted of them unburdening themselves of their own racist guilt. The instructor set the tone, describing an episode in which she&rsquo;d lectured a colleague of colour about his job. &#8220;When I realized what I was doing, I approached him afterward and apologized,&#8221; she told the class. &#8220;I said to him. &#8216;I&rsquo;m so sorry! I&rsquo;m unloading so much whiteness on you right now.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Another woman described her torment when a friend asked her to give a presentation about media arts to a group of black students  &mdash;  an exercise that would have made a spectacle of her white privilege. &#8220;Should I say yes? Or is it my responsibility to say no?&#8221; she said. &#8220;But then [my friend] may say, &#8216;I want you to do it  &mdash;  because you have a particular approach.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;But wait! Could it be that the reason I have that &#8216;particular approach&rsquo; is that I&rsquo;ve been raised to think that I could have that particular approach, that I have the ability, that I am able to access education in a particular way? All these things are in my head, in my heart, not really knowing how to respond. On the other hand, I also recognize that the person asking me has the agency to decide that I&rsquo;m the right person .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so I say yes!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But then I&rsquo;m still thinking &#8216;I don&rsquo;t know if I did the right thing.&rsquo; I still struggle with this all the time.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>
<p>An especially telling moment came when someone raised the subject of Third World nannies who immigrate to Canada under government-sponsored caregiver programs. The instructor told the class that the practice was inherently &#8220;super-exploitative.&#8221; She also pointed us to an article included in the week&rsquo;s reading, &#8220;Black Women and Work,&#8221; in which Canadian author Dionne Brand argues that cynical employers use appeals such as &#8220;You know that you&rsquo;re part of the family&#8221; to emotionally blackmail nannies, housekeepers and elder-care workers into the continuation of abusive work relationships. </p>
<p>One of the students  &mdash;  I&rsquo;ll use the name &#8220;Chris&#8221; (having promised not to identify any attendee by name)  &mdash;  interjected, apologetically. Chris couldn&rsquo;t help but confess that her own family had employed just such a nanny, who truly did seem &#8220;part of the family.&#8221; For several minutes, Chris gave details, describing all the touching, intimate ways in which the nanny&rsquo;s family had become intermingled with Chris&rsquo;s own.</p>
<p>This speech from the heart caused a ripple of discomfort. One woman suggested that the nanny has adopted a &#8220;coping mechanism&#8221; to deal with her subordinate situation. This led to a discussion about how we must recognize the nanny&rsquo;s &#8220;agency&#8221;  &mdash;  a popular buzzword signifying that minority members must not be seen as passive victims. The instructor listened attentively  &mdash;  but didn&rsquo;t offer much more except that the example demonstrated the &#8220;contradictary-ness&#8221; of anti-racism studies. We moved on while Chris sat there, looking somewhat confused, and attracting my sympathy.</p>
<p>In fact, I felt sympathy for just about everyone in that class. In private conversation, they all seemed like good-hearted, intelligent people. But like communist die-hards confessing their counter-revolutionary thought-crimes at a Soviet workers&rsquo; council, or devout Catholics on their knees in the confessional, they also seemed utterly consumed by their sin, regarding their pallor as a sort of moral leprosy. I came to see them as Lady Macbeths in reverse  &mdash;  cursing skin with nary a &#8220;damn&rsquo;d spot.&#8221; Even basic communication with friends and fellow activists, I observed, was a plodding agony of self-censorship, in which every syllable was scrutinized for subconscious racist connotations as it was leaving their mouths.</p>
<p>While politically correct campus activists often come across as smug and single-minded, I realized, their intellectual life might more accurately be described as bipolar  &mdash;  combining an ecstatic self-conception as high priestesses who pronounce upon the racist sins of our society, alongside extravagant self-mortification in regard to their own fallen state.</p>
<p>As I watched, I tried to detach myself from this spectacle, and imagine what this unintentionally comic scene  &mdash;  a group of students sitting around, self-consciously egging each other on to be ashamed of their skin colour  &mdash;  would look like to, say, civil rights protesters from a half-century ago. If the instructor and her students ever allowed themselves to laugh, they might have found it funny.<br>

		<p>&ldquo;When it comes to racism, you have to trust your gut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that sums up liberalism&rsquo;s race views. The facts do not matter. Logic does not matter. The law does not matter. Just trust your emotions and assume that someobdy is a racist. </p>
<p>I wonder how the instructor would have felt if Mr. Kay said that &#8220;I am going to trust my gut, and assume that you are biased against white people&#8221;? </p>

&#8220;Test question: What should Sandy do?&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
She should admit that she is a self-hating, anti-white, sexist racist. Her thoughts are strictly based on the color of Jim&rsquo;s private parts. If Jim was a Mexican, or Arab, she wouldn&rsquo;t have thought anything was wrong.</p>

		<p>&#8220;like communist die-hards confessing their counter-revolutionary thought-crimes at a Soviet workers&rsquo; council&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Great article, with plenty to consider.</p>
<p>My first thought is to point out that likening this &#8220;workshop&#8221; to communist self-criticism sessions is not at all a stretch.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s &#8220;diversity trainings&#8221; are indeed contemporary re-education camps. Remember, the Khmer Rouge thought they were the good guys. The PC West of tomorrow may not be filled with literal killing fields, but it is a certitude that the  employment opportunities of the future are going to be determined by one&rsquo;s adherence to specific speech codes. This is already a reality. Make sure your kids learn very valuable skills, or better yet, teach them how to be self-employed.</p>
<p>My other thought is that exposing the excesses of multiculturalism, the sort of &#8220;thought police&#8221; stuff we see in this article, needs to be a part of the white advocate agenda. Not just because so much of this politically correct stuff is patently anti-white, but because people are simply repulsed by it. Keep pointing out the absurdities, the humorlessness, the grim, paranoid world they&rsquo;re trying to create. People will naturally be on our side. It&rsquo;s a winning issue.</p>

<p>She should mind her own business! Who made HER the supreme judge on how other Whites treat blacks? The gall of these people never ceases to amaze me. It&rsquo;s like their opinion is the finale word.<br>

<p>This is the schizophrenic thinking on race today. We are told that we must strive to be &#8220;color blind&#8221; and that race is just a &#8220;social construct&#8221;. At least for Whites that is. Then we&rsquo;re told that to ignore race is &#8220;racist&#8221;. It&rsquo;s kind of like being told you must look at a sign for the rule you&rsquo;re supposed to follow and the sign  says &#8220;you&rsquo;re forbidden to read this sign&#8221;.</p>

		<p>First, Jim, who is white, should get another job. If Jim is not comfortable around blacks then working at a &#8220;downtown community centre where they help low-income residents apply for rental housing&#8221; is a big mistake. Maybe Jim needs the money. In any event, I suggest he find work at a Renaissance Faire selling turkey legs - blacks never go to Renaissance Faires.</p>
<p>Sandy, who is white, should move to inner city Newark for 3 months. When (if) she returns we can ask her about her new perspective on Jim. </p>
<p>Karen, who is black, is probably the biggest racist in the bunch and got her job through some affirmative action program. If I was Jim I&rsquo;d be careful and keep my distance because the harassment lawsuit is just around the corner.</p>
<p>I honestly cannot begin to understand the self-hatred and guilt that has been somehow drilled into the heads of these white idiots - it grieves me to say. My first few paragraphs, written somewhat facetiously, is probably what everybody thinks. So why don&rsquo;t they say it?</p>
<p>If white people just slipped the shackles of this PC/brainwashing stupidity they&rsquo;d not only feel better but act in ways to improve the situation. </p>
<p>A good point in the article is the term the &#8220;anti-racism industry.&#8221; There&rsquo;s money in this crazy mode of thinking and some people are milking it.</p>
<p>Hey, no one here is preaching violence or lynching. I just want separation and fairness - and I feel no need to apologize for that or for white racial preservation.<br>

		<p>People with this leftist mentality have taken over our institutions, instituting speech codes, enforcing affirmative action, and mandating a &#8216;tolerant&rsquo; inclusive workforce, and having fired people like the black newscaster in the earlier story. It&rsquo;s just incredible that they still get to pose as fighting the system. They are the system. I guess as long as white men still earn more money on average than other groups - that they keep importing no matter how much they are sure to suffer at the hands of white supremacy and hate. At least white men earn more money according to their researchers. Are there any other kind, aside from Richard Lynn?</p>

		<p>They may as well be giving classes on how to not fear jumping out of planes without parachutes, or how to go over Niagra Falls in a barrel without a life jacket or how to kiss rattlesnakes.</p>
<p>People are wired a cetrain way and I am sure there is a good reason for all us to have a DNA marker rooted in self preservation that gives us the gut feeling to fear strangers and keep your distance from people who are totally different then you and your tribe. </p>
<p>None of this matters because liberals will contiue to need and create nonsense jobs and for all their education they lack any trace of common sense.</p>

As expressions of &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; nuttiness go, this Whiteness Workshop is pretty pure and undiluted. A near-perfect example of the genre. True, self-flagellating white wackiness doesn&rsquo;t get much better than this. Writer Jonathan Kay deserves credit for keeping a straight face while taking his notes. <br>
 <br>
BTW, this &#8220;Wymmminz Bookstore&#8221; is adjacent to University of Toronto campus   &mdash;   something that should not surprise anyone here in the least. <br>

		<p>If they want to get over &#8220;white guilt&#8221; pretty fast all they have to do is be a white guy, without connections, looking for a job in a major southern city.  In reality these people cannot be helped.  Their brand of psychosis is too extreme.</p>

<p>Sandy should congratulate Jim on his good sense and follow his example, of course!</p>
<p>The most valuable advice I got from this site during my first years here was to avoid interaction with blacks whenever possible.</p>
<p>That policy has reduced the number of unpleasant interactions in my life and also made my life less dangerous.</p>
<p>I recommend the practice to any newbies who may be wondering why at the end of the day they feel strangely irritated.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve said it once, and I&rsquo;ll continue to say it, white multicultists are more dangerous to white people than any other group under the sun. </p>
<p>Until race traitors are socially ostracized and politically neutered whites have no chance of standing up for themselves and guaranteeing decent living conditions for their progeny. This is why I do not define myself by my stance on things like economics or foreign policy, in my view, an outright white socialist who is a race realist is a better ally than a PC libertarian.<br>

		<p>Next time one of these leftist cretins starts whining about &#8220;racism&#8221; just turn the tables on them. All you have to say is &#8220;who are you to judge me&#8221; or &#8220;don&rsquo;t be so judgemental&#8221;. If he flat out calls you one of these names then call him a child molester. Never admit or deny anything. Once you do that you make yourself the subject and thereby put yourself on trial. That&rsquo;s what they are counting on.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Thinking About Whiteness and Doing Anti-Racism,&rdquo; </p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t make sense. </p>
<p>&#8220;a four-part evening workshop for community activists, presented earlier this year at the Toronto Women&rsquo;s Bookstore.&#8221;</p>
<p>Note the venue!</p>
<p>&#8220;One woman suggested that the nanny has adopted a &ldquo;coping mechanism&rdquo; to deal with her subordinate situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coping mechanism?, subordinate situation?<br>
It&rsquo;s a bloody job for God&rsquo;s sake!</p>
<p>&#8220;The real problem faced by visible minorities in our capitalist society isn&rsquo;t a lack of understanding, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the fundamentally inequitable nature of wage labour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What do these people know of either hard work or a low paying job on the bottom rung? Obviously only the hard graft of &#8216;visible minorities&rsquo; counts, not that of their racist (and probably sexist, homophobic and let&rsquo;s not forget islamophobic) white working peers at the factory that are suffering from a distinct lack of white privilege.</p>
<p>Seriously, this stuff is just priceless, I tell ya, the Monty Python team couldn&rsquo;t have come up anything so utterly absurd. </p>

<p>don&rsquo;t you get it:</p>
<p>wanting to avoid guilt and punishment is the worst crime of all!!! <br>
you should be happy to take a hit for comrade stalin!</p>
<p>but there is also lots of hypocrisy:<br>
many of the legions of well-paid antiracist &#8220;activists&#8221; (NO!!!!! they are BUREAUCRATS!!!) are riding this gravy train.</p>
<p>my epiphany while reading:</p>
<p>these tiny-brained antiracist functionaries are like their brownskinned academic colleagues:</p>
<p>mediocrities who only have a toehold in (normally intellectually competitive) academia because of race quotas.</p>

		<p>Pathetic self-absorbed lefty whites who don&rsquo;t understand the first thing about DNA and survival. Hopefully, these weak seeds will breed with non-whites and remove themselves from the white gene pool of those of us who understand that we must survive as we are.  Yes, we also trust our gut about race and we also trust our eyes. Race is real and we want to preserve and expand our own kind.  Let the other races rise or fall on their own merits. They are not us and we are not them.</p>

		<p>&#8220;As the weeks go by, Sandy becomes more uncomfortable with the situation. But she feels uncertain about how to handle it. Test question: What should Sandy do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer:  Sandy should confront her guilt and uncertainty, take herself in hand, walk up to the top floor of the building and throw herself out the window. </p>
<p>&#8220;Most of the other 13 students were earnest, grad-student types in their 20s  &mdash;  too young to remember the late 1980s and early 1990s&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And too stupid to realize that they&rsquo;ll never have to worry about &#8220;racism in the workplace&#8221; because there won&rsquo;t be any jobs when they graduate.  </p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m unloading so much whiteness on you right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>This moron doesn&rsquo;t have a clue what &#8220;whiteness&#8221; really is.  Whiteness is Charles the Hammer defeating the Muslims at the Battle of Tours. Whiteness is Bach writing the Brandenburg Concertos, Neil Armstrong standing on the Moon. These &#8220;Twenty-Something&rsquo;s&#8221; don&rsquo;t have to worry about their &#8220;whiteness&#8221; because they&rsquo;re not white. They&rsquo;re people of the New World Order.</p>

		<p>Lets shed some light on how these &#8220;sessions&#8221; go.</p>
<p>First, from the moment the &#8220;trainees&#8221; walk into the room it is predetermined who is/are the racist(s).  We all know who that is.  The &#8220;instructor&#8221; will provide some psycho-babble scenario like the one in the article.  When the &#8220;instructor&#8221; asks for feedback he/she is just praying that the predeterminded racist offers a solution.</p>
<p>This is where the &#8220;training&#8221; takes place.  No matter what the predeterminded racist provides as a solution, no matter how democratic and thoughtfull, it will be denounced as WRONG, insensitive, etc.  The &#8220;instructor&#8221; will spin the offering on the spot to &#8220;prove&#8221; just how wrong the contributor is, demonizing them in front of the group.  This is the point where the femi-nazis in the front row nod in agreement like a third grade brown noser.  </p>
<p>These &#8220;sessions&#8221; ARE NOT training, they are a public shaming of the people they have predetermined as racists.  Since most of these sessions/classes/training are mandatory it is all too easy for them to place their &#8220;mark&#8221; on whoever they choose.  If you stay quiet, they may feel you were &#8220;trained.&#8221;  If you talk, it could mean your job. </p>
<p>You have to hand it to them, this is one heck of a good scheme.  It works!  If you are ever in one of these indoctrination sessions NEVER answer the instructor&rsquo;s questions.  ASK them questions based on reality, common sense, and hard-line data (carefully!) They will stumble horribly as it throws a giant un-expected monkey-wrench into the gears of their machine.  It feels great, trust me.</p>

		<p>If you take post-modern liberalism to it&rsquo;s logical conclusion, this is what you get. I&rsquo;ve asked libs that support affirmative action if they also give up their place in line to blacks, leave the good parking spaces for blacks, or request a demotion to make their job available to a black job seeker.   </p>

		<p>People are beginning to figure out that Political Correctness is nothing more than an attempt at re-programming.  Terms like &#8220;racist&#8221;, &#8220;prejudice&#8221;, &#8220;discrimination&#8221;, &#8220;bigot&#8221;, etc, are losing their desired effect of scaring the masses into submission.  <br>
Discrimination is the basis of survival.  What the Socialists have done, with their &#8220;peaceful&#8221; cultural revolution, is to destroy the survivability of America.  Throughout the history of man all successful peoples have had to discriminate in their actions and pre-judge situations to survive.  <br>
Socialists have used this psychological name calling to put people on the defensive and turn a rational discussion into an apology contest.  Remember, sticks and stones may break your bones but (psychological) names will never hurt you.  </p>

		<p>My response to the racist charge is:<br>
  &#8220;If being racist means that differences exist in human groups beyond skin color and other superficial characteristics, then yes I am racist. It is ridiculous to assume that populations of humans separated by thousands of miles and exposed to completely different environmental factors over hundreds of thousands of years are not different.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
I am waiting for a cogent response to this retort. Most end up agreeing.</p>

		<p>I think that last thing that blacks and politically correct whites need is for the &#8216;inner racist&rsquo; of infuriated whites to be exposed. Lastly, while people my age (27) and slightly older go along with this garbage, inside we&rsquo;re merely biding our time until the hippies are at our mercy. Then these pampered minorities will lose the gravy train. </p>

<p>The idea that you would sit down and actually think about all of this to create &#8220;sub forms&#8221; of &#8220;racism&#8221; such as &#8220;neo-racism&#8221; or &#8220;democratic racism&#8221; means you just have to much free time.  Pick up a hobby and do something a little more productive with your time.</p>
<p>Additionally, the underlying motive of the &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; movement is exactly what the instructor said - it is an attack against capitalism and Western culture and civilization.  It is rooted in cultural Marxism from the Frankfurt School in Germany in the 1930s.  There is NOTHING beneficial to whites in being &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; or &#8220;Politically Correct.&#8221;  It is an inherently dangerous ideology that has combined class struggle with race struggle and is an ideology that has lead to the deaths of tens of millions of people throughout history.</p>
<p>These people really need to be de-programmed and the &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; exposed for exactly what it really is.    </p>

		<p><i>Another woman described her torment when a friend asked her to give a presentation about media arts to a group of black students &mdash; an exercise that would have made a spectacle of her white privilege. &ldquo;Should I say yes? Or is it my responsibility to say no?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But then [my friend] may say, &lsquo;I want you to do it &mdash; because you have a particular approach&hellip; .&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;But wait! Could it be that the reason I have that &lsquo;particular approach&rsquo; is that I&rsquo;ve been raised to think that I could have that particular approach, that I have the ability, that I am able to access education in a particular way? All these things are in my head, in my heart, not really knowing how to respond. On the other hand, I also recognize that the person asking me has the agency to decide that I&rsquo;m the right person &hellip; so I say yes! &hellip; But then I&rsquo;m still thinking &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I did the right thing.&rsquo; I still struggle with this all the time&hellip; .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sounds like a great way to live.</p>

<p>You know, I was raised in the 70s and 80s and am a link to what Americans used to be, just like many posters here. </p>
<p>When I talk to 20-somethings these days, it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re a different people, not Americans.  </p>
<p>They are almost all very Leftist, very multiculturally inclined, while being the most spoiled and materialistic they can be, even as they wear their birkenstocks as they board the (polluting) plane to go to Africa to teach the tribesmen how to draw water from the ground.</p>
