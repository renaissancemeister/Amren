			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ching-Ching Ni, Los Angeles Times, October 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Once, Albert Huang was the pride of his community, a young mayor and only the second Asian American to serve on San Gabriel&rsquo;s City Council. Now he may well be remembered for fighting with a woman at a dumpling house late at night and for being arrested.</p>
<p>At an emotional news conference in his lawyer&rsquo;s office on Tuesday morning, the 35-year-old Huang, who is also an architect and developer, announced his resignation from the San Gabriel City Council. He said he was tired of the bad press he and his family have been getting since his arrest last Friday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since Huang was released on $100,000 bail Friday after being arrested on suspicion of felony battery, assault and robbery, the Chinese-language media have been abuzz with tales of the alleged altercation and the mystery woman with whom Huang scuffled. Reports have said that she is his girlfriend, that they have bickered in public before and that she runs a foot massage parlor. None of it could be confirmed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He has not been formally charged in Friday&rsquo;s incident. At the news conference, he and his lawyer, Daniel Deng, declined to talk about the fight that allegedly started about 1 a.m. inside a San Gabriel dumpling house and continued on the street, with Huang snatching the woman&rsquo;s purse and driving off as she clung to the side of his SUV.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a private matter that has nothing to do with his capacity as mayor,&#8221; said Deng. &#8220;He wants to prove his innocence in court.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Li [Baogang Li, the owner of the New Taste Dumpling House] was in the kitchen cooking when he heard the sound of a metal steamer basket crashing to the ground. His waiter told him the woman hurled a steamer containing at least three soup dumplings at Huang. He retaliated by pouring a little dish of vinegar on her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard the woman scream, &#8216;Call the police!&rsquo;&#8221; said Li. &#8220;I&rsquo;ve seen couples argue before, so I didn&rsquo;t think we needed to call the cops. If they were on the floor fighting, I would have done something.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked what they thought about the mayor&rsquo;s arrest, some customers at the dumpling house one evening this week seemed surprised.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be unthinkable in China,&#8221; said a college student from Mainland China who would give only his last name, Lin. &#8220;In China, no police would dare arrest a mayor.&#8221;</p>
<p>But this is America. And soon after leaving the restaurant, Huang was nabbed by a security guard from the Red Rose, a karaoke nightclub across the street that is also known as the Turning Point. The guard apparently saw him speed off with a woman clinging to the side of his SUV and gave chase.</p>
<p>According to police, Huang and his female companion fought over her purse. Then he tried to drive off with it, first in her car, then in his. She wouldn&rsquo;t let him go and perched on the running board of his SUV, hanging on as he sped off at 45 mph.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Born into a well-heeled family in Taiwan, Huang immigrated to California at 9. He founded three real estate development, construction and design companies  &mdash;  Richmont Development Corp., R&Y; Construction and Studio R Inc.  &mdash;  before his 25th birthday, according to a company website.</p>

		<p>In china, there is this tradition of men keeping a &#8220;side wife&#8221;.  A sortof out of wedlock girlfriend/prostitute type relationship from a lower class background while the wife is of the same class as the husband.</p>
<p>Often, these women are &#8220;foot massagers&#8221;.</p>
<p>Such relationships are common where there is national socialism, as there is in china.  Supposedly an amalgam of communism with a free market, the reality in china is quite different.  A small racial minority (the Han) controls the communist party&hellip;.making sure that all decisions, especially economic ones, benefit the Han.  They basically enslave everyone else.</p>
<p>The three chinese in this triangle look the same.  But likely the mayor and his wife are Han, while his kept woman is of another race&hellip;..and treated as less than they are.</p>
<p>Certainly, he felt comfortable stealing her property and dragging her down the street at high speed with his car.</p>

<p>I suspect foul play on the part of the mayor.  I&rsquo;ve had this reaction from women, myself.  Considering the actions of the &#8220;mystery girl&#8221; it sounds like a case of &#8220;it&rsquo;s OK to cheat on your wife, but you better not cheat on your girlfriend.&#8221;  Oh well, at least soup dumplings are pretty soft, and they don&rsquo;t do much damage either, except possibly to your career.  </p>

		<p>Note the one comment posted by Alpha W Male about celebrating the extermination of white people.  I doubt the poster was white, but it just shows you how minorities can never be appeased, no matter what the circumstances.  They&rsquo;ll always hate us for we did or didn&rsquo;t do, or what we are doing or not doing.</p>

		<p>&#8220;According to a personal biography he submitted to the city, Huang is married and has a daughter. He works in real estate development and lectures at the USC School of Architecture.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now he can lecture at the school of hard knocks, better known as the slammer.</p>

		<p>Getting into a food fight with your mistress and getting arrested for it when you are a mayor.  What a fool.</p>
<p>The guy is in the US for 5 minutes and he is trying to act like a typical black/white politician already.</p>
<p>At least he had the dignity to resign!</p>

		<p>Poster 1: You mean a mistress? coz white men have them too.</p>
<p>I doubt your knowledge on the topic&hellip; the &#8220;Han&#8221; make up 91% of China&rsquo;s population; they&rsquo;re the majority (by far), and as a result control the Communist Party. The other ethnicities (the Tibetans, Muslims, Zhuang) are given some degree of autonomy (they get to use their own language in school unlike the Cantonese Han) and are given token positions in second-tier government to stifle the whinging. Only, a VERY uninformed person would try and claim that they&rsquo;re an elitist group (though of course they do enslave their minorities to a degree ;) )</p>
<p>FYI: National Socialsim (Nazism) is what they had in Germany under Hitler&hellip;. no such relationships there I take it?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s an illogical rebuttal, because no mention was made that the concept of having mistresses was only among Chinese men.  </p>
<p>&#8220;I doubt your knowledge on the topic&hellip; the &ldquo;Han&rdquo; make up 91% of China&rsquo;s population; they&rsquo;re the majority (by far), and as a result control the Communist Party.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some demographers have maintained that the Han amounts to just 80% of the population, so you might do some fact checking yourself.  And, they are biased and brutal.</p>

<p>Yes, we&rsquo;ve seen and read about all this Chinese &#8220;tolerance&#8221; you want us to believe exists.  And, we&rsquo;re well aware of their abject cruelty to defenseless little animals.  And if you&rsquo;re going to try to clean up the Chinese image with declaring that the Han is not an elitist group, I doubt you&rsquo;ll find many believers of what you write who know of their extreme oppression. </p>
<p>&#8220;FYI: National Socialsim (Nazism) is what they had in Germany under Hitler&hellip;. no such relationships there I take it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;no such relationships there?&#8221;  Why not?  It wasn&rsquo;t standard operating procedure as it is in China, but surely adultry  existed in every political system in the world to some extent, but it is more endemic in China.  </p>
<p>And National Socialism might not be exactly correct in describing China, because it is moving so rapidly toward Fascism, which is merger between the government and private enterprise.  To make a comparison there you would have to use the Mussolini regime as an example.</p>
<p>If you like China so well, why don&rsquo;t you relocate?  </p>

		<p>Anonymous at 6:57 PM, using prostitutes and having mistresses are acceptable for men in East Asian societies not just China. End of Illusion, yes, men in white societies sometimes have affairs but they are not accepted.</p>
<p>Albert Huang has been running scheme after scheme, all illegal but finally got caught by the justice system.  He doesn&rsquo;t have an architect license in California yet is teaching architecture at the University of Southern California.  Law enforcement should look into whether he stole money from the San Gabriel treasury.</p>
<p>Notice how passive-aggressive the East Asian commenters are on the article page.  They take on white or abstract names to cover for being East Asian and harrass the commenters who disagree with them and proclaim how great East Asians are and what failures white people are.  But it&rsquo;s East Asians coming to a white created country and living off of white ingenuity not the other way around. </p>

		<p>&hellip;&#8221;The guard apparently saw him speed off with a woman clinging to the side of his SUV and gave chase.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, when the woman let go, the guard&rsquo;s car ran over her.  He stopped abruptly, threw the auto into reverse and repeated the action.  Then, the guard repeated the whole sequence multiple times until Jackie Chan showed up and threw FOUR dumplins into his vehicle, immediately paralyzing him with hot seasonings.</p>
<p>This is my contribution to the creative writing department of  Amren.  Otherwise, words fail me.  EXCEPT to wonder why we need Chinese immigrants here when they have an economy soaring on our backs and we have such unemployment numbers?  </p>
<p>But they are&rsquo;t acting like blacks, they are acting like Chinese officials who never get arrested for anything short of political treason.</p>

&#8220;That&rsquo;s an illogical rebuttal, because no mention was made that the concept of having mistresses was only among Chinese men. &#8220;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s perfectly logical. If you will look at the post I replied to, the poster does not refer to mistresses, but to what he calls &#8220;side-wives&#8221;, quite clearly implying that these &#8220;side-wives&#8221; are a tradition in China. It seemed quite odd that he would use such a term, and I merely asked (though i didn&rsquo;t expect an answer) as to whether he meant the term &#8220;mistress&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some demographers have maintained that the Han amounts to just 80% of the population, so you might do some fact checking yourself. And, they are biased and brutal.&#8221;</p>
<p>The key word here is SOME. I believe the Chinese census is quite accurate (though you may disagree) and asking around while I was in China myself, I found only a few Uighurs (though admittedly I was in a Han dominated province). 91% is a reasonable estimate and I believe Ihave done my fact checking. Finally saying it might be 80% doesn&rsquo;t make them any less of a majority. The first poster referred to the Han as a &#8220;small racial minority&#8221;, prompting my reply. I doubt either of us agree with that statement, so let us move on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we&rsquo;ve seen and read about all this Chinese &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; you want us to believe exists. And, we&rsquo;re well aware of their abject cruelty to defenseless little animals. And if you&rsquo;re going to try to clean up the Chinese image with declaring that the Han is not an elitist group, I doubt you&rsquo;ll find many believers of what you write who know of their extreme oppression. &#8220;</p>
<p>I confess I should have worded myself a bit better. I meant that the Han were not the elitist group in the sense that they were a small ethnicity controlling the entire nation of China. Rather they form the majority of its population.<br>
As to your comment about their extreme oppression and lack of tolerance, I would like to point out that there is a difference between &#8220;tolerance&#8221; and &#8220;acceptance&#8221;. I would also like to point out that I gave facts to back my statement up. The ethnic minorities ARE allowed to use their own language at school and ARE given token positions in Government. Only the minorities which strive to break away from the Party are oppressed (Uighurs and Tibetans, for record I admire the struggle by the latter). These facts are undeniable. But though the Han show a certain amount of tolerance, they will never accept the minorities. That is something we can both agree on I hope.<br>
Finally, about the animals. I doubt the majority of Chinese are sadistic beings bent on mutilating things. Remember that only 50 years ago, drowning unwanted puppies was perfectly acceptable where I live.</p>
<p>&#8220;And National Socialism might not be exactly correct in describing China, because it is moving so rapidly toward Fascism, which is merger between the government and private enterprise. To make a comparison there you would have to use the Mussolini regime as an example.&#8221;</p>
<p>National Socialism is a branch of fascism, so I don&rsquo;t understand where your coming from. But allow me to say this: History rhymes but rarely repeats. What I think we&rsquo;re seeing here is similar to the situation of South Korea and Taiwan. Industrialisation gave the people wealth (or some wealth). At the $8000 GDP mark, Korea and Taiwan demanded democracy and got it. i believe this will happen in China (currently at $4000 per capita). What after that is anyone&rsquo;s guess.</p>
<p>Finally &#8220;if you like China so well, why don&rsquo;t you relocate&#8221;</p>
<p>So for pointing out some facts, I must remove myself from my country? How one-sided. I visited China, and it was a nice place. But I wouldn&rsquo;t live there if you paid me. The pollution, corruption and materialism is suffocating. I merely pointed out what I saw (and still see) as errors. I hope you agree with me, and even if you don&rsquo;t, may peace be upon you.</p>
