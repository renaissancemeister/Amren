			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brian Bennett, Los Angeles Times, October 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Department of Homeland Security, positioning itself to cut its losses on a so-called invisible fence along the U.S.- Mexico border, has decided not to exercise a one-year option for Boeing to continue work on the troubled multibillion-dollar project involving high-tech cameras, radar and vibration sensors.</p>
<p>The result, after an investment of more than $1 billion, may be a system with only 53 miles of unreliable coverage along the nearly 2,000-mile border.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The government has not released an independent assessment of the program completed in July, but with the two-month Boeing extension about to run out, several members of Congress expect the Homeland Security Department to rule soon on the fate of the invisible fence, the high-tech portion of the $4.4-billion Secure Border Initiative.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But given that the virtual fence has yet to pass muster even in the 53-mile test area  &mdash;  two sections in Arizona that officials acknowledge won&rsquo;t be fully operational until 2013  &mdash;  and the government&rsquo;s lack of interest in extending Boeing&rsquo;s contract, most do not expect the department to invest billions more in a project that has continually disappointed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some of the technology, such as remote cameras, night-vision video and mobile surveillance, is being used by agents in the Arizona test areas, which see a high level of cross-border traffic. But the effectiveness is far from what was requested by Homeland Security officials and promised by Boeing when the project began.</p>
<p>Daytime cameras are able to monitor only half of the distance expected. Ground sensors can identify off-road vehicles, but not humans, as initially envisioned by the government.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Congress was sold on the initiative as a way to combine newfangled gadgetry with old-fashioned fences to secure the entire expanse of the U.S. border with Mexico. Physical fencing has been installed over 600 miles of terrain under the program. But the technological portion, called SBInet, has languished.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Trouble with the invisible fence began in the design phase, when the Homeland Security Department set demands for the technology that surpassed what was available at the time. The department required, for example, that the system help Border Patrol agents be in position to apprehend 90% of the incursions over the border, but the technology has achieved only a fraction of that goal. Citing problems with the program, Napolitano announced in March that she was freezing funding to the initiative outside of Arizona.<br>

		<p>The mainstream media are rightly calling the &#8220;virtual fence&#8221; a failure.  (We all knew it would be a failure five years ago.)  They rightly tell us that a gigabuck was &#8220;wasted.&#8221;  Boeing would call that a feature rather than a bug.  When someone wastes money, someone also makes a lot of money.  A miniature sort of military-industrial complex, if you will.</p>

		<p>Lets see if I get the math right. One Billion is a thousand million. Two thousand miles of border works out to 500K per mile comes to 94.69 dollars per foot. In my area, cinder blocks are about 4 bucks each, which works out to about a 20 foot high fence for 2000 miles. If labor was half the amount, thats still a ten foot fence. Any contractors wanna take on a $95.00/foot fence job?</p>

		<p>Gee Russia  had a 10,000 mile border<br>
that they kept secure for 50 years, not to mention<br>
East Germany, Hungary, Poland, Czechslovakia etc.<br>
all against the will of its citizens. But the USA<br>
with the overwhelming support of its citizens just<br>
cant manage 2400 miles. </p>

		<p>Our fighting military is in the wrong place: South Central Asia. Remove them now. Put them where our nation is invaded. Mostly on the southern border, and sea lanes from the Caribbean. Use all the high tech drones, radar and radiation equipment we use in Asia in the border areas here. Put all the nearly 200,000 troops we have, and all their armor, HUMVEES, and rapid fire artillery and rifles against these invaders.  Plan, plan on tens of thousands of enemy(immigrant and their sanctuaries in Mexico and Haiti) casualties. Post them on You Tube even quicker than the immigrant rights and La Raza type groups can. And announce, &#8220;this is for starters&#8221;. We have small, deliverable bio weapons, tactical nuclear, and other means to vacate hostile urban areas promptly. There are no illegals if there is no population to support them or from which they can breed.</p>
<p>Now we need a Commander In Chief who knows that our nation is under attack, and that it is his job to do it. Roosevelt and Truman didn&rsquo;t hesitate to vaporize millions of civilians to win WWII. And those civilians were not trying to step on US territory and steal our jobs and livelihood. </p>
<p>So whaddya think, Glenn Beck, Hannity, W Bush, McCain, Lieberman,and Michael Steele? Gonna demand US out of Islam land and defend OUR border from Latino/Islamic invasion here at home?</p>

		<p>Yep. This is how D.C. runs the border. If you find this shocking,  then you must be only a few days old. This is just another typical display of the ineptitude of the people we allow to run our lives.</p>
<p>What amazes me is that we have a fully effective system for border security between North and South Korea, but we can&rsquo;t protect our own border. If the problems we are having on our southern border happened on the border that divides the Korean peninsula our tanks would be rolling and our aircraft and artillery would be on alert.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t the government that WE finance keep US as safe as they keep our allies in South Korea?  </p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s another way to spend a billion that I bet would work well: pay 100,000 dollars each to 10,000 highly motivated citizens to secure the border themselves, using any devices or tactics they please.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet we could easily find many good candidates in the ranks of currently unemployed citizens. </p>
<p>Since the program is to be 4.4 billion in cost, 20,000 or 30,000 highly motivated citizens could be paid 100,000 each to defend the border, with the remaining 1.4 to <br>
2.4 billion to be won as 25 to 45 thousand dollar rewards for performance.  </p>
<p>We could call them &#8220;rifle-ready&#8221; jobs.  </p>

		<p>The virtual fence is not a &#8220;failure&#8221;.  It was intended from the outset to be a useless dog &amp; pony show in order to deflect criticism from white voters while still allowing the usual corporate interests and the Democrat party to displace/replace whites in our own country.  The fact that a corporate interest (Boeing) that participates in the legalized bribery of elected officials (euphemistically referred to as &#8220;lobbying&#8221; and &#8220;campaign contributions&#8221;) made a billion dollars on this farce is icing on the cake.</p>
<p>I simply refuse to believe that a corporation that manufactures complicated systems like missiles, airliners and spacecraft is suddenly so hopelessly incompetent when it comes to surveillance equipment that the system is unworkable, unless this was completely by design.<br>

		<p>What we need to do is get our forces out of Korea, Germany, Iraq, Afghanistan, and various other places where we&rsquo;re defending the borders and wasting money and our young soldiers&rsquo; lives and put them along our own borders - both Canadian and Mexican. We need to give them appropriate orders of engagement (for a war zone) and put them in well-armed and well armored HumVees. Put convoys of these HumVees on regular, aggressive patrols along the borders and warn the Mexicans that things will be different now - and mean it! I know, I&rsquo;m dreaming. But we will need to do something like this soon, or we&rsquo;ll have el Kleptocracy del Norte here - very soon. The whole fence idea is a cop out. Any people who are not willing to defend themselves and enforce their own laws will not last. We won&rsquo;t last if we&rsquo;re not willing to defend ourselves - it&rsquo;s that simple.  </p>

		<p>Utter Rubbish.</p>
<p>In the late 1960s, through a program called &#8216;Igloo White&rsquo;, we had the entire HCMT wired for sound (telephone, acoustic, seismic and olfactory) and could detect the difference between trucks and people as much as 500m away, realtime relay that info up to BatCat observation craft up to 20nm away and then rebro the collected data back to a headquarters unit which used two of the Apollo Moonshot computers to collate and triangulate the various sensor tracks.</p>
<p>Think cellphone networking technology with really sensitive headsets, &#8216;speaker down&rsquo; on the ground and you&rsquo;re there.</p>
<p>The one thing we didn&rsquo;t have was a reliable kill effector that could reach through the foliage and the murk that the tristate region of Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam/s presented most of the year.</p>
<p>With the AC-119 and especially AC-130, all that changed.  The first year we got serious between the monsoon seasons, we ended up claiming 12,000 truck kills.  A fact substantiated by the North Vietnamese desperate requests to China and Russia for that number of replacements (that and handcuffing their drivers to the steering wheels).</p>
<p>If we can do that againt a 50,000 man strong military force (and a whole bunch more local tribes people) deployed specifically to stop us by catching the OPS35 roadwatch teams and spoofing the 20,000 or so sensors that were placed or dropped, _we can handle Mexico_.</p>
<p>Beyond which, you folks think way too damn little.  It&rsquo;s not one wall, it&rsquo;s two.  And the reason it&rsquo;s two is because if you have two walls then you have a &#8216;controlled lane&rsquo; which is not against Ottawa MBT (Mine Ban Treaty) which restricts use of non-command detonated mines or leave behinds to those areas where &#8216;civilians&rsquo; are NOT legally going to be found.</p>
<p>Your typical M14 landmine runs about 3 bucks each.  We have over 960,000 of them in use in Korea alone.  Alternately, if you only want to &#8216;stun them&rsquo; you can use what is called a &#8216;gravel mine&rsquo;.  Comes out like bird poop, dries in seconds to an explosive mixture.  We used it all the time in SEA to isolate downed pilots from enemy searchers but couldn&rsquo;t get it to stay active in the wet climate (ACSID and other spike sensors can hear explosions from _miles_ away).  Along the border, this won&rsquo;t be much of a problem and the stuff could be scattered like grass fertilizer.  Won&rsquo;t do more than tear your shoe to pieces or break a few bones on a child&rsquo;s foot but will certainly scare the bejeezus out of someone.  And it will cue up the BP on where to look in seconds.</p>
<p>Back those up with ADS millimeter wave heat guns and directional acoustic systems (20db outside the cone, 170db in it), all tower mounted, about 1,000m behind the fence to discourage would be sappers and amateur EOD.</p>
<p>As someone else has suggested, a good cinder block wall shouldn&rsquo;t be -that- expensive and if you buy two, you should be 50% off.  Fill the middle with death and disaster and then turn off the welfare machine.  Them&rsquo;s as are here will go home.  Those as want to come ahead, _let them_.  Mount their harvested skulls on spikes along the Mexico side of the wall, facing south.</p>
<p>This problem isn&rsquo;t technically insoluble.  It&rsquo;s not even really expensive.  It is being painted that way by idiots and traitors and what I like to call &#8216;failure profiteerists&rsquo;.  Second cousin fellow travellers to the immigrant ennablement industry.  All of whom ought to be lined up against a wall and shot dead.</p>
<p>Illegals wise, somebody needs a trip behind the woodshed for a session with the ugly stick.  And it should not be the United States people who are the designated taxed-to-pay-for-our-own-invasion victims here.</p>

<p>Please remember there is a lot of wildlife that makes the border area their home. Instead of making it even more difficult for them and even mangling them with small explosives we could just crack down on the illegals INSIDE the country and make them decide they don&rsquo;t want to break U.S. law.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about the wildlife, Sonya.  The Korean DMZ is full of land mines, and yet is just about the only place where Korean tigers are found in the wild.  Also living there are Amur leopards and black bears.  Moreover, with two walls a couple miles apart, wildlife outside the mined area would be totally unaffected.<br>
