<h1>MSU Helping Immigrants Navigate the Legal System</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Louise Knott Ahern, Lansing State Journal, October 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Diana Konate doesn&rsquo;t remember much about the year she turned 9, when she and her family left their home in the West African country of Ivory Coast and immigrated to the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That experience is on her mind these days as one of nine law students who are part of a new pro bono legal clinic for immigrants through the Michigan State University College of Law.</p>
<p>The program started in September and already has 30 clients, with cases ranging from deportation disputes to domestic violence complaints.</p>
<p>Students meet with clients twice a week and help them with everything from paperwork to court hearings.</p>
<p>&#8220;{snip} For the most part, our clients are unaware of their rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those rights are the subject of their own debate these days, adding a higher profile to a clinic that is among several others offered through MSU&rsquo;s law school.</p>
<p>A recent poll by EPIC/MRA found that two-thirds of Michigan voters think the state should adopt a law similar to the one passed earlier this year in Arizona.</p>
<p><b>Nationwide debate</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Thronsons fear the Michigan poll reflects a growing anti-immigrant sentiment that makes it harder for even those who are here legally to get a fair shake in the court system.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve made it very difficult in this country to achieve legal status,&#8221; David Thronson [creator of the clinic with his wife, fellow law professor Veronica Tobar Thronson] said.</p>
<p>The clinic takes clients on referral, mostly from social service agencies that are usually the first point of contact for an immigrant in need of legal services.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Resettlement zone</b></p>
<p>Nearly 6 percent of Michigan&rsquo;s population was born in another country.</p>
<p>The Lansing region in particular has a large concentration of immigrants, Thronson said.</p>
<p>The region is a major United Nations resettlement zone for refugees, and MSU itself attracts students and faculty from around the world.</p>

<p>Expressing &#8220;fear&#8221; is a way to cast aspersions on the court system and fellow citizens. It is a subtle and cowardly way to make a broad and unsubstantiated racism allegation against white Michiganites.</p>
<p>It probably doesn&rsquo;t hurt when asking for funding either.<br>

<p>The U. S. takes in three times as many refugees annualy as the rest of the world combined.  Even in a period of high unemployment, we will take in 80,000 refugees in 2010, many from unassimilable cultures such as Somalia.</p>
<p>For ten-minute introduction to this particular federal scam, watch a 2009 presentation by Don Barnett, an authority refugee resettelement with a state department background:<br>

		<p>Another great idea for Michigan; exit the automotive industry, enter the UN resettlement camps.  Who would have thought it, a state in the USA receiving UN aid payments.  </p>

		<p>We were insane to even start this obvious scam upon White nations only! It is just another extension of the 1965 Immigration Act to replace White populations with nonwhite populations. WHERE are WE going to go as refugees from our own homelands? The UN was set up for no other reason than to get ALL White nations to self-destruct. We should be in the streets demanding the USA get out of the UN and the UN&rsquo;s obvious hatred for White people all over the world is well known.</p>

<p>This just makes me sick. </p>
<p>How many Americans even know this?  I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Until recently, I have not been one of those who are strongly anti-UN.  I&rsquo;ve been kind of neutral. But when I read appalling stuff like this, I think they (the UN) have absolutely stepped over the line.</p>
<p>They are colonizing our country! Right under our eyes   &mdash;   and we stand still and allow it.</p>
<p>Enough is enough! Cut off their funds and throw them out.</p>
