			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News, October 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Orange County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office is investigating an incident in which a 13-year-old girl is accused of poisoning members of her family, MyFoxOrlando.com reported.</p>
<p>Investigators said the girl confessed to putting roach and rodent poison, as well as dog feces, in food eaten by her adoptive mother. They also said she placed hand soap in her drinking water.</p>
<p>There is concern that the family&rsquo;s two biological children may also have been poisoned. It is believed that girl&rsquo;s actions began sometime in early 2009 and continued through April of 2010.</p>
<p>The adoptive mother told investigators that recent toxicology tests have shown traces of arsenic in her blood, and for the past year, she has seen her health deteriorate. At this point, she has refused to press charges against the girl.</p>
<p>Neighbors said the family provided love and a home for the girl, whom they adopted from Mexico years back, and even sent her to a private school.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If a charge is brought against the girl, it likely would be for felony poisoning. Because she is adopted, she can not be deported.<br>

		<p>These bleeding hearted do-gooders who bring non-white kids into the country and into their homes are extremely naive and foolish. They must living in a total dream world not to see the  violence, poverty, substance abuse and sexual irresponsibilty that is so widespread in ghettos and barrios. Why on earth would they would want to bring more of that into the country and into their own homes. Whites (especially when they&rsquo;re well to do)who adopt minority kids are usually raging egalitarian leftists that have never heard of books like the Bell Curve or people like Phillippe Rushton. Usually they&rsquo;ll zealously ignore the truth even if it hits them over the head- or in this case poisons them.</p>

		<p>If this is a white family, which I am sure it is, then my revulsion could not be more profound. While there are numerous healthy white children in need of a family, these suicidal white MORONS decided to adopt a non-white whose potential is, statistically in almost every way, QUALITATIVELY inferior to the potential of a white child. Of course, statistics are hardly the most relevant factor, since racial homogeneity is far more important, if only for the fact that it results in a more stable society.</p>
<p>I am appalled at the situation, but I do not feel sympathy for the adoptive family to any extent. Yes, it could very well have been a similar case had the child been white, but it would be far less likely; and this is without taking into consideration the fact that adopting non-white children is unacceptable if one wishes to maintain western civilization and reestablish our white societies.</p>

		<p>This situation is symbolic of the country as a whole.  Massive non-white immigration is poisoning America.  People like the family in question are facilitating this.  We could look at it as bad karma coming back to bite them.</p>

		<p>Talk about paybacks to do-gooder fools.  This one is a real doozy.</p>
<p>Whites who adopt outside their race certainly are beset with some kind of mental affliction.  Michael Savage would say they have a mental disorder, and that would be really difficult to dispute.</p>
<p>Sane, normal people don&rsquo;t have a rabid fixation on acquiring a multicultural family.  But, I&rsquo;m wondering if this mother involved is a type of nut case that does things to screw with people&rsquo;s minds&hellip;.like nurse Ratchet&hellip;because it&rsquo;s possible the Mex kid was driven to do what she did.</p>
<p>This do-gooder bunch is certainly paying the price for their illness.</p>
<p>I wonder if they&rsquo;ll pay for the kid&rsquo;s lawyer.  The state doesn&rsquo;t need the family&rsquo;s permission to file a criminal complaint, especially since they have a confession.</p>

		<p>Absolutely sickening.  How this ungrateful little brat could do something like this for a whole year and not feel any remorse shows her to be a psychopath.  The fact that the government cannot deport her, because she was adopted, makes my blood boil.  If current laws make it impossible, someone should get a petition going, and change the law!  We musn&rsquo;t accept injustices like this, especially from adopted foreigners!!</p>

		<p>This is a great microcism of the West. Bring in third worlder becuse of their desperate need. Love them, feed them, then not acknowledge  when they poison you and your children.<br>
This lady is allowing this child to stay in the same house as her other kids!!!!<br>
Her biological kids need to be removed from the house so that the mexican girl does not kill them all in their sleep at night.</p>

		<p>I`m thinking of one of the most evocative photos I ever saw on this subject. It showed a family at the airport waiting to pick up their new  third world &#8220;addition.&#8221;  The mother was clearly in some kind of emotional fervor or religious trance. The father looked blank, as if he had no opinion or desires of his own to disseminate. <br>
 But it was the two boys, aged thirteen and nine that stunned me. The older one had his arm around his younger brother, with a sad wistful expression on their faces.  They both KNEW, that their world, their family was coming to an end in the next few moments, and things would never again be like they were. I read the older boys protective gesture to be saying that they were still a family, but now only of two. Not four, not five, just his brother and him. Although I felt sory for both of them I could tell in my heart that at least those two still knew what a family was and wasn`t. As for the mother she didn`t have a clue, only a look of selfish smug satisfaction. </p>

		<p>To #6, What these &#8220;parents&#8221; did was not a good deed so please don&rsquo;t make it out to be one. Any one with doubts on this should read post #8.</p>

		<p>&#8221; At this point, she has refused to press charges against the girl.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
In that case, I have no sympathy for this woman.  She is a case beyond help.  Whatever she got, is what she deserved. Some people just never learn!</p>
