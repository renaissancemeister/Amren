<h1>Civil Rights Leaders Condemn Ruling on Use of Word &#8216;Boy&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bill Rankin, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, October 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A black Alabama man claims that his employer, Tyson Foods, discriminated against him by denying him a promotion and that the white plant manager where he worked referred to him as &#8220;boy.&#8221; The man has won two trials and been awarded up to $1.75 million in damages, but the verdicts have both been overturned.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The court said it found no evidence of racial animosity.</p>
<p>A group of 11 civil rights pioneers say that&rsquo;s nonsense. Andrew Young, Joseph Lowery, Fred Shuttlesworth and others have filed a brief saying that there&rsquo;s nothing ambiguous about the use of the word &#8220;boy&#8221; by a white man in reference to a black man. {snip}</p>
<p>The court&rsquo;s reasoning &#8220;does not stand the test of history, experience, reality or the common social understanding of race relations in the country, particularly the South,&#8221; says their motion.<br>

		<p>Not that I want to see it, but cosmic justice will come when there&rsquo;s nothing working at this Tyson plant in AL but Hispanics and Somalians.  Then Andrew Young, Joseph Lowery, Fred Shuttleworth and the eight other &#8220;civil rights pioneers&#8221; can revel in the fact that this man is unemployed, but a man nonetheless.</p>

		<p>Blacks consider the term &#8220;boy&#8221; to be highly derogatory.  That&rsquo;s why they call white men &#8220;white boys.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s meant to be an insult, but most whites seem oblivious to it.  </p>

		<p>It is amusing to see Andrew Young&rsquo;s name associated with this.  He has the loosest lips in the history of language.  When he was mayor of Atlanta (or pretending to be mayor, as he never did anything but run his mouth and run white taxpayers out or town) he said that Walter Mondale&rsquo;s staff was nothing but &#8220;smart ass white boys.&#8221; </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d be willing to put up with a lot worse than being called &#8220;boy&#8221; if I could get paid $1.75 million for it.  All sympathy I might have for someone having to endure some disrespect vanishes when I see the size of the damages they demand for having had their precious little feelings hurt.</p>

<p>Can do you one better.  I was at a mall here in St. Louis on a Sunday late morning about two years ago.  I passed by the Abercrombie &amp; Fitch.  Though I usually do that   &mdash;   Except for a few exceptions you&rsquo;ll read below, I never go into them.</p>
<p>As you know, (or maybe not), A&F; likes to use suggestive photography in its printed catalog, and it uses similar blown-up images in its physical mall locations.  Mainly suggestively naked or nearly naked young white men.  </p>
<p>As I was strolling by, I saw out of the corner of my eye a young black man and a young black woman of about the same age (20s) chatting with each other.  The man was wearing an employee tag; the woman didn&rsquo;t seem like she was.  At the point when I was closest to the conversation, I heard him say these words to her:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m getting tired of working around all these naked @#$ white boys.&#8221;  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing he didn&rsquo;t notice how close I was.</p>
<p>I wrote a complaint snail mail registered letter to A&F;&rsquo;s corporate office.  And I think it worked   &mdash;   I made it my business to enter that A&F; for the next three times I visited that mall, and neither time did I see him working there.  Hopefully, they fired him, but odds are they merely transferred him to another mall&rsquo;s A&F.;</p>

		<p>$10/hour x 2300 hours per year = $23,000 income.  Lets call it $25,000.  $1.75 mm equates to 70 years income.  Although damages like this are tax free so at a 20% tax rate, make it equivalent to 84 years of work.  Call me boy anytime, its great work if you can get it&hellip;<br>
The payout is as if he was grievously injured and could never work again, even home bound.  </p>

		<p>Hey! Now you&rsquo;ve done it! I&rsquo;m from the deep south and I call all men, &#8220;boy.&#8221; It&rsquo;s a term of endearment and not derogatory at all. I&rsquo;m thoroughly fed up with being PC. I think I&rsquo;d like to run out to the nearest corner and yell all the words we aren&rsquo;t supposed to say. Any of you &#8220;boys&#8221; with me?</p>

&#8220;naked @#$ white boys&#8221; is not included but, there again, the list comprises words in the English language, rather than racist street slang.<br>

		<p>Poster number 2,</p>
<p>  You are right!  &#8220;White-boy&#8221; is meant to be an insult.  I have heard it used numerous times against me and friends, and none of us were what you would call &#8220;boys&#8221; nor was the blacks saying this old enough to refer to me as a boy.</p>
<p>Most whites do seem oblivious to this racial insult.  I am sure that the court would not recognize this insult as proof of racial animosity in a hate crime trial, although it does seem to be blacks insult of choice for white men.</p>
<p>More double standards that we, as AMREN readers, know all to well about.</p>

		<p>Blacks need their own country. They will never be happy trying to live alongside we horrible, racist Whites.</p>
<p>It is clear to me that if we could buy happiness for the descendants of sub-Saharan Black slaves who live among us, then the many trillions of dollars that we have already spent on  them would have given each and every one of them a big, toothy grin a long time ago.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t buy for them the things they need to be the true equal of Whites. </p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t buy them a higher IQ, and throwing big wads of cash at the false reasons for their low IQ&rsquo;s will benefit nobody. </p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t buy impulse control for them, and spending tax-payer dollars to fund studies specifically designed to prove that their lack of impulse control is caused by racism will help neither them nor us.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t buy practical decision-making skills for them. No matter how much money we hand to our low-functioning little brothers and sisters, many, if not most of them will still choose personal gratification over parental responsibility every time.</p>
<p>Can we buy them some patience? Yeah. Yeah. Hand over the check now. Right now.</p>
<p>Blacks need their own country.</p>

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t define anyone working in a chicken plant as a boy simply because they are employed.  Employment is one place where boys and men are divided.  Another is dependency.  I expect boys to be dependent on their family until they become men and can contribute back into the family.  Boys are also not allowed to serve in the military and boot camp often separates the men from the boys.  Boys are not expected to provide for their family.  Anyone who becomes a provider has had to do a lot of growing up to even care to be doing it.  It takes a man to care for his family and children.  <br>
 <br>
I don&rsquo;t address any obviously grown male human as a boy.  But I don&rsquo;t always address them as a man either.  I fail to see anything manly in being a freeloader or walking out on your family.  I see nothing manly about being a societal problem.  So calling anyone a man is a serious sign of respect from me and I reserve it for proven cases.<br>

<p><br>
This is exactly correct. Blacks revel in and relish insulting whitey and like to do so at every opportunity. And whitey is more or less oblivious to the insult directed at them. NOT understanding. The same with &#8220;cracker&#8221; too. MOST whitey, at least those living in the north, do not understand the nature of the insult as directed at you when a black addresses you in this way. NOT even sure of what the word means. Whitey a lot of the time is thickheaded!</p>

		<p>   Okay, so when bitter misanthropic feminist hags and implacable minority racists decry the mythical &#8220;old boys&rsquo; club,&#8221; who exactly are they talking about?  We all know the answer.  They refer to the white-privilege network that barely exists anymore, if at all.  <br>
    That being the case, why is it perfectly all right when they employ the same terminology toward accomplished white men?</p>
