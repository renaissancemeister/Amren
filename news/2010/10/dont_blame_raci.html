			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Doughty, Daily Mail (London), October 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Archbishop of York has urged young black people to stop blaming racism for their problems.</p>
<p>Dr John Sentamu warned that prisons, mental health units and young offender institutions held too many black people.</p>
<p>He told a new generation: &#8216;Your future success does not lie in guns, gangs and knives or in the worship of celebrities.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Instead, they should &#8216;work hard&rsquo; and &#8216;stay focused&rsquo;, he said.</p>
<p>The Ugandan-born Archbishop, second in the hierarchy of the Church of England, also criticised African nations for too readily trying to blame their former &#8216;colonial masters&rsquo; for their difficulties.</p>
<p>He pointed to African corruption and lack of democracy and warned that nations were squandering their opportunities.</p>
<p>Dr Sentamu has become a major figure in race relations in Britain over the past decade.</p>
<p>He was a highly influential member of Sir William Macpherson&rsquo;s tribunal that reported into the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence in 1998 and condemned police for &#8216;institutional racism&rsquo;. He also headed the inquiry into the killing of Damilola Taylor on a South London estate.</p>
<p>And he has regularly reminded police forces about the number of times that officers have stopped him and searched him.</p>
<p>Dr Sentamu, who marked Black History Month with his interview, added: &#8216;Today our prisons and mental health units are disproportionately full of men and women from minority ethnic backgrounds.</p>
<p>&#8216;Our young offenders&rsquo; units are full of young black men, many of whom under-achieved at school and thought that the only way out to earning a quick buck was by committing crime.</p>
<p>&#8216;As parents and as a nation we have failed our children.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But he told young people that they should fight prejudice and bias by challenging injustice.</p>
<p>&#8216;Work hard at your education, stay focused and don&rsquo;t sit around waiting for success to be delivered to you on a plate, because it won&rsquo;t be. Don&rsquo;t blame someone else, for you have the energy, potential and creativity so use it for the good of humankind. Don&rsquo;t waste it.</p>
<p>&#8216;Your future success does not lie in guns, gangs and knives or in the worship of celebrities but in the pursuit of study and hard work and in valuing who you are under God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Archbishop said African nations had to cope with trade tariffs loaded in favour of Western countries and multinational companies that plundered resources from failed states.</p>
<p>But he added: &#8216;We cannot lay all the blame of Africa&rsquo;s ills at the feet of Europe and the colonial masters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8216;The high number of African nations that have rewritten their constitutions in order to stay in power indefinitely is staggering.</p>
<p>&#8216;This cannot be healthy for democracy nor for the nation&rsquo;s poor.</p>
<p>&#8216;Europe may have underdeveloped Africa but I believe we&rsquo;ve had the opportunity since to shape our future and destiny and are in danger of squandering these opportunities.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>Fine, then, Dr. Sentamu.  What is to blame?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he really believes his contrite collective introspection, because he himself relies too much on the weasel crutch phrases of &#8220;fighting prejudice&#8221; and &#8220;European tariffs.&#8221;  As if import taxes levied by countries on one continent is supposed to be totally responsible for failure on another continent.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Europe may have underdeveloped Africa&hellip;&#8221;  Another example of black Africans&rsquo; sociopathic nature.  When European explorers came to sub-Sahara Africa the people had no written language, were dressed in loincloth and lived in huts.  There was no development.  ALL development in sub-Sahara Africa is a result of white Europeans.   </p>
<p>&#8220;The high number of African nations that have rewritten their constitutions in order to stay in power indefinitely is staggering.&#8221;  This behavior was always there.  Sociopathic behavior is very high among black Africans.  The difference now is that these black Africans are perpetuating their sociopathic behavior on a white template.<br>
Here is a website which lists sociopathic behavior.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Also says Africa can&rsquo;t blame all its problems on colonialism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, not ALL of them, eh?  But, probably 75% of them, right?</p>
<p>If colonialism did anything at all, it brought civilization to a people too primitive and backward to ever construct the same thing themselves.</p>
<p>But, what have they done with these civilizations the white man turned over to them?</p>
<p>Watch them fall to ruin, of course, just like the farms they took by force and murdered for.</p>

<p>That line was just too funny. Yes, he&rsquo;s a victim of racism, too. But he chooses to rise above it. He&rsquo;s their very own Clarence Thomas, why just as Clarence suffered through so much racism. </p>
<p>There ought to be a name for what is happening, the way the left and the establishment, the press and the school teachers, always update or chronicle the &#8216;oppression&rsquo; up until the very latest hour and second of the day. I think there was a story, from World War Two, about how during Germany&rsquo;s invasion of Russia, German supply trains were still streaming into Russia, such was the surprise.  </p>
<p>Some of us older people occasionally become aware of it. They talk about the old &#8216;racist&rsquo; times that we lived though. Well, for some of those times I was there personally. There was affirmative action then, non-whites men mostly in interracial relations with white women and concern for minorities and only for minorities over and above all else (in other words naked racism and the dehumanisation of whites) and nothing else then, too.</p>

		<p>This clown was a member of the Macpherson report, which followed the London Metropolitan police&rsquo;s investigation of the murder of black teenager, Stephen Lawrence. Its recommendations included the accusation that the police were guilty of &#8220;institutional racism&#8221;. It&rsquo;s effect was to reduce the effectiveness of the Met&rsquo;s policing of certain crimes in Britain.</p>
<p>Sentamu has now sensed that the tide has changed - he&rsquo;s nothing more than an opportunist weather vane.</p>

<p>This just about says it all. Blacks in all western nations are becoming a &#8220;major figure&#8221; in race relations. Why aren&rsquo;t we Whites out here ever a &#8220;major figure&#8221; in race relations?  Amren posters are better qualified and more HONEST than ANY black in the world. At least we wouldn&rsquo;t lie and portray blacks as the eternal victim of ole Whitey all over the world.  </p>

		<p>The good Archbisop is doing the Bill Cosby father figure role, and i&rsquo;m OK with that. Better than JayZ or Lil Wayne as a role model. But, he still has to  refer to the non-existent evils of racism and colonialism, though he incongruously tells the street thugs who have never been in an Anglican church in their lives, to stop excuses.</p>
<p>Ironically, he makes his advice as part of Black History Month. </p>
<p>Really? In Britain? Black History Month? Who knew?</p>
<p>What great part of British History did blacks contribute? Hastings? The Magna Carta? The Armada? Jamestown? Parliamentary Democracy or Locke and Hume&rsquo;s Philosophy? Defeat of Napoleon and Hitler? Inventions in industry and technology? Climbing Mt Everest and creating the music of Elgar, Williams or even the Beatles? Perhaps Shakespeare? (The Moor of Othello actually was not black but Berber). How many blacks or East Asians in Britain know or care about British History, other than the latest pronoucements on diversity, welfare and free education  from the race-obsessed major parties?</p>
<p>The Archbishop&rsquo;s Church is empty. No one attends nor cares, not whites, let alone blacks or Muslims who would harm him very badly, if they could. </p>
<p>I suppose some gays, the highest regarded element of the Church of England, care: up on the altar where many  of them lead the diluted services of this once elegant, ruling class institution.</p>

		<p>To be fair to Dr Sentamu, I think that he is basically a good man.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve disagreed with some of the things he&rsquo;s said, but I understand the difficulties he must face in getting his message past our pseudo-liberal elites and to the ordinary people, white and especially non-white, who need to hear it.</p>
<p>It is quite possible to disagree in detail with Dr Sentamu, but it would be wrong to dismiss him outright. Weighed in the balance, he is a force for good.</p>

<p>As you probably gather, I don&rsquo;t trust Dr Sentamu as much as you do. I do, however, have a lot of respect for the more outspoken former Bishop of Rochester, Dr Michael Nazir-Ali, but he resigned. Some say that Muslim pressure was involved.</p>

		<p>In the interest of free disclosure I must admit that I am a Latino liberal democrat.   That said, I want to comment on the Archbishop of York&rsquo;s remarks in the article stating that &#8220;prisons, mental health units and young offender institutions held too many black people.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Although the Archbishops comments were directed to the black residents of the United Kingdom, I believe that his message is very relevant to African American&rsquo;s and other peopel of color in the United States.  It cannot be denied that institutional racism existed to a great degree in the United States.   Much of that has been eliminated due to legislation passed in the 1960&rsquo;s and the resulting change in social attitudes.   </p>
<p>I happen to believe, however, that still remains a &#8220;I am a victim&#8221; mentality that is still prevalent among some - and I want to again emphasize the word some - members of America&rsquo;s ethnic/racial communities.  I recently assisted a young twenty something African American that recently separated from the US Army.  He is a bright, and motivated young man that wants to do better.  We started talking about something related to job search when he made the comment &#8220;I am a gangster.&#8221;   At first, I was taken aback.  I tried connecting the dots, trying to figure out what the heck does being a gangster have to do with finding a job.  The commment this young man made goes back directly to what the Archbishop was saying when he talked about the adulation of celebrities and outlaws that seems acceptable to members of America&rsquo;s minority communities.   This young man&rsquo;s statement had nothing to do with the acceptance of the gangster&rsquo;s criminal behavior.  It was an acceptance of the branding of celebrities so prevalent in the United States today.  The gangster represented an example of someone achieving against all odds in today&rsquo;s hyper-competitive society.   It was not an acceptance of outlaw behavior so much as the realization that there are people who succeed despite the odds.   There are millions of Americans who are people of color that believe in personal acccountability, getting an education, and creating a positive sense of community.   It is the mass media and brainless advertising that influences our young people.  </p>

		<p>I also wanted to add the while I reject the idea of &#8220;race realism&#8221; I do believe the it is important that we get these ideas out in the open and have an open debate.   We as a society will never make progress if we have these kind of discussions behind closed doors.  I may not accept your ideas or thinking but I will always respect your right to express these views members of the community can critically evaluate the views and opinions expressed.</p>
