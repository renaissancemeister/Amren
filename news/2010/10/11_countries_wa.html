<h1>11 Countries Want to Chime in on Immigration Law</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KNXV-TV (Phoenix), Oct. 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mexico and 10 other Latin American countries want an appeals court to consider their viewpoints in an appeal of a ruling that put parts of Arizona&rsquo;s new immigration law on hold. </p>
<p>The countries are asking the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for permission to file friend-of-the-court briefs in Gov. Jan Brewer&rsquo;s appeal of the ruling. </p>
<p>The 11 countries say they have an interest in ensuring they have reliable relations with the United States that aren&rsquo;t frustrated by Arizona. </p>
<p>Mexico is joined in the request by Argentina, Boliva, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Paraguay and Peru. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not a lawyer so I don&rsquo;t know what the law is regarding this. And I&rsquo;m sure someone will say that I&rsquo;m wrong and its no big deal. But I strongly oppose allowing foreign governments access to our courts.</p>

		<p>They can help by contributing dinero to Arizona&rsquo;s legal defense fund and preparing to receive their citizens back. An apology would also be appreciated. Anything beyond that should be addressed with a resounding NO THANKS!</p>

		<p>Many of these nations would like to maintain open borders.  If AZ breaks rank and stands up for itself then the rest of the states may institute similar laws.  The more voices, the more participation, hence the more confusion.  I say keep AZ sovereign and bring back the Constitution, clean up corrupt Washington.</p>

		<p>Is there any mystery what these briefs will say?</p>
<p>Look at the list of countries wanting to file these briefs. Almost every single one of them are economic basket cases.</p>
<p>These briefs, and all this whining, griping and meddling are about one thing: ensuring that the flow of dollars sent home by their emigrants is not stopped.</p>
<p>Illegal immigration benefits two groups economically: it benefits illegals, and it benefits those who make money off illegals. It certainly does not benefit the white American middle class.</p>

		<p>it is a sign of the country&rsquo;s (ours) softness and stupidity that it is even considered, that other countries would blatantly out-loud advocate for laws that hurt this country&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.<br>

It speaks volumes about Latin American leaders that they want their working age population to leave their countries.</p>
<p>If Latin American leaders don&rsquo;t see their own people as a valuable resource in their own country, why would they be a valuable resource in our country?</p>

		<p>The viewpoint of these third-world countries isn&rsquo;t worth doodley-squat, and should be ignored by the USA. Without our generous foreign aid, many of them would be hopeless crime-and-poverty-ridden narco-states run by ruthless tinpot dictators&hellip;I mean moreso than they already are.</p>

		<p>No, none of these countries should be allowed to have a say. They could give a flying taco less about America. Due to their unchecked immigration and birth rate they are sucking this country dry as it is. But it&rsquo;s good to see that Arizona&rsquo;s 1070 has them this upset. Let us hope the other 49 states follow suit.</p>

		<p>Um, I&rsquo;m sorry.  Since when do non-US countries have a say in how we run our country and who we let in?  Will they be willing to foot the bill for all these illegal, third world criminals we have to deal with?</p>

		<p>Agree with Vick (#11)  <br>
White middle class is taxed to pay for legal system that robbed US. White Americans have been taxed to pay for the illegal &amp; reproduction invasion thru gov transfers&hellip; . . like title 8, food stamps, birth/medical care, ESL,job losses due to EOE/Affirmative action, etc.<br>
Working whites have been forced to relinquish future AND pay for the invasion of our country. Working tax payers have been deceived for UN American purposes.  The enemy within is supported by their countries of origin. Both political parties are committed to One World Chaos.  Be ready.    V</p>
