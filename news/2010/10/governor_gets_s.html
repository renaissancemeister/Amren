<h1>Governor Gets Setback in Fighting Mexico&rsquo;s Entry Into Lawsuit</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Howard Fischer, The Herald (Sierra Vista), October 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Federal appellate judges won&rsquo;t listen to arguments by Jan Brewer about why they should ignore the views of the Mexican government on the legality of the state&rsquo;s new immigration law.</p>
<p>In a one-sentence order, judges of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals refused to accept the legal briefs the governor filed through her attorney seeking to undermine arguments by Mexico that judges should not disturb a lower court order blocking the state from enforcing key provisions of Senate Bill 1070. The judges gave no reason for their decision.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 9th Circuit has allowed various groups on both sides of the issue to file &#8220;friend of the court&#8221; briefs as it weighs a plea by Brewer to set aside the injunction issued in July by U.S. District Court Judge Susan Bolton. The Mexican government, in its brief, said allowing Arizona to enforce immigration laws interferes with international relations and undermines the rights of its citizens, legal and otherwise, in the U.S.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Brewer submitted a response urging the appellate judges to disregard those arguments. She said Mexico&rsquo;s real interest is &#8220;lax enforcement of United States immigration laws and ultimate amnesty for all of the Mexican nationals who are unlawfully present in the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new court order means the judges hearing the case next month will have the Mexican legal brief  &mdash;  but not the one countering it from Brewer.</p>

<p>The 9th Circuit Cour of Appeals is not a legitimate court.  They amount to no more than a far left advocacy group whose intent is to create law by rendering assinine, biased decisions that favor the leftist ideology.</p>
<p>They sould be disbanded as a legitimate judicial branch.</p>
<p>Remember when the far left Democrats refused to accept Robert Borke to SCOTUS?  They did exactly the same thing to other conservative candidates.  The Republicans, however, refuse to act as the same kind of blocking agents as the Democrats so consequently we have an abundance of leftist radicals on the bench that are no more, no less, than criminals.</p>
<p>Hard right judges tend to just administer to the law without morphing into political activist, mostly.</p>
<p>But the situation is not worth correcting, because this country is too far gone to ever be set straight.  The right person to correct things would never get elected, so the best thing for us is just what is occurring right this minute, which is economic collapse and break up.</p>
<p>Fix the 9th Court and it would do not good in improving the overall situation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to say goodbye and good riddance to this sinking empire.</p>

		<p>If the courts do not play fair, they undermine their own credibility = collapse of the judicial system.  For years, the judicial system has been against the average man but yet his money supports them.  There is plan to ruin this country, Western civilization.  The masses will be forced to live in third world conditions while a few live in luxury which includes this country.  It is all about greed and power.</p>

		<p>So, the judges for the 9th Circus Court of Appeals will accept the Mexican legal brief but not one countering it from one of America&rsquo;s own Governors. Makes you kind of wonder who&rsquo;s getting paid off or threatened, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s truly nothing left under obama&rsquo;s admin. that surprises me. Strap in, people. We are in for a bumpy two years. And they can&rsquo;t go fast enough. And we have to vote this clown out.<br>

		<p>Those of you who have not been to court as a defendant in a substantial civil trial have no idea how corrupt and hopeless the situation really is. </p>
<p>Do you remember the Korean family that had to spend $300,000 defending their life&rsquo;s honest work against the system that sought a $60 million judgment for them having misplaced a pair of slacks for one week?  The actual crime they committed was to have placed a sign in the front window of their cleaners that stated &#8220;Satisfaction Guaranteed&#8221;.  The customer was not satisfied and wanted $60 million dollars because of it.  </p>
<p>The *case* drug on for five years before trial.  The Koreans *won* at trial but the plaintiff appealed.</p>
<p>Please note:  the lawyers and judges were *white*.</p>
<p>No matter how innocent you might be the judge will order you around as if you are a captured enemy soldier.  Your lawyer did not go to school nor get up this morning to help anyone but himself.  </p>
<p>Those of you who have not been to court as a defendant in a substantial civil trial have no idea how corrupt and hopeless the situation really is. Every move the court makes is designed to take money from you and divide it amongst the officers of the court.</p>

		<p>NULLIFICATION!!!  It is high time the states refuse to acknowledge ANY decisions by unelected judges.  We in the Southern Independence movement have been waiting for the first state to say &#8220;ENOUGH&#8221; and submit articles of secession and break away from the American Empire and come together in confederations with like-minded states.</p>
