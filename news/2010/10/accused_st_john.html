<h1>Accused St. John&rsquo;s Embezzler Allegedly Used Students As Slaves</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Janon Fisher, New York Post, September 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Disgraced St. John&rsquo;s University dean, Cecilia Chang, who was charged earlier this month with embezzling over $1 million in donations from the college, was nabbed again today by the FBI and accused using scholarship students as domestic servants.</p>
<p>Chang, 57, allegedly forced students to do her laundry, clean her house, cook and chauffeur her son around.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chang threatened the students and placed them in fear that if they refused to perform these personal services they would lose their scholarships and be unable to attend St. John&rsquo;s,&#8221; FBI Special Agent Kenneth Hosey wrote in the arrest warrant.</p>
<p>Chang had four students working seven days a week as her personal valets, one was forced to driver her son to the airport at 3 a.m. Others shoveled snow, took out the garbage and shuttled her to her hair salon, according to court papers.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Chang] let me be the housekeeper for her house and give me scholarship,&#8221; one scholarship student wrote to the college. &#8220;We have three housekeeper before, and she ask us work 122 days per year per person.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another student had to courier cash down to Chang when she was on a gambling jaunt in Atlantic City, the feds allege.</p>
<p>One student was told to doctor the college administrator&rsquo;s credit card statements for personal expenses so that she could submit them for reimbursement.</p>

     With grammar like that, maybe they should be cleaning houses instead of going to a university.</p>

		<p>This is quite interesting. One does not  have to live in China long to understand her &#8220;Asian&#8221; thinking and her mindset towards those who are under her power. Very typical thinking: Power rules, power dictates your position, lack of power means you server those in power. Those who protect and contribute to your future, you owe obedience. No rule of law, no sense of fairness, no goodness. The law of power.</p>

		<p>Not a single article I have read about this story, and I have read several, tells us anything about the students.  Were they foreign nationals here on some sort of legal immigrant student visa?  They would have to be, in order to feel &#8220;obligated&#8221; to this &#8220;slave master.&#8221;  </p>

<p>And here it&rsquo;s common knowledge that nobody in the world is as cruel, crooked, and hard as whitey, now or in the past.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m remembering Chinese history correctly, I believe it is credible information that for every foot of the Great Wall that was constructed by harsh taskmasters, 5 Chinese worklers died of stress and disease brought on by overworking them mercilessly.</p>

		<p>East Asian&rsquo;s criminal activity tends to be about undermining and abusing systems.  East Asian Cecilia Chang undermined the system of donations by stealing money and abused the student body by using them as her own pool of servants.  It took authorities until Cecilia Chang stole over $1 million before they caught her.  You can imagine how much criminal activity is going on with East Asians in America right now because the criminal activity East Asians tend to do is difficult to detect.</p>

		<p>Having worked with Chinese managers, I am not the least bit surprised.</p>
<p>They have a cultural, and possibly racial, predisposition towards deference to absolute authority.  They promise subordinates one thing, and then expect much more.  </p>
<p>This is one of the fundamental differences between them and whites. In my capacity, I had to come between Chinese managers who attempted to treat white contract workers in the same abusive manner they treated their own people.</p>
<p>Whites don&rsquo;t kowtow or bow. We know our worth.</p>

		<p>A 205-count indictment from the local DA, and since the FBI&rsquo;s interested as well, Chang could be facing federal charges.  This gal&rsquo;s done; stick a fork in her.</p>
<p>One bit of puzzlement from the article is that it says a student was forced to chauffeur Chang to have her hair done.  From the picture I saw of Chang&rsquo;s face, no amount of hair salon work could transform her into anything other than a gargoyle-wannabe.  Thank GOD, though for St. John&rsquo;s committment to diversity in hiring.  Think of it; instead of this corrupt, ugly dragon-lady, they could have had a (gasp) white male as dean.</p>

The article speaks for itself.<br>
The puzzling question is how and why did St. Johns University<br>
elect Chang to be Dean?<br>
Judging by Chang&rsquo;s actions, it is understandable to see how<br>
Chinese are subverted and tortured at the hands of other Chinese in positions of power.<br>
The opportunistic profile of Cecilia Chang is indicative of tens of thousands of Chinese immigrants in the U.S. and countries around the globe.<br>

<p>A St. John&rsquo;s University sophomore who got a scholarship through disgraced ex-dean Cecilia Chang said students feared they would lose their award if they didn&rsquo;t do chores for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need the scholarship, we don&rsquo;t have any choice,&#8221; Ziyan Wang told the Daily News Friday.<br>

<p>Part of the reason may be that although St Johns is a traditional Catholic University it is situated in Queens New York. The borough of Queens has undergone a rigorous transformation the last twenty five years demographically. Asians are a dominant population centered around Flushing. By the way, there was a story on AMREN earlier about Queens stating that whites now have less wealth than even blacks.</p>

		<p>If you want to know about a certain race of people, observe how they treat their helpless animals.  Those that are vicious and cruel, like many Chinese, are apt to extend that trait to other living things, like humans, as this story indicates.</p>
<p>If they have an abundance of dogs running freely, and they beat them evilly and viciously in the heads with clubs until they&rsquo;re dead to save the cost of a bullet or drugs for euthanasia, as the Chinese do, then, to any thinking person, it reveals a people with a hard core of barbarism in their souls that could easily extend to people in many cases.  Their animal cruelty atrocities would be too long to list here.</p>
<p>However, to be fair, this country, far more humane, is still no shining example of humanity, since the people allow the killing of lambs, calves and other baby creatures, and the barbaric practice of ritual slaughter, mostly in the name of religion.</p>
<p>The cost for round up and euthanasia far exceeds the cost of providing spay and neuter clinics, and funds to private practices, but the people choose to ignore the cruelty and injustice of it all, so nothing is ever improved. </p>
<p>So, while the evidence proves unequivocally that most Chinese are cruel barbarians toward their little animals, there is an abundance of evidence that the cruelty here in this country is just another extension of the ignorance and apathy of its people.</p>
<p>Americans have a long way to go to reach civility, but the Chinese are so distant from it, they don&rsquo;t deserve anything but outright condemnation and severe punishment if the opportunity is ever presented.</p>
<p>Multicultural societies always tend to draw the worst of humanity to its shores.</p>
