		<p>Speaking of social security&hellip;.It was this issue in a roundabout way that introduced me to the concept of anarcho tryanny,i.e. Letting women with full veils go thru security while refusing boarding to people whose spelling names dont exactly match their boarding pass.<br>
 In my own case I was standing in line at the DMV. The man in front of me had no documents whatsoever to prove identity or  citizenship. So they had him sign a form declaring he had no social security card etc. Then at my turn, the woman told me to go home and get my card to prove it matched their database. &#8220;Why do I have to step out of line  and go back home to verify documents you already have on file when the guy before me doesn`t even need them?!?&#8221;, I blurted out. In response a DPS trooper came around the counter to add his wieght to the discussion. Made me quit laughing about all those change my name to Juan Estaban jokes and stories I used to find amusing&hellip;</p>

		<p>Abortion and frankly gay rights(so-called) are not important issues.  They should be in the area of privacy, and certainly anyone like the candidate in NY who criticized the gay lifestyle should be  able to do so without being called a Nazi or worse.</p>
<p>But immigration and federal power are critical to the preservation of what&rsquo;s left of Western culture in this nation. Sharron Angle, regardless of what else she says, seems to get that immigration is not a civil rights issue, is now if not 100 yrs ago is a threat to the American tradition, and that the Federal govt is not wonderful. Harry Reid never met a federal law or regulation he didn&rsquo;t love.</p>

		<p>NumbersUSA is the big citizens-lobby credited   &mdash;    &mdash;   along with FAIR (Federation for American Immigration Reform)   &mdash;  - with stopping the two big Bush-McCain-Democrat amnesty pushes in 2006 and 2007. </p>
<p>NumbersUSA keeps detailed &#8220;Immigration Report Cards&#8221; on all members of Congress. Here is the overall report card for the Nevada delegation:<br>

<p>Senator Reid&rsquo;s &#8220;F-&#8221; indicates a rare level of dedication to open borders and illegal immigration. Sharron Angle&rsquo;s TV commercial is accurate. For the details on Reid&rsquo;s immigration voting record, click on his name.</p>

		<p>This is a Tea Party casndidate.  They&rsquo;re backing ideology and not party, something most of us have wanted for a long time.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve deteriorated so greatly up to this point I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;re beyond repaid.</p>
<p>As long as so many brainwashed gullibles in this country celebrate the divisiveness of diversity, there&rsquo;s no chance for  survival.</p>
<p>Diversity has caused this present economic debacle, and it will continue to bring us to complete ruin.</p>

		<p>Good ad. I noticed near the end they show two hispanics in hardhats to symbolize &#8220;taxpayers&#8221;.</p>
<p>This is an attempt to defuse charges of &#8216;racism&rsquo; by liberal bedwetters. It won&rsquo;t work.</p>

		<p>I emailed my Congressman when I saw the notice on SS yesterday. I asked specifically if illegal aliens would still be rewarded while programs for Americans were being cut. I had a return email - a form letter, I&rsquo;m sure - that told of all the wonderful things the politician had done, but neglected to mention the main thrust of my letter at all. It&rsquo;s a hopeless case. None of the Washington elite will mention this hot topic. In the meantime, we get shafted and the illegals continue to prosper. I look back on my work years and all I see is a lawbreakers reaping the benefits. What a country!</p>

		<p>Politicians don&rsquo;t do anything without a profit motive.  Therein lies the corruption, not any form of misguided altruism.</p>
<p>So start by paying Congress what it&rsquo;s worth -as a job requiring extreme fidelity to national over state or private interest loyalties-.  Four to Six million dollars a year with 2-3 term limits seems fair to me and certainly is comparible to what we pay movie stars and athletes.</p>
<p>Next, make it illegal for lawmakers to vote on amendments which directly effect their states.  Or to take any kind of reward from big business or special interests involved with those votes.  Before, during or after their period in office.</p>
<p>Make all campaigns solely federally funded on a minimum and equal level with 3-5 fixed debates on a platform list of topics considered important to the nation by the candidates themselves (i.e. you don&rsquo;t have to choose the same issues but you had best be prepared to attack or defend the other guy&rsquo;s talking points).</p>
<p>Finally, make sure that we can gain _right to fire_ impeachment privileges for anyone who votes against their stated campaign positions, based on a yearly rating of these &#8216;voting grade-scores&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Anyone can fling dirt.  Even if it sticks, deservedly, to its intended target, blanket criticism does nothing to validate why X&rsquo;s position is wrong or how Y will act differently to better the situation.</p>
