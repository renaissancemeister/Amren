<p>Pork soup perhaps? NO! Seriously, I doubt many Muslim immigrants or their offspring even care one whit to sample the diet of whitey, even if halal!</p>
<p>You are doing them a big favor [flavor] and they are for the most part not even interested.</p>
<p>Chicken soup anyone?</p>

		<p>Amazing.  How far is this going to go?  When will it be coming to the US?</p>
<p>I remember, several years back (or more), when Cambells came out with Casera soups, the answer to Hispanic homestyle cooking.</p>
<p>Strange, come to think of it, I had forgotten all about them. I haven&rsquo;t seen those soups in some while now.</p>
<p>I guess Hispanic housewives who wanted home-cooked soup, cooked their soup at home. Wouldn&rsquo;t it figure?</p>

		<p>So where are the tree hugger groups complaining about tortured animals?  Seriously, there should be a national boycott on foods made from intentionally tortured animals.  I&rsquo;m amazed as I watch formerly powerful liberal groups getting ground to dust under diversity of all things!<br>

		<p>Halal split pea with ham or halal bean with bacon, anyone?</p>
<p>Halal slaughter isn&rsquo;t really torture per se, but it seems a bit on the cruel side, as the animal&rsquo;s throat is slashed and the animal is then allowed to bleed out.  Severing the spine is NOT allowed.  On the other hand, the usual US method of slaughtering cattle isn&rsquo;t really optimal, either.  A steel bolt is shot through the animal&rsquo;s brain.  Since the heart is still beating, this is an ideal way to distribute brain tissue throughout the animal, which can help with the spread of prion diseases like Kreutzfeldt-Jakob ( a.k.a. &#8220;mad cow&#8221;).  The pressure-washing of meat off the animals&rsquo; spines also guarantees the introduction of nerve tissue into meat marketed as &#8220;hamburger&#8221; meat.  (As an aside, I refuse to purchase anything marked &#8220;ground beef&#8221; or &#8220;hamburger&#8221;.  When I cook burgers, I use meat ground from a specific cut, like chuck or flank.  There isn&rsquo;t much nerve tissue in these cuts.)  When it comes to livestock slaughter, there aren&rsquo;t really any perfect answers, which I suppose is why some people decide to become vegetarians.  This halal craze only annoys me because I recognise it for what it really is: Corporate pandering to colonists, alien occupiers who have no intention of assimilating and who expect to be able to impose dhimmitude on us in our own countries.  Note that while these corporations act as voluntary enablers in this respect, they still expect us to purchase their products.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t care about which slaughterhouse they get the meat from, as long as it tastes the same and is high quality.</p>
<p>What concerns me more is all the Spanish labels I see on &#8216;regular&rsquo; products on the store shelves now.  I am amazed to no end!</p>

		<p>The CEO of Campbell&rsquo;s Soup company is part of the ruling class elite.<br>
Modern food corporations are often behind campaigns which work against America&rsquo;s interest.<br>
The documentary film Food Inc. details the scams perpetrated on American&rsquo;s by these corporate giants and how they undermine American&rsquo;s politcally.</p>

		<p> Catering to immigrant minorities is expensive. Expect to pay more money for your Campbell&rsquo;s tomato soup. Obviously, there are more Muslims in Canada than the privileged elites want the average white Canadian to know.</p>
