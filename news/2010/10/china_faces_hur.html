			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chi-Chi-Zhang, Seattle Times, October 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It&rsquo;s Nobel season, and China is engaged in an annual bout of hand-wringing: Why can&rsquo;t the country that invented the compass and gunpowder  &mdash;  and that recently rocketed from poverty to global power  &mdash;  win one of the venerated prizes?</p>
<p>As Nobels went this week to British, Russian, American and Japanese scientists, Chinese media paired special reports on the winners with expert debates on why China came up short again.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More than another milestone, a Nobel would be proof that China is retaking what many Chinese see as its rightful place as one of the world&rsquo;s leading civilizations. For much of the past century, science assumed religious-like proportions in the minds of China&rsquo;s elite, admired as a key to resurrecting a country that had fallen behind the West.</p>
<p>{snip} &#8220;Only with accolades such as the Olympics and winning a Nobel Prize will China feel it can convince the world it has moved from the periphery to the center.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nine ethnic Chinese have previously won Nobel Prizes, including Yang in 1957 for his work on subatomic particles. But none of them are Chinese nationals, and, with one exception, their groundbreaking work was done outside China, reinforcing a sense of failure among many Chinese.</p>
<p>The government has disowned other Nobels associated with China. It excoriated the awarding of the Peace Prize in 1989 to the Dalai Lama, the exiled leader of China-controlled Tibet. It disavowed author Gao Xingjian, who left China for France in the 1980s to escape censorship, when he won the Literature Prize in 2000. This year it has pressured the Norwegian Nobel Committee to try to dissuade it from giving the Peace Prize to imprisoned democracy campaigner Liu Xiaobo.</p>
<p>Yet winning a Nobel has been an avowed goal and the lack of one, especially in science, gnaws at an increasingly confident China.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s biggest hurdle is a science and academic structure that is hampered by plagiarism, bureaucracy and a traditional deference to authority.</p>
<p>While science Nobels often are awarded for work done in a laureate&rsquo;s 30s or 40s, China&rsquo;s seniority-based hierarchy requires scientists to wait until late in their career to direct major research, said Cao, the State University of New York researcher.</p>
<p>Promising figures often are plucked from the laboratory and promoted to leadership posts in government, ending hands-on research. China&rsquo;s leading respiratory expert, Zhong Nanshan, was credited with helping to identify and then stem the SARS pneumonia outbreak in 2003. He was promoted and now juggles a half-dozen administrative roles, serving as the head or a leading member of many medical associations and research bodies.</p>
<p>Plagiarism has flourished at Chinese universities as researchers face greater pressure to publish to secure promotions. In December, two scholars were dismissed from their lecturer posts after their published papers in an international chemistry journal where found to be fraudulent.</p>

		<p>I can answer your question for you very easily, China.  The problem here is your ego.</p>
<p>While you have been a great civilization for most of history, when it comes to the topic of science, you have produced very little compared to the West.  It is time for China to deflate its ego, and it is time for white people in the West to stop kissing China&rsquo;s backside.</p>
<p>China has some nerve claiming that &#8220;the West now sits in China&rsquo;s rightful place&#8221; (even if this article doesn&rsquo;t claim this attitude directly, I have definately heard it and read about it elsewhere).</p>
<p>Just what is this rightful place of your&rsquo;s China?  Should you be at the top of the Space Race?  Sorry, but most of the science behind the Space Race was developed in the West. Should you be on top of the world in the Olympics year after year?  Sorry, China, but not only was the Olympics developed in the West, but most of the technology needed to put on your &#8220;spectacular&#8221; opening ceremony came from the West too.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I agree that China is among the great civilizations in world history, but if they think they should be up here with Western nations in the area of winning Nobel Prizes, then they have a lot of catching up to do.  Inventing the compass and gunpowder hardly means that you have developed most of the world&rsquo;s science and technology in all of history.</p>
<p>In the mean time, it is time for the West to start focusing on its own great past instead of constantly trying to boost this Asian country up in its place.  Wake up white people.</p>

		<p>For an eye-opener on this important subject, I urge fellow Amrenners to read a front-page article in today&rsquo;s New York Times entitled &#8220;Rampant Fraud Threat to China&rsquo;s Brisk Ascent&#8221;.  </p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/2ay8z64" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2ay8z64</a> </p>
<p>I have often wondered why even though Asians have a higher average IQ than Europeans, they seem to be lamentably deficient in creative thinking. </p>
<p>The NYT provides, in part, an answer to this Big question. </p>
<p>To quote one of the article&rsquo;s interviewees, when it comes to the widespread practice among Orientals to plagiarize and cheat : </p>
<p> &ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s a cultural difference but there is nothing bad or embarrassing about it&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>I would posit that yes, cheating among Asians is a cultural thing, but beneath that, and more importantly, it is a genetic thing. </p>
<p>Culture is a biological determination. </p>

		<p>And I thought the Chinese are smarter than this.  What&rsquo;s the point of trying to be number one.  Britain was once the top dog.  Look at it now.  On its way to becoming a third world garbage dump.  The US is currently on top, but we&rsquo;re paying a price for that.  You can&rsquo;t stay on top forever.  And what goes up must come down.  China might not be the best now, but at least they don&rsquo;t have the blacks leeching off of them.  Nor do they have the parasites who are the real ones in power!  Oy Vey!!!</p>
<p>They should focus on maintaining their civilization for another 5000 years.  Now what would be an accomplishment.</p>

<p>I think the need is greater for the latter rather than the former. Google &#8220;China developing country&#8221; and you&rsquo;ll find the state propganda publications lamenting how poor the country still is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also interesting to note that on average, all the Nobel prizes other than peace have a large gap (in the order of 20-30 years) between the discovery and awarding of the prize itself. For a country that only started offering free secondary education thise year, I&rsquo;d wait to see if China can match Japan.</p>

		<p>China did not invent the compass. They had a weird little device that always pointed north, but they didn&rsquo;t know what the heck it was. To them it was an oddity possesssed by spirits. It took Europeans to discover what it could do. </p>
<p>China did not invent gunpowder. It appeared in Europe at about the same time as China. The Chinese used it to make firecrackers. Europeans used it to invent firepower and then conquered the world with it. See Kemp&rsquo;s excellent March of the Titans online for free for further information.</p>
<p>Chinese are not innovators, they are only copy copy copiers. The reason for this is the Bell Curve, or racial IQ. The Chinese Bell Curve is steep on either side of the median, meaning idiots and super geniuses are non-existent. White IQ on the other hand is gently sloped around the mean, meaning we have more idiots but also more super-geniuses, to whom we owe our innovation. Nature made this so, and the Chinese will never be innovators, like the White Race, just copy-copy-copiers. Sorry China.   </p>

		<p>Arturo de Gheaube, people of European descent have higher average IQs than East Asians when IQ tests are properly normed to give the verbal sections their full weight.  </p>
<p>I hope the Nobel prize doesn&rsquo;t become like architecture prizes where they give awards to non-white architects just for variety.  Every couple years they toss an award to a Japanese architect for their Mies van der Rohe-rehash modernist architecture.</p>
<p>The article makes a very important point; East Asian accomplishments in white settings.  Pretty much all the East Asian Nobel Prize winners worked and lived in white institutions and white places.  White people created the environment in which creativity flourished.  Being pushed out of higher learning opportunities by non-white people is another reason to be against immigration.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m skeptical of many Chinese invention claims.  Many of them are based on opaque, brief text without any physical evidence from the time of there supposed creations and for hundreds of years afterward like the compass.  There are no drawings or physical evidence of a compass in China for 1200+ years from the time they say it was invented.  You often hear from those advocating these Chinese invention claims that the Chinese didn&rsquo;t use whatever they invented much and/or that the inventions were lost.</p>

<p>Huh? Have you seen the list of chemistry and physics Nobel Prize winners since 2000? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_laureates" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_laureates</a> It&rsquo;s clear the Asians are coming on strong. It&rsquo;s too bad US white boys are too lazy to put the hours in to study chemistry and physics. Real American born US winners are now dropping off as compared to 1980-1999. </p>

		<p>Mark my words:</p>
<p>China, as we know it, will not survive the coming global economic collapse (if said collapse occurs).</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t believe that people don&rsquo;t see the glaringly simple reason.<br>
Let me put it this way:</p>
<p>If you owe somebody a hundred dollars, YOU have a problem. If you owe somebody a million dollars, THEY have a problem.  A BIG problem.</p>
<p>We owe China trillions. If we default, the Chinese paper tiger folds, hard and blindingly fast. Plus, with no American (or Western dollars) flooding in to fuel crappy manufacturing, and with no American market to flood with said cheap junk, China won&rsquo;t even have a place in the world anymore. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dank backwater as it is, outside the slave factories and glitzy potempkin-style cities&hellip;it is poisoning itself like you couldn&rsquo;t imagine with toxic metals, smoke, trash, etc. </p>
<p>It cannot survive, and it&rsquo;s people have not the individual will so save it&hellip;they had little to do with the behemoth state in the first place.</p>

<p>&#8220;developed most of the world&rsquo;s science and technology in all of history&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a misleading statement. Anyone familiar with the history of technology knows that the rate of technological advance is exponential. This means that there has been more new technology in the last 200 years than in the 2000 years before that, and in the last 2000 years than in the 20000 years before that, and so on. In other words, whoever is the most RECENT leader in technology will also, automatically, be the leader in total technology developed. This does not imply a CONSISTENT lead in technology throughout the historical ages.</p>

		<p>China is indeed a great civilization in many ways, but producing creative, innovative minds that have propelled civilization forward is not one of its strong points. What is one thing China has invented in the last 200 years? One world-renowned writer, one composer, one CEO of a world class company, educated in mainland China? </p>
<p>Where are the Carnegies, Fords, JP Morgans, Porsches, Marconis etc? From the Chinese themselves one only seems to get a lot of excuses, typically in the form of whining about how little tiny England managed to wipe the mat with their &#8220;highly civilized, highly advanced&#8221; culture left, right, and center. But look at the French, just as one example. The French revolution created chaos but within 20 years Napoleon was conquering Europe. The French didn&rsquo;t give up and sit complaining wringing their hands about how their country was destroyed for the next two centuries. </p>
<p>None of that is to say the Chinese are not smart, but rather the way their system runs is that thinking outside the box is not a desirable skill. And to change that will take quite some time yet, if not forever.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s give credit where credit is due  &mdash;  in this case the invention of gunpowder.</p>
<p>According to March of the Titans,  Chapter 58: Shaping the World: The White Technological Revolution, Part One: Early Inventions and Firearms:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The first written reference to gunpowder - and how to make it - appears in the writings of the 13th century English monk Roger Bacon, belying the oft held theory that it was developed in China and exported to Europe. In fact, the Chinese has what they called &#8216;fire powder&rsquo; - an inflammable chemical which they used in bamboo tubes to make clay pellet firing &#8216;rockets.&#8221;</p>
<p>A 14th Century German monk, Berthold Schwarz, was the first person to use gunpowder to fire a substantial projectile&hellip; Schwarz was preparing gunpowder in a closed vessel called an apothecary&rsquo;s mortar when the mixture ignited and blew the pestle from the mortar. The use of &#8216;mortar&rsquo; for a type of ordnance commemorates this occasion&hellip;&#8221;</p>

		<p>An important element of the political orientation of China<br>
is the posture re IQ testing and The London School (the tradition of Galton, Pearson, Spearman, Burt, Eysenck, Lynn,Brand,Jensen et al.).  I have first-hand awareness of a keen semi-official endorsement of The London School at Beijing Normal University circa 1984-89.  A manifestation is a 1985 letter to me from the Vice President of the Chinese Psychological Society expressing keen admiration for the primer importance of Jensen&rsquo;s STRAIGHT TALK ABOUT MENTAL ABILITIES as being &#8220;exactly what we need&#8221; (for translation and dissemination among fledgling academic psychology programs in the PRC.) What irony!  It remains not unlikely that the PRC may be the first society post WW II that explicitly applies the findings of Jensen, R B Cattell, Burt, Spearman, to the enlightened national security of the nation.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s the big deal with a Nobel prize? Just like many other awards it has been reduced to insignificance, due to the recipients thereof. To name a few I can think of, Al Gore, B. Hussein Obama, and one of my all time favorite peace lovers, Adolph Hitler. To be included in this hierarchy is not an honor. Those who determine the recipients are just as are most other things in this day and age, educated idiot, radical leftists.</p>

		<p>I really don&rsquo;t understand why, whenever discussions like this come about on this website, there is always this handful of white posters who feel the need to lecture all of us about China&rsquo;s &#8220;superiority&#8221;.</p>
<p>Wake up!  Here in the West we now have anti-white revisionism taking over every institution and reeducating white people on how &#8220;most if not all of our past accomplishments were really the work of other races&#8221;.</p>
<p>Nobody on here is saying the Chinese are NOT smart or that they DO NOT create great civilizations.  Nobody is claiming that.  However, it can NOT be proven wrong that white people in history disproportionately (like by 90% to 10% ratios according to most reliable sources), dominate in the field of scientific endeavors and technology.</p>
<p>These never ending excuses about how China got held back after a certain point, and how the West leaped ahead by accident, are starting to become less and less plausible.  I mean, even a tiny civilization such as Greece outmatched large and mighty China in the areas of scientific ideas that led to the modern world.  </p>
<p>I mean, here we are&hellip;&hellip;.decades ago, white people showed the world how to put a man on the moon, and great and mighty &#8220;up and coming China&#8221; still has yet to accomplish this even though we already showed them how to do this?</p>
<p>I would also like to say something to the people who keep quoting &#8220;March of the Titans&#8221;.  If we rely too much on this one source we lose credibility.  Yes, there is evidence for MOST of what is said in that piece, but some of the other stuff is a little over the top.  When I get in these discussions, I mention actual books that discuss the history of science which all seem to prove the same thing anyways.</p>
<p>And yes, I am aware that there is evidence that Europe developed the compass etc&hellip;on it&rsquo;s own.  By giving credit to China for doing those things I am only elaborating my argument further.  My argument goes along the lines of &#8220;okay, fine, we can give the Chinese credit for those small things but that still doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that 90% of the world&rsquo;s science came out of the West&#8221;.</p>
<p>When people mention the Great Wall, fireworks, and the compass, and try to use those accomplishments as reasons for China&rsquo;s superiority, they don&rsquo;t seem to understand how foolish they sound.</p>

Liu Xiaobo, a human rights activist and anti-communist serving an 11-year prison term for &#8220;inciting subversion of state power&#8221; (sounds like a Tea-Partier) was just awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.<br>

		<p>On the question of Asian intelligence and lack of creativity, there is one explanation I can see clearly.  I do not know if it jives with Aurturo&rsquo;s links, as I haven&rsquo;t had time to explore them yet.  But it is the nature of character languages that force a group to develop excellent memory, while Western languages work on function and rationale, once the basics are comprehended.  This is why Chinese and Japanese manufacturing has built itself on Western creativity and why China supports such a huge industrial espionage cartel in extension to its military spying activities.</p>

<p>&#8220;90% of the world&rsquo;s science came out of the West&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I suggest Courtney re-read post #13.</p>
<p>90% of the world&rsquo;s science came out of the West only because 90% of the world&rsquo;s science was developed during the last few centuries. It does not imply any kind of Western exceptionalism, only the general exponential growth of knowledge. The picture changes depending on the time at which you take your measurement, and will continue to change in the future. </p>

It does not imply any kind of Western exceptionalism, only the general exponential growth of knowledge. The picture changes depending on the time at which you take your measurement, and will continue to change in the future. &#8220;</p>
<p>And I suggest you read my last post again.  It sounds to me like you are making an inference and a guess on this one, just because you don&rsquo;t want to give the West the credit it deserves.  As I mentioned before, what about Greece?  They contributed more ideas to science than China did.  Why don&rsquo;t we start with that?</p>
<p>For you to completely rule out Western exceptionalism shows how fallacious your argument is.</p>
<p>And you are probably one of these people who is quick to give the Chinese credit for &#8220;being advanced for so long&#8221; while us &#8220;European barbarians only became civilized in the last 400 years&#8221;.</p>
<p>Well, you can&rsquo;t have it both ways.  You can&rsquo;t compliment China for being civilized for so much longer than the West without recognizing that the West accomplished so much more than China did in the  much smaller span of time that it was civilized.</p>
<p>So for you to completely rule out any possibility of Western greatness in this regards, causes you to lose credibility.</p>
<p>But of course, that is only if we are to make that assumption to begin with (that the West became civilized late in the game).  As I said, &hellip;.what about Greece and its accomplishments?</p>

<i> &#8220;we have more idiots but also more super-geniuses, to whom we owe our innovation&#8221;</i></p>
<p>* * * * *<br>
Our present  leftist educational system pretty much ignores our geniuses, leaving them to fend for themselves, while it lavishes attention and expense on our idiots.  The underlying assumption is that the geniuses will manage, but the idiots need need special help, and that those on the bottom need to be lifted up and made &#8220;equal&#8221;.   This reflects our obsession with imposing equality in all things:  If they&rsquo;re not born equal,  everyone must be MADE equal!</p>
<p>The Chinese do not have this mental disease.  When the Chinese begin to coddle their geniuses as we do our idiots, they will soar ahead and dominate the world. While we were too busy making everyone equal.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;That is  not to say the Chinese are not smart, but rather the way their system runs is that thinking outside the box is not a desirable skill. And to change that will take quite some time yet, if not forever.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>In the Orient, conformity is emphasized;  individuality is discouraged. Oriental cultures  place the group above the individual. They encourage harmony and consensus,  encourage respect for tradition, and discourage  deviation and  individualism.</p>
<p>Are they better or worse?  Well, they&rsquo;re just different.<br>

		<p>My take on this whole &#8220;superior civilization&#8221; business, FWIW. </p>
<p>From 250 BC - 500 A.D., China and Europe were roughly equal. The Romans and Greeks had nature religions, roads, cities, farming, society, effective armies. So did China, roughly equal. Romans had the arch and I prefer the European version of art but that&rsquo;s a matter of taste. Europe had Sophocles, Aristotle, Pliny and so on. China had Meng zi, Xun zi, Lao zi, Kong zi. Different but equal, more or less. </p>
<p>Then Europe had the Dark Ages (which I&rsquo;m coming to believe were not all that bad but most historians would probably disagree) and you could say that China was superior to the west. Chopsticks instead of fingers, porcelain bowls to eat out of, tea, silk, cities, fireworks, overall a much larger population looking pretty advanced. </p>
<p>But then Europe had the Renaissance, and China did not. Europe had the Enlightenment - China did not. Europe had the Industrial Revolution - China did not. Europe advanced while China remained a backwater. </p>
<p>What it basically comes down to imo is that the culture which China had developed over the centuries was fine for China, but in a world where there was more than just China, it was not so capable. It was a culture that was not able to protect itself when faced with that of Europe. One can criticize European imperialism as much as one likes, but bottom line is they kicked Chinese rear end left, right, and center. </p>
<p>The problem I see is they still have some way to go. Not just recovering from the Mao era, but overcoming 2000 years of backward superstition and Confucianism which is still rife in their society. There are still ample remnants of the Qing Dynasty around - avaricious, venal mandarins, precious little honesty and integrity. Granted, a system that has worked to bring China to where it is now over the past few decades but probably could not go a great deal further as is. Whether it can really evolve and take the lead once more is debatable, imo, but whatever happens it will be interesting to watch it unfold.</p>

<p>Now you are putting words in my mouth. Where in either of my previous posts did I compliment China? I deliberately worded my statements in general terms rather than specific terms to avoid favoritism, only to have you accuse me of it anyway. (As a matter of fact, I agree with you that China needs to deflate its ego. I am just saying that the West needs to do the same. Everyone needs to stop fantasizing about their own superiority, period.)</p>
<p>&#8220;what about Greece? They contributed more ideas to science than China did. Why don&rsquo;t we start with that?&#8221;</p>
<p>OK, what about Greece? You tell me how you intend to make your comparison, and I will tell you what I think about your method.</p>

		<p>There are a lot of fallacies that are being commited in this discussion.</p>
<p>First of all, as I made clear before, we are strictly talking about the topic of science.  We aren&rsquo;t comparing how advanced China was to Rome during such and such time.  We are strictly talking about scientific achievements when examining Nobel Prizes in Physics, Chemistry etc&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t be argued that the West has always dominated in this area going all the way back to Greece.</p>
<p>Another fallacy I am seeing is that people are basing their assumptions on how &#8220;China WILL become better than us&#8221;.  This is what this seems to be about most of the time&hellip;.the stuff that China WILL do that we haven&rsquo;t seen yet.</p>
<p>Another thing I want to mention is there are people on here who wish to bring out the fact that &#8220;China and the West have different cultures and that is all that this amounts to&#8221;.</p>
<p>Okay, but where do these cultures come from?  Don&rsquo;t they come from the people who created them?  Giving excuses for China, such as &#8220;the way their language is structured&#8221; is absurd.  </p>
<p>When we get into these discussions it seems that the pro-China side is always all too quick to explain these &#8220;cultural&#8221; differences in ways that it makes China the better civilization.</p>
<p>These arguments go along the lines of the following:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, China won&rsquo;t make the same mistakes we did&hellip;.they are more group oriented than individualistic and they would never give up their countries to outsiders&#8221;&hellip;&hellip;well again we are talking in the future tense, and also, yet again, we are speaking of this group-oriented mentality as if it makes China better than us, when the reality is that the whole point of this article was to compare scientific achievements.  And isn&rsquo;t it in the area of science that the individualistic ways of the West put us ahead?</p>
<p>Anonymous poster 25,  once again you need to go read what I said again.  I was creating a hypothetical argument to make my case.  I ended my post by stating that &#8220;but that is only if we are to make that assumption&#8221;.</p>
<p>Now that you told me that wasn&rsquo;t the point you were making, let&rsquo;s go to point B, which I offered before as the alternative.  Let&rsquo;s talk about Greece as you suggest.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that if we wish to discuss strictly important scientific ideas and advancements then Greece wins by a landslide when comparing those two civilizations.  This isn&rsquo;t hard to research.  Of course, I have done plenty of my own spare reading on the history of science.  All you have to do is pick up an Encyclopedia in the library and go to an article on the history of science.  I can guarantee you that you will see the same thing I always see&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;a page if not more is devoted to the SCIENTIFIC achievements of Greece, while China only gets a paragraph.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ll enthusiastically go along with that! Some of the arrogance and boasting that I see here is really embarassing. It&rsquo;s more like bickering among schoolkids than a discussion among adults.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thank you for giving me an opportunity to point out yet another fallacy used when these discussions come up. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see anybody above claiming that Westerners are superior to the Chinese.  I myself never claimed that.  In fact, I took the time to point out the good qualities of China, as did other people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand what is &#8220;childish&#8221; about stating the facts as they are.  History has proven that the Chinese are more civil than us in many ways, and they are also more group-oriented and devoted to their race.  Westerners, on the other hand are more divisive and individualistic which has led us to create many unmatched achievements in science and technology.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see how this is a discussion of &#8220;who is superior to who&#8221; as opposed to simply stating facts.</p>
<p>I am also disturbed that so many white people on this website somehow see it as threatening and dangerous for whites to talk about their high points.  Why not?  Asians do it.  Blacks do it.  It is time for whites to do it, for goodness sake!</p>
<p>Heaven forbid whites be proud of their past achievements on websites such as this, when in mainstream society we are only allowed to discuss the greatness of Asians, blacks and everybody else!</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because the article was written by Western academics. This is my point: every civilization will tell the history of any subject according to its own perspective. A Chinese article would probably devote a page to their own science and a paragraph to Greek science. Same thing with an Indian article, an Iranian article, etc.. So who is correct?</p>
