<h1><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1324194/Mohammed-popular-baby-boys-ahead-Jack-Harry.html">Mohammed Is Now the Most Popular Name for Baby Boys Ahead of Jack and Harry</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), October 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mohammed is now the most popular name for newborn boys in England and Wales ahead of Jack and Harry, it emerged today.</p>
<p>The name, when 12 different spellings were included, was given to 7,549 youngsters in 2009, official statistics revealed.</p>
<p>Oliver was the second most popular and it was given to 7,364 boys in England and Wales in 12 months.</p>
<p>Jack was third, Harry fourth and Alfie in fifth place in the league table of names.</p>
<p>However, because official figures did not take into account the variations in the spelling of Mohammed, Oliver was named as the most popular boys&rsquo; name by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) who released the information.</p>
<p>Jack had been the top name for newborn boys in England and Wales for the previous 14 years.</p>
<p>While Oliver was beaten to first place by Mohammed, in the girls list Olivia came out on top.</p>
<p>Ruby, Chloe, Emily and Sophie made up the top five list of girls&rsquo; names in 2009, it emerged today.</p>
<p>The official list put Mohammed in only 16th place, but when the other 11 different spellings of the same name are taken into account it is the most popular.</p>
<p>Mohammed was given to 3,300 boys, while Muhammad was given to 2,162 youngsters.</p>
<p>The name is a common Anglicised spelling of an Arabic name taken from a word meaning &#8216;praise&rsquo;.</p>
<p>There is disagreement among scholars about why there are so many spellings of the same name  &mdash;  some argue it is because of phonetic translations while others say it is down to parental choice.</p>
<p>Muslim parents often use the name to honour the Prophet or to show a link to the religion.</p>
<p>There are 14 recognised variations of the spelling  &mdash;  although only 12 of them were given to newborn children last year.</p>
<p>Muslims make up around three per cent of the British population.</p>
<p>The unusual names David and Victoria Beckham gave to their three boys seemed to be boosted in the annual league tables by their celebrity association.</p>
<p>There were 282 Brooklyns, 78 Romeos and 73 Cruzs born in 2009, the figures revealed.</p>
<p>Six new names made it into the top 100 boys&rsquo; names this year  &mdash;  they were Aiden, Arthur, Frederick, Jude, Stanley and Austin.</p>
<p>In the girls&rsquo; list, three names moved into the top 100 this year  &mdash;  Heidi, Mya and Sara.</p>
<p>Compared to names chosen for babies ten years earlier, there was a resurgence in the popularity of names which were associated with people of the inter-war generation, or earlier.</p>
<p>Evie was the tenth most popular name given to baby girls in 2009, for example, moving up 157 places since 1999.</p>
<p>Ruby, the second most popular name for girls in 2009, was ranked 91 places lower 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Boys&rsquo; names such as Alfie and Charlie have followed a similar trend.</p>
<p>Six names in the boys&rsquo; top ten in 2009 were also there in 1999  &mdash;  Jack, Joshua, Thomas, James, Daniel and William.</p>
<p>Five girls&rsquo; names featured in both lists  &mdash;  Olivia, Chloe, Emily, Sophie and Jessica.</p>
<p>There were 706,248 live births in England and Wales in 2009.</p>
<p>Mothers of newborn and slightly older babies are urged by the ONS to include their babies&rsquo; details in the 2011 Census, taking place next March.</p>
<p>&#8216;Babies often go unrecorded in the census as new mothers sometimes don&rsquo;t realise they need to enter the details of even the very newest member of the household,&rsquo; ONS spokesman William Mach said.</p>
<p>&#8216;There is a strong link between filling in the census and the authorities being able to plan and provide public services in years to come  &mdash;  for example, in setting numbers of school places.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>In an ideal world, this would be fine. Let them stick labels on these future deportees. Unfortunately, Cameron will keeping bringing them in as long as his backers in the financial world want immigrants. How this nation, that didn&rsquo;t even have a written constitution with a 14th Amendment(the worst of several awful provisions of the Us Constitution), arrived at this suicidal niche in its history is beyond me. Is this for what the Battle of Britain was fought? </p>

<p>Yes, but the press has to understand that pretty soon, when the Muslims have been here long enough to be Westernized, they&rsquo;ll be gambling, boozing, lusting after loose women and going to strip clubs just as most all the other males do.  It&rsquo;s a foregone conclusion.  Nobody can live among the sins and vices of the West without changing dramatically.  It&rsquo;s already started to a certain degree.</p>
<p>Mohammed will soon learn that vices are fun, and when he gets tanked on a couple of six packs a few times he&rsquo;ll likely realize  that he doesn&rsquo;t have to kill anybody to get to heaven, because he&rsquo;s already there.  And all that propagandizing by the imams at the mosques about strapping on explosives in order to enter the pearly gates with a gang of virgins will seem like second-rate entertainment compared to chug-a-lugging a six pack and smoking a joint.   </p>
<p>As the conversions occur, the names will change too, like &#8220;Ace&#8221; Mohammed, &#8220;Fast Eddy&#8221; Aziz, and Johnny Farak, who will probably run a pool hall and take bets on the side for college sports.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to occur.  Has anybody lived among the West and not been corrupted by it?  Does anybody really believe Sharia law is going to replace fun and games?</p>

<p>Dream on&hellip;</p>
<p>I was at the London Playboy Club several times in the very early 1970&rsquo;s.  The Muslims were at the casino tables all night long blowing millions of pounds.  They had more where that came from.</p>
<p>They had the booze, the coke, the call girls&hellip;they had everything money could buy.</p>
<p>The result? 40 years later they are still sawing off heads and blowing up trains, planes and you name it.</p>
<p>They are grooming little white girls in Britain (Junior High and High School ages) and turning them out to be hookers and whores so they can make even more money and conquer the Home Islands.  They have hookers and whores in their home countries and the dope is getting in, too.  The &#8216;Pleasures of the West&rsquo; will not defeat them.  Yet they still believe in Sharia and what it requires. And they still intend to deliver it to us whether we like it or not.</p>

<p>This may be true, but a different public face will be on &#8216;ace&rsquo; and &#8216;fast eddy&rsquo; Mohammed. Behind the scenes it may be gomorrah. But the public face will be identity politics on a sorely aggrieved man of color. It guarantees white deference, affirmative action perks, and a solidarity with white women. Not to mention with the educated class too.</p>

		<p>   Cultural capitulation . It&rsquo;s everywhere you look . Westerners have bought into the hate fest foisted on us by those who are jealous of our culture . I cringe everytime I hear,&#8221;tsunami.&#8221; Tidal wave is an older, more accurate term . At least in my book . And yeah, I can believe Sharia Law will be enacted in the west . Muslims males have always been famous for having their fun anyway . Look at your Saudi princes .  The law and extreme punishment only kicks in when there is something to gain for those in charge . Remember the Imans who repeatedly raped the beautiful 18 year old as punishment for her brother&rsquo;s transgressions a while back in the Middle-East ? I want to say it was in Afghanistan . Who is this fellow Stan, all of these Muslim nations are named after anyway ?    </p>

		<p>Muslims don&rsquo;t have much imagination or self expression about most things, being dominated by their oppressive lifestyle and culture. Mohammed (and variations thereof) is always first choice for a boys name, depending on whether or not they are Sunni or Shi&rsquo;a. Christians have a host of names to choose from and not all have a religious connotation. I note that this story omits any reference to popular islamic girls names but they don&rsquo;t really count for much anyway. Boys names certainly reflect different branches of islam and date back to the very beginning and the history of family violence at the time. You would have to do your own research as it&rsquo;s too complicated to post here and is a bit off-topic. The simple reason is that Sunni carries same respect for all Shahabas so they would commonly have names like Ali, Hasan, Hussein, Abbas, Jafar etc. On the other hand, Shias bear a great grudge and hate against most sahabas and will never have names like Bakr, Umer, Uthman, Aisha, Talha etc. So somebody with the name of &#8220;Ali&#8221; or &#8220;Husain&#8221; can be either be Shia or Sunni but someone with name of &#8220;Umer&#8221; or &#8216;Aisha&#8221; can never be a Shia, just ask one!  Don&rsquo;t forget, islam is a religion of peace, just so long as you are muslim and belong to the &#8216;right&rsquo; sect. So, is everything clear now?<br>

seeing all this pertinent, alarming, maddening, saddening news at AmRen (which is stridently ignored by 99% of whites),<br>
Are you depressed?<br>
What does it feel like to be less than one percent of a white race that is itself less than seven percent of the world, knowing we&rsquo;re all going down the sewerpipe?<br>
What do YOU feel like, knowing nobody else knows, or can be made to care?<br>

<p></p>
<p>First, the West is a diverse land, not everyone takes part in such materialistic habits such as excessive sex, drinking, drugs, etc. I am a Westerner, and I do not drink, I do not do drugs, I do not take part in what you think is &ldquo;Western culture&rdquo;.</p>
<p><br>
Besides, if you understood the nature of Muslims you would realize how it works. They start out strict and paranoid, and then become relaxed and start doing things prohibited by the Islamic faith, and then when a problem erupts some Mullah will declare a need to return to Muslim values and law, thus placing a desperate society back under the thumb of religious extremists. Any sin they had committed during this time of &ldquo;evil&rdquo; they will blame on Westerners, Jews, and &ldquo;heretics&rdquo;.  After a &ldquo;heretic&rdquo; genocide or two, the society will go through the same pattern as before, thus starting its journey around the loop again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Besides, very religious people are often highly hypocritical, so the drinking or having careless sex won&rsquo;t matter on bit to them when they stone someone else for doing the same thing.<br>
Do you not realize there have been liberal Muslim societies before? </p>
<p><br>
Do you know why this is? Islam is a missionary religion, just as Christianity is. They seek power and converts, wherever they can get them. Coexistence is not possible without conflict. To Muslims there are the Muslims and the heretics, which category do you think you and I belong to? Islam has to grow to survive. In the West, we have become secular, thus allowing Christianity to function in a generally peaceful manner.</p>
<p><br>
Abraham religions are not like the religions of our ancient ancestors, which were polytheistic, nature based, and often very flexible and fluid (how many pagan holy wars were there?). Abraham religions are a subject all their own. <br>

		<p>My guess, considering the estimate that muslims are only 3% of the UK population, is that muslim boys are practically ALL being named Mohammad, whereas the indigenous English have a far more diverse list of names to name their boys.  Makes the muslims look pretty pathetic.</p>

<p>Anybody that thinks Western culture has not deteriorated into quite a few vices is somebody that has a problem with accurately viewing and interpreting what goes on in the real world.  And your bragging and lauding your moral superiority about not having any vices has absolutely nothing to do with any points I made.  </p>
<p>You seem to have taken my opinion as an indictment of your inmpeccable lifestyle.  But, worse, you ASSUMED that I&rsquo;m including everybody in my description of the West, obviously unaware of how illogical you are in doing so.  Nobody specifies definitively about every single point he makes.  I don&rsquo;t know any intelligent person that has to have that fact explained to him.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s about the most juvenile nonsense I&rsquo;ve read in a long time.  I understand human nature, and if you think you have some kind of special understanding of Muslims, why should that ring true with anybody, since you&rsquo;ve indicated that you&rsquo;re obviously extraordinarily naive in your assertions?  You might get by with that kind of logic in a high school forum, but nowhere else.  Sorry, old boy, but your points are STRICTLY childish, and you ramble on quite a bit about points never raised or ones that are not pertinent to a logical rebuttal.</p>
<p>But it is especially notable that you were unable to recognize a bit of satire when you see it and, instead, ramble off into a litany of your clean life as if somebody personally attacked you.</p>
<p>I like a good exchange from time to time, if the rebuttal is intelligent, but you&rsquo;ve contributed just the opposite and you did so anonomously.</p>

<p>Of course you are.  Points in opposition to a generalization of Western culture aren&rsquo;t legitimate if they wander off into holding yourself up as some kind of icon of virtue, which obviously you did.  Why enter yourself personally into a matter that has nothing to do with you as an individual or anybody else for that matter?  </p>
<p>Too, in responding to a generalization of a population, giving<br>
yourself as an example doesn&rsquo;t disprove the argument that concerns itself with the population as a whole.  What you&rsquo;re saying is that &#8220;your argument isn&rsquo;t valid, because &#8216;look at me&rsquo; I&rsquo;m nearly perfect and don&rsquo;t fit into your generalization.  Pretty egotistical, but, then again, your entire post was one of nothing but contentious arrogance.  You tried to lecture me, but most of what you said was completely uncalled for. </p>
<p>Do you really believe people on here are so unsophisticated that they do not understand history or the fundementals of the major religions, which you offered in the form of a lecture?</p>
<p>&#8220;With all due respect (and apology if I insulted you), all you have done is attack me, but you have yet to give me a counter-argument.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve given you a counter argument to valid points, but the points I omitted are so silly they require no rebuttal. So, if you think my tone was a bit hard, please re-read your own comments and put yourself in the position of the person they&rsquo;re directed at.  I&rsquo;m just responding in a similar manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Also, if your statement is satirical, be aware that this is the internet and I have to assume that you are serious.&#8221;</p>
<p>All satire has a truthful, serious aspect to it.  The purpose is to go to extremes a bit for the sake of humor which very often drives the point home much more clearly.  </p>
<p>What makes the internet, in your mind, only a forum for seriousness?  Is the written word somehow different if it is in a book or magazine rather than the internet?</p>
<p>Personally, I&rsquo;d like to see a bit more humor on here so long as it&rsquo;s on topic.  I get a little bit of a chuckle from what some write from time to time, but it is few and far between.  There&rsquo;s not enough of it, in my humble opinion.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve read the back and forth between Ranger and others about the Muslims who &#8220;fall victim&#8221; to the &#8220;vices of the West.&#8221;</p>
<p>I happen to think that, like the 9/11 Hijackers, those that are doing so are engaging in a Taqqiya-like maneuver to &#8220;fit&#8221; into the society, while behind everyone&rsquo;s back, they push the Sharia Law football forward once inch at a time.</p>
<p>This is where I disagreed with Juan Williams, in his famous &#8220;outburst&#8221; that got him fired from NPR (as far as that goes, who would notice?)  It&rsquo;s not the Muslims on planes in traditional garb that you have to worry about, it&rsquo;s the ones wearing polo shirts and cotton dockers that are more likely to be hijackers.  If Muslims wearing hijabs and burquas and those head scarves do act funny on a plane, then they&rsquo;re deliberately doing so in order to prod someone into complaining, so that the CAIR can swoop in, file civil rights lawsuits and whine about &#8220;Islamophobia.&#8221;  (Use your favorite internet search engine for the terms &#8220;Flying Imams Minneapolis.&#8221;) In other words, a setup.</p>

		<p>The above numbers are from 2001. Seems like the muslim population has increased to 4% of the population since then:</p>
<p>&rdquo;The Muslim population in Britain has grown by more than 500,000 to 2.4 million in just four years, according to official research collated for The Times. </p>
<p>The population multiplied 10 times faster than the rest of society, the research by the Office for National Statistics reveals. In the same period the number of Christians in the country fell by more than 2 million&hellip; while the biggest Christian population is among over-70s bracket, for Muslims it is the under-4s.</p>
<p>Professor Peach said that the high number of Muslims under the age of 4  &mdash;  301,000 as of September last year  &mdash;  would benefit Britain&rsquo;s future labour market through taxes that would subsequently contribute to sustaining the country&rsquo;s ageing population.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you are. Points in opposition to a generalization of Western culture aren&rsquo;t legitimate if they wander off into holding yourself up as some kind of icon of virtue, which obviously you did. Why enter yourself personally into a matter that has nothing to do with you as an individual or anybody else for that matter? <br>
Too, in responding to a generalization of a population, giving<br>
yourself as an example doesn&rsquo;t disprove the argument that concerns itself with the population as a whole. What you&rsquo;re saying is that &ldquo;your argument isn&rsquo;t valid, because &lsquo;look at me&rsquo; I&rsquo;m nearly perfect and don&rsquo;t fit into your generalization. Pretty egotistical, but, then again, your entire post was one of nothing but contentious arrogance. You tried to lecture me, but most of what you said was completely uncalled for. &ldquo;</p>
<p><br>
Egotistical? You act as if I sat here and continuously wrote how wonderful I was. As I stated before, I assure you that is not the case. Would you have preferred I talked about those I know who share my beliefs? What difference does it make? <br>
I was not trying to lecture you; I was simply stating why I felt a certain way upon the issue. Yet again, I apologize if I came off that way. </p>
<p><br>
&ldquo;Do you really believe people on here are so unsophisticated that they do not understand history or the fundementals of the major religions, which you offered in the form of a lecture?&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
The people at Amren are more educated and sophisticated than the majority of people.  I was just stating why I held certain beliefs about this issue. Yet again, I did not intend for it to be a lecture, I just thought I should present reason for how I felt.</p>
<p><br>
&ldquo;All satire has a truthful, serious aspect to it. The purpose is to go to extremes a bit for the sake of humor which very often drives the point home much more clearly. <br>
What makes the internet, in your mind, only a forum for seriousness? Is the written word somehow different if it is in a book or magazine rather than the internet?&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
I&rsquo;m aware of what satire is thank you. <br>
Your comment did not appear satirical to me because I&rsquo;ve heard people make that argument. <br>
Satire can be hard to pull off in real life, but it can be even more difficult to do on the internet, where one cannot hear your voice, see your motions, or get a general feel of what one is doing. All I can see is written words.</p>
<p><br>
Yet again, I apologize if anything I said came off as insulting, that was not my goal.<br>

<p>There is no need to apologize, my friend.  I believe you are sincere, and had no vindictiveness behind your responses.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s hoping you have a nice weekend.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t for one second believe Whites are 90% of the population of England today. I&rsquo;ve been throughout there and the I&rsquo;d say the Muslims alone were about 15% and growing quickly, this in addition to other minorities.</p>

		<p>Any population figures for Great Britain (especially England, where the bulk of the immigrants settle) are strictly meaningless.</p>
<p>For years even the Home Office (!) has admitted that it has no idea exactly how many people there are in the country and the 10-yearly censuses are a joke since the vast numbers of illegal immigrants will not show up at all on them and even legal immigrants are among the social groups least likely to respond.  (Although this is technically illegal only indigenous people are at all likely to be prosecuted, and this is rare.) </p>
<p>I would say that Anonymous @#16&rsquo;s estimate of 10 per cent for the current Muslim population of the UK is a low one, and we must remember that all population figures, even reasonably accurate ones, are only a momentary snapshot of a constantly changing phenomenon. It would be more pertinent, in establishing likely future demographic trends, to establish what percentage of the under-30s in Great Britain (and especially England) are Muslim, what percentage of the under-20s, what percentage of the under-10s, and, most importantly of all, what percentage of live births at present.</p>
<p>Incidentally, England, where the bulk of the population of Great Britain (both indigenous and immigrant) is situated is overwhelmingly urban (and has been for well over a century), so a majority in the great urban conglomerations - the South East (including London), the West Midlands (including Birmingham), the North West (including Manchester, Liverpool and surrounding areas, including the former mill-towns of southern Lancashire) and the West Riding of Yorkshire (including Leeds, Bradford and surrounding areas) will constitute a majority in the country as a whole.</p>
<p>As you Americans say, &#8220;Do the math.&#8221;</p>
