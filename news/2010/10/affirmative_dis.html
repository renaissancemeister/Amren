<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>ON THE subject of meritocracy, an interesting academic experiment shows that people have started to assume that black students from elite schools are the beneficiaries of affirmative action, and therefore do not deserve their professional qualifications:</p>
<p>&#8220;An experiment designed to test perceptions of affirmative action found that independent observers rated companies significantly lower when they were told the top executives were African-American graduates of prestigious universities, instead of white. The difference went away when the executives were said to have graduated from less selective schools, and when the evaluators were told that the more selective schools exercised race-blind admissions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps minorities will eventually revolt against affirmative action on the grounds that the rent is just too damn high.</p>

<p>Well, when a majority of blacks in most elite schools ARE there because of affirmative action, that is a statistical fact that gets generalized to every black from such a school.</p>
<p>At this point almost everyone who has had professional experience with blacks in the workplace knows that generally they have been affirmative actioned beyond their capabilities.  Conservatives know it, liberals know it, whites and Hispanics and Asians know it, and on some level blacks themselves probably do as well.  It&rsquo;s not fair to those who have to deal with the AA blacks, and it&rsquo;s not fair to the non-AA blacks who are unfairly looked down on.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not sympathetic to this line of argument against AA.  It presupposes the anti-white premise that blacks&rsquo; interests are the most important issue.  We need to oppose AA because it hurts whites, not because it supposedly hurts blacks.  </p>

		<p>If I were black I would be against AA for this very reason. If I am one of the few competent and intellegent blacks I would always wonder if people thought I had attained any position due to AA. True, fewer blacks would be hired for professional type jobs but the ones that were hired would be qualified. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to think that <i>The Economist</i> is making a subtle joke, but, Once-great Britain being what it is these days, I doubt it. <i>Nothing</i> will ever turn &#8220;minorities&#8221; against the anti-White racism that is &#8220;affirmative action.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hey, I have an idea!  How about &#8220;Perhaps White majorities will eventually revolt against affirmative action on the grounds that the cost is just too damn high?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nope, I guess not.  That&rsquo;d be Racist, wouldn&rsquo;t it?<br>

<p>&#8220;I would rather pay high rent that be banished to homelessness. Thirty-years later we seem far too content to forget that if not for affirmative action, many an ivory tower would have remained so in fact and deed. Don&rsquo;t take my word for it, ask the solitary black student in this recent Oxford cohort.&#8221;</p>
<p>I doubt many prospective &#8220;Black&#8221; admittees to prestigious &#8220;elite&#8221; universities would be &#8220;homeless&#8221; had they not been beneficiary to affirmative action admission policies. I believe the writer speaks of &#8220;rent&#8221; in the sense that, prior to the advent of affirmative action programs, things &#8220;worked&#8221;. </p>

		<p>This is great, let&rsquo;s start at the top.  Obama was not and still isn&rsquo;t qualified to be president of the Unitied States.  He only got elected due to the spillover of AA into national attitude that wants to prop up every black with a &#8220;dream&#8221; whether it is basketball, hip-hop, rap, or politics - whatever it might be.  So when a young local black guy with a gift for gab, shows up, every do-gooder, guilt tripping white liberal wants to jump on the promotion for that feel-good moment they all seem to need, like a junkie.  </p>
<p>So now whites are supposed to ADOPT black kids and raise them up with more care and attention than their own white children, or INSTEAD of having white children.  That&rsquo;s the message, folks.  We get that from movies, television programs, and now CNN (Colored National Networks).  I actually saw that morning report show &#8220;Tony&#8221; what&rsquo;s-his-name, show a clip, with the help of an obliging white woman, of a college kid, a white guy, twirl around, doing some silly dance, and hit his face on a table.  They laugh it off, Tony expresses distain for the kid, then shows a clip of a white family who has adopted a black kid who is now a total gymnist wiz, performing on a high school cheer squad.  The message was obvious, and should be insulting to every white person everywhere.  Using the network like that ought to be against some sort of code of conduct.</p>

<p>Ha!  Has anyone else heard of the &#8220;rent Too Damn High&#8221; Party, running in New York State?  Its an actual party, and yes that is its actual name.  What&rsquo;s weird is that the guy running for them (I forget his name) looked like a respectable black man, with a Victorian-type beard and good suit, and he spoke very well, in my opinion.  I wondered if it was a joke or something.</p>

		<p>Yes, once again blacks are marginalized and stigmatized and just victims of old fashion stereotyping - that can affect their performance. And everyone should know about this, and be more sensitive to this unfairness, running rampant in our society.</p>
<p>There is of course one way to end this unfair burden. End affirmative action. </p>

		<p>On the recent TV show, the &#8220;head of pediatrics&#8221; at a fictional elite Boston hospital was a black woman. </p>
<p>It struck me:</p>
<p>I grew up in the area, and with all the brouhaha about blacks at Harvard, etc., I have NEVER heard of a black clinician/researcher of any consequence anywhere in the area. </p>
<p>What happens to black Harvard med school grads? </p>
<p>Do they practice in black neighborhoods?</p>
<p>The white elite proponents of AA seem very good at keeping them away from their own families&hellip;..</p>

If blacks believed they were intellectually equal to whites, they wouldn&rsquo;t have any need for affirmative action. AA is nothing but an admission by blacks that they&rsquo;re not as smart as whites.</p>
<p>Blacks can&rsquo;t let AA go because they know without it, the truth about black intelligence would be obvious.</p>

		<p>this articles hits home because every time I see a black &#8220;professional&#8221; i wonder about their level of competence given the propensity to push them through because of skin color. It&rsquo;s a natural reaction on the part of most to question them. Also the CEO of Xerox is black but then again how hard is it to screw up a company whose principal product is photocopiers?</p>

		<p>America has been forced to play LET&rsquo;S PRETEND ever since the Civil Rights Act was signed into law 45 years ago. </p>
<p>We have to pretend that IQ tests don&rsquo;t really tell us anything about the person being tested, even though those who test low always perform low. </p>
<p>We have to pretend that the Blacks who overran our once White neighborhoods are not the reason those neighborhoods rapidly transformed into desolate, war-torn, crumbling ruins.</p>
<p>We have to pretend that our ever-expanding prison systems are filled beyond capacity with Black inmates because the people who run our police departments and courts are just a bunch of racists, not because Blacks commit most of the crimes and they are not very good at it. (For instance, Blacks stand along side the street and sell drugs to any stranger that happens to stop. Why don&rsquo;t they just go knock on the door at the local jail if they want in that bad.)</p>
<p>On a more personal note, I always had to pretend that Black engineers were capable of doing anything that White engineers could do, even though though the only time that I ever had dealings with Black engineers is when I was summoned to a company to correct mistakes made by Black engineers.</p>
<p>I think we all need to start keeping detailed journals to document the daily screw ups of the Blacks who have been thrust into positions which they are not qualified to hold. It&rsquo;s time that our businesses purge themselves of all employees who were hired on complexion instead of merit.</p>

		<p>You cannot turn on a TV show or watch a movie these days without the people in authority positions being black.  Doctors, administrators, supervisors, the president (2012, House, the Mentalist, etc) - they&rsquo;re pretty much all black now.</p>
<p>A recent candy bar commercial that&rsquo;s been airing on news websites before you can see the content sticks particularly deep in my maw.</p>
<p>Two white women are shown in an office setting, getting giddy after they open a drawer, and a bunch of candy bars come floating out in the air.  </p>
<p>A moment later, the camera focuses on a pair of women&rsquo;s shoes walking towards the giggling women, who suddenly get afraid and try to hide the candy bars.  Then we see the face of the arriving woman, a black woman, who is apparently their boss.  The white women stand mutely aside as the black woman takes a candy bar, puts her feet up, sits at the desk and dreamily eats the candy bar with a sly look in her eyes that to me looked just like, &#8220;Th&rsquo;as right, crackers, I&rsquo;mma yo boss now!&#8221;</p>
<p>I have had only one black boss in my life, and he was so affirmative-actioned that NOBODY on staff respected him at all.  He used to trip his tongue on words that were longer than two syllables! </p>

<p>You better look carefully at all affirmative action recipients in positions of authority and remember this, &#8220;the less qualified got the job because of color.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The value of an Ivy League decree has been declining for decades.<br>
The policy of automatically placing &#8220;legacy&#8221; babies of former<br>
Harvard attendees and then the need to   diffuse white guilt by<br>
searching every ghetto for some black to stick on the enrollment<br>
roster has rendered a degree from Harvard highly suspect. <br>
Furthermore Prof. Cornel West and Co. have been inflating grades to <br>
worthlessness much any African dictator does with his nations currency.</p>

		<p>Yes, I have noticed that blacks are over-represented in positions of authority on TV. The solution? Turn the thing off! Don&rsquo;t let your family watch it without supervision, and explanation of what is happening. This is especially true if there are youngsters in your family, but also of teenagers.</p>
<p>My mother said it, and I do, too: whenever I see a black professional, I assume they are not as good as their white equivalent, and I go to someone else. That is one end-product of AA.</p>

<p>No way.  Most minorities see affirmaive action as a entitlement to combat white racism.  They rationalize they deserve AA.  Even many white liberal women have grown acccustomed to their share of AA and they don&rsquo;t want to give it up.  Majority rules and ethnic minorities and liberal white women are the majority.  </p>

		<p>I worry less about the man than the institution and the legacy.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that half of getting anywhere in life is the social networks you build and when that was the &#8216;old boy&rsquo; system as a white guarantor of societal homogeny and harmony, things got done.  Often really great things.</p>
<p>That can&rsquo;t happen where blacks are accepted but not wanted even when the excuse of IQ-as-AA deficit doesn&rsquo;t apply.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the kids&hellip;</p>
<p>Genius level IQ&rsquo;s are, to public science, a mystery due to regression to the mean.  A 120-135 person who marries a 100-105 spouse is going to have kids somewhere between their own IQs and those of the race norm.</p>
<p>This is true of -every- person, regardless of race.  Blacks slip farther south because their mean is lower than most if not all other population groups.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s really something for all of us to worry about because as goes ONE generation of society via denied opportunity for truly high IQ individuals, passed over in favor of &#8216;needy&rsquo; AA social symbols, so goes the institutions which lack the continuity of culture and affinity to sustain themselves.</p>
<p>EVERYTHING synthetic in society is human on a 20-30 year cycle of renewing the &#8216;corporate memory&rsquo; of training one&rsquo;s own replacement.  But if that person is not someone you can feel affinity towards both as an inheritor of your racial excellence.  And as a guardian for your children and grandchildren&rsquo;s future.</p>
<p>How much investment are you gonna make in &#8216;society for society&rsquo;s sake&rsquo;???</p>
<p>In some ways I pity us all.</p>
<p>For whites in particular, having been raised to acknowledge and envy and pursue excellence in all forms, we have been sold out by our &#8216;superiors&rsquo; to the level where the excuse has become: &#8216;society can&rsquo;t afford it&rsquo; in terms of the number of people who would like a college level job and will never get it, whether for AA reasons or because some yutz paying Americans 8 dollars an hour to make GAP products (when we are the principle consumers of said products) decided it didn&rsquo;t make sense if he could get Indonesia&rsquo;s Rupiah to collapse so hard that he could pay them 1 dollar a day instead.</p>
<p>Yet here&rsquo;s two facts that I think are undeniable:</p>
<p>1.  We all need to be operating at 120 or better IQs so that we can understand and hold our governments accountable for their policies.  We aren&rsquo;t moving towards this in any uniform, population wide, metric which means our system and the votes that support it are not any smarter now than they were in the 1960s when this mess started.  And it shows.</p>
<p>2.  We should all -want- our children to be so much better than us that they don&rsquo;t live like us.  It is such a waste to consider a 120 IQ individual as being a burger flipper.  Or a ditch digger.  And yet, especially if we use genetics and chase the long sequence DNA that helps give us those phenomenal intelligences, we may well find that there simply aren&rsquo;t enough jobs at the top.</p>
<p>It is the latter that I think is the most critically misunderstood element of our capitalist mercantile society.  Marx and Engels called this False Consciousness as an expression of false ideology enabling social mobility among the working classes.  It is this false perception which drives the &#8216;market ideal&rsquo; that we need more and more consumerism to have more and more product sales so that &#8216;more and more dumb people can become wealthy by hard work&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t happen that way.  It never did.</p>
<p>At the same time, we should neither want nor have to move back to the level of toil our grandparents did.  We should not assume that it is &#8216;the easy life&rsquo; that destroys our health and divides us all over material gain and security.  I would say that it is the stress of trying to achieve beyond a given social level, _regardless of IQ_ that is destroying us.  And a lack of true innovation in altering the -way- we do work (and get social credits for it) as much as exploitation (of an existing debt leveraged poverty system) that is doing it. </p>
<p>What we need to do is dismantle the system of cogs for cogs sake and instigate something that doesn&rsquo;t require people to define happiness by &#8216;success&rsquo; (growth, capitalism, excess production, profit, whatever).  But rather by simpler things like how well they raise their kids and how civically responsible they are to their nations.</p>
<p>This is one of the big reasons I don&rsquo;t like the black vs. white &#8216;entitlement of heritage&rsquo; (merit vs. slave guilt) fight.</p>
<p>Because in truth, we can only work the blacks under the table so long as we are allowed to do so with a fixed endgame objective in mind.  Even if AA disappeared tomorrow, our world cannot be one of an infinite: &#8216;more labor for more success&rsquo; driven institutional exploitation.  It just can&rsquo;t.  Whether you come down on the Paul Bunyon or John Henry side of the fight, we are not made as cogs.  Our brilliance, our art, our discoveries, have NOT come from that kind of mindless ant work ethic.</p>
<p>We need a surety for ourselves and our prosperity so that, in their certainty of easy survival and open opportunities, they build a racial confidence that lets them change our world as much as continue it.</p>
<p>That will never happen so long as we are looking over one shoulder at the race/s behind us.  Or watching them leapfrog ahead, deservedly or otherwise.</p>

		<p>To comment #10 from elitist:<br>
This particular character may be based on a real life example, a prominent black female physician and OB/GNY who graduated from Harvard Med in the early 1950s. She died recently, and the obituary noted her very strong and visible opposition to Roe vs Wade and the subsequent maintreaming of abortion as emergency contraception. See<br>

		<p>But blacks in professional positions are now getting upset that Asians and Indians (from India) won&rsquo;t play the game.  White people keep a straight face and pretend that Affirmative Action doesn&rsquo;t mean underqualified, but those darn foreigners are openly disrespectful, and avoid hiring or blacks under any circumstances.</p>

		<p>The fact is that Harvard has been graduating blacks since 1870 (first one was Richard Greener), long before the term &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; had ever been invented.  The anti-white racist policies known as &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; must absolutely be abolished.  Some blacks will get get into Harvard, but it will be only those who earned their position legitimately. </p>
<p>Of course, it would take a revolution to end anti-white bigotry in this country. Let the revolution begin!</p>

		<p>some one, some where, who was involved in the admission of Obama to the three &#8216;prestige&rsquo; colleges he attended,  knows the truth. not only was he not a stellar student, he was a troubled person, to sum up a host of personal and professional flaws, who has not place in institutions where the vast majority are focused,highly skilled individuals superior to the &#8220;average&#8221; person of any ethnicity. when that someone tells the truth, this balloon man&rsquo;s image is popped.</p>

		<p>This is horse sense. Of course the vast majority of Affirmative Action graduates and hires DO NOT deserve their credentials. And anyone with common sense knows it. It&rsquo;s a no-brainer, just like the grads are.</p>

		<p>One thing is for sure. Airlines are now hiring pilots under affirmitive action programs. Just hope your surgeon isn&rsquo;t hired under that program.  <br>

		<p>The funniest part:</p>
<p>People have &#8220;started&#8221; to assume black people don&rsquo;t deserve their<br>
professional qualifications.</p>
<p>I thought people assumed that all along.</p>
<p>Another thing I have noticed is black people demand AA but after receiving this benefit no one is to ever mention they were an AA hire.<br>

		<p>In reference to what another poster said about T.V. nonsense( yeah, right, every black person is a superior doctor or clinician), just look at any medical dictionary or respectable anatomy and physiology textbook. I don&rsquo;t recall seeing any &#8220;black&#8221; names who had syndromes, medical procedures or diseases named after them.  Same thing for certain A &P; parts and processes.  Doesn&rsquo;t that tell any reasonably intelligent person soemthing?  As for me in regards to all of this stupid political correctness, and absolute nonsense prevelent in television, especially network television, as a bumper sticker I saw once said, &#8220;Ignore the mediia and think for yourself.&#8221;  The bottom line is affirmative action does NO ONE any favors!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Harvard has been graduating blacks since 1870&hellip; The anti-white racist policies known as &ldquo;affirmative action&rdquo; must absolutely be abolished&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a major part of the affirmative action argument&hellip; but as a rationale for affirmative action, it is sometimes pointed out that Jews were once discriminated against at Harvard and other big east schools, sometime around the 1920&rsquo;s. It seems the commentary is really about how bad whites are/have been and it is used as just one fact to angrily &#8216;prove&rsquo; affirmative action is necessary.</p>
<p>The full story is that Jews were overrepresented at some of the big-east schools (as they may well be now) and schools were &#8216;filling-up&rsquo; with Jewish students (as overrepresented as the politically correct class tell us whites are overrepresented today). Evil, racist restrictions on Jews then, were no different than the politically correct restrictions that have been placed on whites for the last 40 years. Except I&rsquo;d wager that the evil disproportion of representation was still greater then than it is today. That is, today&rsquo;s educators are much more efficient at running &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo;. </p>
<p>Basically, in 50 years time there will still be discrimination against whites, and their demonization, because those evil whites discriminated against Asian students back in 2010&hellip; Asians are discriminated against by affirmative action at universities sometimes too.</p>

		<p>Poster #21 mentioned that asians and other non-whites DO NOT HIRE blacks or integrate with  them for anything.  I keep saying this over and over, that this is one of our primary weapons to use to beat the diversity crowd with.  </p>
<p>Ask them why this is and pursue them on this issue until they are forced to start treating Asians, Arabs, Turks, latinos, etc like they treat whites.  Force them to have hiring quotas for blacks, force integration of blacks into their new enclaves, force them to acknowledge their racism.  I could go on but you get the point.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s turn up the heat on their own hypocrisy so they are forced to crumble in the face of their inconsistencies.</p>

		<p>Anonymous Poster 21, Jay:</p>
<p>I am not sure this is totally accurate. I was in Philadelphia recently. I was walking by an Asian owned beauty parlor and I saw several Black women working there. </p>
<p>Here in St.Louis, there is a Indian man who owns a bookstore in my neighborhood and he has at least two Blacks working for him.</p>

		<p>To poster #30, of course there are exceptions to every rule.  I live on the east coast and my observation holds true where I&rsquo;m at.  It&rsquo;s really, really segregated here.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, why would a korean owned beauty shop in a black area like philly have a couple of black female employees?  Because the customers are black.  That&rsquo;s tokenism as a good business practice.  </p>
<p>The Indian guy has two blacks but they may not be african american black.  Could be guyanese black or others.  Otherwise, as soon as latinos show up,the indian guy will dump his black workers for them.</p>
