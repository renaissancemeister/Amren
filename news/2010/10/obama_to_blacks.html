			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Wall Street Journal, October 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Appearing on the Rev. Al Sharpton&rsquo;s national radio show, Keeping It Real, Mr. Obama outlined a record on health care and other measures that he said helped minority and low-income communities.</p>
<p>&#8220;So even though your name isn&rsquo;t on the ballot, this is about your agenda and about the progress we&rsquo;ve seen you begin to make over the past 20-odd months?&#8221; asked Mr. Sharpton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Absolutely,&#8221; Mr. Obama said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;If we don&rsquo;t have strong leaders who are supportive of this agenda, who are supportive of moving the country forward, and instead we have folks who want to move backwards to the same failed policies that got us into this mess in the first place, then it&rsquo;s going to be very difficult for me to keep making progress and do what folks want to see me do over the next two years,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Democrats have been trying to mobilize black voters, who turned out in big numbers for Mr. Obama in 2008. But like other core party voters, they have been less excited this year. The president&rsquo;s approval ratings have dropped considerably but remain consistently high among African-Americans. In recent months, the White House has turned to Mr. Sharpton as a key surrogate to push back against some black critics who have complained that the country&rsquo;s first black president was not doing enough to help his fellow blacks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Sharpton and other black leaders will hold a conference call tonight with the president and supporters to reiterate the importance of voter turnout.</p>

		<p>While it is not true in politics like it is in Newtonian physics that every action results in an equal and opposite reaction, Barack Obama and his party probably lost more white votes just by &#8220;virtue&#8221; of being on the Al Sharpton show than he and it would have gained by ginning up black voters who listen.  And not all blacks that listen to Sharpton are that thrilled with Obama these days   &mdash;   a big schism between Sharpton and some of his listeners opened up over AZ SB 1070.  Sharpton being against it, as he will never have to worry about actually working for a living, and some of his listeners for it, as illegal Hispanics compete with domestic blacks in certain job categories.</p>

		<p>Under the guise of voting for issues (none mentioned), Obama/Sharpton advocate voting for Obama through his proxies.  Cute.  What they are really saying is VOTE BLACK.  Your vote for me, Obama the black, can be faithfully generalized to my designees.  Vote for me on color, vote my guys for I with my color endorse them.</p>

		<p>Yes, I think it&rsquo;s important for all of us to remember that it&rsquo;s Obama&rsquo;s agenda on the ballot as well. And we should judge that agenda by the company he keeps. He sat in Jeremiah Wright&rsquo;s &#8220;church&#8221; for 20 years and his home is in the same neighborhood as NOI founder Louis Farrakahn. Coincidence? Maybe. But according to mainstream news sources he&rsquo;s had NOI members on his campaign staff and at one time claimed that he not only attended the 1995 million man march but <i>organized</i> it as well. So, yes, let&rsquo;s ALL remember that Obama&rsquo;s agenda is at stake this election.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re still using the phrase, &#8216;keeping it real&rsquo;? Shouldn&rsquo;t it be &#8216;keep the stereotypes alive&rsquo;?</p>
<p>One man&rsquo;s progressive agenda is another man&rsquo;s road to serfdom.</p>

		<p>I just want to assure Obama that I definitely will be voting this November 2, exactly as if he was, in fact, on the ballot.</p>
<p>I suspect a rather large number of people will be.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Obama to Blacks: Vote Like I&rsquo;m on the Ballot&#8221;</p>
<p>His arrogance is absolutely amazing.</p>
<p>It sounds like this might be another gaffe by him, because it just might resonate with whites, and if they vote like he was on the ballot there&rsquo;s going to be even fewer Democrats in Congress.</p>

		<p>Well, we&rsquo;ve got it from the horse&rsquo;s (patootie&rsquo;s) mouth.  Obama&rsquo;s agenda has been all about giving to the black man and ripping off the white man.  He has defined what he means by &#8220;redistributing the wealth&#8221; and he has clearly stated it means taking from working White folks and giving more freebies to Blacks.  Every white should remember that come election day 2010 and 2012.  Any White voting for Obama or his liberal minions should be considered nothing less than Traitors to America and the White Race.  EVERY white who votes that way.  Consider them traitors, and treat them as social pariahs.  Give them NO business.  Do NOT associate with them socially.  Do NOT donate to their causes.  Do NOT sit next to them in church.  Do NOT remain a member of a church where such can be found.  Join NONE of their clubs, associations, or such.  And allow NONE of them into yours.  As soon as you meet one anywhere, and he self-identifies, tell him flat out he is a traitor to his race and his country and walk away having nothing more to do with him.  If we all did that, these DWL&rsquo;s would be shunned by the entire country and have to make a choice - return to the White fold in repentance and change their ways - or live with and associate with the Blacks they worship but otherwise refuse to live around.</p>

WE WILL INDEED VOTE AS THOUGH YOUR NAME WAS ON EVERY ISSUE, AND EVERY BALLOT.<br>
You should start packing your bags now, and planning your retirement. Your DemoKrat buddies will be waiting for you!<br>

<p>And which party is trying to mobilize <i>White</i> voters?  Oh, I forgot   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s <i>Evil Racism</i> to single out White people for anything except criticism.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Mr. Sharpton as a key surrogate to push back against some black critics who have complained that the country&rsquo;s first black president was not doing enough to help his fellow blacks.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>And who had complained that the &#8220;country&rsquo;s first black president&#8221; isn&rsquo;t doing enough to help <i>Whites?</i>  Who would dare?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Mr. Sharpton and other black leaders will hold a conference call tonight with the president and supporters to reiterate the importance of voter turnout.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t suppose any <i>White</i> leaders will be holding any conference calls with Obongo to reiterate anything at all.</p>
<p>The racial double standards are so flagrant that no one could possibly mistake them for anything else.  And yet insane percentages of amerikan Whites keep on closing their eyes, time after time.</p>

		<p>I already plan to vote like the big O is on the ballot: everyone in any way associated with that traitor will automatically be voted against.</p>
<p>The sheer &#8216;Audacity of [his] Self Worth&rsquo; is blindingly clear. And the repeated appearances on black or Hispanic media outlets as opposed the the number of serious white or national outlets boggle the mind and clearly reflect his racial bias. Oh, he makes the goofy Jon Stewart or equivalent appearances, which totally affronts (what should be) the dignity of office. However, he refuses to take part in any serious interviews or appearances with any group that would hold him accountable or intelligently challenge his lack of transparency, his methods or his intentions. </p>

		<p>Keeping it real is the name of a radio show for the delusional race baiter fat al (formerly fat), please, call a halt to the charade now.</p>
<p>My country gets darker skinned, and with each president it gets farther behind achievers throughout the world, overall the country becomes less civil, less inhabital, and yet we are to vote for another fraud. Brown skinned people commit over 90% of all gun crimes, and easily represent inarticulate, uncivil, government dependent cretins.</p>
<p>By all circumstances I will vote (have already voted early).  Not for fat al or anyone fat al knows.</p>

		<p>Georgia Resident #13, welcome. It&rsquo;s good to have a neighbor here.</p>
<p>After the news program tallies over the past week or so, I must say I&rsquo;m literally giddy enough to dance in the streets if it truly come to pass that Nancy Pelosi and her airliner full of Botox is unseated. It ain&rsquo;t a done deal yet, but it sure is looking hopeful! If she and Harry Reid are surgically separated, in addition to a number of other seats lost to the Republicans the Big O will be feeling a tad vulnerable. The more uncomfortable he becomes the more I like it. Republicans aren&rsquo;t the answer, but getting those particular Dems out ARE.</p>
