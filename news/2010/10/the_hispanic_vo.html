			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steven A. Camarota and Ashley Monique Webster, Center for Immigration Studies, October 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Some commentators have argued that the failure of Congress to pass &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform,&#8221; coupled with Arizona&rsquo;s new enforcement efforts, will increase Hispanic turnout in the upcoming midterm elections. More recently, others have argued that these same issues will dampen Hispanic turnout. This Memorandum provides a means for evaluating these arguments by examining the Hispanic voting trends in past midterm elections and projecting what their turnout might be next week based on data from the Census Bureau. Once the election is over, the extent to which Hispanic turnout follows or deviates from past patterns can be used to evaluate if this was an unusual election with regard to Hispanics.</p>
<p>Among the findings:</p>
<p>* On average, 31.8 percent of Hispanic citizens (18+) voted in the 2002 and 2006 midterm elections, compared to 48 percent of non-Hispanic whites and 42 percent of non-Hispanic blacks.</p>
<p>* The extent to which Hispanics differ from the historical average (31.8 percent Â± 1.7), will be an indication of how energized they were in 2010.</p>
<p>* Polling of Hispanics indicates that immigration is not one of their most important issues.</p>
<p>* Only 28.2 percent of Hispanic voters in the 2008 election were immigrants themselves. Moreover, just 14.3 percent of Hispanic voters in 2008 lived in the same household as a non-citizen.</p>
<p>* The lack of direct personal experience with immigration may explain why the issue does not rank higher in importance to Hispanic voters.</p>
<p>* Based on past patterns, we project that Hispanics will comprise 6.8 percent of the electorate in November 2010. This is a reduction from 7.4 percent in the 2008 presidential election, but is an increase from 5.8 percent in the last off-year election in 2006.</p>
<p>* The Hispanic share of the overall vote in 2010 is a more indirect measure of their enthusiasm because it partly depends on turnout among other groups. If Hispanic participation is average, but participation among non-Hispanic is above average, then the Hispanic share of the vote will be smaller even though their turnout was not unusually low.</p>
<p>* We project that Hispanics in November 2010 will comprise 14 percent of the total adult (18+) population and 9.3 percent of the adult citizen population.</p>
<p>* Hispanics comprise a much smaller percentage of voters than they do of the overall adult population because a large share (37.7 percent) of adult Hispanics are not citizens. Also Hispanic citizens register and vote at somewhat lower rates than other groups.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Hispanic Vote in 2010</p>
<p>{snip} Erin Pangilinan, a prominent blogger for the progressive website Change.org, suggests that Democrats should be worried about midterm elections given a large Latino voter block that has the potential to decide the outcome in many swing states that helped carry Obama in the 2008 Presidential election.2 Miami Herald columnist Andres Oppenheimer has argued that, &#8220;The projected turnout among Hispanics is not high: There is disappointment in the Obama administration, and disillusionment with the economy.&#8221;3</p>
<p>Simon Rosenberg, president of the New Democrat Network, a center-left think tank, thinks that &#8220;the Latino vote in 2010 will still be overwhelmingly Democratic, but it will be a smaller share of the electorate than in the last two elections.&#8221;4 The New York Times, citing a Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press poll argued that Latino turnout is likely to lag given that only 51 percent of Latino registered voters said they would absolutely go to the polls, compared with 70 percent of all registered voters.5</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hispanic Turnout in Past Elections</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Immigration Issue. The Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press poll cited above found that Hispanic voters ranked immigration fifth in importance after education, jobs, healthcare, and the federal deficit. As Mark Lopez of the Hispanic Center points out: &#8220;Immigration does not rank as a top voting issue for Hispanics.&#8221;8 A Zogby poll from February of this year found that when asked if they favored enforcement and illegal immigrants going home or putting illegals on a path to citizenship, 52 percent of Hispanic likely voters favored enforcement, and just 32 percent favored citizenship.9 The fact that immigration is not a top issue for Hispanics and that pro-enforcement views are common defies the stereotypes of this population. This does not mean that immigration is completely unimportant to Hispanics. The Zogby poll found that Hispanics are more favorable toward amnesty for illegal immigrants than is the general public. What these results do mean is that other issues matter more than immigration and Hispanic views on the issue do not fit the stereotype often ascribed to them.</p>
<p>This is not surprising when one considers that only 28.2 percent of Hispanic voters in the 2008 election were immigrants themselves. The overwhelming majority of Hispanic voters were born in this country. Second, in 2008, only 14.3 of Hispanic voters lived in the same household as a non-citizen.10 It is the non-citizen population that has the most direct interest in changing the nation&rsquo;s immigration system because it includes illegal immigrants and others on temporary visas who might like to stay permanently, but cannot do so under the current system. In the Current Population Survey, about half of non-citizens are illegal immigrants. The large share of Hispanic voters who do not have a direct personal experience with immigration may help explain why the issue often ranks relatively low in importance for this population.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>This report establishes a baseline for judging how engaged Hispanics will be this election cycle. Prior voting trends indicate that about one-third of eligible Hispanic voters participate in midterm elections. The extent to which the Hispanic vote differs from the expected pattern can be taken as an indication of how engaged they are this election cycle. Although immigration is of concern to Hispanic voters, prior research indicates that it is not one of their top concerns. It must be remembered that the vast majority of Hispanic voters are not immigrants themselves. Thus, it seems unlikely that this issue by itself will cause Hispanic turnout to be particularly high or low in the election next week. Once data are available from the November 2010 CPS, however, this question will be answered.</p>

		<p>I think the immigration issue - favoring amnesty for illegals - is probably a bigger deal among those of Mexican ancestry, or among  the political lefty elitists (like the Puerto Rican Defense fund), who think they can increase &#8220;their&#8221; political base, than the average Latino or Hispanic citizen.</p>

		<p>The blue collar and poor Mexicans, Puerto Ricans and Salvadorans want the same thing blacks want: govt handouts with no contribution like taxes, public service or efforts to go to school after high school to improve skills. The illegals for the most part don&rsquo;t vote, but want the goodies from Uncle Sucker anyway. Where liberals rule, the illegals will get the vote, the food stamps, the medicaid. They all get extra services in the public schools which are forbidden by our wise Supreme Court from throwing illegal nonresidents of school districts out on their little behinds. </p>
<p>This is one major reason by the way why Mr. International, our Prez., wants to significantly handout more federal education money, so Spanish language groups get free meals and services through the schools which do everything but teach basic English, math and US history these days. The schools will also provide a physical base for community organizing of the Spanish oriented groups. Hm. Once an organizer, always an organizer?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m going to make a prediction that sounds radical on its face&hellip;.but only because of how good a job the media has done spinning this issue.</p>
<p>The hispanic vote will be what it has been in years past (with regard to turnout&hellip;.average).  And hispanics will skew more heavily republican this year.</p>
<p>Here is the controversial part.  The reason they will skew republican will be a hope that the republicans will get tough on the immigration issue.</p>
<p>The reason its controversial is the media has completely lied about the position the average spanish speaking voter has on this issue.  The term, hispanic, itself is misleading&hellip;.implying solidarity between spanish speaking voters and immigrants.</p>
<p>Let me tell you what the reality is.  The reality is that spanish speaking people in the US are mostly bi-lingual and difficult to tell apart from other Americans.  We have communities where most people are related to one another and clustered mostly because of travel availability to other family who live in puerto rico.  The average spanish speaking voter is of conservative bent because of extreme hostility to communists who attempted to disrupt family and civil life in puerto rico over the last few generations.  Military service, multi-generational, is the norm&hellip;.as is the consideration of leftists as traitors.  Devotion to Christ and the church is the norm.  Anger at drugs, gangs, prostitution and any other anti-social behavior is the norm&hellip;..and not tolerated to the extent control of the neighborhood is in the hands of white spanish speaking people.  I&rsquo;ll leave it up to your imagination as to what that means.</p>
<p>And here is the standard view of immigrants.  They are all criminals&hellip;.rapists, murderers and thieves.  Evil people whose ONLY similarity to spanish speaking Americans is the ability to sort of speak spanish (think ebonics, if you want to know how these people are speaking).  They come to spanish speaking neighborhoods and do the lions share of raping, murdering and robbing among US.  Identity theft is such a problem that puerto rico had to basically cancel all birth certificates and start from scratch.</p>
<p>Now I ask you.  If YOU had such experiences&hellip;would YOU be pro-immigrant? What would you think if you regularly saw yourself portrayed as pro-immigrant by the media.  If you were lumped in with these  criminals and the democrats came by asking for your vote.</p>
<p>How would YOU vote in the upcoming election?  Why?</p>
<p>Now you know why I predict what I do for &#8220;hispanics&#8221; in the upcoming election.  I feel pretty confident in that prediction.</p>

		<p>3 Anonymous:</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think your prediction is either radical or crazy.  In fact, historical evidence backs it up.</p>
<p>The Hispanic voting demographic mirrors the white voting demographic in terms of partisan swing, though Hispanics will always vote more Democrat than whites.  What I mean by that is if whites vote more Republican in one election compared to the previous one, Hispanics will also vote more Republican.  If the white swing is to Democrats, the Hispanic swing will be to Democrats.</p>
<p>The Hispanic vote for Republicans will be greater in 2010 compared to 2008, simply because the white vote for Republicans will be greater in 2010 compared to 2008.  (Again, the white percentage for Republicans will be way higher than the Hispanic percentage for Republicans).  Whenever a Republican loses a Presidential election, (e.g. McCain, Dole), open borders spokesmouths in the Wall Street Journal like to mouth off about how it&rsquo;s the fault of the party being &#8220;anti-immigrant&#8221; (even though both Dole and McCain are for open borders and amnesty).  The reality is that they were weak Republicans.  Notice that between Dole and McCain, Bush (43) won two national elections, he&rsquo;s just as open borders as the other two, and got a higher Hispanic percentage in 2000 than Dole in 1996, and Bush in 2004 got a better Hispanic percentage than Bush in 2000.  But both white and Hispanic numbers for Republicans went South in 2008 compared to 2004.</p>
<p>The whole caveat to this is that Hispanics never give a majority to a Republican.  Bush got 35% in 2004, the high water mark, but that stat was bolstered by Hispanics in Texas (his state) and Florida (Jeb&rsquo;s state plus Cubans).  And the last time whites didn&rsquo;t give a majority of their Presidential votes to a Republican was LBJ in 1964.</p>
<p>In contrast, blacks are almost monolithic Democrat voting blocs   &mdash;   The only X-factor with blacks is absolute turnout, and/or their ability and desire to commit voter fraud.</p>

		<p>The left almost always quotes population percentages of Hispanics rather than the voting-eligible percent or likely turnout.  This article states the latter as 6.8%.  All whites have to do is come out in large numbers.  And all the GOP has to do in 2012 is put a VP candidate who is Latino on the ticket.  The Dems, saddled with Obama, won&rsquo;t want a ticket with two non-whites.</p>

		<p>The problem with this &#8216;closet Republican&rsquo; approach is that Hispanics tend not to jump on bandwagons that are already loaded down with other partisan issues.  They play things low-key because they want to avoid being spotlighted by the majority while minorities yet themselves.</p>
<p>In this case, any Republican who makes immigration a serious &#8216;close the borders and chuck&rsquo;em all out!&rsquo; precondition of his campaign agenda, whether honestly or just to buy outer-right whites, is going to also impose on himself (in Hispanic&rsquo;s eyes) a wait-and-see penalty of what happens to Hispanics in general as a consequence to rising racial dominance issues.</p>
<p>And anti-immigrant attitudes in the U.S. _would_ shift towards open and wide scale hostility if it became obvious that this was a &#8216;popular&rsquo; (= permissible) shared belief because of the sense of pent frustration that this has been put off for political reasons for so long.</p>
<p>i.e. for whites too, there will be a degree of &#8216;show me!&rsquo; Missouri proofing that goes with any promise.</p>
<p>If a democratic mob-rule condition builds after these midterms, it will reflect, very badly, on Hispanic attitudes in the &#8216;important&rsquo; 2012 elections.  Divorcing them from any further tailchasing of the white voter swing, possibly forever.</p>
<p>Which may not be a bad thing.  I&rsquo;m with the Sailer Strategy of opening up more white voting blocks than I am trying to convince Hispanics that Republicans/Conservatives are not all out for their hides.  Because in the end, I think we may have no choice.</p>
<p>But even were I not, I think the best you can hope for is a 2012 effect based on what is shown in the post-2010 outcomes as far as racial consciousness and sense of fairness or imminent oppression goes.</p>
<p>La Raza as an attitude _does exist_.  It is dormant until threatened but you need only look at the Hispanic&rsquo;s ability to rally and organize marches against various local Propositions to understand that it is a powerful (more powerful than white RC because it&rsquo;s not seen as Nazist) influence for them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the real danger here folks.  Hispanics are quiet when they have to be.  And noisy when they know they must be.  But what will they be when, having patiently waited, they are a plurality and then majority element of our population as birth rates indicate they are -going- to be?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s human nature to throw one&rsquo;s weight around when they have the numbers to back the stones in doing so.  And with an eye toward Mexico and her problems, I don&rsquo;t see Hispanics as having the right mental stuff to keep our society going at the level it is now sufficient to trust their future politics based on their present lack of presence on the field.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t reverse their numbers gains, dramatically and permanently, we will regret it.  And that process has to begin _now_.  Or it will be too late.</p>
