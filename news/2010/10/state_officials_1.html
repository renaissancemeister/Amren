<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>California officials are cutting off use of state-issued welfare debit cards at casinos across the country and on cruise ships, in the wake of Times reports that the aid cards have been used to spend or withdraw millions of dollars in benefits at popular vacation spots including the Las Vegas strip and on ships sailing from ports around the world.</p>
<p>More than $69 million meant to help the needy pay their rent and clothe their children was accessed in all 49 other states, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam, according to data obtained by The Times from the California Department of Social Services.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Department of Social Services Director John Wagner said the move is part of the Schwarzenegger administration&rsquo;s commitment to &#8220;rooting out waste, fraud and abuse in these programs&#8221; and &#8220;to ensure these resources are going to the people they are intended for.&#8221;</p>
<p>In June, the state cut off access to benefits in California casinos and strip clubs after The Times reported that the Electronic Benefits Transfer cards worked in those businesses too.<br>

								<h2><a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/20101004/NEWS/101009812/1350?p=all&amp;tc=pgall">$69M in Calif. Welfare Money Spent Out of State</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Press Democrat (Santa Rosa), Oct. 4, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Nearly $69 million in welfare money meant to help California&rsquo;s neediest families has been spent or withdrawn in places like Hawaii, Las Vegas casinos and cruise ships from Miami.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Data showed the biggest chunk of out-of-state money  &mdash;  $11.8 million  &mdash;  was spent at casinos or withdrawn from ATMs in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The investigation showed out-of-state spending on state-issued aid cards was less than 1 percent of the $10.8 billion spent by welfare recipients during the three years.</p>
<p>State-issued aid cards were used at hotels, shops, restaurants, ATMs or other places in every state, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam, the data showed.</p>
<p>A single parent with two children must earn less than $14,436 to qualify for the cards, designed to help pay the rent and buy clothes for the kids, said Lizelda Lopez, a spokeswoman for the Department of Social Services.</p>
<p>In Hawaii, $387,908 was used or withdrawn at more than a thousand big-box stores, grocery stores, convenience shops and ATMs on all the major islands. At least $234,000 was accessed on Oahu, $70,626 on Maui, $39,883 on Hawaii and $22,170 on Kauai.</p>
<p>The list includes $12,433 spent at the upscale Ala Moana shopping center, $3,030 spent at a group of gift shops next to Jimmy Buffett&rsquo;s Beachcomber restaurant on Waikiki Beach and $2,146 withdrawn from ATMs on the island of Lanai, home to a pair of Four Seasons resorts and little else, the Times said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&rsquo;s on Lanai, that should trigger an investigation,&#8221; said Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association. &#8220;California taxpayers, who are struggling to keep their own jobs, are subsidizing other people&rsquo;s vacations. That&rsquo;s absurd.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of the money accessed in Las Vegas, more than $1 million was spent or withdrawn at shops and casino hotels on or near the famous Strip. The list includes $8,968 at the Tropicana, $7,995 at the Venetian and its Grand Canal Shoppes, and $1,332 at Tix 4 Tonight, seller of discount admission for such acts as Cirque du Soleil, the data showed.</p>
<p>Many Las Vegas casinos block the use of welfare cards in ATMs located on gambling floors, but more than $34,700 was used to get ATM cash or goods at a 7-Eleven near the Encore and Circus Circus casinos.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The paper said $16,010 was withdrawn from 14 cruise ships sailing from ports around the world.</p>
<p>There are legitimate reasons to spend aid money outside of California, advocates said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think when somebody hears it&rsquo;s in a fancy hotel in Hawaii or Vegas, it&rsquo;s too easy to assume the (welfare recipient) is visiting that place and it wasn&rsquo;t somebody who stole their card,&#8221; said Jessica Bartholow, a legislative advocate for the Western Center on Law and Poverty.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&rsquo;s a one-time thing in Miami, we would never check that out,&#8221; said John Haley, commander of the financial crimes division of the San Diego County district attorney&rsquo;s office, who said 24 percent of all new welfare applications in his jurisdiction contain some form of fraud. &#8220;We look for patterns of abuse.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The last sentence of the article is shocking; &#8220;&hellip; John Haley, commander of the financial crimes division of the San Diego County district attorney&rsquo;s office, who said 24 percent of all new welfare applications in his jurisdiction contain some form of fraud.&#8221;  You don&rsquo;t get such high numbers of detected fraud if the applicants didn&rsquo;t think it was easy pickings. </p>

		<p>The biggest racial turmoil on our future, or maybe the flash point, will be the violent reaction of the welfare state afrothuggocray when cuts, bankruptcy, or collapse cut off their free goodies.  They won&rsquo;t tolerate allowing White Humanity to keep anything we&rsquo;ve earned when they don&rsquo;t get what we&rsquo;ve helped them to become accustomed to.    </p>
<p>Transcend Diversity- Embrace Whiteness- Beware and Prepare.  You know what&rsquo;s coming&hellip;</p>
<p>Look for White Humanity to stop supporting social institutions over the next few years. Why would you invest in something that will live beyond only to have it either handed over or taken over by the black-brown-mongrel-mulatto majority of our future?</p>
<p>Will a mongrel army really fight so we can keep our White Privilege and pass it on to our posterity in the form of inheritance?</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t give to anything anymore.  Why would I?  It&rsquo;s a scam to shake me down for the benefit of my mongrel enemies.  Let the fundraisers go to Jesus for the money.<br>

<p><br>
And what exactly will they do about it?  Living segregated in all black neighborhoods with only the food we choose to ship in to them in return for money we give them&hellip;..ditto for the gasoline in their cars and even the bullets in any guns they might illegally own&hellip;..not to mention the money that goes for all the crack they are doing.</p>
<p>Blacks are violent and attack whites because we give them these things.  They are not held in check by giving them these things.  If that institution collapses, they will be doing nothing about it except, perhaps, burning down their own neighborhoods&hellip;..and then dying.</p>
<p>One things blacks do not have&hellip;..the ability to take by force what we have been giving them out of the largess of our hearts.</p>
<p>That is something that is going to become VERY clear if race war becomes overt (ie whites acknowledge the race war already going on and respond).</p>

		<p>Well, I have read the original articles, and I am still not sure who is committing the welfare abuse. Is it the recepients of welfare, or someone who is supposed to disperse the money to them but did not (and spent it on cruise ships), or did the welfare recepients somehow sell their benefits for God knows what?</p>
<p>But I suppose it does not matter  &mdash;  the money of Whites was thrown down the sewer, courtesy of our government.</p>
<p>A pox on them all.  </p>

		<p>2-Odin: I agree 100 percent. Cash welfare has caused great harm to the Nation. Fraud is rampant and welfare in general does more to keep people in poverty than to lift them into the middle class. A slow decrease in the amount of payments might prevent the conflict you describe, but I don&rsquo;t see any move in that direction. As for giving to charity, I too have ceased to give as I now believe most of the funding goes to either &#8220;administrators&#8221; or to otherwise enhance the racheting effect, which when combined with immigration to the U.S., is working to hasten our own demise. </p>

		<p>I agree with #2 - the reckoning will come when the flowing fountain of white goodies drops down to a trickle before drying up completely. I don&rsquo;t think it will be as disastrous as others claim but it will be ugly and ultimately for the better.</p>
<p>The mongrels and blacks are unable to organize and think - so they&rsquo;re helpless. There may initially be sporadic episodes of violence - the key is for authorities (and private citizens) to respond immediately and without regard for what is PC.</p>
<p>Eventually, blacks will retreat into segregated zones and either make or break themselves as a functioning part of society. I believe blacks don&rsquo;t really care where they live or what they have - they just bumble along and exist in their own reality. When they see they cannot milk the system any longer - and the system is standing up to their childish whining - things might actually get better.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;$7,995 at the Venetian and its Grand Canal Shoppes&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I never stay at the Venetian, it is too expensive.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t surprise me  &mdash;  what I find more surprising is that the LA Times, ever promotors of keeping the border wide open and champion of illegal immigrants, reported this.</p>
<p>They must be getting desperate.</p>
<p>My closed-shop union is conducting a boycott of the LA Times because the rag printed the names of teachers along with a composite of their students&rsquo; test scores.</p>
<p>One teacher allegedly committed suicide last week after finding his name and dismal score in the LA Times  &mdash;  a score the school board is threatening to use to fire/demote us teachers.</p>
<p>Lately, I am receiving offers in the mail, and in the school mail, for huge discounts off of LA Times subscriptions  &mdash;  including piles of up to 20 LA Times, delivered free (and free to me), daily, right to my classroom door.</p>
<p>On the EBT card issue:  LA&rsquo;s economy is cash-based.  I was having my car tuned up a few months ago, had just arrived home when the head mechanic called.  He said (in very broken English) if I brought in cash, he wouldn&rsquo;t charge me state income tax  &mdash;  he paid all of his vendors in cash and this was how he did business.</p>
<p>As I was having a major tune-up (around $900) the exorbitant California state tax tacked amounted to approximately $90.  I won&rsquo;t say what I did, but as I love saving money, the choice wasn&rsquo;t difficult.</p>
<p>It seems a lot of business around here IS conducted in this manner, a la the Third World, but then LA and its surrounding environs ARE Third World countries.</p>
<p>So, as business is conducted via cash, the denizens of LA collect welfare benefits via the EBT card, a welfare ATM card funded by the taxpayers of California  &mdash;  a card used to fund gambling at high end casinos in Las Vegas, pay for vacations on cruise ships traveling all over the world, luxury resorts in Hawaii.</p>
<p>The LA Times solution?  Nutmeg and Moonbeam&rsquo;s solution?  According to them, immigrants, illegal or otherwise, are what keep the California economy flowing  &mdash;  and we need more immigrants to keep the economy &#8216;growing&rsquo; as the working population (us Whites) ages (or flees, as is the case).</p>
<p>The welfare economy, that is.</p>
<p>Enough Said.</p>

		<p>Peanuts compared to the bank bailout scam.</p>
<p>No&hellip;.it&rsquo;s not.  The bank bailout only involved money.  A quick default on the national debt, followed up by dissolving the fed and a congress that prints its own debt free money would absolutely destroy the people you are talking about, while dramatically improving the US economy&hellip;.permanently.  Most people would not even notice the change&hellip;.except for all the new jobs.  Google &#8220;The Money Masters&#8221; and spend 4 hours or so watching this documentary.  It&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>Welfare, on the other hand, blights whole communities.  Has destroyed many cities more effectively than atomic weapons.  Created many no-go zones for whites, not only in the US but every other white nation.  Millions of whites have been raped, robbed, murdered and beaten because of it.  TENS of millions of white babies have been aborted because whorish white women abuse the same system to avoid correction by white husbands and fathers who would not otherwise allow their behaviors&hellip;.especially miscegenation.</p>
<p>Welfare&hellip;..is the source of everything a white nationalist has a problem with.  It is also a horrible weakness for our enemies, however.  Get rid of it, and everything they&rsquo;ve worked for the last hundred years or so, disappears in a puff of smoke.</p>
<p>Getting rid of it should be a priority.  A nuclear first strike for a white nationalist takeover.</p>

		<p>You can see it happening in all of the larger cities..Lots of the charities that serve primarily blacks, that help pay their bills, supply them with extra food, are begging for help. The constantly shrinking working class are tapped out..we&rsquo;ve got no more to give!! What we need is to take the billions we are wasting on people who may never become tax paying citizens, and create jobs repairing our roads, power lines, sewers, bridges, etc.  This country is falling apart, and theres no money in most city budgets.  If the &#8220;poor&#8221; need money, let them work fixing the country.<br>
Of course, it&rsquo;s &#8220;racist&#8221; to expect  everyone to work for their money.</p>
