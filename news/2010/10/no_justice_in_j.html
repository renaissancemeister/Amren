<h1>No Justice in Justices&rsquo; Comments on Black Criminality</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jerry Large, Seattle Times, October 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most recently it was a couple of Washington State Supreme Court justices who offered their opinions on black criminality. Richard Sanders and James Johnson said black people are overrepresented in the prison system strictly because we commit more crimes and that discrimination in the system is not a contributing factor. Apparently there is no bias when the people deciding your fate assume from the get-go that you are inclined toward criminality.</p>
<p>I prefer intelligent, nuanced, sensitive comments myself, but what really bothers me are the underlying inequalities that are so much harder to address than a single person&rsquo;s attitude. That&rsquo;s the stuff we can and should fix.</p>
<p>I would have amended the judges&rsquo; remarks on crime by saying that sometimes circumstances increase the rates of certain crimes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Black people have higher poverty rates than most Americans and higher poverty is associated with higher crime rates. That effect is aggravated by longterm poverty and bias.</p>
<p>More equality of opportunity would change that formula.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Black Americans have been especially hard hit, facing biases that keep poverty high.</p>
<p>Poverty and racial biases reinforce each other.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If on top of that, employers are reluctant to hire you even when you are qualified, then you may go long stretches without wealth. You may find other avenues for income. A 2004 Princeton University study showed that employers are more likely to hire white ex-cons than black men with clean records.</p>
<p>If this situation lasts for generations, you may not have the same family or community support for climbing out of this hole that someone else might have. You can predict school performance by family income and the mother&rsquo;s educational level.</p>
<p>You may have more health problems, including more mental-health problems, which will affect both your ability to get work and your behavior in general.</p>
<p>You may get into trouble with the law. And if, when arrested, you are more likely to be convicted and imprisoned than other people, you may re-enter society with less chance of success than before.</p>
<p>And what about the kids you left behind? And what about the neighborhood? Does it decline?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Break this cycle, and we will all live in a less distorted and more pleasant place.</p>

		<p>Questions for Mr. Large:</p>
<p>1.  Have you ever heard of affirmative action?</p>
<p>2.  There are two people.  One is white, and the other is black.  Both have IQs of 95.  Both are born into single parent households of the same economic circumstance.  Now, be honest with me   &mdash;   Tell me which person will have more opportunities thrown at him or her throughout their lives?</p>
<p>He is right that there should be more equality of opportunity.  But the way to do is to create more for whites and/or less for blacks.</p>

		<p>Middle class and upper class avoid lower class.  Middle class blacks and upper class blacks avoid lower class blacks.  People who have learned to enjoy the fruits of law and order, avoid those that are lawless and disorderly.  People tend to avoid socially and professionally those that have behavior problems.  The tragedy is that lower socio-economic blacks are stereotyped along with their ill-behaved neighbors.  It is those aspiring blacks that should be angry at their crime-sodden neighbors for it harms all who are in near proximity to them.  People of all color discriminate against violent peoples.  Fair or not, it just is.  And no law over time will remove that fundamental human trait.</p>

<p>If this country is so &#8220;racist&#8221; in favor of Whites, why are so many Whites living in misery?&hellip;and more important, why aren&rsquo;t Whites committing a staggering amount of violent interracial crime?</p>

		<p>Interesting if rather worn commentary.  Apparently black Africans are unique among all races in being unable to shake the yoke of discrimination.  And their failures are universal, even when they control whole cities or countries.  Everybody is aligned against them everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Amazing how the Chinese just announced the fastest supercomputer extant.  Of course, they enjoyed, umm, some clear benefits that nobody seems able to define.  And of course they&rsquo;re highly intelligent and industrious people.</p>

		<p>The author needs to take a drive across America, coast to coast.  Appalachia is one of the poorest regions in the United States yet it has one of the lowest crime rates.  This alone disproves his point that poverty is the culprit.  Blacks are prone to crime because it is part of their current day culture and this behavior is constantly being excused by the Left.<br>

<p>What would be news would be a student any where in the world, among the millions at university right now, setting out to study whites being disadvantaged compared to other races. They wouldn&rsquo;t have to look far. Wouldn&rsquo;t even have to leave university grounds, although a trip downtown to social services, where, ironically, they are doing all they can to fight &#8216;inequality&rsquo;, would be a good second stop.</p>

		<p>#5 - GetBackJack - You&rsquo;re exactly right. Whenever someone brings up the &#8220;poverty causes crime&#8221; nonsense, I always throw Appalachia in their face. Shuts them up fast. I would encourage all of you to have Appalachia in your arsenal of facts to confront the liberals/blacks when this subject is &#8220;discussed&#8221;. It&rsquo;s worth doing just to see the looks on their faces. </p>

		<p>My uncontrollable sobbing for those poor old discriminated against Black criminals is making it hard to type this comment. I had no idea that Blacks were doing all of that raping and robbing and murdering because they were poor. That makes it okay. We need to open up the prison gates the first thing in the morning so that justice can be served.</p>
<p>We should change our laws to permit Blacks to behave the same way their forefathers behaved in sub-Saharan Africa before African slavers rescued them by selling them to people who brought them over here . To be fair, we must also change our laws to permit Whites to behave the same way our forefathers behaved before the days of slavery in what would become America.</p>
<p>I am certain that these changes will rapidly eliminate all of our race problems in America.</p>

<i>&#8220;Poverty and racial biases reinforce each other.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Predictable racial behavior reinforces racial biases.</p>
<p>I get into the &#8216;crime and poverty&rsquo; argument all the time and I TRY to make people see that poverty does not cause crime, CRIME CAUSES POVERTY.</p>
<p>When crime is allowed to flourish, as it does in minority neighborhoods, businesses close and people with means get out leaving behind poverty.</p>
<p>Over the summer, we had a major shooting spree at a bar in downtown Buffalo. 8 blacks were shot, 4 died. The shootings had nothing to do with poverty. They did, however, have to do with crime. The Buffalo News did a story reporting that 7 of the 8 people involved had serious criminal records. (The black community went ballistic over that &#8216;racist&rsquo; report which forced the editor of the Buffalo News to attend a public forum to listen to blacks denounce her and her &#8216;racist&rsquo; newspaper. She dutifully apologized).</p>

<p>The white judges simply stated that blacks commit more crime - not that it is necessarily genetic.</p>
<p>But apparently Jerry Large thinks there is no bias when the people deciding your fate and steering public opinion believe from the get-go that you are responsible for the failings of others.<br>

		<p>The author states the usual suspects, maybe he could examine this:</p>
<p>1. Poverty.  If that were the case why didn&rsquo;t 50% of Americans kill each other during the great Depression?</p>
<p>2. Opportunity. Ever heard of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action, 45 years of preferences in hiring, school admissions and contract awards.</p>
<p>3. Racial Bias.  No one to blame but your own race.  Everywhere you find blacks in the world you find crime, poverty, drug abuse, single parent families, child abandonment, mental health issues and violence.</p>
<p>Try this one on for size: Personal Responsibility. Stop using crutches and blaming everything within the system; stop spouting 50 year old social ills like Jim Crow or slavery.  Everyone has hurdles in life and life is not fair, you either overcome the hurdles or sit around and blame others. Easy to see the path you and many like you have chosen.</p>

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t buy it anyway, but one of the things which makes Mr. Large&rsquo;s theories even more nonsensical than the usual is that this is Washington State, not Mississippi.  WA&rsquo;s liberal Democrats and neo-liberal Republicans have worked year in and year out and decade in and decade out to make all the pigs so equal that some of the pigs became more equal than the others.  The county which contains Seattle (King) went so far as to change its namesake from Vice-President William King to Martin Luther King.  And that needed state approval, since only the state can charter counties.  Approval it obviously got with no resistance.</p>
<p>AFAIK, Martin Luther King only spent one day in the state of Washington.  My guess is that he was stuck at Sea-Tac because his flight to some other place was delayed.</p>
<p>WA and race was in the news earlier this year because, in spite of the state government making it easier for convicted felons to vote, (before, you had to out of prison, through with your probation, and on schedule for your fine and restitution payments   &mdash;   What they changed was eliminating the fine/restitution part, meaning now all you need to be is out of prison and off probation, like most states), that wasn&rsquo;t enough for certain people   &mdash;   The 9th Circus ordered the state to allow imprisoned felons to vote because not letting them vote affects too many blacks.  </p>

		<p>Same old tired nonsense about &#8220;lack of opportunities&#8221;, blacks are provided plenty of opportunities and in fact colleges are bending over backwards to give them preferential treatment to attract them. The problem is lots of black people don&rsquo;t do anything with the opportunities that are presented to them instead electing to sit back and just yelp &#8220;racism&#8221; to excuse their behaviour and lack of achievement.</p>

<p>A drive across the history books would be even easier, and more revealing of Jerry&rsquo;s &#8220;Large&#8221; stupidity. What time in our history had the most poverty? Answer: the Great Depression. Long lines at soup kitchens, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooverville" rel="nofollow">&#8220;Hoovervilles,&#8221;</a> 25% unemployment   &mdash;   a truly dismal time. Now how much crime was there during that era? Answer: very little. In fact, crime was far worse during the &#8220;Roaring &rsquo;20s,&#8221; courtesy of Prohibition and the attendant black market.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s cross the Pacific and visit Japan, which has been mired in recession/depression for the last 20 years. Where&rsquo;s the crime wave there, Mr. &#8220;Large Ignorance&#8221;? Can&rsquo;t find it, eh? That&rsquo;s because blacks are something else you can&rsquo;t find in Japan, either.</p>
<p>In fact, Mr. &#8220;Large Idiocy&#8221; has cause and effect reversed. Poverty doesn&rsquo;t cause crime; crime causes poverty. When thugs drive decent people out of an area through violence and the threat of violence, businesses either flee themselves or go under. The downward spiral feeds on itself. Eventually you get Dallas, where about the only legitimate businesses in the black part of town are liquor stores and pawnshops. Or you get Detroit, where the remake of <i>Red Dawn</i> was recently filmed because after more than 30 years of black (mis)rule most of the town resembles a German or Japanese city after World War II.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Black Americans have been especially hard hit, facing biases that keep poverty high.&#8221;</p>
<p>The number of whites in poverty far exceeds the number of blacks, yet the black crime rate is many times greater than the white rate.</p>
<p>Likewise, black crime is greater than the Hispanic rate and there are more poor Hispanics than blacks.</p>
<p>The bottom line to all these feeble excuses and whining by the likes of these black cry babies is that they have higher crime rates than any other race in the country, because they are more prone to criminality and they are the least intelligent of all the races as well, so they&rsquo;re more apt to make bad decisions.</p>
<p>Too, their bad attitudes are fueled by jealousy at seeing other races succeed academically and in business, and they refuse to recognize that they have less ability and intelligence, preferring to blame whitey for their inability to succeed.  </p>
<p>Incitement within their communities by black demagogues, like Jeremiah Wright, who tell them all their problems are caused by whites, gives them the excuse they need to fail, and fuels their hatred and rage.  </p>
<p>As an example, consider Obasma who admitted he was unaware of the facts of the situation where an AA Harvard professor was legitimately arrested by a white policeman for being disorderly, loud and offensive, but said the police acted &#8220;stupidly&#8221; in the matter.  That, of course is certainly a form of incitement.  </p>
<p>It will continue to get worse until we can separate ourselves from these ignorant, unintelligent people and form our own black-free enclaves, either by secession or war.    </p>

		<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t commit significantly more crime because it&rsquo;s a part of their &#8220;culture&#8221;.<br>
It&rsquo;s a part of their culture because criminality is WHO THEY ARE.  It&rsquo;s in their DNA.<br>
The only difference between the black criminal and say, the middle class or upper class black is the NATURE of the crimes.  Sort of.  Some of the highest paid blacks in this country (sports figures) STILL murder, rape, rob, commit assault, shoot people, and behave in an uncivilized manner.  It isn&rsquo;t their &#8220;culture&#8221; i.e. environment that causes them to be criminal in nature.  it&rsquo;s their very nature that PRODUCES their culture of violence.  White men built Western civilization, made laws, instituted trial by jury, formed a constitution.  White men and ONLY white men are keeping the lid on American blacks, else America would be JUST LIKE AFRICA.  For now, Africa can only be found in black communities in America, but it&rsquo;s spreading outward as Whites become more cowardly and apologetic toward innate black uncivilized NATURE.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s time to quit agonizing over the causes of Black criminality.  We&rsquo;ve been pouring trillions of dollars into their communities for generations now, and the problems persist.  We should just accept the fact that Black communities have unique problems that Whites are completely unable to understand or fix.  We should quit flinging our money down that particular black hole, and further accept that association with Black America will continue to inflict their problems upon us, in perpetuity.</p>
<p>It is time to return to separation.  The US government needs to change our laws and policies so that those of us who wish to live in Whites-only communities are able to do so, in peace, without the government forcing diversity upon us.</p>
<p>It is the only solution that will work long term - let those who wish to live in diversity do so, and let the rest of us go our own way so that we can at last be free of the multicultural insanity and all of the problems that go along with it.</p>

		<p>OK so we have a 90% white victim rate for interracial crime and 70-80% of those crimes do NOT involve any robbery but are assaults and or rape. How does poverty cause this? CMON Jerry step up! <br>

		<p>Liberalism is American Nazism,  white people are its victims, the Democratic Party is its political front,  the media is its center of power,  black thugs are its stormtroopers, and the Feds are its Gestapo. </p>
<p>Blacks certainly tend to be more violent and criminal all over the world, but the main reason they are so violent and criminal in this country is that their violence is tolerated and encouraged by Liberalism.  It&rsquo;s a direct racist assault against white people and their culture.  What brown shirts were to Nazis black thugs (and increasingly other non-white thugs) are to Liberals.  Blacks are nothing in this system, they are mere tools.  The violence comes from the political Left.</p>

		<p>No one could possibly expect anything less from the controlled governmedia, especially a notorious liberal propaganda outlet like the <i>Seattle Times</i>.  What&rsquo;s sad is that so many media-hypnotized White amerikans not only go along with it, but are willing to ostracize their fellow Whites who don&rsquo;t toe the party line.<br>

		<p>What does the crime of rape have to do with poverty? Blacks are by far way overrepresented % wise in every crime, yes everyone from DUI&rsquo;s to serial killers. Many legit sites back that up but of course those are all bias, even the &#8220;FBI&#8221; one.</p>

		<p>Too many blacks are disadvantaged by other blacks - namely, their biological parents.  Then they grow up to be the same, and perpetuate the cycle.  Newcomer Asians, on the other hand, break out of poverty in one generation, by valuing education.</p>

		<p>I agree that poverty begets crime but low IQ begets poverty and it is _not_ &#8216;racism&rsquo; but genetics which gives blacks an 87 IQ in a world where, if you want to succeed in college and in white collar business and scientific vocations, you need a baseline 115 IQ, just to play the game.</p>
<p>Add to this regression to the mean in IQs between generations and even the 800,000 blacks who are well up there on the Bell Curve will have kids somewhere between their own IQ and the group average.  Whereas, the 30 million or so whites who are &#8216;gifted&rsquo; in the 115-120 range are also apt to generate more of these because our mean IQ is around 102 (the higher up the Bell Curve you start, the more genius your population group throws off, about 16% for whites, about 2.5% of blacks).</p>
<p>Black mean IQ, being the lowest of all the races, makes it almost impossible to sustain an improving standard of living because single generation improvements don&rsquo;t last, genetically.  And economically, those who would readily rely upon smart blacks among their own people are themselves not able to pay for the skillset so the asset leaves the community anyway.  Or wants to and is rejected by whites who wish to deal with their own.</p>
<p>That this economics-of-IQ deficit is tied to absent social conformity is proven by the fact that 6% of this nation&rsquo;s population (black males between 12 and 25) commit 52% of our murders and 40% of it&rsquo;s violent property crime.  And are _encouraged_ to do so by internal cultural standards (rap for example) which is itself blatantly black-hateful against society itself.</p>
<p>That such violence has nothing to do with social inequity is proven by the fact that blacks in the U.S. have always had a superior SES to those in Africa.  While those in Africa continue to have IQs in the borderline mentally retarded level of 70-75 and live according.</p>
<p>Yet 300 years of better nutrition and lower violence among whites have only added 15 points to African American IQs (whites have moved up a similar degree, maintaining the normed 1MSD of 15 points in IQ however).</p>
<p>While even vastly better living standards have done _nothing_ for black propensity to violence which has in fact INCREASED with their acceptance into a post-JC world.  To the point where they are now so unwanted as to be utterly dependent on welfare handouts reversing Darwinian selection criteria for social competitiveness.</p>
<p>WHAT WE CANNOT DO: Is continue to supply 12% of our overall population with 40% of our jail cells and 50% of our welfare state compensations and 70% of it&rsquo;s AA/FHA reserved housing, jobs and financial services.  While losing ground in total population, population aging and access to superior benefits ourselves.</p>
<p>Because we now live in a world where even whites, who pay for those services, are struggling with modern workplace requirements and where those whites are in extreme danger of facing the same &#8220;Failure is a surer road to success&hellip;&#8221; contrary social model to what made us great.  Reversing the incentive desire to go to college and be successful.  Which is the bootstrap, can-do, sense of ourselves that blacks (inner city ones especially) have never had.</p>
<p>And likely will never develop.  Living as they now do.</p>
<p>I feel sorry for those blacks who are trapped in the welfare cycle.  Because it is backsliding them to a level worse than when their ancestors were kidnapped from Africa.</p>
<p>But the fact remains, whether for personal preference in right of association or by economic values contributed to society or based on criminality statistics that go with poverty as stupidity in absent impulse control and conformity with group laws.</p>
<p>It is not the fault of White America that blacks are where they are at.  We should accept no further guilt for simply being better and indeed should fight for MORE exclusivity in perks because we HAVE MORE who are capable of contributing on that &#8216;most democratic&rsquo; basis of the-most-for-the-most-useful.</p>
<p>Blacks who think they are owed advantagement as a condition of white acceptance of their presence in our culture are wrong.  The proof being that modern whites don&rsquo;t invade black &#8216;civilizations&rsquo;.  Such as they are.  We don&rsquo;t take their resources.  Such as they are.  We don&rsquo;t feel benefited by their presence at all.</p>
<p>Point Blank: Whites deserve to have a land and a nation that is their own.  Blacks do not.  Not in North America.</p>

		<p>Good God this makes me want to pull my hair out! Is Mr. Large living in the same universe as me? Has Mr. Large ever walked into a hospital, office building, ANY government building or airport? You will see a virtual sea of black faces &#8220;working&#8221; at these places. And because of PC and affirmative action it is close to impossible to be fired from these jobs. They can be as nasty and incompetent as they want to be and will get a raise and promotion for their efforts. Any black poverty is brought on by themselves. This typical liberal will ignore what his own eyes see. To him and his ilk the U.S. will always and forever be the Jim Crow south of the 1920s. </p>

		<p>Most black defendants commit crimes in or around black neighborhoods and get judged by their black and Hispanic neighbors at a local courthouse. But since trial by a jury of ones peers is a white man&rsquo;s invention, it must in some mysterious way always result in disadvantage to a non-white defendant. Maybe if black criminals were allowed to pick their own juries and every white defendant was judged by 12 angry black men, prison population demographics might shift.</p>

		<p>Men are more likely to go to jail.  I guess this means our legal system is sexist.  If Jerry Large were serious about the difference in outcomes, he&rsquo;d condemn the epidemic of out-of-wedlock births in black communities. Somehow, by reasoning that escapes me, I am guessing instead it is racism that explains this difference, too. Was our society less racist when the out-of-wedlock birthrate was much lower? Oh, never mind.</p>

		<p>Mr Large and his kind are the biggest black hypocrites in this country: they go and move to places such as Seattle where there are overwhelmingly white populations, carp about racism, and date white women and have mulatto babies.</p>
<p>Maybe Mr. Large should try living amongst his people in Detroit or DC or Alabama. Blacks have no reason whatsoever to be in the Northwest.</p>

		<p>No, blacks are in prison because they lack moral character.  Poverty does not cause crime and people aren&rsquo;t poor because others are biased against them.  People commit crime because they have no values and no direction.  People are poor because they are either lazy, don&rsquo;t save money for the future, and/or aren&rsquo;t willing to put forth effort, planning, and drive to reaching their goals.  </p>

		<p>Jerry Large&rsquo;s excuse for black criminal behavior, resulting from poverty; is stupid and without credibility. Notice he doesn&rsquo;t say poverty is the cause of Caucasian or Oriental criminal behavior - only black.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s so, then how is poverty responsible for the following black criminal behaviors?</p>
<p>-Warren Wells, ex-Oakland Raider wide receiver, was jailed for rape, in the early 1970&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>-Mike Tyson, for rape and numerous assaults</p>
<p>- O.J. Simpson, for murder (he did it, despite the jury&rsquo;s verdict), and armed robbery</p>
<p>-Rae Carruth, of the Carolina Panthers, ordering the murder of his pregnant girlfriend, so he didn&rsquo;t have to pay child support</p>
<p>- Michael Vick running a dog-fighting operation</p>
<p>-Ike Turner slapping around Tina Turner for 20 years</p>
<p>-Politicians like Kwame Kilpatrick, William Jefferson, Charles Diggs, Charles Rangel and Maxine Waters</p>
<p>How has poverty caused these blacks to commit crimes? All of them were/are wealthy.</p>
<p>A person&rsquo;s BEHAVIOR, more than his/her environmental background, govern whether they&rsquo;ll engage in criminal behavior.   <br>

		<p>This reads as if it were written by any number of government commissions back in the 1960s. But the &rsquo;60s are over, dude. </p>
<p>The article is the standard liberal ideological tract. Blame environmental conditions for pathologies among favored groups. Then use this as an excuse to implement more government programs and thus enhance liberal power in the USA. </p>
<p><i>Black people have higher poverty rates than most Americans and higher poverty is associated with higher crime rates. That effect is aggravated by longterm poverty and bias.</i></p>
<p>We have had over half a century of civil rights legislation, and war on poverty, and black studies programs, and government grants, and affirmative action, and so forth and so on and etcetera. The USA has given blacks everything they have demanded, <i>everything</i>, even South Africa delivered on a silver platter.</p>
<p>And where do we find ourselves today?</p>
<p>According to this article, all this has made no difference. </p>
<p>If a half century of liberal programs have failed, then why does he think that more liberal anti-poverty/anti-bias/anti-whatever programs are going to work?</p>
<p>(Another explanation is that perhaps it is all these liberal programs which have led to the high black crime rates in the first place: the destruction of the family via welfare, and so forth. Thus, more liberalism will only equal more criminality.)</p>
<p>Or why not look at cities such as Detroit. Detroit is 90% black, with a black government. There can hardly be any bias there. And Detroit is, as a result, a low crime city  &mdash;  right?</p>
<p>Liberal reasoning these declining days requires a sort of Orwellian &#8220;memory hole&#8221; kind of reasoning. Erase the history of the last fifty years and pretend history started yesterday.  </p>

		<p>I am a Washingtonian as well as an attorney.  Having gone to law school in WA State, I was familiar with Justice Sanders (notice how Mr. Large does not call the justices by their well-earned judicial title of &#8220;Justice&#8221;) before this whole controversy, but had no particular opinion about him either way.  Justice Sanders was also up for election again this election cycle against a fairly left-leaning opponent.  While I am normally liberal in most of my political beliefs, I voted for Justice Sanders (who won BTW) simply for these comments.  I found it refreshing that finally someone, somewhere, and in a position of legal authority, came out and said the obvious: minorities aren&rsquo;t overrepresented in prisons because of racial disparities in the criminal justice system, but because they commit more crime. </p>
<p>Interestingly enough, there was also a WA State ballot initiative this election cycle that allowed superior court judges more discretion when deciding whether a defendant can be released on bail.  It passed overwhelmingly. </p>
