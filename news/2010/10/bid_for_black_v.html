<h1><a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130829670">Bid for Black Vote Takes On Racial Overtones</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Corey Dade, National Public Radio, October 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>No one expects African-Americans to vote in anywhere near their numbers from 2008, when their 65 percent turnout matched that of whites for the first time. But that isn&rsquo;t stopping Democratic organizers and supporting groups from using aggressive, even racially charged, tactics to get them to the polls Tuesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If trying to overcome the Republicans&rsquo; strong momentum in congressional races isn&rsquo;t motivation enough, the Democrats have an added incentive this year: Several of the tightest congressional and gubernatorial races are in states with significant black populations, giving blacks in heavily minority districts an uncommon chance to tip statewide contests.</p>
<p>To rouse them, some organizers are applying aggressive tactics, including the use of openly racial invective directed at Republicans and Tea Party activists.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The charged messaging appears to be a &#8220;fight fire with fire&#8221; counter effort to what Democrats and some political analysts describe as a racist undercurrent in the rhetoric from Tea Party activists and Republican candidates and pundits.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Tea Party movement first raised hackles when some of its supporters questioned whether President Obama had been born in the U.S., a constitutional requirement for the office. In March, members of the Congressional Black Caucus said Tea Party demonstrators shouted racial epithets at them while protesting heath-care legislation outside the Capitol. One member said he was spit upon. Tea Party spokesmen have challenged those claims.</p>
<p>In 2009, conservative talk show host Glenn Beck called Obama a &#8220;racist&#8221; with &#8220;deep-seeded hatred for white people.&#8221; In August, he defended his decision to hold a Washington rally on the anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.&rsquo;s March on Washington, by pledging to &#8220;reclaim the civil rights movement&#8221; from liberals. He said civil rights leaders had &#8220;purposely distorted Martin Luther King&rsquo;s ideas.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>&#8216;I Ain&rsquo;t Going Back to the Cotton Fields of Jim Crow&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>In Alabama, a recently recorded phone message targeting heavily black communities lays out an ominous warning before the narrator goes on to endorse Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ron Sparks and lieutenant governor hopeful Jim Folsom. The voice is that of an African-American state senator, an influential longtime politician in Alabama, who begins, &#8220;Hello, this is Hank Sanders .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I&rsquo;m still mad as hell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I say hell no!&#8221; he continues. &#8220;I ain&rsquo;t going back to the cotton fields of Jim Crow days. I&rsquo;m going forward with Ron Sparks, Jim Folsom and others who will do right by all of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Alabama &#8220;robocall&#8221; came in response to Republican candidates&rsquo; pledges to roll back the health-care overhaul and other initiatives pushed through by Obama. {snip}</p>
<p>The Alabama Republican Party has accused Sanders of race-baiting. &#8220;It&rsquo;s pretty sad that the Democrat Party believes that the only way they can win in 2010 is to scare people with images of slavery and cotton fields,&#8221; state Rep. Mike Hubbard, chairman of the Alabama Republican party, said in a statement. {snip} Sparks has responded to questions about the calls by saying racism still exists in Alabama, The Birmingham News reports.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Spreading the Word via E-Mail</b></p>
<p>Separately, an e-mail circulating among African-Americans nationwide takes a similar swing at the right and calls Tea Party activists &#8220;hate mongers.&#8221; It isn&rsquo;t clear if the message, with the subject line &#8220;Wake Up!!! Stop The Tea Party,&#8221; was authored by a political organization. The e-mail is addressed to Democrats and urges them to vote on Nov. 2 &#8220;like our lives depend on it, because it does. The Republican party [sic] has been hijacked by dangerous, radical hate mongers called the &#8216;Tea Party.&rsquo; They are led by Glen [sic] Beck and Sara [sic] Palin [whose] only goal is to take down President Obama and the government.</p>
<p>&#8220;These people hate Blacks.&#8221; it continues. &#8220;They hate Latinos. They hate Muslims and have at times made many anti-Semitic statements. They hate Gays. They hate any moderate Republican who might be likely to cooperate with Obama. Their rallying cry? &#8216;We want to take back our country!!&rsquo; Take it back from whom?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;These radicals could take this country back to Jim Crow and the hey-day of the [Ku] Klux Klan. Don&rsquo;t think it could happen? Just stay home on election day and see what happens to this country.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Spending Big to Get Out the Vote</b></p>
<p>Blacks historically have turned out to vote at rates below the national average. But a recent survey conducted by The Washington Post, the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard University showed that 80 percent of black Democrats are as engaged, or more so, in the midterm elections than they were in the 2008 presidential election.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Democratic Party says it is spending more than $3 million  &mdash;  its biggest commitment ever in a midterm cycle  &mdash;  on ad buys targeting African-Americans. On Monday, the Democratic National Committee announced a new ad featuring R&B; singer John Legend that will air in urban markets in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, Missouri, Illinois, Wisconsin and on nationally syndicated radio shows with predominantly black audiences.</p>
<p>First lady Michelle Obama has appeared on Tom Joyner&rsquo;s morning radio show, the highest-rated program among blacks. African-Americans within the Obama administration are hitting the campaign trail. White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, who is black, appears in the October issue of Essence magazine.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Michigan Offers a Cautionary Note</b></p>
<p>In Michigan, where black turnout was 57 percent in 2006 and 64 percent in 2008, the Democrats are struggling to energize their base despite having committed several million dollars to the effort.</p>
<p>{snip} But at a rally in Detroit on Sunday, former President Bill Clinton drew a crowd of about 500 people, enough to fill only a third of the room. For a city that still adores Clinton, who once packed any venue there by the thousands, the thin showing illustrates the lack of excitement for Michigan&rsquo;s Democratic candidates.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bernero&rsquo;s selection of African-American Brenda Lawrence as his running mate has done little to energize black voters or other Democratic loyalists. And he&rsquo;s had to overcome relative obscurity, as mayor of the small capital city of Lansing. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The malaise among voters could pose problems for Obama and the Democrats in 2012, given Michigan&rsquo;s traditional role as a bellwether for presidential elections. Democrats admit the same could be true in other future battleground states, such as Ohio and Pennsylvania.</p>

		<p>Being as this is yet another propaganda screed from NPR, it&rsquo;s probably redundant to wonder why no one at all is concerned about the <i>White</i> vote.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, these flagrantly racial appeals to blacks get the National Propaganda Radio&rsquo;s stamp of approval, while similar appeals to White voters would be (and are) instantly shouted down as &#8220;Racist Hate.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Bid for Black Vote Takes On Racial Overtones&#8221;</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t just the bid for the black vote that is steeped in racial animus.  Almost anything blacks are involved with concerns themselves and any other blacks in the world.</p>
<p>Most blacks are ultra biased and a real threat to the people around them any where in the world.</p>
<p>Just look at the way the black conservatives came rushing to Obama in the election.  Condoleeza Rice was at the Whitehouse advising him the other day.  She calls herself a conservative Republican, but she&rsquo;s a black nationalist first and foremost.</p>
<p>Blacks are the curse of mankind.</p>

		<p>The problem with this (one that is sure to make for great humor among white racial realists) is the term &#8220;tea party&#8221; is code for white people.  And white people are defined, not by party affiliation but by skin color.</p>
<p>What the democrats are doing here is reinforcing racism as political motivation for blacks.  In their heads, they think that blacks will vote against republicans identified as &#8220;white racists&#8221;.  But in reality, blacks will vote against white people&hellip;..ANY white people.  Including white democrats.</p>
<p>This has already become manifest in a major election this year where blacks steadfastly REFUSED to vote for a white democrat with a competitive chance and instead voted in a black candidate of extremely dubious character with NO chance of winning.  The ONLY thing that mattered to them was voting against the white candidate&hellip;.no matter the party.</p>
<p>This development will permanently destroy both the democratic party and black political activism.  Both deserve their fate.  By being so overtly and insistently racist, they both got what they wanted&hellip;..only race matters now.</p>
<p>The real trouble (for them&hellip;.I&rsquo;m just as happy as can be over the development) is white racial awakening.  Whites are beginning to understand that other races, with few exceptions, hold malevolent intent towards them and if they gain power, as they have for the last couple of years, they immediately use that power to hurt them&hellip;.in very real, very demonstrable ways.  One doesn&rsquo;t have to be the unfortunate victim of a violent, racist rape, murder, assault or robbery to know this now.  It&rsquo;s coming out in the form of lost jobs.  Lost wages.  Severely and artificially depressed standard of living&hellip;..and most importantly of all&hellip;..loss of freedoms.</p>

		<p>Would that we could go back to a time when merit and hard work determined the outcome, not membership in an approved &#8220;minority&#8221; group. We could use more cotton pickers, fewer rapists, and more factory workers for jobs the neo-liberals like Clinton and neo-cons like Reagan and the Bushes sent to Asia and Latin America. But them for some people, maybe some &#8220;folks&#8221; in Alabama or Southern Cal, factory jobs aren&rsquo;t &#8216;good enough&rsquo;.</p>

<p>And just why is that? Because blacks (I refuse to call them Af/Am) are blatantly and undeniably racist. The election of &#8216;08 is irrefutable proof that the one and only issue they voted for was color. Despite their never-ending accusations to and about whites, blacks are are the most racist group on the planet. We all knew that, and they showed as much. If there ain&rsquo;t no black man runnin&rsquo; they ain&rsquo;t interested. Which is a good thing for us.</p>

		<p>So appealing to white conservatives like me is &#8216;fear mongering&rsquo; but appealing to a bunch of whining, complaining, hate-filled blacks and hispanics who are worried whites will get a backbone and take our country back isn&rsquo;t fear mongering.  Hypocrites.</p>

		<p> It shows how desperate the Democrats are in this election, that they use such Halloween &#8220;Boo!&#8221; language to try to scare blacks into going to the polls. &#8220;Cotton fields&#8221;? &#8220;Hey day of the K&#8221;? What a joke!</p>
<p> If blacks feel they&rsquo;re being taken advantage of, or are being ignored, by the Democrats, maybe it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;ve been TOO loyal. Maybe if they see the Republicans as &#8220;racist&#8221;, it&rsquo;s because the GOP sees them as a lost cause   &mdash;   a group that won&rsquo;t vote Republican, no matter what. So why should the GOP try to cater to such a group, when the party knows it won&rsquo;t benefit from such catering? </p>

Well, it&rsquo;s becomes so obvious, even NPR is forced to report on it.</p>
<p>This tactic is used every day, not just during elections.</p>
<p>All you have to do is say something like, &#8216;we need to return to founding principles of the Constitution&rsquo; and what blacks hear, or want to hear so they can make it a race issue, is to say it&rsquo;s a code for bringing back slavery.</p>
<p>Notice how about 1965, all the traditional public schools did away with portraits of the Founding Fathers, American flags, and copies of the Constitution? At the same time, they replaced them with multicultural images of happy black and white kids.</p>
<p>This was America&rsquo;s &#8216;cultural revolution&rsquo;. The past needed to be destroyed to make way for our great and glorious multicultural  future.</p>
<p>&#8216;He who controls the present controls the past. He who controls the past controls the future&rsquo;.<br>

		<p>Stupid white men gave it all away and as a result have brought down the greatest country ever.  Liberalism, a mental disoder, has won.  Perhaps the coming election will start to reverse things temporarily, but overall the future trend is non-white and non-Christian.  </p>
<p>Muslims couples are producing around 6-children, whites around <br>
1-2 children, blacks I don&rsquo;t know - probably 3-4 children, Mexicans around the same. Figure out the future results for yourself.  No wonder so many financial gurus are moving to Singapore, a high growth stable system, because they see what&rsquo;s coming ahead in this country which is disaster.  For those whites planning on hanging around this country and wanting to live in a white culture to minimize the effect of the coming riots and financial collapse, take a look at Barrow, Alaska, a nice pretty much all white culture, however, watch out for the vampires.</p>
<p>Minorities are going to vote as a block for their own members which of course will be 85% democrats.  After this coming election this trend will be even stronger.  What can you do to save your families, again I suggest studying about dual citizenship and the function of precious metals.   </p>

		<p> The funny thing is that none of us who have an I.Q. over 100 expect to go back to segregation. I myself will happily take the abolishment of affirmative action and let the dust settle where it may. The most racist people to me are the liberals who scream for racial set asides and then claim we are all equal but are unwilling to put their assumptions to the test. It seems that if whites don&rsquo;t get rid of reverse discrimination we will find our children shining shoes and tap dancing for a living.</p>

		<p>The left wing is trying so vehemently to convince blacks of Tea Party racist viciousness that the former has, in some instances, apparently convinced themselves.  On Lawrence O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s MSNBC show, leftie David Brock announced with all earnestness that he intended to call Palin and beg her to rein in Beck before we experience another Oklahoma City!  Blacks are feverishly calling CSPAN&rsquo;s Washington Journal to wail about the Tea Party and any criticism of Obama.  They whine that the Tea Party is going to send poll watchers  &mdash;  who will do what?  Act like the Philly Panthers?  Dems are announcing that blacks can turn the tide of Congressional elections in the South.  But where in the South do blacks have such numbers and power other than black districts where black Dems always win anyway?  <br>
I figured that Bill Clinton&rsquo;s rally got a low turnout in Detroit because blacks now see him as the unObama.  Pundits are gushing over his continued draw, calling him the most popular pol in America.  (He also got less than an admirable response in Chicago, I read.)  Blacks are growing increasingly suspicious of all whites because of the nationwide backlash against Obama, and the Dems are fueling their outrage.  No wonder the enthusiam is low.</p>

<p>Really? You wouldn&rsquo;t want to go back to segregation? I would love it! Guess that shows anyone with an IQ of 100 or more aren&rsquo;t as smart as they think they are. I imagine those with 100 or more IQ are the very ones who demanded desegregation along with the 1965 Immigration Act and look what it has done to Whites and America.</p>
<p>Hate to tell you this but getting rid of AA without having segregation or separation our children and grandchildren most assuredly will be shining shoes, not to mention all the other horrors they will encounter.  </p>

		<p>The &#8220;Wake Up!&hellip;&#8221; e-mail was sounds as if it was written by a white person trying to dumb-down the message.  Whoever, seems to have slipped up and let in too much content and structure.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;These people hate Blacks.&rdquo; it continues. &ldquo;They hate Latinos. They hate Muslims and have at times made many anti-Semitic statements. They hate Gays. They hate any moderate Republicans&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Edit out the &#8220;hate blacks&#8221; part and you have a direct appeal to the inherent bigotry of black America </p>

		<p>They go racist?  So do we.  Only we do it better, smoother, cleaner.</p>
<p>The key is to get a candidate (And I _still_ don&rsquo;t see anyone in the Republicans worth the wasted oxygen) whose prior and explicit political history allows his campaign to underline those &#8216;traditionally white&rsquo; values that can act for themselves in calling home the GOPs sons and daughters gone far afield.</p>
<p>The mistake most people make is in assuming these issues have to be right-now immediate or at least a nation-wide rising-threat issue to be worthwhile.  It doesn&rsquo;t.  It can be regional or even a single city.</p>
<p>Crime?<br>
We know thy skin color&rsquo;s name.  Just as we know your regional locations.  If X (governor, mayor or whatever) has reduced crime in his area, we know that means he&rsquo;s not in the habit of rescinding public safety in the hope of achieving &#8216;new dialogue among the races&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Spending?<br>
If X has put together a city or a region whose prior affiliations with a given credo (Democrat) or racial mix (hello) has brought it to ruin, then by all means SAY SO.  Using the former label to stand in for the latter.</p>
<p>So that we can &#8216;no to the demos!&rsquo; be aware of what happened and why it&rsquo;s gotten better.</p>
<p>It will have to be carefully vouched for.  It will have to be covered by economic and political realities that don&rsquo;t show apparent favoritism for the person&rsquo;s race so much as the overall policy of conservatism.  It will help immensely if we can rob the Alinsky&rsquo;s of the world of any means to find/fix/polarize/personalize this by making it a coalition effect ourselves.</p>
<p>But if blacks continue to align themselves with a nanny state mentality of &#8216;promise them everything!&rsquo; Democratic corruption.  And hispanics look to stay in the nation-transformation game by any means: fair, foul or quiet, of population replacement, they have _set themselves up_ for legitimate racially aligned accusations of &#8216;Et tu, Brute?!&rsquo; fellow travelership.</p>
<p>And there is no reason why we cannot judge them, collectively, based on what they have tarred themselves with on a common broadbrush.</p>
<p>Without saying a word about the races associated therewith.</p>
<p>Of course this is a dangerous road to travel down.  For as Obama inherited Bush, a conservative President will inherit Obama.</p>
<p>And in a landscape littered with the detritus of &#8216;stimulus&rsquo; and other trillion dollar nonsense that takes us to the verge of economic collapse, it will be tempting to rule with a heavy hand simply because rising joblessness and falling GDP and currency values will bring with it a rampant rise in criminality and collapse of social systems and the temptation to cancel all promises.</p>
<p>Something that Democrats could use to again swing the mob against us, in 2016.</p>
<p>But just to get into office?  All&rsquo;s fair, the gloves are off.</p>

		<p>The Tea Party reminds me of one of those shark bags divers get into to keep from getting bit.  By presenting themselves as an amorphous leaderless blob, the Tea Party is much harder to label and attack then they would be if was more structured.  Blacks have been playing the victim for so long, I sometimes think it is the only thing they know how to do.  </p>

		<p><i> Most blacks are ultra biased and a real threat to the people around them any where in the world. </i></p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this true for any race? Aren&rsquo;t Chinese biased in favor of Chinese, Mexicans biased in favor of Mexicans, and Indians biased in favor of Indians? </p>

		<p>Remember: if a white politician even mentions white racial interests, he is demonic and must be stopped. If a black politician openly appeals to black racial interests, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
