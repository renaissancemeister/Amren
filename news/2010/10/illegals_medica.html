<h1>Illegals&rsquo; Medical Bills Top $35.7M</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jessica Van Sack, Boston Herald, October 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Beleaguered Bay State and U.S. taxpayers coughed up a staggering $35.7 million this year in free emergency health care for more than 52,000 illegal aliens in Massachusetts, sparking outrage from candidates and critics who back a tougher line on immigration.</p>
<p>The figures  &mdash;  released by Gov. Deval Patrick&rsquo;s administration under an order for the Secretary of State&rsquo;s office and after more than a month of ducking questions  &mdash;  show illegal immigrants who belong to MassHealth Limited received $33.8 million in taxpayer-funded in-patient hospital care this year.</p>
<p>They also made 6,160 visits to the state&rsquo;s overburdened emergency rooms in the fiscal year ending in June for an additional cost of $1.9 million, a Herald analysis shows.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Incorporating illegal immigrants into any type of government-sponsored health care is legitimizing their presence here,&#8221; said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the conservative Center for Immigration Studies, which favors stricter immigration policies. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a kind of piecemeal amnesty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Added state Rep. Robert Hedlund (R-Weymouth), &#8220;It&rsquo;s just another example in this state of working people paying the bills, and some people availing themselves of the benefits we have in the commonwealth.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The figures show 69 percent of the state&rsquo;s MassHealth Limited subscribers are illegal immigrants. The state is projected to pay $13.7 million of the cost of the health-care program this year, while federal Medicaid picks up the other $22 million.</p>

		<p>The numbers are too low.  Average visit for emergency room is more, figure over $1,000.  <br>
Also in emergency rooms they practice triage, or those with the more severe issues move up the que to get treatment sooner.  This means the added illegals will displace some citizens in the que to a lesser position. <br>
Conclusion, illegals cause longer waiting times and thus more suffering for citizens.  And the citizens get to pay taxes to support it.</p>

		<p>The inclusion of the illegals in the Mass Health care program is unacceptable. If that is what Romney did or intended when he was governor, he is out as a conservative selection. If not, then Patrick is to blame, and that would make sense, as he is an Obama clone.</p>
<p>As for emergency room care, I too have fantasies about hospitals and their staffs throwing illegals and their multiple brood out into the nearest interstate. But then I admit as much as I despise illegals, I would not deny them emergency care. But whether it was emergency or just what an internist would treat for a nonemergency condition, the hospitals must have to have hotlines to INS if these people can&rsquo;t prove citizenship. And I said citizenship. I have had it with &#8220;temporary residents&#8221; and student visa holders too. Let them all explain to Ice or INS who they are and why they are using ER as Dr. Kildare&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>Doctors, BTW, the consummate capitalists, of course on the whole, gut any efforts to throw illegals out. So don&rsquo;t count on them. To them a patient is a fee, and with Obama care these illegals and the legal immigrants are just more gravy on the potatoes.</p>

		<p>So let&rsquo;s see&hellip;&hellip;..52,000 illegals make up 69% of MassHealth Limited&rsquo;s subscribers.  Are they saying there are only a TOTAL of something like 75,000 subscribers in all of Mass in MassHealth Limited?  In ALL of Mass there are only 52,000 illegals?  Moreover, 33.8 million bucks divided by 52,000 illegals is only something like $650 in free medical care for each illegal.  I doubt these numbers are true.  I doubt ANY of the numbers given are true.  I&rsquo;d bet right off the bat EACH illegal is getting FAR more than $650 bucks per year in care, when you factor in prescription drugs, routine visits to the ER rather than general practitioners, the fact that a single day&rsquo;s stay in the hospital is $1000 OR MORE  JUST FOR THE BED not factoring in the doctors costs, cost for procedures, etc.  This is a lie from start to finish.  Most certainly, the books have been cooked either as to the number of illegals (meaning far less illegals are in Mass than stated - very unlikely) or the costs of medical care provided to the illegals is mis-reported (far more likely that number is far, far under reported than the number of illegals was under-reported).  </p>

		<p>Unsurprising and as the above poster stated, most likely too low. Two years ago my youngest daughter broke her collar bone. After 6, yes 6, hours of waiting at two different ER&rsquo;s, I took her home and wrapped it myself. Both ER&rsquo;s were crammed full with 75% mexicans. Mostly women, with at least 2-3 unruly kids, and almost all of the women were also pregnant.</p>
<p>And now they want to cut pay and benefits for public safety (Police and Fire) in this state, but not a word about the costs due to illeagl aliens.</p>

		<p>I agree with the previous poster(s) that the cost seems too low. The reason is because these people are legally subscribed to the state MassHealth Limited emergency medical coverage program:</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/masshealthorg</p>
<p>The figures do not include the many other illegals who simply show up at the hospital without previously signing up for the program.</p>
<p>Incredibly, the insane liberals in Massachusetts have specifically designed the MassHealth Limited program so that: </p>
<p>&#8220;You do not have to give or apply for a Social Security number to qualify, and your immigration status will NOT be reported to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS). Undocumented noncitizens may apply without fear of deportation.&#8221; </p>
<p>What madness! Sigh.<br>

		<p>This figure of 37m is way too low. For example treating one case of the new Tuberculosis coming in from Latin America cost the the State of Florida $500,000. 75 such cases of involved treatment brings the total past 37 million.<br>
 <br>
Another way to think about it..what does a single case of AIDS cost to treat over a lifetime? 1 million? How about a triple bypass surgery..thats $85,000 before we figure in workmans comp. What about a complicated pregnancy that keeps Maria in pre natal, post surgery and post natal care for a couple months? </p>
<p>37 million is way way to low.</p>

		</legend>
		<p>Historically, Australians travelling to America have been warned that medical and hospital costs there can be astronomical. There are horror stories of travellers spending a few days in a USA hospital and getting a six figure bill! The message being to take out adequate insurance before you go.</p>
<p>Obviously America also has a public system where some measure of &#8220;free&#8221; treatment is available and just as obvious is the fact that this free system will expand under &#8220;Obamacare&#8221; </p>
<p>Free medical care will simply encourage more 3rd world illegals to enter America.</p>
<p>Perhaps Washington will soon have to adopt a 3rd world method of paying for all this free healthcare, simply print more money!  This will of course have the double whammy effect of destroying the health care system as well as the economy.</p>

		<p>With figures like this representing ONE state alone, think of what the total for the whole country is. I would like to hear any of the pro-illegal politicans say that illegals pay their way. Even if they did, they are still ILLEGAL! They must leave. It seems no one in Washington has ever thought of stopping the benefits. They&rsquo;d leave if there were no handouts or jobs.</p>

		<p>My fellow AR readers should keep in mind that if the anti-white racists who populate the current upper crust of the RINO / neo-con infested GOP and the decades old, hardcore anti-white Democrat Party manage to pass amnesty for these 30-40 million illegal aliens - who are in our nation in clear violation of the law, then you can bet the farm that the amnesty will include extremely generous &#8216;family reunification&rsquo; provisions.  </p>
<p>What this will mean is simple.    Not only will the overwhelmingly white middle class tax payers be fleeced out of their hard earned wages to pay for the Obama Care health insurance subsidies for the 30-40 million newly amnestied illegal aliens, but those aliens will immediately begin to import every member of their family tree from their respective third world native country, and then those aliens will do the same thing to their extended family tree.   And, each and every one of them will immediately qualify for tax payer provided subsidies for Obama Care - on top of countless other social entitlement handouts.   Also, as we are reading - due to the deliberately established paltry size of the fines, there is a move by many major company CEOs to cancel their existing health care programs and pay the fines, which is cheaper than paying the insurance premiums for their employees.  Hence, gainfully employed, white middle class tax payers will not only be paying for these subsidies, many will also now be forced to find new health insurance policies and pay the full cost of their insurance without any assistance from their employers.  Either that, or turn to the government - which some say was the devious goal of the Democrats all along, i.e., to destroy private health insurance providers and force  American citizens to be dependent upon Big Government.  Oh, and to also give Big Brother Government absolute control over each and every citizen via control of our medical care needs.   </p>
<p>And, the frosting on the cake - will be that every last one of these non-white immigrants will automatically be given affirmative action related preferences over the white founding stock of this nation in areas of employment, college admissions, trade school admissions, government jobs, post office jobs, or when competing for a government contract.   Plus, with hundreds of millions of relatives, also non-white immigrants, flooding in based on the amnesty - whites will be reduced to a numerical minority in America and that means we become tax slaves for the rest of our lives - unable to muster the sufficient numbers on election day to protect our precious rights, which were gifts to us by our 100 percent White Founding Fathers, or to remove the minority grip on our paychecks.   Never again will any white conservative politician be electable in America.   </p>
<p>I wanted to offer this reminder, in case there are any whites left out there who still fail to grasp just how huge the stakes are, if we allow these RINO and neo-con traitors in the GOP to join forces with the Democrats and drive the final stake through the hearts of White European people in America.  </p>
<p>Need a short list of RINOs?   Newt Gingrich, Sarah Palin, John McCain, the entire Bush Family, the entire Cheney Family, the entire Hatch Family, the entire Armey Family, Lindsay Graham, Karl Rove, plus every neo-con bought and paid for talking head in the mainstream media who utters a single word of praise for any of these RINOs.   Beck, Limbaugh, Hannity, Boortz, Liddy, O&rsquo;Reilly, Savage, the entire Faux News gang, Coulter, North, <br>
etc.    </p>

		<p>It stands to reason that if our nation does not have the gumption to deport millions of illegals, that there are &#8220;millions&#8221; of illegals being continually used by our elites as the circular reasoning as to why their deportation is &#8220;impossible,&#8221; we will not be denying emergency medical services to illegals. Add to that the fact that many uninsured illegals simply go to the nearest ER for their routine health problems. Of course it is all part of the many expected manifestations of our own sinking ever farther down into the dysfunctional mire of the Third World.<br>

		<p>Here in Texas, we spend  FIVE BILLION a year in taxpayers funds for Mexican illegals. Our hospitals are not crammed with Mexicans and the waits for care and costs have gone up dramatically. In the 70s, hospital care may have cost a 100 dollars for a trip to the emergency room, now it&rsquo;s 5000 dollars.</p>

		<p>These figures are absurdly off kilter, just as the &#8216;undocumented workers&rsquo; in America figures are distorted. Are they counting just the &#8216;undocumented&rsquo; that &#8216;work&rsquo; at real jobs? Only the ones with stolen SS numbers, or also the ones working under the table for cash only? Do they consider selling drugs &#8216;work&rsquo;? Are they counting the females who just tagged along with the &#8216;workers&rsquo; here and pull the groceries off the shelves while the &#8216;workers&rsquo; push the cart, or do those not count? And what about the children? Oh, I&rsquo;m getting a headache.</p>
