<h1><a href="https://www.wnd.com/?pageId=215041">Investigator&rsquo;s Decapitation &#8216;Message to White House&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jerome R. Corsi, WorldNetDaily, October 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The decapitation of the lead Mexican investigator in the alleged murder of a jet-skier on a border lake is a sharp retort to President Obama&rsquo;s administration, a Texas congressman said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Mexican drug cartels just sent a message to the White House that the United States no longer controls the border,&#8221; Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, told WND.</p>
<p>The severed head of investigator Rolando Armando Flores Villegas was delivered this week to an army garrison in Ciudad Miguel Aleman in the Tamaulipas state in Mexico. The city is across the river from Zapata County, Texas, the location of Falcon Lake, where David Michael Hartley allegedly was killed by Mexican pirates while he was jet-skiing with his wife Tiffany.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the Los Zetas drug cartel commits a murder, they dispose of the body where it will never be found, or they use the body to send a message to law enforcement,&#8221; Poe said. &#8220;By decapitating Rolando Flores, the Mexican drug cartels sent a message to Mexico to stop investigating Hartley&rsquo;s murder.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Poe believes the Flores murder is just one more indication Mexico&rsquo;s drug war is out of control and increasingly dangerous to U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>&#8220;The decapitation of Rolando Flores is a warning to the United States and to Mexico that this portion of the border is protected by the Zetas,&#8221; Poe said. &#8220;The Zetas intend to protect their drug routes on the border from law enforcement regardless whether that law enforcement is from Mexico or the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>Poe doubts Mexico will make serious efforts to apprehend David Michael Hartley&rsquo;s killers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thousands of drug-related homicides are committed in Mexico every year, and very few are ever solved,&#8221; he stressed. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;Mexican law enforcement authorities do not control the lake  &mdash;  the pirates do,&#8221; he said. Tons of illegal drugs are warehoused on that island by the drug cartels for smuggling into the United States and the pirates are well armed.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The coming war from mexico is what is finally going to cause the US to disengage from the middle east and finally cause us to round up and expel all the mexicans.</p>
<p>They simply won&rsquo;t let us be.  And this isn&rsquo;t really about drug money.  It&rsquo;s about territory.</p>
<p>The mestizos think they can slice off a chunk of both mexico and the US and create a country whose primary industry is drugs, with a brisk trade in slaves, guns and mercenaries&hellip;.all financed via American welfare dollars siphoned into drug sales.</p>
<p>So far, they have been right.  Only time will tell though how the US reacts to actual frank military invasion.  What will happen when the zetas extend what they consider the border, across to the other side of the lake and miles into the US.</p>
<p>They think a few acts of terrorism will curtail law enforcement and prevent a military response from the US while liberals support them politically.</p>
<p>Are they right?</p>
<p>They might be.  Certainly, Obama and his ship of fools agree with this.  But they are about to be replaced&hellip;.soon.  And the attitude of people in the US is turning militant&hellip;on the cusp of white nationalism.</p>
<p>An invasion by mexico is exactly the sort of thing that would tip this situation over the edge.</p>

		<p>So this Los Zetas drug cartel has decided to send a message to our effete mulatto &ldquo;savior&rdquo; and Mexico&rsquo;s government (as is such,) by way of a severed head? I must admit, I am shocked into almost a stupor of incomprehension. How can this be, in a world without borders and our common humanity? </p>
<p>The sad thing is Comrade BO and Co., along with the rest of the dewy-eyed &ldquo;elites&rdquo; in this country, actually probably do think that on some level.</p>
<p>If Comrade BO had any brains or guts he would unleash the USA&rsquo;s armed services against this morbid joke that is called a country, Mexico, and slaughter every member of the Los Zetas drug cartel without mercy and send his own message. Of course he won&rsquo;t and more Americans will die, but what does he care? He will still be greeted with applause at the UN and in Brussels after all.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>The Mexicans stupidly rejected any instance of a murder in the beginning, doubting the wife&rsquo;s account no matter how authentic it obviously was.</p>
<p>Because they didn&rsquo;t care wht happened to a Gringo they weren&rsquo;t about to to initiate a thorough search.</p>
<p>Well, now that one of their own has had his head delivered to them, are they going to continue on with the same mantra and claim that the investigator could still be alive, because all they have is a dead head?</p>
<p>It sounds silly I know, but doesn&rsquo;t everything coming from them sound that way? </p>

		<p>I would like to hear what South Com and SOCOM and all those folks in the snake eater brigades assigned to Central and South America have to say about this.</p>
<p>Targeting is the key to counter terror ops and &#8216;optimistically&rsquo;, I would like to think that we wired for sound both the Cartels, the Federales and Mexican Telecomms in general -long ago-.  And so have a complete dispositional as well as TOE level orbat on them with which to cut the head off the snake as it slithers from hide to hide.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have a feeling that, without this kind of explicit and longterm buildup of intel gathering (probably &#8216;denied&rsquo; due to NAFTA friendships and politics), both electronic and electrooptic, we are looking more at a comic strip moment-</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/3ycymdl" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/3ycymdl</a></p>
<p>Than the opening to a successful campaign against &#8216;just the drug lords&rsquo; (what if that label encompasses most of Northern Mexico&rsquo;s population?).</p>
<p>And we all know how it turned out with Pancho.</p>
<p>Given I also still believe that what was tongue-in-cheek portrayed (between SecState and the Drug Lord&rsquo;s Intel guy in the hotel scene) during &#8216;Clear And Present Danger&rsquo; is a very real profit motive on BOTH sides of the border fence; it seems likely to me that there is more going on with the Hartley murder itself than meets the eye.</p>
<p>If not, then the Mexicans are trading beans for billion$ in escalating and expanding a war that has no practical gain for them, north of the border.  We need to find out why they have gone so explicit and public and remove the reason for their stupidity.</p>

		<p>Here is a link about the Los Zetas. On Spike TV they have a series called Gangland and as I watched it last week it was about the Los Zetas in Texas. EVERY White American needs to watch it and see what we are in for. The politicians in the USA for decades have set us (Whites) up for the takeover. Ask yourself why and who is operating behind the scenes in D.C.</p>

		<p>Obama and gang are too busy hitting the trial looking for votes to notice.  His re-election is on the hook if he does not work the crowds two years ahead of time.  20,000 fools came out in Wis. to listen to his garbage but the pols still did not move in favor for his stooge.  He even sent out his wife who doesn&rsquo;t look very sincere in her speeches. </p>

		<p>So then the Americano husband WAS killed then as the wife said occurred? Seems so. And yet the &#8220;authorities&#8221; had not totally believed what the woman told them. The &#8220;story&#8221; was thought to have a fictional aspect to it? NO!</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s time for our troops to come home and fight the war right here in our own backyard. Mexico is a corrupt, violence-ridden, uncontolled mess. If it were just going to implode on itself, that would be one thing. But with the proximity to the US and the overflow of these criminals into our country, it&rsquo;s way past time for our government to do something. I don&rsquo;t know how many American casulities we are supposed to ignore before Washington takes charge. This administration, as several previous ones, has sold its soul for votes and cheap labor. Our forefathers must be spinning. What a disgusting collection of traitors we&rsquo;ve elected. Will we do any better Nov. 2, 2010 and Nov. 2012?</p>

Actually, I think the moment is ripe to launch a criminal case against Barack Obama.  Remember when Obama supposedly said &#8220;Look we aren&rsquo;t going to move on border security until we get Amnesty!&#8221;?  That was an instigating act which, because it was denied became conspiratory.</p>
<p>Given there have been other attacks on this side of Lake Falcon specifically and all along the border in general (bullets across the fence not withstanding), there is a firm Constitutional case to be made that as POTUS, this man has a fiduciary responsibility to protect -all- members of the United States from threats foreign and domestic.</p>
<p>If you can &#8216;postively assert&rsquo; (via SOF capture and testimony of Miguel Trevino, cartel boss for the area) that the drug runners would not be there if proper border security closed the smuggling route AND that David Hartley would not have been on the Mexican side of the lake if said border was enforced _from our side_, then it becomes reasonable to assume that Obama was complicit in an act of negligence resulting in Hartley&rsquo;s death.  </p>
<p>It is furthermore arguable that his greater responsibility as Chief Executive means he had the power and should have had the knowledge to prevent this, based on prior incidents.</p>
<p>Though it&rsquo;s late leaving the tube, I think this could be the torpedo which sinks Obama&rsquo;s Presidency, if only the right people (i.e. the Democrats, cutting him loose as a &#8216;bipartisan act&rsquo; in Congress) make a loud enough noise to shake up the administration with an independent counsel investigation as happened with Nixon.</p>
<p>I bet there is a tape, somewhere, that could &#8216;make it official&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Predator drones armed with AGM-114N Hellfires would seem appropriate here.  If decapitating a cop sends a &#8220;message&#8221;, then so does blowing a murderous narco-jefe to bits.  An added advantage is that at only $68,000 for a missile, blowing them up is cheaper than prison.  Doing this would pass legal muster because the Posse Comitatus law has been relaxed to allow the armed forces to play an active part in combatting the drug trade.  The 111th Reconaissance Squadron is based at Ellington Field in Houston, so is ideally situated for this work.  Other parts of the border could be patrolled by drones of the 214th Squadron, at Davis-Monthan AFB in Arizona.  The Department of Homeland Security has already used an unarmed reaper drone for border patrol work.  Before crashing due to operator error, this drone flew 959 hours, participated in 2300 arrests which saw the seisure of four vehicles and 8000 lbs of marijuana.  The border patrol currently operates six reapers, one each on North Dakota and new York, and four in Arizona.  The infrared cameras on both types make them very useful for night-time border surveillance, and endurance is typically 14 hours, though this has been extended in at least one flight to 40 hours, probably by using drop tanks on some or all of the weapons stations. </p>

		<p>We are going to HAVE to deal with these little two-bit Mexican gangs whether we like it or not, because more and more of OUR citizens are going to get killed.  (I still don&rsquo;t understand why that young lady and her husband were riding jet skis on the Mexican side of the lake, church or no   &mdash;   they had lived in Mexico for quite a few months and were VERY much aware of the danger posed by the cartels).  But I digress.  My suggestion is to send in the United States Marine Corps, give them carte blanche in terms of deciding what actions to take, with the express mission of eliminating any and all members of the drug cartels throughout the country of Mexico.  If some civilians get killed, that&rsquo;s an undesirable side effect, but not reason to abandon the mission.  Just let the Marines go after &#8216;em until they are all gone.  After that, they could get rid of the oligarchs who run the country as well, set up a modified form of socialist democracy there (the people there are too uneducated to handle full democracy), and come victoriously home with mission accomplished.</p>

<p>That is why, for his many many many faults, I don&rsquo;t have the hard on for Hugo Chavez that most right wingers have.  Like you seem to think per your post, I also tend to think that the ideal form of government for Indoamericans (both for them and for us) is a relatively strong populist-left strong man, who has much more power than an average white person (much less white American) is comfortable to let a head of state wield, and overseeing a social welfare state much larger than the American ideal, but probably akin to Sweden. </p>
<p>Such a government or scheme is probably the only way the average Indoamerican can have any semblance of a standard of living in their own countries.  If they can see some direct correlation between minerals and resources coming out of the ground, and food going in their mouths - medicine going in their veins - etc., they wouldn&rsquo;t want to sneak across our border. </p>
<p>Notice there is not a big stream of Venezuelans wanting to &#8220;immigrate&#8221; here, nor are drug gangs really a problem at all in the country.</p>
<p>This is why I wanted Luis Obrador to win the last Mexican election.  The next Mexican elections are in 2012, and hope that Obrador&rsquo;s party wins big time.</p>

		<p>TO ANONYMOUS,</p>
<p>You are absolutely correct on the high probability that groups from INSCOM to 3letters have been developing a full scale politicio-economic-criminal sitrep on Mexico and/or orbat on the narcoterrorist groups. </p>
<p>On the other hand, as of 1999 the CIA had at most 1/2 an analyst to producing finalized reports-yes thats right, one half of a person!  Furthermore, as you suggested, given the collaboration of high level decisionmakers with the Mexican elite and its narco-terror grocer boys, it is also highly likely that any finished intelligence on Mexico is STRICTLY limited to the most naughty narcoterrorist cells. Consequently, any wiring we are doing is strictly to mitigate the worst offenders or those not in the collaboration. </p>
<p>Therefore, there must be further resources put towards gathering intelligence and preparing the battlefield.  By utilizing local and border protection intelligence in a more systematic manner, we could exploit their assets and fill in many of the blanks. Once that is done we would have an accurate target picture.  By simple analysis, for the last two weeks I considered the likely number of leaders in Narco-terror networks from small-unit level on up, combined that figure with likely op-sec units working with them, and estimated there is likely total target population of approximately a minimum of 3,000 and a maximum of 10,000.  </p>
<p>If we managed to paint the routes of these individuals, once leathal strikes were authorized, using two specop groups with robust transportation, service support, and air assets, we would have a high likelihood of killing the targets within 5-7 days. Of course, all that would depend on the will of national leadership and the ability to prepare the battlefield and support the teams with enough supporting elements.</p>
<p>Either we do it now, or the situation deteriorates further to the point where full scale conventional war of national survival is neccessary.  Worse, even if we undertook such a campaign now, the other problems stemming from Mexico and inside the country would lead to further escalation.  But as the saying say, if war is to come, better it come early rather than later. </p>
