<h1><a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_16433517">Texas Sheriff Highlights Border-Security Problems in Face of Increasing Drug-Cartel Violence in Mexico</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kevin Vaughan, Denver Post, October 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The federal government is ignoring an explosion of Mexican drug violence that increasingly threatens Americans, according to the Texas sheriff thrust into the national spotlight by the apparent murder of a Colorado native on a lake straddling the border.</p>
<p>And Zapata County Sheriff Sigifredo Gonzalez Jr. predicted more trouble ahead  &mdash;  and the possibility that terrorists could infiltrate the United States along the 2,000 miles of border stretching from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gonzalez had scheduled the talk about a week before the Sept. 30 death of David Hartley, who has not been seen since his wife, Tiffany, reported that he was shot on the Mexican side of Falcon Reservoir during a sightseeing trip. {snip}</p>
<p>Tiffany Hartley later told investigators that she and her husband were approached by armed men in three small boats, and after they turned to flee the gunmen opened fire, hitting David Hartley in the head. She fled, chased by gunmen in one of the boats.</p>
<p>David Hartley&rsquo;s body has not been recovered, and the search has been suspended. A Mexican investigator involved in the case was later murdered, his head delivered to an Army official in a suitcase, in a dramatic incident that underscored the violence wrought as drug cartels have taken control of large swaths of the border.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She [Tiffany Hartley, widow of David Hartley] said that the same day her husband was shot, a young boy was killed in Brownsville, Texas, in a crime carried out by cartel members. The boy&rsquo;s family won&rsquo;t speak out, however, out of fear, nor will people living in America with relatives in Mexico, Hartley said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a presentation stretching nearly three hours, Gonzalez painted a shocking picture of violence along the border  &mdash;  of drug smugglers easily crossing the border, of law officers and ranchers killed, of bodies dismembered as macabre warnings to rivals, of cartels infiltrating cities across the United States, including several in Colorado. {snip}</p>
<p>But Gonzalez said the federal government ignores the problem, repeatedly dismissing his concerns and  &mdash;  in the process  &mdash;  losing a foothold in an ongoing battle through the unwillingness to secure the border.</p>

		<p>The government is ignoring the problem to placate latinos.  Plain and simple.  Latinos have started adopting the group-think thing, so if any negative news comes out about individual latinos, the entire group takes it as an insult.</p>
<p>Blacks have been thinking like this for years, and our media downplays black crime as a result.  Now with latinos doing this, all we will see in the media is what we&rsquo;ve been seeing lately: happy latinos taking their rightful place in this country, smiling, no problems, just like everyone else.</p>
<p>So why do these cartels seem to have SO MANY foot soldiers EVERYWHERE?  I work with latinos.  Most of the adults are nice and hardworking, but most of the under 25 crowd is so full of gangbangers and really stupid young people - you won&rsquo;t believe it!  They listen to that reggaton, bachahta and mexican drug-glorification music 24/7.  It&rsquo;s like religious programming to make them live fast and loose.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t study.  They follow every whim of the body whenever it happens.  They&rsquo;re looking for fast money and excitement.  And because most of them are illegal they feel they have nothing to lose.  They fall into the criminal life by the hundreds of thousands each year.</p>

		<p> I think it&rsquo;s funny how much we have changed. If this were 1890 we&rsquo;d simply organise a posse and go down and shoot every mexican we found for a week. If this were the 900&rsquo;s we&rsquo;d simply send the army down and takeover the goverment and punish them for their temerity. Now that it&rsquo;s 2010 we simply wring our hands and plead for peace from them.</p>

<p>The government is ignoring the problem to placate globalists - corporations that employ cheap, questionable labor, big-money liberals, the media, etc.</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;We all know in law enforcement it&rsquo;s much easier to prevent a burglary or a murder than solve it later on,&#8221; he said.</i></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s politics talking.  Courts have ruled that law enforcement has no obligation to prevent crime (and thus citizens have no legal recourse if law enforcement ignores or fails to respond in a timely fashion to their pleas for help).</p>
<p>The cops are there to assign blame after the fact.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not certain the government is ignoring the problem to placate either the latinos or the globalists.  I think the government is ignoring the problem because ignoring problems is what US governments have done for two decades.  The last few administrations have thrown us a few dog-and-pony shows like Iraq and Afghanistan, but these are really just window dressing, intended to cover up a level of apathy and ineffectiveness that has reached an art form; the successful extortion of our tax money by North Korea was a classic example; they took the payments, went on to build an atom bomb anyway, and then torpedoed and sank a South Korean ship in South Korean territorial waters.  Washington&rsquo;s official laziness has effectively guaranteed that countries can do this sort of thing with no comebacks.  Even the &#8220;nation-building&#8221; efforts in Iraq are a farce; the government there is so corrupt that if we replaced them with all of the greediest, venal Americans we could find, it would still be an improvement.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t expect solutions to problems from the US government; that&rsquo;s not what they do.</p>
