<h1><a href="https://msnbc.msn.com/id/39604538/ns/world_news-europe/">Far-Right Support Surges In Vienna</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Veronika Oleksyn, MSNBC, October 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The far-right resurged in local elections Sunday in Vienna, the Austrian capital, securing the biggest gains in votes and mandates following a campaign laced with anti-Islamic rhetoric.</p>
<p>With only absentee ballots left to be counted, the anti-immigration Freedom Party won 27 percent and 28 seats in the regional parliament  &mdash;  up from 13. That&rsquo;s a significant boost from the 14.8 percent they garnered during 2005 elections, and near their record high of 27.9 percent, achieved in 1996, when the late Joerg Haider was at the party&rsquo;s helm.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Social Democrats took the lead with 44.2 percent of the vote  &mdash;  down from 49.1 percent in 2005. But with just 49 seats to call their own, down from 55, they lost their absolute majority and will now have to look for a coalition partner.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The center-right People&rsquo;s Party, meanwhile, also suffered big losses, dropping from 18.8 percent in 2005 to 13.2 percent or 13 seats. It had previously held 18. The Greens placed fourth with 12.2 percent, or 10 seats, down from 14.6 five years ago. It lost four mandates.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the end, the Freedom Party connected best with predominantly male and less educated voters aged 20 to 29 or above 60, according to the Vienna-based Institute for Social Research and Analysis.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In response to the Freedom Party, the young Social Democrats handed out a comic that portrayed Strache as brain-dead and remote-controlled and in which a hero named &#8220;Mr. X&#8221; beats up Nazi zombies.</p>

		<p>As always, anybody in favor of reducing immigration is labeled far right.  (Especially by media outlets like MSNBC, the Obama station).  You can be pro-environment, in favor of labor unions, and an advocate of a variety of government run social services, but if you want to reduce immigration you&rsquo;re irredeemably right wing.</p>

		<p>From the perspective of this outsider, there is more hope for Austria than perhaps any other white country. In recent times, affluence has been enough to distract most whites from their true interests, but in Austria-which is far more affluent than most western countries-the far-right always seems to do well. </p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s what AmRen readers need to do. Support Austria, since the Freedom Party has made substantial gains.</p>
<p>Remember when the Muslims pissed themselves over the cartoon of Mohammed, in a Danish Newspaper? We made regular purchases of Royal Dansk cookies, and King Oscar sardines, from Norway.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a small, token purchase, but one worth making, to support the exports from these Countries, that take a stand against these Racially inferior invaders. </p>

<p>No, it proves that the Far-Left (marxists) are the biggest enemy of the white race in history.</p>

		<p>Griffin had too much of a Neo-Nazi past and sadly there wasn&rsquo;t enough trust among BNPers for Nick to get someone cleaner to run the party on his behalf. Continental Germanic nationalism as a whole is cleaner by comparison but can they self-identify as ethnic kin first &amp; party members second? That&rsquo;ll determine longterm success or failure</p>

		<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen any data as to the percent of voters in Austria who are from Asia or Africa. In the US, that data is available. Indeed the Democrats use it to turn out the black and Latino votes. Are these &#8220;immigrants&#8221;, most of whom in europe are legal, unfortunately, able to vote?  In the US, generally a legal resident can&rsquo;t vote, a citizen can. Is this true in Europe?</p>
<p>If these Muslims, Africans and other non-whites can vote, the Freedom Party, the BNP and other defenders of tradition are doomed. The socialists and business oriented conservative parties will pander to the cheap labor if it has not only numbers, but votes. </p>
<p>The existence of a large African American and Latino vote in the US means that restoration of pre-1960 European/American values in the US is a pipedream in the contemporary constitutional framework.</p>

There are currently estimated some two million residents &#8220;with migrant background&#8221; (i.e. some 25% of the population), some half of them citizens; plus some half a million to a million illegals.<br>
The EU is pushing municipal voting rights for non-citizens. And in some districts in Vienna, nonwhite kindergartners and elementary schoolers are already a majority.<br>
- So much for the bad news<br>
Non-citizens are entitled to benefits but not currently to vote, and there is no birthright citizenship (which is bad enough; when I left the army 25 years ago, I realized that my father - who had literally worked his back off - with three children got less in wages AND benefits than a Vietnamese fresh off the boat with three children got in benefits alone without lifting one finger. This has been pared down somewhat but is still very much with us, making Austria a prime destination for Third World dregs. However, it bears putting that into perspective. The majority of &#8220;immigrants&#8221; came from Turkey and Yugoslavia, and the first generation came to work. Although &#8220;less integrated&#8221;, they pose far fewer problems than the second and third (interesting effect, but visible in Hispanics in the US also).<br>
Some of them, I may note, are even rabid supporters of the FPÖ, particularly Kurds and Croatians.<br>
There are still relatively few blacks; one major recent problem are Eastern European, particularly Romanian, gypsies. Well organized gangs of beggars, cutpurses and burglars, but with EU citizenship, you cannot deport them any longer.</p>
<p>- But I digress.<br>
The trends in the election have been obvious for quite some time, but I think no one expected such an avalanche. HC Strache is a bit young and lacking in charisma and academic credentials, and his campaign was deliberately stupid (i.e. he is not the Second Coming of Haider). That he still managed as well means two things:<br>
- The potential is probably quite a bit larger.(it bears noting Le Pen always had his best results in Marseilles)<br>
- The demonizations by all the other parties greatly helped him.<br>
He took the White working class from the socialists (not a mean feat in &#8220;Red Vienna&#8221; after about a century - with some, erm, hiatus, that is) and young White males went for him. Young White females went Green - and here we are with the bad news again.<br>
The Green top candidate is a Turkish woman MP, with the usual idiosyncrasies. And to think that my ancestors spent centuries battling the balja and protecting the Occident; Count Starhemberg must be spinning in his grave (g).</p>
<p>The strategic significance of the result as far as I can discern (Häupl, the current socialist mayor, is a decent enough fellow and a zoologist - the ideal qualification ;) is that it forced all parties (with the usual exception of Greens and Communists) to concede that nonwhites in Austria &#8220;have to follow rules&#8221;.</p>
<p>This IS a victory (though I´d like to see a bit more ;).</p>

		<p>#12, nokangaroo, thank you for your well-informed response to my inquiry about the voting rights of non-citizens in Austria or other afflicted nations. It had the data we need, and was written with historical and personal perspective that I know practically all of us here deeply appreciate.</p>
<p>We do have our work cut out for us, world-wide.</p>
