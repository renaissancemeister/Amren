<h1>Cheerleader Kicked Off Squad for Refusing to Cheer for Her Attacker</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jessica Wakeman, The Frisky, October 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Texas high school has taken &#8220;school spirit&#8221; to the extreme and kicked a cheerleader off the squad after she refused to cheer for a football player who sexually assaulted her. According to Ms. magazine, player Rakheem Jamal Bolton, 19, of Silsbee High School in Hardin County, TX, and two other males were accused of sexually assaulting a female student (identified only as H.S.) in 2008 at a post-game party. H.S. claims the three young men forced her into a room, locked the door, held her down and sexually assaulted her. Other party-goers tried to get in the room and two of the three men, including Bolton, fled through the window.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>H.S. took Bolton and the other two young men to court in September 2010, where he pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of assault. Bolton was sentenced to a year in prison, but the sentence was suspended and he&rsquo;ll stay out of jail as long as he does not violate the terms of probation. {snip} Bolton told the local news station about H.S.&rsquo;s accusations, &#8220;I feel like it was just a misunderstanding.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now Bolton is back at Silsbee High School, playing on the basketball team, and H.S. is still a cheerleader. When it came time for the cheerleading squad to cheer the players by name during their free throws, H.S. refused to cheer for &#8220;Rakheem.&#8221; Refusal to cheer got her kicked off the team. Her parents sued the school, {snip} but a court tossed the case out, reasoning: &#8220;{snip} [Not cheering for Bolton] constituted substantial interference with the work of the school because, as a cheerleader, [she] was at the basketball game for the purpose of cheering, a position she undertook voluntarily.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, if the school tells her she has to cheer for her attacker, she has to cheer for her attacker.</p>
<p>{snip} But the real question is: If Rakheem Bolton was accused of rape and pleaded guilty to assault, why is he allowed to play for Silsbee High School sports teams at all? America really does let its sports stars do anything, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>

						<p>
							<i>Amy Collins and Blair Ortmann, Beaumont Enterprise, October 21, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Two of three Silsbee High School football players charged in the rape of a cheerleader were free today on bond, a Hardin County jail official said.</p>
<p>Three Silsbee High School football players were arrested Monday after a cheerleader told police she was raped at a party following the Tigers&rsquo; game Friday night, Silsbee Police Chief Dennis Allen said.</p>
<p>Christian Paul Roundtree, 18, Rakeem Bolton, 17, and a 16-year-old male, whose name was not released because he is a minor, were charged with sexually assaulting a child, Allen said. None of the teens has a criminal record, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police were called about 1:20 a.m. Saturday to a house in the Pruitt Addition in the northwest section of Silsbee, Allen said.</p>
<p>A 16-year-old told police that she was sexually assaulted and described three to four attackers. Police were investigating whether alcohol was present at the party, he said.</p>
<p>The girl was taken to Christus St. Elizabeth Hospital, where doctors administered a rape kit, Allen said. The kit will be sent to Texas Department of Public Safety, with results taking up to four months.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A fourth male was a suspect but now is serving as a witness, Allen said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Silsbee High School&rsquo;s football roster lists the two named players as Christopher Rountree, a running back and defensive back, and Rakheem Bolton, a wide receiver and defensive back.</p>
<p>The incident occurred after the Silsbee Tigers won their first District 21-3A game, beating Bridge City 21-0. {snip}</p>

		<p>You know it digusts me to see they way they &#8220;Cheer&#8221; nowadays. But I have seen a couple of articles recently on cheer revolts. One was because the girls felt that ghetto shorts and bare midriffs went to far. The other was that their moves were too suggestive and demeaning. It seems that we may have an inner circle that see things more clearly than their own parents. <br>
  I`m hoping and praying to see them get back to poodle skirts and ponytails, popular culture be damned&hellip;But I`m not holding my breath.</p>

		<p>Imagine if white guys sexually assaulted a non-white women.  Same issues otherwise, would they have been allowed to continue on the team?  Would the violated women of color have been required to cheer the white offenders?  </p>
<p>Now recall the Duke Lacrosse team of white boys falsely accused of molesting a black non-school professional stripper.  They were thrown off the team, the team was abolished, the faculty demanded their punishment, and the Dean concurred.  All before an investigation or a trial of guilt.  </p>
<p>Yes there is discrimination and bias, but it towards white people.</p>
<p>BTW, in Australia its professional sports players are under strict personal behavior rules.  Public disturbances can result in dismissal from the team.  Criminal behavior will result in dismissal from the team.  And their behavior, white and black, is very good.  Something we should consider here.  Equality that is.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, I think it should probably be the girl&rsquo;s parents for letting their underage daughter in an after-party without adult supervision and every bedroom door locked and barred.</p>
<p>I do wonder at the color of this girl&rsquo;s skin because if there were more than 2 white males at that party, not only would that door be down in a heartbeat but there would be no question that every white girl there would have an escort to watch over her.  Even if they had to be herded together in a corner to do it.</p>
<p>A black girl might not get the same treatment and might honestly be dumb enough to think &#8216;one was fun&rsquo; but try to (too late) object to a gangbang environment.</p>
<p>At least that&rsquo;s the Texas -I- remember.</p>
<p>It also should not take four months to get a rape kit review.  Certainly no one should be allowed to plea down to simple assault (which, at least in Colorado is a _misdemeanor_) when they started out at Rape-1 (co-conspirator friends = planning as a function of exceeding the 1v.Many force threshold of a &#8216;misunderstanding&rsquo;).</p>
<p>So reopen the case as a civil rights issue.  The barring of the young woman from the cheerleader squad and the imposition of a lesser penalty before trial should be enough to make it clear she is suffering from discriminatory mistreatment at the hands of local authorities.  If the Feds can get two bites at the apple with those white kids that beat up the Hispanic pedo in the park, they should be able to &#8216;find&rsquo; some justice here too.</p>
<p>At a minimum, none of those _men_ should proft from their &#8216;athletic abilities&rsquo; for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>Rakheem admitted his guilt to raping a minor when he was of age and got probation? Well, he is a star athlete.</p>
<p>And Chris certainly is a mixed one. He has the makings of a good Black Muslim. He too is a star athlete, isn&rsquo;t he? What else.</p>

		<p>They pleaded guilty, they should not be allowed to continue in school much less to play on any sports team. The girl was assulted/raped, and will now be mentally raped every time she sees her attackers in the hallway. And let me guess, the rapists didn&rsquo;t have a father figure at home, or at least not one worth anything who should have instilled a sense of respect within their sons.  And not to blame the girl (at least not completely), but where were her friends? Where were the parents? It&rsquo;s a hard way to learn a lesson, but maybe from here on she&rsquo;ll be a bit more wary of those around her and to her safety.</p>

		<p>In texas, football ranks up there with religion.<br>
A number of years ago some high-school football players harassed and KILLED a non-jock.  The jury in their court case would NOT convict them of anything.  You see, these &#8220;kids&#8221; were on the award winning football team and could not possibly be guilty of the crime (even though there were eyewitnesses to the crime).  The &#8220;kid&#8221; they murdered was guilty of not being like them, not well-to-do like the jock&rsquo;s families.<br>
ANY community or state that promotes this type of behavior is not worth living in or even visiting.</p>

		<p>4 Jeddermann:</p>
<p>More and more parents are &#8220;redshirting&#8221; their young sons, i.e. starting them in on KG at the age of 6 instead of 5, for the expressed purpose of their turning 19 during their H.S. Senior year.  Of course, the purpose is for sports   &mdash;   They&rsquo;ll do better if they&rsquo;re a year older than their classmates.  But so many are doing this that the competitive advantage for any one doing it is narrowing.  Some school districts are trying to discourage it by prohibiting anyone who has turned 19 from being on teams, even though they can still take classes.</p>
<p>In the case of Mr. Bolton, (we are not told if he is a Senior   &mdash;   Don&rsquo;t assume that he is, in spite of his age), my guess is that he was held back a grade or two or three in elementary or middle school, or in the case of high school, he didn&rsquo;t earn enough credits in one or more years to advance technically from Freshman to Sophomore to Junior to Senior in successive school years.  The way most HSs work is that your &#8220;year&#8221; is based on how many credits you&rsquo;ve earned as a fraction of fourths of what you need to graduate.  For example, if 24 credits are needed for graduation, then you have to earn 6 to advance from Fr to So, So to Jr, Jr to Sr, and Sr to graduate.  But if you flunk 4 of your 6 classes in Fr year, then you&rsquo;re still a &#8220;Freshman&#8221; even starting your second year of HS.  Flunk 4 of 6 again, and you&rsquo;ll still be a &#8220;Freshman&#8221; at the start of your third year.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The Frisky&#8221; is a webzine published by the Ted Turner organization.<br>
It seems to be oriented to young women, and has a soft feminist presentation. I am surprised at its tolerant attitude toward sexual assault of women. Although it the perps had been white, the attitude might well have been harsher.</p>

		<p>&#8220;None of the teens has a criminal record&#8221; could easily be due to the feral savage&rsquo;s records being wiped clean while, and because,  they were juveniles.  And 19 years old, and he is still in high school?  He probably can&rsquo;t spell or write his own name.  Back when I was in high school if the athletes did not keep their grades up they were off the team.  These low-life punks should be in the slammer.</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t it interesting, how what used to be a rarity in the NFL back when the league was dominated by white athletes (1950s through approximately the mid-to-late 1970s), but which is now a common form of typical behavior by the black dominated NFL - and, now, we see the black high school jocks aping the same behavior that they see coming from their older black &#8220;heroes&#8221; in the NFL?  </p>
<p>Oh, and for those of us who are familiar with the outstanding newspaper &#8216;The Nationalist Times&rsquo;, and their Caste Football website, we fully understand that the reduction of good, wholesome, positive, law-abiding, white athletic role models from the NFL is not due to lack of skill or talent.  The idea is to get our white sons and white daughters worshiping these inner city ghetto thugs, and choosing to adopt &#8216;black culture&rsquo; and &#8216;black behavior&rsquo;, and all the socially and racially destructive garbage that goes along with it.  </p>
<p>Its all part of the war being waged by the forces of Cultural Marxism on traditional White, Christian America.<br>

		<p>If this was my daughter I would take justice into my own hands. Clearly the system is broken when violent thugs get a slap on the wrist for RAPE! He should have been kicked off the team. He will end up with a scholarship to some University where he will continue &#8220;dating&#8221; women. Remember diversity and tolerance of other cultures trumps any rules of white conduct.</p>

		<p>So forcible rape x 3 = misdemeanor plea bargain in Hardin County, TX? Sounds like they have the same kind of judges there that we have here in Memphis. Attempted murder gets plead down by black judges on a regular basis in these parts while local newscasters wring their hands over crime in the black community caused by repeat offenders.    </p>

		<p>Why, this rape is actually in the paper. Isn&rsquo;t it time another &#8216;To Kill a Mocking Bird&rsquo; media event is hoisted on the public in order that we learn to properly &#8216;fight stereotypes&rsquo;? So we learn who the real victims are? At least this is what we do when negative stereotypes fall upon saints of color. If it&rsquo;s white bad behavior, we turn not debunking it, but examining it in full, into a science. </p>

		<p>You all know that non-whites are held to a lower standard in all things than the rest of us.</p>
<p>Where I work, I have seen blacks doing things that would get any white person thrown out/arrested in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>But we all (at my job) pretend that it&rsquo;s okay and we make excuses for their behavior.  I say nothing because my heart breaks a little more every time I see a little sliver of &#8220;Old America&#8221; falling into the trash heap.</p>

		<p>I remember when I was in high school (class of 2007). The pecking order was fierce, especially since the athletes were at the top. I always found it amusing that the white suburban females who were in my classes always fell for the black athletes. Of course there were white athletes who acted just as stupid as the black guys. </p>
<p>I was never an athlete myself, but most of the females would generally tease the non-jocks up until the athletes decided that it was time to get attention for themselves. For example, there was this cute white girl who always teased me and made me think that she was interested in me. She had a football player friend who would go up behind her and grab her ankles or wrists and then pretend to punch her in the face. This happened on a near daily basis.</p>
<p>Back to the white suburban girls liking the black athletes. There was this one mulatto football player that through the course of three years had went with at least three white girls in our school (not including outside) with no breathing room in between. I actually came close to dating one of the cheer leaders, but she later dumped me without notice for a black basketball player.</p>
<p>After carefully studying these groups in high school, I realize where all the violence comes from. All athletes are encouraged by their coaches and parents to dominate their opponents, or people they deem inferior, on the field. However, they do not leave this sentiment on the field. They try to dominate both the females and non-athletes and in some cases they succeed. I find it disgusting that the coaches, school administrators and parents care more about winning a game then to keep their players in line. The people in charge knew that they were a threat but always swept it under the rug to beat our rivals in the next game. </p>

		<p>I agree with #26.  I graduated HS in &#8216;99 and it was the same then.  The coaches train these guys to be dominant and merciless on the field.  The only interesting case is the QB. he&rsquo;s the &#8216;brains&rsquo;, the leader of the team.  The rest are beaten into submission to &#8216;follow the play&rsquo;, &#8216;execute the play&rsquo;, &#8216;follow the leader&rsquo;.  This tribal hierarchy scenario plays out off the field. The ringleader in the gang rape was only &#8216;ordering&rsquo; the other two to go along. He called the play.  They were just beating down the dorks/geeks b/c they&rsquo;re told to dominate those deemed inferior. don&rsquo;t you see? We pay to see them damage and dominate each other. For their &#8216;sacrifice&rsquo;, we give them leniency for actions out of the arena.  Not much has changed since the Roman Colosseum (gladius, root of gladiator and a sarcastically given to the type of &#8216;thrusting sword&rsquo;, was &#8216;penis&rsquo;. we have historically linked the brawny warrior/combatant with the phallus).  </p>
<p>As for the white girls,  yes, they&rsquo;re being aggressively set on by the players.  They&rsquo;re intent is to dominate and subjugate the white females. Every female (god, especially in HS) wants a strong alpha-like male, with money to spend on her, a car to drive her around in, power/influence to get them class pres / prom queen / etc (we all know jocks get a full-pass to do whatever they want b/c they win games).  And we all know that black and mulattos are &#8220;gifted with anaconda penises&#8221;. The white slave owners bred them all the be big &#8216;n strong to get all that great work done &#8220;building &#8216;merica&#8221;.  Girls are trained by TV/magazines to be oversexed and seek-out what is deemed to be the all-star black baller. The &#8216;lady in the street, whore in the bedroom&rsquo; mentality usually gets derailed when she realizes Rakheem, DeShawn, LaTron, whatever, has brought along 2,3,4+ of his homies for the fun.  </p>
<p>The tragedy is that the media are often correct when they turn around, point, and say &#8220;she was doggin&rsquo; them and was ASKING for it!&#8221;  odds are, she was - or hinted/suggested/joked about &#8216;oh yea, big boy, gang me&rsquo; like they do in the &#8216;movies&rsquo; (and probably after plying her with a good bit of alcohol).  They know this to be true b/c they&rsquo;ve been pushing that whore-mentality to our youth.  Girls are &#8220;all hoes&#8221; and all guys should be pimp wrangling them; it&rsquo;s your duty.</p>
<p>As Burgess wrote for Alex in ACO regarding the gang-mentality and criminal behavior:</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you not everything you need? If you need a motor car, you pluck it from the trees. If you need pretty polly, you take it.&#8221;<br>

<p>I was one of the few kids who did not take any stuff from the athletes because I stood up to them may times to avoid being run over by them. I remember in my freshmen year I got into two fights. The first was with this black guy who was a side kick to one of the white football players. He got up into my face and I punch him three times in his face. I punched him so hard that he fell backwards. Eventually the coach/teacher intervened and pulled me away from the guy. A security guard pulled the black kid into the hall where he was shouting anti-white slurs. </p>
<p>The second fight was about a week after my first fight. This time it was with a wrestler/baseball player. This guy was borderline retarded and he thought it would be funny to sneak over and take my back pack away from me. I realized what he was doing, I got up from my seat and proceeded to pummel him with my fists. He just stood there and took the punches. The teacher walked into the room and found that I had him pushed up against a work table and was beating him up. He pulled me off the guy and sent me to the principal where I got suspended for four days. For the rest of the year the guy swore up and down that I had lost the fight and he won. Up until graduation his football buddies reminded me that I would never get that lucky again. </p>
<p>We seem to be denigrating into a society where people think that it is okay to run over other people and that the ones that we deem inferior are bot allowed to take up for themselves. This is why such things as rape robbery and other anti-social behavior is likely to rise in the coming years.  It is already getting bad enough that many people are walking around with concealed fire arm permits. </p>

		<p>I personally hate athletes, non-whites in particular. They try to intimidate, threaten, or dominate everyone else, but this Slav is not one to be intimidated easily. I will stand and fight, even if I lose because I am not going to be pushed around. I demonstrated to a couple of these jocks how violent a white man can be when he&rsquo;s had enough of their aggression. I also once told another jock in no uncertain terms that I will shoot and kill him to his face, in front of dozens of others. I would in the place of that girl&rsquo;s father, the one who was raped by these creatures, exact revenge on these jocks by killing them. The only way to put a stop to this is to answer their violence with greater and more brutal violence of our own.</p>

		<p>Do not worry &hellip;.I am sure that some P.C. Television show will take up the case. Of course the victim will be a Black Cheerleader and the attackers white football players&hellip;uumm maybe Lacross players&hellip;.<br>
but,, in the end the girl will rise above the fray and the players will be punished &hellip;maybe even Divinely punished&hellip;  </p>

		<p>I agree with# 28. If we bring back the warrior mentality back to our white children instead of making them submissive to any other race that comes along. We need to teach our european history of how the white race formed the world we are now giving away. These animals we allow in our schools with our children should fear the justice we dispense to anyone who intemidates or harms our children. If my child was injured by one of these beasts,I would exact vengeance upon them and anyone they surround themself with. If you befriend my enemy then you are my enemy. </p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s an article  about this incident but it says  that the two mayates were basketball players, unless of course there have been numerous incidents of rape by Bantus at this particular school.</p>
