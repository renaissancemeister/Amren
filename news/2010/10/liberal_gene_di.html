<h1>&#8216;Liberal Gene&rsquo; Discovered by Scientists</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>London Telegraph, October 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>People with left wing views may have their political opinions controlled by a &#8220;liberal gene&#8221;, according to scientists.</p>
<p>In people who are naturally outgoing, the feature encourages them to seek out companions with unconventional views as they grow up.</p>
<p>This in turn means they tend to form less conventional political viewpoints as adults, according to the study by the University of California and Harvard.</p>
<p>The research, based on 2,000 Americans, is published in the Journal of Politics.</p>
<p>It found those with a strain of the DRD4 gene seek out &#8220;novelty&#8221;  &mdash;  such as people and lifestyles which are different to the ones they are used to.</p>
<p>This leads them to have more liberal political opinions, it found.</p>
<p>The person&rsquo;s age, ethnicity, gender or culture appeared to make no difference  &mdash;  it was the gene which counts.</p>
<p>DRD4 is controlled by dopamine which affects the way the brain deals with emotions, pleasure and pain and can therefore influence personality traits.</p>
<p>UC Professor James Fowler said: &#8220;It is the crucial interaction of two factors  &mdash;  the genetic predisposition and the environmental condition of having many friends in adolescence  &mdash;  that is associated with being more liberal.</p>
<p>&#8220;These findings suggest that political affiliation is not based solely on the kind of social environment people experience.&#8221;</p>

		<p>While I would be the last person to deny that genes play a significant role in determining IQ and many personality traits we shouldn&rsquo;t overlook the importance of environment.  Almost any white liberal could be made into a race realist simply by making him live in a black neighborhood for five years, or requiring that he teach at a school that is 80% or more black for a similar length of time.  After all, just read the September 2010 American Renaissance to see how Tracey Abel was transformed from a liberal into enough of a race realist that she wrote the lead article for that issue.<br>

		<p>Well, according to the Myers-Briggs personality types, these people would be classified as &#8220;intuitive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Intuitives see the spaces between the trees, hear the unspoken words between the emotings, and go back to their childhood experiences when they are triggered by something completely off the wall, such as an oak tree (the oak tree reminds them of the treehouse they had, and the way that one of their friends used to mock them for their bad relationship with their father, etc.).</p>
<p>I am an intuitive.</p>
<p>Sensory types see an oak tree as an oak tree. They note the bark, the leaves, the venation, etc.</p>
<p>The poets, artists, systems analysts, and many politcal analysts  come from the intuitives. Do not confuse us with the immature, the drunks, the hippies; we are sincere in our convictions and are not out for a lark, or for self-agrandisement.   </p>
<p>Regardless of whether it is a gene or the result of experiences, conservatism needs these creative people. They have not exactly been given a hospitable welcome.</p>
<p>Conservatives see us as looney. </p>
<p>Such people as Whitaker Chambers and Ayn Rand were intuitives. </p>
<p>You may despise philosopy and art, but such things determine which way the tree will grow. I have seen you despise such things as ideas and convictions not related to money  &mdash;  but there are those of us who are not motivated by money, and who are motivated by ideas, philosophy and art.</p>
<p>Stop treating us like freakin&rsquo; wierdos  &mdash;  many of us are on your side &hellip; until you run us off. </p>

		<p>The &#8220;liberal gene&#8221; is actually the 7R allele of DRD4.  I already discussed this allele in my video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hSQDArsn_4&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=E55C3431C1E754B2&amp;index=0&amp;playnext=1" rel="nofollow">&#8220;The Genetics of Black Violence.&#8221;</a>  This allele is more common in blacks than whites, and it can also be associated with conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder.  It is widely known as an ADHD gene, as well.  This study did not find that the gene, by itself, is associated with liberalism.  Neither is having many friends, by itself.  Also, the gene is not associated with having many friends.  Many in the media have incorrectly interpreted the study as saying these things.</p>

<p>I agree with all of your above positions.  But today all you need to be is a race realist and you will be branded by the media, the politicians, the academics, and the various NGOs as a right wing extremist, eager to throw people in concentration camps and invade Poland.  So you may as well face it RandyB, you would have been a moderate liberal in the 1950s but today with exactly the same views you are a right wing extremist.<br>

		<p>To WR the Elder I must strenuously disagree with the assumption that placing liberals amongst blacks for any length of time will change them into race realist. I personally know of an individual who was an administrator in an almost all black school for more than 20 years and still is an avid liberal even after all the insanity of blackdom that he was exposed too. He is incurable in his beliefs and values. True Liberalism is an illness of such great proportions that no reality of any kind will transform their thinking. They would rather have everything and everyone around them destroyed than acknowledge that their thought processes are in error. Even a brief glimpse at the state of the white world that has been run by these crazies for decades will prove what I am saying. They are driving our nations, our cultures, our core beliefs and everything that our forefathers have fought and died for for thousands of years into the deep abyss of forgetfulness and oblivion. They brainwash our children into believing that everything that was created by whites and being white itself is evil. They are the enemy. They are destroying us. They are incorrigible and will never change. Unless they are stopped and stopped soon they will drive everything that we have, everything that we love and cherish and everything that the future of our race can bring forth into total and irretrievable extinction.</p>

<p>Well, what about the fact that liberalism is hardly unconventional nor &#8221;novel&#8221; these days? The fact is, liberalism is today&rsquo;s standard, orthodox, conformist attitude, thanks to a couple of generations of miseducation and media propaganda.</p>
<p>Are liberals born, not made? If so, how do we explain the many people who were once liberal in youth and who then became conservative as reality conflicted with true-believism?</p>

		<p>I won&rsquo;t say I doubt this to be true, but I am quite sceptical. Many folks I know, myself included, have held varying political viewpoints throughout their lives, and yes, not a few range from liberal to conservative and back. I suppose there must be something here, but I remain unconvinced on this one.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure genetics plays a hefty role in the (let&rsquo;s call it Lib vs con) dichotomy.<br>
I keep saying  that here, with the added hypothesis that the Libtards have a gene for self annihilation&hellip;a Lemming Gene. They seek unconsciously to cull the human herd of all this overpopulation, by killing themselves, not breeding, and giving up their place to third worlders. I say it&rsquo;s a flawed gene, an abberation, because only relatively smart whites have it, and they have the power to create, and sustain civilization. Third worlders do not.<br>
 <br>
I predict that the Libtards with the Lemming gene will succeed. What will remain is a 99% brown world (folks, it&rsquo;s 93% nonwhite already, whereas 100 years ago, whites were about 50% 0f the world&rsquo;s population  &mdash;  -figure it out!) With whites diminished to tiny enclaves, the browns and blacks   will pop nukes on on each other  immediately, and destroy the whole planet.<br>
I&rsquo;m serious.</p>
<p>Funny, I once knew a very smug Biology professor who said that man would likely not destroy the planet, but make life impossible for himself, and other complex life forms, through overpopulation and environmental destruction. I wonder if the stupid man ever realized that he was only half right. Can you imagine what will happen when white rule is gone. Do you think a Hutu, a Tutsi, an Arab or a Mestizo is gonna&rsquo; think twice before dropping the bomb ? No way. (When did these people EVER think twice&hellip;or once?)<br>
Agree? disagree?<br>
Tell me!</p>

		<p>&#8220;The person&rsquo;s age, ethnicity, gender or culture appeared to make no difference &mdash; it was the gene which counts.&#8221;</p>
<p>And yet it is irrefutable that ethnicity (race) is genetic. It is also well known that certain genes appear more often in some races than in others. Did the researchers actually determine that the DRD4 gene occurs equally amongst all races or did the author of this news report just tack this on to support the party line?</p>

		<p>&#8220;This in turn means they tend to form less conventional political viewpoints as adults&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>But the leftist liberal viewpoint is the conventional viewpoint in modern day America. It is the establishment viewpoint. As always, leftist politics is all about self-esteem, and they remain in adolescent mode: the worst sin is to be uncool and all they say is motivated by the quest to maintain a cool image - whatever that is, even if it leads to the destruction of their country.</p>

<p>Sir, stick around. If you&rsquo;re here, you have your doubts. Be as &#8220;intuitive&#8221; as you&rsquo;d like, but also remember, there&rsquo;s a physical world all around us governed by basic logic and experience. That&rsquo;s where us Conservatives/ White Nationalists  are coming from.</p>

		<p>I agree that there are likely genetic factors influencing political views. The reason why women are consistently as a group more liberal than men in just about all societies is likely a result of all too many women wrongly projecting their maternal insticts to strangers.</p>
<p>However, we shouldn&rsquo;t let this be an excuse for not trying to change the political environment. I don&rsquo;t think whites are that genetically different compared to 200 years ago, yet today most whites believes in views which would be viewed as extreme left-liberalism by almost everyone just 200 years ago. </p>

		<p>Anonymous #6, I don&rsquo;t deny that there are a few True Believers who will stick to the multiculturalism and Hate Whitey doctrine no matter how long their noses are rubbed in reality.  Who knows, maybe that&rsquo;s due to a genetic predisposition.  But I still believe that most whites who are race liberals are that way because of an abundance of indoctrination and a lack of personal experience.  I&rsquo;ve said this before, but it&rsquo;s worth repeating:  Teach For America is Jared Taylor&rsquo;s best covert program for creating race realists.<br>

<p>Good point. One thing Whites have to agree on is the protection of their race and the interests of their people and this means halting immigration. As long as Whites can or if they would agree on this, they can be liberal or whatever on other issues within the framework of a White society.</p>

<p>Please don&rsquo;t be be run off: there are many more similar Americans than anyone realizes. For example, I know a person who follows an Eastern spiritual teacher, meditates, but is a former Special Forces Sgt., owns lots of guns, smokes cigars, and is very conservative. There are many &#8220;conservatives&#8221; from many different cultures. A devout Hindu and a devout Christian might be suprised they agree on most social issues.  </p>

<p>Sounds like our Founding Fathers&hellip;like Jefferson, Franklin, Adams&hellip;you&rsquo;re not alone! <br>
Liberalism is more a problem with Reality Orientation than intuitive or sensory. Intuitives who have had sufficient contact with Reality can both be poetic, artistic, philosophical, compassionate, enrironmentally aware, etc, and &#8220;conservative&#8221;. <br>
For example, the conservative who wants to abolish lifelong welfare is actually MORE compassionate than a Liberal, because he or she understands how destructive it is. </p>

<p>Tell us more about your sincere, intuitive, liberal convictions. Are you one the people who support the policies that are transforming  America into a third world country? Are you one of those who deny the results of any research on racial differences? Do you believe that Blacks are not responsible for turning the neighborhoods they overran into war zones?</p>
<p>If intuition is what blocks critical thinking and survival instinct, then I don&rsquo;t see it as a desirable trait. </p>
<p>See how creative and motivated you feel after a liberal social engineering program such as Section 8 turns your neighborhood into Monrovia.</p>
<p>Those of us who have spent our lives creating the products and systems that turned western society into a place where people like you have enough free time to study philosophy and pseudo-science don&rsquo;t need you as much as you need us. You have no idea how we got to the place you were born into, but you think you have all the answers about how it needs to be changed.</p>
<p>It may shock you to learn that many of the people who are &#8220;them&#8221; to you are not as obsessed with money as you might think. We are, however, obsessed with maintaining the way of life of the historical majority of America. We don&rsquo;t want bars on the windows of our homes. We don&rsquo;t want our children to share their schools with the unruly sons and daughters of people who contribute not one cent to our educational system. We don&rsquo;t want drugs and mindless violence in our neighborhoods. We don&rsquo;t like anyone who supports the politicians who continue to curse our lives with a never ending flood of the domestic descendants of sub-Saharan hut dwellers and unskilled immigrants, both legal and illegal, from throughout the world.</p>
<p>If forced integration and the policies of the EEOC have the tree growing in a direction that pleases you, then you are part of the problem and you will be dealt with accordingly when the political pendulum swings way too far in the other direction in the near future.</p>
<p>You and your ilk would make a lot less enemies if you would use your intuitiveness to figure out how to do nice things for the underclass people without shoving them down our throats.</p>

That puts me squarely in the enemy camp, philosophically, so I have to accept the nuttiness of many of my artist friends. But some of them are gun-toting, anti-big brother, honest to goodness paleoconservatives, too. and even some of those who talk nutty a lot, actually hate the government, and if presses-in private- to confess the truth, have a healthy, normal dose of race reality. </p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a complex lot, even if a lot of us (artists) are too much into crystals, silly myths, and liberal fantasies.</p>
<p>I well know what it&rsquo;s like to feel creepy around evangelicals, and disgusted around marxists. </p>
<p>Individuality combined with wisdom and knowledge is a hard line to walk. Better put, if you ARE wise and a learner by nature&hellip;if you see outside the box, you ARE likely to be an individual, because, politically speaking, you&rsquo;d have a LOT of enemies, and few friends if you spoke your mind.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, the third world is 80% stupid. But the white world is probably 50% stupid, too.</p>
<p>After all, &#8220;average &rsquo; morality or intelligence, it isn&rsquo;t so hot. That&rsquo;s why we call it average. If it&rsquo;s &#8220;average,&#8221; it&rsquo;s 50% bad.</p>
<p>Rock on.</p>

		<p>Interesting.  Of course, as others have said, having the &#8220;liberal gene&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re stuck being an idiot your entire life.  My mother is the perfect example of this.  She voted for Mr. Hussein back in 2008, but in these past few years has made a radical political transformation from being a New Jersey liberal who willingly lived in the ghetto of Camden throughout college and had an abortion back in the eighties, to being a very religious, right-leaning individual.  Unfortunately, she still considers race to be a meaningless trait, but I am working on that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m another example of that.  As a young child, I had a visceral hatred for all things even slightly to the right-of-center, and all things even slightly religious.  I even wished all the conservatives and Christians of the world would just die.  Now, I have made a complete 180; I am very right-of-center, traditional, religious, and racially-minded.  I&rsquo;m not sure what invoked this change, I only thank God it happened.</p>
<p>But my point in that we should not get caught up in the discovery of a &#8220;liberal gene&#8221; - all it means is that some people are more likely to try new things than others.  It probably doesn&rsquo;t have as much sway on a person&rsquo;s political views as the name implies.</p>

<p>DRD4 is interesting, but is an oversimplification, almost certainly.  If IQ involves thousands of genes, then complex political views that vary with the times are certainly polygenic.  There is also the phenomenon of epigenetics (see Wikepedia).  Without altering the DNA, gene expression can be altered.  Since something as simple as a methyl group, or the more complex protein &#8220;histone&#8221; can alter gene function, it is conceivable that consistent good nutrition, or the soft feminine influence of elementary education could influence the gene expression of some higher intellect individuals to an extreme, rather than moderate sense of fairness, which compels them to favor disenfranchised blacks in a blind and compulsive fashion.  Harsh realities such as brain size and neurotransmitter density cause such cognitive dissonance, that they result in forced suppression of knowledge or discussion of these intolerable facts. (does this remind anyone of anything?).  </p>
<p>A possible example is found in Sigmund Freud&rsquo;s book of 1938 &#8220;The Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud&#8221;.  He repeatedly refers to blacks and others as &#8220;the primitive races&#8221;.  I challenge you to find any Jew (or any one) doing that today.  Quite the opposite is more likely.</p>
<p>We, unfortunately can&rsquo;t wait for the rest of the pieces of this puzzle to be assembled to deal with the crushing problems confronting us now.  Empirical evidence proves to many that Western Europeans develop the most desirable societies by a wide margin.  The limiting factor in a world of easy travel is that many from the austere societies of the orient, and many from the lower IQ chronically impoverished and corrupt southern societies are drawn to the open USA.  Disastrously, their very presence will transform this society to one similar to their origins, given a remarkably short period of time.  </p>
<p>What choices do we have?  1 Lose our nation., 2 Deport massively and quickly., 3 Succumb to a strong man., 4 secede in separate enclaves., or something else.  Now, the most likely is 1.</p>

<p>Europeans (&#8220;whites&#8221;) worldwide should achieve a basic consensus that we must SURVIVE as a race, maintain the integrity of our territories (no islamization of europe, no reconquista), and teach our children to be proud of their European heritage.</p>
<p>beyond that, we can agree or disagree about a million other issues, but that is secondary.</p>
<p>what is paramount is that we are agreeing or disagreeing with other Europeans about the future of our - European - cvilization.</p>
<p>many whites are programmed for autogenocide, set for self-destruct.</p>
<p>they must be deprogrammed.</p>
<p>after that, they can think whatever they want about any other issue.</p>
<p>only ONE issue is non-negotiable: the survival of the european race.</p>

		<p>Though I do not know if it will be good or bad, I think &#8216;genetic tinkering&rsquo; as I like to think of it will indeed have a potentially useful outcomes in the short term, given that a useful gene map of 5-10 basic functional psychologies could theoretically expose an (intelligent) individual to the realities of how much  he or she is likely influenced in their cognitive processes if not necessarily why (long sequence, multiple allele groups) those processes summarily lead to such predilections.</p>
<p>The brain being one of the few organs where it is accepted that &#8216;different&rsquo; does not necessarily mean worse, less or dysfunctionally abridged.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I can also see that this cliff-notes approach to a gene labelling system could blow up in our faces and all such efforts be quickly shut down if provocatively used to classify group limits.</p>
<p>This is particularly so given epigenetic modifiers which offer the potential of almost Lamarckian level improvements in functional system efficiencie like the HAR F1 which controls some critical brain development processes.</p>
<p>In this, you are what you are made to be by generations of selective adaptation but how aware you are of those influences vs. other area capability shortcomings may cause you to act in ways which deny full developmental fruition of the function.  All based on an erroneous interpretation of a genetic short hand descriptor which does not at all match the actual motives or operative psychology processes it is nominally associated with, leading these labels to be seen as &#8216;genetic stereotypes&rsquo; and thus seen to be discriminatory or even, ironically, &#8216;dysgenic&rsquo; for overemphasizing/reliance on specific genetic commonality factors for particuar decision making tasks.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really all the sophistication this system is capable of right now.</p>
<p>Making generic if cladistically sortable, statistically repetitive, associations within pop groups based on last-known variant mutation factors.</p>
<p>We have no real means to safely turn on dormant or unexpressed genes in humans nor to determine which of several other genes must activate themselves before or after to make it&rsquo;s hypothetical association proofable (specific protein folds at first, later, complex neurosynaptic morphologies) by scientific method.</p>
<p>We work on tissue samples from the dead and short sequence inserts on the vital stem tissues of aborted embryos.  Never knowing what the origami of folded proteins would come out to in full form.</p>
<p>Which is why we desperately need to go further, so that we can isolate and track markers with radio tags and then develop very long group &#8216;cyphers&rsquo;, as though working a cryptographic code breaking analogy.  The techniques of doing this will require investment in cloning technologies and specifically, exogenics for the purposes of bacterial carrier-insert modifying active embryos before monitoring development and if need be, terminating life, outside a vulnerable living womb.</p>
<p>Right now, this process is rendered illegal by several overlapping international treaties.  And so we are left with &#8216;indicators&rsquo; that, if the person is aware of them, may cause them to look into their own motivations and try to find a difference between aggressive advocacy and unrealistic proselytizing.</p>
<p>But which indeed does nothing to &#8216;cure&rsquo; them of the phenotypically expressed trait.  Nor does anything to make them even aware of the psychologies involved if those basic degrees of self awareness&rsquo; are not present at all.</p>
<p>As they are not in most L1/L2 and some L3 groups.  It&rsquo;s in the M and N (Western and East Asian) derivatives of the latter that most of these longer sequence traits are buried and it has something to do with a massive change in DNA that occured sometime around 50,000 years ago and whose effects continue through today, to distance us from our nominally shared racial subspecies.</p>
<p>For us, the need is for specific morphologic and biochemistry driven (metabolic efficiencies and total neurotransmitter density capacitance effects on thermal and electrochemical levels before dissonance transfer) studies to improve specific, functional, genetic pathway growth potential.</p>
<p>For the other groups, we need the upgrade to a base level of BIOS like operating functional capacity before the application of more specific behavioral awareness monitoring of specific trait associations can even begin.</p>
<p>Point blank, there are big differences and the kinds of outcomes we should be looking for will be different for each group.</p>

		<p>Well, I guess I&rsquo;ll comment since no-one else seems to be familiar with Myers-Briggs.</p>
<p>The Rejected One wrote:</p>
<p><i>according to the Myers-Briggs personality types, these people would be classified as &#8220;intuitive.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Not to add to your rejection, but this INTJ has to say that this is mistaken on two levels.  Firstly, the original article describes outgoing, &#8220;novelty seeking&#8221; traits as leading to a sort of anything-goes social liberalism.  While those traits fit no MBTI classification perfectly, certainly they would seem to strongly suggest Extroversion, Feeling and Perception (ExFP), not Intuition.  So in regards to the original article, your statement doesn&rsquo;t quite ring true.</p>
<p>Secondly, if you were speaking more broadly and it&rsquo;s your own assertion that Intuition = predisposition to Liberalism, while this idea is sometimes expressed in the less scholarly MBTI-inspired writings on the internet and elsewhere, it&rsquo;s not as simple as that.  As David Keirsey noted, Intuitives tend to make up the vanguards of both the Right and Left.  Consider for a moment only Intuitive Thinkers (NTs).  As you might expect, we Rationalists usually adhere to some flavor of Libertarianism, yet we are just as creative as Intuitive Feelers (NFs), and we are fully half of the Intuitive population.  No-one calls us loony (kooky, maybe).  And similarly among Idealist NFs, for every John Lennon there is a JRR Tolkien.  On some level you seem to know this, as your examples of Ayn Rand and Whitaker Chambers shows.</p>
<p>As to the idea of being &#8220;driven off&#8221; of conservatism by non-intuitives, I&rsquo;m afraid that alienation from any- and everything comes with the territory of being an Intuitive.  Conservatism does attract perhaps a higher percentage of those hard-heads who will gladly assist you with a much-needed Cranial-Colonic Separation, but the older you get you realize that&rsquo;s not a bad thing.  In particular a movement like Race Realism, based on re-establishing concrete reality rather than perpetuating ideology, is going to be a rough and tumble place.  We don&rsquo;t read this page daily for kid gloves.</p>
<p>Others in this thread have taken your meaning to be that you are a liberal, and even liberals should be welcome to Race Realism.  I don&rsquo;t believe that&rsquo;s quite what you were saying, but on that topic, yes it&rsquo;s true.  We have some unlikely allies, and people&rsquo;s beliefs tend not to be monolithic.  Jared Taylor himself often says that the liberal tendencies within Western Civilization are not bad things, but simply don&rsquo;t work when you add other races to the mix.</p>

		<p>I used to be somewhat liberal back in the day&hellip;then again, they take gifted kids and brainwash them.</p>
<p>I used to believe that man caused global warming.  Now I know it&rsquo;s a hoax.  It has nothing to do with conservative vs. liberal, but what&rsquo;s true and what&rsquo;s not.  I do, however, believe that we&rsquo;re to be stewards of the earth, which was given to us by God.</p>
<p>I do not like gay marriage not because I&rsquo;m a conservative, but because it&rsquo;s morally wrong.  Moreover, gays already have rights that are enumerated by the Constitution.</p>
<p>I also question how someone can be a race realist, yet support feminism.  I guess you could say I&rsquo;m a &#8220;gender realist&#8221; as well.  All this &#8220;universal equality&#8221; nonsense is just that  &mdash;  nonsense.</p>
<p>A lot of people in my family are fairly liberal&hellip;and I&rsquo;d easily be branded as ultra-conservative.  But with me, it&rsquo;s not about toeing the party line, but about what&rsquo;s right and what&rsquo;s wrong.</p>

		<p>I interpret the classifiers &#8220;naturally outgoing&#8221; and &#8220;with unconventional views&#8221; a doublespeak for those who exhibit rather loose attachment to individual property rights and their protection.</p>
<p>The finding mentioned in the article may explain why the &#8220;Liberals&#8221; are so staunchly opposed to any meaningful enforcement of the border and immigration laws, and why are they pushing vigorously immigrants of Mexican and other non-white ancestry up in American political structures. </p>
<p>The bulk of these immigrants demonstrated, time and again, their contempt for individual property (particularly, if it&rsquo;s American property), which must please the naturally-born &#8220;Liberals&#8221; who tend to subscribe to global and domestic redistributive agendas.<br>

		<p>There is a hidden message in the above article.</p>
<p>The decisive factor in determination of what the prevailing political orientation of the U.S. will be is not any debate or argument. It&rsquo;s who outbreeds whom.</p>
<p>So far, it seems, those with genetic inclination towards &#8220;Liberalism&#8221; multiply faster (often with an active help of &#8220;Liberal&#8221;-dominated tax-and-spend governments) than those without it. And if this trend continues, we all are going end up in a Soviet-style Malthusian trap, with nobody on Earth to liberate us from the &#8220;Liberal&#8221; regime.</p>
<p>Like it or not, this will be the ultimate destination of the Western civilization, unless we learn how to not help those with mentioned above genetic leaning proliferate their &#8220;Liberal&#8221; gene. And closing the border with Mexico, one of the main America&rsquo;s feeders with Marxists, socialists, and other kinds of &#8220;Liberals&#8221;, will help a lot in containment of that proliferation.<br>

		<p>I define &#8220;intitive&#8221; as the Myers-Briggs defines it.</p>
<p>It is the opposite of &#8220;sensory.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sensory&#8221; is the plumber who knows exactly where his pipe-wrench is; the Sunday-school teacher who can point to chapter and verse for every situation (and can tell you EXACTly what it means); the shrewd business-man who will not back his son&rsquo;s scheme for some new electronic device until he see the &#8220;proper&#8221; people vouch for it &hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;Intuitive&#8221; is the person who constantly seaches for his glasses, but who knows, even if he cannot put it into technical words, the difference between lemon yellow and cadmium yellow light (&#8220;this one has more green&#8221;), it is the person who (like George Gilder) drove his car to a speaking engagement, forgot he drove, and took a plane home; it is the scientist whose wife has to tell him the proper thing to wear to his presentation of some high-level theory.</p>
<p>You probably get the idea that &#8220;sensories&#8221; are more practical.</p>
<p>But &#8220;practical&#8221; can sometimes be the easy way out, and leads to problems down the road. I think that is where we are now, because in our society &#8220;practical&#8221; is usually defined as &#8220;that action which makes or saves money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Making or saving money is not always the right or even philosophically-sound thing to do. It encourages lack of principal. It encouraged our society to give in to the &#8220;civil-rights&#8221; pushers without even examining the issues involved. Just give in to prevent more riots. </p>
<p>Someone asked my beliefs  &mdash;  I believe in individual liberty. I think you can be in whatever state you want in your own backyard  &mdash;  as long as you have a fence up. Ditto for in your house. On a negative note, people have the freedom to do whatever negatives they want, even fail in school, have illegitimate children, etc. Don&rsquo;t look for me to bail them out. I think they are learning a valuable lesson. At least the intelligent people watching such foolishness are.  </p>
