<h1>That&rsquo;s Just Indian in My Family</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Zettler Clay, Clutch Magazine, October 4, 2010.</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} According to <cite>Africans and Native Americans: The Language of Race and the Evolution of Red-Black Peoples,</cite> by Jack Forbes, indigenous peoples of America shared quarters with African slaves, which led to inter-mating.</p>
<p>Before the U.S. gained independence from Great Britain, British colonies in the South requested that the Cherokees, Creeks, Seminoles, and other tribes, own slaves. These tribes took in many escaped slaves and remained tight-lipped when slave owners came calling.</p>
<p>South Carolina law in the 18th century stated that the &#8220;carrying of Negroes among the Indians has all along been thought detrimental, as in intimacy ought to be avoided.&#8221; Despite these threats and any associated stigmas, Native Americans formed bonds with not only escaped slaves, but free Africans.</p>
<p>Native American women married African men when the number of men in their own communities was decimated by war or natural disaster. Some Native Americans listed themselves as &#8220;Negro&#8221; or &#8220;mixed&#8221; in order to retain ownership of their land because of the land ownership laws created by European settlers.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a delicate connection between Native American and African ancestry. Yet, one would be hard-pressed to see any awareness being drummed up by American Blacks about the plight of the Native Americans. Is this an accepted fate or neglect?</p>
<p>Either way, &#8220;I got that Indian in my blood&#8221; is no longer a sufficient explanation of any variation in the physical appearance. {snip}</p>
<p>A cursory glance through world history annals reveals a habit of colonizers wiping out and displacing native cultures. American history is no exception, and the Trail of Tears has been chronicled as a sore spot in Andrew Jackson&rsquo;s tenure. Today, movies and television have depicted &#8220;Indians&#8221; as having certain facial features of high cheekbones and weathered skin, but in reality their features exist in many forms.</p>
<p>When the Census report came in 1790, some Native Americans refused to sign and register with the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Some refused to allow themselves to be &#8220;removed&#8221; to &#8220;Indian Territory&#8221; in Oklahoma during the 1800s. As a result, many of their descendants grew up in urban environments instead of on reservations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Remnants of Blackfoots, Choctaws, Lenapes, Matinecocks, Mohawks and Munsees are in our metropolitan areas under the classification of being African-American. {snip}</p>

<p>What a politically correct pile. In one sentence colonies &#8216;request&rsquo; Indian tribes own slaves, in the next, this shows they are bravely fighting slavery. Then to top it off, the fact Indians owned black slaves is supposed to bring them ideologically closer together.</p>
<p>I wonder if this same writer would scour the tome&rsquo;s to create such a rosy picture of white slave owners and slave owning societies? Or would he be fired for being &#8216;insensitive&rsquo;, for being anywhere close to being positive about whites owning black slaves?</p>
<p>If he&rsquo;s suggesting blacks &#8216;wiped out&rsquo; native indian populations he should just come out and say it. He has no problem saying whites have done so.   </p>

		<p>Makes sense, a great deal of Euro-Americans also have some native ancestry (I myself have a small amount of Creek) for many of the same reasons (lack of women in the frontier). However, Euro-Americans are pure European (genetically) compared to African Americans who often are only %60 African (the rest being a mixture of native and white).</p>

<p>Seminoles in particular took in escaped black slaves. NOW they have disowned the blacks as NOT being of their tribe. And the reality is - - they are not!</p>

		<p>Poster #1 hit the nail on the head.There is no one more racist than a full blooded Indian.When I was stationed at Huachuca I had an Apache girlfriend,obviously one of the more obstreperous and last vanquished tribes.Her words for other tribes that had surrendered earlier and god forbid intermixed with blacks were rough even for me.</p>

		<p>God bless that Apache girl! Let her be an example to all of us. As Europeans we do not have race purity built into our religion the way Jews, Muslims and Indians(feather) do, so it is a constant struggle for us to avoid extinctionist religions and ideologies. We just don&rsquo;t have their racial immune system.</p>

<p>What are you talking about? Are you one of those who love spreading the myth that most Euro-White Americans have &#8220;mixed blood&#8221;? Now just who would like us all to think like that? You have fallen for even more propaganda. I think you believe we all have Indian mixture in us? </p>
<p>I surely hope you don&rsquo;t think that European Whites that intermixed with OTHER European Whites, ( Germans, Norwegians, Swedes, Dutch, English,etc&gt;) are not PURE!  They are PURE White of the White RACE!</p>

		<p>My mothers family is white and indian mixed and the tribe is called the Lumbee Nation from North Carolina.  Her father was Mohawk form upstate NY but I never met any of them so I can&rsquo;t say how they feel.</p>
<p>Lumbee&rsquo;s are mostly people of white indian mixture who marry into other families of the same mixture for generations.</p>
<p>We have some family line&rsquo;s in the tribe who generations back intermixed with black&rsquo;s and they are not excepted for marriage by the rest of the tribe so they mostly marry other people of the same mix.</p>
<p>Lumbee&rsquo;s to this day are very racist towards black&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;t mind telling you so.</p>
<p>The ones with black blood are very bitter toward black&rsquo;s and to even mention that they have any black blood in them is enough to make them spit nails.</p>
<p>I have met many indians from all over and I never met one that liked blacks.</p>

		<p>   I&rsquo;m always surprised by the number of black people who claim American Indian ancestry. Of course, by their physical appearance alone, it is usually impossible to verify this black/Indian intermixture  &mdash;  black genes being dominant. Certainly, with the Seminoles and some other tribes this intermixture is an established fact. I imagine it is less so among the Cherokee, who have steadfastly refused to recognize the descendents of black Cherokee slaves as tribal members. It should also be recalled that many white mixed and full blooded American Indians of the Five Civilized Tribes joined the anti-government forces of the Confederacy and fought the blue-jackets during the War Between the States.  </p>

		<p>Can you imagine how mentally sick a nation has to be to rewrite history?  Neurosis is rampant and psychosis is its brother, and our leaders have been preaching their mental depredations for fifty years.</p>
<p>What a shame to waste such a wonderful nation on the unworthy.  In the name of a mental illness.</p>

<p>The last known Apache raid was against a hacienda in Mex in the 1930&rsquo;s. Some vaqueros fought it out and killed eight Apache. Among the belongings of the dead Apache were found freshly blooded scalps.</p>
<p>It might even well be that there are still Apache in the Sierra Madre still living in the traditional way. Biding their time until the final days of &#8220;the late great white man!!&#8221;</p>
