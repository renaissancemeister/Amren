			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>USA Today, October 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Federal officials and the Boston Public Schools have reached an agreement over allegations that the school district violated federal law by not providing English instruction to students with a limited grasp of the language, the U.S. Justice Department announced Friday.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Boston Public Schools agreed to assess the English proficiency of an estimated 7,000 students who were not previously tested in how well they understand, speak, read and write English. The district also agreed to provide the students with extra English language help during other classes including math, social studies and science.</p>
<p>In addition, the Boston Public Schools must monitor the academic performance of current and former English language learners and provide English language learner services at all schools.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a statement Friday, the Department of Justice&rsquo;s Civil Rights Division and the federal Department of Education&rsquo;s Office for Civil Rights said that since 2003, Boston Public Schools had failed to properly identify and adequately serve thousands of English language learners under federal law.</p>
<p>Officials said the settlement came after federal authorities examined the district&rsquo;s policies and visited schools.</p>
<p>&#8220;All students who are not proficient in English are entitled to language acquisition services to overcome language barriers that impede their equal and meaningful participation in educational programs,&#8221; said Thomas Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division.</p>

<p>If the feds want to impose expenses like this on states, they must call it a tax and include it in their federal budget.</p>

		<p>If anyone watched any of that Leftist non-white(mostly black)power rally in DC this past weekend they would conclude, according to these folks, EVERYTHING in America is their &#8220;right.&#8221; You name it, wealth, jobs, housing, food, healthcare, power&hellip;presumably anything from tv&rsquo;s to automobiles - all their &#8220;right&#8221; to have, just for being alive. </p>
<p>And clearly, it is the duty of us wicked whites to make sure they have all these &#8220;rights,&#8221; no questions asked. </p>

		<p>Perez is bad news. A one man affirmative action lobby with hundreds of government paid lawyers and computers at his disposal. Sort of like if Jesse Jackson (with an extra brain) had his own law firm. </p>
<p>Mr. Perez of course knows why so many students in Boston don&rsquo;t know English. Might have something to do with their citizenship or that of their parents. How many real citizens don&rsquo;t know English? But thanks to awful Plyer v Doe Supreme Court decision of 1982, which ranks right down there with Brown, Roe and Lawrence as the worst court decisions ever, we are stuck with these babbling brats, and have to pay for them to learn English. Which of course they won&rsquo;t do-at best speaking a bastardized version and understanding little or nothing in their expensive taxpayer- supplied English language books and computer programs or from the largely non-citizen teachers that will have to be hired.  </p>
<p>How far Boston, the Hub of our culture at one time has fallen. </p>
<p>Awful, isn&rsquo;t it, W.Bush,Romney,Cheney,Gingrich,McCain,Palin,Beck and Hannity? Whaddya gonna do &#8216;bout it?</p>

		<p>After having worked with recent latino immigrants for several years now, I have found that the majority never gain any semblance of fluency beyond the basic small-talk variety of English.  </p>
<p>I appreciate that learning another language is hard, but if you&rsquo;re going to move to another country, especially illegally, then you had better have some kind of plan in mind regarding how you will communicate, how you will get money without a Social Security number, how you will get along, etc.  Are people really that stupid to just rush over the border with little to no plan?  </p>
<p>People who immigrate here are NOT STARVING. I read an article that made that point.  There is plenty of food, etc in Mexico, West Africa, China, etc.  People just want the goodies (Ipod, TV, big car, fancier food, etc)  So they come here.  What happens when those things run out?  How loyal will the &#8216;new americans&rsquo; be then?</p>

		<p>In the 1950&rsquo;s, the Feds were starting to transfer funds to public schools (in order to close the missile gap). Conservatives predicted that this would result in federalized control of schools. These people were labelled as paranoid reactionaries. Regardless of their mental state or motives, they were absolutely right.</p>

		<p>Funny how non English speaking white people never got this right. I guess they must have been intelligent enough to realize moving here required speaking English and did it themselves for hundreds of years. </p>

		<p>America in a nutshell.  People who don&rsquo;t speak English have a &#8220;right&#8221; to impose an extra burden on the taxpayer.  Then, in comes the other half of this tag-team, the media, to inform us we&rsquo;re racist xenophobic bigots if we notice this extra burden, or *gasp* contemplate taking measures to keep these extra-burdensome people from immigrating in the first place.</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;Are people really that stupid to just rush over the border with little to no plan?&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And as civil insurrection escalates in Mexico, and guerrilla armies, fighting for independence, seek sources of revenue  &mdash;  such as kidnappings, drugs sales and extortion  &mdash;   to fight the corrupt government, expect more, millions more destitute &#8216;refugees&rsquo; to pour over the southern border, all demanding services.</p>
<p>Sixty languages are spoken in Mexico and very backwards, non-Spanish speaking &#8216;immigrants&rsquo; escaping the poverty, violence and oppression of Mexico, are showing up in the over-burdened schools, courts and penal systems of California.</p>
<p>California itself is destitute, suffering from a 19 billion dollar deficit, as two idiots battle to become the governor of a broke, ungovernable state  &mdash;  the obvious result of unfettered immigration from Third World Hell Holes.  Both candidates are actively pandering to hispanics, no mention made of stopping immigration, so the California economy will continue to deteriorate.</p>
<p>It seems the Boston Public Schools are experiencing what we Californians experienced 30 years ago, as program after program was implemented (and scrapped) in the schools to deal with the bi-lingual issue  &mdash;  English immersion, half Spanish, half English instruction, bi-lingual aides translating the teachers&rsquo; words, teachers recruited from mexico, bi-lingual differentials for teachers.  All of it wasting billions of scarce educational dollars as your Native White child&rsquo;s school suffered severe cutbacks and larger class sizes. </p>
<p>And also from Jay:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I have found that the majority never gain any semblance of fluency beyond the basic small-talk variety of English&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Jay  &mdash;  </p>
<p>They leave high school in California illiterate in both Spanish and English  &mdash;  not able to speak or write either one well, if at all  &mdash;  and this is after spending years and years in expensive, budget-busting bi-lingual programs.</p>
<p>I believe the entire bi-lingual program to be an industry, not to teach Spanish-speakers English, but to keep hispanic, bi-lingual teachers employed  &mdash;  I&rsquo;ve seen far too many kids pushed through English-language classes quickly, labeled &#8216;Proficient in English&rsquo; and thrown into  mainstream classes with 40 other students. This is one of the main reasons they drop out, difficulty with the English language.</p>
<p>Good Luck, Boston, you&rsquo;ll need it, now and in the future.</p>
<p>Bon </p>
