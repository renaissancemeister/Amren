			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), October 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A hard-working cafe owner has been ordered to tear down an extractor fan  &mdash;  because the smell of her frying bacon &#8216;offends&rsquo; Muslims.</p>
<p>Planning bosses acted against Beverley Akciecek, 49, after being told her next-door neighbour&rsquo;s Muslim friends had felt &#8216;physically sick&rsquo; due to the &#8216;foul odour&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Councillors at Stockport Council in Greater Manchester say the smell from the fan is &#8216;unacceptable on the grounds of residential amenity&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The fan has been in Beverley&rsquo;s Snack Shack takeaway in the Shaw Heath area of the town for the past three years.</p>
<p>Mrs Akciecek and her husband Cetin, 50,  &mdash;  himself a Turkish Muslim  &mdash;  work more than 50 hours a week buying, preparing and cooking hot and cold sandwiches and hot-pots for their customers.</p>
<p>Today mother-of-seven Mrs Akciecek said she plans to appeal against the decision.</p>
<p>She said: &#8216;I just think it&rsquo;s crazy. Cetin&rsquo;s friends actually visit the shop, they&rsquo;re regular visitors, they&rsquo;re Muslim people, they come in a couple of times a week.</p>
<p>&#8216;I have Muslim people come in for cheese toasties. Cetin cooks the food himself, he cooks the bacon.</p>
<p>&#8216;When we go to a cafe my husband wouldn&rsquo;t be offended by the smell of bacon. His friends are not offended by it, we have three visitors who come here for a sandwich, friends of my husband, and the smell doesn&rsquo;t offend them at all.</p>
<p>&#8216;My brother-in-law doesn&rsquo;t flinch if he comes and we&rsquo;ve just taken out three trays of bacon.</p>
<p>&#8216;I&rsquo;m going to find a local councillor. I&rsquo;m waiting for the letter so I can appeal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The couple took over the take-away in 2007 from the previous owner and replaced the existing extractor fan, which had been there for six years, with a new modern one.</p>
<p>They claim they received no complaints about the cafe which is open from 7.30am-2.30pm six days a week, until around 18 months ago when they received a letter from environmental services to say their neighbour Graham Webb-Lee had complained about the smell.</p>
<p>Mrs Akciecek said: &#8216;We&rsquo;ve never had a problem about the smell because everything is pre-cooked. We cook it in the oven so there&rsquo;s no foul smell.</p>
<p>&#8216;It&rsquo;s pre-cooked so the smell isn&rsquo;t as strong when we&rsquo;re frying it off. It&rsquo;s like living next to someone who&rsquo;s cooking a Sunday breakfast but it&rsquo;s not constant it&rsquo;s just in the morning.</p>
<p>&#8216;It&rsquo;s been a sandwich shop for about eight years, cooking exactly the same stuff. The lady before me did double because they were actually building new houses across the road so she was really busy. She was here from 6am-4pm because they were so busy.</p>
<p>&#8216;They were there before me but they were also there when the lady who owns the business was here and she was doing double what we are. She had five staff, you can imagine how bust that shop was and they never complained at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They say that the council&rsquo;s environmental services had been out to inspect their property after their neighbour complained about a foul odour last year, but they ruled that the smell was not causing a problem.</p>
<p>Mrs Akciecek said: &#8216;Environmental services said everything is ok. They kept coming back and guaging it and said there was no problem and because they didn&rsquo;t take any action (the neighbours) complained again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The couple had never applied for planning permission as they had simply replaced an existing extractor fan with one of the same size and in the same position, but, following further complaints from their neighbour, they were informed by the council they would have to apply retrospectively as an objection had been raised.</p>
<p>They applied for planning permission in May this year, but the application was refused at a meeting of Stockport Area Committee on October 14.</p>
<p>Mr Webb-Lee objected to the aplication  &mdash;  complaining that his Muslim friends refused to visit him becase they &#8216;can&rsquo;t stand the smell of bacon&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Mrs Akciecek, who also attended the meeting, said: &#8216;He said he had a daughter with an eating disorder, the Muslim friends, and the bad smell all the time is making his clothes smell.</p>
<p>&#8216;The councillors agreed with him without even asking me what I thought. It was as if they didn&rsquo;t even realise I was there.</p>
<p>&#8216;This cafe is our only source of income. There are only two of us working, we haven&rsquo;t got any staff anymore. We work seven hours in the shop and my husband goes to the cash and carry and has all the prep work to do. We&rsquo;re working long hours. He does about 50 hours a week easy and I&rsquo;m working about the same and we work Saturdays.</p>
<p>&#8216;The shop will be a lot harder work. It will be a good hour a day washing the walls down, I will not work anywhere with the grease falling down the walls. We can&rsquo;t move it anywhere.</p>
<p>&#8216;I&rsquo;m not going to accept it and we&rsquo;re going to fight it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Webb-Lee said: &#8216;The vent is 12 inches from my front door. Every morning the smell of bacon comes through and makes me physically sick.</p>
<p>&#8216;I have a lot of Muslim friends. They refuse to visit me anymore because they can&rsquo;t stand the smell of bacon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A spokesman for Stockport Council said: &#8216;The retrospective application was rejected on the grounds of residential amenity, as the committee felt the odours given off from the vent were unacceptable for neighbouring residents.</p>
<p>&#8216;We will ensure that the cafe complies with this decision and removes the extractor fan.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s read this article a bit more carefully.  I do not see a &#8220;muslim problem&#8221;  here.  This is about a White guy complaining to a White local government.  The &#8220;muslim friends&#8221; of the White guy are unidentified and didn&rsquo;t seem to bother complaining themselves.  The people getting screwed by the White government are a Turk and his English wife, two hard working small business owners.  I would also imagine a bacon cooking Turk married to an English woman is not a prime candidate for radical islam.  </p>
<p>Britain should not be overrun by foreigners.  It is so, not because of an invasion, but because of the policies of British marxists.</p>
<p>As usual, when you drill down enough, you find that it is the White marxist that is destroying the West; not the muslim, not the african, not the Asian.</p>

		<p>I wonder if Muslims know that it is a common practice to feed sheep and cattle a mixture that includes a large percentage of hog manure? I wonder if they know that many brands of gelatin desserts contain gelatin that came from hogs? </p>

		<p>The &#8220;Councillors at Stockport Council in Greater Manchester&#8221; should relocate Mr. Webb-Lee to a more pleasing residence-at their own personal cost, and henceforth be responsible for his rent in the new place for the rest of his life&hellip; They must of course make sure no business that might futher offend him may be opened anywhere near his new residence, or better yet, anywhere in the entire town&hellip; </p>

		<p>Wasn&rsquo;t there a story on here a while back about some white person complaining about a painting that had a pig in it at a local hospital? What&rsquo;s up with these racial marxists and their muckraking???</p>

		<p>I would be wary of visiting Britain nowadays.  Not because of the constant threat of &#8220;diverse peoples&#8221;, but simply because Britain has gone through the looking glass.  It&rsquo;s just too strange and foreign for me to feel comfortable there.  It&rsquo;s citizens are always under surveillance from police and remote cameras.  You can be arrested for having an &#8220;offensive&#8221; ringtone on your cellphone.  The police can brutalize you for offenses such as not wearing a seatbelt.  At one time I wanted to see the land of my ancestors but that time has passed.  </p>

		<p>1,50 Hours a week hard work running a food outlet, 7 Children, these people deserve some sort of a medal, not condemnation.</p>
<p>2,Under the English welfare laws this couple could probably claim enough in family benefits not to need to work. Again they should be commended on this issue.</p>
<p>3, 7 Children in overcrowded England (where I am from originally), that IS a worry. 7 Muslim children? That may also be a bit of a worry!</p>

		<p>Flamethrower: &#8220;&hellip;you find that it is the White marxist that is destroying the West; not the muslim, not the african, not the Asian.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the UK news yesterday: Muslims were sent down for killing a shopkeeper, for killing 2 old women, for shooting at two people in London with an automatic weapon in the middle of the street, for killing a little girl in an arson attack and another is facing a hefty jail sentence for murdering an old man in cold blood.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like White Marxists either but, believe me, immigrants are providing plenty of competition. The crime sections of our newspapers are full of brown faces - except, of course, where the publisher would rather you didn&rsquo;t know.</p>

		<p>I used to think these dietary rules forbidding pork in certain religions was silly but I read up that pigs store toxins in their fat that are passed to humans that eat their flesh.  The same with shellfish and other foods that are also mentioned in the Old Testament.  There is also the feeling of not being clean that I experience after eating something like a pork chop.  There&rsquo;s more wisdom to these rules than you might think.</p>

<p>This is how I see it:  Some people are so consumed by &#8220;white guilt&#8221; that they feel the need to go to bat for what they perceived to be &#8220;oppressed groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, that surely must offend you.  Let me help you.&#8221;</p>
<p>These types do not believe in leaving well enough alone.</p>
<p>We used to have a neighbor across the hall, sounded like he was from the Middle East or thereabouts, who cooked with garlic all the time, something my husband hates.  Hubby just complained to me about it&hellip;but we didn&rsquo;t say anything to the neighbor, just had the fan on in our apartment, no big deal&hellip;living in an apartment building, you learn to take the good and the bad, and learn how to deal with the bad.</p>

		<p>Reading between the lines, it seems like another case of gentrification forcing change on a commercial property. </p>
<p>If you look at the election results where I live, the urban downtown is going solidly liberal and getting whiter.  The white libs are flocking back to the areas they abandonned 40 years ago.</p>
<p>The small garage workshops and &#8216;mom and pops&rsquo; are beig zoned out of existence, to make way for yuppies.  These same white Marxist hipsters support more immigration, because they love how cheaply brown hands will do their laundry and make them tasty food and look after their spawn.</p>
<p>White Marxists are snobbish elitists, who don&rsquo;t want to rub shoulders with people doing hard work.</p>

		<p>Every &#8220;muslim&#8221; who makes a complaint like this one should be investigated. If they have been resident in the western country to which they have migrated for more than one year, and have not started to assimilate and acclimate in even these small details they should be immediately deported and never allowed back in. They have proven themselves to be disruptive and dangerous to the existing culture. It&rsquo;s time white people say &#8220;ENOUGH&#8221; to foreigners who want to enjoy OUR WHITE civilisation and culture and benefit from OUR way of life, without making any adaptations of their own. If they expect us to respect their culture, they should do the same in return. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s called A ZONING LAW, get some!  Only in the third world do snack shacks and street sellers attempt to cohabitate with domestic residences.  And they live in a shambles of pestilential overrun.</p>
<p>IMO, if you live above a restaurant, you&rsquo;re already nuts, especially if, for some dumb contractor-idiocy reason, they aren&rsquo;t venting the damn hood well above the roofline.</p>
<p>Try a little compromise: high volume electrostatic air cleaners for the kid and the friends plus a little remodel on the vent exit so it&rsquo;s not &#8216;12 inches from his front door&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Which would likely be a health code violation here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also bought prepackaged, precooked, bacon strips from our King Soopers which needed only a little microwaving.</p>
<p>Having worked in restaurants, I can tell you I was never so happy as the day I peeled off that apron (with tongs) for the last time and it still took me weeks and weeks to get the constant burning snot stench of grease out of my nose.  I replaced my clothes.  All of them.</p>
<p>Because I was about 24&#8221; from a deep fat frier.</p>
<p>The point being, yes, they say they cook it in the oven and don&rsquo;t smell it.  But I knew people where I worked that had been there for 17+ years and &#8216;thought nothing of it&rsquo; (fish and chips, not bacon).</p>
<p>I guess you can desensitize to anything but to this day, if I have to eat out, I don&rsquo;t go into a fast food place with a fry cooker, the smell makes me gag.</p>

<p>This is so true.  A lot of the above posters (anonymous 1, 2, 3, etc.) seem to be P.C. trollers.  Disregard them, &amp; you&rsquo;ll feel better.  Ahhhh!</p>
<p>Just like in the USA, the whining third-worlders in all civilized nations usually have enough bread to just get up &amp; go.  Back to their wonderful origins!  Where everything was invented, etc.  Real estate is super-cheap there, too.  They don&rsquo;t, because that would be horrific, &amp; they know it.</p>
