			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Toby Harnden, London Telegraph, October 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Obama presidency has not led to a post-racial America, says Toby Harnden, but black Republicans in Congress could help break down barriers</p>
<p>Campaigning a few miles from Fort Sumter, where the first shots of the Civil War were fired in 1861, Tim Scott described last week how he was born into poverty and a broken home, much like Barack Obama.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dad was gone by the time I was seven,&#8221; the black candidate for the House of Representatives told a mixed group of students at Fort Dorchester High School in North Charleston. &#8220;I was flunking out of high school. I failed geography, civics, Spanish and English. When you fail Spanish and English, you are not bilingual, you are bi-ignorant.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the conclusions that Scott, 45, drew were very different from those of Obama. When he was 15, a man who ran a Chick-fil-A fast-food restaurant taught him &#8220;that there was a way to think my way out of the worst conditions&#8221;. Scott went on to became a small businessman and a proud &#8220;conservative Republican&#8221;.</p>
<p>Barring a cataclysmic upset, Scott will be elected to Congress on November 2nd. There, he will be a ferocious opponent of Obama, to whom he gives a withering &#8220;failing grade&#8221; for his presidency.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obamacare&rsquo;s an atrocity around the necks of average Americans,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;His intentions might be good but he&rsquo;s leading us towards the brink of bankruptcy. Right now, the American people are simply saying they&rsquo;ve had enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott will be the first black Republican congressman from the Deep South in more than a century. Republicans hope to elect at least two other black candidates to Congress next month. Allen West, in Florida, and Ryan Frazier in Colorado, both with distinguished military records, are in very close races against Democrats.</p>
<p>There are currently 42 black members of Congress, all of them Democrats. Republicans haven&rsquo;t had a black congressman since J.C. Watts stood down in 2003. Ironically, opposition to the policies of the first black President on a whole range of economic and social issues are a key motivating factor for this new wave of black conservatives.</p>
<p>Rather than ushering in a post-racial era, Obama&rsquo;s election to the White House appears to have intensified racial divisions in America. This is not, as the Left asserts, because Right-wing opponents are full of white-hooded bigots who refuse to accept a black man as President. Obama&rsquo;s own strange myopia on race has played a big part.</p>
<p>Timothy Johnson, co-founder of the Frederick Douglass Foundation, a group that helps promote black Republican candidates, told me that that Obama was not scrutinised properly in the 2008 election because of his race.</p>
<p>&#8220;The election wasn&rsquo;t so much about what Obama brought to the table,&#8221; said. &#8220;People voted for him because they wanted to feel good about themselves, that they weren&rsquo;t racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Johnson even argued, Mr Obama had set back the cause of race relations by playing down the white side of his heritage. &#8220;His mother was white, his father was a person of colour but every time there&rsquo;s a racial issue he plays the race card just the same as everyone else.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a tough charge to make, but Johnson has a point. When a white policeman arrested a black Harvard professor last year, Obama didn&rsquo;t wait to hear the facts before accusing the cop of acting &#8220;stupidly&#8221;.</p>
<p>In a recent Rolling Stone interview, Obama gave a coded version of the standard liberal smear of the anti-tax Tea Party movement as being racist, referring its &#8220;darker&#8221; elements that &#8220;are troubled by what I represent as the president&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s little wonder that a recent Rasmussen survey found that just 36 percent of voters now believe relations between blacks and whites are getting better, compared to 62 percent in July last year.</p>
<p>Scott, an avowed Tea Party supporter, dismisses the accusation that the movement is racist, saying: &#8220;this whole race issue is a diversion away from the real basic platform of the Tea Party&#8221;.</p>
<p>For far too long, Republicans have ceded black votes to the Democrats and failed to recruit candidates like Scott to winnable congressional seats.</p>
<p>If Scott is the only black Republican on Capitol Hill in 2011, he will be all too easily marginalised and treated as a curiosity. That would be a shame because he has some interesting views on cutting the deficit and shrinking government.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve been black for a long time,&#8221; Scott says wearily whenever he is asked about race. He wants to be judged on his character and policies rather than the colour of his skin. At Fort Dorchester, encouragingly enough, not one pupil asked Scott about race or why a black man would be a Republican.</p>
<p>Obama made history by winning the White House. But it will take the likes of Scott to break down the racial barriers in America that the first black president has been content to leave in place.<br>

<p>&#8220;Tim Scott described last week how he was born into poverty and a broken home, much like Barack Obama.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Obama may have been born into &#8220;a broken home&#8221; (been a while since I heard THAT expression), but he was NOT born into poverty! People born into poverty don&rsquo;t get to travel to   &mdash;   and live in   &mdash;   exotic places like Hawaii and Indonesia. My fellow AmRenners, did YOUR parents take you to visit far-off destinations like like Hawaii and Indonesia when YOU were growing up? Could YOU afford to visit distant destinations in different time-zones even NOW? I couldn&rsquo;t. </p>
<p>This is standard MSM boilerplate on the issue: everybody who&rsquo;s black is assumed to have been poor growing up   &mdash;   even a mollycoddled, affirmative-action POTUS. </p>
<p>As for these anti-Obama black Republican hopefuls, well, I admire them for taking a principled stand against &#8220;one of their own&#8221;   &mdash;   and I&rsquo;m actually pretty impressed with Allen West   &mdash;   but I will NOT automatically regard the fact of their blackness as a &#8220;plus.&#8221; For me, it&rsquo;s still a bit of a minus. </p>

		<p>Tim Scott may or may not be a genuine conservative, but this piece reads as if written by a Jack Kemp/Steve Forbes brand of conservative:  The GOP, the Party of Lincoln, needs to &#8220;reach out&#8221; to blacks (never the other way around, of course) and pretend that blacks are simply &#8220;natural&#8221; conservatives.  I have yet to see any evidence that blacks are inherently on the Right and simply are looking for a home.  </p>

<p>&#8220;Could help break down barriers?&#8221;  Does he mean he can solve 70% of births out of wedlock, no father in the home in the vast majority of black families, eliminate black on white assaults which are nationwide and commonplace, stop anti-white hatred in the ENTIRE black community across the nation, plus a hundred other obstacles that are controlled solely by bad black attitudes and conduct?</p>
<p>Nonsense.  These candidates are blacks on a mission to change conservative goals in this country, and/or influence the Republican party some way, plain and simple.  They don&rsquo;t care one whit for white culture and white traditional values.  </p>
<p>I would say their attempts are pitifully stupid but they&rsquo;ll get an oddball white here and there who is so full of do-gooderism and as gullible and naive as they come to swallow their nonsense hook, line and sinker.</p>
<p>Blacks dumb down everything they&rsquo;re involved with.  We don&rsquo;t need them.  Those who do and are so full of happiness and glee at the gesture, please get out of here and join the Democrats and Moveon.org.  You&rsquo;re just too gullible to offer us any help with your efforts and presence.</p>

<p>True to a point, but I will assert that there can never be such a thing as a &ldquo;post-racial&rdquo; America either. Multiculturalism takes this concept (personified by General Secretary BO) and demands that the genocide of the white race via: miscegenation, taxation, and what passes for &ldquo;immigration,&rdquo; is a moral and justified socioeconomic outcome.</p>
<p>I see it for what it is, an early 21st Century &ldquo;rainbow&rdquo; genocide, that has become as fashionable as last years shoes in 1957 or a new Mustang in 2007. It is old wine in new bottles, in other words.</p>
<p>Need we know more than this:</p>

<p>Of course not, and of course also, God help us all!</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not just Tim Scott.  Look at who the Republican voters in South Carolina nominated for Governor.  That would be one Nimrata Randhawa (&#8220;Nikki Haley.&#8221;)  Like the NBC sitcom &#8220;Outsourced?&#8221;  That seems to be the future of politics in the Deep South.  She&rsquo;ll very likely be the second Indian-American Governor in the Deep South within a few months.</p>
<p>Though I have noticed that while she is leading in the polls, her percentages are constantly in the mid to upper 40s   &mdash;   I have not yet seen one poll that puts her above 50.  A Republican running in a Republican state in a Republican year ought to be doing a lot better than that.  It&rsquo;s perfectly obvious why she is not.</p>

<p>QD,</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
That would be one Nimrata Randhawa (&ldquo;Nikki Haley.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>A Republican running in a Republican state in a Republican year ought to be doing a lot better than that. It&rsquo;s perfectly obvious why she is not.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>The Republican Party will destroy itself using Republican doctrine:</p>
<p>&#8220;Give us power and we will share it&rsquo;s _ideal_ with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>This having been effectively pounded into every white man&rsquo;s conscience from the first time he had to &#8216;share and share alike&rsquo; with his brat brother or whiney sister.  &#8220;You&rsquo;re the eldest, set the example&hellip;&#8221;, wink-wink, (And you will be empowered by what you patriarchally give away as they come to feel gratitude for your kindness&hellip;).</p>
<p>The problem here is that there is an assumption by non-whites that what works among our own should work for them as well because they are &#8216;just as deserving&rsquo;.  When in fact, it was -never- about &#8216;deserving&rsquo; something, it was ALWAYS about power sharing to conserve power.</p>
<p>For whites born to this concept of quiet group socialism, there is still a consciousness that there are limits to how much you will give away beyond them.  Because the notion that altruism which goes out to our group only applies as it is -wanted- back.  If a white male is not empowered with submission and dependence by those whom he shares his resources, he has a hard-stop moment of reality check whereby the &#8216;ideal&rsquo; of yielding power for nothing literally has no positive social rewards.</p>
<p>And as long as there is still that instinctive, genetic, limiter to what we can lying-eyes see to be an exogroup whose genetics we DON&rsquo;T want to reward, it will be the Democrat who wins by playing the patriarch with, not it&rsquo;s own, but other people&rsquo;s money and privileges.</p>
<p>And as long as someone else is promising those who formerly made up our powerbase a whole world of faceless alternate dependence on nanny statism, we gain nothing by giving away our little chunk of it.  We can literally not compete with body-social politics.</p>
<p>The best we can manage is retaliatory non-participation in destroying the Republican Party itself for betraying us.</p>
<p>The more I look at life, the more I come to realize that it is not just one race but one gender group within that race that has to be held to a specific set of conformist standards as an ingrained understanding of social responsibility.  All others, never having been more than the beneficiaries of guarded or indifferent patriarchal benevolence, have absolutely no sense of the &#8216;higher cause&rsquo; group identity or cohesive loyalty that goes with.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of self-helping white males who are among that traitorous &#8216;politician gene&rsquo; group.</p>
