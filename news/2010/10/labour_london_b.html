<h1><a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/andrewgilligan/100060304/labour-london-borough-becomes-islamic-republic/">Labour: London Borough Becomes &#8216;Islamic Republic&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Gilligan, London Telegraph, October 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Outside the Wellington Way polling station in Tower Hamlets yesterday, as at many other polling stations in the borough, people had to run a gauntlet of Lutfur Rahman supporters to reach the ballot box. As one Bengali woman voter went past them, we heard one of the Rahman army scolding her for her &#8220;immodest dress.&#8221;</p>
<p>That incident is perhaps a tiny taste of the future for Britain&rsquo;s poorest borough now it has elected Mr Rahman as its first executive mayor, with almost total power over its £1 billion budget. At the count last night, one very senior figure in the Tower Hamlets Labour Party said: &#8220;It really is Britain&rsquo;s Islamic republic now.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the last eight months  &mdash;  without complaint or challenge from Mr Rahman  &mdash;  this blog and newspaper have laid out his close links with a group of powerful local businessmen and with a Muslim supremacist body, the Islamic Forum of Europe (IFE)  &mdash;  which believes, in its own words, in transforming the &#8220;very infrastructure of society, its institutions, its culture, its political order and its creed .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. from ignorance to Islam.&#8221; Mr Rahman has refused to deny these claims.</p>
<p>We have told how the borough&rsquo;s change from a conventional council leader to a mayoral system came about as a result of a campaign led and financed by these two groups  &mdash;  and how the IFE, in its words, wanted to &#8220;get one of our brothers&#8221; into the position.</p>
<p>We have described in detail, again without complaint or challenge by Mr Rahman, his deeply problematic two years as council leader until he was removed from that post six months ago, partly as a result of our investigations. After he secured the leadership with the help of the IFE, millions of pounds were channelled to front organisations of the IFE, a man with close links to the IFE was appointed as assistant chief executive of the council despite being unqualified for the position and the secular, white chief executive was forced out. Various efforts were made to &#8220;Islamicise&#8221; the borough. Extremist literature was stocked in Tower Hamlets&rsquo; public libraries.</p>
<p>We have described, once more without complaint or challenge from Mr Rahman, how he signed up entire families of sham &#8220;paper&#8221; Labour members to win the party&rsquo;s mayoral nomination  &mdash;  acts which caused him to be sacked as the Labour candidate by the party&rsquo;s National Executive Committee.</p>
<p>Now, however, Mr Rahman has won as an independent  &mdash;  getting more than double the number of votes of the Labour candidate imposed in his place, Helal Abbas. As mayor, he will have far more power than he had as a council leader. And unlike a council leader, no-one can sack him, except the voters in four years&rsquo; time.</p>
<p>We should be clear what this result was, and was not. It was a decisive victory. But it was not much of an endorsement by the borough&rsquo;s people. Turnout, at 25.6%, was astonishingly low, with most voters (particularly the white majority, and they still are a majority) unaware of, indifferent to or turned off by the process. Lutfur&rsquo;s 23,000-odd votes are only about 13 per cent of Tower Hamlets&rsquo; electorate.</p>
<p>It was not a victory for any sort of democracy. It was the execution of a careful and sophisticated plan by a small, well-financed and highly-organised cabal to seize control of a London borough. It deployed not just volunteers from the IFE and other bodies but also people paid to campaign by Lutfur&rsquo;s business backers. Someone also paid for tens, perhaps hundreds of thousands of copies of the most pernicious literature ever seen in a British election, in which Mr Abbas was falsely smeared as a wife-beater, a bankrupt, a racist and and an insulter of Islam.</p>
<p>Yet even this would probably not have worked without a series of astonishing unforced errors by the Labour Party. Something else this was not, or not really, was Lutfur&rsquo;s win; it was Labour&rsquo;s own goal. For the last nine years, there have been deep concerns about IFE and other infiltration, and membership fraud generally, in Tower Hamlets (the Bethnal Green and Bow constituency Labour party more than doubled in size between 2006 and 2008, at a time when Labour membership nationally was sharply falling. Many of the new members have the same names as people we can link to the IFE.)</p>
<p>As a result, Tower Hamlets Labour members are not allowed to select their councillor candidates: it is done centrally, by the London regional office. Yet this safeguard was torn up for the far more important mayoral selection, despite the warnings on this blog and elsewhere that Lutfur&rsquo;s vote bank would see him selected, as he indeed was.</p>
<p>Having then bravely crossed the Rubicon of sacking Lutfur as their candidate, Labour failed to follow through. Its campaign was slow out of the stocks, allowing him to present himself as a victim, with all the emotional advantage that brought. Above all, Labour seemed afraid clearly to explain why he had been sacked.</p>
<p>I knew the election was lost for Abbas when I saw him on the BBC last week, three times refusing to say why Lutfur had been ditched. The reporter, quite understandably, along with a lot of the Bengali and white electorate, ended up concluding that it was little more than a personality clash between the two men. Most Bengali voters didn&rsquo;t back Lutfur because they support the IFE  &mdash;  they don&rsquo;t  &mdash;  but because they believed he had been unfairly treated.</p>
<p>If Labour had spelt out to people the reasons why Lutfur&rsquo;s sacking was entirely justified; told voters that this election was actually about the continued health of democracy and secularism in Tower Hamlets; and said that it was about the interests of the whole diverse borough versus the interests of Lutfur&rsquo;s puppetmasters, it might have galvanised enough of those elusive white and Bengali secularist voters to outweigh Lutfur&rsquo;s block. It wouldn&rsquo;t have needed many  &mdash;  a few thousand would have done it.</p>
<p>Again and again, Labour people asked me why this story was not playing bigger in the media. I said it was simple: they weren&rsquo;t giving the media anything to play with. I am confident in writing what I have done about Lutfur because I&rsquo;ve been working on this story for more than a year. Most journalists, however, aren&rsquo;t allowed the time to do in-depth research; they have to go with what people are prepared to say in front of their TV cameras or at their press conferences. But though senior figures in Tower Hamlets Labour were happy to speak on background, virtually none would ever go on the record.</p>
<p>The saving grace of last night is as follows. Now that Labour is in opposition on Tower Hamlets, it has at least been given the chance to oppose. The one gain for the party is that it can dissociate itself from, and campaign against, the slow-motion car-crash which Lutfur&rsquo;s mayoralty is likely to become. Lutfur may well be the Derek Hatton of the 2010s, but unlike Hatton he is no longer Labour&rsquo;s responsibility. Any thought of making up with Lutfur needs to be resisted  &mdash;  there&rsquo;s only pain, not gain, there.</p>
<p>Finally, something else which Tower Hamlets is not. Some of my commenters are fond of saying that the borough is an example of &#8220;Third World&#8221; politics in the UK. There are indeed similarities  &mdash;  but actually the claim is an insult to the Third World. Bangladesh has got to grips with Islamism; the IFE&rsquo;s Bangladeshi parent, Jamaat-e-Islami, gets about two per cent of the vote in elections there. No Islamist sympathiser in Bangladesh has unfettered control over a £1 billion budget. Bangladesh, in short, has less of a problem with Islamic radicals than Tower Hamlets.</p>

		<p>Okay, now I&rsquo;m convinced.  We mustn&rsquo;t fight the minority invasion of our countries simply because they are different or strange, or less intelligent than us, but because they will work ceaselessly for the total and complete annihilation of Western society.  Of course most non-whites aren&rsquo;t really bad people, but many - Moslems in particular - have clear and frightening motives.  I used to think that sort of thing was partly just exaggerated conspiracy theory, but this clearly shows the intentions of Moslem immigrants.  Wake up Britain, wake up Europe, wake up world.  It is not to late to save our great civilization.  Let&rsquo;s not be defeatists who whine about the imminent destruction of Western society, instead let&rsquo;s do something about it.  Be an activist, donate money to parties like the BNP and Front National (France), and if you live in an area with good, nationalist politicians, get out and vote for them.  Good things are happening, the articles on this website are evidence that a change in thinking is beginning to take place in the West, and its only a matter of time before white people, and all those intelligent and good &#8220;Uncle Tom&#8221; minorities who are on our side, realize what is happening and take an active part in stopping it.  It is only a question of when - and when will it be too late?</p>

 This shows how the dream of the liberals and some universalist Conservatives (neo-conservatives, Evangelical Christians etc&hellip;) is not turning to reality. They had claimed that when any non-White would come to Europe or the West in general, he or she would on the drop of a hat turn into an European or a Westerner. But in reality when non-Whites come to White nations except a minority, most actually tend to become more anti-Western/ anti-modern or anti-European. In Bangladesh, the fundamentalist Islamic parties have been banned by the Bangladeshi Supreme court but in London the Islamic fundamentalists flourish. Blood is after all thicker than water. </p>

		<p>All great empires destroy themselves first from within.  The Brits already started this process by getting themselves involved in World War 1 and then dismantling their empire and navy to be on &#8216;equal footing&rsquo; with the world.   Then they felt bad for the third world places they brought civilization to, so they then allowed them into their homeland.  The rest is history&hellip;and disappointing history, too.</p>

		<p>How can any Labour politician feign outrage at the result of this rigged election.The very reason that Tower Hamlets,and hundreds of other districts have the capacity now to implement such an effront to western civilisation is entirely due to their genocidal immigration policy,and their active encouragement of Muslim culture.Treason doesn&rsquo;t even come close to describing it.</p>

		<p>This should be very effective propaganda news for our side. </p>
<p>Nationalists all over Europe have made great successes making radical Islam THE ENEMY and making the direct connection between Non European immigration and radical Islamic takeovers of European neighborhoods, cities. So far, we haven&rsquo;t had the break-through victories in English speaking White countries (it&rsquo;s the problem of the &#8220;Winners&#8221; of World War II always being against RACISM).</p>
<p>Please, in your activism here in the USA or in the UK - strive to be effective, present a scary enemy - ugly, hateful, murderous, women abusing, animal abusing and if it fits the situation - gay abusing Islamic extremists.</p>
<p>Please resist the honest, fair, reasonable Libertarian, Constitutionalists who always insist on presenting some statistic that Islamic extremists are only a very small % of immigrants and everyone should focus on some Austrian economics theorists or some hard currency monetary theory.</p>
<p>The masses of regular Whites in the USA, UK respond to EMOTION, not REASON - they need a clearly defined &#8220;ENEMY&#8221; one that religious right Christians, secular Whites, women, even White gays can recognize as dangerous, hostile, BAD GUYS.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr Abbas was falsely smeared as a wife-beater, a bankrupt, a racist and and an insulter of Islam.&#8221;</p>
<p><br/>
I would have thought that being a wife-beater would be a &#8220;plus&#8221; to Islamic voters. Far from an accusation to hurl at your opponent, shouldn&rsquo;t wife-beating be something a Muslim candidate would brag about on their own campaign literature? If the Koran INSTRUCTS men to beat their women when they misbehave   &mdash;   and it unequivocally does   &mdash;   then voters in Muslim area should regard a candidate with wife-beating on their resume as merely proof of being a good Muslim, no?</p>

		<p>Follow the money.</p>
<p>Nobody does nothin&rsquo; for free.</p>
<p>What I want to know is where this cash will be directed to, next.</p>
<p>Obviously there will be &#8216;campaign debts&rsquo; to pay off (thousands of pamphplets printer bills etc.)</p>
<p>But beyond that, there should be some serious expansionism on the part of the political backers and some &#8216;pet projects&rsquo; directed funding on the part of the industrialist/bankers.</p>
<p>We got Capone _not_ for being &#8216;Enemy #1&rsquo; but on taxes.</p>
<p>Demonize someone as blatantly counter cultural if not outright &#8216;evil&rsquo; and you end up looking for blatantly demonic excuses in their public behavior to justify your rage.</p>
<p>THIS is the inherent flaw of appealing to &#8216;emotion&rsquo; as a driver for conservatism over reasoned certainty of deeds.  And as you can see from the article, now that they have protected status as a hated minority as well as for-real political power, the Islamic power structure cares not a whit what you do to challenge their problematic political activities.</p>
<p>They aren&rsquo;t stupid people.  Don&rsquo;t you be.</p>

<p>Very true. When Pakistanis,Turks, Bangladeshis, Mexicans, Africans or a whole other host of third worlders come into the West the goal is quite simple. To use the the host system to create a &#8220;successful&#8221; Pakistan, Turkey, Bangladesh, Mexico and Africa right here. Assimilation never even comes into the equation. Why bother? The host countries are so afraid of being called bad names they allow it. It is much easier to take advantage of the wealth and rule of law (that took years of blood, sweat and tears to create) in the West then try and change your own Hell hole of country. Dont you just love cultural enrichment?</p>
