			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Digger, Diggers Realm, October 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Derrick Donchak and Brandon Piekarsky were convicted of what is being called a federal &#8220;hate crime&#8221; yesterday in Scranton, PA in the beating death of illegal alien Luis Ramirez. They face life imprisonment and are expected to be sentenced in January 2011. The first thing you should know about this federal case though is that the conviction wasn&rsquo;t on a &#8220;hate crime&#8221; statute, but a statute of the federal Fair Housing Act. Yes, you did read that right. I&rsquo;ll explain that in a bit.</p>
<p>The witch hunt by the federal government against Piekarsky and Donchak began when they were found not guilty for causing the death of Luis Ramirez in Shenandoah, PA in July 2008. Both were convicted of simple assault in May 2009 and sentenced to at least 6 months in June 2009.</p>
<p>I covered the Shenandoah trial extensively day by day. I found the evidence and testimony at trial in 2009 to be consistent with their convictions and sentencing. You can read the day by day trial coverage, which included a charge of ethnic intimidation  &mdash;  the state version of &#8220;hate crime&#8221;  &mdash;  at some of the links below.</p>
<p>I will not rehash the whole trial here, but I will state that if I believed that these two were guilty of murder I would be the first to point that out, but as you review the trial in the above links I believe you too will come to the same conclusion that I did.</p>
<p><b>The first trial  &mdash;  Why Donchak and Piekarsky were found not guilty</b></p>
<p>Here is a basic rundown of the events that occurred and why the teens weren&rsquo;t convicted of murder.</p>
<p>Six teens who got some booze after a town carnival type event were wandering around town. They came upon 25-year-old illegal alien Luis Ramirez in a park late at night, around 11:30PM, alone with a severely underage girl (13) who just happens to be the younger sister of Crystal Dillman. Dillman, who claims that Ramirez was her fiance and has two children with him and a third from a previous relationship, later received an undisclosed sum from People Magazine for a three page article and $25,000 from a victim&rsquo;s advocate fund. Testimony by Ramirez&rsquo;s friends say that he was drinking prior to going to the park. At the recent federal trial the 13-year-old girl was called Ramirez&rsquo;s &#8220;girlfriend&#8221; in court.</p>
<p>The teens approached him asking them what they were doing there. A fight ensued and slurs were thrown from both sides as it progressed. One teen, Brian Scully, who took a plea deal in the case says he punched Ramirez and knocked him to the ground and said that he was the one yelling &#8220;go back to Mexico&#8221;. Scully says he heard no racial slurs from Piekarsky. Another teen, Colin Walsh, who took a plea agreement and is facing 9 years, with hopes to have his sentenced reduced to 4 for cooperating, claims that he also punched Ramirez. The teens then started to leave. During the fight Ramirez got up and had time to make phone calls to multiple people. He could have walked away. The teens walked away at this point. Scully testified that Ramirez then charged them from behind punched him in the head. A second fight ensued.</p>
<p>Walsh testified &#8220;Walsh: I took Ramirez down with a solid &#8216;uppercut hook&rsquo; and saw him hit his head&#8221;. Ramirez hit his head on a curb. Scully claims he tried to kick the unmoving Ramirez in the head but missed then claimed Piekarsky kicked him in the head. Walsh says he doesn&rsquo;t remember Scully trying to kick Ramirez, but claims Piekarsky did, but he made many contradictory statements in his testimony such as shoe colors etc. and stated &#8220;Walsh: me, Piekarsky, Donchak and Scully kicked the fallen Ramirez.&#8221; at one point. No physical evidence was ever introduced. No shoes with blood etc. And as noted all of them had been drinking which brings all of their detailed testimony into question.</p>
<p>The charges of murder arose because Ramirez died two days later due to head trauma. However, at trial Dr. Daniel Brown, a neuropathologist who had examined Ramirez&rsquo;s body on Aug. 1, 2008, testified:</p>
<p>&#8220;I observed a blood clot between his brain and a protective covering, and blood in an area usually containing spinal fluid. The left side of his brain had extensive contusions and swelling. Because of motion of the brain, an injury to the back of the brain caused an injury to the front. No evidence of trauma to the right side of his brain.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Injuries consistent with a moving head hitting a stationary object.</b></p>
<p>Note the pathologist says the cause of death was a moving head hitting a stationary object, not a moving object hitting a stationary head. Thus the only physical evidence in the case points away from a kick causing his death.</p>
<p>With all of the testimony, lack of evidence and the testimony of teens who were drunk at the time, it was not a shock to see the two acquitted of murder. Also due to the low threshold of racial slurs, it was also not a shock that they were acquitted of state ethnic intimidation charges. I would just like to point out that if this had been a racially motivated attack, there would have been no lull in the fighting, no time for Ramirez to make multiple cell phone calls and no second attack. The teens would have jumped on Ramirez and beat him to death from the start. Yet they did no such thing. After the initial fight they went to leave and Ramirez attacked them.</p>
<p>The verdicts, evidence and testimony were not good enough for some though.</p>
<p><b>Illegal Alien Support groups demand a witch hunt  &mdash;  and get it!</b></p>
<p>As soon as the verdicts and sentencing came down illegal alien support groups in the country which had been rallying in Shenandoah prior to the trial  &mdash;  including MALDEF, La Raza and LULAC  &mdash;  vented their rage and put out their tentacles to their contacts within the federal and state government. They declared that it was a sham trial because it was an all-white jury. One of those tentacles reached Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell who contacted the Federal Department of Justice urging them to prosecute the two. And just a little over 6 months after their sentencing the feds indeed did so. In December 2009 the federal government indicted Donchak and Piekarsky on federal &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; charges and the witch hunt was on.</p>
<p>As you now know, Piekarsky and Donchak were convicted of those charges yesterday. There is also unsurprisingly no outrage from illegal alien support groups that the jury was all-white for this trial  &mdash;  as that was simply a straw man argument from the start since Shenandoah is a mostly white area. What you would be shocked to hear though is on what charges they were convicted of. As the papers blare that they were indicted of a &#8220;hate crime&#8221;, the true charge has nothing to do with hate, it has to do with preventing illegal alien Luis Ramirez from living where he wants to.</p>
<p>Yes, this charge is under the Federal Fair Housing Act. Here is straight from the Department of Justice&rsquo;s proud press release on the kangaroo conviction of the two  &mdash;  from their civil rights division.<blockquote>The jury found the defendants guilty of violating the criminal component of the federal Fair Housing Act, which makes it a crime to use a person&rsquo;s race, national origin or ethnicity as a basis to interfere, with violence or threats of violence, with a person&rsquo;s right to live where he chooses to live.</p>
</blockquote><b>There are no Civil Rights for illegal aliens</b>
<p>First, I would just like to point out that recently many have been confusing civil rights with human rights and this is just such a case. Civil rights are those bestowed on a citizen by their country. Immigrants, both legal and illegal, have no civil rights in this country. That is one of the cherished benefits of becoming a citizen. This has been obfuscated by these race pandering groups and attorneys looking for cases and persecutions. They try to confuse you into believing that our system works on human rights and it does no such thing. The UN works on the human rights system. The United States works on a defined civil rights system as outlined in our constitution. A violation of Luis Ramirez&rsquo;s claimed &#8220;human rights&#8221; has no place in our courtroom. And as he was not a citizen of this country he has no civil rights, so the civil rights division of the Department of Justice is outside of their jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Second, after reviewing the original case above which was a charge of murder and &#8220;ethnic intimidation&#8221;, why is the federal government using some housing clause to prosecute two young men. Piekarsky was only 17 at the time and Donchak was just over 18. How were they depriving Luis Ramirez of where he lived because he got in a fight with them in a park late one night?</p>
<p>Obviously this is the only charge that they could make stick against these two and it should outrage every American that the federal government would go to such length to convict a citizen on unrelated charges just to bow to the whims of the illegal alien lobby. These groups are using the justice system to prosecute people they do not like by trying to make you believe that crimes are segmented between murders that were nice murders and murders that were hateful murders. But going beyond this, no murder even occurred in July 2008, it was an accidental death due to a fight. Yet, these two face life in prison.</p>
<p><b>Double Jeopardy  &mdash;  Piekarsky and Donchak were tried twice on the same charges</b></p>
<p>Another item that should should be brought to the reader&rsquo;s attention in this case is the violation of Piekarsky&rsquo;s and Donchak&rsquo;s constitutional rights. As I pointed out in an earlier article on this case, under the fifth amendment of the US Constitution it states quite clearly &#8220;[no person shall] be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb&#8221;. As the two have already faced &#8220;ethnic intimidation&#8221; charges under the state of Pennsylvania, they should not be allowed to be tried once again for the same incident and the same charges after being acquitted.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice seems to have tip-toed around the fifth amendment by charging them with some Fair Housing Act clause, but as anyone can tell by the headlines in all of the papers, this charge had nothing to do with violating Ramirez&rsquo;s right to live in a house in Shenandoah and everything to do being charged with a &#8220;hate crime&#8221;. As they tout quite clearly it is because they were white and he was Mexican and that is why they were charged and convicted. This is all word play to violate their civil rights under the constitution.</p>
<p>The fifth amendment was put in place just for such a situation. So that the local, state and federal governments could not charge someone over and over with the same crime in order to eventually get a conviction. It prevented retribution, harassment and corruption. Quite clearly though the illegal alien lobby has managed to get the federal government to take retribution for them and any citizen should take heed at the power of these groups. They are more powerful than you might have imagined and have friends that will back up their goals and efforts even at the federal level to send a message to those opposed to illegal immigration that if you even look at an illegal alien wrong you better watch your back.</p>
<p><b>Denial of bail why? Are Piekarsky and Donchak a threat?</b></p>
<p>Piekarsky and Donchak were denied bail and now sit in a federal prison while they await sentencing. This is just one more injustice placed upon them. It is the federal government, with no prior evidence or reason, claiming that these two are such a risk of violating another persons federal Fair Housing Rights that they should be locked up until sentencing. With all that can be found in this one incident, I don&rsquo;t believe I could find one logical or reasoning person who reviews the Donchak/Piekarsky case who would believe that their previous convictions and actions as law abiding citizens would come to the conclusion that they would do such thing again.</p>
<p>Attorneys for Donchak and Piekarsky say they will appeal the conviction. I applaud them for that, but with the current corruption and obvious vendetta-style actions taken by the Department of Justice on behalf of supporters of illegal aliens I seriously doubt they will get a fair appeal trial.</p>
<p><b>They have an agenda that threatens your rights</b></p>
<p>The case of Donchak and Piekarsky is not only a travesty of justice it is a direct warning that our rights are not ours and that they can be violated at will by those in power. You may read other news reports on this case. Many will not delve into the actual case as I have done. None will address the injustices that this case brings forward in regards to violating individual citizen&rsquo;s rights. They will not address how this same type of tactic of Double Jeopardy may one day be used against you because corrupt individuals in this country have an agenda that you are getting in the way of.</p>
<p>There is a concerted agenda in the case of illegal alien Luis Ramirez. It was a tailor -made situation for those calling for an amnesty for illegal aliens  &mdash;  but only if they could get a conviction of Piekarsky and Donchak. It didn&rsquo;t take the Pro-Hispanic racist groups long to exploit the situation. In December 2008 they included Luis Ramirez in a filing with the Organization of American States (OAS). The OAS is a group that is trying to claim some jurisdiction over the sovereignty of the United States. They used Luis Ramirez in a filing entitled &#8220;Latinos Not Protected In US&#8221;, as an example of the hate against Latinos in the United States. The ruling in the Piekarsky/Donchak case threatened their claims  &mdash;  and they were none too happy. They had to get a conviction of the two or their agenda could not move forward.</p>
<p>Those in support of illegal aliens will celebrate and simply publicly state that these white boys got what they deserved because obviously they were hardcore racists. They will claim &#8220;justice&#8221; has been done. Those words coming from their lips are quite simply disgusting. They want their agenda of open borders and unmitigated illegal immigration to continue and those who get in their way should be made an example of. They have no idea of the word justice. They have no idea of the rights of our constitution. They have no respect for the rule of law. And the &#8220;Justice&#8221; Department has followed them down that hole.<br>

		<p>Unbelieveable. But since when have blacks, hispanics, socialists, etc, ever followed laws created by white men? Most non whites commit violent crimes against others all the time, hence showing no respect for others freedoms or right to life. Most blacks and hispanics are thugs.  Plain and simple.  I would disown anyone in my family dating or marrying one.  If one broke into my house while I was there with loved ones, you can charge me with a hate crime if you want, but they&rsquo;re dead.  Period.</p>

		<p>I have been following this case since it first broke and was hoping that the jury would not be intimidated into finding these two white youth guilty on trumped up charges. Unfortunately I was wrong. </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s clear is that as long as European-Americans remain a mostly deracinated group who don&rsquo;t react as other minorities do to gross injustice done to one of their own, then the legal system will continue to run rampant over our rights. Let&rsquo;s hope that somehow the lawyers for the Defense can find a way of overturning this verdict but I think this simply shows again that the saying, &#8220;the squeaky wheel gets the most oil,&#8221; applies in almost all situations, including this one. If there had been hundreds of white demonstrators outside the courtroom, with poltical leaders taking an &#8220;Al Sharpton approach&#8221;, then you can be sure that this travesty of justice would not have resulted.</p>

		<p>What a tragedy that a man is dead, and that his death by a fall has turned into a call for a witch hunt against the younger men who were defending themselves from this man, who died as a result of his drunken attack on them after they were walking away from him. What kind of 25 year old man has a thirten year old girlfriend? The younger men were asking if the child was all right, eeeing as she was out so late with an adult man, and that man went berserk. The effing creep; those young kids are in for a terible time now, because that guy was in our country in the first place.  </p>

Who should we call? </p>
<p>	Should we organize a group like PETA to write letters, and make the call necessary to pressure the bureaucrats to stop persecuting the whites? <br>

		<p>&ldquo;Testimony by Ramirez&rsquo;s friends say that he was drinking prior to going to the park. At the recent federal trial the 13-year-old girl was called Ramirez&rsquo;s &lsquo;girlfriend&rsquo; in court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From a racially realistic and political standpoint, this is all we really need to know, the girl was underage and likely white, given her last name of Dillman. Therefore, these young white youths are heroes and not criminals in my book, even if the stomped the 25 year old Mexican pedophile&rsquo;s head into salsa!</p>
<p>Enough is enough: MALDEF, La Raza and LULAC, are all terrorist and criminal alien organizations and should be dealt with accordingly. As for the Communist swine, State of Pennsylvania  Commissar-Governor Ed Rendell and his associated Federal Department of Justice fellow-race traitor-travelers, they should all have their hate crimes trials, but a noose is what the only outcome for them should be!</p>
<p>May God let it be so!!!</p>

		<p>Disgusting and we Whites will never utter a word. We all know this will only escalate until only Whites will be framed for any type of &#8220;hate crime&#8221;. </p>
<p>This is what those who framed this bill wanted in the first place. To go after Whites, period. They will never charge a black or a brown with even a blatant hate crime against Whites. We have already seen that in the last few decades, haven&rsquo;t we? </p>

		<p>They join a long line of young whites who have been given harsh sentences for crimes black youth would skip away from like the Halloween beatings in CA a few years back. Or can anyone here help me find a link to the case of 2 white kids in the NE who got 20-40 years in a Fed pen for just yelling at couples in a park one night? A third kid was also convicted who wasnt even there because he supposedly talked to them about it. It was posted here on AMREN but I havent found it in the archives. It was a blatant showing of &#8220;one law for them another law for us&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Well, when I read in paper about these convictions, I was just incredulous. But was not aware the charges were under the &#8220;Fair Housing Act&#8221;. That makes this so called trial even more of a travesty. An abomination really.</p>
<p>These two guys must not have had good representation. The facts of the case are not even clearly pointed out by digger as reported originally anyhow.</p>
<p>Luis at the time of the incident was a second time illegal, which mnade him automatically a felon.</p>
<p>This Crystal the fiance was underage when she was having sex with Luis by her own admission.</p>
<p>This girl in the park at the time of the incident WAS THE UNDERAGE SISTER OF CRYSTAL, BY HER OWN TESTIMONY ON THE WITNESS STAND ALSO HAVING SEX WITH LUIS!</p>
<p>Luis was a serial child molester. A paedophile and in the habit of being a paedophile. Liked young American teen girls.</p>
<p>Luis picked the fight with the American boys. Luis took off his shirt, handed his watch to his girl friend in a very premeditated manner and TWICE when at them. Luis was AN ADULT AND THEY WERE MINORS [some of them].</p>
<p>Luis had called his &#8220;crew on the phone for back up. One of the crew showed up after the fact with a hand gun, which he attempted to hide. Whether the crew are illegals too is never stated. Probably they are too.</p>
<p>LUIS WANTED TO FIGHT AND KILL. LUIS WAS ONE MACHO DUDE!</p>
<p>Luis died from the injury to the head by his falling. NOT from a beating or kicks. Those white kids were leaving the area and he attacked them TWICE, they were just defending themselves.</p>
<p>Any &#8220;slurs&#8221; said would have been said in the &#8220;heat of battle&#8221;. For slurs to be a provocation would have to been said beforehand.</p>
<p>I just cannot believe this conviction. The jury heard none of this? The lawyers for those boys were incompetent?</p>
<p>And you can bet these two are going to be marked targets in prison from the fiends that you find there.</p>
<p>And double jeopardy? Forget it, the courts have ruled this is all legal.</p>
<p>But a violation of the &#8220;Fair Housing Act&#8221;?</p>
<p>You just cannot say enough bad about all this!!</p>

		<p>The fifth amendment prohibition of double jeopardy is routinely violated in federal civil rights cases.  As many will recall, in the Rodney King beating case the original jury, which saw the complete video, including the part where Rodney King lunged at the cops, found the policemen not guilty of using excessive force.  Then the feds came in and tried the cops all over again, this time claiming that Rodney King&rsquo;s &#8220;civil rights&#8221; were violated.  Given that it had been legally determined that excessive force was not used it is difficult to say just what civil rights were being violated.  Of course in actuality the cops were just tried again on the same accusations of excessive force.<br>

		<p>The only whites can take this country back is by voting in the correct politicans; appointing the correct judges.  But it is going in the reverse direction instead.  This country is lost once the minorities become the majorities.  Characters like Harry Reid will sell this county out for votes.  This country is already a shell of itself already.  </p>

		<p>I just cannot understand why whites remain so stupid; what we are doing as a race is placing a long knife underneath our necks and gently sawing back and forth with it - it takes longer that way.  Since we are called bigots and racists anyway, maybe it is time to proudly accept those titles (remember sticks and stones may break our bones, but words will never harm us), unite with other patroitic whites, and get the job done on a large national scale.  The first step must be to get rid of our liberal politicians.</p>
<p>Never mind if other peoples feelings get hurt along the way, accept the fact that not everyone is equal and that whites (and orientals) are superior in almost every way, and build a new society around these two races with high educational and self discipline requirements. Other groups can join if they are will- ing to pay the price   If we don&rsquo;t take action soon, imagine the legacy we will be leaving for our grandchildren who will be living in poverty.</p>

If you&rsquo;re found not guilty, that&rsquo;s it in my book. And so, here we are. According to the Feds and the courts, the protection against double jeopardy means you can&rsquo;t be tried in THE SAME COURT for the same offense. What a farce!</p>

<p>A most unfortunate turn of events for these young men. Their trial (and sentencing) seems to have gone about as badly as it could under the circumstances. Perhaps we should not be surprised by this: it ALWAYS seems to go badly for white &#8220;hatecrime&#8221; defendants in US courts these days, doesn&rsquo;t it? </p>
<p>But then, I don&rsquo;t much care for the whole &#8220;hatecrimes&#8221; concept: the punishment for taking a life should be the same regardless of what might have been going on in the killers&rsquo; heads; or what they might have said during the crime. The defendents&rsquo; views on immigration are as irrelevant to the death as their views on cheeseburgers or Seinfeld vs. The Simpsons. <br>
 <br>
Adding seriousness to the charges   &mdash;   and substantial time to the sentences   &mdash;   because of insensitive WORDS being uttered is while the act was taking place is, to my mind, legally nonsensical. It should never be permitted in our justice system. It&rsquo;s affirmative-action jurisprudence and it&rsquo;s wrong. <br>

		<p>I have tried to research the testimony and have found that the underage girl was 15 and her name is &#8220;Roxanne Rector&#8221;. Can anyone verify this? This seems to me to be a key piece of evidence that has been censored by the MSM. The young men began by saying &#8220;Isn&rsquo;t it your bedtime?&#8221; or something to that effect. There is apparently an acknowledged sexual relationship between Rector and Ramirez that had probably been ongoing since she was 14. Rector is also Dillman&rsquo;s half sister. At 15, in Pennsylvania, Rector was not able to legally give consent. That makes Ramirez a rapist and a child predator. These young men instigated the situation in her defense according to the testimony. Why aren&rsquo;t we trumpeting this information in the comments section of every news story available?</p>

		<p>Yes, the only answer is to assert White Nationalism. We whites must politically unify, and start thinking of ourselves as a viciously persecuted minority - which we soon will be. Tell that to any honorable Tea Party types. We certainly need fiscal responsibility. But even more we need an end to the non-white IMMIGRATION INVASION. By allowing ourselves to be artificially turned into minorities in our own homelands, we Whites are putting ourselves at imminent risk of property confiscation (already happening), assaults and molestation, enslavement and murder.</p>

		<p>These white men will be in constant danger in prison. Whites can&rsquo;t even serve time now without danger of being executed by blacks and Hispanics convicts. Whites are raped by blacks and Hispanics in prison constantly. Whites must all band together in this country. When persecutions of whites happen like this we must all ban together, march and demonstrate, and demand that the outlaw US government cease these persecutions. The US Constitution is no longer in effect in this country as it pertains to whites. Black robed lawyers rule at their discretion. So called &#8220;civil rights&#8221; laws are used to persecute whites. Where are the civil rights of these two white men? As this so called trial demonstrates whites are losing their rights and if we don&rsquo;t all stand together sooner or later they will be coming for us. Either we hang together or we will surely hang separately. <br>

		<p>This case clearly illustrates why a large number of states are moving to nullify federal law.  And the importance of identifying such a state, with the correct mix of race, and enlightened state laws, and move there.</p>
<p>You need to understand something.  Because of Obama, and because of cases like this, respect for federal law is at the lowest it has been since the founding of the nation.  There is a coming backlash that has the potential to fracture the US into several smaller countries (you better live on the correct side of any new borders that spring up BEFORE that happens).  More likely, at least in the short term, is there will be large differences in law between the states.  Saying harsh words to a person of the wrong race will get you decades of prison time, in one state (while hate crimes against whites are routinely dropped) while, in other states, gunning down an aggressive non-white will be routinely dismissed as self-defense&hellip;.if they are allowed to be in that area to begin with.</p>
<p>The balkanization of the US has begun.  And that is what this case is really about.  The message to whites is, you better not break into ethnic enclaves and use violence to enforce their borders.  Yet, more and more, that is exactly what state and local governments want to do.  The feds can go after individuals, for now (soon they will be too weak to even do that)&hellip;.but they can&rsquo;t go after states.</p>

<p>William, the point of the article is that the act of murder was not proven in the first trial, it was tried again, and that the Feds abused a HOUSING LAW to send teenagers to prison for life.  <br>
Even if they caused the Mexican man&rsquo;s death, it is not premeditated murder, it is manslaughter or some other form of homicide. They did not go to the park with the purpose of hunting and killing a certain kind of person.   </p>
<p>I work in a bar/club, and I have to get into confrontations with people all of the time.  It is very very easy to start using derogatory language to intimidate and anger your opponent, especially when they are using it against you.  I try not to do that, just to protect myself. God forbid, if you say some ethic or sexual slur during a fight and severely injure the person, one could get a hate crime added to the charge.  Insanity.</p>

		<p>It sounds to me like they were only being Good Samaritans in assaulting him.  Since Mr. Ramirez was 25, and apparently was in a relationship with a 13-year-old girl, he is (well, he was&hellip;) a child molester, and he was the ONLY person at fault in this incident.  They found him in a parking lot with a girl who is barely even a teenager, and did the right thing in attackting him.  And yet, thanks to the likes of La Raza, these heroes are being treated as criminals.  And the point the author made about Mr. Ramirez having no civil rights is absolutely correct.  Non-citizens do not, by definition, have ANY civil rights at all, nor should they.  Human rights, sure.  But not civil.  Oh, and that thing about the double jeopardy - didn&rsquo;t O.J. Simpson get away scotch-free, despite new evidence, because of the whole &#8220;you can&rsquo;t be tried twice for the same conviction&#8221; thing?  I&rsquo;ve herad of other cases (can&rsquo;t remember any off the top of my head) where new evidence was found for a person, and still the courts could do nothing about it, because of the &#8220;double jeopardy&#8221; section in the Constitution.  A silly clause I think, but, if its being used to let black murderers like Simpson get away with things, it certainly shouldn;t be disregarded to convict two good boys who aren&rsquo;t guilty of anything.</p>
<p>To poster number six (6) - as number 26 said, we should push the Council of Conservative Citizens to do something about this.  I found out about them recently, and I must say I am very impressed.  They are kind of like the political wing of American Renaissance, and are very effective in the South, even today.  As for the John Birch Society, I don;t know much about them but I&rsquo;m sure their good too.  But, really, this is the sort of thing that would have nearly all conservatives, and even many liberals, serially pissed-off.  In fact I&rsquo;m somewhat surprised Fox News (esp. O&rsquo;Reilly) hasen&rsquo;t reported on this already.</p>

		<p>The lesson to be learned here is: Be silent while defending yourself in an attack. If you need to use deadly force, use silent deadly force.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sorry La Raza and other unAmerican traitors are gleeful about the outcome of this case. Ramirez is a pig. He should have been convicted of assault and statutory rape prior to this entire episode. He wasn&rsquo;t. The use of underage Hispanic girls as sex toys for older men is common. What a culture.</p>
<p>But these white kids are not heroes or victims. They asked for it. Somethng else bothers me: the fact that several white kids couldn&rsquo;t intimidate an unarmed young adult to either stand down or run away without an assault including head injury? This is not a political case for whites. Waste no time or money on these losers. They are expendable.  There are more worthy causes than these mess created by immature whites albeit exploited by Marxist Mexican nationalists.</p>

		<p>Among the strongest and clearest laws in our Nation are the laws against double-jeopardy   &mdash;   the idea that a person cannot be tried twice for the same crime.  Throughout our land, this is a basic right, similar to freedom of speech, freedom of religion, etc., except whenever the government wants to ignore it. </p>
<p>If the government doesn&rsquo;t like the outcome of a trial, they simply re-try the defendant.  They will keep doing this until they get the verdict they want.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve always admired the constitution of the USA. I had only a low opinion of the American law system, both in theory and in practice, but I thought its flaws and errors were due to human incompetence and an occasional corrupt judge here or there. But the present case shows that, in a large section of the American law system, the suppression of freedom and justice is the basic intention.<br>
I looked up &#8220;double jeopardy&#8221; and &#8220;ne bis in idem&#8221; in both the English and the German version of wikipedia. I was astonished to see that the exceptions from the interdiction of double jeopardy are most numerous in English and American law, but that double jeopardy is completely impossible in French and German law. These restrictions of one of the most basic principles of justice in England and the US date back only some 20 or 30 years. That tells a lot.<br>
