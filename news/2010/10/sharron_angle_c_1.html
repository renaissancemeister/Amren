		<p>Joy Behar isn&rsquo;t giving this ad very positive reviews.  Then again, someone needs to find Joy Behar a home.</p>
<p>As for sensible people, Sharron Angle shoved the dagger in Harry Reid&rsquo;s back when she said that he has actually lived at the D.C. Ritz-Carlton for many years and has somehow gotten rich even though he has spent almost all of his adult life doing government jobs.  This ad twists the dagger.</p>
<p>BTW, I have never believed that Reid and Angle were tied or close in the polls.  I have always thought she has had a sizable lead.  Rush&rsquo;s theory is that Reid was said to be dead if Sue Lowden or Danny Tarkanian won that Republican Primary instead of Angle, ergo the media must be fudging around with the polls to disspirit the Tea Party Movement.  I agree with Rush&rsquo;s theory but for a different reason   &mdash;   Reid&rsquo;s son is running for Governor of Nevada, but is way down, far further back than his father &#8220;supposedly&#8221; is.  So how can one Reid be so close and the other be so far behind?  Are there really a big percentage of Nevadans that would vote for Harry but not for Rory?  Harry and Rory will have about the same percentage take, and both will lose by healthy margins.</p>

		<p>Anything that upsets Joy Behar gives me insane pleasure.</p>
<p>Booting Reid out, albeit way too many years late, would upset Obama&rsquo;s little applecart, and be a great start to dismantling his obscenely corrupt and dangerous regime.</p>

		<p>Some of the leftist pundits are already smearing on the rhetorical greasepaint to keep as much egg as possible from sticking.  They&rsquo;re already conceding that Angle is going to win, so my guess is they have insider info they&rsquo;re not fully sharing.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d say Ms. Angle has a bigger problem than any ad she puts out can overcome:</p>
<p> SEIU represents the voting machine technicians in Clark County (Las Vegas), Nevada. Earlier today, that there was a voting glitch in Clark County, Nevada. The glitch caused Harry Reid&rsquo;s name to be automatically checked on the ballot before voters had indicated who were they were supporting.</p>
<p><i>According to Joyce Ferrara who was an eyewitness to this strange ballot ordeal, the problem was widespread, &#8216;One person that&rsquo;s a fluke. Two, that&rsquo;s strange. But several within a five minute period of time  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s wrong.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p><i>It is particularly troubling that Clark County has put the uber left-wing SEIU Local 1107 in charge of their voting machines.</i></p>
<p><i>The agreement between the SEIU and Clark County specifically puts all voting machines under the control of the SEIU. See the collective bargaining agreement.</i></p>
<p>After all, is not voter fraud is an Amerikan Tradition?</p>
<p>Nice try Sharon.  Welcome to The Machine.</p>

		<p>I didn&rsquo;t know about this ad until someone showed me Joy Behar&rsquo;s reaction (something like &#8220;bring that bitch down to the South Bronx&#8221;), which was childish, petulant, and, of course, hypocritical.  Like most rich lefties, Behar stays as far away from the dark parts of NYC as possible.  I bet she wouldn&rsquo;t go to the South Bronx IN THE DAYTIME without a security  contingent.  What a phony.</p>

<p>One other &#8220;taboo&#8221; that Angle is breaching, which I&rsquo;m glad of:  In one of her debates with Reid, she openly denounced Reagan for &#8216;86 IRCA.  I was expecting all of conservative talk radio to come down on her for doing #1 all over the sacraments of the Sacred Church of Dutcholyatry.  That might have ruined her more than anything.  Luckily, no.</p>
