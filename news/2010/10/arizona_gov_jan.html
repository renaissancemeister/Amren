<h1><a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1010/43199.html">Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer Slams &#8216;Foreign Interference&rsquo; in Immigration Lawsuit</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Scott Wong, Politico, October 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In a new twist in the fight over Arizona&rsquo;s immigration law, Republican Gov. Jan Brewer on Tuesday asked a federal court to disallow foreign governments from joining the U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit to overturn the law.</p>
<p>The move comes in response to a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling issued Monday, allowing nearly a dozen Latin American countries  &mdash;  Mexico, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Peru and Chile  &mdash;  to submit friend-of-the-court briefs in Justice&rsquo;s challenge to SB 1070, which Brewer signed into law in April and is considered one of the nation&rsquo;s toughest immigration-enforcement measures.</p>
<p> &#8220;As do many citizens, I find it incredibly offensive that these foreign governments are using our court system to meddle in a domestic legal dispute and to oppose the rule of law,&#8221; the Republican governor said in a statement shortly after the state&rsquo;s motion was filed Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&rsquo;s even more offensive is that this effort has been supported by the U.S. Department of Justice. American sovereignty begins in the U.S. Constitution and at the border,&#8221; she added. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Brewer&rsquo;s motion should resonate among conservative legal scholars worried about giving foreign legal systems a voice in American jurisprudence. These concerns are a reaction to a school of legal thought arguing that American judges should look to foreign laws and courts for assistance in interpreting the U.S. Constitution, particularly in regard to basic human rights issues. Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy is arguably the leading spokesperson for this approach, as noted in a 2005 New Yorker profile.</p>
<p>The state of Arizona&rsquo;s motion could also strike a chord with those on the right who are convinced that President Barack Obama (and Bill Clinton before him) want to make U.S. laws subordinate to international courts, particularly the International Criminal Court in The Hague. Under Clinton, the United States signed a treaty to join the court weeks before leaving office in January 2001, though the Senate never ratified his action. Months later, President George W. Bush pulled the United States out of the treaty, saying he worried foreign governments would try to prosecute U.S. troops for alleged war crimes.<br>

		<p>Brewer is gaining support as a Presidential candidate for 2012, and if the only thing she accomplished was to resolve our immigration debacle, she would be a herion of the nation for decades to come.  Otherwise, I don&rsquo;t see any GOP candidate that is anywhere close to inspiring, or who will commit to any firm statement regarding immigration.</p>

It says a great deal about the illegal immigrants coming to our country that their own leaders don&rsquo;t appear to recognize them as a valuable asset to their counties.</p>

		<p>This comes on the day that the UN presented a report that was very pro-open borders and stated that any form of discrimination against &ldquo;international migrants in irregular situations&rdquo; (illegal aliens) is an attack on human rights and a violation of their &ldquo;birth rights&rdquo;. The UN is also planning to present a plan to the US on how to &ldquo;deal&rdquo; with Arizona. Our nation can choose to follow it or not, but it is unlikely, given the actions of the current administration, that they would not embrace it. </p>
<p>We are a sovereign nation, it was wrong for President Obama to ever have the state of Arizona presented to a group of foreign nations, not only because he betrayed his own countrymen, but because he used it as a tool rather than dealing with this business himself. The more they attack Arizona and Governor Jan Brewer, the more they make the state and the Governor, martyrs.  The UN needs to mind its own business, and if it doesn&rsquo;t, we the people should evict them from NYC and strip the diplomats of immunity to our laws. <br>

		<p>I too find it incredibly offensive. Foreign countries have no business meddling in our internal affairs.  Latin American countries strictly control their borders and tolerate no illegal migration and allow little legal immigration. Those hypocrites need to butt out of our business and fix their own countries.</p>

		<p>Mexico NEEDS to interfere in U. S. immigration policy   &mdash;  - by any means the U. S. federal goverment makes available to them.    </p>
<p>Mexico has many quasi-monopolies in vital services. These keep prices high, make the nation uncompetitive and maintain a parasitic class of multi-millionaires and billionaires.</p>
<p>Mexico has 11 billionaires, in fact, including the world&rsquo;s richest man, Carlos Slim, worth an estimated $60 billion.</p>
<p>Professor George W. Grayson, senior associate, Center for Strategic and International Studies, elaborated on Lou Dobbs Tonight (May 3, 2007): </p>
<p>&#8220;Lou, Mexico&rsquo;s elites live like maharajas. But they spend extremely little on education and health care and transportation to upgrade the quality of their citizens. They pay about  &mdash;  as a percent of gross domestic product  &mdash;  the same percentage that Haiti pays, 10.4 percent. So as a result, even though it&rsquo;s an immensely wealthy country  &mdash;  gold, silver, beaches, oil &hellip; they prefer to neglect their problems at home, turn a blind eye to them, and let U.S. taxpayers pick up the tab.&#8221; </p>
<p>The U.S., you see, is the maharajas&rsquo; safety value. <br>

		<p>Foreign influence in the internal affairs of the United States flows directly from contemporary immigration.</p>
<p>One of the overlooked consequences of the 1965 Immigration Act (and the mass immigration that followed it)is the destabilizing effect on the body politic of acquiring a critical mass of foreign nationals with foreign allegiances.</p>
<p>The House of Representitives voted 326 to 69 in favour of the 1965 Hart-Celler Act, and the Senate passed it by a vote of 76 to 18. </p>
<p>This only proves how ignorant and short-sighted a majority of our elected representitives were back then, and the undeniable need today for more sober minded, historically grounded and racially aware leaders.  </p>

		<p>Another fine example were an esteemed citizen of this country is going to be chastised for supporting said land they represent. It is our nature to protect our own kind. Apparently now that has become a criminal act in the eyes of a misguided fool who only has interest in supporting his &#8220;peoples&rsquo;&#8221; own agenda.<br>
This country used to stand for opportunity. A place that the wayfaring dissidents of the world could come, bust their butts and create a life for themselves. Now, it has been reduced to a popularity contest. &#8220;Who is the most &#8220;oppressed&#8221;? Who has suffered because of the things that happened to their ancestors? Let us not forget the Crusades. Let&rsquo;s remember who Captained the slave ships. Foremost, lets keep in mind that being a Gentile pretty much denotes that you are the last in line. </p>

		<p>The immigration/open borders situation is about ushering global governance.  The other problem is&hellip;.. Since the U.S. is so good about meddling in other countries&rsquo; affairs, can we legitimately complain when it&rsquo;s done to us?<br>

		<p>I agree with Gov. Brewer-it is incredibly offensive that they would even consider letting these countries file briefs. And the fact that they ruled in their favor, and the U.S. Dept. of Justice supports them? Treasonous behavior on the part of our government. How sad, you could see this coming a mile away.</p>
<p>I would absolutely support her in charging our government with treason. I hope she does.</p>

<p>Grounds for secession, 100%.  Who will support AZ?  Will my state?  Will yours?  I think the more widespread this insanity gets, hopefully, more people will support AZ, and coomon sense!  I GUARANTEE the leftist marxists severly underestimate how many patriots there are in this country.  If push ever comes to shove, they will be in for a VERY rude awakening!</p>

<p>The U.N. is a two-headed serpent.  One side is the anti-white racists who wish to loot the white First World and bring it down to equality with Third World misery.</p>
<p>The other more powerful side is the globalizationist elites. They are building a new world order where private elites can own property but nations cannot.</p>
