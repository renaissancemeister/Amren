<h1><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE69P0X620101026">U.S. Slips to Historic Low in Global Corruption Index</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dave Graham, Reuters, October 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The United States has dropped out of the &#8220;top 20&#8221; in a global league table of least corrupt nations, tarnished by financial scandals and the influence of money in politics, Transparency International said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Somalia was judged the most corrupt country, followed by Myanmar and Afghanistan at joint second-worst and then by Iraq, in the Berlin-based watchdog TI&rsquo;s annual corruption perceptions index (CPI).</p>
<p>The United States fell to 22nd from 19th last year, with its CPI score dropping to 7.1 from 7.5 in the 178-nation index, which is based on independent surveys on corruption.</p>
<p>This was the lowest score awarded to the United States in the index&rsquo;s 15-year history and also the first time it had fallen out of the top 20.</p>
<p>In the Americas, this put the United States behind Canada in sixth place, Barbados at 17th and Chile in 21st place.</p>
<p>Jointly heading the index  &mdash;  in which a score of 10 indicates a country with the highest standards, and 0 as highly corrupt  &mdash;  were Denmark, New Zealand and Singapore with 9.3. They were also at the top of the table last year.</p>
<p>Somalia scored 1.1. The watchdog group said its table was based on &#8220;different assessments and business opinion surveys carried out by independent and reputable institutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>U.S. &#8220;INTEGRITY DEFICIT&#8221;</p>
<p>Nancy Boswell, president of TI in the United States, said lending practices in the subprime crisis, the disclosure of Bernard Madoff&rsquo;s Ponzi scheme and rows over political funding had all rattled public faith about prevailing ethics in America.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re not talking about corruption in the sense of breaking the law,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We&rsquo;re talking about a sense that the system is corrupted by these practices. There&rsquo;s an integrity deficit.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Why should we expect better?  After Brown v. Board in 54 and Eisenhower&rsquo;s nationalizing the Arkansas Guard in 57, this country has had no integrity.  You can&rsquo;t have a first world civilization when our leaders are busy handing it over to the third world among us.  The loss of integrity is equal to the loss of protection for White Humanity.</p>

<p>I think a better explanation is the browning of America.  Almost every one of these studies ranking countries on some desirability factors ranks Scandinavian countries at the top, African countries at the bottom, and previously white but darkening countries like the US and UK slowly slipping in the ratings with every passing year.</p>
<p>Interesting they claim Madoff as a factor, because Madoff money funded a lot of the left wing, the SPLC included.</p>

		<p>The corruption can probably traced mostly to Congressional Dems (as in many of the Black Caucus members) and in the Obama administration</p>

The fact that the Scandinavian countries have the most fully developed Social Democratic economies means that there is less of a plutocracy to corrupt the democratic process. <br>
 <br>
I agree that it is unwise of these countries to encourage third world immigration.  Ron Krugman wrote, &#8220;if you&rsquo;re going to assure health care and a decent income to everyone, you can&rsquo;t make that offer global.&#8221;<br>

		<p>John Engelman I pulled up the link you posted. The comments were a bit shocking! Most of those folks were calling for completely OPEN borders and unlimited immigration! I never read so many comments so very far to the left before and it is scary.</p>

		<p>Is this such a surprise?As America becomes more Africanized/Mestizoed (all in the name of some mythical ivory-tower &#8220;equality&#8221;)and the mainsrtream European ethics/mores(for all of its imperfections &implementation; by imperfect people) based on a JudeoChristian socio/legal base rule of law is eroded and third world values/mores take root then such corruption/lawlessness(like Africa) will be more apparent and eventually dominate.See it in Detroit and large urban centers-rampant decay,crime and basically savage tribal behaviour will escalate yet according to the entertainment moguls and MSM-it&rsquo;s all cool and it&rsquo;s YOUR fault!</p>

		<p>Somalia should be honored that they are even considered a country instead of disputed jihadi warzone.</p>
<p>Our system is pretty insane allowing people and corporations to donate cold hard cash as &#8220;campaign donations&#8221; or whatever always seemed to be indistinuishable fro bribery to me.</p>

<p>Maybe YOU would, but don&rsquo;t say what the rest of us would do.</p>
<p> As for living a comfortable life, I find that impossible simply because of the nonwhites in our schools, our neighborhoods, our cities, our workplace, and our stores. Don&rsquo;t forget all the crimes committed by nonwhites. It far outweighs any crime that a few Whites commit. </p>
<p> Many of us are barely getting by and I don&rsquo;t consider my Social Security check giving me a comfortable life.</p>

<p>No amount of money or material items could ever get me to sell my sisters, even if god came down and told me to, I would give him a big ugly no. There is more to life than material things.</p>

<p>Yes, most of us are not living in huts, but many of us are not living in condominiums sipping drinks and speaking of the new global society.<br>

<p>Very nasty. I think you belong on the other colors&rsquo; websites. Or perhaps you&rsquo;re one of the easily corrupted examples the story is about.</p>
<p>The score will continue dropping for American. We can see it falling in our every day lives; the decline of decency, respect, honor. And the admiration of those traits is gone - they mean nothing to generations behind mine. What upsets me more than goodness disappearing is society&rsquo;s current ambivalence to it being gone. Very few people even notice or recognize what used to be bad behavior - they consider it just normal.</p>
<p>Oh, good people are still there, but in ever decreasing numbers. It&rsquo;s to the point that a &#8216;good news story&rsquo; about someone doing something positive, a little out of the ordinary creats a monstrous positive reaction, rather than people saying, &#8220;Isn&rsquo;t that nice.. But that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re supposed to do!&#8221;</p>
