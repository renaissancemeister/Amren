			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dana Hughes, ABC News, October 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than 1,000 teachers have been fired for sexually abusing girls over the last two years, according to a new report from the Kenyan government. Last year, 600 teachers were dismissed over allegations of sexual abuse, and 500 more have been let go this year. The allegations range from inappropriate kissing and touching to impregnating girls as young as 12.</p>
<p>Although the number of reported cases represents less than half of 1 percent of Kenya&rsquo;s 240,000 teachers, the firings underscore a serious epidemic of sexual abuse in the country, say child advocacy and women&rsquo;s rights groups.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this year&rsquo;s report of abuse in relation to children, sexual violence topped the list at 86 percent,&#8221; said Brian Weke, the program manager of the Cradle, a Kenyan child advocacy group. The report states the highest number of abusers were fathers, followed closely by neighbors and teachers. Weke said he&rsquo;d witnessed the abuse himself while visiting an elementary school in western Kenya where a teacher had impregnated at least 10 girls.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Technically, it is against Kenyan law for an adult to have sex with a minor under the age of 18, but the law is hard to enforce, particularly in rural areas. The victim&rsquo;s family has to press charges and become heavily involved in the investigation, so most accused sexual abusers escape prosecution.</p>
<p>In the case of teachers, the accused and school officials often pay off the the girl&rsquo;s family, who is often poor, to keep the family from prosecuting.</p>
<p>Education for girls, particularly in rural areas of Kenya, still remains a struggle. Once they reach their preteen years, girls are kept at home to help their mothers care for younger siblings, carry water and maintain the household. In some communities, tradition still dictates that teenage girls can be married off by their parents. A girl attending school who&rsquo;s from a poor, uneducated family is especially vulnerable to abuse.</p>

		<p>Now, now, who are we to judge anyone?  We are making the mistake of judging these people from a biased Euro-centric viewpoint.  Each race has a different vibrant and colorful culture, and brings &#8220;new ideas and new ways of doing things.&#8221;  Life would be boring if we were all the same.  These teachers are simply expressing their own unique and diverse culture. And, besides, this behavior is simply a legacy of colonialism and grinding poverty, caused by Western exploitation. </p>
<p>We need to import these fired teachers into the USA as quickly as possible, so that our inner-city children can see more &#8220;faces that look like them.&#8221;  End the barriers that arbitrarily judge all peoples&rsquo; actions on the outdated standards of just one ethnic group.</p>

Great idea! There is one point that I disagree. &#8220;Inner city&#8221; i.e. low income + welfare Black children are already exposed to these vibrant culture bearers. A more effective place for them would be in private schools where the tuition is greater than $15000/year, such as the one your president has enrolled his daughters. In addition, they should be given diplomatic immunity to prevent narrow minded nativists from causing these third world educationalists any legal or financial difficulties.</p>

		<p>Oh man&hellip;here we go.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
&#8220;One of the reasons &hellip; these girls are susceptible to abuse is &hellip; that [parents] are illiterate and don&rsquo;t know what constitutes abuse,&#8221; said Weke. &#8220;They have no proper capacity and means to protect their children.&#8221; <br>
&gt;</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/2g6h5cn" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2g6h5cn</a></p>
<p>Yeah, unh-huh.  Like a -white- poor person &#8216;wouldn&rsquo;t know what to do&rsquo; when his kid came home knocked up by an authority figure who was supposed to be keeping her safe.  Of course, these poor black families may be looking at a cost:benefit&rsquo;s analysis inherent to feeding another mouth with 2,000 dollars worth of hust money.  Or little middle-sister nobody graduating from a school to&hellip; doing exactly what her mother did and grandmother did for centuries before her.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
&#8220;As we are focusing on economic and social rights, we need to make sure we are protecting our children,&#8221; said Weke. &#8220;It is high time that we comprehensively start dealing with cases of sexual violence.&#8221;<br>
&gt;</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/2a2bd3w" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2a2bd3w</a></p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s innocent as in too young to know better and then there&rsquo;s complicit as in blacks begin puberty earlier than any other human female on the planet and once a girl becomes a woman, she is no longer &#8216;innocent&rsquo; of anything, including profit motive.</p>
<p>And when a man impregnates TEN cheerful little busybody teenaged females, there is nothing being hidden here.  Nothing going on behind closed doors, the whole community knows.  And does nothing.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Allocating money for programs to protect children is as important to the future of Africa as any other social or economic project, said Weke. &#8220;They should actually go hand in hand.&#8221; <br>
&gt;</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/2a2bd3w" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2a2bd3w</a></p>
<p>Only so long as The West is doing the &#8216;allocating&rsquo;, right?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one for all you bleeding heart liberals to read-</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/y6b25n</p>
<p>Everywhere BUT the United States (where medical records are controversial in what they hint but do not overtly admit to) forced childhood sexuality is a norm and incestuous childhood sexuality _before menarche_ is the most common mode for it.</p>
<p>India, China, Japan and yes, Africa.</p>
<p>All have huge occurence rates of it.  And yes, it is a power issue whereby patriarchal societies begin early to generate a submissive mindset in their women.</p>
<p>Now add to this the reality that African children are pubescently precocious -because their environment kills them young- and you have the makings of quite a stew of assumptive taboo vs. actual lack of inhibition.</p>
<p>My only request is that whatever happens in Africa, stays in Africa.  We don&rsquo;t need to offer them drugs or food or money just to alleviate the pain that their predilections and environmentally driven exploitative instincts bring down upon them.</p>
<p>God will not turn his face from us for protecting our own and letting what is the truth of other cultures remain strictly theirs&rsquo; and theirs&rsquo; alone.</p>

		<p>Oh, shame, they are from a different culture. In mandela&rsquo;s wonderful New South Africa, the blacks rape babies barely six months old. This is common practice, because according to their &#8220;culture&#8221; it cures them from AIDS. They mutilate babies for body parts for their sangomas&rsquo; muti. But they drive fancy wabenzi&rsquo;s and live a lifestyle that you Americans can&rsquo;t imagine. And they consider themselves &#8220;civilised&#8221;. Driving a fancy car does not mean your&rsquo;e  civilised, inventing, developing and building that car is part of being a civilised race or people. Pity that the bleeding heart liberals will never understand that.<br>

		<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t really matter whether Black children grow up in fatherless homes because the Black fathers abuse their children as well.</p>
<p>The concept of rape is abhorrent and added to it the fact that one could victimize an infant is inconceivable.</p>

<p>Notice how Fox news channel praised Nelson Mandela last week? The NEO-cons are as bad as the libtards when it comes to spreading more lies about how great MLK and Mandela were/are.  I always hear how it was the Republicans (they brag about it) that was behind the Civil Rights movement and the freeing of the slaves&hellip;they sure do like to take &#8220;credit&#8221; for our downfall, don&rsquo;t they? This is when I left the Republican Party for good. They will never wake up to what they have done to destroy their own racial brothers/sisters. </p>

		<p>&#8221; The report states the highest number of abusers were fathers, followed closely by neighbors and teachers.&#8221;</p>
<p>This report is not surprising, as many submerged reports about Kenyan incest have been known by many but have not been easily attainable.  The PC bunch has made it their life&rsquo;s work to bury any negative reports about blacks everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Incest within the black community here also is far greater than any other group, but we never hear about it.  To learn of it requires much time searching through the Google process.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just wondering if these people who omit, hide and ignore important data realize that no criminal situation at all can be improved upon unless its existence is reconized and remedial action taken to at least alleviate the problem. </p>
<p>One very important factor could well be that 70% of black homes are fatherless, and black males so rarely see their children their daughters are strangers to them, making sexual contact more acceptable.</p>
<p>I predict we will see a book out within the term of the next president which will reveal many pathologies within the black community in a frantic attempt to improve it, because by then the country will be in VERY serious social trouble and the truth will finally be acceptable merely as an act of final desperation to somehow prevent break up.</p>
