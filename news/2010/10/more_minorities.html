<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More minorities enrolled in medical schools across the country this year, a sign that more black, Hispanic and Native American students are interested in pursuing careers in medicine as the nation begins to implement the new health-care law, according to a study released Wednesday by the Association of American Medical Colleges.</p>
<p>Hispanic men represented the most significant increase compared with 2009, about 17 percent, while overall enrollment by Hispanic men and women rose 9 percent. The number of new African American medical students increased about 3 percent, the study said.</p>
<p>Native American enrollment increased by nearly 25 percent over last year, but the numbers were small compared with other minority groups.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The association projects that the nation will have a shortage of 90,000 doctors by 2019, even as the health-care overhaul, which will provide insurance to 32 million Americans who are currently uninsured, creates a higher demand for physicians.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Minorities can smell a corrupt government gravy train a mile away. As usual they are lining up for their fill&hellip;</p>
<p>As usual it is the white man who loses. We lose our tax dollars, the quality of our medical care and though it means nothing to most: a little bit more of our honor.</p>

		<p>Why aren&rsquo;t the same programs made available for disadvantaged whites? There are white people in such places as Appalachia and other places that have a poor white population. These whites are just as disadvantaged as any minority. I think these programs should be income based rather than race based. An African American or other minority that comes from a wealthy family has the same opportunities that whites do.</p>

		<p>If we can&rsquo;t lower the standards by recruiting substandard &#8220;minorities&#8221; in this country we will just import them from foreign third world lands. The takeover of the White man and America is almost complete. All without a whimper. America cannot be AMERICA without it being 99% or 100% WHITE! Remember folks, this has been planned for eons and is no accident.</p>

		<p>Of course enrollment is going up. Most places are using two different versions of admissions criteria, and signed on to various AA policies (though few of them openly admit the extent of them). </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a pharmacy student, and its not completely unusual to find someone sitting next to me who held a 2.5GPA that is black, or female. What is unusual, is to find a white student who had less than a 3.2GPA. </p>

		<p>The vast majority of medical practices are for-profit. Without that reserve, the hospitals, nonprofit or not, can&rsquo;t run. I am very selective about my physician, primary or referred. If patients won&rsquo;t see certain doctors, which they have the right to do (so far), that doctor won&rsquo;t last as a partner or employee in the practice very long. Obama and Holder types would then try to extend the CivilRights Act of 64 to your choice of doctor. Until then, say no to the names that sound like an anthology of Hindu myths or a Thousand and One Nights. And regardless of name, if you can&rsquo;t understand the doc&rsquo;s English, even if he/she seems to know the words but can&rsquo;t pronounce them clearly, run past that horrified nurse, leave and don&rsquo;t pay. </p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s always missing from these &#8220;official&#8221; pronouncements is any explanation of <i>why</i> we should regard these figures as a wonderful thing.   Will &#8220;minority&#8221; doctors be somehow magically superior to White doctors?  Certainly our Imperial elites seem to think so.  &#8220;Diversity&#8221; is presumed to be such a blessing that we must all love it for its own sake.</p>
<p>For a bunch that claims &#8220;race is just a social construct,&#8221; Marxists pay an obsessive amount of attention to race.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that the majority of those Hispanic medical school enrollees are of the mostly-European-descended type.  Since the &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; category does not distinguish between Amerindians, Africans, Mulattos, Mestizos, and White Europeans, the best thing you can be right now is a White European with a Hispanic surname.  You get the best of both worlds - the IQ advantages of being White, plus the affirmative action benefits of being Hispanic.  </p>

<p>Even if true less than 50% of Hispanic medical school graduates pass their medical boards.  So clearly something is wrong with them.<br>

		<p>The shortage of doctors is coming from runaway growth of the minority populations so I suppose it would make sense to recruit more minority doctors for minority patients.  What I worry about is the government eventually taking away your right to choose your own doctor.  I would never go see a black, Indian, Chinese, mestizo or any other nonwhite doctor.  I also think that alot of these minorities don&rsquo;t want to be in the care of an affirmative action physician either which could cause a shortage of care available from White doctors for White patients.</p>

		<p>This article is lacking in information and detail. I can&rsquo;t condemn or applaud these minority students until I&rsquo;m shown how they measure up against their white counterparts.</p>
<p>Also, I wonder how many of these Native American students are Caucasians with 1/4 or even 1/8 of Indian blood (which is what some tribes and legal definitions require for their recognition as Native Americans.) My mother once taught school near Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota.  She mentioned that many of her Indian students were mixed with 1/2 Irish or German, and were generally mild-mannered and above average in ability.   </p>
<p>America ought to be a meritocracy. If a minority can meet the same medical school admissions requirements as other students, and perform as well, I&rsquo;m fine with that. But I take issue if they are gaining admissions points simply for their background. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a full blooded Indian attending Stanford Medical School. I did NOT ride on affirmative action. In fact, my MCAT scores were in the 99th percentile and I graduated from U.C Berkeley with a 4.0 GPA with a major in biochemistry. I&rsquo;m 100 percent Indian with NO white blood what so ever. </p>
<p>okay&hellip;&hellip;.I&rsquo;m the type of Indian from India&hellip;..</p>
<p>How come we are held to higher standards than whites when it comes to medical school admissions even though we are also called &#8220;indians&#8221;?</p>
