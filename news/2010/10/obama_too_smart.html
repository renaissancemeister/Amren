			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard Gwyn, Toronto Star, October 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Barack Obama has to be one of the smartest, eloquent, calm and cool and psychologically well-balanced (think of Bill Clinton, George W. Bush or Richard Nixon) American presidents of modern times.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also one of the toughest, although he neither sounds it nor looks it. Shrewdly, and surprisingly candidly, an aide has recently described him as &#8220;the most unsentimental man I&rsquo;ve ever met.&#8221; Ruthlessness comes easily to Obama, that&rsquo;s to say, which is what it took for him to beat a presidential nomination rival as tough as Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>And yet his popularity is dragging down toward 40 per cent and by all the omens his Democrats are about to get trounced in the November congressional elections.</p>
<p>Obama does have some serious problems. He&rsquo;s black.</p>
<p>Unquestionably, a lot of Americans hate their national leader being black, and, worse yet, a black who is the smartest man around. It&rsquo;s a variant, incomparably uglier, of the widespread loathing of John F. Kennedy for making people feel bad by being so handsome and sophisticated, sort of a presidential Clark Gable.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the economy. The lack of jobs is serious and perhaps even more so is the widespread insecurity among those who do have jobs. A double-dip recession is a real prospect.</p>
<p>Yet the truth  &mdash;  admittedly a near-irrelevancy in politics  &mdash;  is that Obama headed off a near-depression caused by Bush and corporate greed and arrogance and stupidity, and by his stimulus package brought the economy back at least to consciousness.</p>
<p>Included in this was financial regulatory reform and reform of the auto companies (it&rsquo;s working unexpectedly well). Also health-care reform.</p>
<p>Now he&rsquo;s attempting a second stimulus package. It&rsquo;s been blocked by the Republicans, who are insisting that planned tax cuts be extended to the wealthy (incomes above $250,000) as well as to the middle class.</p>
<p>This blockage of a second stimulus is being cheered on by the populist Tea Party movement. Go figure that, other than that many Tea Partiers undoubtedly can&rsquo;t stand the fact that he&rsquo;s black.</p>
<p>This is the point. Obama&rsquo;s problem, which indeed is sizeable, doesn&rsquo;t reside in himself, although he needs to learn the art of faking sincerity that Clinton, with his &#8220;I feel your pain&#8221; pitch. was so good at. Obama&rsquo;s problem resides in America. It&rsquo;s become a near-dysfunctional society.</p>
<p>The Tea Party, which is a genuine grassroots movement, confirms it. It stands for &#8220;freedom.&#8221; No more big government. No more meddling in people&rsquo;s lives. But instead, Sarah Palin.</p>
<p>That a sizeable number of people should want Palin for president is irrefutable evidence their society has gone dysfunctional. She&rsquo;s a third-rater, except in demagoguery (and in faking sincerity). Paris Hilton would do the job as well, probably better.</p>
<p>Why should this be so? My guess is that Tea Party members and a lot of others, including that Florida evangelical minister who wanted to burn the Qur&rsquo;an, even though it would have put a lot of American soldiers at risk, have actually got onto something important.</p>
<p>That something is that the U.S. today is clearly in decline. This shouldn&rsquo;t be exaggerated. Americans have an astounding capacity for resilience. Once there was humiliation in Vietnam. Once all the experts were saying Japan was about to become No. 1. Both are now history.</p>
<p>The U.S. will always be powerful and wealthy. But it will never again bestride the world like a colossus towering above all others. It will be, rather, a big guy in a crowd.</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s conceit of &#8220;exceptionalism,&#8221; or of being better than anyone else and fundamentally different from all other societies and countries, can no longer be sustained. It&rsquo;s exhausted its quota, a very large one indeed, of bright, confident mornings.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s problem thus is stark and simple: He&rsquo;s the right guy at the wrong time.<br>

		<p>Could someone please provide evidence that Obama is smart?  I have seen no evidence.  Read his inaugural address.  He and his speech writers do not even know how many men have taken the oath of office as president of the US.  They were off by one.</p>

		<p>The &#8216;Toronto Star&rsquo; is derided in Canada as &#8220;the Red Star&#8221;.</p>
<p>Toronto usually votes to the left, and would give Obama a pass on anything just because of his colour.  Many Torontonians are wannabe American Democrats.</p>

		<p>If Obama is so smart, then why has he not yet released his college transcripts?</p>
<p>Judging by his economics policies, I bet he got a very low grade in that class!  He probably did well in sociology, however, as he probably gave his liberal professor all of the politically correct answers.</p>
<p>Based on what I have seen so far, I would say that the people of the United States elected a naive moron as their President in 2008.  </p>

		<p>Just the usual gibberish.</p>
<p>The fact that he got elected because he was half-black is lost on this dimwit.  Had he been white, blacks and white liberals would not have even considered him.  He had no credentials, experience or name recognition.  </p>
<p>And what did he do when he got elected?  He set the tone in the justice department to not prosecute black-panthers and other perps.  </p>

		<p>Just to clarify things for Americans, the Toronto Star newspaper is the most incredibly left-wing biased major media outlet I have ever come across. When I lived in Toronto, I refused to buy/read it. Compare it to the more right-wing Toronto Sun newspaper, and you&rsquo;ll realize that you&rsquo;re comparing night to day.</p>
<p>So just because a Toronto Star columnist chastises Americans for not recognizing Barack Obama as the second Messiah, please keep in mind that this is the opinion of a Toronto Star columnist. It is NOT the opinion of Canadians in general.</p>

		<p>I do believe Bush was an utter idiot and got us into messes he didn&rsquo;t fully understand.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m not buying the &#8220;Obama saved us from a Depression&#8221; line.  I&rsquo;ve not seen anything to prove that other than the claim, repeated over and over.  Most economists I&rsquo;ve read say the stimulus will be a bigger problem down the road.</p>

		<p>I agree that the US is declining, just not for the reasons that the author cites.  Canada is declining just as fast, if not faster.  The demographic shift in Canada is startling to say the least.  Within a few generations Canada will look no different than most places in the US. Smug Canadians used to look over the border and chide white Americans for their crime and guns.  Now places like Toronto are awash in drugs, gangs and non-white criminality.  If Mr. Gwyn is really lucky perhaps after Obama is ousted in a couple of years he will run for office in Canada.  </p>

		<p><i>Unquestionably, a lot of Americans hate their national leader being black</i></p>
<p>The &#8220;thinking&#8221; goes something like this:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m one of the good people - a liberal - and good people - liberals - like me accuse bad people - non-liberals - of racism all the time, and there are lots of bad people - non-liberals - around, ergo, there are lots of Americans who hate the fact that they have a black president.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liberals have the megaphone, and a just-so story (their &#8220;narrative&#8221;).  That&rsquo;s the extent of their &#8220;logic.&#8221;</p>

<p>Laughably this utterly worthless Red fool, Comrade Gwyn, is right about one thing: well, sort of right anyway, when he points to our &ldquo;near-dsfunctional society.&rdquo; This being because it is dysfunctional (not near it, but outright wallowing in that dysfunction) and that General Secretary Obama&rsquo;s problems do reside in this America, the multicultural &ldquo;America&rdquo; that he was supposed to personify and does.</p>
<p>Following these points, the author drifts into idiocy, or perhaps even a level of stupidity that makes idiocy seem like genius. Of course to realize this, Comrade Gwyn would have to openly inflict insightful &ldquo;hate speech&rdquo; on both the USA and his own country of Canada. The multicultural and &ldquo;citizens of the world&rdquo; nonsense that is both Comrade Gwyn&rsquo;s and his mulatto Stalin&rsquo;s insane ideology, have nothing to do with saving or building anything, only destroying (or as they like to call it &ldquo;deconstructing&rdquo;) everything Western Civilization has produced (aside from Marxist-Leninism) and those human beings (i.e., whites) who built that civilization.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>He is not &#8220;black&#8221;. Another liberal self-serving feel-good myth. He is multi-racial, with Kenyan, American white Communist, and Indonesian Muslim background. He is a pro-communist Marxist. Such cadres are unsentimental. Their goal is the seizure of  power from the &#8220;bourgeoise&#8221;. Their framework for ultimate rule is democratic centralism, ie. dictatorship.  The prototypes for this unemotional focused robot  are Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Ho, and Castro. When his power is secured, millions of political opponents, real or perceived, are in mortal danger.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s really hard to believe that there are women as stupid and gullible as the one who wrote this story.</p>
<p>She couldn&rsquo;t think objectively if her life depended on it, and it well might in the VERY NEAR future.</p>
<p>As part of the politically correct cult, she has been conditioned and brainwashed to the point where she would need an expert in cult psychology to release her from her biased, conditioned thinking.</p>
<p>She reminds me of the sect that committed suicide, because the mothership failed to arrive to take them to Jupiter.</p>

		<p> No, Obama isn&rsquo;t &#8220;too smart.&#8221; He&rsquo;s &#8220;too smart for his own good.&#8221; That is to say, too &#8220;intellectual,&#8221; too &#8220;elitist,&#8221; and way too cocky. Watch him swagger from Air Force One to the Oval Office; or grin broadly to a cheering crowd as though saying, &#8220;Yes, I agree with you   &mdash;   I&rsquo;m all that and a bag of chips!&#8221;</p>
<p> Does his race have something to do with some Americans despising him? Yes, probably. But if former Congressman J.C. Watts, a black conservative Republican, had won the presidency, then conducted himself as he did while in Congress, the &#8220;racial negatives&#8221; against him would have been very negligible. When you&rsquo;re the first one of your kind to make it to the top, it&rsquo;s best not to strut around as if you own the place, and act as if you really do think you&rsquo;re the &#8220;Mulatto Messiah.&#8221;</p>
<p> Richard Gwyn&rsquo;s attack on Sarah Palin can be put down to the usual liberal resentment of an attractive, articulate woman who is a conservative. And his sneering at the U.S. as being &#8220;on the way down&#8221; smacks of what the Germans call &#8220;schadenfreude&#8221;   &mdash;   taking pleasure at someone else&rsquo;s misfortune. Besides, Gwyn&rsquo;s country has always been a very distant also-ran to the U.S. in this hemisphere, any way you want to cut it. Maybe as a citizen of a big (in land mass) country with an even bigger inferiority complex, he&rsquo;s entitled to do a little gloating.</p>

throw Obama and his band of &#8220;progressives&#8221; out on the pavement.<br>

can put them all to use on your infamous &#8220;Hate Speech&#8221; tribunals<br>
You know where white Canadians are intimidated, brow beaten<br>
and imprisoned for speaking the truth about the cult of Multiculturalism. But as for the US..we have the guts to <br>
tell the truth and fight back. When we are done, and if you <br>
are lucky, we might allow you to sell us some plywood and beer.</p>

		<p>Is it true?  Have we seen the last of &#8220;hope and change&#8221;?  It is the English language that, on Mr. Gwyn&rsquo;s tongue, has become dysfunctional.  He speaks of the economy as &#8220;consciousness&#8221; and one talking head recently described it as a recovering burn victim.  I guess, if you&rsquo;ve misplayed the race and redneck cards, false analogy is the default bid.</p>
<p>This American does not want to bestride the world; he wants to be left alone.  Wasn&rsquo;t it Thoreau who said that he would rather sit on a pumpkin by himself than be crowded on a velvet cushion?</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it is this guy&rsquo;s been smoking, but I want some!</p>
<p>I thought he might be black, because of his uncanny ability to get almost everything exactly 180 degrees wrong, but after following several links back to the original article, I see he&rsquo;s just one of those &#8220;old white guys&#8221; everyone disdains so much.</p>
<p>After making the claim that &#8220;many Tea Partiers undoubtedly can&rsquo;t stand the fact that [Obama&rsquo;s] black,&#8221; he goes on to say that &#8220;the U.S. today is clearly in decline,&#8221; implying that the decline must be due to some kind of covert racism. </p>
<p>But hasn&rsquo;t the US always been a profoundly &#8220;racist&#8221; nation? So how could a less &#8220;racist&#8221; nation now be in decline?</p>
<p>Like I said, I want some of what this guy&rsquo;s been smoking.</p>

		<p>This is the most ludicrous commentary I&rsquo;ve seen yet from our northern neighbor. Obama too brilliant for the slack-jawed dullard crackers of America?  How and why then did they elect him in the first place?</p>
<p>And if he&rsquo;s so utterly brilliant and articulate, how come he needs a teleprompter for his every utterance?  I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if he needs one to place his order in a restaurant.</p>
<p>And if Sarah Palin&rsquo;s so hopelessly stupid and parochial, how did she make it perfectly through her acceptance speech in &#8216;08 after her teleprompter went down early in the speech?</p>
<p>Of course, &#8220;everyone knows&#8221; that all liberals are brilliant and all conservatives, such as the men who wrote our Declaration of Independence and our Constitution, are uncouth and embarassing dolts.</p>

		<p>Gwyn is what Shakespeare would call a cad or a knave, instrumental in selling out &amp; brainwashing his own people into betraying their interests but he&rsquo;s dead-on regarding the end of US supremacy for all time, except he doesn&rsquo;t mention that US resilience depended on its former homogeneity, which must give Old Man Gwyn orgasms. Having read his banal toxic commentary for the last decade, I can say that he is quite a creep</p>

		<p>There is so much (laughable) garbage in this one short essay, that it is difficult to focus on one or two items upon which to comment.  Mostly, there is the sophomoric and childish arrogance of someone who has superficial and scattered reasoning, and who, like many Canadians, has a HUGE inferiority complex about his own very nice, but ultimately historically inconsequential country.  The writer is wrong on just about point he makes, but mostly, he does not understand America or Americans.  Canada does not possess the deeply dramatic - even heroic and tragic - history that America does, and frankly lacks even the myths that most great societies, nations and cultures possess.  What&rsquo;s more, instead of learning from our internal conflicts and antagonisms, they almost embraced imitation of our worst errors, allowing in millions of immigrants unable and unwilling to assimilate, and then catering to them, creating a virtual socialist state, and giving special treatment to people who did nothing to deserve that special treatment.       </p>

<p>There are so many things about this article that make you wonder what planet some liberals are on. None of his conclusions follow the reality. Since this line is the general thought among liberals, it&rsquo;s clear I think for all good people to see that at this time our liberal enemy is completely without sense.</p>

		<p>For the benefit of Americans not familiar with the Star or Gwyn, the former is our most ultra-liberal, left-wing newspaper there is, while Gwyn is a capital L full blown liberal. We have to endure this rubbish every day. We just had an election here today in Toronto by the way, and the Star (naturally) endorsed the openly gay lib-left candidate. He was trounced by his opponent who said that Toronto didn&rsquo;t need any more Tamils on welfare. The disconnect between the Star, its writers and ordinary Canadians is wider then the Grand Canyon.</p>

		<p>Richard Gwyn has a history of being in perpetual denial.  Read his book &#8220;Nationalism without Walls&#8221; for an idea.  There&rsquo;s no question Obama is smart, or at least savvy.  But no one seriously believes he&rsquo;s the smartest one around.  Obama is a lot like Ronald Reagan   &mdash;   he does exceptionally well giving a speech to a large, responsive audience using a TelePrompTer, but he falls apart when he has to communicate off the cuff.  And Obama&rsquo;s first stimulus package can be seen to have made the economy worse.  Not too many people believe that massive government spending is justified in this economic climate.  Indeed, Obama repeatedly and frequently shows us than rather than being very smart, he seems to be unable to count.  His only solution to every problem is to spend more and more money.  </p>
<p>I suspect Obama&rsquo;s IQ is close to that of Ford and Reagan.  For more information, see the article &#8220;Presidential IQ, Openness, Intellectual Brilliance, and Leadership: Estimates and Correlations for 42 U.S. Chief Executives&#8221; by Dean Keith Simonton in the journal &#8220;Political Psychology,&#8221; volume 27, issue 4, 2006, p. 511-526.</p>

		<p>This is a provocative theory that will insult many people. Knowing how the Toronto Star operates don&rsquo;t expect it to present an alternative theory for comparison. So I&rsquo;ll give one. Problems in the USA mostly derive from changing the demographics from 90% white to 65% white and failed social experiments such as mass immigration and aggressive race equalization programs like bussing, AA, and section 8 housing. These changes also created the conditions which enabled Obama to get in the White House. When people see Obama they are looking at exhibit A in the evidence for why the USA is having difficulties.</p>
<p>The Toronto Star had better tend to its own backyard. Today we just elected Rob Ford as the new mayor. The liberal establishment in this city are having a fit. He says immigration to Toronto should be stopped because of the social problems we are experiencing. There is a widespread feeling in Toronto that we are in decline. Many comentators have said the wave that brought in Rob Ford is similar to the Tea Party movement.  </p>

The country is in decline, but anyone who wants to go back to the way things were (that is, back when we were number one) is a dangerous reactionary.

		<p>What many Americans hate about their black President being black is that, firstly, he was nominated by the Democrats because he&rsquo;s black and elected by other blacks and fuzzy-headed dreamers who thought a black Prez could heal America&rsquo;s race and class problems.  Secondly, he has used his position to routinely favor blacks and other non-whites.<br>
People like this writer constantly rail about whites hating Obama because he&rsquo;s black, and yet enough whites voted for him to put him in office.  Now, many are turning against him just as they would any pol who is doing a very bad job.  </p>

		<p>Funny definition of intelligent. Most grade school kids know how many states there are while our current president thought there were 57. As he stated during the last campaign  &#8220;I have campaigned in all 57 states&#8221;. When he won the election I checked into moving to Canada and found they live in a virtual police state. Talking to a friend there I was told putting crosses or nativity scenes on your own front lawn is considered a hate crime there.

		<p>To aey99 #3: One would think that if Barry was as big a Brain Trust as the Liberals like to claim that he is, that they would release his College Transcripts, so they could all crow over his 4.0 GPA. But, that&rsquo;s not the case, is it?</p>
<p>One big reason why he won&rsquo;t release his College Transripts, or his Medical Records, his Birth Certificate, or his Selective Service card, for which Selective Service has claimed to have no record of it, is because the American people would learn that Barry was getting Foreign Student Finacial aid, because he is not a Natural born American, as required to become President, in our Constitution. </p>

		<p>The writer is right about the fading of America, but misses that the election of Obama, as pathetically hopeful as it was, occured because America was already in decline as a political democracy (okay, a representative democracy) and as a world leader.  </p>
<p>The notion that anyone with so little time in government could be president of the U.S. and a world leader, has to reveal the new naivity in America.  It was that &#8220;perfect storm&#8221; of Republican misrule, Democratic misrule, and an at least three-decade long promotion of a black-superman(older, Casius Clay became the first black superman, by default because whites no longer boxed, but still worshipped the sport, much like basketball today).  Obama had every bit of propaganda created since 1965 on his side.  But the falacy of it is showing up today, as many of us knew it would.</p>
<p>This writer is opinionizing from false, or at least, assumed stations.  He says that Obama is black, smart, cool, etc., and that he is black.  Doesn&rsquo;t his white mother&rsquo;s contribution to his genes and education get any credit here?  No, he&rsquo;s black.  Who&rsquo;s the racist now?</p>
<p>Richard Gwyn is the typical PC racist that accepts the superiority of the black man, so calling a half-black, black is some sort of acquissent gesture of acknowledgement.  This is because all that forty years of propaganda has worked on him, and combined with his social state idiology to undermind his own security.  He just doesn&rsquo;t know it yet.</p>

I suppose then the author will blame his latent &#8216;racism&rsquo; for having doubted Obama and the miracle. What&rsquo;s interesting is that Obama does very little.

		<p>I read about five sentences of the article and that was all I needed. it&rsquo;s obvious Obamanation is a plant by the reds who funded the election and knew that a lot of whites would vote for &#8216;a historic candidate&rsquo;. Let&rsquo;s not forget Bush screwing thing up, but Obama has actually made Bush look good. Imagine that.</p>
<p>What I want to talk about is the image of Canada. I read a wonderful book about the War of 1812 by Pierre Berton, and told of the Canadians really getting their sense of nationhood then. had America not tried to invade Canada, probably Canada would have become American by osmosis, much like America is becoming hispanic. Berton points to the heroism of individual Canadians, but also adds Canada&rsquo;s legacy is one of colonialism and being anti-democratic&hellip;they were the loyal sons and daughters, and Canada, as Berton said, is trained not to worship heroes, but losers. Not to be dynamic, but obediant, much as how the Family Compact of Ontario stopped any talk of democracy. To us Americans this sounds awful, but to Canadians it seems to have worked, although they are unable to assert their wishes when the state (and Canadian senate, which is, I understand, appointed and not elected) decides to do something &#8216;for the people&rsquo;s own good&rsquo; like foster PC on them or dump in foreigners.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to be long-winded, but I like a lot of Canadians, and see this as a historical legacy. The book FLAMES ACROSS THE BORDER is a great read. All WNs should read it. Please reply, Canadians.</p>
