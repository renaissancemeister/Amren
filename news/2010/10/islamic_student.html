			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), October 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Radical Islamic extremism is being openly practised at a leading university campus, a report today claimed.</p>
<p>Think tank Quilliam said they had evidence of hard-line Islamist ideology being promoted through the leadership of the university&rsquo;s student Islamic Society at City University in central London.</p>
<p>The group had intimidated and harassed staff, students and members of minority groups, it was claimed.</p>
<p>The counter-extremism think tank said they had evidence of the president of City University&rsquo;s Islamic Society, (ISoc) openly preaching extremism during prayers held on the campus during the 2009/10 academic year.</p>
<p>They said the president  &mdash;  Saleh Patel, was recorded saying: &#8216;When they say to us &#8216;the Islamic state teaches to cut the hand of the thief&rsquo;, yes it does!</p>
<p>&#8216;And it also teaches us to stone the adulterer.</p>
<p>&#8216;When they tell us that the Islamic state tells us and teaches us to kill the apostate, yes it does!</p>
<p>&#8216;Because this is what Allah and his messenger have taught us and this is the religion of Allah and it is Allah who legislates and only Allah has the right to legislate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8216;When a person leaves one prayer, one prayer intentionally, he should be imprisoned for three days and three nights and told to repent.</p>
<p>&#8216;And if he doesn&rsquo;t repent and offer his prayer then he should be killed. And the difference of opinion lies with regards to how he should be killed not as to what he is  &mdash;  a kafir or a Muslim&rsquo;.</p>
<p>According to students interviewed for the report, the actions of leading members of the ISoc made members of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Society (LGBT) feel &#8216;scared&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Some Jewish students felt &#8216;intimidated&rsquo;, and the group&rsquo;s actions forced ordinary Muslim students to adopt hard-line Islamic practices which led to some Muslim students publishing an open letter complaining that their religion had been &#8216;hijacked&rsquo; by the ISoc.</p>
<p>Report author Lucy James, said: &#8216;It is deeply shocking that such extremism is being openly promoted on a university campus in central London.</p>
<p>&#8216;Such extremism can create dangerous divisions on campuses and, if not tackled, may even lead to terrorism.</p>
<p>&#8216;University heads need to recognise this problem and take the lead in tackling it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>City University London Students&rsquo; Union released a statement which read:</p>
<p>&#8216;The report raises a number of issues so the Students&rsquo; Union will be in contact with the authors to review the evidence on which the report is based.</p>
<p>&#8216;The Students&rsquo; Union works closely with the University to act in the best interest of its student body and wider University community.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the university added: &#8216;The University is committed to creating as many opportunities for people of different faiths (and indeed of no faith) to meet and engage in honest and respectful dialogue.</p>
<p>&#8216;The University and the Students&rsquo; Union asks that all Students&rsquo; Union Clubs and Societies  &mdash;  and any external speakers that they invite into the University  &mdash;  abide by its equality and diversity guidelines and values and behaviours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8216;The University works closely with its Students&rsquo; Union and, on a number of occasions, has offered support to the Students&rsquo; Union when the Islamic Society has been found to be in breach of these guidelines.</p>
<p>&#8216;The University and Students&rsquo; Union are constantly reviewing their protocols, to ensure that they maintain an environment that is open and welcoming to staff and students.&rsquo;<br>

<p>Is this the same country that tried Nick Griffin for simply stating a fact the ruling elites didn&rsquo;t like?</p>
<p>If had had been preaching Islamic jihad, he wouldn&rsquo;t have even been on the radar screens of any of these fools.</p>

<p>As a gay white man, I never wanted Muslims or 3rd world populations moving into Western nations. They are the least tolerant and often hate gays for no other reason but them simply being gay. <br>
Often WN are very hostile towards gays, and even on Amren many people have acted as if you can&rsquo;t be white and gay at the same time, but that&rsquo;s a different story.<br>
Muslims don&rsquo;t even tolerate women going to the bathroom without permission, so how on earth are they going to tolerate gays, non-Muslims (especially Jews and atheists), liberals, etc. They will set us back to the days of witch burning (or stoning to be more accurate) and destroy all that Western civilization struggled to create.  <br>

<p>Straight from the horse&rsquo;s mouth. &#8220;Kafirs&#8221; - that&rsquo;s what we non-muslims are.</p>
<p>&#8220;According to students interviewed for the report, the actions of leading members of the ISoc made members of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Society (LGBT) feel &lsquo;scared&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oops! These silly left-wingers that bandy about the term &#8216;islamophobia&rsquo; don&rsquo;t seem to realise that their &#8216;sexual preference&rsquo; is considered a &#8216;capital crime&rsquo; by the adherents of the &#8216;religion of peace&rsquo;, even when they&rsquo;re not living in an islamic country!<br>
The adherents of this &#8216;religion&rsquo; do not belong in Western countries. Hell, they don&rsquo;t even like lesbians, gays and transsexuals!</p>

<p>  Yes, Europe is discovering this and so will Canada and the United States. I think gays have a real stake in stopping Third World immigration. Their rights will not be respected by future Muslim majorities in Europe. The machismo culture of Latin America is not particularly &#8220;gay&#8221; friendly either. </p>

		<p>I have little or no hope for England.  There was once a time in that country when if a group of people publicly spoke in this manner, the king would have executed them.  A bit extreme, yes, but it&rsquo;s not as bad as the current situation.  Now the English are supposed to fawn over semi-literate brutes who threaten mass murder of innocent Britons because a large invisible man in the sky named Allah tells them to kill.  </p>

		<p>This is nothing but a bunch of comments encouraging us to be fruit tolerant. Goodness, is there any medium that doesn&rsquo;t underestimate the public? The white public, anyway.</p>
<p>For all we know these same people are behind the millions of Muslims immigrating to the West - to make us more tolerant of the millions of non-whites already here. And why were those millions imported? </p>

		<p>I read these quotes from an Imam last year. </p>
<p>Islam &#8220;protects the modesty of women.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;In Islam, women have two choices: Get married or become public property.&#8221;</p>
<p>That about sums it up.</p>
<p>Stoning is a moral issue, like slavery. This type of issue will cause violence and warfare. After all, it is worth waging war to eliminate. And to defend.   </p>

		<p><i>Often WN are very hostile towards gays, and even on Amren many people have acted as if you can&rsquo;t be white and gay at the same time, but that&rsquo;s a different story.</i></p>
<p>One reason is that too many homosexuals have aligned themselves with the radical-PC sector of politics. But now that the multicultists have decided to promote Islam as a means to undermine the West, perhaps it is time for those homosexuals to break with PC? <br>
