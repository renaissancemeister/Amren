<h1>Number of Ed Civil Rights Complaints on the Rise</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christine Armario, Sacramento Bee, October 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>African American boys who are suspended at double and triple the rates of their white male peers. English language learners who, for years, remain in separate classes, falling behind their peers and scoring poorly on standardized tests. Disabled students and those with illnesses who are shortchanged at school because of their impairments.</p>
<p>The Department of Education&rsquo;s Office for Civil Rights received nearly 7,000 complaints this fiscal year, an 11 percent increase and the largest jump in at least 10 years, according to data provided by the department. The increase comes as the office proceeds with 54 compliance reviews in districts and institutions of higher education nationwide, including cases involving disparate discipline rates and treatment of students with disabilities.</p>
<p>Why the spike?</p>
<p>Russlynn Ali, director of the Office for Civil Rights, said the reason for the increase in complaints is unclear, but believes students, parents and administrators have more faith that officials will take action.</p>
<p>Gerald A. Reynolds, head of OCR for the Bush administration from 2001 to 2003, said the increase is more likely a reflection of the different approach taken by Democrats  &mdash;  with Republicans running the civil rights office as a law-enforcement shop, and Democrats focusing on social change.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the Christina School District in Delaware, 71 percent of black male students were suspended in a recent school year, compared to 22 percent of their white male counterparts, Ali said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Zero tolerance policies, which enact harsh punishments on everything from swearing to weapons or drug possession, have been widely instituted. Critics say they are ineffective and a one-size fits all solution, and are partly to blame for the growing disparity between white and black discipline rates and a school-to-prison pipeline for those punished.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ali said that in some cases, administrators do not know they are discriminating.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s not a superintendent or a school official or a teacher that I&rsquo;ve met anywhere that says I go to work every day wanting to violate students civil rights,&#8221; Ali said. &#8220;The problem is in far too many cases they actually don&rsquo;t understand what their responsibilities are.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Boston, the Department of Justice and the Education Department&rsquo;s Office for Civil Rights investigated the treatment of English language learners, and found that thousands of students who qualified for specialized instruction guaranteed under federal law were not receiving it. As a result of a settlement, 4,300 students who were improperly identified as non-English language learners will be offered language services.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Under federal law, English language learners must be provided with alternative services until they are proficient enough in English to participate meaningfully in mainstream classes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Alabama, 10 districts are under investigation to determine whether or not students with disabilities are being discriminated against by having a shortened school day based on transportation schedules.</p>
<p>Three institutions of higher education are also under review, including Ohio State University, where authorities will examine the school&rsquo;s response to incidents of sexual violence involving students on campus.<br/>

		<p>&#8220;African American boys who are suspended at double and triple the rates of their white male peers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because they have double and triple rates of vicious misconduct.  Almost every black teenager is a problem case of one sort or another.</p>
<p>Blacks want these black trouble makers to escape any kind of punishment at all.  Of course if that were to occur they would conduct themselves even worse.  With a policy like that chaos would soon follow.</p>
<p>&#8220;English language learners who, for years, remain in separate classes, falling behind their peers and scoring poorly on standardized tests.&#8221;</p>
<p>The only answer here is to require them to speak English before they can enter the country.  We need to run schools as schools, not social engineeering workshops.</p>
<p>&#8220;Disabled students and those with illnesses who are shortchanged at school because of their impairments.&#8221;</p>
<p>How are they &#8220;shortchanged?&#8221; Sounds like nonsense to me.</p>
<p>This entire line of whining is just exactly why we should never EVER have government schools.</p>
<p>If diversity is our strength, what are these PC buffoons complaining about?  Doesn&rsquo;t all this make us stronger?</p>
<p>Diversity is a recipe for failure, and it is the greatest weakness the West has right now.</p>
<p>It is also PROVING to be its downfall.  </p>

<p>Gee, I wonder why!</p>
<p>&#8220;English language learners who, for years, remain in separate classes, falling behind their peers&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in separate classes because La Raza, MALDEF and other malcontents demanded separate bilingual education programs even though &#8216;total immersion&#8221; works better.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Alabama 10 districts are under investigation to determine whether or not students with disabilities are being discriminated against by having a shortened school day based on transportation schedules.&#8221;</p>
<p>So first the Left forces busing upon us, now they whine that it hurts disabled kids.</p>

<p>I bet Ali knows! Holder [ZANU-PF] know, etc.</p>

<p>They demand separate instruction and then complain it doesn&rsquo;t work and everyone else is to blame except them; the &#8216;victims&rsquo; racism and xenophobia.</p>
<p>They demand we teach their children but when we remove the troublemakers, we&rsquo;re guilt of targeting blacks.</p>

		<p>This country has enough problems with blacks already here.  And we are letting in more, no speak English to boot.  Whoever is doing this should be forced to personally support them.  Past generations worked so hard to build this country now it is all for the taking.  Very sad.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve taught in majority black high schools. Got along with most of the kids by down-sizing the material to their level. Then figuring out which ones were bright enough to understand the &#8220;official curriculum&#8221; and getting that material to them. But there was always a sizaeable minority in the class who couldn&rsquo;t care less about any learning. Constant defiance, swearing, touching girls in the case of males, constant listening to ipods and cell phones. I got rid of them. One by one. The fewer there were, the better the class functioned. Are we talking Chestnut Hill Mass, or Beverly Hills? No. But it functioned,and a few actually went on to become honest citizens with some sort of college degree. </p>
<p>Until we understand that by ninth grade a high percent of black males, and a significant percent of female blacks need to be removed from the normal high school process, we will have failing schools. It takes only several to destroy a class of twenty five kids. </p>
<p>There still are some administrators, including old school religious blacks, who will back teachers trying to teach without gross sexual and perverted behavior present in the classroom, but the word is out that suspensions are disfavored and that everyone has to graduate. The Obama regime&rsquo;s influence affects every school system in this regard. Don&rsquo;t believe a word about Obama&rsquo;s dislike for black youth looking to hip hop and criminals for examples. </p>
<p>This character was a druggie in High School, scored lousy grades, and ended up in the Ivy League. I wonder why and what lesson the Annointed One drew from his finger the System which rewarded him royally?</p>

<p>Ali said that in some cases, administrators do not know they are discriminating.</p>
<p>How are instituting one-size fits all solutions, where punishments are applied across the board, the cause of any disparities?  Unless they mean that the rules are enforced differently, but they didn&rsquo;t say that. My suspicion is that when punishments are applied without regard to race, more black youths will be punished due to the higher misbehavior rates among black youth. Hopefully these rules would be acceptable to all parties, since it treats everyone equally. However, since all races are equal and there is a disparity in punishment rates, then something must be wrong with the rules themselves.  Sounds familar doesn&rsquo;t it?  </p>
<p>And Mr. Ali&rsquo;s statement is just plain laughable.  </p>

		<p>Obviously kids of different intellegence levels will perform differently. Since schools stopped vocational programs the lower intellegence kids are basically shuffled through high school until they are old enough to drop out. Marginal kids get dumbed down classes and are startled to find out that their classes were not adaquate for them to pass college classes. More and more money is thrown at poorly performing minority students and the experts scratch their heads at why the kids are still not up to White and Asian students. </p>
<p>Zero tolerance is generally worthless since both minor infractions are major ones are punished with the same harsh punishment. For example we have all heard of the kid who was expelled for having a nail clipper or giving her friend an asprin. Kids are suspended for &#8220;fighting&#8221; if one or several students attack a vulnerable student and they attempt to fight back. </p>

		<p>On the other hand, for every $11 we spend on students in the lowest 2% of the population, we spent two cents, just two cents, on gifted students in the upper 2% with IQs above 130.</p>
<p>Those gifted students are the scientists and mathematicians who will lead us into the 22nd century.</p>
<p>I demand equal education funding for the top 2% as is received by the lowest 2%.</p>

Then please, Ali, tell them EXACTLY what their responsibilities are.  Give them <b>explicit</b> instructions for bridging the black-white behavior gap.  Tell us PRECISELY what we&rsquo;re all supposed to do, in detail, when black kids commit more infractions in school that white kids.  </p>
<p>I dare you to openly advocate racial quotas in all school discipline, if that&rsquo;s what you want.  Say it out loud!  Otherwise, get in there and solve the problem.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s where this so-called &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; comes in.  The reason 0T was implemented is to give school administrators an easy excuse to suspend whites, to keep the suspension stats from being way too out of kilter.  </p>
<p>Black kid punches white kid in the gut 50 times.  White kid gets off the mat and punches black kid once to stop the punching going in the other way.  Even though white kid&rsquo;s punch was entirely self-defense, school suspends them both under 0T.  So on the books, it&rsquo;s an even distribution of fault.  If they processed this the same way the legal system does (or should), it would be 100% the black kid&rsquo;s fault.  But then you&rsquo;re back at the racial gap.</p>

		<p>&#8220;African American boys who are suspended at double and triple the rates of their white male peers.&#8221;</p>
<p>It must be do to racism.  That is the only logical explanation. </p>
<p>&#8220;English language learners who, for years, remain in separate classes, falling behind their peers and scoring poorly on standardized tests.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we hear about this problem in the Asian community more often?  English is much more difficult to master if your native language is Chinese or Korean than if your native language is Spanish.  Interesting, my law school was loaded with people who learned English as a second language  &mdash;  many people from eastern Europe and Asia  &mdash;  and it didn&rsquo;t seem to affect their LSAT performance.  It must be because their ancestors were not subjected to the same degree of historical discrimination as the Latinos.</p>
<p>&#8220;Disabled students and those with illnesses who are shortchanged at school because of their impairments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Short-changed, huh?  By attending public school until they are 21 so they can live in a group home for the rest of their lives?  Not to make light of these peoples&rsquo; impairments, but we spend substantially more than is necessary to educate people who are unlikely to ever hold a full-time job and are not expected to do so.   </p>

		<p>I went to a catholic parochial school in the 1950&rsquo;s and an all boys catholic school in the early 1960&rsquo;s. In the parochial school our class sizes averaged 65 kids and the average teacher was a 5&rsquo; nun who ruled with an iron hand. Step out of line and you were instantly made sorry for it. In our high school we were taught by priests and aspiring priests who again brooked no indiscipline with an average class size of 55. There was no stepping out of line there either without painful consequences. In the early 1970&rsquo;s bussing began in earnest and all cohesiveness broke down under the all oppressing hand of the social engineers backed by an inept and corrupt government. The transforming of our society from a democratic institution to a marxist utopia began to flower. Local schools were destroyed in the name of progress and parents lost their rights over their childrens educational standards. School boards set the agenda and parents and the taxpayers be damned. Schoolbooks were rewritten to reflect the poisonious ideas of so called elite demigods and our childrens minds infected with anti-white and anti-western sentiments. The seeds of the destruction of all that had been held dear for 200 years by this once great republic had been sown prolifically by the government and the elitists and have brought forth much deadly fruit. If all worked well before governmental interference and students actually learned the curriculum and respected teachers I have to question why anyone in their right mind would think that anything the government and social engineers concoct from their abysmal pit of never ending stupidty would have any validity whatsoever. The government is not the answer it is the problem and has been for the last 50 years. The constraining shackles of these marxist  self appointed destroyers of civilization must be thrown off and our country taken back from them and once again ruled by the people who actually pay the taxes and made this country great. Continuing our slumber is not an option. We must act now or one day we will wake up and find all that we have ever held dear and cared about has disappeared forever. The choice is clear. Either we stand up and do what must be done or prostrate ourselves like sniveling cowards and grovel forever under the iron hand of despotism. </p>

<p>Because they get into more trouble, plus have a prior history of causing trouble.  Same thing with blacks being incarcerated more than whites, or &#8220;get sent to prison longer than a white man&#8221;, and it&rsquo;s because they commit more crimes and have prior criminal records to begin with.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve thought a lot about this problem, after having been a teacher in an urban district for several years now.</p>
<p>Everything you thought about the typical urban school is true.  The blacks and latinos are mostly out of control in one way or another.  (A few are good kids, but they are so few!)  Most have extremely little interest in any type of learning.  They just want to sing, dance, show-off and act the fool.</p>
<p>It boggles the mind why they even bother coming to school, but when you ask them, they all say, &#8220;Mista&rsquo; &#8216;cuz my friends be here.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Then it dawns on you that school is a safe place with free food, white teachers to harass and joke about, some teenage variety and a place where they can be stupid and not get into any serious danger.  Picking up girls (or boys), gang recruitment and &#8220;business&#8221; are also common endeavors.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, white people are the only people who really produce competent teachers, and as long as the majority population of the state is white (even if they have abandoned the cities) then state mandates and standards are enforced.  </p>
<p>This means that urban school districts have mostly whites to choose from, and many of those are rural or subuerban and come in like a peace corp kind of thing.</p>
<p>So the non-white kids get suspended so much more?  Civil rights claims are made?  I say, if you are a white teacher or admin, do not punish black and latino students at all unless you know the parents of that particular kid will back you up.</p>
<p>As one teacher told me, &#8220;Give them the dumbed down work.  If they don&rsquo;t do that, then give them group coloring and crafty-like projects and call it project-based learning.  If only one kid does the work in the group - pass them all!  If you try to teach like they were suburban white kids, you&rsquo;ll get grief after grief.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Feller hit the nail on the head.  To improve public schools we must exclude people according to their unwillingness to cooperate with a simpler, more practical education system.  The gang bangers are lost, the high achievers will continue to do so.  It&rsquo;s the people on the fence that could be good citizens that we lose to the low end of the spectrum.  Simple ain&rsquo;t easy. </p>

<p>&#8220;Oh my! RACISM!!!&#8221;  No, silly liberals, this is just due to the fact that black children commit more delinquent acts than white children.  Whether this is due to cultural/economic reasons, or racial differences, or a combination of both (which is what I believe), is up for debate.  But the fact that they do act out mkore than we do, if a simple FACT.</p>
<p>&#8220;Zero tolerance policies, which enact harsh punishments on everything from swearing to weapons or drug possession, have been widely instituted. Critics say they are ineffective and a one-size fits all solution, and are partly to blame for the growing disparity between white and black discipline rates and a school-to-prison pipeline for those punished.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, their basically saying that, yeah, blacks are far more delinquent than whites, they curse, carry weapons, and do drugs in school, and nothing is going to change that.  The administrators just need to go easy on blacks, or set different standards for them.  Hey, wait a minute&hellip;different standards for different races?  Isn&rsquo;t that basically rascism??</p>

		<p>Every so often, the local newspaper trots out a story about the disparity in discipline between white and black students in the local school system. There is always the inference that the teachers and administrators are out to unfairly punish blacks.</p>
<p>I figured that children still behaved in a similar fashion to when I was in school, and asked the administration to give me the figures regarding the disparity between male and female students. As I suspected, males are disciplined disproportionately to females.</p>
<p>Since boys tend to behave in ways that get them in trouble more often than girls, it should come as no surprise to a right thinking person that they are disciplined more often. Of course the newspaper never mentions the disparity by sex (gender).</p>
<p>Blacks behave in ways that get them in trouble more often than whites do, so it is reasonable that they will be disciplined more often. As they grow older their behavior pattern holds, and they are more often imprisoned. The same nonsensical charge of racism and discrimination is made about that too.</p>

		<p>  &mdash;  Ali said that in some cases, administrators do not know they are discriminating.</p>
<p>The government educational-industrial complex creates these problems. </p>
<p>They continue to insist that &#8216;there is no such thing as IQ&rsquo; and &#8216;we are all the same&rsquo; (ignoring and suppressing all hard evidence to the contrary)  &mdash;  so when there is an intractable &#8216;achievement gap&rsquo;, or a &#8216;suspension gap&rsquo;, it must be the fault of (choose any/all of the following) teachers, White racism, institutional racism, a dearth of proper programs for addressing the needs of  &mdash;  -. </p>
<p>All of this opens the district to litigation  &mdash;  often settled with huge monetary awards and a massive overhaul of The System.</p>
<p>This is a no-win situation  &mdash;  if a violent black is suspended/expelled from school, the district is wide open to charges of disparate rates of disciplining student &#8216;students of color&rsquo; vs. &#8216;others&rsquo;. If a violent black is not suspended, the district is open to charges of &#8216;violation of the safety of the campus&rsquo; when the kid viciously attacks another student or teacher or administrator.  </p>
<p>I have seen this particular scenario in action when an oft &#8216;warned&rsquo; but rarely suspended student instigates a major, injury-causing fight and the parents/community of those injured learn that the instigator had a long history of school violence or felonious infractions but &#8216;nothing was ever done about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think the &#8216;Civil Rights&rsquo; lawyers don&rsquo;t know how to play both sides of this issue, and play it well.  I have heard about, but cannot prove as no evidence is ever made public, large monetary awards paid out as &#8216;damages&rsquo;, sometimes to both sides, to settle this issue.</p>
<p>Communities &#8216;of color&rsquo;, including most recently the Asians community, look upon the government school system as a cash cow  &mdash;   easy to litigate against and collect easy cash from.</p>
<p>As for administrators not knowing they are discriminating  &mdash;   how could they when there are so many arcane rules and regulations to follow, and so many of those rules and regulations contradict one another.</p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p>  &mdash;  As a result of a settlement, 4,300 students who were improperly identified as non-English language learners will be offered language services.</p>
<p>I can predict where the money for this vast, new, money-eating program will come from:  Your White child&rsquo;s AP program (which will be deemed archaic and racist) and your White child&rsquo;s honor program (because it discriminates).  </p>
<p>Your White child will be mainstreamed, sat beside those 30 points below him in IQ, used by the teacher as a tutor, shunted aside and ignored.</p>
<p>THAT&rsquo;S bigotry and discrimination  &mdash;  but if your child is White, good luck trying to sue and collect damages (because you won&rsquo;t win and will probably be called a Nazi at the same time).</p>

		<p>As a school administer in upper administration, I can attest that going through a civil rights&rsquo; audit is no fun.  Most of the government civil rights&rsquo; personnel will have a chip on their shoulder to begin with.  These audits often last many weeks going into months, with school personnel spending valuable hours pulling discipline records, special education IEPs (the student&rsquo;s Individual Educational Plan), attendance records, parent communication records, teacher qualification (is the educator highly qualified in his or her area of expertise [No Child Left Behind requirement]), etc. from years in the past.  The experience will end up being a &ldquo;catch 22&rdquo; for the school (a darned if you do and darned if you do not).  What is amazing, in these closed door meetings between government representatives, parents, educational specialists, administration, the fault for misbehavior will never belong to the actual perpetrator.      </p>
<p>&ldquo;African American boys who are suspended at double and triple the rates of their white male peers.&rdquo;  This is a silly statement as total suspension costs the district money.  So, God forbid we should want to actually suspend a minority thug and, therefore, have a safe school environment.  Also this is why we hold the troublemaker in an alternative school (the state and federal funding/monies will continue to be paid for the menace as he or she remains enrolled).  Truly, many, many minorities simply cannot acclimate themselves to the normalcy of a regular classroom: The older they become the more disruptive and dangerous behavior they exhibit.      </p>
<p>If the school implements a &ldquo;Zero Tolerance&rdquo; application of policy, there is no leeway for circumstances.  As one poster correctly implied, one may be drastically dealt with for simply protecting or defending himself or herself.  And, yes, in certain situations dealing with an incident, hefty settlements are paid by the school&rsquo;s insurance company to avoid the cost of litigation and the public relation&rsquo;s issue of a trial and judgment.<br/>
     <br/>
This is the maniacal flavor of our government and the continuous evolving failure of our public education system; this is the cost of multiculturalism.  <br/>

<p>Cogitator @ 6:59</p>
<p>There is a War on Boys in the schools.</p>
<p>Boys are expected to act like girls  &mdash;  sit quietly, wait their turn, suppress their high energy, concentrate for long periods of time, color quietly, listen to long, boring stories.  This is wrong and I am convinced that this mistreatment (and Ritalin) damage boys&rsquo; psyches.</p>
<p>The schools, especially elementary schools that are almost 100%  run by women, favor girls.  </p>
<p>Normal Behavior for girls is not Normal Behavior for boys and they are often punished for what for them is Normal Behavior.</p>
<p>Nothing infuriates me more and I have done battle with more than one of my son&rsquo;s teachers after I&rsquo;ve been told that he &#8216;won&rsquo;t sit still&rsquo;, &#8216;won&rsquo;t sit quietly&rsquo;, &#8216;won&rsquo;t listen to stories&rsquo;, &#8216;won&rsquo;t do artwork&rsquo; (which he despises).</p>
<p>As margaret has warned us repeatedly:  The schools are run by Feminazis, most of whom do not like or understand boys  &mdash;  or are actively engaged in an ongoing, proactive Battle against Boys.</p>
<p>Parents:  Keep a sharp eye on your boys!  Many teachers  &mdash;   MANY TEACHERS, especially of the elementary variety do not like your sons and are likely to recommend that they be drugged into compliance.</p>
<p>Do you know how many American children are on Ritalin or other psychotropic drugs recommended by the school psychologist?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the LONG line (99% boys) in front of the nurse&rsquo;s office in the morning, lining up for their daily, powerful dose of amphetamine, drugged into drones of The System.</p>

<p>Like Nick says, everyone knows why.  Can&rsquo;t discipline blacks, because then you get the NAACP whining about the suspension gap.</p>
