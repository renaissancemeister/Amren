<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Faced with dropping enrollment and revenue, the high school in this remote Maine town has fixed on an unlikely source of salvation: Chinese teenagers.</p>
<p>Never mind that Millinocket is an hour&rsquo;s drive from the nearest mall or movie theater, or that it gets an average 93 inches of snow a year. Kenneth Smith, the schools superintendent, is so certain that Chinese students will eventually arrive by the dozen  &mdash;  paying $27,000 a year in tuition, room and board  &mdash;  that he is scouting vacant properties to convert to dormitories.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Millinocket {snip} is virtually all-white, though it has hosted traditional exchange students who come for a year without paying tuition.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re used to Stearns High School being a small hometown type of thing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The fact that suddenly we might have up to hundreds of kids from China might change that  &mdash;  in a good way, but we&rsquo;re also kind of scared to lose our town.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Chinese national television produced a series a few years ago called &#8220;Our Students Abroad&#8221;. It presented a picture of Chinese students in the West, living in stereotypical private boarding schools with English style school uniforms, and Chinese students succeeding in classes with whites.</p>
<p>It appeared to be about giving the Chinese an ego boost, showing them as having risen in status in the world to match whites.</p>
<p>The reality of foreign study seems to flow from the same motivation.  The Chinese can take a Western curriculum at home, but they go overseas at considerable expense, to prove themselves. </p>
<p>The only plausible reason is that it fits with China&rsquo;s extra-territorial ambitions, to spread the Chinese nation over the earth, both in influence and habitation.  Many students choose to stay on as migrants.</p>
<p>The residents of Maine should know that countries with a sizable Chinese migrant population will be forever tied to China proper. </p>

		<p>Why does anyone even bother trying to save the white race? The Chinese will be followed by Mexicans and blacks, and the town of Millinocket will become a third world hell hole. Can anyone imagine circumstances where this mad rush to collective white suicide can be reversed?</p>

		<p>Just part of the ongoing sell-off of the US&rsquo;s intellectual advantage, of which there surely can&rsquo;t be that great a deal left. I quite literally see this as educating our future rulers. We can only hope they might one day be as kind in return; though knowing the Chinese quite well, I wouldn&rsquo;t bet on it. </p>
<p>I know there are some China fans on this site but really, we have no right to have sold off generations worth of hard work in the building these educational institutions and the intellectual product of the brilliant minds of our forefathers in such short time, to a rival civilization.</p>

		<p>Let the school die.  Good grief.  Money is more important than survival for these foolish white people.  These white people believe they will have control of the school for a long time.  The Chinese will get control of the school as soon as possible and that money they so desperately wanted will be out of their greedy, foolish hands.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, the Chinese kids probably won&rsquo;t stay there, it&rsquo;s too cold!  There&rsquo;s also no jobs.</p>
<p>Just be thankful you are not about to be inundated with blacks.</p>
<p>On the other hand you will be bringing in hundreds more foreigners to this country which already has too many.</p>
<p>I generally like Chinese people, but isn&rsquo;t there some other thing you can do to save your town from dwindling away?  How about advertising it as a &#8216;whitetopia&rsquo; so aging baby boomers will flock there!</p>

		<p>This superintendent should be fired for lacking minimal intelligence needed to run anything larger than a snow blower. I don&rsquo;t doubt some affluent Chinese parents might pay for their kids to attend New England schools. It snows in much of China too. But for that kind of tuition, and given the excellent training Chinese students, particularly middle and upper class student receive in their own schools, you won&rsquo;t see these super-achievers in a fourth rate small town system far from the tech and cultural centers of Boston or even Portland, Me. For that kind of tuition, these kids can pay their way into the fairly numerous high quality, high tuition private schools that exist in New England, that continue to train a considerable number of our future elites. The Chinese will figure this out faster than the average American citizen who has no idea what St Marks, Brown &amp; Nichols, Choate, Exeter, Andover or Deerfield Academy are.</p>
<p>The average American citizen also thinks that good grades at a &#8220;good&#8221; suburban high school gives little Lindsay the same chance to attend a top US college as the graduates of the traditionally dominant private academies (like the ones preppy schooled Obama attended). Maine really has sunk to the narrow-intellect level of the West Side of New York or the San Fernando Valley, without  decent food (yes, I do like lobster).  </p>

		<p>This is some kind of retarded admission that government and civil service jobs are a form of welfare, for civil service workers. That civil service workers aren&rsquo;t serving the public but themselves. How soon till government bureaucrats and those receiving government benefits vote their &#8216;ideals&rsquo; into perpetual existence?</p>

		<p>&#8220;There is one hitch. Under State Department rules, foreign students can attend public high school in the United States for only a year, a system that Dr. Smith considers unfair, given that they can attend private high schools for four years. He is pressing Maine&rsquo;s Congressional delegation to seek a change, but in the meantime, he intends to recruit a handful of Chinese students to attend Stearns next year. </p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Smith is so certain of success that it almost feels wrong to ask: Why would Chinese parents spend $27,000 to send their children to Stearns High, which is housed in a 1960s building, has only one Advanced Placement course and classroom maps so outdated they still show the Soviet Union, and where more than half of the 200 students are poor enough to qualify for free lunch?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sounds like an unlikely plan given the obstacles.  I have one question.  Is the town onboard with this or is Dr. Smith deciding for them?  If the former, there&rsquo;s a much easier way of raking in quick cash and destroying their town in the process.  Sponsor asylum seekers and humanitarian refugees for the government.  Haitians, Sudanese, Burmese, Iraqis, Nigerians, Ethiopians, Afghans, Palestinians, Somalians, the possibilities are endless.  Scout the area for buildings to convert into section 8 housing and watch those government checks fly.  Couple that with food stamp cards and welfare checks and the town will get a much needed shot in the arm.  That is until their new found residents eventually run them out of town.     </p>

		<p>The smart Chinese students are going to be light years ahead of their white peers in math and science and will probably outachieve them in English within a year or two. Maybe that will help in disproving the myth that Blacks don&rsquo;t do well because of cultural bias and Latinos not doing well because they speak another language at home. The more Asians, the better! It will show that certain &#8220;minorities&#8221; can excel in America without special treatment.</p>

		<p>Remembering the Chinese students I have known, the cold and snow won&rsquo;t stop them. They will be dedicated to the text book and achieve. Not that they are smarter, they work harder, and won&rsquo;t give in to nonsense like drugs, fooling around, and the like that is so typical for many young Americans. They know the value of an education, I must grant them that. As for returning to China, that is NOT a guarantee! Even if they hate the USA, many will stay because it is still better here than in China. They won&rsquo;t like us, true, but they will stay nontheless. </p>
<p>I do believe that China will be a dominate power in the future. I fear for this USA when I see Chinese here, because they are so tied to their motherland. Colonies of Chinese here are not a good thing for this reason. </p>

		<p>Given the mediocre academic environment of this school, it&rsquo;s no certainty that the Chinese will flock there.  OTOH, it probably does have potential for them as yet another immigration beach head, something they (and their American admirers / stooges) can develop over the next few years into a conduit for Chinese immigration, perhaps in the tens of thousands, similar in some respects to the Hmong who have overrun Wausau, Wisconsin.  Of course, the real (and disgusting) significance of this story is how it reveals the collapse of white self-identity and pride in their country.  The white officials in this school district have embraced the notion that the USA is simply a giant corporation, that whites are too stupid to make it profitable, and that Asians - especially Chinese - are the top quality Americans/employees of the future.</p>
<p>A kind of suicide, less violent and slower than a gunshot to the head, but it still ain&rsquo;t pretty.  </p>

		<p>Have the people involved in this ever taken a history course of any sort? The notion that what they&rsquo;re preparing to do might be part of the grand slow sweep of one people conquering another seems totally off their radar.</p>
<p>Instead of learning history, white people today learn that we&rsquo;re all just one big blob of interchangeable humanity. How convenient for the rest of the world which knows better.</p>

<p>Could it be that the whites who are in China are just there to live their lives without trying to take over China?  Maybe the Chinese students are just here to get an education and nothing else?</p>

The people in this forum are so self serving that it defies belief.  Like hungry dogs you turn one another instead offering help or support or even suggestion for this school to keep on running.  If more people in America were more interested in helping one another and society at large maybe this guy wouldn&rsquo;t have to go to China begging for money!?!?  Has it ever occurred to any of you that society&rsquo;s problems start and stop with the person staring at you in the mirror?    </p>

		<p>Poster #10 - &#8220;Could it be that the whites who are in China are just there to live their lives without trying to take over China? Maybe the Chinese students are just here to get an education and nothing else?&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there was any insinuation that they are trying to take over America from within (at least in my first post), but the way the US is going all China has to do is sit and wait and they will run much of the world by default. I do not see how giving such huge numbers of non-White nationals a first-class education (in place of Whites themselves, to a large extent) (and I am not necessarly referring to the above school, but generally) is necessarily a net benefit to our future, I really don&rsquo;t. Sure we retain quite a lot of them (if you don&rsquo;t mind East-Asian migration, which I think many of us are a bit divided on), but the end result is we in effect give China the chance to leapfrog us. I see it more in a competitive sense than anything else. As a well-running &#8220;business&#8221; (which granted, we have not been for a while now for a variety of other reasons too), you don&rsquo;t give your formula away to just anyone who asks for it. Europe is certainly a bit wiser in that regard.</p>
<p>And as someone who has lived in China for over a decade, I can tell you they would not in their wildest dreams consider opening the door to Whites as we have done to them. Sure I know plenty of Whites working there but they are subject to a great deal more rules and regulations than locals. The playing field over there is not balanced. Try opening a shop, try importing a foreign product, try manufacturing something without giving up the complete blueprint, try finding suppliers who aren&rsquo;t constantly looking for an angle to cheat you (and then try finding recourse for court action). You could go into a joint venture, but I&rsquo;ve seen plenty of foreign companies walk into traps set up by their Chinese JV partners. You could try to go it alone if you have the money, but then watch as soon as your business grows successful, sudden awkward rules and regulations spring up like mushrooms after the rain.</p>
<p>If we were just a bit more like that in the West, I wouldn&rsquo;t have much of a problem with it either. As it stands though it feels like a basketball match where we stand at our defensive end and help them shoot the ball into our own net. I am not for complete exclusion of any sort, just for putting in a bit more effort to look after one&rsquo;s own interests. </p>

You can bet if this was a story involving an organization recruiting blacks, the NYT damn well wouldn&rsquo;t have phrased it &#8220;United Nations Hunts in Africa,&#8221;  or &#8220;Tyson Foods Hunts in Detroit,&#8221; lest they face a multimillion dollar claim for &#8220;psychological injury.&#8221;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m no expert on population changes, but I believe the white race is shrinking in numbers in the U.S. (and in its other traditional countries, no?), while the Chinese race is growing in its homeland as well as in the other countries China&rsquo;s overflow has immigrated to (no?)</p>

<p>Close the school.  </p>
<p>Birthrates are on a pronounced decline in the Western world. Like an army that&rsquo;s over-extended itself, we whites have to hunker down in a defensive stance and absorb the losses.  We must hold our ground from outside encroachment until our birthrates restore us.</p>
<p>Everything is cyclical, including birthrates. It&rsquo;s nature. We should not listen to babbling fools who would give up the country to foreigners at the first sign of adversity.</p>
<p>You let the Chinese in as students, they will want to stay as  migrants, displacing whites forever.  </p>

<p>Which proves nothing that we didn&rsquo;t know already. They do well in set invorments that reward route memorization, when they get out into the real world it&rsquo;s a totally different matter.</p>
<p>Amazing how we went to the moon and built a first world society without the help of these intellectually superior beings. You&rsquo;d think with their superhuman intelligence,China would have been economically powerful years ago instead of waiting for America to outsource most of it&rsquo;s tech industry there.</p>

		<p>One would think that he would look to affluent White areas first.  For example, I imagine that wealthy White South African families would be delighted if their children were safely going to school in a lily-White district in Maine, no matter how much it snowed.  I imagine they would have no problem whatsoever coming up with that kind of tuition.  </p>
<p>The automatic knee-jerk reaction for shrinking attendance is China?  What the hell?!</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s the problems as I see them:</p>
<p>1.  They should have gone to Russia or Eastern Europe.  Even if they had to do an &#8216;intermediate vs. enduser&rsquo; sleight of hand to bypass immigration status.  Why?  Whites breed with whites to make more whites and the total sum of demographic allotment of resources stays the same.  No exclusive chunks of the productivity pie cut free to forever belong to others.</p>
<p>2.  Ahem, kids are poor.  One of those things that comes about from having no job.  You import -adults-, as some minor industry that perhaps works -through- the schools (renting the buildings in the summer?) and you bring jobs which brings young people which makes kids happen.  Birds and The Business kind of a deal, women like to get pregnant when dad has a job.</p>
<p>3.  Look at your local resources as a function of county demographics.  Are you farming?  Are you ex-manufacturing?  Was there a military base nearby?  Are you retirees?  What?  (Paper mill it turns out)<br>
I don&rsquo;t believe there is anywhere on the East Coast that isn&rsquo;t built up or developed in some way but if you are truly an hour from everyone, the question has to be what makes you so and it almost always ends up being a landuse issue.<br>
If you have the county-wide, _employed_, population density to bring in a mall and a theater complex, then by all means, build them.<br>
If you don&rsquo;t, then for pities&rsquo; sake, don&rsquo;t assume that children are a &#8216;growth&rsquo; industry unto themselves.  They aren&rsquo;t.  They are a burden because they require oversight and supervision and special assistance not given to adults.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s gonna happen here is that this turns into a settlement for rich Chinese looking to have the Emperor&rsquo;s lifestyle in trade for investment in the town.  That&rsquo;s what Mr. Smith Goes To China is really about.  Screw the kids, bring mom and pop.  To an American retirement in a gated community whose Lake Tahoe environment would cost an ordinary American 4-5 million to own.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
There is one hitch. Under State Department rules, foreign students can attend public high school in the United States for only a year, a system that Dr. Smith considers unfair, given that they can attend private high schools for four years. He is pressing Maine&rsquo;s Congressional delegation to seek a change, but in the meantime, he intends to recruit a handful of Chinese students to attend Stearns next year. </p>
<p>They would come to Millinocket for a year, Dr. Smith said, then perhaps transfer to a private school or enroll in an American college or university. <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>So, they get to ride on the taxpayer bus for a year (how much of 27 grande goes back to state funds and how much is kept in Millinocket?) and then they &#8216;move on&rsquo; to displacing white kids at real institutions?  This is kind of a foot in the door thing?</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a community full of assets,&rdquo; Dr. Smith said, pointing to Mount Katahdin, Maine&rsquo;s highest peak, which looms just beyond the town, and the abundant hunting, fishing and snow sport opportunities that the locals love. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the beauty, No. 1, and the fresh air. And the roads are good.&rdquo; <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Chinese people come to the west coast and frequently cut down every tree on their lot, filling an entire rear yard with concrete for a car park.  Because they just don&rsquo;t get that &#8216;outdoorsy&rsquo; thing we call gardening and yard management.  </p>
<p>Or the attendant real estate values that go with.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Terry Given, an English teacher who was born here, was more blunt. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to sound flip,&rdquo; Ms. Given said, &ldquo;but why not? We won&rsquo;t know until we get the opportunity to know them and give them the opportunity to know us. There&rsquo;s something to be said for putting ourselves out there to see if we can be the prize that&rsquo;s claimed.&rdquo; <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Then stop talking like a whore pimping yourself you silly woman.</p>
<p>I am generally against growth for it&rsquo;s own sake.  I think capitalism at the expense of nationalism is THE BIGGEST MISTAKE of our people&rsquo;s current era.  Exploit everything, keep back nothing, pretend it&rsquo;s tomorrow&rsquo;s problem.  Until your children have nothing to sell.  And so they have no children.</p>
<p>And as usual, it&rsquo;s the 10% of elites looking to add another percentage point to the 97% that they already own who are the &#8216;growth driven&rsquo; problem here.  Because they set the example.</p>
<p>Unfortunately in this &#8216;never been anywhere, don&rsquo;t know nothin&#8221; yahoo&rsquo;s case, it appears to be a downwardly contagious disease.</p>
<p>False Consciousness people.  The tendency to think we drift upwards in class benefits via some inertia effect rather than by strict Malthusian limits on resources.</p>
<p>It is the enemy of everything we hold dear.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t blame this obscure high school in Maine. Take a look at those best private boarding schools in this country, like Exeter, Andover, Deerfield, Hotchkiss, Choate, etc. Or for that matter, consider all the best private universities in this country. They are all disproportionally Chinese. </p>
<p>Many of those private boarding schools even run programs specifically designed for foreign students from Asia. I was admitted into Andover for a one-year postgraduate program with full scholarship, after I finished high school in Beijing. Andover has been taking Beijing students like me ever since the 70s, and has been feeding them into the Ivies. Some older alumni now occupy key positions that affects Sino-American relations. But I eventually declined Andover and went straight to college at Duke (I like the South better), where the undergraduate student body is nearly 20% Asian-American and probably 10% foreign Asian (including South Asian). Whites make up slightly more than 50%.</p>
<p>I must agree with Feller #7 that most Americans know absolutely nothing about those preppy private feeder schools, which is pretty sad.</p>
<p>It is worth pointing out that the Chinese has been attending these American school since the 1870s.<br>
<a href="https://www.cemconnections.org/" rel="nofollow">https://www.cemconnections.org/</a><br>
Duke (then Trinity College) happened to take in the Chinese student who late became the patriarch of the most powerful Chinese political family during the ROC era.<br>

WHY, with all the alleged &#8216;over-crowded-urban-schools&rsquo;, would anyone propose looking to other countries for students?</p>
<p>At least start by helping out American students. That at least is zero-sum.</p>
<p>These people are either dense or out of their minds.</p>

		<p>Of course, being educated in another country always means that these ex-students will always be friendly towards that country. See this:<br>
https://www.sicilianculture.com/news/2002-hellandback.htm</p>
<p>Or read about another fine graduate of an American institution of higher learning:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoroku_Yamamoto" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoroku_Yamamoto</a></p>
<p>Anyone else remember the Iranian students running wild in Beverly Hills to protest the Shah being granted the right to enter the U.S. for medical treatment? Yes, the philosophy of educating the world has worked so well for us. Anyone want to bet on which ethnicity the next spying-for-China perpetrator will be?</p>
