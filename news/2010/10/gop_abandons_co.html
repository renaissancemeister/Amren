<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Republican candidate for Congress in New York is facing a fierce backlash from his party after an essay surfaced in which he criticized interracial marriage and socialization.</p>
<p>Party officials have rescinded their endorsement of Jim Russell, who is challenging Democratic Rep. Nita Lowey in New York&rsquo;s District 18, and they are now trying to strip his name from the ballot.</p>
<p>The controversy exploded earlier this week after Politico.com unearthed an essay Russell wrote from the 2001-02 edition of the Occidental Quarterly.</p>
<p>In it, he assumed an academic tone to rail against interracial relationships of any kind, criticizing &#8220;miscegenationist&#8221; movies like &#8220;Save the Last Dance&#8221; for what he described as an attempt to &#8220;exploit the critical period of sexual imprinting&#8221; in impressionable young women. He argued for keeping races at a distance from one another.</p>
<p>&#8220;While liberals and universalists constantly yammer about &#8216;bringing us all together,&rsquo; and how &#8216;diversity is our strength,&rsquo; it may be suggested that the biological function of human language and culture is just the opposite, that is, to keep discrete groups apart,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>Russell questioned &#8220;how a child&rsquo;s sexual imprinting mechanism is affected by forcible racial integration and near continual exposure to media stimuli promoting interracial contact.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The most serious implication of human sexual imprinting for our genetic future is that it would establish the destructiveness of school integration, especially in the middle and high-school years,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;It also compounds the culpability of media moguls who deliberately popularize miscegenation in films directed toward adolescents and pre-adolescents.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the midst of this onslaught against our youth, parents need to be reminded that they have a natural obligation, as essential as providing food and shelter, to instill in their children an acceptance of appropriate ethnic boundaries for socialization and for marriage,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>New York GOP spokesman Alex Carey told FoxNews.com that the party will have nothing to do with Russell.</p>
<p>&#8220;We strongly condemn Mr. Russell&rsquo;s words and no longer endorse him for the election,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Carey said the Westchester County Republican Party chairman is trying to remove Russell&rsquo;s name from the ballot, which he gave a &#8220;50-50&#8221; chance of working out. Russell reportedly is listed under the Conservative party as well.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Russell has tried to defend his work and his character, blaming the hubbub on the media and his opponent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to maintain diversity,&#8221; Russell said, adding: &#8220;We want each group to have a sense of its own heritage and its own culture as they&rsquo;re growing up. It&rsquo;s important to understand your own background before you can appreciate other peoples&rsquo; background, and that is the gist of my essay.&#8221;</p>

						<p>
							<i>Maggie Haberman, Politico, September 20, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Longtime Democratic incumbent Rep. Nita Lowey&rsquo;s Republican challenger this fall is a Christian conservative author and activist whose writings have frowned on inter-racial marriage and movies like &#8220;Save the Last Dance,&#8221; touted the benefits of studies linking race to IQ and said parents need to teach their kids &#8220;appropriate ethnic boundaries&#8221; for marriage and socializing.</p>
<p>Jim Russell, who&rsquo;s challenging Lowey in a repeat after trying to take her on in 2008, made the statements in an essay called &#8220;The Western Contribution to World History,&#8221; which was published in a 2001-2002 edition of the Occidental Quarterly, and had also been featured on infamous former politician and Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke&rsquo;s website. It&rsquo;s since been taken down from there.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still available in the back issues of the Occidental Quarterly, a far-right magazine that the civil rights-focused Southern Poverty Law Center dubbed a &#8220;racist&#8221; publication whose &#8220;editors and advisory board members have constituted a &#8216;Who&rsquo;s Who&rsquo; of the radical right, and its regular publication of extremists&rsquo; articles has made it a favorite among academic racists in America.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the essay, Russell also {snip} praises a book, &#8220;Camp of the Saints,&#8221; that the SPLC has said is &#8220;revered by American white supremacists.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The more notable passages from the essay include:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>* &#8220;Despite threats on his life, Arthur Jensen persevered in studying the relationship between IQ and race. In Canada, neither state-sponsored censorship nor private harassment has deterred J. Philippe Rushton&rsquo;s inquiries into Race, Evolution and Behavior. The importance of applying eugenic measures in the West becomes evident from Richard Lynn&rsquo;s recent work on Dysgenics and his just-released seminal work Eugenics: A Reassessment.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>* &#8220;While liberals and universalists constantly yammer about &#8220;bringing us all together&#8221;, and how &#8220;diversity is our strength,&#8221; it may be suggested that the biological function of human language and culture is just the opposite, that is, to keep discrete groups apart.&#8221;</p>
<p>* &#8220;It has been demonstrated that finches raised by foster parents of a different species of finch will later exhibit a lifelong sexual attraction toward the alien species. One wonders how a child&rsquo;s sexual imprinting mechanism is affected by forcible racial integration and near continual exposure to media stimuli promoting interracial contact. The most serious implication of human sexual imprinting for our genetic future is that it would establish the destructiveness of school integration, especially in the middle and high-school years. One can only wonder to what degree the advocates of school integration, such as former NAACP attorney Jack Greenberg, were conscious of this scientific concept. It also compounds the culpability of media moguls who deliberately popularize miscegenation in films directed toward adolescents and pre-adolescents. In the midst of this onslaught against our youth, parents need to be reminded that they have a natural obligation, as essential as providing food and shelter, to instill in their children an acceptance of appropriate ethnic boundaries for socialization and for marriage.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sociobiological warfare that our youth is subjected to is likely to be even more diabolical since it appears to deliberately exploit a biological theory of sexual imprinting at the critical period of sexual maturity. Movies like this past year&rsquo;s spate of miscegenationist titles, Save the Last Dance, Crazy / Beautiful and O, a parody of Othello, appear deliberately designed to exploit the critical period of sexual imprinting in their target audiences of white pre-adolescent girls and adolescent young women.</p>
<p>&#8220;The current of misdirected altruism that permeates contemporary Western society is dangerous when it is divorced from biological reality. It would be better to ignorantly adhere to the laws of human evolution, as do most primitive peoples, than to understand these laws and yet deliberately disobey them. It would be most tragic if the people who discovered the theory of evolution were to perish due to a failure of will to apply it to their own destiny.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I see nothing but the truth here.  Now we can&rsquo;t have any of that!</p>
<p>If there is no god (and I truly see no reason to support such a concept as would destroy value to suppress excellence), then we must truly reckon solely for ourselves the depth to which blind trust in the flow of &#8216;social evolution&rsquo; will allow for us to continue to dog paddle along behind equally blind leadership.</p>
<p>With the exception of the arctic regions, there are no physically empty spaces in the world behind whose natural barriers we could shelter in refusing to share in such a dice toss approach to sharing our genome&rsquo;s potent gifts.</p>
<p>We NEED White Society to sustain us because no other has proven capable of standing up to our levels.</p>
<p>Furthermore, through induced study shortcomings of our biomedical community we have NO clue, beyond 18th century farmer&rsquo;s wisdom, as to the dysgenic nature of hybrid slump after a few generations of hybrid vigor.</p>
<p>What it specifically does to endanger long sequence DNA repsonsible for the promulgation of intelligence, social cohesion and moral thinking.</p>
<p>As I see it, did we start tomorrow to begin such realistic and openly reported genetics studies, WE WOULD NOT KNOW IN TIME whether or not our worst fears over miscegenation were valid as a justification for resurrecting the barriers which have preserved us for so long.</p>
<p>The fact that investigation of these differences among population groups is so rabidly suppressed suggests that SOMEONE ALREADY DOES KNOW HOWEVER.</p>
<p>And whether out of simple material greed and desire for empowerment by lessening the success of the competition.  Or an actually misguided belief in unity-of-species for it&rsquo;s own sake (or some insane racial guilt); it is -their- motivation which worries me.</p>
<p>Because any excuse used for keeping us ignorant must first abbrogate the Jeffersonian truism at the top of every AmRen page:</p>
<p>&#8216;There is not a truth existing which I fear or would wish unknown to the whole world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>America was built on the notion of free will among free men who could be entrusted to make decisions based on rational awareness of the known facts and the trended consequence to their future use.</p>
<p>Anyone who would socially engineer a state and the nation which underlines it &#8216;for the betterment of aught else&rsquo; beyond it&rsquo;s (democratically majority) peoples.  While suppressing the self determinative rights of those whom they victimize with enforced misinformation and selective social punishment for saying what is true, are the actual criminals whose villainy should be preemptively avoided as much as retaliated for.</p>
<p>The only alternative to retaking control over our government (in the face of majority perception of &#8216;racism&rsquo; as a communicable disease rather than reality driven awareness) is secession in a period of crisis for which such huge national stress exists that forced reunification is not practical.</p>
<p>To create our own barriers.  And find our own truths.</p>

		<p>The Party of Lincoln remains in thrall to the media.  Unfortunately, there is no way to put this witch&rsquo;s brew back in the bottle.  We need more candidates like Russell who will simply face down the media, never apologize and keep right on making waves.  Mr. Russell is heroic and should be supported by like-minded citizens of ALL races.</p>

		<p>- I remember my blonde sister coming home from school (in 1980!) and proudly declaring she now had to have a mulatto boyfriend (not that she even knew one at the time)&#8221;because everything else would be racist&#8221;.<br>
I told her:&#8221;Sis, you cannot walk 20 meters in MY city with a [assorted blasphemy and racism, rather colourful] without me knowing inside three hours.&#8221; She looked me in the eye, saw that the assessment was realistic, and that was the end of it.<br>
She was TWELVE! I mean, how sick can you get?</p>
<p>- Of course, nowadays this would constitute a federal felony (in the US, that is). The Kenyan gave his constituency ius primae noctis as one of the first things he signed into law.</p>
<p>(and, what do you know? Now I have three sweet blonde nieces &hellip; worth to go to jail for)</p>

		<p>Jim Russell hasn&rsquo;t even proposed any laws banning interracial marriage, he has merely expressed his personal disapproval of it.  Nonetheless that&rsquo;s enough to bring down the wrath of the Useless Party, which again shows that it is nothing more than Democrats with tax cuts.  Go to a dating site and you&rsquo;ll see plenty of people looking for a mate of the same race.  I guess the Useless Party doesn&rsquo;t want any of their votes.</p>

		<p>The different racial groups have evolved in response to different population pressures.  Consequently, they differ in terms of average ability levels, personality, and character.  At the same time there is considerable overlap.  Moreover, personality and character can be shaped by the environment.  <br>
 <br>
I do not see why friendships across racial lines should be discouraged.  Integration, which should not be compulsory, should not be prohibited either.  <br>
 <br>
Whether or not Jim Russell should be elected to Congress should be left up to the voters in his district. I suspect many of them agree with him on this matter.   </p>

		<p>Mr Russell is entitled to his opinion on integration and miscegenation. Just as those criticizing him are entitled to pretend to disagree with him. I say &#8220;pretend&#8221; because we know full well most of them don&rsquo;t engage in either of those things themselves. And I, of course, am similarly entitled to criticize them for their hypocrisy.</p>

		<p>I would like to see Mr. Russel given an invitation to join American Renaissaince as a writer, and speaker. We can always use another good man on the team, and he seems like a perfect fit.</p>
<p>As far as the useless Republicans go, either we use this Party, with enough of our own people in numbers, to raise hell during the election season, with real issues in front of our White voters, or we get together and join the America First Party, or Constitution Party, and use these smaller Parties to grow our political base. </p>
<p>Most true Conservatives, as well as Nationalists, remain in the GOP, because they have a presence on the ballot, but they still detest the current situation the Party is in. </p>
<p>We need to stop playing defense, and go on the offensive, and continue to pound away at all their PC, until it is exposed for all to see what a pack of lies it really is. </p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t you just love October before a major election?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been waiting for the &#8216;October Surprises&rsquo; for two months now, haven&rsquo;t been disappointed, and it&rsquo;s starting to heat up.  In California, Moonbeam&rsquo;s operatives are parading Whitless&rsquo;s crying former illegal nanny in front of the media, screaming that Whitless treated her like garbage.  Yesterday, Whitless struck back after an aide (sounded like Moonbeam to me) referred to Whitless as a whore on an open cell phone.  LOL.</p>
<p>As for the racialist writing:  This wasn&rsquo;t vetted before the election season began?  Usually these guys&rsquo; lives are put under an electron microscope before being run by the GOP or Dem. parties  &mdash;  because you can be sure your opponent will turn over every rock going back to your birth to dig up any dirt you on.</p>
<p>As for Jim Russell:  Welcome to The Machine!  You will be triangulated against by the media, government and your own party, made to look like a Nazi and a fool.  It&rsquo;s over for you.</p>
<p>But the worst of it? This: &#8220;Party officials have rescinded their endorsement of Jim Russell&hellip; and they are now trying to strip his name from the ballot.&#8221;</p>
<p>The New York Democrats have a great friend and ally in the GOP it seems, maybe they&rsquo;re working together.</p>
<p>As for me:  I plan to vote for the Libertarian candidate for governor in California, Dale F. Ogden, I see no other choice  &mdash;  and up my donation to OQ.</p>

		<p>Ethnic minorities support the idea of people marrying within their own races. Indians like to marry other Indians. Blacks like to marry other blacks. Chinese like to marry other Chinese. Native Americans go to great lengths to determine your racial purity, before they enroll you in their tribes. </p>
<p>The people who are ostracizing and marginalizing Mr. Jim Russell are conservative whites in the Republican Party. I have a question for those whites who are into pro-white advocacy. Why do you fight for white people, when those same whites you are fighting for, often distance themselves from you for your pro-white advocacy?</p>
<p>Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, and Louis Farrakhan, are loved by their people, for standing up for their people&rsquo;s rights. But if you stand up for the cultural or racial heritage of whites, white people will call you vile names, and marginalize you. </p>
<p>Most of you posting here, cannot openly express your views openly in your place of employment, because your white bosses may fire you. White people prefer respectability to being right. If you openly express pro-white views, you become a non-person among most &#8220;respectable&#8221; whites, and find it hard to make a living.</p>
<p>Do you ever ask yourself whether it is worth it? Why do you fight for white people who insult you, and try to get you fired from your job? Why should you as an individual love white people, more than they love you? Why should you fight for the future of your white neighbor&rsquo;s children, when your neighbor does not give a damn about their future?</p>
<p>Jim Russell is a mainstream Republican who simply expressed a view on interracial marriage that most people of all races hold privately. If white Republicans cannot support a mainstream person like Jim Russell, then why should any sane person be a pro-white advocate? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to look out for your own private interests, as other whites are doing?</p>

		<p>I oppose and always have opposed miscegenation. IMO, there is nothing WORSE than a race traitor. I am talking about White miscegenation, as I do not care about the nonwhite race&rsquo;s miscegenation. </p>
<p> It took thousands of years for our ancestors to keep the line pure and then comes along the lying propaganda, political correctness (all promoted by our enemies) and too many Whites took the bait. </p>
<p>When I see far too many of our young White girls and boys  flipping over these blacks in entertainment and sports, I hang my head in shame. Even over the few black &#8220;country singers&#8221;.</p>
<p>Dancing With The Stars is another show that pairs a black with a White and the audience and judges fall all over themselves for the black &#8220;star&#8221;. But we all know who and what those &#8220;judges&#8221; are. I am now waiting for the Bachelor and Bachelorette to start having blacks vying for the White person&rsquo;s love and rose. Not to mention American Idol with all their blacks and gays taking stage. </p>
<p>I look at our young people and see no hope for them.  Most seem so lost and without a soul. Their parents and grandparents set the stage for this mess. They were too weak to stand their ground and fight back against the forces of evil. Because that is what it is: evil.</p>

		<p>When I was in my first job, 20 years ago and in a new city, I became friends with a black co-worker. His family was part of the small black elite of the city. This was back in my stupid days, and one time when the topic got around to interracial dating, I was shocked (shocked!) to learn that his parents not only disapproved but threatened disownment if he ever brought a white girl home. This was rather more severe than my own parents ever threatened, with possibly greater social and financial consequences than I would have faced.</p>
<p>It was a real eye-opener for me, as I&rsquo;d thoughtlessly assumed that any minority would be happy or at least sanguine about interracial relationships. I saw the error, but it still amuses me when clueless liberals assume that opposition to miscegenation is a &#8220;white&#8221; thing. It&rsquo;s not, and some of the fiercest opposition is among blacks. So what&rsquo;s not to like about Jim Russell?</p>

		<p>There are interracial couples who are legitimate couples, who have every right to be together if they wish. They also have real problems associated with such a relationship. That is their business. Some get through it, and some don&rsquo;t. Many people of all races think interrracial relationships are a bad idea. I don&rsquo;t think they are all horrible racists, that is their reasonable opinion. It&rsquo;s only racist when whites have this opinion.</p>
<p> I often see liberal U.S. and UK media shoving interratcial sex down our throats. It&rsquo;s typically not a white man with a black woman, or an Asian man with a Hispanic woman, etc. It is almost always a black male dominating a white female. For example, every day on BBC America, I see promos for &#8220;Luther&#8221;. The clip shows a black man with his hand around a white woman&rsquo;s neck. The white woman appears to worship him. We all remember &#8220;Black Snake Moan&#8221;. I don&rsquo;t think any of us saw this movie, but you remember the preview. The clip showed an older black man with a half naked young white woman chained up like a dog in his yard.  The list goes on. I even see toned down versions of this on Disney programs.  It&rsquo;s meant to shock us and punish us. It&rsquo;s extremely racist, hateful, and they keep shoving it down our throats. Liberals, I hope you&rsquo;re listening. We&rsquo;ve had enough of this garbage. You can only expect our rage to explode . If the media portrayed black women with white men in these situations, the black community would be full of rage as well. We&rsquo;re no different. You keep attacking us with hatred. You can only expect the same in return. We&rsquo;re past the threshold. </p>

		<p>Jim Russell also wrote a book entitled The Germanization of Early Medieval Christianity. Sam Francis wrote a book review of it in the Occidental Quarterly. The book opened my eyes to the concept that religion will always adapt to the other cultural forms of people. The lesson for us today is that we have to appreciate that the process has become political. Politicians are involved with religion. So Christians beware, you are getting a ton of politics mixed in with your religous observances.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you openly express pro-white views, you become a non-person among most &ldquo;respectable&rdquo; whites&#8221;</p>
<p>The other day I was at my friends house. It is a shared house and there were three young lads there, all aged 18-23, all in bands and all smoking dope, the kind of young folk you would assume would care too much about their image to think about racial issues. They knew I was in the BNP, and we sat and talked through the whole night, about genetics, race, evolution, sex, women, family, equality, the whole lot. They were away from anyone who could judge them, there was no-one to shout me down, and all of them were eager to hear something other than the usual half-baked nihilistic, shallow fare served up to the young.<br>
They listened, they asked questions, they could see I was serious, and that I was informed by experience and decent values. I told them straight up I love my race and wanted white children and grandchildren. They got it. Scratch beneath the surface and you will find there is still an inherent longing for wholesomeness, decency and pride amongst most young white men. </p>
<p>I have found that the idea that you will become a pariah is just a myth put out by the media, one which too many people on this site believe. I will happily discuss this stuff with anyone. Stop being so defeatist and argue your case.<br>

		<p>As a Christian, I am aware that God separated the races for a reason.  Some people try to twist around the &#8220;there is neither Jew nor Greek&#8221; and conveniently forget that that means spiritually we&rsquo;re all the same.  Physically we are not all equal.</p>
<p>I would consider a black Christian my brother/sister in Christ, but I would never consider marrying a black Christian male for the simple reason that he&rsquo;s black and I&rsquo;m white.  </p>
<p>We need to stop being afraid of being called racists.  It&rsquo;s like being called a homophobe  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s just all mind games and manipulation.</p>

<p>    We fight because we value our people, our heritage and our future. Abject conformity would only accelerate the forces of disintegration. Nothing less than the future of America is at stake. Greater difficulties have been endured, greater struggles have been enjoined, and greater odds have been beaten in the past.

		<p>I am not surprized by the attacks on Mr.Russell or the G.O.P.&rsquo;s willingness to throw him under the bus. The situation has gotten so bad that any defence by a white is blasfamy to the holy religion of diversity, which really means the fewer whites the better. Just page through the print ads in your sunday paper or TV commericals and you will notice fewer and fewer white males are present.The fact is what is happening is the slow genicide of white males and to object to it will bring down the rage of those who wish to get rid of us.</p>

		<p>Pulling back from &#8220;diversity&#8221; is something white Americans have to be overt about doing.  Since our nation&rsquo;s political forces have forced us to integrate (only white people, everyone else is allowed to have ethnic enclaves).  One of the things that makes life pretty easy for these interlopers is language.  <br>
 <br>
Imagine if dedicated white Americans decided to start conversing in German?  Using it for trade, socializing and private education.  Imagine the kind of filter it would represent.  Germanic languages require a mindset that comes easily to white people.  It doesn&rsquo;t come so easily to others.<br>

German is a rigorous organized fairly inflected language. I like it and Latin. Know some Spanish, French, Yiddish, and Gaelic too. Find Spanish and French fairly debased and sloppy when compared to German and Latin. One of the first things I like to do when getting involved with a woman is to check out her ethnic background. Remember seeing how a certain girl in eighth grade matched up to the ideal in my mind. She had full dark hair, fair skin, and a mesomorphic build.  However one can also get expectations of what is suitable far earlier even as young as the age of 5 or so.</p>

And I also find it not too difficult to imagine that, if such a thing ever hapened, something, somehow, would quickly be done to put a stop to it.  REQUIRE them to speak English! Maybe Ebonics. Outlaw anything else. </p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t have white people getting together with other whites!  We mustn&rsquo;t have any of that stuff! Whites with other whites can be dangerous. </p>
<p>Those communities would have to be INTEGRATED! Ship in a few tribes of Sudanese and Somalis. Hottentots, Aborigines, and New Guinea natives too.  Gotta have lottsa Diversity!!!</p>

		<p>&#8220;In it, he assumed an academic tone to rail against interracial relationships of any kind, criticizing &ldquo;miscegenationist&rdquo; movies like &ldquo;Save the Last Dance&rdquo; for what he described as an attempt to &ldquo;exploit the critical period of sexual imprinting&rdquo; in impressionable young women. He argued for keeping races at a distance from one another.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Russell questioned &ldquo;how a child&rsquo;s sexual imprinting mechanism is affected by forcible racial integration and near continual exposure to media stimuli promoting interracial contact.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Bingo, Mr. Russell.   These kinds of movies and the anti-white messages that they send - are not only deliberate, but they are clearly part of a premeditated and diabolically sinister agenda to interfere with the birthing of white babies and the natural formation of healthy, stable, and cohesive white relationships between white men and white women.  And, Mr. Russell is dead on the mark - in his assertions that the prime targets of these white genocide promoting kinds of movies and Television shows are the impressionable, young white female daughters of White fathers and mothers.    Notice how loudly and hysterically that same media are screeching - over having Mr. Russell expose their evil agenda?  By screaming so loudly, they are actually admitting their guilt, people.</p>
<p>News Flash:  The mainstream media is your enemy, White Man.  The mainstream media is your enemy, White Ladies.  Those who own and control it seek your genocide and they seek to exterminate your Anglo-Saxon-Celtic or Germanic European genetic lineage.   Second News Flash:   People of European descent constitute between 8 and 10 percent of the entire world&rsquo;s population today.   That clearly means that miscegenation between that 8-10 percent, which is heartily encouraged and presented to seem &#8216;trendy and fashionable&rsquo; by the enemy controlled media, and the other 90 percent of the non-white population of the world will WITHOUT QUESTION - eventually result in the disappearance of White European people, since Whites have regressive genes and this means that they are fragile and easily overpowered by the non-white genes in any relationship between whites and non-whites.  </p>
<p>Kudos to Mr. Russell for having the guts to expose these vile and dastardly enemies of the White Western people!   And, here is a message to the anti-White GOP who seems to be fully on board with the agenda of genocide as the official policy regarding White people of European descent:   Go take a hike.   The GOP absolutely MUST be destroyed as a viable mainstream political party and the best way to achieve that objective is for their white base to wake up and understand that the GOP is their worst enemy.    Stop voting for the GOP, stop supporting the GOP, and shun these rats - because all of them carry a plague that spells the death and extermination of European people.   GOP = the White Genocide Party.  </p>

<p>Who runs the &#8220;mainstream media&#8221;?  White people?  A multicultural group of random people?  A diverse group of people tied together by a sick ideology?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s none of these.  The mainstream media is run, top to bottom, with no dissent allowed whatsoever, by a single, specific racial minority, often, directly under the control of a specific hostile foreign nation.</p>
<p>In order to even understand what is going on, let alone, effectively counter what they are doing, you MUST be willing to name this group.  Not just the group but the specific people (there are only a handful and they are hardly secretive).</p>
