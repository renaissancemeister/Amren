<h1>10 Infants Dead in California Whooping Cough Outbreak</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Miriam Falco, CNN, October 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Whooping cough, also known as pertussis, has claimed the 10th victim in California, in what health officials are calling the worst outbreak in 60 years.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the year, 5,978 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of the disease have been reported in California.</p>
<p>All of the deaths occurred in infants under the age of 3 months, says Michael Sicilia, a spokesman for the California Department of Public Health. Nine were younger than 8 weeks old, which means they were too young to have been vaccinated against this highly contagious bacterial disease.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a preventable disease,&#8221; says Sicilia, because there is a vaccine for whooping cough to protect those coming in contact with infants, and thereby protect the infants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The vaccine &#8220;does not protect you for life,&#8221; explains Alison Patti, a spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>Sicilia says California Health Department epidemiologists estimate 50 percent of the children who have gotten sick were infected by their parents or caregivers.</p>
<p>According to the recommended vaccine schedule for infants, newborns don&rsquo;t get their first pertussis vaccine until they are 2 months old, leaving them vulnerable to infection until then if the people surrounding them are infected.</p>
<p>hat&rsquo;s why the real important message is  &mdash;  whether it&rsquo;s a mom, dad, sibling, grandfather or grandmother that comes in contact with these really young babies  &mdash;  all the close contacts, including the health care professionals, need to vaccinated,&#8221; says Patti. It&rsquo;s called the &#8220;cocooning strategy,&#8221; where the newborns are protected because the older people around them have been vaccinated and protected from pertussis, and therefore won&rsquo;t pass it on to little babies.</p>
<p>Pertussis, or whooping cough, is a highly contagious disease caused by bacteria that can lead to severe upper respiratory infections. The bacteria is spread in tiny droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes.</p>
<p>Initial symptoms are very similar to a cold, but a week or two later, a violent cough develops.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&rsquo;ve ever seen a child with pertussis, you won&rsquo;t forget it&#8221;  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s how the American Academy of Pediatrics explains what whooping cough is on its website. The academy says a child with the disease coughs so hard and so often &#8220;until the air is gone from his/her lungs and he/she is forced to inhale with the loud &#8216;whooping&rsquo; sound that gives the disease its nickname.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cough can last for weeks and children can cough so hard and rapidly, that blood vessels can burst and they have difficulty eating, drinking and breathing. According to the CDC, &#8220;about 1 in 5 infants with pertussis get pneumonia, and about 1 in 100 will have convulsions. In rare cases (1 in 100), pertussis can be deadly, especially in infants.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Health officials are urging everyone who hasn&rsquo;t had a pertussis vaccine in the past five years or  &mdash;  doesn&rsquo;t remember if they had one  &mdash;  to get the shot.<br>

		<p>I had whooping cough at the age of six, and I can testify that it&rsquo;s pretty hard on its victims. </p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s see, now   &mdash;   California has a huge outbreak of what had become, since my childhood, pretty much an obsolete disease in the US.  And California is also the most thoroughly mestizified state.</p>
<p>Can there possibly be a correlation?  Not on CNN, obviously.<br>

		<p>I had pertussis as a 28yo adult and it was horrible. I literally coughed for months and would often cough until I vomited. I had been vaccinated as a child but immunities wear off. I have given my daughter all recommended vaccines because I could not face her if she got sick and I could have prevented it. My grandparents are 90 years old and have told me stories about young people dying and having permanent injuries from things like mumps, measles and polio. </p>

		<p>Another &#8220;Heirloom Disease&#8221; makes a comeback (see AmRen article from 08-31-10). </p>
<p>Notice how they don&rsquo;t dare mention how whooping cough made a resurgence. Not surprising it&rsquo;s California. It has been pretty easy to figure out from the commercials all over TV urging people to get the vaccine - the woman and infant both look hispanic.</p>
<p>But actually TELL the hispanics to go get vaccinated! Why, that&rsquo;s RACIAL PROFILING! How lame. We have the inmates running the institution. </p>

		<p>I got whooping cough when I was working with Mexicans.  The doctor said he&rsquo;d never seen a case before, but he&rsquo;d read that it was coming back.  It lasted three months, and several times I nearly suffocated.  Thanks, Diversity.</p>

		<p>@Obongo,</p>
<p>You win a prize.  I wish I could remember the URL of the CDC report, but the vast majority of infants and all the infant deaths thus far are Latino.  If you look at the graph, there is this huge spike with infant Latinos, and then the different age groups vs. ethnicity/race groups after that tend to balance out as proportional to the population.</p>
<p>The news likes to imply that the spike is tied to soccer moms not vaccinating their kids because that seems to be a trend at the moment, but other data shows that the number of kids who&rsquo;s parents have opted out of vaccinations is very, very small. A quick look at the graph by an objective eye is a textbook example of the Law of Parsimony.</p>

		<p>I know that vaccinations are controversial with many people, but&hellip;</p>
<p>Back in the late 1990s, I lived in an apartment house in Glendale, California, surrounded by immigrants of mostly Armenian and Hispanic background.  I don&rsquo;t know what percentage of them were vaccinated. </p>
<p>There was an outbreak of something with symptoms similar to whooping cough.  Little kids got over it in two weeks.  However, in adults (like me) it kept lingering for a couple of months.  </p>
<p>I went to the ER three times with little if any help.  Biaxin (expensive, newer antibiotic) did not help at all.  Erythromycin (cheaper, older antibiotic) helped only a little bit. </p>
<p>I was told by an ER doc that it might be &#8220;viral whooping cough.&#8221;  One rude ER doc told me it wasn&rsquo;t possible to break a rib with coughing, but an ER nurse told me that it WAS. </p>
<p>At any rate, I had horrible coughing, complete with near-vomiting on several occasions and trouble catching my breath.  I drank so much cough syrup that I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s when I tipped over into diabetes. </p>
<p>Luckily for me I had a job I could do at home, or I wouldn&rsquo;t have had a job at all.  I was mostly over it after about two months, but lesser effects lingered for much longer. </p>

		<p>My parents grew up during the depression and whooping cough was one of those dread diseases (along with polio) that public health officials hadn&rsquo;t quite taken care of in that era. However, I would imagine most baby boomers and the subsequent (white) generations would not have to worry about this affliction. </p>
<p>Give it a few years and we may well be back to a time when children suffered from rickets. Cholera and leprosy may also make a return, especially if the Chinese stop funding our debt and welfare as we know it runs into a brick wall.  </p>
<p>Why are we surprised to see third world diseases when we have large numbers of people from the third world showing up on our doorstep? If someone went back in time to the early 1800&rsquo;s and brought a bunch of Americans forward to 2010, we would probably be appalled at the level of disease and lack of hygiene. Your wife, girlfriend, etc. would shudder at the thought of talking to a woman who started having children at 15 and 7 of her 12 survived to adulthood. No C-sections or anesthesia down on the farm, either. While most of our ancestors would appreciate modern appliances, they would be horrified by how fat we are now and how much we have lost our way spiritually, politically, and economically. I doubt Lady GaGa would amuse them. </p>
<p>Speaking of the cut off of debt funding, great video. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a strange suggestion.  Instead of giving the child the vaccination when its born, wait two months and make sure every single human being that comes in contact with the child is vaccinated.  An awfully faulty method that isn&rsquo;t sure to protect the child, if someone who isn&rsquo;t vaccinated comes in contact with it.</p>
<p>I also had whooping cough a lot when I was younger.  My grandmother always told me how it had worried her so much, which I didn&rsquo;t understand because I had no idea it was deadly 1 in 100 cases.</p>
<p>I certainly hope and pray that this epidemic of pertussis is taken care of.</p>

		<p>This article is extremely misleading.</p>
<p>If you look at cases of whooping cough, the overwhelming majority occur among those who have been vaccinated.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t make sense until you understand the nature of vaccination.  Most people have been lied to and told that vaccination makes it impossible for an individual to get a disease.  There are certain diseases that is true for but the majority it is not.  In fact, it will not even reduce the probability of an individual getting that disease if exposed.</p>
<p>So, why vaccinate?  Because vaccination of a POPULATION (not an individual) reduces the incidence of that disease in a population.  The POPULATION, not the individual, benefits.</p>
<p>However, vaccinations are not cost free procedures (in terms of health I mean).  Any time a person has any medical procedure&hellip;.and this is extremely common in vaccination, there is the probability of something going wrong.  Usually its minor&hellip;.pain, fever, swelling, whatever.  But occasionally, it&rsquo;s major&hellip;..ummm, death.</p>
<p>My point is there is a direct conflict of interest between society and the individual with regard to vaccination.  And, under the US system (supposedly), the rights and well being of the individual takes precedence.  As opposed to say, china, where, if some wandering policeman with a thermometer detects that you have a fever, you are handcuffed, thrown in the back of a van, and forcibly treated, if you like it or not, for the good of society&hellip;..and any complications (even death) you may have are just your tough luck and you have no rights.</p>
<p>To imply that a group doesn&rsquo;t get vaccinated because they just can&rsquo;t be bothered to, is misleading.  Most who don&rsquo;t get vaccinated, REFUSE vaccination&hellip;.and for good reason.  And they have a RIGHT to refuse.  At least in the US (a right that is, more and more, being nipped away at).  <br>

		<p>To Howard W: Campbell: I believe there was a Federal law passed in the 19th century that said something like: &#8220;No person with a contagious or loathsome disease shall be admitted entry to the Unites States.&#8221; I don&rsquo;t know if that law is still on the books, but we don&rsquo;t seem to be enforcing it if it is!</p>

		<p>I caught pertussis as a 31 year-old graduate student at UNSW in Sydney.  I coughed for three months, and frequently vomited.  Like the other posters here, I was absolutely miserable.  Either my childhood vaccine had worn off or the strain of the disease I caught was sufficiently different from the one I had been vaccinated against.  The &#8220;cocooning effect&#8221; mentioned above is correct, but our imports of huge numbers of ignorant Third-World immigrants (as well as a handful of white anti-vaccine wingnuts) are handicapping it.  Imagine the vulnerability of a society (coming soon to a black and brown USA) in which only about half of the population is vaccinated.<br>

		<p>If you read some of the studies they have put out (yes, I know the family are not popular here but the Robert Kennedy site has one really good one), there is a lot of reason to question exactly what is being done to our children.</p>
<p>And has been, for decades.</p>
<p>Methylated Mercury was known to cause brain problems when the guy who was asked to certify it back in 1931 said _NO_.  This for a sterilant that did -not- completely kill off the huge numbers of secondary antigens that were usually cultured along with the desired one.</p>
<p>It took another 50+ years for it to leave the American medical system (it may still be going to Africa), Communist Russia got rid of the stuff in the 50s and Europe in the 70s.</p>
<p>And then there are the ages and types administered.  There for awhile, they were practically taking kids from their mother&rsquo;s arms and running them off to a backroom to give them, get this, _Hep C_ vaccinations.  Little kids, less than 24hrs old have _no need_ to worry about Hep C unless their parents are deep into drugs or some other problem.</p>
<p>Finally, there are the total load densities and the popularity of the singleshot cocktail.  There for awhile in the U.S. back in the 90s we were putting as much as 45 antigens into our children in a period of just a few months.</p>
<p>Which is NOT how the immune system is designed to work.  Your skin is an envelope for keeping just massive quantities of genetic contaminants out of your inner systems.  Punch a bunch of &#8216;dead&rsquo; microbes beyond that protective layer and you risk all kinds of complications.</p>
<p>Which is why autism and they think ADHD spiked like mad in particularly young males in that time.</p>
<p>The CDC are a paramilitary organization.  Every one of them are ranked and serviced.  Their powers are mighty and their view of the world is only as neutral as the people who control them.  IMO, half of what is wrong with our society derives from a deliberate social-engineering-by-genetic-decree effort that has been put in place to make whites into brain dead, self-effacing, retards.  And vaccines are certainly one way to make that happen.</p>
<p>Like Fluoride in the water.</p>
<p>The real question is how bad it is.  And how long it&rsquo;s been going on.  Because that will let you start to think about how many more decades advanced the government awareness of genetic and epigenetic effects of certain bioactive agents is.  If they have 40 years of lead coming out of biowarfare work done in the 60s and 70s, I doubt seriously if whatever they have done is &#8216;fixable&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If nothing else, the big question you have to ask is why import the third world to cure it with our health system?  MMR vaccinations are actually working in places like Nigeria.  And those who are most at risk to immediate infection should be the ones who are &#8216;cocooned&rsquo; with the consequences of necessary vaccination programs.  It makes no sense whatsoever to take a relatively clean evironment, vaccinate an imported white population free of endemeic European diseases and then REINTRODUCE those diseases (and others) from all over the planet.</p>

		<p>I find myself making the same statements about vaccines over and over again, but I&rsquo;m still game:</p>
<p>&#8220;Methylated mercury&#8221; was never added to vaccines.  The antiseptic compound formerly used in vaccines was thimerosal.  Only very small amounts of it were required, because it is far more potent than phenol, which had previously been used.  Thimerosal is metabolized into ethylmercury (not methylmercury), which has a short half-life in mammals of something like 18 days.  What completely blows the &#8220;mercury in our kids&rsquo; vaccines&#8221; Chicken Little hysteria out of the water is that the use of thimerosal in vaccines was discontinued in mid-2001.  That&rsquo;s right.  If your kid is younger than nine years of age, he or she was never exposed to thimerosal in vaccines.</p>
<p>Thimerosal was accused of causing autism by some remarkably unknowledgeable folks; the real reason for an increase in autism rates is that in the late 1990s what constitutes &#8220;autism&#8221; was drastically widened.  For instance, they have redefined the very mild situation known as Asperger&rsquo;s Syndrome as a variety of &#8220;autism&#8221;, which lumps somewhat asocial but completely functional people in with full-blown dysfunctional autistics.  Obviously, if we let the medical community define &#8220;autism&#8221; broadly enough, they can produce any rate of &#8220;autism&#8221; that they want.<br>

		<p>At least 40 years ago my grandmother worked at the Baptist Hospital in Memphis (the largest private Hospital in the world at the time, I think).<br>
She was a lowly receptionist and heard a boy coughing.When the boy was being examined by a young doctor he did not know what it was.The nurse said that Mrs. Malone said it was the Whooping Cough.This disease was virtually uknown in this country for 50 years&hellip;.and bedbugs&hellip;etc.<br>
I hope the children of our elites get this disease. Maybe they will question thier dogmas. </p>

<p>Babies, less than 24 hours old are given the Hep B vaccine, not Hep C  &mdash;  and I agree with you that this vaccine should not be given to babies with their under-developed immune systems and little/no chance of contracting Hep B.</p>
<p>NewsMax&rsquo;s Dr. Blaylock reports:</p>
<p><i>In the US, the Hepatitis B disease mainly infects intravenous drug users, homosexuals, prostitutes and promiscuous heterosexuals. The disease is transmitted by blood, through sex or dirty needles. How could a newborn baby possibly get Hepatitis B if the mother was screened and tested negative?&hellip;. It is widely recognized that newborns have underdeveloped immune systems, which can be overwhelmed or shocked..</i></p>
<p>And this, about the flu vaccine (Aug 2009) in <i>Vaccines and Brain Injury, Are You At Risk?</i></p>
<p><i>The flu vaccines contain a full dose of mercury (as thimerosal) as well as dangerous immune stimulators (called adjuvants). Virtually all neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, are triggered and <br>
worsened by chronic brain inflammation.</i></p>
<p>Keep an open mind about vaccines and brain injuries:</p>
<p><i>Why did the government refuse researchers access to vaccine-damage data (VAERS  &mdash;  Vaccine Averse Events Reporting System) and only yielded the data when forced to by a Freedom of Information lawsuit?</i> </p>
<p><i> Why did the Department of Defense shroud complications of the anthrax vaccine in top secret files until forced to release it? The clandestine files showed that the vaccine caused a 200 percent increase in ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) or Lou Gehrig&rsquo;s disease. </i></p>

<p>My daughter had an adverse reaction to the MMR vaccination; I won&rsquo;t go into detail here, but she had to be hospitalized because of that particular shot.  The HMO allergist told me that virulent strains of measles are being imported into the US from East Asia via immigrants, otherwise he would not recommend the MMR &#8216;inoculation&rsquo; (if that is indeed what it is).  What I learned about MMR after that scared the daylights out of me.  </p>

		<p>Vaccination DID cut down on disease rates, Alexandra.  The proper sanitation you mention was actually instrumental in changing the epidemiology of some diseases from mild, chronic childhood infections into severe, life-threatening diseases among adults.   Mumps, for instance is not a terrible threat to children, but a very serious problem if you catch it as an adult - effects can include meningitis and testicular atrophy.  Before the introduction of the vaccine, mumps was the leading cause of viral meningitis in the US.  Polio didn&rsquo;t become a major threat in the USA, for example until the early 20th century, and it hit middle-class families harder than poor slum-dwellers.  Polio crippled FDR as an adult, and he was from a very wealthy, prominent family who were presumably educated well enough to practice good personal hygiene.  He was lucky to avoid life in an iron lung.  A very good read on the subject is &#8220;Man and Microbes,&#8221; by Aarno Kaarlen.</p>
<p>The polio vaccine has made the disease extinct, and smallpox, which devastated populations around the world at various times is nearly so, also do to a vaccine.  Of course, diseases that have animal reservoirs or which mutate very easily (think colds, flu and HIV) will always be problematical.  The thrust of vaccination and epidemiology tends far mor toward managing the problem than eradicating it.<br>
