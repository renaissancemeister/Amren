<h1>Two State Supreme Court Justices Stun Some Listeners With Race Comments</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Miletich, Seattle Times, October 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>State Supreme Court justices Richard Sanders and James Johnson stunned some participants at a recent court meeting when they said African Americans are overrepresented in the prison population because they commit a disproportionate number of crimes.</p>
<p>Both justices disputed the view held by some that racial discrimination plays a significant role in the disparity.</p>
<p>Johnson also used the term &#8220;poverty pimp,&#8221; an apparent reference to people who purportedly exploit the poor in the legal system, say those who attended the meeting.</p>
<p>Sanders later confirmed his remarks about imprisoned African Americans, saying &#8220;certain minority groups&#8221; are &#8220;disproportionally represented in prison because they have a crime problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s right,&#8221; he told The Seattle Times this week. &#8220;I think that&rsquo;s obvious.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>African Americans represent about 4 percent of Washington&rsquo;s population but nearly 20 percent of the state prison population. Similar disparities nationwide have been attributed by some researchers to sentencing practices, inadequate legal representation, drug-enforcement policies and criminal-enforcement procedures that unfairly affect African Americans.</p>
<p>Some who attended the meeting say they were offended by the justices&rsquo; remarks, saying the comments showed a lack of knowledge and sensitivity.</p>
<p>Kitsap County District Court Judge James Riehl, who attended the meeting, said he was &#8220;stunned&#8221; because, as a trial judge for 28 years, he was &#8220;acutely aware&#8221; of barriers to equal treatment in the legal system.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Shirley Bondon, an AOC manager who oversees programs to remove barriers in the legal system, said that during the discussion she told the justices that she believed there was racial &#8220;bias in the criminal-justice system, from the bottom up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bondon, 50, who is African American, said Sanders told others to turn to a page in the report that listed barriers to the justice system, including age, race, disability and other factors.</p>
<p>Sanders asked for the name of anyone who was in prison because of one of the barriers, according to Bondon and others who attended the meeting.</p>
<p>Sanders also stated that he didn&rsquo;t believe the barriers existed, except for poverty because it might restrict the ability to afford an attorney, Bondon said.</p>
<p>Ada Shen-Jaffe, the Seattle University participant, responded that she didn&rsquo;t have names but could provide research, Bondon and Riehl said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sanders, in an interview, said he replied with words to the effect that maybe prison statistics reflect crimes that were committed.</p>
<p>After Sanders&rsquo; remark, Johnson said he agreed, noting that African Americans commit them against their own communities, Bondon said.</p>
<p>Bondon said she told Johnson that was unacceptable and that she didn&rsquo;t believe that to be true.</p>
<p>Johnson then remarked that he believed some people are taken advantage of, and in connection with that, used the term &#8220;poverty pimp,&#8221; Bondon said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Justice Debra Stephens said she heard Sanders and Johnson make the comments, including Johnson using the words &#8220;you all&#8221; or &#8220;you people&#8221; when he stated that African Americans commit crimes in their own communities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bondon said she remembered thinking that she didn&rsquo;t need data or statistics to prove that she and other African Americans don&rsquo;t have a predisposition for criminality.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the idea that it was necessary to disprove the assertion was sickening,&#8221; Bondon said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sanders, in an interview, said he has a reputation for standing up for those accused of crimes but that he hasn&rsquo;t seen evidence that African Americans are disproportionately imprisoned because of race.</p>
<p>He said his concern was for &#8220;individuals,&#8221; and that if someone is in prison for any reason other than committing the crime, &#8220;I want to hear about it.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;offended&#8221; by the truth spoken openly</p>
<p>&#8220;stunned&#8221; that anyone dare fight back against the carefully constructed liberal court system</p>
<p>Bondon could not bring herself to believe that &#8220;her people&#8221; actually were in prison for committing crimes.  My, the brainwashing has been intense.</p>
<p>The best line was this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Sanders asked for the name of anyone who was in prison because of one of the barriers, according to Bondon and others who attended the meeting.&#8221;</p>
<p>And no one could provide a name.</p>

<p>I wonder what would happen to these people if someone pointed out water was wet. I suppose they&rsquo;d have a heart attack.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to read that Sanders stood by his remarks when confronted by the Seattle Times. </p>
<p>This guy seems tough enough to withstand the backlash but others before him have caved into less.</p>

<p>I doubt that very many of those present were &#8220;stunned.&#8221;  This is no more than typical governmedia scaremongering, trying to convince the <i>Seattle Times</i> readership that common sense is Evil Racism, about which they should feel &#8220;stunned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Excellent work, Comrade Steve Miletich! <i>Pravda</i> lives again!<br>

		<p>&#8220;Sanders, in an interview, said he has a reputation for standing up for those accused of crimes but that he hasn&rsquo;t seen evidence that African Americans are disproportionately imprisoned because of race.</p>
<p>&#8220;He said his concern was for &ldquo;individuals,&rdquo; and that if someone is in prison for any reason other than committing the crime, &ldquo;I want to hear about it.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>In the early 70s, in upstate New York, I worked for a Public Defenders Office  which provided first-class representation for those accused of misdemeanors AND felonies, who could not afford to hire private attorneys. That program, still in effect at local taxpayers&rsquo; expense, has employed some of the best criminal defense and appellate lawyers around, many of whom stayed on for years, and did not go into private practice.  The office was and is highly respected by judges and others lawyers alike.</p>
<p>When I worked there, as both an investigator and law clerk, I saw for the first time not only that most (not all) violent criminals were black, but that, especially in crimes of sexual violence, the bulk ( close to 95%) involved non-white perps and white victims. The County at that time had less than 20% minority population, but the minority participation in violent criminality was easily 80%.  That was 40 years ago, and nothing much has changed, except there are now more murders.</p>

		<p>Wow, Bondon is so accustomed to her superiority stance that she tells a judge his opinion is unacceptable.  </p>
<p>All I can say is  it is about time judges voiced common sense.  Without a doubt blacks commit a disproportionate number of crimes.  And in the case of interracial rape the stats go off the chart.</p>
<p>It is Bondon and Stephens that are being racial and accusatory.</p>

		<p>These guys are toast.  Frankly I can&rsquo;t believe they had the spine to say that here in the Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Washington.  They&rsquo;re going to be run off of the bench and out of the state on a rail.  Washington state Obama approval is still up around 50%.  This place is a nest of die-hard true-believers.</p>
<p>I especially love this gem:</p>
<p>&#8220;Bondon said she remembered thinking that she didn&rsquo;t need data or statistics to prove that she and other African Americans don&rsquo;t have a predisposition for criminality.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well of course she doesn&rsquo;t think she needs evidence when she makes statements that are 180 degrees opposite the facts on the ground, demonstrated time and again in every state in the US and indeed the world over.  </p>
<p>The race hustlers, anti-smoking zealots, eco-lunatics, none of these people are accustomed to the expectation that they provide real bonafide evidence to back up their outlandish claims.  These folks are used to being able to say whatever they feel, comfortable that the pseudo-intellectual leftist establishment will circle the wagons around them and fire volleys of &#8220;RACIST! FEAR-MONGER! FLAT-EARTHER!&#8221; at any who dare to dissent from the leftist narrative.</p>

		<p>The blacks will keep voting for the same corrupted politicians over and over.  They live in a reality different from the whites and Asians.  Africa will never change only regress if blacks are left on their own.  Instead of acknowledging that there are serious problems within the black community, they always point fingers at everyone/everything else.  Must be in the genes, Obama appears to be doing the same, always lecturing and blaming others for his failures.  So the blacks did not commit these crimes, poverty, and ignorance made them do it?  After 50+ years of affirmative action and billions and billions of wasted taxpayers&rsquo; money, the blacks are worse than before the 60&rsquo;s.  At least, there were less teen pregnancies, more of a family unit with a father around.</p>

		<p>What have this country come to?  When blacks do not like to hear the truth, use the race card.  Some clueless whites actually believe this garbage and have allowed it to continue for over 50 years.  This nonsense have not helped the blacks nor this country.  It has made the solving of racial problems much more difficult.  Blacks cannot be given things without earning it, no mutual respect.  These two men were very brave and honest to point out the obvious.</p>

		<p>It is wonderful to hear of liberals being on the wrong side of the fact that judges are appointed for life and removable only for the most heinous offenses. And at present, referring to a particular group of people as &ldquo;those people&rdquo; is not quite legally actionable. </p>
<p>The judges will be reviled by all proper herd people, but they cannot be removed, even in the U.S. And since the judges can rise no higher than supreme court judge, they can&rsquo;t be denied a promotion because there are no more promotions. </p>
<p>I think they got away with it!<br>

		<p>Another biased news story from the very first sentence.</p>
<p>Compare</p>
<p><i>State Supreme Court justices Richard Sanders and James Johnson stunned some participants at a recent court meeting&hellip;</i></p>
<p>with</p>
<p><i>Some participants at a recent court meeting claimed they were &#8220;stunned&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>See the difference there? The first sentence takes hysterical overreactions at face value while the second one doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You can be sure that scare quotes would have been used if whites said they were offended by something that blacks did.</p>
<p>Also, as usual, liberals use &#8220;bait and switch&#8221; argumentation. Usually they claim that more blacks commit crime because of &#8220;poverty.&#8221; When that argument doesn&rsquo;t work they claim that a higher percentage of blacks are in prison because of a racist criminal justice system.  Apparently innocent blacks are being imprisoned, while guilty whites go free. The argument seems absurd when put that way, and it is.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s no evidence of <i>unfairness in policies</i> in the courts toward minorities. Further, the courts bend over backwards to allow access by the poor. So what about arrests? If the claim is police arrest more minorities than is justified (resulting in increased incarceration rates for blacks), I&rsquo;d point out local crimes are very well advertised, as are any arrests made. Anyone paying attention can see the races involved in the bulk of the crimes. Proof of discrimination &#8220;by statistic and computer modeling&#8221; pales in comparison to observing reality in person.</p>
<p>If the arrests are being fairly made, and if the courts are fairly imposing judgments based on those arrests, what&rsquo;s left that justifies a higher incarceration rate for blacks? Regardless of the cause for this, the very <i>fact</i> of an obviously high crime rate in the black community should overwhelm any discussion of the subject. </p>

		<p>I worked in a crime lab as a Latent Print Examiner in S.Florida for almost 30 years. I also worked with AFIS (Automated Fingerprint Identification System). I would enter unknown fingerprints developed from crime scenes ranging from homicides to burglaries into the system. I would say a conservative estimate of the latent fingerprints that I identified to known fingerprints on file, seven out of ten people positively identified as being the perpetrator were black, with the other three being made up of mostly whites and hispanics/latinos.</p>
<p>I was in a unique position to actually see the makeup of crime by race. And I would tell Bondon that what the Justices said were statements based on fact, not bias. The black community does commit, nation wide, a disproportionate amount of crime, especially when you look at the percentage of blacks per population. Blacks at the time made up about 13% of our population.</p>
<p>Since it&rsquo;s as plain as the nose on our face, just how and why did it become politically incorrect to state the obvious? I was told all through my career to not talk about the race component, like it was a dirty secret that if said would reflect badly - ON ME!</p>
<p>The liberal agenda of suppressing the truth and spreading lies in its place has done great damage to this country. And it is about time that the sane people of our population just start talking the truth. Yes, you have to be careful. Liberal, self-hating whites are everywhere and will stop at nothing to perpetuate the myth that we are all equal in this &#8220;rainbow utopia&#8221;. Black people also makeup a disproportionate number of these type of liars.</p>
<p>I applaud these Judges for telling the truth.  </p>

		<p>Just turned on the local news.  The hair-trigger of righteous indignation has been tripped.  Ken Schram of KOMO 4 is appalled at the &#8220;profound ignorance&#8221; of these &#8220;so-called educated men&#8221; in the face of &#8220;facts.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Must be the same &#8220;facts&#8221; and &#8220;research&#8221; that was compiled on prisoners who cannot be named by Ada Shen-Jaffe of Seattle University, another Communist Jesuit institution.</p>
<p>Of course we can&rsquo;t hear these &#8220;facts.&#8221;  Shirley Bondon doesn&rsquo;t feel she needs to provide them.</p>
<p>I want out of this place SO BADLY.  The East Coast and California liberals who fled here from their self-imposed gulags 20 years ago just rolled up their sleeves and built the same socialist nightmare here.  Of course they can&rsquo;t figure out how it happened.  They&rsquo;d open their veins before they&rsquo;d vote conservative though.  These are the so-called &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; of our nation.  Can&rsquo;t even understand cause-and-effect.</p>
<p>Sorry for the double rant tonight it&rsquo;s just getting really frustrating living under the White liberal commisars here in what used to be a nice clean place to live before it became Mogadishu-Tijuana-Soviet Moscow.</p>

		<p>Black crime and violence is observable without going to statistics.  Anyone growing up around blacks knows this all too well.</p>
<p>The police know it as well.  So do the judges, unless it&rsquo;s the liberal weenies who refuse to admit it and declare the system biased.</p>
<p>Instead of calling for more control over black crime and violence, these dork whites and black retards try to convince anyone who will listen blacks go to prison for doing the same thing whites aren&rsquo;t punished for.</p>
<p>This encourages black crime by failing to hold them accountable for cleaning up their acts.</p>
<p>This empire doesn&rsquo;t deserve to carry on.  It&rsquo;s just to corrupt with liars and blacks and black liars.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad this empire is on the way out.</p>

		<p> Latest entry in the &#8220;Well, DUUH!&#8221; category of news stories. Of course blacks commit a disproportionate number of the crimes in any community. That that is true has been demonstrated so often by the statistics that it shouldn&rsquo;t be questioned by anyone who knows anything about crime. But it is, in the U.S., still, in the 21st Century.</p>
<p> Those who can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t face the facts, will still, 1,000 years hence, be blaming &#8220;White racism,&#8221; or words to that effect, for the shortcomings of blacks. Those who condemn we people who don&rsquo;t agree with them, for being &#8220;prejudiced,&#8221; hold onto their own prejudices like a dog worrying a bone.</p>
<p> Next there will be calls for both judges to resign; wait and see. </p>

		<p>Whoopie!  Someone in the courts FINALLY stands up to liberal lies, and the liberals are left speechless.  &#8220;Uh&hellip;we don&rsquo;t need proof&hellip; To merely suggest this is sickening!&#8221;  Well if it makes you sick lady then why don&rsquo;t you just leave.</p>
<p>This is really quite amazing.  I mean, first O&rsquo;Reilley and Williams stand up to Moslems, and now members of the judicial system are standing up to the wild assertion that blacks do not commit more crime than whites.  I&rsquo;m kind of surprise the liberals were so upset, actually.  Asserting that blacks commit more crimes because they&rsquo;re violent is one thing, but simply stating that they commit more crimes, period?  I didnt know that was so offensive.  But still, I&rsquo;m so glad to hear someone just flat-out say it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Similar disparities nationwide have been attributed by some researchers to sentencing practices, inadequate legal representation, drug-enforcement policies and criminal-enforcement procedures that unfairly affect African Americans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Um, isn&rsquo;t this basically supporting what the judges said?  Drag-law enforcement leads to more blacks going to jail - doesn&rsquo;t that mean they DO break the law (at least drug laws) more often?  And what do they mean when they say that &#8220;inadequate legal representation&#8221; leads to more blacks going to jail?  Legal representation has nothing to do with race, it has everything to do with income.  The poor, of whatever race, cannot afford good lawyers.  And the poor also commit nearly all crime,s so this wouldn&rsquo;t result in blacks being five times more likely to go to prison than their population levels suggest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bondon said she remembered thinking that she didn&rsquo;t need data or statistics to prove that she and other African Americans don&rsquo;t have a predisposition for criminality.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right&hellip;I believe the burden of proof in on you, lady, because history, common sense, and the fact that blacks are over-represented in prisons, all suggest that &#8220;you people&#8221; DO have a dispensation for violence.  Unless you can prove otherwise, this is a fact that cannot be denied.</p>

		<p>Well, there actually IS &#8220;bias in the criminal-justice system, from the bottom up&#8221;.</p>
<p>When you correct for severity of the crime, blacks are convicted LESS often and to lower sentences (except for property crimes, where there is approximate parity) even by all-white juries. To no one´s particular surprise, the disparity is greatest when the jury and the perp are black and the victim is white (source: The Sentencing Project, i.e. not exactly the K).</p>
<p>In other words, everybody is already feverishly at work at &#8220;balancing&#8221; the system, even in the face of reality (i.e. Affirmative Action, Obama´s one lasting legacy in Chicago - if dere be too many murderer and rapist bruthas you bedda not spit onna sidewalk, cracker).</p>
<p>The final nail in the coffin of Marxist egalitarianism in criminal justice was driven in by Lagriffedulion (inspired by &#8220;The Color of Crime&#8221;) and his analysis of &#8220;incarceration ratio&#8221; (i.e. the relative probability that a given black or white is in the slammer) versus &#8220;incarceration threshold&#8221; (i.e. the severity of crime above which you no longer get probation).</p>
<p>- According to lib theory, the problem is bucktoothed judges married to their cousins who make moonshine on weekends. If only we could raise the threshold by, say, more lib judges or decriminalizing things like petty drug possession, the disparity would vanish. This is what the libs are still preaching: If we raise the incarceration threshold, the incarceration ratio will drop (under the assumption that blacks - especially yoofs - are unfairly targeted for petty crimes).</p>
<p>- Unfortunately, the exact opposite is the case. Incarceration ratio is lowest in the most backwoods, hanging-judge districts (though nowhere below about 5) and in Detroit and DC it routinely tops 30. NONE of the lib explanations accounts for that. La Griffe gives a first approximation of separate white and black best-fit normal distributions on an arbitrary criminality scale, with the black having a higher mean but lower standard deviation.(translation into non-mathematical terms: Blacks are more criminal and more violent, and they are more homogeneous in their criminality; more liberal justice will only make matters worse, because the more hideous the crime, the higher the proportion of black perps)</p>
<p>- I know this isn´t going to sway those who spent math classes discovering their sexuality (like Ms. Bondon, I suppose) but it´s good enough for me.<br>
NOTE: I know the assumption of a normal distribution is crude, but it makes the math easier. Strong recent evidence from Britain seems to show that at least the white population is strongly bimodal, i.e. consists of separate criminals and noncriminals, with very little in-between, i.e. at least two separate distributions again.</p>
<p>Once you get started &hellip;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Similar disparities nationwide have been attributed by some researchers to sentencing practices, inadequate legal representation, drug-enforcement policies and criminal-enforcement procedures that unfairly affect African Americans&#8221;.</p>
<p>Yet other statistics, that apparently must be &#8216;racist&rsquo; - because they are not mentioned by this report, other statistics (federal crime victim surveys) show that African Americans commit more crime than they are arrested for. That whites who commit crimes are more likely to be caught. And the conclusion in this case would be that the criminal justice system is biased against whites, but no one seems to care about white criminals. </p>

		<p>I had an annoying college professor a couple years ago who blamed racism for the fact more blacks were in prison.  (In fact she supported even muslims extremists and other non-white and non-Christian &#8216;victims&rsquo;.)  Everyone in the room gave the usual &#8216;poverty&rsquo; or your typical brainwashed, self-hating modern anti-white arguments.  I flat out said, &#8220;They are in prison more because they commit more violent crimes.  Check out FBI statistics.  Other minority groups, like Asians, for example, don&rsquo;t have the same imprisonment rates and they are half the population in the US that blacks are.&#8221;  </p>
<p><br>
I could tell she didn&rsquo;t like that answer, but I don&rsquo;t care then and I don&rsquo;t care now.  Not going to let someone manipulate members of my race to feel sorry or ashamed of who they are.  Not going to let someone blame my people for the faults and failures of blacks, hispanics, etc.  Tired of being told an entire race is responsible for how every individual of another race turns out.  Isn&rsquo;t that &#8216;racist&rsquo;?  This is why I hate liberal, and especially the feel-good self-hating ones like my instructor.  They really get on my nerves!</p>

<p>This is why the FBI does something called a national crime victim survey every year to accompany its uniform crime report.  They want to survey crime victims about a lot of things, the race of their perpetrators included, and check them against racial arrest statistics.  They want to find police bias.  But virtually every year, there is either no disparity, or a slight under-arrest rate for blacks.</p>
<p>19 No Kangaroos:</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re so right about rural hanging judges.  It&rsquo;s so endemic in Missouri that some state legislators are trying to pass state laws to raise what you term the &#8220;incarceration threshold,&#8221; to set statewide standards, so that a state prison slot isn&rsquo;t taken up by a 17-year old caught with a half-ounce of weed for the first time out in Podunkville, filling up space that should be taken by a 17-year old first time armed robber in St. Louis City.  (20% of first time armed robbers in St. Louis City get no prison time).  IOW, those state legislators are telling the rural hanging judges and hanging juries that if they want to be so tough, then they should pay the expense in their own county jails.</p>
<p>Part of the reason why the threshold is so high in black areas is that the cops are spending most of their time dealing with the most serious felonies to chase down any old young person with a little bit of weed.</p>
<p>I do agree, though, that if you&rsquo;re white and in an urban area, your behavior better be purer than the wind driven snow and the Wife of Caesar combined, because in fear of &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; accusations and NAACP lawsuits, the cops will arrest whites for anything they can.  Actual prosecution might not follow, (unless the prosecutor&rsquo;s office also has the same fears), but your life will be a living hell until then.</p>

		<p>There is nothing as shocking to a liberal as being smacked in the face with the truth. Blacks begin their criminal careers as children and by the time they are adults they are well into criminality. Blacks are seldom imprisoned on their first felony conviction. Watch &#8220;48 Hours&#8221;, &#8220;America&rsquo;s Most Wanted&#8221;, &#8220;Crime 360&#8221;,most criminals in these TV shows are black or Hispanic and most are already on police files with prior convictions and charges and some are on warrants for their arrests and some are actually already imprisoned and all the detectives have to do is interview them at where they are imprisoned. <br>
The liberals have made telling the truth a crime. <br>

		<p>&#8220;Also, as usual, liberals use &ldquo;bait and switch&rdquo; argumentation. Usually they claim that more blacks commit crime because of &ldquo;poverty.&rdquo; When that argument doesn&rsquo;t work they claim that a higher percentage of blacks are in prison because of a racist criminal justice system. Apparently innocent blacks are being imprisoned, while guilty whites go free. The argument seems absurd when put that way, and it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>How can you say that!!! For God&rsquo;s sake man watch TV; CSI, Law and Order, NCIS, Blue Bloods! There ARE no Black criminals. All the murderers, rapists, muggers are White. Blacks are the police chiefs, prosecutors, medical examiners, judges and senators (unless it&rsquo;s a crooked senator then he/she is White).<br>

		<p>Most attorneys who are white, which still is most lawyers, know these honest judges are right. Blacks do crime, they do time. But most lawyers don&rsquo;t even try cases,let alone try criminal cases. They are in prosperous business and estate-related work, or in tort liabilty, for or against business. Criminal lawyers  of any race for the most part would agree privately with the judges, but have a self-interest to blame the white racist system for Lamar or Du&rsquo;quan&rsquo;s frequent arrests and incarcerations. When white business and corporate lawyers and their influential clients realize that a capitalist system cannot survive anarchy in the schools and in the streets, and that mass arrests, long-term incarceration and expanded use of the death penalty are needed to stabilize a society lurching towards anarchy, you&rsquo;ll see more judicial and legal realism. Until then, the few courageous voices of sanity in the legal profession will be quieted, by censure and disbarment if necessary. Lawyers are often fiscal conservatives(their clients) and social liberals(pretend you&rsquo;re in it for the &#8220;public interest&#8221;). Thus the trial lawyers are far bigger contributors to liberal Democrats than the big bad reactionary Chamber of Commerce is to Reactionary Tea Party types.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re white, and driving in the inner-city neighborhood where you live, the assumption is you might be there to buy drugs. If there is a black woman in the car, the assumption can be she may be a prostitute. The police do not fear whites as much nor do they fear &#8216;civil rights workers&rsquo; who are acting on behalf of white causes nor do they fear a charge of &#8216;racism&rsquo; for pulling you over. This may seem funny, but after &#8216;Jeffrey Dahlmer&rsquo; was arrested (after several missed chances to get him apparently) police seemed even more intent than every to get to the bottom of any call involving white citizens. There wasn&rsquo;t anyone questioning &#8216;profiling&rsquo; or calling for &#8216;sensitivity&rsquo; or urging that we fight against unfair &#8216;stereotypes&rsquo; either - at least not on behalf of whites. </p>

		<p>Fact: black Africans destroy every school system, every neighborhood, every town, every city, every state, every nation, and every continent they inhabit in sufficient numbers. There are no exceptions to this immutable law of nature.  None whatever.  Likewise, no black African population on its own has ever risen above its natural level of primitivism.  None has ever developed a written language, the most basic arithmetic, construction techniques beyond thatched huts, no political system beyond the village and tribe.</p>
<p>And yet we are asked (compelled, really) to believe that these self-evident truths are the work of the white man, and more recently, the ever-treacherous Asians.</p>
<p>This is not to deny that there are accomplished black Africans who have excelled in many fields of endeavor, but they are the exception, not the rule.  </p>
<p>On balance, the burgeoning population of blacks in the US is most serious and intractable problem this nation has ever faced.  </p>

		<p>Actually, I think the criminal system is too soft on black criminals.  How many times do we read about a black criminal that committed a rape, assault or even murder that had previous convictions?  Often.  Most black criminals that are convicted of rape, armed robbery and assualt have had prior convictions and in some cases a very long rap sheet.  The fact is they usually serve only a relatively short-time or plea-bargain the first time around.</p>

They can be affluent, hardworking and a great many honourable qualities, but they are full of criminality minded also. As with your blacks and the violence, asians do commit a greater porportional amount of crimes than Whites, but non violent. Those numbers are changing for the worst with gangs and such recently. Most crimes go un-noticed. Gaining welfare and benifits through fraud, fraudulent vehicle insurance claimes, patent infringement, sweatshops, staged robberies of homes, wildlife poaching, illegal waste dumping, theft, and false identity crimes such as credit cards and such related purchasing of goods. I remember new neighbours in my tweens comming home from camping(?) with the paws and other remaind of bears and many other wildlife.<br>

That&rsquo;s why so many of us have quit watching those sports in droves and do watch Nascar -it&rsquo;s the last white sport aside from hockey. And when Nascar strongly promotes its newly-minted &#8216;Drive For Diversity&rsquo;, many will leave it in droves, as well, and hockey will become much bigger.</p>
<p>As to the original topic, if there is &#8216;a racial bias in the criminal justice system from the ground up,&rsquo; it is due to the long known and blatant predictability of &#8216;whodunit&rsquo;: witnessing years of news programs or articles along with statistics to the point of the public being able to guess with at least 75% or more accuracy the race of a perpetrator by listening to the account of the crime itself. When an situation that people find unpleasant is so pervasive and predictable, they tend to get biased against that situation. It&rsquo;s called survival instinct.</p>

Unfortunately, there are plenty of physical therapists, MDs, DCs, massage therapists, etc., who readily support this with fraudulent or exaggerated diagnosises, over Rx, and therapy, and very high billing invoices.  Lawyers are in it big too.  As for the way they act on the enviroment, Johnny is spot on again.  They have no regard for law or Fish and Game limits.  They act on the water and land like soldier ants.  The mushroom gathering in Southern Oregon is a good example.  People there had land plots that they nurtured and harvested for years.  Every season, buyers for restaurants all over the West Coast come to buy mushrooms sold out of the back of pick-ups in a little town I know about.  When the Asians learned about it, they came and raked the mushrooms clean, killing the underlying mycelium that would produce future mushrooms.  It became pretty intense at the time, I heard the story.  I HEARD that some were shooting at the interlopers.  Another one I know personally about was the Abalone poaching that has nearly wiped out the once plentiful abalone populations.  In the 1950s, you could wade into tide pools and pull them off rocks.  By the 1970s, laws were enacted that limited size and daily take (2).  Since the arrival the Vietnamese after 1975 and other Asian groups, the poaching violations became worse, as did fishing violations commerical and sport.  The last I heard, Californis Fish and Game was overwhelmed with poachers and the abalone seasons were being cut down and even eliminated.  I do not know that status of things at present, but I doubt if it is better.</p>
<p>We had a system for preserving natural delicacies like these, insuring their availability for generations, and it worked.  That is, until Liberals with their Diversity sickness let loose a myriad of ills on all of us not unlike Pandora&rsquo;s Box. </p>
<p>All the losses we are seeing, and the proliferation of a growing, disfunctional state, and country, all for the sake of some greedy, and self-righteous people, and political sellouts who put votes before responsibility.</p>

<p>He was the target of what is easily the dumbest hatchet job of all time in the local Seattle Weekly.</p>

		<p>The Asians involved in wildlife poaching - and this occurs at rates that would make you cry - are overwhelmingly Chinese and southeast Asians.  I&rsquo;m sure this same problem is developing in Australia with the arrivals of immigrants from the same countries.  They do this in their home countries, too; the devastation of the pangolin population to fill cookpots in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and China is briefly covered in the Wikipedia article on the scaled, toothless anteaters.  I&rsquo;m afraid that ultimately, wildlife officials in the US will have to take the same extreme measures that have been used - with some success - in Africa: shooting poachers.</p>
<p>Outside of Japan, there really is no public sense of environmental conservation in Asia, and without the public, there&rsquo;s very little police in other countries can do, except catch the occasional perp.  Even in the Russian Far East, poaching is a huge problem, almost all of this to feed demand in nearby China.</p>
<p>This wildlife destruction works exactly like our drug war, being demand-driven.  If the US public&rsquo;s appetite for drugs (or the Chinese appetite for rare animal parts) disappeared, the problems would also go away.</p>
