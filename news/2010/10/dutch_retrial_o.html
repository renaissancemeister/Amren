<h1><a href="http://www.wtop.com/?sid=2069305&amp;nid=105">Dutch Retrial Ordered for Wilders Hate Speech Case</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Toby Sterling, WTOP-FM (Washington, D.C.), October 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Dutch court ordered a retrial Friday for anti-Islam lawmaker Geert Wilders, sending the closely-watched hate speech case back to square one before a whole new panel of judges.</p>
<p>The far-right politician faces charges of inciting hatred against Muslims for many remarks, including some equating Islam with fascism and violence and others calling for a ban on the Quran and a tax on Muslim headscarves.</p>
<p>Wilders accused judges at the Amsterdam District Court of bias and called for their dismissal after they refused to recall a defense witness who wrote on a weblog that a member of an appeals panel directly involved in the case had improperly contacted him.</p>
<p>A hastily convened substitute panel ruled Friday that Wilders&rsquo; objections were valid, which means the trial that began in January must restart from the beginning with new judges.</p>
<p>Wilders welcomed the decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;This gives me a new chance on a new fair trial,&#8221; he said in an e-mail to The Associated Press. &#8220;I am confident that I can only be acquitted because I have broken no law but spoke the truth and nothing but the truth and exercised my freedom of speech in an important public debate about the dangerous totalitarian ideology called Islam.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prosecutors initially refused to take the case, saying Wilders&rsquo; remarks are part of legitimate political debate. But they were ordered to do so by appeals judges, who said there was sufficient evidence for a hate speech trial.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A conservative government that depends on Wilders&rsquo; Freedom Party to reach a one-vote majority in parliament took office this month. In return for his support, the government has vowed to turn away more asylum seekers, halve the number of new immigrants from non-Western countries, ban face-concealing Muslim garb for women in public and force immigrants to pay for their own mandatory citizenship classes.</p>

		<p>If you want hate speech just open up a sensitive textbook. &#8216;Sensitive&rsquo; to non-whites of course. But of course &#8216;hate speech&rsquo; is considered enlightenment if the party you are disparaging is white or European. </p>

		<p>The man is a hero, an absolute hero</p>
<p>&#8216;A hastily convened panel said on Friday that it found the trial judges&rsquo; decision to be &#8220;incomprehensible in the absence of any motivation&#8221;.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11609589" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11609589</a></p>
<p>It is much more difficult to speak the truth in Europe due to the draconian anti free-speech laws.  You can be arrested now in the UK for the most innocuous comments.</p>

		<p> Trial and retrial of Geert Wilders is an excellent example of &#8221; how enemy within acts and operates&#8221;.  Another good example is Mark Steyn&rsquo;s trial in Canada for similiar charges, so called &#8220;inciting hatred&#8221; against &#8220;religion of peace&#8221;. I believe this is an end of our civilization&hellip;How can we allow this to happen? </p>

		<p>Karolina: these are indeed some outrageous examples of the assault that is being waged against us in this  undeclared Culture War. But it need not be the &#8220;end of our civilizaton&#8221; nor do we have to allow this to happen! It is up to us to fight it. Nobody else will do it for us.</p>
