			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mary Klaus, Patriot-News, October 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The church [Lakeside Lutheran Church] is being sold because of a dwindling congregation, another sign of the changing face of mainline houses of worship across the nation.</p>
<p>Protestant flocks are shrinking, being replaced by other denominations and religions. Lakeside is being sold to a Muslim community.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The current membership is not able to keep up with the expenses of such a large building,&#8221; said the Rev. Richard Hair, Lakeside interim pastor, and David Fisher, spokesman for Lower Susquehanna Synod Lutheran Bishop B. Penrose Hoover, in a joint statement. &#8220;The cost of maintaining the building has drained the financial resources of the church.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Episcopalians, Lutherans, United Church of Christ and United Methodists seem to be losing members,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Some say they have older styles of worship not attractive now. Some say they don&rsquo;t demand enough of their members. Nobody knows why.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, conservative evangelical churches are growing, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Roman Catholic churches are holding their numbers because of the growth in the Hispanic population, Jacobsen said.</p>
<p>Jacobsen said the Lutheran faith has been losing 1.5 percent to 2 percent of its members a year for the last four or five years, making it among the biggest losers of members.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lakeside Lutheran Church, built in 1958, has 24,612 square feet and sits on 11‚ÅÑ4 acres across from Italian Lake.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The church is being sold to the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, an Islamic religious movement that believes the long-awaited Messiah arrived more than a century ago.</p>
<p>Akram Khalid, president of the York/Harrisburg Central Pennsylvania Chapter of the Ahamdiyya Muslim community, said his group plans to use the building almost immediately &#8220;as is.&#8221;</p>

		<p>As a history buff and one who has studied historical preservation, I can say that without much connection to this building, the chances of its architectural preservation are slim. In New York, the new ground zero mosque will involve the destruction of historical Victorian buildings. Muslims just really don&rsquo;t seem interested in the preservation of Western architecture, but why would they? <br>
This building will likely be either demolished or remodeled beyond recognition. <br>

		<p>Congregations are dwindling because the Christian faith is losing relevance in the lives of whites.</p>
<p>Christianity committed itself to multiculturalism, and is therefore inherently at odds with the future of whites.  White nationalists have to have a spirituality which is exclusive, relevant, and unlike Christianity, has its holiest sites based territorially within white countries. </p>

		<p>The ELCA (Evangelical Lutheran Church in America) is bleeding churches and membership because of its decision to admit sexually active gays to the ministry, and because they are abandoning the true adherence to the Bible due to the introduction of Liberation Theology by some<br>
newer pastors who are assigned regardless of the fact that they<br>
no longer espouse the confessional Lutheran doctrine.  I recently left such a church because of the above and know that many thousands have also left.  I&rsquo;m now attending a Missouri Synod Lutheran church a liturgical church which still preaches the true doctrine of Lutheranism and does not indulge in preaching social and economic justice.  I don&rsquo;t know what the problem was with the PA church in the article.  It may have been simply because people moved away.</p>

		<p>Protestant flocks are shrinking, being replaced by other denominations and religions. Lakeside is being sold to a Muslim community.</p>
<p>Notice the unwillingness to state the obvious.</p>
<p>The lie, by omission, here is that Christians are becoming less in number (the exact opposite is true), and/or moving out of the neighborhood, creating an opportunity for muslims to move in.  With a hint that islam has become more popular than Christianity and perhaps conversion is the reason the religion in this area is changing.</p>
<p>The truth is that a small minority of muslims moved in, quickly made life intolerable for everyone else (with a specific goal in mind) and now, people are moving away.  As they leave, their property becomes available to be bought up by other muslims&hellip;.for cheap.</p>
<p>There is a name for this&hellip;.ethnic cleansing.  It is considered a crime against humanity&hellip;..except, of course, when whites are the victims.</p>
<p>If you were to place a hidden camera in the new mosque, almost the only topic you would hear being discussed is jihad.  And that is what is being done here.</p>

		<p>Why does AmRen post articles showing the inevitability of Islamization and then censor comments that point this out? Orthodox Christianity can help you but only if one of the prominent figures in White Resistance starts the trend. Too many WASP converts lack an ethnic dimension to their faith and cant see why ethnicity is important to Orthodoxy. WNs may understand</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a former born again Christian who left the faith.</p>
<p>I used to be religious, prayed every night and went to church every Sunday. However, Christianity made me very unhappy. I also don&rsquo;t agree with a lot of Christianity&rsquo;s &#8220;moral&#8221; teachings like condoning adultery because it&rsquo;s supposedly judgemental (John 8:3-11).</p>
<p>Christianity inflicted a lot of emotional scars on me, and I still haven&rsquo;t recovered.</p>
<p>The West is on a religious decline, and I can see why. However, I don&rsquo;t think the white race is imperiled by secularism. Our people can survive without Christianity.</p>

<p>I recently renewed my faith as a Christian and was researching the different churches trying to find one to join and I know why these mainline Protestant churches are dying off or at least some of them.  Their theology has become corrupted, they now have female clergy and are tolerant of homosexuality.  I know the United Church of Christ sanctifies same sex unions, teaches sex education and has liberal views on abortion!  This is a church??? It&rsquo;s no longer a mystery to me as to why Protestant churches are in decline and that it&rsquo;s unlikely there will ever be a Protestant rebirth in this country.  It&rsquo;s sad too because these churches have rich histories and are full of traditions and rituals you won&rsquo;t find in the televangelistic qualities of the Baptist churches or the Evangelicals.  I have seriously considered converting to Catholocism.<br>

		<p>We should begin drafting language to amend the First Amendment of the United States Constitution so that it will no longer guarantee the right to practice Islam, specifically outlawing or removing the right to practice Islam from the Constitution.  Simply put the only way to stop the insatiable force that Islam presents to European and North American cultures and security is to make its practice illegal.  Once this change is made, we will then watch those that practice Islam leave our land and our ancestral homelands in droves.</p>

		<p>Maybe if these churches would stop bringing in millions of &#8220;refugees&#8221; and dumping them on us, and if they would teach the REAL and TRUE Christianity and quit pandering to minorities and illegals and flooding the churches with nonwhites and preaching to Whites to be tolerant and to turn the other cheek, and neutering our men to be &#8220;nice and Christian&#8221; then maybe they would start to flourish again. I quit going a long time ago, simply because of all of the above.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s no wonder the Christian religion is losing members; actions such as this are insulting to Christians and show that the church hierarchy is more interested in money than than are in respecting their own religion. The Church should put up the money do dismantle the building and only then sell the property. To leave the church intact to be used as a mosque will be a constant reminder of the weakening of Christianity and again, a persistant insult to those who do follow the Christian religion.</p>

		<p>Though I&rsquo;m not really a Lutheran - officially - I do attend a Lutheran church on most Sundays, and I can affirm that the congregation, in my church at least, is quite pathetic in terms of attendance.  The pews are about a fourth, maybe one-third, full.  And there is a general sense of pessimism in the air.  It just feels &#8220;dead,&#8221; I suppose.  And from what I gather, this is happening to old denomination Protestant churches all across the Western world.  Its a shame, as most members are being lost to atheism and to the un-civilized, modernist, evangelical churches.  You know, the sort that are featured on all those silly televangelist programs.  They may have their hearts in the rights places, but when I see their wild, contemporary services, diverse and unruly congregations, and complete lack of tradition and culture, I see a partial lack of what Christianity is about.  Of course, Christianity is about fiery sermons, miraculous healing, and an invigorating church body.  But it is also about the preservation of ancient Christian customs, solemnity and respect, dignity, reverence.  And these churches are completely lacking in those areas.  There is no order or structure, no respect or hierarchy.  Absolutely zero tradition of any kind.  Why my fellow Christians are leaving the Lutheran, Anglican, Presbyterian, Methodist, Southern Baptist, etc. denominations for these disturbing &#8220;new-age&#8221; churches begets me.  The answer is not to leave a church because you feel bored or unfulfilled, instead we shoudl work to crush liberal and atheistic reforms that have plagued the old denominations lately, and work to create a real revival in America.  The Lutherans, the Presbyterians, Anglicans, etc., all at one time had the fiery sermons, the miracles, the invigorated church bodies.  They have lost these aspects, but it need not be a permanent loss.  If only we didn&rsquo;t all have this sense of giving up on things we feel have gone awry, instead of fighting to preserve and return to old ways.  Yes, I think I know now - that is why these churches are dying, because when someone gets bored and sees a televangelist program that looks &#8220;fun,&#8221; they abandon their old church and find a new one.  Instead, they should stick to their church, which was probably the churhc of their parents and grandparents, and work for a revival of sorts.  Only then can the good old churches be saved.</p>

<p>Hardly. Ahmadiyah muslims are considered heretics by other muslims. They are more likely to be a target for violent attacks than to plan any. </p>
<p>In May 86 people were killed in attacks against two Ahmadi mosques in Pakistan. Since then there has been an upsurge in threats and intimidation against Ahmadi muslims, notably in the UK. <a href="https://tinyurl.com/2b9hpxp" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2b9hpxp</a> (Independent)<br>

		<p>People aren&rsquo;t leaving the Christian church because of some &ldquo;moral evil&rdquo; or because a loss of identity, but rather because we whites are simply finding other ways to express our spirituality. I know whites that are pagan, Buddhist, agnostic, etc yet they are no less white than a protestant white. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Christianity has played a major role in Western history but I do not believe our future should be based on religion. Spirituality? Yes, but doctrine will lead to nothing but our demise. The world is changing, and in some ways for the better, and the WN movement cannot try to revive a time that has past, rather we must adapt and evolve to survive.  Just like the Japanese in the 19th century, either we progress or we regress. However, the white movement must protect white Christians as our brothers and sisters, just as we must protect the pagans or the nonbelievers.  I&rsquo;m not saying white Christians should ditch their beliefs, but a white nation cannot enforce Christian beliefs either. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Besides, Christianity isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;white&rdquo; anymore, just look at the floods of catholic Mexicans coming in, or the southern black churches.  The once great gothic churches our ancestors built are now flooded with mindless non-white sheep. Just how many nonwhites are interested in the gods of old? How many black people even know who Frigg is? Our ancestor&rsquo;s beliefs evolved in Europe, they are a European product, and though Christianity, like I said, can never be forgotten in the West, it is no longer a &ldquo;white&rdquo; thing. <br>

		<p>Due to the fact that most of the older Protestant churches have become very liberal bastions of female clergy, gay acceptance and refugee &#8220;social justice&#8221; people are leaving in droves. There is a definate shift in Christianity toward Charismatic, non-denominational or Pentecostal congregations and Eastern Orthodox (Russian, Greek ect) churches. If you look at a church parking lot on an average Sunday morning you will see the older Protestant denominations just about empty but churches like Assemblies of God or Calvary chapel overflowing for 2-3 services in one morning.  </p>

		<p>The church has lost membership because the area around it has turned into a ghetto, full of violent &#8220;youts&#8221;, winos, hookers and other dregs of society. People don&rsquo;t want to attend Sunday services where there is always a good chance of a drive-by shooting. With membership declining, there is less and less money coming in for church upkeep. Sale to any available buyer becomes necessary. The available buyer here was an offshoot of the Muslim &#8220;religion&#8221;. </p>

		<p>I have read every post here, today, and agree with many, that our Churches in the U.S., Canada, and Europe are losing great numbers of members, due to modernism, secularism, and rabid Liberalism, which has been attacking our Race and Cultures for over 50 years.  </p>
<p>However, I took a great deal of hope in the recent Rosary Rallies that were organized across the United States by America Needs Fatima, a Traditionalist Roman Catholic Organization that rejects the changes of Vatican II, which in my own opinion, allowed the poison of Ecumenicalism into our Fortress Catholic Church.</p>
<p>We reject all things non-Traaditional of the Catholic faith. </p>
<p>Mary Most Holy gave a warning to the children at Fatima that the world was heading towards GOD&rsquo;s wrath if it did not convert to Her Immaculate Heart, and praise Her Son, Jesus Christ, Our Lord.</p>
<p>The Blessed Mother told these children that Russia, which had just succumbed to the Communist Revolution, in 1917,and killed the Christian Czar, and his family, would suffer a terrible punishment, if it did not come back to the Faith. </p>
<p>The only way to throw off the advancement of Islam everywhere, is to acknowledge the Divinity of our Saviour, Jesus Christ, and to convert to His Will.</p>
<p>I recommend that AmRen readers take a few minutes and visit the website for Tradition, Family and Property, at www.tfp.org and America Needs Fatima at www.anf.org . </p>
<p>Then pray for the conversion of America, and the world.  </p>

<p>Yeah, no kidding.  This has been going on in California for 40-50 years as we Whites are being (and have been) methodically displaced by others   &mdash;   others who do not share our culture, heritage or history and have no appreciation for what we&rsquo;ve created and built.</p>
<p>Our landmarks, architecture, old buildings   &mdash;    any/all vestiges of White American Culture are being razed and destroyed, the viaducts we built covered with mexican murals depicting Whites as colonial destroyers and mexicans as oppressed native peoples.</p>
<p>They destroy our buildings to destroy us.</p>
<p>Interesting aren&rsquo;t they, these others, as they work to destroy and displace us yet imitate everything we do and worship the technology we&rsquo;ve created and built    &mdash;    things they aren&rsquo;t capable of building or maintaining for themselves as they have neither the intelligence, focus nor drive to do so.</p>
<p>Local, shrinking, historical societies have been able to save a few things but I wonder for how long, how much longer can they hold out before historical designation means nothing if it pertains to White America.</p>
<p>As it is, we Whites are only 33% of Los Angeles, and in decline.</p>
<p>All we have left in LA of some of our wonderful landmarks and architecture is a book and PBS show,  <i>Things that Aren&rsquo;t Here Anymore</i>  I&rsquo;ve heard stories of older people crying as they view this show, as to what has been destroyed, as LA has changed demographically, dramatically over the past 1/2 century and we have been displaced and forced out of the neighborhoods we built.</p>
<p>DH comes from the anthracite coal area of Pennsylvania, marked by beautiful onion-towered Easter Orthodox churches and ornate rococo Catholic cathedrals.  Every time I see them, I wonder how much longer they&rsquo;ll stand, as that area is rapidly being rapidly hispanicized, just as California was in previous decades.</p>
<p>How soon before you folks in Pennsylvania are crying in front of your  TV screens as you watch your own version of <i> Things That Aren&rsquo;t Here Anymore </i> ?</p>

		<p>My ELCA Lutheran church in the SW suburbs of Chicago is 180 degrees the opposite of the type of limp-wristed ones I&rsquo;m reading about on here.</p>
<p>70% of our congregants are former Catholics who got fed up with all the ills of that once-great faith.  In fact, the largest ethnic group in our church isn&rsquo;t Swedish, German, Norwegian, or Danish, it&rsquo;s&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.Polish.  That&rsquo;s right, Polish and we have many Irish and Italian members, too.</p>
<p>Strong men and strong women run our congregation without regard for political correctness or any other of that phony university drivel.  And guess what: our attendance and church membership continues to skyrocket.</p>
<p>When ELCA comes out with its idiotic decisions about homosexuals, illegal aliens, and support of black liberation causes, we as a congregation tell ELCA to go jump.  Several months ago an ELCA honcho came to one of our church council meetings and left (halfway through it) because he finally realized that we don&rsquo;t buy the synod&rsquo;s bill of goods.</p>
<p>Go through our parking lot and you&rsquo;ll see many conservative bumperstickers, some old Reagan ones, anti-abortion ones, and nary an Obama.  We are very conservative in a town made up of people who saw their former towns ruined by Africans, moronic libs, and social engineering do-gooders.</p>

		<p>&#8220;People aren&rsquo;t leaving the Christian church because of some &ldquo;moral evil&rdquo; or because a loss of identity, but rather because we whites are simply finding other ways to express our spirituality. I know whites that are pagan, Buddhist, agnostic, etc yet they are no less white than a protestant white.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to tell us why people are leaving.  I&rsquo;ve been there.  The mainline Protestant churches are performing gay marriages and same sex unions and have homosexual pastors in their ranks.  People are leaving these denominations because the teachings of these churches are not in accordance with Biblical doctrine.  We aren&rsquo;t leaving to convert to some fringe kook cult either, we&rsquo;re seeking out conservative churches with which to join.  </p>

So this sect of Islam is no problem to anyone except other<br>
muslim sects who (as you admit) hate them. So the end result of<br>
muslim immigration into the USA is to bring the hatreds and fanaticism that destroy every other Islamic country into the USA.<br>
If you want to see what happens to any country with multiple<br>
sects of Islam check out Iraq, Pakistan, Iran, the Balkans etc<br>
etc. We have lived free of this for centuries here in North<br>
America&hellip;a veritable blessing..and now we are giving it all<br>
away becuase no one has the guts to say NO..NO Islam in the USA<br>
no matter what sect.</p>

		<p>The Ahmadi &lsquo;heretics&rsquo;, like the Sufis, are no bother in the U.K., where they&rsquo;ve been active for decades.</p>
<p><br>
Until they become a majority or gain some level of wealth.  Then they want jihad&hellip;..and will happily kill whites right along with other muslims they themselves consider &#8220;heretics&#8221;.</p>
<p>This is the nature of islam.  Peace when you are weak.  War when you are not.  Betrayal of those who accepted you followed by genocide and enslavement and indoctrination of the children who survive.  Heck, the entire middle east has that repeating pattern as its history.  Many of those murdered/enslaved, were white.  Rape and forced breeding of their children changed that.</p>
<p>There was a time, not too long ago, when the aggressively jihadist muslims were quite friendly with the US government.  All smiles and helpful against our mutual enemy&hellip;.communism.</p>
<p>You are a fool if you think there are exceptions.  Heck, there were many communist fools who made alliance with the friendly anti-US type of muslims in Iran and helped them get rid of the Shah.  What happened to those people?  Oh yeah, the particular type of muslim that was &#8220;different than other types of islam&#8221; murdered every single one of those communists once they came to power in iran.</p>
<p>Death is the price of this foolishness.  Lots and lots of dead people throughout hundreds of years of history who would tell you this&hellip;.if they weren&rsquo;t dead that is.</p>

		<p>Yes, it is chilling to see a church building used as a mosque,<br>
especially when you know what the Muslims believe about Jesus: i.e. Jesus was a Muslim whose disciples corrupted his message. Furthermore, all the prophets and notables of the Abrahamic faith were Muslims. In fact, Allah created nothing but Muslims, including you and me.  But the final insult:  Jesus will return and when he returns he will destroy the last vestige of Christianity. (Mohammed, thankfully, will not return.) This should be good news to those who will not weep when Christianity is gone, but will you be happier if it is replaced with Islam?  I&rsquo;ve been a Christian all my life and it never made me unhappy; it&rsquo;s brought me reassurance and inner peace.  <br>
To No. 10, Jesus did not condone adultery   &mdash;   he told the woman to go and sin no more.  By his words, Jesus is asking them to consider if they are not guilty of the same sins they condemn in her.  Would you really prefer that she be stoned? </p>

		<p>Even if this sect is considered heretical among other Muslim sects, the conversion of a church into a mosque is symbolic of conquest.  Churches throughout the Middle East have been converted, as were churches in Spain during the Muslim occupation. The Lutherans are bleeding members due to the embracing of homosexuality by the Lutheran hierarchy.  It does seem ironic that a church that embraces homosexuality is taken over by a faith that executes homosexuals.  </p>

		<p>#27 makes a pertinent point. I have observed churches and synagogues abandoned because of neighbourhood demographic change. This may well be the case here. But the overarching fact is that whites Americans are being displaced by aliens, whether imported or domestic.  </p>

		<p>the gates of hell will not prevail against the Church (capital C), but they can certainly prevail over a single building belonging to an apostate congregation. If the Jewish Temple has been destroyed on several occasions for the sins of the congregation, how much more so a random church. Buildings come and go.</p>

The Mexicans that live in my region (Midwest) have no interest in preserving any of our Victorian homes, antebellum row houses, and gothic churches. I&rsquo;ve seen them take entire blocks of historic buildings and turn them into ghetto fiesta messes, that&rsquo;s not as bad as what they do to the old churches.</p>
<p>Historic preservation around here is almost entirely (if not only) whites, especially older whites who fight to preserve our heritage and architecture. I wanted to get into historical preservation, but with all of these issues, the question comes up &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the point?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Besides, a lot of &ldquo;hip&rdquo; whites who love the old lofts will gladly tear down blocks of European houses so a new &ldquo;cutting edge&rdquo; building can be put up. In addition, I&rsquo;ve heard multiple times that Western architecture isn&rsquo;t important anymore. This is our present, a society that no longer values what we have created. </p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t act as if I am some foreigner. I am an agnostic Euro-American of Protestant background, I was raised in the church and still hold many stories I learned close to my heart. Besides, what about gay Christians? Do they deserve to lose their faith? While you are at it, you have to get rid of anyone that eats shrimp, women, children that talk back, etc, etc. Did you ever stop and think that Christianity might be important to them? If you wish to leave a church that supports gay marriage that is by all means, your choice and your freedom of association, but don&rsquo;t use gays as scapegoats for the church&rsquo;s larger problems.<br>

		<p>Stuff like this is happening all over Europe. The symbolism is very clear. But there is irony too. Many Christian churches and sects supported multiculturalism and the opening of our doors to the third wolrd. Many sponsor non-Whites to move to the west. So it is a bit of a case of being hosited on one&rsquo;s own petard. Still it is sad.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t ever worry about the Ahmadi Muslims. Our motto which we promote wherever we are (in 190 countries of the world) is &#8220;LOVE FOR ALL, HATRED FOR NONE&#8221;. We believe in LOVE and we DO NOT believe in JIHAD like some certain Muslims do. Our leader condemns violence in the book &#8220;Murder in the Name of Allah&#8221;).</p>
<p>Our supreme leader says in London on Oct. 20: &#8220;The Ahmadiyya Muslim Jamaat and its institution of Khilafat has absolutely no interest or desire to overthrow any government. That is not our purpose. &rdquo; [His Holiness Mirza Masroor Ahmad].<br>
Our goal is to serve HUMANITY. We have served humanity wherever needed worldwide through our program HUMANITY FIRST, so please NEVER be afraid that we will beg instead of giving (see https://www.alislam.org/introduction/intro.pdf)</p>
<p>Our fund comes from our members because EVERY member is to donate ONE-SIXTEENTH (called Chanda Aam)of his/her income to the community (we need a special approval if we wish to donate more, which is 10%, called Chanda Wassiyyat). This fund mainly goes to humanity causes, except when we need to buy a place of worship. Our definition of &#8220;worshipping God&#8221; is &#8220;spiritual closeness to God and to serve God&rsquo;s creation&#8221;. </p>
<p>Our members range from ordinary people to highly educated professionals (including a Nobel Prize Winner in physics).<br>
With tens of millions active members we have over 8000 mosques worldwide, many of them with the capacity for over 6000 people (over 20,000 members attend our annual gathering in our headquarters mosque in UK)and we have been known to promote peace(see <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/whall/?id=2010-10-20a.284.0" rel="nofollow">https://www.theyworkforyou.com/whall/?id=2010-10-20a.284.0</a> which is the UK parliament on Ahmadi Muslims).</p>
<p>Anyone with question, just approach the mosque. Ask away.</p>

		<p>Hira #40: What you write here reminds me of an original &#8220;Twilight Zone&#8221; episode of the early 1960s.</p>
<p>Earth was visited by giant Aliens from Space, and their intention was to help all of Humanity. People began taking trips to their new benefactors home planet, but they never returned. </p>
<p>A book which was brought to the UN by the Aliens and presented to them was entitled, &#8220;To Serve Man&#8221;. Intelligence Officers later cracked the Aliens own language which revealed that the book was, in fact, a Cook book on how to prepare and serve man as a meal. </p>
<p>So, forgive me if I do not believe the words from our ancient enemies. Your past deeds speak volumes about what Islam is really all about.  </p>
