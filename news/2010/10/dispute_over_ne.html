			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jerry Markon and Krissah Thompson, Washington Post, October 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On Election Day 2008, Maruse Heath, the leader of Philadelphia&rsquo;s New Black Panther Party, stood in front of a neighborhood polling place, dressed in a paramilitary uniform.</p>
<p>Within hours, an amateur video showing Heath, slapping a black nightstick and exchanging words with the videographer, had aired on TV and ricocheted across the nation.</p>
<p>Among those who saw the footage was J. Christian Adams, who was in his office in the Justice Department&rsquo;s Civil Rights Division in Washington.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought, &#8216;This is wrong, this is not supposed to happen in this country,&rsquo;&#8221; Adams said. &#8220;There are armed men in front of a polling place, and I need to find out if they violated the law, because in my mind there&rsquo;s a good chance that they did.&#8221;</p>
<p>The clash between the black nationalist and the white lawyer has mushroomed into a fierce debate over the government&rsquo;s enforcement of civil rights laws, a dispute that will be aired next week when the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights unveils findings from a year-long investigation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Interviews and government documents reviewed by The Washington Post show that the case tapped into deep divisions within the Justice Department that persist today over whether the agency should focus on protecting historically oppressed minorities or enforce laws without regard to race.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In recent months, Adams and a Justice Department colleague have said the case was dismissed because the department is reluctant to pursue cases against minorities accused of violating the voting rights of whites. Three other Justice Department lawyers, in recent interviews, gave the same description of the department&rsquo;s culture, which department officials strongly deny.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Deepening a divide</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since the division was created in 1957, most of its [DOJ&rsquo;s Civil Rights Division] cases have been filed on behalf of minorities. But there has not always been agreement about that approach.</p>
<p>Civil rights officials from the Bush administration have said that enforcement should be race-neutral. But some officials from the Obama administration, which took office vowing to reinvigorate civil rights enforcement, thought the agency should focus primarily on cases filed on behalf of minorities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Before the New Black Panther controversy, another case had inflamed those passions. Ike Brown, an African American political boss in rural Mississippi, was accused by the Justice Department in 2005 of discriminating against the county&rsquo;s white minority. It was the first time the 1965 Voting Rights Act was used against minorities and to protect whites.</p>

		<p>First of all, anything that might in the slightest bit might irritate blacks is going to be predicted to cause divisions. These idiots would have been shot for their actions in any civilized country and yet, the US lets them get away with it. blacks have GOT to STOP pulling these stunts and treating this country like it&rsquo;s their playground, the taxpayers like an ATM, and the women like their whores and men their punching bags. This isn&rsquo;t an ATM, brothel, and playground for them to have fun in. </p>
<p>This is intimidation plain and simple and should have been dealt with immediately and in the harshest possible way. Blacks like the Panthers are the ones causing this division, not whites. They are the ones picking fights with every other race in this country. </p>

		<p>The fact that there is one single person in the Civil Rights Division who even thinks twice about enforcing anti-discrimination laws when crimes are committed against whites, shows that this office is NOT interested in civil rights AT ALL -they are only interested in advancing the minorities, at the expense of white people.</p>

Remarkably, this story hasn&rsquo;t disappeared down the memory hole and it seems there are people in Justice who are taking it seriously and are using it to expose Justice of their biases and double standards.</p>
<p>Keep your fingers crossed.</p>

<p>Blacks should never be made to look like the bad guys but instead always like the victims?</p>
<p>This is written about in the same way as some of the news articles about &#8216;reverse discrimination&rsquo;. It almost seems to justify the &#8216;reverse discrimination&rsquo; (in this case the justice department only investigating incidences of minority disenfranchisment).</p>
<p>The folks are Resisting Defamation claim the phrase &#8216;reverse discrimination&rsquo; itself is a racial slur of sorts. It suggests whites are discriminating for realm and even that the &#8216;reverse&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t. </p>

		<p>This story breaking is good news - as it shines light on the DOJ rats that hide from the light and under the various federal laws and bureaucracies that knew on the fiber and foundation of this country - and have for a great many years.</p>
<p>The larger problem is that we have at least two generations of American White people that have internalized the notion that Civil Rights laws, the federal government, tax policy, and the right to live in peace and prosperity are not deservedly available to White people any longer - and that Whites deserve persecution from the federal authorities in the manner applied by Eric Holder and his like - minded allies. These people - not a majority but a goodly portion of our populace, have internalized their teachings from all corners of the academy, the media, and entertainment. </p>
<p>The DOJ careerists that fought to suffocate this new Black Panther travesty pre-date Holder&rsquo;s arrival at DOJ by years if not decades. Eric Holder was right that we need a frank discussion of race, but where he missed it is that Whites have for too long politely avoided any real examination or discussion of the discrimination against their own people that occurs every day and in thousands of ways. This problem demands a courageous discussion, not a cowardly one that we have been getting for years. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m tired of blacks (and hispanics) not following the same anti discrimination laws that they demand whites follow.  In 2000, blacks and liberals claimed they were disenfranchised to vote, which was a total lie.  Never happended.  Then in 2008, there were black men standing outside a polling place with a weapon (which is illegal to have a weapon in or near a government building unless you&rsquo;re a cop or in the military) telling whites walking by that they were going to be ruled by a black man.  That was a real example of racial intimidation at the voting polls, and there was evidence to suppor that.  Yet, our &#8216;post racial&rsquo; administration won&rsquo;t do anything about it.  Gee, and liberals and blacks who hate whites are wondering why whites are getting annoyed and fed up with them anymore&hellip;.</p>

<p>The DOJ&rsquo;s refusal to do anything about the NBPP intimidation of voters could be an important turning point in the downfall of both Obama and Holder. That &#8220;nightstick video&#8221; was VERY widely seen across the country   &mdash;   both on Youtube and to a certain extent in the MSM too. That clip is as shocking to white people as the Rodney King tape was to black people. Every white who sees it   &mdash;   with the exception of the far-left PC fringe   &mdash;   reacts to it with fear and disgust. And when those white viewers later hear that the DOJ has DROPPED THE CASE because they don&rsquo;t take racism against white people seriously, those whites become very upset. I&rsquo;m convinced there are millions of middle-of-the-road white Americans who would generally describe themselves as &#8220;liberals&#8221; and &#8220;Democrats&#8221;, who mostly have nothing against blacks, but who just can&rsquo;t ignore when the BLATANT anti-white racism of this case. You don&rsquo;t have to be an AmRen reading race realist to get angry about the NBPP; all you need to be is sane. </p>
<p>The fact that both a black President AND his black AG give kid-glove treatment to blacks who have been CAUGHT ON TAPE dressing and behaving like mau-mau guerrillas OUTSIDE A POLLING STATION should be enough to wake up a large portion of the slumbering caucasian masses to the true black-supremacist nature of this administration. Even those willing to give Obama the benefit of the doubt, or cut him some slack due to his race, even those people have a limit   &mdash;   and the NBPP&rsquo;s Father Shabooboo (or whatever he calls himself) yelling things like &#8220;You about to be ruled by the BLACK man, cracker!&#8221; exceeds the limits of normal Americans&rsquo; tolerance for minority misbehavior. It crosses their &#8220;line in the sand.&#8221; It&rsquo;s too much for them. It&rsquo;s WAY too much. Because   &mdash;   unless they&rsquo;re professional agitators or otherwise in the &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; industry itself   &mdash;   this is one outrage they just can&rsquo;t rationalize away. </p>
<p>I believe that much of the pummeling Obama is going to take a the polls in a couple of weeks   &mdash;   and then the even more seriously pummeling he&rsquo;s scheduled to take come 2012   &mdash;   will be attributable to the NBPP/DOJ scandal. This seemingly minor incident could, in time, prove to be one of those decisive moments in American history. Let&rsquo;s hope so!<br>

		<p> Picture this a couple of white guys in baseball uniforms carrying bats outside a polling station. The results would be totally different.I say just give us equality and we win. We have the power to demand it and if we don&rsquo;t our descendents will hate us.</p>
