			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kathleen Doheny, USA Today, October 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Black mothers in the United States are less likely to breast-feed their babies than other moms, and many cite a personal preference for the bottle as the primary reason, new research finds.</p>
<p>Overall, breast-feeding rates are rising, but the long-time disparity between ethnic groups persists, said Dr. Amudha Palaniappan, a pediatrics resident at Cooper University Hospital in Camden, N.J., who led the research. Fifty-four percent of black mothers try breast-feeding, while the national average is 73%, according to background information in the study.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She grouped their answers into categories, including barriers experts consider relatively easy to change (fear of pain, latching problems, milk supply issues); barriers that are not so easily changed (lack of desire to breast-feed, insufficient knowledge, previous formula-feeding, return to work or school), or true barriers (being on chemotherapy).</p>
<p>Only 23% of the black mothers had easily changed barriers compared with 42% of the non-black mothers. Similarly, 89% of the black moms had barriers not easily changed versus 74% of the other ethnicities.</p>
<p>A lack of interest in breast-feeding was the most commonly reported barrier to nursing among black women  &mdash;  55% of black women compared to 27% of women in other ethnic groups felt this way.</p>
<p>Misinformation about breast-feeding was mentioned by 14% of black women and 31% of non-blacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;In other studies what has been shown is, there is this comfort level with formula (among black women), that formula is acceptable,&#8221; said Dr. Lori Feldman-Winter, professor of pediatrics and division head of adolescent medicine at Cooper University Hospital, a co-author of the study.</p>

		<p>Watch for the screams of &#8220;racism&#8221; when it comes out that black women are having higher rates of breast cancer.  Breast-feeding your child helps protect against breast cancer.  So all these black women who refuse to breast-feed are putting themselves at risk.  Somehow, though, it will be blamed on whitey.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s easier to dump the kid on Grandma and go out partying if you aren&rsquo;t nursing. Some black mothers just aren&rsquo;t willing to invest the time and effort in breastfeeding their child, plus watching the mother&rsquo;s diet for things that might upset baby&rsquo;s tummy (chocolate, coffee, etc.) Add to that the recommendation of abstaining from alcohol, tobacco and illegal drugs. To be frank, there is the realization that leaking breasts aren&rsquo;t particularly sexually attractive, especially to men who aren&rsquo;t committed to mother and child, and is uncomfortable and a nuisance especially among very young mothers, as well as the fears (in some cases justified) of losing that girlishly perky shape, or of looking &#8220;backward&#8221; or &#8220;native&#8221;&hellip;<br>
Nursing a child properly and ensuring the mother-child bond and founding the early nutrition and health of the next generation is something that takes time anda sustained effort and many AA mothers just aren&rsquo;t up to it. </p>

		<p>One thing that has been established is that breast fed children develop higher IQs.  Shouldn&rsquo;t certain gentically challenged groups embrace breast feeding to improve an already stacked deck vis-a-vis intelligence?</p>
<p>&#8220;A study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition shows that breastfed infants tested 5.2 IQ points higher than formula fed infants&#8221; (clinical absract <br>

		<p>Perhaps black women have discovered that their breast milk was actually manufactured in a C.I.A. laboratory in exurban Virginia, in order to poison their babies while rendering the women barren and their men sterile?</p>

		<p>I agree with most of what you&rsquo;ve written except this:</p>
<p><i>as well as the fears (in some cases justified) of losing that girlishly perky shape</i></p>
<p>Breastfeeding doesn&rsquo;t cause saggy breasts.  Pregnancy itself (especially multiple pregnancies) is the biggest culprit.  Smoking is also a major contributing factor because smoking breaks down a protein in the skin called elastin, which gives youthful skin its elastic appearance and supports the breast.</p>

<p>You still have to mix formula with water.  If the water that the mother is drinking is polluted, then the water that she&rsquo;s using with the formula would be polluted as well.  If the baby lives in the same environment as the mother, the baby will also be exposed to those substances on a daily basis.  Choosing formula over breast-milk isn&rsquo;t going to protect them.</p>

		<p>I think Bantu women regard their breasts more as &#8220;tools&#8221; to attract Bantu men with, than their actual function, which is to feed their offspring.</p>

<p>You know that the base of formula is cow&rsquo;s milk, right?  Well, I just want everyone out there to understand that cows are only given the highest quality spring water.  It is filtered using reverse osmosis and then it is distilled to remove impurities.  Also, cows are fed only the highest quality, all natural, all organic grass and grains.  They are never given ANY unnecessary medications and their surroundings are so clean that they could only be described as &#8220;pristine.&#8221; </p>
<p>Yeah, I really think women should give their babies more formula.  After all, your own body might have some &#8220;impurities&#8221; in it.  </p>
<p>More seriously though, breastfeeding for many women is a very hard thing to do.  As far as I can tell, most people these days do not consider anything which is hard to be worth doing at all, no matter what the benefits.  It&rsquo;s as simple as that. </p>

		<p>Thank God. Finally an advantage caused by blacks&rsquo; laziness. Add breastfeeding to their haphazard, inconsiderate, slovenly way of behaving, and it would borderline on obscenity we would have to deal with everywhere blacks are.</p>

		<p>A black teacher&rsquo;s aide told me that blacks (especially in the South) don&rsquo;t bother with formula  &mdash;  they just open up a can of Carnation&rsquo;s Condensed Milk and pour it straight into the bottle.  He said stores are stacked floor to ceiling with these cans.</p>
<p>As for breast feeding raising IQ levels  &mdash;  I hope so, to counteract the four shots of Thimerosal-laden RhoGam I got with each pregnancy.  It&rsquo;s no wonder my daughter was born with red hair&hellip;</p>

		<p>Blacks do not want to have anything to do with what&rsquo;s natural or with nature in general. Notice how they bring the loud rap to the public parks and are rarely seen in outdoor sports (and I&rsquo;m not talkin&rsquo; basketball, but hiking, camping, etc.) When we went across country visiting national parks a few years back, the main thing I noticed was the prevalance of bikers (go, Americans!) and the complete lack of even one black   &mdash;   even at Old Faithful, which you&rsquo;d think most people have heard of.</p>
