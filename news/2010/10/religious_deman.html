<h1><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE69O19I20101025">Religious Demands Rise in French State Schools: Study</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Heneghan, Reuters, October 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Muslim pupils and parents in France are increasingly making religious demands on the state school system that teachers should rebuff by explaining the country&rsquo;s secular principles, according to an official report.</p>
<p>The High Council for Integration (HCI) reported growing problems with pupils of immigrant backgrounds who object to courses about the Holocaust, the Crusades or evolution, demand halal meals and &#8220;reject French culture and its values.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is becoming difficult for teachers to resist religious pressures,&#8221; said the report, published in draft form by the newspaper Journal du Dimanche over the weekend. The final report will be presented to the government next month.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>France&rsquo;s strict separation of church and state relegates religion to the private sphere, an approach challenged by a growing Islamic identity among some of the five million Muslims in the country&rsquo;s 65 million population.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>REFUSING CLASSES, DEMANDING HALAL</p>
<p>Teachers often faced objections when they taught courses about world religions, the Holocaust or France&rsquo;s war in Algeria, or discussed events related to Israel and the Palestinians or American military actions in Muslim countries, the study said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teachers regularly find that Muslim parents refuse to have their children learn about Christianity,&#8221; it said. &#8220;Some think it amounts to evangelization.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Teachers found they could discuss the transatlantic slave trade but met criticism from pupils when they brought up the history of slavery within Africa or in the Middle East.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In some areas with large immigrant populations, many pupils shun school cafeterias for religious reasons, even though most offer alternative dishes when pork is on the menu.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The report stressed the state could allow alternatives to pork but could not allow halal or kosher meals because the price for ritually slaughtered meat included a tax paid to religious organizations that certify the food was properly prepared.</p>
<p>&#8220;The school cannot, in this sense, participate in the religious education of its pupils or conform to principles that it does not recognize,&#8221; the report said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>PHILOSOPHICAL UPHEAVAL</p>
<p>During Ramadan, some Muslim pupils harass others who don&rsquo;t observe the annual daytime fast, it said. Boys who identify themselves as Muslims and reject French values harass girls who do well in class as &#8220;collaborators&#8221; with the &#8220;dirty French.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some girls ask to be excused from gymnasium or pool sessions because they are not supposed to mix with boys, it added.</p>
<p>The report said French schools must insist on co-education, equal rights and mutual respect. &#8220;Being a French citizen means accepting challenges to one&rsquo;s opinions .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this is the price to pay for the freedom of opinion and expression.</p>

		<p>Problem: Muslims don&rsquo;t like the food or education in France.</p>
<p>Solution: Muslims should leave France and go back to their countries that adhere to the ways of their &#8220;religion&#8221;.</p>

<p><br>
Well, it should be quite simple.  If you don&rsquo;t want your children to learn anything about Christianity, the best way is not to move to a Christian country.</p>

		<p>   A country that has citizens who consider the native population as dirty and cooperation with the native population as &#8220;collaboration&#8221;, a word that often mean traitor in French can expect conflicts and revolts. The natives will lose their country and culture unless they demand that the &#8220;immigrants&#8221; accept the national culture or deport the &#8220;immigrants&#8221; back to where they came from. <br>
    No welfare, assistance or language help should be given those who hate the country they have moved to as doing so will only increase the numbers of immigrants who hate the native population.<br>
   This is true in all countries whether the socialists, communists, progressives or liberals like it or not and in time the &#8220;immigrants &#8221; who hate the natives will turn on those who helped them.</p>

		<p>Gee, do you think Woulda-Coulda-Shoulda applies here?</p>
<p>In terms of the French maybe reading some history books themselves (the Iberian Crusades come to mind) before committing to importing a hostile alien culture to do their most menial labor while knowing they are about as likely to get &#8216;into the system&rsquo; of French elitist economics (23% youth unemployment since the mid 90s) as they are to be baptized by the Pope?</p>
<p>Ironically, France has more experience with &#8216;modern Islam&rsquo; than just about anyone, including the Brits who were in the Gulf with BP from the 50s, at least.</p>
<p>What these effete clods don&rsquo;t seem to get (and which will prevent globalizaton in the long run, I hope&hellip;) is that _if you have a free society_ created that way on the blood of patriots who fought for the right to free exchange of ideas, you cannot import a slave culture whose very religion of &#8216;submission&rsquo; is anathema to the notion of individual choice and responsibility.</p>
<p>You _cannot_ make that work.  Because the first thing the new comers will do (after a brief pause in awe of the riches there to be taken) is demand a return to the lifestyle they are used to.  Slaves wanting you to join them in eternal indenturement.  Via the jizziya payment of protection money and then by gradual &#8216;Islamicization&rsquo; of everthing of Western worth.  To include unequal rights for those of &#8216;lesser&rsquo; gender and religion.  Justified by slanted views of history.</p>
<p>Because when your functional IQ is in the low 80s, _the truth is not important_.  Only what you are comfortable with.  Instinctively.</p>
<p>Nor is this at all an &#8216;Asian&rsquo; thing.  I think it is equally a resident problem in the West.  Where we have lived so long with the assumption that truth has it&rsquo;s own merit that it has become a landmark, not a right worth fighting for.  And so we just &#8216;assume&rsquo; that a preference for it will always be there.  </p>
<p>When in fact, it is not.  Not for most of the world.</p>
<p>Tribal loyalty exceeds social altruism and ideology destroys idealism in EVERY culture but one.</p>
<p>Ours.</p>
<p>And it will remain that way, a true mark of our innate dignity, only so long as we harbor it only for ourselves.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism has been a disaster.</p>
<p>For everyone.</p>

		<p>Liberty, equality and franternity, for Muslims, by Muslims, within the Muslim community.  Complaints, riots, assault, rape, and fire bombings for all others.  Welcome to the multicultural Europe with France leading the way.  France didn&rsquo;t have to kill itself: &#8220;&hellip;growing problems with pupils of immigrant backgrounds&hellip;&#8221;.  Such specific situations can be avoided, and in fact are avoided by the more enlightened nations.  </p>

		<p>if the Muslims were more intelligent, they would run into the arms of modern European culture, because their own culture is incredibly retarded and repressive and backward.</p>
<p>as one poster mentioned, most Muslim countries have average IQs around 80, so in terms of mental ability, most European Muslims are on par with African-Americans and Mexican-Americans.</p>
<p>as in the US, anyone who cast doubt on the likelihood of their catching up to us anytime soon is stigmatized as a racist fascist, etc.</p>
<p>but if we could listen in as the keyhole to discussions among politically correct European policymakers and politicians, I strongly suspect they are perfectly conscious of the fact that most Muslims are not very bright and will never be competitive in European societies - that if all goes well, they will constitute a reasonably well behaved and highly subsidized lower class.</p>
<p>at worst, they will continue to constitute a criminal underclass which makes all out war against European values.</p>
<p>denial of differences in cognitive ability between the races has been the undoing of European civilization.</p>
<p>all issues of cultural and religious clashes inside, these people are simply not intelligent enough function in modern societies, and will always remain wards of the state.</p>

		<p>OK folks, when are WE going to start DEMANDING things OUR way?!? Teachers should teach the FACTS about OUR race&rsquo;s history [like we invented darn near everything], teach about islams true history, teach about Christianity and it&rsquo;s use as founding principles of all of western society, demand our food, etc etc ad nauseum.<br>
Obviously, no one should subject their child to the public indoctrination system if at all possible, but for those of us that must, we should become the vocal minority. in our own countries even&hellip;<br>
God help us .</p>

		<p>What Muslims lack in IQ, they make up in WISDOM. Why slam Muslims for their low IQ when even President J Buchanan vetoed a bill meant to increase the number of colleges in America on the basis that too many educated people isn&rsquo;t good for the nation? High IQ &amp; mass-education lead to ethnic suicide via Democracy by killing collective humility with individualism. Get off your high(IQ) horse! </p>

		<p>Get off the high IQ horse?  High IQ is in the range 120-140.  He wasn&rsquo;t stating you had to be a genius to be respected and he wasn&rsquo;t stating you had to be a 140 IQ to be a useful member of society.  An IQ of 80 or so is BORDERLINE RETARDED.  Nobody is saying that folks with lower IQ&rsquo;s should be persecuted.  What&rsquo;s being said is you don&rsquo;t run your country based upon the advice or demands of RETARDS and certainly not retards whom have NO wish to assimilate and view the society upon which they feed parasitically with hostility.  The black problem, and the muslim problem we are seeing results from two main causes - blacks and the run of the mill muslims are borderline retards, and blacks and run of the mill muslims expect everybody else to gimme gimme gimme to them with NO respect or cooperation in return.  Just more demands.<br>
And they hate the hosts upon whom they feed.  </p>

		<p>Bill R, you miss the point. Arabs in the UAE with IQs of 80 are born into a 100% subsidized middle class lifestyle in traditional families that&rsquo;d make you weep with envy while you over-educated individualistic Westerner singles with 3 digit IQs work 60hrs weekly for them to finance the Islamization of America &amp; Europe. Wisdom &amp; Inteligence are 2 unrelated mind frames and you wouldn&rsquo;t be praising 3 digit IQ if you had it bc you&rsquo;d see how it begets ethnic suicide when it becomes common</p>

		<p>I always wanted to go and visit Paris, but I&rsquo;ve read that huge swaths of the city are now no-go zones for white people.  When I first heard about that I wondered what the young French liberals thought about that?  Then I read another article that said most are in denial and continue to defend the expansion of immigration. </p>
<p>I saw a clip of a march last year in which north Africans began attacking white college students who were marching for some liberal cause.  I wonder what mental gymnastics they used to defend that!  &#8220;Oh, they attacked us because they are so oppressed!&#8221;  </p>
<p>I wonder what the victims of Ghenghiz Khan said when his men were burning cities and making pyramids of skulls!  &#8220;Oh, the nomadic tribesmen have been discriminated against for so long&hellip;&#8221;  CHOP!</p>

<p>If I decided i was going to &#8220;reject French culture and its values&#8221;, I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t be sticking around in France very long.</p>
