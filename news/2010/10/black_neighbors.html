<h1>Black Neighbors to Picket Woman&rsquo;s Confederate Flag</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bruce Smith, Buffalo News, October 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Annie Chambers Caddell, whose ancestors fought in the Civil War, insists the Confederate flag flying over her home is an important reminder of her heritage. But for her neigbors in this tree-shrouded, historically black neighborhood, it&rsquo;s an unpleasant reminder of a by-gone era they&rsquo;d rather not see every time they pass by her house.</p>
<p>Caddell, who is white, moved into the Brownsville neighborhood in June and began flying the flag about a month later. Since then, more than 200 residents signed a protest petition, and now neighbors plan to march Saturday along the street in front of Caddell&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>&#8220;My first reaction was they are going to do what they think they need to do,&#8221; said Caddell, 50. &#8220;My second reaction was I&rsquo;m not going to be here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Caddell plans to be on nearby James Island on Saturday for the wedding of a friend who is black. She tearfully told the town council earlier this week that she is not racist.</p>
<p>She also flies the American flag from her modest brick house, and her yard has various ornaments including a gnome, Halloween and Thanksgiving decorations, and a sign on her fence reading, &#8220;Confederate Boulevard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That flag means a lot more to me than anything I can describe to you,&#8221; Caddell said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s my heritage and it&rsquo;s my right. I&rsquo;m not trying to slam anybody, and I wish I wouldn&rsquo;t be slammed either.&#8221;</p>
<p>James Patterson, a 43-year-old crane operator who lives in a mobile home next door, said displaying the flag is insensitive.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know she has a legal right to do that on her property. But just because it&rsquo;s legally right, doesn&rsquo;t make it morally right,&#8221; said Patterson, who is black. &#8220;You can put up what you want, but if this was a Jewish community and someone moved in and started flying swastika flags, there would be a lot of hell raised about that as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Violet Saylor, a 74-year-old retired social worker who lives about three blocks away, said the flag brings back to her memories of Jim Crow in the neighborhood she has lived all her life.</p>
<p>&#8220;She shouldn&rsquo;t fly that flag because it represents slavery and the Ku Klux Klan that used to ride through the town and we used to have to turn our lights off and hide behind the shades,&#8221; said Saylor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I could take it down, but what message does that send?&#8221; she [Caddell] asked. &#8220;If you don&rsquo;t stand for something, you&rsquo;ll never be anything.&#8221;<br>

Reminds me of an old bouncer I worked with. I thought he was pretty much more trouble than the customers till the day he told a half dozen bikers to leave then verbalized  calmly and resoutely, &#8220;This is NOT a negotiation, but  an announcement!&#8221;<br>

		<p>The Confederate flag has a context not the same thing as it did in 1861. The flag in the modern context means a rebellious person [but not violent], a person unconventional, a person who goes against the grain, but not in a bad way.</p>
<p>&#8220;the&#8221; [K] &#8220;that used to ride through the town and we used to have to turn our lights off and hide behind the shades,&#8221;</p>
<p>Violet - - today you turn your lights off and hide behind the shades because of STREET GANG MEMBER - - and it is not a whitey street gang member either. Violet!!</p>

		<p>Like blacks care one whit about the &#8220;slaves&#8221;&hellip; they are only concerned with getting &#8220;reparations&#8221; and more freebies from Whitey, by holding all our &#8220;sins&#8221; (which isn&rsquo;t a sin in the first place), over our collective heads to get what they never have worked for. Good for that lady! More Whites need to stand up against the ever increasing demonization of Whites.</p>

		<p>I see a fair number of Confederate flags in my neck of the woods (rural western WA), and we&rsquo;re pretty far from the South.  They are usually window decals on a pickup or a bumper sticker.  I think  the Rowdy Rebel shop does a brisk business here too.  Nobody seems offended.  But then, you don&rsquo;t see too many blacks around here anyway.<br>
While I applaud this woman&rsquo;s guts, I just wish she didn&rsquo;t feel the need to cry to the town council that she is &#8220;not a racist&#8221;.  I dropped that phrase from my vocabulary years ago.</p>

		<p>I guess for some people the War Between the States is still not over. My husband is also a descendent of someone who fought in the war. I am Asian American and have no issue with the Confederate Flag. I also encouraged him to join the Sons of Confederate War Veterans but unfortunately, due to his work schedule, he was unable to take part. Some people still do not understand heritage not hate.</p>

		<p>While I do give her credit for guts, it is simply not the same as when a man flaunts the Stars and Bars.  A woman is not likely to be attacked, merely because she is a woman and voilent acts towards women have much more criminal/legal implications, which leaves a man more vulnerable.  Just as white women are becoming the safe alternative among conservatives in politics, somehow fulfilling at least one aspect of liberal, feminist conditions, white women are turning out to be the leaders because white men are increaslingly politcally denied the right.</p>

<p>The Confederate Battle Flag is the world&rsquo;s best selling flag, or at least it was about 10 years ago.  (I bet it still is.)  Something which you have to dig deep to find out.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;You can put up what you want, but if this was a Jewish community and someone moved in and started flying swastika flags, there would be a lot of hell raised about that as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not the same thing.  The Nazis set about intentionally murdering a people because of their religion and ethnicity.  The Confederate Flag is part of history and did not represent the K until black politicians said it did.  Even the K didn&rsquo;t - as far as I know - plan to murder every black person on earth.  The issue was about States Rights, and an economic model that the South had come to rely on, even if they were increasingly uncomfortable with it, as the historical evidence shows.  If slavery was the entire issue, then it was hypocritical for Northern mills to take the cotton from the South.  No, there were long standing hard feeling between Northern whites and Southern whites.  Northern whites resented the rich, plantation owners, their education, lifestyle, etc., while the Northerner was a victim of his own Puritan heritage that forbade fun, and sought to focus the mind on work and work, with little pleasure.  I know this, because I have ancestors who were Yankees and I have read their army regiment&rsquo;s history.  It is full of songs about hating the Southern elitists, and also not caring one bit about a black man, or as one poem puts it, &#8220;n*****s.&#8221;  This from enlisted Yankee soldiers.  It was religious fanatics like John Brown that gave the war its righteous, religious content.  Lincoln incorporated that into policy AFTER he saw how few volunteers just &#8220;saving the union brought.&#8221;  So most Northerners were hooked by their hatred of Southerners and their really dour, self-righteous Christianity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not stopping there.  Here is a good a place as any to point out that the most popular Union song, &#8220;The Battle Hymn of the Republic&#8221; contains the most poisonous words, where white survival is concerned.  Just consider this phrase,  &#8220;In the image of his father Christ was born across the sea, with a glory in his bossum that transfigures you and me.  As he died to make men HOLY, let us DIE to make men FREE, as God goes marching on!&#8221;</p>

		<p>Blacks always try to treat the Confederate flag as some sort of pro-slavery symbol.  The Civil War was fought for many reasons, including the imposition by the northern states of tariffs that were ruinous for the southern states.  No doubt some slave owners did fight to preserve slavery, but their best general, Robert E. Lee, was morally opposed to slavery.</p>
<p>I doubt that slavery is endorsed by any of those proud Southerners who aren&rsquo;t ashamed of which side their ancestors fought for and are flying the Confederate flag.  After all, had there been no slavery this country wouldn&rsquo;t have 40 million whining black people blaming all of their problems on a practice that ended 150 years ago.</p>

		<p>I flew the flag one day at my private business (I live in Canada).  </p>
<p>Checking my old phone messages a few days later, a whiney-voiced caller aked me if I &#8220;knew the flag was offensive to black people&#8221;.</p>
<p>Almost all the blacks in Canada are recent arrivals from Africa and the Caribbean, to whom the flag has no direct relevance. </p>
<p>The complainer was most certainly white. Taking offense is so trendy among white liberals, they&rsquo;ll do it on behalf of others.</p>

		<p>Black peoples&rsquo;s immaturity again. The need to garner attention for themselves and create chaos where none exists. This country has allowed people to march down its streets wearing nazi insignias. A lot of people didn&rsquo;t like it but it was allowed.</p>
<p>Only this country&rsquo;s current climate gives blacks the audacity to think they are the only ones with a claim to find anything  objectionable. And, as usual, the media will oblige. And, as usual, they are incredibly ignorant of history:</p>
<p>1.)The K had their own flag. It featured a dragon in the center.</p>
<p>2.)The K assaulted or killed as many white people as black people, maybe more.</p>
<p>3.)Blacks were captured in their countries of origin by OTHER BLACK PEOPLE and sold as slaves to traders.</p>
<p>4.)Blacks voluntarily fought for the Confederate Army.</p>
<p>5.)Wealthy blacks of that era also owned black slaves.</p>
<p>Blacks continually painting themselves as victims is growing real old. Especially with the havoc they create wherever they go. Poster #3. has it right - they&rsquo;re just looking for something free out of it. Let the media keep reporting these &#8220;Oh, us poor black people!&#8221; stories. It just shows the stupidity of both. </p>

		<p> Bravo, Annie Caddell! Way to stand up for your rights. This is a ginned-up controversy, with blacks voicing alleged &#8220;outrage&#8221; because they don&rsquo;t want you to have the same rights to free speech that they do.</p>
<p> My only criticism of you: You shouldn&rsquo;t have protested that you are &#8220;not a racist&#8221; to the town council. That&rsquo;s what these people love to try to maneuver us into doing   &mdash;   protesting that we&rsquo;re &#8220;not racist.&#8221; That way, we sound defensive and unsure of ourselves. I occasionally post on a website in my home town, and sometimes what I post annoys our local handful of bleeding-heart liberals (mostly women). When they call me &#8220;racist&#8221; and a &#8220;hater,&#8221; I never address that. I always try to turn the argument back on them   &mdash;   and usually succeed. Don&rsquo;t apologize, don&rsquo;t explain   &mdash;   that&rsquo;s my motto.</p>

		<p>Great! Now blacks will take notice of this and before you know it, confederate flags which i have seen in Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, Alabama, along with many others&hellip;will be introduced to a wave of african-americans protesting, demonstrating and marching what they all learned in school and know they can get away with. <br>
If this makes national news, i feel so bad for this woman who claims not to be racist, and i admire her courage to defend her ancestory. </p>

		<p>To 8  &mdash;  Question Diversity:</p>
<p>I just returned from a trip to Italy.  While traveling through the city of Naples I could not help but notice all the shops selling Confederate Battle Flags.  A companion of mine informed me the flag is quite popular among Southern Italians, who fought their own war against Northern agression (the so-called &#8220;Risorgimento&#8221;) while the Confederacy was fighting against Lincoln&rsquo;s tyranny.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting a number of veterans of the Army of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies &#8220;donned the gray&#8221; during the War between the States (Garibaldi, by the way, sided with the Union).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reformation.org/garibaldi_lincoln.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.reformation.org/garibaldi_lincoln.html</a></p>
<p>The Confederate Battle Flag is one of the most recognized symbols on earth, and represents resistance to tyranny.  Kudos to Annie Caddell.</p>

		<p>If it wasn&rsquo;t for silly liberals and other race baiters, blacks would probably grumble to themselves and go about their business when confronted with something they don&rsquo;t like.  Now, they&rsquo;re encouraged  &mdash;  if not expected  &mdash;  to raise a fuss over every perceived slight.  Now, with the Republicans poised to retake the House, the left has been reduced to jibbering lunatics lashing out at every word uttered by a Tea Partier, seeing in every shadow a looming, anti-black menace prepared to reinstitute poll taxes and even Jim Crow.  </p>

<p>We feel that the South was in the right.  And this woman has every right to fly that flag.  Sure it&rsquo;s a symbol of rebellion&hellip;but weren&rsquo;t Americans the rebels during the American Revolution?</p>
<p>No wonder Communists hate property rights.  They want to be able to tell you what you can or can&rsquo;t do on your own property.</p>

		<p>The Confederate flag is one of many from American history,such as the &#8220;Don&rsquo;t Tread On Me&#8221; flag prominent in tea party rallies. Oh wait, that is racist too! Just as they have learned how to live off of White society, they have learned how to get their way by crying racism at anything they don&rsquo;t like. I wear Confederate flag shirts and fly the flag as an in your face statement. In response to this black provocation I&rsquo;d like to see Confederate flags flying proudly everywhere at White homes in America. Show them how counter-productive their whining is!</p>

		<p>I have ancestors who were in both armies, though mostly Union.  As a history buff, I see the value in both flags.  It was the times and people believed for what both flags stood for.  As an American I feel it is my right to display any and all historical flags that went into the making of my nation.  (Anyone seen the old Albany Plan of Union Flag!)</p>
<p>I understand the feelings of black folks on the issue.  However, there is a double standard here.  Mexicans, puerto ricans, etc routinely fly their flags all over the place, and sometimes on federal and gov&rsquo;t buildings, like how they do it in the southwest with mexican flags on post offices, at schools, etc.</p>
<p>How should I feel about that?  Blatant attacks on my nation&rsquo;s integrity!  They&rsquo;re saying, &#8220;This is ours now.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Blacks are silent on these issues, even though blacks have the most to lose (and are losing the most) with the current latino invasion.  </p>
<p>What about black people marching and waving their black liberation flags?  You know, the ones with the red, green and black colors?  They are hoisting a symbol of allegiance to something other than this country, a country that shafted them at first but then has come back on the alter of repentance and shifts billions of dollars to them EACH YEAR in &#8216;free&rsquo; social programs (paid for by white taxpayers).</p>
<p>A nazi flag in a jewish neighborhood?  Probably a bad idea, mainly because THIS country FOUGHT naziism and thus it is not a historical symbol of my nation.  For that matter, old Soviet flags and other communist symbols should also be frowned upon, as we FOUGHT them too for 40 years in the Cold War and proxy wars around the world.</p>
<p>The Confederate flag was a home grown flag and the people who made it were citizens before, and then again after that tumultuous time.  It is part of our heritage, and does not have to be a symbol of hate to anyone.  Besides, 95% of the people of the south never had any slaves.  It was the 5% landed class with the enormous plantations.  </p>
<p>Go blame the rich of that era, like the rich of our era, who are betraying us by aiding in the importation and employment of millions of slave-like illegal aliens to work for them, but don&rsquo;t blame the back woods boys and yoeman farmers who were sold a bill of states rights rather than the idea they were protecting slavery.</p>

		<p>Good for her! As usual, blacks look for &#8220;Racism&#8221; and &#8220;Oppression&#8221; everywhere.  Just another excuse to blame the white folks, meaning us, for all of their never-ending problems, because they have neither the determination, nor guts to tackle their own issues.  I&rsquo;m half Jewish, and did lose relatives to the Holocaust&hellip;By blacks&rsquo; convuluted and childish thinking, geuss then, I should be going after everyone who has a &#8220;West Coast Choppers&#8221; sticker on their vehicle, the Iron Cross motorcycle club, and other bikers who like to put iron cross symbols on their colors.

<p>I feel sorry for the woman if that is the best she can afford to move to.</p>
<p>I also think she is a fool to bait the bear and then tell the world she is leaving for the weekend to go to &#8216;a black friend&rsquo;s wedding&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Like that will somehow protect her from vandalism of her property while she is gone.</p>
<p>And the reality for blacks is that it is a reminder, more than of the brutality of slavery (which none alive have ever seen), but rather that a century and a half after the fall of the South and the rise of mechanization, they are still where they were.  </p>
<p>And now not wanted at all.</p>
<p>If whites would stop trying to cover up the fact that &#8216;heritage&rsquo; means an insurgency fought, white on white, over the right to free labor vs. the demand that it stop or be unlawfully taxed &#8216;in a capitalist system&rsquo;; we might be better able to decide whether our present country is still something worth fighting for.</p>
<p>Because as far as I can tell, the issues haven&rsquo;t changed, only the depth of depravity by which a movement became a racket.  For the &#8216;advancement&rsquo; of _one_ race.  Not ours.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot the South has to answer for in bringing the problem population here.  There&rsquo;s a lot more the North must speak to for destroying the system which kept that group contained and allowing it to spread.</p>
<p>The &#8216;romanticism&rsquo; of The Rebel Cause that gives us such allure should not be seen as slavery however; rather it is the time when whites ruled their own lands and believed in their own cause as destiny.  That is what that Civil War really cost us.</p>

		<p>I think courts in the United States have already ruled that it is illegal to protest outside someone&rsquo;s home; the point they made is that the person being protested is a &#8220;captive audience&#8221;.

		<p>Also, Anonymous 27, you should be freaking out about the Bundesluftwaffe, which still uses the black Cross-Pattee on its aircraft.  This symbol actaully has nothing whatever to do with the Nazis, who used the Balkan Cross on their aircraft (straight arms, rather than curved.)</p>
<p>Both crosses - in black on white backgrounds - were used by the Teutonic Knights, who were forbidden to display personal - individual coats of arms.  It thus seemed a logical choice as a marking for German aircraft.</p>
<p>As an aside, the French also made a logical choice, and simply adopted the national cockade as their aircraft insignea, while their allies, the British used the cockade with the colors reversed, the Canadians later substituting a red maple leaf for the central red spot and the Australians a red kangaroo.</p>
<p>Military organizations like continuity; it helps them instill an esprit de corps in their members, and in Germany&rsquo;s case the Cross-Pattee had at least not been tarnished by the behavior of the Nazis, so that was chosen when the Luftwaffe was reformed in 1956.</p>

		<p>An interesting confrontation is being set up.  Several weeks ago, an African woman in Chicago shot and wounded several African punks who&rsquo;d been terrorizing her and her home.  She was roundly applauded by the local MSM and its pointy-headed White libs who lauded her in sticking up for herself.</p>
<p>What will happen if these blacks parading in Buffalo in front of her house (why aren&rsquo;t they at work?) decide to heave bricks at her house and she responds with gunfire?  Will she be held up as a hero?</p>
<p>No, she&rsquo;s White.</p>
<p>The only thing worse would be if she were a White MAN.  When he opened fire, all we&rsquo;d hear would be about the little darlings out on the sidewalk who were misunderstood youths who were trying to turn their lives around, aspiring to play in the NBA, and planning on returning to school.</p>
<p>The nonsense goes on and on.</p>

Of course her car was full of the by-products of her cheap sex escapades.  Where was the sensitivity to my family and white brethren?</p>

		<p>This  white woman  moved into an already established &#8220;historically black neighborhood&#8221;. As the new kid on the block, she needs to realize that she needs to fit in with the people already living there, not make them accomodate her. She is doing what we deplore about non-white minorities moving into white neighborhoods, and it isn&rsquo;t right either way. She knew full well that her Confederate flag would upset her new neighbors unless she has spent her entire life living under  rock. If blacks had moved in AFTER her and asked her to take down her flag, I would back her to the hilt to keep her flag up, but in this case, she really needs to haul in her colors!

		<p>My history teacher said it best. Slavery was an institution under the american flag for over a hundered years.   The confederate flag we see today was solely used for the purpose of going into battle.  There were numerous ones.  Have her replace it with another one and I bet they&rsquo;ll all be too stupid to even notice. The fight was mainly a territorial one. Lincolns plan before being shot was to send the former slaves back to africa.   He was also a staunch racists. The north and south conflict was about industrialization versus agriculturalization$$$$$$$$$$$ </p>

		<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s a lot the South has to answer for in bringing the problem population here.&#8221; Anonymous, the South did no such thing! It was England and New England that ran the slave trade and if England had not forbidden it and hunted slave ships, New England would have continued to ship slaves from Africa to the New World. As well, it was the SOUTH that made law forbidding the importation of slaves, the North also had slavery until it proved unprofitable (except the trade itself) and of that trade, 80% went to the West Indies and Central and South America; only 20% went to the Southern states. New England was the ENGINE of the slave trade, not the Carolinas or the cotton states.</p>

<p>I agree.  Pissing off your neighbors is just never a good idea, regardless of your politics.  We must all choose our battles carefully, &amp; this one seems pointless to me.  She could have hung the flag indoors, or in an inconspicuous spot in the  backyard, instead of waving this red flag in front of a chronically angry bull.  Tossing bricks at a hornets&rsquo; nest is another picture that comes to mind.  I question her motives and/or common sense.<br>

		<p>The absolute most informative &#8220;true&#8221; history about the War Between The States&#8221; is at Southern Heritage 411.  The president is one H.K. Edgerton, a former NAACP chapter president in North Caroling.  Treatment of slaves as depicted in Hollywoods was the exception, not the rule.  MajGen Patrick Cleburne warned the Confederate government of the consequences of defeat to the invading northern hordes, including control of how the history was recorded.<br>
  At Southern Heritage 411, read the Slave Narratives then tell me what side they were on.  An incident at Brisbane, LA records a federal troop driving out the Confederate defenders, and mistreated the slaves there, making laborers of them but allowing them to starve.  When the Confederates then sent a larger force to drive the federals out, the slaves were crying for their masters to come and save them.  The Confederate soldiers gave them such food as they had along with medicine.  But noooooooooooo, we will not hear such accounts as this, or the fact that tens of thousands of free blacks fought for the Confederacy, including H.K. Edgerton&rsquo;s ancestors.  And we will never hear of the 800,000 slaves that volunteered to join the Confederate army after the congress passed the law permitting slaves (300,000) to fight for freedom.  The law passed in March 1865 and was too late to make a difference in the outcome.<br>
  Myself, I always fly the 3rd National Confederate Flag, of which most people are not aware of.  As the current CBF is a flag of war, most folks in the Confederate/Southern Nationalist  movement also fly the 3rd National Flag to honour their heritage.  Those devilish carpetbaggers and southern scalawags did a remarkable job in rendering the false history of the time period 1861-65.</p>

		<p>WR #11: If the Civil War, which began in 1861, was about Slavery, why did Lincoln wait until 1863 to write the Emancipation Proclamation? </p>
<p>Further, Lincoln only freed the Slaves in States that were in rebellion to the Union; not in the North where Slaves were held, or in the Western territories, either. That doesn&rsquo;t get much air-time, does it?</p>
<p>Many Blacks in the South were also Slave Owners and had many Black Slaves, along with Native Indian Tribes, like the Cherokee.</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson tried repeatedly to stop the importation of Slaves into the Virginia Colony, while George Washington, another Virginian, noted in his Will, that all his Slaves were to be freed upon the death of his wife, Martha.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a shame that most Americans, especially White Americans, do not know their History, as it actually happened, and not the Marxist re-write that most people get in Public Schools. Just the same, most people used to sleep, or day dream, in History Class, and most likely, not much has changed.<br>

		<p>I wonder if blacks would object to flying various African countries&rsquo; flags, since African countries today routinely violate human rights?  And we might note that black African countries such as Zimbabwe and the new South Africa are busy ethnically cleansing White people from their lands.  As usual, it is a one sided race war. Note the assumption of black privilege here: if blacks are &#8220;offended,&#8221; then they have a right to violate other people&rsquo;s freedom of speech as well as property rights.</p>
